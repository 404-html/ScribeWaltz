1
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,310
You dirty bitch and we're back.
This episode of the Joe Rogan podcast is

2
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:17,301
brought to you by ting.
Ting is a mobile phone companies that 

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,870
we've talked about on this podcast many 
times,

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,910
one of my favorite sponsors because you 
would think like if you look for 

5
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,910
something cool,
you'd say,

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,910
well,
you know,

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:30,231
maybe like a a company that sells 
paintings is cool or a company that 

8
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:35,871
makes sculptures is cool,
but you don't think of like cell phone 

9
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:36,810
companies as being cool like what are 
they?

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,840
They're just cell phone companies.
But when a cell phone company goes out 

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,291
of their way to give you a service that 
first of all it's is like it's Kinda,

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,310
it's,
it's a better deal.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,840
It's,
it feels more ethical.

14
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:53,841
Like from a business standpoint.
They allow you to cancel your contract 

15
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:55,710
at any time they credit you on unused 
service,

16
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:57,270
which I've never heard of before.

17
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,030
If you use less than you thought you 
would,

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,250
ting actually drops you down and they 
credit you the difference on your next 

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,310
bill.
They drop you down to the next level.

20
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:12,410
Whatever you actually did use.
I've gotten so many twitter messages 

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:16,491
from people that tell me that they're 
saving money every month since I 

22
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:16,491
switched over.
Like one dude was.

23
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,850
He was spending like 90 something 
dollars on another cell phone company 

24
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,530
and he said he brought it down to 18.
Now that that's fucking insane.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,200
I don't know.
You know what his use was like,

26
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,410
but if he's telling the truth,
if he's not just some crazy troll making

27
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,060
shit up,
I kind of verified or deny.

28
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,290
I bet he was like on an iphone,
barely using it on a verizon plan and 

29
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,290
they switched down to like a galaxy s 
three.

30
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:38,760
You know what I mean?
It is.

31
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,330
Iphone iphones cause a lot of money.
Just you look at the mega yet.

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

33
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,200
We looked at it last week,
but did you.

34
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,060
Did you take a look at it?
Fucked with it or investigated now?

35
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:49,460
Apparently they're going to do two of 
them.

36
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,520
Whatever.
The fucking what they have.

37
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,550
The Samsung Galaxy note too is amazing.
If you want like a giant phone,

38
00:01:57,861 --> 00:01:59,600
you really don't need anything more 
giant than that.

39
00:01:59,601 --> 00:02:00,710
I don't think.
I mean,

40
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,330
I never thought you would need one this 
giant,

41
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,750
but they haven't attained.
Um,

42
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,850
they also allow you to combine your 
service so you and your wife or you and 

43
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,150
your friend,
whoever you can,

44
00:02:11,151 --> 00:02:16,151
you can share a bill and split time,
go to [inaudible] Dot [inaudible] Dot 

45
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:18,230
Com and save 25 bucks off either service
or one of their phones.

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,420
Uh,
we're also brought to you by hover.

47
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,230
Hover is uh,
the internet domain name company.

48
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:28,231
This is actually owned by the same 
people that own Tang and they have the 

49
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,300
same sort of attitude about it and it's 
an excellent service.

50
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:32,120
The service that I personally have used,
if you,

51
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,860
um,
if you use it,

52
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:38,861
you can get things that most domain name
companies would charge you for the give 

53
00:02:38,871 --> 00:02:39,560
it to you for free.

54
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,070
Like who is domain name privacy where 
you know,

00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:56,090
mouth.
Party tea party.

60
00:02:56,091 --> 00:03:01,091
In my mind I just registered hot.
Do things when I had a bunch of things,

61
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,530
I shot a bunch of videos with hot girls

Hot Girls Step on me and they just saw 

63
00:03:10,531 --> 00:03:15,121

It was they wanted to raise money for

Watch some hike this weekend.

81
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,700
I watched the whole episode.
They shot nothing.

82
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,900
They hiked in Montana for days.
Cold.

83
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah.
Dead Dodi was sleeping outside.

84
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,310
Terrifying episode.
Where there now that they were there in 

85
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,850
November before Thanksgiving and slept 
outside.

86
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,370
No tent.
You're crazy.

87
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,150
Let me get through this.

88
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:21,940
Add real quick.
If you go to [inaudible] dot com,

89
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,570
there's a whole bunch of new shit that's
been added to a on it,

90
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:28,330
especially in the strength and 
conditioning department.

91
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,030
We started this new company called 
primal bells.

92
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:34,600
The first one is this chimpanzee that 
looks like he's biting your Dick off.

93
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,520
And uh,
that's the face.

94
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,500
That's why I like to think of when I'm 
working out.

95
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,930
That's what I'm trying to avoid.
So these,

96
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:42,340
uh,
we've got more common.

97
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:44,980
We got this bad ass gorilla common and 
there's some other.

98
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:50,070
I don't want to tell you all of them,
but a lot of really cool ones coming up 

99
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:53,911
and they're essentially an art.
We're hiring people to sculpt these 

100
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:53,911
things,
these ideas that we have.

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,000
And we were getting people that work in 
the special effects companies,

102
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,340
the ones that chimpanzee ones are a 
little obsessed.

103
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,060
It's amazing by the way,
for you people in French,

104
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:05,430
it's pronounced cheekbones z.

105
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,060
She ballsy.
He gets his bed.

106
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:12,930
He used to get in there,
son getting their cakes,

107
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,810
brother.
All right,

108
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,900
there's something had to die to make 
butter or things go to o n n it.

109
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,310
And uh,
if you use a code name broken,

110
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:23,500
you will save 10 percent off any of the 
supplements,

111
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,030
including Alpha brain,
shroom,

112
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:26,460
tech,
all the,

113
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,620
the groove of Shit that we talk about on
the podcast all the time.

114
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,060
Um,
there is always new,

115
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,320
always new Shit and interesting shit 
that we sell from on it.

116
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:37,930
You know,
anything.

117
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,030
Every time we find out anything cool on 
the web,

118
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:45,031
like Blendtec blenders or when we found 
out about bulletproof coffee and a lot 

119
00:05:45,031 --> 00:05:47,050
of coffee has,
according to Dave Asprey,

120
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,210
lot of coffee that you're getting has 
fungus on it,

121
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:50,740
mycotoxins.
And you know,

122
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:55,741
you,
you don't get the same experience from 

123
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:55,741
drinking that as you do from a drinking 
coffee.

124
00:05:55,741 --> 00:05:57,350
That's fungus free confidence,
fungus free.

125
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,380
He believes is way less wearing on your 
system.

126
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,740
He thinks a lot of the crash that people
associate with drinking coffee is 

127
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,611
actually your body reacting to the 
mycotoxins and regular good clean 

128
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,200
coffee.
Like what he sells is called bulletproof

129
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:17,120
upgraded coffee is a mycotoxin free and 
it should be drinking right now.

130
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,410
St Michael or Mike.
Mike,

131
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:23,411
go mycotoxins there.
They're tiny little fungi that grow all 

132
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,010
over coffee apparently.
Haven't seen that show.

133
00:06:25,011 --> 00:06:26,480
Dangerous grinds.
No.

134
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,610
Or deadliest.
Whatever the fuck it was called.

135
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,940
It was a guy would go all dangerous 
grounds.

136
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,030
A guy would go all over the country to 
really exotic places where they would 

137
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,190
make coffee,
where they grow coffee.

138
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,490
It was a lot of coffee's grown.
Yeah.

139
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:45,440
Wanda and um,
and some of the best is in Hawaiian.

140
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:46,200
Yeah.
Um,

141
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,340
but these,
it requires like a specific climate and 

142
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:54,431
this guy would go there and he said one 
of the real issues is an alum of this 

143
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:54,431
stuff gets toxic.

144
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,180
It gets mold grows on it,
and if you drink that,

145
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:58,240
you're drinking like mold soup,
you know,

146
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,480
that's,
that's really interesting.

147
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,190
Totally makes sense.
Totally makes sense.

148
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,630
And something nobody ever thought about 
before,

149
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,660
but Dave asked,
we thought about it and he,

150
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,010
we were like,
let's sell Dave asprey shit.

151
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:10,670
Let's sell bulletproof coffee.
How does he keep it from being a mold?

152
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,930
They get it from a single source.
One.

153
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:16,400
One company takes care of it.
From the moment the plant is grown,

154
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,590
they,
it's all about putting it in the correct

155
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:23,591
environment and making sure that it 
doesn't have access or exposure to ntds 

156
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:23,690
funguses.
So,

157
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,220
uh,
so we,

158
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,560
we saw that shit on it.
Good on.

159
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,520
Oh.
And it use a codename Rogan.

160
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:30,650
And Go fuck yourself.
All right.

161
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,740
Steven was here.
Brian counts here.

162
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,770
Let's get freaky.
It just got to music.

163
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:40,780
Brian Cho who Rhogam.
He is the best to do Brian already 

164
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:44,150
forgot.
Oh,

165
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:45,510
I know what he's doing.
He's gonna.

166
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,950
He's gonna.
Put the silly one.

167
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,230
I forgot to do it.
Do you have the silly one?

168
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,220
That's all right.
We just played that one a couple of days

169
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:55,460
ago.

170
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,230
Mr Rinella.
What's up,

171
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:00,890
brother?
How are you,

172
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:01,970
man?
Good to see you again.

173
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,800
Where's my bear?
Me.

174
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,260
You know,
we evolved,

175
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,640
gone through a,
a very,

176
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:12,641
uh,
unique and spectacular experience 

177
00:08:12,641 --> 00:08:12,641
together.
You do it on a regular basis,

178
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,550
but all of us like doing that together.
I'll never forget that.

179
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,620
I'll never forget that trip for the rest
of my life.

180
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:23,621
We had a great fucking time.
I watched the episodes twice and I love 

181
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:24,530
them and I thought it was shot really 
well.

182
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:26,600
I thought the music was amazing.
I thought it was amazing.

183
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,900
It turns,
it turns you into blood brothers out in 

184
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:31,900
the field.
No doubt.

185
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,130
Yeah,
it's a totally.

186
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,840
Yeah.
And to see how people respond to,

187
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,230
to like waking up in the fucking 
freezing cold and nobody bitched out.

188
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:41,750
Everybody kept it together.
That's important.

189
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:46,751
You can take some fucking set through 
green type characters with a on the 

190
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:46,751
road.
Sorry,

191
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:47,540
Seth Green.
I don't know why I picked on you.

192
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,550
How about me?
How about Joe Rogan,

193
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:54,551
tub chair white.
That doesn't make sense because I did 

194
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:56,381
it,
but I mean there's a lot of people out 

195
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:56,381
there.
Sorry Seth,

196
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:56,381
I have no reason to take shots at you.

197
00:08:56,381 --> 00:09:01,370
Do you know?
Did I tell you that what they 

198
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,751
anthropologists,
they did that study about how men who 

199
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,721
show up in a bar all done up and jewelry
and and why they get beaten up 

200
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:10,731
traditionally or why,
why there was this so much like actual 

201
00:09:10,731 --> 00:09:13,910
violent pressure for men to actually 
conform to a haircut and to a look like 

202
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,760
they.
The joke is men,

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,640
they have two criteria for how they 
dressed.

204
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:20,370
They don't want to look like a pussy and
they want to be comfortable and and they

205
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:22,320
mainly don't want to bring attention to 
themselves.

206
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,690
Like you don't see a guy unless you're 
wearing that ned retardy shirt,

207
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,420
but you know those guys usually they 
jacked and ready.

208
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,010
But for the most part men will wear 
things that are like blues and grays and

209
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,510
you know,
simple stuff.

210
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,440
Because this part at the Santa Claus was
talking about the idea that if you.

211
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,130
It goes back to how men used to hunt in 
groups and if a man,

212
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,620
if you guys were all set and we're going
to go hunting and all of a sudden I show

213
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:46,190
up and a bunch of sparkly shit and 
bangles.

214
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:51,191
They're making a bunch of noise.
You guys come in and you're gonna spoke 

215
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,021
to fucking deer.
They can see it a mile away and you're 

216
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:54,021
making like hanging,
hanging.

217
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:57,150
But I like these and I don't know,
getting shut down,

218
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:02,151
son.
I want to hear your point of view on it 

219
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:02,151
because look at how.
I mean,

220
00:10:02,151 --> 00:10:02,670
look at the way that a lot of,
uh,

221
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,720
of,
of indigenous hunters today still will 

222
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:07,720
adorn themselves.
Yes.

223
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:07,720
But they don't,
they for not,

224
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,170
not when they rented though,
right?

225
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,090
Isn't that for,
for positioning,

226
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:12,550
dancing stuff,
but not all.

227
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Like you might go and you might go to or
go into battle with like face paint or 

228
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:21,971
elaborate jewelry or there's,
there's so many accounts of like 

229
00:10:21,971 --> 00:10:25,750
command.
She who would wear wedding veils and 

230
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,260
stuff that they gathered during raids 
and just crazy.

231
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,630
I would always wear a wedding baile.
I think that's,

232
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,500
I don't want the deer to see what my 
expression change your,

233
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,000
your thing that I,
that I,

234
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,060
that I,
that I contested it and I don't,

235
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:42,090
I don't mean.
I don't mean to aggregate on the final 

236
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,740
it,
but it reminds me of what it reminds me 

237
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,401
of something similar that's equally 
interesting and just like I was reading 

238
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:50,351
this book on human evolution,
he was arguing how could it ever be be 

239
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:52,550
beneficial to be a daredevil,
right?

240
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,370
They'd be like,
what is the selective advantage to being

241
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,160
a daredevil?
And this guy argues that it's,

242
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:01,520
you're saying to a man is saying to 
females,

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,760
you're like,
I am so ridiculously fit.

244
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,020
You know that I can do something so 
stupid.

245
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,880
Instill,
thrive,

246
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,930
instill,
still breed.

247
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,390
You know,
like that's how I did it.

248
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,490
I

249
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:19,490
think we ended with this shit like 
wingsuits fighting bulls.

250
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,940
Men would fight bulls.
Fighting Bulls is kind of a scam because

251
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:28,941
there's a lot of other dudes involved.
Like it's not just a matador and the 

252
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:28,980
bull.
There's other dudes stabbing the bull.

253
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,700
They put poison darts into the bowl to 
creepy shit.

254
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,410
It's crazy.
Yeah.

255
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Yeah.
There's another dude that stabbed the 

256
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,440
bull.
Yeah,

257
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:39,440
the peccadilloes.
Yeah,

258
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,960
but when you're in a fucking wingsuit,
you're in a wingsuit.

259
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,850
Okay.
Those crazy assholes that jump off those

260
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:47,670
mountains and they're going 100 miles an
hour and those suits.

261
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,000
Have you seen him fly through cities 
like through the middle of buildings?

262
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,140
No,
dude.

263
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,980
There's a guy jumps out of

264
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,430
a plane in fucking Brazil.
Okay.

265
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,620
Jumps out of a plane and does this wing 
suit shit and he goes flying over the 

266
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,361
city through buildings.
There's a gap in between these two 

267
00:12:06,361 --> 00:12:09,841
buildings and he shoots through these 
two buildings before he pulls his 

268
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:12,880
parachute and land flapping.
Gliding.

269
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,030
It is.
It hurts your head when you're watching 

270
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,330
it.
What is it going to fucking die?

271
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:20,430
Yeah.
I mean,

272
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,570
how much can you really totally control 
it?

273
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,710
I don't know.
I mean,

274
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:25,300
I don't know how much you can really 
steer it.

275
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:28,300
Yes.
I guess this guy he and see.

276
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,140
Okay,
this.

277
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,480
Are you kidding?
That's.

278
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,520
No,
it's him and the wing suit.

279
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,500
This is the camera.
Look at that.

280
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:38,860
Oh my God.
Oh Jesus Christ.

281
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,530
Look at this.
Are you kidding?

282
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,760
By the way?
It was misty.

283
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,590
Okay.

284
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,970
Stories up any gap that is only 26 feet 
wide.

285
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,870
Oh,
that guy's a bad ass.

286
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,930
So who's behind this viral bolt through 
the Air Norwegian Yogi summer and 

287
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:57,110
Freshmen Ludovic worth stuntman 
sponsored by red.

288
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,590
Well,
it was more endorsed,

289
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,690
sponsored by red bull gangster.
You do an urban spots of the highest.

290
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:08,480
It's death defying.
Not to mention illegal jump.

291
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,580
The team took it this at 5:45
AM there 20 minutes before the first 

292
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:16,170
commercial flight would appear on real.
Supervise it.

293
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,570
Oh my God.
Imagine you gotta be

294
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,600
calculate when the first flight takes 
off in the air by a fucking plane going 

295
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,130
500 miles an hour.
Yeah.

296
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,270
Do you think you can time the plane,
how fast the planes coming at you as 

297
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,560
you're flying down towards the 600 miles
an hour you.

298
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,570
You ain't gotten away from that thing.
That's a rocket ship.

299
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,560
And so if that guy lands and in a woman 
is like,

300
00:13:40,561 --> 00:13:45,561
I am so impressed by that,
I'd like to go out with you for drinks 

301
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:48,981
tonight.
It would demonstrate that there's a 

302
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:48,981
selective advantage there.
Yeah,

303
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,670
there's a selective advantage and being 
a daredevil.

304
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,870
Yeah,
there's definitely.

305
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,990
That totally makes sense evolutionarily,
and it also makes sense that we have a 

306
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,551
disdain for people that are like wearing
jewelry and dress and flashy and 

307
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:05,720
tracking a lot of attention to the to 
ourselves because classically that that 

308
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,000
person who like aims to stand out so 
strongly ruins everything.

309
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,760
They get too loud,
they turn things into fights,

310
00:14:11,761 --> 00:14:16,761
you know,
that the person is like really loud and 

311
00:14:16,761 --> 00:14:18,060
flamboyant and they usually.
It's just a natural instinct.

312
00:14:18,061 --> 00:14:19,980
It's the feeling you get is like,
oh,

313
00:14:19,981 --> 00:14:21,510
look at this fucking guy.
Like,

314
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,690
what?
What is this guy going to bring to the 

315
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:26,690
party?
Like what?

316
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:26,690
He's not a team player.
He's not,

317
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,560
he's,
he's some crazy asshole with jewelry on.

318
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,650
Right?
What's he doing like criss angel?

319
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:33,510
Why is he wearing?
If I get annoyed at Chris Angel,

320
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,900
because he's too,
he's too into his body and he's doing it

321
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,700
was ripped jeans and I'm always like,
I don't know.

322
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,540
I'm sure I'd like them,
but when I see them I'm like,

323
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,460
punch that guy in the face,
man.

324
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,980
The fact that he's really muscular,
it's kind of a good looking guy,

325
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:45,730
so I'm a little jealous of them.
At the same time,

326
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:48,300
my and I don't like that guy.
Maybe I'm a little attractive.

327
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:52,070
That's probably one of the best ways to 
get girls ever to be a beautiful

328
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,880
magician.
Oh,

329
00:14:52,881 --> 00:14:57,881
he's awesome.
Beautiful Council magician with a great 

330
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:57,881
boss.
Great.

331
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:58,560
Must be ridiculous.
Got To love the guy.

332
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:03,810
Yeah.
It's like there's an evolutionary 

333
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:03,810
advantage in that way.
Are you kidding?

334
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,480
The muscular trigger match to be able to
trick that many people into thinking 

335
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,180
that your mysterious,
he's awesome.

336
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,140
I mean,
what are you doing?

337
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:10,160
I mean,
every magician,

338
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:11,960
it's Goddamn trickster,
but that's all they're doing.

339
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:13,430
They're just tricking you.
I'm friends.

340
00:15:13,431 --> 00:15:15,230
Pretty good.
Very good friends with David Blaine.

341
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,710
Women.
Have Him love him.

342
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,510
I'm good friends with Penn Jillette and 
women.

343
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:23,560
Love him about that.
That's even more impressive.

344
00:15:23,561 --> 00:15:25,460
That's impressive because Dave's a good 
looking guy.

345
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:28,160
He's got a mystery and you know,
tall and dark and stuff.

346
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,280
Pendula.
Lots of bad mother ever.

347
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,700
Tell you about Penn.
Like penn and teller is awesome.

348
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:36,230
David Lane,
who tried to fight Mike Tyson,

349
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:41,460
what's his story?
Tried to fight my david on the on the 

350
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:41,460
street and he's.

351
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,540
He's just checked.
I mean,

352
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,960
he felt like me,
but he was just so muscular.

353
00:15:44,961 --> 00:15:45,440
I was like,
david,

354
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:46,040
what are you doing?
He goes,

355
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,010
I was training for eight months to fight
Mike Tyson,

356
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,110
and when he went to a trainer,
it might've been teddy atlas,

357
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:51,650
something.
He goes,

358
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,550
I want to find my tights.
And I think,

359
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,190
I think it was teddy.
I'm sorry david.

360
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,540
If someone like that.
And he goes,

361
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,980
the trainer goes,
well,

362
00:15:57,981 --> 00:15:59,630
what's the trick?
And david said,

363
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:01,820
nothing.
I just want to last three rounds and the

364
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,340
trend goes not in this lifetime.
And he goes,

365
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:05,300
no,
we've got to think of.

366
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,200
I train hard.
He goes,

367
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:11,530
you're not gonna.
I'm not training you to fight Mike 

368
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:11,530
Tyson.
You won't last five seconds.

369
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:11,990
You never fought in your life.
You're a magician.

370
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:13,460
If there's not a trick,
it's not going to haPpen.

371
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,900
And Mike Tyson,
you know,

372
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:15,840
things.

373
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,580
David's magic apparently.
So.

374
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,760
So that didn't happen.
So he goes to another trainer and the 

375
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:22,760
trainer goes,
what's the trick?

376
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:22,970
And a,
because there's no trick,

377
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:23,690
I just want to do it.
He goes,

378
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,180
I'll take your money,
but it ain't gonna happen.

379
00:16:26,181 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm gonna tell you up front.
He goes,

380
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:27,290
no,
no,

381
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:32,291
I want to do it.
So david pays him a crazy amount of 

382
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:32,291
money and they start any trains for six 
months.

383
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,100
And finally they put him in the ring 
with his cruiser weight.

384
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,780
Just a guy who's their cruiser,
right?

385
00:16:35,781 --> 00:16:36,890
Tall,
thin guys,

386
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,900
you know who can,
who can box.

387
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,590
And david said that david said that the 
guy jabbed him once,

388
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:43,820
bam.
AnD they went,

389
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,560
oh my god,
oh,

390
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,350
he thought I was going to die.
And the guy goes,

391
00:16:48,351 --> 00:16:48,710
yeah,
all right.

392
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:49,720
And he goes,
I don't.

393
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,350
And then he hit him again.

394
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,820
And david was Like,
that's it.

395
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,310
I can't.
He took two jobs because I can't fight.

396
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,870
This is crazy.
He'd never,

397
00:16:56,871 --> 00:16:58,820
he had no idea how hard somebody could 
hit.

398
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,060
And the guy goes,
we've been telling you that the whole 

399
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,831
time.
That's a jab from a cruiserweight who's 

400
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:08,410
not even a top pro if you're talking 
about one of the hardest hitters in the 

401
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:08,750
game of all time.
They was like,

402
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,300
oh,
well I guess I could never do that.

403
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,230
When was he trying to do?
This is a long tiMe ago.

404
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,440
I like when mike Tyson was boxing still 
a.

405
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,510
It was right when he retired,
I believe.

406
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,750
Right when they with Mike Tyson do that.
He's ridiculous.

407
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,240
Why would he think that Mike Tyson was 
going to do the.

408
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:28,241
I don't know.
I'll talk to dave and I'll come back 

409
00:17:28,241 --> 00:17:30,161
with,
but it's kind of insulting for him to 

410
00:17:30,161 --> 00:17:33,371
even think that Mike Tyson one,
the greatest fighters of all time would 

411
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:33,371
be willing to do that.
Well,

412
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:36,050
david's david's kind of guy who just 
loves endurance.

413
00:17:36,051 --> 00:17:37,970
He loves thinking about the,
the hardest thing to do,

414
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:42,971
like he wanted to cross.
I don't know if I can say it on air 

415
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:42,971
because he made me a fighter.
Only has.

416
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:47,690
I mean even though Mike Tyson would run 
through him like a hot samurai sword 

417
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:47,990
through a molten piece of butter.
Yeah.

418
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,980
Fighter only has a certain amount of 
fights in

419
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,980
his life in a certain amount of times.
You can punch him in the head with your 

420
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,200
hands without them breaking certain 
amount of times.

421
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,660
You can explode moving on somebody and 
not tear a muscle.

422
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,900
You only have a certain amount of those 
lights that Mike Tyson would waste one 

423
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,060
of them.
Even if it would be a quick crushing,

424
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:08,540
why would he waste one of those?
FighTing a guy like that's so arrogant 

425
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,730
like he should have fucking.
You really think you.

426
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:11,490
You could be a boxer and fight Mike 
Tyson.

427
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,750
Have an amateur fight.
Just one image.

428
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,990
I think a lot of guys,
it goes back to what we were saying.

429
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,570
A lot of Dudes,
and we meet a lot of these guys in la.

430
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,130
A lot of guys don't really understand 
what it's like to be hit by somebody who

431
00:18:23,131 --> 00:18:25,620
can really hit you.
You don't have that experience.

432
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:30,650
You are you are you.
Your experience comes from what movies 

433
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,550
where you see a guy get punched in the 
face and he comes back and hits against 

434
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:34,550
you.
Think that's how it is.

435
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:38,780
Until you get hit by a guy who really 
understands how to hit and your whole 

436
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,780
world,
your whole world changes,

437
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,910
it's very difficult to relax to when 
someone's hitting you and one of the 

438
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,200
things that happens to people as they 
freak out and there's their stress level

439
00:18:49,201 --> 00:18:54,201
goes up so high,
they lose complete control of their 

440
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,080
ability to control their breath and they
get exhausted and they fall apart.

441
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,170
It's like one of tHe main things that 
happened.

442
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:01,470
It's because they can't process the 
actual reality of getting hit.

443
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,770
If you've been hit before,
you can calm yourself down like even 

444
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:06,770
though you know that like,
wow,

445
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,280
I just got hit hard,
but we got to keep moving.

446
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,050
We got it open.
Keep your eyes open,

447
00:19:10,051 --> 00:19:15,051
hands up,
and you start like calming yourself 

448
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,241
down,
but that's a process you have to get 

449
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:17,241
really,
really,

450
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:18,000
really used to it.
You ever see boxers were the gods taking

451
00:19:18,001 --> 00:19:23,001
a jab and then he has his eyes open.
Is countering eyes open while guys 

452
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:26,280
touched on their face,
like they get so comfortable with it.

453
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,950
They eat jabs with their eyes open.
It's incredible.

454
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,540
DIaz.
Nick diaz is really good at that.

455
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,940
Nick diaz can actually eat your jab and 
keep coming.

456
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,910
He's one of the few guys I've seen who 
has got that.

457
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,940
That's a good move.
He just always get the fuck away from 

458
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:40,940
punches,
man.

459
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,890
Did you see the hbo boxing this weekend 
that I'm donor fight?

460
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,140
No,
but did you see that bradley fight with 

461
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:52,120
bradley and he said a chick fight.
No one was.

462
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,300
You're not seeing the bradley.

463
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,900
I'm hopkins.
No,

464
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,500
no.
Who?

465
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Bradley.
What's that guy from siberia was the 

466
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:00,560
fight of the year.
I just recently.

467
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,970
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen
in my life together.

468
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,780
He fought in rocky three.
No,

469
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,180
this siberian guy fights out of freddy 
roach,

470
00:20:06,181 --> 00:20:09,630
his gym,
and it was the craziest thing.

471
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:10,560
It's the.
It's the.

472
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,240
It's the school.
I know.

473
00:20:12,241 --> 00:20:13,470
I know exactly what you're talking 
about.

474
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:16,470
Russia eyes were shut.
It was a crazy fight.

475
00:20:16,471 --> 00:20:21,471
Yeah.
Don't tell anybody what happens because 

476
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:21,471
it's so crazy.
Anyway,

477
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:23,880
it's the best part of it makes you 
people who have no respect for that,

478
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:28,881
like people who have never been beaten.
You don't have any idea like what those 

479
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:31,470
guys are sacrificing to try to entertain
people like it's the most.

480
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:36,471
It's the biggest,
the biggest sacrifice you could ever 

481
00:20:36,471 --> 00:20:36,480
make physically without dying.
It is.

482
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,300
And what's really interesting is some 
people have a genetic,

483
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:44,330
like an ability to take punches that,
that you as a human being should never 

484
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:44,970
be able to deal with.

485
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Like,
like even watching big country when he 

486
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,200
was taking those knees to the face.
Do you ever see that?

487
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,210
Then you call the fight.
Incredible.

488
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,320
Like how he can take that kind of 
punishment to his head as the nuttiest 

489
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,581
thing I've ever thought of it as it is 
mine to a lot of it is your 

490
00:20:59,581 --> 00:20:59,860
determination.
Does the physical building your face.

491
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:05,010
That's one big piece.
Mark hunt like that big fucking thick 

492
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:05,350
head.
That samoan hell.

493
00:21:05,351 --> 00:21:06,250
What'd you say?
The physical.

494
00:21:06,251 --> 00:21:08,500
What are your face?
Physical build of your face?

495
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,501
Construction.
It seems that guys with really thin 

496
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:16,630
faces like narrow jaws have more of an 
issue with getting knocked out.

497
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,810
Whereas big square jawed guys are 
fighting trainers look for.

498
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,840
They look for a short neck and a wide 
face that supposedly as the david to a 

499
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,420
perfect example,
one of the best chins of all time,

500
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,010
like lennox lewis cracked him on the jaw
and he just flopped,

501
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,480
sort of wobbles back and forth and keeps
moving forward.

502
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,290
And david had a ridiculous and its head 
is as wide as a football field.

503
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,730
I know his,
I know his,

504
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:42,920
uh,

505
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,360
I worked out with his strength coach for
and who got him ready for,

506
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:51,380
for his first fight.
And hIs strength coach said that david 

507
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,640
had never squatted and he put them on 
the squat rack.

508
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,730
we put four 90 on the squat rack and 
two,

509
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,930
uh,
went from.

510
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,030
I'm like,
he,

511
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,910
he,
he went from d,

512
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,380
took them wait 490 pounds and didn't do 
a regular squat.

513
00:22:05,381 --> 00:22:10,381
He did a deep squat.
He did an all the way down squat and 

514
00:22:10,381 --> 00:22:12,010
then came back up with no problem and he
was like,

515
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,080
you,
how much Do you practice squatting?

516
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:14,560
And two,
it was like,

517
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,130
I don't,
I don't practice squatting.

518
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,610
I'm just,
you know,

519
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,780
how much weight was that?
And he goes,

520
00:22:19,781 --> 00:22:21,850
that was 490 pounds with no belt or 
anything.

521
00:22:21,851 --> 00:22:26,851
You just put it on your body and went 
all the way down because you're not 

522
00:22:26,851 --> 00:22:29,521
supposed to go all the way down and you 
just have to go down to like where you 

523
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:29,521
put your button.

524
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:32,700
Shitty trainer is that guy.
Well why the fuck did you put too much 

525
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:32,750
weight on and why did he tell him how to
do it?

526
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:36,410
First trainer sounds like a douche bag.
That story sucks,

527
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,540
man.
Hey man,

528
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,790
about that man.
Henry,

529
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:43,010
let me retell it.
warmed them up.

530
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,900
It's.
It is definitely important.

531
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,460
You got to edit that one a little bit.
You know what?

532
00:22:46,461 --> 00:22:50,510
Squatting doesn't help with hunting when
you're out there trying to stalk a deer.

533
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,100
I see.
I disagree with you.

534
00:22:52,101 --> 00:22:54,290
I think all those bodyweight squats I 
do.

535
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,880
That totally helped me.
I don't hike.

536
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,410
No,
I know I never go hiking.

537
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,440
We were hiking for fucking hours.
I was like,

538
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,970
there's a couple points where I was 
like,

539
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:04,220
whoa.
Like I'm breathing really heavy.

540
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:05,740
Like,
this is a really taxing,

541
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:11,130
you know,
and someone who's in shitty shape and 

542
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:11,870
you try to do that badlands hiking all 
day.

543
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,360
You're,
that's not good for you.

544
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,660
When we had to have out all that meat.
Yeah.

545
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:19,310
Well it was a small thing.
I thought it was happy and I was like,

546
00:23:19,311 --> 00:23:22,460
I was concentrating peculiar.
It's like a,

547
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,080
like a peculiar

548
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,080
kind of in shape,
just like walking around on uneven 

549
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,600
ground.
Yeah.

550
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,710
Know I remember when I,
like I grew up in Michigan and you 

551
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,030
couldn't,
you couldn't find a good,

552
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,850
you couldn't find where you could,
where you needed to walk,

553
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:37,710
you know,
like a,

554
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:40,360
like a mile walk.
It'd be a big walk there.

555
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,850
And um,
we were,

556
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,910
you know,
we all consider ourselves pretty about 

557
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,590
that kind of stuff.
Like honing in Michigan and traffic and 

558
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,811
stuff.
When I moved out west and first started 

559
00:23:52,811 --> 00:23:53,900
hunting elk we would get,
were like,

560
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:58,901
we'd hike in,
we might hike in like eight or nine 

561
00:23:58,901 --> 00:23:59,810
miles somewhere to hunt and hanukkah 
days and come back out.

562
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:05,500
And then we get into,
in the truck and drive to a gas station,

563
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:08,300
you know.
And you go in to get like a fountain pop

564
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,320
and pop that soda for you.
So we're not living in the fountain,

565
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,730
the pot belly washer.

566
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So,
but by that point in time you'd pull up 

567
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,250
and open the door and couldn't get out 
of the vehicle.

568
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,050
Like just that 20 minute drive and like 
my legs would just seize up so bad that 

569
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:35,660
it would take days to recover from it.
Wow.

570
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,610
And then now I don't understand like,
no,

571
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:43,440
it just like doesn't have that.
Even if I didn't go and do that for a 

572
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,300
year,
maybe not a year.

573
00:24:44,301 --> 00:24:45,950
If I didn't go do that for six months or
something,

574
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:50,951
I feel like I would just be fine.
Do you want me to like something like 

575
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:54,970
goes away or comms or breaks or heels or
something from just like those long 

576
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:58,120
arduous hikes,
you know,

577
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,240
it

578
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:02,610
is incredibly adaptable.
I mean there's things that people do.

579
00:25:02,611 --> 00:25:07,611
If you go to a martial arts school and 
watch guys who have been doing jujitsu 

580
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,880
their whole lives and watch,
like how you can move your body around,

581
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:11,730
how you can manipulate your body.
The only way you could do that as if you

582
00:25:11,731 --> 00:25:16,731
just do it for years and years and years
and years and you're hiking up those 

583
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:21,290
crazy slippery slopes like all those 
places we hiked up were really slippery.

584
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,960
You know,
it takes like a specific kind of balance

585
00:25:24,961 --> 00:25:29,961
and a leg endurance when you're moving 
through muck and stuff and you're just.

586
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,460
It's a skill,
you know,

587
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,020
you're just really good at it.
Yeah.

588
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,970
You were barely getting tired.
It was crazy.

589
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,650
I was really impressed.
I was like,

590
00:25:37,651 --> 00:25:42,651
this guy is barely breathing heavy.
Like we get to the top and he's like 

591
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:42,651
glassing and I'm going,

592
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,760
he's barely breathing,
but at the same time,

593
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,110
keep in mind,
I live in fear of.

594
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,240
I'm catching a direct hit from a two 
year old.

595
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,590
He gets big time out for that and I'm 
like,

596
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:55,300
I'm kind of cover my face.
Like I can't take a hit from him.

597
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,170
He's 35 pounds.
That's a big one.

598
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:01,600
Take one was matchbox cars and you 
bought into deals me a blow to the cheek

599
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:05,160
or something like that.
It puts me out why kids can.

600
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,630
They can hit you hard.
They don't pull.

601
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,660
My daughter decided to take her healing 
to me.

602
00:26:10,661 --> 00:26:13,480
She went,
she jumped on me.

603
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:18,481
I was lying in bed.
She jumped on me and started riding and 

604
00:26:18,481 --> 00:26:20,851
she took her heel and my rib and I went 
crazy.

605
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:22,820
I was like,
how'd you get that much power,

606
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,060
that heel strike.
Do you teach them martial arts yet?

607
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,860
Not yet.
My son will definitely be learning.

608
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,950
Train tHem when the role in the four 
year old and two year old,

609
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,930
because they wrestle around together 
naturally,

610
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,270
so I trained them positions and I was 
like,

611
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:36,970
thIs is not what you want to stay.
If you're in this position when you want

612
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:37,700
to do you a to.

613
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,340
That's it's important to teach somebody 
how to do that.

614
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,380
Like my wife today,
honest,

615
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,910
honestly,
my wait like two hours ago,

616
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:49,911
my wife sent me a message on my phone 
asking if I thought that our little boy 

617
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:49,911
would

618
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:53,040
like a karate classes.
It's really good.

619
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,460
I never did anything like that.
A lot of hunting,

620
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,490
known a lot of physical things.
I think men need a lot of physical 

621
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,671
things.
I think the idea that a man that it's 

622
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:07,551
natural for man to have no explosive 
release physically for the rest of his 

623
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:13,251
life and just sit in a cubicle and just 
go through life with shiny shoes on the 

624
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:15,620
fucking tiMe your body's going to break.
There's This total.

625
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:19,350
That's a totally unnatural thing you're 
asking of it and if you don't,

626
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:24,351
you don't.
You have some sort of physical release 

627
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:24,351
or at least understand how to manage it.
You know,

628
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,500
you got to understand how to manage it.
Like managing it.

629
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,140
It's super important.
Well,

630
00:27:28,141 --> 00:27:33,141
it also,
it also hormonally for a man doing 

631
00:27:33,141 --> 00:27:34,590
exercise like that hormone changes 
hormonally when you don't,

632
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,900
when you don't exercise,
you lose it,

633
00:27:36,901 --> 00:27:37,140
man.

634
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,570
Yeah.
Oh no question.

635
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,930
No question.
Way healthier to actually lifting heavy 

636
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,450
is a good thing too.
We're talking about for little kids,

637
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,160
the little kids like learning,
like learning how to do difficult things

638
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:55,161
like early on.
So important because well think how 

639
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:59,631
normal it is for you to like sleep 
somewhere that's fucking cold as shit 

640
00:27:59,631 --> 00:27:59,660
with a sleeping bag and like,
all right,

641
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:01,560
well this is what we're doing.
Here we are.

642
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,510
You and moe curled up together in that 
van,

643
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,870
freezing your ass off that for,
for an average person,

644
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:11,871
that's like some walking dead type shit.
That scenario never comes up and if it 

645
00:28:11,971 --> 00:28:14,460
did that they would fall apart.
They wouldn't be able to deal with it.

646
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:16,080
They'd be complaining and whining.
I mean,

647
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,790
how many people would complain and 
whine?

648
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,250
Well steve,
you shed some light on this because I've

649
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:25,251
read accounts of where the settlers,
when they would move west and they'd 

650
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:29,591
come in contact with native americans,
it'd be a barely cold winter or 

651
00:28:29,591 --> 00:28:32,481
something and they would see like native
americans and children who's not not 

652
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:39,660
dressed warmly dressed in like,
you know,

653
00:28:39,661 --> 00:28:41,390
or,
or not warmly compared to west.

654
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,270
So they'd be,
it'd be like,

655
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,470
you know,
10 degrees out or something and they'd 

656
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,470
be in two skins and.
But,

657
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,730
but not nearly as bundled up as you 
would expect tHem to be.

658
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:51,850
Yeah,
I think that.

659
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,930
I think the people,
I think the people acclimate to that 

660
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,361
kind of stuff and you see your own minor
version of it just like the way you 

661
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,680
might behave throughout the winter.
Do you know what I mean?

662
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,100
Like you get,
you get just general,

663
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:09,130
you cost them to It to all of the year 
and then you see like mild variations 

664
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,970
where people who might grow up at 
northern latitudes moved down south.

665
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,760
They come back home and can't hack the 
cold,

666
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,060
you know,
I wonder what that is maybe.

667
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,470
And maybe your body naturally starts 
preparing for that are heating up.

668
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,360
So yeah,
make something shifts and then he looked

669
00:29:21,361 --> 00:29:23,900
like.
Even then if you look at cultures like,

670
00:29:23,901 --> 00:29:25,600
like,
like inuit cultures,

671
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,640
I mean just in that small amount of time
and that's not like a relatively.

672
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:34,641
that's not a very ancient,
that's not a very ancient people are 

673
00:29:34,641 --> 00:29:37,791
very ancient culture but they're fairly 
new arrivals in the arctic but they 

674
00:29:37,791 --> 00:29:41,901
already like demonstrate physical 
differences and physical adaptations 

675
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,870
that would help them adapt to the cold.

676
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,940
Like how much,
how much stuff you spread out,

677
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,090
like how much blood you send to your 
extremities and how well you can shut 

678
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,620
that off and control it either.
Another thing is there's this thing,

679
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:58,050
it's called the bergman principle a,
it's a principle in,

680
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,350
in while in while they physiology and 
the bergman principle holds that like if

681
00:30:02,351 --> 00:30:03,480
you have a species,
okay,

682
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,570
like let's take white tail deer in the 
southern extreme of that species range.

683
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,170
The Animals are going to be much smaller
than in the northern extreme.

684
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:16,240
So if you look at white tail deer from 
alberta,

685
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:21,241
they're just monsters up there.
He's the eyes to get lIke 280 pound 

686
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:21,790
deer,
whatever down in the southern extreme of

687
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:25,060
their range.
They might weigh 90 pounds and what they

688
00:30:25,061 --> 00:30:30,061
find is that a bigger,
like generally a bigger animal has less 

689
00:30:30,251 --> 00:30:35,251
surface area so that bigger animals 
better able to retain body heat in a 

690
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:38,710
smaller animal and a man will shape a 
smaller animal,

691
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:42,820
has a greater surface area and Is thus 
better able to shed heat.

692
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:45,040
So it comes down to hear shouting and 
heat retention.

693
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,990
And when you look at like human 
cultures,

694
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,370
wait,
so a smaller animal,

695
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,240
say again,
like a bigger animal.

696
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,410
If you have it,
let's say you have exactly the same 

697
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:58,410
shape dogs.
Okay?

698
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,090
But one of those dogs is 200 pounds and 
one of those dogs is 50 pounds,

699
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:05,470
right?
The larger dog has less surface area per

700
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:10,471
unit of mass and suicide in the smaller 
dog has greater surface area per unit of

701
00:31:10,541 --> 00:31:15,541
mass.
And so that's a way In which animals 

702
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:15,541
help,
you know,

703
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:18,930
shedding heat and keeping it.
And another thing you see in species 

704
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:19,060
like now that we look at the wooly 
mammoths,

705
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,710
the wooly mammoth,
that very small ears,

706
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:21,940
you know,
we think of elephants,

707
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:24,040
I haven't really.
Elephant tine giant ears,

708
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,480
the woolly mammoth.
It various small hears.

709
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,730
It was the arctic and subarctic 
inhabitant.

710
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,780
Then you look at like the african 
element in near ecuadorian zones,

711
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,960
big ears.
So it's like the ability to sheD heat 

712
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,730
to,
to send a bunch of blood into that big 

713
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,880
year and drop that heat on it.
What I'm saying is not just the body 

714
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,790
size thing,
but just like attributes,

715
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:44,050
long legs,
you know,

716
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:47,350
things that long legs would help you 
shed he squat legs,

717
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:49,750
he'll be retaining.
So when you look at human cultures,

718
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,840
like human cultures from ecuadorian 
areas in human cultures from arctic and 

719
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,591
subarctic areas will in some way 
demonstrate that same tendency of have 

720
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:01,960
that same physiology of being squat and 
compact,

721
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,720
being able to handle cold.
So I think that,

722
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,690
you know,
it doesn't take that long for.

723
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,840
I mean whatever your feelings are about 
like,

724
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:14,850
you know,
when I talk about evolution dies just 

725
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:14,850
like tangled up,
you know,

726
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,210
people think you're making some 
grandiose comment about religion or the 

727
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:18,210
or,
but I'm just going to like,

728
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,340
the things are different,
you know,

729
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:22,480
things look different where they come 
from and it doesn't end.

730
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,510
I think thAt it goes pretty quick.
And in species and humans and stuff 

731
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,130
making,
you know,

732
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:34,340
like acquiring adaptations that help 
them deal with climates.

733
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,390
And you talked about guys going out 
west.

734
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,520
I mean like settlers going west,
who is going to wind up thriving,

735
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:45,540
the guy,
they're gonna have to call the guy who 

736
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:45,540
can sleep out.
You know,

737
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:45,540
that's what I think like on an 
individual level.

738
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,220
I think so much of it comes down to I'm 
getting comfortable with discomfort and 

739
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,770
that was something I learned,
you know,

740
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,020
that was something I learned over a long
time of,

741
00:32:56,021 --> 00:32:59,610
of like hunting in the west and hunting 
Alaska was just kinda like the,

742
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,140
the mental attribute of getting 
comfortable with discomfort.

743
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,240
Yeah.
Well they,

744
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:05,350
they said that the seal teams,
uh,

745
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,720
they tried to figure out what prototype 
would do well in the,

746
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,380
you know,
a stocky guy or whatever.

747
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:12,600
A lot of guys are stuck here.
A lot of guys were wrestlers.

748
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,190
There are three sports they recruited 
from,

749
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,020
believe it or not,
a cross swimming,

750
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,050
a wrestling and one other football's on.
But,

751
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,120
but they couldn't actually,
they've never been able to really 

752
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,200
pinpoint who makes it and why.
And they certainly can't even do it 

753
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,460
physically.
Like some guys just defy the odds and 

754
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:31,460
they shouldn't do it,
but they do.

755
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,450
So there's no like,
well that guy has this,

756
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,200
this,
these,

757
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:39,530
these six qualities.
He's definitely gonna make it through 

758
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:39,530
buds.
No,

759
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,090
it's just a very difficult thing to 
pinpoint why would have been talking.

760
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:47,150
A cam cam just walked in.
We only have one extra mic here,

761
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,680
so you guys are going to have to close 
to each other and talk.

762
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,280
Are you,
uh,

763
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:50,800
you,
steve,

764
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,740
steve's friend.
You guys know each other?

765
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,260
We know eAch other a little bit.
I've gone on cam show a number of times.

766
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:01,650
Yeah.
Steven and I are both on sportsman 

767
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:01,650
channel.
I,

768
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:01,650
uh,
Do cameron company,

769
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:01,720
uh,
which is 5:00

770
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:06,721
eastern monday through friday.
A big fan of steve's and we've talked 

771
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:06,721
about.

772
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:11,370
So I thought I was confused.
I thought you guys were good buddies 

773
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:11,370
traveling together.
You're not traveling together.

774
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:14,740
Not traveling together.
I got to know my information suck.

775
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,510
I don't know where I'm getting a wire 
from.

776
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,770
Um,
so,

777
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,440
uh,
you are here to promote

778
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,210
here to promote,
uh,

779
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:28,211
uh,
your appearance on mediator and talk 

780
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:28,211
about the,
you know,

781
00:34:28,211 --> 00:34:28,880
the,
uh,

782
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,900
the mma week that we're developing for 
cam and comedy coming up last week in 

783
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,711
april.
We're goIng to be having steven on and 

784
00:34:37,711 --> 00:34:38,530
hopefully having you on.
Randy couture is gonna be joining us.

785
00:34:38,531 --> 00:34:39,970
We're going to talk about,
you know,

786
00:34:39,971 --> 00:34:40,380
the,
the,

787
00:34:40,381 --> 00:34:40,810
the,
the.

788
00:34:40,930 --> 00:34:45,930
I think a lot of the similarities in the
crossover between the mma world and the 

789
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:47,650
world of hunting,
um,

790
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,810
you know,
you talk about what,

791
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,540
what attributes it takes to,
you know,

792
00:34:52,541 --> 00:34:57,541
make it as a navy seal and he talked 
about what attributes it takes two to 

793
00:34:57,541 --> 00:34:58,380
make it as a hunter.
You know,

794
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,390
I think that there's all kinds of 
commonalities there when we talk about 

795
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,420
what it means to actually be better than
what we are and to grow ourselves,

796
00:35:07,421 --> 00:35:08,740
whether it's,
you know,

797
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:09,280
the,
the,

798
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,260
the,
putting yourself in that,

799
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:13,480
that state of discomfort,
um,

800
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,590
where,
you know,

801
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,090
a lot of people bug out.
I mean,

802
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:21,091
they don't want to do that anymore.
We live in a world in which our entire 

803
00:35:21,091 --> 00:35:22,900
existence is based on how comfortable 
can we be.

804
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,090
But you know,
again,

805
00:35:25,091 --> 00:35:30,091
you don't,
you don't become better unless you're 

806
00:35:30,091 --> 00:35:30,190
pushing yourself unless you're,
you're breaking out of that comfort.

807
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:35,730
Yeah.
It's a sad thing to see a whole 

808
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,050
generation of kids growing up that don't
experience that as young men.

809
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,780
They don't hAve difficult tasks to 
perform.

810
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,110
And I think that's a critical aspect of 
like your,

811
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,040
your behavior and your character and 
growing your character.

812
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,540
You gotta fail,
you gotta,

813
00:35:48,541 --> 00:35:53,541
you gotta be pushed.
You got to get to a situation where you 

814
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:56,610
pass your limits.
Are you surprised yourself with new 

815
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:56,850
limits and you changed your own 
definition of yourself.

816
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:00,900
But if you don't test yourself,
if you don't get into bad positions,

817
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,090
you're always gonna have that weird 
insecurity about yet.

818
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:06,720
Like that weird insecurity that guys 
have that have never been in any kind of

819
00:36:06,721 --> 00:36:08,400
conflict ever.
And you know,

820
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,460
know how they would react.
There are certain people I know exactly 

821
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,070
how they would react if the shit hits 
the fan,

822
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,310
but those other people.

823
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:15,840
But like,
ah,

824
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,690
you squirly bitch,
she might fall apart on me.

825
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,730
Like you always say to,
you know,

826
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,970
if you're,
if you are,

827
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,710
if you're trying to be really good at 
anything,

828
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,160
you can find all those.
Although you can find all that 

829
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,131
discomfort and all those plateaus and 
everything just in trying to get great 

830
00:36:31,131 --> 00:36:34,440
at the guitar or whatever it is,
there's a certain amount of humility and

831
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:39,610
an understanding of what's really going 
on that you develop when you sort of 

832
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,970
make any strides in any really difficult
thing or if it's playing chess,

833
00:36:41,971 --> 00:36:42,660
whether it's,
you know,

834
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,640
whether it's writing know whatever it 
is.

835
00:36:44,641 --> 00:36:49,641
It's,
it's a matter of doing something 

836
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:49,641
difficult and testing your boundaries

837
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:52,680
time all that time.
All that came more naturally.

838
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:57,510
I think if you just look at the way 
people's lives used to be structured,

839
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:00,030
you know,
in even just,

840
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,220
you know,
not even 100 years ago or so.

841
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,840
It wasn't like we Had to manufacturer 
opportunities for stress.

842
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,870
I mean it was just like you had things 
you had to do,

843
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:11,770
like you had to clear land or,
or,

844
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,050
or people would actually have children 
because they needed the additional re.

845
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,480
They didn't look at children as being a,
a deficit.

846
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,990
They looked at children as being like an
addition of resource resource to have 

847
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,660
kids because they'll help me do more 
work.

848
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,750
I'll have kids so that I can pump money 
into them and pump resources into them.

849
00:37:29,751 --> 00:37:34,230
I'll derive from them and now I find I 
certainly don't live that way now.

850
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:39,231
I find that I manufacturer,
I try to like in small dosages 

851
00:37:39,231 --> 00:37:43,731
manufactured that feeling for my kid to,
to like give him this.

852
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:50,360
He doesn't see it as artificial,
but given this artificial sense of him 

853
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,841
having to have output that I'm doing 
something and maybe I'm doing something 

854
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:58,761
completely unnecessary,
like he wants to make a birdhouse so 

855
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:01,691
we're going to make a birdhouse,
but at a point it becomes just like 

856
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:01,691
arduous,
you know,

857
00:38:01,691 --> 00:38:05,631
there's a part where the fun dies and 
now we just got to get it finished and 

858
00:38:06,211 --> 00:38:07,260
to make it and to turn it in.
LIke,

859
00:38:07,261 --> 00:38:07,860
no,
we're doing this,

860
00:38:07,861 --> 00:38:08,730
we're doing this,
we're doing this.

861
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
And it's like,
and I don't care if it's enjoyable to 

862
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,000
him anymore and he's so little.
This is all just like experiment now.

863
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,970
We're just trying to like create that 
sense of that you have to now in some 

864
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,070
way do something you don't want to do.
Yes.

865
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,590
That is his is.

866
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,530
That's part of life practice,
right?

867
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,290
It's a part of that,
you know,

868
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,590
you get,
you start getting good at soMething and 

869
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:34,590
just,
you know,

870
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:34,590
if you're Trying to be a good wrestler,
whatever.

871
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,290
There are days you walk in and you're 
like,

872
00:38:35,291 --> 00:38:36,940
I don't want to wrestle.
I don't want to do anY of this.

873
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:39,340
I don't even care about this anymore.
It's all a bore.

874
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,440
I don't like that guy.
I don't like that guy.

875
00:38:41,441 --> 00:38:45,850
I don't like any of this and you.
It's like getting into a cold bath until

876
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:47,310
your skin gets acclimated.
You know?

877
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:47,870
That's,
that's,

878
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:53,040
that's a huge part.
It was like didn't really interesting 

879
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,050
thing that where they put it,
get comfortable with discomfort.

880
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,320
I don't think you can get good at 
anything unless you,

881
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,850
you'd get you,
you get comfortable with this because 

882
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:01,850
one of the things about wrestlers that 
separates them from,

883
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,810
in my opinion than almost every other 
athlete wrestlers go through such 

884
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,310
horrendous stress throughout high school
between sucking wade and the training 

885
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:17,970
rustling is the most brutal fucking 
training you can do and then you're 

886
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,880
doing strength and conditioning or hill 
sprints,

887
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,170
whatever kind of crazy.

888
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,370
You know,
weight lifted program,

889
00:39:21,371 --> 00:39:24,730
they have you on your,
you are broken down all day,

890
00:39:24,731 --> 00:39:28,000
falling asleep in class,
you're dehydrated,

891
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:30,340
you're sucking way,
you're eating fucking Turkey,

892
00:39:30,341 --> 00:39:32,880
breast and lettuce with lemon juice on 
it like you,

893
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,950
you're essentially starving while your 
lifestyle.

894
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,180
And these guYs,
they developed this unbelievable ability

895
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:45,181
to just grind through shit and they 
break a lot of fighters just with their 

896
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:47,070
sheer will because of that,
that,

897
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:50,320
that the mentality that comes with being
a successful wrestler.

898
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:51,070
It's like,
well,

899
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:51,680
I'm doing,
you know,

900
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:54,720
tomorrow I'm having ronda rousey on the 
brian callen show.

901
00:39:54,721 --> 00:39:58,270
Everybody and sorry to push my podcast.
But um,

902
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:58,960
she,
um,

903
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:03,961
I look forward to.
I think I changed the name of that 

904
00:40:03,961 --> 00:40:04,370
stupid thing from man thoughts.
A lot of people want man thoughts back.

905
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,910
He used to be called man thoughts and 
then joe was like,

906
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,080
come on dude,
just have it.

907
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,130
The brian counter.
I was like,

908
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,290
all right,
I'm changing it back to the brian 

909
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:14,290
calender.
Everybody.

910
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:14,290
Men thoughts.
It's not,

911
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:14,530
it's not.
You know,

912
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,050
people look for the brian cowen 
podcasts,

913
00:40:17,051 --> 00:40:19,910
they're not going to google manto.
Exactly.

914
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,380
There's a little disconnect there with 
people finding it.

915
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,630
It was an idea to but can't do any on so
bad labeling.

916
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,650
It was the first modern rousey ronda 
rousey because the ufc champion and I'm 

917
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,120
out.
The point is I'm making is that I think 

918
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:35,120
part of what makes her so great.
She was an olympian in judo,

919
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:39,840
which is so difficult.
That same kind of training and when you 

920
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,950
get into you get into the octagon with 
ronda rousey man.

921
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,420
She's been through the muck.
She and I,

922
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:45,640
and that's what I'm going to talk to her
about.

923
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:47,620
What her.
She's an extreme winter,

924
00:40:47,621 --> 00:40:49,150
you know,
and I want to talk to her about how,

925
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:51,850
what her mindset is,
how she keeps that going,

926
00:40:51,851 --> 00:40:56,851
how she deals with the pressure,
how she deals with her mother developed 

927
00:40:56,851 --> 00:41:00,031
her,
her mother's a judo champion as well as 

928
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:00,240
her mother taught her to be a total 
badass.

929
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:02,220
You know,
so she said in an interview,

930
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,250
rhonda said,
and I'm gonna talk about this is when 

931
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:07,840
something bad happens to her.
She immediAtely says,

932
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,610
wow,
I wonder.

933
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:11,530
I wonder what i'M going to get out of 
this.

934
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,280
You know,
I wonder,

935
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,680
oh,
This is good.

936
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,260
This is the socks right now,
but I wonder what good is gonna come out

937
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:19,180
of this because something goods is 
getting something good.

938
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:24,181
I'm going to react in a good way of my 
reaction is going to create something 

939
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:28,441
positive in this atmosphere.
That's a great way of looking at any 

940
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:29,020
kind of adversity.
Sure.

941
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:31,060
Until you get kicked in the head.
Well that's true,

942
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,160
and then you go,
okay,

943
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,000
ain't that the truth?
That's the ultimate equalizer man scene.

944
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:38,960
He used to say,
who was that for your younger listeners?

945
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:41,600
He was a world champion boxer and ray 
man,

946
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,670
me and he said,
my father always said,

947
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,550
you're a tough guy.
Telia not bottom line.

948
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,600
Somebody hits you in the face.
You're not a tough guy anymore.

949
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:57,420
Age doesn't start to get to an age where
your references don't work anymore.

950
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,620
I was like,
how olD are you?

951
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:07,910
Does it seem that like,
I'll like make something about mary lou 

952
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,641
retton,
which in my mind was like the only 

953
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:10,710
athlete I knew about because she was in 
special k box.

954
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:13,920
Jumping around

955
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,610
about how about when bruce jenner used 
to be the wheaties guy,

956
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,570
not some freak on a fucking reality show
about that.

957
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:23,980
How about when bruce jenner had or had a
man knows?

958
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,880
How about when bruce jenner was a man?
What's going on when you,

959
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:32,881
when you become like this,
this guy who's on this reality show and 

960
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:37,261
all your your daughter upturned nose,
all in the news and everyone's mad.

961
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,510
They're all crazy.
They're completely crazy and it used to 

962
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:42,510
be a champion.
He was,

963
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:47,540
he was one of the best in the world.
He was a gold metal and handsome and 

964
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:51,310
then decides he's going to go and get 
his nose done.

965
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:56,100
Try to flash forward 20 years into the 
future and find out,

966
00:42:56,101 --> 00:42:56,990
you know,
like think okay,

967
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:02,060
what celebrity that I know now who's 
normal is going to be that fucked up 20 

968
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:02,060
years from

969
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:05,490
no too easy to make fun of the ones that
are fucked up right now.

970
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,040
I'm not really into fucking the stock 
market of celebrity douche this.

971
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,180
I'm looking for them to be fucked up 
right away.

972
00:43:12,181 --> 00:43:17,181
I mean there's always something that you
picture like if someone just rubs you 

973
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:21,231
the wrong way for whatever reasons,
one to fantasize turns that could 

974
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:21,231
happen.
Right?

975
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,680
You know what?
What'S really fun is when,

976
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,640
what you don't like

977
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:28,990
and that actually happens and you get to
watch even watch them fucking skid and 

978
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,100
hit the and older you can kinda,
you can kinda get.

979
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,360
You get really good at figuring out.
You look at Some celebrities and you go,

980
00:43:35,361 --> 00:43:37,400
oh,
there's a lot of flash noise there,

981
00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:39,230
but you're not drawing from much 
brother.

982
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,990
You're working with one bag of tricks 
and that's getting empty.

983
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,660
I can watch it again and you're like,
you've got to come up with something.

984
00:43:44,661 --> 00:43:49,661
But you.
a lot of times you'll see that it's a 

985
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,131
very disappointing thing when you 
realize that there's all these really 

986
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:52,590
douchey people that on camera and they 
have the,

987
00:43:52,591 --> 00:43:57,591
like the sort of like artificial active 
they put on and then they'll do films 

988
00:43:57,981 --> 00:44:02,981
where they really,
really good at pretending to be someone 

989
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:02,981
else.
So they do that and then you know,

990
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:03,950
you get to meet them and you see them in
the elect.

991
00:44:03,951 --> 00:44:06,410
This guy is a douche bag,
like a straight,

992
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:10,660
a great a douche bag and a boar.
Yeah.

993
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:15,670
Boring,
crazy psychopath who's just all about 

994
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:16,550
themselves.
Pathologically self-involved.

995
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,890
I know a movie star like that.
It's just I,

996
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,230
you know.
And you grew up watching him with it,

997
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,050
ya know,
and you get.

998
00:44:24,051 --> 00:44:25,160
And I got snowmen.
I was like,

999
00:44:25,161 --> 00:44:28,640
you are an absolute cuckoo bird.
You are all about yourself.

1000
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:31,450
Never asked me a question about my.
I for many,

1001
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,010
never asked

1002
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,010
me one question about myself.
Not one question I didn't even.

1003
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:35,760
how you doing?
Never another a question.

1004
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:37,350
No interest.
It's all about him.

1005
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,420
He's truly the center of his own 
university.

1006
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,540
I had a buddy that I had to cut off 
because I could never just have a,

1007
00:44:44,541 --> 00:44:45,590
hey,
what's going on man?

1008
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,600
I couldn't have that.
I couldn't say no,

1009
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:48,850
no,
no,

1010
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:49,280
no,
no.

1011
00:44:49,281 --> 00:44:50,900
Because when you would say,
hey,

1012
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:54,140
what's going on man?
He would just go into his career.

1013
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:55,880
I know this.
I mean,

1014
00:44:55,881 --> 00:45:00,881
it was like a fucking five minute 
diatribe on how well this audition when 

1015
00:45:00,881 --> 00:45:02,570
and he's pretty sure he's gonna be back 
for a,

1016
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:06,680
a second pass at that and I think once I
can get in front of producers,

1017
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:08,880
I can show them what I could really do.
I know what you're talking about too.

1018
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,750
It can it.
Can I interrupt you long enough?

1019
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:13,150
Just the briAn,
how's your family and

1020
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,400
dude,
I can't believe he wants to make sure 

1021
00:45:20,711 --> 00:45:24,670
he's off.
Steve are now.

1022
00:45:24,671 --> 00:45:25,930
You will never be on that list.

1023
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:27,860
Yeah,
you can do your,

1024
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,720
you can do no wrong when we're talking 
can.

1025
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,290
before you got here,
we were talking about how it seems like,

1026
00:45:32,291 --> 00:45:33,520
um,
you know,

1027
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:38,521
brian and steve and I are a.
Because we went on this crazy trip 

1028
00:45:38,591 --> 00:45:42,250
together because we went to Montana.
We have this weird blood brothers shit,

1029
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,670
blood brotherhood ship thing going on 
it.

1030
00:45:45,671 --> 00:45:47,650
So he felt that way when I was watching 
the episodes.

1031
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:50,600
I was like,
damn,

1032
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,210
I miss those guys like Ryan Ryan

1033
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:00,670
for five days.
We had a great fucking time with no tv,

1034
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:03,270
no cell phone.
We're all asleep right?

1035
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,040
Remember that didn't,
I mean we slept like rocks.

1036
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,350
We slept when the lights went out.
Basically we ate,

1037
00:46:08,351 --> 00:46:10,240
slept and.
But getting up,

1038
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,050
it didn't seem that hard.
it was.

1039
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,860
It was really.
It was probably because we were going to

1040
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:15,910
bed at eight and wake up.

1041
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,070
Yeah.
I did get about 14 hours of sleep.

1042
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,130
I didn't even need a nap.
I'm rugged.

1043
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:22,720
It was hard

1044
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:27,740
to figure out how to sleep at first,
but I realized eventually that the 

1045
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:30,120
softest way to do it is to keep your,
your not just your sleeping bag,

1046
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:32,430
but your jacket on as well.
Let me get all my clothes,

1047
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:37,290
all my clothes on my jacket and my 
sleeping bag and the down jacket and the

1048
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,300
sleeping bag was like,
this is just enough.

1049
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,250
Let me tell you something.
the next time we go hunting,

1050
00:46:41,251 --> 00:46:46,251
I'm bringing a sherpa and guess what?
He's going to carry a big fucking 

1051
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:46,251
mattress on it.

1052
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:46,700
Back.
Portable Heater.

1053
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:51,790
And fuck you guys by the portable.
I want to fucking matches with a big 

1054
00:46:52,431 --> 00:46:57,431
pillow.
Remember we passed that one will lose 

1055
00:46:57,431 --> 00:46:57,431
something though,
man.

1056
00:46:57,431 --> 00:47:00,760
Whatever.
What dId we just talked about?

1057
00:47:00,850 --> 00:47:01,260
Oh,
sorry.

1058
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:01,600
Sorry,

1059
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:07,130
he's a famous quote,
I can't remember who said like,

1060
00:47:07,131 --> 00:47:08,990
you don't really know a man,
you know,

1061
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,210
100,
100 with them.

1062
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:12,380
I wish I forget that.
I don't know the guy,

1063
00:47:12,381 --> 00:47:15,440
I don't know what he said or who said it
was really destroys my point.

1064
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:18,900
But broadly I was and say is it,
there's like a.

1065
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,340
I was talking to one time with the older
friend of mine,

1066
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:27,341
he was talking about being at his 
fishing camp and he was trying to 

1067
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:29,921
describe why he likes to be known as 
fishing camp with his buddies now is 

1068
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,150
fish held and Alaska and he's like,
everyone's just so,

1069
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,630
so competent,
you know,

1070
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:38,470
and it wound up being like that.
He just kind of appreciated that.

1071
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:43,471
Like hanging out with people who like 
have the ability to just to take care of

1072
00:47:43,481 --> 00:47:46,180
things,
like to do things.

1073
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:51,181
And he was saying like,
you gotta wait in line if you want to 

1074
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:51,181
wash a dish,
you know,

1075
00:47:51,181 --> 00:47:51,340
with this crew of people who's out with.

1076
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,200
And I think that in ways,
none of this thing,

1077
00:47:53,201 --> 00:47:54,420
this is exclusive to hunting.
I mean,

1078
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:55,120
I,
there was many things,

1079
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,070
but it's like going on a trip,
you know,

1080
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,430
going on a trip with people where things
aren't so great all the time.

1081
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:05,431
LIke there's,
there's elements of being cold was 

1082
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:07,381
elements of having not slept enough,
but it's kind of having this feeling of 

1083
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:08,580
um,
everything's gonna be okay.

1084
00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:13,590
like these guys are like great people to
be with and they're just really 

1085
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,830
competent people and right now we're 
doing those behind like we're doing like

1086
00:48:14,831 --> 00:48:19,831
this little crew show on like the media.
It was just on the one that's coming up 

1087
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:22,150
or kind of about the guys I work with.
And when I watched it I kind of see that

1088
00:48:22,151 --> 00:48:27,151
where I just feel.
So I'm like comfortable being around 

1089
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:28,840
people that I've spent a lot of time out
hunting with.

1090
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:29,620
And again,
I don't want to make.

1091
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,230
I tHink that sports teams feel something
similar.

1092
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:37,550
You know,
I think there's guys served together in 

1093
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:37,690
the military,
but it just kind of a way of,

1094
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:42,691
uh,
being away from things and sort of 

1095
00:48:42,691 --> 00:48:43,600
relying on other structures,
you know,

1096
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:48,870
relyIng on other things and not having 
assumptions about people holding their 

1097
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:49,420
weight or if you could complain,
make it funny.

1098
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:49,880
Yeah,

1099
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,550
that's right.
That's right.

1100
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:56,670
You know that when I went spent 11 days 
in Afghanistan doing the uso tour and 

1101
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:57,450
one of the things I came away with was 
I,

1102
00:48:57,730 --> 00:48:59,350
I realized I went,
you know,

1103
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:04,351
I've been in la for a long time where 
I'm the center of my own universe and 

1104
00:49:04,351 --> 00:49:04,351
everybody around me is always about 
them.

1105
00:49:04,351 --> 00:49:07,450
And one of the thingS i founD very 
refreshing about being in a war zone,

1106
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:09,290
if there is such a thing as being 
professional,

1107
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:12,340
is that when you're in the military,
you're a marine,

1108
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:14,080
you're an army guy,
you come last,

1109
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,930
those guys put themselves last and 
everybody around them comes first.

1110
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:20,170
So when you get off a bus and you're 
unloading bags,

1111
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:23,770
there's always a line of people 
unloading everybody else's bags.

1112
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,040
Everybody's looking out for the other 
guy next to him.

1113
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:30,380
and that's that ethos that is,
that is quito in,

1114
00:49:30,381 --> 00:49:31,550
in the military,
that's,

1115
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,740
that's drummed in you.

1116
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,320
And I got to say that having come from 
la,

1117
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:38,110
which was the exact opposite of being 
thrown into that experience,

1118
00:49:38,111 --> 00:49:39,460
was very,
very kind of.

1119
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:42,070
It was really.
I didn't expect it.

1120
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:44,410
It was just one of the most ridiculous 
places to live in the world.

1121
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:49,490
If you wanna,
if you want to find like actual real 

1122
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,200
humans to talk to,
real,

1123
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,400
real,
authentic.

1124
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:54,310
It's true authenticity and loss and with
men and women,

1125
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,460
it's like it's,
it's such a brutal grind to try to find 

1126
00:49:59,460 --> 00:49:59,460
people that are your friends.
So you can talk to.

1127
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,100
I've cultivated a group over the years 
and I'm.

1128
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:07,230
One of the things about,
about doing your show is that I knew 

1129
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:08,050
that if I was going to do it and I 
brought this motherfucker around,

1130
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,450
I'm like,
will change the whole tone of the show.

1131
00:50:10,451 --> 00:50:12,520
Like this show is just going to be a 
five day silly,

1132
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:12,970
fast.

1133
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,940
This is the perfect thing to do.
Because.

1134
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:19,540
And also I knew that brian cowen holds 
up a new.

1135
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:24,541
No matter what happened,
they fucking asteroids can become and 

1136
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:24,541
that we'd be looking at each other.
Well pal,

1137
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:28,861
it's been a good time,
but I don't see us survive in that 

1138
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:28,861
fucking thing.
I'm always ready to go out with a bang.

1139
00:50:28,861 --> 00:50:33,730
I will.
I will stand by your side no matter 

1140
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:33,730
what.
That's how I think of friendship.

1141
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,000
He's my four in the morning.
I got a body to get rid of guy.

1142
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:38,500
Yeah,
it's true.

1143
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,940
If I had,
if I had a guy that I had to call up and

1144
00:50:40,941 --> 00:50:41,540
go,
dude,

1145
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,210
I'm meet me.
I would take her risk for you.

1146
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:47,290
Tell me in your parking lot.
You know I.

1147
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:49,520
I take that very seriously.
My real friends,

1148
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:50,510
my real friends.
I always said,

1149
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:53,480
I'll take a risk for you to take a risk 
for her to show that hurts my feelings.

1150
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,900
You.
Oh,

1151
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:54,770
you too,
sweetie.

1152
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,840
I totally carry more.
Yeah,

1153
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:02,140
he can carry your body now.
You might get uncomfortable walking 

1154
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:02,140
through the desert.
I also got holes.

1155
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:03,470
I got holes.
I got holes in stores.

1156
00:51:03,471 --> 00:51:05,950
I've live where I will have to stop for 
cigarette breaks,

1157
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,790
but the evidence away,
but you're not just looking for someone 

1158
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:11,870
who'd be cool with the fact that you had
a body.

1159
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,520
Right.
It'd be someone who'd be.

1160
00:51:13,610 --> 00:51:15,440
Who'd be helpful in getting.
Oh yeah,

1161
00:51:15,441 --> 00:51:18,560
I know exactly how to get rid of it.
You've got to go into mission mode.

1162
00:51:18,561 --> 00:51:21,500
You got to get rid of that fucking body 
because that's the way it is.

1163
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:25,940
We know that fossil either.
It's like it's like jimmy burke's friend

1164
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,780
who is his.
His car.

1165
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,920
He comes home.
His girlfriend is having a fight with 

1166
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:33,800
her boyfriend.
My boyfriend is hitting his daughter.

1167
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,030
He comes home and his daughters in a 
fight with her boyfriend in the backyard

1168
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,900
and the boyfriend's starts hitting her.

1169
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:41,060
He comes out and he's a construction 
worker.

1170
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:43,160
He comes back here.
Can you back up one step?

1171
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,120
So,
so yeah.

1172
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:45,980
So not that.
Oh,

1173
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,180
I don't understand the story.
Okay.

1174
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:49,760
So the story is my buddy,
my buddies,

1175
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,020
my buddy,
my buddy.

1176
00:51:51,021 --> 00:51:52,370
Your body.
Is it your buddy?

1177
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:56,340
My buddy grows up.
It grows up with a guy named uh,

1178
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,270
can't fuck with his name.
Is he comes home,

1179
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:04,290
he comes home,
his daughter is in the backyard with a 

1180
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:04,340
boyfriend and they're fighting.
They're having a fight.

1181
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,920
Boyfriends starts hitting his daughter.
He goes out in the backyard and tries to

1182
00:52:11,691 --> 00:52:12,830
break it up.
The boyfriend,

1183
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,160
I guess get smart with them.
He kills the boyfriend with his bare 

1184
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:18,230
hands.
He fucking kills him.

1185
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,370
He punches him to death.
Now he says to his daughter,

1186
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:24,200
go inside and he's got to get rid of the
body.

1187
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:29,620
So he calls his buddy guy,
you should you be telling a story and 

1188
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:29,620
it's fine.

1189
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:29,620
It's fine.
People in jail.

1190
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,790
Yeah,
so.

1191
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,710
So he,
he,

1192
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,910
and this was a long time ago,
so he calls his huge friend.

1193
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:38,660
Bozo.
Bozo was not called breaker.

1194
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,270
Who his claim to fame was.
He had the longest tongue on the,

1195
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:46,271
on the planet.
He was sticking his tongue out and you 

1196
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:46,271
go,
jesus christ like that.

1197
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:46,271
He'd scare people with his fucking 
tongue.

1198
00:52:46,271 --> 00:52:47,750
That was the size of a cow's.
Anyway,

1199
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,940
bose was a giant men.
Bozos shows up.

1200
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:53,030
Bozo goes,
I know we're going to do calm down.

1201
00:52:53,031 --> 00:52:53,450
He goes,
well,

1202
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,370
he goes,
I'll be right back.

1203
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:58,460
Bozo goes and gets a dolly.
He takes the dolly,

1204
00:52:58,461 --> 00:53:02,510
he ties the guy to the dolly.
They fucking in the middle of the night,

1205
00:53:02,511 --> 00:53:07,511
they take this guy,
they dolly him to a gas station around 

1206
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:09,110
the corner and they leave and behind the
gas station.

1207
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:10,430
Oops,
get dropped something.

1208
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,440
Then they come running back like we did 
it.

1209
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,850
Good job buddy.
Plugged brothers.

1210
00:53:13,851 --> 00:53:15,800
I got to get rid of a body.
Well,

1211
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:18,680
here's what they didn't think because 
they were a little drunk to calm down.

1212
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,500
Oh,
the guy's hand had dragged,

1213
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,100
dragged along the ground.
So when the cops showed up,

1214
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:28,560
they brought the dogs and the dogs went,
oh,

1215
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:34,550
well let's just follow where the dogs go
in and they just went around the corner 

1216
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,700
and found themselves little house and 
started barking costs like knock,

1217
00:53:38,701 --> 00:53:39,180
knock,
knock.

1218
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,440
Hey you guys a dolly,
a body around the fucking thing.

1219
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,200
Sorry we did.
You're going to jail and so are fucking 

1220
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,200
you.
Pounce.

1221
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,860
And they.
They did some time.

1222
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,580
Not that they didn't do 25 to life.
They did some fucking.

1223
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:57,310
So your point is you don't want any old 
dude getting rid of a body.

1224
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:00,300
You've got to have a plan through this 
shit beforehand.

1225
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:01,340
Yeah.

1226
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:03,000
You got to think through the better.
Rehearsed this shit.

1227
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,970
And you got to get his body up before it
stinks.

1228
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,930
Support tech blenders guys.
Yeah.

1229
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:14,090
Yeah.
One blender at a time when there was 

1230
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:14,270
that guy that fed the body through a,
uh,

1231
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:18,090
I guess he had a hog farm and fed the 
body first through a tree shredder,

1232
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:21,270
shot all the,
all of it into the hog thing.

1233
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:25,450
And the hogs hate it,
but they still let you know.

1234
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,150
This reminds me that link,
like joe said,

1235
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,610
you sent me a link reasonably.
You like the great cannibals of the wild

1236
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:35,611
west,
the great cannibals of the west with 

1237
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:35,611
wild shit,
isn't it?

1238
00:54:35,611 --> 00:54:39,220
What's that like?
The donner party similar,

1239
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,460
similar,
but one of them was a guy who,

1240
00:54:41,461 --> 00:54:43,770
uh,
his wife got killed by the cherokee.

1241
00:54:43,771 --> 00:54:48,771
So he went on a rampage,
is killed a bunch of indians and ate 

1242
00:54:48,771 --> 00:54:48,810
their liver and they called them liver 
eating.

1243
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:49,780
Johnson,
johnson.

1244
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:52,090
He just,
he would kill guys and eat their liver.

1245
00:54:52,110 --> 00:54:57,110
So that was the sydney pollack.
That's a serial killer who fantasize 

1246
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:57,110
about that his whole life.
He's like,

1247
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:59,190
they killed my wife before I could eat 
her liver.

1248
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,200
He later became the sheriff.
He later became the sheriff of red.

1249
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,740
Is it red lodge on something?
Some,

1250
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,650
some.
He was,

1251
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,780
yeah,
he was a sheriff in red lodge and then a

1252
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,410
sydney pollack made that movie.
Great movie.

1253
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:19,411
Jeremiah johnson and jeremiah johnson 
was based loosely off of the legend of,

1254
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:24,710
of liver eating johnson.
And it was one of liberty johnson liver 

1255
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:25,660
eating.
Johnson used to cut firewood,

1256
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,480
um,
for the,

1257
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,010
for the boats on the Missouri breaks.
Wow.

1258
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:35,070
Where we did our float.
Holy shit brings this whole deal way 

1259
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,750
full circle in a weird way.
Yeah.

1260
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,020
I had an eight inch tongue.

1261
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:46,720
Your stories man about the old west were
so great.

1262
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:47,460
You know,
you,

1263
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:49,990
you know,
so many cool fucking stories.

1264
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:54,991
Like when we were like brian,
when we got back when we were on the 

1265
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:54,991
boat and you were like,
oh my god,

1266
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:58,980
that's the last day of being on the 
water was so fucking cold.

1267
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,000
My god,
I didn't even notice because steve kept 

1268
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,541
telling me all these cool ass fucking 
indian stories about how this guy got 

1269
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:09,880
away and this guy hitting a beaver's dan
and this guy,

1270
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:12,940
they told him he could run naked.
You can try to get away if you can,

1271
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:17,080
if you can run away,
and so I was so frozen and I saw you and

1272
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:22,110
it was so cold that you had like there 
were icicles out of your beard and you 

1273
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:22,110
were just smiling the whole time.
I was like,

1274
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:23,080
how is he not cold?
Right.

1275
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,040
So you did your

1276
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,210
job,
you distract them.

1277
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:26,560
I was enjoying myself,
man.

1278
00:56:26,561 --> 00:56:31,561
I never bothered.
I mean knowing that the cold was only 

1279
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:31,561
like a five day thing.
I was like,

1280
00:56:31,561 --> 00:56:36,361
as long as it's only a five day thing 
and when we were walking around in the 

1281
00:56:36,361 --> 00:56:36,361
day,
it wasn't bad.

1282
00:56:36,361 --> 00:56:38,020
As long as you have gloves on,
even if you're.

1283
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:40,120
If you're done upright,
if you're wearing the right shit,

1284
00:56:40,121 --> 00:56:42,230
it's not a bad deal.
It's.

1285
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:43,130
The thing is,
it's like a,

1286
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:48,150
it's like a paradox almost where when 
you get uncomfortable and cold like 

1287
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:50,690
that,
some part he wants you to stand there,

1288
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,440
you know,
but the only time you're actually 

1289
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,440
comfortable is when you're out screwing 
around.

1290
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:00,780
YeAh.
You got to move around as soon as you 

1291
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:00,780
start moving around,
but there's something intimate.

1292
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,530
You stop,
something comes something and habits you

1293
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:05,110
in and makes you want to just like stand
there,

1294
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,580
be cold and it's like the guys that are 
good about it are the guys that just,

1295
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,620
you look and instead of hanging around 
and talk and there was like walking up 

1296
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:14,590
and down a little hill and they're 
totally fine.

1297
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,660
Well,
it's weird how comfortable we got sweaty

1298
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,900
even though it's like nine degrees out,
you know?

1299
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,580
There's a lot of times we're fucking 
sweaty,

1300
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:23,780
moving around a lot.
That's why kills,

1301
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,270
right.
You know,

1302
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,960
when you get sweat needs,
you've got to have wool.

1303
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,260
The opposite of that is,
are you familiar with paradoxical 

1304
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:31,530
paradoxical undressing?
It's like when people,

1305
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:36,420
a free fine hypothermia like victims 
will hypothermia that they'll.

1306
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:41,450
They'll often have often shed their 
clothes but an erratic ways taking 

1307
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:45,210
jewelry off.
I'm taking one sock off,

1308
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,900
but there's this thing that happens 
where you spend like your body.

1309
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:51,540
When you start getting cold,
your body spends a lot of energy.

1310
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:57,870
It constricts certain blood vessels and 
stops the flow of blood out to your 

1311
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:01,060
extremities,
to the tip of your nose.

1312
00:58:01,061 --> 00:58:06,061
You know when you get cold,
like tip of your nose will get kind of 

1313
00:58:06,061 --> 00:58:06,061
numb in white is your fingers get that 
way,

1314
00:58:06,061 --> 00:58:09,720
like your body's working really hard to 
to stave off the heat loss so it doesn't

1315
00:58:09,721 --> 00:58:12,270
want to send as much blood out to places
that lose blood easily,

1316
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:17,070
but as you tire and you start to peter 
out,

1317
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,970
that gives way your body can't expend 
the energy necessary to do that and it 

1318
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:26,280
opens those up and it's a rush of heat,
so it's like your.

1319
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:29,130
Your fingers have gotten very cold.
Your lives have gotten very cold.

1320
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:31,180
Your face got very cold and all of a 
sudden you body's like,

1321
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,300
I can't do anymore.
And all that hot blood rushes out to 

1322
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:36,690
those things and people apparently get 
this feeling of intense heat.

1323
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,400
Wow.
Grunden start.

1324
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:43,550
Yeah.
And then so they'll find someone and 

1325
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:43,550
it's always like,
you know,

1326
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:45,510
he's got some clothes over here and his 
wedding rings land over that way and you

1327
00:58:45,511 --> 00:58:48,260
know,
burn.

1328
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:52,970
But you know what man I got,
I Just,

1329
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:56,090
I was down fishing in Florida.
I got built by black flies real bad.

1330
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:01,170
And uh,
and for the first time since I got 

1331
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,470
married,
I took my wedding ring off for a day and

1332
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:07,470
a that's all good.
I got like a guilty conscious feeling 

1333
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:12,310
and I had to put it back on and 
uncomfortable because I just felt 

1334
00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,041
guilty.
And then I get here and I'm looking 

1335
00:59:15,041 --> 00:59:16,961
through my bag and find my wife's 
reading wedding ring in my backpack 

1336
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:18,440
because like a week ago she didn't know 
where to put it.

1337
00:59:18,441 --> 00:59:20,780
And I put my backpack on and be like,
do you even know

1338
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:27,860
like here,
a bunch of dudes in the background come 

1339
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:27,900
back to the hot tub.
I know.

1340
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:32,430
I didn't know he had a hard time trying 
to scratch undermine,

1341
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:37,470
you know.
And hers is just in some unknown 

1342
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:37,470
location too.
I left my,

1343
00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:40,830
I left my wedding ring at a spa where I 
got a massage from a dude.

1344
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,530
I go,
I've been getting,

1345
00:59:43,531 --> 00:59:48,531
I get messages from dudes now I gave up 
because girls can't do it hard and they 

1346
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:48,531
can't.
I need,

1347
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,910
I need deep tissue.
And it's brutal.

1348
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,260
It's painful,
it doesn't feel good.

1349
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:57,320
But you got to have a man doing it 
because women just not strong enough to 

1350
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:57,320
do it.
Some women are,

1351
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,540
they used their elbows really well,
but I'm borderline.

1352
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:02,670
He has to have a mustache.
Borderline violent.

1353
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,050
It's that hard to come with a guy 
though.

1354
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,700
It's not that hard.
So,

1355
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:06,810
um,
anyway,

1356
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:07,310
um,
I,

1357
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,400
I go and I come back and she always 
makes fun of me for getting massaged by 

1358
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:12,400
dudes.
Right.

1359
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:12,990
And then I go,
fuck,

1360
01:00:12,991 --> 01:00:15,330
I left my wedding ring there.
So I run back,

1361
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,520
I get the,
when I come back home she goes,

1362
01:00:17,521 --> 01:00:18,390
was it in his ass?

1363
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,340
That's so awesome.
Oh yeah.

1364
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:26,990
It was fucking hilarious.
By the way,

1365
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:29,630
did you actually go to dick party in my 
mouth and see what that was.

1366
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:30,970
I just made that up.
Good.

1367
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:32,680
Check it out.
Go check it out.

1368
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:35,780
It's powerful.
We were talking about,

1369
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:38,810
um,
who is domain name privacy that when you

1370
01:00:38,811 --> 01:00:41,840
register a domain you can also register 
it anonymously.

1371
01:00:41,841 --> 01:00:45,140
so people don't know who owns dick party
in my mouth.

1372
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,120
Dot com.
They're going to be surprised.

1373
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:48,760
Why was it surprising?
It's,

1374
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,170
it's pretty shocking.
Okay.

1375
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,350
That's going to tell you at the 
beginning,

1376
01:00:51,351 --> 01:00:54,690
but pretty shocking with the url.
I mean like alex,

1377
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:57,780
what's your next?
what's your next trip?

1378
01:00:57,781 --> 01:01:02,310
How do you talk about the constitution?
How weird is this?

1379
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:03,390
Oh,
it is.

1380
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:05,480
Oh,
it's death squad team.

1381
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,280
That's hilarious.
Did you just transfer it?

1382
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:12,390
I bought that during the commercial.
That's good move man.

1383
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,480
That's a smart move.
And how much does something like that 

1384
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:17,480
costs?
13 bucks.

1385
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,000
Because I used to keep our code rogan 
and save 10 percent.

1386
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,670
Guys,
while we're doing this,

1387
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:25,700
are you gonna fucking pump up?
You've got to try to tell people where 

1388
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:27,090
you going to do if you're happen to be 
in edmonton,

1389
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,380
April 25th,
26th,

1390
01:01:28,381 --> 01:01:29,310
27th,
28th,

1391
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,350
and come to the comic strip if you're 
there.

1392
01:01:31,650 --> 01:01:33,030
I meAn,
but otherwise don't.

1393
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,830
Steve,
you are the,

1394
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:38,910
you're the only hunting show that I know
of that shows on a regular basis.

1395
01:01:38,911 --> 01:01:41,070
You'll show if you get skunkeD,
you know.

1396
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,050
Yeah.
We call them sculling curse you,

1397
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:45,180
you'll show you.
He'll have a whole episode.

1398
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:50,070
Like there was an episode where you were
going after our dad wasn't that one.

1399
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:52,950
You got so close but it was too Dark for
you to like,

1400
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:55,140
we've done four.
We've done for skunk.

1401
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,750
You can't get nothing getting skunked 
like.

1402
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:00,190
No,
no,

1403
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:00,690
no,
no.

1404
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,210
skunk.
The skunk is not getting anything.

1405
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:08,950
The first time we filmed a dunker I'll 
stop using that lingo.

1406
01:02:08,951 --> 01:02:11,350
the first time I will hunt.
Right.

1407
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:16,680
um,
I was very nervous and I was trying to 

1408
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:16,680
make the case.

1409
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:17,860
We uh,
wouldn't air it.

1410
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,340
I don't know know,
it seems stupid.

1411
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:21,840
We're at the time,
it seemed like a good idea.

1412
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,810
We wouldn't air it.
And then one time we went out,

1413
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,840
we went to hunter mountain lions with 
hounds with a friend of mine and went 

1414
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,410
and spent six days hunting,
didn't get anything,

1415
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:34,440
came back,
went back out again,

1416
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:37,770
been I think seven days hunting,
didn't get anything.

1417
01:02:37,771 --> 01:02:42,771
And at that point we just had it.
So then we cut that into one and 

1418
01:02:42,771 --> 01:02:44,820
oftentimes the winds up being that I'm 
not oftentimes,

1419
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:48,510
it's almost like the normal way is 
people will then pick those out as their

1420
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:50,310
favorite shows.
Really.

1421
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,590
No,
and I think it gets back to that thing I

1422
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:54,390
was talking about earlier,
like is um,

1423
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:58,290
is that whole thing of like courting 
uncertainty.

1424
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,180
do you know what I mean?
And like,

1425
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:02,640
like things that are challenging and 
things you won't figure it out.

1426
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,650
So I think people like to see that 
represented.

1427
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:08,370
Also,
I'll say that there's a big rift in um,

1428
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:14,750
in hunting as experienced by the 
american sportsman in hunting as seen on

1429
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,800
hunting television.
You know,

1430
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,200
for me,
growing up,

1431
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:25,560
like we were start hunting deer,
the Bowl on october one and you can hunt

1432
01:03:25,561 --> 01:03:30,561
deer right up almost the rifle season,
which was November 15th and you had 10 

1433
01:03:30,561 --> 01:03:33,861
days to hunt with a rifle.
Then you'd pick your bow bAckup and the 

1434
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:37,080
hunted December 31st and it would be 
plausible that you would hunt pretty 

1435
01:03:37,381 --> 01:03:40,470
hard through that whole thing and never 
get a deer.

1436
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,020
It was just the thing that happened,
man.

1437
01:03:43,021 --> 01:03:43,960
You would like,
you know,

1438
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:45,020
most years you get deer,
but it'd be,

1439
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,750
you might not.
And there's a lot of guys were not there

1440
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,600
right now.
It's Turkey season.

1441
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:53,870
There's a lot of guys around in this 
country facing the prospect that they 

1442
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:53,870
work pretty hard and haunted five,
six,

1443
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:55,770
seven days and they won't get a Turkey.

1444
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:57,390
So I think that people.
And,

1445
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:02,630
and I think that the assumption is 
always that people do want to Get 

1446
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,920
something and they do.
And so when they're watching something,

1447
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:07,560
like when they're watching television,
that's a form of escapism.

1448
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:12,540
And so you want to see people achieve 
what you wish you achieved,

1449
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:17,660
you know?
So there would be a thing that you'd 

1450
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:17,660
want to go and see,
like I dream of killing a big buck.

1451
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,260
I want to watch a guy shoot 10 bIg 
bucks,

1452
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:24,830
you know?
and that's like one form of 

1453
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:24,830
entertainment.
I think at the same time,

1454
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:27,330
people like to see in some way their 
life reflected back to them.

1455
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:33,410
I think more and more people actually 
are going the route that you just 

1456
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:33,410
described.
They wAnt to see that,

1457
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:38,510
that authentic experience,
especially because a lot of reality tv 

1458
01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:40,500
now is very unrealistic.
It's very safe.

1459
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,290
You got to pull up my.
Sorry.

1460
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,690
It's so hard.
But a lot of reality tv right now,

1461
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:48,250
it's not really reality tv at scripted,
you know?

1462
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:50,730
And so there is something completely 
unscripted,

1463
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,260
you know,
it's real.

1464
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,720
If you're watching meat eater and you 
don't get anything,

1465
01:04:54,910 --> 01:04:56,850
I think you know,
that's a real show.

1466
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:02,120
No,
that really happened was it wasn't like 

1467
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:02,260
we actually got a bunch of stuff and 
then it's better to just,

1468
01:05:02,261 --> 01:05:03,780
you know,
show that sometimes you don't.

1469
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:04,760
Exactly.
But you know,

1470
01:05:05,050 --> 01:05:05,970
and that's the thing.
I mean,

1471
01:05:05,971 --> 01:05:10,971
you talked to anybody who's hunted for,
for any amount of time and a huge part 

1472
01:05:10,971 --> 01:05:14,400
of the huntington is,
is about going out with the guys that,

1473
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:16,800
that you're going hunting with and it's 
about the experience.

1474
01:05:16,801 --> 01:05:17,750
It's About

1475
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:21,670
what you bring home in terms of the,
the game.

1476
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,990
Whereas what you bring home up here and 
in here.

1477
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,000
Yeah.
I think um,

1478
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:29,690
it's important to show that you don't 
always get something because it's,

1479
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:30,690
you're,
you're,

1480
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,200
It's a real show.
The everything you're doing is real,

1481
01:05:33,201 --> 01:05:34,060
you know,
and that's,

1482
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:36,290
that's part of the whole thing.
You got to,

1483
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:41,380
it's got to be A part of the whole 
prison presentation also lends to the 

1484
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:41,380
drama.
no,

1485
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,490
actually when there are assumptions you 
don't get it.

1486
01:05:43,491 --> 01:05:45,800
So now that our dad,
sheep one was a great one,

1487
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:50,801
even though you didn't get one,
it's just like seeing you like in the 

1488
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:50,930
dusk where it was just getting like,
you're like,

1489
01:05:50,931 --> 01:05:54,280
I need five more minutes,
five more minutes of [inaudible] light.

1490
01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:56,120
and you just couldn't get it.
Like shit.

1491
01:05:56,570 --> 01:05:57,990
Like you had it,
you had the,

1492
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,980
you had it right in your sights.
ThAt's real.

1493
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,620
The mountain lion thing is real and I 
wanteD to talk to you about the mountain

1494
01:06:03,621 --> 01:06:04,850
lion thing for me.
Let me,

1495
01:06:04,851 --> 01:06:05,300
I want to add

1496
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,350
one thing,
the what you were saying.

1497
01:06:06,351 --> 01:06:08,900
I do want to talk about the mountain 
lion thing because the jaguar thing too.

1498
01:06:08,901 --> 01:06:10,160
But yeah.
Um,

1499
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:16,450
we did have a guy email one time.
All the emails you get like people 

1500
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:16,940
saying,
I love that you show like some failure.

1501
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,460
We had an email from a guy who was 
following.

1502
01:06:19,461 --> 01:06:20,580
He'll never watch the show

1503
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:24,130
again because he has enough failure in 
his life.

1504
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,940
He doesn't want to see other people 
fail.

1505
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,810
That's hilarious.
So awesome.

1506
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,540
Honest.
Yeah,

1507
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,280
me too.
I appreciate that guy.

1508
01:06:39,390 --> 01:06:42,250
Fucking dvd show.
I'll tell you what,

1509
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:44,640
I watch ted nugent ever week.
God damn ain't never misses.

1510
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:47,300
That's like steve burns joke where a 
girl calls up and she said,

1511
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:48,970
you'll never guess what almost happened.
He's lIke nothing.

1512
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:52,660
Because it was almost like a ted nugent 
shoots.

1513
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,720
He'll shoot three deer with a bow and 
arrow in the first five minutes of a 

1514
01:06:57,720 --> 01:07:00,910
show and I'm not bullshitting.
He shot three deer with bows and arrows.

1515
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:05,911
Yeah,
I mean it's not my favorite part about 

1516
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:05,911
it.
He,

1517
01:07:05,911 --> 01:07:06,130
he,
after he shoots a deer,

1518
01:07:06,131 --> 01:07:11,131
he goes,
can you believe that you believe you 

1519
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:11,131
just fucking did.
You just shot one,

1520
01:07:11,131 --> 01:07:15,421
five minutes.
I don't know what kind of limits ted 

1521
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:19,360
nugent hazard is.
Backyard land management issue.

1522
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:24,560
You know where you can.
You can make the call if you've got a 

1523
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,200
high fence operation in Texas,
like how many take out

1524
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,280
you can do your do your own manager.

1525
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:28,600
Yeah.
I don't know.

1526
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,800
That's management and he sitting up 
there in the fucking tree stand blast 

1527
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:33,800
and deer with his bow and arrow

1528
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:39,270
variability.
It surprises people that surprised 

1529
01:07:39,270 --> 01:07:42,121
people that,
that don't have familiarity with 

1530
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:42,121
hunting.
One,

1531
01:07:42,121 --> 01:07:43,510
it surprises people that there's 
regulations at all sometimes like if you

1532
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:44,170
grow up,
you know,

1533
01:07:44,171 --> 01:07:49,171
I,
I have friends in New York who were 

1534
01:07:49,171 --> 01:07:49,171
pleasantly surprised to hear that wild 
game is managed.

1535
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:50,300
You know,
and,

1536
01:07:50,380 --> 01:07:53,380
and I think also beyond that,
it's surprising to people at the very,

1537
01:07:53,381 --> 01:07:55,990
the variations from the different 
states,

1538
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:01,110
their strategy and how they're managing.
And I think a lot of it comes down to 

1539
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,880
what a lot of it comes down to how much 
of the state's public and like Texas,

1540
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,850
they even got to school,
got rid of school trust lands.

1541
01:08:06,851 --> 01:08:11,851
So like you used to be the one in every 
36 sections belonged to the state and 

1542
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:16,711
they could use that to either build 
schools on or use that land to fund 

1543
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:22,360
school construction and they threw 
mineral leasing or timber rights or 

1544
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:22,360
whatever.

1545
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:27,150
And at a point in Texas even scrap that,
they even sold that off into private 

1546
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:27,150
interests.
So they,

1547
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,660
it's like there really is like public 
trust.

1548
01:08:29,661 --> 01:08:34,661
Wildlife isn't as vital in a place like 
taxes because there's not publicly owned

1549
01:08:34,761 --> 01:08:37,450
land with publicly owned wildlife on it.
Wow.

1550
01:08:37,610 --> 01:08:38,810
You know,
that's kinda crazy,

1551
01:08:38,811 --> 01:08:40,690
isn't it,
that you take a state like new guys,

1552
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:45,700
everything is privately estela you guys 
that you guys have humongous national 

1553
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,241
forest.
There's a lot of public trust land and 

1554
01:08:49,241 --> 01:08:49,580
public trust while.
But even in places like California,

1555
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:50,480
so yeah,
you have a,

1556
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:55,720
you have the government plays a much 
stronger hand in a much more detail 

1557
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:56,210
oriented hand.
And like,

1558
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,600
what's happening,
all this stuff was our harvest like that

1559
01:08:59,601 --> 01:09:01,430
in some states where it kind of tends to
be like,

1560
01:09:01,460 --> 01:09:02,180
well,
it's your land,

1561
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:03,480
you figure it out are

1562
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,720
show on the mountain lions.
One of the specific reasons I wanted to 

1563
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,580
bring that up is because the,
the idea of hunting with hogs or hunting

1564
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:12,910
with dogs rather is,
uh,

1565
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:15,300
they,
they've done work it off

1566
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:21,760
too hard.
I cannot get a mountain lion with these 

1567
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:24,860
stupid dude.
I,

1568
01:09:24,861 --> 01:09:26,900
I'm sorry.
My iphone road hogs.

1569
01:09:26,901 --> 01:09:31,901
I meant you need trained dog.
Fuck man hunter.

1570
01:09:32,991 --> 01:09:36,590
I told people I'm a hunter.
Now look like an ass on facebook

1571
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,870
dogs in California.
You can hunt with dogs anymore.

1572
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,490
And uh,
people,

1573
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:47,290
uh,
some people are concerned about that.

1574
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:52,291
I've heard people say that they're 
worried that the mountain lion 

1575
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:52,291
population is going to get too strong if
they do that.

1576
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,400
Especially people have lost dogs or who 
knows,

1577
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:57,610
people who have been a fucking bikers 
and shit.

1578
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:01,300
They get taken out,
but California doesn't allow it anymore.

1579
01:10:01,390 --> 01:10:05,620
Coincidentally,
I saw a mountain lion last week in santa

1580
01:10:05,621 --> 01:10:09,070
barbara.
A small mountain line wasn't very big.

1581
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:10,790
I thought it was a chaotic at first 
could,

1582
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:11,970
but it wasn't,
you know,

1583
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,510
coyotes.
They move kind of stiff.

1584
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:17,250
This thing had like this bounce to it.
Tail put.

1585
01:10:17,370 --> 01:10:19,360
It wasn't a bobcat.
No,

1586
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:21,460
it was the tail and the long tails.
Mountain lion.

1587
01:10:21,461 --> 01:10:23,530
It was probably 70 pounds.
Wow.

1588
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:24,220
Yeah.

1589
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,780
I think you're seeing like.
Yeah,

1590
01:10:25,781 --> 01:10:28,170
and I don't mean to say I hate to,
I don't want to sound like,

1591
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:31,170
you know,
like taking cheap shots,

1592
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,090
you know,
at California or anything,

1593
01:10:33,091 --> 01:10:38,091
but you're seeing a pretty,
a real erosion of haunting.

1594
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,490
Right?
Like a gradual.

1595
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:46,670
Not even grab a pretty steady of rowers.
No hunting rights in California there 

1596
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:47,840
was a debate that was easy because 
there's a thing.

1597
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:52,230
There's the thing,
I mentioned this somewhere where you can

1598
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:55,500
go to american or you can go to the 
american public and say like,

1599
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,190
yes or no,
like do you approve of,

1600
01:10:59,490 --> 01:11:01,680
of regulated hunting.
Okay.

1601
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,590
And you get the vast majority of 
americans.

1602
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:09,830
It's something ridiculous.
Like 74 percent or 75 percent of 

1603
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:09,830
americans will say like,
yes,

1604
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:12,840
I approve of honey.
but then you start asking them,

1605
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:14,870
you know,
like,

1606
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,440
well how about with dogs?
Right?

1607
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,000
And in those numbers start to go down 
when you start [inaudible] because you 

1608
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,260
can kInd of,
it's easy to sell people on.

1609
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:30,260
The idea is easy to sell.
People who've never seen a hunting dog 

1610
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,050
there were never had experienced with 
dog.

1611
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:36,140
I've never laid eyes on a line.
It's easy to sell them on the idea that 

1612
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:37,620
somehow there's no challenge in it.
And so then you can,

1613
01:11:37,650 --> 01:11:42,650
you can have a,
a way to chip away like a way to chip 

1614
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:44,700
away at liberty,
like personal liberty and stuff.

1615
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,380
it's just to do like one little thing at
a time,

1616
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,820
you know,
we'll do this,

1617
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:48,600
we'll do that,
we'll do this,

1618
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:49,920
we'll do that.
And so like,

1619
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,870
They'll never be a thing like we'll ban 
hunting.

1620
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:54,660
It was be that you can't hunt on this 
kind of land.

1621
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:59,720
You know,
you can't have this kind of animal this 

1622
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,881
way.
Well in fact we don't want you to 

1623
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:01,881
hunting that kind of animal at all.
And you see that in certain places.

1624
01:12:01,881 --> 01:12:02,640
Colorado's had some experience with 
that.

1625
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:05,090
We know you got the lead ammo ban and 
the uh,

1626
01:12:05,130 --> 01:12:08,260
California conduit range that they're 
trying to expand statewide.

1627
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,770
So you couldn't use lead ammo to hunt at
all.

1628
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:15,980
Well,
there even places where there are no 

1629
01:12:15,980 --> 01:12:17,271
cars,
even the places where there are no 

1630
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:17,271
condo,
right?

1631
01:12:17,271 --> 01:12:19,170
I heard a big debate about this mountain
lion issue and one of the things that 

1632
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,820
the guy from the fish and wildlife 
service said is,

1633
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:26,090
well,
you guys don't realize is if you're 

1634
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:27,801
actually a preservationist,
the majority of money that we collect to

1635
01:12:28,021 --> 01:12:32,760
preserve the land you like to hike in 
comes from hunters.

1636
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:38,180
It comes from Hunting licenses.
That's where the fish and wildlife 

1637
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:42,801
service and these different 
organizations that are responsible for 

1638
01:12:42,801 --> 01:12:45,000
maintenance of the land that is hunted,
hiked on and camped on.

1639
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,020
That's the 90 some crazy amount of 95 
percent,

1640
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:50,100
some crazy amount.
I can't remember.

1641
01:12:50,101 --> 01:12:55,101
The percentage comes from hunters and 
the dues and fees they have to pay to 

1642
01:12:55,411 --> 01:13:00,411
hunt that land.
So I think that the debate has to be 

1643
01:13:00,411 --> 01:13:04,101
couched in those terms too.
If you really wanted to get rid of 

1644
01:13:04,101 --> 01:13:06,831
hunters,
we wouldn't have revenue to actually 

1645
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:06,831
maintain.

1646
01:13:06,831 --> 01:13:10,750
Well,
I think there's also this part need to 

1647
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:12,941
appease a certain liberal said,
I'm part of the population that is very 

1648
01:13:13,371 --> 01:13:18,371
uncomfortable with hunting in the first 
place and would like to look at people 

1649
01:13:18,371 --> 01:13:18,470
hunting with dogs as okay,
jesus christ,

1650
01:13:18,471 --> 01:13:23,471
that's part ferric.
Your sicking dogs on them and then 

1651
01:13:23,471 --> 01:13:23,471
you're shooting them.
It's poor defenseless animals,

1652
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:29,620
especially when it comes to predators.
There's a population management issue 

1653
01:13:29,620 --> 01:13:31,160
that they're not willing to address and 
if you don't address that,

1654
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:32,750
you're going to deal with it in the 
suburbs.

1655
01:13:32,751 --> 01:13:37,751
okay.
They just shot a fucking mountain lion 

1656
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:37,751
with a tranquilizer dart in glendale the
other day.

1657
01:13:37,751 --> 01:13:39,470
Yeah.
Was all in the news and they killed that

1658
01:13:39,471 --> 01:13:42,650
one in santa monica a year ago.
That was 90 fucking pounds.

1659
01:13:42,770 --> 01:13:44,450
I saw one in santa barbara the other 
day.

1660
01:13:44,690 --> 01:13:49,690
I mean it.
I'm not comfortable like with those 

1661
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:49,690
things like getting more popular.

1662
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,110
I'm.
I'm never,

1663
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:56,590
I'm never comfortable with terms like,
like overpopulated because it's just 

1664
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,250
like.
I don't know really how to define it,

1665
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:03,251
but overpopulating the sense that you're
gonna wind up seeing impacts that might 

1666
01:14:03,251 --> 01:14:06,050
be counter to what it is you're going 
after.

1667
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:09,860
You know,
like you'll lose in infringe Areas.

1668
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:12,340
You might lose species

1669
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:17,790
to,
to predation and predation have a 

1670
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:17,790
serious effect on species that you may 
be.

1671
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:21,721
We'll want back at what happened with 
wolves in yellowstone is not what is 

1672
01:14:21,721 --> 01:14:24,640
happening or you know,
you seem like a radical,

1673
01:14:24,641 --> 01:14:28,120
radical decline.
Radical,

1674
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:33,370
very localized decline.
An elk and moose.

1675
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:37,120
Okay,
and it's hard for people.

1676
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:42,210
If you look at a map of the country and 
what used to be wolf territory and at 

1677
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:44,860
the time of european contact,
it was wolf country,

1678
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:50,100
the country,
the entire nation was in some way or 

1679
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:50,100
another had had wolves,
not the entire place,

1680
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:54,361
but a lot of adults.
Now let's say you're a guy and you live 

1681
01:14:54,361 --> 01:14:55,840
in Colorado.
All right,

1682
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,560
and you hear that hunting wolves,
Montana.

1683
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,860
You're probably thinking,
but we don't even have wolves in 

1684
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:04,860
Colorado.
We do,

1685
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:05,200
but there's not many.
And it's kind of controversial.

1686
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:07,000
Whether it is a stable breeding 
population or not.

1687
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:09,790
And you're telling me that they're 
killing them right up in Montana because

1688
01:15:09,791 --> 01:15:14,791
it's hard for people to visualize the 
localized impact of these things so you 

1689
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:20,641
can have too many wolves in Montana and 
then jump down through Wyoming and you 

1690
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:24,400
enter Colorado and you could have not 
enough.

1691
01:15:24,850 --> 01:15:27,370
You know,
why is that the wolves?

1692
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,440
I guess they stay within a certain 
territory.

1693
01:15:29,490 --> 01:15:31,690
They stay within a certain territory and
they have a really.

1694
01:15:31,780 --> 01:15:33,640
I mean they have a profound effect and 
stuff.

1695
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:38,790
You have To think like,
have you guys been to yellowstone 

1696
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:39,040
national park kid?
You also national park,

1697
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:44,060
you know the last,
like yellowstone national park was 

1698
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,060
hunted for,
you know,

1699
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:44,290
nine or 10,000
years.

1700
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:49,291
I think the oldest artifact,
they found that they have reliable data 

1701
01:15:49,291 --> 01:15:49,900
from yellowstone,
something like a spear point from 9,000

1702
01:15:49,901 --> 01:15:52,540
years ago.
So it hasn't those joe's,

1703
01:15:53,230 --> 01:15:54,250
but the last one,
hundred years,

1704
01:15:54,251 --> 01:15:54,850
no one's hunted it.

1705
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,210
Yellowstone park,
when he also parked became a park.

1706
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:03,270
There was still an indian war,
like the nez perce went through there 

1707
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,520
and killed some tourists while they are 
fleeing the u.

1708
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:04,620
S military.
Okay.

1709
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:07,030
After that,
they banned hunting yellowstone national

1710
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:12,031
park.
Anyone who goes to yellowstone national 

1711
01:16:12,031 --> 01:16:12,040
park now,
we'll see the way the elk and everything

1712
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:14,420
just like has no concern for humans.
Right?

1713
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,840
They've ruled out that humans are 
troublesome,

1714
01:16:17,050 --> 01:16:22,050
so you had this long absence of no 
wolves in that ecosystem and when you 

1715
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:26,461
put wolves back in,
it's just taken those animals a really 

1716
01:16:26,461 --> 01:16:28,090
long time to figure out how to get back 
to,

1717
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:30,190
to get back to knowing what's going to 
be.

1718
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:35,580
And so we had inflated.
We had inflated numbers of elk and 

1719
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:35,580
somewhat argue inflated numbers,
elk,

1720
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:38,320
someone arguing inflated numbers of 
moose and when the wolves came back,

1721
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,390
it's just.
I mean,

1722
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:43,080
just plowed into the ground.
There's tea,

1723
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:46,510
there's hurt mountain range that maybe 
had $9,000.

1724
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:51,720
Now they're down to less than 2000.
I was talking with a guy from a 

1725
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,920
conservation organization that deals 
with elk and they're looking at the very

1726
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:59,680
real probability of if the wolf 
situation ever does get under control in

1727
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:04,681
the area of having to reintroduce elk 
into some mountain ranges because 

1728
01:17:04,681 --> 01:17:06,850
there's a paucity of breeding age,
female god,

1729
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:09,560
because they're all getting killed by 
wolves and it's just like,

1730
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:10,050
jeez,

1731
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:15,910
you still have groups that are trying to
stop the wool funds in Montana and 

1732
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:15,910
Idaho.

1733
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:16,490
Well,
the problem is also,

1734
01:17:16,491 --> 01:17:21,491
I heard you can't actually,
you can't shoot your way out of this 

1735
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:21,491
problem when it comes to walls.
In fact.

1736
01:17:21,491 --> 01:17:22,760
Rise to hear that.
yeah.

1737
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:23,500
But then that,
that,

1738
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:27,610
that poses boxes and all that.
You're talking joe.

1739
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,940
I've never been a fan of wolves.
People,

1740
01:17:29,941 --> 01:17:34,941
uh,
try to pretend they're dogs and get all 

1741
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:34,941
attached to him because you know,
it looks like your colleagues,

1742
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:36,290
that's a fucking wolf and that'll eat 
you.

1743
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:38,060
And they've eaten people before and 
fact.

1744
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:40,670
I told the story on the podcast about 
France,

1745
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:45,790
France.
I say brian France used to come in 

1746
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:47,540
people before they cornered them and 
killed them.

1747
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:52,720
I mean they've really,
I mean I don't think there's any real 

1748
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:54,740
argument be made that there's a human 
risks not yet the highway.

1749
01:17:54,741 --> 01:17:57,980
Now there's an argument to made that 
there's an ecological risks.

1750
01:17:58,040 --> 01:17:59,900
I think there's still a human risk.

1751
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,070
I think if you get around a big pack of 
them and you just.

1752
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,830
A child happens to be in that area.
While that's called going down,

1753
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:11,831
someone sneaks out of the house and they
have a farm and there's a story I read 

1754
01:18:11,831 --> 01:18:16,751
online about this woman who is watching 
these wolves tear apart sheep in her 

1755
01:18:16,751 --> 01:18:19,320
backyard.
It was fucking wild.

1756
01:18:19,321 --> 01:18:21,500
I don't play around.
She said they got into this,

1757
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,460
they have a pen of sheep and they got in
and there was like four or five wolf's.

1758
01:18:25,461 --> 01:18:30,461
We're just running through ripping these
sheep apart and you just heard these 

1759
01:18:30,461 --> 01:18:33,911
horrific noise is tearing and grappling 
and horrible sheep screens.

1760
01:18:38,450 --> 01:18:40,520
He's looking out the window watching 
this going,

1761
01:18:40,521 --> 01:18:42,710
holy fuck.
Imagine that.

1762
01:18:42,711 --> 01:18:45,320
That's going down in your yard.
And then they know that this is a.

1763
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,290
This is a place where food is.
How big is it?

1764
01:18:47,291 --> 01:18:49,340
Timber wolf.
They go to like 100 and 2,030

1765
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:52,780
pounds bigger than that.
Well then the real big ones that they're

1766
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:56,660
experiencing now mean these deer are 
getting very large for meeting all these

1767
01:18:56,661 --> 01:18:59,200
elk and even all these deer that didn't 
know they were coming there.

1768
01:18:59,460 --> 01:19:04,460
There's people that are shooting them.
They're taking pictures of him and you 

1769
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:05,960
would swear it's a photoshop.
These are enormous fucking wolves.

1770
01:19:06,100 --> 01:19:09,500
So you're like guys holding them and the
thing that looks as long as them.

1771
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:12,710
I mean I don't know what it waves.
It's more than a hundred 50 pounds.

1772
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:15,710
They're big dogs are big wolves.
I actually like,

1773
01:19:15,810 --> 01:19:20,810
you know,
I don't want to get rid of all the wolf 

1774
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:20,810
man.
Like I support.

1775
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:21,220
I support wolf recovery cam.
You got,

1776
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,900
I mean you deal with wildlife.
No so much while they.

1777
01:19:23,901 --> 01:19:26,240
PolItics was sort of like public 
perception of public opinion.

1778
01:19:26,241 --> 01:19:31,241
Would you say that?
I mean hundreds of being billed as 

1779
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:31,241
being,
wanting to destroy rules,

1780
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:32,990
but I think it's not really.
That's not what I hear.

1781
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,150
Destroying

1782
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:36,020
the wolf.
It's just pulled that mic up.

1783
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:38,440
It's about getting that balance back 
right now.

1784
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:39,160
I mean,
that's the thing.

1785
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:44,161
So you've got these groups that are out 
there trying to stop the wolf and they 

1786
01:19:44,161 --> 01:19:44,950
want to put the wolf back on the 
endangered species list,

1787
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:46,780
even though the wolf is no longer 
endangered,

1788
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:48,790
the wolf isn't threatened in these 
areas.

1789
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:53,791
Again,
these local areas that We're talking 

1790
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:54,220
about here know in the state of Idaho,
the state of Montana,

1791
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:55,580
um,
there,

1792
01:19:55,870 --> 01:19:59,800
there is a way to try to manage the 
wildlife so you get that balance.

1793
01:19:59,801 --> 01:20:02,110
But right now,
what have you seen as sort of,

1794
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:07,170
it's out of whack and right now the wolf
has the advantage and we're continuing 

1795
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:07,770
to give the advantage to the wolf and 
some of these states.

1796
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,860
And I think that's why you're trying to,
that.

1797
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,090
That's where that,
that battle comes in right now.

1798
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:14,360
What one wants to see,
I don't think anyone wants to see wolfs

1799
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:18,850
pulled these unrealistic urban people.
And that's really what it boils down to.

1800
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:24,480
The people that are really,
almost all the people that are against 

1801
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:25,400
hunting or against,
uh,

1802
01:20:25,401 --> 01:20:27,500
the,
the idea of a wildlife,

1803
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:33,240
wildlife management.
Almost all of them live in cities when 

1804
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,200
when people live in a place where you,
you have to contend with it,

1805
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:39,010
someone has to be the top predator and 
if it's not going to be a person,

1806
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:42,400
it's not going to be people and you're 
living around these animals,

1807
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:46,150
it's going to be them and that's just 
the reality of the food chain of life.

1808
01:20:46,151 --> 01:20:51,151
If you're a meek person and you're 
wandering around through the woods and 

1809
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:55,261
you stumble into a pack of hungry wolves
and haven't seen an elk because it 

1810
01:20:55,261 --> 01:20:55,600
decimated the population,
they'll kill you.

1811
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:59,260
I mean that's reality happen.
Might not happen,

1812
01:20:59,261 --> 01:21:02,140
but it's happened before.
A woman died in Alaska recently.

1813
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:05,330
She was killed by wolves and it was also
wearing an alc.

1814
01:21:05,370 --> 01:21:07,990
So that was the first documented case in
a long time.

1815
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:13,020
I was like 100 years in that state.
I think that 90 percent of the 95 

1816
01:21:13,751 --> 01:21:18,751
percent of traditional wolf habitat in 
Alaska is still occupied by wolves.

1817
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:20,840
Wow.
And they.

1818
01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:23,530
And they have very,
very few fatalities.

1819
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:26,220
I think that moose kill more people.
Yeah,

1820
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:26,920
they do.
They're in.

1821
01:21:26,921 --> 01:21:31,921
Anything else?
You also naTional park the greatest 

1822
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:31,921
cause of injury.
Now yellowstone national park is getting

1823
01:21:31,921 --> 01:21:34,930
gored by a buffalo.
My parents live in Utah in park city.

1824
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:36,340
You know what they always tell you?
The locals,

1825
01:21:36,341 --> 01:21:36,910
they go,
hey,

1826
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:42,300
be careful of moose.
Please don't think of them as dear to 

1827
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:46,310
not approach them and what do people do 
that like there's going to take a 

1828
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,510
picture and the moose is like,
nah,

1829
01:21:46,511 --> 01:21:48,730
I'm going to trample you now.
People get kIlled by moose.

1830
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:49,810
Yeah,
they'll fuck you up.

1831
01:21:49,820 --> 01:21:52,230
People are getting used to say,
you know,

1832
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:53,820
urban areas.
A lot of people who,

1833
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:58,840
who grow up in urban areas only live in 
urban areas have very unrealistic 

1834
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,980
expectations of what aniMals are.
They have this anthropomorphic,

1835
01:22:00,981 --> 01:22:02,580
you know,
operaTe.

1836
01:22:02,620 --> 01:22:05,240
It's bambi and they don't understand.
No,

1837
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:05,870
they,
you know,

1838
01:22:05,871 --> 01:22:07,000
I just became a,
a,

1839
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:10,760
a farmer now,
so I have pigs and chickens and I,

1840
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:12,680
it's,
it's so completely different actually,

1841
01:22:12,681 --> 01:22:14,570
like sit down and study these animals.

1842
01:22:14,670 --> 01:22:19,670
Are you doing for your business?
Are you doing it for me to provide for 

1843
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:19,850
yourself?

1844
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:21,510
Yes.
All of the above.

1845
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:26,570
I mean,
eventually I'd like to get to the point 

1846
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:26,570
where I can sell some,
you know,

1847
01:22:26,570 --> 01:22:26,570
we're doing a heritage livestock,

1848
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:31,090
where is it doing something like this 
recently,

1849
01:22:31,170 --> 01:22:36,170
I was like,
it seems like if you have resources and 

1850
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:39,451
you could get a plot of land and hire 
people to take care of it and grow it 

1851
01:22:39,451 --> 01:22:41,830
and have animals that you slaughter 
there and have food that you grow.

1852
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:43,540
They're like,
why wouldn't you do that?

1853
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:44,380
Great.
If you could do that,

1854
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:46,060
why wouldn't you do that?
Absolutely.

1855
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:46,110
Really?

1856
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:46,590
But,
you know,

1857
01:22:46,591 --> 01:22:51,591
it's like,
it drives me crazy to hear these people 

1858
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:51,591
say,
oh,

1859
01:22:51,591 --> 01:22:52,770
but look,
the biggest smiling and the pig is happy

1860
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:54,540
and the pig is the pig.
Loves you.

1861
01:22:54,541 --> 01:22:56,790
And how are you going to kill that pig 
and turn it into bacon?

1862
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,410
I'm telling you,
the pig doesn't love me.

1863
01:22:58,411 --> 01:23:03,411
The pig,
the biggest pig and my doesn't know in 

1864
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:03,411
my.
I'm a lovable guy.

1865
01:23:03,411 --> 01:23:04,460
But uh,
you know,

1866
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:05,530
I'd be honest with you.

1867
01:23:06,410 --> 01:23:11,410
I think we'll talk later.
A good way to look at man's thoughts 

1868
01:23:11,410 --> 01:23:12,520
that some thoughts together.
Good way to look at it.

1869
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:16,360
He's not going to live forever if you 
don't kill that big,

1870
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,520
so I got to turn into a fairy and cure 
cancer.

1871
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:21,000
It's a fucking pig.
They lived to be about 15.

1872
01:23:21,020 --> 01:23:24,730
Then they die when they die.
If you don't eat them before they die,

1873
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:28,420
you lose all of delicious meat.
This pig,

1874
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:33,510
the pigs that I have on my farm would 
not exist unless we were going to eat 

1875
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:34,840
them.
That's the only by that logic.

1876
01:23:34,970 --> 01:23:36,850
We could make your own kids and start 
eating them.

1877
01:23:37,700 --> 01:23:42,700
We weren't listening earlier.
I made kids because where I live at 

1878
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,260
goodchild.
See I made kids for the free labor.

1879
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:45,520
See I've got.
Unlike steve,

1880
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:48,430
I've got time and hell yeah,
it's about doing the chores and all this

1881
01:23:48,431 --> 01:23:48,670
stuff.

1882
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:53,670
I don't want to do get out there and all
my yard to pull it up.

1883
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:55,740
Three or you have three?
Yeah.

1884
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:58,280
so you.
You don't have a.

1885
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:01,030
You don't have a facility where you 
would do this,

1886
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,150
this or agriculture?
No,

1887
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:04,030
no I don't,
but I would.

1888
01:24:04,070 --> 01:24:05,530
I would think about buying a piece of 
land.

1889
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,850
Just getting something positive.
Man.

1890
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:11,230
It looks sweet because it'd be like 
prominent podcast host,

1891
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:16,240
comic actor in farmer.
I think it makes,

1892
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:18,250
well I have chickens,
you know,

1893
01:24:18,251 --> 01:24:21,220
just just recently got chickens so that 
I could eat their eggs.

1894
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:26,580
But uh,
I've been thinking about this for a 

1895
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:26,980
while,
like everybody's worried about gmo foods

1896
01:24:26,981 --> 01:24:28,910
and everybody's worried about like,
you know,

1897
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,570
monsanto when they're worrIed about 
what's organic,

1898
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:34,960
what's not organic and what are the 
standards on grow your own shit.

1899
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:37,990
You know exactly what it is and you can 
take care of your soil.

1900
01:24:38,050 --> 01:24:41,770
Italy still Italy if you go through.
I took a train to Italy.

1901
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:44,200
Trend for the north is trying to become 
sophisticated.

1902
01:24:44,201 --> 01:24:49,201
Again.
This will read a story about when I went

1903
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:50,660
to Italy.
For me,

1904
01:24:50,661 --> 01:24:55,661
I say I'm a.
Everybody in their backyard grows her 

1905
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:55,661
own food.
Like it's so common.

1906
01:24:55,661 --> 01:24:58,080
So my gRandpa,
the gardens man,

1907
01:24:58,090 --> 01:25:00,580
my grandfather did not have a big yard 
in New Jersey,

1908
01:25:00,740 --> 01:25:04,120
but every part of the get we got coconut
water.

1909
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:04,620
What do you want,
man?

1910
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,660
I'll take coconut water.
You want a coffee?

1911
01:25:06,661 --> 01:25:08,080
You want?
You ever have bulletproof coffee?

1912
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:09,990
Bulletproof coffee.
Do we have any roots?

1913
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,060
To me,
yeah.

1914
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,970
Bulletproof coffee.
Not just no mold.

1915
01:25:14,170 --> 01:25:18,230
we have any more trouble.
I don't want to try.

1916
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:19,780
Not trouble.
We're here.

1917
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,630
We're partying.
You want to be here in a Minute on beer?

1918
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:25,960
I beg your pardon?
There's a couple of beers,

1919
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:27,040
a jamie.

1920
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,390
Bring out some beers,
man.

1921
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:31,130
That's right.
Son dick.

1922
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:36,570
What dig party in your mouth?
Dr a.

1923
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,520
I forgot exacTly what we were talking 
about.

1924
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:43,990
Becoming a farmer.
The idea has been fucking around with me

1925
01:25:44,230 --> 01:25:47,110
for the past couple of months.
I didn't know you got cHickens,

1926
01:25:47,111 --> 01:25:52,111
man.
You could just have them read at your 

1927
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:52,111
house.
Yeah.

1928
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:54,240
Built a chicken coop.
Do you have somebody taking care of it 

1929
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,240
or is it just real easy?
Like.

1930
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:54,240
No,
it's not that hard.

1931
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,730
I just,
I just built a planter.

1932
01:25:55,731 --> 01:25:57,230
I didn't.
My beard.

1933
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:02,990
I had a planter built.
I just think it's a great idea and I 

1934
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,020
think that the idea of reliant on 
somebody else for

1935
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:09,020
your own food ultimately it's like,
why would you do that if you have the 

1936
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:09,020
resources yet,
you know,

1937
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:11,580
and is there only one left?
Is that what is bring them all out?

1938
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:13,440
Um,
the,

1939
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:15,200
the,
you know,

1940
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:16,800
the idea that we,
we,

1941
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,900
we all rely on supermarkets.
You knoW,

1942
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,640
you look at what happened with hurricane
sandy,

1943
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:21,990
New York,
I'd shut down.

1944
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,000
I was talking to my buddy tommy.
he's like,

1945
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,880
I had a drive hours just to be able to 
use my cell phone.

1946
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,530
Towers were down,
everything was down.

1947
01:26:28,531 --> 01:26:29,880
There's no power.
Everything was fucked.

1948
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,740
And you know,
him talking about.

1949
01:26:31,741 --> 01:26:32,160
he's like,
dude,

1950
01:26:32,161 --> 01:26:33,600
that was scary as shit Man.
He goes,

1951
01:26:33,601 --> 01:26:36,840
because I realized like This whole thing
is like very fragile.

1952
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:38,370
If you don't know where your food's 
coming from.

1953
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:39,990
He goes,
we went to the supermarket.

1954
01:26:39,991 --> 01:26:44,991
It was just insane.
It was just empty shelf after empty 

1955
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:44,991
shell.
People had just taken everything.

1956
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,730
There was nothing left.
So there's not a supply.

1957
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:49,680
Sam,
what about water?

1958
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:54,360
Water reserves have underground tunnels 
have nothing in my basement.

1959
01:26:54,361 --> 01:26:57,040
Now I'm getting to be like an old weird 
man where I save 'em,

1960
01:26:57,690 --> 01:26:59,310
freeze dried food and stuff.
My base,

1961
01:26:59,311 --> 01:27:04,311
very smart,
but I still haven't done the water 

1962
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:04,311
things.
When you got to do,

1963
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:04,311
I got to get,
you know,

1964
01:27:04,311 --> 01:27:07,970
our tech,
the farming deal home farming.

1965
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:12,980
My brother,
he has those pack lIne was you've seen 

1966
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:12,980
those packs.
I love those things,

1967
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:16,490
so he bought a 10 acre pasture,
like a very unpicked your ass just like 

1968
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:22,400
an irrigated pasture and realized his 
llamas are just inhabit like a back 

1969
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,110
corner and when you use diddly of this 
pasture,

1970
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:30,680
so just because he's just a pragmatic 
resourceful person and he thought it's 

1971
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:35,340
out there.
It's getting wet and growing grass.

1972
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:40,670
So he started putting out lambs.
He put out goats now has got a calf out 

1973
01:27:41,191 --> 01:27:44,700
there and this guy,
he hunts so much so he hunts off his own

1974
01:27:44,701 --> 01:27:48,600
neat and he eats the media hunts and he 
just puts it out there and takes care of

1975
01:27:48,601 --> 01:27:50,670
it,
make sure it has water and then it gives

1976
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:54,690
all that stuff to his friends who come 
over and butcher the lands and take them

1977
01:27:54,691 --> 01:27:56,520
home and feed them to theIr kids.

1978
01:27:56,910 --> 01:28:00,510
It just kind of a sense of like if the 
lands there,

1979
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,460
you know what I mean?
It's like it's there.

1980
01:28:02,461 --> 01:28:07,461
It's been manipulated by man.
It's not that he's preserving some kind 

1981
01:28:07,461 --> 01:28:10,281
of like prime evil ecosystem.
It's just an irrigated pasture of 

1982
01:28:10,281 --> 01:28:10,800
alfalfa.
He's like,

1983
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:15,801
why not have that be like have output.
It's just pleasant to look out my window

1984
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:17,370
and be like,
it's producing,

1985
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:19,020
producing,
but when you have,

1986
01:28:19,021 --> 01:28:24,021
when you have,
when you have an acre of land or 

1987
01:28:24,021 --> 01:28:24,021
whatever that is and how he's growing 
alfalfa,

1988
01:28:24,021 --> 01:28:25,470
is that all you need for the animal to 
live?

1989
01:28:25,471 --> 01:28:30,471
Basically,
if you just put it out there and they 

1990
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:30,471
just live on that?
Well,

1991
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:30,471
I'm delving into stuff I don't 
understand now,

1992
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:34,140
but I know that camper,
I speak to this better because that he's

1993
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:36,600
got alfalfa,
but it's an old alfalfa field,

1994
01:28:36,601 --> 01:28:40,800
so I think people typically in some 
areas I know replant alfalfa every seven

1995
01:28:40,801 --> 01:28:45,801
years because eventually the alfalfa 
loses out to other plant species is my 

1996
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:47,820
understanding.
I don't know for sure that there's a lot

1997
01:28:47,821 --> 01:28:51,300
of animals.
If you go out and put them on just that.

1998
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,850
I'm sure there's a lot of guys that know
a lot about this,

1999
01:28:53,910 --> 01:28:57,360
like cringing right now.
If you go and put my just alfalfa,

2000
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:02,250
it's considered to be like a hot food 
and they'll overeat

2001
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:07,250
is too rich and it can damage themselves
if you put them out on just pure 

2002
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:12,351
alfalfa.
That's interesting because I read the 

2003
01:29:12,351 --> 01:29:12,570
deer that eat out of alfalfa fields are 
delicious.

2004
01:29:12,571 --> 01:29:15,920
That there they actually have like a 
little more species can hack it by.

2005
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:18,230
No,
I think that I've been told that i'M

2006
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:20,110
horses.
Does any of this makes sense To you?

2007
01:29:20,290 --> 01:29:25,290
A little bit,
but I'm more pig and chicken as opposed 

2008
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:25,290
to a lamb and stuff.

2009
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:28,670
Does that make sense?
With alfalfa making the deer tastes 

2010
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:28,670
better?

2011
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:28,670
Yeah,
I think it was.

2012
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:29,300
The deer is not going to just be eating 
alfalfa either.

2013
01:29:29,301 --> 01:29:30,650
I mean the deer is going to be,
you know,

2014
01:29:30,651 --> 01:29:32,500
roman and getting a lot.
Of course.

2015
01:29:33,710 --> 01:29:36,320
How much land is a farmer?
Do you need to grow,

2016
01:29:36,860 --> 01:29:39,500
you know,
your own meat and your own vegetables?

2017
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,660
Not much.
I mean really not much.

2018
01:29:41,661 --> 01:29:43,520
You could do it on.
So we've got 40 acres,

2019
01:29:43,521 --> 01:29:46,970
but right now we're only using about 
four and we've got,

2020
01:29:46,971 --> 01:29:48,440
you know,
we've got our big garden,

2021
01:29:48,441 --> 01:29:50,210
we've got our chickens that are free 
ranging,

2022
01:29:50,211 --> 01:29:52,280
we've got the pigs,
we're going to be getting some dairy,

2023
01:29:52,281 --> 01:29:54,500
goats and really like,
you know,

2024
01:29:55,340 --> 01:29:59,000
and really four acres is,
we don't even use all that space.

2025
01:29:59,001 --> 01:30:01,010
I mean they're spread out the picture 
over here,

2026
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:03,020
the chickens were over here,
uh,

2027
01:30:03,021 --> 01:30:04,350
you know,
the goats are out in another,

2028
01:30:04,351 --> 01:30:05,810
uh,
outer past where you guys could,

2029
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:11,080
you guys could feed like 30 people or 40
acres or we're way more.

2030
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:12,260
Yeah.
That's why,

2031
01:30:12,261 --> 01:30:17,261
you know,
eventually what we want to do is to get 

2032
01:30:17,261 --> 01:30:18,530
into the business side of it and to 
start selling some stuff.

2033
01:30:18,531 --> 01:30:18,920
And,
and,

2034
01:30:18,921 --> 01:30:20,960
and really even like some of the 
vegetables,

2035
01:30:20,961 --> 01:30:21,440
uh,
you know,

2036
01:30:21,441 --> 01:30:22,450
I want to do a,
uh,

2037
01:30:22,630 --> 01:30:25,520
I'm gonna do a pickle company one day.
I want to start pixeling shit.

2038
01:30:25,521 --> 01:30:27,050
And you know,
what are your,

2039
01:30:27,051 --> 01:30:29,360
what are your pigs,
what do you feed your pigs?

2040
01:30:29,390 --> 01:30:34,390
So right now that's as whole human 
asshole tsa workers.

2041
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,920
Um,
We have pig feed right now that they 

2042
01:30:42,920 --> 01:30:44,450
sound like big old dog food bags.
We're going to tractor supply and get 50

2043
01:30:44,451 --> 01:30:45,810
pound bags of pig feed.
They,

2044
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:50,811
they,
they eat the roots anD the pig pen and 

2045
01:30:50,811 --> 01:30:50,811
then we're going to,
uh,

2046
01:30:50,811 --> 01:30:54,101
we're about ready to move them out to a 
bigger area that's going to be about an 

2047
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:54,101
acre and they'll,
they'll wander around,

2048
01:30:54,101 --> 01:30:54,380
they'll,
they'll eat,

2049
01:30:54,400 --> 01:30:56,370
you know,
a shitloaD.

2050
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:58,160
When I was a kid who never stopped

2051
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:03,240
when I was a kid and my stepdad was a,
he was in school and one of the 

2052
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,901
agriculture classes that he had to take 
was like this co op farm that people in 

2053
01:31:06,901 --> 01:31:11,310
the school all did together.
They had animals and they grew plants 

2054
01:31:11,310 --> 01:31:13,810
and I mean it was like pretty like 
involved thing.

2055
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,440
And I remember even as a kid saying what
a cool idea.

2056
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,960
The idea that they all like chip in 
together.

2057
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:25,080
Everybody does like a little piece of 
something and everyone's sort of 

2058
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:25,080
communicates what's,
what needs to get done.

2059
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:27,730
And if you think about that in a real 
neighborhood man,

2060
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:33,090
you could have as long as you had the 
soil and as long as you had the 

2061
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:35,590
resources to get it started and then 
make it so it's self sufficient.

2062
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:40,740
If you had a sizable piece of land and 
everybody sort of chipped in and you 

2063
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:41,590
grew livestock and you grew plants and 
you know,

2064
01:31:41,591 --> 01:31:46,591
you fed them and everything like see it 
seems like it would be so economically 

2065
01:31:46,591 --> 01:31:50,880
manageable.
I mean like people would get all their 

2066
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,401
food.
Keep imagine if like we all got all our 

2067
01:31:53,401 --> 01:31:55,441
food from like a lot down the corner 
where we all knew that this goat had 

2068
01:31:55,441 --> 01:31:57,910
beaten all these foods that we had given
it.

2069
01:31:57,911 --> 01:32:00,250
And you know,
you knew exactly where the tomato

2070
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,470
came from because you put the seed in 
the ground.

2071
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:07,800
This is happening to the point where in 
cities now they have flat bed trucks 

2072
01:32:07,810 --> 01:32:11,110
that you can rent where you have a flat 
bed truck.

2073
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,190
They got a bunch of soil on that flatbed
truck.

2074
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:20,430
They're also doing an unruly.
And so what people are doing is getting 

2075
01:32:20,430 --> 01:32:24,301
timeshares and saying,
I want to buy a share of that flatbed 

2076
01:32:24,301 --> 01:32:24,340
truck.
Flatbed truck comes out,

2077
01:32:24,341 --> 01:32:27,370
you garden it,
you take your vegetables for the day and

2078
01:32:27,371 --> 01:32:30,370
it moves on to the next house.
Also they're doing it with like.

2079
01:32:30,430 --> 01:32:32,650
There's a lot of roof space.
Like in China,

2080
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:37,651
they built a whole city,
I guess where the rooms are basically 

2081
01:32:37,651 --> 01:32:42,001
planters to grow the food for the city.
I just saw a story out of chicago where 

2082
01:32:42,001 --> 01:32:45,631
they're using some of the old warehouses
and they're just turning them into 

2083
01:32:45,631 --> 01:32:45,631
indoor farms.

2084
01:32:45,631 --> 01:32:49,840
You've seen those two cia workers whose 
house got broken into and Kansas.

2085
01:32:49,841 --> 01:32:54,841
The fucking dea came in guns blazing 
because they thought these people were 

2086
01:32:54,841 --> 01:32:59,131
growing weed and it was former cia 
agents and they were growing tomatoes 

2087
01:32:59,131 --> 01:33:04,051
and vegetables in their basement.
THey had a whole hydroponic vegetables 

2088
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:08,701
systems set up with lights and.
Well they these assholes drive around 

2089
01:33:08,701 --> 01:33:12,541
looking for a heat signature from your 
home that shows that you're using some 

2090
01:33:12,541 --> 01:33:16,120
extraordinary amount of light,
which mostly people using the to to grow

2091
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:19,330
weed.
So they come in fucking guns out and you

2092
01:33:19,340 --> 01:33:20,530
know,
dea,

2093
01:33:20,531 --> 01:33:22,810
dogs and shit.
No pond.

2094
01:33:22,840 --> 01:33:25,330
It's too fucking former cia agents 
going,

2095
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:29,440
you crazy assholes.
The fuck is wrong with you.

2096
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:34,530
How about you knock on the door.
I show you my badge and my fucking 

2097
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:35,810
tomatoes right now.
I want to,

2098
01:33:35,811 --> 01:33:40,811
I want to write.
I want you to a fucking search of the 

2099
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:40,811
guy who lives there.
Oh,

2100
01:33:40,811 --> 01:33:43,810
it said cia guy.
Let's fucking,

2101
01:33:43,820 --> 01:33:47,800
let's go arrest him and his wife.
They're probably selling weed.

2102
01:33:47,830 --> 01:33:49,150
Cia.
I make sense.

2103
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:49,670
Yeah.
Yeah,

2104
01:33:49,700 --> 01:33:51,490
exactly.
Crazy fucks.

2105
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:54,880
W we had this thing happen reasonably.
It was like this perfect,

2106
01:33:54,881 --> 01:33:58,900
uh,
a cohesion of hunting and farming where,

2107
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:03,910
um,
we're down in Florida and we're hunting 

2108
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:06,430
turkeys on this guy's ranch and the guy 
keeps coming in and getting this because

2109
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:07,480
he wants us to go out at night

2110
01:34:07,570 --> 01:34:09,800
run hogs hound dogs

2111
01:34:10,780 --> 01:34:14,170
and what it is.
He's got a cattle ranch near okeechobee,

2112
01:34:14,171 --> 01:34:17,320
Florida and there's a,
I heard two figures,

2113
01:34:17,321 --> 01:34:19,300
55,000
or 45,000

2114
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:23,500
acre nature preserve down there.
It has a lot of rare native birds on it.

2115
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:28,501
And the nature preserves emo is they 
just acquire agricultural land when it 

2116
01:34:28,501 --> 01:34:33,181
comes up for sale and they take out the 
dike systems and put it back into bird 

2117
01:34:33,181 --> 01:34:34,630
habitat.
And it's funny because this guy actually

2118
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:38,590
has sold this preserve some of his land 
and he is putting his whole place into a

2119
01:34:38,591 --> 01:34:40,930
conservation easement so that at a time 
he was like,

2120
01:34:40,931 --> 01:34:42,280
my whole place is going to be part of 
that.

2121
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:43,720
And he was,
he was actually glad about it.

2122
01:34:43,721 --> 01:34:47,260
He liked,
he liked the preserve but a big enemy of

2123
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:52,261
the preserve as wild pigs,
which consumed a lot of ground nesting 

2124
01:34:52,261 --> 01:34:54,070
shorebird x.
So they have a guy,

2125
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:59,100
the preserve Is so tight,
so tightly administered that you can't 

2126
01:34:59,100 --> 01:34:59,100
in most areas,
you can walk around in there.

2127
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:03,890
okay.
And they haven't got a contract to kill 

2128
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:06,011
wild pigs.
So this guy has a contract where he's 

2129
01:35:06,011 --> 01:35:06,011
supposed to kill x number of pIgs every 
year.

2130
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:10,510
He can't in any way keep up with them.
This guy that has his cattle ranch lakes

2131
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:13,340
to hunt pigs and he would always go back
and hunt the,

2132
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:16,280
the boundary between his ranch and the 
preserve.

2133
01:35:16,850 --> 01:35:21,850
Because so many,
there's such a great influx of pigs 

2134
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:23,290
coming off the preserve at night,
coming down to his ranch to get into,

2135
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:25,670
you know,
less utilized land and uh,

2136
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:31,510
but it's dogs would chase them in.
The pigs have promptly run back into 

2137
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:34,691
that preserve where he can pursue him.
So he gets some hard proof fence and 

2138
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:39,971
builds a 400 acre enclosure,
a budding the preserve on the wall of 

2139
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:47,711
his fence that actually adjoins the 
preserve he puts in trapdoors hinge 

2140
01:35:49,251 --> 01:35:49,790
doors.

2141
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:55,180
Okay.
So the pigs can come in and out and so 

2142
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:55,180
they can't go out.
No.

2143
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:55,180
Well,
he,

2144
01:35:55,180 --> 01:35:56,370
he props the door open.
Okay.

2145
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,080
Any kind of watches and he's always out 
there checking for tracks and after 

2146
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:05,381
awhile you'll realize there's a lot of 
pig traffic coming out of the preserve 

2147
01:36:05,381 --> 01:36:06,190
onto his land.
Then what he'll dO,

2148
01:36:06,220 --> 01:36:11,220
he knows that they come out after dark,
they come onto his ranch and before 

2149
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:11,890
daybreak they drift back to the 
preserve,

2150
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
closes the door.
He goes out at four in the morning and 

2151
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:17,000
pop up shirts.
All those doors.

2152
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,161
He's got these doors strung out and 
strung out for like a mile every 10 

2153
01:36:21,831 --> 01:36:23,750
yards.
Stick.

2154
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:26,660
hold this thing down,
pulls all the sticks.

2155
01:36:26,661 --> 01:36:28,910
That's hIlarious.
And it cuts his dogs loose.

2156
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:34,020
Oh my god.
So we go out with him and right away we 

2157
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,010
go out logs like pitbulls or pitbull 
ask.

2158
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:38,430
I'm not good enough for dogs but not 
got.

2159
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:42,560
He's got a bloodhound over brad pitt.
He's got trailers and catchers.

2160
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:45,650
So different types of dogs.
His bloodhounds find them,

2161
01:36:45,651 --> 01:36:50,651
but they won't.
He don't like to let the bloodhounds 

2162
01:36:50,651 --> 01:36:50,651
actually catch the pig is a pig.
In fact,

2163
01:36:50,651 --> 01:36:51,310
one of his dog that really tore up.
But uM,

2164
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:56,800
then he puts a holding dog out.
Big pit bull like dog who secures To 

2165
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:01,271
pick the first pick we catch.
I mean just barely those argentino dogs 

2166
01:37:01,271 --> 01:37:05,030
to Argentina and they use them as well 
as american bulldogs to this guy.

2167
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,960
The first one we get,
it's not even dark yet.

2168
01:37:06,961 --> 01:37:07,920
And he gets,
we get one.

2169
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:12,030
It's a big boy and he's intact.
He's got his nut sack on him still.

2170
01:37:12,540 --> 01:37:15,990
And the guy that.
This one's not dogs usually pull off.

2171
01:37:16,050 --> 01:37:17,960
No,
I'm getting a little ahead of myself.

2172
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:19,790
Just just hold that piece.
May hold up.

2173
01:37:19,791 --> 01:37:24,791
He's information from it.
Not for a moment.

2174
01:37:25,131 --> 01:37:27,800
John,
and he says this,

2175
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:29,980
be any good to eat.
Like they're too lean.

2176
01:37:29,981 --> 01:37:34,981
They gotta let it testosterone.
They don't take good care of themselves 

2177
01:37:34,981 --> 01:37:35,170
and he takes his pig and it's a big pig,
you know,

2178
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:38,260
not big and not like the ones you see on
the internet,

2179
01:37:38,261 --> 01:37:43,261
but the size of 170 pound pig and he 
puts in a trailer just to confine in 

2180
01:37:43,261 --> 01:37:47,831
there.
We go out and hunt again and a violator 

2181
01:37:47,831 --> 01:37:47,831
of the dogs bus this other pig out of,
uh,

2182
01:37:47,831 --> 01:37:52,410
out of a palm grove.
They call the hammock like an island of 

2183
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:55,000
palm trees out in tHe grasslands.
And they catch it in this pigs castrated

2184
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:59,460
and a castrated like a bore that'S been 
castrated as a barrel hog.

2185
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:05,730
And the incision where they were,
the hog had been castrated is all healed

2186
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:05,910
up.

2187
01:38:06,660 --> 01:38:09,390
And they told me that we,
when we catch a boar,

2188
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:13,620
we always castrated and then turn it 
back loose because two things happen.

2189
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:17,430
One,
the pig won't procreate,

2190
01:38:17,490 --> 01:38:22,490
won't contribute to the problem that the
preserve is having the problem that he 

2191
01:38:22,490 --> 01:38:26,481
has for pigs on his land route in his 
area and it'll and it will do what he 

2192
01:38:26,481 --> 01:38:29,220
says is take his mind off grass and put 
it on,

2193
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:34,290
know,
take his mind off ass and put it on the 

2194
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:36,291
grass and he says in 90 days that will 
be fantastic eating and they'll have a 

2195
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:42,351
layer of fat on them.
So we cut the juggler on the castrated 

2196
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:46,740
pig and cut the meat and it smelled 
great and was beautiful.

2197
01:38:47,730 --> 01:38:52,730
The next day we go out with the board we
caught and they take a knife and 

2198
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:58,161
castrate that bore and turn them out 
knowing that sometime down the road 

2199
01:38:58,161 --> 01:39:02,601
they'll be lucky and catch that bar 
again and he'll be a barrel and then 

2200
01:39:02,601 --> 01:39:02,810
he'll be good to eat.
So these boys,

2201
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:04,370
these boys do this every year.

2202
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,800
How do you secure a bor?
A powerful boars head?

2203
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:14,210
Don't tell anyone dogs these dogs take 
them guys are cattle ranchers.

2204
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,190
These guys are cattle ranchers.
So they,

2205
01:39:16,200 --> 01:39:18,770
I mean it's a daily occurrence for them 
to rassle like,

2206
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:24,130
yeah,
one of the dog does it because he 

2207
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:24,130
grabbed by the ear,
grab about,

2208
01:39:24,130 --> 01:39:25,340
hadn't pinned them down.
Now the tracking dogs caught the pig and

2209
01:39:25,341 --> 01:39:27,650
the pig caught one of the tracking dogs 
real good.

2210
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:30,680
And he was going to take that dog to the
vet and I asked him,

2211
01:39:30,681 --> 01:39:34,280
I bet Your vet probably,
you know,

2212
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:39,710
doesn't like you bring in dogs that 
probably they may have gotten injured 

2213
01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:42,180
and something that the vet might regard 
as unnecessary or he goes,

2214
01:39:42,181 --> 01:39:47,181
yeah,
that's why I go to a vet who likes to 

2215
01:39:47,181 --> 01:39:47,181
run pigs with his dog.

2216
01:39:47,410 --> 01:39:52,410
Well,
once he start realizing how many pigs 

2217
01:39:52,410 --> 01:39:54,481
there are there,
especially Texas has millions oF feral 

2218
01:39:54,481 --> 01:39:54,481
pests.
Millions,

2219
01:39:54,481 --> 01:39:55,990
they have a real millions,
millions.

2220
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:57,580
They have a real problem.
Look,

2221
01:39:57,670 --> 01:39:59,170
I know you don't like that show pig,
man.

2222
01:39:59,530 --> 01:40:00,820
But the,
uh,

2223
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:02,260
I like that.
I don't say that

2224
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,700
there's just,
there's like there's a,

2225
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,200
I haven't an intellectualized having an 
aesthetic.

2226
01:40:06,201 --> 01:40:09,710
I haven't hunching aesthetic and an 
approach to wildlife that,

2227
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:11,210
that,
that,

2228
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:12,570
that,
that I,

2229
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,370
that I admire and that I tried to stand 
by.

2230
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:15,630
No,
I know you do.

2231
01:40:15,670 --> 01:40:19,680
We had long conversations about it.
So helicopter gunships or your.

2232
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:24,030
There's not mid on it.
It's not really hunting.

2233
01:40:24,031 --> 01:40:29,031
I mean what they're doing is they're 
getting away with being psychopaths and 

2234
01:40:29,031 --> 01:40:30,150
if you haven't seen it,
brian,

2235
01:40:30,151 --> 01:40:31,760
pull it up.
It's eradication.

2236
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:37,130
Pigman and ted nugent.
Shoot pigs from a helicopter on youtube.

2237
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,940
The meat to the needy,
but look,

2238
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:40,320
look.
And by the way,

2239
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:45,380
it's a real fucking problem.
They really do have to eradicate these 

2240
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:45,960
populations of pigs.
They tear up.

2241
01:40:45,961 --> 01:40:50,961
I mean they show these crops that are 
getting fucked up by these pigs in the 

2242
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,230
episode and I want to hog.
let's go hunting.

2243
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:53,980
Can we do.
Is what I wanted to ask you.

2244
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,170
What is the one with his nuts?
Tastes like?

2245
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,330
You didn't tell us that we haven't 
cooked yet.

2246
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:00,700
We're cooking it on April 25th,
but it won't be as good.

2247
01:41:00,701 --> 01:41:02,380
You don't have to think.
No,

2248
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:02,950
I'm sorry.
No,

2249
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:04,600
no,
we.

2250
01:41:04,601 --> 01:41:06,160
Okay.
On April 25th,

2251
01:41:06,220 --> 01:41:10,300
I'm cooking the castro the barrel hard 
right now.

2252
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:15,301
I have eaten boars with their nuts,
but I've never even a board that was 

2253
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:20,820
aged and as venerable is that one you 
could tell that he was a very old battle

2254
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:27,700
scarred bore and very lean and these 
guys I'm going to have eaten and thought

2255
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:32,701
it was okay.
And it might be that these guys have 

2256
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:32,701
very high expectations,
you know,

2257
01:41:32,701 --> 01:41:37,260
they pick on enough or they have a sense
of like what's best and not best the 

2258
01:41:37,260 --> 01:41:40,561
same way that uh,
you might disregard a hotdog,

2259
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,170
half a hot dog laying on the side of the
road,

2260
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:49,380
but another person might be in a 
situation where they really appreciate 

2261
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:49,380
that hot dog.

2262
01:41:49,380 --> 01:41:53,310
So for these guYs who hunt boar is a lot
like love to eat them.

2263
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:57,160
They were like,
no.

2264
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:02,350
And when I expressed interest in the 
indian tact hog being like,

2265
01:42:02,351 --> 01:42:03,310
I don't care,
I want it.

2266
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:08,670
They were so adamant that it wouldn't be
good that they were denying me getting 

2267
01:42:08,981 --> 01:42:13,981
it like they didn't want.
And it wasn't because they were in love 

2268
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:13,981
with the pig.
They're like,

2269
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:13,981
no,
no,

2270
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:13,981
no,
no,

2271
01:42:13,981 --> 01:42:17,171
no,
we'll get you good and we'll get you to 

2272
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:17,171
go.
And that was no good for you.

2273
01:42:17,171 --> 01:42:17,680
Maybe that was their,
that was their take taking more.

2274
01:42:17,681 --> 01:42:20,110
I,
I tend to like leaner meat anyway.

2275
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:22,840
I really.
But I will tell you this,

2276
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:27,160
when they do an in and I have pretty and
I've done a few,

2277
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:32,161
I've done a bit of picone and,
and they can get where they do have 

2278
01:42:32,161 --> 01:42:36,631
quite an odor to them and this board 
just stone dork,

2279
01:42:36,970 --> 01:42:41,970
you know,
but this comes from guy who will the 

2280
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:44,431
black bears that have been feeding on 
salmon and what does that like dead 

2281
01:42:44,431 --> 01:42:44,431
salmon.

2282
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:48,190
It's like ryan's saying meat.
The meat tastes like rotten salmon.

2283
01:42:48,191 --> 01:42:49,600
yeah.
Because I'm telling you man,

2284
01:42:49,601 --> 01:42:54,601
like the fat is so the fat does carries.
There's a book on the side of the harold

2285
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:59,920
mcgee's book on cooking science and lore
of the,

2286
01:42:59,950 --> 01:43:01,420
of cooking or science,
lower the kitchen.

2287
01:43:01,421 --> 01:43:06,421
He has an explanation there.
Why animal fat is such a reliable 

2288
01:43:06,421 --> 01:43:11,210
indicator of what the animal's been up 
to and I should read that on your own.

2289
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:13,150
Yeah.
Refer your listeners to that rather than

2290
01:43:13,151 --> 01:43:18,151
try to explain it myself,
but you get on your show when you van 

2291
01:43:18,151 --> 01:43:21,890
bear with that and eaten blue runner as 
it's just like unbelievable and you can 

2292
01:43:21,890 --> 01:43:25,561
just drink the fat.
You can melt the fat and drink and it 

2293
01:43:25,561 --> 01:43:25,561
tastes good.
Now the fat on a salmon berry,

2294
01:43:25,561 --> 01:43:30,320
you really have to carefully,
and this is in the spring when they 

2295
01:43:30,320 --> 01:43:31,810
haven't actually eaten a salmon in six 
months or something yet.

2296
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,890
The very carefully trim that fat away.
Then the flesh becomes more palatable,

2297
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,430
but it's just like kind of atrocious.
And I got a friend of Montana,

2298
01:43:39,431 --> 01:43:42,400
he shot a bear over overwrought and 
cowen time.

2299
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:44,860
same thing.
He thought it was nearlY inevitable.

2300
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:48,070
So what do you do when that,
when you have that situation,

2301
01:43:48,071 --> 01:43:50,380
do you continue to eat the animal jam 
and respect?

2302
01:43:50,410 --> 01:43:52,370
Like if something.
If I'm eating meat,

2303
01:43:52,371 --> 01:43:53,780
that's great.
Okay.

2304
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:58,840
Super high quality meat.
I cook it in a high quality way where I 

2305
01:43:58,840 --> 01:43:59,050
do as little as possible.
I'll take a lot like,

2306
01:43:59,060 --> 01:44:01,220
you know,
we ate some pretty straight up meat when

2307
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:02,950
we were out,
right?

2308
01:44:03,710 --> 01:44:08,630
Like just like me,
malicious to warm with salt on it,

2309
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:09,850
you know,
so a good meal.

2310
01:44:09,860 --> 01:44:12,410
I'll do that if I get an animal that's 
funky.

2311
01:44:12,430 --> 01:44:15,020
I and I killed it.
I killed a female pig one time.

2312
01:44:15,020 --> 01:44:17,240
That was probably one of the worst game 
animals I've ever done.

2313
01:44:17,510 --> 01:44:18,560
A,
I'm just going to eat it.

2314
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:20,810
Okay.
It's like for me,

2315
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,890
any displeasure I experienced eating 
off,

2316
01:44:24,891 --> 01:44:29,891
tasting flesh isn't as bad as the 
displeasure that I would experience from

2317
01:44:30,140 --> 01:44:34,070
having killed a big game animal and not 
consumed.

2318
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:39,130
That's a very great statement.
So I'm going to eat it and then whether 

2319
01:44:39,130 --> 01:44:40,490
I make pepperoni sticks,
if it's bad,

2320
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,930
I make pepperoni sticks.
I eat thing,

2321
01:44:44,100 --> 01:44:45,920
you know?
And I haven't always done it.

2322
01:44:45,921 --> 01:44:48,710
Like I explained to you many times.
I used a lot of fur trapping,

2323
01:44:49,210 --> 01:44:54,210
sell animal furs,
but now at this point in my life and 

2324
01:44:54,210 --> 01:44:55,310
like my relationship with the hunting,
now I,

2325
01:44:56,180 --> 01:44:58,310
you know,
like to eat what I hunt for,

2326
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,880
to the point.
I mean we ate a coyote not long ago down

2327
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:01,400
in Mexico.

2328
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:08,150
How you're the only person on the 
planet.

2329
01:45:08,430 --> 01:45:10,210
I did this.
What's great about the podcast,

2330
01:45:10,540 --> 01:45:15,540
and we had this weird as saying,
I killed people sometimes.

2331
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:20,560
Oh my god,
why don't you eat a coyote?

2332
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:25,600
That's great people.
So often I get it

2333
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:32,460
asked like as the guide is eating stuff,
I get asked all the time like what is it

2334
01:45:32,501 --> 01:45:33,760
like to eat this,
eat that.

2335
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:39,300
And I have field the question about 
what's kyle's so many times that I 

2336
01:45:39,671 --> 01:45:41,740
started to feel like it was 
professional,

2337
01:45:42,190 --> 01:45:45,580
like malfeasance for me to not have a 
good answer,

2338
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:46,870
you know,

2339
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:49,890
national malfeasance.
We've not have a good answer.

2340
01:45:49,891 --> 01:45:51,860
What a fucking coYote.
So it's like

2341
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:56,950
as professional development I wanted to 
know and we got a coyote and a.

2342
01:45:56,990 --> 01:46:01,350
So you have to eat the whole coyote now 
in your mind you we ate like,

2343
01:46:01,380 --> 01:46:06,380
well there's a handful of us there and 
we put the vast majority of that thing 

2344
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:06,740
down and

2345
01:46:07,370 --> 01:46:11,370
that has been burned the hair off.
Oh,

2346
01:46:11,670 --> 01:46:12,990
we burned all off it

2347
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:15,160
and enroll enrolls.
Wow.

2348
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:17,670
It was skin on what it tastes like.
Well I got a,

2349
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:22,830
like the best description.
I steal this from my body ramey warrant.

2350
01:46:23,311 --> 01:46:28,311
I was homeless and ramey warrant tastes 
that and this is the esoteric 

2351
01:46:28,311 --> 01:46:29,210
comparison,
remy warren and tasted that.

2352
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,920
He's a hunting guide and he said,
uh,

2353
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:35,370
it tastes like overcooked diver.

2354
01:46:39,570 --> 01:46:42,770
No know you explained this to us on the 
trip to die.

2355
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,060
There's diver ducks and floaters that 
with a call.

2356
01:46:46,061 --> 01:46:46,820
The other ones?
Yeah,

2357
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:47,300
like

2358
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,650
a,
like a non

2359
01:46:50,030 --> 01:46:55,030
a taxonomy would with docs.
It'd be like a puddle ducks and diver 

2360
01:46:56,401 --> 01:46:58,570
ducks and,
or people call them dabbler duck.

2361
01:46:58,571 --> 01:47:03,571
So docs that don't go underwater to hunt
and the ducks that eat fish are the ones

2362
01:47:04,351 --> 01:47:09,351
who don't want divers eat a lot.
Divers eat a lot more animal matter and 

2363
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:12,090
diver ducks and puddle ducks eat a lot 
more vegetation.

2364
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:14,750
You that expression and overcooked 
diver.

2365
01:47:14,751 --> 01:47:18,060
Doug totally made sense.
Folks on the subway right now going,

2366
01:47:18,070 --> 01:47:21,690
I don't know what.
Fuck this guy's a fucking over.

2367
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:26,700
Could do that.
The next tiMe I eat something I don't 

2368
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:26,700
like.
I'm going To back man.

2369
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:30,751
This tastes a lot like divert.
yeah.

2370
01:47:31,650 --> 01:47:33,090
You had a couple shots,
uh,

2371
01:47:33,091 --> 01:47:33,750
on the uh,
the,

2372
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,780
the show at,
uh,

2373
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:35,950
at pheasants too,
right?

2374
01:47:36,010 --> 01:47:38,630
We couldn't quite get it.
what do they call those?

2375
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:42,790
Realize that some ducks are carnivorous.
I never thought carnivorous

2376
01:47:42,890 --> 01:47:45,740
and even some puddle ducks,
some puddle.

2377
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,590
Dr dabber dogs eat a lot of plant 
matter,

2378
01:47:48,591 --> 01:47:53,591
so of the puddle ducks,
one of the like one of the not great 

2379
01:47:53,591 --> 01:47:56,510
tasting ones as a northern shoveler in 
northern shovelers.

2380
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:01,600
Eat a lot of animal matter,
but you can take the bag like the best 

2381
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:01,600
duck on the planet in my mind,
be like,

2382
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:06,430
I love mallard ducks,
but if you get mallard ducks in 

2383
01:48:06,430 --> 01:48:06,430
southeast Alaska,
like near my cabin,

2384
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:10,040
you can barely eat those mallard ducks 
because even though they're mallards and

2385
01:48:10,041 --> 01:48:12,410
in most areas they taste great and 
southeast Alaska,

2386
01:48:12,411 --> 01:48:17,411
those mallards in the in the late summer
or just sitting there hammering 

2387
01:48:17,411 --> 01:48:18,010
invertebrates,
so they're.

2388
01:48:18,011 --> 01:48:23,011
ThEy're hunting the tide line,
eating expose invertebrates up and down 

2389
01:48:23,011 --> 01:48:24,710
there and to get those docs and it 
tastes like kyle.

2390
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:31,130
They're eating invertebrates,
meaning meaning a clam

2391
01:48:32,110 --> 01:48:35,590
little little insects and you know 
people

2392
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:40,700
who who don't understand modern methods 
of farming and the way that animals are 

2393
01:48:41,470 --> 01:48:46,470
fed and the foods that they're fed don't
understand the whole corn versus grass 

2394
01:48:46,470 --> 01:48:47,740
fed debate.
It's becoming such become a,

2395
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:53,010
we've talked about so many times in the 
podcast that people like hashtag things 

2396
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:53,010
grass fed when it has nothing to do with
it.

2397
01:48:53,010 --> 01:48:54,220
They're just being silly,
you know,

2398
01:48:54,221 --> 01:48:59,221
but counselors are supposed to be 
fucking grass and when you give a 

2399
01:48:59,221 --> 01:48:59,410
counselor corn it,
the whole thing is,

2400
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:01,440
it's like giving a person that corn,
right?

2401
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:03,820
Like we get fat as fuck,
you know,

2402
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:05,290
cows,
syrup and shit.

2403
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:10,090
That's why they have four stomachs or 
whatever it is to break down that grass.

2404
01:49:10,130 --> 01:49:12,790
Not only that,
I bet you the corn doesn't grow as good.

2405
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:15,310
Magic mushrooms,
a batch of the corn poop.

2406
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:20,350
I bet it's a fucking mess.
It's not grass pumped through the 

2407
01:49:20,350 --> 01:49:20,910
stomach of a double annually.

2408
01:49:21,100 --> 01:49:23,920
Cow corn.
We're using big words.

2409
01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:28,570
You used to wear a poor fucker eating 
corn grown abscesses in his body.

2410
01:49:28,780 --> 01:49:29,940
Have you ever seen that?
A food.

2411
01:49:30,220 --> 01:49:31,960
That's why they have to.
They grow their livers.

2412
01:49:31,961 --> 01:49:36,961
Abscess.
That's why they have to give them an 

2413
01:49:36,961 --> 01:49:36,961
antibiotic.
Meanwhile,

2414
01:49:36,961 --> 01:49:36,961
goddamn,
it's delicious.

2415
01:49:36,961 --> 01:49:38,230
That's a problem.
It's so good.

2416
01:49:38,231 --> 01:49:40,780
A good ribeye,
a fatty corn fed rib eye.

2417
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:43,300
Oh,
it's perfect.

2418
01:49:43,301 --> 01:49:46,390
Like when I'm feeling healthy and um,
I like grass fed,

2419
01:49:46,600 --> 01:49:48,430
I like grass fed,
sirloin,

2420
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,680
lean,
you know,

2421
01:49:50,620 --> 01:49:55,620
but the best meat I've ever had in my 
life was a grass fed with a corn fed rib

2422
01:49:57,551 --> 01:50:00,940
eye from whole foods.
And I cooked that and I'm telling you,

2423
01:50:00,941 --> 01:50:03,740
me and my buddy had it and it was,
it was just high.

2424
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:05,970
I wasn't obviously,
I was sober.

2425
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,240
I think the best meat I've ever eaten in
my life was two things.

2426
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:12,560
One,
the liver and the heart of that,

2427
01:50:12,610 --> 01:50:17,610
that deer that we ate when we were 
sitting there by a campfire chopping up 

2428
01:50:17,610 --> 01:50:19,000
and we had to cut around the bullet 
hole.

2429
01:50:19,030 --> 01:50:24,030
We were also angry though,
and we'd spent three days eating those 

2430
01:50:24,030 --> 01:50:26,260
bad mountain bath doesn't adopt.
I'm telling you,

2431
01:50:26,261 --> 01:50:31,261
I thought that those mountain bags,
we're going to taste way worse than I 

2432
01:50:31,261 --> 01:50:31,261
thought.
I thought they were delicious.

2433
01:50:31,261 --> 01:50:32,360
It's situational.
Yeah.

2434
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,360
Yeah.
But it's not as good as the meat.

2435
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:35,290
No.
We work with a guy.

2436
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:36,740
We were a good guy.
And um,

2437
01:50:37,100 --> 01:50:38,740
he's like,
I don't care about food.

2438
01:50:39,010 --> 01:50:42,550
I just want to be full and then go do 
what I want to do,

2439
01:50:43,090 --> 01:50:44,980
and so he's always talking about.
He's like,

2440
01:50:44,981 --> 01:50:49,981
yeah,
I'll be home and I'll be home and I'll 

2441
01:50:49,981 --> 01:50:49,981
eat freeze dried food because it's just 
more efficient for me.

2442
01:50:49,981 --> 01:50:52,060
I just want to be done and then go do 
what I want to do.

2443
01:50:52,150 --> 01:50:57,150
Well,
I can understand being obsessed with 

2444
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:57,150
something else,
but you know,

2445
01:50:57,150 --> 01:50:57,580
you can enjoy food as well.
Yeah,

2446
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:59,710
dumb.
Fuck jesus christ.

2447
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:01,330
I like foods.
Awesome.

2448
01:51:01,470 --> 01:51:02,800
My buddies,
my buddies,

2449
01:51:02,801 --> 01:51:07,801
a stunt man,
it hit the back of his head in an 

2450
01:51:07,801 --> 01:51:09,391
accident and he lost his sense of smell 
and taste and he doesn't care that much 

2451
01:51:09,391 --> 01:51:14,071
about food.
That dude probably eats ass like a 

2452
01:51:14,071 --> 01:51:15,590
champion.
Can't seem to be the greatest ass eater,

2453
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:20,650
the universe who's going to a big deal.
I know timmy burgeoning me broke one 

2454
01:51:24,641 --> 01:51:25,180
time,
said to me,

2455
01:51:25,181 --> 01:51:26,050
he goes,
he goes,

2456
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,420
I said,
uh,

2457
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:29,620
he sits on like,
I hate her ass.

2458
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:30,790
And I kind of made a face.
He goes,

2459
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:36,270
what's the matter?
You don't stick your telling them it 

2460
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:36,270
grows as you're going to get shit on 
your tongue.

2461
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:38,020
So fucking what?
I can't talk to you,

2462
01:51:38,021 --> 01:51:40,390
and he just walked away.
I never said anything.

2463
01:51:40,391 --> 01:51:45,070
All I did was make a little face.
He natural to make that face.

2464
01:51:45,071 --> 01:51:50,071
Unless you've had four jack and cokes 
and been in that situation where you 

2465
01:51:50,071 --> 01:51:50,071
really try to impress a girl.

2466
01:51:51,890 --> 01:51:55,150
We've all gotten in that sexual herzon 
sun.

2467
01:51:55,151 --> 01:51:56,350
You're getting that frenzy where you're 
like,

2468
01:51:56,410 --> 01:52:00,190
do you have that video of the ted nugent
pigman adventures?

2469
01:52:00,250 --> 01:52:02,400
Whether there's just like a 32nd.
Yeah,

2470
01:52:02,410 --> 01:52:03,790
that's fine.
Check this.

2471
01:52:04,200 --> 01:52:06,850
I want steve reno's take on this.
If you've never seen this before,

2472
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:12,060
ted nugent and pigman are in a fucking 
helicopter and the fucking crazy.

2473
01:52:13,510 --> 01:52:16,500
It's now legal to hunt in Texas from 
helicopters.

2474
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:23,990
It is one of the most entertaining 
episodes of any television show I've 

2475
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:29,821
ever seen in my life,
is watching ted nugent and pigment take 

2476
01:52:29,821 --> 01:52:31,510
out wild hogs from a fucking helicopter.
I'm like,

2477
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:35,230
this is some shit that after the fall of
America,

2478
01:52:35,470 --> 01:52:38,620
a thousand years from now when they're 
trying to decode our history,

2479
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:40,370
they're going to watch that,
that thing.

2480
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:45,900
Holy fuck.
They were flying in helicopters joking 

2481
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,250
around about head shots.
He killed it.

2482
01:52:47,450 --> 01:52:49,910
He killed 455 pigs that day.

2483
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:50,720
No.
Yeah,

2484
01:52:51,090 --> 01:52:52,460
yeah.
Fifty five.

2485
01:52:53,050 --> 01:52:55,590
That's a lot of pigs.
Ted nugent killed Florida.

2486
01:52:56,530 --> 01:52:59,630
She from a helicopter or bill maher for 
bill maher.

2487
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,490
Bill maher's,
very frantic hunting.

2488
01:53:01,491 --> 01:53:03,690
Or he's in peta.
Bill maher.

2489
01:53:04,430 --> 01:53:07,070
Bill morrow supports peta,
which by the way,

2490
01:53:07,071 --> 01:53:10,120
kills more cats and dogs in anybody,
you know,

2491
01:53:10,160 --> 01:53:11,610
96 percent of the,
uh,

2492
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,450
animals that come into the shelter.
I put them down,

2493
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:15,290
which is,
you know,

2494
01:53:15,291 --> 01:53:17,000
I just don't even know what to say about
that.

2495
01:53:17,010 --> 01:53:18,440
That's like,
they get so crazy.

2496
01:53:18,441 --> 01:53:23,441
It's like,
when is it okay to kill and what was it 

2497
01:53:23,441 --> 01:53:23,441
not okay to kill?
You're killing puppies and you're mad at

2498
01:53:23,441 --> 01:53:25,220
people that are killing deer and they're
eating them.

2499
01:53:25,221 --> 01:53:27,440
Like,
I am losing the script here because that

2500
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:30,290
doesn't even make any fucking sense.
That's one of the craziest,

2501
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:35,050
most ridiculously hypocritical they 
never heard of him was what do you mean

2502
01:53:36,670 --> 01:53:38,530
drop when people go to [inaudible] and 
say,

2503
01:53:38,531 --> 01:53:40,000
you know,
I've got a stray dog here.

2504
01:53:40,001 --> 01:53:40,450
I found,
you know,

2505
01:53:40,451 --> 01:53:40,870
my,
my,

2506
01:53:40,890 --> 01:53:42,490
my puppy,
my dog just had puppies.

2507
01:53:42,491 --> 01:53:47,491
I don't know what to do with them.
I'll give them to the animal lovers at 

2508
01:53:47,491 --> 01:53:48,790
peta.
These dogs die like most of them

2509
01:53:48,920 --> 01:53:51,380
they put down because they have to 
because they don't have the resources to

2510
01:53:51,381 --> 01:53:55,880
take care of those dogs,
but that doesn't matter when you,

2511
01:53:55,910 --> 01:54:00,910
when you're looking at,
I don't care if you don't have the 

2512
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:00,910
resources.
You're killing puppies and cats.

2513
01:54:00,910 --> 01:54:01,730
Okay,
and by the way,

2514
01:54:01,731 --> 01:54:05,030
you try to keep it secret to you.
Don't go advertising and telling people,

2515
01:54:05,031 --> 01:54:05,600
hey,
listen,

2516
01:54:05,810 --> 01:54:08,080
if you don't come down and take these 
things as pads,

2517
01:54:08,081 --> 01:54:09,170
we're going to kill them.
No,

2518
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:12,170
you're doing it on the sneak tip and 
people have to find out about it through

2519
01:54:12,171 --> 01:54:17,171
the internet and then on top of that,
you're criticizing people that are 

2520
01:54:17,171 --> 01:54:20,771
hunting and feeding their family with 
what they know to be a really healthy 

2521
01:54:20,771 --> 01:54:23,780
animal.
Instead of this mystery fucking chain of

2522
01:54:23,781 --> 01:54:28,781
command that happens when you buy a 
cheeseburger from burger king or 

2523
01:54:28,781 --> 01:54:31,850
wherever with name your fast food joint.
Who knows what the fuck happened to that

2524
01:54:31,851 --> 01:54:34,910
cow before it was converted into 
cheeseburgers?

2525
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:36,710
You know,
you don't know a goddamn thing,

2526
01:54:36,860 --> 01:54:41,860
but the fact that they would go after 
one while killing puppies and kittens,

2527
01:54:41,871 --> 01:54:43,250
that's,
that's insanity.

2528
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:45,500
That's,
that is insanity.

2529
01:54:46,020 --> 01:54:48,270
You know,
a thing that rings false to me.

2530
01:54:48,450 --> 01:54:49,710
And,
and you know,

2531
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:51,260
I'm walking on like I got,
I got,

2532
01:54:51,261 --> 01:54:54,060
I got to tread delicately here on the 
issue of,

2533
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:54,860
of,
of,

2534
01:54:55,050 --> 01:54:57,130
of the helicopter thing.
Hm.

2535
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:57,610
But

2536
01:54:58,710 --> 01:55:00,340
well no,
the awesomeness of it.

2537
01:55:00,370 --> 01:55:02,590
One thing that rings false to me though 
is when

2538
01:55:02,710 --> 01:55:07,710
guys like when guys do so hard to cook,
it's like no matter what you think,

2539
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:14,940
it's like dan,
if you do damned if you don't try to go 

2540
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:14,940
for it.
When someone does,

2541
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:18,920
if someone goes out and shoots a bunch 
of something because it's there,

2542
01:55:18,930 --> 01:55:23,930
they're overpopulated for a rancher.
It's like in some way you have to be 

2543
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:28,210
self honest to and acknowledge that 
you're not just doing an altruistic act.

2544
01:55:28,650 --> 01:55:30,310
You know,
like I enjoy the hunt,

2545
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:35,370
you know,
so when I have my body's ranch in 

2546
01:55:35,370 --> 01:55:37,771
California,
I'm glad that he figures he has too many

2547
01:55:38,051 --> 01:55:43,051
pics because it allows me to go pig 
hunting and I liked to go pig,

2548
01:55:43,590 --> 01:55:44,070
I like to

2549
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:46,530
eat pigs,
but I would never like,

2550
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:48,570
I don't then say to my wife,
I'm like,

2551
01:55:48,630 --> 01:55:50,790
ah,
I really don't want to do it,

2552
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:56,570
but my body's in trouble.
He's got a lot of pigs and I'm going to 

2553
01:55:56,570 --> 01:56:01,041
go out and as much as it's going to be a
drag I'm going to go out and help him 

2554
01:56:01,041 --> 01:56:04,650
because we need to fight our way through
this pig problem and we all need to give

2555
01:56:04,651 --> 01:56:07,050
our share because if my buddy had called
me and said,

2556
01:56:07,051 --> 01:56:12,051
you know,
I got a real problem with my fences are 

2557
01:56:12,051 --> 01:56:14,241
down.
Can you come out and spend a weekend 

2558
01:56:14,241 --> 01:56:16,821
fixing all my fences?
That really is the problem I have right 

2559
01:56:16,821 --> 01:56:16,821
now.
I'd be like,

2560
01:56:16,821 --> 01:56:16,821
no.

2561
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:20,760
What are those pigs up to you having a 
problem with them?

2562
01:56:22,310 --> 01:56:24,190
It's natural to.
First of all,

2563
01:56:24,850 --> 01:56:29,850
the hunting them is natural and the 
dealing with the overpopulation is a 

2564
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:32,950
real issue for people that do have farms
and do have ranches like you got to deal

2565
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:37,951
with that and to get bullshit to take,
to take crap from people that are 

2566
01:56:37,951 --> 01:56:38,800
killing puppies and kittens like,
man,

2567
01:56:38,801 --> 01:56:40,330
we need to come to an understanding 
here.

2568
01:56:40,331 --> 01:56:42,210
Here's the real issue.
It's not pizza.

2569
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,710
It's not the problem of being ethical 
towards animals.

2570
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:50,280
It's crazy assholes that do illogical 
shit and that's the problem with a lot 

2571
01:56:51,221 --> 01:56:56,221
of animal activist.
That's the problem with a lot of people 

2572
01:56:56,221 --> 01:56:56,500
that claim to love animals more than 
they love people.

2573
01:56:56,740 --> 01:57:01,740
You're out of your mind.
If you love a dog more than you love 

2574
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:01,740
people,
you're out of your mind,

2575
01:57:01,740 --> 01:57:02,890
your body,
your mind you.

2576
01:57:02,920 --> 01:57:05,290
That's a one way relationship.
Jesus christ,

2577
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:07,470
that thing doesn't talk to you about 
stuff.

2578
01:57:07,471 --> 01:57:11,020
It doesn't challenge you on issues.
It doesn't tell you it loves you.

2579
01:57:11,021 --> 01:57:15,100
It doesn't help you grow.
It's goddamn dog and I love my dogs,

2580
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:19,210
but you're crazy if you like animals 
more than people and the people that are

2581
01:57:19,211 --> 01:57:22,390
involved on a,
just for whatever reason,

2582
01:57:22,391 --> 01:57:24,220
there's a certain percentage,
it's not all of them,

2583
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:29,520
but a certain percentage of people that 
are involved in animal rights movements 

2584
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:33,480
have a distorted perception of the 
relationship between humans and animals 

2585
01:57:33,940 --> 01:57:36,790
and their relationship is not one of 
admiration and respect.

2586
01:57:36,970 --> 01:57:38,410
It becomes what you were talking about 
though.

2587
01:57:38,411 --> 01:57:42,120
The anthropomorphic sort of a thing.
It's like it's bambi or it's like,

2588
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:44,950
you know,
I saw someone who was talking about when

2589
01:57:44,951 --> 01:57:46,480
the mountain lion got shot in santa 
monica,

2590
01:57:47,010 --> 01:57:49,090
you know,
they should fucking shoot people.

2591
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:52,150
I'd be happier if some,
a person was shot and that mountain lion

2592
01:57:52,370 --> 01:57:55,450
like that was on the mountain lion in 
fucking santa monica.

2593
01:57:55,451 --> 01:57:58,300
Man.
Santa monica is really urban.

2594
01:57:58,301 --> 01:57:58,990
Yeah.
Okay.

2595
01:57:58,991 --> 01:58:01,210
There's no parks,
there's no parks.

2596
01:58:01,211 --> 01:58:03,940
There's no giant places where there's 
all trees.

2597
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,220
There's no central park in santa monica.

2598
01:58:06,470 --> 01:58:11,470
Years ago,
few years ago there was a black bear in 

2599
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:11,470
bergen county,
New Jersey.

2600
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:14,260
Do you remember that?
North jersey and same thing.

2601
01:58:14,740 --> 01:58:18,340
That's what joey diaz is,
you know,

2602
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:23,350
you gotta,
you gotta black bear wandering around 

2603
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:23,350
hoboken,
hoboken.

2604
01:58:23,350 --> 01:58:26,020
Fuck.
Where are you from?

2605
01:58:26,170 --> 01:58:28,630
Oklahoma.
Jesus christ.

2606
01:58:28,900 --> 01:58:30,640
Sorry about that.
Might be for North Korea.

2607
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,110
What is your background?
So infiltrated our defensive.

2608
01:58:35,140 --> 01:58:37,240
So here's,
here's my excuse for how I mispronounced

2609
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,350
what does it?
Hoboken.

2610
01:58:38,351 --> 01:58:40,530
Hoboken,
hoboken says New York times.

2611
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:41,890
So I've got a little bit of a,

2612
01:58:42,070 --> 01:58:44,890
of a,
a beef with hoboken because when I was a

2613
01:58:44,891 --> 01:58:46,930
kid I lived in ridgewood,
New Jersey for a year.

2614
01:58:47,410 --> 01:58:52,410
Ridgewood had a law on the books that 
said you can actually not play video 

2615
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:55,591
games until you were 16 years old.
There was a ban on video games in 

2616
01:58:55,591 --> 01:58:55,591
ridgewood,
New Jersey.

2617
01:58:55,600 --> 01:59:00,600
So as an eight year old in north jersey,
I had to go to hoboken to a diner to 

2618
01:59:01,241 --> 01:59:05,320
play a german version of pac man.
So when I think of hoboken,

2619
01:59:05,321 --> 01:59:06,520
I don't really think of how to pronounce
it.

2620
01:59:06,521 --> 01:59:11,521
I just think of my,
my fond memories of a german version of 

2621
01:59:11,521 --> 01:59:11,740
pac man with the name of the ghosts were
like,

2622
01:59:11,741 --> 01:59:15,990
you know,
18 characters long and you know,

2623
01:59:16,330 --> 01:59:18,490
so that's the thing.
I think diners,

2624
01:59:18,491 --> 01:59:23,491
I think black bears,
I think pac man think hoboken and joe 

2625
01:59:23,491 --> 01:59:23,980
rogan will kick my ass if I ever missed.
So there's the issue,

2626
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:25,900
there was a bear in that area

2627
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:31,480
there.
There've been bear sightings in every 

2628
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:31,480
county in New Jersey,
every county in New Jersey.

2629
01:59:31,570 --> 01:59:35,080
And they just made bear hunting legal in
the last half a decade or so.

2630
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:35,900
Right?
Yeah,

2631
01:59:35,901 --> 01:59:38,030
it was illegal for a long time.
They brought it back.

2632
01:59:38,060 --> 01:59:41,030
Um,
and then when a couple of years ago when

2633
01:59:41,031 --> 01:59:46,031
core zine was governor,
they put a stop to it again over the 

2634
01:59:46,031 --> 01:59:47,200
objections of the wildlife commission.
They're in the state.

2635
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:50,330
And how do you get wildlife commissions?
That's what drives me crazy.

2636
01:59:50,510 --> 01:59:55,510
How do you get wildlife commissions that
are run by people who are animal rights 

2637
01:59:55,510 --> 01:59:57,890
activists and why does that happen?
And how is that possible that,

2638
01:59:57,891 --> 01:59:58,330
that happened?

2639
01:59:58,380 --> 02:00:00,320
You got it in California right now 
because you know,

2640
02:00:00,440 --> 02:00:02,900
the governor,
uh,

2641
02:00:02,980 --> 02:00:07,980
points so many people and they're going 
to have so many hunters and now they're 

2642
02:00:07,980 --> 02:00:08,530
gonna bring a,
you know,

2643
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:09,210
they're going to say,
well,

2644
02:00:09,211 --> 02:00:10,860
okay,
so the 100 is get a seat at the table,

2645
02:00:11,070 --> 02:00:16,070
but we also have to have the animal 
rights activists have a seat at the 

2646
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:16,070
table too.

2647
02:00:16,070 --> 02:00:18,570
But the idea that they're trying to mean
an animal rights activist,

2648
02:00:18,571 --> 02:00:20,190
it's automatically going to be anti 
hunting.

2649
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,260
Right?
Absolutely.

2650
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:27,080
It just doesn't make any sense that 
someone could be in charge of wildlife 

2651
02:00:27,080 --> 02:00:27,600
management.
It'd be anti hunting.

2652
02:00:27,601 --> 02:00:30,090
That sounds.
That's what that is,

2653
02:00:30,091 --> 02:00:34,530
is this convenient ignorance that a lot 
of people that don't understand wildlife

2654
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:35,770
have.
And I,

2655
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:38,810
I didn't until I started getting into it
before I started paying attention,

2656
02:00:38,850 --> 02:00:43,850
whatever it was,
a decade started paying wildlife 

2657
02:00:43,850 --> 02:00:45,840
management councils,
et cetera,

2658
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:50,280
have done a pretty good job of doing 
their job.

2659
02:00:50,730 --> 02:00:52,680
And I don't,
not in liberal states though.

2660
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:54,990
The issue is when states,
like in California,

2661
02:00:54,991 --> 02:00:59,991
where they're making logical decisions 
like the lack of dogs and black bear and

2662
02:01:00,001 --> 02:01:05,001
in a mountain lion hunts,
they're hard enough to fucking kill and 

2663
02:01:05,001 --> 02:01:06,480
to control the population and especially
when you're dealing with predators,

2664
02:01:06,690 --> 02:01:11,690
like you have a responsibility as a 
human being to keep the population in 

2665
02:01:11,690 --> 02:01:16,551
control.
I'm not saying you should run them to 

2666
02:01:16,551 --> 02:01:16,551
the point of extinction,
but you have.

2667
02:01:16,551 --> 02:01:18,900
I think every human in a community has 
a,

2668
02:01:18,960 --> 02:01:21,840
if,
if possible to control predators.

2669
02:01:21,870 --> 02:01:23,100
You should.
There should.

2670
02:01:23,130 --> 02:01:25,980
There's a responsibility to keep a 
certain,

2671
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:31,550
a certain amount of control on the 
situation and when you start doing shit 

2672
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:31,550
like saying,
well,

2673
02:01:31,550 --> 02:01:34,380
you can't hunting with dogs or you can't
do this or you can't do that,

2674
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:35,820
you,
you what?

2675
02:01:35,821 --> 02:01:36,900
You should be.
What should be as.

2676
02:01:36,901 --> 02:01:38,850
How many numbers are they killing?
Okay.

2677
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:39,980
And there's not a

2678
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,410
lot of mountain lions getting killed.
It's not easy to do.

2679
02:01:42,680 --> 02:01:44,000
You know,
they're not in danger,

2680
02:01:44,001 --> 02:01:44,720
right?
No,

2681
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:46,100
not dangerous anymore.

2682
02:01:47,090 --> 02:01:50,630
Right.
Now you're seeing an expansion and range

2683
02:01:50,670 --> 02:01:55,670
and it's different than what people 
think because some of the states that 

2684
02:01:55,670 --> 02:02:00,431
have the most heavy hunting for mountain
lions are actually turning out to be 

2685
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:05,330
areas that are population sources,
so there's a movement right now was just

2686
02:02:05,331 --> 02:02:10,331
reading this paper recently where they 
were doing some work on lines and they 

2687
02:02:10,331 --> 02:02:14,220
were thinking that with the abundance of
lions in California with the loss of 

2688
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:20,501
hound hunting that they would be seeing 
californian lions going into phil 

2689
02:02:22,460 --> 02:02:27,460
ecosystems vacated by harvested lines in
Nevada with their fine and instead is in

2690
02:02:28,131 --> 02:02:33,131
spite of all the basin and range country
in Nevada in spite of the hunting is 

2691
02:02:33,231 --> 02:02:38,231
still able to produce lines and they're 
seeing lions going in a different 

2692
02:02:38,231 --> 02:02:38,660
direction.
They're seen lions going,

2693
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:43,820
spreading out displaced young males 
spreading out from Nevada into 

2694
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:43,820
California.
No,

2695
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:48,250
it could be two things.
It could be somehow that their buddy 

2696
02:02:48,250 --> 02:02:49,040
called him in from California and said,
dude,

2697
02:02:49,041 --> 02:02:49,760
come here.

2698
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:53,670
They will not mess with you.
These people are soft.

2699
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,420
I'd use dogs.
I don't know what it is,

2700
02:02:57,421 --> 02:02:58,530
but so much stuff

2701
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:04,450
like there's always something that 
violates all your expectations into the 

2702
02:03:04,450 --> 02:03:08,271
answer.
Like do state fish and game agencies do 

2703
02:03:08,271 --> 02:03:08,271
their job?
I have no one,

2704
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:13,400
no one has complete faith in everything,
but in general I have a lot of faith in 

2705
02:03:15,180 --> 02:03:18,900
state fish and game agencies and you 
guys have all had the luxury,

2706
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,960
like I have the travel around the world 
a fair bit and I used to have this naive

2707
02:03:24,361 --> 02:03:29,361
idea that you'd go to a developing 
nation and it would be that you'd 

2708
02:03:29,361 --> 02:03:32,640
experienced this great abundance of 
wildlife.

2709
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:34,020
It's just in your mind.
It's like,

2710
02:03:34,050 --> 02:03:36,690
oh,
it's like back in time somehow.

2711
02:03:36,810 --> 02:03:38,070
You know,
I remember like the first time I went to

2712
02:03:38,071 --> 02:03:39,780
Philippines,
the Philippines do a magazine story.

2713
02:03:39,781 --> 02:03:44,781
I brought my snorkeling mask and I 
thought it'd just be this explosion of 

2714
02:03:44,781 --> 02:03:45,240
sea life,
you know,

2715
02:03:45,300 --> 02:03:50,300
but in fact it's not because they use 
cyanide to fish on the reefs and they go

2716
02:03:52,501 --> 02:03:57,501
to a fish market there and the fisher 
and inch long tops or they or it's 

2717
02:03:57,501 --> 02:04:01,161
either there's a bunch of inch long fish
or they've just jogged into big whale 

2718
02:04:01,161 --> 02:04:01,320
shark and they're hacking the department
machetes.

2719
02:04:01,350 --> 02:04:06,350
Okay.
So it's like the reality is is that the 

2720
02:04:06,350 --> 02:04:09,150
us,
we have very progressive game management

2721
02:04:09,690 --> 02:04:13,170
and we have like a hundred base 
management system in the us.

2722
02:04:13,171 --> 02:04:15,360
When you factor in how many people live 
here,

2723
02:04:15,570 --> 02:04:19,110
where we're at in a technological sense 
where we're at in an economic sense,

2724
02:04:19,380 --> 02:04:22,500
it almost doesn't make sense that we 
have the wildlife we have,

2725
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:27,560
we do a phenomenal job and there's a 
richness of wildlife in the United 

2726
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:30,090
States of America that's unparalleled by
any country in a similar situation.

2727
02:04:30,420 --> 02:04:31,850
There's nothing to compare it to me.
Let me

2728
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:33,110
pick it back and I don't want to 
interrupt you,

2729
02:04:33,111 --> 02:04:38,111
but now you did the us.
The us also has been really responsible 

2730
02:04:38,111 --> 02:04:38,111
for many,

2731
02:04:38,111 --> 02:04:39,120
many years.
Also,

2732
02:04:39,490 --> 02:04:42,990
and if you want to buy timber from say 
Indonesia,

2733
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:48,380
our rules and guidelines for how that 
timber is harvested and where is 

2734
02:04:48,391 --> 02:04:52,380
incredibly stringent.
It's countries like China and Japan that

2735
02:04:52,381 --> 02:04:54,120
are not responsible,
but keep going.

2736
02:04:54,180 --> 02:04:54,380
Sorry.

2737
02:04:54,460 --> 02:04:59,460
You're right.
You're absolutely right there and we've 

2738
02:04:59,460 --> 02:05:01,321
had to use.
We've had used certain things to try to 

2739
02:05:01,321 --> 02:05:02,170
control other countries.
Abuse on the high seas,

2740
02:05:02,171 --> 02:05:04,330
like we'll even go after people and be 
like,

2741
02:05:04,600 --> 02:05:09,600
not only were you not by your fisheries,
but now we have the capability to 

2742
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:09,600
boycott your electronics.
Exactly.

2743
02:05:09,600 --> 02:05:10,270
If you're not going to get with the 
program,

2744
02:05:10,271 --> 02:05:15,271
a high seas,
fisheries management in general in the 

2745
02:05:15,271 --> 02:05:17,371
us,
I attribute it gives us a start 

2746
02:05:17,371 --> 02:05:17,371
installing.
It starts selling a documentary,

2747
02:05:17,371 --> 02:05:21,970
but I'm saying that like the wildlife,
the north american wildlife conservation

2748
02:05:21,971 --> 02:05:26,971
model,
which is a model based on creating 

2749
02:05:26,971 --> 02:05:29,971
abundance so that you can have a limited
sustainable harvest of resources has 

2750
02:05:30,791 --> 02:05:35,260
proven to be the best system and it's 
not even debatable

2751
02:05:35,500 --> 02:05:40,500
and people don't understand that when 
they're in urban areas and they become 

2752
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:43,831
animal rights activists.
They talk about how much they love 

2753
02:05:43,831 --> 02:05:46,231
animals.
They don't understand things like 

2754
02:05:46,231 --> 02:05:47,971
keeping deer population down so you 
don't die in car accidents because they 

2755
02:05:47,971 --> 02:05:51,601
don't have natural predators unless 
you're going to go fucking like what 

2756
02:05:51,601 --> 02:05:54,871
they're doing with wolves and 
reintroduce wolves and deer and 

2757
02:05:54,871 --> 02:05:54,871
ecosystem,
and then what happens?

2758
02:05:54,871 --> 02:05:55,600
What are you gonna control the wolves?

2759
02:05:55,660 --> 02:05:58,480
Well,
they're not funding research,

2760
02:05:58,830 --> 02:06:03,830
right?
Like a guy that wants and he buys 

2761
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:06,630
firearms and ammunition,
which has a federal law which has 

2762
02:06:06,630 --> 02:06:08,230
essentially a self imposed excise tax.
It was voted in by sportsman.

2763
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:10,060
They have cell phones pose,
excise tax,

2764
02:06:10,500 --> 02:06:12,130
where money goes to the federal 
government.

2765
02:06:12,730 --> 02:06:15,100
It's a percentage that goes to the 
federal government that purchase.

2766
02:06:15,370 --> 02:06:17,320
It's earmarked for wildlife 
conservation,

2767
02:06:17,321 --> 02:06:19,660
so you're talking about enforcement of 
laws,

2768
02:06:19,780 --> 02:06:24,780
which I think peter would agree with 
greatly that someone needs to enforce 

2769
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:24,780
these laws.
That's how.

2770
02:06:24,780 --> 02:06:25,390
That's how we're funding that.
In forest went hunting,

2771
02:06:25,391 --> 02:06:28,330
license sales and pittman robertson act 
funds.

2772
02:06:28,870 --> 02:06:33,460
Also buying a hunting license goes to 
create state fish and game agencies.

2773
02:06:33,630 --> 02:06:35,560
Many of these agencies are self 
sustaining.

2774
02:06:35,710 --> 02:06:40,710
They don't get any tax payer funding.
Their funding comes through fees and 

2775
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:43,711
licenses and they do wildlife research.
Pete is not funding wildlife research,

2776
02:06:44,090 --> 02:06:47,080
you know,
it's like they're just making noise,

2777
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:49,960
but like the conversation so often comes
down to peter,

2778
02:06:49,961 --> 02:06:52,840
but peter has become a joke.
I mean when peta makes the news,

2779
02:06:52,870 --> 02:06:56,320
it's always like one of those guys up to
now is always the tone out.

2780
02:06:56,321 --> 02:06:57,470
I don't think that taken seriously.

2781
02:06:59,790 --> 02:07:04,790
I don't think the animal right now,
I don't think that people who self 

2782
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:08,911
identify as animal rights advocates are 
actually dangerous.

2783
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:10,990
Right?
They're not significant.

2784
02:07:10,991 --> 02:07:15,991
I want to disagree with you.
If we can snuggle and share a 

2785
02:07:15,991 --> 02:07:15,991
microphone.
There we go

2786
02:07:15,991 --> 02:07:18,560
because I think that peta is the clown 
shoes of the animal rights movement,

2787
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:23,590
but they're there in a way to be a 
distraction for like the hsus is of the 

2788
02:07:24,021 --> 02:07:29,021
world he made.
He made to the United States and 

2789
02:07:29,021 --> 02:07:32,300
everyone thinks that the humane society 
is your local dog and cat shelter.

2790
02:07:32,301 --> 02:07:33,950
Right.
But nationally,

2791
02:07:33,951 --> 02:07:37,150
hsus,
the society of the United States doesn't

2792
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:42,151
really fund your local animal shelter.
They try to raise money off of you 

2793
02:07:42,151 --> 02:07:43,780
thinking that they fund your local 
animal shelter,

2794
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:47,590
but instead they're the.
They're the non clown shoes.

2795
02:07:47,591 --> 02:07:50,500
Animal rights group,
they're the suit and tie in lobbying.

2796
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:53,320
Go to politicians,
they know how to raise money,

2797
02:07:53,321 --> 02:07:58,321
they know how to be effective.
Talking to politicians in banning 

2798
02:07:58,321 --> 02:07:58,780
certain types of hunting.
And pete is there.

2799
02:07:58,781 --> 02:08:00,670
I think really just be that sort of 
distraction,

2800
02:08:00,970 --> 02:08:01,630
you know?
Oh look,

2801
02:08:01,631 --> 02:08:04,280
it's the chicks who were getting taken 
and tigers.

2802
02:08:04,550 --> 02:08:06,820
It's the people who are wearing like the
little lettuce bikinis,

2803
02:08:07,060 --> 02:08:07,700
but michael,
mark,

2804
02:08:07,701 --> 02:08:09,250
harry and,
or wayne pacelli at,

2805
02:08:09,251 --> 02:08:10,760
uh,
at hsus.

2806
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:12,520
Their goals the same.
I mean,

2807
02:08:12,521 --> 02:08:14,680
wayne pacelle,
you said we want to see a day when there

2808
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:18,340
is no hunting in this country.
Why do you need to hunt anymore?

2809
02:08:18,341 --> 02:08:21,590
You can go to the grocery store and you 
can get your corn fed.

2810
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:26,840
That's what's really insane is that 
someone would want to take away your 

2811
02:08:26,840 --> 02:08:28,230
ability to acquire,
meet your way.

2812
02:08:28,410 --> 02:08:33,410
That somehow or another it would be good
to only be able to get your meat from 

2813
02:08:33,410 --> 02:08:33,420
farmer.

2814
02:08:33,610 --> 02:08:36,550
I think they want.
I don't even think that I want to get to

2815
02:08:36,551 --> 02:08:39,120
a day where we're growing meat and 
laboratories and we've got,

2816
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:41,800
we've got our test tube van.
I think you're right,

2817
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:43,510
but I think they don't understand that

2818
02:08:43,730 --> 02:08:48,730
be this insane imbalance in the 
ecosystem that would probably lead to 

2819
02:08:49,670 --> 02:08:49,730
the,

2820
02:08:49,820 --> 02:08:53,150
the rise of predators and not to mention
the loss of humanity.

2821
02:08:53,151 --> 02:08:53,750
I mean,
you know,

2822
02:08:53,751 --> 02:08:58,220
there is something innately human about 
taking your food.

2823
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:02,960
Then I think we would lose if we grew 
our food and in the laboratory.

2824
02:09:02,990 --> 02:09:05,720
Your definition of human is what they 
want to change.

2825
02:09:05,721 --> 02:09:09,230
I think what they want to change is they
want us to evolve.

2826
02:09:09,500 --> 02:09:13,850
It's this need to be reliant upon our 
primal instincts and my,

2827
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:16,430
my thinking,
my thinking on that as always,

2828
02:09:16,431 --> 02:09:21,230
I understand the idealistic or utopian 
sort of pull in that direction,

2829
02:09:21,470 --> 02:09:23,810
but there's also a reality about the 
time that we live in.

2830
02:09:23,870 --> 02:09:28,870
Although we can see like a bright future
where we become beings of light who can 

2831
02:09:28,870 --> 02:09:31,640
read each other's minds and you know,
the internet is used to travel on,

2832
02:09:31,850 --> 02:09:33,290
you know,
maybe that's the future.

2833
02:09:33,291 --> 02:09:35,180
Maybe that's a million years from now,
whatever the fuck it is.

2834
02:09:35,181 --> 02:09:40,181
But reality is right now.
Animals don't live forever and they're 

2835
02:09:40,181 --> 02:09:43,241
delicious.
When you eat them and you guys are 

2836
02:09:43,241 --> 02:09:43,241
getting crazy,
okay,

2837
02:09:43,241 --> 02:09:44,690
you're not going to live forever.
Neither that deer,

2838
02:09:44,840 --> 02:09:48,680
neither is that cow like this is nuts.
Like the idea that you shouldn't torture

2839
02:09:48,681 --> 02:09:50,060
them a 100 percent.
I'm with you.

2840
02:09:50,180 --> 02:09:55,180
The the idea that you shouldn't 
psychologically damaged them by leaving 

2841
02:09:55,180 --> 02:09:55,370
them in cages their whole life.

2842
02:09:55,390 --> 02:09:57,650
Then finally shooting them and eating 
them and yeah,

2843
02:09:57,651 --> 02:09:59,600
there's a lot of bad karma that 
wouldn't.

2844
02:09:59,780 --> 02:10:04,780
That would make me think that the people
that would be the real animal activists 

2845
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:06,130
would be the ones that want to encourage
the,

2846
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:11,160
the natural food chain,
like you're not going to stop people 

2847
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:11,160
from eating meat.
You're just not.

2848
02:10:11,160 --> 02:10:12,080
It's too.
We like it too much.

2849
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:17,290
There's too much scientific evidence 
that there's benefits through 

2850
02:10:17,290 --> 02:10:21,311
cholesterol is for brain function,
inflammation and there's a lot of 

2851
02:10:21,311 --> 02:10:25,091
benefits of eating meat and vegans don't
want to believe that because a lot of 

2852
02:10:25,091 --> 02:10:28,160
vegans what their.
What their thing is is that they used to

2853
02:10:28,161 --> 02:10:33,161
have an unbelievably shitty diet.
They used to eat fucking bullshit and 

2854
02:10:33,161 --> 02:10:34,790
cheeseburgers,
shitty food and blah blah,

2855
02:10:34,791 --> 02:10:35,060
blah,
blah,

2856
02:10:35,061 --> 02:10:36,740
blah,
but now that they're eating vegan,

2857
02:10:36,741 --> 02:10:38,610
they feel so much better.
Oh my god,

2858
02:10:38,611 --> 02:10:43,611
and now they're like these proselytizing
for the vegan religion and they're going

2859
02:10:43,671 --> 02:10:45,800
around telling everybody how amazing it 
is,

2860
02:10:45,801 --> 02:10:48,080
how amazing they feel to be vegan,
but I'm like,

2861
02:10:48,140 --> 02:10:53,140
I understand you're right.
There's a lot of great nutrients in 

2862
02:10:53,140 --> 02:10:53,990
vegetables,
but end meet.

2863
02:10:56,340 --> 02:11:01,340
There's a lot of good in that too,
and I'm a person who never did like eat 

2864
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:02,960
their body away.
I never did eat shit food all the time.

2865
02:11:03,140 --> 02:11:08,060
I understand that the direct correlation
between nutritional supplementation,

2866
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:10,460
eating healthy vegetables,
eating good,

2867
02:11:10,461 --> 02:11:13,880
lean meat and feeling better and your 
body actually performing,

2868
02:11:14,090 --> 02:11:16,550
especially in something like really 
intense when you.

2869
02:11:16,551 --> 02:11:18,860
When you get into like jujitsu,
any kind of martial art,

2870
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:23,210
the stakes of you being good or bad or 
you getting your ass kicked and that's a

2871
02:11:23,211 --> 02:11:28,211
terrible feeling that every man wants to
avoid and you understand what's working,

2872
02:11:28,431 --> 02:11:33,431
what's not working.
Pragmatism comes into play when you're 

2873
02:11:33,431 --> 02:11:34,010
involved in anything,
any competitive athletic,

2874
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:38,180
especially combat sports like you better
eat the right shit,

2875
02:11:38,510 --> 02:11:40,760
you better take your fucking vital 
because if you don't,

2876
02:11:40,880 --> 02:11:45,880
it's a difference between you just 
barely getting out of a submission and 

2877
02:11:45,880 --> 02:11:47,570
getting to a dominant position and 
winning or you tap again.

2878
02:11:47,740 --> 02:11:48,710
Right?
I mean it literally.

2879
02:11:48,711 --> 02:11:51,410
Sometimes it's that close.
It's a Few beats of a heart.

2880
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:56,480
it's,
it's whether or not you have just that 

2881
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:56,480
extra push of oxygen in your,
in your body.

2882
02:11:56,480 --> 02:11:58,520
People that do that,
they like me.

2883
02:11:59,270 --> 02:12:00,210
Most of them,
you know,

2884
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:00,960
they,
you know.

2885
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,330
Not only that but it's life.
You know,

2886
02:12:02,331 --> 02:12:07,331
if you look at nature,
that's such a classic and stark example 

2887
02:12:07,331 --> 02:12:11,171
of how life eats life.
That's always been life eats life by the

2888
02:12:11,211 --> 02:12:13,070
way,
whether or not you're eating animals,

2889
02:12:13,160 --> 02:12:15,020
you're still kivit telling,
living thing.

2890
02:12:15,050 --> 02:12:15,310
This is the

2891
02:12:15,310 --> 02:12:20,310
thing I've always wondered about and 
actually maybe like I'm relying on the 

2892
02:12:20,310 --> 02:12:21,960
expertise of your viewers and this isn't
something that.

2893
02:12:22,180 --> 02:12:25,550
This isn't a question that they'd be 
able to answer through a format.

2894
02:12:25,551 --> 02:12:27,380
Like twitter will take like a lengthy 
email.

2895
02:12:27,381 --> 02:12:29,740
if someone knows and whenever I have you
do,

2896
02:12:29,810 --> 02:12:31,690
don't give out your email right now,
they're,

2897
02:12:32,330 --> 02:12:34,850
it's going to go to you and then you're 
going to send it to me if it's good,

2898
02:12:35,070 --> 02:12:37,970
but whenever I ask this,
people think I'm being like that.

2899
02:12:37,971 --> 02:12:40,280
I'm trying to demonstrate absurdity by 
being absurd,

2900
02:12:40,310 --> 02:12:45,310
but it really is something I wonder 
about and I'm sure there's a great 

2901
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:45,310
answer for it.
In the,

2902
02:12:45,310 --> 02:12:49,960
in the mindset of a of a,
of a diehard animal rights person who 

2903
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:52,880
feels that human life is equal to animal
life.

2904
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:58,270
What do they propose we should do?
Like once we conquer the problem of 

2905
02:12:58,641 --> 02:13:02,000
humans consuming animals,
human induced animal suffering,

2906
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:05,410
what do they propose is gonna look like?
What will it do with control?

2907
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:06,680
No.
What will they do with the bottle?

2908
02:13:06,681 --> 02:13:07,460
Nose.
Dolphin.

2909
02:13:07,820 --> 02:13:12,820
Like how will it be that he is forced to
stop consuming fish and I'm not trying 

2910
02:13:13,881 --> 02:13:16,730
to be like a smart ass.
Like what will,

2911
02:13:17,030 --> 02:13:22,030
what will you do to get coyotes?
If life is life is life okay?

2912
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:27,830
When will they be offended by the 
actions of a coyote who's killing things

2913
02:13:27,831 --> 02:13:29,540
to survive?
I know it's like he has to,

2914
02:13:29,660 --> 02:13:31,980
but really if you caught them all in 
separate and you'd be

2915
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,980
able to feed them a good question.
I'm not trying to be as smart as like 

2916
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:41,060
what is the answer?
I think they make a very distinct 

2917
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:44,090
difference,
a big difference between humans and 

2918
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:44,090
animals right now as far as they're 
concerned,

2919
02:13:44,090 --> 02:13:46,200
there is a big difference because human 
beings have a choice.

2920
02:13:46,410 --> 02:13:51,410
Our choice could.
We could be herbivores and exclusivelY 

2921
02:13:51,410 --> 02:13:53,070
herbivores and according to them,
even healthier than meat eaters,

2922
02:13:53,071 --> 02:13:58,071
which I disagree with.
I think everybody and I read the China 

2923
02:13:58,071 --> 02:13:58,071
study,
everybody you know,

2924
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:03,560
but it's like I'm a.
I didn't read the whole thing by the 

2925
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:03,560
way.
I sure did.

2926
02:14:03,560 --> 02:14:04,500
I sure did.
No,

2927
02:14:04,540 --> 02:14:09,030
you didn't read that whole thing.
Faculty chapter eight is the best part.

2928
02:14:09,090 --> 02:14:14,090
In fact,
is that where pinocchio gets us out of 

2929
02:14:14,221 --> 02:14:19,221
the whales?
All you have to do is read the end 

2930
02:14:19,221 --> 02:14:19,221
actually because he talks about how how 
the,

2931
02:14:19,221 --> 02:14:23,150
how industry hijacks the sort of the 
high jacks,

2932
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:28,670
government agencies like the school 
lunch program and what the military 

2933
02:14:28,670 --> 02:14:31,740
feeds his soldiers into buying their 
food scientists.

2934
02:14:31,740 --> 02:14:36,740
TheY stacked the deck and get scientists
to say that 25 percent of your fucking 

2935
02:14:36,740 --> 02:14:39,810
diet can be simple sugars because 
there's a lot of money and high fructose

2936
02:14:39,811 --> 02:14:42,300
corn syrup and for the corn refiners,
et cetera.

2937
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:47,510
It's a very,
very amazing though people don't 

2938
02:14:47,510 --> 02:14:49,140
understand like how that happened,
how all the sudden like the government,

2939
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:54,200
it gives farmers money to subsidies on 
corn,

2940
02:14:54,241 --> 02:14:56,600
like to encourage the growth of corn and
it's not just.

2941
02:14:56,610 --> 02:14:58,350
It's not family farms.
Remember everybody,

2942
02:14:58,351 --> 02:15:01,960
it's huge industrial farms.
They get the bulk of the balkans somehow

2943
02:15:01,961 --> 02:15:06,961
know that they watched each other's 
hands and figure out how to slap each 

2944
02:15:06,961 --> 02:15:09,100
other in the back and stack the deck.
I mean the t dot collin campbell does a.

2945
02:15:09,150 --> 02:15:10,710
He was a scientist on one of these 
boards.

2946
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:15,960
They do a.
He does a very good job as a scientist 

2947
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:19,311
who is involved in the stuff and he 
names names because he's friends with 

2948
02:15:19,311 --> 02:15:21,780
these guys who are on nestle and coca 
cola is boards who say,

2949
02:15:21,781 --> 02:15:23,610
guess what,
soda?

2950
02:15:23,730 --> 02:15:26,190
High fructose corn syrup has nothing to 
do with obesity.

2951
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:27,540
You can eat as much as you want.
In fact,

2952
02:15:27,541 --> 02:15:32,541
25 percent of your the food and 
nutrition board that sets the standard 

2953
02:15:32,541 --> 02:15:33,030
for the school lunch program and 
mothers,

2954
02:15:33,060 --> 02:15:35,520
mothers with dependent children,
etc.

2955
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:38,730
You can eat 25 percent.
Twenty five percent of your diet can be,

2956
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:40,800
can be a simple sugars.
Go ahead.

2957
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:45,890
Listen to what monsanto was done at.
Monsanto has bought up a company that 

2958
02:15:45,991 --> 02:15:50,991
was the leading company on be research 
because those are the people that said 

2959
02:15:50,991 --> 02:15:54,420
that monsanto's pesticides and all the 
shit that's in their food is a causing b

2960
02:15:54,841 --> 02:15:57,840
populations to decline,
so monsanto buys them.

2961
02:15:57,990 --> 02:16:02,990
Then monsanto develops a fucking robot.
Be okay.

2962
02:16:04,741 --> 02:16:07,670
I thought I joked around about it in my 
act.

2963
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:12,680
I said that bs as such country animals,
I hope that we make solar powered robot 

2964
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:14,670
bees that fueled themselves by.

2965
02:16:14,820 --> 02:16:19,820
They have dicks.
They're actually vacuum cleaners and 

2966
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:22,431
they just fuck real beat to death and 
suck the life out and burn inside the 

2967
02:16:22,431 --> 02:16:24,390
combustion engine and I was just joking 
around.

2968
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:26,750
I mean anything anybody would actually 
make a robot be.

2969
02:16:26,751 --> 02:16:31,751
But I was like,
how tough is it to pollinate a fucking 

2970
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:31,751
plant?
They didn't even know they're doing it.

2971
02:16:31,751 --> 02:16:34,260
They're doing it.
I mean santa stealing your material this

2972
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:34,600
past.
Well,

2973
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:39,601
they thought about it like.
I bet they thought about it before me 

2974
02:16:39,601 --> 02:16:42,580
problems,
but it takes a long time to develop a 

2975
02:16:42,580 --> 02:16:44,731
fucking drove.
But they have a robot be monsanto has 

2976
02:16:44,731 --> 02:16:44,731
fucking robot beat.
Yeah,

2977
02:16:44,731 --> 02:16:45,230
they're,
they're the.

2978
02:16:45,560 --> 02:16:47,800
Pulled up a picture of it.
Pull up a picture with someone.

2979
02:16:48,470 --> 02:16:50,900
Monsanto,
robot b is in the news today.

2980
02:16:51,380 --> 02:16:53,510
Along with that fucking explosion in 
boston.

2981
02:16:54,380 --> 02:16:57,020
Is there any new evidence on that or 
what's going on?

2982
02:16:57,080 --> 02:16:58,070
We should probably know.
Huh?

2983
02:16:58,130 --> 02:17:00,310
Let's see.
Kid guide.

2984
02:17:00,640 --> 02:17:02,080
A eight year old kid.
Really?

2985
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:06,850
Do they know it was it?
Was it like a sophisticated form?

2986
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,300
it's.
I think it's a,

2987
02:17:08,380 --> 02:17:11,590
it looks like it's a fire and it looks 
like there was ball bearings in it,

2988
02:17:11,591 --> 02:17:15,610
so it looks like it's probably just one 
of those ones you can find out online,

2989
02:17:16,180 --> 02:17:19,840
like a doMestic produced.
Unbelievably horrific.

2990
02:17:19,900 --> 02:17:23,770
This is 741.
People have been injured a 144.

2991
02:17:23,771 --> 02:17:27,580
At least 37 of orally 17 rather are a 
critical injuries.

2992
02:17:27,670 --> 02:17:30,250
Dr sara pulling ball bearings out of 
people.

2993
02:17:31,180 --> 02:17:32,230
Yeah.
Oh my god.

2994
02:17:32,560 --> 02:17:34,150
Now monsanto,
monsanto,

2995
02:17:34,151 --> 02:17:36,920
robot be.
No,

2996
02:17:37,130 --> 02:17:39,250
that scares me.
They're going to come up with wasps that

2997
02:17:39,650 --> 02:17:43,540
can distinguish that thing.
That's the one with the quarter.

2998
02:17:43,630 --> 02:17:45,070
The one right next to it with the 
quarter.

2999
02:17:45,100 --> 02:17:49,270
Look at that.
That's the one up in The upper right.

3000
02:17:49,271 --> 02:17:50,410
That one right there.
Look at that.

3001
02:17:50,710 --> 02:17:55,710
Look at that fucking thing.
That is monsanto's robot b and that 

3002
02:17:55,710 --> 02:17:59,230
thing is going to have the same function
that had actual ob does like there'll be

3003
02:17:59,231 --> 02:18:03,130
able to get them to fly back and forth 
and pollinate plants.

3004
02:18:06,080 --> 02:18:07,340
oh yeah,
we killed off the bees.

3005
02:18:07,341 --> 02:18:09,920
Don't worry.
We got terminator bees tHat we developed

3006
02:18:09,921 --> 02:18:10,820
specifically.
It's like,

3007
02:18:10,840 --> 02:18:11,600
don't sweat it.
Dude,

3008
02:18:12,160 --> 02:18:13,610
in my,
the way Montana will probably,

3009
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:18,940
monsanto rather owns the copyright on 
the east and nobody else can make their 

3010
02:18:18,940 --> 02:18:22,961
own robot.
Bees are going to have to buy robot 

3011
02:18:22,961 --> 02:18:22,961
beach,
monsanto and like a real baby.

3012
02:18:22,961 --> 02:18:23,000
They only last like a week.

3013
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:24,110
There was a,
um,

3014
02:18:25,980 --> 02:18:28,120
in the 18 hundreds there was this,
uh,

3015
02:18:28,121 --> 02:18:31,270
there was uh,
uh,

3016
02:18:31,470 --> 02:18:35,140
my mind is escaping was the guy who 
started the one who studies plants,

3017
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:40,380
herb there,
there's a botanist who was her 

3018
02:18:40,380 --> 02:18:42,970
biologist.
Botanist was making.

3019
02:18:42,971 --> 02:18:47,971
I was making like an exploration of the 
american west and he was talking about 

3020
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:50,230
and he wrote for awhile about the 
advance of,

3021
02:18:50,310 --> 02:18:52,150
of the honeybee.
Know the honeybee is not a native,

3022
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:54,010
not native to this continent.
Really?

3023
02:18:54,100 --> 02:18:59,100
Yeah.
He's talking about the advance of the 

3024
02:18:59,100 --> 02:18:59,100
advance of honeybees across the,
across the continent.

3025
02:18:59,100 --> 02:18:59,980
Come on,
chips.

3026
02:19:00,840 --> 02:19:02,980
People brought it up.
They brought it on purpose.

3027
02:19:02,981 --> 02:19:03,760
Yeah.
Like I'm,

3028
02:19:03,850 --> 02:19:04,810
again,
I'm escaping like,

3029
02:19:04,870 --> 02:19:09,870
not an aviary but a ap or people brought
them for honey production and they went 

3030
02:19:13,571 --> 02:19:18,571
feral very successfully and he was in,
in this bondness describes and he made 

3031
02:19:18,761 --> 02:19:19,720
his trip,
like if some,

3032
02:19:19,780 --> 02:19:24,780
you know,
I remember he made his trip and 1811 

3033
02:19:24,780 --> 02:19:26,230
because his getting home was interrupted
by the war of 18,

3034
02:19:26,231 --> 02:19:30,240
12 and he was on the Missouri when the,
um,

3035
02:19:30,241 --> 02:19:35,100
when that great earthquake,
the earthquake struck,

3036
02:19:35,101 --> 02:19:37,740
that actually switched the direction of 
the mississippi's flow.

3037
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:38,640
Whoa.
Uh,

3038
02:19:38,670 --> 02:19:40,200
he was there and then it got delayed by 
the war.

3039
02:19:40,201 --> 02:19:40,710
18,
12.

3040
02:19:40,890 --> 02:19:42,300
But anyways,
shit luck,

3041
02:19:42,360 --> 02:19:43,830
you know,
he had this guy,

3042
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:46,080
this guy had bradbury.
Bradbury was his name,

3043
02:19:46,081 --> 02:19:47,840
like the novelist,
his name is brad bird.

3044
02:19:48,060 --> 02:19:53,060
He had amazingly bad luck.
He thought he's Just going on a little 

3045
02:19:53,060 --> 02:19:54,180
trip and it took them seven years to get
home and all the material,

3046
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,530
all the material,
the bradbury,

3047
02:19:55,610 --> 02:20:00,610
all the material.
He gathered all the plant specImens he 

3048
02:20:00,610 --> 02:20:03,411
took,
he got done and he wanted to take a 

3049
02:20:03,411 --> 02:20:03,411
different route home.
So he sent his assistant.

3050
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:05,300
Homewood is stuff,
right?

3051
02:20:05,640 --> 02:20:10,640
But it's assistant gets home years 
earlier and by the time this dude makes 

3052
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:11,700
it back home,
assistant has published all the material

3053
02:20:11,701 --> 02:20:12,390
under his own name.

3054
02:20:14,610 --> 02:20:19,610
But anyways,
in this book he has this really 

3055
02:20:19,610 --> 02:20:21,981
interesting,
that's really interesting passage about 

3056
02:20:21,981 --> 02:20:24,570
how fast bees are advancing and how they
always keep pace.

3057
02:20:24,890 --> 02:20:26,670
They're always out ahead of the 
frontier.

3058
02:20:27,090 --> 02:20:32,090
So at the time when he was writing,
he was talking about like the be 

3059
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:33,270
somewhere in North Dakota or whatever,
be saying like reliably,

3060
02:20:33,271 --> 02:20:35,690
you know,
we were in st louis in a,

3061
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:40,770
in a strong way and bs or 40 miles out 
and they'll bs will continue to march 

3062
02:20:40,770 --> 02:20:41,550
across.
That's what I like.

3063
02:20:41,580 --> 02:20:45,870
Colony collapse disorder is interesting 
is it is.

3064
02:20:46,200 --> 02:20:51,200
I don't think of it as a wildlife issue.
I think of it as an agricultural issue,

3065
02:20:52,200 --> 02:20:57,200
right?
Because I'm not naturally as a non 

3066
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:57,200
native species,
it's a,

3067
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:59,340
it's an agricultural problem and it's a 
saturday or cultural problem.

3068
02:20:59,341 --> 02:21:04,341
But I don't.
when I think of like wildlife politics 

3069
02:21:04,341 --> 02:21:05,070
and the wellbeing of american wildlife,
which I have a vested interest in,

3070
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:10,380
like I don't look at colony collapse 
disorder as it's a serious economic 

3071
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:10,380
problem.

3072
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:15,030
So there's that.
These animals are these bees rather if 

3073
02:21:15,030 --> 02:21:15,160
they didn't exist,
if they hadn't been introduced here,

3074
02:21:15,161 --> 02:21:16,990
would agriculture be drastically 
different?

3075
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:23,300
Yeah,
I would say so because they're able to 

3076
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:23,580
use them in such a targeted like,
you know,

3077
02:21:23,581 --> 02:21:26,190
a guy that raises bees is doing two 
things,

3078
02:21:26,191 --> 02:21:29,520
is producing honey and he's providing 
pollination services.

3079
02:21:29,910 --> 02:21:32,340
So they do these things in tAndem.
You know,

3080
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:37,670
when I was a,
when I was in college I worked for a 

3081
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:38,040
beekeeper and he would all the while 
he's collecting honeycomb,

3082
02:21:38,041 --> 02:21:39,450
but at the same time he's moving stuff 
around.

3083
02:21:39,451 --> 02:21:40,890
So at the beginning of the year he's 
done.

3084
02:21:40,900 --> 02:21:45,900
He'd go down to Georgia,
he truck is bees down to george and he 

3085
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:48,781
do pollination services down there and I
think that it's just a way that you can 

3086
02:21:48,781 --> 02:21:52,521
do like very targeted,
very fast synchronized pollination of 

3087
02:21:52,981 --> 02:21:57,981
plant species that if you were relying 
on native species of bees and moths and 

3088
02:22:00,181 --> 02:22:02,450
butterflies that I gathered would take 
much longer.

3089
02:22:02,500 --> 02:22:04,090
What are the native ones as opposed to 
the.

3090
02:22:04,270 --> 02:22:06,640
The honeybees are not native.
Honeybees are not native.

3091
02:22:06,641 --> 02:22:09,370
So the north american indians,
they never got any honey.

3092
02:22:09,371 --> 02:22:10,450
But when we came along.
Okay.

3093
02:22:10,451 --> 02:22:10,530
Psych.

3094
02:22:10,590 --> 02:22:13,860
I think that the honeybee produces like 
a high,

3095
02:22:14,710 --> 02:22:18,270
like good quantities of a high quality 
honey.

3096
02:22:18,300 --> 02:22:23,300
There are similar products produced,
there are similar things produced about 

3097
02:22:23,300 --> 02:22:26,500
other things,
but it's kind of like the reason that 

3098
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:26,500
goat's milk isn't really

3099
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:27,630
a big,
strong product,

3100
02:22:27,631 --> 02:22:29,410
but cows can crank it out,
you know?

3101
02:22:29,620 --> 02:22:32,400
And so in that way they were brought for
that purpose.

3102
02:22:32,401 --> 02:22:35,790
But there are many poLlinating insects 
that were native to the us.

3103
02:22:35,791 --> 02:22:38,910
But like the specific honeybee is,
we know it wAs introduced species.

3104
02:22:39,570 --> 02:22:41,340
Were they here?
I don't know,

3105
02:22:41,341 --> 02:22:43,590
but I would.
I'm sure they were.

3106
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:47,100
I like to be the son of a bitch.
You introduce wasps to the United States

3107
02:22:47,490 --> 02:22:48,750
who brought,
who decided,

3108
02:22:48,751 --> 02:22:50,640
you know what bees they make honey,
I think.

3109
02:22:50,641 --> 02:22:52,770
Let's see what happens.
We bring wasps over here.

3110
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:55,960
That guy from animal planet.
Screw that guy.

3111
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:58,570
He had a short lived show on animal 
planet and it was,

3112
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:01,170
he was an entomologist and he was a 
really weird dude.

3113
02:23:01,470 --> 02:23:02,460
And he goes,
he goes,

3114
02:23:02,461 --> 02:23:05,220
look at this.
And he had this huge spider and he goes,

3115
02:23:05,221 --> 02:23:07,620
watch this.
And he put it in his mouth and then they

3116
02:23:07,630 --> 02:23:08,150
pulled it out.

3117
02:23:08,150 --> 02:23:09,540
Was this huge transplant?
He goes,

3118
02:23:09,690 --> 02:23:11,770
now I won't bite me because I'm not a 
moth.

3119
02:23:11,820 --> 02:23:16,820
If I was a moth that would bite me,
but I'm a human so it doesn't know the 

3120
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:16,820
difference.
I'm like,

3121
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:16,820
all right,
if some filipino thing.

3122
02:23:16,820 --> 02:23:17,850
Right.
So I said,

3123
02:23:17,851 --> 02:23:21,270
I said that his claim to fame is he had 
been stung by every,

3124
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,700
every insect.
And I said,

3125
02:23:24,290 --> 02:23:25,400
there is some,
uh,

3126
02:23:25,800 --> 02:23:27,690
there are some wasp out there that can 
hurt you.

3127
02:23:27,710 --> 02:23:29,340
And he said,
oh yes.

3128
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:31,380
Oh yeah.
And I said,

3129
02:23:31,381 --> 02:23:31,830
like,
what?

3130
02:23:31,831 --> 02:23:32,640
He goes,
well,

3131
02:23:32,641 --> 02:23:37,110
the tarantula hawk or the 24 hour and 
that you find that Panama,

3132
02:23:37,410 --> 02:23:40,350
if they sting you,
you'll fall to the ground and scream for

3133
02:23:40,440 --> 02:23:42,600
hours and hours.
He goes,

3134
02:23:42,601 --> 02:23:45,180
they call it the 24:00
AM because when you do get stung,

3135
02:23:45,330 --> 02:23:47,160
you can't sleep.
You can't drink,

3136
02:23:47,161 --> 02:23:50,190
you can eat for 24 hours.
The pain is so intense.

3137
02:23:50,610 --> 02:23:51,720
I said,
what was the pain like?

3138
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:56,760
Is I liken it to getting your hand 
slammed in a car door and being shot 

3139
02:23:56,760 --> 02:24:00,180
with a 45 at the same tie.
He was this really weird guy.

3140
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:01,350
I was like,
well,

3141
02:24:01,670 --> 02:24:04,440
I'll be staying away from the tarantula 
hawk,

3142
02:24:04,470 --> 02:24:07,620
which is indigenous to this area in 
Nevada.

3143
02:24:08,790 --> 02:24:12,590
Whenever you talk about any of that 
really evil fucking bugs in the soil,

3144
02:24:12,860 --> 02:24:17,860
the shit out that's really.
That really drives me nuts about animal 

3145
02:24:17,860 --> 02:24:18,960
rights activists because those are 
animals too.

3146
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:24,290
Okay.
This is a whole broad ecosystem and a 

3147
02:24:24,290 --> 02:24:26,040
lot of these things that are out there,
we can't live with them.

3148
02:24:26,280 --> 02:24:28,020
If we live with them,
they kill us.

3149
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:33,140
Like,
do you understand that there's ants in 

3150
02:24:33,140 --> 02:24:33,300
africa that kill elephants?
They climb up in elephant's leg and they

3151
02:24:33,301 --> 02:24:36,060
go right through the fucking ear and 
they start eating.

3152
02:24:36,061 --> 02:24:38,040
The elephant is actually your first 
fuck.

3153
02:24:38,041 --> 02:24:38,670
Yeah,
that's true.

3154
02:24:38,700 --> 02:24:43,700
That's kind of find them and then they 
communicate with this with the other 

3155
02:24:43,700 --> 02:24:47,060
aunts and they're evil colony and they 
find this poor fucking outfit and they 

3156
02:24:47,060 --> 02:24:49,640
climb up and they eat him ears first.
Did you.

3157
02:24:49,650 --> 02:24:54,650
You must have,
if you're competing because you know 

3158
02:24:54,650 --> 02:24:56,841
this guy is my boys in san antonio who 
made this big promotional video for me 

3159
02:24:56,850 --> 02:24:59,040
that said no cons.
Coming to brian,

3160
02:24:59,270 --> 02:25:01,650
that squad,
you kind of hit show no cons,

3161
02:25:01,660 --> 02:25:03,300
please.
Is that from you?

3162
02:25:03,301 --> 02:25:05,250
Is that you're a.
I mean,

3163
02:25:05,251 --> 02:25:08,520
I think that's the number one problem 
with human beings.

3164
02:25:08,521 --> 02:25:12,120
The number one problem,
if we eliminated all kinds males,

3165
02:25:12,540 --> 02:25:14,360
by the way,
there's a transient hawks.

3166
02:25:14,361 --> 02:25:16,680
We show them that show.
How about that?

3167
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:21,440
You want to get that motherfucker.
TheY actually catch tranche though.

3168
02:25:22,070 --> 02:25:24,140
Oh,
they do come home,

3169
02:25:24,160 --> 02:25:25,150
man.
What a monster.

3170
02:25:25,370 --> 02:25:27,250
Flying monster.
I'm peeing out of my dick.

3171
02:25:27,251 --> 02:25:28,210
I'm like pointed.
Go ahead.

3172
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:31,300
My point is that if we eliminated that 
from the world,

3173
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:34,960
it was just an era and everyone left had
to figure things out.

3174
02:25:35,290 --> 02:25:40,290
I think magically 99 percent of the 
world's problems would immediately be 

3175
02:25:40,361 --> 02:25:42,250
eradicated.
I really do believe that.

3176
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:47,430
I think most of the world's problems,
whether it's crazy out of control 

3177
02:25:47,430 --> 02:25:51,421
bankers that are fucking stealing 
resources and robbing the country blind 

3178
02:25:51,421 --> 02:25:54,720
or whether it's evil corrupt politicians
or whether it's you know,

3179
02:25:54,730 --> 02:25:56,960
whatever it is,
you get caught,

3180
02:25:57,550 --> 02:26:02,550
all the county human beings out of that 
equation and new resolutions 

3181
02:26:02,591 --> 02:26:06,370
automatically begin to show themselves 
and people automatically begin to try to

3182
02:26:06,580 --> 02:26:11,580
find ways to work together and stop a 
environmental devastation and figure out

3183
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:14,080
how to be profitable while still being 
ethical.

3184
02:26:14,220 --> 02:26:19,220
It's an issue.
We have like this huge civilization 

3185
02:26:19,220 --> 02:26:22,600
issue that's really a contest shoe,
but if you ask them all the line up,

3186
02:26:22,630 --> 02:26:24,490
you won't have people who self identify.

3187
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:29,560
Of course not.
So you need a really good court system 

3188
02:26:29,560 --> 02:26:30,010
or mushrooms.
Mushrooms would help.

3189
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:35,430
You know when people need to do is that 
your ego can convince you from some 

3190
02:26:35,430 --> 02:26:36,490
pretty horrible shit because we're in 
this.

3191
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:41,860
We're,
we're sort of a species that's in a 

3192
02:26:41,860 --> 02:26:43,921
stage.
We're in a stage of not quite being 

3193
02:26:43,921 --> 02:26:43,921
animals,
being self aware,

3194
02:26:43,921 --> 02:26:47,410
having the ability to communicate,
but not really being completely,

3195
02:26:47,411 --> 02:26:48,910
fully,
wholly enlightened,

3196
02:26:48,911 --> 02:26:53,911
and there's a lot of things that slow us
down along that way to being completely 

3197
02:26:53,911 --> 02:26:57,451
wholly enlightened and enjoying this 
experience as brothers and sisters.

3198
02:26:57,790 --> 02:27:00,550
And the problem is people that don't get
life right,

3199
02:27:00,820 --> 02:27:05,820
whether it's genetic or whether it's 
behavioral because of their environment 

3200
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:07,300
and the conditioning that theY 
experienced growing up.

3201
02:27:07,390 --> 02:27:12,390
Whatever it is,
those people that don't quite get life 

3202
02:27:12,390 --> 02:27:15,091
right and they're just fucking insulting
and stupid and annoying and constantly 

3203
02:27:15,091 --> 02:27:19,711
creating their own issue is constantly 
causing problems so that they have some 

3204
02:27:19,711 --> 02:27:21,190
sort of motivation to get through their 
daily day.

3205
02:27:21,210 --> 02:27:23,380
That's,
that's a big percentage of human beings.

3206
02:27:23,680 --> 02:27:26,830
It's a complex organism that doesn't 
come with a direction manual,

3207
02:27:26,980 --> 02:27:31,980
so a lot of people fuck it up and You 
develop from the ground up and you do a 

3208
02:27:31,980 --> 02:27:36,001
shit job and it's addicted to drugs and 
it's stopping that with these drugs and 

3209
02:27:36,221 --> 02:27:39,280
you're filling these holes and you're.
You're cutting up.

3210
02:27:39,610 --> 02:27:43,870
You got to have something that allows 
you to see if it's possible.

3211
02:27:43,871 --> 02:27:44,920
Some people,
it's not possible.

3212
02:27:44,921 --> 02:27:49,921
Some people are so psychologically 
damaged by the time they've come in 

3213
02:27:49,921 --> 02:27:52,201
adult.
There's almost nothing you can do for 

3214
02:27:52,201 --> 02:27:54,091
them,
but if someone did have enough sense to 

3215
02:27:54,091 --> 02:27:58,711
just stand back and look at their life 
as if they were trying to give 

3216
02:27:58,711 --> 02:27:58,960
themselves advice,
like if you.

3217
02:27:58,961 --> 02:28:00,730
If you.
How would you give yourself advice?

3218
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:03,130
Have you met you and you saw your 
issues?

3219
02:28:03,131 --> 02:28:05,590
What would you say?
If I give myself advice,

3220
02:28:05,740 --> 02:28:07,210
it's a great move.
You know,

3221
02:28:07,230 --> 02:28:08,740
that's,
you know,

3222
02:28:08,770 --> 02:28:13,480
I think it comes from a move.
I think some of it comes also from.

3223
02:28:14,660 --> 02:28:16,810
There's something that a human being 
like,

3224
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:19,150
like somebody wants that the scientists 
were saying,

3225
02:28:19,390 --> 02:28:21,470
if you got rid of all the ants on 
planet,

3226
02:28:21,650 --> 02:28:22,070
the earth

3227
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:24,260
would last five years.
In other words,

3228
02:28:24,290 --> 02:28:29,290
all the other animals would die in five 
years for a whole bunch of reasons 

3229
02:28:29,290 --> 02:28:30,080
because it's part of the ecosystem.
If you got rid of all humans,

3230
02:28:30,890 --> 02:28:32,870
animals and everything else would be 
just fine.

3231
02:28:32,871 --> 02:28:34,130
It would flourish.
Now,

3232
02:28:34,940 --> 02:28:39,940
that is an interesting thing to say.
I thought about that because I thought 

3233
02:28:39,940 --> 02:28:40,130
the,
the,

3234
02:28:40,160 --> 02:28:45,160
the,
a lot of people when you couch it in 

3235
02:28:45,160 --> 02:28:45,170
those terms,
and I think as a human being,

3236
02:28:45,171 --> 02:28:50,171
you kind of grew up knowing in some ways
that we are somehow a burden to the 

3237
02:28:50,361 --> 02:28:51,590
ecosystem,
you know,

3238
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:54,890
we are a burden to this world,
the natural world,

3239
02:28:54,891 --> 02:28:56,840
and it's something we have to steward 
properly.

3240
02:28:57,470 --> 02:29:02,470
That kind of.
There's a built in sense as a human 

3241
02:29:02,470 --> 02:29:05,650
being that in some ways you are a bit of
an intruder and interruption and a and a

3242
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:10,720
burden to that which is life sustaining.
I always think even now that's so 

3243
02:29:12,620 --> 02:29:13,220
personal,
man.

3244
02:29:13,221 --> 02:29:15,710
I don't agree with that.
Not saying that I agree.

3245
02:29:15,711 --> 02:29:18,950
I'm just saying I think that is part of 
the human psyche and always has been.

3246
02:29:19,380 --> 02:29:21,200
I think so.
I think especially,

3247
02:29:21,940 --> 02:29:25,160
I think that's where conservation 
movements and speed and things come from

3248
02:29:25,450 --> 02:29:28,490
as well.
I disagree with you to pull yourself out

3249
02:29:28,491 --> 02:29:28,820
of the hole.

3250
02:29:30,240 --> 02:29:32,060
Did you hear about this?
The newton,

3251
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:33,570
uh,
families from the,

3252
02:29:33,610 --> 02:29:35,930
the victims of the school shooting?
Yeah.

3253
02:29:36,010 --> 02:29:38,780
Uh,
we're in the last mile of the,

3254
02:29:38,860 --> 02:29:43,860
uh,
it was dedicated to the last mile was 

3255
02:29:43,860 --> 02:29:45,791
dedicated to them,
so that's where they were all sitting 

3256
02:29:45,791 --> 02:29:45,791
and that's where all the bombs went off.
No.

3257
02:29:46,050 --> 02:29:51,050
Yeah,
so that's a conspiracy going on one of 

3258
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:51,050
those individuals,
um,

3259
02:29:51,050 --> 02:29:52,840
in june.
Well,

3260
02:29:53,210 --> 02:29:56,260
I'm not sure because they're not saying 
who's been there,

3261
02:29:57,310 --> 02:29:59,110
just they haven't suffered enough.
Man.

3262
02:29:59,111 --> 02:30:00,850
I got kids that age.
Yeah.

3263
02:30:01,090 --> 02:30:02,860
And that's something that,
uh,

3264
02:30:03,670 --> 02:30:05,340
I guess that would have been public 
information.

3265
02:30:05,341 --> 02:30:07,660
Oh yeah.
Where those people were.

3266
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:08,150
Yeah,
because they,

3267
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:09,220
I guess they,
they,

3268
02:30:09,250 --> 02:30:10,040
it actually,
there's,

3269
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:10,990
there's,
there's a,

3270
02:30:10,991 --> 02:30:15,190
I'm trying to find a video or a photo of
it,

3271
02:30:15,191 --> 02:30:18,130
but there's actually people taking 
photos in front of it,

3272
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:20,290
like the families and stuff like that 
before it happened.

3273
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:23,830
So weird.
Oh,

3274
02:30:25,300 --> 02:30:25,930
here we go.

3275
02:30:26,480 --> 02:30:27,260
Yeah,
check this out.

3276
02:30:27,310 --> 02:30:31,400
Uh,
it's on hollywood life.com.

3277
02:30:31,790 --> 02:30:33,720
And like there's a photos.

3278
02:30:34,810 --> 02:30:39,810
Have them sitting right there,
the last mile.

3279
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:44,420
That's crazy.

3280
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:49,670
I just got to say,
that was one of the most satisfied 

3281
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:49,670
pisses I've ever had my life.
Congratulations my friend.

3282
02:30:49,670 --> 02:30:51,390
Something about taking leaks.
What is that?

3283
02:30:51,690 --> 02:30:56,690
The school shooters were sitting in the 
last mile of the boston marathon from 

3284
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:57,860
newton.
Oh my god.

3285
02:30:58,280 --> 02:31:00,650
Yeah.
And so did they get hurt?

3286
02:31:01,290 --> 02:31:06,290
Probably,
but they haven't said he's gotten hurt 

3287
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:06,290
though.
So that's what they were.

3288
02:31:06,290 --> 02:31:07,640
Ah,
something soccer.

3289
02:31:08,510 --> 02:31:10,940
What the fuck?
This whole thing is terrifying.

3290
02:31:10,941 --> 02:31:12,440
Cnn.
Don't go to cnn.

3291
02:31:12,441 --> 02:31:13,600
Fox don't,
don't,

3292
02:31:13,670 --> 02:31:17,870
don't even go look at the front page.
It's horrific blood everywhere.

3293
02:31:18,690 --> 02:31:21,380
It's of problem.
It's a con providence current problem.

3294
02:31:21,430 --> 02:31:26,430
That's,
I mean there's obviously that 

3295
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:26,670
simplifying things to the extreme.
Don't send me twitter messages.

3296
02:31:26,671 --> 02:31:29,340
I know what I'm doing.
I know what you're saying.

3297
02:31:29,341 --> 02:31:30,930
You're absolutely right.
I agree with you,

3298
02:31:30,931 --> 02:31:35,520
but that's obviously missing the point.
You know,

3299
02:31:36,840 --> 02:31:38,700
you know,
human human beings,

3300
02:31:38,701 --> 02:31:41,490
man is capable of amazing shit.
You know,

3301
02:31:41,880 --> 02:31:46,200
I've definitely said that like we could 
figure out how to get people to everyone

3302
02:31:46,201 --> 02:31:48,480
get their shit together and that's the 
bipolar rape.

3303
02:31:48,540 --> 02:31:50,250
We are the most bipolar rape.
Yeah.

3304
02:31:50,251 --> 02:31:52,080
But I don't think it's.
I don't think it's important.

3305
02:31:52,260 --> 02:31:57,260
I mean,
I don't think it's necessary for our 

3306
02:31:57,260 --> 02:31:57,930
survival.
I don't think we have to be shitty to,

3307
02:31:57,960 --> 02:31:59,550
to in order to move forward.

3308
02:31:59,550 --> 02:32:01,990
I agree.
I think that's the right date.

3309
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:04,620
Didn't have technology.
I think that's the case.

3310
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:10,120
You know,
it's like the when one of the things 

3311
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:11,841
that I put in it puts it into 
perspective that a couple of thousand 

3312
02:32:11,841 --> 02:32:12,390
years ago if someone showed up on your 
shore,

3313
02:32:12,750 --> 02:32:15,270
those fucking people were dangerous and 
you had to kill them.

3314
02:32:15,560 --> 02:32:20,560
We're probably going to get raped and 
pillaged and sold into slavery and now 

3315
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,600
you welcomed them as an important part 
of the tourism industry.

3316
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:26,680
You know,
that's a completely new development in 

3317
02:32:26,680 --> 02:32:29,841
human history.
have fucking rosetta stone so you can 

3318
02:32:29,841 --> 02:32:29,841
figure out what the hell they were 
saying.

3319
02:32:29,841 --> 02:32:30,510
It's so true,
man,

3320
02:32:30,560 --> 02:32:35,070
that's so much of the world and up until
literally 300 years ago,

3321
02:32:35,071 --> 02:32:37,230
less less,
what am I talking about?

3322
02:32:37,890 --> 02:32:42,890
One hundred 50 years ago was in 
servitude of some kind and usually a 

3323
02:32:42,890 --> 02:32:42,890
form of slavery.
Well,

3324
02:32:42,890 --> 02:32:47,530
what's really trippy,
it's to see North Korea still rocking 

3325
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:47,530
it.
old school today,

3326
02:32:47,530 --> 02:32:48,890
still rocking a full.

3327
02:32:50,600 --> 02:32:52,010
I can't figure out what's going to 
happen.

3328
02:32:52,040 --> 02:32:57,040
I mean like in some way,
in some way it seems that the state 

3329
02:32:58,371 --> 02:33:01,170
department and in the military is like,
oh my,

3330
02:33:02,120 --> 02:33:04,480
like what do you do with these guys?
And their hand.

3331
02:33:04,500 --> 02:33:06,200
Then the other half of it seems like a 
car,

3332
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:06,680
like,
like,

3333
02:33:06,681 --> 02:33:07,630
seriously,
I can't tell it.

3334
02:33:07,650 --> 02:33:09,410
Is it not serious or serious?
Well,

3335
02:33:09,411 --> 02:33:10,840
it's blessed.
Flustered.

3336
02:33:10,940 --> 02:33:12,470
North korea's always busted.
However,

3337
02:33:12,471 --> 02:33:14,020
the problem is this kid is

3338
02:33:14,130 --> 02:33:15,630
29,
maybe 30.

3339
02:33:16,350 --> 02:33:21,350
They don't know a lot about them and 
they're not talking about the ruler of 

3340
02:33:21,350 --> 02:33:22,410
North Korea,
the sun john il now or whatever.

3341
02:33:22,411 --> 02:33:24,400
I think his name is.
They don't.

3342
02:33:24,430 --> 02:33:25,980
Yeah.
They don't know enough about him.

3343
02:33:26,010 --> 02:33:27,720
And uh,
it used to be his father.

3344
02:33:27,721 --> 02:33:29,400
There was a method to his father's 
madness.

3345
02:33:29,580 --> 02:33:32,040
He would create a lot of heat to get 
wrinkled,

3346
02:33:32,280 --> 02:33:34,110
negotiating.
Tam will get more aid or whatever.

3347
02:33:34,470 --> 02:33:39,470
And this kid is,
they think probably rattling his sword 

3348
02:33:39,470 --> 02:33:43,011
to get the respect of the ancient 
generals that actually run that fucking 

3349
02:33:43,011 --> 02:33:44,700
country.
We need to bring dennis and back.

3350
02:33:45,420 --> 02:33:50,420
You're right.
And I'm glad you brought that up and 

3351
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:50,420
bring that into a sentence.
That is.

3352
02:33:50,420 --> 02:33:52,560
What did you think of North Korea when 
you have desk robin and your counsel,

3353
02:33:52,740 --> 02:33:55,230
why does it need bring dad's broadman in
and with the United States,

3354
02:33:55,231 --> 02:33:57,360
like hook it up and just provide him 
with,

3355
02:33:57,390 --> 02:34:02,390
you know,
a thousand korean chicks and just let 

3356
02:34:02,390 --> 02:34:06,051
him run it when we need him in that gene
pool.

3357
02:34:07,261 --> 02:34:12,261
Anyway,
yoU imagine if the north koreans love 

3358
02:34:12,261 --> 02:34:15,291
Dennis Robbins,
so much so that they let him become the 

3359
02:34:15,291 --> 02:34:15,291
king and then somehow or other,
in some strange world,

3360
02:34:15,291 --> 02:34:19,911
he goes over there and then all of a 
sudden he starts giving press 

3361
02:34:19,911 --> 02:34:19,911
conferences

3362
02:34:19,911 --> 02:34:19,911
that dennis rodman is now running North 
Korea,

3363
02:34:23,310 --> 02:34:26,260
North Korea.
Listen man,

3364
02:34:26,261 --> 02:34:28,150
it's not outside the realm of 
possibility.

3365
02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:33,270
How many steps removed from that?
Is arnold schwarzenegger running 

3366
02:34:33,270 --> 02:34:33,700
California?
How many steps removed?

3367
02:34:34,060 --> 02:34:38,210
It's only a few.
A few chapters of ridiculous parody that

3368
02:34:38,230 --> 02:34:40,210
Minnesota had a toy governor for a 
while.

3369
02:34:41,080 --> 02:34:44,780
I was on a navy seal and I know about 
chem trails on thermite.

3370
02:34:45,550 --> 02:34:47,790
He can't say he was a pro wrestler.
Yes,

3371
02:34:47,800 --> 02:34:51,130
he was a navy seal medic.
And uh,

3372
02:34:51,160 --> 02:34:52,430
you know,
a huge man.

3373
02:34:52,540 --> 02:34:54,940
The conspiracy theorists to the extreme.
Yeah,

3374
02:34:54,941 --> 02:34:57,520
he's got that show called conspiracy 
theory,

3375
02:34:57,521 --> 02:34:58,720
right?
Yeah,

3376
02:34:58,810 --> 02:34:59,500
yeah,
yeah.

3377
02:34:59,590 --> 02:35:02,350
It's always looking for thermite does.
Does the.

3378
02:35:02,950 --> 02:35:06,580
Does the leader kim il young on name,

3379
02:35:06,990 --> 02:35:10,850
is that correct?
Laura was so.

3380
02:35:10,851 --> 02:35:13,150
It's so american and not be able to show
moon.

3381
02:35:13,330 --> 02:35:14,190
Kim.
Kim jong.

3382
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:19,760
Does he have.
Does he have the legal authority or what

3383
02:35:19,991 --> 02:35:24,991
passes for legal authority to commit 
forces the same way that like the us 

3384
02:35:24,991 --> 02:35:27,430
president can commit forces for 60 or 70
days.

3385
02:35:28,170 --> 02:35:30,480
They declared war on North Korea.
South Korea though.

3386
02:35:30,510 --> 02:35:35,510
Well,
he's essentially a dictatorial were 

3387
02:35:35,510 --> 02:35:37,030
never actually ended up in a ball.
Has been in the state of what was 

3388
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:37,030
essentially a dictator.
Right.

3389
02:35:37,030 --> 02:35:37,260
so I mean,
yeah,

3390
02:35:37,330 --> 02:35:41,390
but he liked.
I liked the iranian president who is now

3391
02:35:41,600 --> 02:35:44,270
really like a very different.
He's like a god.

3392
02:35:44,760 --> 02:35:46,410
I mean he's a.
He's a godhead of.

3393
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:48,890
He's a religious.
He's a religious figure.

3394
02:35:48,891 --> 02:35:50,930
they,
the north koreans are,

3395
02:35:50,960 --> 02:35:52,730
have been indoctrinated.
For example,

3396
02:35:52,731 --> 02:35:54,560
every north korean home,
from what I understand,

3397
02:35:54,561 --> 02:35:59,561
has a speaker and when he,
when the dear leader would speak,

3398
02:36:00,260 --> 02:36:05,260
you had to,
it would blast in your home and you had 

3399
02:36:05,260 --> 02:36:05,360
to memorize that speech.
Oh jesus,

3400
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:10,400
man,
if I had one of those and I can make 

3401
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:10,400
everybody do that,

3402
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:13,810
what would just be to be around.
Although I think of something good 

3403
02:36:13,810 --> 02:36:13,810
though,
man.

3404
02:36:13,810 --> 02:36:16,770
It's like,
what would you say if you could say so 

3405
02:36:16,770 --> 02:36:17,290
over cook diver?
Dark people will be like,

3406
02:36:17,291 --> 02:36:20,130
what the fuck is our dear leader talking
about overcooked divert.

3407
02:36:20,170 --> 02:36:23,830
That is people.
Sugar's bad.

3408
02:36:24,800 --> 02:36:27,490
Total.
So social problem.

3409
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:30,700
I know there's cupcakes aren't good for 
you,

3410
02:36:30,701 --> 02:36:33,580
but god damnit.
Here's what we gotta eat enough.

3411
02:36:33,581 --> 02:36:36,760
Good food that you could do this.
So that's the balance to life.

3412
02:36:37,270 --> 02:36:39,130
Balanced life is pell shakes and 
cupcakes.

3413
02:36:39,150 --> 02:36:44,150
Yep.
You got to be able to work them all 

3414
02:36:44,150 --> 02:36:47,170
together in a tee shirt.
Kale shakes and cupcakes.

3415
02:36:47,640 --> 02:36:50,560
It was important.
Been delicious.

3416
02:36:50,561 --> 02:36:52,180
Food.
Passion will wine.

3417
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:54,130
I love wine.
What's important?

3418
02:36:54,131 --> 02:36:55,330
Hey,
we gotta drink some good wine.

3419
02:36:55,870 --> 02:36:57,930
Pay since you're richer than I.
I'll do it.

3420
02:36:58,060 --> 02:37:01,110
I don't give a fuck,
I love going.

3421
02:37:01,810 --> 02:37:04,330
Rogue is the greatest.
We've go to dinner one time and this and

3422
02:37:04,360 --> 02:37:06,400
I and I was like,
I had been reading about wine,

3423
02:37:06,550 --> 02:37:08,980
so I looked at the list and I was like,
I'm going to choose.

3424
02:37:09,030 --> 02:37:14,030
I guess we'll get the right bank board 
doe here and now I'm asking questions 

3425
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:14,030
and rubbing the,
hey,

3426
02:37:14,030 --> 02:37:14,080
hey,
fuck face.

3427
02:37:14,140 --> 02:37:16,070
Let me show you the joe rogan way of 
ordering

3428
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:16,850
wine.
He goes,

3429
02:37:17,630 --> 02:37:19,000
oh,
that's expensive as shit.

3430
02:37:19,020 --> 02:37:22,160
We'll get that one.
You're ruining everything.

3431
02:37:22,161 --> 02:37:23,540
I'm trying to impress people.
I'm like,

3432
02:37:23,550 --> 02:37:24,770
no,
brian.

3433
02:37:24,790 --> 02:37:26,970
We like pretend to understand.
See,

3434
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:32,020
one of the reasons why I have very 
little tolerance with you when it comes 

3435
02:37:32,020 --> 02:37:32,390
to that is that I have my other good 
friend,

3436
02:37:32,391 --> 02:37:36,990
matt and lichtenberg,
who's a huge one fanatic and legit think

3437
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:40,530
I has a fucking crazy wine cellar 
temperature control.

3438
02:37:40,531 --> 02:37:45,531
That's how ancient wines and shit and 
all these important ones and that 

3439
02:37:45,531 --> 02:37:48,150
motherfucker knows why you don't know 
what you're talking.

3440
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:49,980
Shit.
I called matt up.

3441
02:37:50,660 --> 02:37:52,400
I can call matt up and go,
hey matt.

3442
02:37:52,401 --> 02:37:53,060
I go,
uh,

3443
02:37:53,061 --> 02:37:54,410
this is my choices.
You know,

3444
02:37:54,411 --> 02:37:59,411
a bordeaux from blah blah blah,
or a bubba bubba and he'll tell you 

3445
02:37:59,411 --> 02:38:02,451
about Oregon in 2007 is this shit.
If you can get a pino from Oregon for 

3446
02:38:02,451 --> 02:38:05,860
2007 and it's this particular vineyard,
he just knows.

3447
02:38:05,860 --> 02:38:08,140
He knows he's a,
he's a legit wine kind of.

3448
02:38:08,540 --> 02:38:13,540
I went to his birthday party and they 
had this really nutty dinner where they 

3449
02:38:13,540 --> 02:38:14,730
gave what they call flights of wine.
That stuff.

3450
02:38:15,220 --> 02:38:20,220
Yeah,
and they were all like drinking it and 

3451
02:38:20,220 --> 02:38:20,720
describing the earthy tones.
And this one is oak and this one.

3452
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:22,430
That's my favorite thing to do.
I'll do that all day.

3453
02:38:23,760 --> 02:38:25,370
I will.
What I will do,

3454
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:27,530
I'll sit there and I love.
Pretend I.

3455
02:38:27,531 --> 02:38:28,760
I love it.
I'll wear it.

3456
02:38:28,970 --> 02:38:31,070
I'll wear a tweed jacket.
I'll wear a scarf.

3457
02:38:31,100 --> 02:38:32,630
You wear.
I would definitely wear a scarf.

3458
02:38:32,750 --> 02:38:34,920
Yeah.
When I'm bringing up is the vertical.

3459
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:36,870
there's a vertical and the horizontal 
flight,

3460
02:38:37,170 --> 02:38:38,250
right?
I don't know.

3461
02:38:38,290 --> 02:38:43,290
Vertical flight would be a horizontal 
flight would be where you take a year 

3462
02:38:43,770 --> 02:38:47,610
and you go into like all the,
like all the great bordeauxs and you get

3463
02:38:47,670 --> 02:38:51,810
their bordeaux from that year is a 
horizontal flight,

3464
02:38:51,860 --> 02:38:56,860
a vertical flight is you take a specific
vineyard and you collect all the years 

3465
02:38:58,921 --> 02:39:03,921
from that specific vineyard,
so you might host a vertical and it's 

3466
02:39:03,921 --> 02:39:05,850
like chateau whatever,
19,

3467
02:39:05,851 --> 02:39:10,440
20 to 1945 and you're going to taste a 
25 year span out of that.

3468
02:39:11,010 --> 02:39:16,010
Wow.
Right now I'm in the reason I know this 

3469
02:39:16,010 --> 02:39:18,820
and I want to do a shameless plug.
My buddy ben wallace has this great 

3470
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:19,170
book,
the billionaire's vinegar and it's about

3471
02:39:19,800 --> 02:39:21,630
the most expensive bottle of wine ever 
sold,

3472
02:39:21,631 --> 02:39:24,690
but like what is good wine?
Do we know good wine when we taste?

3473
02:39:25,030 --> 02:39:25,920
It's fascinating.

3474
02:39:26,010 --> 02:39:27,720
Well,
if you get really old shit,

3475
02:39:27,900 --> 02:39:29,740
most likely it's not good anymore.
Right.

3476
02:39:29,820 --> 02:39:34,710
The problem is as his book explains is 
the problem is no one.

3477
02:39:34,740 --> 02:39:37,020
This is a bottle.
The most immense bottled wine ever sold.

3478
02:39:37,050 --> 02:39:42,050
Why don't be in fraudulent,
but it was purported to be owned by 

3479
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:42,050
Thomas Jefferson.
Okay.

3480
02:39:42,050 --> 02:39:46,340
So for like steve forbes zoned it for 
awhile and all these different guys on 

3481
02:39:46,340 --> 02:39:50,001
this bottle of wine,
one of the koch brothers don't want it 

3482
02:39:50,001 --> 02:39:51,690
for a while and in the end there's no 
one around who can go.

3483
02:39:51,720 --> 02:39:54,580
I've had a lot of wine from that year,
right?

3484
02:39:55,680 --> 02:40:00,680
That's right on the money.
It isn't it crazy though that these 

3485
02:40:00,871 --> 02:40:03,990
different rich guys had the wine and 
sold it to each other.

3486
02:40:03,991 --> 02:40:06,680
Like they passed it off.
The

3487
02:40:06,790 --> 02:40:11,790
forbes stored in a.
They put it in a in their corporate 

3488
02:40:11,790 --> 02:40:14,300
headquarters and they had an a box,
like a glass boxes of decoration,

3489
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:19,310
but they had standing upright with a 
heat lamp in there laying dried that 

3490
02:40:19,310 --> 02:40:23,871
cork out of the bottle.
So later when people were trying to 

3491
02:40:23,871 --> 02:40:28,251
analyze what was in it,
there can never rule out the intrusion 

3492
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:33,410
of foreign substances,
which will not allow them to find out 

3493
02:40:33,410 --> 02:40:36,231
what it was.
The guy that eventually like is why the 

3494
02:40:36,231 --> 02:40:39,110
guy who created the hoax would take 
really good wine and do weird stuff to 

3495
02:40:40,531 --> 02:40:45,531
it.
Like he put a little bit of vanilla 

3496
02:40:45,531 --> 02:40:47,060
extract and air or he'd put some dirt 
from his gutter and they're just weird 

3497
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:51,531
things he could do to kind of throw 
people and then guys that are like big 

3498
02:40:51,531 --> 02:40:53,140
swinging dicks about wine would taste 
and be like,

3499
02:40:53,141 --> 02:40:53,660
oh yeah,

3500
02:40:55,630 --> 02:40:57,780
great.
I got it.

3501
02:40:58,170 --> 02:41:03,170
It's a brilliant book.
I got invited by him

3502
02:41:04,490 --> 02:41:05,600
by a,
by a popper,

3503
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:10,700
a huge guy owned a paparazzi company and
he invited me to a wine tasting and he 

3504
02:41:10,700 --> 02:41:11,240
said,
he said,

3505
02:41:11,300 --> 02:41:12,490
and he goes,
I,

3506
02:41:12,510 --> 02:41:14,420
I don't want.
You can't really.

3507
02:41:14,421 --> 02:41:15,600
He was trying to be really nice 
sneakers.

3508
02:41:15,950 --> 02:41:17,630
I'm going to bring one for my seller for
you.

3509
02:41:17,631 --> 02:41:18,190
I said,
why?

3510
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:21,080
He whining,
I don't want to be a dick to you,

3511
02:41:21,081 --> 02:41:23,540
but you can't afford the wines were 
going to bring.

3512
02:41:23,870 --> 02:41:24,850
And I go,
all right,

3513
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,980
jeez.
How much was the most expensive?

3514
02:41:27,330 --> 02:41:30,140
like literally I was doing in 1961 stony
hills.

3515
02:41:30,141 --> 02:41:32,480
I mean I was drinking like wines that 
you would cost,

3516
02:41:32,510 --> 02:41:35,460
costs you a thousand dollars to drink 
either.

3517
02:41:35,530 --> 02:41:37,430
The taster for zach,
he's wine.

3518
02:41:37,431 --> 02:41:40,130
The guy who sets the standard was there.
So anyway,

3519
02:41:40,131 --> 02:41:41,070
I,
I do,

3520
02:41:41,071 --> 02:41:43,340
I go there and I'm drinking crazy.
Nineteen,

3521
02:41:43,341 --> 02:41:44,120
60,
19,

3522
02:41:44,121 --> 02:41:45,420
63.
Nineteen is like,

3523
02:41:45,660 --> 02:41:46,700
what is it like?
Well,

3524
02:41:46,701 --> 02:41:48,200
for me,
because I love wine so much,

3525
02:41:48,201 --> 02:41:50,600
there is a difference now.
Now here's the thing,

3526
02:41:50,840 --> 02:41:54,050
if you spend $300 on a bottle of wine,
there's a big difference.

3527
02:41:54,051 --> 02:41:58,160
You're going to taste an amazing wine if
you know what to get versus a $50 bottle

3528
02:41:58,161 --> 02:41:58,970
of wine.
However,

3529
02:41:59,480 --> 02:42:01,850
the difference between $300 and a 
thousand dollars,

3530
02:42:01,910 --> 02:42:05,330
I don't think there's no difference.
Now you're talking about scarcity.

3531
02:42:05,360 --> 02:42:10,360
okay.
now you're going into like years and 

3532
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:10,360
there's one left and stuff.

3533
02:42:10,360 --> 02:42:11,030
I want to back up though because I want 
to clarify.

3534
02:42:11,240 --> 02:42:14,180
It's too easy to hack on one kind of 
sewers.

3535
02:42:14,900 --> 02:42:16,280
I want.
I do want to say this,

3536
02:42:17,630 --> 02:42:22,630
the handful of times someone did present
to me what's like critically regarded as

3537
02:42:23,421 --> 02:42:26,570
a good one.
I was able to taste that one and say,

3538
02:42:27,500 --> 02:42:31,310
I get what you're saying.
there's something going on here that was

3539
02:42:31,311 --> 02:42:36,311
not going on.
And all the other one I've had my whole 

3540
02:42:36,311 --> 02:42:36,320
life,
it's wasted on me.

3541
02:42:37,470 --> 02:42:39,760
It's always something.
But I recognize what you're saying,

3542
02:42:39,761 --> 02:42:42,700
there's something going on,
so I don't want to act like it's all.

3543
02:42:42,701 --> 02:42:43,960
I don't think it's all smoke and 
mirrors.

3544
02:42:43,961 --> 02:42:46,700
It's not all bs at all,
all bs.

3545
02:42:46,750 --> 02:42:48,530
And it's amazing the subtle differences 
in,

3546
02:42:48,580 --> 02:42:50,330
in different glass one.
And

3547
02:42:50,340 --> 02:42:51,810
I,
I always equate it to this.

3548
02:42:51,811 --> 02:42:53,910
Like if I drink,
I'd amazing bottle of wine,

3549
02:42:54,180 --> 02:42:59,180
like say 500 or whatever.
Like my friend made a fortunate that 

3550
02:42:59,180 --> 02:42:59,180
he's huge wine guy.
Like your buddy.

3551
02:42:59,180 --> 02:43:03,920
I always describe it this way.
I go when I drink an amazing glass of 

3552
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:03,920
wine,
I say to them,

3553
02:43:03,920 --> 02:43:03,920
I,
I,

3554
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:05,820
the way I,
the reason it's expensive,

3555
02:43:05,821 --> 02:43:07,650
I go,
nothing else tastes like that,

3556
02:43:07,830 --> 02:43:09,450
that,
that taste,

3557
02:43:09,480 --> 02:43:11,800
that experience stands on its own.
You don't compete.

3558
02:43:11,801 --> 02:43:12,180
You go,

3559
02:43:12,370 --> 02:43:13,480
oh,
it tastes just like this.

3560
02:43:13,481 --> 02:43:15,400
No,
it stands on its own.

3561
02:43:15,520 --> 02:43:19,360
It's so complex and it's an experience 
for me.

3562
02:43:19,361 --> 02:43:21,310
I love it.
If you had to choose though,

3563
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:26,400
if you had to choose between like no 
wine for the rest of your life or blend 

3564
02:43:26,861 --> 02:43:29,030
food,
what would you like?

3565
02:43:29,050 --> 02:43:34,050
What is more important?
The taste of food or to go 100 percent 

3566
02:43:34,050 --> 02:43:34,390
right?
I can live without one.

3567
02:43:34,391 --> 02:43:35,470
No problem.
Yeah,

3568
02:43:35,471 --> 02:43:37,030
I to go.
I don't need one.

3569
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,080
I like it.

3570
02:43:38,160 --> 02:43:38,580
Yeah.
Yeah.

3571
02:43:38,581 --> 02:43:41,190
When I'm.
When I'm eating very high quality.

3572
02:43:41,191 --> 02:43:43,080
Good food though.
I won't have again.

3573
02:43:43,410 --> 02:43:46,650
I typically I like to.
I like to eat it with water.

3574
02:43:46,740 --> 02:43:47,040
Yeah.

3575
02:43:47,240 --> 02:43:47,740
Yeah.
Me too.

3576
02:43:48,440 --> 02:43:50,690
Me too.
sometimes you have food that's so good.

3577
02:43:50,720 --> 02:43:55,720
like I was just just in Louisiana this 
weekend and I went to this restaurant 

3578
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:56,960
called revolution.
I had a nokia lobster and yucky.

3579
02:43:57,550 --> 02:43:58,590
I don't like the way you say.

3580
02:43:59,350 --> 02:44:04,350
We say Afghanistan.
I don't like any of these endeavors.

3581
02:44:05,410 --> 02:44:10,410
Knowledge.
I had a crawfish crawfish given a nod

3582
02:44:14,990 --> 02:44:16,130
toward.
No,

3583
02:44:16,170 --> 02:44:16,670
I like it.

3584
02:44:16,930 --> 02:44:19,600
Yeah,
but I'm not going to start doing.

3585
02:44:19,601 --> 02:44:21,340
But like you're kind of saying like,
yeah man.

3586
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:24,640
More to the earth.
There's more to the globe.

3587
02:44:24,970 --> 02:44:25,510
No,

3588
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:27,960
I liked they're going to demonstrate 
this,

3589
02:44:27,961 --> 02:44:31,590
but to me it's like the gold chains of 
language.

3590
02:44:31,860 --> 02:44:34,080
He just showed up with a bunch of 
fucking language.

3591
02:44:34,081 --> 02:44:36,210
Gold trades.
I was in Bahrain,

3592
02:44:36,950 --> 02:44:41,670
spend time in France.
I worked on in Afghanistan.

3593
02:44:43,230 --> 02:44:45,870
The taliban,
when I was visiting Chile,

3594
02:44:46,270 --> 02:44:49,620
we,
I say it,

3595
02:44:49,640 --> 02:44:53,320
steve,
steve,

3596
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:53,820
steve,

3597
02:44:56,810 --> 02:44:59,700
his family's had good rabbit,
but if really,

3598
02:44:59,740 --> 02:45:04,740
really good food is,
is another thing that's transcendental 

3599
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:04,740
man.
I don't need good wine,

3600
02:45:04,740 --> 02:45:05,860
but I do need good food.
You know?

3601
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:09,610
That's why when we were talking about 
your friend who doesn't like food,

3602
02:45:09,611 --> 02:45:11,050
I have a friend who's just like that 
too.

3603
02:45:11,051 --> 02:45:12,220
He's like,
I just want to.

3604
02:45:12,230 --> 02:45:14,470
I just want to eat and then get done and
then do my thing.

3605
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:15,610
It's like,
man,

3606
02:45:15,611 --> 02:45:16,450
I was like,
I get it,

3607
02:45:16,660 --> 02:45:19,450
but maybe he's just tastes things 
different than I do.

3608
02:45:19,900 --> 02:45:24,900
A dane cook has to be.
Some people like shit and other people 

3609
02:45:24,900 --> 02:45:26,530
hate it.
Like I love sea urchin.

3610
02:45:26,740 --> 02:45:31,740
I think it tastes delicious too,
but I've tried to give people sea 

3611
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:31,740
urchin.
They're lIke,

3612
02:45:31,740 --> 02:45:32,290
this is gusting.
Oh my god.

3613
02:45:32,291 --> 02:45:34,240
Like they spit into a napkin,
like,

3614
02:45:34,330 --> 02:45:36,460
oh,
I like dangerous.

3615
02:45:36,670 --> 02:45:38,920
We'll make a,
make a monastic decision.

3616
02:45:40,230 --> 02:45:41,470
They're kind of,
they're kind of like,

3617
02:45:41,471 --> 02:45:42,260
you know,
with all,

3618
02:45:42,280 --> 02:45:42,880
you know,
whatever,

3619
02:45:43,250 --> 02:45:45,910
all the human suffering in the world or 
whatever.

3620
02:45:45,911 --> 02:45:47,540
It's like,
you know,

3621
02:45:47,960 --> 02:45:50,170
I don't want to be a glutton in that 
way.

3622
02:45:50,210 --> 02:45:52,880
I look at it differently.
I look at it as I have the.

3623
02:45:53,180 --> 02:45:55,100
I have the opportunity.
He incredible food.

3624
02:45:55,130 --> 02:45:57,350
I'm gonna.
Eat this for the people that can and I'm

3625
02:45:57,351 --> 02:45:58,860
going to pay attention to support.
Okay.

3626
02:45:58,861 --> 02:45:58,920
Of

3627
02:45:58,930 --> 02:46:01,330
all the suffering people,
I'm going to enjoy this meal.

3628
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:06,450
yeah,
as long as you're not victimizing 

3629
02:46:06,450 --> 02:46:06,450
someone in,
in,

3630
02:46:06,450 --> 02:46:06,730
you're enjoying that food,
you should just be enjoying that food.

3631
02:46:06,750 --> 02:46:09,920
Enjoy that moment.
The idea that human beings have to be in

3632
02:46:09,921 --> 02:46:14,180
perspective of $6,
million other fucking people is so crazy

3633
02:46:14,420 --> 02:46:19,420
because otherwise you'll never be happy.
You'll never be happy because the world 

3634
02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:19,420
is filled with suffering.
I mean,

3635
02:46:19,420 --> 02:46:23,591
there's just always tragic instances 
happening all over the world where 

3636
02:46:23,591 --> 02:46:23,591
people getting hit in the head by 
coconuts,

3637
02:46:23,591 --> 02:46:24,980
okay,
you should not be.

3638
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:27,170
should not be eating and enjoying your 
steak because some,

3639
02:46:27,350 --> 02:46:32,350
some poor farmer got hit in the head 
with a coconut and fucking dog because 

3640
02:46:32,350 --> 02:46:32,350
that shit happens 150 times a year.
Right,

3641
02:46:32,350 --> 02:46:37,180
and not only that,
but what about the fact that are people 

3642
02:46:37,180 --> 02:46:39,791
who can really cook,
that's an art form to dedicate their 

3643
02:46:39,791 --> 02:46:43,121
life to it and it makes your life if 
it's just makes the world a better 

3644
02:46:43,121 --> 02:46:43,121
place.

3645
02:46:43,121 --> 02:46:47,080
I want to live in a world with bad,
with bad food or food to where people 

3646
02:46:47,080 --> 02:46:48,980
don't take care of you.
Do you'd rather live in that world,

3647
02:46:49,280 --> 02:46:52,100
the not being alive.
Someone said,

3648
02:46:52,101 --> 02:46:52,700
all right,
no,

3649
02:46:52,701 --> 02:46:53,510
no,
no,

3650
02:46:54,190 --> 02:46:59,190
no good food,
but also knows ombuds or good food and 

3651
02:46:59,190 --> 02:46:59,190
zombies,
zombies,

3652
02:46:59,190 --> 02:47:02,030
so I can have an arsenal.
She could have an awesome.

3653
02:47:02,090 --> 02:47:07,090
You can have an arsenal.
Can you imagine what pigment and nugent 

3654
02:47:07,090 --> 02:47:09,340
would do if we had good food in zombies 
in this special on twitter the other 

3655
02:47:10,551 --> 02:47:15,551
day,
the best show ever would be a 

3656
02:47:15,551 --> 02:47:15,551
combination of the walking dead and duck
dynasty.

3657
02:47:15,551 --> 02:47:18,760
These dudes that go out to have theIr 
fucking wacky stunts like pretending.

3658
02:47:18,761 --> 02:47:20,420
Well,
I couldn't open the door,

3659
02:47:20,421 --> 02:47:25,421
so I called bob up this fake scenario 
and then all of a sudden they all get 

3660
02:47:25,421 --> 02:47:29,801
eaten by zombies.
I just ripped that fucking throats out 

3661
02:47:29,801 --> 02:47:32,740
as they're filming that shitty show and 
they start their either beard.

3662
02:47:32,810 --> 02:47:37,810
I made their and brains mixed in with 
beard and they're trying to choke it 

3663
02:47:38,901 --> 02:47:43,901
down,
throwing up zombies throw up because 

3664
02:47:43,901 --> 02:47:44,860
they can't eat their beard.
No wonder one of the first time,

3665
02:47:44,870 --> 02:47:45,470
like one of the

3666
02:47:45,790 --> 02:47:48,440
tv meetings I ever had was years ago now
it was like,

3667
02:47:48,550 --> 02:47:53,550
I think it was 2004.
I had a tv meeting where a guy in an 

3668
02:47:53,550 --> 02:47:56,620
assigned explained to me the most 
brilliant show that he was doing,

3669
02:47:56,621 --> 02:47:58,480
but I don't think that ever happened and
it was going to be.

3670
02:47:58,481 --> 02:48:02,620
he was trying.
He was pitching around the show that was

3671
02:48:02,621 --> 02:48:06,130
going to be.
It was gonna start like a reality show.

3672
02:48:06,140 --> 02:48:08,110
We make our big live in a house.
Okay.

3673
02:48:08,950 --> 02:48:13,950
And you know,
you foment the typical like inner 

3674
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:13,950
personal conflict.
All right.

3675
02:48:13,950 --> 02:48:18,720
And as it would go on,
things would start getting so unusual.

3676
02:48:19,720 --> 02:48:22,450
He was already like,
right when reality tv was starting,

3677
02:48:22,451 --> 02:48:27,451
he was already.
He was already trying to think of what 

3678
02:48:27,451 --> 02:48:29,131
he was ahead of his time.
He's already thinking like how to toy 

3679
02:48:29,131 --> 02:48:31,171
with it.
Then he wanted to have it get like 

3680
02:48:31,171 --> 02:48:33,390
increasingly outrageous to build up 
where people would say like there's no 

3681
02:48:33,390 --> 02:48:34,000
way,
there's no way.

3682
02:48:34,270 --> 02:48:36,490
And he wanted to bring it to the point 
where there was a murder,

3683
02:48:37,060 --> 02:48:38,260
whoa,
you know,

3684
02:48:38,620 --> 02:48:41,740
and then there'd be a murder and then 
the people in the reality.

3685
02:48:41,741 --> 02:48:46,741
So it'd be trying to like hide the fact 
that they killed one of the roommates 

3686
02:48:46,741 --> 02:48:48,730
and they would make this very gradual 
segue into drama.

3687
02:48:48,820 --> 02:48:50,470
And I was like,
that is the most genius thing,

3688
02:48:50,830 --> 02:48:51,910
but I don't think he ever.

3689
02:48:52,570 --> 02:48:55,000
Well,
was he trying for an actual real murder?

3690
02:48:55,540 --> 02:48:55,800
No,
no,

3691
02:48:55,830 --> 02:48:55,950
no,
no,

3692
02:48:55,960 --> 02:49:00,960
no.
He was just going to do you going to 

3693
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:00,960
fake it.
A scripted reality.

3694
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:01,420
He's got the script that like a reality 
show.

3695
02:49:01,480 --> 02:49:05,680
The viewers would like.
The viewers don't really understand that

3696
02:49:05,681 --> 02:49:08,070
reality shows are cast and scripted.

3697
02:49:08,280 --> 02:49:11,040
He was going to like toy with this idea 
right when it was starting to happen.

3698
02:49:11,041 --> 02:49:13,800
Like real real world to mtv real world 
type thing,

3699
02:49:14,190 --> 02:49:19,190
but build it in as he lost,
as he courted like in an incredulous 

3700
02:49:19,981 --> 02:49:21,840
response.
And is viewership being like,

3701
02:49:21,841 --> 02:49:23,490
there's no way,
there's no way they didn't do that.

3702
02:49:23,491 --> 02:49:28,491
That didn't happen to like push it so 
far that the final tipping point would 

3703
02:49:28,491 --> 02:49:31,170
be they actually kill somebody in the 
house,

3704
02:49:31,200 --> 02:49:32,880
but they don't really kill someone in 
the house.

3705
02:49:32,881 --> 02:49:35,730
It's just that,
that point it jumped to being like,

3706
02:49:36,150 --> 02:49:37,260
we've been drawing.
Yeah,

3707
02:49:37,261 --> 02:49:40,230
we've been messing with you the whole 
time.

3708
02:49:40,231 --> 02:49:42,240
This is all just us playing with you.

3709
02:49:42,300 --> 02:49:45,750
That's duck dynasty.
That's the fucking show.

3710
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:48,330
Maybe that was the guy I just never 
heard anything about beards.

3711
02:49:49,040 --> 02:49:52,740
They fade out and dress it up and beards
because they looked like zz top.

3712
02:49:52,741 --> 02:49:55,710
I love these.
Listen,

3713
02:49:55,850 --> 02:49:57,660
we've got to wrap this pitch up and 
bring it home.

3714
02:49:57,760 --> 02:49:59,370
There's been a lot of fun.
Cam.

3715
02:49:59,371 --> 02:50:00,390
Thanks for coming on,
man.

3716
02:50:00,890 --> 02:50:05,890
Sorry you had to share a microphone.
But this is a really low tech fucking 

3717
02:50:05,890 --> 02:50:09,201
studio.
I need to get my act together is the 

3718
02:50:09,201 --> 02:50:09,201
most people who've ever had a microphone
and it worked out.

3719
02:50:09,201 --> 02:50:09,840
We did it.
This is awesome.

3720
02:50:09,870 --> 02:50:11,190
thanks for having me on man.
Um,

3721
02:50:11,191 --> 02:50:11,820
and so,
uh,

3722
02:50:11,850 --> 02:50:13,950
April 28th is uh,
the,

3723
02:50:13,951 --> 02:50:15,290
uh,
the show on eater.

3724
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:17,760
It's on the sportsmans channel,
uh,

3725
02:50:17,970 --> 02:50:20,490
can find it on the internet and your 
local.

3726
02:50:20,550 --> 02:50:22,170
Why don't we do in a skin man?
When we were hunting again,

3727
02:50:22,380 --> 02:50:22,830
what are we do?

3728
02:50:23,360 --> 02:50:24,560
Line it up.
I have like,

3729
02:50:24,561 --> 02:50:26,900
I could always justify it.
Let's do it.

3730
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:28,150
Yeah,
come on man.

3731
02:50:28,320 --> 02:50:30,730
Let me go.
I think we should do a wild pig thing.

3732
02:50:30,790 --> 02:50:32,710
Let's do it from the ground.
From the ground.

3733
02:50:32,850 --> 02:50:34,860
Yeah.
No helicopters do.

3734
02:50:34,960 --> 02:50:36,070
April 25th,
26th,

3735
02:50:36,071 --> 02:50:36,820
27th,
28th.

3736
02:50:36,821 --> 02:50:38,510
Because I'll be in edmonton at the comic
strip.

3737
02:50:40,560 --> 02:50:42,700
I'm not playing in alberta.
Canada.

3738
02:50:42,701 --> 02:50:44,190
Yeah.
I'll just be there to explain it.

3739
02:50:44,210 --> 02:50:47,200
But at the April 25th,
26th,

3740
02:50:47,201 --> 02:50:48,270
27th and 28th.
All right.

3741
02:50:48,280 --> 02:50:49,960
We're going to work it out,
but we're all going together again.

3742
02:50:51,580 --> 02:50:53,320
Absolutely committed northern 
California.

3743
02:50:54,500 --> 02:50:58,030
And so you'll see our show.
I've watched both of them.

3744
02:50:58,060 --> 02:50:59,230
It was really fun,
man.

3745
02:50:59,231 --> 02:51:03,040
It was such a good experience.
Some of the best food.

3746
02:51:03,041 --> 02:51:04,990
I've it most satisfying food I've ever 
eaten in my life.

3747
02:51:04,991 --> 02:51:09,991
We're sitting down on the ground 10 
degrees outside cooking deer over a 

3748
02:51:09,991 --> 02:51:10,780
fire.
we'll do it again.

3749
02:51:10,781 --> 02:51:11,910
Couldn't have been,
couldn't have been more fun.

3750
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:14,740
Cashmere killer.
The cashmere cashmere.

3751
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:17,170
I'm writing a blog about the entire,
uh,

3752
02:51:17,171 --> 02:51:22,171
event that I will put up this because I 
have pictures of brian taking a shit 

3753
02:51:22,171 --> 02:51:26,461
outside and we put a flag and aluminum 
foil in it and we're going to offer a 

3754
02:51:26,461 --> 02:51:28,540
money on twitter,
like a thousand dollars.

3755
02:51:28,770 --> 02:51:31,690
You could find it and take a picture of 
their face next to brian shed.

3756
02:51:31,691 --> 02:51:33,070
If you can find it on the Missouri 
breaks.

3757
02:51:33,071 --> 02:51:36,440
We'll give you a rough description of 
excluded.

3758
02:51:36,650 --> 02:51:37,520
Yeah,
you're excluding.

3759
02:51:38,690 --> 02:51:43,690
Turns out We had a,
we had to put the poop and 

3760
02:51:43,690 --> 02:51:43,690
biodegradable.
These bags,

3761
02:51:43,690 --> 02:51:48,661
you have to take your poop with it.
You're not supposed to leave your poop 

3762
02:51:48,661 --> 02:51:50,460
behind.
So it was often more tricKy to find 

3763
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:51,830
shit.
Bags were space,

3764
02:51:51,910 --> 02:51:56,910
a space age.
There's nothing quite like the first 

3765
02:51:56,910 --> 02:51:58,450
night being outside the tent,
shitting into a bag.

3766
02:51:58,470 --> 02:52:00,400
My pants down,
pouring rain.

3767
02:52:00,610 --> 02:52:04,060
Just not quite cold enough to freeze,
which just pouring rain.

3768
02:52:04,061 --> 02:52:06,040
I'm shitting into a bag on.
Whoa.

3769
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:08,020
I was trying to clean my butt with my 
thermos.

3770
02:52:08,560 --> 02:52:10,480
How sound of running water to me,
I was like,

3771
02:52:10,540 --> 02:52:12,190
ah,
I ran out of water.

3772
02:52:12,200 --> 02:52:13,800
I'm cleaning my fucking,
but I have to.

3773
02:52:13,960 --> 02:52:16,420
I have to ask this before we.
Are we going to release the ravine,

3774
02:52:16,421 --> 02:52:18,580
comer footage and put that on the 
internet.

3775
02:52:18,581 --> 02:52:23,581
Is it possible?
It just isn't because it just isn't 

3776
02:52:23,581 --> 02:52:23,581
because it would.

3777
02:52:23,620 --> 02:52:28,620
I worked for people.
Is there a way that you can't have me 

3778
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:30,260
coming in?
Here's the better answer.

3779
02:52:30,650 --> 02:52:33,260
I'm not the guy that's dead serious.
I'm not the.

3780
02:52:33,261 --> 02:52:37,160
I wouldn't be the editor over there.
Whoever is the editor.

3781
02:52:37,161 --> 02:52:39,430
I got a bag of weed with your name on it
and I know,

3782
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:41,600
okay,
let's make this happen.

3783
02:52:41,601 --> 02:52:44,270
We need to get through ravine calmer and
we need to get it on the internet and me

3784
02:52:44,271 --> 02:52:45,770
pulling quotes out of your rump.
Yeah,

3785
02:52:45,771 --> 02:52:47,040
that was fun.
I know that we made.

3786
02:52:47,070 --> 02:52:49,040
That's,
that's out there on the internet.

3787
02:52:49,440 --> 02:52:52,010
Is it on the internet or if they were a 
family program,

3788
02:52:52,220 --> 02:52:54,380
but we that's out there.
We're putting that.

3789
02:52:54,381 --> 02:52:55,190
Okay,
beautiful.

3790
02:52:55,300 --> 02:52:56,150
Yeah.
Brian,

3791
02:52:56,180 --> 02:52:59,510
for like an hour of pulled was a quilt 
out of my ass,

3792
02:52:59,780 --> 02:53:01,550
you know,
it was very heartfelt man.

3793
02:53:01,551 --> 02:53:05,090
it was very heartfelt and it made me 
appreciate you guys' friendship.

3794
02:53:06,320 --> 02:53:08,300
You were joking about it.
You were joking about it,

3795
02:53:08,301 --> 02:53:09,630
but he did it.
Oh no,

3796
02:53:09,650 --> 02:53:10,310
look.
You know what I mean?

3797
