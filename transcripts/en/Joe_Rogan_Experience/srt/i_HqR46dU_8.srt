00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:03,990

We're back.
Dadda Dadda Dadda Dadda Dadda Dadda

00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,720
Dadda Dadda.

00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,180
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
podcast is brought to you by stamps.com

9
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:30,510
You don't want to be in that fucking
line talking to some person that doesn't

10
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:34,920
want to talk to you waiting and waiting
while some asshole in front of you is

11
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:38,880
trying to buy stamps.
Tourist me do this shit on your own

12
00:00:38,881 --> 00:00:40,590
computer.
It's way easier.

13
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:44,070
You do it all printed out.
You measure it yourself.

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:46,770
They give you a scale.
It's US sweet deal.

15
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:50,430
If you click on the old school,

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,450

One that Brian Red Band himself uses

21
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:10,410
when he sends out those kitty cat tee
shirts and makes it so a person can

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:34,910
We're also brought to you by audible.com
the best resource on the Internet.

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,290
If you're looking for audio
entertainment,

28
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:41,610
whether it's books or radio shows like
the opiate Anthony show,

29
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,480
I believe they have some podcasts on
there as well that we thought they had

30
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:47,640
Dan Carlin's podcasts,
but we were mistaken.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,440
I want to talk to Dan about it.
He was like,

32
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:50,700
no,
you're just making that shit up.

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,500
I love that guy.
What a great guy,

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
and he's a great guy.

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,280
If you listened to his podcast,
you'll like him even more.

36
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,310
Once you listen to the podcast,
then you really liked the guy because

37
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,360
you're like,
ah,

38
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,980
this is fucking,
this guy's like,

39
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,080
he's making a masterpiece.
You know,

40
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:06,420
what we're doing is just sitting around
talking shit.

41
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,580
And uh,
I appreciate that you guys enjoy it.

42
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:11,460
But the amount of effort that goes into
doing one of these,

43
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,620
it's,
it's,

44
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,140
you know,
it's so tiny compared to what he's

45
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,870
doing.
He's essentially doing a real audio book

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,220
every time he released as a podcast.
So it takes a few weeks to put each one

47
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:25,320
out,
but they're masterpieces and the,

48
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,420
he's so dramatic.
Like it makes,

49
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:30,810
uh,
it makes listening to history exciting.

50
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,960
Um,
but there's a lot of fucking cool books

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,200
that they have on audible.com.
There's a plethora over 100,000

52
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:41,890
different titles.
They even have standup comedy.

53
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,530
Uh,
I know they have some of my shit up

54
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:44,120
there.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,570
Uh,
it's a a sweet,

56
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:47,670
what does that Ender's game?
Who's a,

57
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,350
what book is that?
What does that,

58
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,650
I've heard of this before.
It's a,

59
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,690
it's a,
it's the war with like in a hundred

60
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,280
years into the future.
It's really good.

61
00:02:56,281 --> 00:02:59,890
It's a 20 it's 20 years old is really,
Huh?

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,170
20 years ago was not that long ago.
How weird is that?

63
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,050
I see coming out about it.
I just think 20 years ago it was like,

64
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,370
God,
it was so long ago.

65
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,810
And when you were a kid,
it's like God,

66
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,650
20 years ago it was the 19th sixties
what the fuck?

67
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,300
You know,
how ridiculous is that?

68
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,350
And then you realize,
oh,

69
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,630
that shit happens rather quick.
Yeah.

70
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:20,650
Which is really weird when you wrap your
head around it and you think from 1950

71
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:23,920
to 2013 how different shit is,
but it's something,

72
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,180
you know,
63 years,

73
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,610
August is on my sleeve over.

74
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,960
It doesn't seem like it was just August
two times.

75
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,760
Fine.
So what does this Ender's game?

76
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,350
This is there.
They're making it into a book.

77
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,280
This is an audible book off,
but they're also making it interesting

78
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,820
to me and making it into a movie.
Well,

79
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,870
the beautiful thing about all ball is
for fucking traffic.

80
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,820
And if you're on a plane or something
like that,

81
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:44,230
if you don't want to listen to a
podcast,

82
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:48,430
if you don't want to listen to us,
this is a great way to go and over a

83
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,850
hundred thousand different titles.
And if you go to audible.com um,

84
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,660
you can't,
why is the fucking,

85
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,943
hold on.
Sorry.

86
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,350
I think there's like a new thing we have
to say with audible.

87
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,600
No,
which one is no at Squarespace.

88
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:04,210
Squarespace is a confusing one because
they want the number afterwards.

89
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,930
Went Joe Eight to track the month,
I think audible.com you just go to

90
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,240
audible.com forward slash show you get,
yeah,

91
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:10,840
that's all it is.

92
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,700
And you get one free audio book and 30
free days of service.

93
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,550
It's a sweet deal.
And uh,

94
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,000
as far as like a resource of information
of a,

95
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,720
of cool audio books,
nothing can fuck with audible.

96
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,550
It's an amazing site.
They also support standup comedy.

97
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:30,700
They even had a live thing where they
were doing every week.

98
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:34,270
People would do like a new five minutes
and shit didn't really work out because

99
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:36,580
that's a lot of fucking time to come up
with in five weeks.

100
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,910
People don't like to think that,
but to have like a rock solid five new

101
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:42,970
minutes every week that you're really
proud of that you'd want to put online.

102
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,400
That's hard.
Yeah.

103
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:48,430
So Steve Marmel was doing that.
He was doing that every week.

104
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,710
I remember the uh,
they had a contract with him and a

105
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:52,510
couple other dudes.
You know,

106
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:55,660
Marmel is real topical,
so he was like trying to like just

107
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:59,600
constantly right topical jokes about
Funny Shit that's happening in the news

108
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:00,434
or what have you.

109
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,070
But it was a,
it's fucking burn it off.

110
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,780
That's a lot.
That's a lot of time.

111
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,900
That's too hard to do.
You mean you could do it,

112
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,260
but man,
you gotta be on the ball every day if

113
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:13,390
you want it to really truly represent
you.

114
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,260
So I think they stopped doing that.
But they have earth by a John Stewart

115
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
does.
John Stewart read it.

116
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,830
He's got to read it.
You can't have somebody else read it.

117
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,750
Scroll back up.
Not that one.

118
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,063
Is that,
uh,

119
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,650
God know Penn Jillette's does he read
his own?

120
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,543
Ah,
that's it.

121
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,840
Of course he did.
Yeah,

122
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,610
of course.
Why didn't even ask Sarah Silverman

123
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,280
fucking destroyed on the roast.
Jeez.

124
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,410
She's hilarious.
She's hilarious.

125
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:41,530
And she reads her own shit too.
She's a very funny person.

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,870
She's in my opinion as far as like a
chick standups and I hate to break them

127
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,090
up into checks,
but I'm going to do it anyway.

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,100
You know,
she's like top two,

129
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,570
three all time.
You know,

130
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
women have been like,
I mean,

131
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,620
and I know a lot of people say,
what about Lucille Ball?

132
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
She's more of a comedic actress,
you know?

133
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,460
And as far as Standups,
I think Joan Rivers is the queen,

134
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,470
I think.
I don't think you fuck with Joan Rivers.

135
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,670
She's been funny for like 80 years and
you can't fuck with her.

136
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,280
She's number one women of all time.
Joan Rivers.

137
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,940
And then you got like the Paula
Poundstone is,

138
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,950
and you got like a Zamboni.
Roseanne Barr,

139
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,590
who's a crusher.
I just heard all the time,

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,580
deal with her on a random

141
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,070
fez the other day.
She,

142
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,910
you know what real deal.
She's my,

143
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,770
her and Joan Rivers man.
That's actually kind of close when you

144
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,660
think about that.
She's a beast.

145
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,270
We got to get Rosie.
She's fucking funny man.

146
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,500
She was in the eighties I remember.
She was funny.

147
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,500
Like the best guys in the world were
funny,

148
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,500
you know.
I mean she was a killer.

149
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,380
She didn't give off fuck and then when
they are gave her a TV show she gave

150
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:45,070
less fucks.
She's a

151
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,420
beast.
She was talking about how she like her

152
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:51,920
first show or first comedy show in La.
Like she had only been doing,

153
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:56,000
I think comedy like two years a lot.
Mitzi loved her and that,

154
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:58,820
that same show like our first night in
La.

155
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,530
Yeah.
Then she booked the tonight show in the

156
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:01,000
first night.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,910
That is insane.
Insane.

158
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,420
We got to hit it on the page.

159
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,510
I talked to her like she was thinking
about stopping by or San Diego show in

160
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,300
comic con.
So you chat with

161
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,990
Oh cool.
Cool.

162
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,570
Well she follows me on Twitter.
Like she,

163
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,940
she asked me questions sometimes.
She's all in like new world order type

164
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:21,480
shit.
I'm actually meet with her having her

165
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:23,100
own podcast.
The amazing

166
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:29,190
tape it even if you can't watch it.
I did Rosie O'donnell show just to me.

167
00:07:29,191 --> 00:07:30,630
Rosie.
I really did.

168
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,930
I think she's bad ass.
I like her whether I agree with what she

169
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:37,500
says about things or not.
I think Rosie's got some balls and she

170
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,360
doesn't seem like an asshole to me at
all.

171
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,840
They had that show on VH one with the
badge standup badge that the host quit

172
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,320
and Rosie took over.
That was when she was a strong ass woman

173
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,890
and the girl you like dog.
She ripped some some fucking stages too.

174
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,930
What's a chick on channel five every
day?

175
00:07:54,931 --> 00:07:59,670
The one that seen me at the bus stop,
like the lesbian chick that singing on

176
00:07:59,671 --> 00:08:01,740
the bus stop.
You went on his show the other day.

177
00:08:01,741 --> 00:08:03,240
You were looking for tickets.
Oh,

178
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:05,550
you're talking about that chick Ellen
degenerate.

179
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:10,950
Yeah.
Mother fuckers that rip it up.

180
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,440
Paula Poundstone rip,
but chick from the comedy store,

181
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:15,290
the one that was in with the,
with them,

182
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,580
they smoked a joint with the chick with
the fucking big fits.

183
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,440
But Lily Tomlin,
she used to rip up the phone.

184
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,750
She had like a
one woman show.

185
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:25,741
But I,
I think,

186
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:26,551
you know,
in my opinion,

187
00:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,080
Sarah Silverman,
it's right up there.

188
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,080
I think she's at the top.
Let's go top ones of all time.

189
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:33,960
Rivers with a strong Roseanne kicking
the fuck.

190
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:38,550
I don't know man.
I might five Roseanne might've been

191
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,420
better.
Like has her delivery man.

192
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,250
No,
it's fucking hard.

193
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,110
Very hard because [inaudible] rivers is
still out there swinging.

194
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,050
So in my opinion,
like you got to give her a number one

195
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,300
cause she's still swinging.
You know,

196
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:55,560
she's still there doing

197
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,460
cards.
But when they asked her,

198
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,110
she was on the wrestler,
there's one of the funniest things.

199
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,370
He's pretty gangster.
He asked if she was in the wrestler.

200
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,650
I almost fucking died when I think,
um,

201
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,550
I think it's harder for a woman to do
stand up.

202
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,410
I'm always,
yes,

203
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,100
I think that men are sexist for the most
part.

204
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,830
And they don't want to listen to a woman
talk.

205
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,990
You know?
I think it's harder to get a lot of

206
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,960
men's attention and obviously that's a
big generalization because there's a lot

207
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,260
of Sarah Silverman fans from men are a
lot of women fans of comedy.

208
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:26,240
There are men,
I think.

209
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:29,820
Yeah,
featuring I cheer for women when they're

210
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,560
free trade and I love motherfuckers who
go on stage headlining and think they're

211
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:36,420
going to follow a woman on a Saturday
night.

212
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,140
Your shit better be tight because of
this chicken.

213
00:09:39,141 --> 00:09:42,570
The size to go update goes her way.
Member,

214
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,510
that's half women.
Shit goes her way.

215
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,580
You're going to have a rough time and
I've seen it happen.

216
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,150
I've seen a buried motherfucker ego at
the store.

217
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,110
Don't fuck around with women sometimes.
I've seen sham attached very

218
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,650
motherfuckers in the yellow one.
Yeah,

219
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,280
I've seen her.
Barry motherfuckers in the,

220
00:10:02,281 --> 00:10:04,620
Oh wow.
There's a lot of women who will take

221
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:07,620
that room and flip you.
They don't have titties.

222
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,420
I don't give a fuck.
They looked like they'd been fucked in

223
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:12,870
the ass a thousand times and they go
there with that attitude and you're

224
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,130
sitting there going,
wow,

225
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,110
what was the Puerto Rican chicken at the
store early on that married,

226
00:10:19,111 --> 00:10:20,850
what's his name when you're talking
about,

227
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,500
but she had the kit with,
what's his name and she did a couple of

228
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,400
episodes and YPD blue and she was on her
way.

229
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:29,670
I saw her in that a couple of Tuesday
nights and I was like,

230
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:32,490
damn,
this bitch on the road for a few years

231
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,130
she had a kid,
but at the time she had the kid,

232
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:38,310
she'd sit the kid and the fucking bar at
the comedy store and go do 15 minutes.

233
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,240
I think I told you that like one of the
most promising sets of an open miker I

234
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:44,490
ever saw was Kelly curse.
Carsten.

235
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:47,170
Absolutely
Kelly,

236
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,450
Kirsten,
Kirsten.

237
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:51,900
Especially when she didn't have a
boyfriend and she's a sweetie and she,

238
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,890
you know,
she got a boyfriend,

239
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:55,200
she'd calm down.
But when she didn't have a boyfriend,

240
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:57,750
she was fucking angry.
And she did this bit,

241
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:58,980
man,
she did this bit.

242
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,600
Oh,
I wish I was a man.

243
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,120
You know Kelly's like I'm short.
I'm five,

244
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,730
eight and she's at least five inches
taller than me.

245
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,020
Right.
I mean how tall is she?

246
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,320
She's six one six two six.
It's a very tall girl and,

247
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:15,420
and she get fucking angry and she's like
real physical and like she would do,

248
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,370
she did this bit,
I wish I was a man.

249
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,680
If I was a man,
I'd come and checks and go,

250
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,720
fuck you have my kid.

251
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,360
She goes,
if I was a man,

252
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,560
she goes,
if I had a dick,

253
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:29,490
had Kiszko lazy that traffic and it's
like this really wild bit man.

254
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,800
Listen man,
I was at an open mic or she was an open

255
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,720
Mike or Rather,
I mean she was just starting out and I

256
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:34,830
was like,
wow.

257
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:37,770
I was like,
this chick is fucking strong or you show

258
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:42,270
it that the chicks that winter,
the comedy store either had a sit or get

259
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:44,820
off the fucking pot.
They only had about three or four weeks

260
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,110
to adjust to that style of comedy.
And you would see them go away on their

261
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:52,970
own because it's six guys before you,
and you got to go up there with your

262
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,100
quaint material.
At 10

263
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,400
45 we had about three or four those sets
until he got back to Mitzi.

264
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,130
So now what you had to do is go in there
and go,

265
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:03,400
you know what,
I gotta use my pussy and going and throw

266
00:12:03,401 --> 00:12:05,320
some fucking heat,
grow some steam.

267
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,390
And that's either do or die at the
store.

268
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:10,190
Even Sherri Shepherd,
I remember Sherry Shepherd early.

269
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,490
Oh yeah.
Uh,

270
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,770
what was the cute black girl that had
the white boyfriend manager?

271
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,370
God dammit.
And then you have a man that was all

272
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:22,060
stitched up and plastic surgery it up
and shit that we're holding it together

273
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:25,090
with Krazy glue.
And I remember a comic that used to go

274
00:12:25,091 --> 00:12:28,450
to the laugh factory.
She was asking me about the store,

275
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:29,141
like,
you know,

276
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,270
like when should I go up?
Like when is the crowd?

277
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:33,670
Like the nicest I've like just like
stops.

278
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,090
And this conversation right now,
you don't know what you're talking

279
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:37,420
about.

280
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,080
You're talking about chaos.
audible.com go to audible.

281
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,080
Go buy yourself some cool shit.
There's a lot of books and like I said,

282
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:46,190
Sarah Silverman's book and that's a good
one.

283
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,920
I'll go get that one.
Get it for free.

284
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,390
audible.com forward slash.
Joe,

285
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,900
do you know her manager?
Have you ever met Sarah Silverman?

286
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:55,360
Silverman's manager?
Which ones are manager lady who is

287
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:59,040
amazing and she was so fucking bad ass.
She just like coming up to guys and got

288
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,100
you better not fuck with Tony if you
fuck with Tony who was intense.

289
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
She was amazing.
What was that about?

290
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,290
Uh,
there,

291
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,490
uh,
I think Tony's managed managers were

292
00:13:09,491 --> 00:13:11,800
there and so she just came up and
started like,

293
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,040
just,
she's just screaming at these two guys.

294
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,130
It was so awesome too.
And then I was like,

295
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,510
who?
Who was that girl?

296
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:19,991
I thought,
you know?

297
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:20,681
And he goes,
oh,

298
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:21,100
that sir.

299
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,450
So we're meant to manager.
I was like,

300
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,710
fuck,
that's bad ass.

301
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,760
She's a bad ass.
All right.

302
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:27,690
We're also brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com and we do have a new thing at on

303
00:13:27,691 --> 00:13:30,010
it.
We have an orangutan kettlebell now the

304
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,310
orangutan kettle bell is a,
it's like 50 something pounds.

305
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,220
They did.
They insist on doing them in Pudong One

306
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,280
pooed in two pood.
It's pretty bad ass.

307
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,271
I said,
yeah,

308
00:13:40,271 --> 00:13:43,410
so now we have the orangutan that goes
along with the chimp and the grill or

309
00:13:43,411 --> 00:13:48,411
the rank time being the 1.5 pooed,
which I think is 50 52 pounds or

310
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,960
something like that,
or 50 pounds.

311
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,240
Why are you doing it with a pill?
I don't know why.

312
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,630
I don't know why they did that.
Like what is a pooed man?

313
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,170
It's like old piece of paper to show her
legit Bro.

314
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah.
I think we're really fucking up their

315
00:14:01,361 --> 00:14:01,660
Aubrey.

316
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,260
Let's put the God damn weight to these
things and it's like fucking like kilos

317
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:05,801
and shit.
Yeah.

318
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:09,640
Why do we have to have inside fucking
secret shit?

319
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,160
I don't even know what a food is and I
sell these things.

320
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,050
Why don't you do it by ounces?
That would be cooler.

321
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:16,600
I work out with these bitches every day
and I don't know what a fucking pooed

322
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:18,640
is.
What's a pooed goddammit.

323
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,400
But what,
what they are is these primal bells.

324
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:25,540
Go to audible.com or on it doc fucking
krc.com,

325
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,660
a kettle bells audit.com,
forward slash kettlebells,

326
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,240
and you'll see the regular kettlebells,
which we,

327
00:14:31,241 --> 00:14:32,074
uh,
we sell.

328
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,730
But the new ones are the primal bells.
And if you go to [inaudible] dot com

329
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:39,820
forward slash primal dash bells,
you'll see these.

330
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,043
And,
um,

331
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,870
that's the,
uh,

332
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,870
running a tank.
They're not as threatening looking.

333
00:14:43,871 --> 00:14:45,610
They have like a big mushy phase.
Yeah.

334
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:46,031
The,
yeah.

335
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:46,900
It's cool.

336
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,890
It's cool.
None of the fact that I'm blade Erik

337
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,723
Griffin.
What's the name ever?

338
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,970
It's really amazing artwork too.
If you see it in with the black

339
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:57,890
contrast,
so you can see how really how good the

340
00:14:57,891 --> 00:14:58,671
artwork is.
It's,

341
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,990
it's incredible.
I mean,

342
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:00,650
these,
uh,

343
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,120
these are some of the,
as far as like idea to,

344
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,760
uh,
to actual product when we came up with

345
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:11,030
this ideal and then like seeing them now
that did differences.

346
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,260
It's perfect.
The fucking gorillas.

347
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,830
Amazing man.
I can't help but look at that thing.

348
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,120
It's,
look at that Joey.

349
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,730
Look at that gorilla.
That shit's incredible.

350
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,330
Look at that thing.
Look at the fucking artwork on that.

351
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,530
It's looks like,
what the fuck?

352
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,400
It's so bad ass.
And they're really well balanced as well

353
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:30,740
as one of the most important things
about doing this.

354
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,320
A primal bell.
Things that we wanted to make sure that

355
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,360
if we had these gigantic kettlebells,
um,

356
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,810
we would,
even though they have this beautiful

357
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:40,700
artwork on them,
we wanted to make sure they're balanced.

358
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:45,100
What's the lightest one?
Way 35 pounds one pooed and that's why

359
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,420
there's one they had was 30 pounds,
35 pounds,

360
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:49,430
a 1.5,
which is whatever.

361
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,370
And uh,
and then there's the gorilla,

362
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,170
which is a two,
which is 70.

363
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,750
You think they are doing the food
because it's like monkey poop.

364
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,291
Yeah.
No,

365
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,210
cause they're being silly.
They're being silly.

366
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,950
They're debris.
And that's what it is.

367
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:04,160
And traditional Prob,
I don't even think about it until today.

368
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,660
It's Kazaam high.
Yeah.

369
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:10,190
It's fuck.
And I see things clearly when I'm really

370
00:16:10,191 --> 00:16:12,140
high.
She thinks clearly it's very important.

371
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,850
Um,
yeah.

372
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,200
So anyway,
go there,

373
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,210
go there and check that shit out.
Have some,

374
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,070
uh,
can you show some hemp force protein?

375
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,520
Get yourself some,
uh,

376
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,210
all kinds of battle ropes and weight
vests and steel.

377
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:25,700
Maces anything you need as far as like
strength and conditioning.

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,950
If you're trying to tell people you
train UFC,

379
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:28,970
you your,
if she did shoot,

380
00:16:28,971 --> 00:16:30,190
they do on all access.

381
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,423
It's me,
bro.

382
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,180
Look a fucking ropes in my yard.
I'm swinging around a maze.

383
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,700
It's like old school.
If we go back to sword fight and

384
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:42,560
unprepared,
we also sell buffalo bars.

385
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:44,690
They're called Tonka bars.
Didn't shit.

386
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,610
Says Delicious.
They're made the way the,

387
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:47,410
uh,
the,

388
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,830
uh,
native Americans used to make them as

389
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:53,831
well with these cranberries and buffalo
meat buffaloes.

390
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:57,260
Super good for you and delicious.
And Buffalo was a big,

391
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,850
so if you shoot him,
you're likely to hit him.

392
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:03,900
It's easier to farm them that way.
Joey Diaz bothering me

393
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,860
anyway on a.com.
Using code name rogue,

you'll save 10% off any and all
supplements on,

395
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,290
I need to say about this.
A orangutang thing.

396
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,600
Um,
we're going to,

397
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,640
uh,
we're donating money for each,

398
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,870
uh,
primal bell.

399
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,530
Uh,
each purchase donates $5 to save the red

400
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:22,790
ape.
Um,

401
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:23,624
so,
uh,

402
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,680
the,
uh,

403
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,870
is that a,
rang a tiny charity organization.

404
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,410
So whatever this organization is called,
that's unfair.

405
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,890
It's unclear here on this email.
I'll just read it what it says and

406
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:34,340
you'll,
uh,

407
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,600
we'll,
we'll figure it out together.

408
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,050
It says we launched the orangutan primal
bell and have linked it to an orangutan

409
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:42,950
charity organization.
Every purchase donates $5 to save the

410
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:44,840
red ape.
I don't if save the red ape is the name

411
00:17:44,841 --> 00:17:48,080
of the organization or there's an
organization that's not named that's

412
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,360
unclear to me and that statement.
So I would just be clear about that.

413
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,660
But the idea is that every,
for every one of these orangutan

414
00:17:54,661 --> 00:17:56,310
kettlebells,
we sell five bucks,

415
00:17:56,311 --> 00:18:00,690
we'll go to a whatever this charity is.
So I guess her main tags are endangered.

416
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,480
They fucking weird looking man.
I mean,

417
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,310
they really do look like something out
of Avatar.

418
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,710
Look at that thing.
But that's a real animal.

419
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:12,900
How weird is that?
God dammit and intelligent looking thing

420
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:17,490
with this fucking crazy face.
Please stop.

421
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,310
Shut that off.
I don't want,

422
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,580
listen,
I don't want to focus on that.

423
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,180
Uh,
anyway.

424
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,030
Uh,
rank tane kettle bells in on it.com.

425
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,380

Constantly on the move.

You're on the move.
And then we'll swing and we're going to

[inaudible] man,

440
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:11,540
you're killing them with triam brother.
You know,

441
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,990
this was the plan 12 years ago and
finally,

442
00:19:13,991 --> 00:19:15,670
you know,
it ain't no listen man.

443
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:17,560
When you get there and you put the work
in,

444
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,990
it becomes easy to,
and you're enjoying it.

445
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,930
Yeah.
You just can't wait to fucking stay.

446
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:24,070
You can't wait to go out and try that
new joke anymore.

447
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,660
That new delivery.
You know,

448
00:19:25,661 --> 00:19:27,970
you're a black belt one comedy.
Yeah.

449
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,770
It's a fun thing to do now.
Yeah,

450
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,950
very fun.
You know?

451
00:19:30,951 --> 00:19:33,340
Uh,
it's funny because I went from the two

452
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:35,590
fucking tremendous shows we did in
Boston,

453
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:39,460
which has your basic listen man.
You don't ever want to bombing Boston.

454
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,543
No.

455
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
That's the end of everything.
And that's Arrow Smith.

456
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,500
That's,
that's Dane Cook.

457
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:46,060
That's a lot of fun.
Lenny Clarke,

458
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,670
there's so much tradition.
I remember the first time I played in

459
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:51,020
dope to me,
I went to the store that like,

460
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:52,780
uh,
all those guys from Boston.

461
00:19:52,781 --> 00:19:54,040
What was the car?
The taekwondo.

462
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,010
Got It all.
So I had sleep apnea or you leave the

463
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,090
triggers.
I don't know.

464
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,660
The comedians from Boston,
he had long hair and he'd play a guy

465
00:20:01,661 --> 00:20:03,220
right there.
Oh God.

466
00:20:03,221 --> 00:20:04,510
Dammit man.
Those guys,

467
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,420
what the fuck is his name?
Oh my God,

468
00:20:07,421 --> 00:20:08,830
he's going to kill me.
I'm sorry.

469
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,690
Dossier.
They will all your buddies.

470
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,610
And they were like,
don't give a play Boston.

471
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,444
I'm like,
Nah,

472
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,570
but like,
we'll get you in this way.

473
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,440
We got me into the comedy connection.
I'm on days.

474
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,400
The open mic with the kid who died,
Kevin Fitzgerald or whatever his name

475
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:23,170
was,
Kevin Fitzgerald and Denver.

476
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,750
Kevin.
He was friends with our friend Maguire.

477
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,780
We've been mutual buddy.
He died of cancer I hope.

478
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,990
And Kevin Knox on Mondays.
They introduced me to him.

479
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:37,320
So I became a part of this thing I would
do and Dover the WHO and I was never

480
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:40,630
good enough to play Boston.
I would get to do the collection on

481
00:20:40,631 --> 00:20:43,180
Monday nights.
And that's like having a fucking

482
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:47,020
striping comedy when you get to play
Boston and they accept you into that.

483
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,630
Yeah.
So I knew before I went to Boston that

484
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,550
we got to,
this money sets is like good to tighten

485
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,880
my shit up.
We didn't go to Boston unprepared.

486
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,030
It was me.
You went to hurry,

487
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,340
you know?
I mean it was just a fucking perfect

488
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:59,380
night.
It was funny how the next day I had to

489
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:02,530
go to a summer jam up in San Jose with
Russell Peters,

490
00:21:02,531 --> 00:21:03,660
who was a pleasure to fuck him.

491
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,470
See and Angela Johnson and all those
guys and I didn't really get across.

492
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:11,170
I wish I was burnt out from the Boston
shows.

493
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,140
Like I put all the energy I had close to
fucking shows the will feet,

494
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,680
which was great.
It was a great thing that I left and

495
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,440
Charleston and one in Fox,
one fucking sports,

496
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,870
the whole thing.
The dude's name was dumb,

497
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,060
wasn't it?
Hit me.

498
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:26,680
What was his last name?
Dammit.

499
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,270
It's trying to be crazy.
Dominic.

500
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,090
He just hit me up and you up about sleep
apnea.

501
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,070
He wanted to go take a test about a year
ago.

502
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,450
I can't believe,
I can't remember his name.

503
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,000
I ran out of room.
Granted,

504
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,250
[inaudible] name's John.
No,

505
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:40,480
it's no disrespect to understand that
the attorney,

506
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,640
that was the,
the,

507
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,930
the Dominic fig.
Dominic fig.

508
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:47,350
What was,
what was the nice gate kid so worried.

509
00:21:47,351 --> 00:21:50,200
I was going to not remember this.
A nice gate kid that went to Chris

510
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,820
Mcguire,
his house that he'd done it and your

511
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:54,730
name came up and there was two gay guys
at the table and they go,

512
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,560
he doesn't like Joe Rogan.
He goes,

513
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:57,394
why not?
He goes,

514
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:02,670
he called Princess Diana [inaudible].

515
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,070
They all went,
oh my God.

516
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,350
It was horrible.
That's hilarious.

517
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,560
Those were great times when those guys
from Boston took me and they would take

518
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,470
me up there.
So then I went to San Jose,

519
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,910
then I went to DC and that was really
the first time I used to do like

520
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:22,960
headliners and Tysons corner for years I
used to fly into Dallas.

521
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,530
This is the first time I was in the city
and it was an experience because I tell

522
00:22:26,531 --> 00:22:28,000
you what,
if I would've gone five years ago,

523
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:29,320
guys that would have bombed this
weekend.

524
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,210
Really?
Why you say that?

525
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,140
Because I learned how to control more.
You know,

526
00:22:35,141 --> 00:22:36,490
you learn and calm.
You know,

527
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:39,190
it's so funny how we put ourselves out
there where you never did.

528
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,650
I didn't have a choice.
They were telling me to ask me the

529
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,360
headline.
I would go up there with stupid fucking

530
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,390
jokes and you would headline and you'd
have the time,

531
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:48,730
but you really,
you weren't really a headliner.

532
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:52,180
And it's true when people start to come
to see you,

533
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:55,480
it makes you work a little harder.
Like every time you see him you want to

534
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:59,300
have new material or new float floaty.
So I had never been there and I,

535
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:02,020
and I sharpened up this week and I went
there and I tell you they were very

536
00:23:02,021 --> 00:23:05,410
politically correct.
The city of DC downtown.

537
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,410
Hey man,
it's a nation's fucking capital.

538
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,550
You know what I'm saying?
I'm talking about weed and it might not

539
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,060
suit,
you know,

540
00:23:13,061 --> 00:23:17,470
you can't do that.
They took the ride and as far as the

541
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,870
club,
the fucking VCM private tests,

542
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,610
the staff,
the fucking,

543
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,490
the Spanish bud tenders.
I mean the whole fucking deal.

544
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:27,070
It's just a great little club.
I had the Burrito one night,

545
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,760
just the whole experience.
The city of Washington DC,

546
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:32,980
I had the best chicken Teriyaki and
white tuna.

547
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:37,300
I've had the last 20 fucking years.
I've done the theaters there before,

548
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,100
um,
like a couple of different times,

549
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:43,090
but I never did the improv before.
Recently I did it with Callan.

550
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,620
Yeah.
I just stopped going back.

551
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,310
Let's go for a week.
Three nights.

552
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,470
Yeah.
I get to what their you want to go back

553
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:48,950
there?
Yeah.

554
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,600
Yeah.
Let's go back and gave play a lot of

555
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,580
good people there.
I went to a lot of places.

556
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:54,170
Yeah.
With death squad usually doesn't go.

557
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,870
I tell you what place really blew my
fucking mind.

558
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:58,580
Who?
They're ready to kill people.

559
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,120
Salt Lake City.
The Mormons are ready dog.

560
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:04,010
They ain't fucking around.
Uh,

561
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,240
Louisville,
Kentucky.

562
00:24:05,241 --> 00:24:06,290
They're ready.
They'll come down.

563
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,670
No,
I went to Lexington,

564
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,400
the Homo University in Kentucky.
Great son.

565
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,340
I had a great time of going to these
places that were odd ball,

566
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:17,150
but I wanted to see what was out there,
who I was listening to the fucking pot

567
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:18,830
people were driving six,
seven hours.

568
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,270
People driving the Louisville place.
Tremendous.

569
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,350
Yeah.
With Trisha Gura.

570
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,030
No Dunkin.
Tremendous.

571
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,410
Maybe I did it with cigarette too.
Yeah.

572
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,260
It's a good way to do it twice.
I think I did one night in a weekend or

573
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,090
something like that.
Going back to Nashville this year.

574
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,080
I can't wait.
Oh,

575
00:24:33,081 --> 00:24:34,550
Nashville.
Nashville.

576
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,430
Is he Utah are really that crazy.
Like it was,

577
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,480
I mean,
like are people crazy out there?

578
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,570
I mean like that people that come in,
I'm thinking that what you mean is like,

579
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,150
are they like crazy Mormon?
Yeah.

580
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,860
Did they already there?
But that's more so,

581
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,960
do you see this map?
It's kind of like what you've talked

582
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:49,621
about.
It's a,

583
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:52,390
of all the porn searches that they just
released,

584
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,410
porn hub did it.
And of course what you used to always

585
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,400
say the south,
uh,

586
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,000
Ebony Ebony,
but uh,

587
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,400
Utah Blank and somebody's,
uh,

588
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,070
people are saying it's because child
porn is the number one search.

589
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:06,900
Well,
you paused and you taught is blank.

590
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:08,880
That's weird.
It's like one of the few states where

591
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,980
there's no downloads porn for,
right.

592
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,720
Wow.
Look at Maine.

593
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,610
Look at,
look at it like Vermont.

594
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,700
Yeah.
Just gave up Asian California.

595
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,770
Uh,
W I don't know why I need a queen is do

596
00:25:19,771 --> 00:25:22,230
you know I didn't need a queen is never
even heard of that.

597
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,340
What is this website that you're going
to Gizmodo and it's based off a

598
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:31,140
statistics given by porn hub.
Cream pie is Florida teen is Texas.

599
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,130
That noise.
You're not hearing that?

600
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,140
Yeah.
Here's some crazy feedback.

601
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:40,730
Uh,
my cream pie was a lot more popular than

602
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:44,180
I imagined,
but a cream pies like number one.

603
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,100
Yeah,
I think cream pies probably number one.

604
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:48,270
And teens probably because people are to
come in.

605
00:25:48,271 --> 00:25:50,890
The people that clean patch?
No.

606
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,730
Like most,
most of them are cream pies.

607
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:55,190
Well that's what people like to think.
Let me look at this.

608
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,260
You need to fuck it.
I don't know what the map looks like.

609
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,690
You know,
I guess I've heard that Al Franken can

610
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:03,380
draw the map like you get get al Franken
up to a chalkboard and he could just

611
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:06,530
draw the map for you.
And I was kind of like sad cause I was

612
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:09,680
like um,
I can't I get it.

613
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,300
Yeah,
I'd have no idea where I'm looking at

614
00:26:11,301 --> 00:26:11,961
these things.
Okay.

615
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,070
Cause it's just cream pie.

616
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:13,730
Cream Pie.
Like,

617
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:17,570
like listing taxes is teen,
which is fucking creepy man.

618
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,350
That shit's creepy.
Ohio's MILF cream pie.

619
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,200
So I not just cream pie.
It's old cream pie.

620
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,453
Yeah.
This,

621
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,580
this is weird man.
It's weird how California is dominated

622
00:26:28,581 --> 00:26:31,860
by Asian.
Look at that number one Asian boom

623
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,070
headed the times and the average visits,
why don't understand that.

624
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,830
Do you get that average number of
visits,

625
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,870
duration,
the duration,

626
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,760
the average for the people in
California.

627
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,720
It was like on the darker end,
but not as dark as fucking like look at

628
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:53,721
Georgia and it's teen ebony has the
longest going to a store and say I want

629
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,780
two kids.
Fucking,

630
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,140
it's like,
no,

631
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,920
no,
they're like 18 or 19 or something like

632
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:04,130
that.
And that's the idea going into it and

633
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,910
get like Asian porn,
like a white dude fuck of a Chinese

634
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,230
chicken.
Oh yeah,

635
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,350
yeah.

636
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:14,310
Cause she'd just say that's impossible.
But it's just like so standard.

637
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,460
There's,
it's weird how there's like standard

638
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,550
like categories of porn,
you know,

639
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:22,530
like DP,
like that's a category.

640
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,600
What's the DP?
Double Penetration.

641
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:27,240
That's like normal little,
we're like ones in the ass,

642
00:27:27,241 --> 00:27:29,250
ones in the vagina.
It's so passe.

643
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,340
It's so passe that it's a,
it's its own category.

644
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:34,070
It's like gosh,
it's not just one,

645
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,430
not just a couple of crazy people got
together and one of the vagina.

646
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,750
Yeah,
double pantries.

647
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,810
Right?
Gay.

648
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,010
Listen,
if you're a chick and you love Dick,

649
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,510
tell me,
that wouldn't be amazing.

650
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,520
The problem is that it's on video and
everyone's gonna know.

651
00:27:50,521 --> 00:27:52,020
But,
but the reality,

652
00:27:52,021 --> 00:27:54,120
if you're a girl,
if you like anal sex,

653
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,950
I don't know if girls like that,
but if you do like it and then you're

654
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,750
like me,
it's,

655
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,030
it varies.
But if you do like it and you lock it in

656
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:03,810
your box as well,
I mean take away society standards and

657
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:07,860
that would be like super awesome if you
had like Ashton Kutcher and your butt

658
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:11,520
and Brad Pitt and your box mean if you
were a gal,

659
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,390
you'd be so happy,

660
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,450
but it would be like,
you know Ashley and get out of there.

661
00:28:16,451 --> 00:28:18,670
You're gobbling it all.
That saved me.

662
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:21,790
So why would you want,
that's not what we didn't you write out

663
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,700
Brad Pitt in there?
Why are you sharing it with Ashton?

664
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,790
Well,
because you're a freak and you want it

665
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:29,310
all.
She has no limitations to a freak.

666
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,810
I have no idea what this is.
I need a porn is like when it,

667
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,070
when I can buy Google like that.
Once a state was a

668
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:38,920
Nevada,
it's just a need.

669
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,370
A queen is what the car kind of porn is
called.

670
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,970
I can't figure out what it is.
Need a queen.

671
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,320
What?
Did you understand?

672
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:45,600
A word of what you're saying.
All right,

673
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:47,560
so,
so like a c here,

674
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,513
this,
uh,

675
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,650
Asian is California and need a queen.
Is that,

676
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,520
oh,
that's the style of style porn.

677
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,420
Yeah.
And when I look it up,

678
00:28:55,421 --> 00:28:58,630
it looks like it's like pageant porn or
something.

679
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:01,470
Oh,
that actually is interesting.

680
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,850
If that was a category of like you've
won the pageant and soccer.

681
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:07,170
Did you dirty bitch?
Like,

682
00:29:07,171 --> 00:29:08,730
yeah.
You've got the queen.

683
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,670
You took down the number one gal.
No,

684
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,020
that's a weird thing,
isn't it?

685
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,140
That's weird.
What Todd to categories are weird,

686
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:18,690
like fit.
Some dude's like only jerk off to anal.

687
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,580
It just like they can't wait.
She's more but born.

688
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,433
You put,
well,

689
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,810
you,
it's bows to woo.

690
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,210
You know,
like what the fuck man.

691
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,400
It's,
it's weird how that's actually a,

692
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,200
your category.
Yeah.

693
00:29:31,201 --> 00:29:34,620
I find myself going into a weird
categories a lot lately just to mix it

694
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:35,790
up.
Kind of like when you drink the same

695
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,900
alcohol for so long,
you're like,

696
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,390
I'm gonna try something different.
I've been like black chicks getting

697
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:42,130
fucked by big white.
Is there a lot

698
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:42,731
of that?
Yeah,

699
00:29:42,731 --> 00:29:45,520
there's tons of that.
So black chase getting dominated by

700
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:46,930
white guys with big decks.
Yeah,

701
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,090
huge days.
So it's like some like he like this

702
00:29:49,091 --> 00:29:50,310
black guy.
Yeah.

703
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:56,060
You face body and my giant white picker.
And then have half of them sprint to the

704
00:29:56,891 --> 00:29:58,600
girl.
How about that?

705
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,280
The first guy who gets there,
it gets to Fucker,

706
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,440
it'd be a bunch of white guys jacking
off.

707
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,330
Come on,
come on.

708
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,390
Come on.
Black.

709
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,330
Did you hear this?
The sex industry closed down because of

710
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:11,480
AIDS again.
Yeah.

711
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,090
Again,
here and the chick that,

712
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:14,560
that,
that Boehner Guy,

713
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,680
uh,
that chicken out.

714
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,320
We did a porn with wiener.
We,

715
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:19,390
Anthony Wiener politicians.
Yeah.

716
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,590
She uh,
actually,

717
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:23,620
uh,
did a movie with a guy that I read that

718
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,050
she did well,
the guy was exposed to HIV.

719
00:30:26,051 --> 00:30:29,260
He had sex with the girl who had
contacted HIV.

720
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,310
He had sex with her.

721
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:35,310
But allegedly from what I've read,
it's not that easy to transmit from HIV,

722
00:30:36,881 --> 00:30:41,380
from a woman to a man that it's much
easier for a man to a woman because of

723
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,680
the man and checks fluids into the body.
So I don't know if that's true though.

724
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,510
Obviously I'm not a doctor,
but like a Tommy Morrison is a,

725
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,070
supposedly it really sick with AIDS now.
Like he has full blown aids and they did

726
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:57,520
a story about it recently.
Somebody posted it on the underground

727
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,100
and it was really fucking sad.
I mean he's dying.

728
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,320
He's on like life support system
essentially.

729
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,540
He has full blown aids,
you know,

730
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:08,140
and he,
they say he got it from a girl,

731
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:10,060
you know,
I mean I,

732
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,100
it might be possible.
I do not know.

733
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,490
You know,
I've heard like obviously that's what

734
00:31:15,491 --> 00:31:17,680
you always hear.
It's not possible for a guy to get it

735
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:18,070
from a girl.

736
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,920
You always hear that.
But I don't know if that's anything

737
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:21,880
else.
I'll let you put it.

738
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,670
It got it from a needle.
He could've got it from an email.

739
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,350
That's the obvious fucking choice.
Well,

740
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:29,620
we were talking about that a,
yesterday we thought Dwayne Twain

741
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,410
Ludwig,
we were talking about fighters and pills

742
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:36,760
and a pain relief and you know,
fucking would leave relieves pain better

743
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:37,481
than heroin.
I mean,

744
00:31:37,481 --> 00:31:38,314
he's right.
Anything,

745
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,390
right?
So for a lot of fighters they might've

746
00:31:40,391 --> 00:31:42,340
started shooting up because the,
the heroin,

747
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,730
like relieving the pain for them was a,
was so effective.

748
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,990
Look,
I don't want to do it that way.

749
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,050
Those opiates,
that's what it's,

750
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,310
that's what it's about.
Getting Houston needles in general.

751
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,630
Well,
you know what,

752
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:55,810
if you're a fighter and you know you're
used to getting punched in the face,

753
00:31:55,850 --> 00:32:00,460
get your face stitched up and just,
that's like needles not gonna Freak you

754
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:04,780
out when stitches put your nose back
together in the second round and you're

755
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:08,050
going back out there to fight of other
two fucking rounds at three fucking

756
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:08,410
round.

757
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:11,440
Yeah.
You just fucking five rounds with Ray

758
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,050
Mercer and Kod into the ropes like he
did.

759
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:16,480
Did you ever see that with Tommy
Morrison?

760
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:19,270
Getting knocked out by Ray Marshall is
one of the most frightening knockouts

761
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:21,730
I've ever seen in my life because,
well,

762
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:24,220
first of all it's frightening because
Ray Marshall was a murderous puncher,

763
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:29,020
but it was hilarious for me because I
had this friend that would always root

764
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:31,930
for white guys.
It was fucking,

765
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,260
oh he would,
he wanted white guys to win boxing

766
00:32:35,261 --> 00:32:37,840
ranches so bad.
He never wanted it to be the best

767
00:32:37,841 --> 00:32:39,830
fighter.
He always wanted it to be white fighter.

768
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:45,250
So like he rooted for Cherry Cooney and
so he got hit here and Raymar so just

769
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,030
unloads on him.
Yeah,

770
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,570
and it's,
it's who gets caught in the ropes

771
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:51,410
though.
Look at this.

772
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,280
Like he's caught in the robes and ray
Mars is teeing off them.

773
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,850
That's terrible qualities is a better
quality version that we could see it

774
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:00,560
smooth because it was real so choppy.
But anyway,

775
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,820
the,
it was a frightening,

776
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:04,010
frightening knock out.
But once you've done that,

777
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,200
you could shoot heroin.
That's 235 PA listen pro that that once

778
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:13,730
you have that pain and that pain doesn't
fucking go away and that little needle

779
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,700
knocks it away.
Listen to all those people stories.

780
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:20,930
That's how it started and that was
started launching the rookies behind you

781
00:33:20,931 --> 00:33:24,800
to take your fucking job in football.
You just bought you a fucking girl,

782
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:26,740
a house and a boat.
Yeah,

783
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:30,680
and you bought your parents a boat and
now you're 28 and a 22 year old.

784
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,350
All American is coming in in front of
you and you got a bit,

785
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:36,800
a little bit of knee pain and if you
complain about it then you have surgery

786
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,320
and you out and then this motherfucker
steals your job.

787
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,420
Are you going to do,
you ain't got time.

788
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,610
You're doing what you need to do.
Shoot to cortisone,

789
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:47,450
shoot the fucking shoot the Mecca shoot
at all.

790
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:50,330
I don't give a fuck as long as I play.
At the end of the season we'll talk

791
00:33:50,331 --> 00:33:51,710
about surgery and guts.
What dog?

792
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,860
At the end of the surgery,
they meet a fucking guru who says,

793
00:33:54,861 --> 00:33:57,980
you don't need surgery.
We're going to shoot this thing again

794
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,640
and that's it.
Ray Mercer was a fucking murderous

795
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:05,120
puncher back then.
Watching that right there.

796
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,740
Right there,
dude.

797
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:07,940
All of them.
Yeah,

798
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:10,190
the one the left,
it stiffened them and the right to put

799
00:34:10,191 --> 00:34:11,960
them down and then he hit him two more
times.

800
00:34:11,961 --> 00:34:14,740
Full clip after that.
Watch that one more time just to

801
00:34:14,741 --> 00:34:17,240
finishing blows.
Cause I'm sear is one of the most

802
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:19,310
devastating knockouts I've ever seen.
Man.

803
00:34:19,311 --> 00:34:21,320
If you saw this on TV,
when was this?

804
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,200
Seventies late seventies early eighties
eighties yeah.

805
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,490
Here's that right hand and brain.
Mercer was a fucking killer and he could

806
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,470
take it to man.
Ray could take it like these shots,

807
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:31,590
right?

808
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,210
Bang,
Bang,

809
00:34:33,211 --> 00:34:34,350
boom,
Bam,

810
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,760
Bam,
Bam,

811
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,690
Bam,
Bam,

812
00:34:36,691 --> 00:34:37,524
Bam,
Bam,

813
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,730
Bam,
Bam,

814
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:41,100
Bam.
And two more before he goes down.

815
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:43,140
Look how many times he fucking hates
him.

816
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,430
Those bunches though,
isn't it?

817
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,670
Well she not even joking though.
It might have,

818
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,470
that was it.
He just got A's.

819
00:34:52,471 --> 00:34:56,460
I mean you didn't get braid them free
thing,

820
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,480
but who knows how he got it.
But it ate Sushi that afternoon and that

821
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,313
night

822
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,170
could not,
it's

823
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,240
not good for your health.
No,

824
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,000
that fucked him up.
That was it.

825
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,370
They did the movie with Stallone when he
was done,

826
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:11,020
but yeah.
You know,

827
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,470
there's some sort of a,
uh,

828
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,510
he did.
The movie was just alone after that,

829
00:35:14,511 --> 00:35:15,820
didn't they?
Before?

830
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,580
After that?
I think it was before that check.

831
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,463
Before that.
Right.

832
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:21,590
I just sent them over to fucking time.
I was like,

833
00:35:21,591 --> 00:35:24,620
give it a Puerto Rican and check on the
fifth handle.

834
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,760
What's that?
Too early,

835
00:35:25,761 --> 00:35:26,150
right?
Yes.

836
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,710
Yeah.
No.

837
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:28,580
Yeah.
They sent him over the top though.

838
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:33,500
Could you imagine being a fucking guy
who gets to play Tommy Gun back in the

839
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,580
day he brought,
I mean,

840
00:35:34,581 --> 00:35:36,970
how do you,
how does anybody want to fill out both?

841
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,530
You're a young black guy that rocky took
in with a fucker.

842
00:35:40,531 --> 00:35:42,810
He was,
it was a horrible fucking,

843
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:45,120
what was the guy that,
what was the black guy in that movie?

844
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,760
Who's the big black guy that did all
those movies that did it?

845
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,640
Who was a Tyson's manager that robbed
them?

846
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:52,530
Don King.
Don King.

847
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:56,160
Remember the Don King Him in that movie.
He was the worst.

848
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,120
Come on Tom.
Tommy,

849
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,680
come with me and the limo.
We got white women.

850
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,200
Tommy just got punched in the head with
Ray Mercer.

851
00:36:04,201 --> 00:36:06,180
What are you going to do?
You're going to stand there next to

852
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,350
Sylvester.
Fuck no,

853
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,720
no.
I think he was doing blow in the limo.

854
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,770
Get that scene up.
Get that scene up and he's doing blow in

855
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,880
the limos.
She's got those little white milky

856
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,770
Teddy's.
He's going to fucking bananas.

857
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,040
Rocky's like,
what about when they taught you?

858
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,510
Fuck you bitches.
Bang.

859
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,820
It must be incredibly hard to keep your
motivation to be a fighter when that

860
00:36:26,821 --> 00:36:29,520
happens.
It's a fighter that's like the opposite

861
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:33,270
world of being a fighter.
Like you're in a gigantic blockbuster.

862
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:38,040
You have rocky movie back when it means
something to be in a rocky movie.

863
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,650
If you didn't like rocky,
not rocky today.

864
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,030
Did you see Rocky Bob?
Hey man,

865
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,920
if you're in the rocky movies,
just not bad.

866
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:51,840
Sit Right.
The final scene,

867
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:55,720
it's rocky and the white chick.
Oh,

868
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,730
this is grades in Spanish.
Tammy Morrison him square up and is the

869
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:09,351
Shitty don king.
Biggest smallest headers.

870
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,850
Oh,
rocky punched him a bunch of times to

871
00:37:20,851 --> 00:37:22,890
the back of the head.
Wow.

872
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,900
And knocked him down.
Tommy's really upset.

873
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,400
Oh Wow.
He's through them.

874
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,480
And rocky hit him on the way in.
Incredible fight here.

875
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,910
Wow.
Rocky took his legs out.

876
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:37,220
He's going to MMA no ground and
Oh,

877
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,020
now Tommy's coming back.
Boy,

878
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:41,670
that looks fake.
Holy Shit.

879
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:43,470
That looks fake.
They looked so fake.

880
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:47,400
It should be illegal.
They gave him 20 million.

881
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,370
That's how fucking face.
Oh Man.

882
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,820
The next fifth go rub it.
Oh,

883
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:53,430
he probably made at least 20 million.
If you're in this moment is a huge

884
00:37:53,431 --> 00:37:54,264
movie,
man.

885
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,000
Look this and use the finish high one
giant left Hook and Don King,

886
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,040
Don King
hit me out.

887
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:02,874
Sue You.

888
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,390
So that's a digital signal that we're
allowed to use the Spanish version for.

889
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,370
Yeah,
we can get away with that.

890
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,630
Yeah.
You just got to get the brain.

891
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,680
Sorry.
I found the map of the U S and I didn't

892
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:30,550
know where a lot of shit was.
I didn't know where La Shit was in,

893
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,480
in the,
uh,

894
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,050
in the weird areas like the Maine and
New Hampshire areas.

895
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,630
A whole Joe Rogan looking at me.
Don't look at me.

896
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:38,141
Quit.
Quit.

897
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:41,110
What's the six states in New England,
New Hampshire,

898
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,610
Connecticut,
Rhode Island.

899
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,770
Vermont,
Massachusetts.

900
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,793
That's it.

901
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,990
What island?
What island?

902
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,530
Connecticut.
Molly from Maine that may put Maine.

903
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,970
I forgot Maine.
I Dunno.

904
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,140
Is Maine New England?
It must be.

905
00:39:00,141 --> 00:39:01,700
Yeah.
It means means got to be New England.

906
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,930
Yeah,
I forgot that.

907
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,380
And New Hampshire's New England to know.
Yes sir.

908
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,710
Well,
it doesn't hurt states,

909
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,950
cities.
How dare you go.

910
00:39:09,951 --> 00:39:11,150
Hampshire is,
but you don't know.

911
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:14,540
You really are a baby lamb sheets where
you don't live close to boast.

912
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,600
If you don't live in most of the Boston,
you flying through New Hampshire.

913
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,190
Yeah.
In the fucking flights.

914
00:39:19,191 --> 00:39:22,280
I dirt cheap.
It's like two different fucking world's

915
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:25,760
to fly into New Hampshire at the flying
into Boston at 45 minutes.

916
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:26,990
Like Burbank,
lax,

917
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:30,560
New Hampshire's filled with a lot of
fucking people that don't want to hear

918
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:33,500
the government's bullshit.
They're all like those live free or die

919
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:34,360
folks.
They,

920
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,680
you know,
they have compounds set up that's on

921
00:39:36,681 --> 00:39:38,240
their license plate live free or die.

922
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,440
That's a gangster state.
You know they're like up there to where

923
00:39:42,441 --> 00:39:46,070
you got to like shoot Moose to stay
alive when you're north of Boston.

924
00:39:46,071 --> 00:39:47,690
You're a silly bitch.
Okay,

925
00:39:47,691 --> 00:39:48,560
what I,
that's what,

926
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:51,770
that's not cold enough for you.
You need to go further because when we

927
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:53,390
would do gigs in Maine I'd be like,
oh my God,

928
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,990
it's colder.
We'd be in Boston and we'd go to Maine

929
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:58,070
to do a Gig.
December,

930
00:39:58,071 --> 00:39:59,770
it'll be 10 degrees called you get out
of the car yard.

931
00:39:59,771 --> 00:40:02,120
You can't believe these motherfuckers
live where it's colder than where we

932
00:40:02,121 --> 00:40:03,800
live.
You have a bit of somewhere where you

933
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:06,260
look up and he'd go,
how the fuck do people live here?

934
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,560
And you make like a mental note.
Like this is the coldest I've ever been.

935
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:15,010
January 5th,
1990 fucking five they took me up from

936
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,440
Denver,
Colorado was living in boulder to do a

937
00:40:18,441 --> 00:40:22,280
Gig in Cheyenne,
Wyoming,

938
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:27,281
Joe Rogan Shit and had it be 35 fucking
below with the windshield.

939
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,820
I left the hotel and I asked the guy at
the fucking thing,

940
00:40:31,821 --> 00:40:34,370
where do you get something to eat?
And he looked at me and he goes,

941
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,490
maybe 50 yards down,
but I wouldn't leave if I was you.

942
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,860
I looked at him like,
bitch.

943
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,050
And I went out there and started walking
and like 25 minutes in,

944
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,840
I was like,
it's too cold to walk there.

945
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,530
And if I get to it,
it's going to definitely be cold to come

946
00:40:51,531 --> 00:40:52,970
back.
Wow.

947
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,390
Like that's how I walk.
And I had chili and I mean it was

948
00:40:56,391 --> 00:40:58,410
horrendous.
Had to take your jacket off and that I

949
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:02,180
sit next to the heater and that's,
that was something that,

950
00:41:02,181 --> 00:41:05,420
uh,
we forget about that we don't have to

951
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,670
deal with that shit here.
$350.

952
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:10,520
I got for that gate as a feature act for
four shows.

953
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,470
That's a good gig in those days.

954
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,750
Yes.
That's a good gig.

955
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:15,200
It was.
I remember the,

956
00:41:15,201 --> 00:41:16,860
uh,
I just got an email from John Schuler.

957
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:19,520
I gotta I gotta email them back.
I just remembered,

958
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,860
but I should do a lot of Schuler gigs,
you know,

959
00:41:21,861 --> 00:41:23,240
and they varied.
You know,

960
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,650
like if,
if you've got a good one,

961
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:26,240
it was a couple hundred bucks,
maybe more,

962
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,400
you know,
depending on what kind of bar you set

963
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:29,840
up.
Those were great kids,

964
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:32,030
you know,
who'd like to have and some of them,

965
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,730
some of them were really,
they had a lot of them.

966
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:37,970
Schuller had a lot of them in
Connecticut that were great fucking

967
00:41:37,971 --> 00:41:39,980
gigs.
Brown,

968
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,440
what is it called?
Brown Thompson.

969
00:41:41,441 --> 00:41:44,090
Is that what it is?
Goddammit place in Hartford.

970
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,910
He used to have,
that was like our really good comedy

971
00:41:46,911 --> 00:41:47,870
club.
It was,

972
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,490
he,
it was the only place in Hartford

973
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:51,890
because at the time I think there's an
Improv in Hartford,

974
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:52,340
Connecticut.

975
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,530
Now finally bunk.
A funny,

976
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,560
but yeah,
there wasn't any back in the day.

977
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:00,430
I want to say it was called Brown
Thompson.

978
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,170
It was like a bar.
And uh,

979
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,070
they used to,
they used to book the comedy there and

980
00:42:04,071 --> 00:42:06,410
it was like a fucking comedy club.
It was like a real club.

981
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,200
It was a great gig.
Like people get excited about that Gig.

982
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,470
It was a good one.
She had them all over the place.

983
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:15,730
Two places where I thought I could
possibly get killed doing comment.

984
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,700
Craig Colorado is heavy fucking duty
Colorado.

985
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,680
That was the first time ever.
I got it.

986
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,580
I then them,
uh,

987
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,930
what do you call that shit when you get
the paperwork on the Gig and it said,

988
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,390
it said room is known to be active.
If anything happens,

989
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:34,580
run to your room and contact the bar
manager.

990
00:42:34,581 --> 00:42:36,620
Like that's what it said of the triple
aim.

991
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,910
And the other crazy Gig I did was a
place call these civilizations.

992
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:44,510
These cities had been taken over by the
cities and they didn't give a fuck.

993
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:46,640
It was called Rock Springs,
Wyoming,

994
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,470
rock springs,
Wyoming.

995
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:51,200
They had done a thing on 60 minutes
about rock springs,

996
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,450
how the mob had taken over rock springs,
Wyoming.

997
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,680
And that's where they took wounded
hookers from Las Vegas and revamping the

998
00:42:57,681 --> 00:42:59,750
fish.
They're pussies made a hook,

999
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,760
small time.
And that the Strip club day,

1000
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,420
it was like AAA.
I'm not kidding you,

1001
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:04,880
this dog.
This was a look it up.

1002
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,080
Rock Springs,
Wyoming,

1003
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:09,050
60 minutes.
The feds had a goal in and take it back

1004
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:12,530
from the local fucking government.
This is craziness.

1005
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,450
This shit,
they have gambling stuff and uh,

1006
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:15,981
Mike,
well,

1007
00:43:15,981 --> 00:43:18,220
what's his name?
Like two of the guys from 60 minutes on

1008
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,580
up there and did a report about it.

1009
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:24,020
There's some crazy fucking places out
there that you'll never know about

1010
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,520
unless you drive through.
I just got an email from a fucking great

1011
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:32,570
guy that said he has a room in billings.
Meiomi a Montana,

1012
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,840
a 400 seat little theater,
and he sent me an email.

1013
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:41,000
I'm thinking about going up there
obviously like I'm fucking may because

1014
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,010
that's the only month it's fucking warm
up there.

1015
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,920
There's a website called rock spring
hookers.

1016
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:46,670
Oh No,
no,

1017
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:47,151
they don't.
Fuck,

1018
00:43:47,151 --> 00:43:49,910
but that's not rock splinters.
Meiomi hookers.net.

1019
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:51,110
There you go.
There you go.

1020
00:43:51,111 --> 00:43:52,550
Dog Dental.
Fuck around there.

1021
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,760
It's to a different level.
That's what wounded hookers goal.

1022
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,860
They get rehabbed.
The fixed the monkey.

1023
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,120
How did they get rid of the committee
and the HIV rate?

1024
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,080
Mercy takes care of him.
Punched him,

1025
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:04,730
pull it up.
Don't pull it out.

1026
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:06,240
Fine.
Don't put it up here.

1027
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:08,360
No,
you can't do that.

1028
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:11,070
What's that?
The website is a bad shit.

1029
00:44:11,071 --> 00:44:12,610
And I mentioned the name of it anyway.
Oh yeah,

1030
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,520
yeah.
Who gives a fuck boy black fault.

1031
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:15,201
No,
no.

1032
00:44:15,201 --> 00:44:17,600
It's almost disgusting.
Yes and no.

1033
00:44:17,601 --> 00:44:19,100
And I don't want you to pull it.
The breweries is thinking,

1034
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:21,770
I don't think we should rack Mac.
I mean it's an illegal business.

1035
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,380
They're gonna get in trouble.
I don't want him to get in trouble

1036
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,630
said,
but look at the interview.

1037
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,920
But how do you find them?
Look at the intercom for

1038
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,110
60 minutes.
60 minutes.

1039
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,930
60 minutes,
60 minutes.

1040
00:44:36,931 --> 00:44:38,070
Rock Springs,
Wyoming,

1041
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,400
1992 93 fucking I if it's the same damn
fig.

1042
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,630
But you know we were talking about dom
fig,

1043
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:47,010
the vampire comic.
Look at this.

1044
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,300
There's a guy named dom fig that took
this fucking picture of a wave hitting

1045
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:55,440
the buildings in Connecticut.
Holy Shit Man.

1046
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,470
Look at this.
This was when sandy hit Brian.

1047
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,680
See that show shit.
Pull that picture up.

1048
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,390
It's a food photographer.
Austrac after catching a wave.

1049
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:12,170
This is an incredible picture.
It's incredible because like the idea

1050
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:14,730
that he was there while this actually
happened,

1051
00:45:14,731 --> 00:45:18,280
like you shouldn't be anywhere fucking
near there and this crazy assholes,

1052
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,550
not just there.
He's taking pictures.

1053
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,330
Photographer awestruck after catching a
wave is the title.

1054
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:28,680
Yeah,
this is nuts,

1055
00:45:28,681 --> 00:45:31,020
man.
Did you find it?

1056
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:35,340
Okay,

1057
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:42,360
or just look up dom fig comic and then
click on the third link in the see

1058
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,440

Dominic fig comic Dominic fig comic and

1059
00:45:47,441 --> 00:45:52,441
then look under the third picture
Dominic fig comic and look under the

1060
00:45:54,101 --> 00:45:56,890
third link.
Rather it'll say Connecticut post.

1061
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,713
Okay,
here we go.

1062
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:00,070
Look at this fucking picture,
man.

1063
00:46:00,071 --> 00:46:00,940
This is insane.

1064
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:04,470
I mean it's insane.

1065
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,210
It's like what?
What were they thinking?

1066
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:08,740
Building houses there.
First of all,

1067
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,070
that's like beautiful for most of the
time,

1068
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:16,420
but fuck man,
if there's a possibility,

1069
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,270
but it didn't matter if you were right
in front of the water with this

1070
00:46:19,271 --> 00:46:20,051
motherfucker,
right?

1071
00:46:20,051 --> 00:46:25,051
Like they went like several blocks in
just destroying everything in its path.

1072
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:29,620
It's like we're so crazy to think that
the oceans are going to stay where it

1073
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:32,650
is.
What did nutty idea to like build

1074
00:46:32,651 --> 00:46:35,320
expensive shit right next to the edge.
Like tennis.

1075
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,060
The edge is right here.
This is my spot.

1076
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,850
Fucking,
I've got marked it off.

1077
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,170
This is my house I got,
I'm up on stilts and only put the house

1078
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:48,370
right right at the water.
And like the gamble is like,

1079
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:52,140
how long is the water going to be there?
Is it going to stay there for a hundred

1080
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,770
years?
Going to stay for 50 years?

1081
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,330
What's the gamble?
You know?

1082
00:46:55,331 --> 00:46:58,120
And everybody's willing to take that
gamble because if you can open up your

1083
00:46:58,121 --> 00:47:00,670
window and you're there on the ocean,
like it's boat,

1084
00:47:00,671 --> 00:47:03,730
that's fucking amazing.
You know?

1085
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:08,580
So they take that gamble parked that
bitch right next to the rocks and the

1086
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:10,040
hope that nothing melts.
Yeah,

1087
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,620
but you'd have a bigger gamble having a
house on a mountain like,

1088
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:14,950
like with the fires that you had.
That's true.

1089
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:16,870
Well,
eight fires are everywhere in

1090
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:17,760
California.
I mean,

1091
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:22,660
I talked to a firefighter that said
there's a real worry and not of if,

1092
00:47:22,661 --> 00:47:26,680
but when the one day one of these
motherfucker wildfires that they get is

1093
00:47:26,681 --> 00:47:30,010
going to catch La and the wind's going
be just right and he

1094
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,350
said it's gonna burn right to the beach.
I go,

1095
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,940
you think it will burn down Hollywood?
He goes,

1096
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:35,800
I don't think we can stop it.
He goes,

1097
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:40,820
if you're dealing with the kind of fire
that can go that far and is is that

1098
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:46,720
strong and it's wind aided and it's just
big enough cause fires can be really,

1099
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:48,550
really,
really fucking big.

1100
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:51,430
You know it's hard to wrap your head
around how big they can be,

1101
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,130
but they can be so big that you can't
fucking control them.

1102
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,860
All you do is try to contain them,
but you can't control them.

1103
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,330
And if they get that big and they can't
cut it off in time and it starts going

1104
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:04,360
towards La,
if it's the right time of year,

1105
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:06,640
the right amount of Santa Ana winds
kicking in.

1106
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:08,260
Shit man,

1107
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,700
look what happened last year in New
Jersey.

1108
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:11,700
I think it happened.

1109
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,490
Could good happening right now in
Montana.

1110
00:48:13,491 --> 00:48:17,140
Like there's the pdf in Phoenix or in
Arizona rather

1111
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,180
with Gusto.
And somebody told me they were driving

1112
00:48:19,181 --> 00:48:24,181
back from Vegas on Sunday and it was
fucking scary as shit all over the world

1113
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,560
took a mate and a half hours to get home
with a man to when the shit and listen,

1114
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,750
that's gonna.
Everything's getting more extreme.

1115
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,150
Everything's getting more fucking
extreme brother.

1116
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:37,240
The heat's getting more extreme.
Cold is getting more extreme.

1117
00:48:37,241 --> 00:48:39,100
And you know,
I'm not fucking Hell Gore.

1118
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,390
I'm not gonna sit here and tell you
you're not shit.

1119
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,710
No,
I thought it was over.

1120
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,690
You didn't know.
You know,

1121
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,190
I don't know what the fuck's going on,
but we evolve.

1122
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,410
So that means the weather has to fucking
evolve.

1123
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:53,440
And you know,
20 years ago I remember being in Jersey,

1124
00:48:53,441 --> 00:48:55,340
hanging out,
playing wiffle ball and what did it,

1125
00:48:55,341 --> 00:48:58,830
three minutes it would get dark dog and
all of a sudden have these chunks of

1126
00:48:58,831 --> 00:49:00,100
fucking hail would come out.

1127
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:01,540
You know,
but look at now.

1128
00:49:01,541 --> 00:49:05,500
Now I went to the shore 80 times,
80 fucking thousands of times and went

1129
00:49:05,501 --> 00:49:08,560
to that Jersey shore asked me,
but I think that it would dissipate.

1130
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:10,690
Like the way sandy came up and you know
what?

1131
00:49:10,691 --> 00:49:11,740
In three years,
guess what?

1132
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:13,240
There's going to be another one,
Jack.

1133
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:16,270
You know those people we see every year.
I have a tornado.

1134
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,730
I ain't leaving.
People make a thousand jokes about

1135
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,330
that's going to be South Jersey and
fucking three years it'd be three.

1136
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,130
It's going to be every seven or eight
years.

1137
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,910
Then it's going to go down and fucking
every four years and then 50 years from

1138
00:49:27,911 --> 00:49:31,090
now it'll be every fucking it.
You know that just the way it is.

1139
00:49:31,091 --> 00:49:33,610
We evolved,
man though everything moves.

1140
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,520
Don't they find those dinosaur bones and
Montana.

1141
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:39,460
Then you write that and then they belong
to facial,

1142
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,140
sea bass or whatever the fuck it was.

1143
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:42,770
Well,
there was a Greg and western and see

1144
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,850
there.
They used to be a fucking interior

1145
00:49:45,851 --> 00:49:47,830
ocean.
The thing that's always stuck me about

1146
00:49:47,831 --> 00:49:51,340
boulder was the devil's thumb.
When you're on baseline and you're

1147
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,790
driving close to university in the South
Boulder and you look to your right and

1148
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:57,220
there's a thing that pops out of the
fucking mountain.

1149
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,400
This,
this,

1150
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,670
this,
just this figure.

1151
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,910
I had to look it up.
Boulder,

1152
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:03,520
Colorado at Devil's thumb and it pops
up.

1153
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,220
It makes you fucking think.
It makes you fun.

1154
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,510
You know,
it's the weirdest thing.

1155
00:50:07,511 --> 00:50:10,350
I hiked up there one time was my dog.
Uh,

1156
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:11,260
Hercule.
Yeah.

1157
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:14,350
Hercules went up there and was missing
for a night and I went up there and

1158
00:50:14,351 --> 00:50:17,170
fucking tried to look them down.
They got snakes up there,

1159
00:50:17,171 --> 00:50:19,840
the whole thing.
But it makes you think,

1160
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,630
what the fuck was here 3 million years
ago,

1161
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,770
not me.
So I don't know.

1162
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,700
I don't have to be answered.
Did y'all look at the devil stump?

1163
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,980
Yeah.
Come on.

1164
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,611
No,
I'm bald.

1165
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:30,890
Right damn baseline.
When you drive and look at that fucking

1166
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:33,380
thing,
that's a beautiful thing.

1167
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,620
Did you hear about the kid in Minnesota
that got bitten by a wolf?

1168
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,530
Yes.
Wolf fit him in his fucking head while

1169
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:42,800
he's sleeping and wouldn't let cow wolf
was trying to eat him.

1170
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:48,370
He was sleeping outside the tent and a,
I guess you don't know why it was other

1171
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,420
people in the tent.
I don't know what the whole story was,

1172
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,080
but the wolf clamp to hold of his
fucking head and wouldn't let go.

1173
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,240
He imagine what a terrifying feeling it
is.

1174
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:59,630
When a wolf,
a 75 pound wolf has clamped a hold of

1175
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:02,150
your head while you're sleeping.
And this is the,

1176
00:51:02,151 --> 00:51:04,730
uh,
the first known attack,

1177
00:51:04,830 --> 00:51:06,620
uh,
in that state's history that they have

1178
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:07,720
like documented.
I thought,

1179
00:51:07,721 --> 00:51:09,620
fuck is sharks biting people more,
more.

1180
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,700
We fucking today,
dude,

1181
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:14,600
I was in Hawaii and they bit too fucking
people while I was there.

1182
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:16,130
One of them died.
He's serious.

1183
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,770
Yeah.
They get one kid got bit and his leg,

1184
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:21,920
he was surfing and he got bit and
another woman got her arm bit off and

1185
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:25,550
she died and kid live.
The boy lived because his friends,

1186
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,920
uh,
tied his leg off of the tourniquet and

1187
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:29,150
brought him into the,
um,

1188
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:31,220
into the hospital like really quickly.
Yeah,

1189
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,220
they used a,
um,

1190
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,040
uh,
like a leash.

1191
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,100
I think I got like a lease for a Surf
Board and they,

1192
00:51:37,101 --> 00:51:38,940
uh,
they tied off his leg and tourniquet and

1193
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,490
pulled him out of the water,
but they saw him,

1194
00:51:40,491 --> 00:51:43,610
they saw him get attacked by the shark,
bit them in the leg.

1195
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,760
It's tiger sharks apparently.
And they're trying to figure out now

1196
00:51:46,761 --> 00:51:50,060
like the people in Hawaii are,
they're going to do some studies now,

1197
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,820
they to try to figure out why these
tiger sharks being more aggressive.

1198
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,050
But there's,
there's,

1199
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,670
there's going to be a lot of issues with
wildlife in the ocean as well because

1200
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:01,640
these predators don't have as much to
eat because we've fished so much.

1201
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:06,020
We take so much tuna and so many
different fish that they survive off of.

1202
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,540
Like,
I would imagine that a lot of fish are

1203
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:12,050
going to be in real trouble,
like the fish that also rely on the fish

1204
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:14,900
that we eat because we fucking kill
everything man.

1205
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,290
And all the fish has that fucking shit
in it right now from Tokyo.

1206
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,090
I've been seeing all that.
Yeah,

1207
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:23,120
there's a 3% increase.
I think they said in the amount of

1208
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:24,740
radiation that,
uh,

1209
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:26,750
they,
they've found in fish,

1210
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,080
which is not not worrisome as far as
like health.

1211
00:52:30,081 --> 00:52:31,610
Apparently you can get away with a
little bit,

1212
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,220
but the,
the,

1213
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:35,060
the worry is that this could get worse.

1214
00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:36,950
Yeah.
You see that radiation chart where it

1215
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,950
just shows like in like 15 years,
we're all pretty much fucked.

1216
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,790
Fuck is Shiva is fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1217
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,580
That's a scary,
scary situation.

1218
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:44,530
I mean it's,
it's,

1219
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,970
it's a much more scary than it's been,
you know,

1220
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,200
like,
oh my God.

1221
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:52,760
Did you see when Miley Cyrus did on TV,
she stuck her tongue out and showed her.

1222
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:56,780
But meanwhile there's a fucking hole in
the earth that's filled with radioactive

1223
00:52:56,781 --> 00:52:58,970
shit and it's leaking into the ocean.
I mean,

1224
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:00,530
it's really scary.
There's,

1225
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:03,530
they can't stop it.
They can't contain it and they don't

1226
00:53:03,531 --> 00:53:06,590
know what the fuck to do.
And instead we're looking at Syria and

1227
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:08,900
we're looking at all these other women.
Maybe there's threats.

1228
00:53:08,901 --> 00:53:11,240
I mean maybe,
maybe serious someplace we really do

1229
00:53:11,241 --> 00:53:13,040
need to be,
maybe they are using chemical weapons

1230
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:17,990
but for sure that shit is going down to
Fukushima far fucking shore.

1231
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,200
There's a real problem there and tepco
doesn't know what the fuck to do and no

1232
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,710
one in the world has a solution for it.
I mean I don't,

1233
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:25,980
I don't

1234
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:29,580
know what the hell they're going to do.
I mean it's just constantly leaking

1235
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:33,300
radioactive waste and what are the
people in Tokyo,

1236
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:35,070
what's that going to be like in a
decade?

1237
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,530
You know what,
what it means it's right down the hill

1238
00:53:37,531 --> 00:53:39,200
from that fucking place.
I mean what is,

1239
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,440
what is,
what is going to happen?

1240
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,450
What is,
are they going to have any like non

1241
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:46,590
radioactive fish and don't they rely on
fish?

1242
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:49,470
Like there's a huge amount of their
income and their,

1243
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:54,150
their diet that relies on fish.
That's going to be a terrible place.

1244
00:53:54,890 --> 00:53:58,770
It can be a real issue.
You know they're finding radioactive

1245
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:01,710
bunny's like bunnies that have
deformities and shit that live there.

1246
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:04,800
They're born with no ears.
It's like all sorts of weird shit going

1247
00:54:04,801 --> 00:54:04,870
on

1248
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:05,760
down near there.
Yeah.

1249
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,510
What if the fish start turning into
like,

1250
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,670
like,
like these tiger sharks are eating these

1251
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:10,650
radiate,
you know,

1252
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,450
these fish and stuff and it's in the
water and it starts becoming what?

1253
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:16,180
Like a Zombie sharp NATO.
I mean like,

1254
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,500
that's like real,
you know,

1255
00:54:17,501 --> 00:54:18,334
like

1256
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,030
listen,
speaking and imagine that used in court

1257
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:22,920
against you.
I mean like these bits are going to

1258
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:26,220
these physical imagine like you trying
to argue that you're smart and then

1259
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:26,821
like,
okay,

1260
00:54:26,821 --> 00:54:28,230
no,
that's real.

1261
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:31,870
It's like fish shark Nedo Zombie fish
shark nail.

1262
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,130
The,
if the fish become like some Newton kind

1263
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:37,520
of animals that,
yeah.

1264
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,400
Well the,
you know,

1265
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,770
that could happen.
Mean I don't think that's really how

1266
00:54:40,771 --> 00:54:43,410
things me tell you the life isn't a
fucking comic books on,

1267
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,680
but yeah,
and a comic book that would become

1268
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:48,120
Godzilla.
It'd become the,

1269
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:49,440
uh,
the creature from the black lagoon or

1270
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:52,500
some shit.
He thought it was Maine.

1271
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,281
No,
no.

1272
00:54:53,281 --> 00:54:56,010
Godzilla was a creation because of the
atomic bomb.

1273
00:54:56,011 --> 00:55:00,510
Supposedly they the uh,
the US dropped atomic bombs on Japan and

1274
00:55:00,511 --> 00:55:02,340
then Godzilla was born because the
radiation,

1275
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:05,850
like all those animals,
those giant animals Mothra all that

1276
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:06,160
shit.

1277
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,310
Rodin,
I believe wrote made me Rodin was from

1278
00:55:08,311 --> 00:55:11,140
space coming true.
Well that was the idea.

1279
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,090
No,
it's not coming true.

1280
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,070
Just some fucking sharks bit.
Some people,

1281
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:17,520
those are good movies that you saw the
string and it fuck your world up.

1282
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,670
You'll be safe from the MOTHRA string.
Yeah.

1283
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,530
The matras string is shit.
Why

1284
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,260
bad today?
ABC would do monster week at four 30,

1285
00:55:28,261 --> 00:55:31,290
the afterschool movie,
four 30 after dark shadows.

1286
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:35,520
You grew some fucking eat jack.
Pull up some videos of got Zillow,

1287
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,520
Zillow versus the smog monster who the
baddest one was Godzilla vs the smog

1288
00:55:40,530 --> 00:55:42,810
months.
You Marilyn's King Kong versus Godzilla.

1289
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,390
They had to make King Kong the same size
and that was though,

1290
00:55:45,391 --> 00:55:48,750
it's very disappointing to me when I was
boy that I found out how much smaller

1291
00:55:48,751 --> 00:55:50,010
King Kong was and Godzilla,

1292
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,130
it wasn't even close.
Got Dental.

1293
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,700
It's like 500 feet high.
King Kong's 50 feet high,

1294
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:56,820
50 feet high ain't shit.
When you're dealing with Godzilla,

1295
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,390
but in Godzilla versus King Kong all
sudden King Kong is huge.

1296
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,850
That's a good little fucking jam too.

1297
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:03,600
Oh,
Godzilla.

1298
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:09,350
Tokyo.
Yeah,

1299
00:56:09,351 --> 00:56:10,580
those blue oyster cult,
right?

1300
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,420
Yeah.
Look,

1301
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,960
the smoke wakes him up.
Those movies were so,

1302
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:18,920
people today can't understand how
awesome those movies are.

1303
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,910
Oh No.
People don't understand how amazing

1304
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,190
these movies were.
Amazing.

1305
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:28,300
It's La versus Tokyo spreading bad.
This is,

1306
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:33,301
this is incredible.
That's when he became the smog monster

1307
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,130
and he flies around just blowing
poisoned smog on people.

1308
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,143
Kim trails.
Breath.

1309
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,310
Yeah.
He was original chem trail.

1310
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,620
The smog monster.
Look,

1311
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:47,560
everybody look how bad the fucking
special effects are.

1312
00:56:47,561 --> 00:56:48,430
I'm like,
God,

1313
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,570
it's amazing.
Oh,

1314
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:56,660
so good.
What people don't understand

1315
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,880
when you were a kid or when I was a kid
rather,

1316
00:56:58,881 --> 00:57:02,780
and we would watch this.
We would have to be wooed at you.

1317
00:57:02,781 --> 00:57:04,760
You were,
you had to suspend disbelief.

1318
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:09,800
You were just amazed that they could
show you any visual representation of a

1319
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,370
gigantic lizard,
like anything that remotely looked like

1320
00:57:13,371 --> 00:57:14,930
it,
you were willing to accept,

1321
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:15,501
like,
look at that.

1322
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:18,620
Look how bad that is.
But we were willing to accept it because

1323
00:57:18,621 --> 00:57:22,680
we knew that up until then,
like there was stress that was the best

1324
00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:23,780
was the best.
That was it.

1325
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:27,620
If you go to the original King Kong and
the original King Kong,

1326
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,920
the differences in the way the Japanese
did it in the way of Ray Harryhausen did

1327
00:57:30,921 --> 00:57:31,701
it.
Um,

1328
00:57:31,701 --> 00:57:33,740
I think it was ray Harryhausen.
I might've made that up,

1329
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:35,630
but uh,
the animator,

1330
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,030
they used to do it frame by frame.
They would,

1331
00:57:38,031 --> 00:57:40,010
they would just move the clay a little,
took a picture,

1332
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:40,791
move the clay,
a little,

1333
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:41,780
take a picture of moving to clay.

1334
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,613
A little,
took a picture.

1335
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:45,920
It took fucking forever.
But they would have these elaborate

1336
00:57:45,921 --> 00:57:49,220
fight scenes with these clay animals
that they created.

1337
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:54,080
So He'd like King Kong fighting against
dinosaurs.

1338
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,840
That shit took forever.
And look what it looked like.

1339
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:59,990
Look at,
look how fucking fake it looks.

1340
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:01,740
We'll get moves around.
Wow.

1341
00:58:01,970 --> 00:58:04,110
That looked like it hurt.
I said,

1342
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,390
could we got fucked up?
Really done.

1343
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,630
It barely even looks like it's there.
Like play that look a barely even looks

1344
00:58:08,631 --> 00:58:11,300
like it's there.
Like there's a guy in front of it and

1345
00:58:11,301 --> 00:58:12,770
he's looking at it.
What are you doing?

1346
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:14,330
Singing?
I can barely see them.

1347
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,213
It was look at that.

1348
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:16,680
Okay.

1349
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,170
It's weird.
And look at the fucking special effects.

1350
00:58:19,171 --> 00:58:22,140
Like what?
What was King Kong was like 1936 or

1351
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:24,810
search shit.
33 wow.

1352
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:27,720
So back then this was the greatest
fucking thing.

1353
00:58:28,470 --> 00:58:31,530
No,
you can't believe they even pulled this

1354
00:58:31,531 --> 00:58:34,470
off.
I mean this special effects for back

1355
00:58:34,471 --> 00:58:39,471
then were unbelievably incredible.
Like people were so excited to see this.

1356
00:58:40,790 --> 00:58:41,240
Okay.

1357
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,500
When you look at like King Kong itself,
like show King Kong itself,

1358
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,440
like when you see him working.
Cool guys getting up there trying to

1359
00:58:51,441 --> 00:58:56,040
figure out what happened.
Look,

1360
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,710
look how fake this looks.
But this is a real lizard though.

1361
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,100
I think they just stuck a real lizard in
there.

1362
00:59:03,101 --> 00:59:03,660
Nope.
Nope,

1363
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:04,810
nope.
That's animated too.

1364
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,320
Wow.
Sometimes they would do that though.

1365
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,470
They would have a movie and they would
have like a real lizard and you could

1366
00:59:11,471 --> 00:59:13,900
tell the lizard was nowhere near them in
real life.

1367
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,490
But they'd be like,
oh look.

1368
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:19,030
And they would just insert this giant
fucking lizard in the back.

1369
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:22,190
How weird was it had been to act in
these movies?

1370
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,110
Okay,
there's a spider.

1371
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:26,300
It's 16 feet tall.
It's coming at you now run.

1372
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,540
Look at him.
He's like scrambling and then they have

1373
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:33,680
to add in this killer spider.
This is nuts.

1374
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:40,250
Look how bad it looks when they pick up
someone and they're getting bit

1375
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:48,880
so stupid.
But that was as good as the world had

1376
00:59:49,411 --> 00:59:50,810
ever seen back then.
Yeah,

1377
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,580
it was.
It was impossible to get any better.

1378
00:59:53,610 --> 00:59:56,280
Like that was incredible.
Like people must have been so excited

1379
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,460
and there was no,
I mean what fucking TV shows Ron?

1380
00:59:59,461 --> 01:00:03,840
In 1936 how'd he do?
Two or 33 did they even have TV in 33

1381
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,390
one did they invent TV once?
The event of TV.

1382
01:00:06,391 --> 01:00:08,430
Invention of TV,
yeah.

1383
01:00:08,431 --> 01:00:12,930
For a while it was just,
just movies.

1384
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,660
Right.
TV would probably came a long time.

1385
01:00:15,661 --> 01:00:18,840
I was fucking radio like that.
I thought the Green Hornet was a radio

1386
01:00:18,841 --> 01:00:20,970
show and all that Shit TV.

1387
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,630
I didn't find anything for WIC,
which

1388
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:33,990
the invention of the TV.
Okay.

1389
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,790
So apparently there's not,
not a single thing,

1390
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:43,270
not single thing that you can point to
because there was a lot of shit that got

1391
01:00:43,881 --> 01:00:48,881
invented that related to the investment
around with a bunch of people and your

1392
01:00:48,921 --> 01:00:52,070
family and listen for the Green Hornet.
That'd be amazing.

1393
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,640
Eight to nine every Friday night.
And then Wednesday was something else

1394
01:00:55,641 --> 01:01:00,080
and Thursday was comedy night.
Like they'd have like a lot Jackie

1395
01:01:00,080 --> 01:01:02,810
Gleason,
but the other guy like a little orphan

1396
01:01:02,811 --> 01:01:07,460
Annie,
it happened in 1862 was the first still

1397
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:12,461
image that was transferred and this guy
had something called the Pan Telegraph.

1398
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:18,130
So he transferred picture by telegraph
this thing or this electronic thing,

1399
01:01:19,971 --> 01:01:23,360
transfer it and they became the first
person to transmit a still image over

1400
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:25,580
wires.
Fuck man.

1401
01:01:25,581 --> 01:01:30,140
They figured that out in 1862 you know
craze that is slavery became illegal in

1402
01:01:30,141 --> 01:01:35,141
1965 so while they were still slaves,
someone had figured out how to send a

1403
01:01:36,021 --> 01:01:39,050
photo over wire.
Fuck,

1404
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,270
I've been wanting to,
telegram was huge.

1405
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:45,080
Do you remember when you were a kid?
The Chally ran was huge.

1406
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:48,040
That huge ground western union.
Western union was huge.

1407
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,180
You got to go to western and then paid
cash and they've got their credit card

1408
01:01:52,181 --> 01:01:53,770
and that was the beginning of the end.
That shit.

1409
01:01:53,771 --> 01:01:55,630
That was the beginning.
This is incredible stuff,

1410
01:01:55,631 --> 01:01:58,000
man.
They uh,

1411
01:01:58,001 --> 01:02:01,360
in 19 and 18,
73 scientists may and Smith experiment

1412
01:02:01,361 --> 01:02:05,740
with selenium and light and this reveals
the possibility for inventors to

1413
01:02:05,741 --> 01:02:09,160
transform images into electronic
signals.

1414
01:02:10,270 --> 01:02:11,830
Fuck.
Did they figure that out?

1415
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,720
I mean,
think about how nutty that is.

1416
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:18,770
These dudes are riding horses and some
mother fucker figured out how to turn

1417
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:20,370
images

1418
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,510
into electronic signals so that you
could send her them sent,

1419
01:02:23,511 --> 01:02:25,290
send them so he can send them over.
Why?

1420
01:02:25,291 --> 01:02:27,450
Like I was fucking stupid.
I am a hundreds of years later.

1421
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:31,470
What was the first picture of porn?
How to be or always dick probably guy

1422
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:35,250
sets up chicken picture of his Dick is
poop poop find lady.

1423
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,293
It was,
yeah,

1424
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:39,600
some crafty cat.
It's like this bitch has got to see my

1425
01:02:39,601 --> 01:02:40,890
Dick.
If she sees my dig,

1426
01:02:40,891 --> 01:02:43,920
it's on right now.
She wants to stay in Philadelphia,

1427
01:02:43,921 --> 01:02:45,390
so fuck,
what do I do?

1428
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:48,990
I'm in New Mexico sending pictures of
your slaves.

1429
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:51,060
This is amazing stuff,
man.

1430
01:02:52,890 --> 01:02:57,450
So in 1900 they call it television.
It's the world Paris world's fair.

1431
01:02:57,451 --> 01:02:59,850
In Paris,
the first international congress of

1432
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:04,851
electricity was held and that is where
Russian Konstantin pers ski.

1433
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:09,690
Yeah.
Constant team Persky made the first

1434
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:13,710
known use of the word television.
So it was invented by a Russian

1435
01:03:13,711 --> 01:03:16,890
gentleman or the word was at least
amazing.

1436
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,000
You know when you go back and think
about dudes that were inventing like

1437
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:25,270
really mind blowing shit like back in
the 18 hundreds or the fifth you know,

1438
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,080
even earlier than that,
like the dude who figured out the

1439
01:03:28,081 --> 01:03:29,820
printing press.
Yeah,

1440
01:03:29,821 --> 01:03:32,730
but you know how much shit you didn't
have like fucking like interfering with

1441
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:33,990
you.
Like you didn't have the Internet.

1442
01:03:33,991 --> 01:03:36,000
You don't have a TV,
you didn't have shit.

1443
01:03:38,250 --> 01:03:39,810
Oh,
he didn't get no credit.

1444
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:41,610
The guy who invented math,
I bought that.

1445
01:03:41,770 --> 01:03:44,920
I give him credit every day.
That guy was off on fucking poor solar

1446
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:47,670
trailer,
had no money for drugs and just started

1447
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:51,000
putting shit together.
When I saw that on discovery,

1448
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:54,730
I was blown the fuck away.
People who wasn't an invented math

1449
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:55,470
methods.
Her one dude,

1450
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:56,340
who knows?
I don't know.

1451
01:03:56,341 --> 01:03:59,940
But putting a battery,
the core of a battery,

1452
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:02,730
a cold medicine,
just,

1453
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:03,270
just,
I,

1454
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:05,700
you fucking kidding me.
Like what did you come up with?

1455
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,300
Who gave you this recipe?
Was that numb?

1456
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:13,110
Wasn't math used in World War II?
Like the story was that they used the

1457
01:04:13,111 --> 01:04:16,890
Hitler troops used it and the,
they used it on the Japanese kamikaze

1458
01:04:16,891 --> 01:04:19,410
pilots to get them to be willing to
speed.

1459
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:23,280
I don't know if it's the shit that they
have now on a tub that know sons of

1460
01:04:23,281 --> 01:04:24,030
anarchy sells.

1461
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,590
I don't fuck,
I'm just telling you that.

1462
01:04:26,591 --> 01:04:27,990
But what the fuck?
You know what I mean?

1463
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,060
Yeah.
It's not a new drug.

1464
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:35,090
And it was first made in 1887 again.
So 1887 yeah.

1465
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,950
Uh hmm.
So I'm Germany of the picture of his

1466
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:43,890
Dick to some chick.
So before he could invent the camera and

1467
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:46,550
the gifted electronic wave,
you gotta stay up for a week to fucking

1468
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:48,270
do it.
I'm sorry that that was just

1469
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:50,960
amphetamines.
So in Fatto means for 1887

1470
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:54,600
methamphetamine,
which was more potent and easy to make,

1471
01:04:54,601 --> 01:04:59,601
was developed in Japan in 1919,
the crystalline powder was soluble in

1472
01:05:00,151 --> 01:05:01,500
water,
making it for,

1473
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:03,480
uh,
making it a perfect candidate for

1474
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:07,650
injection.
Methamphetamine went into wide use

1475
01:05:07,651 --> 01:05:12,480
during World War Two when both sides
used it to keep troops awake,

1476
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:16,410
holy fucking shit.
High doses were given a Japanese

1477
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:18,460
kamikaze pilots before their suicide

1478
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:23,110
missions and after the war mess and
methamphetamine abuse by injection

1479
01:05:23,111 --> 01:05:28,111
reached epidemic proportions when
supplies stored for military use became

1480
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:33,190
available to the Japanese public man in
1950s,

1481
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:38,191
methamphetamine was prescribed as a diet
aid and to fight depression easily

1482
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:42,220
available.
It was used as a nonmedical stimulant by

1483
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:45,010
college students,
truck drivers and athletes,

1484
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:48,070
and the abuse of the drug spread.
Holy Shit.

1485
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,720
Did you know that these to prescribe
methamphetamines for depression,

1486
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:56,930
let's,
at least in the probably worked the back

1487
01:05:56,931 --> 01:05:57,764
door.
Yeah.

1488
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,720
Well that was in the Liberace movie.
Remember the,

1489
01:06:00,721 --> 01:06:04,120
the California Diet?
He gave us a photo of them amphetamines.

1490
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:06,550
You know what's crazy that I'm,
when I was growing up,

1491
01:06:06,551 --> 01:06:08,150
it was just crazy kid on the block to
me.

1492
01:06:08,151 --> 01:06:12,090
He had
whatever they diagnosed it,

1493
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:14,860
Dennis add,
but they used to give him speed to calm

1494
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:15,910
him down.
Right.

1495
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:18,400
I'm going to be,
he was fucking used to jump off his own

1496
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:18,670
roof.

1497
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:19,810
Why would you do that?
Yeah.

1498
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:22,780
Well they say that's a,
with a Ritalin.

1499
01:06:23,090 --> 01:06:24,370
It,
this was way before.

1500
01:06:24,371 --> 01:06:28,090
Really it was his sister used to sell
him as black beauties.

1501
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,253
Oh really?
Yeah.

1502
01:06:29,520 --> 01:06:31,390
They had this kid on some heavy duty
Shit.

1503
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,410
I used to go to East Stroudsburg,
Pennsylvania and buy a thousand black

1504
01:06:35,411 --> 01:06:39,700
beauties with 35 bucks and I would,
so what is exactly a black beauty?

1505
01:06:39,701 --> 01:06:42,020
It was just a little fucking black
things they made.

1506
01:06:42,021 --> 01:06:45,700
Then the 70s and they were the original
diet pill and it was an amphetamine and

1507
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,450
then fed phenome.
Me.

1508
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:48,230
What do you know what kind of was?
Yeah,

1509
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,260
who gives a fuck?
There were $35 for it.

1510
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:55,840
I sold him $400,035 for it.
I will sell them for 35 to 102 the

1511
01:06:55,841 --> 01:06:58,150
wrestlers,
a dollar a piece.

1512
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:00,120
You have no idea what a cash cow,
that thing.

1513
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,650
Oh my God.
And I remember like one night I went out

1514
01:07:02,651 --> 01:07:03,580
and I had no blown.

1515
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,530
I ate like three of them drank and is
that,

1516
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:09,880
and I was sick for a fucking week.
Like I never rate those pills,

1517
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:13,300
but I remember people cracking them open
and snorting those motherfuckers.

1518
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,300
You know what's really interesting,
you talking about that and you're

1519
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:19,990
talking about selling bootlegging these
illegal drugs.

1520
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,410
It's like,
it depends on how much money you make

1521
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:26,170
and what you do with that money.
Whether or not you become legitimate.

1522
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:28,780
I was a junior in high school,
but what I'm saying is like,

1523
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:30,340
I know,
but look at the Kennedy's.

1524
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:32,530
The Kennedy's did the exact same thing,
the same thing.

1525
01:07:32,531 --> 01:07:35,770
Kennedy's became legitimate.
It became a very wealthy and established

1526
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:38,800
family for moonshine.
They were selling drugs.

1527
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:41,020
They're selling liquid drugs that were
illegal,

1528
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,720
but they did.
They did the right thing with all the

1529
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:45,490
money they got out,
got ahold of it,

1530
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:47,350
invested it in politics,
sending,

1531
01:07:47,351 --> 01:07:48,200
getting,
I mean they,

1532
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:50,890
they did,
they had a lot of fucking money and then

1533
01:07:50,891 --> 01:07:52,780
you know,
they got out of it and once it became

1534
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:54,880
legal or something,
I mean I know how the fuck they

1535
01:07:54,881 --> 01:07:59,881
transitioned at a bootleg yet,
but that's like the known history of Joe

1536
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:00,790
Kennedy,
right?

1537
01:08:00,790 --> 01:08:03,220
The the father,
the father was like a,

1538
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:05,710
he was a moonshine runner,
which is kind of crazy.

1539
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,560
I mean how much different is that
really?

1540
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:11,320
Then you sell on these black beauties.
It's really no different.

1541
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:14,050
It's like morally or ethically it's the
same thing.

1542
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:16,130
So like if you had stuck

1543
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,060
with the black beauty business and then
got into politics later,

1544
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:23,600
I mean that would have been,
that'd been acceptable.

1545
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:27,860
I would say some of those were,
that was right after my mom died and I

1546
01:08:27,861 --> 01:08:30,320
was like crazy.
And I would go on Saturdays,

1547
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,400
this kid nick be a Monte,
he was a football play up.

1548
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:36,500
Then he would pick me up.
We drive like an hour and a half and

1549
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:39,800
we'd go into this room and these college
kids that look like they were 40,

1550
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,860
and that's all they did all week was
make different

1551
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:47,630
things and they would make acid blotter
acid paper.

1552
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:51,650
They would make four way acid.
They would make little Mescalin and

1553
01:08:51,651 --> 01:08:55,490
he'll make black beauties.
And that's what they did all weekend.

1554
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,230
Their parents thought they were going to
school.

1555
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,580
These are these,
you know,

1556
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:01,160
before the computer nerd.
This is what nerds did.

1557
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:02,510
They had,
this was,

1558
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:03,770
these kids are probably millionaires.

1559
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,590
I remember them having z 20 eights were
big and busy.

1560
01:09:06,591 --> 01:09:08,060
22,
1980.

1561
01:09:08,690 --> 01:09:12,830
Both had Iraq's with uh,
the cut moon dish that came out like,

1562
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:15,890
no,
these guys were making money guys.

1563
01:09:16,190 --> 01:09:17,360
Meanwhile,
I'm him and I'm going,

1564
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:19,910
I dad sent us money.
We don't go to class.

1565
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,150
We pay rent.
They had a gambling thing during the

1566
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:24,740
week.
These kids were banging.

1567
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,520
If they were crazy little fucking,
uh,

1568
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,520
I don't even know what they were.
Irish,

1569
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:30,110
can't remember the tee tops.
Yeah,

1570
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:32,890
the t top and Ted Nugent.
And we'd go and they show us.

1571
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:37,550
These guys had a garage with jars of
black beauties jars.

1572
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:41,390
That was that mainstay.
And then everything else they made as

1573
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:44,180
they went along like this week won't
make blotter acid this week.

1574
01:09:44,181 --> 01:09:48,560
We'll make four away as it this week.
We'll make a window pane acid,

1575
01:09:48,610 --> 01:09:50,810
Trump fucking dick complete different
worlds.

1576
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:55,010
Do you remember when everybody had that
trans-am just like Burt Reynolds with

1577
01:09:55,011 --> 01:09:55,910
the Eagle,
the hood.

1578
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:59,780
It was a giant eagle sticker.
Like it was important to have that

1579
01:09:59,781 --> 01:10:03,950
sticker pull that bitch up.
Pull that a Burt Reynolds that was off

1580
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:07,370
trans.
That Eagle stickers important man.

1581
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,010
Like I know,
I knew a dude who had one um,

1582
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:14,510
rebuilt headed a,
it was like for a TV show and they had

1583
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:16,700
to get that sticker man.
That was like a big part of it was

1584
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:20,570
putting that sticker on like you had it.
They had to get it like recreated.

1585
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,790
So they get,
cause they restored the entire car.

1586
01:10:22,791 --> 01:10:25,820
Like that's how big of a fish out of the
one though.

1587
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:29,330
It goes,
it goes back more cooler.

1588
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:32,900
One has exposed headlights,
big feud with two people got an a high

1589
01:10:32,901 --> 01:10:35,670
rock in the same neighborhood.
My Dad became a few,

1590
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:38,840
again to throw down,
I would park across the street and you

1591
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:42,510
would probably across the street facing
the other direction and live a

1592
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,600
headlight,
the loudest stereo on the hottest chicks

1593
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:45,440
horn.
You know what I'm saying?

1594
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:50,240
Like I be listening to,
I'll go fucking Nova and your fantasy

1595
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:52,430
canyon.
Have you seen that video later when

1596
01:10:52,431 --> 01:10:54,840
you've got a minute at home to put the
video on?

1597
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:55,693
Yeah,
that's it.

1598
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:56,361
Beginning?
No,

1599
01:10:56,361 --> 01:10:59,480
that's not the one either because that
has clothes you gotta it's gotta be the

1600
01:10:59,481 --> 01:11:03,590
one with the exposed headlights.
These are all like new versions of,

1601
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:06,650
that's the one that's the real one.
That's the Burt Reynolds.

1602
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:10,250
Jimmy right there.
Oh Wow.

1603
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:14,130
Look how bad ass that cloud was.
I think people who are not

1604
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,140
male cannot understand that.
You know,

1605
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:18,990
you show that to a woman,
especially like a mature woman,

1606
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,530
but someone who's been at college,
they're going to look at that and go,

1607
01:11:22,531 --> 01:11:24,300
what the fuck are you?
What?

1608
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,530
Go back to that picture.

1609
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,910
It would be cool to,
it would be cool to have that like black

1610
01:11:27,911 --> 01:11:30,340
on like silver,
like where you could see only see it

1611
01:11:30,341 --> 01:11:32,530
like silver wise.
I was looking for a better one.

1612
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:33,970
Well there's,
there's um,

1613
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:36,400
people have done like little custom
ones.

1614
01:11:36,401 --> 01:11:37,640
I remember that.
I'd seen some,

1615
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,110
some custom really cool spray painted
ones,

1616
01:11:41,111 --> 01:11:41,531
you know,
like,

1617
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,370
um,
what's it called?

1618
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,920
Air Gun when those are like Aragon
artists.

1619
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:47,800
Remember that they used to do those.
Uh Oh that's a pretty dope one.

1620
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:51,970
Remember they used to do like vans and
on the side of vans would be like some

1621
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:55,060
fucking like a cone and scene.
I could do.

1622
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,440
Yeah,
it was airbrushed.

1623
01:11:56,441 --> 01:11:59,110
Right?
There was a dude with the sword and you

1624
01:11:59,111 --> 01:12:01,750
know,
like fucking women like Frank Frazetta

1625
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,400
style.
Do you remember that?

1626
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:07,270
Like that was a big thing.
Those vans to have a bar in there.

1627
01:12:07,271 --> 01:12:09,610
You will Laurie.
Shit.

1628
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:14,020
Why go to a hotel with the little
windows in the back of that roof dog?

1629
01:12:14,021 --> 01:12:16,010
We could smoke in here.
Popped a moonroof.

1630
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:17,490
But that was like big time.
Yeah,

1631
01:12:17,491 --> 01:12:22,120
the blue roof was huge.
And what kind of artwork you had on the

1632
01:12:22,121 --> 01:12:25,450
side of your vans and fuck it.
You look at it and you go,

1633
01:12:25,451 --> 01:12:30,310
what the fuck was I thinking?
A fucking Japanese guy with a hammer

1634
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,660
with efficient is sexy bitch.
I'm going to pull this up van with

1635
01:12:34,661 --> 01:12:36,070
airbrush artwork.

1636
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,410
There's a couple of guys in Burbank that
have that.

1637
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:41,650
They airbrush vans and it's like they
don't have,

1638
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,410
they'll change them all the time and
then like the latest one was like wonder

1639
01:12:44,411 --> 01:12:45,244
woman.
It just,

1640
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,850
she looked like a Mexican wonder woman.
Now

1641
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,360
Dude,
go to that,

1642
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:53,390
go to van with airbrush artwork,
it's still going strong.

1643
01:12:54,061 --> 01:12:56,610
There's still some fucking cool pictures
out there.

1644
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,130
You just got to find these guys.
I still do it.

1645
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,960
Definitely.
I didn't know.

1646
01:13:00,961 --> 01:13:05,961
I hadn't seen one in a long time.
I've seen cool shit on a like tour buses

1647
01:13:07,501 --> 01:13:09,870
and stuff.
This is the kind of shit that it's like

1648
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:12,270
by me at my house like this is what it
looks like.

1649
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,880
Awesome.
Come on man.

1650
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:17,370
How awesome is that?
Luke Skywalker,

1651
01:13:17,371 --> 01:13:22,020
Obi wan Kenobi c three Po aliens.
That's pretty bad ass,

1652
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:23,190
but there's a lot of them.
Yeah.

1653
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:25,923
Okay.

1654
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,350
Someone's got to have a frank Frazetta
out there.

1655
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:32,220
I bet.
If I look up for Zena Airbrush Frazetta

1656
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,200
that guy had in my opinion,
like the,

1657
01:13:37,230 --> 01:13:38,280
yeah,
well,

1658
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:39,930
yeah.
Somebody who's got something here,

1659
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:41,700
what does that,
that's how it looked like a Frazetta.

1660
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:47,500
That guy had the best like fantasy art.
When you were a kid,

1661
01:13:47,501 --> 01:13:49,330
did you like for like Frank Frazetta,
did you,

1662
01:13:49,331 --> 01:13:51,280
do you remember those paintings,
you know,

1663
01:13:51,290 --> 01:13:54,640
is,
did you ever get into books or comic

1664
01:13:54,641 --> 01:13:56,110
books or any shit like that when you
were young?

1665
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,310
I was big into,
I was into marvel like the four wa

1666
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:05,520
marvel comics for a fantastic four.
I like the silver surfer and the only

1667
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,870
reason it was a long fucking story I
see.

1668
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:10,750
I was,
wasn't until 10 months we'd go to the

1669
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,040
and the city and

1670
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,100
we've tried to buy Batman three is some
shit.

1671
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,250
He was just a couple months.
Then I went off the deep end.

1672
01:14:18,251 --> 01:14:18,611
It was,
no,

1673
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:20,190
no,
no more fucking comic books.

1674
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:23,900
Now it's all spongebob 24 so fuck it.

1675
01:14:24,350 --> 01:14:27,470
Well turned around and came right back
to it for me.

1676
01:14:27,471 --> 01:14:30,050
I was a,
I was really into those,

1677
01:14:30,051 --> 01:14:31,010
um,
uh,

1678
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,790
fantasy artists like Frazetta.
I'm trying to think of some of the other

1679
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:37,220
names.
There's a bunch of other names of guys

1680
01:14:37,221 --> 01:14:40,310
who were like really a really famous for
that.

1681
01:14:40,311 --> 01:14:42,860
But for Zara was my favorite because it
was such a big fan of,

1682
01:14:42,861 --> 01:14:45,350
of the Conan series and he did a lot of
the,

1683
01:14:45,351 --> 01:14:48,770
um,
a lot of the artwork pull,

1684
01:14:48,771 --> 01:14:50,000
pull some of those pictures up.
Man,

1685
01:14:50,001 --> 01:14:50,870
they're credible.

1686
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:53,813
He just,

1687
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,710
it's just like,
that's to me,

1688
01:14:55,711 --> 01:14:59,580
like symbolized that kind of,
that genre.

1689
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:02,640
A book.
Did you ever have a van Joey?

1690
01:15:03,180 --> 01:15:04,360
A Van?
No,

1691
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:07,370
I drove a van for a construction,
you know,

1692
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,100
a hardware company for about six weeks.
Oh yeah.

1693
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:11,771
And then,
yeah,

1694
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:13,770
I got fired though.
They're,

1695
01:15:13,771 --> 01:15:17,430
they're still fucking led the hardware
store on Fairview avenue.

1696
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:18,713
Yeah.
Yeah.

1697
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,410
When you go back and look at some shift
from your childhood,

1698
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:23,520
it's trained.
When you see stuff that's still there,

1699
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:26,040
the guy still fucking there.
That was the first I got arrested.

1700
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:31,041
January 29,
1983 I got caught for possession of

1701
01:15:31,531 --> 01:15:32,850
stolen tools,
you know,

1702
01:15:32,851 --> 01:15:36,480
like a stolen property,
like the dude crying type shit,

1703
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,960
like going out on bail.
I paid a fine,

1704
01:15:39,961 --> 01:15:43,680
I was on probation for six months or
something like that and that was it.

1705
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:46,710
It was dumb as fuck.
But I worked at that lumber yard and I

1706
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:49,890
had a good little job over there.
I was a delivery driver.

1707
01:15:49,891 --> 01:15:53,460
I could make my own little stops.
At that time I was doing a false,

1708
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:55,710
like a,
a settlement type deal.

1709
01:15:55,711 --> 01:15:59,490
So I had to go to the chiropractor.
That gave me time to go to chiropractic

1710
01:15:59,491 --> 01:16:00,880
and all that shit.
Every day.

1711
01:16:00,881 --> 01:16:02,330
It was,
it was just a,

1712
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:05,310
it was like two 50 a week and I work six
days a week.

1713
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,020
Wow.
And I had to drive to the Meadowlands

1714
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:09,450
and you know,
different constructions.

1715
01:16:09,451 --> 01:16:14,451
Tried to drop off tools and or no,
Liam and screws and nails as a shit you

1716
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:15,694
do

1717
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,750
your van.
Uh,

1718
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,020
when I was about,
uh,

1719
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,830
I guess I was about 18,
I had a van for awhile.

1720
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:25,410
For a delivered newspapers.
I bought like a second car because it

1721
01:16:25,411 --> 01:16:29,100
newspapers would fuck up my suspension.
Like everybody who delivered newspapers,

1722
01:16:29,220 --> 01:16:32,940
your suspension got fucked up by the
Sunday paper because it's so much weight

1723
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,470
cause you'd fill up your fucking trunk
with newspapers and then you put them in

1724
01:16:37,471 --> 01:16:39,360
the back seat.
You'd stuffed him in the front seat all

1725
01:16:39,361 --> 01:16:41,800
the way up to the ceiling.
So you were driving around like almost

1726
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,970
completely blind at the right hand side.
Like it was very tricky like looking

1727
01:16:44,971 --> 01:16:48,120
around at where you were gone.
And so after a while I made it a little

1728
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:51,210
bit of cash with this fucking venture.
And like me,

1729
01:16:51,211 --> 01:16:53,670
I'm always thinking of expanding.
I uh,

1730
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,490
I got a van,
I bought this big ass cargo van with no

1731
01:16:56,491 --> 01:17:00,810
windows and then I expanded my route.
I was using him right wagons.

1732
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,180
Well,
I had to figure out a way to make enough

1733
01:17:03,181 --> 01:17:05,910
money that I didn't have to do anything
else while I was competing.

1734
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:10,460
And so the only way I could really think
of it before I made money teaching was

1735
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:12,830
delivering newspapers.
There was the only thing that made sense

1736
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:15,110
to me because it was several hours a
day,

1737
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:17,000
like three or four hours a day,
but when it was done,

1738
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:20,270
it was done and that's it.
There was no boss to answer to as long

1739
01:17:20,271 --> 01:17:22,100
as I delivered the papers to where they
were supposed to go.

1740
01:17:22,101 --> 01:17:23,540
There was no problems and I was good at
it.

1741
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:25,550
I did it every day and it taught me
discipline,

1742
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:30,320
like having something that you have to
do 365 days a year makes you fucking do

1743
01:17:30,321 --> 01:17:31,190
it.
You just do it,

1744
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,490
you know,
we didn't even think of by step.

1745
01:17:33,530 --> 01:17:35,330
You just fucking do it.
It's part of your life.

1746
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,220
You just get up and do it.
I applied for a paper route one time,

1747
01:17:38,221 --> 01:17:40,280
like going into the eighth grade,
I wanted to be a goody,

1748
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:41,960
goody,
goody good.

1749
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:44,360
And I applied for a paper out like in
July.

1750
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:49,220
This motherfucker calls me like
Thanksgiving week and I don't even think

1751
01:17:49,221 --> 01:17:50,090
about it like,
okay.

1752
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:50,870
And he goes,
you got to pick it up.

1753
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:53,570
There was 43rd street hill.
This is a hill and a half.

1754
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:55,870
There's one of those hills in my
hometown.

1755
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,190
They can pay that San Francisco Hill.
Oh yeah.

1756
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,550
Joe Rowe,
Lombard street walk over there.

1757
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:03,380
It's fucking,
you know,

1758
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:07,790
18 inches of snow that east coast snow
and I got to walk in for three weeks.

1759
01:18:07,791 --> 01:18:09,410
I had a breakthrough,
that fucking thing.

1760
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:12,320
Go over there at four in the afternoon.
It's freezing.

1761
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,620
The Sun comes down there.
You're fucking freezing.

1762
01:18:14,621 --> 01:18:17,400
I'm delivering pape and knocking on
people's doors with that,

1763
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:21,620
that loop with the people's fucking
cards and nobody had one of those

1764
01:18:21,621 --> 01:18:23,540
things.
You gotta circle loop and you had

1765
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:27,140
people's addresses when they paid your
last good tippers.

1766
01:18:27,550 --> 01:18:28,940
He had all that shit on it and I'm him.

1767
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,650
After three weeks,
just quit and go on and down.

1768
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:32,900
I ain't doing this shit no more.
That hell is a motherfucker.

1769
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,990
I go work for my mother and make that in
one fucking day.

1770
01:18:35,991 --> 01:18:37,790
What I'm making for you,
40 bucks.

1771
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:41,630
I got to hustle six days a week.
I go into my mother's for one day,

1772
01:18:41,631 --> 01:18:44,780
dad play with football or he fucking
Chinese food and come home and fucking

1773
01:18:44,781 --> 01:18:45,620
50,
60.

1774
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,350
He got the fuck out of him.
I walk up and down the hill.

1775
01:18:49,820 --> 01:18:51,220
Fuck you.
Fuck.

1776
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,470
Fuck.
I learned how to drive in the snow,

1777
01:18:54,471 --> 01:18:55,910
man.
That's what I learned.

1778
01:18:56,120 --> 01:18:59,690
I drive in the snow like all winter long
cause I drove every day.

1779
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,450
I drove every day.
So if it smelled,

1780
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:05,330
I fucking drove.
So I got so used to getting stuck.

1781
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:09,710
I get stuck everywhere.
I'd slide in the trees like I fucked up

1782
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:13,550
a lot of fucking,
my record was terrible.

1783
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:17,120
By the time I moved to New York,
it was like really hard for me to get

1784
01:19:17,121 --> 01:19:19,400
insurance.
I had a gang accidents.

1785
01:19:19,550 --> 01:19:23,270
I was a horrible driver.
Then I made the mistake.

1786
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,250
I'm moving to Aspen and you think,
oh,

1787
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,910
what the fuck you're doing until there's
black ice on that motherfucker.

1788
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,240
Oh,
and you're going down the road.

1789
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:33,260
Listen to the fucking Joe Welch,
uh,

1790
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:34,760
you know,
rocky mountain high.

1791
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,890
You know what I'm saying?
Your car just like this red bag.

1792
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:41,720
Just go shush and off that shish.
This back just starts fucking spinning.

1793
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,480
You just go into a tailspin.
You don't know what the fuck to do.

1794
01:19:44,710 --> 01:19:46,380
This is going to fucking fucking
tailspin men.

1795
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,030
I got to learn how to drive and pay
fucking attention.

1796
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:52,970
This is a complete,
I hit so many fucking cars.

1797
01:19:52,971 --> 01:19:56,880
Joe Rogan dented so many cars.
I love.

1798
01:19:56,910 --> 01:19:58,810
I'm in Seattle.
I was a car salesman.

1799
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:01,840
They used to give me a car.
I would take the car at night and go to

1800
01:20:01,850 --> 01:20:05,630
gigs to one nighters and I lose fucking
hubcaps.

1801
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:07,480
Oh my God.
I was hard.

1802
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:08,100
This is

1803
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,210
a terrible,
terrible,

1804
01:20:09,211 --> 01:20:10,490
terrible video.
Not,

1805
01:20:10,491 --> 01:20:13,500
not this.
One of some people going down a road and

1806
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:16,770
they lose control of their car and they
hit up a truck head on.

1807
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:20,520
It's crazy.
The people from behind them are filming

1808
01:20:20,521 --> 01:20:23,910
it.
The guy in front loses his shit and just

1809
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:26,550
at the right time swerves into the
oncoming lane.

1810
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:30,240
Oh,
this guy just lost and oh my God,

1811
01:20:30,241 --> 01:20:31,280
here you go,
bitch.

1812
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:35,190
Oh Jesus Christ is the scariest in the
wrong fucking lane.

1813
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,430
Oh my God.
And he has to crossover.

1814
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,980
How does it cross over?
I don't miss any of this shit,

1815
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:41,910
man.
I grew up in Ohio,

1816
01:20:41,911 --> 01:20:45,900
so I had to deal with this all the time,
but look at this like you spun out.

1817
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,700
Oh,
oncoming traffic.

1818
01:20:47,701 --> 01:20:49,680
Boom.
The only good part is when you got in an

1819
01:20:49,681 --> 01:20:51,720
accident,
it wasn't as bad because you were

1820
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:53,400
sliding when you hit that.
It's true.

1821
01:20:53,401 --> 01:20:55,380
I mean,
that's a big deal.

1822
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:58,770
That's a big deal.
When you got in an accident in the snow,

1823
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,780
it's like bumper cars kind of.
Yeah.

1824
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,010
Yeah.
People who don't know,

1825
01:21:02,011 --> 01:21:03,630
they don't,
they've never experienced that before.

1826
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,660
Boom.
Like that in,

1827
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:09,210
in any other situation would be a
devastating impact.

1828
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:11,610
It still can be pretty shit.
This is bad because this is like,

1829
01:21:11,630 --> 01:21:12,510
oh,
this is horrible.

1830
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:15,730
What is this guy doing?
He lost his shit.

1831
01:21:16,860 --> 01:21:17,240
Wow.

1832
01:21:17,240 --> 01:21:19,960
Like you give me anxiety.
I'm watching this.

1833
01:21:19,961 --> 01:21:22,960
I'm getting anxiety.
I really honestly think that people who

1834
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,880
don't grow up driving in this kind of
Shit,

1835
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:25,540
you,
you,

1836
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,120
you miss out on a certain amount of
adversity in life.

1837
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:31,780
The fear that you get the respect for
the winter,

1838
01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:33,250
you know?
Oh my God,

1839
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:38,050
Jesus Christ.
This is going to be bad guys spinning

1840
01:21:38,051 --> 01:21:40,970
out head oncoming traffic.
No one can stop.

1841
01:21:42,970 --> 01:21:45,460
How about the month?
Is that getting that call in Colorado

1842
01:21:45,461 --> 01:21:47,200
like that drunk?
Oh yeah.

1843
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:51,820
Well don 82 82 route 80 to look it up.
It's one of the most dangerous roads in

1844
01:21:51,821 --> 01:21:54,420
the fuck it's going over the cliff.
Oh,

1845
01:21:55,430 --> 01:21:57,010
I spun around and got lucky.

1846
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:01,340
This is scary.
Please shut this off.

1847
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:05,180
This is not good.
It's not good for your spirit.

1848
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:08,960
You're just seeing destruction.
That's the weird thing about like the

1849
01:22:08,961 --> 01:22:12,260
Internet and like choosing to go search
for shit.

1850
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:14,770
Like you could see disturbing shit after
disturbing shit.

1851
01:22:14,771 --> 01:22:17,780
I was like,
you just be bombarded by nothing but

1852
01:22:17,781 --> 01:22:21,770
disturbing shit.
Whereas in a real life,

1853
01:22:21,771 --> 01:22:24,290
like it's really hard to run into that
much to start be shit,

1854
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,860
but you could watch if you're,
if you,

1855
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:31,240
if you drive every winter,
you might see one of those crazy pileups

1856
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,080
in 10 years of driving,
we just saw 10 in a row.

1857
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:38,670
You've lived with some places in Boston
with just disturbing waking up in the

1858
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:40,620
morning.
It is and it's one disturbance and

1859
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:43,290
everybody who comes to you after awhile
you start looking at them.

1860
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:44,700
We're like,
what the fuck is this?

1861
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:45,380
Like,
oh,

1862
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:49,380
they put me on like that's how real some
places aren't,

1863
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,420
man.
This place is situations you got

1864
01:22:51,421 --> 01:22:53,820
yourself.
It's just a walking disturbance.

1865
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:57,870
Just the way you don't need to fucking
look at this shit or go online.

1866
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:02,010
Well there's like a hopelessness to to
some places.

1867
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:04,800
You know,
there's some places where when you're

1868
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:06,460
like,
especially in the winter,

1869
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:08,980
this is like a weird hopelessness.
There's no joy.

1870
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:11,920
There's no aspect to it.
Like Aspen in the winter,

1871
01:23:11,921 --> 01:23:12,850
it's kind of festive.

1872
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:16,660
People are scanning the town's Hoppen.
There's a lot of wood burning.

1873
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:20,260
It's fucking amazing.
The woodburnings great wood burning your

1874
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:23,260
whole heart stop.
Fuck beautiful.

1875
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:26,980
It's beautiful.
I remember being eight minutes from the

1876
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:29,530
greatest world,
the greatest city in the world,

1877
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:34,630
and feeling hopeless like the Lincoln
tunnel going across from Lincoln was the

1878
01:23:34,631 --> 01:23:37,600
biggest city in the world in 1980 like
as a kid and going,

1879
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:39,820
you know,
this is hopelessness.

1880
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:43,060
This is too much.
It was too fucking much.

1881
01:23:43,061 --> 01:23:48,061
Then you know it was everything.
You wanted that at two in the morning,

1882
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:52,450
everything you wanted.
You could buy a machine gun with a

1883
01:23:52,451 --> 01:23:55,630
bazooka in Harlem at two in the morning
you go up to Harlem,

1884
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:58,180
there's a Puerto Rican that'll sit there
for 10 minutes and go,

1885
01:23:58,181 --> 01:23:59,020
let me think,
Bro,

1886
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:02,230
what do you want?
What did the machine gun where the clip,

1887
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,150
I want to shoot a thousand people.

1888
01:24:04,150 --> 01:24:07,450
I need to send like a fucking dynamite
and you sit there for 10 minutes.

1889
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:10,150
If I get get it done in my tonight and
you're sitting there going,

1890
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:13,480
oh shit.
Do you remember when that guy got

1891
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:16,360
arrested in Harlem because he had a
tiger in his house,

1892
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,690
Chimera,
that's,

1893
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,810
that's Harlem.
If that story had happened in any other

1894
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:24,130
place in the world,
if that was in Cleveland,

1895
01:24:24,131 --> 01:24:25,150
I'd be like,
how odd,

1896
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:26,620
but it's in Harlem.
I was like,

1897
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:31,000
okay.
I believe that the dude got bit and so

1898
01:24:31,001 --> 01:24:34,160
that's how he got in trouble is tiger
bid him and they found this motherfucker

1899
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:37,330
had a tiger in his house.
He had like a bunch of exotic pets.

1900
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:40,990
Let me pull up a story.
A man had tiger in his house in Harlem,

1901
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:41,824
man.
Uh,

1902
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:47,430
tiger is
Harlem is been gentrified.

1903
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,200
Yes.
A lot of white people live in Harlem

1904
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:50,710
now.

1905
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,910
It's all the way up to 140 now.
Oh,

1906
01:24:52,911 --> 01:24:54,530
he didn't just need to clean,
you know,

1907
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,970
he didn't just have a tiger.
He had an alligator to please.

1908
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:02,560
Those are pimps in Harlem.
I mean as you call her,

1909
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:06,040
this guy's house.
I used to cop coconut all hours there

1910
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:06,874
that night.
I used to,

1911
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:10,900
when I was 18 just out of high school,
I used to go to 135th Amsterdam where

1912
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:13,540
you had a walk through the room with the
chickens are fighting,

1913
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,920
right?
This is real.

1914
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:18,880
And you walked through the room and the
chickens will fight and then you walked

1915
01:25:18,881 --> 01:25:22,900
into a Dj booth and they'd wait for you
and are times I go in and the cops were

1916
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:24,010
there.
They wouldn't let you go on because

1917
01:25:24,011 --> 01:25:26,170
somebody got shot.
And then member,

1918
01:25:26,180 --> 01:25:29,870
when Mike Tyson fight in Harlem,
it form the fucking morning one night

1919
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:32,200
called Mitch Blood Green.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1920
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:34,340
I had a haberdashery.
Yeah,

1921
01:25:34,350 --> 01:25:36,340
the habit dash three at four in the
fucking morning.

1922
01:25:36,341 --> 01:25:38,440
What's a haberdashery and when you go
buy clothes,

1923
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:42,040
men's clothing or something.
But brothers go to buy fucking clothes.

1924
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:43,600
Who goes to what habit?
Dash rip one.

1925
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,330
That's when you pulled from Tom when
you,

1926
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:48,760
a gentleman called that Tom cruise ship.
But what was that movie man?

1927
01:25:48,970 --> 01:25:52,360
We had a call the Arabian guy and get
clothing and the chicks daughter was

1928
01:25:52,361 --> 01:25:54,910
fucking tremendous movie.
Tom Cruise.

1929
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:59,860
Tom Cruise made a movie years ago with
Nicole Kidman as his wife and she had

1930
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:03,680
cheated on him with a fucking soldier.
It was one of those weeds by director.

1931
01:26:03,681 --> 01:26:05,290
That fucking died shut.
Yeah.

1932
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,300
Yes.
That was the thing.

1933
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,290
That was the thing.
All I remember about that movie is that

1934
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,710
crazy dance.
Stanley Kubrick directed that so was a

1935
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:15,290
demented movie.
They go to fuck the chicken.

1936
01:26:15,291 --> 01:26:19,280
The chick dies of a low d and the
doctor's office and he's telling the guy

1937
01:26:19,281 --> 01:26:21,680
to get it together,
but he has to wear a cape and a mask.

1938
01:26:21,980 --> 01:26:24,980
So he calls like this habit Dashia at
two in the morning in New York.

1939
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:27,080
They opened up the fucking door and they
give him a cape.

1940
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:30,570
And then the little Arabian girl fucking
the two Japanese employees.

1941
01:26:30,571 --> 01:26:33,050
This is a tremendous fucking movie that
he goes over there,

1942
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:34,940
he gets in,
he goes to the back.

1943
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:36,770
Everybody's naked every sucking and
fucking,

1944
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:39,980
you've got to walk around with a Cape
and a fucking masculine magician's hat

1945
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:41,870
on.
And then they threatened him and he goes

1946
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:45,260
back home in the coke Kidman and she's
telling me that one night while he was

1947
01:26:45,261 --> 01:26:46,490
away,
she fucked a sailor.

1948
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,680
So it's,
it's like going in his mind,

1949
01:26:48,681 --> 01:26:51,440
you know what I'm saying?
So it's just a fucked up movie he gets

1950
01:26:51,441 --> 01:26:55,100
to address from the piano player at the
jazz bar.

1951
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,960
I took great movie,
by the way.

1952
01:26:56,961 --> 01:27:00,290
It's a dark fucking movie.
Remember they had it for a few years,

1953
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,080
then they released it.
It was kind of weird because it was done

1954
01:27:03,081 --> 01:27:04,910
to working together.
I don't fucking know them

1955
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:09,110
well,
eyes wide shut was uh,

1956
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:14,410
it was about like some weird elite sort
of a cult Scientology through the back

1957
01:27:14,501 --> 01:27:15,270
door.
Yeah.

1958
01:27:15,270 --> 01:27:17,390
Was that what it was like?
It was like he was trying,

1959
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,090
they release mask hung out with Callan,

1960
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:24,670
stuff like that.
There's a 1972 there's some photos,

1961
01:27:24,850 --> 01:27:25,631
uh,
that,

1962
01:27:25,631 --> 01:27:27,250
uh,
Dunkin hat on his website,

1963
01:27:27,640 --> 01:27:31,570
um,
their photos from a 1972 Rothschild

1964
01:27:31,571 --> 01:27:35,440
surrealists dinner party.
It's so weird,

1965
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:37,150
man.
It's so weird.

1966
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:42,160
So this is the Rothschilds I guess I'm
not like totally up on this,

1967
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:43,900
but they're supposed to be the people
that are like,

1968
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:46,090
you know,
elite banker type characters,

1969
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,740
right?
So they've got this,

1970
01:27:47,741 --> 01:27:51,280
uh,
this party and they're all wearing these

1971
01:27:51,281 --> 01:27:52,900
crazy outfits,
man.

1972
01:27:52,901 --> 01:27:55,450
Like this ladies wearing like a stag
head.

1973
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:00,250
Like she has the head of a deer on and a
mask and the man is wearing this weird

1974
01:28:00,251 --> 01:28:05,251
thing on his fucking head and they have
this a dinner table set up with a baby

1975
01:28:05,981 --> 01:28:10,300
doll and like,
it's fucking trippy shit.

1976
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:14,900
Really Weird Shit because these really
were the rock house and they,

1977
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:18,370
this is really how they were rolling.
They really did have parties where women

1978
01:28:18,371 --> 01:28:22,090
would wear antlers on their heads where
they would have naked women,

1979
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:24,560
uh,
pushed around on like a,

1980
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:27,130
uh,
it looks like a casket covered in roses.

1981
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,620
It's like,
it's really strange or at least an

1982
01:28:29,621 --> 01:28:31,390
effigy of a naked woman actually.
It looks like,

1983
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:32,470
I can't tell if that's a real,

1984
01:28:32,700 --> 01:28:35,220
they kill a bitch.
They kill a bitch to they would kill a

1985
01:28:35,221 --> 01:28:37,710
bitch.
It's like just like a hipster party.

1986
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:40,140
Well it's a bit of a party for sure.
Crazy People

1987
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:41,670
party for sure.
But the,

1988
01:28:41,671 --> 01:28:46,020
I think the idea like some freaky shit,
if you want to follow the conspiracy

1989
01:28:46,021 --> 01:28:48,810
theory,
the idea is that these type of people,

1990
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:52,920
these elite societies that what they
would do is they would have these

1991
01:28:52,921 --> 01:28:55,350
rituals and they would do something
really fucked up.

1992
01:28:55,351 --> 01:28:58,110
So no one could ever talk about it.
Like they would kill somebody.

1993
01:28:58,111 --> 01:29:01,490
Like they'd take a prostitute and killer
in front of everybody and then barrier

1994
01:29:01,491 --> 01:29:02,280
or somewhere

1995
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,500
and no one to talk about it cause they
were all implicated then.

1996
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,700
So that's everyone.
You know.

1997
01:29:05,850 --> 01:29:08,310
It's like your bond to this,
this cult that was the I,

1998
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,140
I mean that's always,
look at that.

1999
01:29:11,010 --> 01:29:15,480
The woman's wearing a fucking staghead.
It's like a big deer mask.

2000
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:19,770
How weird.
When you have like billions of dollars,

2001
01:29:20,070 --> 01:29:22,710
it's 1976 and you're like,
fuck it.

2002
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:25,290
You know there was no internet.
You can't get in trouble.

2003
01:29:25,410 --> 01:29:27,780
There's no anonymous is going to fucking
take down your website,

2004
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:34,410
can do some crazy Rothschilds character.
These people back then,

2005
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:38,310
Jesus Christ,

2006
01:29:39,260 --> 01:29:42,470
to have so much money that you pay off
the attorney that night before the

2007
01:29:42,471 --> 01:29:44,270
party,
like a liaison for the police

2008
01:29:44,271 --> 01:29:47,480
department.
You're fucking have a service come in to

2009
01:29:47,481 --> 01:29:50,340
park cars,
the whole lot and there everybody has

2010
01:29:50,341 --> 01:29:52,160
mass.
So even if you do kill a bitch,

2011
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:55,220
nobody knows who killed him.
It was some dude with a fucking goats

2012
01:29:55,221 --> 01:29:57,170
face on.
You don't know who the fuck that was.

2013
01:29:57,530 --> 01:29:59,300
There's no ids.
There's no nothing.

2014
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:02,720
You're fucking bad back.
You're just spreading chlamydia like a

2015
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,210
motherfucker.
Those things,

2016
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:05,570
those I those,
no,

2017
01:30:05,571 --> 01:30:05,811
no,
no.

2018
01:30:05,811 --> 01:30:07,370
I'm lying.
Those checks get checked out.

2019
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:10,400
Those dudes go all,
they fucking send those bitches to the

2020
01:30:10,401 --> 01:30:12,980
doctor.
[inaudible] Pussy Scans,

2021
01:30:12,981 --> 01:30:16,520
ass call the whole fucking thing to the
best scan for pussies and the MRI.

2022
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:17,660
I don't fucking know.
I don't,

2023
01:30:17,661 --> 01:30:19,310
you know,
it's gotta be something,

2024
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:21,470
you know,
some fucking freaky shit.

2025
01:30:21,740 --> 01:30:23,360
Rock Springs,
Wyoming and shit.

2026
01:30:24,290 --> 01:30:26,840
I'm tired.
That's what he'd take those revitalize

2027
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,060
them.
They put some peppiness well back in

2028
01:30:29,061 --> 01:30:30,290
those cowboy days,
right.

2029
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:33,500
They used to have the brothels where
they would like go and this big fucking

2030
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:37,460
wooden building in the upstairs.
I mean all the outlaw Josey Wales

2031
01:30:37,461 --> 01:30:38,480
movies.
I mean,

2032
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:40,880
what was the movie?
Um,

2033
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:42,161
uh,
the,

2034
01:30:42,161 --> 01:30:42,511
the,
the,

2035
01:30:42,511 --> 01:30:45,440
the comeback movie for him way back in,
you know,

2036
01:30:45,770 --> 01:30:48,560
like with Morgan Freeman,
unforgiveness.

2037
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:52,190
Unforgiven thank you.
That movie was about prostituted a

2038
01:30:52,191 --> 01:30:54,440
broth,
getting cut up by a bad guy and then him

2039
01:30:54,441 --> 01:30:56,180
going after them.
Remember that?

2040
01:30:56,210 --> 01:30:57,350
Yes.
That's a good movie.

2041
01:30:57,351 --> 01:30:59,330
I was like,
great fucking movie.

2042
01:30:59,570 --> 01:31:01,520
Unforgiven as in my opinion,
one of the,

2043
01:31:01,521 --> 01:31:04,400
one of all time,
it's a black fucking sheep.

2044
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,920
Nobody really wants exactly or Tosha
what types.

2045
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,930
It's so realistic,
man.

2046
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:12,890
It's like he went and did the exact
opposite of like,

2047
01:31:13,010 --> 01:31:16,160
you know,
like a a hero movie where everything's

2048
01:31:16,161 --> 01:31:16,910
predictable.

2049
01:31:16,910 --> 01:31:20,480
Like it was not predictable at all.
It was very dark and very realistic,

2050
01:31:20,481 --> 01:31:22,730
like very realistic and tuned in to
that,

2051
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:25,610
that era,
like when he starts drinking and turns

2052
01:31:25,611 --> 01:31:27,920
evil,
like you fucking believe every word of

2053
01:31:27,921 --> 01:31:31,370
it when he comes in all sweaty and
fucked up and just kills everybody.

2054
01:31:32,030 --> 01:31:35,000
God Damn Dude.
And how everybody's freaking out.

2055
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:36,860
They're scared.
They can't pull their gun out in time

2056
01:31:36,861 --> 01:31:38,840
and he's just blasted them one after the
other.

2057
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:44,510
That was a fucking hard hitting movie.
We'll have to watch it again this week.

2058
01:31:45,020 --> 01:31:48,400
Maybe we'll watch a Milwaukee.
We have a party and some bitches,

2059
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,160
that whole fucking thing.
I can't stand this age.

2060
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:54,230
You can't stab.
They fight back.

2061
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:56,030
I wouldn't,
I wouldn't want to do it anyway,

2062
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:58,570
but I would say that creepy shit when
they have quick parties,

2063
01:31:58,610 --> 01:32:02,120
the chick know she's going to die.
That's going to be hard when you do it

2064
01:32:02,121 --> 01:32:06,310
with like four people have families as
being sophisticated.

2065
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:08,380
You're a millionaire,
you have so much to fucking lose.

2066
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:11,290
But you know,
that's less than men when you have money

2067
01:32:11,291 --> 01:32:12,880
in the billions.
I can't imagine.

2068
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:14,680
Listen,
you're 50 years old,

2069
01:32:14,681 --> 01:32:16,780
you're going to go fuck it.
I'm going to go do everything I've ever

2070
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,310
wanted to do.
When you read a bucket list,

2071
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:20,560
bitch,
and then that list is getting an eight

2072
01:32:20,570 --> 01:32:23,840
chicks chicks in the world,
getting them checked off a committee

2073
01:32:23,850 --> 01:32:25,480
here.
And uh,

2074
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:26,771
I mean,
just,

2075
01:32:26,771 --> 01:32:28,510
you know,
Fidel used to do that.

2076
01:32:28,990 --> 01:32:31,510
They said that Fidel would go up to you
whether you are married or not,

2077
01:32:31,511 --> 01:32:33,730
he'd send the fucking guy over to you
and say,

2078
01:32:33,731 --> 01:32:36,970
call this number tomorrow,
two o'clock right in the restaurant.

2079
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,820
You could be sitting there with your
wife or soldier would come up to your

2080
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:42,730
wife and give her a card.
You've got to call that number the next

2081
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:43,400
day,
next day.

2082
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,070
Dot.
A fucking car comes to the house.

2083
01:32:45,071 --> 01:32:47,860
Picture your wife takes her for a
physical examination.

2084
01:32:48,670 --> 01:32:51,910
The next day she has to have a nice
dress delivered with some flowers.

2085
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:53,610
She's going to Fidelis with some Yummy
ohms.

2086
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,050
Wow.
So you would have to just address your

2087
01:32:56,051 --> 01:32:57,280
wife down.
We didn't,

2088
01:32:57,281 --> 01:32:58,530
you know,
you're just looking to make her look

2089
01:32:58,570 --> 01:33:00,370
like shit.
He was just steal.

2090
01:33:00,380 --> 01:33:02,130
Why?
I'm not sure about the wise,

2091
01:33:02,131 --> 01:33:03,670
but I know that he was doing it.
The women,

2092
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:05,530
you know,
we was doing it to women.

2093
01:33:05,531 --> 01:33:07,660
Just you run a restaurant and you're
outside.

2094
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:10,680
He would have people going out and
hunting bitches from that.

2095
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:13,000
She got an enlisted guy.
That's a dictator.

2096
01:33:13,180 --> 01:33:15,940
Yeah.
Who knows what you do if you're putting

2097
01:33:15,941 --> 01:33:18,340
in that position,
you know I was watching that thing.

2098
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:22,150
What's that crazy fuck from San
Francisco that made everybody to drink

2099
01:33:22,151 --> 01:33:23,400
the juice down in Guyana?

2100
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:25,870
Oh Jim.
Give a watch that thing for two hours on

2101
01:33:25,871 --> 01:33:27,730
biography.
When you wake up and you can't go back

2102
01:33:27,731 --> 01:33:29,410
to bed,
you had like a fucking red bull at the

2103
01:33:29,411 --> 01:33:32,380
club and you're watching this and you
listen.

2104
01:33:32,381 --> 01:33:36,900
I can see you talking three people,
but he had thousands of people that give

2105
01:33:36,950 --> 01:33:40,180
them the social security checks.
That guy was raking and fucking,

2106
01:33:40,181 --> 01:33:42,190
he had them living in a hutch.
You imagine,

2107
01:33:42,191 --> 01:33:44,770
I'm going to give you my money.
I'm a living in a hunch with mosquito,

2108
01:33:45,020 --> 01:33:47,020
nowhere conditioner.
I got to do my own laundry.

2109
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,860
What the fuck?
Thousands of people who are just lost.

2110
01:33:51,700 --> 01:33:53,890
You know,
we just wanted a new fucking life that

2111
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:55,720
just,
that's mind boggling.

2112
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:59,440
But about the branch Davidians,
I mean they had that place and then they

2113
01:33:59,441 --> 01:34:02,960
would leave the compound and go to jobs
and come back to the compound.

2114
01:34:02,990 --> 01:34:06,050
They all know they're making a comeback.
I don't know.

2115
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:11,190
Yeah.
Something happened to Sun Fun should be

2116
01:34:11,200 --> 01:34:13,750
back there working under a new name or
something like that.

2117
01:34:13,751 --> 01:34:17,890
Then I need to call,
let's say come back.

2118
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,130
Perhaps dividends come back.
Um,

2119
01:34:21,190 --> 01:34:25,630
I remember though when it was a wow,
they are trying to make a comeback,

2120
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:27,280
but this was 2007.
Yeah.

2121
01:34:27,281 --> 01:34:29,170
Well they still gotta be trying,
you know,

2122
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,930
that's a long come back.
I remember part of the,

2123
01:34:33,931 --> 01:34:36,520
the deal though,
the branch Davidians deal was that he

2124
01:34:36,521 --> 01:34:39,310
got the fuck them.
That was like part of his kid.

2125
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:40,390
You know,
he's Jesus.

2126
01:34:40,391 --> 01:34:43,930
He's spreading the seed.
He's got to spread the love and you buy

2127
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:45,100
it.
You got to sit there and look at your

2128
01:34:45,101 --> 01:34:45,970
wife and go,
God,

2129
01:34:46,830 --> 01:34:48,700
you know,
our lives will be better if he gives you

2130
01:34:48,701 --> 01:34:49,840
a fucking stabbing.
I mean,

2131
01:34:49,841 --> 01:34:50,674
it's disgusting.

2132
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,780
I know somebody who lived through that.
Men,

2133
01:34:53,300 --> 01:34:54,370
one of those cults.
And I,

2134
01:34:54,371 --> 01:34:56,740
and she would tell me the stories and
they would sit there and ask,

2135
01:34:56,741 --> 01:34:59,840
why didn't she sued her parents and
today's world?

2136
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:01,640
I would take her parents to fucking
court,

2137
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:05,210
right?
Fuck will you people fucking thinking,

2138
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:05,991
I mean,
they,

2139
01:35:05,991 --> 01:35:07,370
they tracked down,
uh,

2140
01:35:07,820 --> 01:35:09,140
they tracked down well,
what are,

2141
01:35:09,141 --> 01:35:10,850
you know,
they've trapped down in fucking people

2142
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,950
from all of these wars that did walk
lines.

2143
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:14,930
These are war crimes.
Listen to,

2144
01:35:14,931 --> 01:35:18,200
if a kid wants to do something,
he has to,

2145
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:20,450
he has to be an adult.
He has to consent.

2146
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:24,710
There's no kid that wants to grow up in
Indiana and some house with 80 fucking

2147
01:35:24,711 --> 01:35:26,600
kids where they,
they have to eat everything.

2148
01:35:26,601 --> 01:35:29,330
They chill and they,
even with drinking blood pudding and

2149
01:35:29,331 --> 01:35:31,310
shit.
So part of the deal was the guy fucks

2150
01:35:31,311 --> 01:35:32,144
your wife.

2151
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,820
This family I'm talking about,
it hadn't made me nine kids.

2152
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:38,460
Four of them belong to the cult leader.
So after the Colt dissolve,

2153
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,120
now these people got to eat dinner in
the summers.

2154
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:41,900
They're all on Facebook jumping up and
down.

2155
01:35:42,230 --> 01:35:43,910
This guy don't look like my fucking
brother.

2156
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,820
You know what does that do to your
phone?

2157
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,760
And the parents are sitting there
playing the guitar.

2158
01:35:47,761 --> 01:35:51,050
I was jumping up and down like you know
life is beautiful.

2159
01:35:51,051 --> 01:35:53,180
What the fuck?
Life is beautiful for your kids belongs

2160
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:56,420
to some cult leader and your husband is
sitting there like a fucking savage.

2161
01:35:56,421 --> 01:35:58,070
I mean these are things that just
disgusting.

2162
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:02,840
This is just disgusting shit.
They always get the fuck the women.

2163
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,940
That's part of the deal.
That's part of the fucking deal and the

2164
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:07,940
husband's got to sit there playing on
the guitar and making the Koolaid like

2165
01:36:07,941 --> 01:36:12,890
some fucking Jack off
like some fucking Jack off.

2166
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:16,310
I mean I never understood this shit.
What's amazing when they studied cults,

2167
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:20,810
how the same sort of pattern and that's
part of it.

2168
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:24,630
That's part of the fall one cat at the
fuck everybody in this motherfucker.

2169
01:36:24,660 --> 01:36:26,000
It is part of it,
right.

2170
01:36:26,350 --> 01:36:31,070
Weird thing with men and they fuck like
17 year olds on the cusp of being 18 I

2171
01:36:31,071 --> 01:36:33,230
mean these guys were having that these
guys should be shot.

2172
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:37,010
I heard that that particular guy was
still alive in a different state.

2173
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:38,450
Who?
The defense?

2174
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:41,420
The people I'm talking about the Dakota.
Either that they defunct from,

2175
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:44,150
Oh,
this guy five and they're trying to show

2176
01:36:44,151 --> 01:36:44,931
him and,
Oh,

2177
01:36:44,931 --> 01:36:47,510
I thought you made crash.
Killed a few babies,

2178
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:48,551
John.
Yeah.

2179
01:36:48,551 --> 01:36:49,940
Yeah.
They're disgusting after one.

2180
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:53,250
How many minor league cults are there
out there that we don't know about that?

2181
01:36:53,270 --> 01:36:56,210
Is there a gang of them really?
Are the Mooney still around?

2182
01:36:56,770 --> 01:36:58,300
I read Christmas.
No,

2183
01:36:58,310 --> 01:37:01,460
the moonies.
The moonies where like an east coast

2184
01:37:01,480 --> 01:37:02,313
thing.

2185
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:05,960
I don't even seem to have read Chris's
lately.

2186
01:37:06,100 --> 01:37:07,040
No.
No,

2187
01:37:07,041 --> 01:37:10,070
but the little head,
not in boulder then every other week,

2188
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:11,551
but not,
no,

2189
01:37:11,551 --> 01:37:12,800
no.
I never seen him out here.

2190
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:15,290
It's a nickname apparently.
I thought it was.

2191
01:37:15,291 --> 01:37:18,140
The real name is from the Unification
Church,

2192
01:37:18,230 --> 01:37:21,200
so on your moon and shit.
He was big in the 70s they can't

2193
01:37:21,201 --> 01:37:22,280
survive,
man.

2194
01:37:22,281 --> 01:37:23,960
It's the Amish.
Who the fuck?

2195
01:37:23,961 --> 01:37:24,471
No.
Let's see.

2196
01:37:24,471 --> 01:37:29,150
Recent use in 1996 article,
but the independent before foreign prime

2197
01:37:29,151 --> 01:37:33,410
minister Edward Heath gave at a
unification church sponsored conference.

2198
01:37:34,010 --> 01:37:38,180
He admitted the term Mooney has entered
the language and meaning at brainwashed

2199
01:37:38,181 --> 01:37:40,780
bright eyed Zombie 2000 foot.
Yeah,

2200
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:41,960
I guess around still man.

2201
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:45,373
Huh?

2202
01:37:47,020 --> 01:37:48,160
Yeah.
Wow.

2203
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:49,110
Okay.

2204
01:37:49,110 --> 01:37:53,160
The unification church.
It's got to be harder to do on those

2205
01:37:53,161 --> 01:37:54,120
things today though.
No.

2206
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:57,630
Wow.
I don't know if you have to get state

2207

Well you know,

2209
01:38:01,980 --> 01:38:05,160
as far as like religions cause the
church to church and get like a tax

2210
01:38:05,161 --> 01:38:07,200
deduction,
the whole fucking thing,

2211
01:38:07,201 --> 01:38:09,450

01:44:06,531 --> 01:44:08,140
was named Vanessa Williams too,
right?

2356
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:09,190
Remember that?
I don't know.

2357
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:12,860
Remember there was two Vanessa Williams
for awhile and it's fucking confusing as

2358
01:44:12,861 --> 01:44:16,160
shit.
There's Vanessa l Williams and then

2359
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:17,900
Vanessa Williams.
Yeah.

2360
01:44:20,570 --> 01:44:21,403
Oh,

2361
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:23,683
Where's she from?

2362
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:28,920
Um,

2363
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:30,760
What'd she go to?

2364
01:44:30,810 --> 01:44:31,680
Texas.
I don't know.

2365
01:44:31,681 --> 01:44:32,830
Something happened.
It's actually,

2366
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:36,480
Sensei doesn't say,
but yeah,

2367
01:44:36,481 --> 01:44:38,480
she's um,
Nah,

2368
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:40,380
I can't share that one.
She's born in.

2369
01:44:40,830 --> 01:44:42,600
She's born in [inaudible] 63 so she's
50,

2370
01:44:42,780 --> 01:44:44,220
50.
I don't have a guy now.

2371
01:44:44,221 --> 01:44:48,240
I see what you just got a couple kids.
Still works a lot of ABC shows.

2372
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:51,420
She's still beautiful times a mother
fucker,

2373
01:44:51,421 --> 01:44:52,920
dude.
It waits for nobody.

2374
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,903
MMM.

2375
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:57,440
And waits for no.
Oh,

2376
01:44:57,441 --> 01:44:59,030
there's another Vanessa Williams.
Okay.

2377
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:00,240
There's a young girl.
No,

2378
01:45:00,241 --> 01:45:01,700
you go right there and look at it
because he's,

2379
01:45:01,710 --> 01:45:02,740
the next is rock.
Right,

2380
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,110
right,
right.

2381
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,510
Yeah.
It's just like a pumpkin.

2382
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:09,990
Is there
fresh look how big it is.

2383
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:11,310
Pumpkin.
Yeah,

2384
01:45:11,311 --> 01:45:12,440
I'll wear,
yeah,

2385
01:45:12,441 --> 01:45:15,170
we can't show that you get in trouble
folks.

2386
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:17,630
We can get trouble.
Um,

2387
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,850
yeah,
it's,

2388
01:45:18,851 --> 01:45:20,600
it's weird when you go back and look at
like,

2389
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,970
do you ever watch a movie from that era?
Like,

2390
01:45:22,971 --> 01:45:24,770
um,
uh,

2391
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:26,330
I watched,
um,

2392
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:30,110
what was that movie where the guy played
the video game and the video game taught

2393
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:34,520
Starfighter remember that was the guy's
name is Alex Rogan.

2394
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:36,330
I remember that.
Cause uh,

2395
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:39,190
yeah,
but she's got my last name and he was a,

2396
01:45:39,191 --> 01:45:42,140
a,
a guy who learned how to a pilot.

2397
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:43,490
Is this,
uh,

2398
01:45:44,270 --> 01:45:47,390
this spacecraft during playing this
video game?

2399
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:49,030
The best at it?
No,

2400
01:45:49,031 --> 01:45:49,311
no,
no,

2401
01:45:49,311 --> 01:45:51,010
no.
It's like star Star,

2402
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:52,880
Star fighter.
Last star fighter.

2403
01:45:52,910 --> 01:45:53,960
Last star fighter.
Was that it?

2404
01:45:53,961 --> 01:45:56,900
Yeah,
it was so stupid.

2405
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:58,520
Was it?
What's his name?

2406
01:45:58,730 --> 01:46:01,880
The black dude.
And he was like a dress.

2407
01:46:01,940 --> 01:46:04,670
He looked all weird and creepy.
The black guy.

2408
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:05,920
Which buck?
Uh,

2409
01:46:06,140 --> 01:46:08,150
the one,
it says the stars.

2410
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:11,060
Lance guest,
Robert Pete Preston,

2411
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:12,710
k,
e,

2412
01:46:12,740 --> 01:46:14,900
cuter.
See full casting crew.

2413
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:15,800
I fit in,
I know.

2414
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:17,930
Latch.
Just look up the last star fighter.

2415
01:46:17,931 --> 01:46:19,340
I was thinking of something else and
they're like,

2416
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:20,174
hey,
this,

2417
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:25,700
this video game guy seemingly doomed to
stay in his true a park home all his

2418
01:46:26,511 --> 01:46:31,010
life finds himself recruited as a gunner
for an alien defense force.

2419
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:32,450
Who was,
um,

2420
01:46:32,580 --> 01:46:37,550
remember this guy's name?
He was the main guy in it.

2421
01:46:37,551 --> 01:46:38,211
Right?
But yeah,

2422
01:46:38,211 --> 01:46:40,070
that was the main guy in it.
Who was he?

2423
01:46:40,190 --> 01:46:41,560
I forget.
I thought he was somebody.

2424
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:44,420
I think you thinking of a enemy.
Mine.

2425
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:48,140
That's what hopeful.
And you're thinking of a Louis Gossett,

2426
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:50,130
is that what it is?
Louis Gossett jr the guys

2427
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,080
got 100% right.
He's the man from,

2428
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:55,530
remember that officer and a gentleman
that was a great fucking movie.

2429
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:58,320
That was great.
Took me months to watch that.

2430
01:46:58,321 --> 01:47:00,840
I couldn't get over them cause I had a
girlfriend that liked that motherfucker,

2431
01:47:00,841 --> 01:47:02,550
so I hate it.
I hate it.

2432
01:47:02,551 --> 01:47:04,410
That motherfucker.
I went to see American Gigolo and he

2433
01:47:04,411 --> 01:47:06,870
showed his ass.
I lost my edge after that.

2434
01:47:07,410 --> 01:47:09,090
And then he'd come out with office and
the gentleman,

2435
01:47:09,091 --> 01:47:12,680
my quarter for 78th street for $5 with
default hearts.

2436
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:16,770
Why even buy one and the other chick,
that was the first big movie they gave

2437
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:19,930
Steven Bauer after Scarface and fucking
officer.

2438
01:47:19,931 --> 01:47:22,350
The gentleman,
what the fuck your bed at an orgy.

2439
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:25,170
Listen to the rolling stones.
Bad mouth in your country.

2440
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:29,010
He's dropping some knowledge that Lou
Gossett started busting on oak school.

2441
01:47:29,011 --> 01:47:33,420
Karate moves is Chodo con karate moves
and he was like,

2442
01:47:33,421 --> 01:47:34,980
tell her,
oh my God,

2443
01:47:35,010 --> 01:47:36,660
you CSI Miami was in there.

2444
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:40,560
That dude that was taken out.
I remember he pulled them up and choked

2445
01:47:40,561 --> 01:47:42,720
him out.
He tapped out and then they threw him

2446
01:47:42,721 --> 01:47:45,240
out of that.
Plus the other guy was in that movie

2447
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:49,770
officer and a gentleman is deep pull up
the fight scene from officer and a

2448
01:47:49,771 --> 01:47:50,850
gentleman.
There's a couple of them,

2449
01:47:50,851 --> 01:47:53,190
but when he walks up on them,
anybody want to come up here?

2450
01:47:53,191 --> 01:47:55,830
How about you Megan?
Nays that's right.

2451
01:47:55,860 --> 01:47:58,710
I remember his name was Mayo,
but let me tell you what the baddest

2452
01:47:58,711 --> 01:48:03,480
part of that movie is when you really
realize who fucking Richard Gere's is.

2453
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:06,540
The first scene when his father comes in
and they just had an orgy,

2454
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,770
his father was played by Frank Lopez
from Scarface,

2455
01:48:09,960 --> 01:48:14,960
fresh off Scarface and fucking whatever
his name is.

2456
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:16,920
Just combing his hair.
I don't want some,

2457
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:19,860
his father comes any moves over.
He takes his dick out and he's pissing

2458
01:48:19,861 --> 01:48:20,694
in front of him.

2459
01:48:20,730 --> 01:48:22,230
He goes,
that was some fucking night.

2460
01:48:22,830 --> 01:48:24,660
He goes,
not like those bitches and Thailand.

2461
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:25,494
I mean,
he was just,

2462
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:26,790
he goes,
where are you going?

2463
01:48:26,850 --> 01:48:28,950
And he goes,
I got to drop some money.

2464
01:48:28,951 --> 01:48:31,650
I'm a fucking officer.
And he goes,

2465
01:48:31,651 --> 01:48:33,220
look at you,
you ain't no fucking office.

2466
01:48:33,221 --> 01:48:34,800
And he hits the glass.
You Shit,

2467
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:36,810
you ain't no fucking officer.
Look at you.

2468
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:37,561
He goes,
what's your problem?

2469
01:48:37,561 --> 01:48:40,260
You might have to salute me someday.
Fucking tremendous scene.

2470
01:48:40,261 --> 01:48:41,490
He walks out.
Where you going?

2471
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:43,050
Come on.
I was the only kid.

2472
01:48:43,500 --> 01:48:46,710
That's a great fucking movie or a movie.
That scene in the beginning.

2473
01:48:46,740 --> 01:48:48,700
That was Frank Lopez.
Those are,

2474
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,750
those were,
that was Frank Lopez.

2475
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:54,360
I think it was after Scarface.
So he left Scarface getting shot.

2476
01:48:54,810 --> 01:48:56,610
You know they threw him out of,
there you go.

2477
01:48:56,670 --> 01:48:58,610
That's when he's trying to,
he's telling me quit.

2478
01:49:02,030 --> 01:49:04,010
I've changed.
I've changed since I've been here.

2479
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:06,390
I've tried.
Sorry.

2480
01:49:07,510 --> 01:49:08,670
Just polished up.
You're asking them,

2481
01:49:09,410 --> 01:49:13,190
shined it up.
Tell me what I want to hear.

2482
01:49:14,720 --> 01:49:18,330
I want your DOR.
I watched y'all real quick.

2483
01:49:18,860 --> 01:49:20,240
Spell it.
D.

2484
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:22,310
O Oh,
they got to quit.

2485
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:23,600
Yeah.
Then you can be free and you and your

2486
01:49:23,601 --> 01:49:28,601
daddy can get luck and go home.
I ain't going to quit right then.

2487
01:49:29,781 --> 01:49:31,850
You can forget it.
You're out.

2488
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:34,760
That's the line right here.
Oh God.

2489
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,550
Nowhere else.
I got to go.

2490
01:49:42,110 --> 01:49:42,943
I got it.

2491
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,210
Are you fucking kidding me?
It was incredible.

2492
01:49:46,290 --> 01:49:49,360
It was incredible.
I forgive him for all his crazy

2493
01:49:49,361 --> 01:49:53,170
Buddhists bullshit.
Remember after nine 11,

2494
01:49:53,171 --> 01:49:55,540
we need to use love.
He got on stage in New York.

2495
01:49:55,541 --> 01:49:57,670
I was like,
we need to use love and love them.

2496
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,080
Like,
Ooh,

2497
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:03,370
I dunno if that's the right answer.
We need to figure out how to stop planes

2498
01:50:03,371 --> 01:50:05,410
from flying in the buildings for worry
about love.

2499
01:50:06,640 --> 01:50:10,260
People aren't going to be not flying
planes into buildings because you were

2500
01:50:10,261 --> 01:50:13,780
really good and officer and a gentleman,
he uh,

2501
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:15,200
he,
I remember he was,

2502
01:50:16,810 --> 01:50:19,930
he was on the belt buckles to fucking
those dudes.

2503
01:50:20,220 --> 01:50:22,870
He was due for CSI.
Miami comes up in this dog.

2504
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,180
Is it worth you making a couple dollars?
Oh,

2505
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:26,550
that's right.
That's right.

2506
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:29,390
It was selling [inaudible] belt buckles.
Sorry,

2507
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:31,810
got the trophy dog trouble cause he was
hustling.

2508
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:35,110
God,
what's his name at the store?

2509
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:37,810
One that I shook his hand.
He's like a big Aa guy,

2510
01:50:37,811 --> 01:50:41,010
you know Lou Gossett Jr is he?
He was at the store one night,

2511
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:41,671
man.
Cool it.

2512
01:50:41,671 --> 01:50:43,840
Fuck,
I shook his fucking hand and I said,

2513
01:50:43,841 --> 01:50:45,790
Doug Office and the gentleman,
you know,

2514
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:47,130
you were bad.
Dude you've been,

2515
01:50:47,180 --> 01:50:50,500
you got a tremendous resume.
Do you remember good times?

2516
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:52,120
Fuck yeah.
I saw the father up.

2517
01:50:52,121 --> 01:50:56,800
Got To remember we all the time.
I used to be a standup comic up here.

2518
01:50:57,220 --> 01:50:59,230
Oh he was.
He was fucking hilarious,

2519
01:50:59,231 --> 01:51:00,790
man.
Johnny Moss.

2520
01:51:01,690 --> 01:51:03,220
He was,
that guy was fun.

2521
01:51:03,300 --> 01:51:04,810
He was so nice,
dude.

2522
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:05,380
Yeah,
very,

2523
01:51:05,380 --> 01:51:08,620
very fucking nice.
He was the first like really famous

2524
01:51:08,621 --> 01:51:12,240
guide that I ever met that I didn't feel
weird talking to him.

2525
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:16,180
He gave you no judgment like he was just
hanging out with you.

2526
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:18,100
He was a fan of comedy.
He respected it.

2527
01:51:18,610 --> 01:51:21,190
So that's the difference when somebody
sits back then goes dog,

2528
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:22,330
I appreciate what the fuck you do.

2529
01:51:22,330 --> 01:51:25,090
I tried it for three years and it wasn't
me.

2530
01:51:25,091 --> 01:51:28,580
I remember the dude from bad ass act.
Johnny Palumbo

2531
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,350
always come into this store.
Glenn Plummer,

2532
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:36,220
who's at black dude that was in the
movie with Sean Penn when they did it

2533
01:51:36,221 --> 01:51:38,710
more with the gangs in La,
and then he did a thousand things.

2534
01:51:38,711 --> 01:51:41,150
I just saw him and fucking son's I
Anika.

2535
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:42,250
I mean,
he's still working.

2536
01:51:42,730 --> 01:51:44,860
I stole him at the store.
He didn't come up to me and go,

2537
01:51:44,861 --> 01:51:46,270
dog,
what you do?

2538
01:51:46,271 --> 01:51:46,961
And I'm like,
really?

2539
01:51:46,961 --> 01:51:48,640
You don't want to do it?
I remember hosting at the store,

2540
01:51:48,660 --> 01:51:49,870
bringing them up,
but I'm going to dog.

2541
01:51:49,871 --> 01:51:51,490
Please don't embarrass me.
I go,

2542
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:54,760
you've done movies with fucking Andy
Guards.

2543
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:57,430
Shaya he sent two things to do in
Denver.

2544
01:51:57,431 --> 01:51:59,860
When you're dead.
See the two black dudes.

2545
01:52:00,010 --> 01:52:05,010
It's him and the dude from fucking this
guy called,

2546
01:52:06,650 --> 01:52:08,500
yeah.
He used to come to a store all the time.

2547
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,850
That guys excellent.
Yeah.

2548
01:52:11,010 --> 01:52:14,590
He just got shot on sons of anarchy and
last two seasons or something like that.

2549
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:17,780
It's amazing of John Amos was the first
guy that,

2550
01:52:17,781 --> 01:52:20,370
uh,
that ever gave me a compliment to that

2551
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:22,810
that was like famous.
Like the first guy that I ever talked

2552
01:52:22,811 --> 01:52:25,270
to,
like the told me that a good time am I

2553
01:52:25,271 --> 01:52:27,550
am at a show.
They were sitting the back of the store

2554
01:52:27,580 --> 01:52:28,960
all the time.
A great time.

2555
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:31,290
And it would come up to you and talk to
you about that man.

2556
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:34,120
Joey,
I'd love when you did this big man.

2557
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:37,240
The way he did that.
And I remember I used to have that tiger

2558
01:52:37,241 --> 01:52:38,190
fucking bit.
Yeah,

2559
01:52:38,191 --> 01:52:39,830
yeah.
Chemo to me one night after show it,

2560
01:52:39,831 --> 01:52:42,970
he goes,
you're so free up there man.

2561
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:44,740
He goes,
it's you're so free.

2562
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:46,220
And I even,
I

2563
01:52:46,280 --> 01:52:48,110
had to figure out how to do that bit
right.

2564
01:52:48,350 --> 01:52:51,050
And one of the ways that I learned how
to do that bit right,

2565
01:52:51,051 --> 01:52:51,800
it was like,
you know,

2566
01:52:51,800 --> 01:52:55,340
do it different ways.
And he kind of explained to me like what

2567
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:56,830
was good about it?
He,

2568
01:52:56,880 --> 01:52:58,970
he like,
cause he's such a great actor.

2569
01:52:59,240 --> 01:53:02,210
Like even in good times,
like he's watched that show.

2570
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:03,380
Yes.
Fuck yeah.

2571
01:53:03,381 --> 01:53:06,430
He says that's right.
He got his foot chopped off.

2572
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:07,190
Remember?
Yes,

2573
01:53:07,190 --> 01:53:08,360
he was rude.
He,

2574
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:11,960
he was so good as an actor.
Like even in like a sitcom.

2575
01:53:11,961 --> 01:53:14,390
It's like he had these powerful fucking
moments,

2576
01:53:14,391 --> 01:53:16,460
right.
So when he told me,

2577
01:53:16,461 --> 01:53:17,151
it's like,
you know,

2578
01:53:17,151 --> 01:53:19,640
like yourself,
it's so we free up there when you're

2579
01:53:19,641 --> 01:53:21,350
doing that,
you so free because you're not thinking

2580
01:53:21,351 --> 01:53:22,520
about shit.
He's like,

2581
01:53:22,521 --> 01:53:24,560
you,
you like thinking like that tiger.

2582
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:26,600
And I realized like,
that's really the way to do it.

2583
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:28,910
You've got to actually almost pretend
you're a tiger.

2584
01:53:28,911 --> 01:53:32,240
Like think like that thing thinks.
And that's the way it works.

2585
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:35,870
I kind of figured it out because of him,
because of him talking to me about it.

2586
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:36,651
I was like,
Oh yeah,

2587
01:53:36,651 --> 01:53:38,330
that's it.
That's it.

2588
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:40,700
And it was,
it made me so confident because he

2589
01:53:40,701 --> 01:53:41,870
built,
because he said that,

2590
01:53:42,300 --> 01:53:43,131
you know,
like Jesus,

2591
01:53:43,131 --> 01:53:46,100
John Amos said that it's gotta be right.
It's like this is 100%.

2592
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,740
Like that's the guy from roots.
That's the guy from good times.

2593
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:51,320
That's John Stamos captain room or
coming to America.

2594
01:53:52,970 --> 01:53:53,930
That's right.

2595
01:53:55,570 --> 01:54:00,570
We're compatible off the drugs.
Uh,

2596
01:54:02,760 --> 01:54:05,850
that's incredible.
I watched old mythologically again the

2597
01:54:05,851 --> 01:54:06,341
other night.
Oh,

2598
01:54:06,341 --> 01:54:07,930
the Richard Pryor documentary to watch
it.

2599
01:54:07,931 --> 01:54:08,820
Yeah.
Dude,

2600
01:54:08,821 --> 01:54:11,080
that makes me nervous.
You got to watch where he goes to the

2601
01:54:11,081 --> 01:54:14,620
Hollywood bowl when he goes to the
Hollywood bowl and goes off.

2602
01:54:14,700 --> 01:54:17,530
It's amazing for some gay foundation,
the people.

2603
01:54:17,531 --> 01:54:19,780
But you know,
what did he do?

2604
01:54:19,870 --> 01:54:24,870
He went to the Hollywood bowl for this
back thing or style in the middle of the

2605
01:54:25,361 --> 01:54:27,970
support gay people and he got up out
there.

2606
01:54:27,971 --> 01:54:29,680
He goes,
what the fuck were you when they burned

2607
01:54:29,681 --> 01:54:30,514
him?
Watch,

2608
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:33,610
you could kiss my rich black ass.
Fuck.

2609
01:54:34,070 --> 01:54:36,460
And they got off in the host got hurt.
I'm so embarrassed.

2610
01:54:36,461 --> 01:54:38,380
Oh my God.
And they're booing him.

2611
01:54:38,381 --> 01:54:40,510
And the next day it was in variety and
shit.

2612
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,411
Really?
You know,

2613
01:54:41,411 --> 01:54:43,480
they gave him more of his dog and they
took it back.

2614
01:54:43,481 --> 01:54:46,660
He made Jim Brown,
the president of his company.

2615
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,490
How much blower you doing?

2616
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,910
Well,
he was doing a lot of things with Jim

2617
01:54:51,910 --> 01:54:53,970
Brown.
Jim Brown was in his act.

2618
01:54:54,040 --> 01:54:56,490
Remember Jim telling them to get off
cocaine?

2619
01:54:56,610 --> 01:54:58,740
Very interesting.
Oh,

2620
01:54:58,741 --> 01:54:59,550
Midville Hillary.
Yet.

2621
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:01,740
You know what men,
it makes you scared because you know

2622
01:55:01,741 --> 01:55:05,040
that there's parts at the relate.
We're obsession at other ways.

2623
01:55:05,130 --> 01:55:07,200
You know what they are.
We're obsessed in other ways that

2624
01:55:07,201 --> 01:55:08,760
whatever,
that doesn't have to be cocaine.

2625
01:55:08,761 --> 01:55:11,570
And when he was married seven times
drove,

2626
01:55:13,010 --> 01:55:15,680
well what about the time when he went
upstairs to the bedroom?

2627
01:55:15,690 --> 01:55:17,460
They got to go to the next morning,
knocked on my door.

2628
01:55:17,550 --> 01:55:18,091
I go,
Richard,

2629
01:55:18,091 --> 01:55:18,924
what are you doing?
He goes,

2630
01:55:19,140 --> 01:55:21,460
I got to get a divorce.
You know?

2631
01:55:21,630 --> 01:55:24,420
It was just crazy.
That's crazy shit.

2632
01:55:24,930 --> 01:55:29,320
But that's what people don't know is
when you're in that zone and you to the

2633
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:31,390
comedy store,
the Chinese guys are giving you the

2634
01:55:31,391 --> 01:55:33,750
drinks in the back.
I can't even imagine.

2635
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,650
I couldn't be,
I couldn't imagine being mentally

2636
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:40,560
Kennison was there with Lemmy clock and
there's 18 head is in the back and

2637
01:55:40,561 --> 01:55:44,340
everybody's drinking Mitzi shore and
know we always talk about this,

2638
01:55:44,341 --> 01:55:46,670
but we got to show the mental side of
the comedy,

2639
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:48,210
Bro.
You gotta be a savage.

2640
01:55:48,690 --> 01:55:51,210
There's a part of you that after a
certain level you have to become a

2641
01:55:51,211 --> 01:55:52,980
savage.
You really do,

2642
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:54,660
man.
I'm a savage and I'm proud of it.

2643
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,730
Yeah.
There's no way around it.

2644
01:55:56,910 --> 01:55:58,560
If you don't do it,
you won't survive.

2645
01:55:58,590 --> 01:56:02,670
Like the very thing that you need to
become a a real comic.

2646
01:56:03,060 --> 01:56:05,790
It's like you have to have this freedom.
You have to have a freedom of thinking.

2647
01:56:05,820 --> 01:56:08,100
You have to of ability to go to these
dark places.

2648
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:11,190
And we did.
We learned that from that fucking crazy

2649
01:56:11,191 --> 01:56:12,090
haunted house.

2650
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,640
You did a little,
but you learned it there.

2651
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:20,700
You learn it to learn how to be changed.
Listen man,

2652
01:56:20,701 --> 01:56:25,380
I remember being 16 and going home.
You had junior in high school.

2653
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:28,470
I wasn't sleeping.
I mean at this time there was no sleep

2654
01:56:28,471 --> 01:56:30,600
apnea.
I just wasn't sleeping well.

2655
01:56:30,780 --> 01:56:33,120
You were doing coke,
doing coke by myself,

2656
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:36,330
by yourself.
Go home and listen to master reality by

2657
01:56:36,331 --> 01:56:40,860
black Sabbath into the void and people
hope to hang on the road.

2658
01:56:41,550 --> 01:56:44,190
And I would put due to coke and I
probably do a little hit of masculine

2659
01:56:44,191 --> 01:56:47,280
too or something to get me going.
And I'd sit in that fucking corn.

2660
01:56:47,281 --> 01:56:48,810
I didn't smoke cigarettes,
I didn't do nothing.

2661
01:56:48,811 --> 01:56:49,890
I just go do this.
Look,

2662
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:52,920
I'd rock like a fucking retard back and
forth.

2663
01:56:52,921 --> 01:56:55,320
I still remember that shit and I'd be
like,

2664
01:56:55,321 --> 01:56:57,120
Jesus Christ,
this is my life.

2665
01:56:57,121 --> 01:56:59,310
I'm going to fucking kill somebody else
up to this shit

2666
01:57:02,290 --> 01:57:06,160
days can you stay up for before you
start going crazy?

2667
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:07,060
There's a number,
right?

2668
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:08,080
Three.
Three.

2669
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,240
How many days have you ever done it?
Coke.

2670
01:57:10,570 --> 01:57:12,610
How many days you stayed up?
I have never done that.

2671
01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:14,350
Never stayed up.
I never did that.

2672
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,240
I said I went to bed.
How many days have you stayed at one

2673
01:57:16,241 --> 01:57:19,690
time?
I stayed up three nights,

2674
01:57:20,490 --> 01:57:23,520
Saturday and by Saturday night I kept
calling the police.

2675
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:25,530
Right.
I could call the police.

2676
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:27,090
Tell me about that.
For somebody in my house.

2677
01:57:27,091 --> 01:57:28,560
Right.
And they kept,

2678
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:32,010
there's one that was house sitting on
far away road and Snowmass village.

2679
01:57:32,430 --> 01:57:33,300
Wow.
Okay.

2680
01:57:33,301 --> 01:57:35,220
And I'm up there like me and my
girlfriend,

2681
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:38,160
we're going to have huff listen to this.
Me and my girlfriend at the time,

2682
01:57:38,550 --> 01:57:41,760
I'm going to her brother's wedding and
I'm going to meet her parents for the

2683
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:45,600
first time and I went to New York and I
got two answers have blown like gay.

2684
01:57:45,620 --> 01:57:49,110
Went to the electrician buddy of mine,
and I started holding them to this.

2685
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:53,610
I'm going to pick it up the night before
I go to fucking this wedding and I get

2686
01:57:53,611 --> 01:57:56,130
there by 11 o'clock on a Thursday night,
I pick up the ounce.

2687
01:57:56,131 --> 01:57:59,430
I go home about one o'clock the
motherfuckers calling me,

2688
01:58:00,270 --> 01:58:01,590
I do a line,
I do another one.

2689
01:58:01,770 --> 01:58:04,680
Let me tell you how bad it got.
The dog I had at the time,

2690
01:58:04,681 --> 01:58:07,110
Hercules was probably a year old.
I loved him.

2691
01:58:07,111 --> 01:58:08,670
I didn't let them out of the House the
whole weekend.

2692
01:58:09,120 --> 01:58:12,510
He held that pistol like a soldier.
You know what sent me?

2693
01:58:12,511 --> 01:58:14,420
I didn't let her whole weekend the hell
was going to hit.

2694
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:15,870
I wouldn't let him out.
This is not crazy.

2695
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:17,490
I possible.
Who the fuck cares?

2696
01:58:17,491 --> 01:58:19,200
You didn't piss.
I kept looking at him every time he

2697
01:58:19,201 --> 01:58:20,420
cried.
That's it.

2698
01:58:20,430 --> 01:58:22,410
You ain't going out.
And I had no porn.

2699
01:58:22,730 --> 01:58:24,150
Right.
So I whacked off to,

2700
01:58:24,151 --> 01:58:28,110
what's the movie with the Lady in red?
Vanessa Redgrave.

2701
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:31,270
The lady in red.
The chicken there was married to Steve

2702
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:32,100
Seagal.
You're fuck.

2703
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:33,660
Oh.
What is her name?

2704
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:35,350
Michelle Brock.
Look.

2705
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:38,460
Kelly.
Kelly,

2706
01:58:38,510 --> 01:58:41,650
Lebron and woman and red shows up pussy
for a slip.

2707
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:43,420
Second us.
Yes she does.

2708
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,400
When gene wilder cause for her.

2709
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:49,540
When gene wilder cause for her,
she runs off to bed and they show her

2710
01:58:49,541 --> 01:58:51,730
Bush.
I figured out what the VCR,

2711
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:55,960
how to lock it on the fucking Bush,
and I'd sit there with my Dick and my

2712
01:58:55,961 --> 01:58:58,600
belly button and I'd walk it off and
then I'd hear him.

2713
01:58:58,601 --> 01:59:02,500
Something happened and I called the cops
and that's when the third time they sat

2714
01:59:02,501 --> 01:59:03,101
me down.
They're like,

2715
01:59:03,101 --> 01:59:04,540
listen,
you got to stop doing cocaine.

2716
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:07,900
I had the cocaine hidden in the sink,
so if somebody happened,

2717
01:59:07,901 --> 01:59:11,170
I lift a water and hit the compressive
button over here.

2718
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:16,660
But there's one tiny minute and in lady
in red where she shows her fucking

2719
01:59:16,661 --> 01:59:18,550
pussy,
she shows her bread hot panties.

2720
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:19,420
Right?
That's the idea.

2721
01:59:19,450 --> 01:59:21,130
No,
she gets up off the bed.

2722
01:59:21,160 --> 01:59:24,580
It says let's her dress fly and chose
her red hot pants.

2723
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:29,860
Now which one gene wilder come calling
for and she gets up and it shows that

2724
01:59:29,861 --> 01:59:32,050
little Bush all that drove me fucking
crazy.

2725
01:59:32,051 --> 01:59:34,750
I sat that she,
she reminded me of an old girlfriend in

2726
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:37,060
high school.
She was beautiful.

2727
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:40,390
God,
gene wilder.

2728
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:43,000
Gene Wilder and her were in a movie
together.

2729
01:59:43,001 --> 01:59:44,710
Naked.
That's what I'm saying.

2730
01:59:44,780 --> 01:59:46,600
We can approximate breeze.
Yes.

2731
01:59:47,020 --> 01:59:47,781
I know.
I know him.

2732
01:59:47,781 --> 01:59:49,240
Three San Bernardino.
That's crazy.

2733
01:59:49,241 --> 01:59:50,500
Lady in red.
That's what it was called.

2734
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:51,720
Lady.
A woman in red.

2735
01:59:51,850 --> 01:59:52,631
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

2736
01:59:52,631 --> 01:59:56,020
A woman.
She was in Steven Seagal movies too,

2737
01:59:56,050 --> 01:59:56,821
right?
She was in,

2738
01:59:56,821 --> 01:59:58,720
she was ended up back from war,
whatever,

2739
01:59:58,721 --> 02:00:00,060
like back from the war.

2740
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:04,990
She started and he started to beat that
member.

2741
02:00:05,980 --> 02:00:06,640
I don't know.
Yeah.

2742
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:09,100
He started beating her and put
membership is an acupuncture.

2743
02:00:09,101 --> 02:00:09,881
True.
Yeah.

2744
02:00:09,881 --> 02:00:12,860
He was her acupuncturist and when they
just started a beat,

2745
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:13,780
they said,
fuck the needle

2746
02:00:17,740 --> 02:00:18,790
making shit up,
man.

2747
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:19,930
No,
he did beat it.

2748
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:22,990
He did something so she's pissed.
She was on celebrity Rehab,

2749
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,390
one of those celebrity losing weight
show.

2750
02:00:25,900 --> 02:00:26,990
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2751
02:00:26,991 --> 02:00:29,390
I'm telling you guys what,
come on now here.

2752
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,333
Yeah.
She's,

2753
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,760
I think Steve's to Gal stowed movie was
with her back in danger.

2754
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:39,760
Whatever the fuck with the kid.
They shot the kid and him at the wife

2755
02:00:39,761 --> 02:00:42,280
and then he went to the ranch.
Yeah.

2756
02:00:42,281 --> 02:00:45,280
She know.
She gained the weight.

2757
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,130
Steven Seagal stress,
man.

2758
02:00:47,410 --> 02:00:50,260
A lot of God damn stress.
She moved to a fucking ranch and started

2759
02:00:50,261 --> 02:00:52,570
eating potato chips.
There was no stress with that.

2760
02:00:52,570 --> 02:00:55,600
Steve was a guy money.
She saw what he made on one of those

2761
02:00:55,601 --> 02:00:58,720
fucking movies.
He was a guy was getting paid though for

2762
02:00:58,730 --> 02:01:01,210
awhile.
He was a big mega star.

2763
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:03,160
No doubt.
Look at.

2764
02:01:03,200 --> 02:01:05,650
Yeah.
When he was doing like above the law and

2765
02:01:05,651 --> 02:01:07,000
all those movies and blah,
blah,

2766
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:07,880
blah.
The good movie.

2767
02:01:07,900 --> 02:01:10,840
Don't ever get confused moving.
They wouldn't never gave him the other

2768
02:01:10,841 --> 02:01:14,290
eight if above the law in the beginning
when he's doing the class with the Guy

2769
02:01:14,290 --> 02:01:15,123
Kido dude.
Oh yeah.

2770
02:01:15,130 --> 02:01:16,840
That's how the movie starts going down a
good chunk.

2771
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:17,913
Gotcha.
Gotcha.

2772
02:01:17,980 --> 02:01:20,920
When he goes to that bar,
starts slapping people with that fucking

2773
02:01:20,921 --> 02:01:23,020
straight arm to the neck.
That was true.

2774
02:01:23,740 --> 02:01:26,020
Then he started killing Jamaicans.
What was the mood with the fucking

2775
02:01:26,021 --> 02:01:29,120
Jamaicans and shit?
I see that black dude auditions.

2776
02:01:29,170 --> 02:01:30,490
Just Shit.
I want to shake his head.

2777
02:01:30,940 --> 02:01:33,220
What's the mood with the Jamaicans when
he went to the mall?

2778
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,440
What's the Colombians in the Santa
Maria?

2779
02:01:35,690 --> 02:01:38,820
Fucking tremendous.
That movie that was was that movie that

2780
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:39,663
was back for more.

2781
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:45,230
Oh,
that's funny.

2782
02:01:45,260 --> 02:01:48,260
Okay.
What is is a Wikipedia and find out what

2783
02:01:48,261 --> 02:01:49,910
the fuck that movie is.
He's still banging out.

2784
02:01:49,920 --> 02:01:52,280
Mover marked for death.
That's a good one.

2785
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,650
How many movies you think he's done and
take us?

2786
02:01:55,220 --> 02:01:59,090
60 to 67 I bet he's done.
Yeah.

2787
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:01,640
Let's see.
Uh Oh.

2788
02:02:01,641 --> 02:02:04,940
He did stunts in some earlier movies,
man.

2789
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:09,740
Never say never again is a James Bond
movie was a martial arts instructor in

2790
02:02:09,741 --> 02:02:14,741
that view to a kill.
And then above the law was like 88.

2791
02:02:16,730 --> 02:02:17,840
Yeah.
That was his first movie.

2792
02:02:18,290 --> 02:02:19,520
Damn.
This motherfucker's dot whole.

2793
02:02:19,660 --> 02:02:22,370
I kidnap that dude and the cops were
looking for me.

2794
02:02:22,371 --> 02:02:27,170
I hit that with above the law and lethal
weapon and I fucking watch them over and

2795
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:29,060
over and I was blown away by above the
law.

2796
02:02:29,120 --> 02:02:31,670
I really was.
I was blown up the Jamaicans,

2797
02:02:32,030 --> 02:02:32,950
what was his name?
What was it?

2798
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:35,010
Quiz.
What was the fucking black one eye.

2799
02:02:35,100 --> 02:02:37,490
Glass side.
What was the Jamaicans name?

2800
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:41,510
He killed the brother.
And then the brother popped up when you

2801
02:02:41,511 --> 02:02:42,860
know he had a glass side.
Right.

2802
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:43,990
Something,
something real.

2803
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:49,460
His fight scenes in these early movies
were like the first realistic fight

2804
02:02:49,461 --> 02:02:53,540
scenes in a movie.
We're dude was like slapping guys arms

2805
02:02:53,541 --> 02:02:56,270
down and fucking knuckle on them in the
face.

2806
02:02:56,271 --> 02:02:57,990
It wasn't like these giant.
Yeah.

2807
02:02:58,220 --> 02:03:00,080
You know what I mean?
It was like more like that.

2808
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:03,560
It wasn't like it was first time we were
sorry Quito,

2809
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:07,280
but it was also,
it wasn't like like a giant flying split

2810
02:03:07,281 --> 02:03:09,600
kick.
We kicks two dudes at the same time.

2811
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:11,150
Yeah,
it was.

2812
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:14,780
It was more brutal than we'd ever seen
in movies before.

2813
02:03:15,260 --> 02:03:18,380
Like as far as like karate scenes,
it seemed more brutal and more

2814
02:03:18,381 --> 02:03:20,400
realistic.
Never saw Steve was a guy moving to

2815
02:03:20,420 --> 02:03:23,190
black movie theater,
but it wasn't that they go fight and

2816
02:03:23,191 --> 02:03:24,260
they cheer for white people.

2817
02:03:25,130 --> 02:03:29,240
Black people don't cheer for black
people or white people smacking the

2818
02:03:29,241 --> 02:03:31,040
fuck.
I saw two,

2819
02:03:31,460 --> 02:03:34,160
I saw the second rambling on the 78th
street in Harlem.

2820
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:37,430
It was one of the funniest things I had
ever won till this day.

2821
02:03:37,431 --> 02:03:40,820
I always said when he fucking comes and
when he opens his eyes and the mud.

2822
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:43,130
I remember that scene when he opens his
eyes.

2823
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:44,750
Yes,
the German guy,

2824
02:03:45,210 --> 02:03:49,400
black people went fucking bananas dog.
But then I had never seen nothing like

2825
02:03:49,401 --> 02:03:51,800
that.
I can't even imagine a Steven Seagal

2826
02:03:51,801 --> 02:03:54,470
movie other than 78th street back in the
day.

2827
02:03:54,860 --> 02:03:57,720
We missed the window.
The window was in like right,

2828
02:03:57,790 --> 02:04:00,470
right about above the law.
If you got in and above the law in the

2829
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:02,540
1980s and went to Harlem and watch
bubble,

2830
02:04:02,550 --> 02:04:04,010
ah,
I bet it would be one of the most

2831
02:04:04,011 --> 02:04:06,470
incredible experiences of your life.
Who Laugh your ass off.

2832
02:04:06,920 --> 02:04:11,810
I saw planting the fucking apes and
Philly and me and Tommy Jr and his girl.

2833
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:16,840
We went to a a theater in the middle of
filming and this was like a,

2834
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:21,020
when the UFC had the fights in Philly
and we got there like a day early.

2835
02:04:21,021 --> 02:04:23,450
We played pool and we got,
we got so high,

2836
02:04:23,451 --> 02:04:26,900
we were terrified of her own shadow and
then we went to this black neighborhood.

2837
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:29,990
It was the only way place that they had
that we didn't even know.

2838
02:04:29,991 --> 02:04:32,720
We didn't know it was like an urban
neighborhood until we got there.

2839
02:04:33,050 --> 02:04:34,280
But once we were in the theater,
we were like,

2840
02:04:34,281 --> 02:04:35,600
oh my God,
we're the only way people here.

2841
02:04:35,601 --> 02:04:37,140
There's like maybe like three other
white people.

2842
02:04:37,141 --> 02:04:39,450
We found each other,
we huddled together and then once the

2843
02:04:39,451 --> 02:04:41,280
movie theater,
but when we got in there,

2844
02:04:41,310 --> 02:04:42,900
it was hilarious,
man.

2845
02:04:43,410 --> 02:04:47,740
There's dudes who are artists at Yellen
shutout this dude.

2846
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:49,790
This dude's are artists.
It,

2847
02:04:50,010 --> 02:04:51,440
oh,
you fucked up now.

2848
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:54,720
Oh,
like I don't like it for the most part.

2849
02:04:54,721 --> 02:04:57,870
Like it's gotten bad at it.
It's gotta be funny.

2850
02:04:57,871 --> 02:04:59,040
If it's funny.
It's brilliant.

2851
02:04:59,060 --> 02:05:01,080
Yeah.
And some dudes try too hard.

2852
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:04,200
The worst is when there's a funny dude
and is not funny.

2853
02:05:04,201 --> 02:05:07,050
Friend is like fucking really loud.
He tries too hard.

2854
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:11,130
Like one dude say some funny shit and
then his other friends will chime in and

2855
02:05:11,131 --> 02:05:13,560
try to like top him and they can't.
They don't know.

2856
02:05:13,590 --> 02:05:14,790
They don't know.
They're not funny yet.

2857
02:05:15,510 --> 02:05:20,510
I saw Clint Eastwood Marathon in San
Francisco in the tenderloin when Clint

2858
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:24,810
Eastwood tells the guy to pick up the
gun and the black guy yelled from the

2859
02:05:24,811 --> 02:05:28,440
back shoots that black motherfucker,
the place went down.

2860
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:34,350
He just shoot that black
when the,

2861
02:05:36,691 --> 02:05:39,330
when a plant of the apes,
it's amazing.

2862
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:41,010
Did you see planet of the apes new one?

2863
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:44,520
He didn't say it this fucking good Joey.
It's fucking good.

2864
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:48,270
I enjoyed it.
I know you wouldn't go see the mechanic.

2865
02:05:48,630 --> 02:05:51,420
You wouldn't go see that was adjacent
stadium was Jason's see them once a

2866
02:05:51,421 --> 02:05:53,940
mechanic.
You wouldn't go see that out of respect

2867
02:05:53,941 --> 02:05:55,800
for Charles brought up whether it was on
television.

2868
02:05:55,801 --> 02:05:56,970
I caught the first time.
Minutes.

2869
02:05:56,971 --> 02:05:58,530
I mean that it's show time and I was
correct.

2870
02:05:58,860 --> 02:06:00,330
You're correct.
They blew it.

2871
02:06:00,550 --> 02:06:03,540
Well it wasn't as good.
But let me tell you something.

2872
02:06:03,541 --> 02:06:06,480
That dude who played the bad guy and due
to plate as apprentice,

2873
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:11,070
that mother fucker's wicked.
He was in that stupid vampire movie 30

2874
02:06:11,071 --> 02:06:12,630
days of night.
Did you ever see that movie?

2875
02:06:12,660 --> 02:06:14,070
No.
Good fucking movie.

2876
02:06:14,130 --> 02:06:15,560
He aint no jam.
Michael Vincent,

2877
02:06:15,580 --> 02:06:17,350
1970 right.
Dram,

2878
02:06:17,410 --> 02:06:20,250
Michael Tropics and Jan and Michael and
[inaudible] 73 he was,

2879
02:06:20,670 --> 02:06:24,210
he was taking his dick out on Wilshire
Boulevard and they will line up to

2880
02:06:24,211 --> 02:06:25,840
sunset the suck that blood.

2881
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:30,000
Especially after the movie.
He did not baby blue marine come on down

2882
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,740
and they put them with the ugliest man
in Hollywood,

2883
02:06:31,741 --> 02:06:34,050
Charles Bronson and he went crazy.
Right.

2884
02:06:34,110 --> 02:06:36,180
He goes crazy.
It looks like a fucking truck at him and

2885
02:06:36,200 --> 02:06:37,110
went nutty.
Yeah.

2886
02:06:37,111 --> 02:06:38,970
Poor guy.
He was a Malibu weed pills,

2887
02:06:38,971 --> 02:06:40,860
drinking cocktails.
Told people is a pilot.

2888
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,980
They say that that's the place to go if
you want to eat pills,

2889
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:45,790
if you want to be like a rich old
person,

2890
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:48,950
each pills mal beaus your spot like
everyone in Malibu.

2891
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:50,940
It was like,
you know there's like a,

2892
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:54,600
a bunch of refugees from Hollywood that
are older and just chewing pills now.

2893
02:06:54,890 --> 02:06:58,230
Like littered in between people who like
to jog and ride bikes.

2894
02:06:58,470 --> 02:07:01,110
There's like just people staring at the
ocean,

2895
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:02,820
just popping pills,
all that.

2896
02:07:02,821 --> 02:07:06,410
I don't the worst thing a month,
those pills but how long they stay in

2897
02:07:06,411 --> 02:07:10,200
your system and you know you don't feel
it while you're reading those things.

2898
02:07:10,590 --> 02:07:13,530
Not till you get off those things.
Like when you get a prescript you get a

2899
02:07:13,580 --> 02:07:17,280
knee surgery.
I feel bad because America doesn't

2900
02:07:17,281 --> 02:07:18,550
really know.
You didn't eat your viking.

2901
02:07:18,551 --> 02:07:20,100
It was after your surgeries.
No,

2902
02:07:20,101 --> 02:07:22,030
I don't like that stuff.
You'd rather take it out.

2903
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:24,750
I leave because you'll know.
You'll know what it does for you.

2904
02:07:24,751 --> 02:07:28,410
It destroys your system at each a pot,
your fucking stomach lining.

2905
02:07:28,590 --> 02:07:32,640
You got to eat tons of fucking yoga with
them pills or a slow fucking death in

2906
02:07:32,641 --> 02:07:35,620
this country and people have no idea.
Didn't front,

2907
02:07:35,621 --> 02:07:39,070
but I was never really an opiate guide.
Some vines I spotted some coke.

2908
02:07:39,071 --> 02:07:43,410
Forget the deck going gorilla biscuits,
but there's people.

2909
02:07:43,420 --> 02:07:44,680
He goes,
I like that thing.

2910
02:07:44,681 --> 02:07:48,460
You always talk about that Florida road
documentary about Florida,

2911
02:07:48,461 --> 02:07:51,390
the oxycontins fucking idea.
I told you dog,

2912
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,710
I did a 16th when the time my blood
pressure went up,

2913
02:07:53,711 --> 02:07:54,670
I had to lay down.

2914
02:07:55,210 --> 02:07:58,300
Those things are different.
That synthetic heroin ain't the best

2915
02:07:58,301 --> 02:08:01,030
thing in the world for you.
You might as well pull off the street

2916
02:08:01,031 --> 02:08:04,750
and do a little bump.
Synthetic heroin is made not to fucking

2917
02:08:04,751 --> 02:08:07,050
addict you,
but the fucking destroy.

2918
02:08:07,570 --> 02:08:08,800
You know?
It's like cocaine.

2919
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:13,650
It's like now I go to places I listen.
I really enjoy getting high uh,

2920
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:15,490
red band.
I really do.

2921
02:08:15,970 --> 02:08:19,140
But guess what?
When you show up with a fucking DAB and

2922
02:08:19,141 --> 02:08:21,490
a pipe and a fucking torture and shit
like that,

2923
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:25,300
it's time for you to stop.
Why does everybody always want to make

2924
02:08:25,301 --> 02:08:26,710
crack out of everyone?
I know.

2925
02:08:26,810 --> 02:08:29,500
First they did it to coke.
You just couldn't snort coke no more.

2926
02:08:29,710 --> 02:08:32,410
Now I've got to mix it with gasoline and
fucking toenails.

2927
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:35,440
Pulling a draw with paint and,
and smoke it.

2928
02:08:35,470 --> 02:08:35,891
No,
no,

2929
02:08:35,891 --> 02:08:37,060
no.
That's not strong enough.

2930
02:08:37,061 --> 02:08:39,700
But that's what people are always doing.
It's just amazing.

2931
02:08:39,701 --> 02:08:41,410
Now.
Only wants to stick into your ass.

2932
02:08:41,440 --> 02:08:43,960
Now you got a good point there.
At least a finger,

2933
02:08:43,961 --> 02:08:47,920
but now you know,
they got so much fucking weed stuff

2934
02:08:47,921 --> 02:08:51,310
coming at you and it's great.
But I still like rolling the fucking joy

2935
02:08:51,311 --> 02:08:53,380
like I'm done.
I still like all the,

2936
02:08:54,120 --> 02:08:55,650
you know what I like about Ron giant
man.

2937
02:08:55,651 --> 02:08:56,700
I like the,
the,

2938
02:08:56,780 --> 02:08:58,400
the like the Karma,
the energy.

2939
02:08:58,430 --> 02:09:01,290
It's Virginia.
It's like the paper.

2940
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,810
I wanted to say this celebration of it,
but it's not the celebration,

2941
02:09:03,811 --> 02:09:04,920
the ritual.
That's what I wanted.

2942
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,530
I was looking for.
I like the ritual of like here we got

2943
02:09:07,531 --> 02:09:09,870
like I'm preparing for it,
I'm getting it rolled up.

2944
02:09:10,060 --> 02:09:12,600
Smoked some right now in Florida.
Um,

2945
02:09:12,690 --> 02:09:15,690
this is the craziest statistic ever.
We've read it before but if you haven't

2946
02:09:15,691 --> 02:09:18,930
heard that podcast,
Florida prescribes 10 times more

2947
02:09:18,931 --> 02:09:22,020
oxycodone pills.
Then every other state in the country

2948
02:09:22,021 --> 02:09:25,940
combined
fucking eat.

2949
02:09:26,040 --> 02:09:28,980
Damn Z.
That's a scary,

2950
02:09:28,981 --> 02:09:31,110
scary thing that that those pills,

2951
02:09:31,200 --> 02:09:36,200
it's like taking over so strong at,
I had the blow concept to this now.

2952
02:09:37,230 --> 02:09:37,861
Dot.
Florida.

2953
02:09:37,861 --> 02:09:42,010
It's like so many oxy cottons everywhere
now you're adding blown away.

2954
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:45,000
Would it be cool if they had an APP to
show where people are sober?

2955
02:09:46,020 --> 02:09:47,310
If like your,
your APP.

2956
02:09:47,311 --> 02:09:50,630
Like if you hold your phone it tells you
if you're on heroin and just they,

2957
02:09:50,631 --> 02:09:52,650
you'll look,
I got a map like we were looking at that

2958
02:09:52,651 --> 02:09:54,600
porn map,
all the cream pies and all that chin.

2959
02:09:54,810 --> 02:09:57,750
Find out how,
what percentage of Florida is not on

2960
02:09:57,751 --> 02:09:59,610
pain pills right now.
Ready Go.

2961
02:09:59,700 --> 02:10:03,690
We are not hip enough,
but I guarantee that with three years

2962
02:10:03,691 --> 02:10:08,691
behind that there is somebody right now
moving kilos of cocaine online through

2963
02:10:09,031 --> 02:10:12,420
ups or whatever,
one of those systems and nobody even

2964
02:10:12,421 --> 02:10:14,580
knows and a delivery system.

2965
02:10:14,970 --> 02:10:16,740
Well,
you know about Silk Road if you're heard

2966
02:10:16,741 --> 02:10:19,370
about solar on about nothing,
but I'm just saying that there's gotta

2967
02:10:19,380 --> 02:10:20,970
be somebody who's selling coke on
Twitter.

2968
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:22,530
Well,
there was an article about it.

2969
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:24,540
Um,
there's an article about a website that

2970
02:10:24,570 --> 02:10:29,570
somehow or another is able to transact
elicit deals and people sin poop

2971
02:10:30,151 --> 02:10:31,980
senders.
If you want to buy any pip,

2972
02:10:31,981 --> 02:10:34,100
they got gorilla poop.
Turgor cow poop.

2973
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,540
Elephant crap.
Gorilla pit.

2974
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:39,320
Why would anybody want to buy a poop was
look up.

2975
02:10:39,321 --> 02:10:42,090
See if there's a,
what does that Silk Road thing that's,

2976
02:10:42,091 --> 02:10:43,600
that's the thing that everybody you're
talking to.

2977
02:10:43,601 --> 02:10:44,434
Can't look it up.

2978
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,290
Don't talk about it or whatever.
It's too late.

2979
02:10:48,440 --> 02:10:50,240
If people know about it,
the government knows about it.

2980
02:10:50,570 --> 02:10:52,640
It's all over the news bed bath and
beyond.com.

2981
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:54,080
Yeah,
just something like that.

2982
02:10:54,350 --> 02:10:55,183
But they're,
um,

2983
02:10:55,190 --> 02:10:57,680
there's ways that people are doing it
where they're,

2984
02:10:57,700 --> 02:10:59,810
they're figuring out how to put,
I mean,

2985
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:01,040
how long are they gonna be able to do
that?

2986
02:11:01,041 --> 02:11:04,010
And then what happens if somehow in the
future,

2987
02:11:04,270 --> 02:11:06,500
you know,
they can go back retroactively and like

2988
02:11:06,501 --> 02:11:09,350
look up the database.
So who bought heroin or whatever through

2989
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:12,980
this fucking crazy website?
Of course.

2990
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,000
No,
you wouldn't believe me.

2991
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:17,560
Anybody who's going to buy heroin
online,

2992
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:20,690
there's going to be a little crafty.
If you got to hide your name,

2993
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,940
it's going to be a comment or on
youtube,

2994
02:11:22,970 --> 02:11:25,740
you're not going to go on there as Joey
Diaz and say crazy shit about Taylor

2995
02:11:25,741 --> 02:11:27,070
swift.
If you've got a,

2996
02:11:27,140 --> 02:11:30,530
if you have a,
if you have a match and you know,

2997
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:31,450
you have,
uh,

2998
02:11:31,730 --> 02:11:32,830
you know,
I think you,

2999
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:36,530
you controlling your heroin use,
you could quick a fucking switch and 20

3000
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:38,930
minutes later some guy delivers it to
your door that,

3001
02:11:38,931 --> 02:11:40,130
you know,
you know them.

3002
02:11:40,610 --> 02:11:42,680
But this is the new way.
You don't even have to pay a no more.

3003
02:11:42,770 --> 02:11:46,430
It seems like once there's a desire for
something,

3004
02:11:46,490 --> 02:11:50,240
it's impossible to stop people from
figuring out a way to get it to people,

3005
02:11:50,540 --> 02:11:55,430
especially if it's illegal and it only
makes sense that they'd be using the

3006
02:11:55,431 --> 02:11:56,390
Internet.
Right.

3007
02:11:56,570 --> 02:11:58,280
It's brilliant.
It is brilliant.

3008
02:11:58,340 --> 02:12:00,440
It's brilliant.
There's no way else.

3009
02:12:00,740 --> 02:12:02,990
I mean,
it's going to happen,

3010
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:03,531
right?
I mean,

3011
02:12:03,531 --> 02:12:05,120
it's not like anybody's going to hide
that shit.

3012
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:07,970
Speak speaking to Haydn.
That shit.

3013
02:12:08,330 --> 02:12:11,690
Listen to this.
There was a dude in China that got

3014
02:12:11,691 --> 02:12:13,100
arrested.
He,

3015
02:12:13,101 --> 02:12:16,850
uh,
he went to jail and because he convinced

3016
02:12:16,851 --> 02:12:21,440
a girl that she,
her vagina was haunted and that he had

3017
02:12:21,441 --> 02:12:25,580
to get rid of the ghost with his penis.
So they arrested him for this.

3018
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:31,160
They arrested him after he claimed that
he get rid of it.

3019
02:12:31,280 --> 02:12:35,300
The paranormal enthusiasts allegedly
charge 3000,

3020
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:40,301
$250 to perform the sex or CISM.
What a brilliant man.

3021
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:41,270
Come on,
man.

3022
02:12:41,270 --> 02:12:44,530
That dude is a pimp and you're hating
your hating on that guy.

3023
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:47,930
Fuck.
Are you talk a walker?

3024
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:53,620
There's a ghost in a monkey fucking
genius and you got to solve your cock

3025
02:12:53,850 --> 02:12:56,260
and she's got to give him money.
That's great.

3026
02:12:56,261 --> 02:12:59,940
I guess it's a brilliant even fuck up,
but give him money to bless you with

3027
02:12:59,941 --> 02:13:01,580
this girl.
Look like there's gotta be a picture of

3028
02:13:01,581 --> 02:13:04,040
this dummy.
Not so far.

3029
02:13:04,490 --> 02:13:06,350
I don't really want to see a picture.
I'll be sad.

3030
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:11,360
Poor Gal,
his name was Wang.

3031
02:13:11,550 --> 02:13:14,120
Gi Won.
Brilliant.

3032
02:13:14,450 --> 02:13:17,060
Huang h.
U.

3033
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:17,060
A.
N.

3034
02:13:17,060 --> 02:13:17,061
G.
G.

3035
02:13:17,061 --> 02:13:20,240
I a grammar school dog.
It was that little train just doing the

3036
02:13:20,241 --> 02:13:22,790
back that got fucking days.
There will be through fucking paperclip

3037
02:13:22,840 --> 02:13:23,631
said,
look,

3038
02:13:23,631 --> 02:13:26,480
he's a gangster.
He's getting his dick sucked and getting

3039
02:13:26,481 --> 02:13:28,820
paid.
There really is funny,

3040
02:13:28,821 --> 02:13:30,110
man.
That is classic.

3041
02:13:30,140 --> 02:13:32,190
That's classic type Shit.
He explained the ghosts

3042
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:35,610
in her vagina were preventing her boss
from falling in love with her.

3043
02:13:36,300 --> 02:13:38,070
Oh my God.
Check this.

3044
02:13:40,710 --> 02:13:44,520
So she must've come to him and said,
I want my boss to fall in love with me.

3045
02:13:44,970 --> 02:13:47,070
And so,
so she was a conniver man.

3046
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:52,071
So he convinced her because the ghosts
in her vagina were preventing her boss

3047
02:13:53,581 --> 02:13:57,300
from falling in love with her.
Holy Shit ghost that he could easily

3048
02:13:57,301 --> 02:14:02,250
catch with his penis.
Did you fucking arrest that guy?

3049
02:14:02,850 --> 02:14:05,790
Come on man,
because they don't have high five there.

3050
02:14:06,180 --> 02:14:09,570
That's rude.
Arresting this guy for that is rude.

3051
02:14:09,740 --> 02:14:11,490
You should be able to go to the Cota
court.

3052
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:12,750
And he said,
well your honor,

3053
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:16,320
what I told her was that her vagina was
haunted and uh,

3054
02:14:16,321 --> 02:14:20,370
the only way she's going to be able to
steal her boss away from his wife is uh,

3055
02:14:20,790 --> 02:14:22,950
if uh,
she let me fuck her and catch the goes

3056
02:14:22,951 --> 02:14:24,690
with my tech,
get the fuck out of my court.

3057
02:14:27,070 --> 02:14:29,880
You'd be like,
get your lunchbox and get the fuck out.

3058
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:34,280
You wanted to sue him for what you,
you,

3059
02:14:34,330 --> 02:14:36,450
you thought that was true?
He thought really he was going to get

3060
02:14:36,451 --> 02:14:37,830
the,
the ghost out with his Dick.

3061
02:14:39,380 --> 02:14:41,430
Get the fuck out my car while the cops
and tell them,

3062
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:44,390
listen,
I got arrested guy.

3063
02:14:44,870 --> 02:14:48,010
He stuck his Dick in my fucking whatever
ghost in there.

3064
02:14:48,110 --> 02:14:50,690
Okay.
If fucking Julie lied to me any time,

3065
02:14:50,810 --> 02:14:53,330
I guess it's the money.
It was the 3000,

3066
02:14:53,331 --> 02:14:55,460
250 bucks.
If they had a problem with it,

3067
02:14:55,940 --> 02:14:57,770
but meanwhile,
how can they prove it?

3068
02:14:59,150 --> 02:15:00,460
She probably wrote a check.
Oh,

3069
02:15:00,530 --> 02:15:02,210
how can they prove it?
How can they prove that he didn't get

3070
02:15:02,211 --> 02:15:04,930
the ghost out?
Smell it.

3071
02:15:05,710 --> 02:15:06,543
ECTOPLASM

3072
02:15:08,410 --> 02:15:12,050
smell it.
Smell.

3073
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:15,370
If it smells like it could be rigged
game though.

3074
02:15:15,371 --> 02:15:17,530
She waits right to you starting.
She farted in your face.

3075
02:15:19,690 --> 02:15:21,430
It's a fucking crazy world out there
though.

3076
02:15:21,431 --> 02:15:23,650
You can follow people and Patty thing.
Well,

3077
02:15:23,651 --> 02:15:27,570
you can definitely talk some people into
almost anything into anything.

3078
02:15:28,910 --> 02:15:33,910
Go to a farmer's market on a Sunday.
Just any of those low Kenyan farmers

3079
02:15:34,370 --> 02:15:36,850
just stay in the back.
There's always go to burning man.

3080
02:15:37,190 --> 02:15:39,070
Oh,
they got the hat on the whole fucking

3081
02:15:39,071 --> 02:15:39,904
thing.
How many people,

3082
02:15:40,370 --> 02:15:43,090
how many people do you think you'd talk
at a joint called if you went to burning

3083
02:15:43,091 --> 02:15:43,924
man?
Three

3084
02:15:45,490 --> 02:15:46,680
you could ask for three.

3085
02:15:48,790 --> 02:15:51,610
I gotta have a plan.
I got to have a plant when it takes

3086
02:15:51,611 --> 02:15:53,080
them.
You know why?

3087
02:15:53,081 --> 02:15:56,690
The reason why they have to suck your
dick to drink from the anointing of the

3088
02:15:56,691 --> 02:15:57,670
sick,
the whole thing.

3089
02:15:57,671 --> 02:15:58,504
They gotta,
you know,

3090
02:15:58,720 --> 02:15:59,830
you gotta,
you gotta have a plan.

3091
02:16:00,130 --> 02:16:03,460
You just can't go to burning man and
drop knowledge on bitches.

3092
02:16:03,461 --> 02:16:05,980
You gotta have a plan.
You have to have a little bit of a plan.

3093
02:16:05,981 --> 02:16:07,720
But then from there you can make it up
as you go along.

3094
02:16:07,870 --> 02:16:11,590
And it's tremendous because you could
get a soldier and his girlfriend and

3095
02:16:11,591 --> 02:16:14,340
then his girlfriend.
Then you recruit two chicks and so

3096
02:16:14,341 --> 02:16:16,890
mother fucking Momo and you're off and
running somebody.

3097
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,820
One of those idiots is a trust fund
baby.

3098
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:20,470
It leaks with talking,
listening.

3099
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:21,700
Well,
can you get from your dad?

3100
02:16:21,701 --> 02:16:23,050
Well,
he's such a pig.

3101
02:16:23,410 --> 02:16:26,080
You know,
he makes condoms and cigarettes and he

3102
02:16:26,081 --> 02:16:26,914
sells.

3103
02:16:28,340 --> 02:16:31,450
He's an asshole.
You could probably get 10,000 okay,

3104
02:16:31,460 --> 02:16:33,780
get 10,000 and they'll go,
yeah.

3105
02:16:33,781 --> 02:16:35,350
When a,
how many of those people like pretend

3106
02:16:35,360 --> 02:16:37,720
play kidnapped so that their dad is to
send money,

3107
02:16:37,930 --> 02:16:40,000
Bro.
I lived in boulder and I remember kids

3108
02:16:40,001 --> 02:16:41,140
coming to me and going,
listen,

3109
02:16:41,141 --> 02:16:43,830
give me a week.
I've got to come up with 7,500 from my,

3110
02:16:43,870 --> 02:16:47,130
I remember them saying they'd worked at
that the,

3111
02:16:47,140 --> 02:16:50,620
and then they'd walk around poor telling
people that pour and my God,

3112
02:16:50,621 --> 02:16:54,490
this is so hard living in boulder.
Meanwhile the driving a fucking Volvo

3113
02:16:54,491 --> 02:16:56,280
when an air bag the whole fucking deal.

3114
02:16:56,430 --> 02:16:59,760
Why not dude is really rich who drives
like beat up cars because he grew up

3115
02:16:59,761 --> 02:17:00,320
rich.
Yeah.

3116
02:17:00,320 --> 02:17:03,150
And he like,
he like has a pickup truck so he drives

3117
02:17:03,151 --> 02:17:05,710
a pickup truck on purpose.
Like he wants to thank and he's like as

3118
02:17:05,740 --> 02:17:07,260
a country guy.
Yeah.

3119
02:17:07,330 --> 02:17:08,920
Well you know,
I'm just trying to make it in this here

3120
02:17:08,921 --> 02:17:11,430
a big city.
If they're not millionaires,

3121
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:15,690
well you've got to be scared of those
are the people you got to be scared of.

3122
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:18,120
Well I think someone growing up in that
kind of environment,

3123
02:17:18,121 --> 02:17:19,830
if you,
if you grew up with like,

3124
02:17:20,880 --> 02:17:25,880
I mean name the name,
super rich multibillionaire parents

3125
02:17:26,190 --> 02:17:29,700
living on yachts and you know,
flying away to boarding school like

3126
02:17:29,701 --> 02:17:31,650
your,
your reality is so bizarre.

3127
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:35,160
Like your reality of like the potential
of your future if you grow up and your

3128
02:17:35,161 --> 02:17:38,400
parents are weapons manufacturers and
your parents have an island off of

3129
02:17:38,401 --> 02:17:41,670
Greece and you know,
and the dad flies out there in a g five

3130
02:17:41,910 --> 02:17:44,250
and they're,
they're selling machine guns of Saudi

3131
02:17:44,250 --> 02:17:45,750
Arabia.
Like do breakfast at the presidents

3132
02:17:45,751 --> 02:17:48,750
house.
You'd do breakfast at fucking Clintons

3133
02:17:48,810 --> 02:17:52,590
and you shoot your guns with Clinton and
Bush comes over and he brings some way,

3134
02:17:52,610 --> 02:17:54,750
tie it up and you shoot him Bro.
That's,

3135
02:17:56,100 --> 02:18:00,090
I can't even fucking imagine.
I can't even fathom that you know,

3136
02:18:00,091 --> 02:18:01,430
being that,
but just take away,

3137
02:18:01,500 --> 02:18:02,040
yeah,
you're right.

3138
02:18:02,040 --> 02:18:05,490
You're why been there Joey Diaz,
I know you have Bohemian Grove.

3139
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,770
I filmed them worshiping more like the
Owl God.

3140
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:13,170
Have you seen that video that he did
know?

3141
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:16,890
He did a video of him live from Bohemian
Grove is like Alex Jones is one of his

3142
02:18:16,891 --> 02:18:18,630
first videos.
They really do.

3143
02:18:18,631 --> 02:18:21,300
He's right.
They really do have like a ritual that

3144
02:18:21,301 --> 02:18:24,240
they do there if you find it online,
but I guarantee it's up there.

3145
02:18:24,241 --> 02:18:26,320
Alex Jones live and Bohemian Grove.
They,

3146
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,330
they,
they find,

3147
02:18:27,360 --> 02:18:31,860
he goes there and these dudes there in
front of this gigantic stone owl and

3148
02:18:31,861 --> 02:18:35,190
they have the sticks and they say
they're going to burn the sticks like

3149
02:18:35,191 --> 02:18:37,710
it's an effigy.
I guess the idea behind that is the

3150
02:18:37,711 --> 02:18:40,680
sticks are supposed to represent a
sacrifice and in the old days they

3151
02:18:40,681 --> 02:18:42,750
actually used to take a person and light
them on fire.

3152
02:18:43,080 --> 02:18:44,760
This is Alex Jones.
He's much younger.

3153
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:49,130
I was their least gentlemen hiding in
the bushes watching this site,

3154
02:18:49,131 --> 02:18:52,560
tannic ritual take place with your tax
dollars.

3155
02:18:53,520 --> 02:18:57,480
These dudes were put on robes and they
go out there with torches that that's

3156
02:18:57,481 --> 02:18:59,450
eyes wide shut.
That's the sound shit.

3157
02:19:00,570 --> 02:19:01,380
Don't,
don't,

3158
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,630
don't fuck with the music or the sound
rather

3159
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:05,993
useless.

3160
02:19:06,270 --> 02:19:07,103
Fine.

3161
02:19:18,310 --> 02:19:20,170
Now come on.
This is crazy.

3162
02:19:20,230 --> 02:19:22,480
This is fucking beyond crazy cause this
is real.

3163
02:19:23,580 --> 02:19:25,540
This is in wonder.
Alex Jones is so crazy.

3164
02:19:25,690 --> 02:19:29,090
If you went there live and you saw this,
you would believe that anything is

3165
02:19:29,091 --> 02:19:31,340
possible.
If there's some dude to have a bundle of

3166
02:19:31,341 --> 02:19:34,400
sticks and is there a woman that they're
pretending that they're going to

3167
02:19:34,401 --> 02:19:35,840
sacrifice?
Is that the idea?

3168
02:19:36,260 --> 02:19:37,400
Is there a woman who's like

3169
02:19:37,830 --> 02:19:41,490
tied up there?
I wish I knew the whole story.

3170
02:19:43,650 --> 02:19:46,030
See,
it looks like they got like a person

3171
02:19:46,031 --> 02:19:47,580
that they're going to pretend to
sacrifice them.

3172
02:19:47,581 --> 02:19:51,120
They burn these sticks
and it's like,

3173
02:19:51,121 --> 02:19:54,330
what?
Like just just knowing that that's real.

3174
02:19:55,020 --> 02:19:57,020
This is in Texas.
I Dunno.

3175
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,400
It seems like it would be.
Let's look it up.

3176
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:00,890
Bohemian Grove.
Hold on.

3177
02:20:00,891 --> 02:20:04,390
Let's do the soundtrack is amazing.
It's so tracking that Friday.

3178
02:20:04,391 --> 02:20:05,260
It was for this.

3179
02:20:09,910 --> 02:20:11,400
No,
it's in California.

3180
02:20:12,250 --> 02:20:13,660
Oh my God.
That makes sense.

3181
02:20:13,661 --> 02:20:14,540
So southern though,

3182
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:15,720
you're like,
nope.

3183
02:20:17,320 --> 02:20:19,070
Did it.
It sounded,

3184
02:20:19,170 --> 02:20:20,360
you know,
where'd this happen?

3185
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:23,170
Angeles.
Avoid this fucking neighborhood with

3186
02:20:23,171 --> 02:20:25,630
this APP.
I slide failure right somewhere in

3187
02:20:25,631 --> 02:20:28,600
northern cal pass Visalia before San
Francisco.

3188
02:20:28,601 --> 02:20:32,770
You'll kill it.
You pull over for a Taco that done Alex

3189
02:20:32,770 --> 02:20:35,110
Jones,
you Bohemian Grove live famous footage.

3190
02:20:35,111 --> 02:20:38,320
This is what tuned me into the
Illuminati Ladies Gentlemen.

3191
02:20:38,321 --> 02:20:42,130
There was a dark time before that where
they hid in the shadows.

3192
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:45,440
Wow.
This is real.

3193
02:20:46,100 --> 02:20:47,960
That's so strange.
I mean,

3194
02:20:47,961 --> 02:20:50,150
even if it's just for a goof and people
go,

3195
02:20:50,151 --> 02:20:52,610
oh,
you're just misconstruing what's going

3196
02:20:52,611 --> 02:20:53,421
on there,
there,

3197
02:20:53,421 --> 02:20:54,254
there,
there the,

3198
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:59,290
the ideas just for fun.
What kind of an asshole stands around in

3199
02:20:59,511 --> 02:21:01,940
a robe waiting for all this stupid shit
to take place.

3200
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:04,280
Like this is taking place for over like
15,

3201
02:21:04,281 --> 02:21:06,800
20 minutes and they're all in order.
Leaf line,

3202
02:21:07,040 --> 02:21:10,010
like waiting on this in this very weird
ritual.

3203
02:21:10,190 --> 02:21:11,840
Like who would want to participate in
this?

3204
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:17,960
So the idea is that a,
there's a Washington Post article about

3205
02:21:17,961 --> 02:21:19,880
it had better music,
it'd be cool.

3206
02:21:20,780 --> 02:21:23,420
I mean like look at that as I'm going to
fire people dressed up.

3207
02:21:23,910 --> 02:21:25,910
There's not even moving,
it's not like they're dancing.

3208
02:21:26,180 --> 02:21:28,250
Like what if they had great music and
then just standing still.

3209
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:32,930
See that's much better.
Does kind of get us pulled from Youtube.

3210
02:21:33,410 --> 02:21:35,560
You fuck the digital signatures,
goddammit.

3211
02:21:36,660 --> 02:21:39,560
Oh yeah.
So there's an article here in the

3212
02:21:39,561 --> 02:21:42,310
Washington Post about this Bohemian
Grove thing and uh,

3213
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:45,590
these guys are standing around these
gigantic redwood trees and shit.

3214
02:21:45,591 --> 02:21:47,750
And there are all these like really
super rich guys.

3215
02:21:48,140 --> 02:21:52,130
It says two folk future US presidents,
Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon are

3216
02:21:52,131 --> 02:21:57,131
pictured with Harvey Hancock.
Not to be confused with Herbie Hancock

3217
02:21:57,890 --> 02:21:59,300
or herb.
Was that the guy,

3218
02:21:59,330 --> 02:22:00,170
the love bug?
No,

3219
02:22:00,440 --> 02:22:02,930
Herbie Hancock was the a musician,
right.

3220
02:22:03,530 --> 02:22:07,670
Harvey Hancock Standing and others at
the Bohemian Grove in the summer of

3221
02:22:07,671 --> 02:22:09,440
1967.
Wow.

3222
02:22:09,490 --> 02:22:12,290
It's amazing.
Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon,

3223
02:22:12,350 --> 02:22:15,530
check this out.
Nixon said in his Watergate tapes,

3224
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:17,810
he said,
if I were to choose the speech that gave

3225
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:20,300
me the most pleasure and satisfaction in
my political career,

3226
02:22:20,301 --> 02:22:25,190
it would be the leg speech chip.
The Bohemian Grove in six 1967 is this

3227
02:22:25,230 --> 02:22:26,280
speech traditionally

3228
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:28,800
was off the record and receive no
publicity at the time.

3229
02:22:29,180 --> 02:22:32,670
Uh,
but then he said that the Bahamian Grove

3230
02:22:32,671 --> 02:22:36,270
that I attended from time to time,
the easterners and the other came there

3231
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:39,330
and it became the most faggy God damn
thing I've ever,

3232
02:22:39,450 --> 02:22:44,450
you could ever imagine.
Richard Nixon Nixon said that San

3233
02:22:44,970 --> 02:22:46,980
Francisco crowd that goes there,
it's just terrible.

3234
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:49,020
I mean,
I won't shake hands with anybody from

3235
02:22:49,021 --> 02:22:49,920
San Francisco.

3236
02:22:50,300 --> 02:22:54,060
Nixon said that
terrible human being.

3237
02:22:55,530 --> 02:22:59,130
Look at this picture of uh,
this,

3238
02:22:59,131 --> 02:23:01,020
uh,
this photo of um,

3239
02:23:01,140 --> 02:23:04,560
Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon talking
to this or this guy.

3240
02:23:04,740 --> 02:23:08,930
It's really strange.
Like they really do have a place where

3241
02:23:08,940 --> 02:23:13,940
like these old rich elite guys get
together and sit down and talk about

3242
02:23:15,811 --> 02:23:17,880
shit.
Like they really did have places like

3243
02:23:17,881 --> 02:23:21,280
that where they would meet up and these
special locations like that.

3244
02:23:21,330 --> 02:23:24,900
That idea has always been like this
wacky conspiracy theory thing that the

3245
02:23:24,901 --> 02:23:27,300
elites get together and they meet and
they wear robes.

3246
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:30,420
But no,
they're fucking really do like look at

3247
02:23:30,430 --> 02:23:34,050
that look,
they're hanging around in the forest and

3248
02:23:34,110 --> 02:23:35,880
Nixon and Ronald Reagan and their with
their,

3249
02:23:35,881 --> 02:23:40,881
their dinner jackets on Colonel Sanders
and couple of it looks like John Wayne

3250
02:23:41,281 --> 02:23:42,780
the far lower right,
doesn't it?

3251
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:46,290
Yeah,
it looks like a little John Wayne Ish.

3252
02:23:47,770 --> 02:23:51,030
Weird.
All dudes so strange.

3253
02:23:52,110 --> 02:23:53,970
Well it's going to be like,
dude,

3254
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:56,040
not one course on,
it's going to be like,

3255
02:23:56,041 --> 02:23:57,810
well,
long after these guys are gone,

3256
02:23:57,811 --> 02:23:58,351
like law.
I mean,

3257
02:23:58,351 --> 02:24:00,360
obviously Reagan and Nixon are both gone
now,

3258
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:03,300
but I mean like long,
long after anybody who's alive now in

3259
02:24:03,301 --> 02:24:06,240
the future we're going to have like a,
just a sort of a whisper of what

3260
02:24:06,241 --> 02:24:07,280
happened there,
right?

3261
02:24:07,550 --> 02:24:08,990
Know something's going to find the
letter,

3262
02:24:08,991 --> 02:24:13,020
which has gotta be proof of picture,
a photograph of something.

3263
02:24:13,021 --> 02:24:14,760
Someone's going to write some crazy shit
down.

3264
02:24:14,930 --> 02:24:18,390
Chick wasn't that picture of 1957 she
was never seen that to that.

3265
02:24:18,391 --> 02:24:21,670
Not to Wayne,
an attic somewhere and I'll be here.

3266
02:24:21,671 --> 02:24:26,671
So 2,708 Acre compound,
2000 skews me.

3267
02:24:26,941 --> 02:24:31,941
It's 2,700 Acre compound in Monte Rio,
California for two weeks of heavy

3268
02:24:32,401 --> 02:24:35,760
drinking super secret talks,
druid worship.

3269
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:41,460
The group insists that they're simply
revering the redwoods and other rituals,

3270
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:46,740
their purpose to escape the frontier
culture or uncivilized interest of

3271
02:24:46,741 --> 02:24:49,440
common man.
Wow.

3272
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:51,780
This is the fucking Washington Post
wrote this.

3273
02:24:52,770 --> 02:24:56,070
The people that gather at Bohemian Grove
who've included prominent business

3274
02:24:56,071 --> 02:24:57,740
leaders,
former US presidents,

3275
02:24:57,750 --> 02:25:02,340
musicians and oil barons are told that
weaving spiders come not here,

3276
02:25:02,341 --> 02:25:05,100
meaning that business deals are to be
left outside.

3277
02:25:06,930 --> 02:25:11,160
One exception was in 1942 when planning
for the Manhattan project took place at

3278
02:25:11,161 --> 02:25:14,130
the grove leading to the creation of the
atomic bomb.

3279
02:25:15,160 --> 02:25:18,480
God Damn Joey Diaz at answer me this
truthfully.

3280
02:25:18,600 --> 02:25:21,030
How hard that edible kick in about 15
minutes ago.

3281
02:25:21,650 --> 02:25:23,290
I have no idea.
He thinks you're talking about

3282
02:25:23,290 --> 02:25:26,680
Bohemian rhapsody got to a certain point
where I saw him checkout.

3283
02:25:27,160 --> 02:25:29,650
I saw his eyes roll back and I'm like,
oh,

3284
02:25:29,651 --> 02:25:30,870
okay.
I'm good.

3285
02:25:31,140 --> 02:25:33,480
I've been good,
but Chiba chew that cheat sheet.

3286
02:25:33,890 --> 02:25:36,690
The deep waters.
What's the 70 what?

3287
02:25:36,750 --> 02:25:38,230
What does that really,
really ground with the pain?

3288
02:25:38,231 --> 02:25:41,860
I took those 70 milligrams.
What does a normal dose?

3289
02:25:41,950 --> 02:25:46,950
It's like 02030707175 is the Deca one 75
one 75 the one that makes people fucking

3290
02:25:52,811 --> 02:25:54,340
cringe.
That's scary,

3291
02:25:54,341 --> 02:25:55,390
right?
That's a scary one.

3292
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:57,790
That's too scary.
That's a little too real.

3293
02:25:57,940 --> 02:25:59,770
You're making me an hour's becomes too
real.

3294
02:26:00,670 --> 02:26:03,490
I saw that movie trailer that was pulled
that you were in.

3295
02:26:03,860 --> 02:26:04,990
It looked really good.
Actually.

3296
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:07,100
I pulled everything.
He had a great line in it.

3297
02:26:09,040 --> 02:26:11,230
I'm not going to say what it is.
What are you talking about?

3298
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:15,910
Joey d is in this picture.
What are you talking about from movie

3299
02:26:15,930 --> 02:26:16,763
deal?

3300
02:26:17,470 --> 02:26:18,550
They put up,
what is it?

3301
02:26:18,551 --> 02:26:21,340
Took it down their road movie.
Why they took it down?

3302
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:23,140
I have no idea.
One of the rose took it though,

3303
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,660
but they put it up there was somebody
else put it up.

3304
02:26:25,690 --> 02:26:28,450
I don't know if it's a leaked a trailer.
Oh,

3305
02:26:28,451 --> 02:26:30,040
how do you leak a trailer?
Uh,

3306
02:26:30,041 --> 02:26:33,280
somebody that's paid to edit it and gets
paid $10 an hour and he just puts it

3307
02:26:33,281 --> 02:26:36,490
online or something like that.
So he made his own trailer.

3308
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:39,970
It's amazing how he gets paid to do it
and he's probably at home sitting in

3309
02:26:39,971 --> 02:26:40,804
Burbank.

3310
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:44,620
The story,
it's something fucking unique when like

3311
02:26:44,660 --> 02:26:48,770
the high level people who robbed those
movies that don't rob the movie from the

3312
02:26:48,771 --> 02:26:50,840
movie theater with the camera no more.
No,

3313
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:54,080
they robbed him.
They tap into Warner brothers or Fox.

3314
02:26:54,820 --> 02:26:57,560
They all Shoney.
They tapped him like the week before the

3315
02:26:57,561 --> 02:27:00,890
movie gets released or a month before it
gets released.

3316
02:27:01,250 --> 02:27:03,110
They take the movie out,
it's backwards.

3317
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:06,740
It traveled backwards.
They have to unwind it,

3318
02:27:06,810 --> 02:27:08,520
whatever.
Boom.

3319
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:10,530
Back in business.
Is that what they do?

3320
02:27:10,531 --> 02:27:15,531
So they did LTP sites.
Veit is out before the movie's out.

3321
02:27:17,170 --> 02:27:19,070
Yeah.
The movies in this country come out

3322
02:27:19,071 --> 02:27:20,990
three days before you go see him on
Friday.

3323
02:27:21,050 --> 02:27:23,730
Some of them do.
If you go into any big market and

3324
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:28,580
Detroit and New York with fucking this
bad ass motherfuckers Tuesday you could

3325
02:27:28,581 --> 02:27:30,800
get,
you could get whatever movie you want

3326
02:27:30,980 --> 02:27:33,290
even though the movie's not coming out
til Friday.

3327
02:27:33,350 --> 02:27:35,780
Do you remember when you used to be able
to buy them on the street?

3328
02:27:35,830 --> 02:27:37,400
Right.
And they were these VHS tape op

3329
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:40,670
politics.
They had a cover that was a copy of the

3330
02:27:40,671 --> 02:27:43,910
real cover and it was like obviously
like a printer piece of Pr,

3331
02:27:43,940 --> 02:27:46,310
you know,
like a common computer printer copy.

3332
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:50,360
I made good,
maybe allegedly made great money selling

3333
02:27:50,840 --> 02:27:53,180
pop fiction,
a bootlegs on campus.

3334
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:55,820
I've never bought a fucking illegal
film.

3335
02:27:56,510 --> 02:27:58,460
I was always scared to stop for those
things,

3336
02:27:59,500 --> 02:28:03,200
especially in New York City.
I was always just don't stop just

3337
02:28:03,260 --> 02:28:05,750
sketching out a whole fucking problem.
You know?

3338
02:28:05,751 --> 02:28:07,670
It's a lot of times I bought them and
they were empty.

3339
02:28:07,730 --> 02:28:12,730
There was nothing there.
I knew guys in the 70s taking boxes like

3340
02:28:12,831 --> 02:28:17,230
crazy Eddie and putting fucking bricks
in them and wrapping them at home and

3341
02:28:17,270 --> 02:28:19,370
they're in a corner and also can you
pull up and you're like,

3342
02:28:19,371 --> 02:28:20,000
what do you got?

3343
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:20,860
And they're like,
speakers,

3344
02:28:20,870 --> 02:28:24,170
$50 at 200 of the event,
you're not going to unwrap them.

3345
02:28:24,200 --> 02:28:24,940
They're wrapped,
you know,

3346
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:26,900
put them in your car.
You're going to get to fucking bricks.

3347
02:28:27,200 --> 02:28:28,220
Yeah.
That was real common.

3348
02:28:28,410 --> 02:28:31,070
The pulling up and asking you if you
want to buy some stereotypes.

3349
02:28:31,790 --> 02:28:32,930
We had some extras.
Yeah.

3350
02:28:32,931 --> 02:28:35,090
I don't want nothing.
I don't want nothing to go keep driving.

3351
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:37,340
You know?
They had that crazy Eddie's story.

3352
02:28:37,341 --> 02:28:39,470
That was brilliant.
It's a weird thing about urban

3353
02:28:39,471 --> 02:28:40,340
environments,
isn't it?

3354
02:28:40,380 --> 02:28:41,940
Yeah,
you can always,

3355
02:28:42,060 --> 02:28:43,860
it's always a scam.
It's getting rough.

3356
02:28:43,880 --> 02:28:46,400
But I knew that was one point where the
scam went south.

3357
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:49,850
There was one point where I heard you
hear shit that people were selling

3358
02:28:49,851 --> 02:28:51,980
thermostats and the glass is broken,
you know,

3359
02:28:52,370 --> 02:28:53,390
and then you just say,
fuck it.

3360
02:28:53,660 --> 02:28:57,920
Why even started going,
I might get a great deal or I might get

3361
02:28:57,921 --> 02:28:58,410
bullshit.

3362
02:28:58,410 --> 02:29:01,850
I got to go back and looking for the
fucking guy in the next day for $8 is it

3363
02:29:01,851 --> 02:29:03,350
really worth the aggravation?
You know?

3364
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:07,850
But I remember going back to New York in
[inaudible] 94 after I got divorced and

3365
02:29:07,940 --> 02:29:11,720
a friend of mine goes,
I got a job selling cars.

3366
02:29:11,721 --> 02:29:12,380
I need it.
Then he goes,

3367
02:29:12,380 --> 02:29:14,270
how much money?
You ain't got to go about 600 bucks.

3368
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:15,890
He took me to a building,
Bro.

3369
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:20,150
He took me to a building in Harlem at
the top two floors.

3370
02:29:20,151 --> 02:29:23,170
But like going into the gap.
Wow.

3371
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:25,850
And the,
the original clothes were on there with

3372
02:29:25,851 --> 02:29:29,420
the original prices and it was like 75%
off.

3373
02:29:29,421 --> 02:29:32,360
And you got it.
Let's try remember for like 600 getting

3374
02:29:32,361 --> 02:29:35,240
three suits and a pair of shoes and two
dress shirts or something,

3375
02:29:35,950 --> 02:29:36,980
you know,
nice suits.

3376
02:29:36,981 --> 02:29:37,970
Like wow.
Like,

3377
02:29:38,030 --> 02:29:40,250
you know,
because there's something for third,

3378
02:29:40,251 --> 02:29:43,310
somebody robbed them off the truck,
but they had blenders in there.

3379
02:29:43,310 --> 02:29:45,590
They had TVs,
they had tables,

3380
02:29:45,860 --> 02:29:47,420
they had everything.
Everything was brand new.

3381
02:29:47,900 --> 02:29:48,391
If it,
you know,

3382
02:29:48,391 --> 02:29:50,210
it was probably headed to Ikea or
something like that.

3383
02:29:50,211 --> 02:29:52,420
Who the fuck knows?
Wow.

3384
02:29:52,690 --> 02:29:54,980
They had buildings in New York when I
was growing up.

3385
02:29:54,981 --> 02:29:57,230
They pull up,
but type of guys from the neighborhood

3386
02:29:57,231 --> 02:30:00,740
that you knew how to job,
but APA trucking or one of those things,

3387
02:30:00,741 --> 02:30:03,920
one of those trucking firms and they get
shit every fucking Thursday.

3388
02:30:05,130 --> 02:30:07,190
They ain't got shit every fucking
Thursday when like a big,

3389
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:11,600
when I was a kid fucking the trains
would move Honda many trails and the

3390
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:13,990
many trails or the best motorcycle you
could buy for a kid.

3391
02:30:13,991 --> 02:30:18,200
We didn't have balls.
It was 50 it was 50 cc and it was

3392
02:30:18,201 --> 02:30:19,370
automatic.
I had one,

3393
02:30:19,970 --> 02:30:22,850
I bought one for real.
My mother bought me one for real and

3394
02:30:22,851 --> 02:30:26,060
then we found out that you could steal
them off the train that came through

3395
02:30:26,080 --> 02:30:28,880
Erie,
Lackawanna and you would go down there

3396
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:31,190
and somebody would jump on the train and
break the seal,

3397
02:30:31,850 --> 02:30:33,650
take the shit off,
thrown into the weeds.

3398
02:30:33,980 --> 02:30:36,380
And then somebody had have to come back
with a truck because in those days you

3399
02:30:36,381 --> 02:30:37,590
put those together,
they didn't come.

3400
02:30:37,591 --> 02:30:39,620
And built.
The Tigers won,

3401
02:30:39,650 --> 02:30:41,960
the bottom was on,
you got to put the seed on,

3402
02:30:42,340 --> 02:30:44,900
got to put the steering wheel on,
you gotta put all that shit on him.

3403
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:47,840
It's amazing dog.
So we found that when they were coming

3404
02:30:47,841 --> 02:30:49,940
in and you take three or four of them,
keep one,

3405
02:30:50,560 --> 02:30:52,610
all three of them,
there were 200 retail.

3406
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:56,190
So that meant they were probably $85.
What's in there?

3407
02:30:56,191 --> 02:30:58,920
Like a big amount of profit for like
some organized crime in New York.

3408
02:30:58,921 --> 02:31:01,550
Cause they get steal things off the
docks and then resell them someplace.

3409
02:31:02,520 --> 02:31:06,110
It costs you nothing.
It costs you nothing.

3410
02:31:07,490 --> 02:31:09,050
You could sell it for whatever the fuck
you want.

3411
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:13,640
You can undercut everybody.
Why do you think stealing cocaine in the

3412
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:16,080
80s are so popular?
Because I control the mark.

3413
02:31:16,090 --> 02:31:18,890
I just got 30 kilos,
then you're going to pay 44.

3414
02:31:18,891 --> 02:31:20,100
I'm yourself at 32

3415
02:31:20,200 --> 02:31:23,280
was the last time anybody ever offered
you would buy something that was stolen.

3416
02:31:26,040 --> 02:31:28,050
As soon as I moved to California and
start really,

3417
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:31,920
you stop talking the boom Shacka lacka
eat.

3418
02:31:33,060 --> 02:31:34,260
Oh that's right.
Yeah.

3419
02:31:34,710 --> 02:31:37,560
But he had to uh,
dildos the other day and I'm like,

3420
02:31:37,800 --> 02:31:40,370
wow,
these are like brand new soccer locker

3421
02:31:40,400 --> 02:31:42,680
or the other guy.
Nice guy.

3422
02:31:42,990 --> 02:31:43,291
No,
no,

3423
02:31:43,291 --> 02:31:44,850
no.
Yeah,

3424
02:31:44,890 --> 02:31:46,040
but who's the guy with the lighters?
Ah,

3425
02:31:46,050 --> 02:31:49,050
that's uh,
you have another crazy name?

3426
02:31:49,051 --> 02:31:49,884
Yeah.
Fuck

3427
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:52,410
yeah.
I just saw him the other day.

3428
02:31:52,910 --> 02:31:54,630
Yeah,
he hangs out at the rainbow now,

3429
02:31:54,631 --> 02:31:56,220
but,
and males,

3430
02:31:56,380 --> 02:31:58,440
but we checked like had this dildo and
I'm like,

3431
02:31:58,441 --> 02:31:59,820
wow,
this is like brand new.

3432
02:31:59,821 --> 02:32:01,320
And I'm like,
but it's not,

3433
02:32:01,321 --> 02:32:04,930
why am I telling
you?

3434
02:32:04,980 --> 02:32:09,980
Remember that Kennison talked about the
Roxy way back or the rainbow way back in

3435
02:32:10,951 --> 02:32:14,320
his fucking HBO special.
That's how crazy the rainbows band.

3436
02:32:14,350 --> 02:32:17,460
You see the sunset strip movie I told
you about and they tell you about this.

3437
02:32:17,490 --> 02:32:18,323
No

3438
02:32:18,610 --> 02:32:20,620
Strip just came out on showtime on
demand.

3439
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:23,750
I think you could ask it on iTunes.
It's a documentary about sun stripped

3440
02:32:23,751 --> 02:32:26,050
starting from the beginning all the way
through the mafia,

3441
02:32:26,051 --> 02:32:29,050
all the way through Ciro's it goes
through and all this shit about the,

3442
02:32:29,560 --> 02:32:31,810
there though hooker houses that were
everywhere.

3443
02:32:31,811 --> 02:32:33,970
I had no idea about like there was like,
uh,

3444
02:32:34,330 --> 02:32:35,440
whatever.
Like houses,

3445
02:32:35,441 --> 02:32:38,670
like rich people would go to and just
had tons of hookers in it and uh,

3446
02:32:38,980 --> 02:32:39,461
you,
you,

3447
02:32:39,461 --> 02:32:40,000
you,
you,

3448
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,330
it talks about everything and he'd go
buy it and you're just going by these

3449
02:32:43,331 --> 02:32:44,560
buildings that you go by every day and
like,

3450
02:32:44,561 --> 02:32:46,450
Holy Shit.
That was the hooker house.

3451
02:32:46,830 --> 02:32:50,160
Yeah.
It came out in 2012 got mad reviews,

3452
02:32:50,161 --> 02:32:50,581
man.
Oh,

3453
02:32:50,581 --> 02:32:54,510
it's got amazing people in it.
It's got an amazing a review online.

3454
02:32:55,320 --> 02:32:59,130
It says a documentary on the famous Los
Angeles Street.

3455
02:32:59,220 --> 02:33:00,150
Wow.
Yeah.

3456
02:33:00,270 --> 02:33:02,610
So yeah.
It's got five stars or four stars here.

3457
02:33:03,510 --> 02:33:04,650
Yeah.
I'm getting that shit tonight.

3458
02:33:04,651 --> 02:33:06,380
Is it available on iTunes?
Yup.

3459
02:33:06,760 --> 02:33:10,540
It's really well done.
There's a lot of people in it.

3460
02:33:10,660 --> 02:33:11,493
And uh,

3461
02:33:13,380 --> 02:33:18,380
if there is a place in,
in like the world that I've ever been to

3462
02:33:18,960 --> 02:33:21,840
that I feel like it's haunted with the
memories of the past,

3463
02:33:21,990 --> 02:33:24,980
not necessarily haunted,
but haunted with the,

3464
02:33:24,981 --> 02:33:27,240
the memories of the past.
It's that area.

3465
02:33:27,480 --> 02:33:27,930
Yeah.

3466
02:33:27,930 --> 02:33:30,870
They talk about that a lot.
So haunted aspect.

3467
02:33:31,150 --> 02:33:33,230
And they talk about how it used to be
like papa,

3468
02:33:33,380 --> 02:33:36,070
not poppy fields,
like something weird here.

3469
02:33:36,410 --> 02:33:39,120
Before it was Ciro's Boulevard,

3470
02:33:39,270 --> 02:33:44,270
famous boulevard glorified and movie.
You walking.

3471
02:33:47,260 --> 02:33:50,120
I'm seeing you.
They go through a lot of

3472
02:33:52,470 --> 02:33:54,520
comedy.
Wow.

3473
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:59,940
Doheny to crescent heights.
There's a lot of ghosts I believe in

3474
02:33:59,941 --> 02:34:02,940
sacred places and I believe that this
is,

3475
02:34:02,941 --> 02:34:06,120
it's a sacred place.
That strip is like,

3476
02:34:06,121 --> 02:34:06,954
where are you leaving?

3477
02:34:07,360 --> 02:34:12,360
Come back.
Yeah.

3478
02:34:14,431 --> 02:34:18,250
You can almost taste.
It's about titillation and sex.

3479
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:23,550
Hollywood itself is a bag
sexual appeal and the strip instead of a

3480
02:34:26,520 --> 02:34:29,710
patient of that,
your dreams can start out there and

3481
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:31,130
you'd be,
we'll end there.

3482
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:32,940
You know,
if you don't watch your shit you will

3483
02:34:32,941 --> 02:34:35,510
die that night and it will be because
he's too talkative or weird.

3484
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:36,583
Jason.

3485
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:39,160
Yeah,
he was talking to that other guy who was

3486
02:34:39,161 --> 02:34:41,730
just a weird combo.
Who was the other guy called?

3487
02:34:42,600 --> 02:34:44,490
No,
I think it's that guy that's also comic

3488
02:34:45,450 --> 02:34:47,670
battle.
The God damn site.

3489
02:34:47,740 --> 02:34:52,250
Amazing Fun.
Could not have happened any place else

3490
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:55,960
and don't you ever forget it?
It was so alive.

3491
02:34:56,170 --> 02:34:57,830
Honestly.
I mean you tell mom,

3492
02:34:57,840 --> 02:35:02,840
mom hits viper room walk.
Nobody would ever come and be like,

3493
02:35:05,441 --> 02:35:07,450
you guys can't do that here.
Are you crazy?

3494
02:35:07,570 --> 02:35:10,430
It seems like this is a place where
people sort of come for refuge.

3495
02:35:10,980 --> 02:35:15,980
Sunset strip is a civilization or the
broken hearted and mistreated.

3496
02:35:16,311 --> 02:35:17,780
The uncle.
Lucky I'm do love

3497
02:35:19,430 --> 02:35:20,520
die.
You might as well die.

3498
02:35:20,760 --> 02:35:23,450
Die Front of all of them.
Why is that going to make up on the

3499
02:35:23,451 --> 02:35:27,010
white songs like the mayor sunset strip
or something weird like that?

3500
02:35:27,410 --> 02:35:28,243
Well,
why is he?

3501
02:35:28,650 --> 02:35:29,490
I don't know.
Okay.

3502
02:35:30,150 --> 02:35:31,530
Wow.
That looks bad ass.

3503
02:35:31,531 --> 02:35:32,580
Yeah,
that was really good.

3504
02:35:32,730 --> 02:35:36,390
I just realized how fortunate I am to
have been able to perform that.

3505
02:35:37,170 --> 02:35:39,360
I can just hit me like Jesus.
They could go back.

3506
02:35:40,440 --> 02:35:42,210
I go to the laugh factory from time to
time.

3507
02:35:42,510 --> 02:35:43,650
Would you go back to the store?
No,

3508
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:45,453
never.
No.

3509
02:35:46,760 --> 02:35:47,460
Wait,
if I guys,

3510
02:35:47,460 --> 02:35:52,460
if you guys came with me,
what the fuck or does this just kidding.

3511
02:35:53,760 --> 02:35:54,331
What are you,
do you,

3512
02:35:54,331 --> 02:35:55,620
are you a ghostbuster?
Yeah,

3513
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:58,110
I call it dumb show on Tuesday.
Yeah,

3514
02:35:58,320 --> 02:35:59,430
dumps on Tuesdays.
Great.

3515
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:02,280
Well he does.
Is he like as a fun thing he does.

3516
02:36:02,281 --> 02:36:05,040
It's not just stand up.
He fucks around with the crowd a lot.

3517
02:36:05,580 --> 02:36:06,840
He tortures them.
Oh yeah.

3518
02:36:07,640 --> 02:36:09,030
Well he's great at that,
you know,

3519
02:36:09,031 --> 02:36:11,130
and he does his podcast from there too
sometimes.

3520
02:36:11,190 --> 02:36:12,630
You know,
I did the podcast,

3521
02:36:12,631 --> 02:36:15,270
I did it once with Jamie Masada once.

3522
02:36:16,500 --> 02:36:16,880
Yeah.

3523
02:36:16,880 --> 02:36:21,290
Once I got a call on you,
you guys went back to the comedy store.

3524
02:36:21,291 --> 02:36:23,600
Like seriously,
I'd have been one of the most amazing

3525
02:36:23,601 --> 02:36:25,670
things ever.
Just it's just like having like the

3526
02:36:25,671 --> 02:36:29,750
Rogan does Tuesday so hot,
like in the main room sold out every

3527
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:31,400
week and it's not happening.
Awesome.

3528
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:32,930
Yeah,
but why would we do it there when we do

3529
02:36:32,931 --> 02:36:35,090
it at the Ice House tomorrow night,
boom.

3530
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:38,090
Joey Diaz is doing his podcast there and
then boom,

3531
02:36:38,091 --> 02:36:43,091
I'm there with Eddie F's and Brian Cowen
tomorrow 10:00 PM I see that you see the

3532
02:36:43,821 --> 02:36:47,600
differences,
the energy at the ice houses all like

3533
02:36:47,630 --> 02:36:51,150
there's a long history of it and there's
also what we bring there.

3534
02:36:51,800 --> 02:36:53,860
We've been bringing their,
this plenty's paradise.

3535
02:36:53,870 --> 02:36:56,330
Hell son.
This is not negative cause no murdered

3536
02:36:56,331 --> 02:36:58,190
people.
There's no like holes in the fucking

3537
02:36:58,191 --> 02:37:00,800
basement covered in some mat with dead
people.

3538
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:02,450
Okay.
Would people don't realize,

3539
02:37:02,451 --> 02:37:04,400
we're not exaggerating,
there was Ciro's nightclub.

3540
02:37:04,400 --> 02:37:07,340
It was owned by Bugsy Siegel.
The Bugsy Siegel.

3541
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:09,980
I mean that guy was a gangster.
That guy had have killed people.

3542
02:37:09,981 --> 02:37:11,600
That's back when you could just kill
people.

3543
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:12,890
Yeah.
And that dirty,

3544
02:37:12,891 --> 02:37:16,100
crazy street,
that nutty energy of that place has,

3545
02:37:16,101 --> 02:37:17,540
it only makes sense to people dying
there.

3546
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:19,820
The Piano Player,
Jeff Scott recently posted on his

3547
02:37:19,821 --> 02:37:20,511
Facebook,
uh,

3548
02:37:20,511 --> 02:37:21,700
the tunnel going,
uh,

3549
02:37:21,810 --> 02:37:25,310
underneath the street where they used to
have like take the bodies underneath to

3550
02:37:25,311 --> 02:37:27,090
where you used to be something else.
Yeah.

3551
02:37:27,260 --> 02:37:28,130
To the house.
The house.

3552
02:37:28,131 --> 02:37:28,791
So yeah,
that was,

3553
02:37:28,791 --> 02:37:29,810
well,
I don't know if that's true,

3554
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:32,270
but that was the room rose was that in
the back of the main room,

3555
02:37:32,271 --> 02:37:35,720
there was a doorway to a tunnel and the
tunnel led up the hill to crest hill

3556
02:37:35,721 --> 02:37:37,220
where the mansion was because there
were,

3557
02:37:37,310 --> 02:37:39,650
the property was sold together
allegedly.

3558
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:42,950
But that's like one of those things like
fucking it kabod crane.

3559
02:37:43,020 --> 02:37:45,650
There is a tunnel.
That's true.

3560
02:37:45,900 --> 02:37:47,270
There's a lot of it.
Go see it right now.

3561
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:48,830
If they have a tunnel,
somebody died.

3562
02:37:48,920 --> 02:37:50,960
That's all I need to know.
There's a lot of shit done.

3563
02:37:50,970 --> 02:37:55,040
It is a room then that goes this way and
that cuts across Nica keep going to

3564
02:37:55,041 --> 02:37:57,110
different things.
There's a lot of these ships shooting

3565
02:37:57,170 --> 02:38:01,640
the shooting holes.
One of the ideas in this questions,

3566
02:38:01,641 --> 02:38:05,360
everything show was to go and spend the
night at a haunted house and I was

3567
02:38:05,361 --> 02:38:08,960
thinking this is no better place to stay
in the store basement at the comedy

3568
02:38:08,961 --> 02:38:10,070
store too.
Yeah.

3569
02:38:10,280 --> 02:38:14,330
That would be terrified.
I'm shit my pants called call the bow.

3570
02:38:14,480 --> 02:38:18,950
You should tell a story on stage about
how the time where when he was young,

3571
02:38:18,951 --> 02:38:20,600
we'll have him come in here and tell it
some day.

3572
02:38:20,880 --> 02:38:22,100
Um,
when he was young,

3573
02:38:22,550 --> 02:38:25,340
he was staying at the store and he's out
of the store.

3574
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:28,580
Like his wife kicked him out or
something like that and he got,

3575
02:38:28,670 --> 02:38:31,010
it was forced to stay at the store.
He was sleeping on the stage.

3576
02:38:31,011 --> 02:38:31,461
It's like,
this is,

3577
02:38:31,461 --> 02:38:33,560
why am I here to make my dreams happen
man.

3578
02:38:33,710 --> 02:38:35,420
I'm not letting some chick getting my
way,

3579
02:38:35,540 --> 02:38:37,970
so I'm just going to lie down here.
And he said he's lying down.

3580
02:38:37,971 --> 02:38:40,610
He told it on stage,
it was like a Halloween show we had in

3581
02:38:40,611 --> 02:38:42,020
the main room.
It was fucking great.

3582
02:38:42,350 --> 02:38:46,250
And he was like,
and so I'm onstage and I hear clink,

3583
02:38:46,310 --> 02:38:47,143
clink,
clink,

3584
02:38:47,690 --> 02:38:50,510
like there's chairs moving,
it is pitch black.

3585
02:38:51,200 --> 02:38:52,130
And I'm like,
hey,

3586
02:38:53,330 --> 02:38:53,841
hey,
it's me,

3587
02:38:53,841 --> 02:38:55,490
Carl.
You know,

3588
02:38:55,491 --> 02:38:57,860
I had uh,
had nowhere else to stay.

3589
02:38:58,610 --> 02:39:00,680
Silence is one,
but he was a doorman back then,

3590
02:39:01,040 --> 02:39:01,760
you know,
like what?

3591
02:39:01,760 --> 02:39:05,240
Right before Kennison and even made it.
And he said he heard another clink

3592
02:39:05,241 --> 02:39:07,940
clink,
like he had another chair and they said,

3593
02:39:07,941 --> 02:39:11,020
and then out of nowhere,
two hands grabbed his legs and dragged

3594
02:39:11,021 --> 02:39:15,530
them to the edge of the stairs.
And he said there was no one there.

3595
02:39:15,740 --> 02:39:18,890
He said he didn't see anything.
By the time he got up,

3596
02:39:18,920 --> 02:39:20,900
he scrambled,
the person,

3597
02:39:20,930 --> 02:39:23,060
whatever it was,
just disappeared.

3598
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:25,790
And he said he freaked out,
ran out of there.

3599
02:39:25,860 --> 02:39:27,890
What's a great story?
It could have been easily been boom,

3600
02:39:27,970 --> 02:39:28,803
Shaka Laka.

3601
02:39:31,810 --> 02:39:34,510
Did you really,
you saw him perform there?

3602
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:37,630
No,
I saw him by the belly room going up the

3603
02:39:37,631 --> 02:39:38,464
stairs one night.

3604
02:39:38,480 --> 02:39:39,680
What do you mean you saw a ghost?

3605
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:42,880
You're shaking your head.
Yes.

3606
02:39:42,990 --> 02:39:44,020
Okay.
Come out of a pussy.

3607
02:39:45,820 --> 02:39:50,820
I was up next.
Jesus was up next to the other two and I

3608
02:39:50,861 --> 02:39:55,000
was standing by the thing there.
I kept seeing there's a light on the top

3609
02:39:55,001 --> 02:39:57,970
of the belly room.
There's a big red light dog and you're

3610
02:39:57,971 --> 02:40:00,550
still watching the comment.
And I had like two away.

3611
02:40:00,760 --> 02:40:02,800
So it was that comic on one more before
me.

3612
02:40:03,450 --> 02:40:05,830
So that was watching and waiting and
killing time.

3613
02:40:05,831 --> 02:40:07,930
And I kept seeing something,
keep going past my,

3614
02:40:09,060 --> 02:40:11,180
you see the life.
How many days had you been awake?

3615
02:40:11,460 --> 02:40:14,390
He had,
it wasn't that I didn't do bull going

3616
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:16,950
stays.
I didn't blow when I got off stage and

3617
02:40:16,951 --> 02:40:18,960
I'm sitting there going,
what the fuck is this light?

3618
02:40:18,961 --> 02:40:22,290
And finally I look up,
you know how you wore that stupid long

3619
02:40:22,291 --> 02:40:23,790
jacket?
It was like,

3620
02:40:23,791 --> 02:40:26,040
I saw the tail end of the jacket.
I went upstairs.

3621
02:40:26,041 --> 02:40:28,500
It was nobody up there dog.
I saw it.

3622
02:40:29,100 --> 02:40:31,710
I saw my own two fucking eyes,
which I never felt.

3623
02:40:31,711 --> 02:40:32,760
No.
My liver got chased.

3624
02:40:32,790 --> 02:40:35,970
Nobody pulled me base,
has a story where he was upstairs and

3625
02:40:35,971 --> 02:40:38,190
they heard them banging on the door.
Uh,

3626
02:40:38,220 --> 02:40:40,860
crazy core record more has a story where
the,

3627
02:40:40,861 --> 02:40:43,260
she heard music in the fucking main
room.

3628
02:40:43,590 --> 02:40:47,530
Like all band music,
like the titanic type music home.

3629
02:40:47,620 --> 02:40:50,550
Who is the older guy that was a veteran?
Brett.

3630
02:40:53,960 --> 02:40:55,920
A lot of people are different things
that,

3631
02:40:55,921 --> 02:40:56,521
you know,
I didn't,

3632
02:40:56,521 --> 02:41:01,521
I never got cards DePaul.
I know that the original room has a

3633
02:41:01,771 --> 02:41:04,800
weird energy and you're right,
the sunsets trip does have something

3634
02:41:04,801 --> 02:41:06,450
special.
There's something there.

3635
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:09,030
There's something that,
there's something that points at that

3636
02:41:09,031 --> 02:41:11,880
comedy store.
The big mistake they going to do is

3637
02:41:11,881 --> 02:41:13,920
they're going to knock that down and
build something over it.

3638
02:41:14,290 --> 02:41:16,770
It's going to be like a carry movie,
the hands and they come out of the

3639
02:41:16,771 --> 02:41:18,600
ground.
I mean,

3640
02:41:18,601 --> 02:41:20,730
that's the truth guys.
There's something that somebody

3641
02:41:20,731 --> 02:41:23,460
committed suicide there people gave you
that lives there.

3642
02:41:23,700 --> 02:41:26,620
How many people died and didn't make it
as comics and a fucking shore it's

3643
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:28,380
warranted.
What about the guy that jumped off the

3644
02:41:28,381 --> 02:41:28,831
roof?
Sure.

3645
02:41:28,831 --> 02:41:32,670
That fucking places haunted.
Yeah,

3646
02:41:32,780 --> 02:41:35,760
sure were taunted.
So that building in Gardner,

3647
02:41:35,761 --> 02:41:38,070
all those buildings,
people in those buildings,

3648
02:41:38,071 --> 02:41:39,690
bro,
people got a straight,

3649
02:41:39,691 --> 02:41:42,720
legit people say this block is on,
on garden to mind.

3650
02:41:42,720 --> 02:41:46,920
I'll come by dre buildings there.
Then haunted that many people killed

3651
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:48,660
themselves.
Those buildings coming out here.

3652
02:41:48,990 --> 02:41:51,840
Look at this fucking young kid that I
used himself last week from a Disney

3653
02:41:51,841 --> 02:41:53,580
show,
29 years old.

3654
02:41:53,581 --> 02:41:57,010
He's on fucking Rizzoli and isles
fucking black kid queen.

3655
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:59,640
Nine years old with a shotgun.
I go to do the podcast.

3656
02:42:00,480 --> 02:42:03,030
I go to make a right mess capsule.
All my fucking corny.

3657
02:42:03,031 --> 02:42:06,000
It wasn't that fucking building there.
What possesses people?

3658
02:42:06,001 --> 02:42:09,110
He wasn't on drugs.
That kid I used to go down to a one hop

3659
02:42:09,120 --> 02:42:12,240
can go with that kid.
What possesses people to do that shit?

3660
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:15,990
Who knows Hollywood that time?
Shane.

3661
02:42:16,020 --> 02:42:18,630
You know how many Judy can't see Audi's
back?

3662
02:42:19,100 --> 02:42:22,050
She doesn't the Haha cafe.
Why would Judy can't see?

3663
02:42:22,150 --> 02:42:24,700
He tried to make a comeback.
I don't get it.

3664
02:42:26,700 --> 02:42:30,870
I just saw her.
That lasted like 30 minutes.

3665
02:42:30,870 --> 02:42:32,690
Yeah,
it's hardening and yelling.

3666
02:42:32,730 --> 02:42:35,960
These people come out here and they get
crazy man and you know,

3667
02:42:35,970 --> 02:42:39,380
I'm very happy.

same manager in 2000 we're still here.

3671
02:42:48,060 --> 02:42:50,220
Whether we're fucking rich or
successful,

3672
02:42:50,230 --> 02:42:52,170
where the TV show,
we're still here,

3673
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:55,290
no car crashes.
We have an old deed.

3674
02:42:55,470 --> 02:42:57,950
We're here.
I'll fucking lucky a week dog.

3675
02:42:58,280 --> 02:42:59,910
Oh,
we're very lucky to have gone through

3676
02:42:59,911 --> 02:43:03,720
what we've gone through at the store and
having a great time and the comedy that

3677
02:43:03,721 --> 02:43:08,490
I just saw that I had goosebumps.
I'm a fucking fat ex felon from North

3678
02:43:08,490 --> 02:43:09,323
Bergen,
New Jersey.

3679
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:12,040
I was at the comedy store doing blow
development,

3680
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:14,320
getting better,
seeing the fucking world,

3681
02:43:14,321 --> 02:43:17,440
walking to the store,
walking from the union on Tuesday night

3682
02:43:17,441 --> 02:43:20,950
to the store and walking back to the
laugh factory and we used to walk the

3683
02:43:20,951 --> 02:43:23,570
standard also standard eat the blue
cheese burgers.

3684
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:24,880
Yeah.
Fucking delicious.

3685
02:43:24,881 --> 02:43:27,640
Come on us is incredible.
I remember that Carnegie it that sold

3686
02:43:27,660 --> 02:43:30,100
the lighters the first week I was the
guy.

3687
02:43:30,101 --> 02:43:31,910
Yeah,
the first weekend monkey ball.

3688
02:43:31,960 --> 02:43:35,920
The first Monday I was ever here,
I walked into the fucking comedy store

3689
02:43:35,921 --> 02:43:39,760
and Don Paris put me on stage.
Thank God I knew Eddie Griffin.

3690
02:43:39,761 --> 02:43:42,800
He put me on a Monday night.
Don's barriers still had the shorts on.

3691
02:43:43,020 --> 02:43:45,150
It's still had the balloons on.
Wow.

3692
02:43:45,210 --> 02:43:48,010
Cause the next day they told me to go to
the laugh factory.

3693
02:43:48,070 --> 02:43:51,100
That's where you went on Tuesdays and
you stood on wine or Dang,

3694
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:53,590
you did three minutes and I still don't
whine all day.

3695
02:43:53,591 --> 02:43:57,640
Guess who was on line with me all day?
Monkey balls and he knew the whole

3696
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:01,300
history of comedy in La.
Who you had a sign with who was going to

3697
02:44:01,301 --> 02:44:04,120
see you?
I thought this guy was a master comic

3698
02:44:04,450 --> 02:44:06,580
and he went on stage and he lost his
voice.

3699
02:44:06,581 --> 02:44:10,270
I never laughed so hard on my wife.
He went up there and my son all day,

3700
02:44:10,271 --> 02:44:13,020
he's talking telling stories now he's
like me,

3701
02:44:13,030 --> 02:44:13,391
me,
me,

3702
02:44:13,391 --> 02:44:13,781
me,
me,

3703
02:44:13,781 --> 02:44:14,800
me,
me dying.

3704
02:44:15,250 --> 02:44:17,800
That was monkey balls.
Then he became a lighter salesman and

3705
02:44:17,801 --> 02:44:19,020
rings wheels.
Beat him.

3706
02:44:19,390 --> 02:44:21,040
He always had those lighters with
titties.

3707
02:44:21,990 --> 02:44:23,560
Brian counting and Don Paris.
Yeah.

3708
02:44:23,700 --> 02:44:28,700
Brian Cowan and Don Perez have this
thing where Don Barris pretends to Bang

3709
02:44:31,410 --> 02:44:35,310
Brian Count in his booty hole.
He gets his pants down and everything

3710
02:44:35,880 --> 02:44:40,020
and they have this thing.
They act it out and it's so realistic.

3711
02:44:40,200 --> 02:44:43,980
He presses,
he presses counts mouth against his cock

3712
02:44:44,390 --> 02:44:46,290
sucking.
It makes it like he's pulling his cock

3713
02:44:46,291 --> 02:44:49,290
out,
jerks off on him and finishes it and

3714
02:44:49,291 --> 02:44:51,300
it's,
it's made it extra special by the fact

3715
02:44:51,301 --> 02:44:55,350
that Don Barris without wearing a
costume is doing this in a jumpsuit.

3716
02:44:56,280 --> 02:44:59,760
He wears a tracksuit naturally.
Like it's not like he dressed up for

3717
02:44:59,761 --> 02:45:01,830
this role where he could pose cock out
really easy.

3718
02:45:01,860 --> 02:45:02,520
No,
it's just,

3719
02:45:02,520 --> 02:45:04,500
it's a part of his thing and on top of
that,

3720
02:45:04,630 --> 02:45:06,990
dawn Buress is rumored to have a cock
size of your arm.

3721
02:45:07,850 --> 02:45:11,130
That's what I understand.
That's the room every time he had been.

3722
02:45:11,131 --> 02:45:12,630
We're about to pull it out on stage.

3723
02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:13,680
I get out of the room,
I don't want,

3724
02:45:14,610 --> 02:45:18,060
I don't want to get depressed.
That's the one thing,

3725
02:45:18,061 --> 02:45:18,511
man.
I mean,

3726
02:45:18,511 --> 02:45:20,940
if you don't have a giant Dick and the
other guys that giant Turkey like,

3727
02:45:20,941 --> 02:45:22,830
wow,
well what the hell?

3728
02:45:23,010 --> 02:45:24,450
I mean,
you could always get rich,

3729
02:45:24,490 --> 02:45:26,190
you know,
making enough money.

3730
02:45:26,191 --> 02:45:28,800
You could buy a nice house too.
But if a guy's got a giant Dick,

3731
02:45:28,801 --> 02:45:30,110
he's got a giant deck.
He just got,

3732
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:32,490
it was,
I forget it was like a year ago or

3733
02:45:32,491 --> 02:45:33,340
something like that.
He had a bone.

3734
02:45:33,341 --> 02:45:36,120
If for some reason he wanted to show a
girl and the audience and he was just

3735
02:45:36,121 --> 02:45:37,740
like outlining it with his hand.
Like,

3736
02:45:37,800 --> 02:45:38,880
look how big this is,
honey.

3737
02:45:38,940 --> 02:45:39,541
You know?
Like he said,

3738
02:45:39,541 --> 02:45:41,610
it's like trying to like,
it's took a 12 inch Dick,

3739
02:45:41,611 --> 02:45:43,830
right?
It's a giant fat dick.

3740
02:45:43,860 --> 02:45:47,070
It's not a skinny 12 inches either.
It's not like one of those white guys in

3741
02:45:47,071 --> 02:45:48,540
the movies where it's long.
But you're like,

3742
02:45:48,541 --> 02:45:49,201
yeah,
but it's like,

3743
02:45:49,201 --> 02:45:51,300
it's tapered.
The beginning of the end of it,

3744
02:45:51,301 --> 02:45:52,800
it's like small.
It's weird.

3745
02:45:52,860 --> 02:45:55,110
You know,
there's some long and unimpressive.

3746
02:45:55,380 --> 02:45:58,230
Don Buress is a dick.
It looks like a big German Dick.

3747
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:00,740
You know,
like a big Austrian Dick.

3748
02:46:00,770 --> 02:46:03,570
Yeah.
Which you would imagine some fucking

3749
02:46:03,720 --> 02:46:06,840
hiker would have.
Joey.

3750
02:46:06,870 --> 02:46:07,910
Dan's done.
Look at this.

3751
02:46:07,990 --> 02:46:10,000
Think about Dixie.
He's

3752
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:10,940
shaking his head like,
yeah,

3753
02:46:10,941 --> 02:46:11,810
yeah,
I understand.

3754
02:46:11,900 --> 02:46:14,690
I understand.
I got a big Dick to cock sucker.

3755
02:46:15,350 --> 02:46:17,090
I need this shit.
Totally like diamond back.

3756
02:46:17,091 --> 02:46:18,980
We don't,
we don't need this shit if anybody needs

3757
02:46:18,981 --> 02:46:19,221
to.
Shit.

3758
02:46:19,221 --> 02:46:20,480
Listen.
Is there any more tickets to you

3759
02:46:20,481 --> 02:46:22,260

3765
02:46:34,991 --> 02:46:37,330

3774
02:46:56,421 --> 02:46:57,254
smoking reefer.

3775
02:46:57,280 --> 02:47:00,000
Bazookas eating edibles.
Somebody made a tray.

3776
02:47:00,001 --> 02:47:02,980
Black security was going to fucking take
broken home that we're all gonna Miss

3777
02:47:03,030 --> 02:47:03,561
Shit.

3779
02:47:05,511 --> 02:47:06,890

We know that we're incredibly lucky in

3788
02:47:24,321 --> 02:47:28,640
that we're wearing this weird situation
where we have like the nicest,

3789
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:31,700
I didn't want calm fans.
The people that come out to these shows

3790
02:47:31,701 --> 02:47:34,310
that are the nicest people periods does
humans,

3791
02:47:34,340 --> 02:47:36,140

3792
02:47:36,270 --> 02:47:39,050
it's in the atmosphere is just cool as
fuck.

3793
02:47:39,410 --> 02:47:41,960
After the shows and these are a few
people get real nervous and the hands

3794
02:47:41,961 --> 02:47:43,580
get sweaty and that those,
they're strange.

3795
02:47:43,640 --> 02:47:45,170

We'll just put the older one on.

3797
02:47:47,001 --> 02:47:50,360
Don't be hugging me with a fucking stink
bomb under your shirt pastor.

3798
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:52,070
How many times though when you take
pictures of dudes,

3799
02:47:52,071 --> 02:47:55,080
they just completely sweaty.
I'm sweaty too so I don't get

3800
02:47:57,380 --> 02:47:59,180
nervous.
I tell him please don't touch me cause

3801
02:47:59,181 --> 02:48:01,330
I'm sweaty and they don't give a fuck.
So fuck.

3802
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:03,800
They want to touch you and you go home
and take the shirt off and put it on the

3803
02:48:03,801 --> 02:48:05,950
couch and next day just take a whiff of
it.

3804
02:48:06,060 --> 02:48:08,450
Smells like fucking the chick with the
ghost in the snatch.

3805
02:48:09,290 --> 02:48:12,170
That's yeah,
this is the checks that took care of us

3806
02:48:12,171 --> 02:48:13,350
last time.
Look at it.

3807
02:48:13,370 --> 02:48:15,520
This is going to be bossing the walk.

3808
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:18,110
You don't fuck asleep but kept the line
going.

3809
02:48:18,111 --> 02:48:21,620
They kept everybody in line cause we've
been come after shows,

3810
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:24,650
we'll meet people and we,
we've been doing it for forever.

3811
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:27,440
Like I don't know man.
I don't know how it started,

3812
02:48:27,680 --> 02:48:29,600
how it started,
where we just hang around after shows

3813
02:48:29,601 --> 02:48:31,510
but it was a long ass time ago.
It don't matter.

3814
02:48:31,570 --> 02:48:33,930
We just decided we hang out afterwards
at all.

3815
02:48:34,010 --> 02:48:34,581
It makes,
well,

3816
02:48:34,581 --> 02:48:36,560
you know what,
we decided and we even talked about it

3817
02:48:36,561 --> 02:48:39,620
and we decided that it's a,
even if we want to leave,

3818
02:48:39,621 --> 02:48:43,730
like it's way better for them if they
get to hang out and take a picture with

3819
02:48:43,731 --> 02:48:45,770
us and get to meet us.
It's a better experience,

3820
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:46,850
you know,
so that's like,

3821
02:48:46,850 --> 02:48:48,710
it's part of the experience.
It's a,

3822
02:48:48,720 --> 02:48:49,700
they,
they go to the show,

3823
02:48:49,701 --> 02:48:53,150
they have a good time and then you know,
afterwards were hanging around with them

3824
02:48:53,540 --> 02:48:56,180
and talk to them and take photos with
them and it's so,

3825
02:48:56,181 --> 02:48:57,440
it's not just,
you know,

3826
02:48:57,441 --> 02:48:59,780
you're not just,
we're not just doing a comedy show and

3827
02:48:59,781 --> 02:49:03,200
then getting the fuck out of there.
Like we appreciate you guys coming in as

3828
02:49:03,201 --> 02:49:04,490
well.
I walked into the UFC,

3829
02:49:04,491 --> 02:49:07,000
people start yelling,
you're like,

3830
02:49:07,090 --> 02:49:08,190
like,
no,

3831
02:49:08,191 --> 02:49:08,551
no,
no,

3832
02:49:08,551 --> 02:49:09,840
no.
Come on you motherfucker.

3833
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:11,950
Those people at the UFC,
you're crazy.

3834
02:49:11,951 --> 02:49:14,410
And sometimes I have to leave.
Like I do interviews afterwards and the

3835
02:49:14,470 --> 02:49:16,940
scream,
it's like I can't,

3836
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:19,180
I got to go.
They're going to fucking to drag me out

3837
02:49:19,181 --> 02:49:21,250
of here.
They'll keep you there forever.

3838
02:49:21,370 --> 02:49:22,590
They bribed the security and let them

3839
02:49:22,650 --> 02:49:24,120
get up front though.
It's great man.

3840
02:49:24,150 --> 02:49:25,940
I love every fucking minute of it.
I really,

3841
02:49:26,100 --> 02:49:29,790
well this the the UFC too,
they give it a lot of access to fans.

3842
02:49:30,010 --> 02:49:32,700
Those fanex bows and Q and A's.

3843
02:49:33,220 --> 02:49:36,040
It passed the way it's supposed to be.
It is the way it's costing it and then

3844
02:49:36,090 --> 02:49:38,070
no other leisure learn it from Dana
White.

3845
02:49:38,460 --> 02:49:40,050
That's what you gotta do to be
successful.

3846
02:49:40,051 --> 02:49:42,630
People want the full experience.
People will pay.

3847
02:49:42,631 --> 02:49:46,920
They get fucking arm barred by chocolate
down and you know what show would I?

3848
02:49:47,660 --> 02:49:49,170
Oh yeah.
If you're fun,

3849
02:49:49,500 --> 02:49:52,530
if you're going to the fan expo,
learn how to roll.

3850
02:49:52,531 --> 02:49:54,120
I don't care whether you're a white belt
of Brown,

3851
02:49:54,121 --> 02:49:55,290
but they're not going to kill you.
They're gonna.

3852
02:49:55,440 --> 02:49:57,540
You're gonna get one great thing on the
billing and the picture.

3853
02:49:57,850 --> 02:49:59,520
A memory for life.
I could never do that.

3854
02:49:59,800 --> 02:50:03,150
And I went to June,
I went to like a Willis reads basketball

3855
02:50:03,151 --> 02:50:04,530
camp.
There was no pictures then.

3856
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:07,530
You didn't take a picture with no body.
You web was all from memory.

3857
02:50:07,531 --> 02:50:09,330

new,
um,

3918
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:43,080
he released a new acoustic only CD and
he got the idea from doing it,

3919
02:52:43,751 --> 02:52:47,140
from performing on podcasts,
from getting on our podcast and,

3920
02:52:47,340 --> 02:52:49,510
and doing it for the first time
performing,

3921
02:52:49,540 --> 02:52:51,100
you know,
acoustic like that and getting this

3922
02:52:51,160 --> 02:52:52,300
massive reaction.

3923
02:52:52,450 --> 02:52:55,480
So all the love is what inspires them.
Yeah.

3924
02:52:55,850 --> 02:52:57,320
He actually pulled me last time he was
here,

3925
02:52:57,321 --> 02:52:58,470
he pulled me into the car and goes,
Brian,

3926
02:52:58,471 --> 02:53:00,620
I need something to tell you something.
And he showed me,

3927
02:53:00,621 --> 02:53:02,900
cause it's supposedly,
I hope it's still on there,

3928
02:53:02,901 --> 02:53:04,110
but he said,
uh,

3929
02:53:04,190 --> 02:53:07,050
we talked about,
I said that you should do like a how

3930
02:53:07,180 --> 02:53:10,760
that one song jump jump up and down,
you should do an acoustic version of,

3931
02:53:10,761 --> 02:53:11,480
and he's like,
no,

3932
02:53:11,480 --> 02:53:13,010
I hate those songs about it.
He's like,

3933
02:53:13,011 --> 02:53:14,930
he played it for me in his car and he
and he's like,

3934
02:53:14,931 --> 02:53:15,890
how is this?
I think I was like,

3935
02:53:15,891 --> 02:53:16,724
what the f

3936
02:53:16,860 --> 02:53:20,480

3942
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:29,720
it's going to be sick.
He's,

3943
02:53:29,750 --> 02:53:33,240
I like him acoustically even better than
the house paint.

3944
02:53:33,241 --> 02:53:35,150
Me Too.
And I think house of pain's a mate.

3945
02:53:35,330 --> 02:53:38,520
What does that song,
a little Miss America or that one song?

3946
02:53:38,960 --> 02:53:41,060
God Damn,

his,
his acoustic shit is like way deeper.

3949
02:53:48,860 --> 02:53:51,600
It's way more emotional and touching.
Jump around.

3950
02:53:51,601 --> 02:53:54,490
It's always going to be like an anthem.
It's always going to be like a cool song

3951
02:53:54,491 --> 02:53:55,670
