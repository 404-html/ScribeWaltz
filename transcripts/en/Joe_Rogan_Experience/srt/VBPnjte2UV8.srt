1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:07,590
Boom, and we're live. Hello Sir. How
are you? Nice to see you too. Thanks.

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,510
What you do eating chocolate.

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,170
When you got here and you told me that
you are a Cacau Sharmane and I said those

4
00:00:13,171 --> 00:00:15,240
are strong words. They
are. What does that mean?

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,050
So I was in Berlin last year giving a
talk at a tech conference and somebody

6
00:00:19,051 --> 00:00:22,770
invited me to a sacred cacao ceremony.
Never heard of it. And I thought, wow,

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:27,030
that sounds awesome. I love chocolate.
I went, it was so wonderful.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,800
And at the end they were
talking about these people,

9
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:33,630
these great Cacau Schamens and I thought,
what is that? I gotta be one of those.

10
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,820
Since I came back,
I looked for certification.

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,810
There wasn't certification I self
declared and then I started doing a cacao

12
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:43,050
ceremonies in New York.
Now I have hundreds of people who come.

13
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,530
It's really wonderful and it's exciting.
Like if you want to be a doctor,

14
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:49,110
you got to go to medical school,
right? You want to be a comedian,

15
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:50,700
you got to be become a professional.

16
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,100
You gotta put on your time
Cacau Sham and just show up.

17
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,510
It's like putting up a shingle.
Hey, I'm the COUSHATTA.

18
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,990
And if anybody shows up and they
have a good time, then your real,

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,030
now how much do you need
to know about Krakow?

20
00:01:00,031 --> 00:01:04,080
Like the nutritional properties of
a cow is amazing. It's great stuff.

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:04,943
It's incredible.

22
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,060
And so definitely cacau and people have
been using it ceremonially for about

23
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:12,750
5,000 years. Um, so it's incredible. Um,

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,170
chocolate makes people happy. It helps
your brain function, your circulation,

25
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:18,750
and there's all these
kinds of incredible things.

26
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,960
But in the ceremonies that I do,
I have to key messages.

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,580
One is you are the drug. I mean,
we all take people take drugs,

28
00:01:26,581 --> 00:01:30,180
people take Iowa. Oscar and silicide
been all these kinds of things.

29
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:34,500
But I also think that we have for the
things that we take drugs for this kind of

30
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,300
release and happiness and joy,

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,080
we have those things inside of us and
we just kind of get out of our way.

32
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:44,550
We can experience them in. The second
thing is I believe that there are no,

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,780
I say this in my ceremonies.

34
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:49,230
There's no such thing as sacred
Chiuchow or sacred plants are sacred.

35
00:01:49,231 --> 00:01:52,890
Mountains are sacred people.
If we don't treat life with sacredness,

36
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,440
but if we recognize that
everything is sacred,

37
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,780
then we infuse life with sacredness
and meaning and that's, anyway,

38
00:01:58,781 --> 00:01:59,850
that's why I do,
it's a lot of fun.

39
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,860
That's very interesting from a guy who
specializes essentially in manipulating

40
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,390
life.
Well,

41
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:11,160
you know we have manipulated life
as humans for a very short on time,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,130
but it's interesting the
idea of things being sacred,

43
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:18,950
but your specialty is manipulating
genetics, right? Yeah.

44
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:19,231
Well,

45
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:24,231
so that is this strange moment that
we're in because for about for about 3.8

46
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:25,860
billion years,

47
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:30,780
our species has evolved by this set of
principles we call Darwinian evolution,

48
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:33,270
random mutation and natural selection.
And it's brought us here.

49
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:37,800
We used to be single cell organisms and
now look at us and there's been a lot of

50
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:40,170
magic in that process and there still is,

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,470
but we humans are deciphering
some of that magic.

52
00:02:43,471 --> 00:02:46,950
We are like looking under the hood of
what it means to be human and we are

53
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:50,430
increasingly going to have the
ability to manipulate all of life,

54
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:55,260
including our own. Yeah. That is
very unnerving to a lot of people.

55
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,710
It's, it's uncomfortable
and scary and yeah, it is.

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,400
They like things the way they are. We,
Amy, I'd like to stay the way I am.

57
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,010
We always think that there's,

58
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,760
we always think that there's a built in
conservative conservatism in our brains

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,690
and yet we live these lives
that are entirely dependent
on these radical changes

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,360
that our ancestors have created.
I mean,

61
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,920
we didn't find this building or
agriculture medicine, uh, in nature.

62
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,310
We built all those things and then
everybody gets a new baseline when you're

63
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:32,170
born and you think, well, you know,
I'm, I want, you know, organic corn,

64
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:36,040
I want whatever.
But all these things are creation.

65
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:40,570
We live in entirely created world and
our ability to manipulate and change that

66
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,590
world is always growing.
And I think we need to recognize that,

67
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:49,390
but there's being afraid is okay and
being excited as okay and we need to find

68
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:52,120
the right balance between those two
emotions. I think for a lot of people,

69
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,220
they feel like so many changes happen,

70
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,830
particularly when you're talking
about genetically modified foods.

71
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,280
So many things happened before
they realize they had happened.

72
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,910
So when they're like, hey man, I don't
want it any eat any GMO fruit. Right.

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,530
Well then you probably
shouldn't eat any fruit. Yup.

74
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,760
Because everything that
you buy has been changed.

75
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,660
Like every orange that you borrowed that,
that's why I want an orange to be like,

76
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:16,180
yeah, go buy an apple. Apple's
didn't used to be like that.

77
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,900
Tomatoes didn't used to be like
that. No, I know. That's we,

78
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:21,610
we reset our baseline just
from when we were kids.

79
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:26,290
So if you went back 12,000 years ago to
the end of the last ice age and you said,

80
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:29,200
all right, find me all these
things that we buy at whole foods.

81
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:33,250
Most of them didn't exist. We, we've
created them. Sure. And then in the 1970s,

82
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:36,280
we had the ability to do
what's recombinant DNA,

83
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,500
what people call genetic modification.

84
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,070
And people are afraid because
it's well that feels unnatural.

85
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:46,930
We're applying science to
food. Um, and you know, that's,

86
00:04:46,931 --> 00:04:51,070
that's the issue and now we're entering
the era of genetically modified humans

87
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,160
and there's that same level of
uncomfortableness. But what happened,

88
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,130
the reason why I've written this,
uh, this book hacking Darwin,

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,450
is that if we approach genetically
modified humans in the same way,

90
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:05,410
the way we approached genetically modified
foods, which is the scientists say,

91
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:08,470
Hey, we've got this, we're going
to manage them responsibly.

92
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:12,430
And it just kind of happens to people.
People are going to go nuts. I mean,

93
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:15,370
you imagine how agitated
people are about GMO foods.

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,570
If they don't have a say in how
the genetic, the experience,

95
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,150
the human experience of
genetic modification plays out,

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,570
people are going to go berserk.
So we have this window of time,

97
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,070
we can start bringing everybody into an
inclusive conversation about where we're

98
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:33,520
going because where we are going is just
radically different from where we've

99
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:36,250
been. Yeah, I think
it's an awareness issue.

100
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,640
And I also think it's a perception issue.

101
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,480
I think that everything people
do is natural, including cities.

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,900
I think cities are natural. That's
why they're all over the world. Yeah.

103
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,570
I think there was naturals beehives and
I think as much as we like to think that

104
00:05:49,571 --> 00:05:53,470
technology is not natural, it's clearly
something people naturally make.

105
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,090
Of course,
they make it in every culture they can.

106
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,210
It's the history of our species and we,
we kind of misused this word natural.

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,360
What is natural?
I mean,

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,610
maybe natural was when we used to
live and we were just part of nature.

109
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,130
And I always say it's like
people say, Oh, I love nature.

110
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,230
I love going out and hiking in the woods.

111
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,800
The reason you love hiking in the woods
is that we've murdered all the predators.

112
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,830
It's like in the old days,
in the year you stay in your cave,

113
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:20,520
you're not going out
and hiking in the woods.

114
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,190
There's stuff that's going
to kill you out there.

115
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,300
I know that was a massive luxury to go
wander through the forest with no weapons.

116
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,980
Yeah, nobody did know exactly,
but he goes, oh, I want
nature. I want my, you know,

117
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:35,550
my natural corn, I want my, my natural
Chihuahua. Even though, you know,

118
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,940
25,000 years ago there no
Chihuahuas, a wolves, wolves.

119
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,110
And look what we've done to them. I know
will look what we have done to them.

120
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,020
Made them pugs. Yeah. If you had natural
wheat like, or natural corn in particular,

121
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,660
natural corneas to be a tiny little
thing. Yeah. It's just a few, a few weeds.

122
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,040
Weird gross little grain.
Yup.

123
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,110
And then now we made it this big juicy,
sweet,

124
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:01,140
delicious thing that you put butter
on, which is great, but we can't,

125
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:05,900
we can't to have glyphosate,
glyphosate, but we can't,

126
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,430
we can't fetishize that.

127
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:11,870
There's some kind of imaginary world
where kind of everybody was wearing

128
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,440
Birkenstocks and eating a whole foods
that imaginary worlds sucked for us.

129
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,740
That's why we left it. It's true. But
there's some sort of a balance, right?

130
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:21,500
We know, we do appreciate the nature, uh,

131
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:26,501
aspect of our world and eagles and salmon
and all these wild things and to be

132
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:29,210
able to see them as very cool.
But yeah,

133
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:32,030
you don't want to get eaten by those
things. So you don't want them everywhere.

134
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:35,120
You want to be able to go out and get
your newspaper without being worried about

135
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,920
getting attacked by a
Jaguar. It helps you. Um,

136
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,960
when you think about the future, uh,
at least me, the one we talking about,

137
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,090
my concern.
Yeah.

138
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,210
I'm worried that rich people are going
to get ahold of this technology quick and

139
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:54,920
they're going to have massive unfair
advantages in terms of intellect,

140
00:07:54,921 --> 00:07:58,130
in terms of physical
athletic ability. I mean, we,

141
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,160
we really can have a grossly inbounds to
world radically quickly if this happens

142
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:08,960
fast when we don't understand exactly
what the consequences of these actions

143
00:08:08,961 --> 00:08:10,040
aren't until it's too late.

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:14,330
And then we'd try to play catch up with
rules and regulations and laws. Yeah,

145
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:18,320
that's a very, very real danger. And
that's why I've written this book.

146
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:21,170
That's why I'm out speaking
every day about this, this topic,

147
00:08:21,171 --> 00:08:23,810
because we need to
recognize that if we have,

148
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:28,811
if we approach these revolutionary
technologies using the same values that we

149
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:32,690
experience today, where you know,
we're here and very comfortable,

150
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,460
but just down the road there
are people who are just,

151
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,350
who are living without many opportunities.

152
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:39,890
There are people in parts of the world
like Central African Republic where

153
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,470
there's just a warzone,
kids are born malnourished.

154
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,380
If those are our values today,

155
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,060
we can expect that when these
future technologies arrive,

156
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,360
we'll use those, those
same values. So it's real.

157
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:55,680
And right now we have an
opportunity to say, all right,

158
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,160
these technologies are coming. Whatever
we do, these technologies that are coming,

159
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,570
there's a better possible future and
a worst possible future and how can we

160
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:08,220
infuse our best values into the process
to optimize the good stuff and minimize

161
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:08,700
the bad stuff.

162
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,660
And certainly what you're saying is a
real risk thing of what happened when

163
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,890
European countries had slightly better
weapons and slightly better ships than

164
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,570
everybody else. They took over the world,
dominated everybody. And so yeah, that's,

165
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:22,470
it's very real.

166
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:26,830
That's the government's need to play
a role in ensuring broad access in,

167
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:28,200
in regulating these,
uh,

168
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:32,760
these technologies to make sure we don't
get to that kind of dystopian scenario

169
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:36,750
that you've laid down. Well, it's also in
terms of governments regulating things,

170
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:41,130
like why are they qualified? Who are they?
Who are the government? So just people,

171
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,880
right? It's the people that are either
elected or the uh, you know, or, yeah,

172
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:47,200
some sort of a monarchy or,
and you're,

173
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,810
you're dealing with either kings and
queens and sheikhs or you're dealing with

174
00:09:51,811 --> 00:09:52,441
presidents.

175
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:56,100
And we've seen in this
country that sometimes our
presidents don't know what the

176
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:57,420
fuck they're talking about.
Right?

177
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:02,630
So who are they to disrupt science
to s to disrupt this natural flow of

178
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:06,420
technology? Well, we need side.
We need somebody to do it.

179
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:11,340
We need some representation
of our collective will be
just to avoid some of the

180
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:13,200
things like that.
Just like you just mentioned,

181
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:17,490
that that's the reason why humans
banded together and made these kind of,

182
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,580
the created governments.
And the reason for democracy,

183
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,310
especially if you have more
functioning democracies,

184
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:28,290
is that your government in some ways a
reflects the will of the people in the

185
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,740
government does things
that individuals can't do.

186
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:34,020
And I know there are a leather
libertarian arguments. Well,

187
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:36,360
everyone should just like if you want
a little road in front of your house,

188
00:10:36,361 --> 00:10:38,700
either go build the road
and pay some somebody.

189
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,270
But there are a lot of things in even
in that model that won't get done.

190
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,460
There are a lot of kind of big national,

191
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:48,960
even global concerns that you need
some kind of, uh, of regulation.

192
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:53,610
Because what we're talking about is
the future of life and life on earth.

193
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,440
And there have to be
some kind of guardrails.

194
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,070
And that's why what I'm arguing
for is we really need a bottom up.

195
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,690
I think we every person,

196
00:11:00,691 --> 00:11:02,910
and that's why I'm so thrilled
to be here with you today, Joe.

197
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,290
Every person needs to really understand
these revolutionary technologies like

198
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:07,711
genetics,

199
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:12,711
like AI and all of our responsibilities
and opportunities to say,

200
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:17,040
hey, this is really important. Here
are the values that I think that, uh,

201
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,170
that I cherish and just like you said,

202
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:23,670
I don't want it to be that the wealthiest
people are the ones who have kids with

203
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,790
higher iqs and live longer and
healthier than, than everybody else.

204
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:31,710
And then so we have to raise our voice
and our needs to be a bottom up process

205
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,800
and a, and a top down
process. And it's really,

206
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,810
it's really hard that many people have
a concern that someone else is going to

207
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:43,980
do what we're not willing to do first.
Yes, right. There were China and Russia,

208
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,020
those, the big ones,
China, especially China,

209
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,880
they're very technologically advanced
and their innovations off the chain when

210
00:11:50,881 --> 00:11:54,240
it comes to lick.
Wowway just recently surpassed apple,

211
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,840
the number to a cell phone manufacturer
in the world. Five years ago,

212
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:03,310
they had some like a single
digit share of the marketplace.

213
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,640
Now they're number two on the
planet earth. I mean, they,

214
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:10,730
they hustle and if they just decided
to make super people and they,

215
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,900
they do it before we do. That's what
people were worried about, right?

216
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:15,460
There were who they're worried about.

217
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:20,440
There's trivial things were seemingly
trivial like athletics and then there's

218
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,390
things that are really clear,
like what,

219
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,120
what's to stop people from
just becoming the hulk?

220
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,490
What's to stop people from becoming
immortal? What's the style is

221
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,170
well live in the two
questions. First is, is China,

222
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:37,740
because I think it's a really big issue,
the 21st, the story of the 21st century,

223
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:42,300
one of the biggest stories of the 21st
century will be how the US China rivalry

224
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,163
plays out.

225
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,030
And the playing field will be with these
revolutionary technologies and China

226
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,170
has a national plan to lead the
world in these technologies. By 2050,

227
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:55,230
they're putting huge resources.
They have really smart people.

228
00:12:55,231 --> 00:13:00,060
They are really focused on it and it's
a big deal in genetic technologies.

229
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,260
Um,
uh,

230
00:13:01,261 --> 00:13:05,490
when last year of the book hacking dorm
was already in production in November

231
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:08,100
when it was announced that these first
genetically engineered babies had been

232
00:13:08,101 --> 00:13:10,690
born in China.
And so I called the publisher and say,

233
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:13,260
we need to pull this back out of
production. So I need to reference this.

234
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:17,100
But it didn't require much of a chain
because I'd already written this is

235
00:13:17,101 --> 00:13:19,830
happening. We're going to see the
world's first gene edited humans.

236
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,600
It's going to happen first in China.
And here's why. So I just had a, had a,

237
00:13:23,601 --> 00:13:28,530
had to add a few sentences saying, and it
just happened in October of, uh, of 2018.

238
00:13:28,531 --> 00:13:33,531
So China is on that path and we
need to recognize that on one hand,

239
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:38,670
the United States needs to be competitive.
On the other hand,

240
00:13:38,671 --> 00:13:42,450
we don't want a runaway
arms race of the human race,

241
00:13:42,451 --> 00:13:46,200
and that's why we need to find this
balance between national ambition, uh,

242
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:49,680
and some kind of of global rules.
But it's really hard to do.

243
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,870
Yeah. And the other thing is that
we're competing with them. Yeah.

244
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:58,670
And so if they decide to do at first
were almost compelled to do it second or

245
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,440
compelled to try to keep up.
Yeah.

246
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,240
How far away do you think we are from
physically manipulating living human

247
00:14:05,241 --> 00:14:08,920
beings versus fetuses versus

248
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,550
think in the physically
manipulating living human
beings? We are there, so, yeah.

249
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:18,190
Yeah. So that that's, it may often, it's,
it's called gene therapy. So for example,

250
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,720
there's a whole class of,
of treatments for, uh,

251
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,900
for treating cancer called car t therapy.

252
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,990
So you have a cancer when you're younger,

253
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,700
your body is better able to fight cancers.
Um, what you can do some of the cancer,

254
00:14:30,701 --> 00:14:33,490
you take their cells,
you give there,

255
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:37,510
you manipulate their cells to give them
cancer fighting superpowers and you put

256
00:14:37,511 --> 00:14:41,950
them back into the person's body and now
the person's body behaves like you're a

257
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,810
younger person.
You have the ability to fight back.

258
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:45,490
So gene therapies are already happening.

259
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,210
A relatively small number of
them have already been approved,

260
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,070
but there is a list of thousands of

261
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,850
them with regulators in applications
to regulators around the world.

262
00:14:55,851 --> 00:15:00,851
So that the era of gin making genetic
changes to living humans that's already

263
00:15:01,371 --> 00:15:03,740
here. Like what can they
do with it? So far? So,

264
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:08,510
so far most of it is focused
on treating diseases. Um,

265
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,190
but a lot more is a, is coming because
when people think about the, the human,

266
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,160
the genome,
our genome isn't a disease genome.

267
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,650
It's not a healthcare genome genome.
It's a human genome.

268
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:22,910
And so we are going to be able to do
things that feel like crazy things like

269
00:15:22,911 --> 00:15:27,020
changing people's eye color, changing
people's skin color to funky things.

270
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:28,250
I mean there's a lot of of room,

271
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,880
there weren't stuff that we're
not doing now that we will be, uh,

272
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,700
be able to do and anything we are
from something like that, 10 years.

273
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,720
So in 10 years we're going to have
green people if in, if someone,

274
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:42,470
so if someone's who chooses and if it's,
we'll be able to go back to normal car.

275
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,490
Well if it's, that's a good question. Um,

276
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,750
if it's with this kind of gene therapy
and it's a small number of genes

277
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:50,781
probably,

278
00:15:50,781 --> 00:15:54,320
but we are messing with very complex
systems that we don't fully understand it.

279
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:55,660
So that's why there's a lot of unknowns.

280
00:15:55,661 --> 00:15:58,280
And coming back to your point
on regulation, that's why we,

281
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,190
I don't think we want a total
free for all. We're feels, hey,

282
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,990
I'm going to edit my own jeans.
You don't want some backyard hustler.

283
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,310
Yeah, it's true lab. It's
true. Cause they, you were
saying about the hulk. I mean,

284
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:13,490
I just think that there are all kinds of,
you know, we're humans, we're diverse.

285
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:17,040
Any kind of thing that you can think of.
There is a range and there's, you know,

286
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,020
crazy on the left and crazy on
the ride and crazy at the top.

287
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,950
And so people are going to want
to do things. And the question is,

288
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:24,290
if for any society,

289
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:28,040
what do we think is okay and
what do we think is not okay?

290
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,200
And maybe there should be some,

291
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,150
I believe there should be some
limit to how far people can go with

292
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,900
experimenting, certainly,
possibly likely on themselves,

293
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,610
certainly on their future children.
Certainly on the future children. Yeah.

294
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,940
But once you're 18, I think, do whatever
the fuck you want. If you really,

295
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,260
well maybe 25,
25,

296
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,830
we're going to have a lot of 25
year olds with Gills. It's like,

297
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,220
it's like the tattoo seemed like a good
idea. Yeah. Well we probably will. Um,

298
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,660
so you think we're probably like 50
years away from that being a reality.

299
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,730
So I think that we are,
we,

300
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:09,440
the genetic revolution has already begun
and it's going to fundamentally change

301
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,890
our lives in in three big areas.
The first is our healthcare,

302
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,400
so we're moving from a system of
generalized healthcare based on population

303
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,020
averages so that when
you go to your doctor,

304
00:17:18,021 --> 00:17:21,770
you're treated because you're a human
just based on average and we're moving to

305
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:25,730
a world of personalized medicine and the
foundation of your personalized health

306
00:17:25,731 --> 00:17:28,670
care will be your sequence genome
in your electronic health records.

307
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:32,960
That's how they know you are you and
that's what they can say, this is a drug,

308
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:35,720
this is an intervention that will
work for you. When we do that,

309
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,750
then we're going to have
to sequence everybody.

310
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:41,540
So we're going to have about 2 billion
people have had their whole genome

311
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,600
sequenced,
a within a within a decade,

312
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,260
and then we're going to be able to compare
what the genes say to how those are

313
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:50,400
expressed and then

314
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,970
humans become a big data set and that's
going to move us from precision to

315
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:57,660
predictive healthcare where you're going
to be just born and you're going to

316
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,570
have all this information or your parents
have all this stuff about how certain

317
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:02,970
really important aspects of
your life are going to play on.

318
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:05,220
Some of that is going
to be disease-related,

319
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,200
but some of that's going
to be life related.

320
00:18:07,201 --> 00:18:10,560
Like you have a better than average
chance of being really great at math or

321
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:12,090
having a high Iq,

322
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,900
low Iq or being a great sprinter
and how do we think about that?

323
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,930
And then again,
a revolution that's already happening,

324
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,970
we're going is going to
change the way we make babies.

325
00:18:20,971 --> 00:18:25,560
We're going to get away from sex as
the primary mechanism for conceiving.

326
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:28,410
Our kids will still have sex
for all the great reasons we do.

327
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,030
And that's going to open up a
whole new world of a gist of how,

328
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:37,740
of applying science to what it means
to be a human with a lot of new

329
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,460
possibilities.

330
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,850
That's what's going to be so freaky when
people stop having sex to my kids and

331
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,300
they make friends in the lab. Every
kid's made in the lab when not only that,

332
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:49,290
I think we're going to move to an era,
an era where people who have,

333
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:54,210
who make babies through sex
will be seen as taking a risk,

334
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,810
kind of like people who don't vaccinate
their kids where it's natural.

335
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,080
Tonight it's more natural to not
vaccinate your kids then to do it,

336
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:05,070
but people say, wait a second, you're
taking on a risk on behalf of your kids.

337
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:09,780
About 3% of all kids in the world are
born with some kind of harmful genetic

338
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:13,740
abnormality using in vitro
fertilization and embryo screening.

339
00:19:13,741 --> 00:19:18,300
That 3% can be brought down significantly
and what happens if you see somebody

340
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:22,560
20 years from now who has a kid with
one of those preventable diseases?

341
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:26,520
Do you think that's fate already? Think
well on, wait a second. Those parents,

342
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,590
they made an ideological decision about
how they want it to conceive their kids.

343
00:19:31,591 --> 00:19:35,440
So I think we're moving towards some
really deep and fundamental changes. Hmm.

344
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,310
Well, yeah, that's,

345
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,970
that's an interesting
conversation of whether or not

346
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,760
you wonder what if we're ever going to
get to a point where people don't allow

347
00:19:47,761 --> 00:19:51,270
people sort of like, people don't allow
people to not get vaccinated. Right.

348
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
And like there's a lot of
that going on today, right?

349
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,230
Which is great, right? You don't
want diseases floating around.

350
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,420
But what if that gets to the place
where we do that with people,

351
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,850
with people creating new life
forms? What have you say, hey,

352
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,990
you aren't being irresponsible. You're
just having sex and having a kid. Yeah,

353
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,830
I know that's your grandma did it. We
don't do it that way in 2099. Yeah.

354
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,340
I think it's going to be hard to do that
in a society like the United States,

355
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,090
but in a country like North Korea, they'll
be able to do that. Or if a country,

356
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:24,450
if they said, look, um, you can
make babies however you want,

357
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:29,970
but if you make babies the old fashioned
way and if you have some kind of

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,390
genetic you, your kid has some kind of
genetic disorder that was preventable,

359
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,120
we're just not going to
cover it with insurance.

360
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:40,410
So you're going to have a
$10 million lifetime bill.

361
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,320
You don't need to,
you don't need to require something.

362
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:46,580
You can create an environment where
people's behaviors will change.

363
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:50,350
And then there, there will be increasing
social pressures. I mean, right now,

364
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,020
you know,

365
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,250
somebody sees some little kid riding
around their bicycle without a helmet.

366
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,680
They're kind of looking at the
parents like, Hey, what are you doing?

367
00:20:56,681 --> 00:20:58,690
How come you're, you're, you
don't have a helmet on your kids.

368
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,370
And I just think that we're moving
toward this kind of societal change where

369
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:06,910
people will, I believe, see, uh,

370
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,050
conceiving their kids in the lab
as a safer, safer alternative.

371
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:13,300
And it's not just safety.
Because once you do that,

372
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,930
then that opens you up to the
possibility of all other kinds of,

373
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,050
of applications of,
of technology.

374
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:25,000
Not just not just to eliminate
risks or prevent disease,

375
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:29,250
but you have a lot more information.
So already it's possible to,

376
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,860
to roughly rank order 15
preimplantation embryos,

377
00:21:32,861 --> 00:21:37,861
tallest to shortest in a
decade from highest a genetic
component of Iq to lowest

378
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:41,440
genetic component of Iq. I mean this
stuff is very real and it's very personal.

379
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,650
What do you think will be the first
thing that people start manipulating?

380
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,890
I think certainly health health is,

381
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,720
will be the primary driver because that's
every parents biggest fear and that's,

382
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,840
that is what is going to be
kind of the entry application.

383
00:21:55,841 --> 00:22:00,700
People wanting to make sure that their
kids don't suffer from terrible genetic

384
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,140
diseases. And then I think the
second will probably be longevity.

385
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:07,580
Me Right now there's a lot of work going,
uh,

386
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,150
they're going on sequencing people,

387
00:22:10,151 --> 00:22:14,380
the super agers people who live to their
late nineties people do a hundred to

388
00:22:14,381 --> 00:22:17,590
identify what are the genetic
patterns that these people have.

389
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:20,830
So it's like to live to 90, you have
to do all the things that you advocate,

390
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:23,020
healthy living and whatever.
But to live to into a hundred,

391
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:25,450
you really need the genetics
to make that possible.

392
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:29,440
So we're going to identify what are some
of the genetic patterns that allow you

393
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:32,830
to live those kinds of, of long
lines. But then after that,

394
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,600
then it's wide open. I mean it's,
it's higher genetic component of Iq,

395
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,740
outgoing personality, faster
sprinter. I mean we are humans,

396
00:22:41,741 --> 00:22:46,741
we are primarily genetic beings and
we're going to be able to look under the

397
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:51,780
hood of what it means to be human and
we'll have these incredible choices. And,

398
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:53,440
and we have,
it's a huge responsibility.

399
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,050
How long do you think before
we have a person with forearms?

400
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,310
I think it's going to take a long time.
Couple hundred years. Well, the thing is,

401
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,870
here's how I see it. So the real driver,
there's two, two primary drivers.

402
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:08,560
One will be embryo
selection. Um, so right now,

403
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:13,490
average woman going through IVF
has about 15 eggs extracted. Um,

404
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,300
and then in IVF,
in vitro fertilization,

405
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,330
those eggs are fertilized using the male
sperm and an average male ejaculation,

406
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,740
there's about a billion sperms. So, so
men are just given it away. Women now,

407
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:29,620
human female mammals are a little bit,
or a little bit stingy,

408
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,810
but then the next killer application
is using a process called induced

409
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:36,400
pluripotent stem cells.

410
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:40,750
And so Shinya Yamanaka these
great a Japanese scientist
won the 2012 Nobel prize

411
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:44,560
for developing a way to turn
any adult cell into a stem cell.

412
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:48,860
So a stem cells are kind of cell, it
can be anything. Um, and so you take,

413
00:23:48,861 --> 00:23:52,310
let's say a skin graft
that has millions of cells.

414
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,190
You induce those,
those adult skin cells into stem cells.

415
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:00,350
You use these four things called
Yamanaka factors. And so now you have,

416
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,070
let's call it a hundred
thousand stem cells,

417
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,220
and then you can induce those cells
into egg precursor cells and then eggs.

418
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,760
So all of a sudden humans are creating
eggs like salmon on this huge scale.

419
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:16,220
So you have 100,000 eggs,

420
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:21,020
fertilize them with the male sperm
in a machine and automated process.

421
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:26,020
You grow them for about five days and
then you sequence cells extracted from

422
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,620
each one of those.

423
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:32,650
And the cost of genome sequencing in
2003 it was $1 billion and now it's $800

424
00:24:33,261 --> 00:24:35,840
it's going to be next to
nothing within a decade.

425
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:40,160
And then you have real options cause then
you get this of this whole spreadsheet

426
00:24:40,161 --> 00:24:43,790
and algorithm and then you
go to the parents. They will,
what are your priorities?

427
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:48,260
And maybe they'll say, well I want
health, I want longevity, I want high Iq.

428
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:51,470
When you're choosing from big numbers
like that, you have some real options.

429
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,760
And then on top of that,

430
00:24:52,761 --> 00:24:56,670
then there is this precision gene
editing the stuff that happened in,

431
00:24:56,671 --> 00:24:58,060
in China last year.
And I think it will,

432
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:01,220
it will be in the re coming back
to your question about forearms,

433
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,480
I think it's going to be varied.

434
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,130
People have this idea that
tools like CRISPR going abused,

435
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,640
someone's going to sit at a computer and
say like forearms and three heads and

436
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,160
wings and whatever. But it's
pretty hard because, um,

437
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:17,780
human biology is incredibly complicated
and we, we, we always know more,

438
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,880
um,
the worth,

439
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,240
the very beginning of understanding the
full complexity of human biology enough

440
00:25:23,241 --> 00:25:24,680
to make these big kind of changes.

441
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:27,500
But if you're choosing from
100,000 fertilized eggs,

442
00:25:27,501 --> 00:25:30,170
those are all your natural kids.
Yeah.

443
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,220
And then you would get the best of
that and then work on those. Exactly.

444
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,130
And that's exactly the amount. And you
get that. And then you say, all right,

445
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:42,160
what if you had like 20 sons that were
awesome and they didn't tell you about 18

446
00:25:42,351 --> 00:25:47,120
of them and you kept two of them than
18 of them shipped off to some military

447
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:49,940
industrial complex. Yeah.
Turned them into assassins.

448
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,390
Any kind of crazy thing you can
think of. That's the problem, right?

449
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,080
It's all this stuff will be possible.
And so, and a lot of technologies,

450
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,210
you can imagine all kinds of crazy stuff.

451
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:03,050
And that's coming back to your earlier
point about regulation is we want to live

452
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,670
in regulated environments.
I mean,

453
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:07,700
so like now think of the Internet and heal
in the beginning days of the Internet.

454
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:11,870
People Thought, oh, just let the Internet
be let you know, just let it play out.

455
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,010
It's going to liberate all of us.

456
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:17,870
And now China's showing how the Internet
can be actually be really actively used

457
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:19,540
to suppress people.
Facebook is,

458
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,910
is taking people's information in
Google in a way that's frightening.

459
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:24,080
A lot of people and peers are saying,
hey,

460
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,930
it shouldn't be that these
companies can do whatever they want.

461
00:26:26,931 --> 00:26:31,610
We have to have some way of establishing
limits because not every individual is

462
00:26:31,611 --> 00:26:34,460
able to entirely protect themselves.
They don't have the power,

463
00:26:34,461 --> 00:26:35,690
they don't have all the information.

464
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,490
We need some representatives helping us
with the real concern is the competition.

465
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,340
Right? The real concern is whether or not
we do something with reg in regards to

466
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:45,000
regulation.

467
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,510
That's somehow another stifles competition
on our end and doesn't allow us to

468
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:51,870
compete with Russia and
China, particularly China.
Yeah, that's exactly right.

469
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:55,320
And so, um, what we need to
do is to find that balance.

470
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,770
And one of the big issues,
uh, for this is privacy.

471
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,130
So if you kind of look around the world,
I'd say there's of the,

472
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,630
of the kind of the big countries
in groupings of countries,

473
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,180
there's three models of privacy.
There's Europe,

474
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:09,720
which has the strongest privacy
protections for all kinds of data,

475
00:27:09,721 --> 00:27:11,160
including genetic,
did a data.

476
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:16,260
There's China that has the weakest and
there's the United States that has the

477
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,190
middle. And the paradox is
from an individual perspective,

478
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,330
we are all are thinking,

479
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:25,200
well we kind of want to be like Europe
because I don't want somebody accessing

480
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,690
my personal information,
especially my genetic information.

481
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,940
This is like my most intimate information.

482
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,830
But genetics is the
ultimate big data problem.

483
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,510
And so you need these big data pools
and you'd access to the these big data

484
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:42,750
pools in order to unlock
the secrets of genetics.

485
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:44,340
So these three different groupings,

486
00:27:44,341 --> 00:27:48,150
everyone's making a huge bet on the
future and the way we're going to know who

487
00:27:48,151 --> 00:27:49,710
wins.
Like right now in the,

488
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:54,711
in the it world we have Amazon and apple
and Google and those big companies,

489
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:56,370
but whoever gets this bet,
right?

490
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,730
They will be the ones who will be leading
the way and making a huge amount of of

491
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,160
money on these technologies
because we were talking about is,

492
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,290
is trillion multi-trillion
dollar industry.

493
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,500
How do you think this is going to affect
things like competitive athletics?

494
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,180
Hugely. So, um, right now,
um, we have this problem,

495
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:18,860
someone like Lance Armstrong cause he
was doing, he's manipulating his, uh,

496
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:23,870
his body and what he's basically doing
is adding more red blood cells so that he

497
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:28,200
can carry more oxygen and people feel
that that's cheating. And it's a,

498
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:31,140
it's a different topic that probably
everybody in the Tour de France was doing

499
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:35,010
exactly that when he, when
he went. Um, but what if it,

500
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:36,150
which will be the case,

501
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,860
we're going to be able to sequence the
people would say nobody's doing drugs and

502
00:28:40,861 --> 00:28:42,210
we sequence all these athletes,

503
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,110
some of them will just have
a natural genetic advantage.

504
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,040
Their bodies will naturally be doing
what Lamstar Lance Armstrong had

505
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,760
manipulated his body to. Do
you know, that's happening
with a sprinter right now?

506
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,180
Yeah. Well that females prints this has
high levels of testosterone. Yeah. No.

507
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:02,830
And it's, and I feel really sorry for
her, but we have categories. I mean, yeah,

508
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:05,610
you with your world and
in mixed martial arts,

509
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,850
I mean I think I remembered in the
past there was some person who has,

510
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,960
who was kind of a borderline,
uh,

511
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:16,770
between genders and was just kicking the
shit out of all of these women in cage

512
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:17,160
fighting.

513
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,450
It's like we have these categories of
man and woman and we know that the gender

514
00:29:21,451 --> 00:29:23,310
identities are,
are fluid.

515
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,740
But how do we think about it when these
genetic differences confer advantages?

516
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:33,340
So if your body is primed to do something,
um,

517
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:38,130
maybe you could have like a Plato's
republic world where everybody fulfills a

518
00:29:38,131 --> 00:29:42,370
function that you are
genetically optimized to and
that you could imagine that

519
00:29:42,371 --> 00:29:45,490
being a very competitive kind of a,
of environment.

520
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,060
But what do you do if for now
in something like the Olympics,

521
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:51,010
if somebody has this
huge genetic advantage,

522
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:53,890
should we let somebody else
manipulate their bodies?

523
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:58,600
There's this thing called gene doping in
order to change the expression of genes,

524
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:02,890
so your body to act like
you're as Jeanette naturally
genetic enhances somebody

525
00:30:02,891 --> 00:30:03,850
else.
It's complicated.

526
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:08,910
Are they capable of doing certain
physical enhancements through gene doping

527
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,710
right now? Like what can they
do right now known as? So,

528
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:13,590
so the way it works is so your,

529
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:18,200
your genes instruct your cells
to make proteins. That's, that's,

530
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:20,410
that's how the whole system works.

531
00:30:20,411 --> 00:30:25,411
So you can change genes or you can trigger
the expression of proteins so you can

532
00:30:27,251 --> 00:30:32,170
get people's bodies to
behave as if they had the,

533
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,830
these periodic optimization. Yeah.
Yeah. And so that's why now the,

534
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:38,380
the world antidoping agency,
I mean,

535
00:30:38,381 --> 00:30:43,240
they are now starting to look
at gene doping and this is
the first time, uh, that,

536
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,640
that's, that that's even being
considered as a category.

537
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:48,580
And then there are other people that
have done that or other people that have

538
00:30:48,581 --> 00:30:51,610
done that successfully. You know,
I don't know the answer to that.

539
00:30:51,611 --> 00:30:54,310
I know that water is looking for it,

540
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:58,140
which makes me assume that it must
have done, but I haven't seen it.

541
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,000
I've looked for it. I haven't
seen any reports. Kind of
starts winning everything,

542
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,530
which know is so, so my, my, I wrote
my, uh, one of my Psi Phi novels.

543
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,810
Genesis code was about this.
So China as you know,

544
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,960
has their system of their
Olympic sports goals.

545
00:31:10,961 --> 00:31:14,680
And the way it works is they
test kids all around the country.

546
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:16,030
So let's just say it's,

547
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,260
it's diving and they identify what
are the core skills of a diver,

548
00:31:20,261 --> 00:31:21,094
what do you need?

549
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,100
And then they go around the country and
they test kids and then they bring a

550
00:31:24,101 --> 00:31:27,650
bunch of them to the Olympic sports
schools, uh, and then they, you know,

551
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:31,300
they get them all involved and then some
kids are the best of those kids and the

552
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:34,300
best of those kids. And then you get with
these champs, that's why China advanced.

553
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:38,740
So, uh, so rapidly. But what
happens if they're doing that?

554
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,700
But it's at the genetic level and there
are countries like Kazakhstan that are

555
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,970
already announcing that they are going
to be screening all of their athletes so

556
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,210
that the science isn't there yet.
So it's really,

557
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:51,700
it's impossible right now to say,
well,

558
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:55,240
I'm going to do a genome sequence of
somebody and I know this person has the

559
00:31:55,241 --> 00:31:57,370
potential to be an Olympic sprinter,

560
00:31:57,670 --> 00:31:59,650
but 10 years from now that's
not going to be the case.

561
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,590
Wow.
Yeah.

562
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:05,490
It's sort of going to throw a monkey
wrench into the whole idea of what is fair

563
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:10,270
when it comes to athletics. Yeah. What is
fair? What is human? What is human? Yeah.

564
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,280
I mean,
look,

565
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,990
it's not like people don't already
alter their bodies by training,

566
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:20,930
by diet, exercise, all sorts of
different recovery modalities,

567
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,870
cryotherapy, song, uh,
all of it. Um, you know,

568
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:26,520
a high elevation training,

569
00:32:26,521 --> 00:32:29,670
all these different things that they
do that manipulates the human body,

570
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:35,660
but it's not like it would be kind of
crazy if you had sports but you couldn't

571
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:37,170
practice and he couldn't work out.

572
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,920
Like we want to find out what a
person's really like. No practice,

573
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,140
no working out. And that's the thing.
It's like we are moving, it comes back to,

574
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:47,600
we were saying before about nature.
It's like we have this,

575
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:51,320
this feeling nature somehow
feels comfortable to us.

576
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:53,280
That's what we're used to with all
this stuff that you're talking about.

577
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:57,180
But nobody was doing that 10,000 years
ago. It's like, Hey, I'm, you know, I'm,

578
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:59,330
I'm running after a buffalo and,

579
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,930
and so and so as these boundaries change
as the realm of possibility changes,

580
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,410
then we're going to be faced
with all of these questions.

581
00:33:09,411 --> 00:33:12,350
Even now look at a sport like
competitive weightlifting.

582
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
I know they have these like the,

583
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:19,250
the real competitive bodybuilding
and you see these guys and they're,

584
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,120
they're monsters and then they have
these drug free guys and everybody looks

585
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:26,930
like a Yogi.
And then it looks still a pretty big,

586
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,630
pretty big but not compared to these,
these other guys.

587
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,500
The only way to get those freak levels,
it's just a romance.

588
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:36,980
And so like how are we
going to police this?

589
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:38,510
And I think it's going
to be very difficult.

590
00:33:38,511 --> 00:33:43,130
And so maybe we can have some
kind of natural area of life,

591
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:48,050
but I think that our, our model of
what's normal is just going to change.

592
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:49,100
Cause,
like I was saying in the beginning,

593
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:53,750
we set our baseline based on how we
grew up and that it seems about right,

594
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:58,100
like it seems about right to us
that everybody gets immunizations.

595
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,840
But immunizations are a form of
superpower. Imagine if our ancestors,

596
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:03,620
they couldn't even imagine immunizations.

597
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:07,820
What an unfair advantage when you
have 100 million people dying of,

598
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,040
of Spanish flu.
So we're with this,

599
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:12,800
all this stuff is scary and
it's going to normalize.

600
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,340
But how it normalizes is,
is that's what's it playing now?

601
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,950
Well the world has changed so
much just in the last 20 years,

602
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:22,370
but it feels like this is just scratching
the surface in comparison to what's

603
00:34:22,371 --> 00:34:23,730
coming.
It was a,

604
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:29,350
people miss understand and they
underestimate the rate of change.

605
00:34:29,841 --> 00:34:33,560
And the reason that they do that is
since the beginning of the digital

606
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:34,394
revolution,

607
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,940
we have experienced the thing called
exponential changes that you've heard of

608
00:34:37,941 --> 00:34:41,570
Moore's law, which is basically computing
power roughly doubles every two years.

609
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,720
And we've internalized Moore's law.

610
00:34:44,721 --> 00:34:48,740
And that means that every new iPhone
we expect to be better and stronger and

611
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:52,070
faster and all these kinds of things.
But now we're entering in a world,

612
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:56,240
a world where we're going to have
exponential change across technology

613
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,270
platforms.
And so we think about,

614
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:02,750
well what does exponential change
mean in the context of biology? Well,

615
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,921
at the very,

616
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:08,921
very beginning it's genome sequencing is
is is going to be basically a basically

617
00:35:09,051 --> 00:35:12,650
free,
but we're going to be able to change life.

618
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,630
And because we're on this j curve,

619
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,110
like when you think of what's a 10 year
unit of change looking in the in the

620
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,010
rear view mirror,

621
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:22,700
that amount of change is only going to
take five years going forward and then

622
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,470
two years and then one year.

623
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,530
And so that's the reason why
I've written this book as I,

624
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,490
as we have to get that this
stuff is coming fast and if
we want to be part of it,

625
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,000
we have to understand it and we
have to make our voices heard.

626
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,830
What makes you nervous about
this? Alright, three big areas.

627
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:45,260
First humans and all advice.
Incredibly complex.

628
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,320
May We talk about genetic code,
which is mindbogglingly complex,

629
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:53,700
but our genetics exists
within the incredible,

630
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:58,730
incredibly complex systems biology. We
have all these things like our microbiome,

631
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,740
our virome are proteome are metabolome
and then that exists within the context

632
00:36:03,751 --> 00:36:07,050
of our environment and everything's
always changing and, and interacting.

633
00:36:07,051 --> 00:36:11,400
And so we are messing and we have the
tools to mess and we will mess because

634
00:36:11,401 --> 00:36:16,140
we're this hubristic species with
these really complex ecosystems,

635
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:19,200
including ourselves. We don't fully
understand. That's number one. Two,

636
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:23,550
when you mentioned it before, this issue
of, of equity, what happens if we have,

637
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,580
every technology has to have first
adopters. If you don't have it,

638
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:27,630
you never get the technology.

639
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:31,800
But what happens if a group of people
move much more quickly than other people,

640
00:36:31,801 --> 00:36:35,340
whether it's real or not, even if they
believe it's real. You could imagine big,

641
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,940
dangerous societal changes.
And the third big area is diversity.

642
00:36:38,941 --> 00:36:40,080
And we think about diversity.

643
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:44,340
We think why it's great to have diverse
workplaces and schools and and we're

644
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:47,730
more better people for it
and we're more competitive.

645
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,350
The diversity is something much,
much, much deeper. In Darwinian terms,

646
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:54,360
diversity is random mutation.

647
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:58,050
Like that's our core survival strategy
as a species. If we didn't have that,

648
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:01,140
you could say we distilled be single
cell organisms, but we wouldn't,

649
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,560
we would have died because the environment
would have changed and we wouldn't

650
00:37:04,561 --> 00:37:07,620
have had the builtin
resilience to a doubt. Yeah.

651
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:10,130
That is really important when you
think about diversity, right? Yeah.

652
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:14,700
We need a non uniformity when it
comes to our own biology. Yeah.

653
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:17,640
Because he'd a bunch of different kinds
of people. We have to have it big as,

654
00:37:17,641 --> 00:37:21,750
even if we optimize for this
world, um, the world will change.

655
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:23,430
There's no good and bad in evolution.

656
00:37:23,431 --> 00:37:25,890
There's just well suited for
a particular environment.

657
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:30,270
If that environment changes the best
suited person for your old environment,

658
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:33,210
maybe the least suited
person for the new insurance.

659
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:36,990
So even if we have things that seem real,
like really great ideas now,

660
00:37:36,991 --> 00:37:40,710
like optimizing health.
So if you have sickle cell disease,

661
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,370
you're probably going to die and you're
going to die young and it's going to be

662
00:37:44,371 --> 00:37:47,760
excruciating, excruciatingly
painful. And so he would say, well,

663
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:50,580
let's just get rid of sickle cell disease,
which we can do.

664
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:56,090
But if you are a recessive carrier of the
[inaudible] of the sickle cell disease

665
00:37:56,851 --> 00:37:59,070
gene, you don't have it.
You're just carrying it.

666
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,790
You have a pretty significant risk
of passing it on to your kids,

667
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,600
but you also have an additional
resistance to malaria.

668
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,760
And so we are probably are almost
certainly carrying around all kinds of

669
00:38:11,761 --> 00:38:16,440
recessive traits, maybe even ones that we
don't like that are harming us now. Um,

670
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,820
but that could be some protection against
some future danger that we don't yet

671
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,470
understand or how or haven't faced.

672
00:38:22,471 --> 00:38:26,370
And so the challenge is that diversity
has just happened to us for 4 billion

673
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:30,090
years now we're going to have
to choose it. And that's a big,

674
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,650
it's a big challenge for us.
So essentially we were going to have,

675
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,070
without some

676
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,940
unintended consequences,
some unintended domino effect,

677
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,250
things that are going to take
place that we really can't predict.

678
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,930
We just have to kind of go along with
this technology and see where it leads us

679
00:38:49,931 --> 00:38:50,830
as it improves.

680
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:55,240
Like if you go back and look at surgeries
from the 1950s comparison to surgery

681
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:58,480
of 2019 giant leaps.
I mean,

682
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:02,350
I would never advise someone to get
their knee operated by a 1950s physician.

683
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,940
Right, right. Yeah. Right.

684
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:07,990
But that's kind of someone's going to
have to be an early adopter when it comes

685
00:39:07,991 --> 00:39:11,200
to these genetic therapies.
Yeah, no. So I, I agree with you,

686
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,300
but where I would slightly agree,

687
00:39:13,301 --> 00:39:17,170
I would add to what you're saying is these
technologies, they're going to happen,

688
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,550
they're going to play out what's at play
now is not where these technologies are

689
00:39:21,551 --> 00:39:23,470
going to advance. They will, it will do,

690
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,040
they will advance in a way that is
going to just blow people's minds.

691
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:31,570
What's it play is what are the values
that we are going to weave in to the

692
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:36,190
decision making process so that we can
get a better outcome than we otherwise

693
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:39,190
would have had. And that that's
what, in my view, that's the real,

694
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,200
the important issue now.
Yeah.

695
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:46,440
Unintended consequences are something
that I've been taken very seriously lately

696
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:49,840
when I'm paying attention
to technology as a,

697
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:54,570
as it's used in social media,
particularly. Uh, the one,

698
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,480
one of the things is disturbed me quite
a bit over the last few weeks is that

699
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:01,810
there's a model that they
use and not intentionally,

700
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:06,220
but there's a model that they use to
get people upset about things. Yeah.

701
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:11,520
Show you things in your feed that you
argue against because that makes you click

702
00:40:12,191 --> 00:40:14,350
on the more and engage in them more.

703
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:19,010
And because of the fact that we have
this advertiser based model where people

704
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:22,630
were trying to get clicks because they
want to get ads on their page and the

705
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:25,240
more clicks they get,
the more money they get from those ads.

706
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:28,120
And so they want to
incentivize people to go there.

707
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:30,130
And the best way through
the algorithm would,

708
00:40:30,131 --> 00:40:33,700
what they've found without doing it
on purpose is to get people upset and

709
00:40:33,701 --> 00:40:37,330
they're pushing people into these little
information ghettos that are really

710
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:38,320
dangerous.
Right.

711
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:42,880
And we've gotten to this point where this
is just an accepted part of our lives.

712
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,260
Did you go to check your Google feed
or your Facebook feed and the, Oh boy,

713
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,500
what the fuck are they doing?
Is this real? They're going
to pass this, God dammit.

714
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:54,970
And then he'd get mad and then you engage
with people online and then it results

715
00:40:54,971 --> 00:40:58,720
in more revenue.
But getting them to stop that,

716
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,640
if you had to go to Facebook and say,
hey,

717
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,180
hey mark Zuckerberg or now you have
fucking $100 billion, whatever you got,

718
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,190
but you can't make any
more money this way. Right.

719
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,990
Because what you're doing
is fucking up society.

720
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,000
Cause you're encouraging dissent,

721
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:14,890
you're encouraging people to be upset and
arguments and you're doing it at great

722
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:19,210
financial reward but great societal
costs. Yeah. So stop. Yeah.

723
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,450
And he's so do it. Right.
Well he may not do it.

724
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,040
That comes back to the point about
regulation and the question is how big is

725
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:27,250
your stick? And one of the guys who
was the founder of [inaudible] is yes,

726
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,980
is now coming out and saying, hey,
Facebook needs to be broken up.

727
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,410
And then he was one of the
original founders and he's like,

728
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:36,710
it has gotten so far out of hand.
It's so far away from where it is.

729
00:41:36,711 --> 00:41:39,830
It's literally affecting global politics.
Yeah.

730
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:40,761
Well it is.

731
00:41:40,761 --> 00:41:44,600
And so one option is to break it up
that it seems to have worked pretty well

732
00:41:44,601 --> 00:41:49,010
with at and T. Um, another option
is to regulate it, which I is,

733
00:41:49,011 --> 00:41:52,430
act in my mind would be a better approach.
And that is to say,

734
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,670
here's what's okay and
here's what's not okay.

735
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,290
And this stuff is really intricate.

736
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,890
You have to really get down
beneath these algorithms,

737
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:03,710
which are unbelievably complex.
But you're exactly right. I mean,

738
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:08,330
what we're seeing now is we are being
pushed into it. I said inflammation,

739
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:12,410
ghettos, but it's like
information barricades and
so pushed into camps. And so,

740
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:16,470
and it's so dangerous because the old,
I mean this,

741
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:19,580
this country is based on
not everybody agreeing,

742
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,370
but having a process where people come
and they work it out and they say,

743
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:24,980
you know,
I'm not perfectly happy with this outcome,

744
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:30,140
but here's a compromise and if we can't
compromise and our civic culture is

745
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:31,790
going to break down and there's so much,
I mean,

746
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,430
people don't see these pillars
that are holding up our society.

747
00:42:34,431 --> 00:42:38,150
I'd lived in Cambodia for two years and
if you don't have these civic pillars

748
00:42:38,151 --> 00:42:41,720
under your society, society's
look very, very different.

749
00:42:41,721 --> 00:42:44,120
Everyone's life experiences.
V We kind of take for granted.

750
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:45,020
You can go out the door,

751
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:50,021
walk to Starbucks and not get
shot or a you can have your house.

752
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,770
Something happened,
your house gets robbed.

753
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:56,030
You called the police and
the police aren't the ones
who've robbed your house or

754
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,580
they're not in. I mean there's
all these kinds of crazy things.

755
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:03,080
If we break down the foundations
that underpin our lives,

756
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:03,920
that's really dangerous.

757
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,290
What I was kind of getting at
was that through what this,

758
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:12,390
this process of this algorithm, how this
algorithm selects things for the you,

759
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,450
your feed and how people are getting
upset by this and how this is generating

760
00:43:15,451 --> 00:43:18,840
massive amounts of revenue
once it's already happened.

761
00:43:18,841 --> 00:43:23,460
It's very difficult to stop and my concern
would be that this would be a similar

762
00:43:23,461 --> 00:43:26,790
thing when it comes to genetic
engineering. What we're saying,

763
00:43:26,791 --> 00:43:29,190
we need to be able to
put regulations on this.

764
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:33,090
We needed to be able to establish it.
But once it gets out of the bag,

765
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,980
once it gets rolling,
and I have,

766
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:38,460
you remember when Mark Zuckerberg sat
in front of all those politicians,

767
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:42,240
they had no fucking idea what they were
talking about. You make money as such,

768
00:43:42,241 --> 00:43:44,250
Piss, poor prepares, and it just,

769
00:43:44,251 --> 00:43:46,930
it shows you like these are the
people that are looking out for us.

770
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:51,480
Good fucking luck. These are Luddites.
They're dumb asses. They're fools, right?

771
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:55,260
And they're, they don't know anything
about us. Some are better and worse,

772
00:43:55,261 --> 00:44:00,261
but yet almost everyone was underwhelming
and under impressive in that hearing,

773
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:01,464
in that hearing.
Yeah.

774
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:04,470
The fact that they're dealing with one of
the most important moments of our time,

775
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,510
but they didn't bring on some sort of
a like legitimate technology expert who

776
00:44:09,511 --> 00:44:12,310
could explain it. Pitfalls. Yes.
And do so in a way that the,

777
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,450
the rest of the world's can,
you know,

778
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,210
so they're not going to protect us
from genetic engineering either. Right.

779
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:20,640
Because they're great generalists in terms
of their education for the most part.

780
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:22,920
And they're not, they're
not concerned. This is not,

781
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,110
they're concerned with raising
money for their campaign.

782
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,570
The concern with getting reelected.
That's their concern with,

783
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:28,171
yeah,

784
00:44:28,171 --> 00:44:33,171
I totally agree with you that if we wait
to focus on this issue until it becomes

785
00:44:34,261 --> 00:44:35,010
a crisis,

786
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:38,010
it's going to be too late because all
the big decisions will have been made.

787
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:42,450
The reason why I wrote this book,
the reason why, you know, I'm on my,

788
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,430
it's almost week three of this book
tour doing events like this every day is

789
00:44:47,431 --> 00:44:51,600
what I am saying in every form that
I can is this is really important.

790
00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:53,610
You kind of,
we were watching the news yesterday,

791
00:44:53,611 --> 00:44:57,570
they had this royal baby in in the UK.
Like I don't give a shit.

792
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,080
It doesn't affect my life in any but,

793
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:04,220
but what does it play now is the future
of our entire species and our democracy

794
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:08,940
and our lives and we have to be focusing
on those things because we have a

795
00:45:08,941 --> 00:45:13,941
moment now where we can it to a certain
extent influence how these revolutions

796
00:45:15,151 --> 00:45:17,220
play out.
And if we just wait around,

797
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:20,670
if we're distracted and we're focusing
on all this stuff that's sucking up our

798
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:24,960
attention and whether it's Trump or Brexit
or molar and all these things, I mean,

799
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:28,080
we're spent how much of our time
are we spending focus on this? Fine,

800
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,370
let's pay a little bit of attention,

801
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:32,610
but there's really big stuff 50
years from now, a hundred years,

802
00:45:32,611 --> 00:45:35,400
and no one's going to look back and
now say, oh, that was the age of Trump,

803
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:36,180
or that was,

804
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,380
they're going to say that was the age
when after almost 4 billion years of

805
00:45:40,381 --> 00:45:40,891
evolution,

806
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:44,010
humans took control of their
own evolutionary process
and it's huge and it's

807
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:49,011
going to change all of life and of what
I'm trying to do is to say everybody has

808
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:53,490
to have a seat at the table.
Whether you're a conservative Christian,

809
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,790
whether you're a
biohacking transhumanists,

810
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:01,830
everybody needs to be at the table because
we are talking about is the future of

811
00:46:01,831 --> 00:46:04,410
our species. We're talking
about the future of our species,

812
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,850
but are we even capable of understanding
the consequences of these actions to

813
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,010
the stuff that we're discussing?
Like right now,

814
00:46:11,011 --> 00:46:15,300
I'm not like I'm talking about
it. If someone said, hey,

815
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:19,350
you've got to go speak in front of people
about the consequences of an a very

816
00:46:19,351 --> 00:46:23,090
clear one hour presentation,
I'd be like, no, I'm not. Well,

817
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,540
what I'm talking about one, we can go
together. So you're good. Thank you. Um,

818
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,940
but to the reason why I've written this
book hacking Darwin is I wanted to say

819
00:46:29,941 --> 00:46:31,590
if you could read just one book,

820
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,820
and it's written just for everybody in a
very clear way with a lot of jokes that

821
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,570
I think are funny. My mother laughed
at them as well, that you get it.

822
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:44,250
And then once you know, just the
basics as a human being, anybody,

823
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,550
it has an equal right to be part of this,

824
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,220
of this conversation as
the top scientist or the,

825
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,250
the leaders of any of any countries
that they would agree with you there.

826
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:56,070
But I don't think that other people
are going to see it that way.

827
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,650
I think the people that are in
control, they're not going to say, hey,

828
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:02,040
we need to find it. We need
to be fair with everyone.
All the citizens, the world.

829
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,920
How do you feel we should proceed?
No, but that's why we have to,

830
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,350
that's why we need this
bottom up ground swell.

831
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:10,440
But we can't have a bottom
up ground swell if people,

832
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:14,430
if just general people aren't even
aware of what the issues are and that's,

833
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,480
that's the challenge. And
that's why forums like yours
or are just so important.

834
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:21,330
I mean, you have all of these
people and then you know,

835
00:47:21,331 --> 00:47:24,510
maybe everyone doesn't listen to this
podcast. Say, all right, I get it.

836
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:25,980
I can go give that hour long speech.

837
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:30,580
But you can read a couple books and then
you can give an an hour speech because

838
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,910
the issues like, yes, there
are scientific issues,

839
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,890
but this isn't a
conversation about science.

840
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,140
This is about values and
ethics and our future.

841
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:40,450
And it has to be a conversation
for everybody. Yeah.

842
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,910
It's not just a scientific conversation.

843
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,660
It's a conversation about the future
of the species and the species will be

844
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:51,200
awesome. Yeah. And that's something
we're wholly unqualified. No, it's you,

845
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,070
but here's, here's a little
vote for optimism. Okay.

846
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,210
We have never been this
literate as a species room.

847
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,870
We've never been this educated.

848
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,870
I don't think it was or if we ever
been this nice either. Well I hope so.

849
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:03,850
I really do.
When you look at it,

850
00:48:03,851 --> 00:48:06,860
all the wars and all the murder that
used to happen, it's actually a,

851
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,440
this is the best time ever to be alive.

852
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,980
Still Sucks for people
that are in bad situations,

853
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,790
but it's on average it's better. And we've
never been this connected. So we have,

854
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:16,740
so I,

855
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,350
I'm the book I call for a species wide
dialogue on the future of human genetic

856
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:23,380
engineering. You think of one that's
nuts. 7 billion people on Earth.

857
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:25,270
How are they going to,
how are they going to do that?

858
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:30,640
But we have the opportunity and we
have to try because you don't want,

859
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,950
like with the beginning of the
genetically modified crops era,

860
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,110
the scientists were
actually really responsible,

861
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:39,250
but regular people weren't consulted and
they felt that these guys just did it

862
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:43,300
to me. So if you have all the marchers
with genetically modified organisms,

863
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:47,740
we are entering the era of genetically
modified humans and that's going to scare

864
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,000
the shit out of people.

865
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,150
And so we need to start preparing and
we need to make people feel that they're

866
00:48:52,151 --> 00:48:56,590
respected and included and our government
leaders aren't going to do it for us.

867
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:59,860
So we have to find ways
of engaging ourselves.

868
00:48:59,861 --> 00:49:04,080
And that's why with me with the book, I
set up a website where people can, um,

869
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,300
can share their views,
debate with other people.

870
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,330
I really want everybody to
be part of this conversation.

871
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,660
How do you think it's going to
play out in terms of how people,

872
00:49:13,661 --> 00:49:17,770
various religions perceive this?
Yeah, so there's a real variation.

873
00:49:17,771 --> 00:49:22,771
So there are people on one end of the
spectrum who believe that this is quote

874
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:24,130
unquote playing God.

875
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:29,220
And if you believe that the world was
created exactly as it is by some kind of,

876
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:32,470
uh, of divine force, um,

877
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,070
and that it's wrong for
humans to change to,

878
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:37,840
to quote unquote play God,

879
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:41,680
it's hard to explain how you could
justify everything that we've done.

880
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:45,460
I mean we've changed the face of this,
uh, of life on this planet earth.

881
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,900
But I really respect people who say,
look, I think that there's a line that,

882
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:50,741
you know,
the,

883
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:55,741
I believe that life begins at conception
and that any kind of manipulation after

884
00:49:56,111 --> 00:50:00,250
conception is interfering. That's
going too far. And I respect that. Um,

885
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:03,570
and those people need to
have a seat at the table. Um,

886
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:07,810
and that's in there certainly very
strong religious views in Judaism.

887
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,100
There's an idea called Tikun Olam,
which means that the world is created,

888
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,490
cracked and broken, and it's
the responsibility of each
person to try to fix it.

889
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:19,210
And that's a justification
for using science and doing
things to try to make the

890
00:50:19,211 --> 00:50:22,660
world a better place. And then there
are now these new kind of, I mean,

891
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,620
transhumanism, it's almost like a
religion. It's this religion of science.

892
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,100
And so

893
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,560
we're going to have, we're
humans, we're so diverse.

894
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,460
We are going to have
this level of diversity.

895
00:50:34,461 --> 00:50:38,540
And the challenge is how do we make,
how do we have a process that brings,

896
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:42,590
brings everybody in. But it's, it's tough.
So when we're talking about genetic,

897
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,890
any sort of genetic manipulation,

898
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:49,460
we're basically talking about
doing stuff to the wet ware,

899
00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:51,230
doing stuff to the biology.
Right.

900
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:55,700
What do you think about symbiotic
interactions with technology?

901
00:50:55,810 --> 00:50:59,990
Because one of the things that I'm
concerned with more than anything is this

902
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:04,910
sort of inevitable path of
technology getting into our bodies,

903
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:09,140
whether it's through nanobots fixed
diseases or through implementation.

904
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:11,750
When we were talking yesterday
about chips, right? Like what would,

905
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:14,510
what would they have to do to get you
to get up, put a chip in your body?

906
00:51:14,511 --> 00:51:18,230
Like what, what kind of powers would it
have to have before you accepted it? Yeah.

907
00:51:18,231 --> 00:51:20,190
Well, people already doing
it in Sweden. Yeah, sure.

908
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,310
And so are they doing in
Sweden? Yeah, they're just,

909
00:51:22,311 --> 00:51:25,250
they're putting this little chips in
their hands in there and under their skin

910
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:29,540
and they're using it to open doors and
access things. Um, so it's just starting.

911
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:32,420
So I definitely believe the,
you know, right now you look at,

912
00:51:32,421 --> 00:51:34,700
we look at photographs of
our parents and you like God,

913
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:39,650
look at your hair or your clothes. That's
crazy. Definitely. I think that, you know,

914
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,090
20 years from now,
30 years from now,

915
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,980
people are going to look at
pictures of us and you say,

916
00:51:42,981 --> 00:51:45,080
what's that little rectangular thing?

917
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:48,770
And you're going to say that was a phone
what? And they'll say what it's like,

918
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:52,190
yeah we used to carry it around in
our pocket and like Michael Douglas,

919
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:55,490
when you watch him in that movie Wall
Street, he's got that giant phone.

920
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:59,000
The beach. Exactly. So we are, we are all,

921
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:02,120
we are all Michael Douglas
because our technology,

922
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:05,090
you're absolute right is not going
to be something that we carry around.

923
00:52:05,091 --> 00:52:08,450
It's technology is coming
inside of our bodies.

924
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:12,920
That is the future of where it's going.
And you know, people say, well what,

925
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:17,540
what is human genetic engineering have
to do when we know that AI is going to

926
00:52:17,541 --> 00:52:22,190
get more and more powerful. But the future
of technology feature of all of this,

927
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:26,660
it's not human or AI,
it's human plus Ai.

928
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:28,610
And that is what's going to drive our,

929
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:31,520
we are co evolving with our technology
and that's what's going to drive our

930
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:35,870
drive us forward. But you're exactly
right to be afraid. And to be concerned.

931
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,510
And again, everything has a little,
how are we going to regulate it?

932
00:52:38,511 --> 00:52:41,530
What are we going to have guard rails of,
how far is too far?

933
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,540
We going to let companies
just do whatever they want.

934
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,520
Are we going to put restrictions
on what they can do?

935
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,060
I think letting the whole
world decide though, you're,

936
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:52,550
you're gonna run into those religious
roadblocks if for sure. And that's,

937
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:56,750
and that's the challenge, is that the
science is advancing exponentially.

938
00:52:56,751 --> 00:52:57,770
Whatever we do.

939
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:03,220
And so we have to have our understanding
of the science needs to at least try to

940
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,930
keep pace regulations need to keep up on
part of the World Health Organization,

941
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,720
International Advisory Committee
on human genome editing.

942
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,970
So we're meeting six
times this year in Geneva.

943
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:19,160
And the question that we're asking is
how do we think about global regulation,

944
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:23,870
at least to try to put limits on
the far ends of what's possible.

945
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:26,490
And it's, it's really, really difficult.

946
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,520
But that's why we need to
have this kind of process.

947
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:33,300
And it seems impossibly ambitious,
but every crazy idea,

948
00:53:33,301 --> 00:53:38,040
it has to begin somewhere. So you're
doing every couple months. Yeah. Yes.

949
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:42,720
Wow. Yeah. Cause they'd want to
be on top of it as things change.

950
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,070
Well that's the goal. It's just, it's
so hard because almost impossible.

951
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,090
It's impossible and simple.

952
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,790
So I said that's why even the
World Health Organization,

953
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:53,400
which is the lead Health
Organization of the United Nations,

954
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,540
it's not enough if the
task is so much bigger.

955
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:01,710
And that's why we need to have this kind
of gripped bottom of groundswell that

956
00:54:01,711 --> 00:54:04,830
I'm pushing for. And you're absolutely
right when he said before, like,

957
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,980
because there's not a crisis,
people are focusing on other things.

958
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:10,800
Open any news site,
like what do you see?

959
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:13,480
It's not like the really
important stuff. It's, you know,

960
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:16,950
Trump did this or Kardashians did that.

961
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:20,400
And like we're in this culture where
there are a lot of draws on our attention,

962
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:23,760
but sometimes there's really important
stuff and people are afraid of it.

963
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,430
People are afraid of science.
People feel like,

964
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:30,120
I remember science from high school. I
didn't like it. I was uncomfortable. Um,

965
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:33,840
you know, this is, this is for technical
people and I just feel like we can't,

966
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,200
science is so deeply
transforming the world.

967
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:39,420
Not just around us but within us.

968
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,480
And so we have to understand it and
people who are explaining science like me,

969
00:54:45,091 --> 00:54:47,850
the onus is on us.
Like if somebody reads my book and says,

970
00:54:47,851 --> 00:54:50,550
well that was really dense,
that was too hard.

971
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,950
Like that's my failure. Like I was
giving a talk in New York a couple of,

972
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:00,090
a couple of weeks ago and so I gave my
my talk and I try to make this really

973
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:03,330
accessible for people. People
were all jazzed up, they got it.

974
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:07,230
And then there was this wonderful guys,
brilliant senior scientist at this myth,

975
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:11,340
this major stem cell research
center. And so the, the,

976
00:55:11,341 --> 00:55:15,350
the host said, all right, Jamie
just talked, um, can you sign it?

977
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:18,870
Can you give us a little background on
the science? This guy knows so much.

978
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:22,710
And he started going and it was very
technical and you could just like get to

979
00:55:22,711 --> 00:55:25,740
see the faces of the people in
the audience. He was like, Oh God,

980
00:55:25,741 --> 00:55:28,140
what's happening here?
And just like their level of excitement,

981
00:55:28,141 --> 00:55:31,180
it's just shrunk because
it couldn't really cook.

982
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:33,810
And scientists,

983
00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:38,070
scientists aren't trained
by and large to communicate.

984
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:40,740
And to see in the fisheries.
So a little more than a month ago,

985
00:55:40,741 --> 00:55:45,741
I was in Kyoto in Japan and I went to
the laboratory of the world's leading

986
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,700
scientists who's doing a process of what
I mentioned earlier of turning adult

987
00:55:50,701 --> 00:55:54,300
cells into stem cells into eggs.
And so this,

988
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,810
this will revolutionize the way
humans reproduce. And so I had,

989
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,440
it was in a meeting, um, with
his, uh, top postdoc students.

990
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,080
So these are like really the
cutting edge of these technologies.

991
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,750
And I went around to each of them
and I said, here's my question.

992
00:56:06,751 --> 00:56:08,100
I have two questions for each of you.
One,

993
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,380
tell me what you're doing now and to
tell me what are the implications of what

994
00:56:13,381 --> 00:56:17,070
you're doing now for 50 years from now.
And the furniture,

995
00:56:17,071 --> 00:56:17,910
the first question goes,
oh,

996
00:56:17,911 --> 00:56:20,430
I'm doing this and we're
doing this with mouse models.

997
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:24,670
And people were so animated. And
then 50 from now, people just froze.

998
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,950
And it was so uncomfortably.

999
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:30,430
They were like squeezing the table just
because that's not what scientists do.

1000
00:56:30,431 --> 00:56:33,070
They're trained to say, well, this
is the thing just in front of me.

1001
00:56:33,071 --> 00:56:36,130
So I thought I was writing this
book for the general public,

1002
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:40,840
but I'm being invited to
speak to thousands of doctors
and scientists because

1003
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:44,950
what they're saying is we get that we're
doing this little piece of this in,

1004
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:48,670
whether it's lab research or fertility
doctors or all sorts of things,

1005
00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:53,440
but it's really hard to put together the
whole story of the genetics revolution

1006
00:56:53,441 --> 00:56:57,100
and what it means for us
and for society. Yeah, man,

1007
00:56:57,220 --> 00:56:59,140
that is interesting about scientists,
right?

1008
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,130
They're just concentrate on the task
at hand. Yeah. I mean it wasn't that,

1009
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:06,130
that was like one of the big concerns
about the Manhattan project, right?

1010
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,740
This is the task. The task is how
do you figure out how to do it.

1011
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:13,360
So they figured out how to do it,
not the eventual in yes.

1012
00:57:13,361 --> 00:57:17,470
Consequence. So when Robert Oppenheimer,
who was the, the lead of the,

1013
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:21,220
of the Manhattan project, when that
first bomb went off, I mean he has his,

1014
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:25,030
his famous quote. It
exactly. You mean they,

1015
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:29,590
the Co English common translation
was Holy Shit, what have we done?

1016
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:34,270
And, and that's, and this science
is real, but it's not going to be,

1017
00:57:34,271 --> 00:57:36,070
it's not one person doing it.

1018
00:57:36,130 --> 00:57:40,750
I mean that's the whole like science
has been diffused at least with with

1019
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:41,561
nuclear power.

1020
00:57:41,561 --> 00:57:46,561
It was a relatively small number of
people and it was a one or two states that

1021
00:57:47,021 --> 00:57:50,140
could do it.
Now with with precision gene editing,

1022
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:53,000
I mean you get the Nobel prize for,

1023
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:57,040
for figuring out how to do and you will
get the Nobel prize for figuring out how

1024
00:57:57,041 --> 00:57:59,740
to do CRISPR gene edits,

1025
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:03,400
but to apply it once the
formula already exists,

1026
00:58:04,030 --> 00:58:07,030
you get like an a minus in
your high school biology class.

1027
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:11,140
So this technology is out there.
It's cheap, it's accessible.

1028
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:16,830
Did you go to the 2045 conference
in Manhattan a couple of years back?

1029
00:58:16,930 --> 00:58:19,480
Now, do you know about
all that? 2040 for that's,

1030
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:23,010
that's part of the thing with
these transhumanists folks.

1031
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:27,460
They believe that with their own
calculations of the exponential inclusive

1032
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:31,360
technology that somewhere around
24 does a singularity. Yeah.

1033
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,860
At the very least,

1034
00:58:32,861 --> 00:58:36,190
we're going to reach this point where
you're going to be able to either download

1035
00:58:36,191 --> 00:58:40,870
consciousness or have some sort of an
artificially intelligent sentient chains

1036
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:45,260
hanging out with you. Yeah, so it's,
I'm involved, I'm on faculty for um,

1037
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:48,910
one of the programs of singularity
university called exponential medicine.

1038
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:50,620
And so we're thinking a lot about that.

1039
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:54,910
Actually had an editor on the New York
Times a few weeks ago imagining a visit

1040
00:58:54,911 --> 00:58:58,660
to a fertility clinic in
the year 20, 45. And again,

1041
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:03,661
because we were on this exponential
change is it's really hard for people to,

1042
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,080
to internalize, to kind of feel
how fast these changes are coming.

1043
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:12,280
I do think though, Ray Kurzweil, who's,
who's a really incredible genius,

1044
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:16,750
he thinks that we are soon going to
get to a point now where our artificial

1045
00:59:16,751 --> 00:59:20,140
intelligence is self learning.
Because when you think about it, Ai,

1046
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:23,660
if it gets to the point where it can
read something, read and comprehend,

1047
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,430
like in seconds,

1048
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:29,570
it will read every book ever
written in Cuban history.

1049
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:33,980
And then it's when you have all these
doublings and all of this more knowledge,

1050
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:35,900
you can imagine how that
would happen pretty quickly.

1051
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:39,320
The counterargument against,
and I think that it will,

1052
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,850
but I don't think that we're the, that
our human brains are, on one hand,

1053
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:47,150
they're incredibly complex and they're
also kind of irrational. I mean,

1054
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:48,400
we have all these different layers.

1055
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,930
You have our lizard brain and
every decision that we make,

1056
00:59:51,080 --> 00:59:52,430
there's the rational decision.

1057
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:55,190
But then there's all the
other stuff that our brains,

1058
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,620
that doesn't even rise to the
level of our awareness that our,

1059
00:59:57,650 --> 00:59:59,810
that our brains are processing.

1060
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:05,440
And right now we only really have one
really effective artificial intelligence

1061
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,580
algorithm,
which is for pattern recognition.

1062
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:10,310
But I think if you think of pattern
recognition as a core skill of what our

1063
01:00:10,311 --> 01:00:15,150
brains do, our brain's probably have
a thousand, 2000 different skills. Um,

1064
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:20,060
but the core thing is whether we
reached this singularity moment or not,

1065
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,330
these technologies are going to
become incredibly more powerful.

1066
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:27,590
They're going to become increasingly
integrated into our lives and into our

1067
01:00:27,591 --> 01:00:31,310
beings. And part of our evolutionary
process. There's no longer, oh,

1068
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:35,210
we just have our biological evolution
and our technological evolution,

1069
01:00:35,211 --> 01:00:36,650
and those are separate things.
They're connected.

1070
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,990
It's going to be the weird
question of whether or not,

1071
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:43,730
if an artificial intelligence is going
to be able to absorb all of the writing

1072
01:00:43,731 --> 01:00:46,970
that human beings have ever done and
really understand us. Yeah. Well,

1073
01:00:46,971 --> 01:00:49,280
they really still be able to understand
those just because they get all the

1074
01:00:49,281 --> 01:00:53,420
writing. So right now you would
say no. I would say no. Yeah.

1075
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:56,510
But 20 years from now, 50 years
from now, a hundred years from now,

1076
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,940
they could come up with a
reasonable facsimile. I mean, yeah,

1077
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:03,350
they could figure out a way
to get it close enough. Yeah,

1078
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,260
I know where it's like
her, like the, yeah. Yeah.

1079
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:10,610
That's an essential point because I
think when people imagine this AI future,

1080
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:15,050
they're imagining like some intimate
relationship with some artificial

1081
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:17,600
intelligent, intelligent,
that feels just like a human.

1082
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:20,450
I don't think that's going to
happen because it's its own one. No.

1083
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:25,100
But just because Ai, it will be its own
form of intelligence. And it may not be,

1084
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:29,000
frankly, you wouldn't want ais with these
brains like we have that have all these

1085
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:32,870
different impulses that are
kind of imagining all this,
this crazy stuff. We're,

1086
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,990
we may want them to be more rational than,
than we are.

1087
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:40,760
So like chimpanzees or our close
relatives, they don't think just like us,

1088
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,230
we're not, you know, we're not
expecting them to think like,

1089
01:01:43,231 --> 01:01:46,310
cause they're their own thing.
And I think AI's will be there on things.

1090
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:50,270
Will we be interacting with them?
Will we be having sex with them? Yes.

1091
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,870
But if they are there, it's not going
to be that. They're just like us.

1092
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:57,170
We're going to, they're going to be
these things that live within us,

1093
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:01,580
live with us, and together
we're going to evolve. Well,

1094
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:05,180
they're certainly already better at
doing certain things like playing chess.

1095
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,410
And it took a long time for an artificial
intelligence to be able to compete

1096
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:12,290
against a real chess master.
But now they swamped them. Yeah.

1097
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:17,270
So say learn quickly can incredibly
quickly they teach themselves. Yeah. So,

1098
01:02:17,271 --> 01:02:19,980
so first we had chess in
chess. People said, oh,

1099
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:21,660
that's what it means to be a human.

1100
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,830
The computers will never beat humans
at chess. Now it's like everyone says,

1101
01:02:25,831 --> 01:02:28,680
well no human could ever compete.
And then they said,

1102
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:32,100
well there's this Chinese game of go,
which kind of when people hear look at it,

1103
01:02:32,101 --> 01:02:35,220
it looks kind of like checkers but
it's actually way more sophisticated.

1104
01:02:35,221 --> 01:02:40,080
Way More complicated than chess.
I heard that there are more moves in go,

1105
01:02:40,081 --> 01:02:43,170
more potential moves and there
are stars in the universe. Yes.

1106
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:47,660
So so then they had Alphago that this,
this uh,

1107
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:50,880
company deep mind,
which was later acquired by Google.

1108
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:56,090
They built this algorithm that in 2016
defeated the world champions of going,

1109
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,320
people thought that was,
we were decades away.

1110
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:03,650
And then deep mind created this new
program called Alpha Zero Alpha zero with

1111
01:03:04,171 --> 01:03:05,040
Alpha go.

1112
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:09,980
They gave it access to all of
the digitized games of go. So it,

1113
01:03:09,981 --> 01:03:14,850
it very quickly was able to learn from
how everybody else had played go alpha

1114
01:03:14,851 --> 01:03:16,260
zero.
They just said,

1115
01:03:16,410 --> 01:03:20,220
here are the basic rules of
go and they let alpha go.

1116
01:03:20,221 --> 01:03:24,390
Just play against itself with no other
experience other than here are the rules

1117
01:03:24,391 --> 01:03:27,120
and play against.
And in four days,

1118
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:32,420
Alpha zero destroyed Alphago and then Alf
and Ned Alpha zero destroyed the world

1119
01:03:36,661 --> 01:03:41,520
champions of chess and destroyed every
other computer program that had ever

1120
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:42,630
played chess.
And this again,

1121
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:46,850
those computer programs had internalized
all of the chess games of grandmasters.

1122
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:49,290
Alpha zero had not internalized any,

1123
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:52,290
it just played against itself
for a few days. And then Shogi,

1124
01:03:52,291 --> 01:03:55,170
which is a Japanese traditional game,
kind of like chess,

1125
01:03:55,171 --> 01:04:00,120
it destroyed the grandmasters of that.
So that's what I'm saying is that these,

1126
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,250
the world is changing.

1127
01:04:02,251 --> 01:04:07,251
It's changing so much faster than we
anticipate and we have to be as ready for

1128
01:04:07,831 --> 01:04:08,520
that as we can.

1129
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,460
I think we need to come to grips with
the fact that we're way stupider than we

1130
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:12,780
think.
Who are we,

1131
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,620
what we think we're really intelligent
and we are in comparison to everything

1132
01:04:16,621 --> 01:04:19,650
else on this planet. Yeah. But in
comparison to what is possible,

1133
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:24,270
we are really fucking dumb in comparison
to what this computer can do and what

1134
01:04:24,271 --> 01:04:26,040
the f the future of that computers.

1135
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,990
And what maybe that computer's going to
redesign another computer. And I'm, again,

1136
01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:32,670
this is good, but I've got some, I got
some hiccups here. Yeah, no, it's true.

1137
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:35,040
And yet the technology is us.
It's like this taste,

1138
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:38,460
these not like this technology, some
alien force. We've, it's like this.

1139
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,470
It's like we create art. We create.
We could, yeah. You use that.

1140
01:04:42,471 --> 01:04:44,880
You mentioned cities and are like,
we create these cities,

1141
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,140
which are these incredible places where
dreams can happen to cities like here in

1142
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:51,270
Los Angeles or New York
where, where, where I'm from.

1143
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:56,100
So this technology is us and the challenge
is how can we make sure that this

1144
01:04:56,220 --> 01:05:00,960
technology serves our needs
rather than undermines our needs.

1145
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:01,920
Yeah.

1146
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,920
And whether or not our needs supersede
the needs of the human race or supersedes

1147
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:11,590
the needs of the planet.
Yeah. It's, we're,

1148
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:13,770
we're almost too much champ,
right.

1149
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:17,710
To contemplate these critical
decisions in terms of like what,

1150
01:05:17,711 --> 01:05:22,090
how it's going to unfold from here
on out. Yeah. We really might not we,

1151
01:05:22,270 --> 01:05:25,360
but the people that are actually at
the tip of the spear of this stuff,

1152
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:30,361
they really might be effecting the way
the planet is shaped and years from now.

1153
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,400
And we're doing that now.
I mean we are,

1154
01:05:33,401 --> 01:05:35,170
there is an article
came out the other day.

1155
01:05:35,171 --> 01:05:38,560
There's a million species that
are on the verge of extinction.

1156
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:42,370
We already driving all these other
species to extinction where warming the

1157
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:42,851
planet.

1158
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:47,560
So this is humans are that the determining
factor in many ways for how this

1159
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:51,850
planet plays out. And that's why in my
mind everything comes back to vows. We,

1160
01:05:51,851 --> 01:05:56,020
you're right, we have this,
this lizard nature, this,

1161
01:05:56,050 --> 01:05:58,720
this monkey nature. It's,
it's who we are and that's,

1162
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,390
I mean you wouldn't want to take that
away because that's the core of, of,

1163
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:06,160
of what we are. And yet we are also a
species that has created philosophy.

1164
01:06:06,161 --> 01:06:10,990
We've created beautiful religions in
traditions and art. And the question is,

1165
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:16,050
which version of us is going to lead
us into the future if it's this tribal

1166
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:23,620
primate with these urges, like that's
really frightening. If we can say,

1167
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:23,980
you know,

1168
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:27,670
we've done better and worse in history
and we had this terrible second world war

1169
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,700
and yet at the end of the Second
World War with American leadership,

1170
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:34,150
the world came together.
We established at United Nations,

1171
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:36,280
we established these
concepts of human rights.

1172
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:39,720
Like you can't just kill everybody in
your own country and say, hey, it's,

1173
01:06:39,721 --> 01:06:43,360
it's just my business.
So we have this capability,

1174
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:47,260
but it's always a struggle and we of
these forces are always at war with each

1175
01:06:47,261 --> 01:06:52,220
other in many ways. It's just
too much to think about. Yeah.

1176
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:54,400
Well we have,
I know we do have to.

1177
01:06:54,730 --> 01:06:59,730
One of the things that has always been
amusing to me is that we seem to have

1178
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:04,090
this insatiable desire to improve things,

1179
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,290
and I've always wondered why I like it,

1180
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:10,840
but is that maybe because this is
what human beings are here for?

1181
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,680
It's what we do. It's who we are,
right? Yeah. But this is a product.

1182
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:17,260
It's just a US being intelligent,

1183
01:07:17,261 --> 01:07:21,610
trying to survive against nature and
predators and weather and all the,

1184
01:07:21,611 --> 01:07:26,500
all the different issues that we came up
that we evolved growing up and dealing

1185
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:29,500
with. And then now we just
want things to be better.

1186
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,130
We just want things to be more convenient,
faster, but more data. Uh, you,

1187
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:38,080
you're aware of Elon Musk's
neuro link check technology.

1188
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,650
How much do you know about it? I know a
decent amount of, my friend Brian Johnson,

1189
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:42,670
he has a company,
kernel.

1190
01:07:42,671 --> 01:07:45,100
There's a few different companies that
are trying to think about these brain

1191
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:47,230
machine interfaces and
what are they trying to do?

1192
01:07:47,770 --> 01:07:52,630
Basically what they're trying to do is
to find a way to connect our brains to

1193
01:07:52,631 --> 01:07:56,440
our machines. And there's a little bit
of of progress from our brains are,

1194
01:07:56,770 --> 01:08:00,250
they're incredibly complicated and
they're messy. I mean, if there,

1195
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:02,530
there's a lot that's that,
that, that's happening.

1196
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:07,920
But we are increasingly figuring
out how to connect our brains to our

1197
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:09,161
technology.

1198
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:13,630
And so people are imagining a time
when we can do things like download,

1199
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,280
download,
download ideas

1200
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,050
or Upload Memories and upload it.

1201
01:08:18,051 --> 01:08:22,610
Isn't there some very early science
that is suggesting that this will be

1202
01:08:22,730 --> 01:08:26,660
possible, but it's, it's still the
very early days, the very early days.

1203
01:08:26,661 --> 01:08:31,661
But Ilan was giving the impression that
some time this year they're going to

1204
01:08:32,271 --> 01:08:34,670
release something. You know,
they may release something,

1205
01:08:34,671 --> 01:08:37,240
but it's not going to be something
that's going to change the world because

1206
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:37,701
there's this,

1207
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:42,701
that technology is way more nascent
than even the genetics technology that,

1208
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:46,310
um, that I've been talking about.
So it's not like that there's that,

1209
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:50,960
that at all remotely possible that this
year you're going to be able to like

1210
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:54,140
upload a full memory or download
a full memory. But there,

1211
01:08:54,141 --> 01:08:56,660
there are little things that
are happening, but every,

1212
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,980
every journey begins with a step.

1213
01:08:58,220 --> 01:09:02,510
But the technology is fairly transparent
as term in terms of like where the

1214
01:09:02,511 --> 01:09:03,740
state of the art is right now.

1215
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,690
It is in that it's extremely early.
This stuff is real.

1216
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:12,710
So when you think of like about systems
that we understand, I mentioned that we,

1217
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:15,960
you know, we understand just a
little bit about genomics. Um,

1218
01:09:16,010 --> 01:09:17,630
we know less about the brain.

1219
01:09:17,631 --> 01:09:20,760
The brain is kind of the
great unknown of this unit.

1220
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:23,510
We know more about the oceans than we
know about our brain. I mean he says,

1221
01:09:23,511 --> 01:09:25,190
we know very,
very little.

1222
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:28,670
We understand that if you kind of stick
an electric current in somebody's brain,

1223
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:29,521
like that's going to have you,

1224
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:31,820
if you kind of shoot a spike
through somebody's head,

1225
01:09:31,821 --> 01:09:35,870
but really understanding how the brain
functions it, we're still in the very,

1226
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,704
very early days.

1227
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:41,090
So do you think the Kurzweils off with
this idea that you're going to be able to

1228
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:43,220
download your consciousness
into a computer?

1229
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:45,860
Cause that's one of the most controversial
ideas that he's come up with.

1230
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:50,040
I think he's, I think he's off. Um,

1231
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,850
based on your use of the word your,

1232
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:57,510
so I mentioned that a month ago I
was in Kyoto and I was at this, um,

1233
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:58,670
at this stem cell lab,

1234
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:02,480
but I also went to another lab
of a guy named Hiroshi Ishiguro,

1235
01:10:02,481 --> 01:10:05,940
who's the world's leading
humanoid robot assist.

1236
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:10,340
And so he's the guy who was on the cover
of wired and he's created these robot

1237
01:10:10,341 --> 01:10:14,840
avatars. And like I had a conversation
with this, this robot woman Erica,

1238
01:10:15,230 --> 01:10:19,310
and it was really interesting cause I
could see that like if I would smile she'd

1239
01:10:19,311 --> 01:10:22,940
smile and leaned forward. And
if I had like a, you know,
overexaggerated sad face,

1240
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:27,200
she'd like change her expression
and she can have like, you know,

1241
01:10:27,201 --> 01:10:30,080
basic basic conversations.

1242
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:35,090
But we're still a long way and so from,
from having full robotics,

1243
01:10:35,091 --> 01:10:38,360
but I had this for robotic
human interactions,

1244
01:10:38,361 --> 01:10:43,361
but I had this debate with Ishiguro and
he was saying that he thought that the

1245
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:46,520
future of humanity was nonbiological,

1246
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:51,080
that we were going to kind of unload
ourselves to these non biological entities

1247
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:54,420
and that is how we would gain
our and mortality. And I, my arm,

1248
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:58,370
I argued something very different.
I feel like we are biological beings.

1249
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:00,350
I think we'll fully integrate
with our technology,

1250
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:05,030
but if we ever become entirely
nonbiological, then that's not us.

1251
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:05,810
Either.

1252
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:10,810
We will have committed suicide
as a species or these robots,

1253
01:11:11,091 --> 01:11:14,100
or they will have killed us because even,
let's just say

1254
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:18,800
that I could download my
entire consciousness to some
kind of robot unless it's

1255
01:11:18,810 --> 01:11:19,830
say that was possible.

1256
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:25,250
That robot would be me for that first
exact moment when the transfer happened,

1257
01:11:26,110 --> 01:11:28,080
but then beyond that,

1258
01:11:28,170 --> 01:11:31,440
they wouldn't be me anymore because
there would be a whole other set of of

1259
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:34,830
experience. But we're, but
certainly our interaction,

1260
01:11:34,831 --> 01:11:37,320
our connectivity with this
tech is going to be greater.

1261
01:11:37,321 --> 01:11:42,150
And so even if Kurzweil isn't exactly
right, he's directionally right. Give,

1262
01:11:42,151 --> 01:11:46,590
the problem would be that you would
be locked if they downloaded your

1263
01:11:46,591 --> 01:11:50,230
consciousness into some sort of a
bank of computers somewhere. Right?

1264
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:52,890
Where are you if that's
your consciousness,

1265
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:55,390
your consciousness is in
these ones and Zeros. Yeah.

1266
01:11:56,760 --> 01:12:00,720
I mean that's terrifying.
Terrifying.

1267
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:02,550
As someone didn't like you and they said,

1268
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:05,430
I'm going to make one version
of you suffer for all eternity.

1269
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:11,070
Download you while you sleep. It's true,
but I have something worse than that.

1270
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,100
Okay. Death. And so I think that
nobody is going to say, well,

1271
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:19,101
I'm going to be Joe living a life or I'm
going to like not be Joe and I'll just

1272
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:24,120
have my consciousness downloaded someplace
else. And so if the comparison is,

1273
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:27,270
well, I've lived this life
and I don't want to die.

1274
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,500
And so I'd rather kind of be
here in some kind of version.

1275
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:34,380
And even if it's not me,
does something really,

1276
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,230
I think some people will want that.
Not Everybody, some people will,

1277
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:39,000
but they don't know what they're getting.
Right.

1278
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:41,700
In terms of you don't know what that
experience is going to be like. Yeah.

1279
01:12:41,701 --> 01:12:46,701
Nor do you know if there is some sort of
a chemical gateway that happens in the

1280
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:51,300
mind when you do expire and allows you
to pass through to the other dimension

1281
01:12:51,301 --> 01:12:55,770
that you're, your consciousness and your
soul longs to travel to. But no, you've,

1282
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:58,970
I hope I, you're right about
that and my timing not right.

1283
01:12:59,130 --> 01:13:00,930
I've written about this in
my novel. It's like, yeah,

1284
01:13:00,931 --> 01:13:02,280
but I think kind of when you're dead,

1285
01:13:02,281 --> 01:13:04,890
you're just dead and the
good news for you as well,

1286
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:09,240
just because I think that this kind of
immortality comes because time stops time

1287
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:13,110
is this relative concept.
And so at the moment that you die,

1288
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:18,540
that's immortality for you because
time stops flowing for you. Time is,

1289
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:22,230
that's what Einstein taught us. Time
is this relative concept. Other people,

1290
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:24,090
they're legitimately,
and there's no way to prove it,

1291
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:28,650
feel that we have this soul and this soul
can travel to other, other dimensions.

1292
01:13:28,651 --> 01:13:33,590
I happen to believe that we are biological
beings and our experience of the soul,

1293
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,680
whatever is connected to our biology,
when our biology stops functioning,

1294
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,360
those experiences, whatever they are,
stop being accessible at least to us.

1295
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:47,310
Have you had any psychedelic experiences?
I haven't and I was so tempted. We,

1296
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:50,940
we started the interview talking
about my chocolate, shamanism,

1297
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:56,850
anything I haven't in bed. I was
relaxed. I want to, I don't think so.

1298
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:57,600
And I'll tell you why.

1299
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:01,980
So I listened to the Michael Pale
and interviews and he had his great

1300
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:03,840
conversation with Sam Harris.

1301
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:08,610
And I really think that this
psilocybin stuff is Israel and just got

1302
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,860
decriminalized. I know in Denver,
I was just there the other day. Um,

1303
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,440
but as I said before,

1304
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:19,630
I think that the ultimate
drug is us and so for me,

1305
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:23,920
I would rather, and I definitely
think that our awareness that does,

1306
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:26,950
he doesn't encompass everything that
is knowable. Everything that we,

1307
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:31,350
that we could know, but we hem ourselves
in and if we want to get out of,

1308
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:32,860
of those limitations,

1309
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:36,540
certainly drugs are ways
that people have used for,

1310
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:40,450
for many thousands of years.
But when you take the drug,

1311
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:42,580
you're like taking the drug and
then you're not taking the drug.

1312
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:46,810
Like I would rather, what does that mean?
It's like if you're taking psilocybin,

1313
01:14:47,080 --> 01:14:48,610
you're having this great experience,

1314
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:52,510
but then tomorrow you're
not taking psilocybin and so
kind of your consciousness

1315
01:14:52,511 --> 01:14:53,080
has narrowed.

1316
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:57,580
My aspiration would be to
recognize that the drug is us.

1317
01:14:57,730 --> 01:15:01,570
Did we want to expand our consciousness?
There are all kinds of ways,

1318
01:15:01,571 --> 01:15:05,950
whether it's meditation or awareness
or just you know, simple appreciation.

1319
01:15:05,951 --> 01:15:08,470
That's when I do these cacao ceremonies.
What I say is like,

1320
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:12,460
you have this Cacau in front of you,
but it's not just this,

1321
01:15:12,490 --> 01:15:16,300
like think of the person in
Honduras who planted the seed,

1322
01:15:16,390 --> 01:15:20,170
the person who watered that seat,
the person who took the plant,

1323
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,800
the person who paved the road
to bring the plan. And I just,

1324
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:28,540
I just think that we can
expand our consciousness
through our own means and then

1325
01:15:28,541 --> 01:15:30,220
we always have access.
I hear what you're saying,

1326
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:33,180
but you're saying this from a person
has never had certain experiences.

1327
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:38,340
It's really preposterous.
You did experience what silicide can duty.

1328
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,600
Yeah. You definitely wouldn't
be saying it this way.

1329
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:44,290
You also wouldn't be thinking then you
take it and then you're not on it anymore

1330
01:15:44,291 --> 01:15:47,510
because it's profoundly
influential for the,

1331
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:50,860
your perspective in regards to
the whole rest of your existence.

1332
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,780
There's many people that have
had psychedelic experiences
to think about it as a

1333
01:15:55,781 --> 01:15:59,710
rebirth, that they've gone through
this and changed. Yeah. So,

1334
01:15:59,711 --> 01:16:04,600
but why would you have this rigid thought
process about drugs and not drugs,

1335
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:09,520
but yet you don't have it about the
cow, which is a mild drug. Yeah.

1336
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:12,840
And so I, you're right that it
may not be entirely consistent.

1337
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:15,550
Some of the people you've described are
good friends of mine who've really done

1338
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:19,990
it, and I've really, I've talked to them
about it and I'm hung endlessly curious.

1339
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,520
So why don't you do it?
The reason is so far,

1340
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:29,790
I have been on this journey to see what's
possible within myself and I'm still

1341
01:16:30,341 --> 01:16:31,600
on that journey.
I'm not,

1342
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,780
I don't want to close off any possibility
for kind and assume that it would

1343
01:16:34,781 --> 01:16:36,640
close things off.
That's what's confusing.

1344
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:41,890
It's just opening you up to a new
experience that other people found to be

1345
01:16:41,891 --> 01:16:45,100
profoundly influential.
Yeah. And Yeah. So,

1346
01:16:45,460 --> 01:16:48,970
so far you're very resistant to this. Like
you yeah. I'm talking to you like, yeah,

1347
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:52,650
yeah, yeah. Like you can't wait to come
back and either their own rationale.

1348
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:53,970
You're funny.
I will.

1349
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:57,250
I will come back to this perspective of
a person who hasn't experienced anything.

1350
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,270
You're so right.

1351
01:16:58,271 --> 01:17:01,810
And I think it's such a great point cause
I'm very close with actually that with

1352
01:17:01,811 --> 01:17:02,561
the Tibetans,

1353
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:06,070
one of my closest friends is the
prime minister of the Tibet and exile

1354
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:10,160
government. So I've been many times
to John Sala in, I've met with

1355
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:15,520
his holiness the Dalai Lama many times
and the most incredible thing about

1356
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:17,270
meeting with these guys and they,

1357
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,340
they are all people who've found
these incredible states of heightened

1358
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:26,870
consciousness so much that their brains
are changed when they go into the the

1359
01:17:26,871 --> 01:17:31,010
FMRI machines. But when you
have a conversation with them,

1360
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:33,740
it's not like what we do like. Exactly.
And thank you for calling me out.

1361
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:34,640
Like you say something,

1362
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:37,950
I've already in my head countered what
you're saying before you're finished

1363
01:17:37,951 --> 01:17:38,151
saying,

1364
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:42,080
and I'm like why you kept saying exactly
which part means that you made me a

1365
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:45,320
little uncomfortable, which
is good. That's what we,
what we want. And these guys,

1366
01:17:45,321 --> 01:17:49,460
it's like you'd talk to them and they
would just be so tuned in to what you were

1367
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,920
saying and they would just
kind of think about it.

1368
01:17:51,921 --> 01:17:55,340
Then you'd finish and then
they'd kind of look up. And then,

1369
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:57,800
because we're Americans,
we want, you know,

1370
01:17:57,880 --> 01:18:01,850
somebody stops speaking like you have
to if you don't speak right away.

1371
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:05,780
And then there was like a minute and
then it's like you're kind of looking

1372
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,280
around, was it me? Did I say?

1373
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:11,380
And then they would come back with
this incredibly thoughtful thing. So I,

1374
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:14,930
you're right, you know, I don't
want to close off any possibility.

1375
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,870
There are many different things
that we could, uh, could do.

1376
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,490
The Path that I have been on and
certainly with this [inaudible] right.

1377
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,400
Cacau is like a, a mild,
I mean, not a huge one,

1378
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:29,840
but like a mild drug and
life is a mild jog. Um,

1379
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:32,870
so the assignment is
not very mild. Yeah, no.

1380
01:18:32,871 --> 01:18:36,260
In my friends who have done it have said
exactly what he said, they say, I have a,

1381
01:18:36,261 --> 01:18:40,760
a good friend of mine who, uh, who
did it. Um, and then he said it just,

1382
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:45,950
it showed me a path to a different
identity, a different consciousness.

1383
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:50,360
And now he said, I don't do silicide
Bun, but I do daily meditation,

1384
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,560
but I can see where I'd like to go,
what's possible. So I, I get that.

1385
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:55,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

1386
01:18:55,881 --> 01:18:59,600
There's a bunch of different substances
out there that have very similar

1387
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,970
profound effects.
Um,

1388
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:04,910
there's a real thought,

1389
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:10,210
and this is something that Terence
Mckenna described way back in the late

1390
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:11,840
nineties,
early two thousands,

1391
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:16,880
he believed that you're going to be able
to recreate a lot of psychedelic states

1392
01:19:16,881 --> 01:19:21,881
through virtual reality so that people
that don't want to actually do a drug

1393
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:26,870
will be on, had to experience what it's
like to be on that drug. And that, I mean,

1394
01:19:26,871 --> 01:19:31,070
that's very theoretical
and hypothetical and yes,

1395
01:19:31,460 --> 01:19:34,220
you know, who knows whether or
not that's possible, but that,

1396
01:19:34,910 --> 01:19:38,780
that could be one other way that human
beings interface with technology.

1397
01:19:39,170 --> 01:19:41,240
So humans,
in my view,

1398
01:19:41,241 --> 01:19:44,990
are far more hackable than we think that,

1399
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:49,250
that there are so many that we just
imagine our biology is being fixed.

1400
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:53,720
But our biology is really variable.
Like I have a, a friend, um,

1401
01:19:53,721 --> 01:19:57,980
who's an anesthesiologist at Stanford
and she's done this experimentation of

1402
01:19:57,981 --> 01:20:01,730
just running, just like very mild
electric currents through people's brains.

1403
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
And people have these very real
experiences and whether it's arousal or

1404
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:08,034
something that it's,

1405
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:11,750
that you're a, you're entering people's
minds through different ways. So you,

1406
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:12,870
you talk about a,

1407
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:17,400
about virtual reality when we are
entering a world where the pixelation of

1408
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:20,710
virtual reality will be
equal to life and that,

1409
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:24,840
so you're going to be in this VR
space and it's just, it will look,

1410
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:27,150
it may smell,
it could eve with haptic suits.

1411
01:20:27,151 --> 01:20:31,410
It may feel just like life and our brains,

1412
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:35,070
I don't know if you've done these things
with the, these, um, uh, these, uh,

1413
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,660
VR glasses where you go
and you can see people,

1414
01:20:39,661 --> 01:20:40,440
you're just like in a,

1415
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:45,210
in a hall and the put on the glasses and
now you're in an elevator going to the

1416
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:50,290
top on the outside, like a window
cleaners elevator to the top of this, um,

1417
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:52,950
highrise and there's a
little rickety board.

1418
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:57,120
And then there's this cat at the end
of the board and they're saying, yeah,

1419
01:20:57,121 --> 01:21:00,990
you have to go, go save the cat.
And you've already seen that.

1420
01:21:00,991 --> 01:21:05,490
You're just in a hall. You know it
in your brain. Um, there's this cat.

1421
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:08,960
Everybody's looking at you and you've
seen all these other people panic.

1422
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,740
It's like, wow, when I'm
there, I'm going to be,

1423
01:21:10,741 --> 01:21:13,830
so I'm just going to go grab that cat.
And you're terrified.

1424
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:17,130
Like you're trying to override your
lizard brain and your lizard brain saying

1425
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:21,440
like, no, don't step up this. They'll
have that for our HTC vive. Yeah,

1426
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:26,020
we need to set that up, Jim. We need a
two by four we put on the ground. Well,

1427
01:21:26,021 --> 01:21:26,731
it's incredible.

1428
01:21:26,731 --> 01:21:31,731
And so I think that this whole concept
of reality is at like that our technology

1429
01:21:31,861 --> 01:21:36,090
is going to be changing our sense
of reality. And then what's real,

1430
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:40,980
like if you feel arousal in your brain
because of an electric current or you

1431
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:45,690
feel it because you're with
your girlfriend or wife
or reading a magazine or

1432
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:50,220
whatever, is that different?
Is One real and one not real?

1433
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,920
And I think that that's,
there's real big issues here.

1434
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,220
General mean that is the Matrix,
right? Yeah. I mean the idea that,

1435
01:21:56,390 --> 01:21:59,730
and if it feels better and it's
more enjoyable than real life,

1436
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,860
what is going to stop people from doing
the Ray Kurzweil deal and downloading

1437
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:08,430
yourself into this, this
dimension? Well, and not much.

1438
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,810
Whether it's possible to do
a full download or not me,

1439
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,040
I think that's an open question,

1440
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:18,630
but whether people are going to be more
comfortable living in these alternative

1441
01:22:18,631 --> 01:22:21,660
worlds and whether we're booked,
we're going to be able to say, oh no,

1442
01:22:21,661 --> 01:22:26,160
that is the fake world. Like if you're
in this virtual world, but your,

1443
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:29,580
do you have friends in that world,
you're interacting in that world.

1444
01:22:29,581 --> 01:22:34,581
You have experiences that feel every bit
as real in that world as in our world

1445
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,270
and people say, oh no, that's not
real. Those, those aren't your friends.

1446
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:42,450
Like even now, like you know we
all people with global lives,

1447
01:22:42,451 --> 01:22:45,570
you kind of have these friends.
Like I have a good friend in Mongolia.

1448
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:48,750
We talk all the time.
Do you ever see them in person?

1449
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,440
Once it all hell like once every
year or two. It's great to see him.

1450
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:52,720
That's a real person though.
You know it's a,

1451
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:54,780
it's a real that someone
who actually not like a pen.

1452
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,570
It was a control plane that you
actually do know him. Gonna have to say.

1453
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:01,200
But if it was someone that you only talk
to online and they lived in Mongolia,

1454
01:23:01,201 --> 01:23:02,940
that's where things get weird.
It's true.

1455
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:06,070
But let's just say hyper falling that
hypothetical. You have that person,

1456
01:23:06,071 --> 01:23:10,230
they're part of your whole life
and you're there with you there.

1457
01:23:10,231 --> 01:23:12,760
Are they with you through
your life experiences?

1458
01:23:12,761 --> 01:23:14,200
You call them up when you're sad.

1459
01:23:14,680 --> 01:23:19,680
Like is it so essential that
you've met that person physically?

1460
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:23,980
Like is that the core of what it means
to be someone's friend that you was not

1461
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:26,450
essential but it means a lot.
It does. And I, and so I,

1462
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:31,480
I mean because we are not like we are
these physical beings and we are these

1463
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:37,900
virtual beings. But figuring out what's
the balance is going to be really tricky.

1464
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:39,700
Yeah.
What is the balance?

1465
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,470
What I'm worried about augmented
reality too. Cause I, you know,

1466
01:23:44,471 --> 01:23:48,550
when you see people that you snapchat
filters and give themselves doggy years

1467
01:23:48,551 --> 01:23:49,790
and stuff like that,
like yeah.

1468
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:54,220
Well how long before that is just
something that people choose to turn on or

1469
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:56,670
turn off about life itself.
Yeah.

1470
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,860
Like you'll be able to see the world
through different lenses. The Sky,

1471
01:23:59,861 --> 01:24:02,770
it could be a different color. The
plants could be a different color. Yeah.

1472
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:06,160
I write about this in one of
my novels, Eternal Sonata, um,

1473
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,940
where I think we're just going to
have these contact lenses and I'm,

1474
01:24:10,030 --> 01:24:13,480
and it'll be different kinds
of information based on
what people want. I mean,

1475
01:24:13,481 --> 01:24:16,750
like I'll meet with you and it'll
say, all right, this is Joe,

1476
01:24:17,170 --> 01:24:19,570
here's a little bit of background,
whatever,

1477
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:22,180
and we'll have useful information.

1478
01:24:22,181 --> 01:24:25,120
Or you're walking around
a city and you'll be,

1479
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:28,090
get little alerts of things
you might do or, or history.

1480
01:24:28,091 --> 01:24:30,640
And so I think that that's what they
were thinking about with Google glasses.

1481
01:24:30,641 --> 01:24:31,441
Right? Yeah. I know.

1482
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:34,800
But he just was so annoying that he wanted
to kill these two weird, yeah, yeah,

1483
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:37,410
yeah, yeah. It was just too, everybody
felt like they were getting filmed.

1484
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:41,260
They were, when you were walking
around with Google glasses on,

1485
01:24:41,261 --> 01:24:44,080
you assume that people were recording
everything. It was very strange.

1486
01:24:44,260 --> 01:24:46,040
But I think that's another
thing that we're just,

1487
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,150
all of our lives are going to be
recorded. Of course. Yeah. Now,

1488
01:24:49,151 --> 01:24:52,930
do you think that that's going to come
in the form of a contact lens or do you

1489
01:24:52,931 --> 01:24:56,080
think it's going to come in the form of
like ski goggles that you're going to

1490
01:24:56,081 --> 01:24:58,570
put on and snowing where nobody
wants to look like an idiot.

1491
01:24:58,571 --> 01:25:02,410
And so in the beginning, no, but
in the beginning, all of these,

1492
01:25:02,411 --> 01:25:05,610
you talked about Michael Douglas with
this or like that. My favorite one is, um,

1493
01:25:05,950 --> 01:25:09,380
is Kurt Russell in escape from New York?
What do you have there?

1494
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:11,910
It's like this really cool tech.
Like he,

1495
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:16,540
he finally gets out of this Manhattan
Hell and he's got this phone and it's like

1496
01:25:16,930 --> 01:25:20,890
this big and it's so crazy cell
phone. This freeze, it's like very,

1497
01:25:20,891 --> 01:25:22,570
very early days.
And so you know,

1498
01:25:22,571 --> 01:25:26,260
now we have these kind of glasses and
there's like a little bit of a little bit

1499
01:25:26,261 --> 01:25:30,040
of Cachet, but all I'm has a cell phone
that's that big. It'd be seen that. No,

1500
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:33,820
I was at the Verizon store. Yeah, I
think it's like an attachment. Earnest.

1501
01:25:33,821 --> 01:25:38,530
An accessory to a phone. Yeah. You can
bring it with you as intervention. Fine.

1502
01:25:38,531 --> 01:25:42,580
Not Bring your other phone.
That's the idea behind it. Yeah.

1503
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:44,680
So like you could decide,
well I'm going out,

1504
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:47,620
let me just bring my tiny phone
for essentials. All this tiny,

1505
01:25:47,621 --> 01:25:49,630
I mean the funds are going
to get quote unquote,

1506
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:50,870
phones are just going to get so smart.

1507
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,060
So I say they're going
to come inside of it.

1508
01:25:52,061 --> 01:25:55,090
So you'll have like a little contact lens,
maybe a little thing in your ear.

1509
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:58,810
Maybe like a little permanent implant
in your behind your tooth or one of your

1510
01:25:58,811 --> 01:26:02,110
teeth. They'll replace a
tooth with a computer. Well,

1511
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,010
you pipe it into your nerves.

1512
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,710
Any kinds of crazy stuff you can think
of that it's probably going to happen.

1513
01:26:06,710 --> 01:26:10,220
And some of it, some of it will take,
some of it won't. Right, right. Yeah,

1514
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:12,200
it seems like that's what
we're going to have to see.

1515
01:26:12,201 --> 01:26:15,440
Like how it plays out and that's one of
the things when you were talking about

1516
01:26:15,441 --> 01:26:17,030
scientists that are
working on these things,

1517
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:18,830
they're working on what's
right in front of them.

1518
01:26:18,831 --> 01:26:22,280
They're not looking at the
greater landscape itself
in terms of what the future

1519
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:23,270
holds.
It's not their job.

1520
01:26:23,271 --> 01:26:26,660
And that's why we need other people and
I certainly see myself or those people.

1521
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:30,770
You and who else, who would you elect
if Trump came to you and said, Jamie,

1522
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,820
we've got problems when we need to
figure out the future, what should we do?

1523
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,260
So was certainly the move. We need to
have a mix of different kinds of people.

1524
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:44,030
And so I, I'm certainly people like me
who are kind of big picture futurists.

1525
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:48,200
We need that. We need scientists. I
work with some really incredible sign.

1526
01:26:48,201 --> 01:26:51,530
I did an event at Harvard last week
with George Church who kind of like the

1527
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:53,540
Living Charles Darwin,
David Sinclair,

1528
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,720
who you know has been on this program
is a friend of mine working on life

1529
01:26:56,721 --> 01:27:01,721
extension and we need people
just from all backgrounds.

1530
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:05,480
And so like I would say like we
need people, we need poor people,

1531
01:27:05,481 --> 01:27:09,290
we need people from developing world.
We need to all kinds of people.

1532
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:14,291
But in terms of the people who are kind
of articulating the big picture of the

1533
01:27:14,781 --> 01:27:16,850
world and what are the
challenges that we're facing,

1534
01:27:16,851 --> 01:27:20,410
I certainly put myself in that category.
People like you've all Noah Harari,

1535
01:27:20,420 --> 01:27:23,450
he was just kind of big
also kind of big thinkers.

1536
01:27:23,451 --> 01:27:25,660
People like Sid Mukherjee Am.

1537
01:27:25,661 --> 01:27:30,661
I just think we have to articulate the
big picture and we have to do it in a way

1538
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:35,690
so that people can see themselves
in this story and then,

1539
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:40,010
and then enter into the conversation.
Are you writing this book?

1540
01:27:40,011 --> 01:27:45,011
Just to sort of educate people and let
them understand exactly what is going on

1541
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:51,011
and that it is a really volatile
and chaotic and amazing time.

1542
01:27:52,460 --> 01:27:55,780
And that all these things are, or are
you, or are you doing this book too?

1543
01:27:56,030 --> 01:27:59,000
But what are, what, what
essentially was hacking Dharma look,

1544
01:27:59,001 --> 01:28:03,600
what was the motivation behind it? Was it
for a person like me or was it for the,

1545
01:28:03,601 --> 01:28:07,520
the everyone like is for, for everyone.
And so what I really wanted you to,

1546
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:10,640
so the background's give be gift. I can
give you just a little bit of background.

1547
01:28:10,940 --> 01:28:14,270
So more than 20 years ago I was working
on the National Security Council and my

1548
01:28:14,271 --> 01:28:17,270
then boss, um, Richard Clark,

1549
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:21,530
who was then this obscure White House
official who is jumping up and down saying

1550
01:28:21,531 --> 01:28:26,120
we need to be focusing on terrorism
and al Qaeda and bin Laden.

1551
01:28:26,150 --> 01:28:29,990
And he was trying to tell everybody
and nobody was paying attention to is

1552
01:28:29,991 --> 01:28:31,340
totally marginalized.

1553
01:28:31,340 --> 01:28:36,050
And when nine 11 happened and Dick's
memo was on George Bush's desk saying

1554
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,440
exactly that we need to focus on al Qaeda,
here's what's going to happen to,

1555
01:28:39,441 --> 01:28:43,040
and Dick even before then would always
tell me that if everyone in Washington

1556
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,240
was focusing on one thing,

1557
01:28:44,241 --> 01:28:47,180
you can be sure there was something much
more important that was being missed.

1558
01:28:47,181 --> 01:28:50,160
And so more than 20 years ago,
I was looking around,

1559
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:53,060
I saw all these little pieces of
disparate information and I came to the

1560
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:55,370
conclusion that the genetics revolution
was going to change everything.

1561
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:59,480
So I educated myself,
I started writing articles.

1562
01:28:59,481 --> 01:29:04,350
I was invited to testify before Congress
and then to try to get that story out,

1563
01:29:04,351 --> 01:29:08,820
I was, I started, I wrote my, my two
most recent near term Scifi novels,

1564
01:29:08,821 --> 01:29:12,540
Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata.
And when I was on book tours for those,

1565
01:29:12,541 --> 01:29:14,510
and I explained the science,
uh,

1566
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:18,570
to people the way I kind of a self
educated citizen scientist, um,

1567
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:21,720
and a novelist would explain the science,
all of a sudden people got it.

1568
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,950
And that was when I realized I needed
to write a book about the genetics

1569
01:29:25,951 --> 01:29:28,860
revolution that people could
absorb that wouldn't scare people.

1570
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:33,570
But my mission for the book is that
this stuff, as we've talked about,

1571
01:29:33,571 --> 01:29:37,890
it's so important that everybody
needs to be part of the conversation.

1572
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:41,970
We have this brief window and what I'm
calling for is this species wide dialogue

1573
01:29:41,971 --> 01:29:44,340
on the future of human genetic
and genetic engineering.

1574
01:29:44,341 --> 01:29:48,360
And I have a whole game plan, uh, in
the book about what people can do,

1575
01:29:48,361 --> 01:29:52,950
how they can get involved a people
individually on a national level.

1576
01:29:52,951 --> 01:29:55,950
We have to put a lot of pressure
on our elected leaders and say,

1577
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:57,930
stop focusing on the crap.

1578
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:01,980
There is really important stuff that
needs to be addressed and we need

1579
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:06,270
leadership. I'm going to, I'm speaking
on, uh, in, uh, in Congress, um,

1580
01:30:06,780 --> 01:30:10,380
or week and a half from now
talking about about these dishes.

1581
01:30:10,380 --> 01:30:12,870
So we need to have an,
on an international level,

1582
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:16,470
we have to have some kind
of international system.

1583
01:30:16,471 --> 01:30:18,390
We're so far away from
being able to do that.

1584
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:21,600
We don't even know what the standards are,
but we have to be pushing.

1585
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:25,170
And so I know you think of it in terms
of like the same way we have with look

1586
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:27,690
nuclear weapons. Yeah. In
a way. In many ways. Yeah.

1587
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,900
But the thing is with nuclear weapons,
a lot of that happened at the state level,

1588
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:36,160
at the country level. This needs to
happen at a popular level and at a, uh,

1589
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,020
at a government level.

1590
01:30:37,021 --> 01:30:41,040
So the only way that those that's going
to happen effectively is we need a real

1591
01:30:41,041 --> 01:30:42,870
comprehensive education on the subject.

1592
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,550
It's not something that
people can just guess. Right.

1593
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:49,470
You need to know what's the consequences,
what, where we're at right now. Yeah.

1594
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,520
Right. Yeah. And that's,

1595
01:30:50,521 --> 01:30:53,880
and that's like Sanjay
Gupta had a wonderful quote
that's actually on the cover

1596
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,090
of my book, which is if you can read
one book on the future of our species,

1597
01:30:57,091 --> 01:30:59,490
this is it.
So what I've tried to do is to say like,

1598
01:30:59,491 --> 01:31:02,370
if you just want to go to one place
to understand what's happening,

1599
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:06,360
what's at stake, what it means
for you, and what you can do now.

1600
01:31:06,361 --> 01:31:08,580
If you want to get an involved,
I've tried to do that.

1601
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:11,880
But then ironically I'm now like,
as I mentioned,

1602
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:14,970
being asked to speak to thousands of
doctors and scientists because they're all

1603
01:31:14,971 --> 01:31:19,020
reading this book and they're saying this
is, this is positioning my work in a,

1604
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:20,250
in a much bigger context.

1605
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,870
Sanjaya goop does a very interesting
cat cause he was very anti marijuana and

1606
01:31:24,871 --> 01:31:28,910
then started doing research on it and
then totally flipped 180 degrees. Yeah.

1607
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:33,540
Which to me is a great
sign of both humility and
intelligence I recognize of the

1608
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:36,870
data was different than
his presuppositions. Yeah.

1609
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:40,620
He had these prejudices that
were very common. Yeah. Yeah.

1610
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:44,640
Now when you speak to Congress,
what do you,

1611
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:48,360
do they brief you in terms of like what
they would like specifically for you to

1612
01:31:48,361 --> 01:31:51,500
address? No. So this one, um, it's um,

1613
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:54,690
I've been asked to go and speak in a lot
of members of congress who are going to

1614
01:31:54,691 --> 01:31:57,450
be invited. And what I'm
going to tell them is, look,

1615
01:31:57,451 --> 01:31:59,860
this is really important.

1616
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:04,330
Our congress is not doing enough and
here are the things that we need to do.

1617
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:07,690
And what are you going to say to try
to really get it into their head?

1618
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:10,570
What I'm gonna say is that the
genetics revolution is here.

1619
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:13,630
If we don't have a system,

1620
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:17,590
if you don't have a rational system to
manage it, if we don't have a system.

1621
01:32:17,590 --> 01:32:19,120
You talked about public education.

1622
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:22,450
The challenge that we faced in the United
States is we traditionally have had a

1623
01:32:22,451 --> 01:32:26,440
representative democracy and now we're
transitioning from a representative

1624
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:31,420
democracy to a popular democracy.
So Switzerland has a popular democracy,

1625
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:34,090
but they have like really well
educated people who are able,

1626
01:32:34,091 --> 01:32:36,730
who have enough information
to make smart decisions.

1627
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:41,620
We have an educated our public and yet
the public is making big decisions and a

1628
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:43,420
lot of it is happening
just on a gut feeling.

1629
01:32:43,421 --> 01:32:46,230
That's what's happening with trade
agreements where people just have,

1630
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,170
I have a feeling it's bad without,
you know, the ability to, to,

1631
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:54,250
to really get into the, into the details.
And so we are having that transition,

1632
01:32:54,251 --> 01:32:57,880
which means there's a lot
of responsibility on us to
educate our public and it's

1633
01:32:57,881 --> 01:33:00,550
just, it's a tragedy. We
treat people in this country.

1634
01:33:00,551 --> 01:33:02,760
Like you can just throw
people away like you somebody.

1635
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:07,240
If you're in some crappy school
system and you know your, your,

1636
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:10,720
your chances of success are so minimized,

1637
01:33:10,750 --> 01:33:14,170
not because of anything that you've done
just because of your circumstances and

1638
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,040
it's unacceptable. It is only, I mean,

1639
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:19,690
the equal opportunity is what we
really should all strive for us.

1640
01:33:19,691 --> 01:33:24,691
And I think some people conflate that
with a op equal success and you're not

1641
01:33:26,021 --> 01:33:29,680
going to get the same equality of outcome.
You're going to get different,

1642
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:34,390
different amounts of ever and different
people are qualified or more talented at

1643
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:35,224
different things.

1644
01:33:35,980 --> 01:33:40,120
But what I'm worried about is what I
said initially that some people are going

1645
01:33:40,121 --> 01:33:44,260
to get ahold of this stuff quickly and
it's going to give them an a massive

1646
01:33:44,261 --> 01:33:47,530
advantage. Yes. Sort
of like, I mean if you,

1647
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:51,490
the first person that has the
ability to go forward in time,

1648
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:56,520
five minutes is going to be able to
manipulate the stock market unprecedented

1649
01:33:56,891 --> 01:33:59,830
way. Yeah. I don't think that that's
really possible in our lifetime,

1650
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:01,600
but that's the kind of
thing I'm talking about.

1651
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:04,960
You could get so far ahead that if
we're talking about competition,

1652
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:06,940
there will be no catching up.
They'd big,

1653
01:34:07,030 --> 01:34:12,010
you don't have to travel in time to do
that. Right. But I'm saying if that was,

1654
01:34:12,350 --> 01:34:13,270
if it was algae,

1655
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:16,720
but there's real technologies that are
likely to happen which are going to

1656
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:19,300
confer billions,
tens,

1657
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:24,060
hundreds of billions of dollars of benefit
of advantage. Yeah. And that stuff is,

1658
01:34:24,061 --> 01:34:25,270
is happening now.

1659
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:29,590
And this is the concern with getting
behind countries like China cause if they

1660
01:34:29,591 --> 01:34:30,760
get ahead of us or something like that,

1661
01:34:30,761 --> 01:34:34,420
when they were already moving in this
direction in terms of technology. Yeah.

1662
01:34:34,421 --> 01:34:39,220
So I am a proud American. My father
and grandparents came here as refugees.

1663
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,460
I believe in what this country
at our best stands for.

1664
01:34:42,460 --> 01:34:47,320
I want us to continue to be the country
that setting an example for the rest of

1665
01:34:47,321 --> 01:34:52,321
the world that is articulating what our
ideals of responsibility and governance,

1666
01:34:52,780 --> 01:34:56,920
good governance and accountability and
all these things that we've championed.

1667
01:34:57,260 --> 01:34:58,400
And because of that,

1668
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:03,380
I want us to get our act
together politically and I
want us to be the leading

1669
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:08,270
technological country in the world.
Um, and so I think that's what's,

1670
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:08,971
what's its taken.

1671
01:35:08,971 --> 01:35:12,470
We're losing so much time because there
was a time in the period after the

1672
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:16,520
Second World War where we recognize
that technological leadership was the

1673
01:35:16,521 --> 01:35:18,290
foundation for everything else we were,

1674
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:22,010
we had recreated the world out
of the ashes of the, of the war.

1675
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:24,500
But we realized that we needed
to have the economic growth.

1676
01:35:24,501 --> 01:35:28,890
We needed to have the competition, we
needed to have these technologies and we,

1677
01:35:28,910 --> 01:35:30,380
it was a miracle.
What we've,

1678
01:35:30,381 --> 01:35:34,100
what we've done and now we've lost
our focus and we have to regain it.

1679
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:38,930
The way I look at humans and the way I
look at the human race today in 2019 it's

1680
01:35:38,931 --> 01:35:43,220
like we're driving very fast through fog
and it's very difficult to see what's

1681
01:35:43,221 --> 01:35:44,070
in front of us.
Yep.

1682
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:48,830
When I look back at how long have you
ever written any hg wells but some of his

1683
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:52,160
predictions about the future?
Really interesting cause he, he,

1684
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,830
he was pretty close on quite a few things,

1685
01:35:55,190 --> 01:36:00,020
but that that vision is to be able to
sit there and use your imagination,

1686
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:03,930
close your eyes and think what is
this going to be like, what is, what,

1687
01:36:03,940 --> 01:36:08,770
what we're dealing with now and opposed
to as opposed to what, 2119 right.

1688
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,900
What does, which is similar to
the HG wells versus us. Right.

1689
01:36:12,290 --> 01:36:14,890
What the fuck is that going to be like?
Like yeah.

1690
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:20,290
Is there going to be a time where
there are no diseases there,

1691
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:25,310
there is no death and that we just have
to regulate population control in some

1692
01:36:25,311 --> 01:36:27,560
sort of a other manner and
the only way people die,

1693
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:30,800
they're going to die from accidents
and things along those lines. But,

1694
01:36:30,920 --> 01:36:34,190
but mortality in terms of old age,
I mean this is,

1695
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:38,660
that's a according to Davidson
Claire, this is a fixable issue. Yeah.

1696
01:36:38,661 --> 01:36:40,310
You know how to have,
when they fix it,

1697
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:43,010
they fix it in 20 years
or 30 years or 50 years.

1698
01:36:43,970 --> 01:36:46,700
David is a friend and I and I
have a whole chapter and shit.

1699
01:36:46,701 --> 01:36:48,080
I don't want to misquote.
Nice.

1700
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:52,670
I have a whole chapter in the book on
the science of of human life extension.

1701
01:36:52,671 --> 01:36:56,450
So I think definitely it's real that
we going to live healthier longer.

1702
01:36:56,451 --> 01:36:58,070
We're going to harness
our technology if that.

1703
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:02,390
I don't think that in mortality it that
biological and mortality is in is in the

1704
01:37:02,391 --> 01:37:03,020
cards.

1705
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:06,220
Maybe not in mortality because we'll still
be biologically vulnerable with their

1706
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:09,500
hearts and brains on
stuff, but aging, yeah,

1707
01:37:09,501 --> 01:37:13,250
I think we will age slower and we will
live healthier longer and I think it's,

1708
01:37:13,251 --> 01:37:16,130
it's going to be great.
The back to your ear core point.

1709
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:20,330
I mean that's the reason why I also write
science fiction is that the world of

1710
01:37:20,331 --> 01:37:25,331
science is changing so fast that we really
need to apply a lot of imagination to

1711
01:37:26,661 --> 01:37:30,140
imagine where it's going.
Because if you're just looking
at what's happening now,

1712
01:37:30,440 --> 01:37:33,950
it's like this train is going to speed by,
we have to kind of imagine,

1713
01:37:33,951 --> 01:37:37,490
it's like Wayne Gretzky. We have to
imagine where the puck is going to be,

1714
01:37:37,491 --> 01:37:41,450
not where it is now. I mentioned George
Church who's like, he's at Harvard,

1715
01:37:41,451 --> 01:37:43,580
he's like the the Living Charles Darwin.

1716
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:47,630
And I do a lot of speaking alongside
George and it's become our little thing

1717
01:37:47,631 --> 01:37:51,860
that he says that he reads,
um, science fiction like mine.

1718
01:37:51,861 --> 01:37:54,290
And then imagine says, well, that's
pretty cool. How can we do that?

1719
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:58,920
And what I do is I look at the research
coming out of labs like Georges and I

1720
01:37:58,921 --> 01:38:00,660
sat, right? Well that's where we are now.

1721
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:04,200
What's that going to
mean in 2050 100 years?

1722
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:09,201
And so we have to that the science fiction
plays a more important role than it

1723
01:38:09,241 --> 01:38:11,850
ever has and kind of
imagining where we're going.

1724
01:38:11,851 --> 01:38:16,140
And it's that imagining that
allows us to try to say, well,

1725
01:38:16,141 --> 01:38:18,690
what if that's one of the
options of where we're going?

1726
01:38:19,050 --> 01:38:23,340
What are the decisions that we need to
make now so that we can have a better

1727
01:38:23,341 --> 01:38:25,950
outcome rather than a worst one?
If you're gambling person,

1728
01:38:25,951 --> 01:38:26,970
I don't know if you are.
Yeah,

1729
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:32,060
but if I had to give you 100 bucks
to put on something in 20 years,

1730
01:38:32,641 --> 01:38:35,250
it's going to be profoundly just,

1731
01:38:36,860 --> 01:38:37,820
it changed.

1732
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:42,860
It's going to change us in a way that
is something that we're not really

1733
01:38:43,381 --> 01:38:45,840
prepared to understand or deal with.
What do you think that's going to be?

1734
01:38:45,870 --> 01:38:49,740
I think it's going to be predictive
genetics. They were going to have,

1735
01:38:49,770 --> 01:38:53,340
all right now it's like you go
to your doctor when you're sick.

1736
01:38:53,880 --> 01:38:54,601
You could have been,

1737
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:59,010
this could have been some genetic disorder
that you had from the moment you were

1738
01:38:59,011 --> 01:39:03,990
conceived and it was ticking and it was
ticking and you showed up 50 years later

1739
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:07,560
when that's been manifest.
So it's going to be very different.

1740
01:39:07,561 --> 01:39:12,510
You're taking your kid home
from the hospital, your
newborn, and the doctor says,

1741
01:39:12,511 --> 01:39:14,760
Hey, congratulations.
This is really great,

1742
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:20,330
but just Fyi now your kid has
a 50% greater than average
chance of getting early

1743
01:39:20,341 --> 01:39:24,260
onset Alzheimer's 50 years
from now and your cat.

1744
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:29,100
Your kid has a really great chance
of being phenomenal at abstract math.

1745
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:30,480
Like,
how are we going to think about,

1746
01:39:30,481 --> 01:39:34,620
how are we to think about what it means
to be human when we have all of that

1747
01:39:34,650 --> 01:39:37,920
information? And there are things
now that we call fate and it's, it's,

1748
01:39:37,921 --> 01:39:42,030
it's just a different model. And so
I think that, and once we have that,

1749
01:39:42,031 --> 01:39:43,380
that's gonna change a
lot of a lot of things.

1750
01:39:43,381 --> 01:39:45,780
It's going to fundamentally
transform our health care.

1751
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:47,910
What we call healthcare
now is really sick care.

1752
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:51,080
You show up with a symptom and this is
going to be predictive and it's going to

1753
01:39:51,081 --> 01:39:51,780
change the we,

1754
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:56,780
the way we make babies because people are
going to have real choices about which

1755
01:39:56,941 --> 01:39:58,800
embryos to implant.

1756
01:39:58,890 --> 01:40:02,070
And we're going to have a
lot of information about a
re a lot of really intimate

1757
01:40:02,071 --> 01:40:05,790
stuff. So you feel like genetic
manipulation and genetic engineering,

1758
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:10,670
genetic understanding, genetic knowledge,
and then applied genetic medicine. Yeah.

1759
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:13,020
So those are going to be the big
changes in the next 20 years,

1760
01:40:13,021 --> 01:40:16,680
even more so than technology,
which it's interconnected because these,

1761
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:19,650
there's really, it's like a super
convergence of these technologies.

1762
01:40:19,651 --> 01:40:23,700
So the the genetics revolution is the
artificial intelligence revolution in a

1763
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:27,030
sense that the complexity
of genetics is so great,

1764
01:40:27,031 --> 01:40:31,380
it's way beyond what our brains
on their own could process.

1765
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:33,480
And so really they're,

1766
01:40:33,540 --> 01:40:38,220
all these technologies are touching each
other and so the biological models are

1767
01:40:38,221 --> 01:40:41,490
now influencing the AI.
So for example,

1768
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:45,270
we are coming to the
limits of silicon storage,

1769
01:40:45,750 --> 01:40:50,540
but DNA has unlimited storage capacity.
So it's the,

1770
01:40:50,541 --> 01:40:52,140
the, the, as I've said before,

1771
01:40:52,141 --> 01:40:57,141
the kind of the between biology and AI
or genetics and AI is going to be very

1772
01:40:58,361 --> 01:41:01,300
blurry. Yeah. That is a, an
interesting concept, right?

1773
01:41:01,301 --> 01:41:05,890
The idea of storing information in DNA
and that that has been discussed. Yeah.

1774
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:10,891
Which the DNA is the greatest information
storage mechanism ever imagined that

1775
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:14,410
the question is what happens when you do
store things in there and how does that

1776
01:41:14,411 --> 01:41:17,350
information interact with all the rest
of the stuff that's in your body already?

1777
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,310
Well, I mean if you can do
it in your body, you could,

1778
01:41:19,311 --> 01:41:22,370
doesn't have to be angels nearby body.
Just think of like your,

1779
01:41:22,420 --> 01:41:27,420
your DNA has 4 billion years of history
and it's done a great job of recording

1780
01:41:27,881 --> 01:41:32,290
it. It's incredible. I can, my, my old
eight track tapes, they haven't lasted.

1781
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,520
That is a squirrely concept that you have
all that data inside your head. I mean,

1782
01:41:36,521 --> 01:41:39,220
that's also when people make,

1783
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:43,090
when they try to understand
instincts yeah. That people have,

1784
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:46,390
that these are some sort of
genetically encoded memories, right?

1785
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:49,820
Some understanding of things that
are dangerous and that these, the,

1786
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,980
they're in there because this is how
we've learned over the years without

1787
01:41:53,981 --> 01:41:57,420
actually having experienced these things
personally. Yeah. Yeah. No. So that's,

1788
01:41:57,880 --> 01:42:02,740
it's baked in. Our genetics are
baked into us. And so, you know,

1789
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:04,790
I don't know if you've been to Indonesia,

1790
01:42:04,791 --> 01:42:08,110
but while I was in Indonesia and I went
to this place called Komodo island.

1791
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:10,060
Oh Wow. Well, the, like a motor guides.

1792
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:13,120
And it was fascinating because it's
like you can tell they don't have

1793
01:42:13,121 --> 01:42:15,820
plaintiff's attorney, so here's walking
around. They're all these Komodo dragons.

1794
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:18,130
And so yeah, these are like the
most deadly creatures on earth.

1795
01:42:18,131 --> 01:42:20,320
And there's like some little guy
with a little stick and it's like,

1796
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:23,140
well how effective is that stick?
But the way it works,

1797
01:42:23,141 --> 01:42:25,450
so you're just walking
around just walking around.

1798
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,930
Cause they come over checks when they're
not killing people or killing animals,

1799
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:31,630
they're just sitting there.
And so it's pretty scary.

1800
01:42:31,930 --> 01:42:35,230
Do they ever get jack to people ever go
there and get bitten and they, they say,

1801
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:37,480
oh it's that only a few times a year.
It's like wow, a few times. Yeah,

1802
01:42:37,490 --> 01:42:39,140
that seems like a lot. I
was a year. There's a lot.

1803
01:42:39,460 --> 01:42:41,740
But the way it works for a Komodo Dragon,

1804
01:42:42,580 --> 01:42:47,580
mother lays the egg and then buries the
egg and then forgets where the egg is.

1805
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:53,820
And then let's just say that this egg
hatches and this little Komodo dragon

1806
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:57,610
comes out and the mother sees
her own baby Komodo Dragon.

1807
01:42:57,850 --> 01:43:01,990
She'll eat it in a second. Oh Jesus.
And so if you're a Komodo Dragon,

1808
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:07,320
you better have your entire survival
strategy baked into your DNA because

1809
01:43:07,661 --> 01:43:11,500
nobody's teaching you anything.
And so for us,

1810
01:43:11,740 --> 01:43:14,890
we have this sense that it's like
parenting is really important.

1811
01:43:14,891 --> 01:43:16,870
It is environment is really important.
It is.

1812
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:21,520
But so much of who and what we are is
baked in to our genetics and I think

1813
01:43:21,521 --> 01:43:24,520
that's, that's going to be this challenge
that we're going to see ourselves as

1814
01:43:24,521 --> 01:43:26,230
increasingly genetic beings.

1815
01:43:26,530 --> 01:43:29,950
We can't become genetic determinist
think that we're just genetics,

1816
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,630
but we're going to know a lot more.

1817
01:43:31,631 --> 01:43:35,830
We're going to demystify a lot of
what it means to be human poop. Yeah,

1818
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:39,790
teeth is right, but are we going
to lose the romance and the,

1819
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:42,700
the just the randomness
of life because of that.

1820
01:43:42,701 --> 01:43:45,340
That's what people are
concerned with, right? Like if,

1821
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:48,070
if we have some sort
of genetic uniformity,

1822
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,490
I mean especially in particularly
with like things like intelligence

1823
01:43:52,490 --> 01:43:53,540
and athletic performance,

1824
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:57,230
we're not going to appreciate freaks
as much or maybe we'll all want to be

1825
01:43:57,510 --> 01:44:02,210
freaks. Freaks are the ones who push us
into not going to want to be a moron.

1826
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:06,470
Well, your your question, it's,
it's the essential question.

1827
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:09,080
It's like what makes a human
a human isn't December.

1828
01:44:09,140 --> 01:44:11,690
We have higher Iq that doesn't make you
a better human that makes you someone

1829
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:12,620
with a higher Iq.

1830
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:17,780
But how are we going to think about
constructing societies when it's up to us?

1831
01:44:17,781 --> 01:44:21,860
Like if we are going to say
we value certain people,

1832
01:44:21,861 --> 01:44:24,710
certain ideas,
I think we're going to need artists.

1833
01:44:24,711 --> 01:44:28,850
Like right now people like artists are
sometimes in the mainstream and sometime

1834
01:44:28,851 --> 01:44:29,391
they're on the fringe,

1835
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:32,810
but artists are going to be maybe the
most important people in this new world.

1836
01:44:32,811 --> 01:44:33,140
And right,

1837
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:36,950
like right now in hospitals and we have
kind of a hierarchy and like the most

1838
01:44:36,951 --> 01:44:40,610
technical people are the people who are
valued the most and the least technical

1839
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:41,121
people,

1840
01:44:41,121 --> 01:44:45,350
like some of the nurses or nurse's aides
are the people who are often valued and

1841
01:44:45,351 --> 01:44:46,184
paid the least.

1842
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:51,590
But when technology can do
these technological feats,

1843
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:56,390
what's going to be left is how can
we be great humans? How can we emote?

1844
01:44:56,391 --> 01:44:58,460
How can we connect?
How can we create art?

1845
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:03,560
And if we get swept away by
this tide of science, as in,

1846
01:45:03,590 --> 01:45:07,800
you know, how excited I am about the size
a bit and we could really undermine our

1847
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:10,310
humanity, right? And as for humans,

1848
01:45:10,311 --> 01:45:15,230
what humans value is many aspects
of that humanity are the creations,

1849
01:45:16,420 --> 01:45:20,060
the literature things. We, we, we,

1850
01:45:20,090 --> 01:45:22,330
when you read someone's great pros,
you're,

1851
01:45:22,350 --> 01:45:24,410
you're reading like an
insight into their mind.

1852
01:45:24,411 --> 01:45:26,630
And that's what's interesting
about it, right? He's like, yes,

1853
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:30,170
you're not going to get that
from just ones and Zeros.
Yeah. And that's, and there,

1854
01:45:30,380 --> 01:45:33,650
there will always be this
way we call it mystery.

1855
01:45:33,830 --> 01:45:38,830
And even if we can do a genetic
analysis of Shakespeare and Mozart and,

1856
01:45:39,141 --> 01:45:43,730
and whatever, like it's still miraculous
and we need to celebrate that.

1857
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,563
And we can't,

1858
01:45:44,690 --> 01:45:48,800
we can't allow us to say that we are just
our genetics or even just our biology.

1859
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:52,310
But we also can't just say
biology has nothing to do with it.

1860
01:45:52,311 --> 01:45:56,730
And especially because we're going to
know more about our biology and about our,

1861
01:45:56,731 --> 01:45:58,880
our, our differences. And
that's, that's normal.

1862
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:00,740
I mean it used to be in the
old days that everyone thought,

1863
01:46:00,741 --> 01:46:04,310
well God is weather and now we
understand weather. Pretty much a,

1864
01:46:04,311 --> 01:46:07,550
nobody is saying, oh that lightening,
that's God is delivering a message.

1865
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:08,420
It could be,

1866
01:46:08,420 --> 01:46:12,770
but we still like we still have that
mystery and I think that it's in some ways

1867
01:46:12,771 --> 01:46:14,300
it's about our orientation,

1868
01:46:14,450 --> 01:46:18,590
like how do we make sure that
we keep this view of life,

1869
01:46:18,591 --> 01:46:23,591
that we have artists and humanists who
are just at the core of this conversation

1870
01:46:24,381 --> 01:46:25,190
about where we're going.

1871
01:46:25,190 --> 01:46:28,760
What if that mystery ultimately turns
out to just be ignorance and that as you

1872
01:46:28,761 --> 01:46:31,430
develop more and more understand
and there's less and less mystery,

1873
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:33,500
would we like to be less smart?

1874
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:38,450
What we like to be the more
overwhelmed by possibility?

1875
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:41,450
It could be. I think those would
be part of what romance is.

1876
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:46,480
It could be and certainly like the unknown
every we wake up every morning and we

1877
01:46:46,641 --> 01:46:47,870
just don't know the answer.

1878
01:46:47,871 --> 01:46:51,390
And there's some people like to going
back to the issues of of life extension.

1879
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:53,310
There are some people who say,

1880
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,880
well that death is essential
for appreciating life. I,

1881
01:46:57,881 --> 01:46:59,670
I talk about this stuff all around.

1882
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:03,120
And then there are people who say you and
you're talking about eliminating these

1883
01:47:03,121 --> 01:47:04,230
terrible diseases,

1884
01:47:04,530 --> 01:47:09,530
but I know somebody who had that terrible
disease and their suffering was a gift

1885
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:13,920
to everybody else because we all had
more humanity in response to their

1886
01:47:13,921 --> 01:47:15,600
suffering. I look, well
that's kind of screwed up.

1887
01:47:15,601 --> 01:47:17,640
I'd prefer them to not
have that suffering,

1888
01:47:17,641 --> 01:47:22,310
but to those people were thinking
wacky, it's Wacky, but we need to like,

1889
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:26,220
I totally agree with you that if we allow
ourselves to get swept away with this

1890
01:47:26,221 --> 01:47:27,720
kind of scientific determinism,

1891
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:32,721
if we don't say we really value our
humanistic traditions are artists,

1892
01:47:33,841 --> 01:47:38,580
our cultures, we could get lost
and with have become obsolete,

1893
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:41,520
we could become obsolete,
but we could also just become less human.

1894
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:43,560
And there's something
wonderful and there's magic.

1895
01:47:43,860 --> 01:47:47,280
And do think that monkeys used to
think, man, can't become a human.

1896
01:47:47,281 --> 01:47:49,890
We become less monkey.
You don't know what I'm saying.

1897
01:47:49,891 --> 01:47:54,891
But no being looks in the mirror and
recognizes that they are evolving here.

1898
01:47:55,321 --> 01:47:59,490
We've what we've only been, homo sapiens
are about 300,000 years. Right? Um,

1899
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,620
so we just, it's hard. We know
where we've come from cause you,

1900
01:48:02,621 --> 01:48:05,280
you see all those little charts
from high school biology,

1901
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:10,080
but it's really hard for people to imagine
being something else in the future.

1902
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:13,980
It's, it's, it's outside of
our, of our consciousness.
And So said she will square.

1903
01:48:14,020 --> 01:48:18,090
Yeah. And we are monkeys.
It just that we've redefined
our monkey thing. You know,

1904
01:48:18,091 --> 01:48:20,730
we do it with you in a
little different way.

1905
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:21,990
That's what I was kind of getting out.

1906
01:48:21,991 --> 01:48:24,240
Are you concerned at all
with artificial life?

1907
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:28,800
Are you concerned about the propagation
of, of artificial intelligence? Well,

1908
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:31,830
there are different kinds
of artificial life. So, um,

1909
01:48:32,190 --> 01:48:37,190
one is artificial intelligence and I
know people like Elon Musk and Stephen

1910
01:48:37,240 --> 01:48:41,160
Hawking are, are afraid. Terrified.
Yeah. And I think that, that we need,

1911
01:48:41,190 --> 01:48:42,750
whether it's right or not,

1912
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:46,110
I think it's great for us to focus on
those risks because if we just say, oh,

1913
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:48,630
that's,
that's crazy and we don't focus on it,

1914
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,560
it increases the likelihood
of these bad things happening.

1915
01:48:52,561 --> 01:48:56,010
So Kudos to Elon Musk,
but I also think that we are,

1916
01:48:56,100 --> 01:49:01,100
we're have a long way away from that
threat and we are and we will be enormous

1917
01:49:01,741 --> 01:49:05,900
beneficiaries of these technologies.
And that's why my,

1918
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:07,350
I don't want to sound
like a broken record,

1919
01:49:07,351 --> 01:49:09,450
but that's why I keep saying
it's all about values.

1920
01:49:09,451 --> 01:49:12,720
If I think we should take those threats
very seriously and then say his are so

1921
01:49:12,721 --> 01:49:16,110
abstract and we don't agree on them,
it's true, but like, like Elon Musk,

1922
01:49:16,111 --> 01:49:17,340
I mean they've set up this,

1923
01:49:17,341 --> 01:49:21,060
this institute where to say well what
are the dangers and then what are the

1924
01:49:21,061 --> 01:49:24,750
things that we can do now?
What are standards that we
can integrate for example,

1925
01:49:24,751 --> 01:49:26,490
into our computer programming.

1926
01:49:26,491 --> 01:49:29,790
And so I mentioned my World
Health Organization a committee.

1927
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:31,080
The question is well what are the,

1928
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:36,180
what are the standards
that we can integrate into
scientific culture that's not

1929
01:49:36,181 --> 01:49:39,030
going to cure everything
but it may increase the
likelihood we'll have a better

1930
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:39,900
rather than worse outcome.

1931
01:49:39,930 --> 01:49:44,020
But isn't there an inherent danger in
other companies or other countries rather

1932
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:46,230
not complying with any
standards that we serve?

1933
01:49:46,231 --> 01:49:48,190
Because it would be anti competitive.

1934
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:49,670
Yes. Like that would, that would,

1935
01:49:49,690 --> 01:49:53,440
it would somehow or another diminished
comp competition or diminish their

1936
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:57,040
competitive edge. It's true. And that's
why, and that's the balance that we're,

1937
01:49:57,070 --> 01:50:00,730
we're going to need to need to
hold. It's, and it's really hard,

1938
01:50:01,060 --> 01:50:06,060
but we have a window of opportunity
now to try to get ahead of that.

1939
01:50:06,161 --> 01:50:08,620
And like I said, we have chemical
weapons, biological weapons,

1940
01:50:08,621 --> 01:50:13,390
nuclear weapons where we've
had international standards
that have roughly held,

1941
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:17,110
I mean there was a time when slavery
was the norm and there was a movement to

1942
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:20,440
say this is, this is wrong.
And it was largely successful.

1943
01:50:20,441 --> 01:50:25,240
So we have history of being
more successful rather than,

1944
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:28,780
uh, than less. And I think that's
the goal. But you're right. I mean,

1945
01:50:28,810 --> 01:50:32,440
this is a race between the
technology and the best values.

1946
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:36,610
Mine real concerned about
artificial intelligence is
that this paradigm shifting

1947
01:50:36,611 --> 01:50:40,810
moment will happen before we recognize
it's happening and then it'll be too late.

1948
01:50:40,810 --> 01:50:43,150
Yes, that's exactly right. And
that's like I saying, that's,

1949
01:50:43,300 --> 01:50:44,230
that's why I've written the book.

1950
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:48,370
That's why I'm out on the road so
much talking to people. Why, why?

1951
01:50:48,371 --> 01:50:51,490
It's such an honor for me
to be in pleasure for me
to be here with you talking

1952
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:56,491
about it cause we have to reach out and
I to people when people can't be afraid

1953
01:50:56,860 --> 01:51:00,550
of entering this conversation because it
feels too technical or feels like it's

1954
01:51:00,551 --> 01:51:01,510
somebody else's business.

1955
01:51:01,511 --> 01:51:05,500
This is all of our business because this
is all of our lives and it's all of our

1956
01:51:05,501 --> 01:51:08,350
futures.
So if in the future you think 20 years,

1957
01:51:08,351 --> 01:51:11,840
the thing that's going to really change
the most is predictive genetics and able

1958
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:15,820
be able to predict
accurately a person's health.

1959
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:17,880
What do you help in life,
health and love?

1960
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:22,480
What do you think is going
to be the biggest detriment
for all the stuff and the

1961
01:51:22,481 --> 01:51:26,200
thing that we have to avoid the most?
Yeah, so one is, as I mentioned,

1962
01:51:26,201 --> 01:51:31,201
this determinism just because if we just
10 of take our sense of wonder about

1963
01:51:32,111 --> 01:51:34,600
what it means to be a human away,

1964
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:37,720
like that's really going to harm us.

1965
01:51:37,721 --> 01:51:42,721
We talked about equity and access to
these technologies and the technologies

1966
01:51:42,731 --> 01:51:47,731
don't even need to be real in
order to have a negative impact.

1967
01:51:48,410 --> 01:51:49,810
So in India,

1968
01:51:49,990 --> 01:51:53,650
there are no significant
genetic differences between
people in different castes,

1969
01:51:53,651 --> 01:51:57,280
but the caste system has been maintained
for thousands of years because people

1970
01:51:57,281 --> 01:52:01,480
just have accepted these, uh,
these differences. So this,

1971
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:02,820
it's a whole new way of,

1972
01:52:02,870 --> 01:52:07,360
of understanding what is a human and it's
really going to be complicated and we

1973
01:52:07,361 --> 01:52:09,940
aren't ready for it. We weren't
ready for it. Culturally,

1974
01:52:10,180 --> 01:52:12,100
we aren't ready for it educationally.

1975
01:52:12,101 --> 01:52:16,060
Certainly our political leaders aren't
paying much of any attention to all of us

1976
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:19,000
who have a huge job. Oof. Oof.

1977
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:23,590
So when you sit down and you
give this speech to Congress,

1978
01:52:23,860 --> 01:52:24,670
yeah.
What,

1979
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:29,440
what are you anticipating from them in
terms of like what do you think that

1980
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:33,130
there's anything that they can do
now to absolutely certain steps. Yes.

1981
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,360
So a few things.

1982
01:52:34,361 --> 01:52:38,680
One is we need to have a national
education campaign. I mean,

1983
01:52:38,681 --> 01:52:39,730
this is so important.

1984
01:52:39,731 --> 01:52:44,140
I would say it's on the future of genetics
revolution and of AI because I think

1985
01:52:44,320 --> 01:52:46,100
it's just,
it's crazy

1986
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:51,230
that we aren't focusing on these.
Like I, I learned French in,

1987
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:54,740
in um, in grade school and high
school and I'm happy to speak French,

1988
01:52:55,220 --> 01:53:00,170
but I would rather have people say this
is really important stuff. So that's, uh,

1989
01:53:00,171 --> 01:53:01,004
that's number one.

1990
01:53:01,370 --> 01:53:06,370
Number two is we need to make sure that
we have a functioning regulatory system

1991
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:08,600
in this country and every country,

1992
01:53:08,601 --> 01:53:12,590
and I do a lot of of comparative work
and like the United Kingdom and they're

1993
01:53:12,591 --> 01:53:13,580
really well organized.

1994
01:53:13,581 --> 01:53:17,810
They have a national healthcare system
which allows them at a national level to

1995
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,840
kind of think about longterm care
and the tradeoffs in this country.

1996
01:53:24,020 --> 01:53:26,810
Average person changes
health plans every 18 months.

1997
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:29,540
And I was talking with somebody
the other night and they were,

1998
01:53:29,570 --> 01:53:34,160
they were working on a predictive health
company and they said their first idea

1999
01:53:34,161 --> 01:53:38,540
was they were going to sell
this information to a health
insurers because like,

2000
01:53:38,541 --> 01:53:40,280
wouldn't this be great if you could?

2001
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:42,380
Hell if you're a health
insurer and you could,

2002
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:45,050
you had somebody who was your
client and you could say, hey,

2003
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:45,861
here's some information.

2004
01:53:45,861 --> 01:53:49,040
You can live healthier and you're not
going to have this disease 20 years from

2005
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:50,690
now. And when he found out
is the health insurers,

2006
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:52,970
they could have cared less
because people were just,

2007
01:53:52,971 --> 01:53:55,430
they were only going to be part
of it for a year and a half.

2008
01:53:55,460 --> 01:54:00,460
So we really need to think differently
about how do we invest in people over the

2009
01:54:00,501 --> 01:54:03,710
course of their lives.
And certainly education is one,

2010
01:54:03,711 --> 01:54:06,350
but thinking longterm about
health and wellbeing is another.

2011
01:54:06,650 --> 01:54:11,650
What do you think is going to be the
first technological innovation in terms of

2012
01:54:12,501 --> 01:54:13,250
like what,

2013
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:18,250
what's already on the pipeline right now
that's going to radically alter human

2014
01:54:18,381 --> 01:54:20,900
beings so radically?

2015
01:54:20,901 --> 01:54:24,740
I think it's going to be
the end of procreative sex.

2016
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:30,100
And so when we stop conceiving our babies
through sex and we're selecting our

2017
01:54:30,651 --> 01:54:31,484
embryos,

2018
01:54:31,490 --> 01:54:36,200
that's going to open up this
massive realm of possibility.

2019
01:54:36,290 --> 01:54:41,240
And certainly when we expand the number
of fertilized eggs that were choosing

2020
01:54:41,241 --> 01:54:43,400
from that,
that is really,

2021
01:54:43,401 --> 01:54:47,060
I think that's the kind of the killer
application of genetics to the future of

2022
01:54:47,061 --> 01:54:47,720
human life.

2023
01:54:47,720 --> 01:54:52,250
Do you see that being attainable to the
general population anytime in the near

2024
01:54:52,251 --> 01:54:56,240
future? Like once it starts, once
the technology gets established,

2025
01:54:56,241 --> 01:55:00,080
it seems like it's going to be wealthier
people that are going to have access to

2026
01:55:00,081 --> 01:55:03,590
it first, right? Well it
depends, probably yes.

2027
01:55:03,830 --> 01:55:08,000
But when you think about right now we
have all these people who are born with

2028
01:55:08,001 --> 01:55:11,810
these terrible, in many cases, deadly
genetic diseases and disorders.

2029
01:55:12,290 --> 01:55:17,290
And what is this societal expenditure
for lifetime care for all those people?

2030
01:55:18,111 --> 01:55:20,330
I mean this is huge,
huge amounts of money.

2031
01:55:20,660 --> 01:55:25,030
So if we were to eliminate many
of not the people, but eliminate,

2032
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:30,160
prevent those disease diseases and
disorders from taking place in the first

2033
01:55:30,891 --> 01:55:34,790
place, and we could use that
money to provide, to provide, um,

2034
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:38,930
IVF and embryo screening to everybody
using just the economic models now.

2035
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,480
But then there's another issue
that we have to talk about this.

2036
01:55:41,510 --> 01:55:45,570
It's really sensitive. So I talk a
lot about this. Um, but there are,

2037
01:55:45,571 --> 01:55:50,490
and I talk in the book about people
with Down Syndrome and I have a lot of

2038
01:55:50,491 --> 01:55:53,040
friends who have kids
with downs downstairs,

2039
01:55:53,041 --> 01:55:57,120
but these Keller wonderful kids and they
deserve every opportunity to thrive the

2040
01:55:57,121 --> 01:56:01,050
same as as everybody else. And I'm really
sensitive because people say, well, Hey,

2041
01:56:01,051 --> 01:56:04,410
if you're, and I say like down
syndrome is largely not going there.

2042
01:56:04,411 --> 01:56:07,440
I'm going to be newborns with Down
Syndrome 10 or 20 years from now.

2043
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,350
So we will say,
well what are you saying about my kids?

2044
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:15,300
Like are you saying that if this is
going to be eliminated that my kid has a

2045
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:19,980
less of a right to be as somebody else.
And I always say absolutely not.

2046
01:56:19,981 --> 01:56:24,090
And we need to be extremely sensitive
that we're not dehumanizing people.

2047
01:56:24,930 --> 01:56:26,120
But if you have fifth,

2048
01:56:26,121 --> 01:56:31,121
10 or 15 fertilized eggs in a lab and
you have to pick which one gets implanted

2049
01:56:31,650 --> 01:56:36,600
in the mother and one of them will just
has a disease like taste acts or sickle

2050
01:56:36,601 --> 01:56:40,020
cell disease where they're going
to die before they're 10 years old,

2051
01:56:40,530 --> 01:56:45,530
would you choose affirmatively choose to
implant that embryo versus the nine or

2052
01:56:46,861 --> 01:56:48,960
14 or whatever the number
is of of other ones.

2053
01:56:48,961 --> 01:56:53,760
And so these are really sensitive things
and we can't be blahzay about them.

2054
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:54,360
Um,

2055
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,590
but we will have these choices and we're
going to have to figure out how do we

2056
01:56:58,591 --> 01:56:59,460
make them,
well,

2057
01:56:59,461 --> 01:57:04,140
I think there's also a real possibility
of them being able to fix that. Yeah.

2058
01:57:04,200 --> 01:57:07,500
And some things will be fixable and
some things won't. And so that's,

2059
01:57:07,800 --> 01:57:12,000
that's why though for these, for these
single gene mutation, uh, disorders,

2060
01:57:12,360 --> 01:57:15,390
now there's a debate. I was speaking
in Berkeley, uh, the other day.

2061
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:20,090
And so I was talking about
these two options. One is
embryo selection and one is,

2062
01:57:20,110 --> 01:57:23,820
is gene editing. And so there were
different people who got up, says, oh no,

2063
01:57:23,821 --> 01:57:27,300
we can do embryo selection.
That's the way and that we should,

2064
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:29,100
we should prevent these diseases.

2065
01:57:29,101 --> 01:57:33,810
But gene editing that's going too
far. That's, that's playing God.

2066
01:57:33,811 --> 01:57:37,320
And so for different things, there'll
be different options. Do you, when you,

2067
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:39,840
when you hear that,
that that's going too far.

2068
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:45,060
W who's usually saying that there's
two groups in one is certainly in the

2069
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:48,630
religious community were saying,
well this is his plan gun. Um,

2070
01:57:48,690 --> 01:57:52,860
but there's another kind of,
it's like a progressive community who's,

2071
01:57:52,890 --> 01:57:56,910
who are the kinds of people who were
uncomfortable with genetically modified

2072
01:57:56,911 --> 01:58:00,260
crops and people who are
saying that once that the,

2073
01:58:00,300 --> 01:58:04,200
that there's this slippery slope that
once we start making what are called

2074
01:58:04,201 --> 01:58:06,990
germline genetic modification.
So germline is that our,

2075
01:58:07,290 --> 01:58:10,470
our sperm eggs and embryos,
if you make a change to an adult human,

2076
01:58:10,471 --> 01:58:11,520
it doesn't pass to their kids.

2077
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:15,660
If you make a change to a sperm and
egg or an embryo, it will pass on.

2078
01:58:15,690 --> 01:58:17,760
And so there are a lot of
people who are saying, well,

2079
01:58:17,761 --> 01:58:21,540
we don't understand the genetics well
enough to make these changes that will

2080
01:58:21,541 --> 01:58:23,910
last forever. I'm not
in that, in that view.

2081
01:58:23,911 --> 01:58:25,710
I just think that we need to be cautious.

2082
01:58:25,711 --> 01:58:29,430
I may need to weigh the Ben the risks and
the benefits of everything that we do.

2083
01:58:29,490 --> 01:58:32,510
Do you think we do know enough
about those changes in order?

2084
01:58:32,910 --> 01:58:36,750
It depends because if we're, it depends
on what we're selecting against.

2085
01:58:36,751 --> 01:58:40,020
Like if the thing we're selecting
against is some kind of terrible genetic

2086
01:58:40,021 --> 01:58:42,820
disease that's going to somebody
when they're a little kid,

2087
01:58:43,120 --> 01:58:47,940
we have a lot of latitude because
the alternative is death. Right?

2088
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:52,690
And that's why I was so critical of this
Chinese, um, biophysicist who created,

2089
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:55,720
who genetically engineered these two
little girls born in China last year

2090
01:58:55,721 --> 01:59:00,160
because he wasn't in the gene edits,
they weren't probably weren't successful.

2091
01:59:00,430 --> 01:59:04,240
It wasn't to eliminate
some disease or disorder.

2092
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:06,930
He was trying to confer the benefit of a,

2093
01:59:07,060 --> 01:59:09,280
of increased resistance to HIV.

2094
01:59:09,281 --> 01:59:13,030
And so I think that we need to be very
mindful and we need to be doing kind of a

2095
01:59:13,031 --> 01:59:17,050
cost benefit analysis of the different
things at different interventions.

2096
01:59:17,080 --> 01:59:21,380
And there was an unintended side
effect of this war, the believer,

2097
01:59:21,410 --> 01:59:25,660
perceived potential, unintended side
effect. And that's increased intelligence.

2098
01:59:25,850 --> 01:59:29,710
It's a, it's a possibility. So how
did this gene, so this gene is,

2099
01:59:29,711 --> 01:59:32,470
it's called a CCR five is this gene.

2100
01:59:32,710 --> 01:59:37,710
And when it was disrupted
in some mouse studies,

2101
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:42,340
those mice became a little
bit able to navigate mazes.

2102
01:59:42,580 --> 01:59:47,050
And so that was what led people to believe
that this disruption of the CCR five

2103
01:59:47,080 --> 01:59:51,220
could potentially lead to that kind of
change in human. Nobody really knows.

2104
01:59:51,221 --> 01:59:55,420
There's lots of things that happen in mice
that don't have analogs in, in humans.

2105
01:59:55,421 --> 01:59:59,800
And that was why it was so irresponsible
is that this, this scientist in secret,

2106
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:03,130
um, made these, uh, these gene gene edits,

2107
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:07,750
he didn't get a proper consent
from the parents. Um, yeah,

2108
02:00:07,960 --> 02:00:12,130
yes. And enhanced China
because it's China. Rod. Yeah.
I mean, he can, they were,

2109
02:00:12,131 --> 02:00:16,150
the parents were all manipulated and
it's real. Yeah. And so that's the thing.

2110
02:00:16,151 --> 02:00:20,620
So you're exactly right. Like we're
humans, we're nuts as a species and so,

2111
02:00:20,860 --> 02:00:25,860
and so we need to try to establish some
kind of guide rails guard rails about

2112
02:00:27,101 --> 02:00:29,470
what's okay, what we're comfortable
with, what we're, what we're not.

2113
02:00:29,530 --> 02:00:33,520
Now this guy is not operating
in an isolated incidence.

2114
02:00:33,550 --> 02:00:36,930
There's gotta be a shit ton of that
going on right now as we're talking,

2115
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:40,120
it's China. What do you think is
happening over there? And I think it,

2116
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:42,820
China has a lot of money.

2117
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:47,620
They have brilliant people and they
have a government that is hell bent on

2118
02:00:47,621 --> 02:00:52,120
leading the world in advanced
technology and thick.

2119
02:00:52,121 --> 02:00:56,950
The scientific culture in China is
just a very different than it is here.

2120
02:00:56,980 --> 02:01:01,840
And so we know what we know, but we don't
know what we don't know. And that's,

2121
02:01:01,841 --> 02:01:02,680
it's a really,

2122
02:01:02,681 --> 02:01:07,681
really big deal because China is in
many ways a wild west and the technology

2123
02:01:09,371 --> 02:01:13,480
exists to do some really big stuff.
And that's,

2124
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:18,070
that's why we have to at least
try to establish standards.

2125
02:01:18,071 --> 02:01:21,640
Will we succeed? Fully know, but maybe
we can do better than, than worse.

2126
02:01:21,670 --> 02:01:25,150
Are you anticipating seeing like a lot
of freaky things come out of China? Yes.

2127
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:28,600
Whoa. You said that very quick. Yeah,
no, it's true. I suppose I spend,

2128
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:33,850
I spend a lot of time in China I,
and this, it's a different name,

2129
02:01:33,851 --> 02:01:37,570
but the thing with China,
China had this great ancient civilization,

2130
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:43,140
but they destroyed their own civilization
in the great leap forward and the

2131
02:01:43,340 --> 02:01:44,780
Cultural Revolution. They,
they burned their books.

2132
02:01:44,781 --> 02:01:48,620
They smashed their own and
historic relics and so it's really,

2133
02:01:48,621 --> 02:01:53,240
it's a society many ways that starting
from scratch and so all of these norms

2134
02:01:53,241 --> 02:01:55,910
that people get inherit
through their traditions.

2135
02:01:56,150 --> 02:02:00,110
China in many ways doesn't
have and so and so it's,

2136
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:03,320
it's a very different,
and China is growing.

2137
02:02:03,350 --> 02:02:08,350
I mean they are increasingly powerful
and China is going to be a major voice if

2138
02:02:08,640 --> 02:02:11,300
forced,
defining the world of the 21st century.

2139
02:02:11,301 --> 02:02:12,980
That's why America has
to get its act together.

2140
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:14,720
That's a hard concept for us to grasp.

2141
02:02:14,720 --> 02:02:17,060
When we think about the fact
that they had the Great Wall,

2142
02:02:17,061 --> 02:02:19,790
they have so much ancient
art and architecture.

2143
02:02:19,970 --> 02:02:24,830
We just assume they're a really old
culture. They are, but they wiped it out.

2144
02:02:24,940 --> 02:02:27,650
That's crazy.
That's why if you want to see,

2145
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:31,700
if you want to see great Chinese art,
you have to go to Taiwan.

2146
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:35,720
Because when the Chinese nationalists
left in 1949 when they lost,

2147
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:37,670
as they were losing the civil war,

2148
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:42,320
they took the treasures and they put
them in the National Museum of Taiwan in

2149
02:02:42,321 --> 02:02:44,390
the cultural revolution,
the great leap forward,

2150
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:48,080
kind of the red guards were just
smashing all of their own stuff,

2151
02:02:48,081 --> 02:02:52,400
their own ancient history. Now, now the
Chinese Communist Party is saying, oh no,

2152
02:02:52,401 --> 02:02:55,790
we're going back and we have this
great 5,000 year old culture.

2153
02:02:55,791 --> 02:02:56,810
And some ways it's true,

2154
02:02:56,811 --> 02:03:01,640
but in some ways it's like an adolescent
culture without these kinds of

2155
02:03:01,641 --> 02:03:05,360
restrictions that other societies have
got such a unique perspective that I

2156
02:03:05,361 --> 02:03:06,440
haven't heard before.

2157
02:03:07,060 --> 02:03:11,210
And it makes so much sense in terms of
like how frantic they are restructuring

2158
02:03:11,211 --> 02:03:12,680
their world. Yeah. Yeah. And,

2159
02:03:12,681 --> 02:03:16,040
and they feel that they got screwed
over because there is this, this vague,

2160
02:03:16,070 --> 02:03:19,100
the sense of Chinese greatness.
When you hear the word middle kingdom,

2161
02:03:19,101 --> 02:03:21,560
it's like China, the center of
the world and everybody else,

2162
02:03:21,620 --> 02:03:23,300
some kind of of tributary.

2163
02:03:23,720 --> 02:03:28,720
And so their monumentally pissed off
that these colonial powers came and

2164
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:32,000
overpowered them and they had
to make all these concessions.

2165
02:03:32,001 --> 02:03:36,910
They had to give land away and and hell
bent on regaining weight gaining and are

2166
02:03:36,920 --> 02:03:37,940
playing the long game.

2167
02:03:37,970 --> 02:03:40,910
They are playing a long game and we have
to be and we are not and we have to be

2168
02:03:40,911 --> 02:03:42,980
mindful of it. That's
also salty. You can do,

2169
02:03:42,981 --> 02:03:45,200
if you have complete
control of your population,

2170
02:03:45,201 --> 02:03:49,070
you don't have to worry about people's
opinions or you can just go in the

2171
02:03:49,071 --> 02:03:53,090
direction that you feel is
going to benefit the Chinese
power, the power that be,

2172
02:03:53,190 --> 02:03:55,070
wait,
this is a country run by engineers.

2173
02:03:55,070 --> 02:03:59,750
We per country run largely by lawyers
and and and reality TV people I guess.

2174
02:03:59,810 --> 02:04:01,860
Yeah,
but in China it's run by engineers.

2175
02:04:01,880 --> 02:04:04,520
So there are all these problems and
the answer is always engineering.

2176
02:04:04,521 --> 02:04:06,410
So if you have a population problem,

2177
02:04:06,411 --> 02:04:09,090
it's the answer is the one child
policy environmental problem.

2178
02:04:09,091 --> 02:04:12,710
You have Three Gorges Dam there. You
don't have water in the north of China.

2179
02:04:12,711 --> 02:04:16,940
You build this massive biggest water
project in the world from south to north.

2180
02:04:16,941 --> 02:04:20,600
You want to win in the Olympics,
you engineer your population,

2181
02:04:20,601 --> 02:04:23,360
you take kids away from their families
and put them in their Olympic sports

2182
02:04:23,361 --> 02:04:25,640
school.
So I write about this in Genesis Code.

2183
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:30,140
If you're China and you kind of have
this Plato's republic model of the world

2184
02:04:30,141 --> 02:04:34,040
and work on to kind of identify the
genetic or maybe manipulate these genetic

2185
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:38,370
superstars to be our greatest scientists
and mathematicians and business leaders

2186
02:04:38,371 --> 02:04:43,200
and political leaders like there a model
that you can imagine for for how to do

2187
02:04:43,201 --> 02:04:47,190
it. Wow. It makes you
really nervous. It should,

2188
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:52,710
yes.
That's why like,

2189
02:04:52,740 --> 02:04:54,360
I just feel like with this country,

2190
02:04:54,361 --> 02:04:59,361
we don't have time to have all these
distractions that we're focusing on junk.

2191
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:05,340
Like what it just like all of this,
you, I'm on CNN all the time when I'm,

2192
02:05:05,341 --> 02:05:07,830
when I'm home in New York and
I always say like you guys,

2193
02:05:08,150 --> 02:05:10,320
and I'm talking about kind
of geopolitical issues,

2194
02:05:10,321 --> 02:05:13,830
China and North Korea and when I always
say it's like you guys recognize this is

2195
02:05:13,831 --> 02:05:16,250
porn like CNN and Mspb.

2196
02:05:16,310 --> 02:05:21,150
That's like one kind of porn and Fox
and, and whoever else, info wars.

2197
02:05:21,151 --> 02:05:24,630
That's another kind of porn,
but it's all porn and we're just kind of,

2198
02:05:24,660 --> 02:05:28,440
we're drawing people's
attention to these few stories,

2199
02:05:28,770 --> 02:05:31,870
but there's these big stories
that we have to focus on. And,

2200
02:05:31,871 --> 02:05:36,871
and certainly the rise of China is such
an essential story for the 21st century

2201
02:05:37,531 --> 02:05:41,820
because China is competing in all
of these technologies. And China,

2202
02:05:41,821 --> 02:05:45,960
it's like go, go, go. I mean people in
China who were involved in the tech world,

2203
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:49,650
when they go and visit silicon
valley uniformly, they say,

2204
02:05:49,651 --> 02:05:52,410
we cannot believe these
people are so lazy. Like,

2205
02:05:52,411 --> 02:05:54,930
why are they not working 24 hours a day?

2206
02:05:54,931 --> 02:05:59,280
Why are they not issuing product
new products every, uh, every week?

2207
02:05:59,281 --> 02:06:00,720
And so this is,
I mean,

2208
02:06:00,721 --> 02:06:05,721
they are racing somewhere and it's
going to have huge implications for the

2209
02:06:06,151 --> 02:06:09,720
world. And so if we believe in
our values as I believe we should,

2210
02:06:10,140 --> 02:06:13,260
we have to fight for them in the place
that we have to fight for him first is

2211
02:06:13,261 --> 02:06:15,300
here and we can't,
you know,

2212
02:06:15,301 --> 02:06:19,920
it's just like every day that we're
just focusing on this, this drama,

2213
02:06:19,921 --> 02:06:23,400
this reality TV drama of our
government is another day.

2214
02:06:23,520 --> 02:06:26,340
We're not focusing on the big things.
How are we going to get our act together?

2215
02:06:26,340 --> 02:06:28,720
How are we going to lead
the world and technology?

2216
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:31,740
I mean another example
is this is immigration.

2217
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:33,870
I think we have this whole fight
or how do we keep people out?

2218
02:06:33,871 --> 02:06:36,790
What I'd like to do is to go
to to the State Department.

2219
02:06:36,810 --> 02:06:40,380
I write every embassy in the world,
you have a new job. You have to,

2220
02:06:40,381 --> 02:06:43,110
we're going to give you whatever,
a number 500 slots per year.

2221
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:47,550
You have to in your country find
the 500 most brilliant, talented,

2222
02:06:47,580 --> 02:06:51,990
creative, entrepreneurial people and
say, we're giving you a green card.

2223
02:06:52,650 --> 02:06:54,030
We're going to give you
a little starter money.

2224
02:06:54,031 --> 02:06:59,031
We want you to move to the United States
and just start a life and have kids and

2225
02:06:59,401 --> 02:07:01,680
if we we,
we should be creaming the crop,

2226
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:06,150
skimming the cream over the rest of the
world. I think we could take over, we,

2227
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:07,920
we could revitalize this country,

2228
02:07:07,921 --> 02:07:12,921
but we're having this fight of how do we
keep a small number of refugees out and

2229
02:07:13,021 --> 02:07:17,190
it's just we're not focusing on the
right things. That's a, that's again,

2230
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:20,700
another very, very interesting
perspective. We are,

2231
02:07:20,730 --> 02:07:24,720
we learned about Huawei in this
country really. Not just, well,

2232
02:07:24,721 --> 02:07:27,840
I learned about it because they put
out some pretty innovative phones and

2233
02:07:28,410 --> 02:07:29,700
interesting technology,

2234
02:07:30,180 --> 02:07:33,270
but we learned it because
the State Department was
telling people to stop using

2235
02:07:33,271 --> 02:07:36,310
their phones. Yep. Do
you think that is trying

2236
02:07:36,310 --> 02:07:38,440
to stifle the competition?

2237
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,810
Like to try to look good cause
the market share that they have,

2238
02:07:40,811 --> 02:07:45,460
if they do really have number the number
two selling cell phones in the world

2239
02:07:45,461 --> 02:07:50,140
now that's not from America. Americans
largely out of that conversation. Right.

2240
02:07:50,860 --> 02:07:52,270
And if they were in America,

2241
02:07:52,271 --> 02:07:55,870
they would probably dominate in America
as well because they're cheaper. Yeah.

2242
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:59,590
And they're really good. Yeah. I mean
they're, they, they're phones are insane.

2243
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:02,140
The cameras on their
phones are off the charts.

2244
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:05,170
They put some video of the,

2245
02:08:05,200 --> 02:08:10,060
the zoom capability of their newest
phone and people were calling bullshit.

2246
02:08:10,061 --> 02:08:11,620
There's like,
there's no way that's not even possible.

2247
02:08:11,621 --> 02:08:15,500
But it turns out it was true. They
really can. It really can zoom. Yeah.

2248
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:18,160
Like a super expensive telephoto Lens.
Yes.

2249
02:08:18,470 --> 02:08:22,420
Yeah. Yeah. So Huawei,
it's a complicated stew.

2250
02:08:22,421 --> 02:08:27,421
I for sure the founder of Walway is a
former Chinese military officer for sure.

2251
02:08:28,201 --> 02:08:31,240
Sure.
In the early stages of their company,

2252
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:36,420
they stole straight out stole lots of
source code from companies like Cisco.

2253
02:08:37,630 --> 02:08:38,110
Um,

2254
02:08:38,110 --> 02:08:43,110
for sure we should be really worried
if Huawei is the sole supplier of the

2255
02:08:44,651 --> 02:08:49,120
infrastructure that supports 5g all
around the world because the Chinese

2256
02:08:49,121 --> 02:08:52,120
government would have
access to everything.

2257
02:08:52,121 --> 02:08:53,920
And so that leads us
to the question is one,

2258
02:08:54,730 --> 02:08:58,400
is there a problem with
Walway itself? Um, and,

2259
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:00,250
but then two is let's just say,

2260
02:09:00,251 --> 02:09:04,190
and I inciting the answer to that
first question is probably yes. Um,

2261
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:09,520
but then the question too is let's just
say who all way is a legit company and

2262
02:09:09,521 --> 02:09:13,390
they're not totally intimately
connected to the Chinese government.

2263
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:16,750
Can we trust their relationship
with the Chinese government?

2264
02:09:16,750 --> 02:09:20,370
And the Chinese government has a rule
that every one of these companies has the

2265
02:09:20,410 --> 02:09:23,260
big Chinese national companies,
national champion companies,

2266
02:09:23,500 --> 02:09:27,970
they have a communist party
sell inside of that company.

2267
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:29,350
And so these,
like,

2268
02:09:29,351 --> 02:09:33,370
I think that we can't think of big
Chinese companies just like we think of

2269
02:09:33,371 --> 02:09:37,600
companies here. We have to think
of them as quasi state actors.

2270
02:09:37,601 --> 02:09:41,440
And that's why this, this fight that's
happening right now is, is so important.

2271
02:09:41,441 --> 02:09:45,280
And that's why like when China is out
investing in different parts of the world,

2272
02:09:45,281 --> 02:09:46,120
including Africa,

2273
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:50,440
their companies are kind of acting
like arms of the government.

2274
02:09:50,490 --> 02:09:54,820
They're making all kinds of investments
that don't really make sense.

2275
02:09:54,880 --> 02:09:57,040
If you just see,
well this is a company doing something.

2276
02:09:57,041 --> 02:10:01,180
If you say that this is a company with
backing by the state that's fulfilling a

2277
02:10:01,181 --> 02:10:05,380
function that supports the state, it's,
it's just, it's a very different model.

2278
02:10:05,381 --> 02:10:09,280
So I, I am actually quite
concerned about, uh,

2279
02:10:09,281 --> 02:10:13,330
about Huawei and I'm not a
fan of everything that this
administration is doing,

2280
02:10:13,331 --> 02:10:17,020
but I think on, on China, it's
important that we need to stand up.

2281
02:10:17,021 --> 02:10:20,430
And I think pushing back on Walway
is the right thing to do. I'm on to

2282
02:10:20,490 --> 02:10:23,250
about this for two reasons. One.
I'm uncomfortable about that,

2283
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:27,000
about the Chinese government being
inexorably connected to this global

2284
02:10:27,001 --> 02:10:28,530
superpower in technology.

2285
02:10:28,830 --> 02:10:33,650
But I'm also uncomfortable that it's sets
a precedent for other nations follow.

2286
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:34,130
Yeah.
Because

2287
02:10:34,130 --> 02:10:35,840
they're like,
look as the only way to compete,

2288
02:10:35,841 --> 02:10:38,900
because what you were talking about
the investments that Walway or that the

2289
02:10:38,901 --> 02:10:41,930
Chinese government makes
in these other countries,

2290
02:10:41,931 --> 02:10:44,930
and they don't seem to make sense if
you're just dealing with a company, right.

2291
02:10:44,990 --> 02:10:48,440
But if you're dealing with someone
who's trying to take over the world,

2292
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:49,940
it makes a lot of sense.

2293
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:53,570
And so when we have our companies that
you're out in someplace in Africa and

2294
02:10:53,571 --> 02:10:57,680
you're competing with a Chinese
company and to do something,

2295
02:10:57,681 --> 02:10:58,880
build a port or whatever,

2296
02:10:59,330 --> 02:11:03,620
and you're competing because you are an
American company and so you have your

2297
02:11:03,621 --> 02:11:06,530
cactus ideas, the poor, what's the
income stream going to be about it?

2298
02:11:06,531 --> 02:11:10,490
And you have a certain amount that you
can bid because otherwise it becomes a

2299
02:11:10,491 --> 02:11:14,810
bad investment. But if the Chinese
company is that their calculus is not,

2300
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:16,460
is this a good or bad investment?

2301
02:11:16,460 --> 02:11:21,460
It's what is the state
interest in controlling or
quasi controlling this asset.

2302
02:11:22,220 --> 02:11:26,690
And so that's why we can't project
ourselves onto the Chinese.

2303
02:11:26,691 --> 02:11:29,180
We can't say they're just like us.
Just different.

2304
02:11:29,460 --> 02:11:31,550
We have different models and
our models are competing.

2305
02:11:31,760 --> 02:11:35,570
Do you think that we should avoid while
we products like consumer, should I,

2306
02:11:35,600 --> 02:11:40,600
well I think the government should very
tightly regulate products like a Walway

2307
02:11:42,410 --> 02:11:46,960
products because some of their
network routers or exactly,

2308
02:11:47,210 --> 02:11:52,190
they've shown that they, they're using
them to extract information. And so we've,

2309
02:11:52,191 --> 02:11:55,070
we have a long history of European,
Japanese,

2310
02:11:55,071 --> 02:11:58,040
half Korean companies that
have invested very well.

2311
02:11:58,041 --> 02:12:00,410
They've out competed us and we've,
we've allowed,

2312
02:12:00,411 --> 02:12:04,280
we allowed the Japanese companies to
outcompete our auto manufacturers.

2313
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:05,030
And that was,

2314
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:10,030
that was fine in the sense it are in the
1970s our cars had become shit because

2315
02:12:11,210 --> 02:12:12,710
we had this monopoly.

2316
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:16,850
And so I'm all for open competition
and I'm all for free trade.

2317
02:12:16,850 --> 02:12:20,060
It has to be fair.
But I think that what China is doing,

2318
02:12:20,061 --> 02:12:25,061
China recognized as a state that they
could use the tools of capitalism to

2319
02:12:26,511 --> 02:12:29,480
achieve state ends. And I think we
need to be very cautious about that.

2320
02:12:30,020 --> 02:12:32,780
That's interesting that you'd compare
it to the automotive market because the

2321
02:12:32,781 --> 02:12:35,600
consequences are so much different.
Right. So much different cause,

2322
02:12:35,630 --> 02:12:38,960
but we do have a model to go on.
We could see what happened. We did,

2323
02:12:38,961 --> 02:12:42,950
we made shitty cars. The Japanese took
over and then we made better cars.

2324
02:12:42,951 --> 02:12:47,930
Like I have a rental car here. I'm in
Los Angeles. And I went to the, to the,

2325
02:12:47,931 --> 02:12:48,230
um,

2326
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:53,090
the rental car place said at lax and
they had all of the different cars and

2327
02:12:53,091 --> 02:12:57,950
there was like a, a Nissan and
Toyota and there was a Cadillac.

2328
02:12:58,160 --> 02:13:00,740
And for the fact that, you know, I
said I'm going to go with the caddy.

2329
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:04,670
So it's a great car, I think
are amazing. Incredible.

2330
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:07,490
American cars are very good now.
They're great.

2331
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:11,510
And then so like I'm all for competition,
but I just feel like what Chinese,

2332
02:13:11,540 --> 02:13:16,070
some Chinese companies are doing, it's
not competition. It's, they have become,

2333
02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:20,060
not all of them, but quasi state actors.
And if that's what they're doing,

2334
02:13:20,061 --> 02:13:24,350
I think we need to respond to
them in that way. Interesting. Um,

2335
02:13:24,351 --> 02:13:25,820
what else should we be concerned with,

2336
02:13:25,821 --> 02:13:28,670
which will be concerned with anything
that North Korea is doing? Oh, absolutely.

2337
02:13:28,671 --> 02:13:32,100
So I, I have, um, spent a lot of time

2338
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:34,770
in North Korea. That's why I
brought it up. Yeah. So I've, um,

2339
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,650
I advised the North Korea, North Korean
government and the establishment of,

2340
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:39,840
of special economic zones,

2341
02:13:39,841 --> 02:13:44,250
which I certainly believe if North
Korea could have economic growth and

2342
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:47,550
integrate into the rest of the world,
that would be great. And so I've, I, um,

2343
02:13:47,620 --> 02:13:51,510
when you went all this was in 2015
now, but I've been there twice. Um,

2344
02:13:51,540 --> 02:13:55,860
cross the border from China
and zigzag the country by land,

2345
02:13:55,861 --> 02:13:59,970
visited 10 or 12 different sites.
So spent almost two weeks by Lance.

2346
02:13:59,971 --> 02:14:04,450
I've really incredible.
I mean, North Korea, um,

2347
02:14:04,500 --> 02:14:09,090
one, it's the most organized
place I've ever seen. I mean,

2348
02:14:09,091 --> 02:14:12,590
there's not anywhere, there's
like on the side of the road, the,

2349
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:17,040
the stones are all raked. There's not
a stick. Every little line is drawn.

2350
02:14:17,041 --> 02:14:21,480
It's like total control. There were
very, in the, in the agricultural areas,

2351
02:14:21,481 --> 02:14:24,950
there were very few machines
and very few farm animals.

2352
02:14:24,950 --> 02:14:26,820
So I saw people pulling
plows like you know,

2353
02:14:26,840 --> 02:14:30,570
usually have the animal in front of
the plow and the person behind here,

2354
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:34,590
there were like two people in front of
the plow and one person behind the people

2355
02:14:34,591 --> 02:14:39,590
where the, the uh, the animals and we
would go and visit these. They just,

2356
02:14:39,600 --> 02:14:40,381
cause they didn't,
they,

2357
02:14:40,381 --> 02:14:42,450
a lot of the animals got eaten
when they had their famine.

2358
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:47,970
And so we visited these different sites
for the special economic zones and they

2359
02:14:47,971 --> 02:14:51,990
would say like what they had done and
what they were thinking about doing.

2360
02:14:52,080 --> 02:14:55,650
And I would say like, how do you, do
you know anything about the market?

2361
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:57,870
Like do you, what are you going
to sell here? And they said,

2362
02:14:57,871 --> 02:15:01,950
well we know about clearing land
and building a fence. And then we,

2363
02:15:02,130 --> 02:15:07,130
we went to Pyongyang and I spoke to
about 400 economic planners and I said,

2364
02:15:07,531 --> 02:15:10,590
look, I know you have these plans
that to the special economic zones,

2365
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:12,630
it's totally going to fail
the way it's going to work.

2366
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:15,840
You have to connect to the market economy.
You have to empower your workers,

2367
02:15:16,080 --> 02:15:19,620
you need information flow.
How else are you going to learn and adapt?

2368
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:21,690
So North Korea,

2369
02:15:21,691 --> 02:15:26,310
it's a really dangerous place and
now it's even more dangerous because,

2370
02:15:26,570 --> 02:15:27,000
um,

2371
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,000
president Trump threw it was this kind
of nonsensical hail Mary in these,

2372
02:15:32,410 --> 02:15:34,410
these meetings with Kim Jong Un,
there was no,

2373
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:38,220
never any indication that the North
Koreans were planning on giving up their

2374
02:15:38,221 --> 02:15:39,990
nuclear weapons.
They never said they would.

2375
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:42,930
It's the last thing they would do
it because their goal is survival.

2376
02:15:43,740 --> 02:15:46,350
And so there was this kind of head fake,

2377
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:50,640
which was like a PR stunt to be able
to say, art, we're having these,

2378
02:15:50,641 --> 02:15:51,271
these meetings.

2379
02:15:51,271 --> 02:15:54,690
And of course the North Koreans weren't
ever going to give up their nuclear

2380
02:15:54,691 --> 02:15:58,680
weapons there. They're still not.
So now things are ramping up.

2381
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:02,590
So North Korea in the last couple of
days has started firing missiles again at

2382
02:16:02,650 --> 02:16:07,110
the United States today and see us
military seized a North Korean ship.

2383
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:12,120
So we're going back to
this very dangerous place.

2384
02:16:12,350 --> 02:16:16,710
And, and so I think we really
need to do a much better job.

2385
02:16:16,711 --> 02:16:18,240
We need much more concerned.
North Korea is,

2386
02:16:18,450 --> 02:16:22,320
it's really hard and these guys are
really smart. I mean, I, they are,

2387
02:16:22,321 --> 02:16:26,460
they are very, people say, well,
these guys are poor. They must not be,

2388
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:31,300
I'm into like mad, like we're playing
cards with them. We've got the whole deck.

2389
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:35,370
They don't have any one
card and yet they're there.

2390
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,810
They're in the game.
They're holding us to a,

2391
02:16:37,811 --> 02:16:41,800
to a stalemate and it's really worrying.
And why did you go over there? Like what,

2392
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,360
what,
what were you thinking?

2393
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:48,280
So I thought a lot about it because
I have a background in human rights.

2394
02:16:48,540 --> 02:16:52,000
I was a human rights officer for
the United Nations in Cambodia.

2395
02:16:52,390 --> 02:16:53,950
I'm the child of a refugee.

2396
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:59,100
I have this very strong belief in human
rights and that in supporting people in

2397
02:16:59,231 --> 02:17:00,064
North Korea,

2398
02:17:00,310 --> 02:17:04,600
they have about 120,000
people in the most brutal,

2399
02:17:04,870 --> 02:17:07,510
brutal,
horrific prison camps.

2400
02:17:08,140 --> 02:17:12,520
And so when I was asked to be part
of this six person delegation,

2401
02:17:12,521 --> 02:17:15,880
advising them on the special, on the
establishment of special economic zones,

2402
02:17:15,881 --> 02:17:19,870
one instinct was screw them.
I don't want to be part of this at all.

2403
02:17:20,920 --> 02:17:25,920
But I also felt that if North Korea could
have some kind of integrated economic

2404
02:17:28,300 --> 02:17:32,020
development that would at least
connect them to the world,

2405
02:17:32,021 --> 02:17:35,430
that would create some kind of leverage
and that would, uh, that would help, uh,

2406
02:17:35,470 --> 02:17:39,850
help people. So I decided, uh,
to go, um, and I'm glad that I,

2407
02:17:39,851 --> 02:17:44,030
that I did, but at this is, these are
really hard artichokes people. And,

2408
02:17:44,050 --> 02:17:45,740
and it's very unfortunate that in,

2409
02:17:45,830 --> 02:17:48,400
in president Trump's negotiations
with the North Koreans,

2410
02:17:48,790 --> 02:17:52,420
human rights was never once mentioned.
And I think that that's like,

2411
02:17:52,450 --> 02:17:53,770
as coming back to values,

2412
02:17:53,771 --> 02:17:57,220
like we have to be clear about who
we are and what we stand for and be

2413
02:17:57,221 --> 02:17:58,540
consistent in fighting for him.

2414
02:17:58,690 --> 02:18:03,690
Do you think that Trump didn't bring
that up because he wanted to be able to

2415
02:18:03,851 --> 02:18:07,870
effectively communicate with them
and not put them on their heels?

2416
02:18:08,380 --> 02:18:12,550
Maybe. Um, but I feel like
has, had they done, I mean,

2417
02:18:12,551 --> 02:18:16,810
I think that if he thought that
there was a real chance of progress,

2418
02:18:16,811 --> 02:18:20,350
but the hard thing was he didn't
know much about the North Koreans.

2419
02:18:20,351 --> 02:18:23,140
He has people and we have brilliant
people working in the United States

2420
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:25,300
government and all of those people,

2421
02:18:25,301 --> 02:18:29,140
all of the US intelligence agencies were
telling president Trump that the North

2422
02:18:29,140 --> 02:18:31,900
Koreans have absolutely no intention
of giving up their nuclear weapons.

2423
02:18:32,560 --> 02:18:36,820
And so maybe he did think that he would
charm Kim Jong on, or he would say, hey,

2424
02:18:36,821 --> 02:18:39,850
we're gonna give you economic
development or, or whatever.

2425
02:18:39,851 --> 02:18:44,390
But I think for most people
who were observers of,

2426
02:18:44,430 --> 02:18:48,250
of Korea washed it for, I thought that
was not, uh, so we, we gave away a lot.

2427
02:18:48,250 --> 02:18:53,200
So we didn't mention human rights.
We suspended our military exercises.

2428
02:18:53,201 --> 02:18:55,810
We gave them the legitimacy
of a presidential meeting,

2429
02:18:55,811 --> 02:18:59,740
which they'd been wanting for 30 years,
and we didn't get anything back.

2430
02:18:59,741 --> 02:19:02,080
So it had we gotten something
back then you could say, well,

2431
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:06,880
that was a risk for taking maybe. Mm. No,
I haven't heard it described that way,

2432
02:19:07,010 --> 02:19:08,920
but I'm agreeing with what you're saying.

2433
02:19:08,921 --> 02:19:10,540
What do you think he could
have done differently though?

2434
02:19:11,020 --> 02:19:15,840
I don't think the meeting should
have happened with, no, nope.

2435
02:19:15,870 --> 02:19:18,070
No conditions. There were no
police. So if he had said,

2436
02:19:18,490 --> 02:19:21,040
I'm open to meet with the North Koreans,

2437
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:23,470
which is something the North
Koreans have always wanted,

2438
02:19:23,471 --> 02:19:27,500
we could have met with the North Koreans
anytime immediately for the last 30

2439
02:19:27,501 --> 02:19:31,580
years, but in order to do it they
need to do this, this and this.

2440
02:19:31,790 --> 02:19:35,690
And if they do it we'll meet like that
would have been a legitimate thing.

2441
02:19:35,690 --> 02:19:39,850
But what he said is somebody, the
the the North Korean, I'm inside the,

2442
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:43,340
the South Korean national security
visors peeked into his office and he,

2443
02:19:43,341 --> 02:19:45,380
and he goes, hey, they wanted
me to, and it was like, sure,

2444
02:19:45,740 --> 02:19:47,570
that seems like an
interesting thing to do.

2445
02:19:47,571 --> 02:19:51,140
And I think that with this diplomacy
you kind of have to get something.

2446
02:19:51,141 --> 02:19:55,100
And so we gave away so much upfront
and the North Koreans weren't,

2447
02:19:55,130 --> 02:19:58,730
didn't have it an incentive to do anything
in return was his perspective that it

2448
02:19:58,731 --> 02:20:01,840
would be better to be in communication
and to be friends with this guy.

2449
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:04,310
Who was that? What was that?
What he was thinking like B.

2450
02:20:04,460 --> 02:20:09,460
But we have real interests in the sense
that we have large military forces in

2451
02:20:09,831 --> 02:20:13,370
Seoul. We have a lot at stake.
We have our closest ally,

2452
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:16,220
Japan who has had citizens abducted.

2453
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:20,390
And so I think that was what he
thought is like, let's be friendly.

2454
02:20:20,690 --> 02:20:25,280
And then with the f the force of
personal chemistry, um, everything will,

2455
02:20:25,340 --> 02:20:29,840
will unlock. But I think that
was always extremely unlikely.

2456
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:34,070
What do you think is going to happen
with our country? I think eventually,

2457
02:20:34,071 --> 02:20:37,400
and I've written this,
I think eventually this regime will,

2458
02:20:37,460 --> 02:20:39,290
will collapse under its own weight,

2459
02:20:39,291 --> 02:20:43,580
but it's really held out a long time
because you think of the collapse of the

2460
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:46,700
Soviet Union, they had enough Soviet
Union. It had enough bullets to survive.

2461
02:20:46,701 --> 02:20:47,451
If they had said,
you know,

2462
02:20:47,451 --> 02:20:51,920
we're just going to shoot everybody at
the Berlin Wall and every dissenter,

2463
02:20:51,921 --> 02:20:55,700
they would still be, the North Korea has
essentially murdered millions of people.

2464
02:20:55,701 --> 02:20:59,240
So with famine and execution
and, and, and, and prison camps.

2465
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:02,600
So I think they're going to stay
for a while, but eventually, um,

2466
02:21:02,840 --> 02:21:07,040
there will be leaders in North Korea who
will come to the conclusion that it's

2467
02:21:07,041 --> 02:21:12,041
safer to oppose the Kim family than
to wait for the Kim family to come.

2468
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:17,510
And get you in that true tends to happen
in these kind of totalitarian systems

2469
02:21:17,511 --> 02:21:21,680
where there's so little trust. There's
so little loyalty. Jesus. Yeah.

2470
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:25,370
What is there, what other
conditions like technologically,

2471
02:21:25,371 --> 02:21:27,380
like what was their infrastructure log?

2472
02:21:27,500 --> 02:21:30,770
So the general infrastructure
is absolutely terrible. I mean,

2473
02:21:30,771 --> 02:21:34,730
they have roads in the big cities that
are actually quite nice roads because

2474
02:21:34,731 --> 02:21:39,440
there's no cars. And so, um, but their
infrastructure is, is terrible. I mean,

2475
02:21:39,441 --> 02:21:44,360
all of their, their power supply,
they have brownouts blackouts,

2476
02:21:44,380 --> 02:21:48,710
uh, all the time at their
manufacturing is all being decimated.

2477
02:21:48,711 --> 02:21:49,550
So it's terrible.

2478
02:21:49,820 --> 02:21:54,200
But they have really focused their
energy on building these nuclear weapons

2479
02:21:54,201 --> 02:21:59,030
because they think that these nuclear
weapons give them leverage to do things

2480
02:21:59,031 --> 02:22:02,450
and to extract concessions
and to get, uh, to get a bid.

2481
02:22:02,540 --> 02:22:04,940
It's terrible infrastructure.
So do,

2482
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:09,650
they don't have an internet, right?
But they have something similar,

2483
02:22:09,651 --> 02:22:13,490
but it only allows them access to
a few state run websites. Well,

2484
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:16,060
average person doesn't
have access to the inner.

2485
02:22:16,070 --> 02:22:19,070
So the way it works is
it's all about loyalty.

2486
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:23,930
So you need three or so generations of
loyalty to the Kim family to even set

2487
02:22:23,931 --> 02:22:27,450
foot in Pyongyang, the
capital. So really? Yes.

2488
02:22:27,451 --> 02:22:30,060
So it's not like you can kind
of move around or whatever.

2489
02:22:30,270 --> 02:22:33,000
It's like just to be in the capital,

2490
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:38,180
like you have to have your loyalty
proven and so average person out in the

2491
02:22:38,521 --> 02:22:41,580
country, they don't have
access to much a of anything.

2492
02:22:41,581 --> 02:22:43,890
They have a little bit more
now than they did in the past.

2493
02:22:44,310 --> 02:22:48,540
And then for this relatively small
number of elites who are in largely in

2494
02:22:48,541 --> 02:22:51,210
Pyongyang and in the other
cities which are like there,

2495
02:22:51,211 --> 02:22:54,660
there's a ring of defense around
these cities and just to, to enter,

2496
02:22:54,690 --> 02:22:56,160
you have to have all of these checks.

2497
02:22:56,730 --> 02:23:01,410
Some of them have access to limited
internet. Um, but it's, it's,

2498
02:23:01,500 --> 02:23:05,460
it's tightly controlled and it's not
like you're kind of going on Google and

2499
02:23:05,461 --> 02:23:06,390
look going wherever you want.

2500
02:23:07,290 --> 02:23:10,620
And they probably would get in trouble
if the Gould the wrong thing. Yes.

2501
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:14,620
And trouble. It's not just you
trouble like if you Chubb, if,

2502
02:23:14,830 --> 02:23:19,470
if my brother or my uncle does something
that gets me in trouble with the

2503
02:23:19,471 --> 02:23:22,950
regime,
the whole extended family is out.

2504
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:26,370
And that means you either you go to
prison camps or you're kicked out of

2505
02:23:26,371 --> 02:23:26,910
Pyongyang.

2506
02:23:26,910 --> 02:23:30,690
I mean at this it's all about collective
punish and people are terrified.

2507
02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:33,330
And by that ruthless punishment
structure that they've set up,

2508
02:23:33,331 --> 02:23:35,310
that's how they've kept
control of the country.

2509
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:39,500
And everybody's forced to
rat on each other, right?
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah.

2510
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:40,021
They're,
they're,

2511
02:23:40,021 --> 02:23:45,021
they're actually the compelled to tell
on each other for one thing that you did.

2512
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:50,580
If you don't, then what if you don't,
then you are complicit because they, yes.

2513
02:23:50,580 --> 02:23:54,460
So that's, and that's, they're
these horrible stories.
I've met a lot of these, uh,

2514
02:23:54,480 --> 02:23:58,500
of these people who were in the prison
camps. Like I have a, a friend of mine,

2515
02:23:58,501 --> 02:24:03,240
I mean, she was this 13 year old
girl and her father, um, was a,

2516
02:24:03,241 --> 02:24:07,080
like a low level North Korean official.
And then he was accused of something.

2517
02:24:07,081 --> 02:24:11,010
And so this family that was
privileged all of a sudden was,

2518
02:24:11,160 --> 02:24:16,160
was out and just just these horrible
things in prison and rape and this little,

2519
02:24:17,341 --> 02:24:17,521
I mean,

2520
02:24:17,521 --> 02:24:21,660
now she's in the United States and
incredibly positive and it's amazing how

2521
02:24:21,661 --> 02:24:25,980
resilient she is. But this is like a
real hell and it's a real, it's an issue.

2522
02:24:25,981 --> 02:24:28,890
And I think that for us as Americans,
as humans,

2523
02:24:29,250 --> 02:24:33,570
we're less human when there are people who
are suffering like this. Yeah, I agree.

2524
02:24:33,930 --> 02:24:37,560
Now, um, you were traveling
all over North Korea.

2525
02:24:38,020 --> 02:24:39,660
What were they having
you do while you were,

2526
02:24:39,670 --> 02:24:43,980
so we would do is we would go from one
of these special economic zones to the

2527
02:24:43,981 --> 02:24:46,680
other. And in each one it was kind
of the same story. You'd get there,

2528
02:24:47,130 --> 02:24:50,340
there'd be like a big field.
The farmers had been kicked off,

2529
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:53,760
there was a fence around it.
And then the group of,

2530
02:24:53,850 --> 02:24:57,930
of the local officials would come and
they'd have like a big chart and they have

2531
02:24:57,931 --> 02:24:58,651
a plan.
Like,

2532
02:24:58,651 --> 02:25:00,890
here's where we're going to build
this building and here's [inaudible].

2533
02:25:00,920 --> 02:25:04,530
And I always ask the same question
like what are you going to do here?

2534
02:25:04,980 --> 02:25:07,530
Why do you think you're
going to be competitive?

2535
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:10,410
How do you know what
the market prices are?

2536
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:14,340
How are your workers going to be empowered
so they can change things? I mean, he,

2537
02:25:14,341 --> 02:25:17,760
in the old days, it used to be you just
kind of have these automaton workers.

2538
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:22,260
Now workers are actually
making big decisions and
fixing things and they didn't

2539
02:25:22,261 --> 02:25:23,950
have an answer to any of those questions.

2540
02:25:23,951 --> 02:25:28,780
And that's what happens when you have
these totalitarian top down systems is

2541
02:25:28,781 --> 02:25:32,650
that like if, if you, being creative
is actually really dangerous.

2542
02:25:32,651 --> 02:25:37,550
So if somebody says do x, you
just do X. Wow. Yeah, no, it's,

2543
02:25:37,570 --> 02:25:39,480
it's really incredible and it's,

2544
02:25:39,481 --> 02:25:44,481
it's so sad because I spend a lot of
time in South Korea and this is the most

2545
02:25:44,951 --> 02:25:45,940
dynamic place.

2546
02:25:45,941 --> 02:25:50,440
There's like I often I go to soul just
to see what technology is going to show

2547
02:25:50,441 --> 02:25:52,960
up here a few years in the future.
I mean it's,

2548
02:25:52,961 --> 02:25:57,961
it Seoul is like the future and
then just 35 miles from soul is the

2549
02:25:58,901 --> 02:26:01,900
demilitarized zone. And the
other side it's, it's incredible.

2550
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:07,230
And the real problem would be once they
finally did get free of that community

2551
02:26:08,170 --> 02:26:11,950
or the of that, that mean you
can call him whenever you want.

2552
02:26:11,950 --> 02:26:14,350
The dictator and that him and his family,

2553
02:26:15,130 --> 02:26:18,220
what would they,
what tools would they have?

2554
02:26:18,221 --> 02:26:22,750
Like how prepared would they be to be
autonomy? Well it's really the good thing,

2555
02:26:22,751 --> 02:26:25,270
the benefit that they have if there is,

2556
02:26:25,420 --> 02:26:28,810
so here's my thought of what a
scenario the scenario might look like.

2557
02:26:28,811 --> 02:26:33,730
And I think eventually probably there'll
be some kind of coup attempt against

2558
02:26:33,731 --> 02:26:35,680
the Kim Fam.
Let's just say it succeeds.

2559
02:26:35,830 --> 02:26:38,950
But that would probably result in another
military dictatorship with another

2560
02:26:38,951 --> 02:26:39,251
group.

2561
02:26:39,251 --> 02:26:43,930
Well we don't know cause then I think
immediately I think the Chinese would

2562
02:26:43,931 --> 02:26:46,450
invade. Really? Yeah. Cause
people think of the curb.

2563
02:26:46,451 --> 02:26:48,880
When people think of the Korean War
from the early 1950s they think,

2564
02:26:48,881 --> 02:26:53,360
oh it's the crane where it must've
been the Americans fighting against the

2565
02:26:53,380 --> 02:26:55,330
Koreans. But the Korean
War, the two sides,

2566
02:26:55,331 --> 02:27:00,070
where is America and the South Koreans
fighting against the North Koreans and

2567
02:27:00,071 --> 02:27:04,270
the Chinese, the Chinese did the most
of the, uh, of the, uh, of the fighting.

2568
02:27:05,050 --> 02:27:08,650
And so China and North Korea is the only
country in the world that has a treaty

2569
02:27:08,651 --> 02:27:12,460
alliance now with China,
kind of like we have with Japan and with,

2570
02:27:12,461 --> 02:27:14,320
and with South Korea.
And so China,

2571
02:27:14,620 --> 02:27:18,220
their biggest fear is having
a reunified Korean peninsula,

2572
02:27:18,700 --> 02:27:21,430
al allied to the United States.
So I think if there was a coup,

2573
02:27:21,640 --> 02:27:23,980
the Chinese would immediately
move in militarily.

2574
02:27:24,490 --> 02:27:29,490
Then immediately there would be this
call to have some kind of UN body.

2575
02:27:30,400 --> 02:27:34,360
Um, and there would be a
call for a UN authority.

2576
02:27:35,080 --> 02:27:37,840
And then I think it would be agreed that
the Chinese would stay and they just

2577
02:27:37,841 --> 02:27:41,110
would put on blue helmets,
like as a, as a UN force.

2578
02:27:41,530 --> 02:27:43,720
And then we'd have to
negotiate what happens next.

2579
02:27:43,721 --> 02:27:45,520
And I think what the Chinese
would do would be say, well,

2580
02:27:45,521 --> 02:27:47,770
we'll leave when the Americans leave,
is that,

2581
02:27:47,771 --> 02:27:50,230
I think that would be
what will likely happen.

2582
02:27:50,231 --> 02:27:54,100
But eventually I think we're going
to see a Korean reunification.

2583
02:27:54,101 --> 02:27:58,510
And the good news of these reunified
countries like eastern West Germany is,

2584
02:27:58,511 --> 02:28:02,080
there's a whole system of law
that he's just, he's just,

2585
02:28:02,081 --> 02:28:06,370
North Korea will be swallowed into
South Korea. And then you have law,

2586
02:28:06,371 --> 02:28:10,240
you have an infrastructure and it, it'll
take, you know, one or two generations,

2587
02:28:10,241 --> 02:28:14,290
but I think that will eventually happen
and I'm hoping it can happen without

2588
02:28:14,291 --> 02:28:17,110
nuclear war. Terrible.
A terrible bloodshed.

2589
02:28:17,111 --> 02:28:20,450
But it's that it's going to be
a big challenge. God Damn. Yeah.

2590
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,430
That insurmountable.

2591
02:28:22,550 --> 02:28:23,960
Yeah.
Just hearing you talk about that.

2592
02:28:23,961 --> 02:28:27,150
What about North Korea getting absorbed
by South Korea? I'm like, oh my God,

2593
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:31,670
good luck. Just, yeah, imagine.
Just imagine the whole thing.

2594
02:28:31,910 --> 02:28:35,540
Yeah. Well listen man, it's
been a fascinating conversation.

2595
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:39,110
I really appreciate it everybody. I
really appreciate you coming here and um,

2596
02:28:39,380 --> 02:28:42,710
you've certainly sparked
a lot of interesting ideas
in my head and I'm sure a

2597
02:28:42,711 --> 02:28:46,940
lot of other people's heads as well.
And I would like to see a down the line,

2598
02:28:46,941 --> 02:28:49,850
where are the salt goes? And I hope
it don't get swallowed up by machines.

2599
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,210
We won't, but it's up to us to
fight for what we believe in. Well,

2600
02:28:53,211 --> 02:28:56,480
thank you very much, man.
Really appreciate it. It was
a lot of fine. Bye everybody.

2601
02:29:00,400 --> 02:29:01,233
Okay.

2602
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:06,660
Okay.

2603
02:29:06,660 --> 02:29:07,493
Hmm

2604
02:29:08,550 --> 02:29:08,710
hmm.
