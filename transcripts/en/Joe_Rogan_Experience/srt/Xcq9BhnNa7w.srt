1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,360
Five,
four,

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,700
three,
two,

3
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,563
one.

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,910
Now most people in America consider 
Calabasas to be one of the safest places

5
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,970
as where the Kardashians chose to live.
Not Adam,

6
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:17,810
green trees.
Adam Green tree lives in Australia,

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,300
surrounded by Brown snakes which kill 
you like instantly,

8
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,760
right?
Be instantly pretty quick.

9
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,570
Yeah.
Pretty quick.

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,450
Bunch of spiders you have that'll kill 
you instantly.

11
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,390
Like a ton of hundred.
Right.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,980
You got crocodiles,
you've,

13
00:00:30,981 --> 00:00:35,880
you've bathed where I've saw the video 
of you and campaigns in a fucking puddle

14
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,240
that crocodile swim around in,
but yet the one day he's in Calabasas,

15
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:46,180
which is like the safest place in 
America on true.

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,770
But yeah.
Well tell me what happened.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,933
Well,
so I'll hop down to the hotel first 

18
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:52,974
thing this morning,
the gun trying to find a decent coffee 

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,660
here in America.
And uh,

20
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,440
the police surrounded the whole,
the whole area where the,

21
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:03,270
the coffee shop was and um,
they had guns drawn and everything.

22
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,104
And then I heard later that someone 
actually had a gun out and they might 

23
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:08,550
have even been shots fired.
Yeah.

24
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:09,840
Crazy stuff.
And then I'm like,

25
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,030
okay,

26
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,440
at a coffee bean.
Yeah.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,670
It was at a coffee bean.
Yeah.

28
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:15,730
Find out what happened.
Jamie.

29
00:01:15,731 --> 00:01:16,564
See if there's a story we can.
I said it was probably like some wife 

30
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,200
mad at her husband.
It's seamless series called the police.

31
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,360
He's got a gun like that.
That's happened before.

32
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,463
That happened with Ron White.
I think his girlfriend packed a gun in 

33
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:32,920
his luggage and then that happened with 
Sam Kennison to his girlfriend,

34
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:36,280
packed a loaded gun in his luggage and 
then call the police on him.

35
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,200
That's crazy.
Straight away.

36
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:39,034
I'm like,
it's safer in the mountains with the 

37
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,194
grizzly bears and crap.
He is definitely not safer if you 

38
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:49,234
actually run into a grizzly bear,
but for the most part it's pretty 

39
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:52,024
peaceful,
right?

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,613
Yeah.
Most people are worried about grizzly 

41
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:56,560
bears,
but you could be around him for days and

42
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:59,410
days and most likely nothing's going to 
happen.

43
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,150
Most likely most likely.
But when you,

44
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:04,030
when you were up there,
you.

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,570
Did you run into some walls?
Yeah.

46
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,630
We say,
well,

47
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,590
I seen wolves and then the grizzly 
bears,

48
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,100
the one that sort of really scared me.
Um,

49
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,373
I had a handgun out and I actually had 
the drawer that handgun a few times 

50
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:16,350
while I was up in the mountains.
Yeah,

51
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,184
there was one real big grizzly,
like size 11 boots that I'm coming 

52
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,310
around camp and was hunting all the 
trials.

53
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,160
11 boots.
So it's like a 12 foot by 12 inch pad.

54
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,570
Yup.
Oh my God.

55
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,340
Yeah.
How big do you think it was?

56
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,110
Did you see the actual bar itself?

57
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,590
Yeah.
So once I actually killed the bull,

58
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:37,820
which was about day 10 or 11,
he was sleeping on the caucus,

59
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:38,654
about 60 meters from it.
He was sleeping in your car and then he 

60
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,960
slept on to eat some of it.
He didn't touch it.

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,821
What's,
yeah,

62
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:47,210
it was like the first day,
so.

63
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,223
So I killed that bull in the afternoon a
packed out a decent load of meat that 

64
00:02:51,861 --> 00:02:53,600
night.
Went back in the morning,

65
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:57,550
the next morning to pack out the rest of
the meat and was going in there looking,

66
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,320
thinking they could be a bear on the 
caucus.

67
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,154
And sure enough,
I seem to be a brown hair in the creek 

68
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:04,780
bottom.
So he's just sleeping,

69
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,763
just sleeping there and so I yelled at 
him a prick disease up and had a look 

70
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,900
around and I yelled at him the second 
time and he jumped up and he disappeared

71
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,450
like that,
like scary.

72
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,400
That's how quickie this is.
Thick timber,

73
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,850
lot of deadfall and everything and he 
just disappeared for that.

74
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,193
And it actually got me thinking that if 
you didn't see a bear coming from a 

75
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,280
distance,
handgun,

76
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,750
bedspread,
whatever you've got,

77
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,370
you'd be in serious trouble because he 
just left that scene dead quiet and in a

78
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,204
flash I think can move so fast and those
pads that they have on the bottoms of 

79
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,170
their feet and makes him so sad and 
quiet.

80
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,023
Yeah.
And you would think that a thousand 

81
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:44,510
pound animal wouldn't be able to move 
that forward.

82
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,310
So I'm strapping meat to my pack.
Uh,

83
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,230
obviously there's always a blind spot 
when you're hunched over.

84
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,064
And it took me three times longer to get
the meat on my path because I was just 

85
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:54,724
constantly looking over waiting for that
beer to come back because I haven't 

86
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,390
actually been to the carcass again yet.

87
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,920
I've seen the bear on the way back in.
Pretty scary.

88
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,450
How big was it?
Giant.

89
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,430
Big.
11.

90
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,610
Eleven feet tall.
Scary.

91
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,710
You're alone at deep,
deep,

92
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,553
deep.
I was talking to the fish and game 

93
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,093
warden in the area and the big grizzly 
had gone into another hunters' camp on 

94
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,520
the mountain and just absolutely 
destroyed these camp.

95
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,580
Now I don't know if it was the same bear
or different bear,

96
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:28,414
but on three occasions a big brown bear 
or grizzly come back into my camp and 

97
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,620
each night that he'd come in he'd get a 
little bit closer.

98
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:38,710
So the first 90 circled camp about 50,
60 meters away.

99
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,100
The next 90 circled camp,
about 30 meters away.

100
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,480
And the third time he came in,
he come right into the back of camp like

101
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,760
15 meters away.
Let out these gnarly growl.

102
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,003
And at this point my buddy grant 
Hughes's come in to help me pack out 

103
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:53,320
some neat.

104
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,710
He's in his tent.
I'm in my tent when there's here.

105
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,990
This bear walking in for the snow and 
lets out a growl.

106
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,750
I didn't want to go like grant.
Did you hear that?

107
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,190
Or Grant?
There's a beer in camp.

108
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,950
I didn't want to let the buyer know that
I'm in the tent man.

109
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,300
I just laid there dead,
quiet.

110
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,850
I had the handgun sitting on my chest 
loaded,

111
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,530
ready to go and um,
I laid awake for like three hours,

112
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,364
like you heard the beer walk off and I 
laid awake for three hours and I'd get 

113
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:19,330
up in the morning and I'm do.
I'm like,

114
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:20,470
dude,
did you hear that beer?

115
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,850
And he's like,
did I hear the bear?

116
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,790
Holy Shit Dude.
I didn't want to move on,

117
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:26,080
make a sandy had the same idea as me.
Didn't want to give away.

118
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,910
He's location.
And I'm like,

119
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,860
yeah,
it took me three hours to get to sleep.

120
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:30,694
And he's like,
sleep,

121
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,700
you got fucking sleep.
What the fuck?

122
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:34,931
He was like,
hell,

123
00:05:34,931 --> 00:05:36,860
pissed off man.
He laid awake all night.

124
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:39,770
It's like a tent burrito.
Yeah.

125
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,670
Burrito.
Even staying warm in your sleeping bag,

126
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,504
you know,
like he's got to be able to smell you 

127
00:05:44,231 --> 00:05:45,480
too.
They must know you're your.

128
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,710
Yeah.
What a wondering if they were,

129
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,753
well,
if they smell you and then they smell 

130
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,333
the meat,
what they would be more attracted to 

131
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,120
the.
I don't recognize.

132
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,063
Smell real good,
so hopefully I bet they liked things 

133
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,100
that don't

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,150
smell good.
I probably do.

135
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah.
Mate was hanging up probably a good mall

136
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:02,414
from camp at like a because we were out 
a few different drop points because it 

137
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,310
was such a.
It was four days hike out of meat,

138
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,473
so we had different drop points along 
the way and I never wanted to take any 

139
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:13,070
meat and the campus set for what I'd be 
eating each night,

140
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,950
which a cooked meat might smell pretty 
good to a bear,

141
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:18,650
but I was more concerned about the scent
that,

142
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,523
that we will be carrying on our boots 
from meat site to meet site and then 

143
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,174
walk them back in the camp.
But that Bayer had already been in the 

144
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,423
campaign.
He knew where we were and he was doing 

145
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
his rounds obviously every night.
Have you done an adventure like this 

146
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:31,874
before?
This is an epic adventure because you 

147
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,590
went to Montana,
you,

148
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,930
you know,
you parked.

149
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,060
And then how many miles did you go deep 
into the woods?

150
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,370
I was probably about 12 miles in the 
end.

151
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,830
That's no trials or anything like that.
Twelve miles.

152
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,783
Twelve miles into Montana.
Montana is if you folks who have never 

153
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:52,601
visited Montana is one of the most 
unspoiled parts of America,

154
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,080
like below Alaska,
but not far below.

155
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,643
So you're already super remote,
like we're already a long way from 

156
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:03,200
anywhere and parked at a trail head.
And then.

157
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,093
So obviously I had 11 days solo by 
myself and then my buddy grant come in 

158
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:07,863
and help me pack that bullet out a ended
up being 14 days in the end by the time 

159
00:07:11,781 --> 00:07:13,760
we got the meat out.
Yeah,

160
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,653
it's cool.
I've done done similar adventures 

161
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,443
because a lot of hung back home in 
Australia is all super remote so I'm 90 

162
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:25,130
percent of it's back country really back
home.

163
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,470
But it's a different kind of back 
country.

164
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,910
It's sort of back country bears.
Yeah,

165
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:30,744
it definitely is.
This was saw low minimal gear because 

166
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,930
everything's in your backpack that 
you've got for the hunt.

167
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,063
Um,
so it's super light and you're cutting 

168
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:40,280
down on a lot of essentials that you 
need,

169
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,240
you know,
just,

170
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,460
just to get back in there when you do 
this.

171
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:46,970
I've been obsessed with a lightweight 
backpacking lately.

172
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,530
I've been paying attention to,
um,

173
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,190
these guys that do the Appalachian 
trail.

174
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,173
Yep.
Did they hike from Georgia all the way 

175
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:58,250
up to Maine?
It takes five months.

176
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,960
That's insane.
They're insane.

177
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,823
But it's one of those things that 
there's a real problem with the human 

178
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:03,764
brain.
It's like we were talking about our pal 

179
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,490
campaigns and this a 200 mile run he 
just did.

180
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,400
And when,
when there's a challenge in front of you

181
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,710
and you find out that someone has done 
it before you start going,

182
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,720
man,
maybe I could do 200 miles.

183
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,170
You feel like there's something fucked 
up about people's brains where when they

184
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,033
find that someone's doing something,
like I have zero desire to take five 

185
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:25,400
months out of my life and walk from 
Georgia to Maine.

186
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,350
Yeah.
But I bet you once you got it done,

187
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,230
that's the difference.
But part of my brain was like,

188
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,260
I started thinking about it and then my 
shut up,

189
00:08:33,261 --> 00:08:34,094
stupid.
You're not fucking hiking to main stop 

190
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:37,514
it,
but part of me was like listening to 

191
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:41,090
this guy.
It was on,

192
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,260
uh,
the rich outdoors.

193
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:44,540
You've done research projects for his 
podcast.

194
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,890
One of his buddies is a,
a,

195
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,733
a trail guy and they were talking about 
like lightweight gear and how they 

196
00:08:50,301 --> 00:08:51,134
can't,
they pack the different stream where a 

197
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:54,940
guy uses for hunting and what someone 
uses for a,

198
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,610
just these long,

199
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,151
long,
long,

200
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:01,200
long hikes where they essentially were 
the same clothes for five months.

201
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,010
That's the hygienic.
Yeah.

202
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,020
It doesn't seem.
Well,

203
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,860
I mean I guess maybe get a chance 
occasionally to wash them somewhere,

204
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:08,694
but they,
everything is the lightest possible 

205
00:09:11,491 --> 00:09:15,240
stuff that you could have.
And when you do this,

206
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,800
let's say if you're going to go out 
there and you're,

207
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,020
you know,
you're planning on how many days?

208
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,663
15.
I wanted to do at least half the month 

209
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:25,740
in Montana and I wanted to do the other 
half of the month in Idaho.

210
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,310
So 15 days and a little bit of the 
trips.

211
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:33,490
Got To be unprepared in that sense when 
you're doing 15 days it,

212
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,810
that sort of hunt because the country's 
like straight up and down.

213
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,910
There's no other way to do it.
There's no,

214
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,013
I'm going to drive to the ridge line or 
I'm going to walk a decent trail that I 

215
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,820
reach line or take an atv and it's just 
all on foot,

216
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,550
straight up and down country.
So,

217
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,820
and,
and to have a little bit of roughness to

218
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:52,110
a trip like that,
you know,

219
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:52,944
we yar roughing it.
That's a bit of the appeal as well and 

220
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,720
the experience in doing it.
So,

221
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,560
um,
I was just talking with the guys at hoyt

222
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:02,394
and they'll ask him,
what's the essentials that you had in 

223
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,160
your pack that you wouldn't go without?

224
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,043
And I'm like,
well how about I tell you about the 

225
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,920
stuff that I wish I had in my pack and 
that I didn't go out.

226
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,940
Like what stuff do you wish I didn't.
I didn't take any rain gear and I didn't

227
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,774
take any rain gear and,
and I didn't check the weather before I 

228
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:21,390
went in deliberately because I didn't 
want any deterrent on the trip.

229
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:21,761
Like,
oh,

230
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:23,310
it's going to snow or it's going to high
a little.

231
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,520
There's going to be gale force winds.
I shouldn't go in today or I should pack

232
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,970
this extra.
I just wanted to ignore all that.

233
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:30,923
Just go in,
just live in the wilderness basically 

234
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,850
with the minimal.
And um,

235
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:38,760
I got all that,
whether I've got hail three times.

236
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,330
I got gale force winds,
I got rain followed by snow,

237
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:43,164
so soaking wet then freezing cold and 
you just had to stay active the whole 

238
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:50,730
time.
Like I'd literally get to a mountain and

239
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,743
I'd sit down for two minutes and you'd 
go from sweating to freezing cold 

240
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:59,430
because you're wet and actually hiked 
the mountain just to get warm.

241
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,650
Were you wearing wool?
Nah,

242
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,000
whole synthetics.

243
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,423
So since the synthetics in some,
in some cases it's harder to maintain 

244
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,450
your body temperature when you sweat.
That's probably.

245
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,100
And perks to both.
Yeah.

246
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,383
So like I've got a synthetic sleeping 
bag as well at why is it a little bit 

247
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:18,554
more,
but I could jump in that sleeping bag 

248
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,670
wet at night and wake up in the morning 
and dry.

249
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,740
That's a little bit of the difference 
and it will dry out the next day and uh,

250
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,633
it doesn't get,
never carries any weight your 

251
00:11:30,351 --> 00:11:33,080
synthetics.
So I just had like a small,

252
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:33,914
a Hoodie,
a little hoodie and I had some 

253
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,870
undergarments and that was about it for 
the whole trip.

254
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,500
But as far as like sweating and your 
clothes and getting your stuff wet,

255
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,960
wool maintains body temperature better.
It does,

256
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,450
yeah.

257
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,171
Yeah,
it does.

258
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:50,070
Next the skin is really good.
So like under armour has got some really

259
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:53,370
good next to skin clothing and I'll get 
wedding that next.

260
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:55,450
The skin clothing and stay warm because 
it is,

261
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,583
it's similar to a wet suit wear suits 
designed to have some liquid in it and 

262
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:02,860
the liquid gets warm and keeps your body
warm.

263
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,023
That next to skin clothings the same 
where it's sitting right on your skin 

264
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:09,700
and it's going to stay warm like that.
So it was it like a spandex almost.

265
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:10,840
Yeah,
it is.

266
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Yeah.
It looks a bit Pansy when you grow up in

267
00:12:16,141 --> 00:12:17,270
Rhode and tights.
So.

268
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:18,580
So that was a fuck up,
right?

269
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:19,960
You should have probably brought some 
rain gear.

270
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,853
Well,
I don't want to call it a fuck up 

271
00:12:22,061 --> 00:12:24,640
because I delivered it.
Deliberately done it.

272
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,480
Um,
to kate white down so much wheat.

273
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,210
This is like a lightweight rain Poncho.
Um,

274
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,130
I don't want to know how it was really 
heavy and I couldn't carry.

275
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:39,220
It seems like it's not that day,
but where do you stop?

276
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:41,860
Where do you stop doing that?
Is the big question,

277
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:42,311
right?
Yeah,

278
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:43,091
it's,
it's weird.

279
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:43,924
You stop.
And I was already walking in going this 

280
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:47,440
is killer.
Like this is hurting.

281
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,570
Um,
how heavy is your pack?

282
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:52,420
Yeah.
I don't get into that sort of stuff.

283
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:53,350
You don't wear it?
Nope.

284
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,520
I don't why?
I don't.

285
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,970
Yeah,
it just go silent.

286
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,893
Sirens.
A food.

287
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,240
I'll just go.
There's a dinner,

288
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:01,600
there's,
there's some lunchtime snacks now.

289
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,980
Energy.
And that's it.

290
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,740
If you go in for 15 days,
how many days were the food?

291
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:06,574
Do you care?
I only took in 10 because I was killing 

292
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:12,100
a bull roast.
Yeah,

293
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,800
exactly.
And um,

294
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,010
I didn't run out because I shot a grouse
and I cooked the grass up.

295
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,993
Then I killed my bowl and I was eating 
meat and I was even cooking meat and 

296
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,950
then packing it the next day to eat 
cold,

297
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:27,460
which obviously helped.
And it's A.

298
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,680
Have you heard this story about me and 
cam going on the,

299
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:33,860
the Arnhem land tripping over territory 
back in any food people haven't heard.

300
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,323
Well,
you.

301
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,413
This is the most ridiculous thing ever 
because you guys had to filter buffalo 

302
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:44,950
piss water because buffalo is still.
Tastes like piss the color out of it.

303
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,560
It had the same taste that the science 
smell.

304
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,700
And my question is if the water's 
filtered,

305
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,430
shouldn't have smelled lever.
Yes,

306
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,400
it should.
Shouldn't it?

307
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,081
Yeah.
You're drinking.

308
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:57,260
Piss it,
drink a paste,

309
00:13:57,261 --> 00:13:59,130
paste for security for sure.
You guys drank.

310
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,770
But veterans got hell or some energy in 
it though because of Buffalo.

311
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,340
Buffalo's Dick if even better,
but my energy.

312
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,140
I don't know why you were thinking.

313
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,520
Get pissed.
Tried to jam the door.

314
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:16,190
That first at least to told him to drink
the water first.

315
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,180
Yeah.
He can test that.

316
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,023
He saved on.
Will they have those crazy filtration 

317
00:14:19,781 --> 00:14:22,420
systems where you like gravity filters?
Is that what you used?

318
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,283
Yeah,
so I took one of those in the mountains 

319
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,084
on this trip as well.
I never pulled it out and never used it 

320
00:14:26,921 --> 00:14:27,754
once because I was always drinking water
from the highest source directly where 

321
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:33,730
it's coming out of the mountain.
And if you do that you're okay.

322
00:14:33,731 --> 00:14:34,750
You don't have to worry about.
Nah,

323
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,080
I don't want to say yes because they 
were go and do it and get sick.

324
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,250
Yeah,
sue my ass.

325
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:40,084
But I've never.
I've always had it nine stomach and I 

326
00:14:42,941 --> 00:14:43,774
think it's from just doing all that sort
of stuff as a kid you sort of grow with 

327
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:48,454
that and I think your body's,
your body creates its own defense 

328
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:53,440
against,
against things like that.

329
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm a massive believer in that actually 
sign with being dirty.

330
00:14:57,001 --> 00:15:00,350
And I like,
like personal hygiene is obviously a big

331
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,560
thing.
But um,

332
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,133
you know,
Alita,

333
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,910
I'll lead a chocolate bar with elk blood
all over my hands after skin and,

334
00:15:06,911 --> 00:15:07,744
or,
or deboning and elk and I think that's 

335
00:15:09,591 --> 00:15:11,870
perfectly natural and normal in that 
sense.

336
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,510
Um,
I've never been sick.

337
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:17,570
I've drunk and some silly looking water 
like that.

338
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,553
But I just think if you're at the top of
the mountain where the water's first 

339
00:15:20,751 --> 00:15:23,150
coming out of the hill,
out of the rocks,

340
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:26,150
then you're safe because there's nothing
along the line.

341
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,430
They're like a,
an old animal carcass.

342
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,323
Frigging wolf,
shit sitting in the water or something 

343
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:34,220
like that to make you sick.
It's coming right out of the ground.

344
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,340
It's coming right out the ground.
Literally catch it as a streams.

345
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,620
That makes sense.

346
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,440
That's like a.
well,

347
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,720
and that's handy as well because I'm 
cancer at the top.

348
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,460
So I want to find the highest water 
source.

349
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:45,410
I don't have to drop down so far each 
day.

350
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,290
Collect water.
There's always a good field.

351
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,170
And actually when you come across 
freshwater like that.

352
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,670
So how many liters is your pack?
How heavy is your pack?

353
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:55,880
It's a 2100.
I was a small pack.

354
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:56,361
Yeah.
Yeah.

355
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:58,400
It's not a big.
That's very small.

356
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,680
It's,
it's the badlands.

357
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,840
That's crazy.
Use a 2100 liter pack for a 15 day hunt.

358
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,520
Yep.
That's how light I'm going in.

359
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,700
I have a couple of things that are 
strapped to that pack,

360
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,863
which would make it bigger than that,
but generally everything fits inside 

361
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:19,361
that package or what's in the pack.
Jetboil yeah.

362
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,323
That's.
Yep.

363
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,350
So I've got similar to MSI reactor.
They really good.

364
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,210
You can actually use it in the cold.

365
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,750
It was freezing in my tent,
like the whole tent froze over that.

366
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,613
Um,
I actually turned it on in the tent to 

367
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,170
warm the tent when I was getting changed
or unchanged at night.

368
00:16:34,171 --> 00:16:34,851
A little bit.
Pansy.

369
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:37,640
But hey it got to put a smile on my 
face.

370
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,250
Boils water super quick,
you know.

371
00:16:40,251 --> 00:16:41,084
So if the weather is miserable and you 
just want to get it done at boils water 

372
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,250
super quick for you.
Run a tanker.

373
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,610
Propane small.
Yeah,

374
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:51,380
just a real little backpack one.
And then because I went in there when it

375
00:16:51,381 --> 00:16:53,670
was stinking hot,
like it was always cooking,

376
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,460
like it was the hardest.
Wherever you'd have,

377
00:16:55,461 --> 00:16:57,260
you wouldn't even imagine having a fire 
in that,

378
00:16:57,261 --> 00:17:00,140
whether from risk of a wildfire,
you know,

379
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,740
starting the bushfire too,
you know,

380
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,760
hightailed,
it rained and snowed,

381
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:07,040
everything got wet.
It was safe at that point.

382
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,873
They have a fire and then a lot of the 
cooking that I end up doing was just 

383
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,200
over the fire.
I'll save my gas each night,

384
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,463
um,
because I would have ran out of gas 

385
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:15,404
before those 15 days are up if I was 
using just that one canister the whole 

386
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:20,480
time and that you'd end up having to 
pack out,

387
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,430
go into town by the gas and then pack 
all the way back and you'd end up losing

388
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:26,264
two days because it was a,
it was a full day walking out with no 

389
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,200
weight at all.
Like,

390
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,790
just speed,
walking down the mountain,

391
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,320
trying to get it out of.
There was a full day.

392
00:17:33,321 --> 00:17:34,570
So,
um,

393
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,500
yeah,
I've got my reactor,

394
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,720
I've got my water filter.
But like I said,

395
00:17:38,721 --> 00:17:41,590
I never used it.
I've got a small one person 10,

396
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,943
a mattress at really good sleeping bag.
It's actually overrated for the 

397
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:47,054
conditions,
but I always think you're better off 

398
00:17:47,841 --> 00:17:48,650
going overrated.

399
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,320
You get some bad weather log I had and 
you've got an underride sleeping bag and

400
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,180
you're not getting sleep.
You're going to Ms.

401
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,170
Hunt now.
It's for sure.

402
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,950
Um,
then I've just got a couple of knives.

403
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,610
I've got a full safety kit,
bandages.

404
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,950
Um,
I've actually been carrying.

405
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,023
I didn't use them on this trip.
Even a little like a water filtration 

406
00:18:09,601 --> 00:18:11,250
pill,
which is always handy.

407
00:18:11,251 --> 00:18:12,084
So you didn't have to carry,
you feel to kid everyday if you come 

408
00:18:13,741 --> 00:18:15,510
across some decent water that was down 
low,

409
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,830
you could just put the pill in.
But um,

410
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:19,103
we're.
A lot of people go wrong with these 

411
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,460
filtrate.
The water filtration and the pills is,

412
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,693
you still require both of you come 
across dirty water because the pills 

413
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,620
only going to kill bacteria within 
reasonably clear water.

414
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:35,160
It's not going to kill the solids.
So if you're scooping up dirty water,

415
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,083
put an appeal in and then drinking 
anything that's within the solids of 

416
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:40,800
that water,
you're still going to get sick from.

417
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,053
So in a sense you're still,
you still need the two of them if you 

418
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,500
want a hunt like that.
But the water filtrations or some,

419
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:51,320
because it's 99 point nine,
nine,

420
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:54,120
nine percent of all bacteria.
It's going to filter out of your water.

421
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,670
And the pills are world markets or 
chlorine or something?

422
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:58,170
Yeah,
they like a chlorine pill here.

423
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:59,760
There's a few different ones yet on the 
market.

424
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,930
So you take those essentials.
You essentially were in the same clothes

425
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,550
everyday.
Same clothes every day.

426
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,343
I take few changes,
the socks and underwear and I'm saying 

427
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,390
clothes,
clothes every day.

428
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:13,224
And then if I did get a hot hot day,
this was the plan that never ever 

429
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:16,794
happened.
But if I did get a hot day and I came 

430
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:19,194
past a stream,
I was actually going to wash some 

431
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:21,654
clothes in like a dry bag,
just a bit of water and the clothes and 

432
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,164
then hang them up and I just never got 
that break in the weather and I wanted 

433
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,514
to hunt every day and every minute of 
light so I'd just get up in the morning 

434
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:34,620
and put wet clothes on if I didn't draw 
them on the fire that night.

435
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,880
So it sounds like most of the weight in 
your pack is food generally?

436
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,470
Yep.
Just 10 days of food.

437
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,380
And how many pounds of food you'd taken 
the day around?

438
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:44,820
Two?
Yeah,

439
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,780
maybe a bit less.
Yeah,

440
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,913
it might've been a bit less.
I smashed the chocolate bars when I'm 

441
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,970
out there.
Dude.

442
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,860
Why talk about smashed chocolate and 
nine.

443
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,130
But when I'm in the mountains I really 
smashed chocolate.

444
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,910
Um,
I just liked that bit of a fix and a bit

445
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:01,370
of a,
it's a bit of a pick up,

446
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,000
you know,
and keep you going.

447
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,250
And it's no different than a fire,
you know,

448
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,040
like if you get a fire going at night,
it's at like bit of a boost,

449
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,903
like a spirit spirit boost.
And it's the same as a chocolate bar 

450
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,730
just to sit down and go away on a 
chocolate bar.

451
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:15,564
Just,
yeah,

452
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,250
life's is good,
keep going.

453
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,920
Doesn't matter.
But like,

454
00:20:18,921 --> 00:20:20,640
um,
but as far as like energy,

455
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,540
don't you crash when you have one of 
those things go up high,

456
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,130
get a sugar crash.
I don't really crash.

457
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:26,791
No.
It's funny,

458
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,310
I hear it with a lot of people,
but yeah,

459
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,870
I never crashed.
Brendan Burns.

460
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:33,270
We're seeing the same thing.
He brings like snickers bars,

461
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,430
snickers bars,
really good.

462
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,980
Milky ways.
They like a Mozbar back in Australia,

463
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,670
like milky ways here.
Anything sugary?

464
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,333
Well also I would imagine the amount of 
calories you're burning when you're 

465
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:50,170
walking mountains like that with a pack 
on heavy pack.

466
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,210
It's huge.
I had um,

467
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,960
but I had the desire to actually go and 
do this trip and do a bit of weight loss

468
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:56,794
at the same time.
I think if I wasn't going to do weight 

469
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:02,110
loss at the same time,
then I'll probably pack some more food,

470
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,383
some more goodies,
but you did it on purpose to lose some 

471
00:21:05,621 --> 00:21:08,200
weight and I did,
I lost weight.

472
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,350
I lost a lot of white doing it,
but yeah,

473
00:21:11,351 --> 00:21:13,240
def definitely done on purpose.
There'd be some,

474
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:17,620
some days where I'd just have a snack in
the morning for breakfast,

475
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,463
like an energy bar and actual energy bar
in the morning and I'd go all the way 

476
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:22,534
through and I wouldn't,
I wouldn't hide back in the camp til 

477
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:24,784
1130 at night because I was trying to 
stay out where I thought the balls were 

478
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,030
and I'd have a quick dinner in camp that
night and that was it.

479
00:21:31,031 --> 00:21:32,950
And I wouldn't even feel hungry 
throughout the day.

480
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,470
Um,
yeah.

481
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,190
I think just from being so active and 
obviously good water intake whenever you

482
00:21:39,191 --> 00:21:41,110
can,
I just,

483
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,460
there was never a point where I'm like,
oh,

484
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,110
ahead,
I'm starving the day,

485
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:46,240
you know,
I'm not going any further until eight or

486
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:47,320
anything like that.
It was just,

487
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,161
it was all go,
go,

488
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:48,430
go.

489
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,270
And Yeah.
Now when you take a plan like this,

490
00:21:52,271 --> 00:21:55,900
when you decided to go on a deep,
deep mountain on like this,

491
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,483
what do you,
uh,

492
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,990
how do you pick where you're going?
Are you a,

493
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:04,310
you studying google earth and you 
getting tips from people studying Google

494
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,220
Earth's the big one,
you know,

495
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,050
and um,
I would suggest for anyone that wants to

496
00:22:08,051 --> 00:22:10,090
do a backpack hunt,
you know,

497
00:22:10,091 --> 00:22:14,710
like a do it yourself hunt is study 
google earth and I'll do a radius.

498
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:18,220
I would look for a radius with the least
amount of roads,

499
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:21,730
any sort of infrastructure around it,
like the most wilderness looking area,

500
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,433
even away from trial heads.
I hate been near a trial head or where 

501
00:22:25,661 --> 00:22:29,260
there's a trial that people are going to
be walking in on or anything like that.

502
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:30,094
Like I mean real back country.
You've got a Bush bash it to get in 

503
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:34,720
there just fine,
you know,

504
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,583
do your research,
find that area with the least amount of 

505
00:22:38,081 --> 00:22:41,560
activity and then put a.in
the middle or roughly in the middle.

506
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,393
And that's where you should set up camp 
and like getting that live with the 

507
00:22:44,441 --> 00:22:46,120
balls or whatever,
animals you're hunting,

508
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:48,560
get in there and live with them.
And um,

509
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,530
I think not being afraid to fail on a 
hunt,

510
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,463
the big one because you know,
a lot of people or they might not even 

511
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,590
be any bulls there.
But yeah,

512
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,453
who cares.
It's going to be an awesome experience 

513
00:22:58,451 --> 00:22:59,284
anyway.
And it's a place that you can tick off 

514
00:23:00,461 --> 00:23:02,050
the list.
I'm not going back there.

515
00:23:02,051 --> 00:23:03,700
There was nothing there.
And then next year,

516
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,290
try the next bottle.
The next week,

517
00:23:05,291 --> 00:23:07,780
try another spot.
Um,

518
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,940
I had hunted around that area previously
and so I knew there was elk in the area.

519
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,213
Um,
I just had never been that far back in 

520
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:18,070
before.
And I tell you,

521
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:18,904
to tell you the truth,
it is nearly completely filed on me 

522
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:23,830
because I went days and days without 
hearing or seeing or an elk.

523
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,330
But the sign was there to say that we're
in,

524
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,273
in there.
It's just that the grizzlies and the 

525
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,463
wolves were hunting that area so hard 
that it shut the fuck up and pushed a 

526
00:23:32,561 --> 00:23:35,270
lot of them out of the area.
Yeah.

527
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,450
And then I was nearly new food source.

528
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,290
So.
Wow.

529
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,040
So when you get in there and you don't 
see anything for a couple of days,

530
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,761
like what,
what,

531
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:46,070
what is

532
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,330
the mindset like?
What do you mean?

533
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:52,370
He hates a day out and there's always 
that like you second guess yourself.

534
00:23:52,421 --> 00:23:54,430
This was a stupid move you shouldn't 
have came in here.

535
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,650
You need to change spots,
but then it's like,

536
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,470
but at the same time your experience in 
this for a reason,

537
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,720
and this is how hunting should be.
Hunting should be hard.

538
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,823
You should hunting never be unless 
you've done your research going into a 

539
00:24:06,221 --> 00:24:08,860
place and there's just like game walking
past year everywhere.

540
00:24:08,861 --> 00:24:10,390
There should always be,
because that's the hunt,

541
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:12,910
right?
Finding it or going through the hardship

542
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,950
to find it,
tracking it,

543
00:24:14,951 --> 00:24:18,250
find and find them where's the better 
spot within that area.

544
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,820
So at the same time that when winds 
like,

545
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,990
you know,
you've made a bad decision,

546
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,490
this is a crap spot,
the be,

547
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,110
there's the whole experience of like,
no,

548
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,800
this is how hunting should be.
It should be difficult.

549
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,530
You should have to work your ass off to 
try and find the animal.

550
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,840
And when you actually do find that 
animal,

551
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:38,720
how much better is it because you know,
it's just like if,

552
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:43,660
if you hunted for 11 months and you 
didn't say a bull,

553
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,790
you found a boy,
you had a shot in your midst,

554
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,460
but then the next one you get,
how good's that next one that you get,

555
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,743
you know,
if that was the case and it was very 

556
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:53,110
similar on this trip where I put in all 
that effort,

557
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,260
didn't see an animal.
One opportunity,

558
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,770
a ball comes in.
I ended up calling that bull from like a

559
00:24:59,770 --> 00:25:00,603
mile away.
You could just hear him coming up this 

560
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:04,810
canyon.
And I did that shot and dude,

561
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:08,260
I teared up.
I was crying because I knew how much had

562
00:25:08,261 --> 00:25:09,520
gone into it.
You know?

563
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,470
And it's not just the effort,
but you know,

564
00:25:11,471 --> 00:25:14,450
like obviously I'm,
I'm away from my wife Kim and the kids.

565
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,333
I'm away from the kids for a month now.
There's all that sacrifice is all the 

566
00:25:19,031 --> 00:25:20,470
hard shit.
There's all the effort.

567
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,663
There's walking in,
there's putting up with that absolutely 

568
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,154
atrocious wherever.
And then finally one opportunity comes 

569
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:29,530
up and you kill that animal as well as 
kill an animal.

570
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,810
That's a hard thing to do,
man.

571
00:25:31,811 --> 00:25:32,644
I balled up.
I was crying like I think I cried a 

572
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,700
dozen times.
Every time I thought about it when I was

573
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,790
standing over the ball I was crying and 
I'm like,

574
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,120
that's why it's got to be that hard so 
you can appreciate their animal.

575
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,690
So you realize what has to go into the 
hunt to actually get something killed.

576
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,910
Should I think everyone should be like 
that.

577
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:49,790
I hope they're not.

578
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,550
Well there's,
there's a lot of elk in Montana,

579
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,120
but Montana is so huge.
Yeah.

580
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,290
Massive,
massive place.

581
00:25:57,291 --> 00:25:59,780
And the amount of wilderness that you 
were encountering,

582
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,190
if you have,
you know,

583
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:02,024
herds of elk all over the place,
it's super likely that you could like 

584
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,990
wind up in a spot with nothing around 
you for miles and miles around.

585
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,220
Yep,
exactly.

586
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,920
So the,
the.

587
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:12,973
I think the heartbeat with that country 
that I've been going into is the wolf 

588
00:26:16,581 --> 00:26:17,414
populations getting so big.
I know you love wolves is pitches of 

589
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,310
frigging wolves in this joint 
everywhere.

590
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,173
But I do love them all.
I want to share to know where they're 

591
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,360
scary.
Definitely scary.

592
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,530
What's weird is what we were talking 
about before the podcast started.

593
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:36,380
You were talking about Australia and 
what you call the greenies,

594
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,573
which are the green people that want to.
They don't want animals to die and they 

595
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:43,680
want this population to explode,
but there's not a balance.

596
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,873
And that was the idea behind 
reintroducing wolves was to create a 

597
00:26:49,201 --> 00:26:50,034
balance because there was a lot of 
animals that were living in the 

598
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:57,990
yellowstone greater yellowstone area.
And so they introduced these wolves.

599
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,333
But the problem was they had an 
agreement when they introduced these 

600
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:05,010
wolves that when they reached a 
sustainable population,

601
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:07,920
they reached a certain numbers of 
several thousand wolves,

602
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,963
then they would open up a hunting season
on them to try to control the 

603
00:27:10,801 --> 00:27:14,130
population,
but as soon as they reached that number,

604
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,460
the people that were involved in the 
relocation of the rules and the wildlife

605
00:27:20,251 --> 00:27:21,084
protection people and all the people 
that are like really animal rights 

606
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:24,774
advocates,
they,

607
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,790
they backed out of it and they said,
no,

608
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:29,490
we don't want any hunting on any of 
these worlds ever.

609
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:33,360
And so there's this big battle and a lot
of states have opened up hunting seasons

610
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,770
on wolves,
Montana included.

611
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,900
But it's still,
there's a battle,

612
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,570
there's a battle to try to control the 
wolf populations.

613
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,980
It's funny,
like I went.

614
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,040
So I went into yellowstone last year 
after my hunt just,

615
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:47,730
you know,
thought I had all my photography gay and

616
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:50,190
um,
I didn't say a single elk,

617
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,470
but you got to go near where the people 
are.

618
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,420
I saw a ton of them.
Isn't that crazy?

619
00:27:54,421 --> 00:27:58,700
I was there with my kids.
We got selfies with fucking elk.

620
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,000
No,
it's like the whole time I was like,

621
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,050
fucking wolves.
They've wrecked this joint.

622
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:06,240
Didn't say anything.
Well,

623
00:28:06,241 --> 00:28:07,074
the elk have decided that people are 
super safe because no one has hunted in 

624
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:12,690
yellowstone for 100 and whatever the 
hell years.

625
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,823
So when you go to the visitor area,
when you first pull into yellowstone 

626
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,670
lake,
yellowstone has like this,

627
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:19,500
uh,
and this is on the Montana side.

628
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,633
Yellowstone has this area where there's 
like a gas station and there's like a 

629
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:25,710
store and it's fucking elk everywhere.

630
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,560
Like I'll show you my friend.
I got selfies,

631
00:28:28,561 --> 00:28:30,840
I got elk selfies.
But they're,

632
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:31,770
uh,
they,

633
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:35,650
they're not even remotely nervous about 
people that aren't k.

634
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,060
yeah,
you don't,

635
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,050
you aren't doing days.
Um,

636
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,700
access data and having Texas,
the Cheeto d,

637
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,790
your stupid head.
That's how I saying,

638
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,720
but in the background that just living 
in the hotels,

639
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:52,554
but it looks hilarious.
They're just chilling back there and 

640
00:28:54,701 --> 00:28:57,750
there was a gang of a man that's all.
They were all over the place.

641
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,113
There were a.
it's,

642
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,850
it's really weird because it's like,
right when you pull into the area,

643
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:07,010
all you see is like just loads of 
arrowhead.

644
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,740
Yeah,
so that,

645
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,760
that the data that we have nightgown 
live near the station.

646
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:12,594
So the station in Australia,
obviously it's just like a ranch and I 

647
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,560
like a big farm because of the dingoes 
just smashed,

648
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:21,720
it smashed the population so that those 
title did.

649
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,613
I got back on near the homesteads 
because the dean goes less likely to 

650
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:28,380
come around the home.
It's really crazy and then you move.

651
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,320
If you're hunting you'd be like,
screw this,

652
00:29:31,321 --> 00:29:34,020
I'm gone back into the back country now.
There's going to be hateful or deer back

653
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:37,680
there compared to ran in the house and 
there'll be no deer out there at all.

654
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,850
What?
They would be very limited,

655
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:39,684
Debbie.
There'll be the stags that are moving 

656
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:42,100
through the area and that's about

657
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:42,933
it.
The nucleus of the cheadle deer live 

658
00:29:44,531 --> 00:29:47,140
around the homestead where it's safe.
They're not dumb.

659
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,723
That's interesting.

660
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,230
Same thing with deer in around here.
You'll find them in suburban areas.

661
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,123
Yeah,
but he also find coyotes and suburban 

662
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,760
areas,
but less mountain lions,

663
00:29:57,761 --> 00:30:01,300
mountain lions try to avoid human 
populations more and that's what usually

664
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:01,640
gets

665
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,310
deer out here.
All the news back home has been mountain

666
00:30:04,311 --> 00:30:06,920
lions in behind your house.
Probably.

667
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,160
There's quite a few.
Yeah.

668
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,063
Yeah.
Cool

669
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:09,983
pictures of them.
There's Bobcat's I've seen bobcats out 

670
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,150
near me,
but there's,

671
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:15,300
there's a mountain lions in California 
for sure.

672
00:30:15,301 --> 00:30:16,134
There's quite a few of them.
California is an interesting place 

673
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,640
because,
um,

674
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,030
you know,
California,

675
00:30:21,031 --> 00:30:23,370
they don't want to control the 
predators.

676
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:27,030
They want the predators to control the 
game population.

677
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:28,410
And because of that,
there's not that many

678
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,490
deer here.
Yeah,

679
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,730
yeah.
I understand that it's not.

680
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:34,450
And I can say the method behind it,
you know it.

681
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,593
Well,
my issue is that humans in a sense of 

682
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,680
the ultimate Predator,
right,

683
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,930
and that everything should be not 
controlled.

684
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:44,790
But um,
you know,

685
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,180
what's the good way of saying this?
Is that that Bain,

686
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,420
the Apex Predator that we are,
we are,

687
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,633
you know,
we obviously got a part in that whole 

688
00:30:55,201 --> 00:30:57,810
food chain as well when it comes to 
things like that.

689
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,620
Some people don't agree with that,
they understand that and I can say,

690
00:31:01,621 --> 00:31:02,454
you know,
we'll talk before about the wolves been 

691
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,960
introduced to control the population and
the numbers,

692
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,430
but there's obviously got to be a point 
where the wolves are controlled as well.

693
00:31:11,431 --> 00:31:12,690
Right?
So who does that?

694
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,840
Well,
that was all well

695
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,683
done early,
early on in North America because of 

696
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:18,564
cattle ranchers.
So what they would do is they would 

697
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:20,634
shoot wild horses.
They had a huge wild horse problem and 

698
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:26,310
the wild horse problem is actually a,
it's reemerging.

699
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:29,730
There's quite a few wild horses in North
America and they're trying to figure out

700
00:31:29,731 --> 00:31:32,010
what to do with them.
And it's really controversial.

701
00:31:32,011 --> 00:31:33,360
It's very,
it's kind of interesting.

702
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,543
Um,
but what they would do back then was 

703
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:38,790
they would shoot these wild horses and 
then they would shoot a wolf.

704
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,653
They would shoot like one of the Alphas 
and they would take the wolf and rub it 

705
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,480
and take it sank glands and rub it all 
over the,

706
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:48,150
a dead horse and then fill the horse up 
with strychnine.

707
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,120
So the other wolves would come around.
They would smell.

708
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:54,060
They're missing Alpha friend.
And uh,

709
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,670
they would eat the,
eat this horse carcass,

710
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:58,170
and then we'd get district on and die.

711
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,033
So doing that,
they extra painted walls from the 

712
00:32:00,811 --> 00:32:04,710
majority of the American West.
That's how they killed them all.

713
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:05,850
Yeah,
it's really.

714
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,940
But then they realized that they did a 
terrible thing by doing that.

715
00:32:08,941 --> 00:32:12,960
And so they started reintroducing them.
There's a balance somewhere.

716
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,250
Obviously.
I love wolves.

717
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:16,630
I think they're cool as hell.
But there's,

718
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,880
there's a,
there is a balance.

719
00:32:17,881 --> 00:32:20,690
But the balance is real tricky.
It's because like there's a,

720
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:23,340
a very small number of them in 
Washington state,

721
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,810
but the small number of them,
the small number of wolf packs,

722
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,100
I've started attacking cattle ranches 
and they're killing these cattle.

723
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,160
And so these ranchers want these wolves 
killed.

724
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,023
And so they've decided to kill some of 
the wolves and it's a huge controversy 

725
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:39,950
in Washington state because they're 
like,

726
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:40,160
look,

727
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,993
there's not that many fucking balls and 
you guys are going to kill these walls 

728
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:43,754
because they're killing the cattle,
but you're going to kill the cattle too 

729
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:48,560
if you want to have cattle.
This is what,

730
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,453
this is the price you pay.
But I'm sure you've seen how they run 

731
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,170
cattle out here.
They just let them roam around on public

732
00:32:54,171 --> 00:32:55,430
land.
You know,

733
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,264
when we were in Nevada,
we were a deer hunting the Steven 

734
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,850
Rinella yet yet.
And we saw a lot of deer.

735
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,550
There's deer everywhere,
but we saw way more cows.

736
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,980
Fucking cows are everywhere and they 
just,

737
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:12,010
they roam all throughout this public 
land and the ranchers pay some sort of a

738
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:15,650
fee and they.
This was,

739
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,150
that was what that whole thing was going
on.

740
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,123
Yeah.
A lot of that happens back home in 

741
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:20,120
Australia as well.
Yeah.

742
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:22,420
So they roam all over the place.

743
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,830
Just fucking cow shit everywhere.
We're essentially,

744
00:33:24,831 --> 00:33:27,170
we're camping out so we're sleeping on 
couches.

745
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,970
There's no shit everywhere.
You live comfortable.

746
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,510
It wasn't happening.
The lox,

747
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,080
spread it out a bit.
I actually wound up sleeping in the back

748
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:35,450
of the suburban.
We had a suburban and I was like,

749
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,280
why are you guys going to sleep on the 
ground?

750
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:40,130
And you just fold the seats back asleep 
on his flat area?

751
00:33:40,131 --> 00:33:40,964
No.
So I camped out in the back of a 

752
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:46,080
suburban while these dummies are 
sleeping on the ground on cow patties.

753
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,570
They want to be done with nature man 
down with cap,

754
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:51,404
who if you want to be down with nature,
take off the sleep you want to really 

755
00:33:54,231 --> 00:33:56,040
get.
But exactly.

756
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:56,874
Yeah.
But it's um,

757
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,070
you know,
these animals,

758
00:33:58,071 --> 00:34:01,160
if you're going to let them wander 
around like that roam free,

759
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:03,530
which is nice because they're 
essentially almost wild.

760
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,050
They're free range cattle.
They're eating grass,

761
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:09,620
so healthiest cattle you could eat,
but wolves like to eat them too.

762
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,700
And so it's a real tricky.
It's like where do you draw the line?

763
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:17,480
There is not that many wounds and these 
wolves are eating these cows and.

764
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,613
But to the ranchers,
each cow is worth several thousand 

765
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,740
dollars every time a wolf kills a cow.
That's a big loss of income.

766
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:27,110
Yeah.
I suppose that's working.

767
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,153
There's gotta be some sort of line there
where we work in conjunction with 

768
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:32,630
wildlife,
with your ranch or not.

769
00:34:32,631 --> 00:34:36,050
Whether you're losing income or not,
you know,

770
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,003
that's got to be part of the system and 
maybe it should be subsidized by the 

771
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,394
taxpayers instead of killing the wolves.
Maybe they should subsidize some of 

772
00:34:43,341 --> 00:34:45,620
these ranchers.
I mean if these wolves are killing,

773
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,813
it's only a certain amount as long as 
they've taken some measure of 

774
00:34:50,181 --> 00:34:52,070
protection,
try to keep the wolves away.

775
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:56,960
But to ensure a healthy wolf population 
would ensure a balanced ecosystem.

776
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,973
See they can't bring it back to where 
they used to be because where they used 

777
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,520
to be,
there was no wool.

778
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,301
Yeah,
exactly.

779
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:03,130
Yeah.
Yeah.

780
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,910
There's a,
there's a funny thing at home,

781
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:07,810
how you sign it should be subsidized.
So I always,

782
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,730
my,
my business is in northwestern Australia

783
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,810
for the mines and they've got their own 
private train law and they run their own

784
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,270
trains.
We've all I know.

785
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,713
And the train lines on fence so the 
cattle can cross the train line anytime 

786
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,580
of trying.
It's one of those cows,

787
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,390
they've got to pay the farmer,
you know.

788
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,483
Oh Wow.
And I've heard stories about the Pharma 

789
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,840
just going out and shooting these cattle
along the train line.

790
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,060
So the mines pay him,
pay him for the cows,

791
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,790
look like they've been hit.
Yeah.

792
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,140
Yeah.
It's pretty funny.

793
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,290
Oh,
that's hilarious.

794
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,010
So maybe we could do

795
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,843
something like that with where the 
wolves just pay out where every time 

796
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:42,290
they kill a cow.
Right.

797
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,920
Some people believe that shit.
Well,

798
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:44,754
someone would probably do that.
There's probably some unscrupulous 

799
00:35:47,191 --> 00:35:48,024
people,
but that didn't get caught and they'd 

800
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:51,150
get prosecuted.
It would balance itself out,

801
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,990
but there's a certain amount of numbers 
where they,

802
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,873
the wolves reach a high population 
number where all the other animals 

803
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:58,164
started getting threatened.
Like there was a recent situation in 

804
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:05,091
Wyoming where these wolves killed 19 elk
and didn't even eat them.

805
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,500
They just killed them.
Real killing.

806
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:09,930
Just fucking around having a good time,
you know?

807
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:11,430
Yeah.
They do that.

808
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:16,320
That's the point where obviously we've 
got to stand in my decision whether it's

809
00:36:16,321 --> 00:36:18,630
a tag system will or some sort of 
calling.

810
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:20,880
You know.
I think before the program we'll talk in

811
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:24,150
about where kangaroos needed to be 
called because it's,

812
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,560
it's a little bit like.
Yeah.

813
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,543
So the Greens don't want to miss the 
greenies that want to kill the 

814
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,090
Kangaroos,
but for the benefit,

815
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:34,493
for the better benefit of Kangaroos.
So it has to come a point where the 

816
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,840
numbers need to be controlled.
Otherwise they ate,

817
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:40,674
they sell out of land and home,
they get diseases and it takes weeks to 

818
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:47,700
die like a suffering death.
Like now on one side.

819
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,190
So you can't be just for one and not the
other.

820
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,110
My Buddy Mike Hockridge,
he lives up in BC,

821
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,030
in northern BC,
British Columbia.

822
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,150
And uh,
he,

823
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,980
he was attacked by Wolf,
like he had shot a wolf in mid air as it

824
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:01,814
was jumping on them.
They have so many wolves up there that 

825
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,620
they have literally a,
had open season.

826
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,020
Like there's no tag limits.
You could shoot wolves.

827
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,090
Sounds like to go there.
Yeah,

828
00:37:11,091 --> 00:37:13,120
it's,
we went up there and this is a,

829
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,810
we were moose hunting.
That's where I got this one.

830
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,320
And uh,
we found a calf that had been torn apart

831
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:22,100
by wolves and it's really fascinating.
But he put this up on his instagram,

832
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,113
his,
um,

833
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:27,260
his instagram is BC outfitter pcf.
This is him last night.

834
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,220
Listen to this shit.

835
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,630
Oh,
that's awesome.

836
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,320
This is just last night.

837
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,160
It'd be hell and back.
Come in by me and say what happened?

838
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,990
Started.
He actually started it.

839
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,390
He started the howl.
We can hear it here.

840
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,890
Yeah.
He called him.

841
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,340
God,
that's it.

842
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,623
That's a theory.
That sand when you're in camp by 

843
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:04,450
yourself.
When you hear that.

844
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,753
I ran.
Yah.

845
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,560
That's what a fucking awesome in the 
area.

846
00:38:08,561 --> 00:38:12,120
At the same time animal ever because 
they're smart.

847
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,660
You operate in packs.
They have really complex social system.

848
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,580
I'll tell you these cool little story.
When I was in northwest territory,

849
00:38:19,581 --> 00:38:20,414
good luck just above the arctic circle.
The first time I've been in the country 

850
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:26,080
like the Mckenzie Mountains and I was 
actually hunting Moose,

851
00:38:26,081 --> 00:38:30,190
but I had a wolf tag as well and the 
very first morning like we get up out of

852
00:38:30,191 --> 00:38:32,380
the tent,
we walk up the river and with a guide,

853
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,223
Byron and I say it like a pack.
Wolves coming down the river and so 

854
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:40,630
they'd been hunting that area I think 
ended up being day three.

855
00:38:40,631 --> 00:38:41,464
They.
They chased the Caribou up and down the 

856
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:45,250
river like just to a levering sweat.

857
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,503
Then like chase in the river and I 
surrendered that didn't the with the 

858
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,430
river and that Caribou and was a bull as
well.

859
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,563
Got to the point.
It's whole body was quivering because 

860
00:38:53,891 --> 00:38:58,450
it's been really hot and then it's been 
chased into this freezing cold river.

861
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,003
At that point the wolves just left it 
and they all went up and sat in the sun 

862
00:39:02,561 --> 00:39:03,394
because they a wet as well.
They went and sat in the sun and I got 

863
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:09,160
old dry and then it was like mother 
nature just took over.

864
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:09,994
From that point they they,
they got the Caribou to the point where 

865
00:39:12,011 --> 00:39:12,844
they knew it was going to die and left 
it and ended up I couldn't hold its own 

866
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:18,730
legs up and end up laying down in the 
river and drowned in the river.

867
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,400
How cool is that?
That they knew that,

868
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,713
so the.
The wolves get to the point where 

869
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:24,311
they're like,
okay,

870
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,140
we're going to go and sit in the sun now
and dry out.

871
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,280
This thing's dead.
Anyway,

872
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,800
we're just kind of come back to it now.
Once it's drowned in the river,

873
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,080
what the fuck?
How do they know that?

874
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:32,690
That's crazy.

875
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,050
And then by that afternoon that Caribou 
was just a ribcage.

876
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,123
Like they just,
they absolutely plucked every bit of 

877
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:41,900
meat and organs out of that Caribou.

878
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,610
Wow.
How cool is that?

879
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:46,320
I've got photos of it actually.
Do real work.

880
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,323
Do you have online anywhere?
They probably all my instagram early 

881
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,590
days.
Instagram.

882
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,423
Yeah.
So Adam Green tree bone and tag them on 

883
00:39:53,121 --> 00:39:53,980
my instagram.
So if,

884
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,060
see if you could find those champions,
but uh,

885
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,600
you'll see these Caribou just standing 
in the water and I'm like,

886
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,300
it was just quivering.
It was,

887
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,760
it was done.
It was done.

888
00:40:02,761 --> 00:40:04,370
And I knew that it was done and they're 
just like,

889
00:40:04,371 --> 00:40:06,470
oh,
we'll come back in an hour and a fucking

890
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:09,640
smarter than fucking smarter than.
Cool.

891
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,430
Have you also heard that in their spore?
Um,

892
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,420
there's um,
something

893
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,880
that,
like elk,

894
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:20,280
if they sniff it stays in the dirt 
forever.

895
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:23,100
So they basically shoot it out,
stays in the dirt forever.

896
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:26,430
An elk will go long grazing and eat the 
grass.

897
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:29,090
And this spore attacks the elks lungs in
drinks,

898
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,600
the lung capacity.
So it's,

899
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,583
it,
it's,

900
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,110
it basically makes the elk tired when 
they're

901
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,160
running for the wolf to grab them at a 
later date.

902
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,100
Wait a minute.
So then we looked,

903
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,440
they thought they shit out.
The what,

904
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,383
what they ate and spores spores are 
released into the dirt when the elk 

905
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,790
eating,
eating the grass.

906
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,380
Like they take it into their system and 
it produces their lung capacity,

907
00:40:54,381 --> 00:40:55,214
reduces their lung capacity.
So it's like they're poisoning the well 

908
00:40:57,781 --> 00:40:58,614
before they jack them.
Is that not the ultimate Predator or 

909
00:41:01,341 --> 00:41:03,130
not?
Yeah.

910
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:06,230
How is nature so complex?
And it's cool,

911
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:07,520
isn't it?
Well,

912
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,480
the thing about wolves now too,
it's really kind of cool to see.

913
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,383
I'm so torn.
I'm so torn because on one hand I love 

914
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,410
elk hunting.
I love elk.

915
00:41:15,411 --> 00:41:17,600
I love the idea that they're out there 
and they're wild.

916
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:22,040
But I'm a big fan of wolves.
I love the fact that these wolves are so

917
00:41:22,041 --> 00:41:25,430
fucking bad ass ranch is right now gone.

918
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,980
Fuck you.
Joe Rogan.

919
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,330
Well,
my friend Mike,

920
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,163
he where he lives in BC,
his neighbors ranch gang of them jumped 

921
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,080
cow like they got,
they got hungry and that winter and they

922
00:41:36,081 --> 00:41:36,561
said,
you know,

923
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,380
let's just fucking do this.
How much easier of a feed is that?

924
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,050
Pretty easy nail that runs flood out 
that's got legs,

925
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,590
that standard,
the grant effect,

926
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:46,100
Kale that's down here that might even 
run away,

927
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:46,963
you know,
it's a pendant to the ELC was pinned in 

928
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,920
or the cow rather was coming in and 
they,

929
00:41:51,921 --> 00:41:53,050
they,
they jumped on,

930
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:54,560
jumped the fence.
I guess,

931
00:41:54,561 --> 00:41:58,580
and this is one of the things that's so 
appealing to me about bow hunting.

932
00:41:58,581 --> 00:42:00,860
It's not actually just bow hunting,
it's the holiday though.

933
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,873
Whole pitcher and wildlife.
When you get into it like this and you 

934
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:06,620
start looking at it and thinking about 
it,

935
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,420
it's crazy.
Who doesn't want to be a part of that?

936
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,613
Well,
we're so filtered from it for the most 

937
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:11,684
part,
most people's interaction with wild 

938
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:16,880
animals in the zoo or a squirrel who 
look,

939
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:20,120
I see a skunk.
There's an eagle.

940
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,100
Crazy.
Oh my gosh.

941
00:42:22,101 --> 00:42:25,010
Yeah.
I saw an eagle like it's a big day,

942
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,400
but to actually go to a place like where
you went and to hear well,

943
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,750
a lot of people always like,
oh,

944
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:33,880
that's crazy.
That's crazy.

945
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,023
It's actually not that crazy when you go
out and experience that sort of things 

946
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:38,143
happening all the time.
It's just that people are so 

947
00:42:40,101 --> 00:42:42,680
disconnected because they're not out 
there experiencing it.

948
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,033
I was telling a story,
but we're going to wedgetail illegal at 

949
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:48,440
home and I can hear these pig squeal and
like,

950
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,510
I'm like,
like a lock.

951
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:51,353
My knees just can't pick up where these 
peak school and coming from and it's 

952
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,620
going straight over the top of my head.

953
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,453
There's a which title?
Legal with this pig and it flies it 

954
00:42:57,561 --> 00:42:58,394
over.
It knew exactly what it was doing and 

955
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,213
flies that gets it up real high and it 
drops it perfectly over this rocky 

956
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:08,060
outcrop on the mountain to open it up 
like that stock,

957
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,903
man.
You gone.

958
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,600
I need a steak knife to cut into the 
meat.

959
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,600
Yeah.
That was just gone on eight,

960
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,400
a rocky outcrop to cut into this meat 
and potatoes.

961
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:18,530
The pig.
That was pretty decent.

962
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:20,180
It was like this,
like 40 pounds,

963
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,350
50 pounds,
40 pounds,

964
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:26,090
maybe 30.
I've seen them drop goats off cliffs,

965
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,283
like the goats are climbing cliffs and 
the Eagle swoops down and grabs a hold 

966
00:43:29,541 --> 00:43:30,374
of it and how bad that video with the 
Eagle tries to pick up the baby out of 

967
00:43:34,851 --> 00:43:36,860
the pram or whatever,
and that's real,

968
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,840
don't.
Yeah,

969
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,920
I think that's fake Internet.

970
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,530
Seriously.
I'm sure it's probably happened before.

971
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,660
Definitely happened.
When you look in the eye of an eagle,

972
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,530
you realize,
oh yeah,

973
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:49,670
the thing would eat a baby.
Yeah.

974
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,700
I think the idea that it would need a 
baby's a joke they had built for it.

975
00:43:52,701 --> 00:43:54,080
It's just another animal.
Yeah.

976
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:55,100
They don't give a fuck kid.
No,

977
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:56,890
no offense to anyone's babies,
but yeah,

978
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:57,883
no.
The reality is there's a great video of 

979
00:44:01,491 --> 00:44:02,324
this guy in Alaska.
We've played it on the podcast for the 

980
00:44:04,731 --> 00:44:08,720
guy with all the eagles in his yard.
Eagles in Alaska are so prevalent.

981
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,270
I have a friend who goes up there and 
she was telling me that they're like,

982
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:12,670
pigeons.
She's like,

983
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,120
they're like fucking pigeons were 
everywhere.

984
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:14,954
Like you don't even care anymore,
like these fucking things out here with 

985
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:17,924
this guy's got this backyard and in his 
backyard he's got fucking hundreds and 

986
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,153
hundreds of eagles.

987
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:28,400
I mean maybe not hundreds,
150,

988
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,930
15 ago,
10:30,

989
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,800
but they're fucking everywhere.
Is this the video?

990
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,480
So this is the same one.
So what it is,

991
00:44:36,481 --> 00:44:38,940
is he's got a.
where did I come up with hundreds?

992
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,893
How dare me.
So he's got a bunch of fish that he's 

993
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,950
got laid out and uh,
they've got it.

994
00:44:44,951 --> 00:44:45,784
I'm like,
look at this,

995
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,630
look at all these fucking eagles just 
walking around this guy's backyard.

996
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,780
This ain't shit compared to what we're 
going to show you in a minute folks.

997
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,063
But um,
these eagles are wandering around this 

998
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:59,880
guy's yard and he has his kid take a 
bucket of fish and dump it out for these

999
00:44:59,881 --> 00:45:00,714
eagles.
And I just would not be that confident 

1000
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,770
having these fucking monsters coming 
here.

1001
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,090
My kids.
No,

1002
00:45:08,091 --> 00:45:10,830
that'd be a sort of raptors,
man.

1003
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:15,070
This is,
I don't know that saying video.

1004
00:45:15,071 --> 00:45:15,990
Grab each one of them.

1005
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:17,580
God,
look at this thing.

1006
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,590
There is so weird.
It's such a weird animal that's a living

1007
00:45:22,591 --> 00:45:23,670
dinosaur.
Oh,

1008
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,780
it really is.
Yeah.

1009
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,630
It's such a weird animal too.
It's just so strange.

1010
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:31,560
And we chose that heartless monster is 
the American bird,

1011
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,210
you know.
I mean,

1012
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:34,043
couldn't.
Couldn't be American animal would be 

1013
00:45:34,771 --> 00:45:38,130
like a puppy or something.
We've got on our coins,

1014
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:39,870
I've got like platypus.
And wombat.

1015
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:43,380
Nothing would take nothing close.
That's a good move because this thing is

1016
00:45:43,381 --> 00:45:48,210
just living dinosaur,
like literally a raptor of flying raptor

1017
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,840
look at.
It's just creep once,

1018
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,400
once that fish but doesn't want to take 
a chance of getting shot.

1019
00:45:53,430 --> 00:45:54,840
I won't.
One an eagle.

1020
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,020
Yep.
I've got a weight AAPL my property up in

1021
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:58,854
the mountains on my farm.
We've got a couple of wage tiles that 

1022
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,380
hang around up there and whenever we 
kill a deer we leave the coc and say,

1023
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:05,214
oh,
I'll put a scout in camera on it and 

1024
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:07,314
stuff like that and just to see these 
things come down and they eat and what 

1025
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:09,690
they do.

1026
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:10,523
So cool.
Now a wedgetail egos at the size of a 

1027
00:46:12,661 --> 00:46:15,690
Golden Eagle or a bald eagle or how big 
they get.

1028
00:46:15,691 --> 00:46:17,050
A couple of meters in wingspan.
They.

1029
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,540
Oh Wow.
So it is like that,

1030
00:46:18,541 --> 00:46:19,920
but yeah.
Wow.

1031
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,090
Have you ever seen the heartbeat eagle?
That's the biggest one.

1032
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,343
Yeah.
Lives in Venezuela and they eat monkeys 

1033
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,500
and it's uh,
it's fucked up to watch man.

1034
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:33,540
It's really stressful with your last 
day.

1035
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:36,060
I think that she was on,
like,

1036
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,330
I'd just be straight up stressing all 
the time.

1037
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,620
I just lay out and be like,
guess get it over and done with.

1038
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,670
Yeah.
There's a,

1039
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,810
they love sloss because sloths are just 
designed to get fucked up by the eagles.

1040
00:46:45,811 --> 00:46:49,830
I love this eagle is God damn huge.
Look at the monkeys.

1041
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:51,790
Like fuck this.
The monkeys like,

1042
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,840
get out of here man.
But the sloths can't do anything.

1043
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:55,890
They're just so slow.

1044
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,300
They can't do shit shit except foot 
stare at it and go piss off.

1045
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:02,220
He just walks up to it and grabs it.
He's like,

1046
00:47:02,221 --> 00:47:04,110
man,
let me just fucking claw the shit out of

1047
00:47:04,111 --> 00:47:04,770
you here,
dude.

1048
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,290
Bloody get off me.
Don't touch me.

1049
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:08,620
Look at this.
Poor Long.

1050
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,320
Not a goddamn thing.
You can do.

1051
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,450
Look at him.
Oh,

1052
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:13,410
this is a weird one.
I haven't seen this video.

1053
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,573
All right,
watch out.

1054
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,490
I'll touch her titties.
Getting out to be the only one I've seen

1055
00:47:17,491 --> 00:47:21,840
before is one swoops down and grabs one 
says slough fights back.

1056
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,280
Oh,
barely.

1057
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,141
Really?
A fight.

1058
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:26,580
But no,
get fade.

1059
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,800
That's guy that's going to be when 
you're 90,

1060
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,090
you get in a head lock.
Fucking carrier.

1061
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,580
Just so weird that nature gave this 
animal.

1062
00:47:36,581 --> 00:47:40,050
No defense system in nature.
Just fuck this loft.

1063
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:40,923
How coola off you say that one walk and 
it's almost looks like it's got bloody 

1064
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:48,460
algae growing on that green one on the 
road.

1065
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:49,620
How weird are they?
Will do.

1066
00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:51,610
A lot of them do have.
Oh yeah,

1067
00:47:51,611 --> 00:47:56,380
they do have green growing on them.
One at a zoo here that has all this mold

1068
00:47:56,381 --> 00:47:58,580
grow all over its back and you can.
Yeah,

1069
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,553
look at it right there.
That's the ones because they move so 

1070
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:05,560
slow that literally moss and shit can 
grow on them.

1071
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,530
What a fucking goofy ass productive 
jaimee.

1072
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:10,540
I like synergy sight sound.
He's like boom.

1073
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:13,690
He's the best.
The best man.

1074
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:15,640
He needs another one.
Another race,

1075
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,830
another raise for changing.
Look at this fucking thing,

1076
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,490
man.
I mean that doesn't even look real.

1077
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,800
If you told me that that was a creature 
in a movie,

1078
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:25,090
I'd be like,
that's going to come and get you.

1079
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:29,380
That's the boogie monster comes in the 
middle of the night.

1080
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:35,050
He already eats babies and that's what 
it looks like.

1081
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,173
It looks like some fake crazy that 
technology has brought us this fall 

1082
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:41,550
where we can look at a video right now 
at that slaw.

1083
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,930
But to tell you the truth,
if you hadn't traveled the world,

1084
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:46,120
you wouldn't even know that animal 
really existed.

1085
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:47,163
Well,
that's why they used to have to have 

1086
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,424
zoos.
That's one of the main reasons why I'm 

1087
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:50,700
opposed to zoos.
Yeah.

1088
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:51,491
I mean I'm,
I'm,

1089
00:48:51,491 --> 00:48:52,324
I'm pro zoo as far as like,
they raise a lot of money for 

1090
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,234
conservation.
There's some animals that actually 

1091
00:48:56,921 --> 00:48:57,754
thrive in zoos.
Like we were joking around about it the 

1092
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:02,650
other day about giraffes.
I used to have this joke in my act about

1093
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,630
giraffes don't give a fuck about being 
the zoo.

1094
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:06,310
They don't feel bad at all.
They love it.

1095
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,533
They just wander around going another 
day and then just slowly walk around 

1096
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,500
because drafts are the only animal.

1097
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,523
You let babies feed them,
but what if they don't realize that got 

1098
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:18,900
life,
that good luck us today.

1099
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,153
You know,
like it takes a back country hunt for 

1100
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,750
you to go home and go,
shit,

1101
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,490
I just flick a switch and a light comes 
on.

1102
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,493
Any type of hot water comes on.
Those drives are probably just ignorant 

1103
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:29,890
and I really don't know.
You know?

1104
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,370
They definitely know they've got a good.
There's not lions chasing them everyday.

1105
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,560
Well,
what's fucked up about the Santa Barbara

1106
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,700
Zoo?
Santa Barbara Zoo is great,

1107
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,593
but the fucking,
the a giraffe cage is right next to the 

1108
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:44,810
lion cage.
Like literally is that tear?

1109
00:49:44,811 --> 00:49:45,730
Remind them,
boy,

1110
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,480
this is what it could be like.
That's what they should do.

1111
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:52,630
They should let them out for a week.
They should let him out for a week.

1112
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:56,260
Let lines and shit chased him around,
let them back into zero and go see.

1113
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:57,850
That's what it could be like.
What do you want?

1114
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,860
Yeah,
stop being such an asshole.

1115
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,200
He let us live.
But look at this,

1116
00:50:02,201 --> 00:50:04,840
people can feed them and look at that 
little kid.

1117
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,750
No one's even remotely worried about the
behavior of giraffes.

1118
00:50:07,751 --> 00:50:09,710
They've never exhibited any aggressive 
behavior.

1119
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:12,610
Katie looked a bit stressed.
He just didn't know.

1120
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,040
He's just maybe a little pissy about 
that.

1121
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,930
Kids going to grow up,
but Jitsu kick your ass.

1122
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:23,020
I don't think he's got more than Jujitsu
for a giraffe.

1123
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,870
Ninety,
you'd be raw.

1124
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:27,980
You need a hoist.
So these giraffes are right

1125
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,813
next to this fucking cage where,
I mean there are only separated by a 

1126
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:32,294
couple of fences.
There's two fences and right over there 

1127
00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:35,960
as these lionesses,
that's all.

1128
00:50:36,050 --> 00:50:37,730
And you can get.
They have fit glass.

1129
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:39,770
You can get right like where you are to 
me,

1130
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:42,440
you can get right up to the line,
but when you get right up to them,

1131
00:50:42,441 --> 00:50:45,380
you feel so vulnerable.
Like you know there's glass,

1132
00:50:45,381 --> 00:50:48,850
but that cat's looking at you and you'll
let your whole body just starts going,

1133
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,620
get the fuck out.
We should.

1134
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,070
That's your instinct,
dude.

1135
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,130
What are you doing?
Yeah,

1136
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,910
there's something about cats.
Oh,

1137
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:59,840
you've seen this one where this baby is 
standing there.

1138
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,800
It turns its back and the lion,
the lion can't even help it.

1139
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,570
No,
it's just the instinct.

1140
00:51:05,571 --> 00:51:07,910
Yeah.
But as soon as the kid turns its back,

1141
00:51:07,911 --> 00:51:08,950
it's like,
no,

1142
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,040
fuck man.
Shit.

1143
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:15,230
Did you see any mountain lions when 
you're out there?

1144
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,380
A one count into the kill site.
He's Prince role for the snow there.

1145
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:20,401
Really?
Yeah,

1146
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:23,070
and that country's pretty known for 
mountain lions as well.

1147
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:26,460
A two or three years ago when I was in 
there and we've got fresh.

1148
00:51:26,461 --> 00:51:27,750
No,
and I went right up high.

1149
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:31,040
I'm big mountain tracks like in that 
space because there was fresh.

1150
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,940
Now I'm sure there's fresh mountain 
tracks everywhere.

1151
00:51:32,941 --> 00:51:33,774
I walked everyday,
but it's just that there was fresh snow 

1152
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:37,260
and it left the tracks perfectly in the 
snow.

1153
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:41,550
Like how many times do you walk past the
mountain lion and staring at your.

1154
00:51:41,551 --> 00:51:42,384
How many times has it been a mountain 
lion off in the distance looking at Ya 

1155
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,373
and you had no idea it was there.
You don't know they're there and then 

1156
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:52,140
every now and then you'll get a weird 
feeling like I'm being funny sense.

1157
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:53,910
You know,
and I hate saying it because people will

1158
00:51:53,911 --> 00:51:54,744
say bullshit,
but I'll get a funny feeling that 

1159
00:51:56,851 --> 00:51:59,340
someone's looking at me and if I stopped
at that point and have a look around,

1160
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:00,203
chances are I'll find a deer or a fox or
something staring at me from in the up 

1161
00:52:05,371 --> 00:52:07,110
on the ridge or in the timber or 
something like that.

1162
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,070
Happened with Shane.
Dorian.

1163
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:09,480
Yeah.
Shane on the show not long ago,

1164
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:10,853
Shane was out hunting with me just 
before he come on your show and I 

1165
00:52:14,071 --> 00:52:14,904
stopped.
I'm like,

1166
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:15,923
dude,
I just got this weird feeling of being 

1167
00:52:16,651 --> 00:52:18,210
watched and we looked around and then 
yeah,

1168
00:52:18,211 --> 00:52:20,310
there's a box like looking beyond the 
three,

1169
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,660
staring straight at us,
you know,

1170
00:52:21,661 --> 00:52:23,640
so it's like,
it tickles a sense,

1171
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:24,260
that's for sure.

1172
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,240
Do you think,
you know,

1173
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:30,250
this is going to get into the womb.
Do you think that when you're out in the

1174
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:36,731
woods for days on end a week on end with
no cell phone service?

1175
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,660
No,
nothing.

1176
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:43,610
Just quiet woods and animals and you're 
alone.

1177
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:44,473
It's just you.
Do you think that activates certain 

1178
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,460
senses or reignite certain centers that 
are dormant?

1179
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:50,294
Right.
Ignites

1180
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,193
really.
We kind of gone for such a long period 

1181
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:55,390
where you had to hunt,
you know,

1182
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,930
that's just how people were,
you know,

1183
00:52:56,931 --> 00:52:57,764
like the natural world is people out in 
the woods just like with the animals 

1184
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,583
that all that ignites and it fades when 
we're looking at frigging technology 

1185
00:53:07,581 --> 00:53:11,870
like we do or you're so busy in your 
lifestyle and what you in what you do,

1186
00:53:11,871 --> 00:53:14,040
like obviously parts of the body's got 
to,

1187
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:15,590
you know,
we to shut this down.

1188
00:53:15,591 --> 00:53:16,590
We're doing this now.
You know,

1189
00:53:16,591 --> 00:53:19,340
we're moving forward in the world,
move forward in the world.

1190
00:53:19,341 --> 00:53:20,360
Bullshit.
Let's move back.

1191
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:24,020
That definitely ignites and it's what I 
just said,

1192
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:24,943
you know where I'm like,
I feel like someone's watching watching 

1193
00:53:28,241 --> 00:53:29,074
this or the way you react or your 
listening or what you're here and just 

1194
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,550
all your senses become so fine tuned to 
the wilderness.

1195
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,860
A man.
It's a beautiful thing.

1196
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,023
Yeah.
The move forward is an interesting way 

1197
00:53:39,931 --> 00:53:43,470
of looking at it because I don't think 
technology necessarily is having us move

1198
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:46,020
forward,
but what it's definitely having us do is

1199
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,030
move different.
We're,

1200
00:53:48,031 --> 00:53:48,720
we're,
we're,

1201
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:49,553
we're interacting with each other less 
in the physical sense and more in the 

1202
00:53:52,921 --> 00:53:53,754
digital sense and we're way less likely 
to interact with the rest of the wild 

1203
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:00,660
world.
Where in the world the wild.

1204
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,260
That's a weird term to like.
I've always felt like the word outdoors,

1205
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,010
like I love the outdoors,
like how fucking weird or people that we

1206
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:10,640
call the whole world outdoors,
but I like,

1207
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:15,240
we're so used to being in these shelters
that the sheltered life is normal,

1208
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,440
but the outdoors out of the shelter.
Well that's the actual word.

1209
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:19,590
That's actual world.
Yeah.

1210
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,090
That's you.
What?

1211
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,730
You go to the door to go out there 
camping.

1212
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,050
You go to the outdoor?
Yeah.

1213
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:26,910
Oh,
well the outdoors.

1214
00:54:26,911 --> 00:54:28,650
Like what a weird description.
Yeah.

1215
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,210
Outdoors.
You know,

1216
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,790
it's a strange way of looking at the 
wilderness.

1217
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,060
The wilderness is a much better term,
but outdoors is like,

1218
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:37,440
oh,
I love the great outdoors.

1219
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,320
What the fuck are you talking about?
I love the world.

1220
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:41,154
How it is today.
I think he said it on a shy not long 

1221
00:54:43,171 --> 00:54:44,004
ago.
We had never had it better than we have 

1222
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:46,830
now.
One hundred percent.

1223
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:49,200
If you don't think we've got a better 
now,

1224
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:50,183
it's because you're not looking at and 
you're not appreciating everything that 

1225
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,750
there is,
so I like technology in the sense that I

1226
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:58,140
can connect with a lot of people you 
campaigns and stuff like that.

1227
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:02,070
I wouldn't have friendships with you 
guys if it wasn't for how technology was

1228
00:55:02,071 --> 00:55:03,600
to die.
You live on the other side of that.

1229
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:05,310
Exactly.
How crazy is that?

1230
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:09,360
And the world becomes really small,
so I love all that,

1231
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:10,253
but at the scientologist height,
the disconnect that pay will have a 

1232
00:55:13,111 --> 00:55:17,220
height that everyone's so busy trying to
work for a living and have a nice car or

1233
00:55:17,221 --> 00:55:18,054
a big house or something like that,
and in the end that shit's not even 

1234
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:21,840
important.
It doesn't even matter.

1235
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:23,063
It's not like it's not the memory that 
you're going to get from going out to 

1236
00:55:25,501 --> 00:55:27,900
the wilderness or the connection or the 
appreciation.

1237
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:31,590
I appreciate me because I've had to kill
myself.

1238
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,210
I appreciate power because of going 
without power for weeks.

1239
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,350
I appreciate hot water.
You appreciate all those things.

1240
00:55:38,351 --> 00:55:40,020
Like a car,
a paved road,

1241
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,630
rubbish service.
Someone comes to your house and collects

1242
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,570
you frigging rubbish.
Serious.

1243
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,030
Not Serious about it.
Yeah.

1244
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:52,200
There was a point where we couldn't get 
done what we would today because you had

1245
00:55:52,201 --> 00:55:53,990
so much else to do,
right?

1246
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:54,893
You're on rubbish.
Probably grow your own vegetables or 

1247
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,620
drive or walk or horse.
Ride the dye into town to get vegetables

1248
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,580
or whatever it was and washing your 
clothes.

1249
00:56:05,581 --> 00:56:08,650
We didn't sit in there for scrubbing 
brush and Washington.

1250
00:56:08,651 --> 00:56:10,310
You close over.
Bode would take hours and hours.

1251
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,153
Now you just throw it into a machine.
I'll come back and get it when it's 

1252
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:17,670
convenient for me and pull it out so you
get to do a lot more in today's world,

1253
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:21,510
but it also.
There's so much to do that it's a lot of

1254
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:25,270
people don't get to do what we do and go
outdoors and experience at or appreciate

1255
00:56:25,271 --> 00:56:27,310
those things because they haven't had 
that hardship.

1256
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,683
You know,
the mountains is a hard can be a hard 

1257
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:31,454
and miserable experience,
but it makes you appreciate the things 

1258
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:36,370
in modern life

1259
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,910
that are hard anymore.
It's a prospective enhancer because it's

1260
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:41,890
a reality check because you realize,
wow,

1261
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,993
what a strange world we live in,
that we need shelter and we fire and we 

1262
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:50,530
need all this stuff in order to survive 
without that stuff.

1263
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,680
When you're out there like as as 
minimalistic as you've done it,

1264
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:54,543
like doing it with a small pack,
which few days where the food and 

1265
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:00,520
sleeping under a cloth house,
a little tent,

1266
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:01,354
you know,
I mean that's a perspective enhanced 

1267
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:03,943
because it gives you this real 
appreciation of what people have 

1268
00:57:06,341 --> 00:57:10,750
actually accomplished,
but most folks are not doing that and so

1269
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:13,750
they get really detached from where 
their food comes from.

1270
00:57:13,751 --> 00:57:17,680
Really detached from the world itself 
and it's not,

1271
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:18,723
it's not their fault.
It's just the environment that you're 

1272
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:23,080
accustomed to.
We're all accustomed to supermarkets and

1273
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:26,200
restaurants and being able to just get a
bottle of water.

1274
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,900
I'm thirsty.
Let me just pop the top on.

1275
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:31,300
This table is still complaining about 
that Shit.

1276
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,740
That's the crazy thing,
I

1277
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,650
think people will still complain about 
that and I'm like,

1278
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,420
dude,
you need to check yourself.

1279
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,440
Went to Africa a couple of years ago and
was lucky enough,

1280
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:40,303
real poor village and in Mozambique and 
everyone's still smiling like it was an 

1281
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,900
unseasonal year and it was really cold.
So,

1282
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:52,560
um,
what we go for this village and a lot of

1283
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:54,300
these villages,
you've never seen what person before,

1284
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:55,134
and we go for these villages and it's 
free o'clock in the morning and they're 

1285
00:57:57,961 --> 00:58:02,961
all standing around the fire.
And I said to the guy beside me,

1286
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:04,950
the local guy,
I'm like,

1287
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:06,360
oh,
did they all start work early?

1288
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,410
And he's like,
Nah,

1289
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:08,910
like,
can't sleep.

1290
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,800
And I'm like,
what do you mean they can't sleep?

1291
00:58:10,801 --> 00:58:11,520
And he's like,
well,

1292
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,353
it's really cold.
I don't have blankets or anything like 

1293
00:58:13,831 --> 00:58:15,450
that.
So they get up in the morning,

1294
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:18,630
they started far and they all huddle 
around the fire to get warm because it's

1295
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:19,464
freezing.

1296
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:24,390
And it's not that they don't have the 
money to buy blankets.

1297
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,030
There's no blankets,
there's no frigging blankets for sale.

1298
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,740
It's as simple as that.
There's not like,

1299
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,633
oh,
they don't have the $20 to buy a 

1300
00:58:30,961 --> 00:58:33,580
blanket.
There is not even the resource for there

1301
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,790
to be a blanket available for in the 
Bot.

1302
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,550
There's babies crawling around in dust 
that's like six,

1303
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:39,300
seven,
eight,

1304
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,133
eight inches thick.
The dust around the village because you 

1305
00:58:42,441 --> 00:58:43,180
know,
all the,

1306
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:45,060
they'll walk around the village and 
created a lot of dust.

1307
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:48,150
No one's complained in there.
That's what they used to.

1308
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:53,070
And they're happy frog fro someone from 
our society in that man,

1309
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:53,904
they'd be miserable.
They probably cut their own freaking 

1310
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:56,790
risks and,
and,

1311
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,833
and all.
I,

1312
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,990
I come home from their thinking.
Those people have got it that hard.

1313
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,003
It's what they used to,
but they've got that hard and they're 

1314
00:59:04,051 --> 00:59:05,770
still smiling,
you know.

1315
00:59:05,771 --> 00:59:08,460
And it was a bit of a check for me.
I've got power,

1316
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:09,563
I've got running water and I've always 
been appreciative of these things 

1317
00:59:11,371 --> 00:59:13,250
anyway.
But um,

1318
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,720
we've got power,
we've got water,

1319
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,150
we've got in Australia,
we've got Medicare,

1320
00:59:18,151 --> 00:59:19,770
you know,
like real good health services.

1321
00:59:19,771 --> 00:59:22,040
We've got everything like that and 
people still find

1322
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:22,873
something to complain about and it's 
just because I haven't been through a 

1323
00:59:25,281 --> 00:59:26,114
real hardship in their life that they 
don't realize it could be a hell of a 

1324
00:59:29,001 --> 00:59:30,680
lot harder than this.
This isn't even hard.

1325
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:32,600
It's easy.
It's just what we're used to and we used

1326
00:59:32,601 --> 00:59:34,040
to complain in the Baylor.
Well,

1327
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:39,041
it's also one of the strange things that
we've created by co creating houses that

1328
00:59:39,171 --> 00:59:44,171
have electricity inside them and easy 
access to food and shelter with sleep,

1329
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:47,350
but a nice comfortable mattress.
What?

1330
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,690
By doing that and by detaching ourselves
from the natural world,

1331
00:59:50,691 --> 00:59:55,520
I think we remove just a little bit of 
the mystery of being alive.

1332
00:59:55,550 --> 01:00:00,140
How bizarre it really is to be a living 
creature and amazing.

1333
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:01,610
It is amazing.
Yes.

1334
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:02,690
I mean,
when you're.

1335
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,553
When you were walking through the woods 
and you're seeing that grizzly bear who 

1336
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:06,763
sleeping on the carcass of the elk,
that bear has been living like that 

1337
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,340
probably for if you've ran into an 11 
foot bear,

1338
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,810
how many years is he like 15 years old 
and being.

1339
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:19,670
Yeah,
it's a giant fucking huge monster bear.

1340
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:25,020
That's just out there surviving the hard
way for a long time in Montana.

1341
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:28,770
Going through these winters doesn't give
a shit if it rains.

1342
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:31,010
If it's sunny,
if it's snowing,

1343
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:33,020
doesn't give a shit.
It doesn't even give a shit about a pack

1344
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:35,120
of wolves.
Black doll eyes.

1345
01:00:35,121 --> 01:00:35,954
You see their eyes when you look.
I ran into one grizzly bear in my life 

1346
01:00:39,621 --> 01:00:44,110
where it was in the wild only once and 
it was last year with Cam and Alberta.

1347
01:00:44,111 --> 01:00:44,944
I was actually with Jen,
Jen and Jen said turnarounds at grizzly 

1348
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,624
and we turned around.
This is grizzly looking at us and this 

1349
01:00:52,671 --> 01:00:55,300
motherfucker was looking through me.
Yeah,

1350
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,790
there's such a difference in the way 
they look at you and he's not looking at

1351
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,100
it and going,
I'll try Rogan.

1352
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:02,270
No,
they look through.

1353
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:06,950
Look through you and the Strangeness 
Apex Predator Way.

1354
01:01:07,310 --> 01:01:08,143
Well,
they have like this dead look in their 

1355
01:01:08,871 --> 01:01:09,770
eyes.
It's very.

1356
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,350
It's a very strange,
endless.

1357
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:12,291
Yeah,
it is.

1358
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:13,124
It's like A.
I shouldn't say Saul was probably so 

1359
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,490
harsh,
harsh way,

1360
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,590
but I don't even know if a soul is real,
but that what you're saying.

1361
01:01:18,591 --> 01:01:20,210
Exactly that.
I don't give a shit.

1362
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,030
They don't give a shit.
That's what it is.

1363
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:24,920
Compassionate.
This is just a part of life.

1364
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,910
If I feel like I'm gonna,
I'm going figure it out.

1365
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,744
Yeah.
I remember the first video I ever saw a 

1366
01:01:29,721 --> 01:01:33,020
bear killed a moose.
The bear chased the Moose,

1367
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:37,130
knocked it down and started eating it.
Guts first while it was alive.

1368
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,260
Just holding it down and eating it.
That's nice.

1369
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,600
Yeah.
This is it.

1370
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:42,553
This is the funny bit.
You know where these extreme greenies 

1371
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:47,810
think these animals go around hugging 
each other.

1372
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:48,321
Yeah.
Like,

1373
01:01:48,321 --> 01:01:49,154
ah,
that's my cousin and I will have cut to 

1374
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,820
catch up and have it be lighter and shit
like that.

1375
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:53,810
No,
I didn't give a fuck.

1376
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,950
They don't care if you're screaming and 
hal and it's just going to eat you.

1377
01:01:56,970 --> 01:02:01,550
It's like the [inaudible] a dingoes back
home if thing.

1378
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:03,500
Guys get a cough back home.
They don't lock all.

1379
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:06,560
I'm going to be humane with this cough.
I'll,

1380
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,090
um,
I'll bought it first.

1381
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:09,890
I'll tear it out and make sure it's 
died.

1382
01:02:09,891 --> 01:02:13,520
And it's peaceful and stuff like that.
They'll just start eating it right there

1383
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,354
and then it will die in its own time.
You know that that's not even a full 

1384
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:18,920
process for these animals.
No.

1385
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:21,540
They're just concerned with consumption.
When you,

1386
01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,230
when you do see them do it too.
When you do see them eat something,

1387
01:02:25,231 --> 01:02:27,150
it's just like,
oh yeah,

1388
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:28,050
of course.
That's how they do.

1389
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,160
Exactly.
Yeah,

1390
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:30,840
but you don't.
You don't think of it that way.

1391
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,040
You know,
it's movies,

1392
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:32,933
man.
Movies have confused the shit out of 

1393
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:37,800
people and then being away from them for
long periods of time.

1394
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,753
Yeah.
But we can't blame the movies because 

1395
01:02:40,021 --> 01:02:42,450
it's on that individual.
I'm smart enough.

1396
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:43,343
You're smart enough.
Common Sense tells you that that's a 

1397
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:48,240
movie they're not really like that.
You know?

1398
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:49,074
How can people be that disconnected to 
think that's actually how animals live 

1399
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,900
that life.
It's just a frigging movie.

1400
01:02:55,350 --> 01:02:58,290
People that just,
I don't think they really think that,

1401
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,960
but they're not exposed to the harsh 
reality of it.

1402
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:03,360
Like they,
I don't think they really think that the

1403
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:04,194
bears talk to each other and English and
then they hug each other and they help 

1404
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:07,980
people.
But,

1405
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:08,963
but the reality of seeing bears in 
Klondike bar commercials and Coca Cola 

1406
01:03:12,751 --> 01:03:14,760
ads,
that does fuck with your head,

1407
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:20,060
it does plants the seeds of what a 
rinella calls.

1408
01:03:20,611 --> 01:03:21,510
Uh,
what does it call it?

1409
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,080
A charismatic megafauna.
These things become,

1410
01:03:25,081 --> 01:03:26,240
they become your friends,
your,

1411
01:03:26,241 --> 01:03:28,850
your long lost wilderness friends that,
man,

1412
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,690
I'll get a cat,
I'll get a dog at home.

1413
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:32,060
I love them.
Like,

1414
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,310
cool.
But at the end of the day,

1415
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,940
now it's an animal and it's not a 
senseless senseless.

1416
01:03:35,941 --> 01:03:36,774
Why assign it?
Because I believe hunters or hunters 

1417
01:03:39,691 --> 01:03:40,524
that augment the most compassionate 
people that you'll ever meet because if 

1418
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,690
it is a hard thing to take an animal's 
life.

1419
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:48,240
But I know it's part of the process,
you know?

1420
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:50,680
Um,
it's not like I'm just thought,

1421
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,050
let's just go and kill an elk got 
killed.

1422
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:57,150
I'm totally not that hunter at all life.
Nothing turns me off more.

1423
01:03:57,180 --> 01:03:59,970
I'm not that sort of person.
I'll have a quiet time with that.

1424
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,290
You know,
the animal.

1425
01:04:01,291 --> 01:04:04,740
I'll put my hand on it and everything 
and just be thankful.

1426
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:08,250
I know it's an animal.
I know the meat's going to be used.

1427
01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:11,880
I know I'm doing the right thing,
but it's still.

1428
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,890
That's the human emotion part of it,
you know,

1429
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,300
and that's what,
in a sense,

1430
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:17,640
that's why I got upset when I killed 
that bull elk.

1431
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:18,400
You know,
it,

1432
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,100
it,
it is a beautiful creature.

1433
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,023
I understand.
That's definitely a beautiful creature 

1434
01:04:22,381 --> 01:04:26,160
and it's a hard thing to do,
but that's the food chain.

1435
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:28,230
Well,
it's also very sustainable.

1436
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:31,350
And what's interesting is what you're 
doing is you're dipping your,

1437
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:33,450
your body,
your mind,

1438
01:04:33,451 --> 01:04:34,284
your feet into the wild world.
That elk is going to get eaten by 

1439
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:37,674
something.
Yeah.

1440
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,513
If it's not you,
it's going to get eaten by that bear 

1441
01:04:39,631 --> 01:04:42,410
that was sleeping on the carcass or 
nothing goes to waste of.

1442
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:45,210
I completely understand that after 
hunting,

1443
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:46,513
after getting so far in the hunting,
I completely understand that nothing 

1444
01:04:48,691 --> 01:04:50,010
goes to waste.
Nothing ever.

1445
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:50,993
If an animal breaks his leg,
it's something's going to take care of 

1446
01:04:53,101 --> 01:04:53,860
that.
Exactly.

1447
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:54,481
Yeah.
Yeah.

1448
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:55,314
It's just all part of the cycle.
It's all part of the big picture of the 

1449
01:04:57,151 --> 01:04:58,410
world.
The biggest,

1450
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,020
the biggest creature on the world is the
world itself.

1451
01:05:02,021 --> 01:05:07,021
If phase off everything us the way or 
even part part of the world's Pri.

1452
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,090
Yeah,
and in a way,

1453
01:05:09,091 --> 01:05:09,924
yeah,
definitely becomes this super complex 

1454
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:15,930
system that has everything in place.
It's got a system to dissolve bodies and

1455
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,370
the bacteria dissolves what the animals

1456
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,203
don't eat and there's just this really 
complex pattern that's in place that's 

1457
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:24,424
been in place forever and what you're 
doing as a hunter is is going into it 

1458
01:05:28,061 --> 01:05:32,800
and becoming for a brief week or so,
you're becoming a part of that system or

1459
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,673
that's how you acquire your or a month 
for you and you're acquiring your food 

1460
01:05:37,241 --> 01:05:38,074
that way,
which I obviously and you obviously 

1461
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:41,314
think is way better than going to a 
fucking monster and hiring some 

1462
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:48,160
supermarket hitman to do the work for 
you and feeling that your guilt free.

1463
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,010
I worked at Abbott was for some time.
What is that?

1464
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,400
A abetour is like a slaughterhouse.
Oh,

1465
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:56,830
Aba in Australia.
You ever heard of that?

1466
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,210
I think it's might be an Australia is a 
very secluded here in America.

1467
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:03,490
Will have just know that.
Yeah,

1468
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,833
we wouldn't know.
We don't know too much about you other 

1469
01:06:06,071 --> 01:06:08,670
than like Crocodile Dundee,
crazy.

1470
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:09,763
A land down under.
Sometimes I'll use a signing or say 

1471
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:13,570
something unlucky.
You understand that word or not?

1472
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:17,970
How about tool waterhouse?
So is that normal?

1473
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:19,540
Spanish,
central,

1474
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:21,310
Spanish,
central.

1475
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,770
Stria bitch.
Spanish speakers.

1476
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:25,720
Is it a Spanish word?
Must Be.

1477
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:27,520
Huh?
Interesting word.

1478
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:32,380
I'll just start cooling the 
slaughterhouse and so 7,000

1479
01:06:32,381 --> 01:06:37,080
shape would go past on a chain and I 
just had the one job to do and and,

1480
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:40,080
and they'd be 700 people.
You're making a slash,

1481
01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:41,330
is that what you did?
Yeah,

1482
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:42,173
just cut their throats.
They would be 700 other workers just on 

1483
01:06:46,001 --> 01:06:46,834
the slaughter floor pot.
So that meet with passing 700 people's 

1484
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:54,640
hands.
Males the whole lot for A.

1485
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,473
I'm not saying there's nothing wrong 
with this because the population of the 

1486
01:06:57,131 --> 01:06:59,470
world demands that not everyone can hunt
now,

1487
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:01,900
so I don't have an issue with slaughter 
houses or anything like that,

1488
01:07:01,901 --> 01:07:06,220
but I'm saying that might goes through a
wide different process.

1489
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,593
I'd have to say for a better word.
Brutal process where those animals get 

1490
01:07:14,111 --> 01:07:16,320
hurt on to a,
uh,

1491
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:17,980
like a truck,
like a semi trailer,

1492
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:19,523
uh,
driven to the lord has putting small 

1493
01:07:20,591 --> 01:07:25,080
yards pushed through a gate to go past 
all those people's hands that,

1494
01:07:25,081 --> 01:07:25,570
uh,
that uh,

1495
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,403
cutting the meat.
That's before it even gets to the point 

1496
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:29,950
where it's going to get cut off for 
packaging.

1497
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:31,833
And then obviously it gets sent out to 
different grocery stores and then sold 

1498
01:07:35,441 --> 01:07:37,900
from there.
My mate passes these hands here.

1499
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,770
That's it.
That's the only made the deposit.

1500
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:41,663
I'll get to inspect every single animal 
in its natural form because on the one 

1501
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:48,130
that kills it isn't strange that that's 
the norm.

1502
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,033
The norm is a slaughterhouse and that's 
only been around for a couple hundred 

1503
01:07:51,551 --> 01:07:53,860
years for that.
Everybody did it.

1504
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,000
The hardware.
Exactly.

1505
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:56,200
Yeah.
Yeah.

1506
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,800
But yet we seem to be.

1507
01:07:58,810 --> 01:07:59,643
The outside is for doing it like that 
and it's like this is so much more 

1508
01:08:02,321 --> 01:08:04,660
natural.
This is friggin beautiful.

1509
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,673
That the process is actually beautiful.
Once you get the knowledge and you look 

1510
01:08:08,051 --> 01:08:10,310
at it that everyone thinks,
oh,

1511
01:08:10,311 --> 01:08:11,144
you had to get an animal.
She didn't have clean of these together 

1512
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:16,250
an animal like it's clean.
It's not a messy job at all.

1513
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:17,640
Um,
and,

1514
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,330
and there's no,
like I've got to block my nose.

1515
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:22,820
I don't want to smell them.
There's no smell,

1516
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:23,713
there's nothing.
This is clean meat and that's what I'm 

1517
01:08:25,191 --> 01:08:26,024
saying.
The blood on my hands at that point is 

1518
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:28,244
clean.
Wouldn't bother me to eat a chocolate 

1519
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,790
bar and lick my fingers after

1520
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:32,700
you can.
Maybe you can eat the meat completely.

1521
01:08:32,830 --> 01:08:34,780
Exactly.
Ready to me a predator.

1522
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:35,614
I mean,
the only thing you have to worry about 

1523
01:08:36,311 --> 01:08:39,430
is if you eat a pig or if you eat a 
mountain lion or something like that.

1524
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:41,830
You gotta worry about trick analysis.
We don't even have that at home.

1525
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:42,880
You don't have to else?
Nope.

1526
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,840
And so you can eat your piggery rare.

1527
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,530
Uh,
you could,

1528
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,423
you definitely could.
That's so come here and they cook Bacon 

1529
01:08:51,221 --> 01:08:54,760
and it's like crusty bit of cardboard.
I'm sure you do the same.

1530
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:56,140
Well,
I didn't know that.

1531
01:08:56,141 --> 01:08:56,974
So I cook them some bike and for our 
friends that we stayed with Ed and K 

1532
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,640
Westbrook there on that bear hunt with 
us it nk and um,

1533
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:04,803
I'm used to just having my bike and like
slightly cooked so I just slightly 

1534
01:09:07,181 --> 01:09:09,340
cooked it and put it on the plate.
I had on my bacon,

1535
01:09:09,341 --> 01:09:10,660
they didn't eat their bike and I'm like,
oh,

1536
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,270
they mustn't be big bacon.
He does.

1537
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:15,460
And then after the fact that I've eaten 
my bacon,

1538
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:17,320
thanks Kay.
She's like,

1539
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,440
yeah,
we really liked to cook your bacon.

1540
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:20,920
Well because a trick and hostess and I'm
like,

1541
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:23,560
what the fuck?
Like you let me know.

1542
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:27,670
Was it much less of a concern with 
domestic pig?

1543
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:29,043
Yeah.
They actually lowered the temperature 

1544
01:09:30,981 --> 01:09:34,610
that you're supposed to kill a or cook 
rather a domestic pork.

1545
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,130
Yeah.
He used to be 165 degrees,

1546
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,570
which is what they recommend you cook 
them.

1547
01:09:38,571 --> 01:09:41,160
Bear at and now it's 140.
Yeah.

1548
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,860
So you're okay.
I'm okay.

1549
01:09:42,861 --> 01:09:44,390
I should be cool.
They don't want to ever get out.

1550
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:45,693
I mean,
unless something gets to them the way 

1551
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,920
you get tricky gnosis by eating 
something with trichinosis,

1552
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:53,870
the horrific nature of pig farming of 
domestic,

1553
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,480
the way they raise it,
these factory farms,

1554
01:09:56,481 --> 01:09:57,620
it's,
it's horrible.

1555
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,083
I mean,
it really makes you never want to eat 

1556
01:09:59,661 --> 01:10:01,850
pork again.
It's definitely really disgusting.

1557
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,760
Yeah,
I could.

1558
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:06,450
I'm just happy fill in my freezer with.
We've naturally harvest mate.

1559
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,110
One hundred percent key.
Make the kids eat it.

1560
01:10:09,170 --> 01:10:09,740
They all love it.

1561
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,573
But isn't it interesting that what you 
said earlier that everybody can't do 

1562
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:13,364
that?

1563
01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:15,210
Not do it.
It's bizarre.

1564
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:16,343
It is bizarre.
It's because of what we're talking 

1565
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:18,160
about.
Everyone's,

1566
01:10:18,160 --> 01:10:20,260
you know,
you've got to have this job,

1567
01:10:20,261 --> 01:10:21,670
you've got to make good money.
You know,

1568
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:25,270
you need to be successful in that type 
of life.

1569
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,890
You know,
that that's the big push.

1570
01:10:26,891 --> 01:10:28,300
But,
but I'm always like,

1571
01:10:28,301 --> 01:10:30,790
no,
you really need to be successful in this

1572
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:33,790
type of life,
which is the outdoors experience,

1573
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:34,624
you know,
like,

1574
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:36,440
um,
uh,

1575
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:40,870
before it ever been a good father.
Like that's the sort of the worksheet or

1576
01:10:40,871 --> 01:10:42,040
whatever.
Who gives a shit?

1577
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:42,874
Leave your job the more if you have to 
go and do something that you enjoy in 

1578
01:10:45,551 --> 01:10:46,384
life,
right,

1579
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:47,793
that's the end story because you're not 
going to get to your death bed and be 

1580
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:50,141
like,
oh,

1581
01:10:50,141 --> 01:10:53,230
I really wish I pushed and got that 
better position at work or whatever.

1582
01:10:53,530 --> 01:10:55,120
You're never going to do that.
You'll.

1583
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:59,140
You'll always be like,
I wish I did more for my kids,

1584
01:10:59,141 --> 01:11:01,960
or I wish I went and climbed frigging 
Everest or whatever it is.

1585
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,823
That's what it's going to be,
but we don't get caught up in this trap 

1586
01:11:04,751 --> 01:11:08,650
is now I've got to have the newest car,
the the nicest house.

1587
01:11:08,651 --> 01:11:12,190
We need to live in this suburb.
I need to be the CEO at work.

1588
01:11:12,191 --> 01:11:13,410
I need to do that sort thing.

1589
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:17,290
Well,
I think we're set up with this desire in

1590
01:11:17,291 --> 01:11:20,500
our heads to attain things that we think
are difficult to attain.

1591
01:11:20,501 --> 01:11:21,334
That we see.
Like we see a shiny car and we see a 

1592
01:11:23,411 --> 01:11:25,780
beautiful house.
We see it all the,

1593
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:28,090
all the different trappings of modern 
society.

1594
01:11:28,091 --> 01:11:28,924
We see those things in there.
They're very appealing to us and they 

1595
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:36,300
seem to be like goal posts of success 
and then if we can reach those things,

1596
01:11:36,761 --> 01:11:40,540
maybe we'll we'll reach more happiness 
or we'll feel better about ourselves.

1597
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:41,673
We'll have some status that that we can 
brag about and you chase that stuff 

1598
01:11:44,950 --> 01:11:45,960
until your hearts out track.

1599
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:47,910
Yeah,
I do the same thing.

1600
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:49,230
Don't,
don't get me wrong.

1601
01:11:49,231 --> 01:11:52,110
I'll say advertisement for a car or 
something like that and be like,

1602
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:52,963
I really liked that car,
but then it's another party minute 

1603
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,790
clinics and go,
you don't need that frigging car.

1604
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:59,910
Why do you want that car?
That car means you got to work longer or

1605
01:11:59,911 --> 01:12:03,030
work more or something else to maintain 
or something like that.

1606
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,580
Or you want to go in and get that car 
scratched in the bush.

1607
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:07,230
That's another thing.
You know?

1608
01:12:07,231 --> 01:12:07,741
I'm like,
no,

1609
01:12:07,741 --> 01:12:10,200
I've already got a car.
Just be happy with what you've got.

1610
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:11,100
You're,
you're an idiot.

1611
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:12,930
If you go and chase that,
you're an idiot.

1612
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:15,060
Just be happy with what you've got.
Life's good.

1613
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,940
More out time,
more outdoor experience.

1614
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:19,950
More time.
If your kids more time for your wife,

1615
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:21,390
whatever.
In that sense,

1616
01:12:21,391 --> 01:12:23,340
you know,
and it's,

1617
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:27,180
it's that said that that's the whole 
modern society thing.

1618
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:31,620
So indigenous Australia,
not all of indigenous Australia,

1619
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:35,400
most of indigenous Australia because 
it's so young to our culture,

1620
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,650
you know,
because Australia was only discovered in

1621
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:40,740
maybe jamie can look it up because I 
don't know exact date,

1622
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:42,930
I probably should.
Um,

1623
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:44,220
they,
they,

1624
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:47,490
indigenous Australia don't seem to have 
that desire.

1625
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:50,460
They just happy with what they've got 
and it's something to be,

1626
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:53,070
it's something to be envious of that,
that,

1627
01:12:53,090 --> 01:12:53,923
that they're just happy with that,
that they're not going to waste their 

1628
01:12:55,591 --> 01:12:58,290
life going and chasing silly things,
you know?

1629
01:12:58,370 --> 01:12:58,971
Yeah.
Well,

1630
01:12:58,971 --> 01:13:01,310
at the end of the day,
those things that you're chasing,

1631
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:03,540
you can't take them with you.
That's right.

1632
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:06,050
And even if you leave them behind for 
your family,

1633
01:13:06,051 --> 01:13:06,570
I mean,
they're,

1634
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,540
they're only going to enjoy them until 
they stop living,

1635
01:13:08,860 --> 01:13:10,250
but will,
will.

1636
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:14,600
It's like the masterpieces enjoying your
life to the utmost and having the most,

1637
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,290
the most success with your family,
with your friends,

1638
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:20,120
the most relationship,
success,

1639
01:13:20,121 --> 01:13:22,970
the most harmony with the people that 
you come in contact with.

1640
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:24,253
But that doesn't seem to be rewarded the
same way in our world as someone who's 

1641
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:31,680
got some ball or house,
I fucking helicopter picks him out,

1642
01:13:31,681 --> 01:13:34,330
but he's got golden underwear and.
But that fight.

1643
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:35,713
Yeah,
it does.

1644
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:36,973
They can have that.
I can have that helicopter and I 

1645
01:13:38,211 --> 01:13:40,520
guarantee that it fades and they want 
something new.

1646
01:13:40,521 --> 01:13:41,354
There's something.
There's something new that you're 

1647
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:43,064
desiring past that.
What I've tried to train myself to 

1648
01:13:46,041 --> 01:13:46,874
design and what I do desire now is 
experiences like worldly experiences 

1649
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,940
coming to coming to America for the 
month.

1650
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:54,193
Man,
I'd sell my if it meant to have to sell 

1651
01:13:55,521 --> 01:13:56,354
the house that I'm in Kingwood kill me.
So I wouldn't know if I had to sell my 

1652
01:14:01,461 --> 01:14:04,700
car to come to America,
America for a month,

1653
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:09,760
I'd do it,
drop it 100 percent because the it's.

1654
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:11,173
And it's not even the stories that I'll 
tell you or cam or or Antonio or one of 

1655
01:14:14,441 --> 01:14:17,050
my friends back home.
It's not even those stories.

1656
01:14:17,051 --> 01:14:20,350
It's the stories within myself and the 
experience within myself.

1657
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:21,273
That's where the real value is.
That's the real currency of this world 

1658
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:29,680
is what's inside me right now and how I 
feel after doing this trip and this trip

1659
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:31,600
was miserable.
I won't lie to you,

1660
01:14:31,890 --> 01:14:33,790
but it's an enjoyable,
miserable.

1661
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:37,630
How do you work that shit out?
How could been in the snow?

1662
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:41,340
Being wet,
flogging myself out for 16,

1663
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,040
17 hours every day into the dark of 
night and getting back into the camp.

1664
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,860
Been miserable.
How could that be enjoyable?

1665
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:49,690
Because the second you get back to camp,
you're like,

1666
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,190
oh,
a fire.

1667
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:54,910
That's awesome.
Second you lay down yet I'm just like,

1668
01:14:54,911 --> 01:14:56,340
ah,
it's so good to lay down.

1669
01:14:56,350 --> 01:15:00,040
It's like you've got to go through 
hardship to find the good shit in life.

1670
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:01,313
I went through this a five days on 
Prince of Wales island with Rinella and 

1671
01:15:04,891 --> 01:15:07,110
my friend Brian Callahan and it was 
raining every day.

1672
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:10,340
It's just pouring rain everyday.
The hunt was unsuccessful,

1673
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:12,600
unsuccessful to.
We didn't get a deer,

1674
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:15,240
but we came back and I was so happy.
It was like,

1675
01:15:15,241 --> 01:15:17,880
the sun is so warm.
It's so nice.

1676
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:19,070
There's no rain and I've,
I've,

1677
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:21,540
I this the same as it is today,
which is beautiful.

1678
01:15:21,541 --> 01:15:22,374
I mean it was beautiful today,
but I didn't really appreciate it the 

1679
01:15:24,241 --> 01:15:26,880
way I appreciated it when I came back 
from Prince of Wales.

1680
01:15:26,910 --> 01:15:27,631
Yeah,
definitely.

1681
01:15:27,631 --> 01:15:28,464
Yeah.
I really do believe that you have to go 

1682
01:15:30,031 --> 01:15:33,270
through some difficulty to appreciate 
good stuff.

1683
01:15:33,271 --> 01:15:34,104
Like if you're born into like a super 
wealthy multibillionaire family and 

1684
01:15:38,881 --> 01:15:41,250
you've got a Ferrari when you're 16 and 
you know,

1685
01:15:41,251 --> 01:15:42,084
you drive around,
fly around everywhere in private jets 

1686
01:15:43,831 --> 01:15:44,664
and you live in a giant mansion.
I just don't think that you can ever 

1687
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:51,250
appreciate.
Definitely not the difficulty I work for

1688
01:15:51,430 --> 01:15:52,960
what I've got today,
you know,

1689
01:15:52,961 --> 01:15:56,080
and then like I had a hard upbringing 
and stuff like that.

1690
01:15:56,410 --> 01:15:58,240
My father was abusive,
alcoholic,

1691
01:15:58,680 --> 01:15:59,513
lived on the streets for some time and I
really believe that put me where I am 

1692
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:07,110
with my family.
I absolutely adore my family.

1693
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:08,950
Do anything for my wife and kids,
anything.

1694
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,990
Cut My arms off and sell them if I had 
to.

1695
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:15,310
That's because of the hardship that I 
had when I was growing up and,

1696
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:16,293
and lot my business is very successful 
today and I believe that's because I 

1697
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:20,950
didn't have anything growing up as a 
kid.

1698
01:16:21,460 --> 01:16:22,810
We Will Paul.
We will.

1699
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:24,500
Very Paul,
you know,

1700
01:16:24,510 --> 01:16:25,510
we,
we had nothing.

1701
01:16:25,511 --> 01:16:26,344
We didn't,
we didn't do christmases because there 

1702
01:16:28,421 --> 01:16:29,254
was no money to do Christmas and coming 
from a broken family like that to now 

1703
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:35,103
have mine family that I don't know how 
to treat them right because of how we 

1704
01:16:39,191 --> 01:16:41,680
will treat it so wrong as kids and how 
my mother was treated.

1705
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:46,090
I know how to treat Kim or it's how 
unproven that,

1706
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,170
that shit don't fly in my house.
This is how it actually is.

1707
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:51,480
You know,
you love your family to death.

1708
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:52,314
You do absolutely anything for them.
And the biggest thing that I'm proud of 

1709
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:58,320
in life is having the family that I've 
got today.

1710
01:16:58,380 --> 01:16:59,720
You know,
like bowhunting aside,

1711
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,300
I'd man,
I'd dropped bow hunting.

1712
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:05,440
You know how much I love bow hunting.
I'll drop balancing for my family.

1713
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,050
Well,
I'm not going to do it it.

1714
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:08,960
Kim's listening.
Luckily,

1715
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:10,820
don't have to,
but yeah,

1716
01:17:10,821 --> 01:17:13,460
that is an interesting thing how people 
come from.

1717
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,330
A lot of folks that come from abusive,
alcoholic families,

1718
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,340
they wind up being like really 
considerate.

1719
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:26,380
It really compassionate and really 
dedicated to keeping on the straight and

1720
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:27,400
narrow.
You know,

1721
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:31,310
my friend Maurice,
he grew up with an alcoholic grandmother

1722
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:32,144
who raised him and they used to uh,
the ladies to lock them in a room and 

1723
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:37,364
just leave them there.
Why they would go out drinking and he 

1724
01:17:39,111 --> 01:17:41,900
couldn't get out of the room is no food.
He was always hungry and never,

1725
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:43,280
never drank in his whole life.

1726
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:44,173
I'm a nondrinker and it's just because 
of how I say my house St my father was 

1727
01:17:47,961 --> 01:17:48,794
drinking.
I believe I wouldn't be like that 

1728
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:53,840
drinking because I'm just like,
I care about the person on the street.

1729
01:17:53,841 --> 01:17:56,510
I don't even know that's the,
that's the sort of person that I am.

1730
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:58,980
So I don't believe I would be,
um,

1731
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,133
the violent drunk that my father was,
but it's something I don't want to even 

1732
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,094
promote to my kids.
I don't even want to promote it to me 

1733
01:18:05,541 --> 01:18:06,374
friends.
So all my drink and I don't need to 

1734
01:18:08,091 --> 01:18:09,530
drink.
I'm silly enough as you can tell.

1735
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:12,430
Yeah.
I've seen that many times,

1736
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:13,264
man.
People who grew up in that sort of 

1737
01:18:14,711 --> 01:18:15,544
abusive substance abusing family,
they grow up and they're clean as a 

1738
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,520
whistle and they don't have nothing to 
do with it.

1739
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:23,150
It makes total sense.
Yeah.

1740
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:24,370
Tangier off it.
Yeah.

1741
01:18:24,371 --> 01:18:25,840
It's interesting how that works,
man.

1742
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:30,550
Sometimes you have to see someone just 
fucking completely ruining their life in

1743
01:18:30,551 --> 01:18:33,040
order for you to get it in your head.
Well that is not me.

1744
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,943
I just,
I seen all the negatives in it and then 

1745
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:38,360
I was like,
I don't want any negatives in my life at

1746
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:40,040
all.
Like I'll do anything to avoid them,

1747
01:18:40,041 --> 01:18:40,874
you know,
and that's why I keep on the straight 

1748
01:18:41,601 --> 01:18:45,220
and narrow and try and be a real 
positive person is um,

1749
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,330
I just,
I just don't want any,

1750
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,343
anything negative like that in my life.
And I've seen alcohol as being a 

1751
01:18:51,171 --> 01:18:54,470
negative burrito because people do stuff
that they,

1752
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,650
they,
they usually wouldn't 100 percent,

1753
01:18:57,710 --> 01:18:59,530
but at the same time,
um,

1754
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:01,663
I can be at work or something.
And the guys are drinking and having a 

1755
01:19:03,531 --> 01:19:04,364
good time and there's no issue at all.
She had all stay up all night with them 

1756
01:19:06,561 --> 01:19:07,690
having a good laugh.
I,

1757
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:10,970
I just don't need it to have fun anymore
because I've never had it.

1758
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:12,680
And,
and,

1759
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,230
and obviously,
you know,

1760
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:16,220
have been turned off it as a,
as a young bloke.

1761
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,200
Yeah.
I mean it's not necessary.

1762
01:19:18,201 --> 01:19:20,480
I mean it's a social lubricant and end.
I,

1763
01:19:20,481 --> 01:19:23,630
I enjoy it,
but I didn't grow up in an alcoholic

1764
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:24,553
environment.
I grew up in a violent environment and 

1765
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,170
so,
you know,

1766
01:19:27,171 --> 01:19:28,004
domestic violence to me is a very scary 
thing and I couldn't imagine ever 

1767
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,290
hitting my wife or hitting my kids are 
hitting

1768
01:19:36,690 --> 01:19:38,120
just,
I can't,

1769
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:40,100
you know,
it was like,

1770
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:40,934
it was so stressful growing up as a kid 
that I think that's why I've tried to 

1771
01:19:44,001 --> 01:19:47,120
live my life without any stress now.
And having a business.

1772
01:19:47,210 --> 01:19:49,340
My own business can be stressful,
but I've,

1773
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:50,413
I've tried to grow up without having any
stress and just to have a figure like 

1774
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:57,164
that in your life growing up as kids.
I've got two sisters as well that were 

1775
01:19:59,481 --> 01:20:01,520
obviously affected by,
by it as well.

1776
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,630
Um,
it's a little bit like feeding your kids

1777
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,740
the wrong vegetables and not feeding 
them life,

1778
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,880
but for mental health,
you know,

1779
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:13,810
domestic violence is so ruining in that 
sense that,

1780
01:20:13,940 --> 01:20:16,800
that it just destroys mental health.
I've had,

1781
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:17,693
I've used it as fuel myself,
but I know a lot of people don't and it 

1782
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:24,150
actually affects them as they get older.
It affects them more and more.

1783
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:25,703
It doesn't,
it also affects if you see violence too 

1784
01:20:27,871 --> 01:20:29,040
often in the car.
And by the way,

1785
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:29,874
I should really expand on this.
Like the violence that I saw was 

1786
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:35,400
nothing.
It means,

1787
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:36,263
you know,
my dad hit my mom a few times xeno he 

1788
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:40,470
smacked her around.
I saw him hit some other people do.

1789
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:41,260
He's just,

1790
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:42,230
that's alright.
Yeah,

1791
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:42,930
that's,
that's an,

1792
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:43,550
that's enough.

1793
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:44,383
That's bad.
But it's not violence in comparison to 

1794
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:47,584
say he never hit me.
I've seen many people who've lived way 

1795
01:20:51,071 --> 01:20:54,340
more violent upbringing way,
way worse than what I've seen,

1796
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:59,790
but one of the things that happens to 
young people when they see violence on a

1797
01:21:00,011 --> 01:21:05,011
regular basis is your brain gets 
programmed to accept,

1798
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:06,123
not just accept that,
but to be wary of that and to be ready 

1799
01:21:09,161 --> 01:21:12,700
to respond to that.
And so you develop a much quicker temper

1800
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:16,090
and your,
the consequences of being in a dangerous

1801
01:21:16,091 --> 01:21:16,924
situation become much more real and 
you're much more likely to act in a 

1802
01:21:20,441 --> 01:21:22,600
violent way.
And when children see violence,

1803
01:21:22,601 --> 01:21:25,780
you see people getting hit and they see 
that kind of shit on a regular basis.

1804
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:27,820
The norm,
it becomes normal.

1805
01:21:27,821 --> 01:21:29,950
It becomes an option,
you know?

1806
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:33,910
And it's uh,
it's just like programming.

1807
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:34,571
I mean,
you know,

1808
01:21:34,571 --> 01:21:35,620
you have,
you have children,

1809
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,920
like when you raise a kid like they're 
so fast.

1810
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:39,783
It's so fascinating to watch kids learn 
and grow and you see what they respond 

1811
01:21:43,151 --> 01:21:43,984
to and you see like when you,
when you can talk to them and get them 

1812
01:21:47,951 --> 01:21:52,210
alone and have fun with them and respond
and rationalize with them.

1813
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:54,220
Like I try to talk to my kids,
like they're adults.

1814
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:56,050
I talked to them like they're little 
kids,

1815
01:21:56,051 --> 01:21:57,630
like I give them a lot of love and a lot
of.

1816
01:21:57,640 --> 01:22:01,470
But I try to explain things like they're
really smart and uh,

1817
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:04,480
probably I really like that my kids are 
like that.

1818
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:04,900
Well,
they,

1819
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:05,733
they get it kind of and,
but they keep asking questions and we 

1820
01:22:08,021 --> 01:22:09,020
work it out,
you know,

1821
01:22:09,021 --> 01:22:09,880
well,
what does that mean?

1822
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:10,510
Well,
what,

1823
01:22:10,510 --> 01:22:14,050
you know,
we've had conversations about what to do

1824
01:22:14,051 --> 01:22:16,140
if someone's being mean to you.
Like my daughter was like,

1825
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,120
someone's being mean to me at school.
I go,

1826
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,480
how are they being mean to.
She was like,

1827
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:21,550
well,
they said something mean about my hair.

1828
01:22:21,551 --> 01:22:22,390
I mean,
I go,

1829
01:22:22,391 --> 01:22:23,590
well,
do you like your hair?

1830
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:24,461
And she's like,
yeah,

1831
01:22:24,461 --> 01:22:25,121
I like your hair.
I go,

1832
01:22:25,121 --> 01:22:27,480
do you think they really think there's 
something wrong with your haircut?

1833
01:22:27,610 --> 01:22:29,770
Or they try to make you feel bad.
She goes,

1834
01:22:29,771 --> 01:22:31,090
I just think they're mean.
I go,

1835
01:22:31,091 --> 01:22:33,160
well,
it probably trying to make you feel bad.

1836
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:33,994
Right?
And so why do you think they're trying 

1837
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:35,314
to make you feel bad?
While a lot of it is because when kids 

1838
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:37,864
are little,
they realized that they can affect 

1839
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:40,720
someone and they don't.

1840
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:41,553
Maybe they don't even understand that 
it's going to have a really bad feeling 

1841
01:22:43,811 --> 01:22:44,620
on you,
but they,

1842
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:48,130
it's like a toy that they can play with.
Like they can say something mean and you

1843
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:48,964
react and they realize it and this is 
something that people have to get 

1844
01:22:51,581 --> 01:22:52,540
through.
I go,

1845
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:53,374
what you should do is realize that how 
that makes you feel and decide you're 

1846
01:22:56,951 --> 01:22:57,784
never going to do that to somebody else,
especially not someone who's your 

1847
01:22:59,171 --> 01:23:00,004
friend.
And so we have these like long 

1848
01:23:01,031 --> 01:23:03,550
conversations about feeling about 
communication.

1849
01:23:03,970 --> 01:23:08,170
And then I explained to her always that 
whenever I tell my kid about something,

1850
01:23:08,171 --> 01:23:10,090
I always say,
whatever you've done,

1851
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,220
I've done it worse and I'm dumber than 
you.

1852
01:23:12,890 --> 01:23:15,070
For sure when I was your age because 
she's very well.

1853
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:19,720
Especially my eight year old who is a,
she's the middle child,

1854
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:20,554
but she's,
um,

1855
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,320
she's a,
she's very curious and very,

1856
01:23:23,321 --> 01:23:25,300
uh,
very interested in progress.

1857
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,680
Like we talk about things like getting 
smarter or what you were.

1858
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:31,840
One of the things I always say is I go,
you're way smarter than I was when I was

1859
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:32,471
eight,
when I was eight.

1860
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:34,840
I was really dumb and I did a lot of 
stupid things,

1861
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:37,750
but also it was a boy and I think it was
a little more reckless and impulsive and

1862
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:39,460
a little crazier,
but I'm like,

1863
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,930
uh,
so anything you've done,

1864
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:41,793
like if you don't tell the truth about 
something or if you blame somebody else 

1865
01:23:44,051 --> 01:23:45,610
for something that you did.
I did it all.

1866
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:49,720
I did all those things so I'm not mad at
you like it obviously worked out for me.

1867
01:23:49,721 --> 01:23:50,650
I'm here,
I'm alive,

1868
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:53,080
I'm healthy and have you so it's going 
to be okay.

1869
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:56,590
So no one's going to not love you if you
make a mistake.

1870
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:58,330
It's totally a part of being a person.

1871
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,970
There's no way to navigate this life 
without making mistakes.

1872
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,580
So by having those kinds of 
conversations with them,

1873
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:04,414
I think I alleviate at least some of the
anxiety because kids are always worried 

1874
01:24:08,441 --> 01:24:11,380
about how you feel about what they've 
done.

1875
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,000
Like they don't want you to be upset at 
them.

1876
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:15,670
They don't want you to be,
and I always like because even if you do

1877
01:24:15,671 --> 01:24:17,440
something bad,
like I still love you,

1878
01:24:17,460 --> 01:24:21,700
so that's part of life.
I fucked up still as an adult,

1879
01:24:21,701 --> 01:24:22,534
as a 49 year old man.
I still make stupid fucking mistakes in 

1880
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:26,320
the end.
It doesn't even matter.

1881
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,730
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

1882
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,310
It's just shit.
You can get past.

1883
01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:30,470
It's all good.
Yeah.

1884
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:31,900
So good.
Chill out people.

1885
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,510
Exactly.
But it's hard to.

1886
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:34,421
Well,
you know what,

1887
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:37,870
that's another thing that being in the 
woods and being in the wild,

1888
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:39,093
like when you see a fucking 11 foot tall
grizzly bear sleeping on an elk carcass 

1889
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:43,840
and you're by yourself.

1890
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,333
Boy does like insults about a haircut 
was getting mad at each other on the 

1891
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:54,250
playground.
He was so fucking stupid.

1892
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:55,600
Like,
look at this thing.

1893
01:24:55,601 --> 01:24:57,180
This thing is could hate me.
Yeah.

1894
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,840
Yeah.
Isn't that funny?

1895
01:24:58,990 --> 01:25:00,790
It is funny.
I think I mean again,

1896
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:01,624
like you were saying about how being in 
the woods and then coming back here 

1897
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:03,740
like,
wow,

1898
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:06,010
I could just hit a switch and I could.
I think,

1899
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,950
you know,
having that perspective and being out in

1900
01:25:08,951 --> 01:25:09,784
the wild,
he does.

1901
01:25:09,790 --> 01:25:10,623
It's an one more thing that gives you 
this sort of a greater picture of how 

1902
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:19,360
bizarre and amazing life really is.
You have this thing.

1903
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,950
No use crying.
I was built milk.

1904
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:21,640
Yeah.
Yeah,

1905
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:23,050
we have that.
I think we invented it.

1906
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:26,540
I think you guys bought it.
I think we invented the lower wifi.

1907
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,513
You guys invented Wifi?
I can't believe that one guy's probably 

1908
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:30,860
American ex.

1909
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:31,703
Pat Probably went over there,
claimed Australia probably heightened 

1910
01:25:34,391 --> 01:25:35,890
for his taxes.
Well,

1911
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:36,953
like I just live by.
There's no use crying over spilled milk 

1912
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:39,813
like it's happened.
Like if there's even something 

1913
01:25:41,501 --> 01:25:42,334
stressful,
it's done now let's just deal with it 

1914
01:25:44,321 --> 01:25:46,600
because it's done now.
There's no use carrying on about it.

1915
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,123
It doesn't make anything any better than
just like let's just deal with the 

1916
01:25:50,971 --> 01:25:53,320
situation.
Let's just get beyond it.

1917
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:54,483
But it's so common to be upset about it 
and everybody else does it and it 

1918
01:25:56,681 --> 01:25:58,720
becomes a pattern.
You see it and you know.

1919
01:25:58,721 --> 01:25:59,554
I mean I'm guilty of it myself.
I've gotten upset about stupid shit 

1920
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:02,404
before too,
but sometimes just a perspective thing 

1921
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,370
and also sometimes it's a busy thing,
like sometimes you become.

1922
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,620
I mean,
I'm guilty of this.

1923
01:26:09,690 --> 01:26:12,980
I'll do,
I'll do too many things and in doing too

1924
01:26:12,981 --> 01:26:13,814
many things,
sometimes I get my stress level too 

1925
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:18,050
high,
like my base stress levels.

1926
01:26:18,051 --> 01:26:18,884
Like there's too many things I'm 
managing all at once and then I can be 

1927
01:26:21,771 --> 01:26:22,604
irritable.
Stuff that I shouldn't be irritable 

1928
01:26:24,441 --> 01:26:24,880
about.

1929
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:25,713
Kim's design.
Kim's got a little business pretty 

1930
01:26:27,411 --> 01:26:31,460
little potty and she gets so busy,
she'll get caught out with at that.

1931
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,710
She'll get to the point and she's like,
fuck,

1932
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:36,410
I've just got to slow down.
I've got to do less.

1933
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,170
I've got to do less so I can actually 
feed in more things,

1934
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:42,260
but more things that I enjoy.
And um,

1935
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:43,303
but at least she's got that outlook 
least she gets to that point and she's 

1936
01:26:45,981 --> 01:26:46,701
like,
yeah,

1937
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:48,020
okay,
I'm getting too busy,

1938
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:48,913
you know,
I'm actually losing quality time with 

1939
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:53,840
whatever in life that she enjoys.
And um,

1940
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,333
I used to be the side of the business 
because I'd put it in these crazy hours 

1941
01:26:57,411 --> 01:26:58,270
with the business.
I,

1942
01:26:58,670 --> 01:27:02,420
I practically built the business so it 
could support itself and I can walk away

1943
01:27:02,421 --> 01:27:05,960
and go bow hunting and,
but to get to that point,

1944
01:27:05,961 --> 01:27:08,630
I put in a few years of just,
I'd be out,

1945
01:27:08,780 --> 01:27:09,613
I'd be up until 1:00
in the morning and doing things for the 

1946
01:27:10,971 --> 01:27:13,280
business and trying to keep it growing.

1947
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:18,280
And then how big do you want it because 
the more shit you have in life,

1948
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:21,650
in business,
all those sorts of things,

1949
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,520
the less time you actually have in life 
to do the things that you want.

1950
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:28,190
All right.
So I got to the point and I'm like,

1951
01:27:28,191 --> 01:27:29,024
well I don't really want the business to
be any bigger than it is now unless I 

1952
01:27:32,241 --> 01:27:34,040
get into some other managers and things 
like that.

1953
01:27:34,041 --> 01:27:35,540
And it's just fine in that point.
Okay.

1954
01:27:35,541 --> 01:27:36,374
Stop.
Because you've really not enjoying life 

1955
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:39,630
anymore,
you know?

1956
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,390
Let's just roll it back a little bit.

1957
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:43,860
Yeah,
I've done that more this year.

1958
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,903
I used to do all the UFC pay per views 
and I used to do the Fox events too and 

1959
01:27:49,471 --> 01:27:52,590
I cut it back to only North American 
paper reviews.

1960
01:27:52,591 --> 01:27:56,250
No More Fox and I cut it in half so I 
can blame bow hunting.

1961
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,010
Yeah,
shit,

1962
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:01,910
I need time.
That's part of the problem I was.

1963
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:03,063
I was telling you on the way over here 
that I really think I need to do a 

1964
01:28:04,801 --> 01:28:09,450
bowhunting tv show just so I can have an
excuse to go more so I don't.

1965
01:28:09,730 --> 01:28:11,370
I listen to it.
I've got to go to work.

1966
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:14,330
Can't just an attendance dry it.
Dude.

1967
01:28:14,340 --> 01:28:15,520
You gotta to come in and hunting with 
me.

1968
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:16,890
You can only see it.
Yeah.

1969
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:19,830
You can only see it as an online in 
China,

1970
01:28:19,831 --> 01:28:21,630
but it's going to be huge.
Yeah.

1971
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:24,670
I don't know man.
This is A.

1972
01:28:24,670 --> 01:28:25,503
There's definitely a a line that you 
cross between not doing enough and then 

1973
01:28:28,831 --> 01:28:29,664
doing the right amount and then doing 
too much and knowing how to pull it 

1974
01:28:32,191 --> 01:28:34,350
back.
It's hard to pull things back though.

1975
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,880
Yeah.
Most people they.

1976
01:28:35,881 --> 01:28:38,130
They feel like if they're not moving 
forward,

1977
01:28:38,131 --> 01:28:40,620
they're moving backward.
If they're not doing more,

1978
01:28:40,621 --> 01:28:42,180
they're doing less.
Yeah.

1979
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:43,980
That's the human condition,
isn't it?

1980
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,390
Well,
it's part of this,

1981
01:28:45,391 --> 01:28:46,224
uh,
you know,

1982
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,900
go get them society.
Especially in America.

1983
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:49,943
I mean,
I don't know exactly what the attitude 

1984
01:28:51,361 --> 01:28:52,590
is over in Australia.
Is that right?

1985
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:55,530
And it's,
it's different with different people,

1986
01:28:55,531 --> 01:28:59,370
but I'll have an hour at home if it 
doesn't even have to be something I want

1987
01:28:59,371 --> 01:29:02,880
to do.
I can be doing housework on the house or

1988
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:03,714
doing something at work.
It doesn't even have to be something 

1989
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:05,934
that I actually want to do,
but if I'm not doing something for an 

1990
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,840
hour,
I am bored shitless dude.

1991
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:12,880
Like hide the knives.
I'm going to cut my wrist,

1992
01:29:13,490 --> 01:29:15,570
like bored,
bored shitless.

1993
01:29:15,571 --> 01:29:17,250
Like I need to be doing something.
And like I said,

1994
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:18,660
it doesn't even have to be something I 
want to do,

1995
01:29:18,900 --> 01:29:20,220
but I have to have something to do.

1996
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:21,273
One of the things that I realized how to
do or learned how to do over the last 

1997
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:27,820
few years,
it's going an actual vacation where I go

1998
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:28,743
and I could just sit on the beach and 
drink Margaritas and put my feet up 

1999
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:33,920
because they play with my kids.
No,

2000
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:36,870
I can't go fishing though.
Well,

2001
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:43,320
we were organizing a trip recently to 
Hawaii and I was saying I forgot all the

2002
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:45,910
NIH.
I can have access to exactly who god was

2003
01:29:45,911 --> 01:29:48,340
shine,
but the problem is I'll be up at 6:00

2004
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:49,750
in the morning.
I won't see my family.

2005
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:50,593
It's like they're at.
Oh,

2006
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:52,290
it's not.
That's not a.

2007
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:53,143
that's not a vacation your vacation.
But fishing is like fishing is easy and 

2008
01:29:56,831 --> 01:30:00,060
they liked my kids like it.
It's fun bringing,

2009
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:00,993
bringing kids to Australia to.
I'll take you out in some mad fishing 

2010
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:05,290
network.
Australia is a strange place,

2011
01:30:05,291 --> 01:30:07,810
man,
and this is one of the things I was a 16

2012
01:30:07,811 --> 01:30:09,430
hour flight away.
Well that too,

2013
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:10,353
but it's also a strange place in that 
like what they've done in America with 

2014
01:30:14,921 --> 01:30:16,970
reintroducing wolves.
What,

2015
01:30:17,050 --> 01:30:17,883
what they've done in Australia.
What I think is really bizarre is feral 

2016
01:30:21,221 --> 01:30:25,390
cats and foxes to deal with some of the.

2017
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:28,610
That's some of the shit never works to 
grow it.

2018
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:29,493
Rabbit's tail.
They brought wrap to fade one of the 

2019
01:30:30,971 --> 01:30:34,520
early colonies within Australia because 
that was for the paypal,

2020
01:30:34,521 --> 01:30:35,900
a rabbit's with paypal.
The height.

2021
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:37,060
Yeah,
that's why I brought him in.

2022
01:30:37,090 --> 01:30:39,310
Food source.
Well all the animals in Australia,

2023
01:30:39,311 --> 01:30:41,320
so particularly New Zealand,
all the game animals,

2024
01:30:41,380 --> 01:30:43,300
all of them have been introduced from 
somewhere else.

2025
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:44,070
That's,
that's great.

2026
01:30:44,070 --> 01:30:47,080
Most so.
The spaces are all gifts from royalty

2027
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,053
along the way and.
And then you've got other species that 

2028
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:51,983
weren't gifts at all.
We just brought them in because we 

2029
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:55,140
thought it was gonna benefit Australia,
but most of them,

2030
01:30:55,290 --> 01:30:57,630
if not all of them done the complete 
opposite.

2031
01:30:58,140 --> 01:31:00,300
So they grow it in the Fox to look after
the rabbit.

2032
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:01,313
Well there's so much other shit that the
fox would just prefer to eat that's 

2033
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:06,210
easier than catching a rabbit.
They just hate that and that's it.

2034
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,253
It's all.
It's like the spaces that lives in 

2035
01:31:11,161 --> 01:31:12,810
Australia,
like it's not like,

2036
01:31:12,811 --> 01:31:13,644
oh,
it's something else we want to get rid 

2037
01:31:14,911 --> 01:31:15,321
of.
No,

2038
01:31:15,321 --> 01:31:17,960
it's something else we wanted to keep 
because they're natives,

2039
01:31:17,961 --> 01:31:19,890
you know,
like ground nesting birds,

2040
01:31:20,670 --> 01:31:21,503
you name it,
and then you spend enough time out in 

2041
01:31:23,941 --> 01:31:26,940
the woods and you'll see just about the 
craziest things.

2042
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:27,774
And we've seen feral cats now because 
the birds started nes than out on lakes 

2043
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:32,970
on old trees that were growing into 
like,

2044
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:34,403
that'd be safe there right now.
The feral cats were swimming across the 

2045
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:39,810
lake at night.
We're actually seen this,

2046
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:42,480
the light swimming across the lake at 
night,

2047
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,573
climb in these birds that are nesting in
the trees out on the lake and snatching 

2048
01:31:46,831 --> 01:31:50,020
the chicks and the bird just devastating
to,

2049
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:52,070
to our population of um,
I've

2050
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:54,570
never heard of feral cat swimming and 
allies.

2051
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:55,800
He did.
Yeah.

2052
01:31:55,820 --> 01:31:58,340
So they just figured out how to do it.
I just figured out how to do it.

2053
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:02,020
Made me body threat.
They will bomb them up,

2054
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:02,590
you know,
that's,

2055
01:32:02,590 --> 01:32:05,080
that's the,
that's the is the point right there.

2056
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:09,880
That's the right thing to do is get in 
and Carlos cats out when it's to that,

2057
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:10,960
to the,
that sort of.

2058
01:32:11,080 --> 01:32:11,913
Well,
that was what I was going to bring up 

2059
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:14,560
because when I was in Australia,
you gave me some of your,

2060
01:32:14,561 --> 01:32:15,394
uh,
Australian bowhunting magazines and 

2061
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:19,630
these fucking pictures of hosing with 
cats.

2062
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,800
They've got a dead cat.
That's a proud moment for her because of

2063
01:32:23,940 --> 01:32:25,240
had devastated.
And I,

2064
01:32:25,241 --> 01:32:26,710
ah,
I understand.

2065
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:31,200
I get it the same way coyotes are here 
in the lawn and it up.

2066
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:32,650
I'm not thinking about shooting me.
Cut It home.

2067
01:32:32,651 --> 01:32:33,880
That's different.
It's a cat.

2068
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,780
It's got a collar on and it's got a bill
on and it stays at the house.

2069
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:40,630
But isn't that bizarre?
Like you love that cat.

2070
01:32:40,870 --> 01:32:44,260
Another cat.
You'll shoot dogs dingoes and you've got

2071
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:45,094
feral dogs and feral dogs that just,
that's just a domestic dog that's gone 

2072
01:32:49,211 --> 01:32:52,550
wild and they're the same.
Now we'll kill that.

2073
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:55,960
Devastating to our population of 
wildlife.

2074
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:00,080
Wombats take good.
Hit it.

2075
01:33:00,090 --> 01:33:00,923
You know,
kidneys will get harassed if sending a 

2076
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,310
kid.
No Kid,

2077
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:04,240
no kid,
no.

2078
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:06,490
What is it?
It's like a porcupine,

2079
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:07,923
but hate.
Cool.

2080
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:08,570
Whoa,
Whoa,

2081
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:13,090
it looks cool and you'll walk out there.
You have wolves.

2082
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:14,193
You don't even have.
Whoops.

2083
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:16,900
Goes,
I think I would eat a wolf hall.

2084
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:18,400
Oh,
how dare you.

2085
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:20,560
That's so not true.
How big is the Dingo?

2086
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:22,150
I'm not as big as a wolf.

2087
01:33:24,350 --> 01:33:25,183
I'm bullshit and you know,
but it's crazy because you guys are so 

2088
01:33:28,421 --> 01:33:29,254
scared to coming out to true.
You could snakes and spiders and I'm in 

2089
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:34,840
the Bush here for one day and there's a 
giant frigging Grizzly Bay.

2090
01:33:34,841 --> 01:33:38,180
Look at my tent and I'm like,
I'll take the spot.

2091
01:33:38,181 --> 01:33:40,690
Isn't snakes please?
Do you think it grizzly bears carry than

2092
01:33:40,691 --> 01:33:43,090
a Croc?
Crocs.

2093
01:33:43,260 --> 01:33:45,220
Crossfit gets a cold,
cold.

2094
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,113
Hard killer like that would just it.
It seems if you went in the water near 

2095
01:33:49,211 --> 01:33:51,340
any crocodile had come and have a crack 
at you.

2096
01:33:52,090 --> 01:33:55,660
If you went near any bar,
reckon about 50 percent of them,

2097
01:33:55,720 --> 01:33:59,260
40 percent of them might attack you.
It might even be less than that where it

2098
01:33:59,261 --> 01:34:00,094
just seems like crocodiles so stuck in 
the Jurassic period that anything that 

2099
01:34:03,191 --> 01:34:05,410
comes to that water's just going to get 
chomped.

2100
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:09,340
I tell you a quick little story,
so I'm in Arnhem land last year.

2101
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,780
Honestly.
It's like northern territory,

2102
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:14,110
Arnhem land on them,
on them,

2103
01:34:14,270 --> 01:34:19,270
but how are you spelling that?
It's I am heights a h,

2104
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:21,540
h,
h,

2105
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,760
h,
h,

2106
01:34:22,810 --> 01:34:27,410
h.
like when we say h,

2107
01:34:27,830 --> 01:34:28,663
h,
h,

2108
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:31,390
you guys put an a in there.
Probably not ask guys.

2109
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:35,030
Just me.
Nigga from Arnhem.

2110
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,960
Arnie,
Arnie homeland.

2111
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:39,880
Okay.
There's a vast wilderness area,

2112
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,540
or is.
It's God's land.

2113
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:43,923
Beautiful.
Okay,

2114
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:47,980
so you're an for an outdoorsman.
He was hell.

2115
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:51,670
Absolute hell for any city slicker.
It is out there.

2116
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:53,600
Ms Dot g dot.
Hello.

2117
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:55,650
Got a picture is amazing.
Yeah,

2118
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,910
it is a spectacular and virtually 
untouched.

2119
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,613
Yeah.
That's the crazy thing about Australia 

2120
01:35:02,291 --> 01:35:03,124
is the population that you guys have 
essentially the population of Los 

2121
01:35:07,690 --> 01:35:10,480
Angeles in a place as big as the 
continental United States.

2122
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:12,430
Think Cross for that.
Yeah,

2123
01:35:12,431 --> 01:35:13,780
it's nice.
It is nice.

2124
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:17,290
Even when we went to like you go to a 
nice city like Melbourne,

2125
01:35:17,860 --> 01:35:18,910
it's beautiful.
Yeah.

2126
01:35:18,970 --> 01:35:20,610
That's like a little country town for 
you guys.

2127
01:35:20,670 --> 01:35:21,820
Yeah.
All it is.

2128
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:22,720
It's tiny.
It's like boulder,

2129
01:35:22,721 --> 01:35:24,580
Colorado and we're like,
get us out of here.

2130
01:35:24,581 --> 01:35:26,470
There's too much traffic.
So uh,

2131
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:27,930
you're in Arnhem land and what?
Huh?

2132
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I mean Arnhem land and shoot these 
massive big boar pig and it runs down.

2133
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:37,750
So I shot it and it just ran down.
It was just on the edge of the water and

2134
01:35:37,751 --> 01:35:39,940
it's fighting like it's seconds away 
from dying.

2135
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:41,403
And um,
I walk over there and as I walk over 

2136
01:35:44,261 --> 01:35:46,870
there I sort of sit down and just give 
the animal that's piece,

2137
01:35:46,900 --> 01:35:47,733
you know,
I don't want to give him an adrenaline 

2138
01:35:48,461 --> 01:35:50,890
rush or anything like that because it 
could take longer for it to die.

2139
01:35:50,891 --> 01:35:55,891
So I would just sit down quietly and 
snap Massey big salt water crocodile,

2140
01:35:56,621 --> 01:35:57,454
just lunges out of the water and grabbed
these pig and stopped swimming out 

2141
01:36:00,670 --> 01:36:01,503
across this river.
I was seconds away from walking down 

2142
01:36:05,681 --> 01:36:08,710
there and essentially dragging that pig 
back

2143
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:09,693
bank a bit.
So I get photos that crock was sitting 

2144
01:36:11,831 --> 01:36:13,380
right there,
like within seconds

2145
01:36:13,520 --> 01:36:17,020
is that crocodile was sitting on the 
edge of the bank or just under the water

2146
01:36:17,021 --> 01:36:20,080
where it could grab that pig.
That's how quick it can happen.

2147
01:36:20,081 --> 01:36:21,010
People,
we'll walk down and go,

2148
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:21,963
I'll just be quick.
I'm just going to wash my face really 

2149
01:36:23,441 --> 01:36:24,580
quick.
It's always hot there.

2150
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:25,623
So the most appealing thing in the 
Haiti's like you say water and it's 

2151
01:36:27,791 --> 01:36:28,624
like,
oh well water go down there and just 

2152
01:36:29,981 --> 01:36:30,814
kind of splash a bit of water on my face
and arms will be real quick gone and 

2153
01:36:33,881 --> 01:36:35,820
they go for anything,
for anything.

2154
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:36,663
So I don't have a.
They don't have a reluctance to kill 

2155
01:36:38,051 --> 01:36:39,160
people at all.
Definitely not.

2156
01:36:39,490 --> 01:36:42,070
And then um,
there's.

2157
01:36:42,370 --> 01:36:44,920
Oh Jesus,
this elephant by the nose.

2158
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:47,110
Well that's not a stride is buddy 
elephant.

2159
01:36:47,111 --> 01:36:47,950
They.
Yeah,

2160
01:36:47,951 --> 01:36:52,750
that's a Nio crock.
They guys your Pyros Jaimee crocodile.

2161
01:36:53,310 --> 01:36:55,220
I think the same animals.
Yeah.

2162
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:56,373
It's the difference between the 
crocodiles in Australia and those 

2163
01:36:58,121 --> 01:37:01,360
fuckers.
Those fuckers are in Florida now.

2164
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,440
Assholes in Florida.
Florida is just overrun with assholes.

2165
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:10,000
Not Everybody's filed on day.
If you live in Florida and you're a nice

2166
01:37:10,001 --> 01:37:12,100
person,
I appreciate Davao and legend.

2167
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:13,150
Yeah.
I'm.

2168
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:17,050
The crocodiles in the Nile.
Crocodiles have been in,

2169
01:37:17,370 --> 01:37:18,203
introduced to Florida.
Assholes have just released into the 

2170
01:37:21,101 --> 01:37:21,611
everglades.
No,

2171
01:37:21,611 --> 01:37:23,320
it's not.
They have a shoot to kill.

2172
01:37:23,321 --> 01:37:24,490
It's not.
I'm being sarcastic.

2173
01:37:26,070 --> 01:37:29,440
I was being sarcastic back.
They have a shoot on sight,

2174
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:30,333
a order literally seeing Nile crocodile 
supposed to kill it on site because 

2175
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:33,783
they're terrified of him developing a 
sustainable population because the 

2176
01:37:36,641 --> 01:37:37,474
crocodiles they have,
the native crocodiles in Florida are 

2177
01:37:39,011 --> 01:37:40,870
small,
but they're very aggressive.

2178
01:37:41,020 --> 01:37:42,640
They're way more aggressive than 
alligators,

2179
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:43,773
but they're smaller,
but now they have these fucking nial 

2180
01:37:46,121 --> 01:37:46,954
crocs.
We got just absolutely savage and just 

2181
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:51,460
swallow a person hall.
You're talking about the everglades,

2182
01:37:51,461 --> 01:37:53,470
which is just overrun with things for 
them to eat,

2183
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:56,970
so there's a high of them achieving a 
large size.

2184
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:00,150
Where did they get that idea from?
The assholes.

2185
01:38:00,540 --> 01:38:02,850
People have them as pets.
The same thing as pythons.

2186
01:38:02,860 --> 01:38:03,693
You know the python situation in Florida
that people have had to have them as 

2187
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:07,560
pets and then release them into the 
wall.

2188
01:38:07,940 --> 01:38:10,200
Had I got there,
it would get too big and they go,

2189
01:38:10,210 --> 01:38:12,640
fuck this.
I'm going to let a kid,

2190
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:14,880
hey,
you little crocodile,

2191
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:16,073
go out and enjoy the wild and they think
they're doing the right thing by 

2192
01:38:18,990 --> 01:38:21,310
releasing this thing into the swamps and
then,

2193
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,940
well,
they have a breeding population now they

2194
01:38:23,941 --> 01:38:25,620
have a breeding population of Nile.

2195
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:30,340
Crocodiles in fucking Florida sent back 
to the Australian introduced species.

2196
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,610
It like,
it didn't stop it at foxes.

2197
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:33,960
I kept making these mistakes.
You know,

2198
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:34,794
the cane toads,
we have a lot of trouble with the cane 

2199
01:38:35,761 --> 01:38:37,680
toads now.
Keen to cane toad.

2200
01:38:37,830 --> 01:38:40,650
What's a cane to virtually overtaken 
Australia.

2201
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,513
They're going to have their own 
businesses and run for parliament and 

2202
01:38:43,221 --> 01:38:44,054
everything.
Eventually like towed or opening your 

2203
01:38:48,871 --> 01:38:50,480
hands like a pizza.
Freaking oh,

2204
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:52,680
not a pizza.
Oh my God.

2205
01:38:52,740 --> 01:38:54,570
As a cane toad.
Whoa.

2206
01:38:54,571 --> 01:38:56,520
That thing's huge.
Bunny rabbit,

2207
01:38:56,580 --> 01:38:59,550
they got these glands on their back and 
it's got a poisonous toxin in it.

2208
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:00,211
Oh,
that's great.

2209
01:39:00,211 --> 01:39:03,960
And so our bird wildlife are snakes.
I hate snakes.

2210
01:39:04,350 --> 01:39:06,000
Snakes are protected in Australia by the
way.

2211
01:39:06,001 --> 01:39:06,834
You can't just go and kill the snake 
when you want and they've still got 

2212
01:39:09,481 --> 01:39:11,300
their place.
They're 100 percent snakes and got their

2213
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,143
place in Australia,
the snakes atum and these poisonous 

2214
01:39:14,641 --> 01:39:15,474
toxins will kill the snakes that'll kill
that bird life that they had just 

2215
01:39:19,291 --> 01:39:21,780
horrific Jesus kroger the size,
these things,

2216
01:39:21,930 --> 01:39:22,763
so why don't quote me,
but I'm pretty sure they brought him in 

2217
01:39:25,911 --> 01:39:26,744
to fight off a cane beetle that was 
eating now cane crops and there's that 

2218
01:39:30,511 --> 01:39:32,860
many other bugs in that that the cane 
toad would have been like,

2219
01:39:33,110 --> 01:39:34,170
I'll just eat what I want.

2220
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,960
What a stupid thing.
Can't we learn?

2221
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,160
Well,
people are very,

2222
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:43,050
very infant tile with the perspective on
the ecosystem,

2223
01:39:43,051 --> 01:39:46,350
like the idea that you could just,
oh well we've got a little problem here.

2224
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:47,760
I got,
well there's a little opening.

2225
01:39:47,761 --> 01:39:48,594
I'll stick up a slot in there.
Just shove a Predator in there and I'll 

2226
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:55,060
fill that opening like they didn't 
consider all the other animals that this

2227
01:39:55,070 --> 01:39:55,903
thing would eat.
If they want to do something and what 

2228
01:39:57,391 --> 01:40:00,120
they should do instead of introduced and
shit like this.

2229
01:40:00,130 --> 01:40:02,060
See this,
check your load for a cane.

2230
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:03,383
Toads,
cane toads are great stowaways and can 

2231
01:40:07,531 --> 01:40:08,364
be easily transported and your goods and
luggage when you were packing up to 

2232
01:40:11,191 --> 01:40:13,800
leave from an area where cane toads are 
present,

2233
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:16,320
it is important to thoroughly check 
that.

2234
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:19,230
Were that accidentally carrying a cane 
toad?

2235
01:40:20,160 --> 01:40:22,510
They're not a good thing.
Tasmanian Tiger?

2236
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:23,683
Yeah,
to the Tasmanian talk like extinct 

2237
01:40:25,651 --> 01:40:28,230
narrow,
but they got the DNA from one guy,

2238
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:30,660
ray and juice something.
Let's do it.

2239
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:33,360
Are they going to reintroduce one that I
like white,

2240
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:36,630
but they should now if they wanted to 
introduce that,

2241
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:37,493
they wanted to take the DNA from a 
Tasmanian Tiger and reintroduce it when 

2242
01:40:40,591 --> 01:40:45,120
they have to have something that was 
like a similar animal in and reintroduce

2243
01:40:45,121 --> 01:40:45,954
it.
Possibly.

2244
01:40:46,670 --> 01:40:49,080
I don't know how it works.
I think I got that from Jurassic Park.

2245
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:52,320
Probably pretty true though.
I think that's how they do it.

2246
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,363
Well then in that,
what they said they were going to do 

2247
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:55,114
with the woolly mammoth,
like there was this Russian scientists 

2248
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,490
that we're thinking about reintroducing 
the wooly mammoth and they were going to

2249
01:41:00,491 --> 01:41:03,610
use the DNA from a woolly mammoth from 
some,

2250
01:41:03,670 --> 01:41:05,860
you know,
fossilized something or another,

2251
01:41:05,861 --> 01:41:09,550
and they were going to combine it with 
the DNA from a regular elephant.

2252
01:41:09,670 --> 01:41:12,030
Okay.
I think that'd be interesting.

2253
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:14,650
I think in some cases like that,
you know,

2254
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:17,260
not trying to be God or anything,
but that should happen.

2255
01:41:17,261 --> 01:41:18,210
That's a good thing,
right?

2256
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:22,810
Togare I think it's only extinct because
of human interactions.

2257
01:41:22,840 --> 01:41:26,200
Right?
So out of night,

2258
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,750
I don't know either,
but 90 percent of everything is extinct.

2259
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:30,610
Ninety percent of everything that's ever
lived.

2260
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,020
It's like,
where do you draw the line?

2261
01:41:32,021 --> 01:41:33,550
Do we bring back dinosaurs,
you know,

2262
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:35,440
when do we draw the line?
That'd be good hunting.

2263
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:36,750
Ooh,
tigger impact.

2264
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:39,810
Big Foot.
Would you want the t rex?

2265
01:41:40,150 --> 01:41:41,560
Um,
if there was enough of them,

2266
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:42,394
what if they say is good?
Imagine that because alligators tastes 

2267
01:41:43,901 --> 01:41:44,401
good.
Well,

2268
01:41:44,401 --> 01:41:45,160
I do.
Yeah,

2269
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,360
I've eaten one.
Yup.

2270
01:41:46,660 --> 01:41:48,460
John Dudley kills them all the time.
He eats him.

2271
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:49,323
Yeah,
he's a slave.

2272
01:41:49,510 --> 01:41:50,343
He's still there.
He said that their tails like alligator 

2273
01:41:53,141 --> 01:41:53,974
tail,
like the meat from them is apparently 

2274
01:41:55,061 --> 01:41:57,910
like more rich and protein than he like 
elk or Moose.

2275
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:58,960
Really?
That's crazy.

2276
01:41:58,980 --> 01:42:01,990
We packing that into the back country is
supposed to be like really good for you.

2277
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:03,093
Super Lean.
Cook it quick sear it will her it 

2278
01:42:06,491 --> 01:42:07,324
alligator.
So our crocodiles back home are 

2279
01:42:09,101 --> 01:42:10,610
protected as well.
Oh Geez.

2280
01:42:10,630 --> 01:42:13,150
This not tag or anything for them.
You can't kill a crocodile.

2281
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:16,540
A crocodile.
What they re like hate him.

2282
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,410
But city of kill something over here 
please.

2283
01:42:20,770 --> 01:42:22,990
This,
the city in the northern territory,

2284
01:42:22,991 --> 01:42:23,824
which is all part of honestly and ne is,
is Darwin City and the river runs right 

2285
01:42:29,381 --> 01:42:31,090
into the city and there's crocodiles 
right in there.

2286
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:34,590
So guys will go out clubbing or you 
know,

2287
01:42:34,600 --> 01:42:35,433
drink and get drunk and think it's a 
good idea to jump in the river for a 

2288
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:40,060
swim and Yahoo.
And I'm now getting snatched.

2289
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,313
So they catch oles crocodiles and I 
release him like miles and miles away 

2290
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:49,300
and these things come straight back into
the science spot.

2291
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:50,133
And they liked the,
this is what I'm hearing about these 

2292
01:42:50,891 --> 01:42:51,724
bears,
right?

2293
01:42:51,990 --> 01:42:55,590
Like catch sleeves,
problem bears and they release them were

2294
01:42:55,630 --> 01:42:56,463
near on hunting.
Unfortunately they catch these problem 

2295
01:42:58,451 --> 01:42:59,284
based and that release them multiply and
then a week later they show back up to 

2296
01:43:03,041 --> 01:43:04,650
the same destination.
Yeah.

2297
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:06,340
Crazy.
They know how to get back.

2298
01:43:06,410 --> 01:43:07,243
They have some sort of internal compass.
One of the things about saltwater 

2299
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:11,080
crocodiles,
it's so terrifying.

2300
01:43:11,081 --> 01:43:11,914
As a friend of mine was telling me that 
they were on some sort of a boat and 

2301
01:43:14,321 --> 01:43:16,840
they were like a deep out into the 
ocean,

2302
01:43:16,841 --> 01:43:20,020
miles out and they saw saltwater 
crocodile swimming out there.

2303
01:43:20,560 --> 01:43:22,500
And what,
how,

2304
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:23,453
how far?
He said yeah,

2305
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,363
I think he said he was something like 
three to five miles away from shore and 

2306
01:43:27,130 --> 01:43:27,963
it's fucking crocodiles just out there 
swimming by z probably could have 

2307
01:43:31,500 --> 01:43:34,030
probably gotten a great watch off or 
some shit.

2308
01:43:34,420 --> 01:43:37,650
Fuck,
it's a goddamn dinosaur hat.

2309
01:43:37,690 --> 01:43:38,690
Look at that thing.
Yeah,

2310
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:40,450
that's crazy.
When came,

2311
01:43:40,451 --> 01:43:41,284
came out and were up in Arnhem land and 
I was telling him about all the 

2312
01:43:44,021 --> 01:43:45,160
dangerous shit,
you know,

2313
01:43:45,161 --> 01:43:46,980
like a crocodile will,
you know,

2314
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:49,750
there's crocodiles in any bit of water 
here you wouldn't even know and there'll

2315
01:43:49,751 --> 01:43:51,680
be a crocodile in there and

2316
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:54,440
how buffalo charge you're in charge 
here.

2317
01:43:54,441 --> 01:43:55,274
And I told him about all the poisoners 
bushes and everything and at the end of 

2318
01:43:58,401 --> 01:44:01,420
one day we got,
we got back with like half our light and

2319
01:44:01,421 --> 01:44:02,254
because I didn't pack any food in,
we had to catch fish every day or try 

2320
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:05,504
and shoot some shoots eight.
So we got back half an hour early one 

2321
01:44:08,751 --> 01:44:10,670
afternoon and we're like,
we'll go for a quick fish,

2322
01:44:10,830 --> 01:44:12,590
we're going to catch some fish in and 
we've got to get some,

2323
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:17,300
some food into us.
And we walk out and it's stinking hot.

2324
01:44:17,301 --> 01:44:18,134
It's like 56 degrees Celsius.
They'd like sweating it out is like 

2325
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:27,200
1:10.
That's probably even a bit higher.

2326
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,120
Yep.
It's hot.

2327
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:32,690
And unlike how we might be able to swim 
in one of the rock pools,

2328
01:44:32,691 --> 01:44:35,050
you don't want to swim out in the ocean 
because one of them crocs is gonna.

2329
01:44:35,060 --> 01:44:40,060
Grab a 50 slash 56.
Oh my God.

2330
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,130
Jack it up.
Baby 50.

2331
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:45,200
Oh Jesus.
One 30 to walk in the park.

2332
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:48,980
One hundred and 32 degrees.
Temperature drink and buffalo peers.

2333
01:44:49,010 --> 01:44:49,843
Because you had to keep hydrated or die.
What does it feel like to be out in 132 

2334
01:44:53,751 --> 01:44:55,370
degree temperature?
You get used to it.

2335
01:44:55,820 --> 01:44:57,700
How the fuck do you get used to them?
It's like,

2336
01:44:58,110 --> 01:44:58,943
it's like that.
All my guys are working with working 

2337
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:02,730
that temperature or summer.
You could slip that cooking.

2338
01:45:02,780 --> 01:45:06,000
I'm at 115 degrees.
Those birds dying around us.

2339
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,930
There's a little video where I've got 
like,

2340
01:45:08,990 --> 01:45:11,410
it might be a frogmouth,
our attorney our.

2341
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:14,150
And it's just that heart that it's just,
it's on the grant,

2342
01:45:14,151 --> 01:45:15,220
it's,
it's out,

2343
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:17,060
you know,
because it hasn't had obviously a bit of

2344
01:45:17,061 --> 01:45:17,894
hto and that day and anyway.
So we're going out and there's a rock 

2345
01:45:21,141 --> 01:45:21,380
pool.

2346
01:45:21,380 --> 01:45:21,821
I'm like,
well,

2347
01:45:21,821 --> 01:45:24,570
we'll be safe to swim in that rock pool,
and the tide had gone out.

2348
01:45:24,571 --> 01:45:26,290
We've got big tires like seven made a 
tired,

2349
01:45:26,291 --> 01:45:27,680
you know,
they're come in and out every day,

2350
01:45:28,430 --> 01:45:31,520
and the todd had been in and when had 
gone out to the left,

2351
01:45:31,610 --> 01:45:34,340
a bunch of box jellyfish in that little 
pool.

2352
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:36,043
Then the ocean itself where we'll 
fishing in or you wouldn't be able to 

2353
01:45:38,361 --> 01:45:41,880
dip your hand in the water getting stung
by the box jellyfish box.

2354
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:43,010
Jellyfish will kill you.
Oh,

2355
01:45:43,070 --> 01:45:44,720
you're dead dude.
That was a,

2356
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:45,613
that was a four and a half hour chopper 
flight out to get there because we did 

2357
01:45:48,741 --> 01:45:50,840
it in the wet season.
You couldn't drive any of the roads.

2358
01:45:51,410 --> 01:45:53,510
Um,
I had to hire a helicopter to get us out

2359
01:45:53,511 --> 01:45:54,344
there.
So it would have been four and a half 

2360
01:45:55,401 --> 01:45:56,234
hours for a hell of a cop to come in and
then four and a half hours back to the 

2361
01:45:58,791 --> 01:45:59,624
hospital.

2362
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:02,060
You're dead in that time.
You're dead in the first hour.

2363
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:03,920
Like it's,
yeah,

2364
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:06,370
you've got to have your wits about you 
and that sort of country.

2365
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:10,370
So box jellyfish.
What do they look like?

2366
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:12,920
They're the one that nearly clear.
They like,

2367
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:14,083
fuck yeah,
look at that shit and that'll kill you 

2368
01:46:16,551 --> 01:46:17,384
instantly,
and that's the one thing I didn't tell 

2369
01:46:18,260 --> 01:46:19,093
came about and we get out to the rocks 
and all the crazy shit that I've told 

2370
01:46:22,701 --> 01:46:23,534
you,
dude.

2371
01:46:23,630 --> 01:46:26,330
That's what would've killed us here if 
we jumped in the water.

2372
01:46:26,331 --> 01:46:26,631
Like,
Nah,

2373
01:46:26,631 --> 01:46:31,100
let's just jump in for a quick dip.
Wow.

2374
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:32,090
Who's that?
Mad boss?

2375
01:46:32,120 --> 01:46:34,340
That's that crazy fucking river 
monsters.

2376
01:46:34,350 --> 01:46:35,210
Wow.
Look at that one.

2377
01:46:35,211 --> 01:46:37,130
That got that guy's leg.
Go.

2378
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:42,160
Go back to that leg picture jamie.
Go full screen on that man.

2379
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:44,090
That's sick.
Tighter.

2380
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:49,670
I think you keep that person.
Just get close enough to the

2381
01:46:50,020 --> 01:46:52,350
knee of the water again.
Is it like an antivenom?

2382
01:46:52,410 --> 01:46:53,430
Oh,
is that a baby?

2383
01:46:53,490 --> 01:46:55,500
Oh God.
Damn.

2384
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:59,580
One year old.
Oh my God.

2385
01:46:59,581 --> 01:47:00,414
That's will Smith was in a movie or a 
diabetes organs at the end of the movie 

2386
01:47:05,131 --> 01:47:07,470
and he's going to.
That's how he commit suicide.

2387
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,690
He's going to jumping up off with box 
jellyfish.

2388
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,410
What fucking movie I am.
Legend.

2389
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:17,370
Scary Shit.
And I am legend.

2390
01:47:17,590 --> 01:47:18,540
It is kind of.
I mean,

2391
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:21,180
there's so many monsters that exist.
Seven pounds,

2392
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:22,710
seven pounds,
seven pounds.

2393
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,000
What does that mean to you about.
I think that's the one with the kid.

2394
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:28,753
The kid.
Kid.

2395
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:33,500
Isn't that the one where he's poor?
Like he becomes a successful person?

2396
01:47:34,530 --> 01:47:35,850
Oh,
I don't want to say that shit.

2397
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:38,400
I'll get that fucking thing away from 
me.

2398
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:40,470
Oh,
he actually does kill himself,

2399
01:47:41,160 --> 01:47:44,610
so he actually does any tips of box 
jellyfish in the water of human?

2400
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:45,130
Yeah.

2401
01:47:45,130 --> 01:47:46,530
Get out of here.
I don't want to see this shit.

2402
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:49,530
Get you coming out.
Get the fuck out of here.

2403
01:47:50,370 --> 01:47:52,650
That's a movie.
He dies with box jellyfish.

2404
01:47:52,680 --> 01:47:55,220
That's a retarded.
No,

2405
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,030
get the fuck out.
They're not even that big.

2406
01:47:57,640 --> 01:48:02,030
Jamie.
I don't want to say it anyway.

2407
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,840
When you come out.
I wouldn't take any of those and there's

2408
01:48:03,841 --> 01:48:05,640
so many things that killed.
We'll take him in the ocean.

2409
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:09,960
Then the things that kill you because 
they want us to live in Australia.

2410
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:10,913
It's true.
That's what I always think about work 

2411
01:48:11,911 --> 01:48:15,920
because it's so freaking hot.
It's so desolate that it's like,

2412
01:48:15,921 --> 01:48:18,420
it just wasn't designed for people is 
part of the earth.

2413
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:19,730
No,
I think.

2414
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:21,240
Well,
people didn't live then,

2415
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:22,103
so didn't balance it out at some of the 
oldest earth on earth work that people 

2416
01:48:26,491 --> 01:48:31,140
didn't live their western dummies,
like uni white people.

2417
01:48:31,140 --> 01:48:33,510
We definitely didn't.
The indigenous people that lived there,

2418
01:48:33,511 --> 01:48:36,060
I did that.
I lived on the mainland and um,

2419
01:48:36,310 --> 01:48:39,300
there's actually some really interesting
areas out there.

2420
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:40,134
It's called the dampier archipelago in 
the Pilbara region of Western Australia 

2421
01:48:44,010 --> 01:48:44,843
and there's over 70,000
a rock in the area that I still don't 

2422
01:48:49,471 --> 01:48:50,610
know this.
Maybe you can solve it,

2423
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:54,300
but 70,000
rockets in that area.

2424
01:48:54,640 --> 01:48:56,370
Wow.
Kangaroos,

2425
01:48:56,371 --> 01:48:59,430
sea turtles,
creatures that don't even exist anymore.

2426
01:48:59,431 --> 01:49:00,480
When you look at the picture,
you're like,

2427
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:02,490
was that a real animal?
That drawer and all that.

2428
01:49:02,491 --> 01:49:03,140
I just like,
ah,

2429
01:49:03,140 --> 01:49:03,973
I just got to fuck her.
And so they don't even know whether or 

2430
01:49:05,311 --> 01:49:07,550
not it was a real thing because it 
doesn't exist anymore.

2431
01:49:07,551 --> 01:49:09,540
It doesn't exist anymore.
Wow.

2432
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:10,560
Yeah.
Well,

2433
01:49:10,561 --> 01:49:12,030
the,
the kangaroo thing,

2434
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:13,830
we were talking about that before the 
podcast,

2435
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:15,720
we said we're going to show this video.
Um,

2436
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:19,200
I did not know the Kangaroos were 
protected.

2437
01:49:19,230 --> 01:49:21,240
Like you can't just shoot kangaroos over
there,

2438
01:49:21,300 --> 01:49:23,640
all about naive animals.
You can't have any event.

2439
01:49:23,641 --> 01:49:26,760
90 animals in Australia,
everything we can hunt and there's 27 or

2440
01:49:26,761 --> 01:49:31,350
28 spaces are old introduced.
They're an invasive species,

2441
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:34,320
like a feral pest.
That's why we're allowed to hunt them.

2442
01:49:34,740 --> 01:49:39,420
It's not like the American system where 
your hunting unite is lucky at what tile

2443
01:49:39,421 --> 01:49:40,254
and oak and everything like that.
And that's why we don't have a tag 

2444
01:49:42,661 --> 01:49:43,381
season.
Well,

2445
01:49:43,381 --> 01:49:44,760
we don't have any,
any,

2446
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,863
any seasons at all in New South Wales.
They've just introduced this season in 

2447
01:49:49,511 --> 01:49:54,511
the last couple of years and there's one
species of d in Victoria,

2448
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,610
the lower part of Australia where you 
need to tag for.

2449
01:49:59,660 --> 01:50:02,110
That's it.
All those other species you don't need a

2450
01:50:02,111 --> 01:50:03,650
tag for.
And there's no season.

2451
01:50:03,670 --> 01:50:06,760
What species have a healthy body?
You need to type for those.

2452
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:07,713
Oh,
there's not a bunch of them and they're 

2453
01:50:08,531 --> 01:50:09,340
trying to manage them.

2454
01:50:09,340 --> 01:50:10,420
It's really good.
What they're doing,

2455
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:12,790
they're doing a good job.
Mm hmm.

2456
01:50:12,970 --> 01:50:13,803
So the kangaroo thing.
I had no idea that the numbers of 

2457
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:20,770
Kangaroos were as high as they are.
So you were telling me about this.

2458
01:50:20,780 --> 01:50:21,613
Looks like a kangaroo plague.
And then Jamie pull the video up and 

2459
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:28,780
this is fucking insane.
Just Google kangaroo plague Australia.

2460
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:32,380
And what you see is something from a 
fucking horror movie.

2461
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:33,543
It looks like thousands of Kangaroos.
I mean I have no idea how many of their 

2462
01:50:36,660 --> 01:50:38,590
head they're just running across this 
field.

2463
01:50:38,591 --> 01:50:40,480
Like ants.
I bet you have that.

2464
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:42,160
Analysts.
I wouldn't cheeses.

2465
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:45,790
I mean completely insane when you look 
at that video.

2466
01:50:45,791 --> 01:50:47,770
I have no idea.
Yeah.

2467
01:50:47,771 --> 01:50:51,670
So fuck a sign.
The sign people that are lucky,

2468
01:50:51,671 --> 01:50:53,530
you can't call the Kangaroos,
you know,

2469
01:50:53,531 --> 01:50:55,780
you can't hunt the Kangaroos.
You can't shoot the Kangaroos.

2470
01:50:56,140 --> 01:50:58,450
Kangaroos are a deer species,
right?

2471
01:50:59,290 --> 01:51:02,040
I don't think so.
I think they're like a marsupial.

2472
01:51:02,041 --> 01:51:04,330
It doesn't have a near.
Okay.

2473
01:51:04,690 --> 01:51:07,330
I think.
I think they even taste like deer.

2474
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,700
They taste good too.
The really rich red.

2475
01:51:09,701 --> 01:51:11,230
Meat's super,
super lean.

2476
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:14,260
A lot of the lot of the body builders 
and stuff like that.

2477
01:51:14,261 --> 01:51:16,960
Love kangaroo meat.
When did kangaroo start getting joked?

2478
01:51:17,050 --> 01:51:19,630
Yoked up.
They always had big muscles.

2479
01:51:19,690 --> 01:51:20,523
They've always had big muscle.
We didn't see that in America until 

2480
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:23,290
recently.
Not really.

2481
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:27,670
Internet over the last few years has 
showed us a choking each other.

2482
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:28,603
Hey,
say they doing weights and shit and 

2483
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,440
pumping.
It looks like they're fucking giant.

2484
01:51:32,710 --> 01:51:33,543
Yeah.
There's a video of those two kangaroos 

2485
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:35,760
fighting one kangaroo.
Chokes.

2486
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:37,310
You conscious?
Look at that kangaroo.

2487
01:51:37,980 --> 01:51:39,520
Just normal.
Like,

2488
01:51:39,521 --> 01:51:40,870
come on man.
That's incredible.

2489
01:51:41,150 --> 01:51:42,730
We never saw kangaroos.
Yeah.

2490
01:51:43,530 --> 01:51:44,950
So that's.
That looks like a big red.

2491
01:51:45,010 --> 01:51:48,400
Kangaroos are.
The red ones are the biggest ones,

2492
01:51:48,401 --> 01:51:48,580
right?

2493
01:51:48,580 --> 01:51:49,170
Yep.
Yeah,

2494
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:51,970
the huge.
My friend Eddie was in Australia.

2495
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:52,804
He does a.
he's done a bunch of standup out there 

2496
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:57,460
and he was out there with some 
Australians and I forget what the store.

2497
01:51:57,490 --> 01:52:02,080
Look at the fucking dentist even.
Look real man does not look real bitch.

2498
01:52:02,081 --> 01:52:04,330
You and arm wrestle.
Fuck that man.

2499
01:52:04,690 --> 01:52:06,730
So that was what would happen with 
Eddie.

2500
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:07,623
He got out of the car for some reason 
and he saw this kangaroo and he thought 

2501
01:52:12,191 --> 01:52:15,550
it was a statue because it was so big.
He thought it was.

2502
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:17,940
He thought it wasn't really so he was 
like seven feet tall.

2503
01:52:17,941 --> 01:52:19,990
It's like there's no fucking way.
This is a real kangaroo.

2504
01:52:20,230 --> 01:52:21,063
He literally thought it was a statute 
because it was sitting there and his 

2505
01:52:23,291 --> 01:52:27,730
friend started screaming,
get back fucking car,

2506
01:52:27,820 --> 01:52:29,350
and the thing turns around and looks at 
him,

2507
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,393
and then he realized that this giant 
thing in front of them was an actual 

2508
01:52:32,771 --> 01:52:34,780
kangaroo and apparently they're very 
aggressive.

2509
01:52:35,050 --> 01:52:36,750
They're calling as a life feel 
threatened now.

2510
01:52:37,690 --> 01:52:40,300
They'll kick your stomach out because 
what they do is they latch onto you.

2511
01:52:40,301 --> 01:52:42,190
If they close.
I've actually got a real big claw.

2512
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:44,690
They got clothes like that.
Yeah,

2513
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,883
and then they balance their cell phone,
their tile and like kick with both legs 

2514
01:52:48,411 --> 01:52:53,411
and they got like a single toe nail 
that's like that thing that has legs and

2515
01:52:55,130 --> 01:52:55,963
that does not look real.
And the balance that way on their back 

2516
01:52:59,940 --> 01:53:00,773
tails and credible out balancing their 
Bechtel's now kick with both their legs 

2517
01:53:04,311 --> 01:53:07,220
and then look how he's like balancing 
himself.

2518
01:53:07,221 --> 01:53:10,520
That's so strange.
Strange animal.

2519
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:12,763
God that is a flex and come up.
Might come down to 100 pound ripped 

2520
01:53:16,910 --> 01:53:19,790
kangaroo crushes metal.
Oh my God.

2521
01:53:22,190 --> 01:53:23,023
He's bending cans.
Look arms and this motherfucker is so 

2522
01:53:27,261 --> 01:53:30,890
strange.
They are cool animal on the farm.

2523
01:53:30,891 --> 01:53:32,360
When you come out to Australia,
you'll see.

2524
01:53:32,420 --> 01:53:34,470
You'll see a kangaroo fights.
They do it all day.

2525
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,540
Everyday.
Shit out of each other.

2526
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:37,730
Yeah.
They always choke each other out because

2527
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:39,820
some new shit.
Are they learning how to do this?

2528
01:53:43,510 --> 01:53:45,890
I'll spinning back,
kick their fucking chest.

2529
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:52,010
He wants to pitch a piss.
I wonder if we could take a leg kick.

2530
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:54,560
I always think if I was going to fuck 
with a kangaroo,

2531
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:56,300
I would just arm drag him and take his 
back.

2532
01:53:57,110 --> 01:53:58,880
I bet if you take us back,
I didn't know what to do.

2533
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:00,823
Oh,
I don't know.

2534
01:54:01,070 --> 01:54:03,200
Take his back out and find out and choke
them.

2535
01:54:03,580 --> 01:54:04,413
We'll test it out when we get there and 
he'd some fit clothing like Kevlar to 

2536
01:54:08,120 --> 01:54:11,210
where it can't cut your guts out because
you know,

2537
01:54:11,240 --> 01:54:13,730
probably won't even go for your face or 
I'd probably go for your guts.

2538
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:15,740
Got For you.
Got Getting the guts.

2539
01:54:15,800 --> 01:54:16,633
If you can protect that,
if you could figure out a way to like 

2540
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:19,380
move in,
Juco them,

2541
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:20,060
fake.
Um,

2542
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:21,380
get them to move.
Get Ahold of one of them,

2543
01:54:21,381 --> 01:54:26,381
pause arm,
drag them back because y'all going to be

2544
01:54:28,131 --> 01:54:29,600
awesome.
It'd be on the news.

2545
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:32,510
My Dad and tries to take on a kangaroo's
it ain't gets his stomach kicked out.

2546
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:37,540
This is how I die by getting.
There's a bunch of these videos of these

2547
01:54:37,611 --> 01:54:38,444
kangaroos choking each other out.
I've never seen him choke each other 

2548
01:54:40,941 --> 01:54:41,510
out.
Oh,

2549
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:42,570
there's a great video.
Um,

2550
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:46,460
these two kangaroos are fighting in like
a suburban neighborhood and they're in a

2551
01:54:46,461 --> 01:54:49,370
street and one kangaroo Canberra.
He gets like a,

2552
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:51,620
like a,
what we call like a vice grip clamp.

2553
01:54:51,950 --> 01:54:54,710
In jujitsu you would use or wrestling,
you'd like clamp,

2554
01:54:55,020 --> 01:54:57,980
you scoop the back of someone's neck 
like this with one arm.

2555
01:54:57,980 --> 01:55:00,110
And the other arm comes down and he 
clamped down like this,

2556
01:55:00,111 --> 01:55:03,020
this is it.
And he fucking chokes him to sleep.

2557
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:05,320
This has got to be Canberra for see if 
he could fight this.

2558
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:08,510
I don't think they just start kicking 
each other's asses,

2559
01:55:09,140 --> 01:55:11,870
but they're in a like a regular 
neighborhood fucking each other up.

2560
01:55:12,020 --> 01:55:17,020
But see if you fall,
you call the tight.

2561
01:55:19,341 --> 01:55:20,480
This shit.
I should.

2562
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:24,320
But it's all the standard moves.
It's very a sock.

2563
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:25,154
'Em robots.
Look how they snap each other's heads 

2564
01:55:26,271 --> 01:55:29,510
back to two good buck there.
They only go for the guts.

2565
01:55:30,170 --> 01:55:32,840
Oh look at that move though.
I like how they balance on that.

2566
01:55:32,841 --> 01:55:34,100
Tail it.
It's really crazy.

2567
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:35,953
See if you can find kangaroo chokes out 
other kangaroo because he puts him to 

2568
01:55:40,221 --> 01:55:41,054
sleep like literally the clamp down on 
them and it turns his neck like it's 

2569
01:55:44,940 --> 01:55:46,500
another thing we invented in Australia.

2570
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:48,890
Checkouts,
Kangaroos,

2571
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:50,610
tinder.
People learn from Kangaroos.

2572
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,040
Maybe.
Maybe.

2573
01:55:52,041 --> 01:55:55,020
Maybe someone actually saw in school to 
the Canberra.

2574
01:55:55,320 --> 01:55:56,153
I bet people didn't know that you could 
choke people out until they saw someone 

2575
01:55:58,021 --> 01:55:58,854
do it.
Right?

2576
01:55:58,890 --> 01:55:59,723
Yeah.
Here it is.

2577
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:00,900
So he,
they,

2578
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:05,940
they start going at it and one kangaroo 
is cv could find out where he does it.

2579
01:56:07,960 --> 01:56:08,793
He gets a front headlock,
see the one kangaroos kind of being a 

2580
01:56:13,621 --> 01:56:16,410
pitcher.
So here it is.

2581
01:56:16,630 --> 01:56:18,990
She's got the clamp,
we'll get it clamped.

2582
01:56:19,530 --> 01:56:20,363
He gets a hold of the neck and he's 
bending his neck and a really funny way 

2583
01:56:23,251 --> 01:56:25,470
and he traps the head up against his 
chest.

2584
01:56:25,471 --> 01:56:27,180
I mean this is like a Japanese necktie 
right here.

2585
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:30,300
And he grabs a hold of it and he's 
clamping down on it.

2586
01:56:30,490 --> 01:56:31,770
It's not even like he's paying 
attention.

2587
01:56:31,771 --> 01:56:35,310
It was like he's looking for girls,
hey ladies got this shit.

2588
01:56:35,650 --> 01:56:38,140
Looting.
I wonder if he's done that before.

2589
01:56:38,141 --> 01:56:40,690
But that's his baby.
So he,

2590
01:56:40,740 --> 01:56:41,573
he clamps down on any holds it in place 
and the kangaroo fights for a little 

2591
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:47,380
while and then Bam passes out.
That's awesome.

2592
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:53,340
And is a bitch.
What a bizarre bodied animal.

2593
01:56:54,670 --> 01:56:55,503
There's nothing like them wake up.
It's been so used to seeing these 

2594
01:56:58,381 --> 01:57:01,400
animals that same way to us.
Uh,

2595
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:03,240
but when I think about it,
I'm like,

2596
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:05,500
these things are on two legs.
Yeah.

2597
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:07,970
What else is on two legs?
Not.

2598
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:10,830
Have you ever seen a platypus?
Well they kinda go on the front leg.

2599
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:12,540
Like look there.
Yeah.

2600
01:57:12,541 --> 01:57:16,260
When they're just walking along.
But have you ever seen a platypus?

2601
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:17,353
Not In real life.
A lot of posts is just crazy to look at 

2602
01:57:19,711 --> 01:57:21,030
it.
Even for me and I've grown up with.

2603
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:21,864
Platypus.
I used to be in the creeks and the 

2604
01:57:22,981 --> 01:57:23,820
rivers around home.

2605
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:25,133
They were just so weird to look at and 
let the kid know and when I stopped 

2606
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:30,450
thinking about as species,
like the wombat,

2607
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:34,050
the wombat is just crazy.
They're all over the farm.

2608
01:57:34,051 --> 01:57:35,520
You'll see them everywhere when you come
out.

2609
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:36,663
I'm like,
just dig these massive big halls and 

2610
01:57:38,461 --> 01:57:40,770
they just the craziest creature you've 
ever seen.

2611
01:57:41,450 --> 01:57:43,290
It's just like the big,
big,

2612
01:57:43,291 --> 01:57:46,260
fat stumpy rat.
I know the name Wombat,

2613
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:48,480
but honestly I couldn't pick one out of 
a lineup.

2614
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:51,810
I don't really know what it looks like,
but let's get to that kitchen.

2615
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:53,000
What is it?
A kitchen now?

2616
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:54,180
What is it?
How you say it,

2617
01:57:54,370 --> 01:57:55,171
kid?
No Kid.

2618
01:57:55,171 --> 01:57:56,004
No Kid.
No.

2619
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,113
I want to see what a kid is first.
What's it Kinda just looks like a 

2620
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:00,791
porcupine.
Oh,

2621
01:58:00,791 --> 01:58:04,440
it's better than a pole.
He Paul and looked it up.

2622
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:07,860
You should jacked again.
They've got this crazy big.

2623
01:58:09,090 --> 01:58:10,500
Only one a year again.
Jamie,

2624
01:58:11,970 --> 01:58:12,803
it's got a crazy beak.
It's got a crazy big sniffs out like 

2625
01:58:15,330 --> 01:58:19,280
ants in an ant mounds and it'll dig out 
the answer.

2626
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:21,390
It'll go.
It'll dig out and logs,

2627
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:23,220
sniffs them out and just look at that 
dude.

2628
01:58:24,910 --> 01:58:27,670
Yeah,
that's a kidnap.

2629
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:31,800
Me and the kids would just um,
there was one on the road the other day.

2630
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,170
Yeah.
It's got a peek.

2631
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:36,060
Yeah.
Like that kind of.

2632
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:39,500
That's definitely better than a 
hedgehog.

2633
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:41,740
What's that thing?
Get rid of it.

2634
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:47,170
Come on bird.
It's got a beak.

2635
01:58:47,171 --> 01:58:48,910
Like a bird.
It's pot sick.

2636
01:58:49,120 --> 01:58:51,320
Awesome animal.
Look at that.

2637
01:58:51,670 --> 01:58:53,520
What a fucking bizarre.
A little thing.

2638
01:58:53,650 --> 01:58:55,090
That was one on the road.
Digging the Alvin.

2639
01:58:55,100 --> 01:58:59,430
I owe a lot of the month now because 
I've been away for so long and a main.

2640
01:58:59,440 --> 01:59:00,700
The kids,
whenever we see them on the ride,

2641
01:59:00,701 --> 01:59:03,650
we will move them off the road and the 
kids got out and,

2642
01:59:03,820 --> 01:59:06,910
and you can actually hold ice box is 
super sharp,

2643
01:59:06,911 --> 01:59:10,210
but you can actually touch them because 
it's taken up so much room on your hand,

2644
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:10,781
like,
you know,

2645
01:59:10,781 --> 01:59:13,090
there's 100 spots and they chain you can
actually touch them.

2646
01:59:13,780 --> 01:59:14,760
And uh,
we,

2647
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,050
we moved this thing off the road and,
and I,

2648
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:18,890
and the kids were even normal about it.
I like,

2649
01:59:18,891 --> 01:59:19,810
oh yeah,
cool kid.

2650
01:59:19,811 --> 01:59:20,644
Now you know,
because they've seen them 100 times and 

2651
01:59:21,461 --> 01:59:22,294
I was like,
anyone that wasn't from Australia 

2652
01:59:23,591 --> 01:59:25,480
though,
that was saying this for the first time,

2653
01:59:25,481 --> 01:59:26,314
this animal with a beak,
when I started thinking about it and 

2654
01:59:27,971 --> 01:59:31,000
they turned back clothes like the 
clothes turn back like that.

2655
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:32,250
It's for digging,
right?

2656
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:34,600
Crazy.
As animal in the world.

2657
01:59:34,630 --> 01:59:36,190
When you think about it in that sense,
you know,

2658
01:59:36,191 --> 01:59:38,890
if you'd never ever seen one before and 
you come across it for the first time,

2659
01:59:38,891 --> 01:59:39,880
you'd be like,
Whoa,

2660
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:41,500
look at this thing.
This thing is crazy.

2661
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:42,550
Yeah.
It's like a porcupine.

2662
01:59:42,551 --> 01:59:44,260
Fuck the duck.
Right?

2663
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:47,840
It doesn't have a beak that's not a bad 
guy.

2664
01:59:47,900 --> 01:59:50,720
Platypus.
To their daily lives.

2665
01:59:50,740 --> 01:59:51,440
But there are a mammal.

2666
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,590
Yeah,
and they got like a big duck.

2667
01:59:53,591 --> 01:59:54,970
Big.
It's crazy.

2668
01:59:55,210 --> 01:59:58,030
But the laying of the eggs,
it's so strange.

2669
01:59:58,390 --> 02:00:00,970
Like what is that?
They've got a poisonous spark as well.

2670
02:00:01,030 --> 02:00:01,863
They do,
yeah.

2671
02:00:02,540 --> 02:00:03,373
Where is it on the night of them?
Might be like a anal spark or something 

2672
02:00:07,061 --> 02:00:09,350
like that.
Mm hmm.

2673
02:00:10,330 --> 02:00:11,170
Yeah.
Interesting.

2674
02:00:11,490 --> 02:00:13,920
So it probably wouldn't want to play 
around don't finger.

2675
02:00:13,940 --> 02:00:18,430
It's,
but just the wide variety of animal life

2676
02:00:18,431 --> 02:00:20,530
is very weird.
It's very weird.

2677
02:00:20,531 --> 02:00:22,060
When you think about how many different 
things,

2678
02:00:22,061 --> 02:00:22,894
and then again what you were talking 
about about the introduction of foxes 

2679
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:28,720
and cats.
They all fit into a system.

2680
02:00:28,721 --> 02:00:29,840
Like look at that thing.
There's A.

2681
02:00:30,150 --> 02:00:30,983
Yeah.
So it as like this funky kind of furry 

2682
02:00:33,131 --> 02:00:37,490
beaver looking tail.
It has the tiniest little dots for eyes.

2683
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:40,190
Webbed feet.
What?

2684
02:00:40,870 --> 02:00:43,030
Have you ever eaten beaver?
No.

2685
02:00:43,170 --> 02:00:45,520
Had beaver with Rinella.
It's really good.

2686
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:48,400
Really delicious.
It tastes like beef.

2687
02:00:48,520 --> 02:00:50,170
I didn't like the sand event.
I know.

2688
02:00:50,171 --> 02:00:51,004
I wouldn't either.
I wouldn't have normally even thought 

2689
02:00:52,810 --> 02:00:54,250
that you could eat it,
but uh,

2690
02:00:54,280 --> 02:00:55,113
he,
he killed one and then a braised it and 

2691
02:00:58,931 --> 02:00:59,764
then slow cooked it and it was like a 
pot roast with like potatoes and 

2692
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:05,260
carrots.
It was delicious.

2693
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:06,103
Thank the bear camp.
I could never ate a beaver because 

2694
02:01:09,851 --> 02:01:12,980
members of dead babies and bear camp.
Oh yeah.

2695
02:01:14,130 --> 02:01:15,890
It's the thought now.
Really?

2696
02:01:15,910 --> 02:01:16,780
Yeah.
I couldn't do it.

2697
02:01:16,900 --> 02:01:18,550
I could,
unless I was slightly hungry.

2698
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:23,580
I'll do it slightly telling you if 
Steven Rinella cooked you a bowl of this

2699
02:01:24,280 --> 02:01:26,380
beaver pot roast or whatever the fuck it
is.

2700
02:01:26,381 --> 02:01:27,610
They made.
It was amazing.

2701
02:01:27,611 --> 02:01:29,380
It was really good.
It sounds good.

2702
02:01:29,410 --> 02:01:31,540
It was like a,
like a strange beef,

2703
02:01:31,810 --> 02:01:34,120
like what an odd,
like maybe dry age beef.

2704
02:01:34,160 --> 02:01:35,680
Yeah.
Like tend to me off again.

2705
02:01:35,680 --> 02:01:39,650
Yeah.
Was like a beef from that was like,

2706
02:01:39,651 --> 02:01:42,230
all right,
this is beef from Nicaragua.

2707
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:43,730
Oh,
interesting.

2708
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:45,710
It's got a different flavor to it.
You know what I mean?

2709
02:01:45,820 --> 02:01:47,330
It's uh,
it's just,

2710
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:50,420
it's like it's reminiscent of beef,
like a cousin of beef.

2711
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:52,460
That's what it tastes like.
A cousin of the.

2712
02:01:52,580 --> 02:01:56,350
It's very weird and it's kind of fatty 
and it's Kinda like tender.

2713
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:57,293
Yeah.
Okay.

2714
02:01:57,610 --> 02:01:58,443
Steve,
we'll have to hook me up when I'm 

2715
02:01:59,061 --> 02:01:59,894
telling you you'd be shocked somewhere 
along the line they made it illegal to 

2716
02:02:03,741 --> 02:02:07,070
hunt them for food though they're a fur 
bearing animal,

2717
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:10,700
so you have to have a fur trappers 
license and America eat them.

2718
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:12,523
But there's people at the turn of the 
century like Rinella is amazing in his 

2719
02:02:15,741 --> 02:02:16,574
knowledge of the history of animals and 
America and the history of hunting in 

2720
02:02:20,091 --> 02:02:22,010
America.
But apparently many,

2721
02:02:22,011 --> 02:02:23,570
many,
many years ago,

2722
02:02:24,010 --> 02:02:26,930
um,
beaver trapping and beaver pelts were so

2723
02:02:26,931 --> 02:02:27,764
valuable that the richest man in the 
world in the early 18 hundreds made all 

2724
02:02:32,421 --> 02:02:34,280
of his money from beaver pelts.

2725
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:35,570
Really?
Yeah.

2726
02:02:36,080 --> 02:02:38,840
We should bring that back in.
Davis for law,

2727
02:02:38,930 --> 02:02:39,763
I think it was before felt and once they
came up with felt like for hats and 

2728
02:02:44,841 --> 02:02:47,180
stuff like that because the gentlemen 
war felt hats.

2729
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:52,540
They didn't need beaver as much anymore 
and beaver kind of fell out of favor and

2730
02:02:52,611 --> 02:02:57,200
people stopped,
stopped doing that to have big numbers.

2731
02:02:57,250 --> 02:02:59,150
The beaver population dropped at that 
time,

2732
02:03:00,550 --> 02:03:04,550
but yeah,
apparently behind animals,

2733
02:03:04,610 --> 02:03:05,443
you know when they've got that value on 
them and there's just an open slaughter 

2734
02:03:07,851 --> 02:03:10,310
is what seems to drive a lot of things 
to extinction.

2735
02:03:10,490 --> 02:03:11,323
Well,
that's one of the interesting things 

2736
02:03:12,411 --> 02:03:13,244
about America,
like if you buy elk or venison in 

2737
02:03:16,851 --> 02:03:19,340
America,
most of it is from New Zealand,

2738
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:20,623
which is really strange.
The reason is you can't like market 

2739
02:03:23,961 --> 02:03:24,794
hunting.
It was like a giant factor in the 

2740
02:03:29,210 --> 02:03:32,210
slaughter of countless amounts of 
buffalo,

2741
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,830
of elk and deer.

2742
02:03:33,830 --> 02:03:34,663
Even antelope,
like they killed everything back in the 

2743
02:03:37,190 --> 02:03:38,023
day and it was a lot of men returning 
from the war at the turn of the century 

2744
02:03:40,910 --> 02:03:43,770
that just went on these trips and that 
was.

2745
02:03:43,810 --> 02:03:45,140
That's the way that you could make 
money.

2746
02:03:45,380 --> 02:03:46,213
That way you can make money is a go go 
hunting for meat and that's when they 

2747
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:51,070
brought that to market.
Yeah,

2748
02:03:51,260 --> 02:03:52,093
I mean the.
I think the idea of these animals being 

2749
02:03:56,060 --> 02:03:59,900
precious and preserved and wild life,
the way we think of it,

2750
02:04:00,170 --> 02:04:02,360
they didn't have these thoughts in the 
18 hundreds.

2751
02:04:02,361 --> 02:04:03,194
They were just.
It was a resource and they just abused 

2752
02:04:05,181 --> 02:04:06,014
it and I just.
I mean we've all seen the photos of the 

2753
02:04:07,941 --> 02:04:09,370
stacks of buffaloes.
Yeah,

2754
02:04:09,390 --> 02:04:12,520
definitely a lot of religious for the 
hides where we oxidize.

2755
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:14,780
Definitely.
I think a lot of people think that still

2756
02:04:14,781 --> 02:04:18,620
happening today,
like hunt is a still that soda person.

2757
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:23,360
Whereas hunt is a.
The ultimate conservationist now and the

2758
02:04:23,361 --> 02:04:24,194
system that America has got in place is 
the best system anywhere in the world 

2759
02:04:26,931 --> 02:04:28,880
where there's a tag,
there's a season,

2760
02:04:29,150 --> 02:04:32,210
like they manage and regulate the 
population,

2761
02:04:32,211 --> 02:04:35,630
so,
so let's just say a elk.

2762
02:04:35,750 --> 02:04:38,310
The numbers were down

2763
02:04:38,580 --> 02:04:40,830
the following year we'll.
There'd be less tags available.

2764
02:04:41,190 --> 02:04:44,010
It's as simple as that and that's why 
it's such a good system.

2765
02:04:44,520 --> 02:04:47,520
In Australia we don't have that system 
in place,

2766
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:48,773
but in a sense it's pushed,
pushed all the responsibility back on 

2767
02:04:52,050 --> 02:04:52,883
hunters.
Like I can tell you now you Australian 

2768
02:04:55,171 --> 02:05:00,171
hunters are some of the best hunters in 
the world because they've got a conserve

2769
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,200
and they've got to manage their 
resources,

2770
02:05:04,260 --> 02:05:05,910
their self.
There's nothing in place to say,

2771
02:05:05,911 --> 02:05:06,744
well,
we're only given 500 tags away for that 

2772
02:05:08,611 --> 02:05:10,530
area this year.
Um,

2773
02:05:10,710 --> 02:05:11,543
because numbers are down,
Hannah's as much as we are conservation 

2774
02:05:14,970 --> 02:05:15,803
conservationists,
we're not going to go out and just 

2775
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:20,280
slaughter the numbers.
You know,

2776
02:05:20,340 --> 02:05:21,100
they're,
they're,

2777
02:05:21,100 --> 02:05:23,040
they're an introduced species into 
Australia.

2778
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,353
They are bad to the environment.
If the numbers are too big and Hannah's 

2779
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:30,040
treat them like that,
we were,

2780
02:05:30,090 --> 02:05:32,220
we're not going to go and wipe out the 
whole population.

2781
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,780
So,
um,

2782
02:05:34,230 --> 02:05:36,030
is a very good at,
uh,

2783
02:05:36,031 --> 02:05:36,864
you know,
there's only 20 bucks in this area at 

2784
02:05:38,701 --> 02:05:42,420
the moment and there's [inaudible] there
should be a certain buck to doe ratio.

2785
02:05:42,660 --> 02:05:44,910
There's only 20 bucks in this area at 
the moment.

2786
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:48,300
We're not going to kill 19 of them.
There's going to be one buck lift,

2787
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:49,223
you know,
we're going to kill the oldest buck in 

2788
02:05:50,011 --> 02:05:50,880
that area.
There's only 20.

2789
02:05:50,881 --> 02:05:51,714
They will,
let's just kill the oldest book in that 

2790
02:05:52,471 --> 02:05:53,850
area.
That's a good population.

2791
02:05:54,240 --> 02:05:55,980
Um,
it's sustainable.

2792
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:58,590
They're not damaging the environment in 
that number.

2793
02:05:58,940 --> 02:05:59,773
Um,
and I think there's a big difference 

2794
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:07,500
there between the American and the 
Australian hunter in that sense that,

2795
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:10,560
um,
you guys would do the same thing.

2796
02:06:10,650 --> 02:06:11,483
Don't get me wrong,
if there wasn't a tag in place or 

2797
02:06:13,021 --> 02:06:16,340
seasoned in place in today's society 
would do the same thing.

2798
02:06:16,350 --> 02:06:18,870
I think I've learned from the past some,
some would,

2799
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:19,793
but there's a bunch of people that 
wouldn't know that majority though the 

2800
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:24,410
majority,
but a,

2801
02:06:24,690 --> 02:06:27,180
I think there's quite a few that 
wouldn't,

2802
02:06:27,300 --> 02:06:28,940
you know,
that's,

2803
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:30,540
that's a,
I mean that,

2804
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:31,383
that is one of the,
the main stereotypes of the hunter is 

2805
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:35,843
beer drinking and shooting everything 
that moves and I feel today that it 

2806
02:06:40,021 --> 02:06:40,854
couldn't be further from the truth.
It seems like there's more of the 

2807
02:06:43,921 --> 02:06:47,450
responsible hunter,
the one that's got a good job or,

2808
02:06:47,700 --> 02:06:49,830
or,
or good business or whatever it is

2809
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:51,390
that goes out and,
and get.

2810
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,050
You'll be in the perfect example of 
that.

2811
02:06:53,051 --> 02:06:53,884
I wanted to thank you when I first come 
on the show that the light that you've 

2812
02:06:56,401 --> 02:07:00,040
shown on hunting is,
is how hunters are today.

2813
02:07:00,041 --> 02:07:00,874
The majority of hunters are today.
We're just not these savage kilo 

2814
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:04,630
machines that are just like,
yeah,

2815
02:07:04,631 --> 02:07:05,590
kill it,
you know,

2816
02:07:05,610 --> 02:07:07,780
we're,
we're very conservative in a sense.

2817
02:07:08,110 --> 02:07:09,870
Um,
you know,

2818
02:07:09,940 --> 02:07:10,773
wow.
It's not just about going out and 

2819
02:07:11,741 --> 02:07:12,574
getting a shot off.

2820
02:07:12,650 --> 02:07:15,170
If you are that sort of hunter,
I believe you're in it for all the wrong

2821
02:07:15,171 --> 02:07:18,080
reasons.
It's about the experience,

2822
02:07:18,081 --> 02:07:22,040
the connection with the outdoors that,
that meet,

2823
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:23,450
that precious meat,
you know,

2824
02:07:23,451 --> 02:07:25,700
that you'd get off each,
each one of those animals.

2825
02:07:25,970 --> 02:07:26,803
Also the money that we spend on gear,
the money that you spend on outfitters 

2826
02:07:30,541 --> 02:07:34,910
and trips that money in tags in 
particular all goes to conservation.

2827
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:36,160
Preserving the habitat

2828
02:07:36,160 --> 02:07:36,993
of these animals and a lot of these 
animals like especially like white tail 

2829
02:07:39,201 --> 02:07:40,034
deer.
There's more white tailed deer here in 

2830
02:07:41,591 --> 02:07:42,424
America today than there were when 
Columbus came here and some of the 

2831
02:07:44,891 --> 02:07:45,970
incomes,
all,

2832
02:07:45,971 --> 02:07:47,760
some of these small towns rely on,
right?

2833
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,890
Yes.
Is very haunting and something that I've

2834
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:51,724
always pushed because it's frowned upon 
it in Australia in a big way because 

2835
02:07:54,700 --> 02:07:57,060
it's not the typical thing to do.
Hunting's not.

2836
02:07:57,170 --> 02:07:59,230
It's not definitely not.
Definitely not.

2837
02:07:59,320 --> 02:08:01,420
And it's.
And it's not accepted like it is here in

2838
02:08:01,421 --> 02:08:03,100
America.
How did you get into it?

2839
02:08:03,530 --> 02:08:04,690
Oh,
you got myself into it,

2840
02:08:04,750 --> 02:08:05,980
which was really,
really weird.

2841
02:08:05,981 --> 02:08:07,900
Hoyt were asking me the same thing.
They lock off.

2842
02:08:07,901 --> 02:08:09,700
So did your dad hunt?
I'm like,

2843
02:08:09,940 --> 02:08:11,140
no,
you know,

2844
02:08:11,150 --> 02:08:14,130
like I come from a broken family,
um,

2845
02:08:14,260 --> 02:08:16,270
I seen a barber shop in a store and I 
was like,

2846
02:08:16,540 --> 02:08:18,550
um,
what's that thing?

2847
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:20,710
Because it was like a compound bow,
you know,

2848
02:08:20,711 --> 02:08:21,461
I'm like,
what's that thing?

2849
02:08:21,461 --> 02:08:21,941
And he's like,
oh,

2850
02:08:21,941 --> 02:08:22,774
it's a bow.
And so I ended up buying the bow and 

2851
02:08:26,110 --> 02:08:28,930
when I bought the bow he gave me like,
it was just a black and white magazine,

2852
02:08:28,931 --> 02:08:29,764
like I was 97 and then I'd run around 
with like a fiberglass pole with a 

2853
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:33,994
string.
Been on it before and used to make my 

2854
02:08:34,781 --> 02:08:36,160
own arrows,
like Robin Hood stuff,

2855
02:08:36,161 --> 02:08:38,920
you know,
but never had seen anything like that in

2856
02:08:38,921 --> 02:08:39,754
the magazine he gave me was a guy with a
massive big water buffalo on the front 

2857
02:08:44,351 --> 02:08:45,390
cover.
And I'm like,

2858
02:08:45,391 --> 02:08:47,580
you can kill things with this,
you know?

2859
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:50,200
And I was like,
the majority of people had never hunted,

2860
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,890
been like it like,
so you can kill a rabbit with one hour,

2861
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:55,220
but if you're gonna shoot a buffalo must
like take 20 Harris.

2862
02:08:55,880 --> 02:08:57,290
So I was like,
at the time,

2863
02:08:57,291 --> 02:08:58,124
I'm like,
he must have shot it like 20 times or 

2864
02:08:59,111 --> 02:08:59,944
something like that to kill it.
No rabbits got a pair of lungs above 

2865
02:09:02,621 --> 02:09:03,630
loads.
Got a pair of lungs,

2866
02:09:03,640 --> 02:09:05,260
you put an hole through both of those 
lungs.

2867
02:09:05,261 --> 02:09:07,060
That thing's dead in the same amount of 
time.

2868
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:10,810
Well now I've shot a bunch of Buffalo,
you know,

2869
02:09:10,811 --> 02:09:13,210
and it's just like,
that's the craziest thing,

2870
02:09:13,211 --> 02:09:14,044
isn't it?
It was just like it was a guy and a 

2871
02:09:15,131 --> 02:09:17,740
magazine with a buffalo dead.
And I was like,

2872
02:09:17,770 --> 02:09:20,770
you can kill things that and now 
unlocked this full blown hunter,

2873
02:09:21,160 --> 02:09:22,000
you know?
And it's just.

2874
02:09:22,060 --> 02:09:23,710
How did,
what was the process though?

2875
02:09:23,711 --> 02:09:26,260
So you got to go.
And did you take lessons?

2876
02:09:26,261 --> 02:09:27,094
Did you teach lessons?
Just taught myself with what year is 

2877
02:09:29,471 --> 02:09:31,030
this?
Um,

2878
02:09:31,910 --> 02:09:35,690
will all 17.
I'm 28.

2879
02:09:35,890 --> 02:09:38,860
I wish I was 2020 nights tomorrow.

2880
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:41,410
And just to heat right?
It's my birthday in Australia today,

2881
02:09:41,440 --> 02:09:43,870
so I'm 30,
36,

2882
02:09:44,170 --> 02:09:47,740
so I was 17 at the time,
so it would have been 97.

2883
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:50,550
So it's almost 20 years,
almost 20 years.

2884
02:09:50,570 --> 02:09:53,110
You're dealing with very little internet
back then,

2885
02:09:53,111 --> 02:09:54,460
right?
No Internet.

2886
02:09:54,530 --> 02:09:57,310
No.
So even though we invented Wifi,

2887
02:09:59,370 --> 02:10:01,870
you guys didn't have Australia.
We probably did.

2888
02:10:02,140 --> 02:10:03,190
Like I said,
I was poor.

2889
02:10:03,191 --> 02:10:04,480
I didn't know,
but you're not.

2890
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:06,670
My point is you're not getting any 
information.

2891
02:10:07,450 --> 02:10:08,160
Teaching.
Learn.

2892
02:10:08,160 --> 02:10:09,370
Oh,
your mistakes.

2893
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:10,233
That's what I was.
I actually was a big part of a bow 

2894
02:10:12,630 --> 02:10:13,463
hunting for ministry for many years and 
I just like if I had that when I was 

2895
02:10:17,261 --> 02:10:20,560
coming up through boning the time,
energy and money,

2896
02:10:20,561 --> 02:10:21,394
that all would've saved by,
by just getting the right information 

2897
02:10:24,731 --> 02:10:27,640
straight off the internet,
like being able to do research or,

2898
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,860
or even us going to a club and there's,
you know,

2899
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:34,130
there's 20 other guys at the club that 
you could at least information out of.

2900
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:38,540
I never had any of that,
but it's shit still got killed,

2901
02:10:38,860 --> 02:10:40,250
you know.
And that's what I always say to people.

2902
02:10:40,251 --> 02:10:40,730
You know,
you,

2903
02:10:40,730 --> 02:10:41,480
you,
you,

2904
02:10:41,480 --> 02:10:42,313
you don't need the best of everything.
If your budget can only afford you some 

2905
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:48,343
raker bow and some cheap arrows,
I guarantee you're still going to be 

2906
02:10:51,981 --> 02:10:55,190
successful with that gear if you put in 
the time,

2907
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:57,950
there's no doubt about it.
Um,

2908
02:10:58,490 --> 02:11:03,350
so I,
I just had this cheapo cheap arrows,

2909
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:04,633
probably didn't even wear camouflage at 
the time and just went out into the 

2910
02:11:07,941 --> 02:11:10,730
outdoors and just worked it out myself.
So,

2911
02:11:10,920 --> 02:11:13,310
prearranged finders,
free range finders.

2912
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:17,960
So how did you decide like where to aim?
It was a guest.

2913
02:11:17,961 --> 02:11:18,910
It was,
you'll use,

2914
02:11:19,290 --> 02:11:22,130
it was,
you're using your own knowledge,

2915
02:11:22,131 --> 02:11:22,964
you'll use in your own skills.
That's what sucks about someone today's 

2916
02:11:26,181 --> 02:11:28,370
technology in that,
because you lose that,

2917
02:11:28,371 --> 02:11:29,120
right?

2918
02:11:29,120 --> 02:11:31,670
You're using a range finder,
you're relying on the range finder.

2919
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:33,253
I still go out to the range sometimes 
where I'll just go around shooting 

2920
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:38,120
clumps across or whatever.
We've noted rangefinder.

2921
02:11:38,600 --> 02:11:40,660
Guess the distance have a shot than 
ranger.

2922
02:11:40,730 --> 02:11:44,030
Just just so you get to learn distances 
and know distances.

2923
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:46,880
Um,
I'm pretty good at like 30 yards.

2924
02:11:47,690 --> 02:11:50,720
10 not released.
I just did.

2925
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:52,640
Right.
So you do with your fingers.

2926
02:11:52,730 --> 02:11:55,180
When did you start using a release aid?
Um,

2927
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:59,000
I don't know what year it was,
but I'm 10 years in.

2928
02:11:59,120 --> 02:11:59,953
Yeah,
about 10 years in where you are making 

2929
02:12:01,341 --> 02:12:03,320
your own arrows.
Who was making it like mine?

2930
02:12:03,330 --> 02:12:04,240
Ours,
our team.

2931
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:06,160
The arrows.
Like you'd use team Barrows,

2932
02:12:06,161 --> 02:12:07,350
the big tube light.
Broader.

2933
02:12:07,740 --> 02:12:09,710
You're saying timber,
is that what you're saying?

2934
02:12:09,790 --> 02:12:11,110
Timber.
Timber like would.

2935
02:12:11,140 --> 02:12:11,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2936
02:12:11,720 --> 02:12:12,470
Okay.
Yeah.

2937
02:12:12,470 --> 02:12:14,810
So would arrows you making your own wood
arrows?

2938
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:15,703
Yeah.
You're cutting your own dowels and the 

2939
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:19,340
whole deal some guys did.
You'd be able to just buy,

2940
02:12:19,570 --> 02:12:20,403
you know,
like 12 Dale's already spawn that old 

2941
02:12:23,460 --> 02:12:26,910
respond tested to say 80 pounds.
And then you'd glue,

2942
02:12:26,911 --> 02:12:28,610
you brought it on your lap in the front 
up.

2943
02:12:28,670 --> 02:12:29,870
You'd glue your.
Brought it on,

2944
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:31,100
you glued it on?
Yeah.

2945
02:12:31,101 --> 02:12:34,320
Equally you brought it on.
No inserts.

2946
02:12:35,810 --> 02:12:36,643
And then feathers.
You'd use five inch feathers on 

2947
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:42,060
everything and just fingers on the 
strings.

2948
02:12:42,080 --> 02:12:44,780
Free figures on the string.
No sites or anything like that.

2949
02:12:44,781 --> 02:12:48,530
It was just one sided.
It was very instinctive shooting or some

2950
02:12:48,531 --> 02:12:52,100
guys would use the Arrow and line up 
down the road down there at the animal,

2951
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:55,130
but um,
a lot of the times were effective out to

2952
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:55,851
50,
60,

2953
02:12:55,851 --> 02:12:57,920
70 meters.
If you did enough practice,

2954
02:12:57,950 --> 02:12:59,870
you will still effective out to those 
ranges,

2955
02:12:59,871 --> 02:13:01,430
but it took a lot more time.

2956
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:05,210
Did you wear your arrows and where your 
broadheads way arrows and broader.

2957
02:13:05,360 --> 02:13:07,700
So you've kind of kept him in a certain 
range.

2958
02:13:07,760 --> 02:13:09,500
Yeah.
You keep them all identical.

2959
02:13:09,501 --> 02:13:12,160
You'd spin testimonial when.
Why want you put your broad it on him?

2960
02:13:12,510 --> 02:13:13,343
I'm good.
You could get spawned as back in those 

2961
02:13:15,561 --> 02:13:16,394
days and you'd buy and test them and 
you'd turn your shop to get to the 

2962
02:13:19,131 --> 02:13:21,230
closest spinal.
Wouldn't be perfect on each one.

2963
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:25,100
We're talking timber here and you get 
your spine pretty accurate on each one.

2964
02:13:25,101 --> 02:13:26,930
You'd glue your.
Brought it on in that sense.

2965
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:27,820
And yet.
And your,

2966
02:13:28,400 --> 02:13:29,720
uh,
your knock as well.

2967
02:13:30,170 --> 02:13:33,360
So everyone was spine the same.
Up and down.

2968
02:13:33,361 --> 02:13:34,530
Yeah.
Wow.

2969
02:13:34,590 --> 02:13:35,880
Two years.
Sam.

2970
02:13:35,970 --> 02:13:37,410
Pioneer.
Simple.

2971
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:39,680
Oh yeah.
That's a funny thing.

2972
02:13:39,800 --> 02:13:40,633
Like a mountain man,
trappers and came over here on beaver 

2973
02:13:43,561 --> 02:13:48,150
skin Qa practice a lot so I can go,
I'll go,

2974
02:13:48,650 --> 02:13:53,650
I'll get the height defiant there and 
all site that bow in and yeah,

2975
02:13:54,280 --> 02:13:56,490
I can,
I'll just shoot once a week or whatever,

2976
02:13:56,910 --> 02:13:58,650
you know,
if I can shoot daily I will.

2977
02:13:58,650 --> 02:14:01,500
But with traditional gear you had to 
shoot daily.

2978
02:14:01,830 --> 02:14:02,663
You had to have either 50 or 100 hours 
every single day just just to keep the 

2979
02:14:06,361 --> 02:14:07,860
skill level up.
Um,

2980
02:14:07,910 --> 02:14:10,510
and it was same shooting a bow that was 
open sites,

2981
02:14:10,710 --> 02:14:12,570
no sites or anything like that.
And fingers.

2982
02:14:12,571 --> 02:14:14,820
You had to constantly shoot that boat to
be,

2983
02:14:15,030 --> 02:14:15,863
to be accurate.
So it's almost like throwing a rock in 

2984
02:14:17,531 --> 02:14:21,360
that you've got to kind of have a sense 
of how far it's gonna go with the amount

2985
02:14:21,361 --> 02:14:22,380
of effort.
Exactly.

2986
02:14:22,381 --> 02:14:23,420
Like thrown a rock.
Yeah.

2987
02:14:23,490 --> 02:14:27,330
Where to pick it up so that if you know 
it's a certain distance away,

2988
02:14:27,331 --> 02:14:29,580
you know,
you kind of in your head know the arc of

2989
02:14:29,581 --> 02:14:30,414
the era.
I wouldn't get a new boss every year 

2990
02:14:31,890 --> 02:14:34,560
because I would walk.
If you've got a new bow,

2991
02:14:34,561 --> 02:14:37,840
you had to start all over again,
whereas I knew the costs of that bow,

2992
02:14:37,841 --> 02:14:39,220
you know,
I know we're an RFL.

2993
02:14:39,450 --> 02:14:42,350
I know we're in our flat too.
Um,

2994
02:14:43,170 --> 02:14:45,090
but like I said,
you hunting,

2995
02:14:45,290 --> 02:14:48,660
I used to kill just as much back then as
I do today with today's technology.

2996
02:14:48,661 --> 02:14:51,480
But I've got to spend less time with 
today's technology.

2997
02:14:51,780 --> 02:14:53,250
Well,
you're also in Australia,

2998
02:14:53,251 --> 02:14:55,090
which is very different because you were
what you were saying.

2999
02:14:55,200 --> 02:14:57,180
You can only eat brown.
You can hunt all year round.

3000
02:14:57,181 --> 02:14:58,014
You can shoot things every day.
You could shoot as many animals as you 

3001
02:14:59,701 --> 02:15:00,570
want.
Exactly.

3002
02:15:00,690 --> 02:15:03,030
So you could go out and one day and 
killed 12 dear.

3003
02:15:03,450 --> 02:15:04,283
And that's fine.
You just take them and give them your 

3004
02:15:05,821 --> 02:15:07,410
friends.
It wouldn't if you,

3005
02:15:07,630 --> 02:15:09,750
you wouldn't,
unless you were just calling because the

3006
02:15:09,751 --> 02:15:13,320
numbers have got a badge.
I'm lucky you could,

3007
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:17,110
you could,
you definitely could get and it'd be no.

3008
02:15:17,600 --> 02:15:20,360
And then you just have a lot of friends 
and just get given to me.

3009
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:21,233
He had.

3010
02:15:23,250 --> 02:15:23,870
Do you,
uh,

3011
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:25,350
do you wind up giving a lot of your meat
away?

3012
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:26,860
Heaps.
He heaps,

3013
02:15:26,890 --> 02:15:28,180
Yep.
Um,

3014
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:29,613
I liked shooting a deer,
why they fat so before they go into the 

3015
02:15:31,501 --> 02:15:32,334
rotc because they go into the rotc fat 
and they come out looking like a grey 

3016
02:15:34,901 --> 02:15:35,840
hound,
you know,

3017
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:38,310
they just,
they just lost so much condition.

3018
02:15:38,850 --> 02:15:39,683
Um,
so I like to shoot a couple of days 

3019
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:41,633
before the Rock and um,
they've also got a lot of fat on him at 

3020
02:15:44,791 --> 02:15:45,624
that point,
which is really good for making 

3021
02:15:46,201 --> 02:15:47,970
sausages.
I lock my command and sausages,

3022
02:15:48,660 --> 02:15:49,493
I'll feel the phrase with that.
And then I've just got a list of just 

3023
02:15:51,721 --> 02:15:53,270
family,
like put friends aside.

3024
02:15:53,280 --> 02:15:55,650
I've just got a list of family that will
take the meat off me,

3025
02:15:56,760 --> 02:15:57,593
which is really good because especially 
with the da that a lot of the teammate 

3026
02:15:59,920 --> 02:16:00,753
gets all used,
some of that big mountain bowls and 

3027
02:16:03,241 --> 02:16:06,540
things like that.
I'm not a big fan of eight.

3028
02:16:06,541 --> 02:16:07,960
And then big rank bowl is,
you know,

3029
02:16:07,970 --> 02:16:08,803
it's just,
it's super super gaming but still 

3030
02:16:11,041 --> 02:16:11,874
doesn't go to waste.
It's doug made or it goes back in the 

3031
02:16:13,480 --> 02:16:16,620
mother nature right there.
And then have you ever brined them?

3032
02:16:16,680 --> 02:16:19,800
Like Brian,
a board had going to try my buddy,

3033
02:16:19,801 --> 02:16:22,490
Antonio does all that sort of stuff and 
he makes those um,

3034
02:16:23,060 --> 02:16:24,440
like,
like big cranks,

3035
02:16:24,770 --> 02:16:27,110
sausages,
like a cured sausage man.

3036
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:29,100
Delicious or some.
Yeah.

3037
02:16:29,110 --> 02:16:30,100
Apparently like

3038
02:16:30,100 --> 02:16:33,250
if you cook them well those old boards 
are really delicious.

3039
02:16:33,251 --> 02:16:36,400
You just have to know how to like brine 
them and cook them.

3040
02:16:36,401 --> 02:16:38,100
Well,
the Europeans love them.

3041
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:40,840
Yeah.
So we've got our professional like pig,

3042
02:16:40,890 --> 02:16:44,320
his back home that hunt for human 
consumption.

3043
02:16:44,321 --> 02:16:45,154
They make goes to humans and consumption
and the majority of it gets sent 

3044
02:16:48,011 --> 02:16:48,844
overseas.
Like they love it and they pay big 

3045
02:16:49,811 --> 02:16:50,970
dollars for it.
Are they,

3046
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:51,843
how do they consume it?
Like about sausage or anything I 

3047
02:16:54,950 --> 02:16:56,080
suppose.
I think the whole,

3048
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:58,450
the whole animal gets shipped right,
but I wonder what they,

3049
02:16:58,630 --> 02:16:59,463
how they mainly eat it.
Denying him the rod is a crazy thing 

3050
02:17:03,941 --> 02:17:05,600
man.
And most people aren't aware of,

3051
02:17:05,610 --> 02:17:09,010
but deer and elk and I guess stags,
a lot of those other animals,

3052
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:11,930
they only have sex once a year,
so all year.

3053
02:17:14,020 --> 02:17:17,260
But what a crazy design like nature has 
it set up.

3054
02:17:17,290 --> 02:17:19,210
So most of the here,
they're not even horn.

3055
02:17:19,211 --> 02:17:20,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

3056
02:17:20,290 --> 02:17:24,940
Then one time a year they lose their 
fucking minds.

3057
02:17:24,941 --> 02:17:28,060
It's just crazy.
I don't drink.

3058
02:17:28,120 --> 02:17:31,270
That's the only thing on their mind.
Just go ballistic all day long.

3059
02:17:31,330 --> 02:17:33,790
Sometimes all night long.
I've never hunted deer in the Rut.

3060
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:35,860
I've only hunted deer,
you know,

3061
02:17:36,100 --> 02:17:38,230
in Wisconsin in season.
And uh,

3062
02:17:38,320 --> 02:17:42,160
in Montana we hunted deer and they 
weren't in the Rut,

3063
02:17:42,460 --> 02:17:44,560
but apparently when they're in the Rut 
they lose their marbles.

3064
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:45,753
But I've seen elk in the Rut and it's 
the most bizarre thing kind of in 

3065
02:17:49,990 --> 02:17:52,880
control that tongue anymore.
Just hanging out there.

3066
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:55,540
Dick is flopping up and down when they 
scream,

3067
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:59,260
literally they have a rod going all the 
time that isn't all over their chest.

3068
02:17:59,560 --> 02:18:01,650
They're screaming at the top of their 
lungs.

3069
02:18:02,170 --> 02:18:05,410
It's a red stags.
I put their head between their legs,

3070
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:07,660
look there in the.
That put the head between their legs.

3071
02:18:07,950 --> 02:18:12,950
They piss in their mouth,
they hold the bolt in the mouse Gogol it

3072
02:18:13,090 --> 02:18:14,950
as I tried along because my oldest 
brother,

3073
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:15,793
he goes all over their body.
So I could imagine doing that before 

3074
02:18:18,161 --> 02:18:18,994
sex.
Like,

3075
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:20,473
yeah,
I just got to get these done by pissing 

3076
02:18:22,061 --> 02:18:24,970
my math is right.
I got to get ready baby.

3077
02:18:25,180 --> 02:18:28,570
You know how I feel about you off when 
that happens.

3078
02:18:28,571 --> 02:18:30,280
Like they have prints in there and look,
I'm king.

3079
02:18:30,281 --> 02:18:32,650
Shit.
Wonder what that's all about.

3080
02:18:32,651 --> 02:18:33,484
Like what kind of evolutionary 
advantages there to pissing in your own 

3081
02:18:35,831 --> 02:18:36,664
mouth and spraying it up and regular we 
ever done that and then they're just 

3082
02:18:38,741 --> 02:18:39,101
like,
you know,

3083
02:18:39,101 --> 02:18:42,640
we're not going to write this bidding 
anymore because it's just drastic.

3084
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:43,400
We really don't need it.

3085
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:45,250
It's not benefit.
You'd get yellow teeth.

3086
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:48,700
You just lie on your shoulders with your
ass up in the air.

3087
02:18:48,950 --> 02:18:51,790
Just with his hold on the back of your 
knees.

3088
02:18:51,791 --> 02:18:56,791
You've got a scoop them.
Would it pull you towards a.

3089
02:18:57,490 --> 02:18:59,530
it's hard,
but it's awesome to say.

3090
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,740
I got to see the.
See if you could find that.

3091
02:19:02,741 --> 02:19:04,420
Is it a red deer?
Red Deer?

3092
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:06,030
I think at Rusa.
Dave won't do it.

3093
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:07,700
Two days.
Super mediated it.

3094
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:10,250
They're the ones that roar like a lion.
Yeah.

3095
02:19:10,690 --> 02:19:11,523
What a weird fucking noise that is so 
painful that a lot of people don't even 

3096
02:19:14,741 --> 02:19:15,574
realize is deer in Australia.
There's six spaces in Australia and 

3097
02:19:18,101 --> 02:19:20,380
they'll go out camping and now he that 
and they've,

3098
02:19:20,830 --> 02:19:21,401
you know,
they're like,

3099
02:19:21,401 --> 02:19:23,710
oh there's a big cat in Australia,
you know,

3100
02:19:23,711 --> 02:19:25,210
like,
cause that's like a bit of a myth,

3101
02:19:25,240 --> 02:19:26,073
you know,
like there's big cats in Australia and 

3102
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,880
that's what makes it,
a lot of people think of it,

3103
02:19:28,881 --> 02:19:29,420
you know,
they're like,

3104
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:30,260
we're scared shitless.

3105
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:31,610
We couldn't sleep last night.
And I'm like,

3106
02:19:31,611 --> 02:19:32,750
where was,
where's the spot?

3107
02:19:32,751 --> 02:19:34,760
I want to know where the bodies,
because I know it's a deer.

3108
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:36,950
Yeah.
Well did you hear that?

3109
02:19:36,951 --> 02:19:39,380
There was a rumor for like years and 
years and years.

3110
02:19:39,381 --> 02:19:40,214
People had talked about spotting big 
cats in the UK and then they found out 

3111
02:19:44,131 --> 02:19:47,490
that there was a fucking sanctuary that 
released brands.

3112
02:19:47,560 --> 02:19:49,280
Yes.
They just admitted to it.

3113
02:19:49,281 --> 02:19:52,580
Then in the nineties,
I think the late eighties or nineties,

3114
02:19:52,581 --> 02:19:56,830
they had released like a couple of Pumas
in the UK countryside.

3115
02:19:56,840 --> 02:20:00,620
So in this system is Puma Puma's?
No,

3116
02:20:00,621 --> 02:20:04,100
like the Sneaker Puma,
like welcome to America.

3117
02:20:04,310 --> 02:20:05,000
Oh,
here he is.

3118
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,120
He's pissing.
Oh yeah,

3119
02:20:06,250 --> 02:20:09,660
like he's pissing in his fucking mouth.
Oh,

3120
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:11,780
what in the hell?
And he loves it.

3121
02:20:11,900 --> 02:20:13,260
So he tried it.
That knock it,

3122
02:20:13,340 --> 02:20:14,500
give it a go.
Uh,

3123
02:20:14,750 --> 02:20:16,250
no.
He's pissing all over himself.

3124
02:20:16,280 --> 02:20:19,100
He doesn't even look like you're doing 
it for the fuck of it.

3125
02:20:19,670 --> 02:20:20,840
You don't think he's in the Rut?
Not.

3126
02:20:20,990 --> 02:20:21,823
There's another stag there.
You should be beating the shit out of 

3127
02:20:22,941 --> 02:20:24,170
it,
but he's a little one now.

3128
02:20:24,260 --> 02:20:25,093
The other stag is big.
He probably got to be real careful with 

3129
02:20:27,300 --> 02:20:29,960
that other dude.
Are they not doing it right?

3130
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:32,840
A piston right in his mouth so he can 
go.

3131
02:20:33,230 --> 02:20:34,670
Well,
that's the thing in New Zealand,

3132
02:20:34,970 --> 02:20:35,803
New Zealand,
a lot of the stags or they're high 

3133
02:20:37,611 --> 02:20:39,080
fence.
I hide it.

3134
02:20:39,140 --> 02:20:41,210
I don't want to piss off some Honda's at
Dewa,

3135
02:20:41,211 --> 02:20:42,044
but closed range is against everything 
that I'm about because it's a fight 

3136
02:20:46,371 --> 02:20:47,204
currency for what hunting is.
You get these massive big red stags and 

3137
02:20:50,241 --> 02:20:54,250
just crazy inches on top of inches.
No one ever writes a.

3138
02:20:54,290 --> 02:20:56,870
This is the close range stag that I shot
in New Zealand.

3139
02:20:57,410 --> 02:20:58,850
No one ever writes out,
they're just like,

3140
02:20:58,851 --> 02:20:59,684
oh,
I've got a big red stag and I Blah Blah 

3141
02:21:00,621 --> 02:21:01,454
Blah and so many hunters that that 
aren't educated in that sense and I'm 

3142
02:21:05,451 --> 02:21:07,160
not having a stab at them from not being
educated.

3143
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:09,980
They shouldn't have to be in that sense.
Looking at that cow and all that.

3144
02:21:09,981 --> 02:21:13,100
That's what you can expect when you go 
to New Zealand or Australia.

3145
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:17,420
Now it's frigging they append animals 
and they feed them high protein,

3146
02:21:17,900 --> 02:21:21,050
high protein food there.
They've been genetically bred.

3147
02:21:21,470 --> 02:21:22,303
It's just all that crazy shit that's the
fight currency of a red stag in 

3148
02:21:26,331 --> 02:21:27,920
Australia and New Zealand,
free range,

3149
02:21:27,921 --> 02:21:28,754
red stags on like that.
If you should afraid Ryan's red stag 

3150
02:21:30,471 --> 02:21:33,740
like that in Australia and New Zealand,
that's going to be the record.

3151
02:21:34,390 --> 02:21:37,220
That's going to be the absolute record.
That's not the true.

3152
02:21:37,940 --> 02:21:38,773
That's not the example of what you can 
expect if you come to Australia or New 

3153
02:21:42,020 --> 02:21:43,960
Zealand and hunt free range.
Isn't that the.

3154
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,813
That's the difference between free range
and fair chase and these high fence 

3155
02:21:48,831 --> 02:21:53,480
operations and it's very.
It's a very contentious argument because

3156
02:21:53,810 --> 02:21:57,820
a lot of people growing these white tail
deer in America and they're,

3157
02:21:57,830 --> 02:21:58,663
again,
they're introducing this crazy foods to 

3158
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:00,593
their diet and they're growing these 
ridiculous racks that don't even look 

3159
02:22:03,141 --> 02:22:06,800
like racks,
like bushes growing out of their hat and

3160
02:22:06,801 --> 02:22:08,030
they looked so fake.
Yeah.

3161
02:22:08,031 --> 02:22:10,850
I don't think they're ugly.
They are ugly joy looking at it.

3162
02:22:10,851 --> 02:22:13,090
I don't enjoy looking at it either.
It looks weird.

3163
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:13,933
It's like some sort of a strange weird 
bred dog or something like when you see 

3164
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:21,290
their antlers and you know there are 290
inch white tails,

3165
02:22:21,291 --> 02:22:22,124
like what is that?
It should because hunting should be so 

3166
02:22:24,591 --> 02:22:26,130
natural and that's so far

3167
02:22:26,130 --> 02:22:27,990
from being natural,
especially when it's wildlife.

3168
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:28,853
Not talking about walking around with a 
stick and a string that you've carved 

3169
02:22:30,781 --> 02:22:31,614
out of a tree yourself.
I'm talking about just a natural 

3170
02:22:34,351 --> 02:22:36,690
environment.
Landscape and animal.

3171
02:22:36,940 --> 02:22:39,750
Yeah,
well animals that are living in the wild

3172
02:22:40,190 --> 02:22:41,023
literally no interaction with people 
other than when the hunter and 

3173
02:22:43,460 --> 02:22:44,293
especially what you're dealing with 
because you're dealing with very few 

3174
02:22:46,711 --> 02:22:51,600
hunters and like expansive areas where 
very few people even go into.

3175
02:22:51,650 --> 02:22:52,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

3176
02:22:52,420 --> 02:22:54,510
And I don't muck around and they see you
and they're gone like that.

3177
02:22:54,511 --> 02:22:55,680
There's no like,
oh,

3178
02:22:55,681 --> 02:22:59,310
that's what that dude might have food.
Nice pocket over there.

3179
02:22:59,320 --> 02:23:00,240
No feed.
No.

3180
02:23:00,600 --> 02:23:01,380
They're like,
what?

3181
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:02,213
The goal is another big issue in America
where they have these feeders and these 

3182
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:09,760
people,
they put a blind outside of a feeder and

3183
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:10,613
the feeder goes off at a certain time 
and these people sit in the blind and 

3184
02:23:13,171 --> 02:23:16,530
wait for the feeder go off because it 
near program to come towards the feet or

3185
02:23:16,531 --> 02:23:17,970
when it's going off and you just whack 
them.

3186
02:23:18,060 --> 02:23:20,010
Yeah.
I'm not interested in that myself,

3187
02:23:20,011 --> 02:23:21,810
but I don't,
I don't frown upon it.

3188
02:23:21,930 --> 02:23:23,510
Like they call it biting.
Right.

3189
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:26,610
Well what it is is it's like meat 
acquisition.

3190
02:23:26,670 --> 02:23:28,050
It's not really hunting.
I mean,

3191
02:23:28,051 --> 02:23:28,884
it's probably better for the animal and 
they have put the effort in that set 

3192
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:34,100
that up right and true about animals.
So it's a little bit like,

3193
02:23:34,230 --> 02:23:35,910
like I said,
it's not my style of hunting,

3194
02:23:35,911 --> 02:23:39,510
but that is the free range thing really 
gets me.

3195
02:23:39,511 --> 02:23:41,970
I don't want to go on about it because 
I'm going to upset too many people,

3196
02:23:41,971 --> 02:23:42,804
but I know what you're saying,
but think about what you were saying 

3197
02:23:44,581 --> 02:23:46,410
earlier about your experience in 
Montana.

3198
02:23:46,630 --> 02:23:47,321
You're,
you know,

3199
02:23:47,321 --> 02:23:51,270
11 days in 12 miles deep into the woods 
by yourself.

3200
02:23:51,480 --> 02:23:52,700
That's the real deal.
Yeah.

3201
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,110
Yeah.
I mean that is as real as it gets.

3202
02:23:55,380 --> 02:23:57,340
But this a thing about hunting where,
you know,

3203
02:23:57,360 --> 02:23:58,193
people that are really into bowhunting,
look down on people that shoot with a 

3204
02:24:00,331 --> 02:24:01,140
rifle.

3205
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:04,620
People that are really into wilderness 
hunting and fair chase.

3206
02:24:04,621 --> 02:24:06,540
Look down on people that hunt high 
fence.

3207
02:24:06,541 --> 02:24:09,720
And I a,
I get the arguments.

3208
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:10,593
Um,
I even get the arguments for some high 

3209
02:24:11,701 --> 02:24:12,534
fence.
Like friend of mine went to this high 

3210
02:24:13,861 --> 02:24:17,010
fence operation and taxes and I was 
like,

3211
02:24:17,011 --> 02:24:17,844
man,
that seems kind of crazy that these 

3212
02:24:18,541 --> 02:24:19,680
animals are all pending.
He's like,

3213
02:24:19,681 --> 02:24:21,540
it's 10,000
acres.

3214
02:24:22,020 --> 02:24:23,340
He's like,
defense circles,

3215
02:24:23,370 --> 02:24:24,630
10,000
acres.

3216
02:24:24,631 --> 02:24:25,800
He goes,
they put their on.

3217
02:24:26,090 --> 02:24:29,610
Well the genetical,
their access deer and all sorts of fun.

3218
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:34,050
Like Neil guy and all sorts of weird and
foreign species.

3219
02:24:34,051 --> 02:24:34,471
He's like,
yeah,

3220
02:24:34,471 --> 02:24:36,990
they have been put there,
but they're,

3221
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,300
they're wild.
They're Roman wild.

3222
02:24:39,301 --> 02:24:40,140
I'm like,
Oh man,

3223
02:24:40,141 --> 02:24:42,300
that's a weird argument.
Then because I get it.

3224
02:24:42,390 --> 02:24:45,930
I mean like I'm not totally like if I 
needed to hunt for meat,

3225
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:47,070
it's a good way to do it.

3226
02:24:47,070 --> 02:24:49,020
Right.
Even if it's only a few hundred acres,

3227
02:24:49,021 --> 02:24:50,020
you know,
the animals are there,

3228
02:24:50,040 --> 02:24:51,600
you just go find them and get them for 
meat.

3229
02:24:52,650 --> 02:24:54,180
But even if it's 10,000
acres,

3230
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:58,770
at what range is it really wild?
Is it wild at 50,000

3231
02:24:58,771 --> 02:25:01,500
acres?
Is it wired into wild at 100,000

3232
02:25:01,501 --> 02:25:03,120
acres?
Like if it's fenced in,

3233
02:25:03,121 --> 02:25:06,840
if there's a fence anywhere.
For me it's just gotta be unfenced fence

3234
02:25:06,841 --> 02:25:08,580
period.
So when I went to Africa,

3235
02:25:08,970 --> 02:25:09,803
I've got,
I've got pretty stitched up when I went 

3236
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,170
to Africa and it was because it's just 
like an operation,

3237
02:25:13,171 --> 02:25:16,050
it's just an income for him stitched up.
What do you mean by that?

3238
02:25:16,260 --> 02:25:18,300
Stitched up fucked over.
Oh yeah,

3239
02:25:18,330 --> 02:25:20,520
yeah.
By the outfit of there,

3240
02:25:20,550 --> 02:25:22,380
like he was just,
he was a con artist,

3241
02:25:22,381 --> 02:25:24,200
bicycling.
But um,

3242
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:25,563
I don't want to go into too much detail,
but so all is supposed to go straight 

3243
02:25:27,911 --> 02:25:29,920
into the Zimbabwean hunt.
Buffalo,

3244
02:25:29,921 --> 02:25:33,040
Cape Buffalo and those are dangerous.
Yeah.

3245
02:25:33,041 --> 02:25:34,480
Before I got there,
he took me to,

3246
02:25:34,481 --> 02:25:35,314
he's like call them branches or whatever
there and it's all that means is high 

3247
02:25:39,131 --> 02:25:39,964
fence operation in the South Africa and 
I understand parts of South Africa 

3248
02:25:43,031 --> 02:25:43,864
because it has bred animals that are on 
the brink of extinction and then it's 

3249
02:25:48,581 --> 02:25:51,400
good for them because they're there now,
but it's just not familiar me that close

3250
02:25:51,401 --> 02:25:53,350
range hunting and everything's closed 
range,

3251
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:54,303
you know,
it's just,

3252
02:25:54,780 --> 02:25:55,613
I,
I absolutely hated it because I just 

3253
02:25:56,741 --> 02:25:58,480
want an animal that's,
that's,

3254
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:01,470
that's there naturally,
um,

3255
02:26:01,780 --> 02:26:05,620
or has not been genetically bred or 
brought in or anything like that.

3256
02:26:05,621 --> 02:26:07,870
And before I got there these guys were 
like,

3257
02:26:07,871 --> 02:26:11,180
what size buffalo do you want to shoot?
And I'm like,

3258
02:26:11,181 --> 02:26:12,014
well,
we'll just see what the big for the 

3259
02:26:12,641 --> 02:26:13,300
area.

3260
02:26:13,300 --> 02:26:14,133
Like that's all you can do.
You can only shoot the big animal for 

3261
02:26:15,791 --> 02:26:16,624
the area if you're after an old animal 
or a trophy and we can't shoot what's 

3262
02:26:18,851 --> 02:26:21,730
big for that area.
So usually I spend the first half of the

3263
02:26:21,731 --> 02:26:25,540
trip understanding what's a big animal 
or an old animal for the area.

3264
02:26:26,230 --> 02:26:27,880
Then you'll have it for the other half 
of the trip.

3265
02:26:28,510 --> 02:26:29,590
They like,
what size?

3266
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:31,300
Buffalo do you want to shoot?
Well,

3267
02:26:31,850 --> 02:26:33,850
let's just say what's big for the area.
Oh No,

3268
02:26:33,851 --> 02:26:36,580
we'll just bring one in on truck before 
you get here.

3269
02:26:36,581 --> 02:26:39,010
You just tell us what size you want.
We'll bring it in and release it.

3270
02:26:39,250 --> 02:26:42,040
What the fuck.
If I'm going to do that,

3271
02:26:42,041 --> 02:26:45,310
I'm going to go to a farm and say,
can I buy that cow and cut it up for me?

3272
02:26:46,050 --> 02:26:47,620
Right.
So,

3273
02:26:47,720 --> 02:26:49,740
so,
so that's a little bit on,

3274
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:52,700
on lease that operation in South Africa.

3275
02:26:52,700 --> 02:26:54,940
I'm not saying they're all like that.
There's a lot of them like that.

3276
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:55,803
There is a lot of them like that and 
then I end up paying extra because I'm 

3277
02:26:59,341 --> 02:26:59,850
like,
no,

3278
02:26:59,850 --> 02:27:00,683
if I've got a hunt free range,
it's the only way I'm going to hunt and 

3279
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:06,880
that's what I was coming here for.
100 free range a Cape Buffalo.

3280
02:27:07,570 --> 02:27:10,960
Then we ended up in Mozambique in 
another place where we didn't say a bowl

3281
02:27:10,961 --> 02:27:14,110
for 10 days.
The outfitter,

3282
02:27:14,111 --> 02:27:16,990
he'd never been to that place or or he'd
never taken a.

3283
02:27:16,991 --> 02:27:18,460
have a hunters.
They are or anything like that.

3284
02:27:18,461 --> 02:27:22,150
And I got there and,
and the whole time he was like,

3285
02:27:22,151 --> 02:27:22,890
yeah,
no,

3286
02:27:22,890 --> 02:27:24,550
you know,
this is a real good area.

3287
02:27:24,551 --> 02:27:25,384
You'll tag are straight away.
You will see hundreds of buffalo every 

3288
02:27:27,580 --> 02:27:28,210
day.
And like I said,

3289
02:27:28,210 --> 02:27:29,970
10 days later we hadn't even seen a 
book.

3290
02:27:30,520 --> 02:27:31,540
So,
um,

3291
02:27:32,150 --> 02:27:32,760
yeah,
it was,

3292
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:33,470
it's,
it's,

3293
02:27:33,470 --> 02:27:36,640
it's a horrible industry over there in 
that sense.

3294
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:38,260
It's,
it's an,

3295
02:27:38,261 --> 02:27:39,094
it couldn't be a blame as well.
I should've done more research on that 

3296
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:42,970
outfitter.
Um,

3297
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:43,833
but I,
but I won that hunt for a charity 

3298
02:27:45,011 --> 02:27:45,844
auction.
It wasn't the sort of thing that I was 

3299
02:27:47,111 --> 02:27:48,010
like,
you know,

3300
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:49,113
research and for weeks and weeks trying 
to find a good outfit or to go through 

3301
02:27:52,081 --> 02:27:54,890
and shoot a Cape Buffalo so that,
that was speed.

3302
02:27:54,940 --> 02:27:55,773
Unfortunately.
Yes.

3303
02:27:55,880 --> 02:27:56,713
There's an amazing documentary on it 
from Louis Theroux who's a wildlife or 

3304
02:28:00,890 --> 02:28:04,910
rather a documentary in from the UK.
Great Guy who,

3305
02:28:04,911 --> 02:28:06,860
um,
who's been on the podcast a couple times

3306
02:28:06,861 --> 02:28:09,380
and talked about it the first time.
But uh,

3307
02:28:09,410 --> 02:28:13,430
it's all about these African high fence 
hunting trips.

3308
02:28:13,550 --> 02:28:14,383
And he was over there for a long time 
and got the guy to kind of explain 

3309
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:21,200
exactly what's going on over there,
but it was just really bizarre.

3310
02:28:21,320 --> 02:28:22,100
See people,

3311
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:22,933
you know they're there.
They had these lions and they had them 

3312
02:28:26,710 --> 02:28:28,350
like right there.
I mean there were,

3313
02:28:28,400 --> 02:28:29,233
there was two cents of fences,
one fence and the fence right behind it 

3314
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:32,233
and they took a dead calf and they throw
it over the fence and then watch the 

3315
02:28:34,251 --> 02:28:35,084
lions tear it apart.
But you're looking at the lines of 

3316
02:28:37,020 --> 02:28:38,690
looking at the people you can go hunt 
those lines.

3317
02:28:38,691 --> 02:28:40,300
They just,
they just let one loose,

3318
02:28:40,330 --> 02:28:42,200
they take it out and it's all high 
fence.

3319
02:28:42,620 --> 02:28:43,453
But they were explaining that these 
animals were on the verge of extinction 

3320
02:28:45,920 --> 02:28:46,753
just a few decades ago.
And because of these high fence 

3321
02:28:48,951 --> 02:28:50,510
operations,
now they're thriving.

3322
02:28:50,690 --> 02:28:51,523
But they're thriving in these bizarre 
conditions where they're fenced in and 

3323
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:59,090
put them in the wallet and let them fry 
out there in that area.

3324
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:00,950
You know?
And then there's the poaching thing.

3325
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:02,083
Poaching is a weird word for it because 
a lot of those people just hunting for 

3326
02:29:04,131 --> 02:29:04,964
food for people,
the villages that I went for because 

3327
02:29:08,600 --> 02:29:12,710
we'd find snares and and I'd rip them 
down and it wasn't,

3328
02:29:13,080 --> 02:29:16,340
wasn't the commercial side of poaching.

3329
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:17,173
It wasn't locked out collecting the 
antlers or ivy or whatever and selling 

3330
02:29:19,941 --> 02:29:21,380
it and getting massive amounts of 
dollars.

3331
02:29:21,710 --> 02:29:25,610
These were people that were snaring to 
try and catch animals to eight.

3332
02:29:26,260 --> 02:29:27,093
Yeah.
If I'm gone broke and my family is 

3333
02:29:28,431 --> 02:29:29,480
hungry,
I'm going to be the first one.

3334
02:29:29,481 --> 02:29:30,314
The fucking step over a fence and killed
something I can tell you right now 

3335
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:34,040
because I know I'm doing the right 
thing.

3336
02:29:34,310 --> 02:29:35,700
Yeah,
so there's,

3337
02:29:35,810 --> 02:29:36,643
there's a funny line there where where 
there's a couple of different types of 

3338
02:29:39,231 --> 02:29:40,280
poaching,
you know,

3339
02:29:40,281 --> 02:29:42,860
and it's that one that's commercial and 
they just slowed her and everything.

3340
02:29:42,890 --> 02:29:45,230
Elephants,
Lionel Hollins,

3341
02:29:45,290 --> 02:29:48,580
which freaking horrible.
Then there's the villager,

3342
02:29:48,980 --> 02:29:51,020
let's just call them locals because I 
lived there.

3343
02:29:51,310 --> 02:29:53,900
It should be there land for people.
Exactly.

3344
02:29:53,901 --> 02:29:56,360
They just trying to feed their family,
man.

3345
02:29:56,361 --> 02:29:58,160
I come.
There's no heightened that.

3346
02:29:58,340 --> 02:29:59,173
No,
there's no hate night and those people 

3347
02:30:00,081 --> 02:30:00,914
are shot.

3348
02:30:00,980 --> 02:30:01,813
They shoot the.
I mean it's scary shit that is dead in 

3349
02:30:06,201 --> 02:30:07,034
South Africa,
but goddamn racism is still real strong 

3350
02:30:09,741 --> 02:30:10,574
and a lot of areas there and those 
people that are just poor black people 

3351
02:30:13,101 --> 02:30:13,934
that live there.
That's the other thing that I hide in 

3352
02:30:14,971 --> 02:30:15,804
the back of the hunt dude,
the man and the people that I was with 

3353
02:30:18,470 --> 02:30:21,860
frigging rice.
It's like I come back from that trip and

3354
02:30:21,861 --> 02:30:24,530
talking to Kim about it and all choked 
up.

3355
02:30:24,531 --> 02:30:25,364
I started crying.
I can't believe what those people have 

3356
02:30:26,631 --> 02:30:30,800
to go through over there and now the 
paper that will help me on the hunt.

3357
02:30:30,801 --> 02:30:34,490
That was small and now that will happy 
the whole time and he his these paypal's

3358
02:30:34,491 --> 02:30:38,440
saying he would kill his own mother for 
the scraps from the table.

3359
02:30:38,510 --> 02:30:39,343
Unlike had.
How can you frigging say that day you 

3360
02:30:41,601 --> 02:30:43,190
say that you don't know that person?

3361
02:30:43,790 --> 02:30:48,380
That's how that is deeply ingrained 
generation after generation.

3362
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:51,710
I love the local people,
but I hated the outfit that I was with.

3363
02:30:51,860 --> 02:30:53,360
Wow,
that's disturbing.

3364
02:30:53,370 --> 02:30:55,190
And it's just sad that.
I mean,

3365
02:30:55,191 --> 02:30:56,024
how do you ever fix that and you know 
what's really crazy is for a lot of 

3366
02:31:00,141 --> 02:31:03,650
people that's their dream to go to 
Africa and hunt the big seven,

3367
02:31:03,651 --> 02:31:05,430
you know,
are the big five or or there's,

3368
02:31:05,730 --> 02:31:06,420
there's a,
there's a,

3369
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:11,060
there's a movement of people acquiring 
all these trophies going into Africa and

3370
02:31:11,061 --> 02:31:13,310
shooting all these different animals and
that's the way they do it.

3371
02:31:13,311 --> 02:31:16,670
They go to these outfitters that can 
guarantee they can get in front of these

3372
02:31:16,671 --> 02:31:17,504
animals.
I think you've just got to do your 

3373
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:20,210
research on outfitters.

3374
02:31:20,340 --> 02:31:22,770
Let's run with a scumbag ones out of the
industry.

3375
02:31:23,100 --> 02:31:23,933
Do your research on the the outfit or 
talk to other hunters that have been 

3376
02:31:26,521 --> 02:31:27,354
there like and not just one.
Talked to six other hunters that have 

3377
02:31:29,341 --> 02:31:33,450
been at operation demand for the numbers
or the emails for who their past clients

3378
02:31:34,140 --> 02:31:34,973
and go there straight doesn't have that 
stray as built a hunting industry which 

3379
02:31:39,451 --> 02:31:40,590
is tiny.
It's like,

3380
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:42,420
have you ever heard about hunting in 
Australia?

3381
02:31:42,421 --> 02:31:42,760
Like,
oh,

3382
02:31:42,760 --> 02:31:43,593
come to Australia and shooter,
whatever species of deer you don't 

3383
02:31:46,651 --> 02:31:47,484
because it's not that big.
It's not like New Zealand or it's not 

3384
02:31:50,010 --> 02:31:52,320
like Africa where they build a big 
industry on it.

3385
02:31:52,470 --> 02:31:56,520
It's not a New Zealand gets over like A.
I don't know.

3386
02:31:56,521 --> 02:31:58,780
They must have the right people or 
government pushing it at.

3387
02:31:58,810 --> 02:32:02,430
Some people are always trying out.
New Zealand's known for it.

3388
02:32:02,431 --> 02:32:03,750
Yeah,
beautiful country.

3389
02:32:03,751 --> 02:32:04,584
Awesome.

3390
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:05,753
But I'm.
Australia's industry is built on having 

3391
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:12,360
excellent access to excellent numbers of
game.

3392
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:14,940
So.
So if you book a hunt in Australia,

3393
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:16,980
it's not like someone's gone,
you know,

3394
02:32:17,070 --> 02:32:20,970
there's a big industry here,
so let's just make up a business,

3395
02:32:21,240 --> 02:32:24,810
a Australian hunton safaris and let's 
just get people in.

3396
02:32:24,840 --> 02:32:26,910
We don't have game,
but they're going to come anyway because

3397
02:32:26,911 --> 02:32:30,090
we're known for hunting.
You book a hunt in Australia,

3398
02:32:30,091 --> 02:32:30,924
I guarantee you're going to be at a 
place as long as you do a little bit of 

3399
02:32:33,151 --> 02:32:33,984
research,
but practically everywhere has big game 

3400
02:32:36,421 --> 02:32:40,810
numbers and that's why they've started 
the business on a hunting outfit because

3401
02:32:40,811 --> 02:32:41,920
they've got so much game and they're 
like,

3402
02:32:41,940 --> 02:32:42,810
oh,
this is.

3403
02:32:42,920 --> 02:32:44,910
This could work out really good for 
hunters.

3404
02:32:44,911 --> 02:32:49,911
There's a ton of game here come along.
So it's not like that in Africa,

3405
02:32:50,630 --> 02:32:51,463
you know,
a lot of those places have really got 

3406
02:32:52,561 --> 02:32:54,470
nothing,
you know,

3407
02:32:54,540 --> 02:32:55,373
it's,
it's,

3408
02:32:55,390 --> 02:32:58,470
it's arid lands and federal is bullshit.

3409
02:32:58,470 --> 02:33:00,040
That hunting is going to be unreal and 
it's,

3410
02:33:00,150 --> 02:33:03,150
and it's not at all,
which is what I experienced now,

3411
02:33:03,151 --> 02:33:03,984
when,
how many people who are willing to do 

3412
02:33:05,191 --> 02:33:08,830
something like what you did in Montana 
or what you and cam did in Australia was

3413
02:33:08,831 --> 02:33:09,664
just probably even crazier because you 
didn't even bring anything with you 

3414
02:33:11,850 --> 02:33:13,260
while you have to predicate bringing 
that up.

3415
02:33:14,430 --> 02:33:16,110
You guys survived off the land.
I mean,

3416
02:33:16,111 --> 02:33:18,220
that's how many days before I can.
I,

3417
02:33:18,270 --> 02:33:19,860
I just want to feel something up about 
that.

3418
02:33:20,520 --> 02:33:21,353
The helicopter pilots said you've got to
keep your gear basically to a backpack 

3419
02:33:25,621 --> 02:33:29,640
hunt because the chopper couldn't carry 
a lot of weight.

3420
02:33:30,210 --> 02:33:30,840
So,
um,

3421
02:33:30,840 --> 02:33:32,130
so then I was like,
well,

3422
02:33:32,190 --> 02:33:33,023
I can't pack a lot of food because I'm 
already at my white limit cams already 

3423
02:33:35,911 --> 02:33:36,900
at ease,
white limit.

3424
02:33:37,290 --> 02:33:38,123
Nobody.
Body islands already yet kind of be at 

3425
02:33:39,211 --> 02:33:40,080
his white limit.

3426
02:33:40,680 --> 02:33:41,513
So I simply couldn't really pack food.
I couldn't pack fresh water or anything 

3427
02:33:44,401 --> 02:33:45,234
like that.
Because the chopper actually struggled 

3428
02:33:46,860 --> 02:33:51,860
to get off the ground once it was filled
up and so that's the story about it.

3429
02:33:53,041 --> 02:33:55,470
Yeah.
But those folks won't tell you that part

3430
02:33:55,471 --> 02:33:56,940
of the story that might be like,
oh,

3431
02:33:56,941 --> 02:33:58,860
we couldn't take food because the 
chopper couldn't carry.

3432
02:33:58,861 --> 02:34:00,510
They always look at them,
didn't bring any food,

3433
02:34:00,910 --> 02:34:03,990
any responsible.
The Way Cam described it was like,

3434
02:34:03,991 --> 02:34:06,720
you guys had just made this conscious 
decision to try to rough it.

3435
02:34:06,780 --> 02:34:07,613
Oh,
that sounds good.

3436
02:34:07,890 --> 02:34:09,580
That sounds better.
That stuff.

3437
02:34:09,710 --> 02:34:11,880
It was pretty good.
We did because I was like,

3438
02:34:12,070 --> 02:34:14,520
it will be part of the experience.
We'll have to catch buffalo,

3439
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:15,840
will have to kill.
We're going to kill,

3440
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:17,680
come on.
And uh,

3441
02:34:17,800 --> 02:34:18,633
and we did.
But that the buffalo that were killed 

3442
02:34:20,680 --> 02:34:22,990
was so tough.
I think it might've been cans.

3443
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:26,590
First bullet he killed was so tough that
you just chewed the meat.

3444
02:34:26,950 --> 02:34:29,830
You got the liquid out of it.
And then you had to take the meat out of

3445
02:34:29,831 --> 02:34:31,420
your mouth because you couldn't break it
down.

3446
02:34:32,370 --> 02:34:34,320
Yeah.
It was an old bull,

3447
02:34:34,370 --> 02:34:35,203
a [inaudible] book.
He told me that he was practicing with 

3448
02:34:37,901 --> 02:34:41,920
his bow with the same piece of meat in 
his mouth for 30 minutes.

3449
02:34:41,921 --> 02:34:45,730
That sounds about right now.
What about the liver?

3450
02:34:45,760 --> 02:34:46,840
I mean,
couldn't you eat the liver?

3451
02:34:47,230 --> 02:34:49,030
Uh,
we could off.

3452
02:34:49,031 --> 02:34:52,380
You'd want to check it over it.
Most of Australians strikes,

3453
02:34:52,390 --> 02:34:54,320
bases and game the disease.
Furry,

3454
02:34:54,330 --> 02:34:55,660
like that's one of the beauties in 
Australia.

3455
02:34:55,661 --> 02:34:58,810
You can cut the raw meat off any animal 
in Australia and just ate it.

3456
02:34:58,811 --> 02:35:01,480
You won't get sick if you do get sick,
don't blame me,

3457
02:35:01,481 --> 02:35:05,320
but you shouldn't get sick.
Just like drink a buffalo.

3458
02:35:05,321 --> 02:35:06,580
Piss.
Exactly.

3459
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:08,140
Yeah.
Um,

3460
02:35:08,650 --> 02:35:09,400
yeah.
Just,

3461
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:11,230
just,
just so tough.

3462
02:35:11,410 --> 02:35:14,200
But you didn't eat the liver room.
We didn't take it.

3463
02:35:14,201 --> 02:35:15,790
We should have.
Now that you've said that.

3464
02:35:15,920 --> 02:35:17,170
Yeah.
I love liver.

3465
02:35:17,250 --> 02:35:19,540
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3466
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:22,330
Touch.
It doesn't mean he won't eat heart.

3467
02:35:22,331 --> 02:35:23,620
You won't eat liver.
He's a pussy.

3468
02:35:23,621 --> 02:35:28,380
So he'll run like 200 miles.
But why for seven,

3469
02:35:28,390 --> 02:35:31,510
eight hours in a row you to live.
That's not impressive.

3470
02:35:32,530 --> 02:35:33,850
He just doesn't like it.
I guess.

3471
02:35:33,851 --> 02:35:34,990
Get a new shirt.
Dude.

3472
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:39,760
I just don't understand that.
I think it tastes delicious,

3473
02:35:39,761 --> 02:35:41,770
but it's also really good for you.
Yeah.

3474
02:35:41,860 --> 02:35:42,480
Yeah.
No,

3475
02:35:42,480 --> 02:35:43,313
and it's just,
I think there's some sort of an 

3476
02:35:43,901 --> 02:35:45,580
obligation they eat as much of the 
animals.

3477
02:35:45,590 --> 02:35:46,900
Yeah,
I'll definitely,

3478
02:35:46,901 --> 02:35:47,734
I'll do it.
And actually a majestic thing like the 

3479
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:51,670
elk or the,
the indigenous population a lot.

3480
02:35:51,671 --> 02:35:54,270
But when we go out there for a hunt 
because because that,

3481
02:35:54,350 --> 02:35:57,130
that,
that is free and a half days,

3482
02:35:57,131 --> 02:36:00,430
four days drive from my house to,
to go there to go hunting.

3483
02:36:00,930 --> 02:36:02,590
Um,
that's hot.

3484
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:04,580
Take meat that far home,
you know,

3485
02:36:04,581 --> 02:36:05,414
w,
w what your,

3486
02:36:05,450 --> 02:36:06,281
your,
your vehicle,

3487
02:36:06,281 --> 02:36:07,630
if you're in a vehicle is already packed
up.

3488
02:36:07,631 --> 02:36:09,610
And if you did the chopper thing,
you wouldn't be taking any out.

3489
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,920
You'd have to donate it all to the 
indigenous.

3490
02:36:12,370 --> 02:36:13,203
So when we go out for a hunt,
I love it because we're shooting balls 

3491
02:36:15,641 --> 02:36:17,560
and cutting up meat and how do they cook
it?

3492
02:36:19,210 --> 02:36:20,043
No different than any of us were.
So how the fuck do they chew through 

3493
02:36:21,731 --> 02:36:22,550
that thing?
If,

3494
02:36:22,550 --> 02:36:24,100
if they're out on,
um,

3495
02:36:24,520 --> 02:36:27,340
if they're out of community,
which is like a,

3496
02:36:27,370 --> 02:36:29,300
like an outstation there on the land.
You know,

3497
02:36:29,301 --> 02:36:29,950
they're,
they're,

3498
02:36:29,950 --> 02:36:32,000
they're out on the land.
Um,

3499
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:35,290
most indigenous cook just by putting the
meat straight in the fire,

3500
02:36:35,291 --> 02:36:36,700
you know,
still very traditional way.

3501
02:36:36,701 --> 02:36:37,534
They'd just put the meat.
So like if I killed a wallaby or 

3502
02:36:40,991 --> 02:36:42,530
kangaroo,
um,

3503
02:36:42,680 --> 02:36:43,513
they,
they,

3504
02:36:43,530 --> 02:36:44,363
they wouldn't get it,
they wouldn't scan it or anything that 

3505
02:36:46,301 --> 02:36:49,060
front straightened the fire like that 
and the skin's like a,

3506
02:36:49,510 --> 02:36:52,070
what would we wrap meat in,
like our foil or something like that and

3507
02:36:52,090 --> 02:36:52,923
cook it in the fire like that.
The skin just acts like that and it 

3508
02:36:54,341 --> 02:36:56,500
gives me a lot of flavor and everything 
like that.

3509
02:36:57,000 --> 02:36:59,530
It's just why do we have to complicate 
things so much?

3510
02:36:59,560 --> 02:37:01,120
Oh,
let's put some air foil around it.

3511
02:37:01,121 --> 02:37:03,880
Let's put some spices in there and stuff
like that because it tastes better.

3512
02:37:05,340 --> 02:37:07,560
Taste better because we're so used to 
doing that Monday.

3513
02:37:07,561 --> 02:37:08,394
If you'd never done that,
if we'd never ever done that meat with 

3514
02:37:10,920 --> 02:37:11,753
just taste good.
Just how it is implying maybe or they 

3515
02:37:15,321 --> 02:37:16,160
figured out it tastes better

3516
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,830
with salt and pepper and garlic salt.
Definitely.

3517
02:37:18,831 --> 02:37:19,664
Right.
So there's like some spice company 

3518
02:37:22,761 --> 02:37:23,594
that's going to go through a indigenous 
Australia now given them more spices so 

3519
02:37:26,570 --> 02:37:28,790
that they get used to it and they'll get
addicted sales go up.

3520
02:37:29,040 --> 02:37:29,873
Yeah.
So they throw it on the fire without 

3521
02:37:31,491 --> 02:37:33,710
gutting it at all.
And then did they eat the guts?

3522
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:35,453
The guts,
just the meat and everything around it 

3523
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:38,450
that would probably eat the organs and 
things.

3524
02:37:38,480 --> 02:37:40,100
Same with fish,
just fried fish.

3525
02:37:40,101 --> 02:37:40,934
Straight on the fire.
I've done that plenty of times so it's 

3526
02:37:41,871 --> 02:37:42,381
good.
Good.

3527
02:37:42,381 --> 02:37:44,900
Eaten like that.
And so it won't be scaled.

3528
02:37:45,440 --> 02:37:49,430
And the scales act is like the 
protective barrier between the ashes and

3529
02:37:49,431 --> 02:37:50,264
everything.
Get into the good meat and cooking the 

3530
02:37:51,771 --> 02:37:52,604
fish.
Better skills in all the flavor and 

3531
02:37:53,961 --> 02:37:54,794
taste and the juices.
Once the fish is cooked then you just 

3532
02:37:57,591 --> 02:37:59,540
sort of watching the scale is often as 
beautiful,

3533
02:37:59,541 --> 02:38:00,660
clean,
clean,

3534
02:38:00,661 --> 02:38:02,040
flush right there,
Huh?

3535
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:03,970
Hm.
Hm.

3536
02:38:04,490 --> 02:38:07,130
That's interesting.
I've never cooked anything on ashes like

3537
02:38:07,131 --> 02:38:09,170
flat on Ashley will before.
Okay.

3538
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:10,113
Yeah.
You're going to need like a month in 

3539
02:38:11,181 --> 02:38:12,170
Australia.
A month.

3540
02:38:12,171 --> 02:38:13,610
Once a month.
A month.

3541
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:14,770
Oh a month.

3542
02:38:17,200 --> 02:38:21,140
A new animal that big camp.
And I was like,

3543
02:38:21,550 --> 02:38:22,880
I don't know off.
And he's like,

3544
02:38:22,881 --> 02:38:24,860
what's a Dane?
18?

3545
02:38:24,890 --> 02:38:25,730
That's how I was like eight,
eight,

3546
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:26,250
seven,
nine,

3547
02:38:26,250 --> 02:38:27,083
six,
16.

3548
02:38:28,180 --> 02:38:29,013
You guys,
you have an interesting way of saying 

3549
02:38:31,461 --> 02:38:32,480
words.
Yeah,

3550
02:38:32,850 --> 02:38:35,570
it's proper English.
That's what I think it is.

3551
02:38:35,890 --> 02:38:38,480
It's Australian English.
Yeah.

3552
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:42,050
It's weird because you free if you 
didn't know Australians.

3553
02:38:42,080 --> 02:38:43,970
You guys sound like you're kind of 
English.

3554
02:38:43,971 --> 02:38:44,870
Really?
Yeah.

3555
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:47,840
Well there's like South African.
That's very cool.

3556
02:38:48,970 --> 02:38:49,803
Well,
we're close,

3557
02:38:50,400 --> 02:38:51,233
right?
They only have a few words they say 

3558
02:38:52,161 --> 02:38:53,420
different than us.
Like a boat.

3559
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:54,500
I,
yeah,

3560
02:38:54,530 --> 02:38:55,363
a minute.
We're going to do a to around about Las 

3561
02:39:01,190 --> 02:39:02,023
Vegas,
but they're polite.

3562
02:39:02,040 --> 02:39:05,060
So they're the most polite people ever.
Canadians,

3563
02:39:05,061 --> 02:39:06,230
Australians.
They're,

3564
02:39:06,310 --> 02:39:07,143
they're pretty polite too.
But Canadians are like for North 

3565
02:39:09,890 --> 02:39:11,570
America,
they're the fucking kings,

3566
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:13,070
the king.
Kings of politeness.

3567
02:39:13,760 --> 02:39:14,593
But um,
so back to this crazy that you did with 

3568
02:39:17,811 --> 02:39:19,910
Kim,
if you couldn't eat the buffalo,

3569
02:39:19,911 --> 02:39:20,744
how the fuck did you guys,
I mean you kind of just chew it up and 

3570
02:39:23,390 --> 02:39:25,270
you'd fall into softer,
softer spots.

3571
02:39:25,290 --> 02:39:26,780
And you guys lived off for that.
Yeah,

3572
02:39:27,230 --> 02:39:29,690
that Monday for the whole trip.
And it's a bear Monday.

3573
02:39:30,200 --> 02:39:31,220
Yeah.
Real good fish.

3574
02:39:31,221 --> 02:39:32,750
Like probably the best fish in the 
world.

3575
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:33,730
Oh really?
Yeah.

3576
02:39:33,780 --> 02:39:35,570
How do you catch that?
Louis?

3577
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:38,210
We took little fishing rods in and we 
took a couple of Lewis.

3578
02:39:38,211 --> 02:39:40,250
Is it a fresh water or salt water fish?
They both.

3579
02:39:40,920 --> 02:39:42,650
Yep.
Where'd you guys catch them?

3580
02:39:42,870 --> 02:39:43,420
Uh,
we'll,

3581
02:39:43,420 --> 02:39:45,020
we'll,
we'll can't throw it on the coast.

3582
02:39:45,170 --> 02:39:46,940
And um,
it,

3583
02:39:47,300 --> 02:39:49,160
it was horrible in a sense.
It was good,

3584
02:39:49,161 --> 02:39:49,994
but it was horrible.
It was nice because you'd get a window 

3585
02:39:51,141 --> 02:39:51,974
each night but it was horrible because 
you'll need a lot of water in a river 

3586
02:39:56,390 --> 02:39:58,970
mouth.
And the mosquitoes were like,

3587
02:39:58,971 --> 02:40:01,450
as soon as it started getting dark 
mosquitoes would be impolite.

3588
02:40:01,460 --> 02:40:02,293
But coalitions like your arms would go,
black comedy mosquitoes if you didn't 

3589
02:40:05,901 --> 02:40:07,430
put something on.
Like I said,

3590
02:40:07,431 --> 02:40:08,264
we had to get a lot so I only had one 
tiny little tube of like an insect 

3591
02:40:11,110 --> 02:40:14,250
repellent.
That's Ms Dot k dot that brutal

3592
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:15,780
that you'd put that,
you know.

3593
02:40:15,830 --> 02:40:17,580
And they'd stay off for like two 
minutes.

3594
02:40:17,610 --> 02:40:20,450
Cam didn't even have a net.
So I would sleep.

3595
02:40:20,520 --> 02:40:23,880
I had a hammock and I'd sleep in a 
hammock and I had a net of me,

3596
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:27,360
but my back would just get smashed by 
mosquitoes come back.

3597
02:40:27,361 --> 02:40:29,970
She is lying against the net.
No mattress or anything.

3598
02:40:30,510 --> 02:40:32,760
I'd wake up in the morning just 
agonizing,

3599
02:40:32,761 --> 02:40:35,280
wanting to scratch and and cam was 
assignment.

3600
02:40:35,281 --> 02:40:38,240
I know net at all.
They'll just Ashley's face all night.

3601
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:40,280
Yeah.
How do you,

3602
02:40:40,400 --> 02:40:41,233
you've highs not swell,
shut and Hud and so can you cover stuff 

3603
02:40:44,581 --> 02:40:48,210
up with or anything you could if you 
went to that effort?

3604
02:40:48,390 --> 02:40:49,580
I would have done it.
Yeah,

3605
02:40:49,581 --> 02:40:50,414
you would have done a fucking pussy.
Mosquitoes now it's just like that just 

3606
02:40:54,871 --> 02:40:56,040
dealt with it.
Yeah.

3607
02:40:56,150 --> 02:40:56,983
You know,
it's not even part of the thought 

3608
02:40:58,231 --> 02:41:00,960
process in a sense when you're on a hunt
like that because it's just,

3609
02:41:01,050 --> 02:41:03,180
you just want to be a part of the hunt,
you know,

3610
02:41:03,181 --> 02:41:04,560
and that's a part of the hunt.

3611
02:41:04,560 --> 02:41:06,660
It's a miserable part of the hunt,
but that's just the part of the.

3612
02:41:06,830 --> 02:41:10,280
I don't even like a fly buzzing around 
my head when I'm practicing my backyard.

3613
02:41:10,320 --> 02:41:11,153
Really?
Flaws twice will be trading in the 

3614
02:41:15,001 --> 02:41:18,660
corner of my eye and I'll just hold a 
conversation and people will be like,

3615
02:41:18,910 --> 02:41:21,690
oh,
I can't talk to you anymore.

3616
02:41:21,710 --> 02:41:22,440
I'm like,
what?

3617
02:41:22,440 --> 02:41:23,120
What's up?
You know?

3618
02:41:23,120 --> 02:41:23,990
And there's,
he's like,

3619
02:41:23,991 --> 02:41:26,160
there's a fucking fly fucking in the 
corner of your mouth.

3620
02:41:26,830 --> 02:41:28,140
Like,
can you show it?

3621
02:41:28,141 --> 02:41:30,970
And I'm so used to it.
Yeah.

3622
02:41:31,020 --> 02:41:32,520
How many days did you guys do that,
hon?

3623
02:41:32,980 --> 02:41:37,500
I'm must've been eight.
I think it was eight in the end.

3624
02:41:37,620 --> 02:41:42,360
Now when you decided to climb into that 
water to cool off,

3625
02:41:42,780 --> 02:41:45,720
he didn't consider the possibility that 
there was in there?

3626
02:41:45,750 --> 02:41:46,583
Yeah,
the water was muddy and it's hard to 

3627
02:41:48,151 --> 02:41:48,984
tell if it's muddy because there's a big
salt water crocodile stirring it up or 

3628
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:54,690
because a buffalo gun wallow in every 
bit of water there is.

3629
02:41:55,630 --> 02:41:56,463
So um,
we walk the edge and you look for 

3630
02:41:59,101 --> 02:41:59,934
crocodiles slides.
Crock slides doesn't mean there's no 

3631
02:42:01,591 --> 02:42:02,424
crocs there if there's no crock slides.
But we walk the edge and there was no 

3632
02:42:04,771 --> 02:42:06,810
crocs slides now.
And Alan's a local.

3633
02:42:06,811 --> 02:42:09,300
He's a teacher up in the indigenous 
community there.

3634
02:42:10,260 --> 02:42:12,480
He knows the ward is pretty well,
you can't,

3635
02:42:12,510 --> 02:42:15,350
it's hard to tell if a crux moved in 
there over the season or,

3636
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:16,283
or anything like that.
But we walk the edge and you just sat 

3637
02:42:18,690 --> 02:42:19,523
desperate to get wet.
Like Cam was even to the point where 

3638
02:42:21,961 --> 02:42:23,160
he's like,
can we just die?

3639
02:42:23,550 --> 02:42:26,280
I'd,
I'd actually prefer to cool off and then

3640
02:42:26,281 --> 02:42:27,510
die.
Let's just do it.

3641
02:42:28,110 --> 02:42:32,550
And then the other side like you're 
desperate get sat heart that you're just

3642
02:42:32,551 --> 02:42:34,710
desperate.
And in a sense,

3643
02:42:34,980 --> 02:42:35,813
since I think it was essential to get in
the water at that point to get 

3644
02:42:38,490 --> 02:42:39,600
rehydrated,
you know,

3645
02:42:39,601 --> 02:42:40,434
just for skin intake and um,
the water was the same temperature as 

3646
02:42:44,821 --> 02:42:45,270
outside.

3647
02:42:45,270 --> 02:42:46,103
Like you'd go into the water and you 
couldn't feel that you'll go and into 

3648
02:42:48,151 --> 02:42:50,040
liquid because the water's at hot as 
well.

3649
02:42:50,041 --> 02:42:50,874
It's just been boiling in the sun.
But the light in there and just chill 

3650
02:42:53,311 --> 02:42:54,700
out in the mud and every now and then 
you'd,

3651
02:42:55,010 --> 02:42:55,843
it's all muddy.
Bought them every now and then you'd 

3652
02:42:57,320 --> 02:42:58,153
sort of pushed them out and release some
cooler waters that sort of hadn't been 

3653
02:43:00,631 --> 02:43:02,580
coupla aside and be like,
oh ha ha,

3654
02:43:05,730 --> 02:43:06,563
that's what I made you.
You really have to go through that shit 

3655
02:43:08,761 --> 02:43:09,594
to appreciate things in life and one of 
those things that are just appreciate 

3656
02:43:11,771 --> 02:43:11,990
it.
And

3657
02:43:11,990 --> 02:43:14,530
life was pushing for the modern,
getting a little bit cooler water,

3658
02:43:14,531 --> 02:43:15,071
you know,
I was like,

3659
02:43:15,071 --> 02:43:16,270
Oh,
this is paradise.

3660
02:43:16,590 --> 02:43:17,890
And then two seconds later you're like,
oh,

3661
02:43:17,891 --> 02:43:19,990
this is uncomfortable as shit,
you know?

3662
02:43:20,190 --> 02:43:21,023
Well,
the fact that people live that way and 

3663
02:43:22,571 --> 02:43:23,404
struggled through those kinds of 
environments and those kinds of 

3664
02:43:24,701 --> 02:43:27,460
temperatures for untold years.
Yep.

3665
02:43:27,700 --> 02:43:32,620
Before they ever figured out ice a 
frigerator Eskimo air conditioning,

3666
02:43:32,650 --> 02:43:35,390
not eskimos.
That'd be like hate baby hate.

3667
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:37,120
Yeah.
That's another extreme.

3668
02:43:37,240 --> 02:43:41,730
Have you ever seen when people go up 
there and go hunting and like new Nevada

3669
02:43:42,480 --> 02:43:46,030
go a hunting for a fucking big hairy 
things?

3670
02:43:46,031 --> 02:43:50,290
What's the big hairy things?
Ox Muskox,

3671
02:43:50,291 --> 02:43:53,190
muskox things.
It looks like a star wars animal.

3672
02:43:53,200 --> 02:43:53,681
Yeah,
it does.

3673
02:43:53,681 --> 02:43:55,590
Yeah.
It doesn't even look real time.

3674
02:43:55,720 --> 02:43:57,250
Enroll in and get warm.
Yeah.

3675
02:43:57,270 --> 02:43:58,103
I mean,
I've seen those things and you just go 

3676
02:44:00,210 --> 02:44:00,700
with that.

3677
02:44:00,700 --> 02:44:01,533
Okay,
so people live up there and they have 

3678
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:03,873
those things and then they live down 
where you are and they hope for cool 

3679
02:44:07,901 --> 02:44:10,300
mud.
Those buffalo that we hunt,

3680
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:11,730
it'll be like,
you'll think,

3681
02:44:11,740 --> 02:44:12,573
ah,
that's not going to be anything out any 

3682
02:44:14,291 --> 02:44:15,490
way that I.
it's stinking hot.

3683
02:44:15,491 --> 02:44:16,324
Everything will be in the shade under a 
tree or tucked under a riverbank or 

3684
02:44:19,001 --> 02:44:19,834
something like that.
Those buffalo as black as I will be 

3685
02:44:21,941 --> 02:44:24,340
standing out in the open,
complete son,

3686
02:44:24,341 --> 02:44:26,300
just graze and nothing even bothering 
her,

3687
02:44:26,430 --> 02:44:27,760
bombarding them.
Now,

3688
02:44:27,850 --> 02:44:30,760
most people listening to this have no 
idea what a scrub bull is.

3689
02:44:31,400 --> 02:44:33,490
They hear the term spread bold.
They don't know what it means,

3690
02:44:33,491 --> 02:44:38,491
but it's a domestic domestic,
a domestic cow that's bald.

3691
02:44:38,650 --> 02:44:40,750
I have a many,
many centuries in Australia.

3692
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:44,070
They've all Lena bread and it's a pretty
crazy looking.

3693
02:44:44,110 --> 02:44:44,943
That's the scrub bowl.

3694
02:44:46,420 --> 02:44:47,260
Cool.
That thing,

3695
02:44:47,261 --> 02:44:49,060
that's like a Brahmin there,
so he's.

3696
02:44:49,090 --> 02:44:52,090
He's a bit of a breed bull.
Looking back on that thing,

3697
02:44:52,091 --> 02:44:52,924
what a strange hump and all it is is 
that bold would be living in country 

3698
02:44:55,991 --> 02:44:58,390
where a lot of different artists,
grable's haven't come through,

3699
02:44:58,391 --> 02:44:59,224
so it's still a fully wild bull,
but it is nice to grab a scrap that one 

3700
02:45:06,251 --> 02:45:08,560
right next to it,
jamie with the crazy horns.

3701
02:45:08,561 --> 02:45:09,311
Yeah.
Yeah.

3702
02:45:09,311 --> 02:45:11,380
He's a big boy.
Whoa.

3703
02:45:11,440 --> 02:45:13,750
That's scrub bill too.
That's man.

3704
02:45:13,751 --> 02:45:15,730
That's in America.
Look at the trees in the back.

3705
02:45:15,830 --> 02:45:19,270
Those are married.
Is that it says Canada.

3706
02:45:19,690 --> 02:45:20,523
Oh,
Canada.

3707
02:45:21,070 --> 02:45:23,560
What is that?
Same thing right now.

3708
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:24,993
They can't even come over here unless we
let them and they don't let us over 

3709
02:45:27,941 --> 02:45:28,840
here.
Over there.

3710
02:45:28,960 --> 02:45:30,400
If you've got a drunk driving 
conviction.

3711
02:45:30,580 --> 02:45:33,400
So they have troubles in Canada.
That's weird.

3712
02:45:33,401 --> 02:45:34,540
I've never seen that before.

3713
02:45:34,600 --> 02:45:38,200
I thought that was an Australian thing.
What does that one down there?

3714
02:45:38,320 --> 02:45:40,180
These people would just fucking shooting
their cows.

3715
02:45:41,400 --> 02:45:42,730
Yeah,
he'd be scrabbling.

3716
02:45:43,200 --> 02:45:44,270
Wow.
What a Brahmin.

3717
02:45:44,300 --> 02:45:46,210
Okay,
so that's a buffalo.

3718
02:45:47,130 --> 02:45:47,963
That's not scalable.
That's a big water buffalo at a crazy 

3719
02:45:50,411 --> 02:45:51,310
thing.
That is.

3720
02:45:51,430 --> 02:45:55,060
So that is something from Asia,
Europe from Asia.

3721
02:45:55,420 --> 02:45:57,670
Where is that?
That's a water buffalo.

3722
02:45:58,100 --> 02:45:59,640
Just just call the water buffalo.
Yep.

3723
02:45:59,950 --> 02:46:02,050
So there's a Cape Buffalo that are from 
Africa.

3724
02:46:02,920 --> 02:46:04,900
What does that one?
Not the lower left corner,

3725
02:46:04,901 --> 02:46:07,480
but the one right next to a jamie?
Yeah.

3726
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:08,890
What is that?
What the.

3727
02:46:09,110 --> 02:46:10,490
Is that a good scrub?
Say,

3728
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:14,150
Oh look how the color is very in that 
because they real interbred animal,

3729
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:17,030
you know.
And that's why bread with other,

3730
02:46:17,450 --> 02:46:20,720
other variety of cattle.
Hm.

3731
02:46:21,150 --> 02:46:23,900
Now the mate value is not as good as the
breeding values.

3732
02:46:23,901 --> 02:46:24,734
Not as good because the visitors there,
bit of this and they're a bit of that 

3733
02:46:27,951 --> 02:46:28,790
there a bit of everything.

3734
02:46:28,850 --> 02:46:29,720
It's like a dog,
you know,

3735
02:46:29,721 --> 02:46:32,420
you bought a purebred dog or you buy a 
mango,

3736
02:46:32,421 --> 02:46:33,290
which is,
you know,

3737
02:46:33,291 --> 02:46:34,124
a couple of different species in one.
What has the big value is the purebred 

3738
02:46:37,070 --> 02:46:40,510
right and assignment these cattle.
So that.

3739
02:46:40,620 --> 02:46:41,453
The big issue with the cattle industry,
especially in these northern parts of 

3740
02:46:45,591 --> 02:46:47,150
Australia,
is these.

3741
02:46:47,270 --> 02:46:48,103
They scrubbed bulls.
These feral cattle don't have any 

3742
02:46:50,631 --> 02:46:51,464
respect for fences.
I would just walk straight through a 

3743
02:46:52,581 --> 02:46:53,414
fence into a farmer's prize cattle and 
stopped breeding with these prized 

3744
02:46:58,321 --> 02:47:01,850
cattle.
And then all those carbs that he gets on

3745
02:47:01,880 --> 02:47:04,700
the purebred cattle anymore,
so it's really bad for the industry.

3746
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:07,820
So they knock the fence down,
some composting.

3747
02:47:07,821 --> 02:47:12,160
That's pretty much it.
And a big issue.

3748
02:47:12,260 --> 02:47:15,710
What would happen in America if those 
cows that I saw wandering around,

3749
02:47:15,770 --> 02:47:18,570
if they were allowed to have balls and 
yeah,

3750
02:47:19,210 --> 02:47:21,950
free day out there,
they'd eventually become just like that,

3751
02:47:21,951 --> 02:47:22,580
that that's right.

3752
02:47:22,580 --> 02:47:27,190
So they just didn't uncheck species of 
animal in Australia at the scrub and uh,

3753
02:47:27,310 --> 02:47:29,150
they just free to come and go wherever 
they want.

3754
02:47:29,151 --> 02:47:29,984
So.
So a lot of farmers really pushed to 

3755
02:47:32,660 --> 02:47:36,470
shoot them out or get them cold or ran 
off or off their property.

3756
02:47:36,620 --> 02:47:39,470
I'd say unbelievably aggressive.
Super aggressive.

3757
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:41,810
More aggressive than a buffalo.
Yep.

3758
02:47:42,110 --> 02:47:43,580
Wow.
Why underwater?

3759
02:47:44,200 --> 02:47:45,830
Because they're pissed off because they 
were in a bread.

3760
02:47:46,550 --> 02:47:47,101
Really?
Yeah.

3761
02:47:47,101 --> 02:47:47,934
They know they just a cranky animal.
We've also got bulls are pretty fucking 

3762
02:47:53,901 --> 02:47:54,770
aggressive.
I mean,

3763
02:47:54,771 --> 02:47:55,604
obviously the bulls,
I'm talking like bull cows that we have 

3764
02:47:58,041 --> 02:47:59,540
in America.
That's why people ride them.

3765
02:47:59,541 --> 02:48:01,190
They only get eight seconds if they're 
lucky.

3766
02:48:01,191 --> 02:48:02,690
Yeah.
They're trying to be like that.

3767
02:48:02,691 --> 02:48:04,020
They're right.
I don't know,

3768
02:48:04,580 --> 02:48:06,710
just natural,
I don't know,

3769
02:48:06,740 --> 02:48:07,573
naturally pissed off.
It's a good question because like when 

3770
02:48:09,081 --> 02:48:09,914
you see like bull fighters,
are those bowls trained to try to fuck 

3771
02:48:13,011 --> 02:48:13,844
up the matador?

3772
02:48:14,280 --> 02:48:15,620
I mean,
I don't know.

3773
02:48:15,740 --> 02:48:16,573
Ask Rob.
We'll just do that shit off their own 

3774
02:48:17,631 --> 02:48:18,464
back.
I can tell you now that's really 

3775
02:48:19,731 --> 02:48:22,100
aggressive.
We've got bank Tang Bulls as well.

3776
02:48:22,190 --> 02:48:24,860
I've heard of those cats.
Solly cattle.

3777
02:48:25,070 --> 02:48:25,851
What's a bank?
Tang?

3778
02:48:25,851 --> 02:48:28,040
What does it look like?
A Jeremy will bring on up.

3779
02:48:28,041 --> 02:48:28,940
No Daddy.
Say it.

3780
02:48:29,550 --> 02:48:31,490
Bank Tang or spell?
Excuse me?

3781
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:33,440
Um,
they,

3782
02:48:33,441 --> 02:48:38,360
I n j.
t a n g a bank.

3783
02:48:38,840 --> 02:48:41,150
I believe you've been wanting an ounce.
One word.

3784
02:48:41,270 --> 02:48:46,270
One would bang Tang.
So back home that night eve lanes,

3785
02:48:47,061 --> 02:48:48,500
they nearly extinct so that,
that'd be,

3786
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:50,690
that'd be back home.
Okay.

3787
02:48:50,691 --> 02:48:53,960
So Asia in Indonesia,
they're almost extinct,

3788
02:48:53,961 --> 02:48:54,794
but America or rather Australia there 
where they run wild and they like a 

3789
02:48:58,521 --> 02:49:01,220
velvet skin cattle yet I run wild 
elephant skin.

3790
02:49:02,330 --> 02:49:04,640
Skin man.
They are a beautiful creature.

3791
02:49:04,790 --> 02:49:08,100
What a weird looking kel.
That's a good creature

3792
02:49:08,520 --> 02:49:12,270
type in.
I'm good hand outback experience.

3793
02:49:12,330 --> 02:49:16,240
That's one of my buddies that God's 
there for anyone interested and uh,

3794
02:49:16,380 --> 02:49:17,213
he's got access to these bank Tang on 
some of the most beautiful country that 

3795
02:49:21,391 --> 02:49:23,130
you've ever seen.
Like in northern Australia.

3796
02:49:23,730 --> 02:49:25,380
Yeah.
Bring up something from Carl's.

3797
02:49:25,381 --> 02:49:27,880
They lucky they got a bank there.
He's an old one.

3798
02:49:27,881 --> 02:49:32,130
See that bolt's going across the head.
It looks like their skin is suede.

3799
02:49:32,220 --> 02:49:33,053
Yeah.
And they will charge on movement real 

3800
02:49:36,630 --> 02:49:37,463
out of those all bulls.
If they say movement vow that I would 

3801
02:49:39,811 --> 02:49:40,644
prefer to come at you then turn away 
because there's a risk in 10 in that 

3802
02:49:43,021 --> 02:49:47,660
back to you if you get within a certain 
distance and um,

3803
02:49:48,260 --> 02:49:52,050
is called lay with a Yeti hat on.
Hey,

3804
02:49:52,051 --> 02:49:52,884
I'm,
I shot one last year or the year before 

3805
02:49:55,351 --> 02:50:00,070
we've called and it comes straight at us
and call us carrying a big gun lock.

3806
02:50:00,070 --> 02:50:04,920
I showed up with a bow and calo lifted 
up the gun and he shot this bank tank as

3807
02:50:04,921 --> 02:50:08,330
it was charged and it literally dropped 
nine feet from Carl.

3808
02:50:08,380 --> 02:50:11,610
Like it just looked straight at him and 
just hammered straight out of him.

3809
02:50:11,611 --> 02:50:13,610
I'll go to a second shot off as it was 
running,

3810
02:50:14,040 --> 02:50:14,873
actually broke its leg,
which made it stumble and then it just 

3811
02:50:17,851 --> 02:50:20,000
comes straight back up and kept coming 
into colony,

3812
02:50:20,010 --> 02:50:21,830
pulled the gun up and he showed it 
straight between the eyes.

3813
02:50:21,831 --> 02:50:23,370
It was an amazing shot.
Yeah,

3814
02:50:23,371 --> 02:50:28,371
don't go by the way that man that I will
tell you up.

3815
02:50:28,530 --> 02:50:29,490
They're scary.
Credo.

3816
02:50:29,850 --> 02:50:30,683
What a weird as well.
I guess it's because you fucking shot 

3817
02:50:32,251 --> 02:50:34,680
over the bow and Arrow to be upset with 
you.

3818
02:50:35,610 --> 02:50:36,730
Probably.
I mean it's,

3819
02:50:36,950 --> 02:50:40,020
it seems like a crazy idea to shoot one 
of those things by yourself though.

3820
02:50:40,030 --> 02:50:41,670
Like you almost have to have a rifle 
backup.

3821
02:50:41,880 --> 02:50:43,680
Yeah.
But if that's the case,

3822
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:45,840
why hunt with a bow?
Exactly.

3823
02:50:45,850 --> 02:50:46,683
You have a rifle backup.
She's probably time that I did with 

3824
02:50:48,541 --> 02:50:52,560
buffalo was with a gun the very first 
time I went was a good move.

3825
02:50:52,620 --> 02:50:53,670
No,
I had the bug.

3826
02:50:53,671 --> 02:50:55,020
My buddy had the gum.
Oh yeah.

3827
02:50:55,021 --> 02:50:57,030
My buddy iron grant.
He's a really good shot too,

3828
02:50:57,060 --> 02:50:58,380
so I was like,
hey,

3829
02:50:58,530 --> 02:51:00,630
you want to come on this trip with me 
would be good.

3830
02:51:00,631 --> 02:51:02,370
You can shoot one,
but in that case,

3831
02:51:02,371 --> 02:51:06,480
like why not just hunt with a rifle 
because you're not going to kill it with

3832
02:51:06,481 --> 02:51:08,760
a bow.
That quick might.

3833
02:51:08,850 --> 02:51:09,683
You can.
You can 95 percent of the time you can 

3834
02:51:12,150 --> 02:51:15,870
have five percent of motherfucker.
So I shot three bulls on that trip.

3835
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:19,500
I got three complete postures with and 
I've got three bulls that died.

3836
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:20,333
Right?
In view.

3837
02:51:20,680 --> 02:51:22,470
I didn't have a single issue,
you know,

3838
02:51:22,920 --> 02:51:23,753
but what the rifle Donnie's is that got 
you to go to places that usually 

3839
02:51:26,160 --> 02:51:27,750
wouldn't like that bulls out in the 
open.

3840
02:51:28,410 --> 02:51:31,020
And if you didn't have a rifle backup 
behind you,

3841
02:51:31,021 --> 02:51:32,820
you probably wouldn't proceed out there 
and be like,

3842
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:36,060
there's no trees around the client.
I'm going to shoot that bowl.

3843
02:51:36,061 --> 02:51:38,310
But when you've got a rifle,
it makes you a little bit game of like,

3844
02:51:38,311 --> 02:51:39,960
you know,
obviously my buddy Aaron's on,

3845
02:51:40,180 --> 02:51:41,013
you know,
he's just waiting for shit to go south 

3846
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:45,690
and he's gonna pull a gun off and give 
it one that didn't happen.

3847
02:51:46,180 --> 02:51:47,013
Oh Man.
I have a trip since I've never hunted 

3848
02:51:48,001 --> 02:51:51,940
with a rifle backup.
But you've got to know your,

3849
02:51:52,110 --> 02:51:54,060
you've got to know your boundaries.
You know I,

3850
02:51:54,100 --> 02:51:57,000
there's a big line bull out there.
There's no trees.

3851
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,070
He's right out in the open.
You take a shot at him.

3852
02:51:59,071 --> 02:52:00,900
He was the first thing he looks.
He looks at,

3853
02:52:01,260 --> 02:52:04,070
he's going to clean you up and I do it.
You know that.

3854
02:52:04,130 --> 02:52:05,360
That's,
that thing happens.

3855
02:52:05,361 --> 02:52:06,194
So fuck that.
That seems ridiculous that you'll come 

3856
02:52:08,801 --> 02:52:10,050
in and do it.
No,

3857
02:52:10,910 --> 02:52:11,410
no,
no,

3858
02:52:11,410 --> 02:52:11,861
no,
no,

3859
02:52:11,861 --> 02:52:12,370
no,
no,

3860
02:52:12,370 --> 02:52:12,960
no.
You're not allowed to.

3861
02:52:12,960 --> 02:52:14,440
When they're laughing,
that doesn't.

3862
02:52:14,890 --> 02:52:16,400
What?
What's the,

3863
02:52:17,170 --> 02:52:20,020
the least likely to kill you if you 
shoot it in Buffalo,

3864
02:52:20,230 --> 02:52:21,520
buffalo hunting.
Really?

3865
02:52:21,580 --> 02:52:22,690
No,
no,

3866
02:52:22,960 --> 02:52:24,940
hell no.
The least likely to kill you.

3867
02:52:25,030 --> 02:52:27,310
A freaking rabbit.
Rabbit.

3868
02:52:27,311 --> 02:52:27,881
You're good.
Yeah.

3869
02:52:27,881 --> 02:52:29,590
Right.
Kinda out there.

3870
02:52:29,591 --> 02:52:31,300
Was It on a rabbit?
Oh,

3871
02:52:31,301 --> 02:52:32,530
awesome.
Well,

3872
02:52:32,531 --> 02:52:34,040
you have to kill a lot of them.
Don't show you.

3873
02:52:34,150 --> 02:52:35,550
They're overpopulated,
already popping.

3874
02:52:35,580 --> 02:52:36,550
You got a skewer.
Uhm,

3875
02:52:36,640 --> 02:52:38,170
you know,
get as many as you want.

3876
02:52:38,470 --> 02:52:40,900
It's a funny thing.
As big as that animal is,

3877
02:52:41,130 --> 02:52:41,860
you know,
and,

3878
02:52:41,860 --> 02:52:43,600
and may say,
know your boundaries.

3879
02:52:43,690 --> 02:52:46,600
If you do the right shot on that animal,
that's the first thing.

3880
02:52:47,050 --> 02:52:49,030
You know,
you've got to make sure that shots right

3881
02:52:49,090 --> 02:52:49,923
angles,
right?

3882
02:52:50,050 --> 02:52:51,740
You know,
you're confident with your bow.

3883
02:52:52,060 --> 02:52:54,310
You put that shot into the,
to the right spot.

3884
02:52:54,370 --> 02:52:56,590
Then there's no risk because that,
that,

3885
02:52:56,610 --> 02:53:00,630
that animal is dead before it gets to 
you staying still off the shop.

3886
02:53:00,660 --> 02:53:01,271
You know,
like I said,

3887
02:53:01,271 --> 02:53:02,580
I'm not the person to shoot something 
like.

3888
02:53:02,590 --> 02:53:03,371
Yes,
yes,

3889
02:53:03,371 --> 02:53:05,290
I shot it.
I'm not like that.

3890
02:53:05,291 --> 02:53:07,090
I think it's a little bit disrespectful 
even,

3891
02:53:07,091 --> 02:53:07,924
but it's also,
it's also a dangerous and it's on 

3892
02:53:10,671 --> 02:53:12,430
peaceful for the animal because you do 
that.

3893
02:53:12,490 --> 02:53:13,323
It gives the animal and an adrenaline 
boost animals within an adrenaline 

3894
02:53:15,961 --> 02:53:16,900
boost.
Man,

3895
02:53:16,901 --> 02:53:18,610
that's,
that's a hill reckoning,

3896
02:53:19,120 --> 02:53:21,820
you know,
buffalo or Buffalo,

3897
02:53:21,821 --> 02:53:22,930
you know,
that will carry them.

3898
02:53:23,370 --> 02:53:24,710
It might make,
um,

3899
02:53:25,400 --> 02:53:28,090
it might make their death longer 
because,

3900
02:53:28,160 --> 02:53:30,130
you know,
they're filled with adrenaline and stuff

3901
02:53:30,131 --> 02:53:30,880
like that.

3902
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:33,940
You shoot an animal and you be quiet.
You put the shot in the right spot.

3903
02:53:33,970 --> 02:53:34,803
It's so peaceful.
I've actually shot things and they'd 

3904
02:53:36,881 --> 02:53:37,930
been like,
what was that?

3905
02:53:38,020 --> 02:53:41,980
Put their head down and stop fading 
again and toppled over why they fade and

3906
02:53:41,990 --> 02:53:42,823
I don't even know their hit.
That's one of the beauties about Boeing 

3907
02:53:45,140 --> 02:53:48,300
at tasteful and that's why you don't 
carry on like a frigging jerk.

3908
02:53:48,550 --> 02:53:49,900
Why don't you shoot something,
you know,

3909
02:53:49,910 --> 02:53:52,270
just quiet,
nice and humble.

3910
02:53:52,830 --> 02:53:53,663
The animal dies peacefully.
That's what every Honda should drive 

3911
02:53:55,430 --> 02:53:56,470
for.
Yeah.

3912
02:53:56,471 --> 02:53:57,304
It's um,
also you'd have to have the proper 

3913
02:53:58,781 --> 02:53:59,561
equipment,
right?

3914
02:53:59,561 --> 02:54:01,360
If you're going to penetrate the side of
a buffalo,

3915
02:54:01,361 --> 02:54:04,480
you have to very strong bow and heavy 
arrows.

3916
02:54:04,510 --> 02:54:05,690
Yeah.
Um,

3917
02:54:06,310 --> 02:54:09,250
I like that because you can't tell if 
you're going to hit a rebound.

3918
02:54:09,251 --> 02:54:11,860
The yes and all the way out.
And we've,

3919
02:54:11,870 --> 02:54:16,870
my setup like I mostly shoot 70 pounds 
when I'm shooting idea at the moment and

3920
02:54:16,961 --> 02:54:19,150
that heavy Arrow and a solid one piece.

3921
02:54:19,150 --> 02:54:21,270
It's just a solid piece of steel to 
blade.

3922
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:23,830
Broaden those vpa.
Broader Shane Dorian shoot some as well.

3923
02:54:23,831 --> 02:54:24,960
Blog vantage point,
audrey.

3924
02:54:25,450 --> 02:54:28,150
It's 150 grains.
That's a heavy Bronto.

3925
02:54:28,300 --> 02:54:30,700
Yeah.
Then it's got a decent insert behind it,

3926
02:54:30,701 --> 02:54:35,470
like 92 grain insert and then I'm a nice
heavy shaft.

3927
02:54:35,740 --> 02:54:37,930
And then let's just talk about the ID,
Pam.

3928
02:54:38,070 --> 02:54:38,903
We've got 80 pounds.
I can find a rib on the way on the 

3929
02:54:41,051 --> 02:54:42,700
buffalo and I can find a Freebie on the 
way out.

3930
02:54:42,701 --> 02:54:45,970
And the arrows still just going to bus 
straight through there.

3931
02:54:46,120 --> 02:54:48,880
Now how have you used the Arrow?
It's about.

3932
02:54:49,440 --> 02:54:50,273
Well it depends what I'm shooting,
but with the IED pan I'm shooting sit 

3933
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:55,180
670 grinds.
Wow.

3934
02:54:55,240 --> 02:54:57,700
Yeah.
And with the 70 pound boat it's not much

3935
02:54:57,701 --> 02:54:59,590
different.
It's about 620 grinds,

3936
02:54:59,830 --> 02:55:04,160
670 grains is really haven't.
But that Mike's a quiet bio and it makes

3937
02:55:04,160 --> 02:55:06,840
a punch when it hits animals.
And how many feet per second?

3938
02:55:06,850 --> 02:55:07,740
Again,
none of that don't.

3939
02:55:07,850 --> 02:55:09,620
I don't even get into that technical 
shit.

3940
02:55:09,650 --> 02:55:10,520
Do you,
uh,

3941
02:55:10,550 --> 02:55:13,540
do tapes or do you do it by,
uh,

3942
02:55:13,580 --> 02:55:16,090
by eye and then write it on the tape?
Not.

3943
02:55:16,100 --> 02:55:19,280
I've got site tapes.
So how do you calculate your site tapes?

3944
02:55:19,790 --> 02:55:20,750
Um,
if you don't.

3945
02:55:21,260 --> 02:55:25,950
Well I've got the tiger or option 
archery now and it's a,

3946
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:30,470
the option five option six site.
It's got an adjustable pin.

3947
02:55:31,010 --> 02:55:31,843
Oh,
you've got all your fixed pins that you 

3948
02:55:32,931 --> 02:55:33,764
flip in place now if that one I'll just 
shoot my 20 and actually shoot all my 

3949
02:55:37,761 --> 02:55:42,440
pins in the 50 and then I match it up 
with the site type and then I stick that

3950
02:55:42,441 --> 02:55:43,274
on the go at the 20 minute mark.
So then when I pull up multiple pin out 

3951
02:55:46,581 --> 02:55:47,414
of the way,
I've just got the single pin that winds 

3952
02:55:48,550 --> 02:55:49,460
up and down that day mark.

3953
02:55:49,480 --> 02:55:52,220
Obviously I shoot it and check it,
which I have and it's spot on.

3954
02:55:52,221 --> 02:55:53,270
It's perfect.
Okay.

3955
02:55:53,271 --> 02:55:55,190
So you don't do anything like archers 
advantage,

3956
02:55:55,191 --> 02:55:58,130
do it through a computer calculation.
It's interesting.

3957
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:00,460
I just love shooting it all myself.
It's so helpful.

3958
02:56:00,510 --> 02:56:04,740
We'll move each pin for that shot.
So I'll shoot and um,

3959
02:56:04,900 --> 02:56:05,733
you know,
zero to 20 the first pin and then I'll 

3960
02:56:08,841 --> 02:56:10,880
walk back the 30 and I'll shoot and I'll
just to keep,

3961
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:12,700
keep shooting and adjusting that,
you know,

3962
02:56:12,710 --> 02:56:13,543
in tiny little increments if I have to.
Do you have like a range at your house 

3963
02:56:16,401 --> 02:56:18,380
that you do all this stuff?
I'd do it all up in the farm.

3964
02:56:18,560 --> 02:56:19,393
You know,
I sent you those photos at the time of 

3965
02:56:20,241 --> 02:56:21,980
that cabin that I built.
That's amazing.

3966
02:56:22,220 --> 02:56:23,350
Cabins.
So incredible.

3967
02:56:23,390 --> 02:56:25,990
I just got a crazy.
I can shoot as far as I like.

3968
02:56:26,050 --> 02:56:26,820
Well,
we're.

3969
02:56:26,820 --> 02:56:27,800
We're almost done here,
but let me,

3970
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:30,440
let me tell you people about your 
photography too,

3971
02:56:30,470 --> 02:56:31,303
because you take some incredible 
photography when you're out and where 

3972
02:56:34,580 --> 02:56:35,413
you have this,
like a book that you made of your 

3973
02:56:36,891 --> 02:56:38,660
photography that I got a chance to look 
at.

3974
02:56:38,930 --> 02:56:39,340
Yeah,
it did.

3975
02:56:39,340 --> 02:56:40,340
I have to bring that along.
Did I?

3976
02:56:40,430 --> 02:56:44,130
That's cool.
Somewhere and brought it back.

3977
02:56:44,280 --> 02:56:46,910
Brought it to bear camp,
but also you sent me to your website too

3978
02:56:46,911 --> 02:56:49,190
and I got a chance to look at some of 
the photos that you have up.

3979
02:56:49,270 --> 02:56:51,360
Yep.
You take some amazing pictures.

3980
02:56:51,460 --> 02:56:52,293
I love it.
That's the other thing that I'll carry 

3981
02:56:53,121 --> 02:56:54,260
with me.
Pack and paypal.

3982
02:56:54,440 --> 02:56:57,860
People Freak because it's the canon five
d mark three.

3983
02:56:57,861 --> 02:57:00,780
It's an external Flash Bay batteries at 
why's the Tundra there?

3984
02:57:00,890 --> 02:57:03,020
How much does it weigh?
Not a ton,

3985
02:57:03,080 --> 02:57:05,330
but 20 pounds.
It have to be.

3986
02:57:05,570 --> 02:57:10,570
Is that your camera?
Can I hold it then at a flash,

3987
02:57:10,881 --> 02:57:14,350
like a big full size external flash to 
that and batteries.

3988
02:57:14,680 --> 02:57:17,330
That's a lot in the pack.
It's just like it's probably 10 pounds.

3989
02:57:17,331 --> 02:57:20,300
Right.
The end result of that is that's how you

3990
02:57:20,301 --> 02:57:22,460
get those,
those crazy photos.

3991
02:57:22,550 --> 02:57:24,110
Wow.
Do you carry a tripod as well?

3992
02:57:24,170 --> 02:57:25,430
Yeah,
I carry a little tripod.

3993
02:57:25,690 --> 02:57:26,590
Yeah.
Wow.

3994
02:57:27,760 --> 02:57:29,270
Same tripod.
Wow.

3995
02:57:30,160 --> 02:57:31,360
Photography.
You know,

3996
02:57:31,670 --> 02:57:33,890
people can actually go to first man 
image,

3997
02:57:33,950 --> 02:57:36,320
which is a [inaudible] instagram account
that I've got.

3998
02:57:36,380 --> 02:57:37,213
God that pictures incredible and there's
a heap of pitches like that on this 

3999
02:57:39,890 --> 02:57:43,660
picture is from how long ago?
That's all Idaho.

4000
02:57:43,700 --> 02:57:46,760
That's just the other day yesterday,
one day ago now.

4001
02:57:46,761 --> 02:57:49,790
How do you take this photo,
like where you see all those stars?

4002
02:57:49,791 --> 02:57:50,624
Is it just setting the aperture 
correctly yet sitting aperture 

4003
02:57:53,240 --> 02:57:55,040
correctly?
The Lens that I use,

4004
02:57:55,160 --> 02:57:56,980
it's a,
it's a stigma outlands.

4005
02:57:56,990 --> 02:58:01,530
It's the 20 Mil lens and the f stop on 
that Lens is only like one point four.

4006
02:58:01,531 --> 02:58:03,750
Like that's super,
Super Low,

4007
02:58:03,751 --> 02:58:04,920
right?
What does that mean?

4008
02:58:05,100 --> 02:58:07,740
I don't know shit about photography,
like your.

4009
02:58:07,741 --> 02:58:10,180
I've been closed up and then United 
States,

4010
02:58:10,230 --> 02:58:11,760
I say an f four,
right.

4011
02:58:11,820 --> 02:58:13,940
Your eyes really closed up and,
and uh,

4012
02:58:14,280 --> 02:58:15,113
f one point four would be like that.
But imagine how much more light and 

4013
02:58:17,551 --> 02:58:21,030
everything he could get in.
That's probably bicycle I have explained

4014
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:22,560
in it.
And then,

4015
02:58:22,561 --> 02:58:24,240
um,
I will,

4016
02:58:24,490 --> 02:58:25,650
I'll,
I'll set the camera up.

4017
02:58:25,651 --> 02:58:27,790
It's got to be on a tripod because 
that's like a,

4018
02:58:28,470 --> 02:58:30,750
a.
Jamie's got to explain.

4019
02:58:30,840 --> 02:58:32,760
Hey,
I've got an f number.

4020
02:58:32,820 --> 02:58:37,080
Wikipedia.
It's like exponentially larger.

4021
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:40,140
Every time you drop in a,
an increment,

4022
02:58:40,320 --> 02:58:43,980
it gets exponentially larger.
And then as you go higher and f stops,

4023
02:58:44,020 --> 02:58:45,570
it'll get smaller.
Okay.

4024
02:58:45,690 --> 02:58:46,260
There you go.

4025
02:58:46,260 --> 02:58:47,970
So self taught,
this is all luck.

4026
02:58:48,030 --> 02:58:51,150
I just self taught so I'm not really 
into the lingo,

4027
02:58:51,151 --> 02:58:52,150
but they go,
I'll go.

4028
02:58:52,170 --> 02:58:55,440
So the same thing is with bowhunting.
You're self taught with photographers as

4029
02:58:55,441 --> 02:58:57,210
well.
That's what happens when you live out in

4030
02:58:57,211 --> 02:59:00,090
the jungle.
Fucking bank tanks.

4031
02:59:00,091 --> 02:59:00,924
Exactly.
Wild snakes and decided that that's 

4032
02:59:02,791 --> 02:59:07,230
obviously set up on a tripod and it's 
about a 15 second exposure.

4033
02:59:07,320 --> 02:59:08,153
So you know that it's open for 15 
seconds and the guy was in a lot more 

4034
02:59:11,191 --> 02:59:12,230
like,
damn,

4035
02:59:12,270 --> 02:59:17,220
that Montana law is beautiful.
How many days ago was that from Jamie?

4036
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:22,600
Six days ago.
That's not as your.

4037
02:59:22,840 --> 02:59:23,673
This is what a amazing fisher.
And it's your tent and your tent looks 

4038
02:59:26,701 --> 02:59:27,534
like.
Did you have like a headlamp inside the 

4039
02:59:28,741 --> 02:59:31,170
tent or something?
That tiny little headlamp.

4040
02:59:31,510 --> 02:59:33,450
So you left that on,
left that on,

4041
02:59:33,570 --> 02:59:37,920
and then set the camera up and the stars
man.

4042
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:38,753
So that's what you're seeing every night
while you were camping up there every 

4043
02:59:41,250 --> 02:59:42,130
night until the moon.
Come in,

4044
02:59:43,020 --> 02:59:44,720
man.
That's fucking pretty.

4045
02:59:44,740 --> 02:59:49,440
I love moonless nights.
Just just for that to the best.

4046
02:59:49,441 --> 02:59:50,940
Yeah.
It's nothing like that,

4047
02:59:51,030 --> 02:59:53,880
that view of the milky ways and saying,
hey,

4048
02:59:54,030 --> 02:59:54,863
if he can join me,
if you go back a little bit and you'll 

4049
02:59:56,401 --> 02:59:58,980
see you'll see some dead buffalo 
pitchers.

4050
02:59:59,340 --> 03:00:00,900
And uh,
I ran that time.

4051
03:00:00,901 --> 03:00:03,420
I was taking some shots when I was in 
Arnhem land.

4052
03:00:03,540 --> 03:00:05,810
And because there's no artificial,
there's no,

4053
03:00:05,890 --> 03:00:07,650
no light pollution.
Anyway,

4054
03:00:07,720 --> 03:00:11,210
up to the stars with the knife at all.
I like the,

4055
03:00:11,290 --> 03:00:12,123
the,
the aperture and everything can come 

4056
03:00:13,141 --> 03:00:16,050
back so much further on those nights 
because it's just,

4057
03:00:16,140 --> 03:00:18,390
even with the human eye,
it's just crazy.

4058
03:00:18,840 --> 03:00:19,540
Wow.
Yeah.

4059
03:00:19,540 --> 03:00:22,140
It's just lit up like you could actually
walk around in the dark,

4060
03:00:22,141 --> 03:00:24,870
just lit off the Milky Way.
No Moon.

4061
03:00:25,230 --> 03:00:26,063
You could walk around in the dark up 
there just because there's so many more 

4062
03:00:28,441 --> 03:00:31,440
stars that you can see.
It's crazy and you always come up to it.

4063
03:00:32,070 --> 03:00:34,620
There's the benefit of bonding people or
the outdoors.

4064
03:00:34,621 --> 03:00:38,130
Don't even get into Boeing.
Just go camping in that door's Nah,

4065
03:00:38,131 --> 03:00:40,130
you might have to go off a little bit.
That's pretty cool though.

4066
03:00:40,131 --> 03:00:44,010
That was the camp that I had go up or 
down.

4067
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:47,040
I'm older.
Older.

4068
03:00:49,150 --> 03:00:50,980
That's a pretty good one.
Yeah.

4069
03:00:52,160 --> 03:00:54,300
Oh,
oh my God.

4070
03:00:54,910 --> 03:00:56,730
It's like you're in a spaceship.
Yeah.

4071
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:58,870
I mean there really is like a spaceship.
Yeah.

4072
03:00:59,230 --> 03:01:00,400
So yeah,
if anyone's,

4073
03:01:00,460 --> 03:01:01,293
if any listeners are into the outdoors 
and not necessarily kill him because 

4074
03:01:05,141 --> 03:01:07,280
obviously Adam Green tree,
Boeing's got a lot of um,

4075
03:01:07,630 --> 03:01:09,430
harvest kilz on it.
Um,

4076
03:01:09,431 --> 03:01:11,920
if you just end up photography,
just go to first man image.

4077
03:01:11,980 --> 03:01:15,190
And the image shows me an image,
Adam.

4078
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:17,690
Oh,
I had him again.

4079
03:01:18,680 --> 03:01:20,700
How many people didn't get that but in 
me.

4080
03:01:20,780 --> 03:01:22,680
And I'm like,
I just told one of the latest.

4081
03:01:22,730 --> 03:01:24,190
Didn't get it.
First man.

4082
03:01:24,191 --> 03:01:26,140
Image on what?
On instagram.

4083
03:01:26,141 --> 03:01:26,974
Instagram.
Yeah.

4084
03:01:28,230 --> 03:01:30,280
Dispel it in some sort of weird 
Australian way.

4085
03:01:31,600 --> 03:01:33,930
First.man
dot image.

4086
03:01:34,030 --> 03:01:35,350
Is that what it is?
I think so.

4087
03:01:35,610 --> 03:01:38,230
So it's Adam.green,
tree dot bowhunter.

4088
03:01:38,260 --> 03:01:39,093
If you're interested in looking at dead 
animals and stars and if you just want 

4089
03:01:42,161 --> 03:01:43,600
photography first,
man,

4090
03:01:43,630 --> 03:01:45,550
first.man
dot image.

4091
03:01:45,580 --> 03:01:50,580
And you're a pussy if you dare you 
first.man.ms

4092
03:01:50,631 --> 03:01:51,730
dot.
Oh yeah man.

4093
03:01:51,780 --> 03:01:53,500
God Damn.
He takes some pretty pictures.

4094
03:01:53,501 --> 03:01:55,630
Dude.
That's amazing that you're self taught.

4095
03:01:55,900 --> 03:01:56,733
I've been thinking about it lately that 
I need to get into photography at least 

4096
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:02,750
somewhat to just take pictures with your
iphone.

4097
03:02:02,751 --> 03:02:05,530
I just.
That's the best when you do so much.

4098
03:02:05,531 --> 03:02:06,364
It's the best way to capture a memory 
because I can look back on the photos 

4099
03:02:08,590 --> 03:02:09,700
now and go,
that's right.

4100
03:02:09,701 --> 03:02:11,050
How cool is that?
Or whatever.

4101
03:02:11,980 --> 03:02:12,813
Sometimes I do so much and I get carried
away with doing so much hunting that 

4102
03:02:15,520 --> 03:02:16,353
it's lucky if I didn't take a photo,
I'd actually forget that moment because 

4103
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:19,930
there's so much happening.
So.

4104
03:02:20,380 --> 03:02:21,213
And I just love showing it to my kids 
and friends and people that are 

4105
03:02:23,201 --> 03:02:24,034
interested in it.
It's a really good promotion for the 

4106
03:02:26,291 --> 03:02:27,124
sport.
You know,

4107
03:02:27,550 --> 03:02:28,600
I used to think,
um,

4108
03:02:28,780 --> 03:02:30,570
do you call hunting and sport a dying?

4109
03:02:30,730 --> 03:02:32,350
I hate that word,
but you just used it.

4110
03:02:32,550 --> 03:02:33,570
I know,
yeah.

4111
03:02:33,580 --> 03:02:35,980
It's a common word that correct me.
Yeah.

4112
03:02:35,981 --> 03:02:36,880
I just,
uh,

4113
03:02:37,210 --> 03:02:40,240
I feel like there's a word for it,
like natural life,

4114
03:02:40,320 --> 03:02:44,340
like dismantle part of me or discipline.
I think discipline is a better word for.

4115
03:02:44,360 --> 03:02:45,880
I hear the sport,
like,

4116
03:02:45,960 --> 03:02:48,200
you know,
welcome to the sport.

4117
03:02:48,240 --> 03:02:49,760
Glad you're getting involved in the 
sport.

4118
03:02:49,761 --> 03:02:50,594
And I'm like,
oh.

4119
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:53,520
So like,
or we could call it a pause.

4120
03:02:53,530 --> 03:02:57,730
Time of cold pastime doesn't seem 
significant enough.

4121
03:02:57,760 --> 03:02:58,910
It doesn't.
Yeah.

4122
03:02:59,140 --> 03:03:02,150
It seems like it's not.
I mean,

4123
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:03,910
you shoot an elk,
is that a pastime?

4124
03:03:03,911 --> 03:03:05,770
No,
it's way more than that.

4125
03:03:06,030 --> 03:03:07,660
It's like,
yeah,

4126
03:03:07,750 --> 03:03:10,150
a life experience.
Who I am,

4127
03:03:10,460 --> 03:03:12,490
what we are,
and then some.

4128
03:03:12,491 --> 03:03:13,120
Right?
Yeah.

4129
03:03:13,120 --> 03:03:15,070
So you know,
if you're getting into the sport,

4130
03:03:15,590 --> 03:03:18,940
I'm not going to say it.
If you're getting into bow hunting,

4131
03:03:19,720 --> 03:03:22,330
I guarantee you wish you found that 20 
years ago.

4132
03:03:22,740 --> 03:03:23,540
Bowhunting.
Yeah,

4133
03:03:23,540 --> 03:03:24,900
I wouldn't.
You know what,

4134
03:03:24,910 --> 03:03:27,910
I'm happy I found it when I found of 
course so busy.

4135
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:28,833
Always the height,
the ID or if someone's going to go 

4136
03:03:30,401 --> 03:03:31,234
through life and never find this 
connection and that's the big push for 

4137
03:03:34,541 --> 03:03:35,374
me to promote bowhunting.
I've written for the Australian outdoor 

4138
03:03:39,460 --> 03:03:40,293
magazines for like 12 years now and,
and a lot of people think it's like a 

4139
03:03:44,081 --> 03:03:45,610
self promotion.
Like I don't care.

4140
03:03:45,900 --> 03:03:48,010
I don't care if I didn't have any views 
at all.

4141
03:03:48,370 --> 03:03:52,480
As long as people were getting a that 
exposure,

4142
03:03:52,481 --> 03:03:54,910
I was putting that out there for people 
to go,

4143
03:03:54,911 --> 03:03:56,120
oh,
I should try this.

4144
03:03:56,121 --> 03:03:57,890
It looks cool.
This dude's really enjoying it.

4145
03:03:58,220 --> 03:04:01,670
Here's the benefits in it and going and 
doing it because it drives me nuts.

4146
03:04:01,671 --> 03:04:04,820
Just thinking that someone should have 
that connection.

4147
03:04:04,821 --> 03:04:07,460
They just don't know it yet because a 
lot of the guys,

4148
03:04:07,461 --> 03:04:08,294
especially the older guys that I've 
introduced to bowhunting have always 

4149
03:04:11,811 --> 03:04:12,650
been like,
man,

4150
03:04:12,651 --> 03:04:14,480
I would've never known about this 
before,

4151
03:04:14,481 --> 03:04:17,420
and they've just got now I can't imagine
them as anything else,

4152
03:04:17,421 --> 03:04:18,254
but hunters because they just thrive on 
it that much and has done so much for 

4153
03:04:21,351 --> 03:04:24,910
their lives or just the outdoors.
Some guys that are gonna get into it,

4154
03:04:24,911 --> 03:04:26,180
try and been like,
it's not for me,

4155
03:04:26,181 --> 03:04:27,014
but I really love camp and being out 
there in the wilderness and even 

4156
03:04:29,331 --> 03:04:30,390
archery.
Yeah,

4157
03:04:30,430 --> 03:04:33,850
definitely shooting a target for me is 
like a form of therapy.

4158
03:04:33,930 --> 03:04:35,110
So Zen moment.

4159
03:04:35,150 --> 03:04:35,983
Yeah.
There's so much concentration going on 

4160
03:04:37,611 --> 03:04:41,660
that it cleanses your mind and if I can 
shoot bows for an hour every day,

4161
03:04:42,290 --> 03:04:42,921
man,
it just,

4162
03:04:42,921 --> 03:04:43,754
uh,
it,

4163
03:04:44,020 --> 03:04:47,540
it alleviates stress and some sort of a 
strange like,

4164
03:04:47,600 --> 03:04:49,250
you know,
for lack of a better word.

4165
03:04:49,251 --> 03:04:49,850
Zen.

4166
03:04:49,850 --> 03:04:50,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

4167
03:04:50,900 --> 03:04:52,570
Well it might be the best word for it 
actually.

4168
03:04:52,660 --> 03:04:55,430
You were talking about earlier,
like going out to the wilderness,

4169
03:04:55,460 --> 03:04:57,690
no technology or anything like that.
What it does,

4170
03:04:57,691 --> 03:04:59,240
the demand is,
it frees the mind,

4171
03:04:59,241 --> 03:05:02,630
but like it's like it resets me.
It's like hitting the reset button.

4172
03:05:02,720 --> 03:05:04,640
That's all good.
It's all fresh now.

4173
03:05:04,790 --> 03:05:07,280
You know,
it's just gives you time to think,

4174
03:05:07,360 --> 03:05:08,450
you know.
Yeah.

4175
03:05:08,451 --> 03:05:08,780
And even

4176
03:05:08,780 --> 03:05:11,600
people that aren't into hunting,
I totally understand that.

4177
03:05:11,601 --> 03:05:12,351
And like I said,
um,

4178
03:05:12,351 --> 03:05:13,184
I've been really paying attention a lot 
to people that do these longterm hikes 

4179
03:05:18,021 --> 03:05:21,920
and also overlanding people that just go
on these crazy adventures,

4180
03:05:22,360 --> 03:05:23,193
like they get off the beaten path and 
they develop these vehicles that are 

4181
03:05:26,001 --> 03:05:26,834
capable of driving over adverse 
conditions and they just figured out a 

4182
03:05:30,711 --> 03:05:33,080
way to live out there in the desert or 
out in there.

4183
03:05:33,090 --> 03:05:36,200
The mountains.
It's fascinating to me because there's a

4184
03:05:36,201 --> 03:05:37,034
longing I think that people have to get 
away from the concrete to get away from 

4185
03:05:39,801 --> 03:05:40,634
the electricity and to just feel the 
stillness of the actual world 

4186
03:05:45,770 --> 03:05:47,510
uninhibited,
unencumbered,

4187
03:05:47,550 --> 03:05:48,383
and an an uncompressed by,
by civilization and buildings and 

4188
03:05:56,720 --> 03:05:59,060
language.
And when you're out there,

4189
03:05:59,120 --> 03:05:59,690
man,
I don't,

4190
03:05:59,690 --> 03:06:02,330
I've never done what you've done,
but when you're out there for 11 days,

4191
03:06:02,331 --> 03:06:04,760
you don't even talk to anybody for 11 
days

4192
03:06:04,780 --> 03:06:05,613
this side,
this trip I did because I had internet 

4193
03:06:07,841 --> 03:06:10,620
service at the top or a reception and I 
kept doing this,

4194
03:06:10,630 --> 03:06:11,800
uh,
insta stories,

4195
03:06:11,801 --> 03:06:12,401
you know.
Yeah.

4196
03:06:12,401 --> 03:06:13,600
Those were great.
By the way.

4197
03:06:13,601 --> 03:06:14,434
I,
you'll watch,

4198
03:06:14,480 --> 03:06:17,050
watch all that.
I wish you saved them though.

4199
03:06:17,540 --> 03:06:20,320
Story disappear.
Absolutely sucks.

4200
03:06:20,321 --> 03:06:21,310
You're not hoyt.
Need to do.

4201
03:06:21,320 --> 03:06:24,490
If you listen to next year,
send a photographer out or,

4202
03:06:24,630 --> 03:06:26,680
or a film did and we'll film the whole 
thing.

4203
03:06:26,710 --> 03:06:28,090
But then some dude's going to be talking
to you.

4204
03:06:28,091 --> 03:06:30,010
I'm not playing.
That's the rules.

4205
03:06:30,011 --> 03:06:32,240
He can't talk.
He's got to have your campsite.

4206
03:06:32,260 --> 03:06:37,260
And she jump in if a bears is trying to 
eat healthy.

4207
03:06:39,280 --> 03:06:40,660
But um,
so that sucked.

4208
03:06:40,661 --> 03:06:41,830
But,
um,

4209
03:06:42,040 --> 03:06:45,790
I've had trips where you don't talk to 
people for days and days on end and just

4210
03:06:45,791 --> 03:06:46,624
the fact of a common back into 
civilization and opening your mouth 

4211
03:06:49,450 --> 03:06:50,470
feels weird.

4212
03:06:51,750 --> 03:06:54,850
It feels absolutely we'd even,
when you're talking up there,

4213
03:06:54,851 --> 03:06:56,680
you're talking about.
No,

4214
03:06:56,730 --> 03:06:57,550
that's right.
Yeah,

4215
03:06:57,550 --> 03:06:59,610
yeah,
I mean you're talking to the phone,

4216
03:06:59,660 --> 03:07:00,331
you're like,
Hey,

4217
03:07:00,331 --> 03:07:01,164
I'm up here.
I just told myself every now and then 

4218
03:07:03,211 --> 03:07:05,760
you do you seriously every now and then 
you'd be like,

4219
03:07:05,930 --> 03:07:06,763
Nah,
you just.

4220
03:07:06,770 --> 03:07:08,760
Then you think like,
what did I say that out loud?

4221
03:07:09,090 --> 03:07:11,340
Because you haven't interacted with 
anyone for so long.

4222
03:07:11,680 --> 03:07:12,780
It would be something like,
oh,

4223
03:07:12,781 --> 03:07:16,760
you fell over you frigging dummy,
which happened a few times.

4224
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:18,470
You definitely don't want to break a leg
up there.

4225
03:07:18,750 --> 03:07:21,060
You'd be screwed.
You bring a satellite phone.

4226
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:22,470
Yeah,
I had a satellite phone.

4227
03:07:22,790 --> 03:07:24,420
Yup.
So in case shit goes bad.

4228
03:07:24,450 --> 03:07:26,580
Yeah,
and it's got an SOS button built into it

4229
03:07:27,500 --> 03:07:29,790
that I even say it to Kim,
my wife,

4230
03:07:29,791 --> 03:07:32,340
you know,
like you don't see that side of things,

4231
03:07:32,341 --> 03:07:36,050
but I do actually take precautions to 
take us sat phone.

4232
03:07:36,060 --> 03:07:38,550
That's it.
And a time as this.

4233
03:07:38,670 --> 03:07:41,670
There's,
there's management within within it,

4234
03:07:41,760 --> 03:07:43,410
but you.
But you just don't see it.

4235
03:07:43,990 --> 03:07:47,380
Listened to.
There's a very small handful of people,

4236
03:07:47,381 --> 03:07:49,960
even in the hunting world that are doing
what you're doing,

4237
03:07:50,010 --> 03:07:54,280
that are taking those kinds of crazy 
adventures and just diving into it.

4238
03:07:54,580 --> 03:07:55,331
It's awesome,
man.

4239
03:07:55,331 --> 03:07:56,164
I was.
I was really blown away by those 

4240
03:07:57,251 --> 03:07:59,320
instagram stories and following you 
every day.

4241
03:07:59,710 --> 03:08:02,050
I follow you several times a day I would
go in and check in on it,

4242
03:08:02,290 --> 03:08:03,570
make sure everything's going on,
blah,

4243
03:08:03,620 --> 03:08:04,460
blah.
So awesome.

4244
03:08:04,540 --> 03:08:05,450
Yeah.
Good.

4245
03:08:06,250 --> 03:08:08,040
That's good to say.
You log in you.

4246
03:08:08,041 --> 03:08:11,920
Unless shit probably like things more.
I just look at him.

4247
03:08:12,010 --> 03:08:13,770
I enjoy them.
I need to hit that little heart button.

4248
03:08:13,780 --> 03:08:15,220
People love you when you hit that 
heartbeat.

4249
03:08:15,250 --> 03:08:15,970
Yeah,
for sure.

4250
03:08:15,970 --> 03:08:18,320
Alright,
I'll give you a little louder.

4251
03:08:18,330 --> 03:08:20,310
Louder.
You need to do one of them tripped.

4252
03:08:20,910 --> 03:08:23,520
Yes you do.
I'm telling you you'll friggen five on a

4253
03:08:23,521 --> 03:08:24,370
dude.
It's interesting.

4254
03:08:24,430 --> 03:08:26,580
I don't think I didn't do that.
You would get love it.

4255
03:08:26,630 --> 03:08:28,000
Ah,
I don't mind.

4256
03:08:28,030 --> 03:08:32,450
I would like to go and do like a deep 
backpack trip solo.

4257
03:08:32,730 --> 03:08:35,710
I don't know about all that.
I don't want anybody finding my sneakers

4258
03:08:36,040 --> 03:08:36,873
and you know what I'm saying?
Fuck still inside from marks all over 

4259
03:08:41,381 --> 03:08:42,214
it.
Don't be so ironic or eaten by the 

4260
03:08:43,481 --> 03:08:44,770
wolves that I love so much.
Yeah,

4261
03:08:44,920 --> 03:08:46,060
that's,
that's funny.

4262
03:08:46,061 --> 03:08:46,781
Like that.
