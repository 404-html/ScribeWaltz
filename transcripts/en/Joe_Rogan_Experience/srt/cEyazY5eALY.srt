1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,171
Try my day.

2
00:00:01,171 --> 00:00:03,840
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,710
Now when you guys watch MMA and you see
someone like Stephen Thompson that has

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,060
very,

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:13,620
a few elements of Moitai he uses,

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,260
but he uses a lot of sport karate,

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,500
which is a,

8
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:17,851
you know,

9
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,620
a completely different stance,

10
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:20,970
a completely different style.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,650
What's your take on that when you watch
that or what his style or when they,

12
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,780
this style is Moitai well,

13
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:28,620
they definitely don't really,

14
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,130
I mean,

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,790
well leg kicks and some techniques,

16
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,100
but essentially he's doing
a sport karate style.

17
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:35,371
Well,

18
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:35,491
it was,

19
00:00:35,491 --> 00:00:37,320
it was kind of the same
thing with Anderson Silva.

20
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,030
It's like just cause
someone's throwing an elbow,

21
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,830
just because somebody has a clinch
doesn't necessarily make it [inaudible].

22
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:44,910
There's a lot of arts
that have those things.

23
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:45,571
You know what I mean?

24
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,200
And I'm not going to view
him as a Muay Thai fight.

25
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,420
I think of Anderson is a motif.

26
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:50,280
I am not at all.

27
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,270
He thought of himself as a [inaudible].

28
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,273
Well that's okay,

29
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,001
but,

30
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,910
but I wouldn't view him as of
when we tie fighter at all.

31
00:00:56,911 --> 00:00:57,780
I knew him as an MMA.

32
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,000
Anything he did was very moist.

33
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,110
Even his clinch was,

34
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:01,651
I mean,

35
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,910
that's such a fundamental,

36
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,290
basic clinch,

37
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:04,900
you know what I mean?

38
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,780
That's just because everyone
else was so terrible at it.

39
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,920
It's like grab the neck,

40
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:11,340
like you don't see that in high level
Muay Thai guys going up and grabbing each

41
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,150
other by the neck.

42
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,270
It's in transition and one of the
hurt people when they get tired very,

43
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:16,420
it's very much a,

44
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,220
um,

45
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,750
us of struggling for dominance over
under those kinds of things like big,

46
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:22,201
sloppy,

47
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:22,720
ridiculous.

48
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,680
Armbar yeah,

49
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,031
dude.

50
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:24,500
I mean like,

51
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,320
like it's like,

52
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,510
that's like day one more time.

53
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,340
So when you saw that like
the rich Franklin fight

54
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,010
in the fuck,

55
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,150
like how did he not learn this as first
day in training and what was even worse

56
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:36,720
was,

57
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,290
um,

58
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:40,800
I had a friend that I trained with that
went out to help him for the second one

59
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,780
and he just didn't want to hear it.

60
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,400
Like they did not want to hear that.

61
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:44,850
Like,

62
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,121
dude,

63
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,830
you don't know what you're doing at all.

64
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,420
Because as well we talked about earlier,

65
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:51,810
these guys get to a high
level and think that they're,

66
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,650
um,

67
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,150
maybe we'll tie you technique is good.

68
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:54,421
And I'm like,

69
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:54,631
dude,

70
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:55,860
you are like a kindergartener.

71
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,470
Like you don't know what
you're doing at all whatsoever.

72
00:01:58,471 --> 00:01:59,490
He didn't want to listen,

73
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,450
so.

74
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:01,110
Wow,

75
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,160
that's crazy.

76
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,873
That look,

77
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,120
so w who was it that went out with him?

78
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:06,570
Uh,

79
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,403
Anthony Brown,

80
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,390
all the trading partner of mine.

81
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,960
And he was specifically brought
there because of his Moitai.

82
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,231
Yeah,

83
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:14,030
without a doubt.

84
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,221
I'm like,

85
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:14,641
why would you,

86
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:17,550
why would you bring me in if
you're not going to use me?

87
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:17,821
I mean,

88
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:19,500
I've been brought in for people to,

89
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,370
and why wouldn't you use what
you've brought me in here to do?

90
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,210
You know what I mean?

91
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,080
Like you brought me in for my Muay
Thai for my knowledge in this thing.

92
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:28,800
And you just want to keep
doing what you're good at.

93
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,281
Like,

94
00:02:29,281 --> 00:02:29,881
why am I here?

95
00:02:29,881 --> 00:02:30,714
This is stupid.

96
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,250
That's unfortunate.

97
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,930
He's such a nice guy and such a smart guy.

98
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,120
He was a math teacher without a doubt.

99
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:38,730
How do you not see the math of that?

100
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,990
It's when people aren't,

101
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,730
people have a false sense of where they're
at in the sport and what they can do.

102
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:45,450
And I'm like,

103
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,100
you literally know nothing,

104
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,840
but you have this mentality that you're,

105
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,600
you're decent at standup,

106
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:52,060
you're decent,

107
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,250
Emma.

108
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,160
We tie and you're terrible compared
to someone that really does know what

109
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:56,994
they're doing.

110
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,690
You know what I mean?

111
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,930
Most people's understanding
is very elementary.

112
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:02,764
If that,

113
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:03,521
you know,

114
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,550
you take another person and I'm going to,

115
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,810
I could beat you without
even like touching you.

116
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:08,981
You know what I mean?

117
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:09,161
Just,

118
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:11,650
and just to let you mess yourself up
because you don't really know what you're

119
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:12,484
doing.

120
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,780
It's a,

121
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,560
it's crazy to think that someone could
reach the world championship level and

122
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,210
something that involves more Moitai,

123
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,630
but there's so many
variables that come be,

124
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,700
there's wrestling,

125
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,361
there's two shits is,

126
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,021
there's always things.

127
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:23,560
There's,

128
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,240
you can get away with a lot more like the
striking and MMA you can get away with

129
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,350
because of those variables,

130
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,640
because of the smaller gloves,

131
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,900
because of the take downs,

132
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,410
you know,

133
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,410
you put that person in the ring with
even a moderately good muay Thai person,

134
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,660
moderately good boxer,

135
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,960
they're going to get murdered.

136
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:41,651
Right.

137
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:42,160
You know what I mean?

138
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,450
Right,

139
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:42,940
right.

140
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,640
Just like it can bring in like a really
good point that I fire him but then

141
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,480
don't have any wrestling,

142
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:48,080
different defense or no digits.

143
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,821
They're not going to do it.

144
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,250
Be able to do.

145
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,750
Exactly.

146
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,141
Exactly.

147
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:50,974
Look like an idiot.

148
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,030
Well that's one of the appeals of MMA.

149
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,450
Yeah.

150
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:00,450
Is that the guy who wins is most likely
the best fighter because if it was just

151
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:04,030
more tie or if it was just
wrestling or if it was just Jujitsu,

152
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,070
you would see someone
who's the best at that.

153
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,450
But when you throw everything in,

154
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,220
like it's the kitchen sink,

155
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,730
get in there and that's when you know,

156
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:14,470
you get to see like who's been,

157
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,180
I mean it was even more complex puzzle.

158
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,990
Yeah.

159
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:17,650
That's why like I,

160
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,430
I've never really understood the argument
of like pitting this person against

161
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,710
that person or like who's got
the best when we tighten them,

162
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:24,010
mate,

163
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:24,671
we'll nobody,

164
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,350
cause they're not doing Muay Thai,

165
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,893
right.

166
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,540
That,

167
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,291
that argument,

168
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,270
that conversation is completely invalid.

169
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,960
Like,

170
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,081
Oh,

171
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,600
if you put this boxer and
against this Muay Thai fighter,

172
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:35,200
who's going to win?

173
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,630
I don't know what rules are they
fighting under their fighting under mood.

174
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,190
Tyrell's east probably
going to get crushed.

175
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:40,443
You know what I mean?

176
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:40,751
Well,

177
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:44,140
it's interesting that a Wonderboy
Thompson is going to fight Tyron Woodley,

178
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:47,980
who's the UFC welterweight champion
and who's just super powerful wrestler,

179
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:51,730
but who's also training with Duke
Roufus who's obviously very talented,

180
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,220
knows a lot about Moitai great coach.

181
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:54,820
Um,

182
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,390
what,

183
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,370
when you see a guy like that?

184
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:57,610
Well,

185
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,720
the reason why I keep bringing up,

186
00:04:58,721 --> 00:04:59,290
um,

187
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,120
Wonderboy styles because it's so unique.

188
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,321
You know,

189
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:04,840
we brought up Raymond Daniels in glory
who is one of the only guys that has like

190
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,190
that similar background.

191
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,570
And then Michael Page of course,

192
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:11,650
in MMA who fights for belt or has a
very similar style to that sport karate

193
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,460
style.

194
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,960
What are the holes in that style?

195
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,501
Like what's,

196
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:17,600
what's the pros and cons
that you see as a fighter?

197
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,420
What we were speaking of earlier,

198
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:19,690
it's,

199
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,500
it's,

200
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,650
if you've never applied that in a fight,

201
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,700
a real fight,

202
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,031
not,

203
00:05:25,031 --> 00:05:25,420
not,

204
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,590
not point sparring,

205
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:26,891
not,

206
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:27,131
not,

207
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:27,341
not,

208
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:27,821
not that,

209
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:28,654
that kind of thing.

210
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,710
There's certain techniques and
things that are completely worthless.

211
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,850
And unfortunately in a lot
of those sports you are not,

212
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,120
you don't get exposed by
that until it's way too late.

213
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:41,650
So you're trying these techniques that,

214
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:42,551
you know,

215
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:42,670
a,

216
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,570
a decent person just kind of walk right
through because they look good and

217
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:48,280
they're flashing and they're
great on the pads and,

218
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:48,850
and,

219
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,451
and all that.

220
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:49,691
But,

221
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:51,850
but when you have to damage someone,

222
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600
obviously Thomson knows
how to do that though.

223
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,820
And it's using techniques and,

224
00:05:57,821 --> 00:05:58,090
but,

225
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,720
but applying them in a,

226
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:00,710
in a more fight,

227
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,220
uh,

228
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,890
centric way and it's
completely different thing.

229
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,960
But when you see what
I was trying to get at,

230
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:10,010
is that such a weird style where you
stand sideways and he leaps in and out and

231
00:06:10,011 --> 00:06:11,930
he moves back and forth from the waist,

232
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:12,764
like a snake.

233
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,341
I mean,

234
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,140
he's got a lot of it.

235
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,620
There's a lot of weirdness to the way
he moves and it's very difficult to find

236
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,730
anybody that has that
level skill with a sport,

237
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:23,330
karate,

238
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,163
kickboxing,

239
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,870
but also has a really
good wrestling base to,

240
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,340
yeah.

241
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,680
Yeah.

242
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,040
And I think that's one of the biggest
things and why he's able to apply those

243
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,000
things because,

244
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,140
because he can deal with the wrestling
and everything else that goes in,

245
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:35,630
so,

246
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,110
so that's why you'll see him throw those
techniques because he's not as worried

247
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,950
about it as someone who might be just
as good as him with those things in,

248
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:45,420
and it has zero ground or wrestling where
they're not going to throw it because

249
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,430
they're going to get taken down.

250
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:46,960
Crushed.

251
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,180
Yeah.

252
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,110
It's like we were talking about your
experience in a taekwondo school that you

253
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,970
went there the first day,

254
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,650
start doing sparring
you through a low kick,

255
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:55,740
and then like get outta here.

256
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,133
Tons of go.

257
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
So you'd do it.

258
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,310
Something to do effective.

259
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,080
Yeah.

260
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,400
So being able to apply things in a real
fight and being able to apply them in

261
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,150
the air is,

262
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,020
is very different.

263
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:06,470
Right.

264
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,350
Obviously we see Thompson can
apply them in a real fight.

265
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,380
What is he doing that
you see that's different?

266
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,300
Like,

267
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,050
I mean obviously it's
not a Moy Thai fighter,

268
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,070
he's a kickboxer,

269
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:18,500
but like when you see that stance,

270
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:19,460
that weird stance,

271
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:20,480
that sideways stance,

272
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,400
what do you think about that?

273
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,230
Oh,

274
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,340
I don't think much about it
cause I don't watch a lot of MMA,

275
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,240
you know?

276
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,540
I mean I do a little bit better.

277
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,160
I don't,

278
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,270
I wouldn't say I follow it,

279
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,051
you know what I mean?

280
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,040
I watch it when it's on,

281
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,390
but I'm not the,

282
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:32,751
you know,

283
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,900
like paying attention to the fighters
are tracking them throughout the years.

284
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,490
You know that much.

285
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:41,030
I'm just so curious because you
are so Moitai you know your style,

286
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:41,870
so more tie in.

287
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,980
You're obviously an expert at it.

288
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm always curious as
to like how a person,

289
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:47,320
like you observes a,

290
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,850
an expert striker in
sort of another realm.

291
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:50,541
Well,

292
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:54,590
I think he's an expert and he's
become an expert striker and MMA.

293
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,220
So he's applying all the
techniques that he know him.

294
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,161
He knows him.

295
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:00,260
Ha Ha have worked for him and MMA.

296
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:03,620
So it's different than if he would
get in the ring and do Moitai.

297
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,340
Yeah.

298
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,830
How many fighters like
him have done Moitai.

299
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,600
Obviously Raymond Daniels has done
kickboxing and some you know and it,

300
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,620
but it's another one of those things
where being able to apply the things from

301
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,270
your other sport into that.

302
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,380
So like we were talking about with the
Raymond Daniels and Nikki Holt skin,

303
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,160
like he just walked him down.

304
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,140
He was like Bop,

305
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:25,330
bop crushing the legs.

306
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,333
Tylene too.

307
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,010
So at a certain level it Kinda,

308
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,110
you'll lose that like where you're,

309
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,940
you're spinning flashy techniques
are going to work against,

310
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:35,211
you know,

311
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:35,481
those,

312
00:08:35,481 --> 00:08:36,980
those mid level guys.

313
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,940
But you put them in there with the best
in the world and a lot of that stuff

314
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,550
gets exposed in is not
working out so well.

315
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,050
And you think that
essentially demonstrates the
effectiveness of Moitai at the

316
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:48,831
highest levels.

317
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:50,880
You think it's the best demonstrates the,

318
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:51,531
the holes.

319
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,600
And some of the stances in techniques.

320
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,050
Um,

321
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,780
if I'm not flinching on the things you
do and don't really care so much about

322
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,640
you hopping around and spin around,

323
00:08:59,641 --> 00:09:00,530
I'm just walking you down,

324
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,373
crushing you.

325
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,280
Um,

326
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,940
you know that that's where
that kind of gets exposed.

327
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,290
So it's like,

328
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,620
it's like putting a boxer into a Muay
Thai fight I'm going to do is kick your

329
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,610
legs and you can't punch me.

330
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,081
Right.

331
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:12,541
You know what I mean?

332
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:16,500
But you take a boxer and teach them how
to defend though those kicks and Stan

333
00:09:16,501 --> 00:09:21,270
and a little bit more of a squared up
way and where I can't use you use your

334
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,590
weakness against you as much.

335
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,200
You're going to have much better success
even if you've never throw quick.

336
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,770
Now you just can take those kicks
better and just kill me with your,

337
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:30,030
your high level hands.

338
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:39,970
Okay.
