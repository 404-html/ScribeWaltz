00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:07,190
Hello Ladies and gentlemen,
this episode of the podcast is brought 

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,681
to you by draft kings draftkings.com,
America's favorite one week fantasy 

3
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,670
football site where you can win enormous
cash prizes every week.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,000
You've already researched the plays for 
your season long fantasy team,

5
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:21,150
especially if you're like Jamie and you 
are a serious dork about it.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,900
Turn that knowledge into 
instantCash@draftkings.com

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,670
last year.
These are real numbers.

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,080
One player turned $11 into 4,000
in one weekend.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,530
Another player won 100 grand his first 
time ever playing and another player won

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:41,850
a million dollars in one day.
Just playing fantasy football.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:45,090
I used to think fantasy football was 
ridiculous,

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,270
but now I'm starting to understand it.
It's like when I found out how much 

13
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,270
poker players made,
I went,

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:50,460
Whoa,
wait a minute.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,490
I say poker when they're playing cards,
like a bunch of little kids.

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,900
No,
no.

17
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,720
They're making stupid amounts of money 
playing fantasy football.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,060
That's real.
I can't believe it.

19
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,590
Like men,
like men.

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,290
Yeah,
keep you season long league where it is,

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,800

That's a million American real dollars.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,600
Not like Mcdonald's books or fucking 
chucky cheese dollars or some shit.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,880
Head over.
Is there a McDonald's dollar?

27
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:29,250

35
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,470
Oh,
she sent me another one to me.

36
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:57,660
Undies one,
which I'm wearing me undies right now,

37
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,710
by the way.

38
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,100
Not that you needed to know,
but there's a new.

39
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,070
There's a new underwear sponsor.
Where's the fucking Mandy's thing?

40
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Man,
see,

41
00:02:09,001 --> 00:02:12,690
that's why I hate when people,
when she sends me separate ones.

42
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,130
Hold on a second,
let me find it.

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
Me.
They're the best underwear I've ever 

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,090
had.
I can give you one without any,

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,000
any preparation,
but I'll tell you what.

46
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,520
I didn't think anything of it.
I used to buy cheap underwear.

47
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,050
I used to buy underwear and like a 
package.

48
00:02:28,051 --> 00:02:33,051
Those little plastic packages that you 
get at like Walmart or something like 

49
00:02:33,051 --> 00:02:35,931
that,
just throw it in the cart and keep 

50
00:02:35,931 --> 00:02:37,761
moving.
But when they started sending me these 

51
00:02:37,761 --> 00:02:40,380
Mondays I was like,
what is it just underwear like what's 

52
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:40,380
the big deal?
Well,

53
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,470
this is one big deal.
P,

54
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,520
the average man doesn't change his 
underwear more often than every seven 

55
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:48,900
years.
That's ridiculous.

56
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,230
Like the average male buys a pair of 
underwear and keep that rotten but 

57
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:56,640
filter for seven years.
That's terrible.

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,320
And they're not that comfortable.
They,

59
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,600
they also that weird hole in the front 
that no one understands that shit was 

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,801
made during the depression when people 
didn't understand how to really pay out 

61
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:08,380
of your own music.
What is that whole?

62
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:10,600
Nobody uses that guy down the hall.
Okay.

63
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,630
Do you use that whole shut up anyway?
Me undies.com

64
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:21,490
is seriously the most comfortable 
underwear you have ever tried on you.

65
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,710
We'll try these on and you will say,
oh,

66
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,230
they actually wick moisture away from 
your body.

67
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,990
They feel perfect.
They don't ride up on you.

68
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:33,100
They pull moisture away from your skin 
so that your cool all day long.

69
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,860
I have them right now.
I wear them everyday now.

70
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,390
See only underwear I wear.
Now,

71
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,170
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but if you try me undies.com,

72
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,220
just give it a shot.

73
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,010
Listen to me try it.
And uh,

74
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,330
you will see that there are underwear 
that are better than.

75
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,550
So like everything else,
like someone came along and they figured

76
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,240
out,
they figured out the better mouse trap.

77
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,010
They figured out how to make underwear 
better.

78
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,030
Go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash 
rogen and get 20 percent off of your 

79
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,721
first order.
That's 20 percent off your first order 

80
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:04,630
when you go to [inaudible] dot com 
forward slash rogen.

81
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:09,631
And you'll even get free shipping in the
United States and our friends to the 

82
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:10,900
north in Canada.
Free shipping up there as well.

83
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,640
I guarantee you're going to be happy 
with them.

84
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,530
The best underwear.
Seriously I've ever bought.

85
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:20,010
Go to get that 20 percent off.
Go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash 

86
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:20,350
rogen it.
Last but not least,

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,390
we are brought to you by ting.
If you go to Rogan.ting.com,

88
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,840
you can save 25 bucks off of any of the 
new team devices that they sell at tank 

89
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:33,790
with.

90
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,790
Ting is,
it's a mobile site that is a mobile 

91
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:42,061
service that uses a sprint backbone and 
they buy time on the network on the 

92
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,250
sprint network.
So if you are,

93
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,980
if you were on Ting,
you're actually on the sprint network,

94
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,500
but you do it by tings.
Rules and tings.

95
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,790
Rules will save you money.
My,

96
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,690
my bill last month was 18 bucks.
Excuse me.

97
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,690
Now I don't do a lot of phone calls.
I mostly text,

98
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,340
but that's fucking ridiculous.
Cheap.

99
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,380
18 bucks.
And I go online all the time with it.

100
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,850
A $21 is the average monthly bill per 
device for 10 customers.

101
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,410
Four hundred and $40 is the average 
annual savings for per device,

102
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,310
uh,
for a business with one to 20 employees.

103
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,700
That's a pretty interesting.
What's interesting to me is that 

104
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:24,660
companies are starting to.
It's actually 11 to 20 employees a 

105
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,150
business with 11 to 20 employees.

106
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,160
Four hundred $40 is the average annual 
savings.

107
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,720
Um,
what they've,

108
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,430
what they've done is they've figured out
a way to make you feel better about your

109
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,930
relationship with your cell phone 
provider.

110
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,390
Like for a lot of people sell cell phone
providers,

111
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:42,130
just this big company and they have 
their rules and if you don't,

112
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,620
if you go over your cost,
you money,

113
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:45,970
if you,
you know,

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,700
there's a bunch of weird shit that goes 
on.

115
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:53,701
Like if you want to cancel,
you have to pay some sort of an early 

116
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:53,860
termination fee.
Tings removed,

117
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:56,050
all that.
No early termination fees,

118
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,370
no cancellation fees,
just cancel.

119
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:03,371
That's it.
If you don't want to be a part of them 

120
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:03,371
anymore,
you're gone.

121
00:06:03,371 --> 00:06:03,410
You don't have contracts,
you don't have any of that stuff.

122
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,780
You use what you use and that's what you
pay for it.

123
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,350
You don't have like x amount of minutes 
per month.

124
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,140
It used to be that you would buy a 
certain amount of minutes a month,

125
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,590
like 100 minutes a month,
and if you only use 70 of those minutes,

126
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:17,660
you never got credited for those other 
30 minutes.

127
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,910
So Ting,
they did it first.

128
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:21,590
The first way they did it was the credit
people.

129
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,100
They decided to give people the money 
back and credit their next bill and then

130
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:30,101
they decided like,
why are we charging them for stuff 

131
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:30,101
they're not using anyway?
What's.

132
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:33,670
Let's just set it up so that we charge 
people for what they use and in doing so

133
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,330
you will most certainly save money and 
it's the most logical and reasonable way

134
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,430
to provide cell phone service.
In my opinion.

135
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,210
I don't see why anybody would not want 
to just do it that way.

136
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,480
The only reason is it benefits the cell 
phone providers to charge you a fixed 

137
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:49,480
rate.

138
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,030
Then when you go over that fixed rate,
they hit you with the overage charge and

139
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:55,160
if you go under that fixed rate,
it's to their benefit.

140
00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:00,430
So 10 cut all that stuff out and they 
they provide you with an awesome service

141
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,920
with a great company using the sprint 
backbone and they do it completely 

142
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,950
ethically and I just,
I like doing business with them.

143
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,650
They're the official cell phone provider
for this podcast.

144
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,450
The phone that we use when I coordinate 
guests and make calls and stuff,

145
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:18,530
all that stuff is all through Tang.
If you go to Rogan.ting.com,

146
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,560
you will save 25 bucks off of any of 
their devices and they have all the 

147
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,670
finest android devices in stock.
Like the one that I have is the Samsung 

148
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,330
Galaxy s five,
which is pretty awesome and it has a lot

149
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,950
of features that like even with the new 
iphones that are coming out,

150
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:37,010
it doesn't have like it's water 
resistant,

151
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,040
which I don't understand why these 
people are making electronic devices 

152
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,040
that aren't water resistant.

153
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,270
When they can make ones that are water 
resistant.

154
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,200
It just seems logical.
If you go to Rogan.ting.com,

155
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,440
you can find all the various devices and
if you're a cheap person or frugal or or

156
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,660
you just.
One of those people that realize is 

157
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,250
most,
most of the time you don't really need 

158
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:00,250
the latest and greatest and all this 
shit.

159
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,890
It's just a.
it's a fetish and a lot of ways and if 

160
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:05,890
you're a Weirdo and you're like flip 
phones,

161
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,280
they have those two.
You could buy one of those Samsung,

162
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,250
m for hundreds for 72 bucks.
You can buy one of the older iphones.

163
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,180
You get an iphone four for 100,
12 bucks.

164
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,330
You or you can get an iphone five.
They have iphone five.

165
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:19,930
Iphone five,
s has come in.

166
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,860
They have a the galaxy note three,
the htc one,

167
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,840
m eight,
which is an awesome phone as well.

168
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,060
Anyway.
Rogan.ting.com.

169
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,290
Go there.
Saved money,

170
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,310
be happy.
All right.

171
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,340
Graham Hancock is here.
Why fuck around young Jamie Cube's 

172
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:36,340
music.

173
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:45,450
Joe Rogan podcast,
my friend Graham Hancock.

174
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,090
I'll take these offices.
You're not wearing them.

175
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:49,810
Good to see you,
buddy.

176
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,920
Nice to see you.
Joe.

177
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:52,330
Good to be back.
Good to see you.

178
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,770
Returning from floating.
I saw your tweet

179
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,320
showed a picture of a look like someone 
was in space.

180
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,250
That's how it felt to me.
Now I have to thank you for this because

181
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,290
you are the guy who turned me onto 
floating.

182
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,140
I never did it before.
You spoke to me about it last year.

183
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,750
I was so harassed and so rushed.
I never got.

184
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,810
I never got a chance to do it.
I thought I'd do it when I got back to 

185
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:14,810
England.
It didn't happen,

186
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:18,710
so I got in touch with your friend crash
few weeks before I came out here and he 

187
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:24,171
very kindly fitted me in and I think his
place is called float lab technologies 

188
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:26,490
and they're in the field.
They're there in Venice beach,

189
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,790
so it's a totally new experience for me.
And what made the experience even more 

190
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:35,511
surreal and special because I had asked 
for an appointment fairly late in the 

191
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:35,511
day.

192
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:37,710
Was that.
I mean he needed more notice.

193
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:42,300
He's constantly booked up.
What he could give me was the two rooms,

194
00:09:42,301 --> 00:09:47,301
one for myself,
one for my wife Santha at midnight at 

195
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:47,880
midnight,
two nights in a row,

196
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,820
and actually there's something about 
floating at midnight,

197
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,760
which I think is really.
It's really special.

198
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,120
I don't do any floating during the day.
Right,

199
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,260
right.
It's a really good time.

200
00:09:58,261 --> 00:10:03,261
It's a really good time to do it.
So we went along to Venice beach and 

201
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,440
park the car and crash came out and took
us in.

202
00:10:05,441 --> 00:10:10,441
And first of all he showed us his 
collection of African masks and he has 

203
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:14,781
got the most amazing,
slightly fearsome collection of African 

204
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,630
masks up there.
There's really incredible.

205
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:17,490
Actually it is a deep guy.
He's,

206
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,280
he's a,
he's a trip thinking about a lot of,

207
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,100
a lot of stuff.
And I've been,

208
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,250
I've spent a lot of time in Africa.

209
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,160
I've never seen a collection like that.
It's just just amazing dog on,

210
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:31,161
you know,
some of the really fascinating peoples 

211
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:31,161
and their,
and their mass.

212
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:31,920
Then he takes us down.
He talks us through what it is.

213
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:34,260
So,
you know,

214
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,100
you go into this room and in it I've 
seen in some places they have like a pod

215
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:43,090
where you close,
you close a lit of.

216
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,140
But that's not what he's got.
He's got a bigger room than that.

217
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:49,170
And there's a big full size.
Feels like a huge metal safe.

218
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,750
Um,
if you have trust issues,

219
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,590
you know,
it's a little bit,

220
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:57,591
you've got to,
you're going to close yourself up in a 

221
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:57,591
huge metal,
safe in the darkness.

222
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:58,320
It takes a little bit,
you know,

223
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,380
a little bit of courage is,
I would say is required to do that at 

224
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,470
midnight on Venice beach.
But we did it.

225
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,460
And,
and you know,

226
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:08,850
we got in there at certain warnings.
You don't want to get the salty water in

227
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:10,800
your eyes.
If you do,

228
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:15,801
it's a big distraction.
You don't want to get it in your ears 

229
00:11:15,801 --> 00:11:15,870
because it's got a block.
So you wear ear plugs.

230
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,060
It doesn't bother me.
I just go in with my ears.

231
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,630
I don't worry.
I would prefer to because because the 

232
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,230
feeling of being completely deaf was 
slightly slightly alarming for me.

233
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:27,960
Although I realize a sensory deprivation
is part of the deal.

234
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,760
Um,
and,

235
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:32,430
and uh,
so you close the door,

236
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:37,431
there's a towel hanging off the back of 
the door in case you do get salty water 

237
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:39,180
in your eyes.
And then you just lie down in this,

238
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,070
I guess body temperature,
say line solution in which it's in,

239
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,110
which is impossible to sink and there 
you are in the darkness completely 

240
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,820
without,
without sensation,

241
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,100
totally by yourself.
The first time in

242
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,100
a way ever.
I mean this is what sometimes we're 

243
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,281
alone,
but to be completely alone in total 

244
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:05,911
darkness suspended in that amniotic 
fluid,

245
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:11,341
that strange say line,
say line solution with no sensations 

246
00:12:11,341 --> 00:12:12,340
coming in,
no sounds,

247
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:17,430
no light.
It's an extraordinary opportunity to 

248
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:17,430
meditate,
to reflect,

249
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,830
to just drift away into another place 
and not theirs.

250
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,490
The only danger I would say it happened 
to it,

251
00:12:26,491 --> 00:12:31,491
I kept,
I find it difficult to shut down my 

252
00:12:31,491 --> 00:12:32,350
mind.
My mind is always running and,

253
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,440
and a few times it when I was just 
wanting to let everything go everyday 

254
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,500
concerns and worries came back in and 
started and started annoying me.

255
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:44,770
But most of the time I was able to let 
go and it felt like I was.

256
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,640
I was weightless and I was floating,
floating in space.

257
00:12:48,641 --> 00:12:53,641
That's why I posted that picture on 
facebook today because that's what it 

258
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:53,641
felt like.

259
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:56,380
And sometimes I didn't know whether I 
was horizontal or vertical.

260
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:00,670
I felt like I felt sometimes like I was 
vertically floating vertically.

261
00:13:00,671 --> 00:13:03,100
It was a very odd sensation.
Um,

262
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,180
I wouldn't say that I got into deeply 
trippy space,

263
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:11,770
but I did have fundamental visions.
Patterns.

264
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:14,740
Lights started to,
started to generate purple.

265
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,230
Purple Strips of light started to 
appear,

266
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:19,930
which certainly would not there in the,
in the darkness with me.

267
00:13:19,931 --> 00:13:21,670
And that was,
that was interesting.

268
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:26,671
But most of all was just very relaxing,
just very relaxing to let go,

269
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:33,050
be completely supported by this soft,
gentle water drift,

270
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,890
drift away into the realms of the mind.
It was,

271
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,250
it was a wonderful experience and I felt
much better about it the second day.

272
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,950
Then I did the first.
The first day was some unfamiliarity.

273
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:46,951
The second,
the second night last night was just 

274
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:46,951
amazing.

275
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:46,951
Yeah,
that's what it's all about.

276
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,960
It's all about getting used to the 
experience.

277
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,760
And the more you get used to the 
experience,

278
00:13:49,761 --> 00:13:52,460
the easier it is to slip into the deeper
and deeper states.

279
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,590
Yes,
it's the first time.

280
00:13:54,591 --> 00:13:59,591
It's very alien,
is so odd and is also kind of bump 

281
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,290
against the sides and you have to 
crashes.

282
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,570
African mosques.
Well yeah.

283
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:07,710
You probably shouldn't show you those 
before you go into total darkness in a 

284
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:07,820
meat locker.
Exactly.

285
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,800
Exactly.
But you.

286
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,230
Yeah,
yeah.

287
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,290
The second day,
the second day so much better and so 

288
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,870
much so it's made me think maybe I 
should get myself a flute thing.

289
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,950
Oh,
you definitely should.

290
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,930
It's huge.
I love having one.

291
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,200
I love knowing that anytime I want to go
in there I could just go in there how 

292
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,200
they loads and loads of money or are 
they okay?

293
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,890
Yeah,
there are loads and loads of money.

294
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,210
Thousands and thousands of dollars.
Especially the flash ones.

295
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:37,430
The crash ones rather the um,
the original one that I got which was a 

296
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:40,850
Samadhi tank,
I think that was like six or $7,000,

297
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,610
but crashes are more like 30.
Okay.

298
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,340
Because his car.
Yeah.

299
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,110
It's like it's like buying,
it's like buying a car and it's also,

300
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:53,170
it has these incredible filters.
It's set up through like he has it set 

301
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:57,080
up like the one that I have in my house,
I'm the only one that goes in it,

302
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,010
but if it's a commercial grade 
filtration system,

303
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,250
like he filters things through ozone.
There's all these different various 

304
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,090
steps that it takes.
He's written like an entire,

305
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,060
like multi,
I don't know how many pages.

306
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,070
Probably like 50 or 60 page.
A booklet on the necessity for different

307
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,550
types of filtration and you know what 
he.

308
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,340
I mean he's an obsessive guy and his 
obsession with tanks has made.

309
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's.
There's a guy in Austin that has some 

310
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,280
really amazing tanks to that does it a 
little bit differently.

311
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:33,281
He,
he does it through a company that makes 

312
00:15:33,281 --> 00:15:38,261
boats and his are really excellent too,
but crash is like the leader of the 

313
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:41,210
pack.
He's the master of the game.

314
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,840
There was nothing like his stuff when 
this stuff came out.

315
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,100
Now there's guys like the guy in Atlanta
in a,

316
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,600
in Austin rather that is elevating his.
I,

317
00:15:48,601 --> 00:15:50,760
I spent some time there and checked out 
his facility.

318
00:15:50,761 --> 00:15:52,970
It's beautiful.
He's friends with my friend Aubrey.

319
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,260
But the um,
what,

320
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:00,280
what crash did was,
there was no innovation going on in the 

321
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,340
United States when it came to float 
technology.

322
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,440
There was like the standard somebody 
tank,

323
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,390
which is really great.
I mean,

324
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:10,391
it's cool.
You could definitely get a cool 

325
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:10,391
experience in it.
And then there's some,

326
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:10,391
some,
uh,

327
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:13,991
home models that a few people had,
but what he did is he just took 

328
00:16:13,991 --> 00:16:14,420
everything to the next level and made 
everything,

329
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:18,920
these steel modular boxes that it fits 
together perfectly.

330
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,280
More sound deadening,
more insulation,

331
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,520
better filtration system,
stronger reinforced sides because if 

332
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:32,951
somebody wants,
would kind of go out on the sides a 

333
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,991
little bit from the water and sometimes 
they would rot and like you had to get 

334
00:16:34,991 --> 00:16:36,650
things replaced.
He fixed everything he fixed.

335
00:16:36,651 --> 00:16:41,651
There was an issue with the,
the linings would burn out sometimes 

336
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:46,061
because of the heat pads.
He pads with short out it would burn 

337
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:47,480
through the linings and then would leak 
water everywhere.

338
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,210
He fixed that by,
first of all,

339
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:54,080
by setting like this redundant system.
And having to heat pads too,

340
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:56,570
so if one burns out you have a second 
one ready to go.

341
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,480
And then secondly he put these thick 
pond filters.

342
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,030
He doesn't use like the same kind of 
filters that a lot of people do.

343
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:05,690
Not filters rather liners.
His liners are very thick.

344
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,850
They're for like Koi ponds.

345
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,250
So he's done a lot of innovation.
He's really figured out a lot of 

346
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,371
different things.
It's the place to go if you're lucky 

347
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:15,371
enough to live in la.
Well it's also if you're lucky enough to

348
00:17:15,371 --> 00:17:18,260
be able to get in now because now he's 
booked way in advance.

349
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:19,880
That's what I found.
I mean I read it to him.

350
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:24,881
I wrote to him at least four weeks ago 
and there were just no slots available 

351
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,700
during the day.
He,

352
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,260
that's why he gave me the two midnight 
slot.

353
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:29,600
So that actually I'm really glad he gave
me the midnight slot.

354
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,120
That's the way to do it late at night.
So the way to dentist.

355
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,630
And he's opening a new unit in Westwood.
Yes.

356
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:37,160
Where there'll be seven.
Yeah.

357
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,730
That's not enough.
No.

358
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,750
Even seven's not enough.
I mean there's not.

359
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,580
There's,
you could open up one somewhere that has

360
00:17:43,581 --> 00:17:45,800
50 and that soccer would be filled all 
day.

361
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:50,830
It will be 20 million people in la,
so there's not so many other doing this 

362
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,030
in La right now.
There's a few,

363
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,920
you know,
um,

364
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,930
I think people are starting to become 
aware of it now and it's growing.

365
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Sweet.
We'll amazing experience what one 

366
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,971
question I have and wonder about.
What about if you have a joint before 

367
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:08,430
you get in or take some psilocybin,
what would that do?

368
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,280
I don't know what it's like to not do 
that before you go in and do that.

369
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:15,260
Every soil,
not suicide been,

370
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,100
but I have,
but the um,

371
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:22,150
the pot is,
the edibles are the way to go for about 

372
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,960
an hour before a terrifying supply of 
edibles.

373
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,220
Terrifying dose.
Originally.

374
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,490
What do I do?
And then I get in there.

375
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,530
That's what I like to do.
Okay.

376
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:36,531
That's what,
that's what I'd like to do as well if I 

377
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:36,531
hadn't given up many years ago.

378
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:41,020
It makes me very humble.
There's something about getting in 

379
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,020
there.
It's just a.

380
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,170
and because I've done it so many times,
but you know,

381
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,890
because I have the tank in my house,
I'm super comfortable,

382
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,050
I can,
I can get relaxed with floating.

383
00:18:49,051 --> 00:18:52,800
It's a normal thing to me.
So when you're on the edibles to,

384
00:18:52,801 --> 00:18:55,110
it just takes you to these really,
really,

385
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:58,620
really bizarre places.
No moments of paranoia or fear,

386
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:02,840
you're just calm there.
I wouldn't say that I'm,

387
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:07,910
I'm pretty good with that though.
I mean if I had real problems with 

388
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,860
paranoia and fear,
I wouldn't be able to do everything I do

389
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:11,880
for a living.
Sure.

390
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
You know what I mean?
Everything I do this live,

391
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,280
you know,
everything I do when I do commentary for

392
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,790
the UFC that's live.
Very Edgy.

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Yeah.
All these things are all live and 

394
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,690
they're all depend on maintaining your 
sanity under sometimes pretty intense 

395
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:30,990
pressure.

396
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,430
But um,
so I,

397
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,440
I don't,
I don't have those,

398
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,970
those paranoia or fear issues.
But I certainly feel the,

399
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,720
the,
the,

400
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,320
the thoughts,
I just don't indulge them and I feel the

401
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:48,321
thoughts,
but it's like a lot of ways not indulge 

402
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:48,321
them.
Yeah.

403
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:49,530
It's like a lot of psychedelic 
experiences.

404
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,930
It's a matter of controlling the 
mindset.

405
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,250
I kind of equate it to just the ability 
to communicate on the Internet and the 

406
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,431
ability to access information on the 
Internet is led us to this weird place 

407
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,900
where if you want it to,
your day could be filled with horror.

408
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,230
You could just go everyday to the worst 
possible websites and see the most 

409
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:14,181
horrific videos and the most horrific 
photographs and see the world in the 

410
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:18,141
worst possible light.
If you chose to just immerse yourself.

411
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,480
You know,
just watch the news.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,660
I mean,
even worse the news.

413
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,660
I mean,
if you really wanted to really change 

414
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,890
the way you saw the world when you could
live on a beautiful treeline street with

415
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,830
the nicest neighbors and you know,
the,

416
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:34,950
the cutest little dogs bark in and the 
life looks beautiful,

417
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,380
but through the portal that is the 
Internet,

418
00:20:37,381 --> 00:20:40,600
you can immerse yourself in twisted 
sadistic minds and,

419
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,590
and it's like you have this decision to 
not do that.

420
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,770
And that's in,
in,

421
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,990
in,
in sort of reinforcing that decision and

422
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:52,510
in and um,
you know,

423
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:57,790
making those choices.
You build up your resistance to doing 

424
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,591
things that are negative,
you build up your resistance to 

425
00:21:01,591 --> 00:21:03,130
indulging in negative thoughts and in 
that sense I think it's good,

426
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,400
like one of the weirdest things is have 
you ever seen someone who's never been 

427
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,400
in any sort of a conflict type 
situation,

428
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:14,610
but they get thrown into one and they 
have a panic attack and they 

429
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:14,620
hyperventilate and they don't know what 
to do?

430
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,740
It's very weird.
I've seen it happen many times and then 

431
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,431
I've seen other people that are in panic
situations or or rather high stress 

432
00:21:23,431 --> 00:21:27,301
situations a lot and they know how to 
stay calm and keep cool and I think 

433
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:28,630
sometimes your life can depend on it.
Sure.

434
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,390
Very much so.
As a killer scuba diving,

435
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,430
which I did a lot of panic.
Panic will kill you.

436
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:36,190
I would imagine.
I'm terrified of scuba diving.

437
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:41,191
I've never done it,
but I would imagine that being a 100 

438
00:21:41,191 --> 00:21:42,950
feet down in the ocean where the winds 
are moving occurrence.

439
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:44,790
Yeah.
Banging you against rocks and stuff.

440
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,920
That's got to be your lays it down there
and you really gone.

441
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

442
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,470
That's a.
that's a whole nother world.

443
00:21:50,471 --> 00:21:53,920
I did some snorkeling recently with 
dolphins.

444
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,380
I was in Hawaii and uh,
I actually did it with my four year old 

445
00:21:59,380 --> 00:21:59,380
to.

446
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,750
I took her with me into the water and 
you know,

447
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:06,751
she had the mask on and everything and 
she's like looking down and seeing the 

448
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:07,540
dolphins swimming under us.
It was amazing,

449
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,480
really incredibly rewarding.
Did they come and scan,

450
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,770
you know,
they didn't,

451
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:15,210
they just swam underneath us,
you know,

452
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,220
they really didn't give a shit about us.
Really kind of one of those weird 

453
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:20,350
looking things up there.
They just,

454
00:22:20,351 --> 00:22:21,840
you know,
it's kind of a,

455
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,050
it's an eyeopener,
like how little of a shit dolphins care.

456
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:31,740
They don't care about you man,
as long as you're not trying to capture 

457
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:31,740
them,
the more people,

458
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,550
whatever.
Avoid the boat,

459
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,140
you know,
they came near the boat.

460
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I've,
I've been around them though when 

461
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,511
they're very playful too,
like we're fishing once and they were 

462
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,240
jumping by the boat and being really 
playful with us.

463
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,130
This was a totally different experience.

464
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,060
This was,
they just pretty much indifferent but so

465
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:50,740
beautiful.
Like just being around them,

466
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,500
hundreds of dolphins and you're looking 
at him swimming underneath you.

467
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,240
But yeah,
I could imagine that panic in that world

468
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,250
when something goes wrong,
you know,

469
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,280
adapt than an occurrence.
If you panic,

470
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:07,180
you literally are dad because that's 
what you have to stay steady and that's,

471
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,950
that's the power of the mind.
You have to.

472
00:23:08,951 --> 00:23:10,450
It's mind over matter.
You have to.

473
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:14,530
You have to impose your mind on that,
on that,

474
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,620
on that situation.
Because I don't know why actually if we 

475
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,401
have all this evolution,
why we Pattanaik I would've thought 

476
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,740
billions of years of evolution would 
have got rid of that terrible dangerous 

477
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,700
thinking,
but actually it's there though.

478
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,580
So necessary.
It sharpens your,

479
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,350
your reflexes.
It's one of the things about fighters is

480
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:40,351
that a fighter going into a fight and 
not being nervous can be incredibly 

481
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:40,351
dangerous.
Yes,

482
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:44,640
and when I was competing,
there were moments that I was too 

483
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,010
confident and I went in and I couldn't 
compete.

484
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:45,950
Right.
I didn't,

485
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,130
I couldn't.
And I also couldn't snap myself out of 

486
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,681
it.
Like there's a level that you achieve 

487
00:23:53,681 --> 00:23:54,380
when you're really nervous and you're 
not sure of what the outcome is going to

488
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,000
be there.
Like our,

489
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:59,030
a level of reaction and of intensity 
that you achieve when you go into the,

490
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:03,830
into a competition where you're scared,
where you perform so much better.

491
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,600
Right?
Right.

492
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,010
And then there's like,
when you're super confident,

493
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,400
you feel there's something that happens 
where you're not nervous at all,

494
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:13,160
you can't get up for it.
It's a weird thing that happens.

495
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,150
So that adrenaline is,
I think it's a necessary component.

496
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:22,330
It gives you that extra charge.
It's just about managing that and 

497
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,290
managing very difficult was interesting.
I watched a told you a few months ago,

498
00:24:24,291 --> 00:24:29,291
I watched this Hixon Gracie,
a movie choke choke and that's one of 

499
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:32,000
the things that he said quite early on 
in the movie.

500
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,960
He said,
actually,

501
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,230
he's always afraid.
He doesn't say I'm a field person that 

502
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,300
he says,
he says,

503
00:24:38,301 --> 00:24:39,460
I'm always afraid.
Yeah.

504
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,210
And,
and yeah,

505
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:43,430
it's managing,
it's managing that.

506
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,230
What a formidable fighter.
That guy,

507
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,520
he's an amazing guy to,
uh,

508
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,310
we had on the podcast recently,
him and my friend Eddie Bravo together.

509
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,750
It was just a huge treat for me as a 
martial arts,

510
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,590
lifelong martial arts practitioner and 
fan because he's a real master.

511
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,260
Fascinating,
fascinating.

512
00:25:02,261 --> 00:25:05,030
The guy that documentary.
I recommend that to everybody.

513
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:07,520
Even people that don't do martial arts 
like yourself.

514
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:08,990
You wait,
how'd you hear about it?

515
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,500
Okay.
Well,

516
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:13,700
my son in law,
Jason Sarris does mixed martial arts.

517
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,360
He does particularly Brazilian Jujitsu 
at a place called Ama clinic in London 

518
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,980
and he does it three,
four times a week.

519
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:23,150
He's very,
very,

520
00:25:23,151 --> 00:25:24,950
very devoted to it.
And he's,

521
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,530
he's been talking me through a lot of 
these issues over the last year and,

522
00:25:29,531 --> 00:25:30,000
uh,
I,

523
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,740
I get it.

524
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,830
I get,
I get why he loves it and I think it's 

525
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,171
been.
I think it's been a really great thing 

526
00:25:38,171 --> 00:25:38,490
for him and I think it's a really,
it's a really great thing for him to be.

527
00:25:38,491 --> 00:25:41,300
There was a time in my life when I did 
do a martial art.

528
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,490
I did,
I quito.

529
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,990
Uh,
I got to Brown belt,

530
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,220
uh,
in my very early twenties and then I 

531
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:50,220
quit.
I'm not quite sure why I traveled.

532
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,860
I went away,
I lost the practice,

533
00:25:51,861 --> 00:25:55,390
and then in my forties I went back to it
and I worked my way back up to,

534
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,010
to greenbelt.
But I.

535
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,970
Quito is a different thing from,
from this,

536
00:25:59,971 --> 00:26:01,620
this real grappling.
I mean,

537
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:04,690
this Brazilian Jujitsu,
what I see is to,

538
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,330
to people who are into locked and 
they're sent the sensing each other,

539
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,610
each other's movements all the time is 
that you can't,

540
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,890
you can't predict what's going to happen
next in any,

541
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,640
in any way.

542
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,640
And,
and I understand that it's a kind of 

543
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,250
meditative thing also that,
that if,

544
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,390
if you actually start thinking,
I imagine because I don't do it,

545
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,280
but this is what my son had low tells 
me.

546
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:30,281
If you start thinking while you're in 
there in that grapple with that other 

547
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:31,280
very strong,
very dangerous person,

548
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,890
I don't think that's really good.
I think you have to not,

549
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,920
you have to not be thinking.
You have to be acting somehow on muscle 

550
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:38,920
memory,
on,

551
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:38,920
on,
on,

552
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,650
on instinct,
on experience.

553
00:26:39,651 --> 00:26:41,630
You're not really thinking through your 
next move or are you,

554
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:43,500
I don't know,
sometimes you're thinking,

555
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:43,920
but

556
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,710
a lot of times you are reacting on,
in,

557
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:49,500
uh,
in what you try to do is achieve sort of

558
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:52,950
a zen state of flow state and when 
you're at your best,

559
00:26:52,951 --> 00:26:57,951
you're in that flow state where 
sometimes you'll be in a position where 

560
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:59,400
you don't even realize how you achieved 
the position.

561
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,070
You just,
you just instinctively did it.

562
00:27:02,071 --> 00:27:06,450
And it's instinctive based on thousands 
of repetitions,

563
00:27:06,451 --> 00:27:08,400
many,
many hours of mat time.

564
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,020
Matt,
Matt Time's very important.

565
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,490
Matt time being the actual sparring 
itself because the rolling,

566
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,690
the grappling,
sparring,

567
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:20,040
you understand like the language of,
of human interaction.

568
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Like there's a,
there's an interaction between a person 

569
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,440
attacking,
a person defending and there's just like

570
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:27,990
this thing that goes on.
We kind of figure out,

571
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:31,140
yes,
this is something that in daily life,

572
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,570
in a modern technological society,
most people have no experience.

573
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:39,571
So the tool and they never in a,
in a fight situation,

574
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,420
never ever having to having to deal with
that.

575
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:47,420
So if they suddenly find themselves in a
situation of danger attacked on the 

576
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,561
street,
they're not going to have the faintest 

577
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:51,561
idea what to do.
No,

578
00:27:51,561 --> 00:27:52,220
well hopefully that never comes up 
anywhere else.

579
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,320
But the benefits extend outside of that,
in my opinion,

580
00:27:55,321 --> 00:27:58,350
the benefits are it's,
it's,

581
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,590
it prepares you for like the drama of 
regular life pales in comparison to the 

582
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:12,050
real drama of training and have of 
competing inside the gymnasium.

583
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,370
Because essentially every time someone 
does Jujitsu,

584
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:20,070
they're competing.
Every time you spar,

585
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,920
even if you spar with a very good 
friend,

586
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,080
he's still competing.
You know,

587
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:30,210
you get used to this struggle and that's
something that most people don't.

588
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,310
They don't have in their life.
And in,

589
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,090
in having that struggle and in this 
competition,

590
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:41,600
it makes the regular stress that people 
go through the stress of bills and have 

591
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,060
relationships and it,
it,

592
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:49,370
it alleviates,
mitigates a lot of the issues that 

593
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,090
people have because the life or death 
struggle.

594
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,570
If someone trying to choke you and you 
battling it out and you're tired,

595
00:28:54,571 --> 00:28:59,571
you're exhausted and you've tried to 
remain calm and catch your breath and 

596
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,781
defend and trying to stay cool and 
trying to figure out what's the proper 

597
00:29:02,781 --> 00:29:07,341
defense for this situation and how to 
turn this around and how to get back to 

598
00:29:07,341 --> 00:29:07,390
a better spot.
Uh,

599
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,740
it's,
it's so harrowing and it's so.

600
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,440
It's so stressful,
but in a good way.

601
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,200
So you're totally in the moment.
Yes.

602
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,470
Oh yeah.
Totally.

603
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:21,471
In the moment you're thinking about all 
the other shit girl you dated when 

604
00:29:21,471 --> 00:29:21,960
you're in high school where she now 
you're not thinking about that,

605
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,770
you know,
the bills you've got to pay or no,

606
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,840
no,
you're not thinking about any of those 

607
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:28,840
things.
And in that sense it is very meditative.

608
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,910
It alleviates a lot of the stress of 
life.

609
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:32,240
And then when it's over,
you just kind of,

610
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:37,410
you feel very relaxed because you spent 
all this excess energy that I believe 

611
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:38,430
people.

612
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,520
I mean,
this is not a scientific way of looking 

613
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,801
at the body,
but I think of the human body and a lot 

614
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,971
of ways as sort of like a battery and a 
lot of people's batteries are 

615
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:49,030
overflowing with Jews because you don't 
use them.

616
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,630
You sit down and sedentary state in 
front of a computer all day,

617
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:57,631
which is pretty bad for your back and 
you stare at a screen and you do your 

618
00:29:57,631 --> 00:30:01,801
work and then you sit in your car or on 
the train or whatever to get home and 

619
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:02,530
then you sit in front of the television.
That's.

620
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,470
That's a lot of people's lives.
Absolutely.

621
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,490
That's not normal for a body.
The body is supposed to be moving while 

622
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:11,890
you're young and alive and why you have 
energy.

623
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,100
You're supposed to be.
Your body wants to be involved in 

624
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,471
activities.
Your body wants to go hiking and do 

625
00:30:19,471 --> 00:30:21,631
things and if he doesn't,
it atrophies and shrivels up and it 

626
00:30:21,631 --> 00:30:24,850
stops being functional and when you can 
get all that energy out,

627
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,160
I'm in a training session.

628
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,600
It does a couple things.
One,

629
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:33,601
it strengthens your body,
so if you ever do have to use it for 

630
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:36,451
something,
even just something as simple as like 

631
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:38,730
picking things up or just strength to 
help move something you have that,

632
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,540
but to you you alleviate all the excess 
energy,

633
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,780
you drain the battery a bit and by 
draining the battery you put more juice 

634
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,681
in the battery for the future.
Like the battery has like a higher 

635
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:54,880
threshold and then you also like,
you can deal with stuff easier.

636
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,370
Like when I don't train,
if I don't exercise,

637
00:30:57,371 --> 00:31:00,200
if I don't do some sort of rigorous,
rigorous physical exercise,

638
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:03,460
like at least a few days a week,
I will react differently to stress.

639
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,530
Right.
You start getting snappish and.

640
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,200
Yeah,
well I get more irritated than I should.

641
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:11,230
I affects me more than it should,
but when,

642
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,600
when I train,
like if I train a lot,

643
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,940
it's everything is pretty easy.
Yeah.

644
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:16,020
Yeah.

645
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,870
I've seen this effect on my son in law 
is a couple of years now of doing this.

646
00:31:19,871 --> 00:31:21,730
He's been,
it's really transformed him.

647
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:23,860
It's really,
really great thing and they will benefit

648
00:31:23,861 --> 00:31:24,400
from it.
I mean,

649
00:31:24,401 --> 00:31:26,200
I'm 64 years old.
I don't know.

650
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,870
I don't think I can go and do that stuff
now.

651
00:31:28,871 --> 00:31:30,880
I don't know if you found another 64 
year old.

652
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:31,960
Yeah.
Okay.

653
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:34,480
Or I could work with one with one 
personal,

654
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,220
one personal teacher,
you know,

655
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:36,850
to,
to,

656
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,790
you know,
to who would understand my level.

657
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,010
I see it.
I see huge advantages in doing it.

658
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:47,011
I think it's,
I've got more and more interested in it 

659
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:47,011
over the last couple of years.
It's really fascinating thing.

660
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:48,430
And also tell me about this.
I mean,

661
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,690
in a way you're being a warrior in there
in a way,

662
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,190
in a way.
It's a warrior thing.

663
00:31:54,191 --> 00:31:56,620
I mean,
this is a contentious issue.

664
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,490
The human race.
We've been around it anatomically modern

665
00:32:00,491 --> 00:32:05,491
form for the last 200,000
years for a lot of time.

666
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,830
Our young men,
um,

667
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,950
in many societies have been,
have been called to warfare in one form 

668
00:32:14,471 --> 00:32:19,471
or another.
I would say that it's gone on long 

669
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:22,291
enough for it to be a fundamental part 
of the human experience actually,

670
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,770
um,
in our society today,

671
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,340
a lot has a lot,
has worked to move that aside and 

672
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,130
probably that's a,
that's a very good thing.

673
00:32:33,131 --> 00:32:36,820
Although we still do have war of course,
but it's done at a distance.

674
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:39,650
Largely it's done.
It's not.

675
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,220
I mean I'm writing,
I'm writing novels about the Spanish 

676
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,130
conquest of Mexico at the moment I am 
dealing with,

677
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,160
I'm getting inside the heads of warriors
and those guys are on the battlefield 

678
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,150
hand to hand with edged weapons.
That kind of experience of battle and 

679
00:32:56,151 --> 00:32:59,510
warfare doesn't happen.
I think much in modern warfare today.

680
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,430
It's,
you know,

681
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,250
it's more that guy remotely part think 
piloting a drone and shooting people,

682
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,980
shooting people from it from a distance,
but maybe there is.

683
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,850
Maybe there is a warrior need in us 
which,

684
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,940
which can be met in a harmless and 
positive way on the mat in something 

685
00:33:17,231 --> 00:33:19,160
like mixed martial arts.
That's what I'm coming to.

686
00:33:19,161 --> 00:33:19,700
Which you agree with.

687
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,550
It's very possible that there's 
something to that.

688
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,760
I think it's very possible that there's 
something to the idea that we have 

689
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,490
ingrained in us a certain amount of 
experiences based on the genetics of all

690
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:36,491
the people that have lived before us and
that whatever fight or flight is inside 

691
00:33:36,831 --> 00:33:41,270
of us,
whatever mean throughout history like w.

692
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:46,390
I've been discussing this with friends 
like how fascinating this time is 

693
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:46,940
because throughout history,
in the past,

694
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,180
if a boat of stranger showed up,
it was very dangerous.

695
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,010
Yeah.
A boat showed up and you're like,

696
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:53,510
Holy Shit,
it's gonna.

697
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,610
Get crazy.
A bunch of men climb off the boat.

698
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:59,150
You gotta hide women and children and 
now when a boat shows up,

699
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:01,490
it's tourism and everybody gets excited 
like,

700
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,480
oh,
we need their money.

701
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,430
Come on.
Come to this island.

702
00:34:04,431 --> 00:34:06,830
Come to this place,
bring your family.

703
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,110
It's a completely different world that 
we live in.

704
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,090
It is,
and those,

705
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:16,630
those experiences that led us to,
that led the human race in 2014.

706
00:34:16,791 --> 00:34:20,720
These experiences of people pirates 
showing up and Viking showing up and all

707
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:22,790
those dangerous people showing up in 
these different places.

708
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:28,130
You know,
people coming over the hill on armies 

709
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,430
coming.
That was just a part of being a human 

710
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:30,430
being for the longest time for a very 
long time.

711
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:33,100
Have you seen this new thing that was 
going on about the,

712
00:34:33,101 --> 00:34:38,101
uh,
the autopsy of a witch King of England 

713
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:39,450
second or we should the third.
Yeah.

714
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,830
They found his bones,
which is really amazing,

715
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:47,831
man.
They found his bones like they found it 

716
00:34:47,831 --> 00:34:49,160
under a,
like a parking lot or parking lot.

717
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:49,530
Yeah.
Yeah.

718
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:52,060
Crazy man.
I don't know.

719
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:52,580
It's him.

720
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,550
I think that there's,
there's a long tradition regarding him 

721
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,190
and the battle that he was killed in and
there's a famous,

722
00:34:59,191 --> 00:35:02,790
these even a shakespeare play where he's
at the end of the battle saying famously

723
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:03,870
my horse,
my horse,

724
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:04,980
a horse,
a horse,

725
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:07,290
my kingdom for a horse so that he can 
flee.

726
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:12,291
But it seems that he died in face to 
face combat was hacked to pieces as far 

727
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:14,630
as like one of the last of the,
the,

728
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,400
the,
the kings to die like that too.

729
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,810
To die in combat.
Yeah,

730
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:23,870
it would.
We're in those sort of late 14 hundreds 

731
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:23,870
there.
I would say I would say so.

732
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:28,280
I mean,
combat went on the period I'm writing 

733
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:28,280
about fifth,
early 15.

734
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,710
Hundreds was brutal and bloody brutal 
and bloody period at man like hernand.

735
00:35:31,711 --> 00:35:34,710
Cortez is a leader,
but he's a killer.

736
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:37,680
He's a coldblooded.
He's a cold killer.

737
00:35:37,681 --> 00:35:38,490
I,
I

738
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,900
think that,
that kind of,

739
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:45,050
that kind of experience is Israel today.
Does it freak you out when you read 

740
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,440
stuff about like these these days and 
realize that that,

741
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,400
that all could happen today.
We just,

742
00:35:50,401 --> 00:35:55,401
we need the wrong set of events to take 
place to where we're not far removed as 

743
00:35:55,411 --> 00:36:00,411
a species from that time in terms of the
actual history,

744
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,260
like gets the blink of an eye between 
then and now a blink of an eye.

745
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,020
We are the same people.
Nothing's changed.

746
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:09,000
Um,
there's been some,

747
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,440
there's been some social changes,
but look,

748
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:14,550
we're still slaughtering people on a 
large scale in large scale levels.

749
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:17,070
It's just that it's just that,
that hand tan face to face thing.

750
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,370
Technology has intervened a little bit 
in that.

751
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:23,970
Um,
if our society were to go into a radical

752
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:28,971
collapse,
people could find themselves facing 

753
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:31,190
those contingencies very quickly,
very,

754
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,250
very,
very rapidly.

755
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,520
And it is in fact in a radical collapse 
and other parts of the world.

756
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:40,550
I've been talking,
I've been talking about this on stage a 

757
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:40,550
lot lately because there's a lot of 
these.

758
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,170
This is duck dynasty guy.
That's hilarious.

759
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:46,710
It's duck dynasty,
ridiculous American reality show.

760
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,620
But one of the main guys on duck 
dynasty,

761
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,880
um,
he gave this speech and it's video 

762
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,981
speech where he was talking about the 
impending apocalypse and what they call 

763
00:36:58,311 --> 00:37:03,311
the rapture.
We Christians think that Jesus is going 

764
00:37:03,311 --> 00:37:06,391
to come and he's going to take away 
everybody that's Christian and bring 

765
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,440
them to heaven and everybody else is 
going to be stuck on earth.

766
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,950
I believe that is a very elite group.
We're going to go 144,000

767
00:37:10,951 --> 00:37:14,670
of them are going to be floated with the
idea with the rupture.

768
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,730
And he told people that they should 
watch this Nicholas cage movie that's 

769
00:37:20,461 --> 00:37:23,610
about to come out and called left 
behind.

770
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,670
That's based on this very famous series 
of books amongst the Christians have 

771
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,960
left behind like these these people 
have.

772
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:32,840
He doesn't use somebody who doesn't get 
raptured.

773
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,530
Is that.
Is that the.

774
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,650
I guess?
Yeah.

775
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,540
I don't know.
It's so fucking stupid.

776
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,670
It's so stupid.
It's.

777
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:42,671
It hurts my brain to talk about it,
but what's fascinating is that they're 

778
00:37:42,671 --> 00:37:44,120
all worried about.
Everyone's worried about the apocalypse,

779
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,280
apocalypse,
apocalypse,

780
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:45,990
the end,
the end,

781
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,670
but the apocalypse,
if you go to certain parts of the world,

782
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,500
it's there.
It's there.

783
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:55,350
It's in Liberia right now.
It's in Somalia right now.

784
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,270
Right now.
Listen,

785
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:59,760
back in the 19 seventies,
I lived in Mogadishu.

786
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:01,510
I lived in Somalia.
I lived in that,

787
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:06,730
that failed state.
It was fine place then back then it was 

788
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:06,730
fine.
Yeah,

789
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,170
it was fine.
Why was it fine?

790
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,730
I mean,
this is not politically correct,

791
00:38:08,731 --> 00:38:12,160
but it was run by a dictator and he kept
things come.

792
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:17,270
You know,
if that has been the case in many 

793
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,030
unfortunate scenarios.
I mean,

794
00:38:18,031 --> 00:38:20,240
that's what's argued about Iraq.
And,

795
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,260
uh,
if you look at Iraq before the US 

796
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,141
invasion,
it was largely superior to what it is 

797
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:27,141
now,
a vastly superior to what it is now.

798
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:27,480
Again,
I mean,

799
00:38:27,481 --> 00:38:27,980
we're not,
you know,

800
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,340
kind of not supposed to say these 
things,

801
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:33,180
but honestly,
for the average Iraqi living in Iraq,

802
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,680
things were a whole lot better under 
Hussein.

803
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:36,370
It was peaceful.

804
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,130
It was,
there were,

805
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:41,020
there was not a lot of interreligious 
conflict.

806
00:38:41,021 --> 00:38:43,270
When was the secular state?
It was a secular state.

807
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,720
They in fact,
quite tolerant and,

808
00:38:44,721 --> 00:38:47,530
and all you had to do was not getting 
the face of Saddam Hussein.

809
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:51,010
That was the simple.
That was the simple rule of life.

810
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,840
Just don't get in the face of Saddam 
Hussein.

811
00:38:52,841 --> 00:38:55,660
And that was a simple rule of life in 
Somalia in the 19 seventies.

812
00:38:55,661 --> 00:38:58,210
Don't get in the face of Siad Barre.
If you do,

813
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,810
I'll tell you a story.
See [inaudible] Muhammad Siad Barre,

814
00:39:00,811 --> 00:39:04,390
who was the president of Somalia when I,
when I went there in 1975,

815
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,670
um,
he,

816
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,690
he did a number of interesting things.
For example,

817
00:39:07,691 --> 00:39:10,780
there's Somali language was not written.
This was a nomadic society,

818
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:15,781
70 percent nomadic.
He introduced a written script for this 

819
00:39:15,781 --> 00:39:17,380
amount of language based on the Latin 
alphabet.

820
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:22,830
This had not been possible before 
because religious leaders had said they 

821
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,590
had to have it in the Arabic script 
because they were Muslims.

822
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:28,830
He just forced that through.
Then he introduced a family law which 

823
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,740
allowed women to divorce their husbands.
At that point,

824
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,840
11 religious leaders,
11 shakes,

825
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,990
mobilize the public and said they had to
rebel against Siad Barre.

826
00:39:34,991 --> 00:39:35,590
Well,
what he did,

827
00:39:35,591 --> 00:39:39,100
he hold those guys out of the mosque the
very same day and shot them all and that

828
00:39:39,101 --> 00:39:44,101
was the.
That was the end of that argument and 

829
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:45,800
suddenly women,
women could divorce their husbands and 

830
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,541
the society was very free and very open.
One can't imagine today from the scenes 

831
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:51,520
of horror that we see from Mogadishu 
actually how peaceful it was.

832
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:53,890
So you know,
it may be the case that in some,

833
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,310
in some situations,
and Iraq is definitely another example.

834
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,260
You know,
we in the West are constantly saying,

835
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:01,330
we must have democracy.
Democracy is a great thing.

836
00:40:01,331 --> 00:40:02,770
Well,
maybe it is a great thing.

837
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:04,210
At a certain point,
at a certain level,

838
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,310
when you're in a society that's very 
sectarian,

839
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:11,311
very divided into tribal interests,
very divided into different religious 

840
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:14,431
groups.
Maybe it's actually more comfortable if 

841
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:14,431
you have a dictator.
Well,

842
00:40:14,431 --> 00:40:18,271
there's a power vacuum issue that I 
think the issue is we civilizations

843
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:23,910
largely operate on momentum and when 
things have been set up in the way that 

844
00:40:25,511 --> 00:40:30,511
they have been in Iraq or the way they 
have been obviously in Somalia where 

845
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:34,741
there's one guy who's calling all the 
shots and they've Kinda got this whole 

846
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:38,251
thing established when that guy's not 
there anymore and then everyone's 

847
00:40:38,251 --> 00:40:40,480
scrambling to be the new guy.
Everyone's scrambling creates chaos,

848
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,530
absolute hell,
and it creates this intense violence 

849
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,340
amongst the people like they are our 
Iraq.

850
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,790
The people that are in that civil war 
state that they're at now where various 

851
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,040
sections of their population are vying 
for control of this failed state.

852
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,690
It's horrific.
It's horrific.

853
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,720
You have this hideous death cult called 
the Islamic state,

854
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,710
which may or may not have been initially
funded and set setup by the United 

855
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,670
States of America and it's allies who 
knows who.

856
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Who knows,
but it's a death cult and it's just 

857
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:16,680
horrible.
Give it.

858
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,491
Frankly,
I would rather have Saddam Hussein a 

859
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:19,491
then the Islamic state.

860
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:20,020
Crazy thing to say,
right.

861
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:22,300
The one evil is better than the other 
evil.

862
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,340
These obviously we're.
We're only talking in objective reality 

863
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:27,340
terms here.
We're not.

864
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,440
We're not saying,
hey,

865
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:28,800
it's okay

866
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,750
to be addicted.
No,

867
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,200
not at all.
It's evil to be a dictator.

868
00:41:31,201 --> 00:41:34,550
Clearly it's the same as a terrible,
so evil and wrong and we don't.

869
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:39,830
Ideally we moved to a state where a 
situation where we have no governments 

870
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,780
and where people run their own lives and
peacefully negotiate with one another,

871
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:46,781
but that isn't the way it's going down 
in Iraq and it's not the way it's gone 

872
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:47,040
down in the southern part of Somalia.
Yeah,

873
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,530
that would be ideal,
right?

874
00:41:48,531 --> 00:41:52,280
But it's really hard to run a bunch of 
people,

875
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:57,410
like the idea of a society.
The idea of taking a million people,

876
00:41:57,411 --> 00:41:59,300
500 million people,
whatever the number is,

877
00:41:59,301 --> 00:42:04,301
and having a group of people that adhere
to the best interest of all the folks 

878
00:42:04,761 --> 00:42:06,580
that are in that society.
One of the.

879
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,370
Their,
their,

880
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,880
their needs are so varied,
their resources are so varied there.

881
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,940
The fortune in what situation they find 
themselves born into is so very.

882
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,890
And then you have the people that are 
fortunate,

883
00:42:18,891 --> 00:42:23,891
sons and daughters that are trying to 
keep the unfortunate from getting into 

884
00:42:23,891 --> 00:42:25,480
their gated community of life.
So much crazy.

885
00:42:25,481 --> 00:42:30,481
And then you can be sure that dictators,
sons and daughters are all very well 

886
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:30,620
looked after in a dictatorship that 
always happens.

887
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:32,700
Like sometimes kids like kids,
it's,

888
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,950
it always the case,
you know,

889
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:38,951
that they are.
And that then generates feelings of 

890
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:38,951
anger and fury that that is,
that,

891
00:42:38,951 --> 00:42:43,150
that is happening.
But a situation where just bullets are 

892
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,570
flying down the street constantly and 
you're live.

893
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,920
You live in permanent fear of your life.
Uh,

894
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,380
that's not good either.
Yeah.

895
00:42:48,381 --> 00:42:53,381
The arguments that United States is 
funded isis in order to build up support

896
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:57,670
for an invasion of Saudi Arabia or 
Syria,

897
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:02,940
or rather a really terrifying and more 
terrifying because I don't want to look 

898
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,100
into it because I don't want to know.

899
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,460
It's a horrible thought.
I don't even want to know.

900
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,070
I know that that kind of shit has 
happened before,

901
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:11,990
so when you see that it's happening now,
you're like,

902
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,420
oh fuck.
Is this really going on?

903
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:18,870
Is that really what's causing all this 
profoundly depressing and the product?

904
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,880
The problem is that we can't really 
believe anything that our political 

905
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,660
leaders and the west side,
I mean they are.

906
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,590
They have been proven to be a absolute 
crooks.

907
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:35,591
Thieves and liars.
They lie by instinct all the time and 

908
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:39,551
that probably problem with constant 
lying at the top levels of politics is 

909
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:44,171
that it pollutes the debate completely.
You suddenly can't believe anything 

910
00:43:44,171 --> 00:43:47,051
that's said and that leads to suspicion 
of all of all kinds of horrendous 

911
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:52,061
possibilities including the funding and 
setting in motion of this isis horror 

912
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:57,710
and it doesn't help when someone like 
Julian assange comes along and exposes 

913
00:43:57,710 --> 00:43:59,390
all these things that a lot of people 
disagree with and what do they do?

914
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:04,190
They try to get them locked up on some 
trumped up charges and export them as if

915
00:44:04,191 --> 00:44:06,620
they were really trying to export him 
from,

916
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,790
from,
you know,

917
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:13,060
to to Sweden and eventually to the 
United States because of some sexual 

918
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,020
thing that wasn't even seems so violent.
He wasn't even rape.

919
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,750
It was consensual.
Some weird sexual charge.

920
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,420
Like I think they call it surprised sex 
or something like that.

921
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:21,800
It's not.
They're not even calling it rape.

922
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,110
Right.
There's one thing that like if there was

923
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:26,510
a woman who was saying,
Hey Julian Assan,

924
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:27,950
she's a piece of shit.
He drugged me,

925
00:44:27,951 --> 00:44:29,380
raped me,
okay,

926
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,070
yeah,
send that guy to Sweden,

927
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,400
but they're not even saying

928
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,400
that if this isn't a charge that makes 
any sense.

929
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,520
And the fact that this guy has been 
locked up in the embassy in London for 

930
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,370
all these years,
it's crazy.

931
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,560
It's crazy.
It was a very crazy situation.

932
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,330
It's really weird to see,
man,

933
00:44:45,331 --> 00:44:50,331
it's really weird to see him on 
television doing these skype interviews 

934
00:44:50,331 --> 00:44:54,021
and knowing that he's in this embassy 
and then the moment he steps out of 

935
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:54,021
that,
they're going to snatch him up.

936
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:56,970
It's like he's just being protected by 
some weird loophole.

937
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:57,760
Yes.
Yeah.

938
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,740
Well,
you could take,

939
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,330
take,
take sanctuary in an embassy.

940
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:01,680
At some it's an old.
It's an old law.

941
00:45:01,681 --> 00:45:06,681
You can't leave,
like he's going to have to dig a hole 

942
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:09,890
underneath that motherfucker oil out of 
the street and then pop out of a manhole

943
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:16,480
and a scoop them up in a car and take 
them to Costa Rica or somewhere where 

944
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,030
they're gonna honor that we live in a 
time when they're just that.

945
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Just constant conspiracy theories.
I mean there's even conspiracy theories 

946
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:24,040
about him,
you know,

947
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:29,090
he is,
that he is part of the problem rather 

948
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:29,090
than part of the course.
All of that,

949
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:30,240
all of that happens.
Nothing is,

950
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,990
nothing is believed anymore and that the
problem that comes from,

951
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:39,330
uh,
the proven fact that our political 

952
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,740
leaders are actually liars.
The upside to us again and again,

953
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,540
and,
and how can we,

954
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,600
how can we trust them?
How can we entrust ourselves to them 

955
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,090
when they,
when they behave in that way,

956
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:50,880
what's needed is,
is transparency.

957
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:55,910
What's needed is open.
Do you think the transparency is going 

958
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:55,910
to be an eventuality because of the 
Internet?

959
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,280
I think it is right.
I think gets blown wide open.

960
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:04,310
It's very difficult to keep secrets and 
it also erodes faith in the leadership 

961
00:46:04,321 --> 00:46:07,110
when like,
is this a democracy?

962
00:46:07,111 --> 00:46:12,111
Is this a representative government or 
is it some sort of a weird dictatorship 

963
00:46:12,111 --> 00:46:12,240
because of it is a democracy.

964
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:12,840
Hello?
Fuck,

965
00:46:12,841 --> 00:46:14,510
are you keeping that guy locked up?
How?

966
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,420
How is Julian assange still locked up?
Because I need to know.

967
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:23,570
Please tell me what exactly he did that 
you need to export him to the United 

968
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:23,570
States.
Oh,

969
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:27,960
he released some information,
which is our information to citizens 

970
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,360
that this is not,
you know,

971
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:33,480
information that should be kept secret 
from a king.

972
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,490
It's,
it's,

973
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:39,510
it's information that someone who was 
being paid with tax payer dollars.

974
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:42,690
I did a bunch of shit that the United 
States doesn't agree with.

975
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,960
Everyone was upset by the information 
that was released.

976
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,290
Everyone was upset by that video,
that collateral murder video.

977
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Everyone was obsessed by this massive 
amount of data that showed there was a 

978
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:55,740
lot of coercion,
a lot of lies.

979
00:46:55,741 --> 00:47:00,741
A lot,
a lot of stuff that we don't agree with 

980
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:02,690
and because of that,
this guy is like public enemy number 

981
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:02,690
one.
Yeah,

982
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:06,080
that's,
that's so anti what we think of as the 

983
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,280
United States.
Completely contrary to everything in the

984
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,790
United States stands for complainant on 
that.

985
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:12,360
And so in answer to your question,
I would say yes,

986
00:47:12,361 --> 00:47:17,361
it is some kind of weird dictatorship 
posturing and posing as a,

987
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,350
as a democracy,
because for,

988
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,440
for democracy to be real,
you have to have complete openness of 

989
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,350
information.
People must be told the truth,

990
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,160
then they can vote and make decisions on
the basis of facts.

991
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:30,100
What we actually

992
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:35,100
have in our society is the continual,
very clever massaging and management of 

993
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,090
information,
uh,

994
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:40,420
this so,
so it ceases to be democracy.

995
00:47:40,421 --> 00:47:43,000
When the voting,
when the voting public are fed,

996
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,790
lies on the basis of which they make 
their decisions and vote that,

997
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:52,910
that isn't democracy anymore.
That is in a way democracies are the 

998
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:55,630
worst kind of dictatorship because they 
have this appearance of freedom.

999
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:59,110
They have this illusion of freedom.
And everybody can say,

1000
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:00,470
well,
it's great because I live in a,

1001
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,980
in a democracy,
at least if you live in a dictatorship,

1002
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:07,981
you know you live in a dictatorship and 
there are certain parameters that you 

1003
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:09,940
have to work your way around.
But when you live in a dictatorship that

1004
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:14,941
is posing as a democracy,
it's more complicated and there were a 

1005
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:19,060
lot of people truly believe and act as 
if it is a democracy.

1006
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:24,090
But at the very top there's fuckery and 
manipulation and coercion and money and 

1007
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:30,570
corporate greed and interests and the 
military industrial complex that it's 

1008
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:34,651
funding all of these maneuvers and it's 
people profiting wildly and not to 

1009
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,940
forget all the big corporations,
big,

1010
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:41,970
big pharmaceutical corporations.
All of this about management of 

1011
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:42,700
management of information that we,
that we are given.

1012
00:48:42,701 --> 00:48:46,360
So what the Internet offers is the 
opportunity for,

1013
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,420
for ordinary people who are not part of 
the power structure and not running a 

1014
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,930
big corporation to take power back to 
themselves.

1015
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:57,931
And that is,
that is happening and it's happening in 

1016
00:48:57,931 --> 00:49:00,721
a big way.
And it's very disturbing to the powers 

1017
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:00,721
that be.
Yeah,

1018
00:49:00,721 --> 00:49:02,560
people want like an instant change.
But it is almost instant the,

1019
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:03,110
the,
the,

1020
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,250
the amount of time that we've actually 
spent having the Internet has been 

1021
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:12,721
pretty brief.
Nineteen 93 ish forest is when I gave 

1022
00:49:12,721 --> 00:49:15,580
birth yesterday and then like 2014 where
we're at now.

1023
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,240
It's really only been around in this 
forum for the last decade,

1024
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:24,270
like 2004,
2005 and then social media allowing 

1025
00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:26,950
people to exchange information and the 
heat of political crisis.

1026
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:32,240
And they were,
they've been able to expose things that 

1027
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:35,701
are happening in real time that 
ordinarily would be protected by the 

1028
00:49:35,701 --> 00:49:39,481
media.
They would shelter and filter the 

1029
00:49:39,481 --> 00:49:42,001
information.
Now it's all just coming out and they 

1030
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:44,311
can't.
So they have to shut down the whole 

1031
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:44,311
fucking internet and some of these 
countries which,

1032
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:44,680
which uh,
which is a very difficult,

1033
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,900
very difficult thing to do.
Now I've seen the huge shift in power 

1034
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:50,620
that this has.
This has introduced.

1035
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,590
There was a time as a,
as just my own,

1036
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:58,620
my own small level as an author where I 
would have depended on the goodwill of 

1037
00:49:58,931 --> 00:50:02,380
the big media in order to get my ideas 
out there.

1038
00:50:02,381 --> 00:50:07,381
And since my ideas of sometimes being 
radical and contradictory to the 

1039
00:50:07,381 --> 00:50:09,190
established order of things,
it was very difficult to do that.

1040
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,320
Well,
I don't need the big media anymore.

1041
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,370
Right?
Absolutely.

1042
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:14,680
Don't need them.
They're not required at all.

1043
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:16,390
They're redundant as far as I'm 
concerned.

1044
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,290
What does.
What is?

1045
00:50:17,291 --> 00:50:21,400
What is important is the community of 
likeminded people that I am.

1046
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:24,850
I am reaching through social social 
media through facebook,

1047
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:25,960
through my,
through my website.

1048
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:30,961
Not to say that facebook perfect because
facebook is very problematic and is 

1049
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,620
itself a large corporation which is 
filtering and controlling inflammation,

1050
00:50:33,621 --> 00:50:35,210
but at least it's there.
It's something.

1051
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,010
There's some excellent things with 
facebook though.

1052
00:50:37,011 --> 00:50:40,250
One of the excellent things that 
everyone is themselves like that is your

1053
00:50:40,251 --> 00:50:42,080
facebook account.
This is when you're posting,

1054
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,180
this is who you are.
For the most part.

1055
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:45,500
I mean obviously there's some frauds out
there.

1056
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:46,640
Sure.
There are a lot of.

1057
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:51,641
When people are commenting,
they're commenting using their facebook 

1058
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:51,641
indeed identity.
Yeah.

1059
00:50:51,641 --> 00:50:56,290
So like that's a real person as opposed 
to twitter or a lot of message boards 

1060
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,791
where you getting trolls and lot of 
assholes that are posting under fake 

1061
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,851
names and they just,
there's a lot of people out there that 

1062
00:51:03,851 --> 00:51:04,220
it's like a sport to them to like to be 
Shittier,

1063
00:51:04,221 --> 00:51:05,210
to rile people up.

1064
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,460
Like that always puzzles me that I kind,
I come across,

1065
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:09,740
I get relatively little of it on my 
facebook pages.

1066
00:51:09,741 --> 00:51:12,050
I have an author facebook page,
I have a personal facebook page.

1067
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:14,450
I run them both parallel at the same 
stuff in both of them.

1068
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,720
There's one or two people who kind of 
haunt me there and just always want to 

1069
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,411
say,
just always want to say negative and 

1070
00:51:23,411 --> 00:51:23,630
unpleasant things.
And my view is go for it guy.

1071
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:25,310
You know,
say those things if you want to,

1072
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,980
but you're always going to get that if 
you are in the public eye.

1073
00:51:28,070 --> 00:51:33,070
And the thing to be aware of is that 
it's a tremendous waste of it.

1074
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:38,171
Unless you're actually doing something 
evil and someone's trying to expose 

1075
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:38,171
something which you're clearly not.
But if you were,

1076
00:51:38,171 --> 00:51:40,460
then that kind of makes sense,
like these people are crusaders,

1077
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,650
but it,
a lot of them are just what,

1078
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,840
what you call haters in the United 
States.

1079
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,440
And the thing about haters is they're 
all losers.

1080
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:50,930
Yes.
There's no one that lives a fulfilled,

1081
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:54,350
successful life with an awesome family,
a great relationship.

1082
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:56,360
They're doing what they want to do for a
living.

1083
00:51:56,361 --> 00:52:01,361
They're happy and at peace.
And they also go online and a very 

1084
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:02,660
hateful things and shit on people.
You know,

1085
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,020
they,
they're,

1086
00:52:03,021 --> 00:52:03,500
they're,
they're,

1087
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,400
it's a mess of wasted energy.
Yeah.

1088
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:07,650
Like they're,
you know,

1089
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,490
and some people are really good at it 
and it's like damn,

1090
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,640
if you put that energy into something 
productive instead of stocking Graham 

1091
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,800
Hancock and fucking with them all day,
you could get a lot of shit done.

1092
00:52:18,801 --> 00:52:20,330
You exactly.
Probably be a happier person.

1093
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,360
Exactly.
So the only answer at the receiving end 

1094
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:25,360
of that is not to feed it.
Yeah.

1095
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,890
No,
it's not to nourish it with angry or,

1096
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:31,250
or hurting or her responses.
Well,

1097
00:52:31,251 --> 00:52:32,150
that's what they're trying to do.

1098
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,850
Someone searches shit,
you're fucking books.

1099
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,060
I wipe my ass with your book trying to 
fuck with you.

1100
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,060
Absolutely.
The answer is the answer is some.

1101
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,010
Somehow what I try to do sometimes is to
just respond with love,

1102
00:52:46,011 --> 00:52:48,260
you know,
just as it's nice if it's true,

1103
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,720
if it's real and I tried to do the same 
if I can.

1104
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,420
Um,
sometimes it's really hard.

1105
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,830
It's hard,
but you do also agree.

1106
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:57,500
I,
I definitely feel this about myself,

1107
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:02,530
that some of the,
some of the criticism that I've 

1108
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,920
received,
even a extreme criticism,

1109
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,960
even if it's unbalanced,
I've benefited from.

1110
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,390
Oh,
is yes.

1111
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:09,320
Useful?
Yes.

1112
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,280
It's useful.
The,

1113
00:53:10,281 --> 00:53:10,590
the,
the,

1114
00:53:10,591 --> 00:53:12,350
there's,
there's something to learn from that.

1115
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:13,370
It's not that that was saying,
you know,

1116
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,960
what doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger.

1117
00:53:14,961 --> 00:53:15,720
I mean,
you have to let,

1118
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,450
you have to learn from this.
It's out there.

1119
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:21,710
We have to engage in some,
in some way with criticism.

1120
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,370
I've received an enormous amount of 
criticism from,

1121
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:29,420
from my work and for the suggestion that
was a lost civilization and the work 

1122
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:30,660
that I've done on psychedelics and 
altered states of consciousness.

1123
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:31,920
Just endless.
It's not,

1124
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:34,440
it's nonstop.
And My,

1125
00:53:34,470 --> 00:53:35,670
my view is,
thank you,

1126
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,280
thank you for criticizing me.
I appreciate it.

1127
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:44,210
If there are holes in what I'm saying,
if my argument is weak in a particular 

1128
00:53:44,210 --> 00:53:46,870
area and you're helping me to see that 
the right response is gratitude to them,

1129
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:52,290
they really are in a sense working for 
you in some way because I mean there's 

1130
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,450
spin unwarranted criticism that you've 
received that have made me rethink a lot

1131
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,370
of things I do.
Even if it's unwarranted,

1132
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:01,540
they've made me rethink like what is 
the,

1133
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,960
what is causing this reaction?
Like what's.

1134
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,200
Is there anything that I could have done
differently that could have avoided 

1135
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:09,200
that?

1136
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,220
Or is this an necessary evil that just 
comes with the business and it makes you

1137
00:54:14,550 --> 00:54:16,080
think about things in a more complex 
way.

1138
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:18,270
And although that might be 
uncomfortable,

1139
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,100
I think there's some great benefit of 
it.

1140
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,500
There's some great benefits from it.
And once again it's putting us,

1141
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,380
it's putting us into a real social 
social situation.

1142
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:26,790
As you say,
these people are real,

1143
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,040
you know,
it's like being back in the village in 

1144
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,451
the old days where where you might be 
directly criticized by one or other of 

1145
00:54:35,451 --> 00:54:36,900
your fellow villages.
Well now our villages,

1146
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:41,901
the whole world and it crosses all 
national boundaries and all religious 

1147
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:43,760
interest.
It's.

1148
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:48,010
It can be anybody anywhere who who's 
taking an interest in us and I'm.

1149
00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:52,380
I'm constantly receiving information,
some of it critical,

1150
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:56,130
some of it positive through facebook in 
particular through facebook,

1151
00:54:56,131 --> 00:55:01,131
which is,
which is very helpful to me and I 

1152
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:01,131
really.

1153
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:01,131
I really appreciate it and I tried the 
best I can.

1154
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:03,030
I try as much as I can do.
It would be.

1155
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,550
I don't,
I don't want to spend my entire day,

1156
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,600
morning to night on facebook,
but I try to engage with that.

1157
00:55:09,601 --> 00:55:13,050
I try to respond because I realized that
people are giving me that time.

1158
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:16,200
Somebody sends me a link to a story I 
haven't ever seen before.

1159
00:55:16,201 --> 00:55:18,330
It's really important for my research.
Thank you.

1160
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:20,700
That's really great.
Twitter's giant for that for me.

1161
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:25,770
Just absolutely gigantic.
I've gotten more information from 

1162
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:28,911
twitter,
more interesting websites that people 

1163
00:55:28,911 --> 00:55:31,881
have sent me to,
more interesting articles that people 

1164
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:34,021
have sent me to.
Then any other resources that I've ever 

1165
00:55:34,021 --> 00:55:36,710
been in contact with and it's just 
directly because of interacting with 

1166
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:37,650
people and when they send me interesting
things,

1167
00:55:37,651 --> 00:55:42,651
I retweet them and then you know,
those retweets gets seen by a large 

1168
00:55:42,651 --> 00:55:46,401
number of people so that people see that
I do that and so they send me more 

1169
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:46,401
interesting.

1170
00:55:46,401 --> 00:55:50,510
It's really cool in that way.
I like that it's like a establishing a 

1171
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:54,351
network in that sense.
It's really a whole new situation which 

1172
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,580
we've not faced before,
done on a done on a gigantic scale and 

1173
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:03,241
and what it means is that information 
which used to be strictly controlled and

1174
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:11,091
in the hands of elites is now changing 
the power structure of information is 

1175
00:56:11,091 --> 00:56:16,071
changing entirely and that's a very 
potentially a very exciting new time to 

1176
00:56:16,071 --> 00:56:18,900
live in and great things are coming out 
of it and it's easy to say this,

1177
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:21,840
but I think a new consciousness is 
dawning in the world.

1178
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:24,400
Actually.
I don't think it's very big yet.

1179
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,330
I think the old way of doing things is 
still extremely strong,

1180
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,170
but people are waking up to that power 
and saying,

1181
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:37,500
you know,
I am not simply a to be pushed around 

1182
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:41,521
and told what to do by an expert or a 
government official or a corporation.

1183
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,020
And that's great.
That's great.

1184
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:49,050
I,
I believe you're correct and I think 

1185
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:49,050
that it's hard to see while you're in 
the middle of it.

1186
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:52,090
Yeah,
because it's all happening while we're,

1187
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,470
you know,
we're participating in it.

1188
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,940
We are living in a time of extraordinary
rapid,

1189
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,120
unbelievable change and when the history
of this time maybe things will settle 

1190
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:03,120
down,
maybe they won't,

1191
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:07,651
I don't know,
but when the history of this time comes 

1192
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:07,651
to be written,
they'll have to be some perspective on a

1193
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:08,410
200,
300 years from now.

1194
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,340
It will be seen as one of the most 
extraordinary moments in the whole human

1195
00:57:12,341 --> 00:57:17,341
story.
Mr My friend Amber Lyon has an 

1196
00:57:17,341 --> 00:57:19,651
interesting way of talking about certain
events and one of the things that she 

1197
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:23,941
talks about when it comes to a corporate
control of information and like things 

1198
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:27,010
on the lines of like the Juliana songs 
situation.

1199
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:32,520
She talks about being on the wrong side 
of history and I think that's a very 

1200
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:36,811
good point that they're the people that 
are trying to suppress inflammation in 

1201
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:40,831
that way and the information that would 
directly affect the lives and not just 

1202
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:48,250
but the consciousness of the entire 
culture that that's the wrong side of 

1203
00:57:48,250 --> 00:57:50,290
history and all things are said and 
done.

1204
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:53,080
People trying to act in their best 
interest currently.

1205
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,150
They don't realize like the fucking Jig 
is up,

1206
00:57:55,151 --> 00:58:00,151
man.
You might be able to hang on and keep 

1207
00:58:00,151 --> 00:58:00,151
treading water for another three or four
years,

1208
00:58:00,151 --> 00:58:00,350
but the Jig is up.
Yeah.

1209
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,190
It's like the inquisition was on the 
wrong side of history.

1210
00:58:03,191 --> 00:58:08,191
You know when it made it made Galileo's 
say that actually the sun did revolve 

1211
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:11,200
around the earth even though he knew 
that the earth moved there.

1212
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,780
It's clear that the Galileo was on the 
right side of history.

1213
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:15,430
We know that now we've got perspective 
on it.

1214
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:18,280
We can look back with hindsight and and 
it's the same.

1215
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,950
It's the same thing that's happening 
today in different ways.

1216
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,270
Yeah,
it really is.

1217
00:58:22,271 --> 00:58:25,660
It's just,
it's just more.

1218
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:31,920
It's more intense because it's happening
worldwide and it's all happening at the 

1219
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,270
same time and we're seeing positive and 
negative repercussions of it.

1220
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,660
Like these failed states that come about
because of Arab spring.

1221
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:42,950
Like everybody says,
let's get rid of the dictator and then 

1222
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:42,950
you know,
mark,

1223
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:46,360
Pandora's box is filled and now Libya is
like this and how world hell world.

1224
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:52,290
Syria as a helloworld,
Iraq's a hell world in every case.

1225
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,840
Pandora's box has been,
has been opened and the immediate result

1226
00:58:55,841 --> 00:58:59,410
has been the things got way worse than 
worse than they were before.

1227
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:00,830
And then,
you know,

1228
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,980
if we,
if we're talking about the dark side,

1229
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:04,930
the negative side of things as well,
there is this,

1230
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:10,260
this horrible problem of bigoted 
religious fundamentalism which is,

1231
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:16,060
which is not confined to the Islamic 
world by any means.

1232
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,720
I mean,
there are,

1233
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,780
there are many Christian bigots as well.
There's a tendency for people cling on 

1234
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:27,040
to old and devalued ideas and to have 
her have an almost religious for 

1235
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,930
fanatical commitment to them and be 
willing,

1236
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,760
I mean,
what idea is worth killing another 

1237
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:36,760
fellow human being for because they 
don't share your idea of.

1238
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,940
I mean,
this is demonic.

1239
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,940
It's a horrendous,
horrendous situation that this happened.

1240
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:45,650
I followed a few guys on twitter that 
are a part of that whole Islamic state.

1241
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:50,770
There was an article about this guy who 
was a rapper who is suspected a rapper 

1242
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:56,891
from London suspected of being one of 
the guys that beheaded one of the 

1243
00:59:56,891 --> 00:59:56,960
American journalist.
And um,

1244
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,460
I was following his twitter feed.
It's just like his band,

1245
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,230
his twitter account,
but it was,

1246
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,050
you know,
it was just,

1247
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:07,220
it was so strange to see what's going 
on.

1248
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:12,370
And also strange to see his.
There was this thing that was going on 

1249
01:00:13,190 --> 01:00:16,880
with his interaction with the other,
the other people.

1250
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:21,881
There was this intense camaraderie,
this intense comradery with his other 

1251
01:00:21,881 --> 01:00:22,550
Islamic warriors.
You know,

1252
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:25,430
that they all looked at it.
Everyone was brothers.

1253
01:00:25,431 --> 01:00:27,770
And sisters and everyone was,
you know,

1254
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:32,830
it was all great intensity to all of the
decisions that were being made and great

1255
01:00:33,021 --> 01:00:35,400
intensity to the bonds they all had,
you know,

1256
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:38,630
fighting against what they thought was 
the evil United States.

1257
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:43,250
And unfortunately there was also some 
things that he said that,

1258
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,960
you know,
they were talking about.

1259
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,420
Everybody's freaking out that one head 
got cut off,

1260
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,000
one body part got cut off of this one 
guy.

1261
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:55,150
But what about the thousands of people 
that are blown to bits by these drones 

1262
01:00:55,150 --> 01:00:57,740
that no one's talking about?
And that's undeniable.

1263
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,500
That is undeniable,
that is a,

1264
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:00,740
that is absolutely true.

1265
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,980
Two wrongs never make a right,
so they do not.

1266
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:07,450
The fact that the fight that that 
happens does not excuse the,

1267
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,520
the cold blooded slicing off of fellow 
human beings head.

1268
01:01:10,521 --> 01:01:13,040
But nevertheless it happens.
It should not.

1269
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,100
We should not condemn the one without 
condemning the other as well.

1270
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,780
Absolutely.
And in fact,

1271
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:22,960
the one you know,
you're talking about one individual as 

1272
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,041
opposed to thousands of people that have
been killed by drones that are innocent 

1273
01:01:27,041 --> 01:01:30,660
but completely innocent people who are 
so called collateral damage just ripped 

1274
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:34,250
upon by,
by our high tech weapons,

1275
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:34,790
you know,
which,

1276
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,770
which,
which will be had a person in an,

1277
01:01:36,830 --> 01:01:41,830
in an instance slice buddy parts off,
just completely destroy that if you're 

1278
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:42,860
lucky,
if you're lucky,

1279
01:01:42,861 --> 01:01:47,861
they only break off a few things and 
then you have to suffer for the rest of 

1280
01:01:47,861 --> 01:01:48,620
your life and agonizing pain.
So we have to own this,

1281
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,590
we have to take that,
we have to accept that this is,

1282
01:01:50,591 --> 01:01:51,950
this is something we do.

1283
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,520
We in the West are not innocent of this 
barbarity.

1284
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:58,820
We're also part of it is it we,
you know,

1285
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:03,821
that's the real thing.
Well that's the real thing because then 

1286
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:05,651
you come back to the question of the 
manipulation of public opinion by very 

1287
01:02:05,651 --> 01:02:10,511
small interest groups who have,
who have a very unbalanced a control of 

1288
01:02:11,781 --> 01:02:12,890
inflammation,
right?

1289
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,070
And then who,
what,

1290
01:02:14,071 --> 01:02:15,410
what is,
what is we mean?

1291
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:17,630
If it's not you and it's not.
I mean,

1292
01:02:17,631 --> 01:02:19,980
do we take responsibility for people we 
don't even know,

1293
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,100
doing things that are under the orders 
of people we also don't know and under 

1294
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:29,151
the influence of corporations,
we're not really exactly sure who's 

1295
01:02:29,151 --> 01:02:30,600
pulling the strings or how it's getting 
done or what politicians are moving,

1296
01:02:30,601 --> 01:02:34,230
what pieces into place and the whole 
thing is when we take responsibility for

1297
01:02:34,231 --> 01:02:38,320
standing by and letting bad shit happen 
and not think about it somehow or other,

1298
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,860
it didn't fail to fail to act.

1299
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:44,340
When when we know that something really 
wrong is being done in our name,

1300
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:47,190
that is.
That is as bad as doing it ourselves.

1301
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,450
Have you ever seen the interview?
There's an interview that's out there.

1302
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:54,530
One of the guys that say who was a drone
pilot and he was responsible for don't 

1303
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:59,250
know a large number of deaths,
but he would describe what it was like 

1304
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:01,950
to be a drone pilot and what it's like 
to,

1305
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:07,200
you know,
to to operate these death machines and 

1306
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,940
fly to the sky and just launched rockets
and how crazy it was and this.

1307
01:03:09,941 --> 01:03:13,890
This is a new thing that didn't exist 
decades ago.

1308
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:17,250
Didn't exist during the first Gulf War.
There was no drones.

1309
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:22,650
I mean it's this idea of precision 
attacks by automated machines that fly 

1310
01:03:23,071 --> 01:03:25,680
around the Air Launch Hellfire missiles.
I mean,

1311
01:03:25,681 --> 01:03:28,680
what a fucking crazy name.
Call them hell fire.

1312
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:29,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

1313
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:31,710
And,
and it becomes like a computer game.

1314
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:37,330
Oh No,
you're looking at it on a screen and 

1315
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:37,330
completely detached,
completely,

1316
01:03:37,330 --> 01:03:41,390
completely detached from the Mass Med or
that you are in fact inflicting what a 

1317
01:03:41,761 --> 01:03:44,190
dark world we live in.
We live in a dark.

1318
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:46,850
We live in a dark time and the only,
you know,

1319
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:50,640
the only thing is that there is this 
light which is growing.

1320
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:55,670
There is,
there is the capacity for love human 

1321
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:55,670
beings.
We are,

1322
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,700
we are capable of love it.
It involves detaching ourselves from 

1323
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:03,180
controlling orders and actually thinking
as human beings thinking for ourselves.

1324
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:04,590
Very difficult to do.
But it is.

1325
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:07,740
I think it's happening.
I also think that that conflict,

1326
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:12,580
the conflict of battling against the 
negative builds up the positive.

1327
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,430
Some strange way.
I mean the,

1328
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,750
the antiwar movement was really a big 
part of what made the hippie movement of

1329
01:04:18,751 --> 01:04:23,751
the sixties.
Like that was a lot of it was in 

1330
01:04:23,751 --> 01:04:26,181
response to the Vietnam War,
this war that people knew to be unjust 

1331
01:04:26,181 --> 01:04:28,500
and so this flower power,
love,

1332
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:33,530
power movement,
Lsd and marijuana and all that came out 

1333
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:33,530
of that.

1334
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:38,450
That very resistance to killing people 
that didn't do anything bad to us,

1335
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,250
produce this very positive thing,
but then of course that was a then a 

1336
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:44,250
counter reaction to them,
which we call the war on drugs,

1337
01:04:44,610 --> 01:04:47,940
which slapped down on that and shut it.
Shut it all down again.

1338
01:04:48,270 --> 01:04:53,270
I mean,
I know you're not big into supernatural 

1339
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:54,750
issues,
but when I look at all of this,

1340
01:04:54,751 --> 01:04:59,670
I have to say the gnostics who you know 
too.

1341
01:04:59,671 --> 01:05:03,000
If I simplify the.
The idea gnostic ideas,

1342
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:08,030
the knowledge we know about gnostic 
ideas because a batch of texts were 

1343
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,460
found buried at a place called not 
commodity and Upper Egypt in the air.

1344
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:13,740
The temple of Dendur in Upper Egypt and 
they'd been married for 1000,

1345
01:05:13,741 --> 01:05:18,741
600 years and they were founded in 1945 
and they can contain a complete corpus 

1346
01:05:19,721 --> 01:05:24,721
of ideas of people who call themselves 
the gnostics and they see a dark force 

1347
01:05:26,591 --> 01:05:31,591
at work in the universe which is which 
is seeking to snuff out the divine spark

1348
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:37,590
in humanity and it's a supernatural 
force and what they say is that the 

1349
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:42,391
entity who we've been taught for the 
last 2000 plus years to believe is God.

1350
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:48,750
Doesn't the entered the Abraham,
the god of Abraham who may be called 

1351
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:52,861
Yahweh or who may be called Allah,
that that from the gnostic point of 

1352
01:05:52,861 --> 01:05:53,110
view,
that's not a god at all.

1353
01:05:53,111 --> 01:05:54,400
That's a.
that's a demon.

1354
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:59,700
That's a lower level supernatural who's 
got this huge inflated ego who wants to 

1355
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:05,791
be praised and worshiped,
who's constantly urging his followers 

1356
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,960
onto acts of violence and war.
And I think it's.

1357
01:06:07,961 --> 01:06:08,470
I,
I,

1358
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:11,140
we cannot say there are any facts in 
this area.

1359
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:16,150
Maybe it's just the dark side of the 
human psyche and maybe it's all 

1360
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:18,220
generated by our brains or maybe there 
is a supernatural realm,

1361
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:19,920
but I think it's.
I think it's A.

1362
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:24,910
I think gnosticism is a very useful tool
to look at.

1363
01:06:24,911 --> 01:06:29,911
The society we live in today,
they believed that there were entities 

1364
01:06:29,911 --> 01:06:33,211
called Arkansans who are evil angels who
disguise themselves as human beings and 

1365
01:06:33,211 --> 01:06:37,801
mingle with us to drive us into all 
manner of crimes and behavior that is 

1366
01:06:38,141 --> 01:06:41,320
hostile to the nature of the soul and 
that's what I see happening everywhere,

1367
01:06:41,321 --> 01:06:46,321
but they believed fundamentally we are 
good and that we have this light within 

1368
01:06:46,321 --> 01:06:48,520
us and that that the way to reveal that 
light is through.

1369
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:53,900
It's through knowledge.
That's why the serpent in the garden of 

1370
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,130
Eden is the good guy in the gnostic 
frame of reference.

1371
01:06:54,340 --> 01:06:56,680
That's very bizarre.
The serpent being a good guy.

1372
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:58,750
He's the good guy because he's saying to
Adam and eve,

1373
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:02,260
you have to know the difference between 
good and evil.

1374
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:07,650
You can't just be these thoughtless meet
creatures you know who are wandering 

1375
01:07:08,021 --> 01:07:12,310
around in a happy days in the garden.
If you're going to grow and develop,

1376
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:17,311
you have to make choices between good 
and evil and it's the tree of knowledge 

1377
01:07:17,311 --> 01:07:20,821
of good and evil that the serpent 
introduces Adam and Eve to and says you 

1378
01:07:20,981 --> 01:07:22,170
need to eat from that.
And,

1379
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:22,720
and,
and,

1380
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,140
and,
and actually I,

1381
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,680
I would say this is true.
You do need to.

1382
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:31,700
We are defined by our choices.
It's through our choices that we grow 

1383
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:32,920
and if we're ignorant of the context,
how can we help to grow?

1384
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:33,700
Yeah.
And this,

1385
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:38,950
I mean,
the stories of like Adam and eve and 

1386
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:38,950
the,
I mean,

1387
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:38,950
all that stuff.
It's,

1388
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:39,250
it's allegorical,
right?

1389
01:07:39,251 --> 01:07:40,500
I mean,
it's supposed to be there.

1390
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:45,600
There's,
there's an allegory to certainly an 

1391
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:45,600
allegory.
There's.

1392
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,170
So there's certainly an,
an allegory that's real serpent,

1393
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,380
you know,
I don't read it as a real,

1394
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,440
a real apple.
I mean actually for the Gnostics,

1395
01:07:53,450 --> 01:07:58,450
it very clearly and definitely it was a 
psychedelic mushroom when the gnostics 

1396
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:00,470
portray the tree of life and the God 
that.

1397
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:05,570
Sorry,
the tree of knowledge of good and evil 

1398
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:05,570
in the garden.
It is,

1399
01:08:05,570 --> 01:08:05,610
I'm an eater Mascaro.
It's the flag agric.

1400
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:06,430
It is,
it is.

1401
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:11,431
Sometimes there's a Psilocybin,
it is a visionary substance,

1402
01:08:11,831 --> 01:08:16,010
which they were say depicting that in a 
way from the gnostic point of view

1403
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:20,150
is a necessary part of the liberation of
the spirit that we.

1404
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:20,630
That it.
It's,

1405
01:08:20,660 --> 01:08:24,300
it's an an agent for awakening.
That's what the serpent was giving.

1406
01:08:24,301 --> 01:08:29,301
Now I know that all the fundamentalist 
Christians out there are going to say 

1407
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:30,020
hancock is a devil worshiper because 
he's saying that the serpent is the good

1408
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:35,021
guy,
but that's what the gnostics said and 

1409
01:08:35,021 --> 01:08:37,391
there was a deep and ancient study of 
the mystery of life and the mystery of 

1410
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:37,391
reality.

1411
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:38,370
I've read somewhere,
I don't remember the source,

1412
01:08:38,371 --> 01:08:43,371
but I read somewhere where they were 
talking about the interpretations of 

1413
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:46,500
ancient languages and the translations 
from ancient Hebrew,

1414
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:48,840
Aramaic,
all to Greek Latin.

1415
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:53,580
That a lot of things got lost along the 
way in the confusion and that one of the

1416
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,640
confusions was that the word apple could
could be interpreted also as red and 

1417
01:09:01,621 --> 01:09:05,610
then it wasn't an apple,
but that it was a red and that red being

1418
01:09:05,611 --> 01:09:08,400
the color of the and area that that was.
Why?

1419
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:13,460
Absolutely.
I mean there's folks have to understand 

1420
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,490
if they,
they've never tried to pay attention to 

1421
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:19,641
how people translate ancient languages 
and then try to translate them several 

1422
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:21,570
times,
not just into,

1423
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,730
you know,
from ancient Hebrew to Latin,

1424
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:27,010
but also from Latin degree,
from Greek to English.

1425
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:29,970
There's so much that gets weirded out 
along the way.

1426
01:09:29,971 --> 01:09:33,720
Like if you've ever taken a phrase from 
like a Russian,

1427
01:09:34,020 --> 01:09:37,680
a website where you don't know what 
they're saying and then put it into like

1428
01:09:37,681 --> 01:09:40,340
Google translate and you see the English
version of what they're saying.

1429
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,740
Oh my God.
It's so convoluted and confusing because

1430
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:46,350
of the way the structure of their 
language is very different.

1431
01:09:46,351 --> 01:09:51,351
The grammar that they use is very 
different and that it's nothing in 

1432
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:52,550
comparison to how different it was in 
ancient time.

1433
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:57,620
Yeah.
A lot get lost in translation and the 

1434
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,340
translator imposes his or her idea of 
how things should.

1435
01:09:59,370 --> 01:10:04,370
Of course on the,
on the material and many of the texts 

1436
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:06,030
that come down to us are highly edited 
artifacts which are,

1437
01:10:06,031 --> 01:10:08,370
which are actually representing a 
particular point of view.

1438
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:13,371
That's why these hidden gnostic texts,
which just lay buried for 1600 years 

1439
01:10:13,371 --> 01:10:16,980
until they were found in the 19 forties,
are extremely,

1440
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:18,120
extremely interesting.
And,

1441
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:21,220
and actually we don't need to rely on 
translations there.

1442
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:26,221
They're worse.
Most of the gnostics were wiped out by 

1443
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:29,961
Christianity when Christianity pooled on
the Jackboot of Rome and became the 

1444
01:10:30,481 --> 01:10:35,481
state religion of the most powerful,
militaristic empire of the ancient 

1445
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:35,481
world.
Uh,

1446
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:39,800
it's set about destroying all 
competitors and amongst those that 

1447
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,161
destroyed were the Gnostics,
but certainly they were burnt at the 

1448
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:45,510
stake from a very early date,
but some gnostic sects survived and they

1449
01:10:45,511 --> 01:10:50,511
have left us images and there are a 
number of gnostic churches these guys 

1450
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:54,111
saw themselves as Christians.
There are a number of gnostic churches 

1451
01:10:54,111 --> 01:10:55,440
where they painted the tree of knowledge
of good and evil,

1452
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:57,660
quite specifically as I'm one to 
Mascaro.

1453
01:10:57,661 --> 01:10:57,800
Yeah.

1454
01:10:58,230 --> 01:10:59,150
Yeah.
And,

1455
01:10:59,151 --> 01:11:01,490
um,
even in French frescoes,

1456
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:03,220
what does that fresco from like,
uh,

1457
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:07,280
it was,
I don't remember the year,

1458
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:12,670
but it was an Adam and eve portrayal 
that showed several different types of 

1459
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:13,190
types of mushrooms.
I know that.

1460
01:11:14,190 --> 01:11:16,950
And it's Adam and eve clearly standing.
Absolutely.

1461
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:20,880
And it makes you wonder like,
this was in not modern times,

1462
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:22,900
but not 5,000
years ago.

1463
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:24,480
This was like 1200,
eight days,

1464
01:11:24,481 --> 01:11:26,570
just like say 800 years ago,
something,

1465
01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:31,670
something like that.
We were at the tail end of the last 

1466
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:33,830
surviving Gnostics,
the cathars in the southwest of France,

1467
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,520
or an example of a,
of a gnostic,

1468
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:40,780
a sect who survived through until the 
Catholic church wipe them out with the 

1469
01:11:41,191 --> 01:11:46,191
so called Albert Jensen Crusades,
a truly horrendous act of ethnic murder 

1470
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:51,530
that took place in the 12 hundreds.
So we're actually not that long ago and 

1471
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:53,820
things have,
have survived from that time.

1472
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,030
And uh,
it's very interesting that,

1473
01:11:57,150 --> 01:12:02,150
that they are clearly indicating that 
the psychedelic experience is of crucial

1474
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:08,271
importance.
That it's a liberating experience that 

1475
01:12:08,271 --> 01:12:09,060
allows us to wake up to the true nature 
of things.

1476
01:12:09,061 --> 01:12:09,510
Now,
of course,

1477
01:12:09,511 --> 01:12:10,440
they would do it right.

1478
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:14,670
They would do it in a sacred context.
They would work very hard on the setting

1479
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:19,500
to create the place and the space where 
this experience unfolded.

1480
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:22,500
Because that's part of the experience.
The substance on its own is only part of

1481
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:27,501
the story is anybody who's worked with 
psychedelics knows the context in which 

1482
01:12:27,501 --> 01:12:31,551
the experience unfolds is at least as 
important and the intent with which you 

1483
01:12:31,551 --> 01:12:33,540
go into it and what we're seeing now,
again,

1484
01:12:33,541 --> 01:12:38,040
history has been obscured from us,
but recent research is showing,

1485
01:12:38,041 --> 01:12:43,041
for example,
the famous Eleusinian mysteries in 

1486
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,320
Greece 2000 years at the temple of 
abuses.

1487
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:50,000
It pilgrims came from all over Greece 
once a year to undergo and experience 

1488
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,300
and that experience involve drinking a 
brew.

1489
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:55,830
We can now say with absolute certainty 
that that was a brew closely.

1490
01:12:55,950 --> 01:13:00,090
There were elements in it closely 
related to Lsd and that this,

1491
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:02,820
do we know that with absolute,
because the work has been,

1492
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:06,780
the work has been done by Hoffman,
by Gordon Wasson and others.

1493
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:07,790
Um,
there's a,

1494
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:11,290
there's a very detailed study of what 
was in that brew.

1495
01:13:11,291 --> 01:13:16,291
It was called the Chi on and growing on 
the barley that was used in the brew 

1496
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:16,970
was,
it was an Erg,

1497
01:13:16,990 --> 01:13:20,920
got a,
a form of got a which contained Lsd,

1498
01:13:20,921 --> 01:13:23,100
a Mites,
and which was soluble in water.

1499
01:13:23,101 --> 01:13:28,101
They've really done the science and 
great in great depth and when you read 

1500
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:31,761
the accounts,
you know of of great figures from the 

1501
01:13:31,761 --> 01:13:34,161
ancient world,
people like plato or socrates who went 

1502
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:34,161
and had the experience at the earliest 
one,

1503
01:13:34,161 --> 01:13:35,460
mysteries,
they drink this.

1504
01:13:35,461 --> 01:13:40,461
They enter a darkened series of 
corridors and passageways and chambers 

1505
01:13:40,461 --> 01:13:43,911
in this huge,
this huge template and this is light 

1506
01:13:43,911 --> 01:13:45,750
appears and they start seeing visions.
It's pretty obvious what's going on.

1507
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:51,110
Yeah,
pretty obvious that they were tripping 

1508
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,110
in some way,
shape or form,

1509
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:52,410
and they saw it as nurturing.
They saw it as nurturing.

1510
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:56,490
They felt that there were several of the
ancients who had this experience and who

1511
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,320
said that after having had this 
experience,

1512
01:13:58,321 --> 01:14:00,510
they lost their fear of death,
that they.

1513
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:03,750
That they understood that it was not,
that it was not the end.

1514
01:14:03,751 --> 01:14:06,450
Now we could argue about that,
but that was the experience that they.

1515
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:07,470
That they had.
Yeah.

1516
01:14:07,471 --> 01:14:12,471
That's the experience that a lot of 
people have when they take asset of the 

1517
01:14:12,471 --> 01:14:12,471
things that Larry Hagman

1518
01:14:12,471 --> 01:14:15,430
said,
who is popular American actor.

1519
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:19,600
He did this interview when he was on CNN
and they were talking to him about death

1520
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,840
and he said that lsd completely took 
away his fear of death and he just 

1521
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:27,580
didn't.
It didn't mean what it meant before.

1522
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:30,040
Just because you realize you're part of 
something,

1523
01:14:30,820 --> 01:14:34,550
be part of something that's the,
you know,

1524
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:39,670
it is important to have a sense of self 
because it's important to brush your 

1525
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:43,681
teeth.
It's important to pay attention when 

1526
01:14:43,681 --> 01:14:46,261
you're driving.
It's important to take care of your 

1527
01:14:46,261 --> 01:14:47,230
health while you're alive or you'll 
suffer some ill consequences,

1528
01:14:47,231 --> 01:14:52,231
but it's also important to recognize 
that a lot of your need to take care of 

1529
01:14:52,231 --> 01:14:55,330
yourself can be,
can overwhelm your greater perspective.

1530
01:14:55,540 --> 01:15:00,540
The greater perspective of being a part 
of everything in that it's not just 

1531
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:05,461
about you and the worst cases of of 
human beings are the ego's run a muck 

1532
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:11,580
like the dictator,
like Saddam Hussein or the anyone who 

1533
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,220
control.
It's all of them.

1534
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:15,250
It's all about them and you know,
huge insane,

1535
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:20,940
and they cut people down and smash and 
destroy and kill and leave horrible,

1536
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:28,111
horrible lives in the wake of their 
ridiculous detachment.

1537
01:15:28,601 --> 01:15:33,580
From these universal ideas that we are a
part of a giant collective consciousness

1538
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:39,060
and that's,
it's almost impossible to get to that 

1539
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:40,240
without something,
whether it's yoga,

1540
01:15:40,390 --> 01:15:45,390
whether it's Dmt,
whether it's something that you ingest 

1541
01:15:45,390 --> 01:15:49,110
that gets you to that understanding that
that understanding is very difficult to 

1542
01:15:49,110 --> 01:15:53,311
realize with our normal conditioning 
than their normal alpha male primate 

1543
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:55,140
behavior.
That

1544
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,680
the problem solving state of 
consciousness,

1545
01:15:57,681 --> 01:16:02,681
that's that state of consciousness is 
not our friend when it comes to 

1546
01:16:02,681 --> 01:16:04,880
understanding our place in the wider 
scheme of things.

1547
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:09,650
It is a friend in many ways and it's a 
good state of consciousness.

1548
01:16:09,651 --> 01:16:12,140
But there are so many other states of 
consciousness that are,

1549
01:16:12,380 --> 01:16:14,210
that are a volume and the need to be so 
tough.

1550
01:16:14,211 --> 01:16:16,250
Now,
some people are very lucky and they can,

1551
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:19,410
they can get into deeply altered states 
of consciousness and,

1552
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:22,360
and see reality in a different way,
uh,

1553
01:16:22,361 --> 01:16:25,610
without needing to take any substance.
It's fine,

1554
01:16:25,611 --> 01:16:28,430
you know,
or they can get there through meditation

1555
01:16:28,431 --> 01:16:31,670
or they can get there through floating 
in a flotation tank.

1556
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,110
But,
but for a lot of people,

1557
01:16:33,111 --> 01:16:38,111
a very powerful vehicle for changing our
perspective on the nature of reality has

1558
01:16:40,161 --> 01:16:45,161
been for thousands of years the 
psychedelic experience and it's time 

1559
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:45,161
that we rehabilitated that and,
and,

1560
01:16:45,161 --> 01:16:46,640
and gave it a place in our society.

1561
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:51,790
Well,
I think as you were talking about 

1562
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:51,790
earlier that this is a time of great 
change.

1563
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,060
I think this is a time of great 
awakening when it comes to psychedelics.

1564
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:55,730
I was listening to this Guy Sturgill 
Simpson.

1565
01:16:56,220 --> 01:17:01,220
I tweeted it today.
He's just a country music singer who 

1566
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:02,330
sings about dmt.
Oh really?

1567
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:04,730
I hadn't come across some men as country
music,

1568
01:17:04,731 --> 01:17:09,731
like old school,
Waylon Jennings style country music if 

1569
01:17:09,731 --> 01:17:09,731
you're into that.
And I am.

1570
01:17:09,731 --> 01:17:13,331
I liked that kind of music.
I've been really into that of the last 

1571
01:17:13,331 --> 01:17:13,490
couple of years I've gotten.
And I've always been a Johnny Cash fan.

1572
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:16,700
I've always liked dwight yoakam and some
country singers,

1573
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:18,740
but I've gotten into a bunch of other 
stuff recently.

1574
01:17:18,741 --> 01:17:23,741
But this guy sturgill simpson is like a 
big part of what he's saying about 

1575
01:17:23,741 --> 01:17:26,510
psychedelics and in a country song,
I mean,

1576
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:28,020
incredible stuff.
Yeah.

1577
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:33,310
And I think that that to me just sort of
highlights that this is spreading 

1578
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,320
through a bunch of different genres,
different art forms.

1579
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:40,310
You see a lot of psychedelic art now,
not just Alex Gray who's the master,

1580
01:17:40,311 --> 01:17:43,130
but you see others that are coming 
along,

1581
01:17:43,131 --> 01:17:44,960
a lot of psychedelic art work.

1582
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,060
I see it all the time when I go and 
speak at events,

1583
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:52,061
at conferences,
people come to me with their aunt and 

1584
01:17:52,061 --> 01:17:54,101
I'm seeing.
I'm seeing this trip to huge explosion 

1585
01:17:54,101 --> 01:17:55,070
of,
of a visionary creativity,

1586
01:17:55,340 --> 01:17:56,090
uh,
taking,

1587
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:01,120
taking place.
And I'm constantly meeting people whose 

1588
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:01,120
lives have been transformed,
uh,

1589
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:03,470
by,
by these experiences.

1590
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:08,610
And I think a lot of people are getting 
informed by guys like you who have 

1591
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:13,411
written books on these experiences from 
supernatural to your own discussions,

1592
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,540
including the one that got banned from 
Ted,

1593
01:18:16,570 --> 01:18:21,570
Ted,
ted thing has kind of been exposed as 

1594
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:25,231
being this really bizarre,
almost cultish thing that it's done a 

1595
01:18:25,231 --> 01:18:25,231
lot of.
Great.

1596
01:18:25,231 --> 01:18:29,461
Good.
I'm a big fan of a lot of the speakers 

1597
01:18:29,461 --> 01:18:33,900
that have come on Ted,
but I had Eddie Wong on the show where 

1598
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:37,501
he talked about his experience and Ted 
where they kicked him out because he 

1599
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:40,261
left there to do my podcast.
They wanted them to be a part of this 

1600
01:18:40,261 --> 01:18:40,660
whole thing all day where you didn't 
hang out.

1601
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:44,020
He had to stay in a hotel room with 
someone else like they made him.

1602
01:18:44,021 --> 01:18:49,021
He's like,
can I get my own hotel room that know 

1603
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,911
the Ted Experience?
You have to shack up with some fucking 

1604
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:51,460
random dude who's talking about physics 
or whatever it is.

1605
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,750
We want everybody to be together.
It's very difficult.

1606
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,380
Scientology,
well,

1607
01:18:56,381 --> 01:19:01,381
it's also become intensely profitable 
and when things become intensely 

1608
01:19:01,381 --> 01:19:02,530
profitable and they come to this giant 
business,

1609
01:19:02,531 --> 01:19:07,531
that's.
That's part of why your talk got banned 

1610
01:19:07,531 --> 01:19:11,071
from Ted.
Instead of having an open discourse 

1611
01:19:11,071 --> 01:19:12,400
about agreeing or disagreeing about what
you're saying.

1612
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,640
There's nothing wrong with that,
but your ted talk got banned because of 

1613
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,901
pressure from a bunch of people there 
were saying that you start using the 

1614
01:19:21,901 --> 01:19:23,750
word pseudoscience.
Pseudoscience stop the pseudo science.

1615
01:19:23,751 --> 01:19:26,920
Yeah.
There's almost a cult of people that are

1616
01:19:26,921 --> 01:19:31,921
afraid of debating ideas that are very 
controversial and very difficult to nail

1617
01:19:32,171 --> 01:19:33,760
down,
especially when you're talking about the

1618
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:37,630
emergence of consciousness in early man.
Okay.

1619
01:19:37,780 --> 01:19:42,780
No one knows how the fuck people got 
from hunting things to drawing on cave 

1620
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:47,290
walls to experiencing visionary,
a psychedelic states.

1621
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:48,760
But we do know that happened.

1622
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:50,110
It happened.
It happened,

1623
01:19:50,111 --> 01:19:51,870
and it's worth talking about it.
Yeah,

1624
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,790
we're not.
It's not like 1940,

1625
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:59,791
whatever the fuck it was when people 
figured out Iowasca whatever year it 

1626
01:19:59,791 --> 01:19:59,940
was.
What year was it?

1627
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,290
Goes back a very long.
No,

1628
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,880
but I mean Western world.
When they.

1629
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:06,760
When Mckenna talked about how they 
first,

1630
01:20:06,761 --> 01:20:11,761
when they harming,
they wanted to call it telepathy 

1631
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:15,470
telepathy,
but they realized that it had already 

1632
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,160
been been scientifically defined as 
harming.

1633
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:17,610
Yeah.
So that was.

1634
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,310
What year was that?
That would probably be in 1930.

1635
01:20:20,311 --> 01:20:21,970
Somewhere $30 or 40.
Twenty to 20.

1636
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,610
And then Watson.
Gordon Wasson was in like the fifties.

1637
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:28,110
It was $50 goes down to Mexico 
encounters.

1638
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:32,370
Maria Sabina has a mushroom experience 
and that's the beginning of the mushroom

1639
01:20:32,371 --> 01:20:33,540
story.
In the West actually,

1640
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:39,060
so that's like modern western culture 
and civilization.

1641
01:20:39,061 --> 01:20:44,061
This is our introduction to it,
but this shit had been going on for 

1642
01:20:44,061 --> 01:20:44,790
thousands and thousands and thousands of
years.

1643
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:49,790
So for us to assume that these you,
especially you and I who have had these 

1644
01:20:49,790 --> 01:20:52,170
psychedelic experiences,
I've never had an Iowaska experience,

1645
01:20:52,171 --> 01:20:55,890
but I've had many a dozen dmt trips and 
mushroom trips.

1646
01:20:55,900 --> 01:20:58,350
Yeah,
there's something there.

1647
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:03,710
There's something there that's 
unbelievably intense and to deny that 

1648
01:21:03,710 --> 01:21:06,560
that had an effect on consciousness of 
emerging people crazy.

1649
01:21:06,660 --> 01:21:09,150
It's ridiculous.
It's just crazy in my opinion,

1650
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,480
very anti scientific.
It's extremely anti scientific.

1651
01:21:12,481 --> 01:21:17,481
It is like the modern inquisition,
but it's a weird thing where people are 

1652
01:21:17,481 --> 01:21:19,500
ignoring that aspect and concentrating 
on all the other potential aspects,

1653
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:22,890
which I think probably worked in some 
sort of a symbiotic fashion.

1654
01:21:22,891 --> 01:21:25,650
Yeah.
The introduction of meat into the Diet,

1655
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:26,460
the,
um,

1656
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:31,520
the experimenting with different food 
sources because of the changing of the 

1657
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,971
climate.
There was a lot of factors that came 

1658
01:21:34,971 --> 01:21:37,971
into play that made lower hominids human
beings a lot of every evolutionary 

1659
01:21:37,971 --> 01:21:39,600
factors,
a lot of environmental factors,

1660
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:41,010
a lot of experimental factors.

1661
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,400
Um,
a lot of things happened where there was

1662
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,460
some benefits to certain types of 
behavior and those people survived and 

1663
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,520
then things evolved and changed.
And then boom,

1664
01:21:50,521 --> 01:21:54,120
we have Graham Hancock here at 2014 
sitting in front of his apple laptop.

1665
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:55,020
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

1666
01:21:55,021 --> 01:21:57,000
there was a lot of things had to take 
place a lot.

1667
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,430
It was a,
it was a very complicated process,

1668
01:21:59,431 --> 01:22:03,710
but I'm absolutely sure that 
psychedelics were a key word,

1669
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:08,740
a key part of it.
Everyone who's taken psychedelics is 

1670
01:22:08,740 --> 01:22:09,720
pretty sure that it was a key part.
You know,

1671
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:14,721
why?
Because you've had the experience and 

1672
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:17,001
everyone who doesn't.
If you haven't had a psychedelic 

1673
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:20,361
experience and you're talking about 
psychedelic experiences being not a 

1674
01:22:20,361 --> 01:22:20,640
factor,
a noneffective,

1675
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:21,900
you're crazy.
Yeah.

1676
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:23,160
You'd be better to shut up.
Well,

1677
01:22:23,161 --> 01:22:26,100
it's just nonsense because they have 
people who have not had the,

1678
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:27,420
had the experience at all.

1679
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:32,450
I just don't even in my view,
need to come to the table because 

1680
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:33,660
they've got nothing to bring to the 
discussion.

1681
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:38,690
I don't mind if they come to the table,
but I find their arguments to be almost 

1682
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:38,690
hilarious.
Yeah,

1683
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:43,100
it's like I have a very good friend 
who's a very intelligent guy and he's 

1684
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:44,850
never taken any drugs and his take on it
is,

1685
01:22:44,851 --> 01:22:46,650
and he's a brilliant guy,
loved talking to him,

1686
01:22:46,830 --> 01:22:50,970
but his take on it is simply a,
all the work's been done.

1687
01:22:50,971 --> 01:22:53,640
There's no,
I'm not going to learn anything new from

1688
01:22:53,641 --> 01:22:54,930
that.
And I'm like,

1689
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:56,730
well that's so crazy.
Yeah,

1690
01:22:57,120 --> 01:22:58,760
I'll just say his name,
Penn Jillette Rice.

1691
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,120
I love that guy,
but it was the same,

1692
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,680
but he doesn't do any drugs.
It doesn't do anything.

1693
01:23:01,681 --> 01:23:06,681
Right,
and he feels that there is no need for 

1694
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:06,681
him to say it's all been figured out 
with all the work's been done.

1695
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:06,850
I'm like,
Oh God,

1696
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:11,910
dude,
let me get you high on Dmt last 15 

1697
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:12,100
minutes and you tell me what work's been
done.

1698
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:13,220
See,
that's,

1699
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:18,320
that's what's so I think what's so 
special about dmt in particular is that 

1700
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:21,280
there is that there is no negotiation 
with the experience.

1701
01:23:21,281 --> 01:23:23,080
There are very few people who can resist
it.

1702
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:28,110
Once you hit the hit the threshold 
because it dose and it's going to take 

1703
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:32,761
you where it where it takes you a.
Then you are confronted by one of the 

1704
01:23:32,761 --> 01:23:35,851
most intense and extraordinary 
experiences that it is possible for any 

1705
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:37,480
human being to have.
Yes,

1706
01:23:37,481 --> 01:23:39,640
we can jump out of an airplane at 10,000
feet.

1707
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,920
Yes,
we can scale a sheer cliff.

1708
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:45,220
That's also very intense and very,
very extraordinary.

1709
01:23:45,221 --> 01:23:47,290
Yes,
we can go scuba diving to the depths,

1710
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:52,480
but if we look at the whole range of 
human experiences and say what is one of

1711
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:57,481
the most intense and potentially most 
transformative experiences as possible 

1712
01:23:57,481 --> 01:24:01,651
to have,
I would say dmt done with the right 

1713
01:24:01,651 --> 01:24:02,350
intention and the right context is right
up there with anything else.

1714
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,450
It's the most intense thing I've ever 
experienced.

1715
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:04,930
Me Too.
I mean,

1716
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,180
I haven't experienced everything.
Obviously.

1717
01:24:07,181 --> 01:24:10,090
I've never been scuba diving.
I've never been skydiving and it doesn't

1718
01:24:10,091 --> 01:24:12,430
mean that those things aren't intense as
well,

1719
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:17,730
but to deny the impact of those things,
it seems silly and the people that are 

1720
01:24:17,921 --> 01:24:20,760
arguing against the,
the,

1721
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:25,780
the,
the efficacy of these experiences or 

1722
01:24:25,780 --> 01:24:27,901
against the influence of these 
experiences to have those people 

1723
01:24:27,901 --> 01:24:31,171
actually have never haven't had taken 
these experiences arguing against them.

1724
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:33,480
It seems so silly.
It's crazy.

1725
01:24:33,490 --> 01:24:35,510
It's crazy.
It's crazy that they're scared of them,

1726
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:39,610
but it's those people are who are 
running the rules in our society still.

1727
01:24:39,630 --> 01:24:40,710
Yeah.
Well if they,

1728
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,730
if they weren't there would be really 
terrifying.

1729
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,510
If our society was wrong in the way it 
is now by a bunch of people doing dmt,

1730
01:24:46,511 --> 01:24:47,830
you'd be like,
what the fuck?

1731
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:48,470
Yeah,
but that,

1732
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:51,970
that's one thing we can be quite sure if
our society was run by a bunch of people

1733
01:24:51,971 --> 01:24:53,830
doing dmt.
It wouldn't be running the way that it's

1734
01:24:53,831 --> 01:24:54,540
run.
No,

1735
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:55,210
it wasn't.
Well,

1736
01:24:55,211 --> 01:25:00,211
you know,
Makenna found out about dmt by a friend 

1737
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:02,971
who is a scientist to work with the army
research lab and they had like a barrel 

1738
01:25:02,971 --> 01:25:05,130
of the stuff,
they had a fucking barrel of emt.

1739
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:06,100
And if anyone,
if you've,

1740
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:10,120
DMT is,
it's very small doses,

1741
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:12,070
they're tiny,
transformative.

1742
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:16,390
These tiny little doses that you smoke 
take you into these incredible realm.

1743
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,460
So the idea of a barrel.
Yes,

1744
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:22,820
or Lsd,
I mean the Mckenna described Lsd and the

1745
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:27,890
best way I've ever heard is that the 
amount of Lsd you need for it to be 

1746
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:32,641
effective is like an ant that can break 
down the empire state building in 30 

1747
01:25:32,641 --> 01:25:32,730
minutes,
like exact,

1748
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:34,090
literally that little.

1749
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:37,660
He was a great genius.
And it's um,

1750
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:39,010
it's very fortunate.
Again,

1751
01:25:39,011 --> 01:25:43,370
we have the Internet and the Terence 
Mckenna is his passed in the year 2000.

1752
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:48,400
He's still,
he's still with us and his and he is 

1753
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,470
having this liberating effect on people 
all around the world.

1754
01:25:50,471 --> 01:25:53,170
And he had the gift.
He had the gift of language.

1755
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:58,410
He spoke in a such a compelling way.
I love listening to parents.

1756
01:25:58,450 --> 01:25:59,380
I do too.
Bill Hicks,

1757
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:00,880
you know,
the two of them together,

1758
01:26:01,390 --> 01:26:06,390
just amazed,
and Hicks was a huge fan of Mckenna and 

1759
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:06,590
became,
I found out about Mckenna because of him

1760
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:09,530
because there was a joke where I'm Hicks
said,

1761
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:14,590
uh,
something about leaving mushrooms under 

1762
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:14,590
the,
um,

1763
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:18,460
under the table of all these people,
take it and it he said what Terence 

1764
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:23,500
Mckenna would describe as a heroic dose.
I don't remember saying who the fuck is 

1765
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:27,131
Terence Mckenna?
And so then I wasn't even a google back 

1766
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:27,131
then.

1767
01:26:27,131 --> 01:26:29,210
I searched Terence Mckenna because of 
hearing about it on Bill Hicks.

1768
01:26:29,870 --> 01:26:31,980
And then I got ahold of some of the,
um,

1769
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:37,450
the uh,
audio recordings and then you listened 

1770
01:26:37,450 --> 01:26:37,730
to the guy's voice.
It's like,

1771
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:38,870
wow,
what a weird guy,

1772
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:39,590
you know,
weird,

1773
01:26:39,830 --> 01:26:42,620
interesting,
compelling way of communicating credible

1774
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:46,670
use of language a which just makes you 
think all the,

1775
01:26:46,760 --> 01:26:51,760
all the time.
That's the service he's providing for 

1776
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:51,760
all of us still.
Yeah.

1777
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:52,580
I mean,
he missed the mark on that December 21st

1778
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:56,650
2012 showed everybody did at.
Everybody's got to miss the mark.

1779
01:26:57,290 --> 01:27:02,290
Guy Used to get high a lot and come up 
with the cool theories and things to 

1780
01:27:02,290 --> 01:27:04,100
think about and when you're postulating 
and thinking about the future.

1781
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,590
Here's the thing about thinking about 
the future.

1782
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:08,710
No one's ever got it right.
No,

1783
01:27:08,930 --> 01:27:11,990
no one has ever figured out the future.
There's not a single fucking person ever

1784
01:27:12,010 --> 01:27:13,760
sat down anybody to get it right.

1785
01:27:13,820 --> 01:27:15,620
Nobody got it right.
The future is.

1786
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:18,440
The future is indeterminate.
Yeah.

1787
01:27:18,441 --> 01:27:20,080
It's interesting.
I mean,

1788
01:27:20,120 --> 01:27:25,120
talking about psychedelics,
the what's happening with cannabis in 

1789
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:26,560
the United States right now is,
is very,

1790
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:30,520
is very interesting to me coming from 
coming from Britain where you know,

1791
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:35,540
nobody has ever even willing to 
contemplate the legalization or the 

1792
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:38,360
direct striction of cannabis,
but in America state by state,

1793
01:27:38,810 --> 01:27:42,530
people are voting with their feet and 
the barriers of being,

1794
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:43,430
uh,
being broken down.

1795
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:48,431
I mean,
America has been the huge dark force 

1796
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:50,270
behind the war on drugs all over the 
world for the last 40 or 50 years.

1797
01:27:50,271 --> 01:27:53,900
So many countries around the world have 
just blindly followed the American lead.

1798
01:27:53,901 --> 01:27:56,450
That's the American government.
That's the American power structure.

1799
01:27:56,451 --> 01:27:59,240
But the American people are saying,
no,

1800
01:27:59,540 --> 01:28:04,540
the American people are saying,
actually we want to smoke cannabis and 

1801
01:28:04,540 --> 01:28:07,940
we find it positive and nurturing for us
and state by state,

1802
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:13,060
either it's being decriminalized or 
medical Mariajuana is available or it's 

1803
01:28:13,941 --> 01:28:16,010
actually being legalized in a number of 
cases.

1804
01:28:16,010 --> 01:28:18,200
This is a big change.
Again,

1805
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:23,201
there's all kinds of conspiracy theories
like how Monsanto's going to take it 

1806
01:28:23,201 --> 01:28:24,560
over and so on and so forth,
but I see it as a really good thing that

1807
01:28:24,561 --> 01:28:29,561
these barriers in the heartland of the 
war of drugs are being broken down by 

1808
01:28:29,561 --> 01:28:33,140
the American people themselves and I say
Kudos to the American people for getting

1809
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:38,141
on and making that happen because it's 
going to be a benefit to the whole 

1810
01:28:38,141 --> 01:28:38,141
world.
Yeah.

1811
01:28:38,141 --> 01:28:39,440
Warren Buffet is starting to get into 
the marijuana trade.

1812
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:44,460
Oh yeah.
That's when things are going to get 

1813
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:44,460
freaky because then you got a guy who's 
worth $90,

1814
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:45,950
million dollars or whatever the hell 
he's worth.

1815
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,290
That's when things can get very 
interesting.

1816
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:48,770
Well,
sure.

1817
01:28:48,771 --> 01:28:53,771
I mean people are going to.
People are going to make commercial 

1818
01:28:53,771 --> 01:28:56,561
advantage of this,
but at the end of the day I just come 

1819
01:28:56,561 --> 01:28:59,351
back to,
this is something that I've said again 

1820
01:28:59,351 --> 01:28:59,351
and again,
as the years have gone have gone by,

1821
01:28:59,351 --> 01:29:02,921
for me,
the fundamental issue is the right of 

1822
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:02,921
the adult

1823
01:29:02,921 --> 01:29:07,550
to make sovereign decisions about their 
own consciousness and one of those 

1824
01:29:07,550 --> 01:29:11,010
sovereign decisions has to be the right 
to use cannabis or not to use it,

1825
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:16,040
but one must be free to make that 
decision and not and not controlled by 

1826
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,941
society and once that is recognized,
once all the scare stories about 

1827
01:29:19,941 --> 01:29:23,670
cannabis go away and we find that in 
fact state by state,

1828
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:28,910
it's a.
it's a positive rather than a harmful 

1829
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:31,761
thing.
I think that the question marks are 

1830
01:29:31,761 --> 01:29:33,150
going to begin to arise over the 
psychedelics to and and we're going to.

1831
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:36,420
We're going to see all those barriers 
breaking down in the years to come.

1832
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:37,670
Yeah,
I think you're right.

1833
01:29:37,671 --> 01:29:41,900
I think the bringing up Warren Buffett 
and Warren Buffet's company specifically

1834
01:29:42,530 --> 01:29:45,980
what's happening is he's a part of this 
company.

1835
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:49,190
He says its subsidiary,
subsidiary,

1836
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:54,430
subsidiary of Berkshire hathaway has 
this company called cubic designs and 

1837
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:01,760
they sell the maximize usable floor 
space in warehouses and they sent a 

1838
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:07,220
thousand flyers to weed dispensary's in 
recent weeks and these flyers,

1839
01:30:07,730 --> 01:30:12,730
they show these medical marijuana grow 
ops and it's like double your users 

1840
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:14,820
growing.
This is fucking like,

1841
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:19,870
this is intense stuff because it's 
companies that are real estate holders 

1842
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:21,350
that have giant amounts of,
um,

1843
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:26,530
of,
of money invested in this that are 

1844
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:26,530
saying,
you know,

1845
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:28,500
what we're going to dip our feet into 
this is growing marijuana industry.

1846
01:30:28,501 --> 01:30:28,910
And.
Exactly.

1847
01:30:28,911 --> 01:30:33,911
I have a friend who works at a 
dispensary in Colorado and the 

1848
01:30:33,911 --> 01:30:36,980
dispensary is five acres indoor.
Wow.

1849
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:39,210
Five acres.
That's great.

1850
01:30:39,230 --> 01:30:43,310
Five acres.
That's an enormous building and it's all

1851
01:30:43,311 --> 01:30:43,760
pot.

1852
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:48,940
It's just millions of dollars in 
marijuana and there's people that are 

1853
01:30:48,940 --> 01:30:50,720
there.
This has only been less than a year.

1854
01:30:50,740 --> 01:30:53,360
I mean it was made legal last January 
and here we are.

1855
01:30:53,361 --> 01:30:56,090
We're talking right now.
It is September of 2014.

1856
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:02,200
This is a crazy thing.
I just did my comedy special in Denver 

1857
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:07,000
and I hadn't been at Denver and while 
the places changed and it's like 

1858
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,990
marijuana is a huge part of the culture 
now.

1859
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:11,330
People are moving,
there's marijuana tourism,

1860
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:14,210
people are moving there for marijuana.
They're moving there to be a part of the

1861
01:31:14,211 --> 01:31:19,211
marijuana business because you can get 
really fucking rich right now because 

1862
01:31:19,211 --> 01:31:23,080
there's a lot of people that are not 
sure what's gonna Happen federally 

1863
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:25,991
because it's still illegal federally,
so they're not sure whether or not they 

1864
01:31:25,991 --> 01:31:29,741
want to dive into it yet,
but the people that are bold that are 

1865
01:31:29,741 --> 01:31:32,680
willing to take a risk or making insane 
profits a chance of making a sheehan 

1866
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:37,120
from it and the government is making a 
lot of money to 39 percent of the 

1867
01:31:37,251 --> 01:31:38,860
profits go to taxes.
Wow.

1868
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:41,990
So every marijuana joint that's gets 
sold 39.

1869
01:31:41,991 --> 01:31:44,540
If it's sold for a dollar thirty nine 
cents,

1870
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:47,090
no one's selling for a dollar,
but if it's sold for $100,

1871
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:52,130
$39 is going to the government.
So they're making over $100,000,000

1872
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:54,500
this year in taxes just in Colorado.

1873
01:31:54,630 --> 01:31:55,700
Yeah.
State government.

1874
01:31:55,701 --> 01:32:00,701
Yes,
and so they're looking at this by the 

1875
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:00,701
federal government is not reaping the 
revenues.

1876
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:00,701
It's no

1877
01:32:00,701 --> 01:32:01,720
because it's illegal,
it's illegal,

1878
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:05,140
but they're finally allowing the people 
to put their money in banks,

1879
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:10,500
which was a long time.
They had to do this weird shit where 

1880
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:11,980
they had to like put it in safe deposit 
boxes or they had to buy,

1881
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:17,040
take the cash and then use it to buy 
bank notes and the like by bank checks,

1882
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,830
it's very strange.
They weren't allowing them to use credit

1883
01:32:20,831 --> 01:32:25,831
cards or any of the normal ways that 
people do business that keep them from 

1884
01:32:25,831 --> 01:32:28,720
being robbed at gunpoint by criminals,
untrackable bills,

1885
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:34,020
so they had these kids that were driving
around with stacks of cash is really 

1886
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,860
dangerous and scary,
very dangerous and scary,

1887
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:40,861
but it's very.
It's very good that the goal of this is 

1888
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:40,861
changing and I can only see it as a good
thing.

1889
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,820
I don't see any.
I don't see any downside in it.

1890
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:47,820
It's a really,
really positive development that's 

1891
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:47,820
taking this taking place.
I agree,

1892
01:32:47,820 --> 01:32:51,900
and I think it's also a part of this 
whole movement that you and I were 

1893
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:52,270
talking about where the world is 
changing,

1894
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:57,510
information is out there,
people are just not prepared to put up 

1895
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:59,530
with that fucking shit and he longer and
not prepared to put up with it,

1896
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:02,530
to be told what to think,
to be told what to do with their own,

1897
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:07,890
with their own consciousness,
and it's great that that it's Americans 

1898
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:12,600
who are leading the way in this and that
and the rest of the world is watching 

1899
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:14,380
and all the lies we've been told about 
cannabis,

1900
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:19,650
they're going to just drift away and be 
wrecked and destroyed forever by what's 

1901
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:21,730
happening in America.
So it's a great service that's being,

1902
01:33:22,030 --> 01:33:23,470
that's being done to the world.
As you know,

1903
01:33:23,471 --> 01:33:26,170
I had my own longterm relationship with 
cannabis.

1904
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:29,470
I smoked cannabis for 24 years.
I overindulged.

1905
01:33:29,471 --> 01:33:32,890
I undoubtedly abused my relationship 
with cannabis.

1906
01:33:32,891 --> 01:33:35,200
I don't blame the cannabis for that.
It was me.

1907
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,990
I was.
I was crazy.

1908
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,280
I was crazy.
A little crazy.

1909
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:40,480
I mean,
it's very crazy to,

1910
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,880
to smoke it from nine in the morning 
until 2:00

1911
01:33:42,881 --> 01:33:47,881
the next morning,
seven days a week of rather vaporize it 

1912
01:33:47,881 --> 01:33:49,150
as I as I did,
and I reached a point thanks to a series

1913
01:33:49,151 --> 01:33:54,151
of Iowasca journeys in October 2011 
where I made the decision that I 

1914
01:33:54,151 --> 01:33:56,860
wouldn't smoke cannabis and it's three 
years have come since then,

1915
01:33:56,861 --> 01:34:01,861
but I want to live in a society where I 
and fellow adults are free to choose 

1916
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:06,840
either to use cannabis or not to use it 
without any state agent sticking their 

1917
01:34:08,081 --> 01:34:10,660
nose in our private business.
This is,

1918
01:34:10,661 --> 01:34:15,661
this is our private business,
what we do with our own consciousness 

1919
01:34:15,661 --> 01:34:19,660
and,
and it's incredibly encouraging to see 

1920
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:23,701
that the Americans are taking that power
back and showing the rest of the world 

1921
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:23,701
how to do it.

1922
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:24,360
And also,
um,

1923
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:28,780
antipop doctors are being exposed.
It's really fascinating.

1924
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:32,100
All these doctors that are paid off by 
pharmaceutical companies.

1925
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:37,320
There was an article recently about pot 
doctors being paid off and all of the 

1926
01:34:38,141 --> 01:34:40,900
leading pot,
like antipop doctors,

1927
01:34:40,930 --> 01:34:43,300
all of them taking it.
Oh yeah.

1928
01:34:43,301 --> 01:34:44,980
All of them.
Why am I not surprised?

1929
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:50,010
Well,
it's interesting that guys like Sanjay 

1930
01:34:50,010 --> 01:34:51,910
Gupta who used to do that,
we used to be on board with that now has

1931
01:34:52,070 --> 01:34:57,070
come out,
come out in a huge way and he's also 

1932
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:57,590
starting to address psychedelics 
starting to address what's going on with

1933
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:58,370
psilocybin

1934
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:03,370
and there's the new study that's shown,
these people that took psilocybin and 

1935
01:35:03,370 --> 01:35:04,580
quit smoking six months later,
80 percent of them,

1936
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:05,660
some,
some large number,

1937
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:09,320
70 or 80 percent quit smoking and didn't
go back to it.

1938
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:14,321
Yeah.
Because of just the clarity of those 

1939
01:35:14,321 --> 01:35:18,461
visions where you kind of understand 
like what am I doing to get that 

1940
01:35:18,461 --> 01:35:18,970
perspective on your,
on yourself here and that's,

1941
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,810
that's the,
that's the big news.

1942
01:35:20,811 --> 01:35:25,811
You know that these,
that these things are positive and 

1943
01:35:25,811 --> 01:35:28,780
beneficial and the way forward for 
society is to create a positive social 

1944
01:35:29,931 --> 01:35:34,931
environment and positive spaces in which
in which we can explore these 

1945
01:35:34,931 --> 01:35:38,381
experiences and the result for society 
as a whole will be very positive and 

1946
01:35:38,631 --> 01:35:43,631
very convinced of that.
Vice Dot com is the guy who broke the 

1947
01:35:43,631 --> 01:35:47,921
story.
It's incredible and it's all these 

1948
01:35:47,921 --> 01:35:51,551
different doctors that have like,
here's one Dr Herbert Keebler of a club 

1949
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,000
or clever of Columbia University.

1950
01:35:56,120 --> 01:36:01,120
He's been impeccable.
Academic credentials has been quoted in 

1951
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:03,620
the press and academic publications 
warning against the use of marijuana,

1952
01:36:03,621 --> 01:36:06,620
which he stresses may cause wide ranging
addiction.

1953
01:36:06,770 --> 01:36:11,770
That's my favorite wide ranging 
addiction and public health issues when 

1954
01:36:11,770 --> 01:36:14,060
he's writing his antipop opinion pieces 
for CBS News.

1955
01:36:14,240 --> 01:36:17,300
CBS News are being quoted by NBR and 
CNBC.

1956
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:22,301
What's left unsaid is that clever has 
served as a paid consultant to leading 

1957
01:36:22,301 --> 01:36:25,190
prescription drug companies,
including purdue Pharma,

1958
01:36:25,191 --> 01:36:29,130
the maker of Oxycontin,
Reckitt Bank bank,

1959
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:34,140
Kaiser,
the producer of painkiller called 

1960
01:36:34,140 --> 01:36:36,851
neurofen and out comers Alker Mez the 
producer of a powerful new opiod called 

1961
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,690
Z o h,
why dro?

1962
01:36:44,691 --> 01:36:46,910
How do you say that?
Zohydro Zohydro,

1963
01:36:46,911 --> 01:36:51,810
I guess I can't count.
And what you say is what?

1964
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:52,350
What,
what,

1965
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,080
what,
what,

1966
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:53,630
what?
He's,

1967
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:57,500
what he's been hiding and covering up is
that all this stuff he's pushing.

1968
01:36:57,501 --> 01:37:01,340
That's the real addictive drugs will pay
10,000

1969
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:02,240
deaths a year.

1970
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:06,350
It's a multi billion dollar business 
that causes 16 deaths a year.

1971
01:37:06,351 --> 01:37:11,351
Just in this,
this sixteen thousand sixteen thousand 

1972
01:37:11,351 --> 01:37:14,711
deaths a year stunning and a doctors are
on the take to keep promoting that and 

1973
01:37:16,221 --> 01:37:20,780
to stop us exercising our free choice as
adults to manage our pain in other ways.

1974
01:37:20,781 --> 01:37:22,070
For example,
with cannabis,

1975
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,070
and even if it did,
it was just 16 desk.

1976
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:25,000
Obviously.
I agree.

1977
01:37:25,020 --> 01:37:29,810
Sixteen thousand 16 desks that 16 more 
than cannabis causing zero.

1978
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:32,720
Cannabis doesn't kill any.
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.

1979
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:37,721
Like you could die from aspirin.
A lot of people die every year from 

1980
01:37:37,721 --> 01:37:37,721
aspirin and a lot of people die every 
year from salt.

1981
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,190
Too much salt and they die absolutely 
drink too.

1982
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:42,470
We have a painkiller,
I think you'd call it a set,

1983
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:44,330
a set to a fan.
He said,

1984
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:46,850
America,
we call it paracetamol in in England and

1985
01:37:46,851 --> 01:37:47,900
had reflux.
You liver.

1986
01:37:47,960 --> 01:37:48,770
Oh,
it's really,

1987
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:50,690
really dangerous.
Dangerous thing and,

1988
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,790
and,
and once it reaches a certain level,

1989
01:37:52,791 --> 01:37:55,220
there is no recovery from it and it 
kills thousands.

1990
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:56,100
Thousands of people.

1991
01:37:56,100 --> 01:38:01,100
A year while I was reading this thing 
about bodybuilder or watching a video 

1992
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:04,041
rather about bodybuilding and this guy 
was being interviewed who used to be 

1993
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:08,001
this big competitive bodybuilder and 
they're talking to all the drugs that 

1994
01:38:08,001 --> 01:38:11,330
you have to take to get so big,
but one of the things you were talking 

1995
01:38:11,330 --> 01:38:13,440
about was that what really kills these 
guys is not the steroids.

1996
01:38:13,620 --> 01:38:14,820
It's painkillers,
right?

1997
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,880
They all get hooked on painkillers 
because they're in pain all the time 

1998
01:38:19,880 --> 01:38:22,611
because they're lifting all this crazy 
weight and fuck fucking up their body 

1999
01:38:22,611 --> 01:38:23,040
while they're doing it and they take 
Acetaminophen.

2000
01:38:23,041 --> 01:38:27,000
All these different values,
percosets and that stuff.

2001
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:30,050
It just destroys their kidneys.
Destroys your liver.

2002
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:30,620
Kidneys.
Yeah.

2003
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,800
It's withdrawal symptom from stopping.
Taking the painkiller is huge amount of 

2004
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,500
pain,
so you then go and take more,

2005
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:39,210
more painkillers.
These are highly,

2006
01:38:39,450 --> 01:38:40,650
highly addictive,
highly,

2007
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,760
highly dangerous drugs.

2008
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,040
Yeah,
and state sanctioned.

2009
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:47,160
Taken out.
Totally,

2010
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:49,860
totally state show.
So I'm wondering now,

2011
01:38:49,861 --> 01:38:54,861
three years after I gave up cannabis,
whether back in dip my toes back in the 

2012
01:38:55,351 --> 01:38:59,100
water in there in a respectful way,
not,

2013
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:01,920
not do it every day,
have some sacred moments.

2014
01:39:02,610 --> 01:39:04,890
I value the sensual side of it.
I don't know.

2015
01:39:04,891 --> 01:39:05,510
I'm,
I'm,

2016
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,830
I'm the next time I have an eyewash 
station I'm going to,

2017
01:39:08,250 --> 01:39:13,250
I'm going to ask a Iowasca is going to 
be my intent because that was Iowasca 

2018
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,270
that really interrupted by cannabis 
habit.

2019
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:16,860
I'm going to ask,
is there a way I can do this?

2020
01:39:17,040 --> 01:39:18,330
I don't know.
Maybe that's weak of me.

2021
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:19,680
I've wondered this.
You know,

2022
01:39:19,681 --> 01:39:24,681
I was talking with a friend last night 
and he said there is a true addict 

2023
01:39:24,681 --> 01:39:24,681
speaking.
You know,

2024
01:39:24,681 --> 01:39:25,830
I said this because it sounds a bit.
It sounds a bit like that,

2025
01:39:25,831 --> 01:39:28,140
but I,
I did volume cannabis.

2026
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:33,140
It was,
it was an extraordinary positive thing 

2027
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:33,140
for me in many,
many ways.

2028
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,200
And I,
I.

2029
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:37,050
What I feel is that I got out of balance
with it and if I could,

2030
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:42,560
if I could find that balance again and 
use it rarely at special times,

2031
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:44,250
then I think it would be okay.
But I'm,

2032
01:39:44,251 --> 01:39:44,910
I'm,
I'm,

2033
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,860
I'm a little afraid to go back there.
Well,

2034
01:39:46,861 --> 01:39:47,950
you should be afraid,
right?

2035
01:39:48,020 --> 01:39:53,020
You know,
because you've had personal experience 

2036
01:39:53,020 --> 01:39:55,071
with addiction.
And I think that addiction is purely 

2037
01:39:55,071 --> 01:39:57,351
mental.
It's purely metal because it was very 

2038
01:39:57,351 --> 01:39:59,511
easy to stop.
Once Iowasca gave me the message and I 

2039
01:39:59,511 --> 01:39:59,511
really got that.
I,

2040
01:39:59,511 --> 01:40:00,840
I had a severe kicking first of all,
a DMT trip.

2041
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:04,260
Then immediately afterwards,
five Iowasca sessions I was,

2042
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:09,290
I was psychologically beaten up and the 
message of that beating was you have to 

2043
01:40:09,290 --> 01:40:11,280
stop smoking cannabis and,
and uh,

2044
01:40:11,710 --> 01:40:12,810
and,
and I did.

2045
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:15,510
And looking back on it,
it's absurd to,

2046
01:40:15,530 --> 01:40:19,050
this is a very,
very powerful a plant agent.

2047
01:40:19,051 --> 01:40:20,700
And here I am,
you know,

2048
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:25,410
vaporizing it 16 hours a day,
seven days a week.

2049
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,510
You went deep.
I went deep.

2050
01:40:27,511 --> 01:40:28,100
I went,
I went,

2051
01:40:28,110 --> 01:40:29,370
I went,
I went very deep.

2052
01:40:29,371 --> 01:40:29,680
And,
and,

2053
01:40:29,681 --> 01:40:30,130
and,
but,

2054
01:40:30,180 --> 01:40:35,180
and it got to the point where I wasn't 
enjoying it anymore where I just felt 

2055
01:40:35,180 --> 01:40:38,451
that I couldn't live my life without it,
but I discovered I easily could live my 

2056
01:40:38,461 --> 01:40:39,690
life without it.
When I stopped,

2057
01:40:39,691 --> 01:40:41,700
it wasn't a huge chore,
a problem to stop.

2058
01:40:41,701 --> 01:40:46,701
It wasn't actually difficult and then 
that sense I would definitely was not 

2059
01:40:46,701 --> 01:40:48,410
physically addicted to it.
Yeah.

2060
01:40:48,510 --> 01:40:53,510
That's the thing is that I think there's
some people that do get physically 

2061
01:40:53,531 --> 01:40:54,010
addicted.

2062
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:55,740
I'm not,
you know,

2063
01:40:55,780 --> 01:41:00,780
I used to say marijuana is not addictive
and I don't think it is with most 

2064
01:41:00,780 --> 01:41:04,711
people,
but I think biological diversity of 

2065
01:41:04,711 --> 01:41:08,130
biodiversity in human beings is such 
that there's certain folks that have 

2066
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,050
weird reactions to all kinds of shows 
and things.

2067
01:41:11,051 --> 01:41:16,051
Cats,
some people around cats like my friend 

2068
01:41:16,051 --> 01:41:16,051
Gary,
he can't even come over my house because

2069
01:41:16,051 --> 01:41:20,671
I have two cats.
If he walks in the door he was 

2070
01:41:20,671 --> 01:41:20,671
targeting,
gets as wheezing.

2071
01:41:20,671 --> 01:41:22,510
You can't breathe.
Like he has to get out of there.

2072
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:27,560
They kill him with a room of cats.
But then I got my friend Joey Diaz who 

2073
01:41:27,560 --> 01:41:27,730
has,
what is y'all 11?

2074
01:41:28,090 --> 01:41:30,930
I think he has 11 cats,
so motherfucker has 11 credits.

2075
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:33,050
Yeah,
but if you.

2076
01:41:33,090 --> 01:41:35,350
If my friend Gary went over my friend 
show his house,

2077
01:41:35,351 --> 01:41:36,500
he would.
He would die.

2078
01:41:36,501 --> 01:41:38,470
Yeah,
but Joey's having a party over there.

2079
01:41:38,650 --> 01:41:40,530
He's got cats on his lap.
He's pet numb.

2080
01:41:40,531 --> 01:41:43,120
They're sitting on his shoulders.
We're all.

2081
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:45,700
We're all different than what works for 
one person,

2082
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:47,470
doesn't,
doesn't work for another,

2083
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,970
and that's again,
why,

2084
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:54,420
why this issue of adult sovereignty of 
us having the right to make our choices 

2085
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:58,411
about our own bodies is fundamental and 
and actually with the psychedelics and 

2086
01:41:58,411 --> 01:42:02,851
the cannabis issue,
that's just the tip of the iceberg of 

2087
01:42:02,851 --> 01:42:05,431
the whole issue of health and personal 
health and how our society is working to

2088
01:42:05,861 --> 01:42:10,861
take away our choices over our personal 
health and to turn us into robots who 

2089
01:42:11,830 --> 01:42:16,830
consume the products that are pumped at 
us by the big pharmaceutical companies 

2090
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:21,571
or who are inventing every year this 
unholy alliance with psychiatrists and 

2091
01:42:21,571 --> 01:42:26,401
venting every year.
New mental conditions for which new 

2092
01:42:26,401 --> 01:42:27,130
pills will be.
Will be dosed out.

2093
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:28,090
Yeah.
In England,

2094
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:30,070
you guys don't have those commercials 
either.

2095
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:32,650
Those commercials are so fucking 
insidious.

2096
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:37,980
Ask Your doctor about this drug that 
might cause you to shit yourself all day

2097
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:39,680
long.
Commit suicide,

2098
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:44,700
suicide.
The big untold story about 

2099
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:47,581
antidepressants,
the antidepressants caused people to 

2100
01:42:47,581 --> 01:42:50,101
kill themselves.
How about antidepressants that 

2101
01:42:50,101 --> 01:42:52,441
supplement the antidepressing 
antidepressants like there's certain 

2102
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:54,250
antidepressant,
I forget what it was called.

2103
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:59,251
It had insane side effects that they 
were promoting as a supplement to your 

2104
01:42:59,561 --> 01:43:04,561
regular antidepressant.
Regular antidepressants isn't doing it 

2105
01:43:04,561 --> 01:43:08,251
until you sit up with this one,
but this one could cause fucking kidney 

2106
01:43:08,251 --> 01:43:08,980
failure.
Your Dick might fly across the room like

2107
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:12,100
a mocking bird.
We didn't think anything could happen to

2108
01:43:12,101 --> 01:43:17,101
you,
but you might not be depressed or you 

2109
01:43:17,101 --> 01:43:17,101
might just take our pills.
These other doctors,

2110
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:20,170
drug dealers,
these are the true matthew of drugs.

2111
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,210
Well,
it's also the idea of commercials.

2112
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:27,360
Commercials are influential and the 
influence of commercials is very 

2113
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:31,861
insidious because there's one thing if a
commercial is influencing you to buy a 

2114
01:43:31,861 --> 01:43:33,160
particular vacuum cleaner,
but that doesn't bother me man.

2115
01:43:33,340 --> 01:43:35,200
This is the best it look.
If you're,

2116
01:43:35,290 --> 01:43:38,800
if you're too much of a knucklehead to 
go and consumer reports or you know,

2117
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:43,830
go to read reviews online by independent
people that tell you this vacuum cleaner

2118
01:43:44,231 --> 01:43:45,940
is great,
this vacuum cleaner sucks.

2119
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:47,710
If you're too much of a knucklehead to 
do that,

2120
01:43:47,711 --> 01:43:50,560
I don't feel bad for the executive,
but when it comes to consciousness,

2121
01:43:50,561 --> 01:43:51,980
when it comes to pills,

2122
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:53,990
especially when it comes to happiness,
man,

2123
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:56,210
because that's the big one.
Antidepressants,

2124
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:57,830
they should we call them happy pills.
You know,

2125
01:43:57,831 --> 01:44:01,370
I wrote an article a long time ago from 
my blog about happy pills.

2126
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:03,980
I called it happy pills and it was about
this,

2127
01:44:03,981 --> 01:44:04,850
uh,
this,

2128
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:05,960
this,
uh,

2129
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,470
this girl who was taking these,
uh,

2130
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:13,550
these antidepressants.
And I think that the selling of 

2131
01:44:14,031 --> 01:44:18,230
happiness in pill form is the ultimate 
ridiculous American notion.

2132
01:44:18,231 --> 01:44:19,880
It's horrible.
It's horrible.

2133
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:20,650
Uh,
it,

2134
01:44:20,660 --> 01:44:21,380
it's,
it's,

2135
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:24,140
it's suggesting that the onset does not 
lie within that,

2136
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:27,200
that it can be bought,
that happiness can be bold.

2137
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:32,440
But I think that the ultimate delusion 
also what's insidious about it is 

2138
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:36,400
selling it on television like that does 
a huge disservice to the actual people 

2139
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,860
that could use antidepressants because 
they have a real mental imbalance.

2140
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,540
Sure,
there's people that do do that.

2141
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:46,750
So like you're selling it as an antidote
for a shit life where there's other 

2142
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:48,890
folks that might have a real issue.

2143
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:53,970
They have an imbalanced huge chemical 
imbalance in the brain and that can be 

2144
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:56,090
adjusted and adjusted and make their 
life wonderful.

2145
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:58,550
People that have a miserable life,
they can make their life wonderful,

2146
01:44:58,790 --> 01:45:03,790
but instead were people will trivialize 
it because you see a commercial or a 

2147
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:07,840
chicken running around a field of wheat 
and spinning around with her baby and 

2148
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,330
then someone says,
I want to live like that.

2149
01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:10,430
And then they called her a fucking 
doctor and next thing you know,

2150
01:45:10,431 --> 01:45:15,431
you're on a pill that you didn't need.
If you just start eating vegetables and 

2151
01:45:15,431 --> 01:45:18,011
going jogging every day,
you'd be way happier person than you 

2152
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:18,011
were on that pill.
And again,

2153
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:18,830
let me,
let me say right,

2154
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:23,390
I outright that the psychedelics are 
very effective antidepressants.

2155
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:28,810
Psilocybin being trial tested in humans,
communities for thousands and thousands 

2156
01:45:29,120 --> 01:45:30,260
of years,
Iowaska and the Amazon,

2157
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,300
at least 4,000
years of use,

2158
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:36,230
and anybody who's worked with psilocybin
or or IOWASCA enough,

2159
01:45:36,231 --> 01:45:39,140
we'll know that,
that they do help with mood,

2160
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:44,200
they do,
they do help you take a more positive 

2161
01:45:44,200 --> 01:45:46,690
outlook on outlook,
on life and and whether that's to do 

2162
01:45:46,690 --> 01:45:50,441
with altering the chemical balance in 
the brain because they do work on the 

2163
01:45:50,441 --> 01:45:54,521
serotonin system in the brain chemically
or whether it's to do with the 

2164
01:45:54,521 --> 01:45:58,631
revelation that one has,
that life is an incredible gift and 

2165
01:45:58,631 --> 01:46:00,290
incredible joy and a privilege to be to 
be alive.

2166
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,030
This is,
this is what we forget,

2167
01:46:02,100 --> 01:46:04,490
immersed in the cares and woes of daily 
life,

2168
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:08,900
constantly struggling to meet the next,
to pay the bills,

2169
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:13,950
to to get on in,
in work would relentlessly driven to 

2170
01:46:13,950 --> 01:46:17,150
produce and consume and we forget that 
it's a magical,

2171
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:19,760
enchanted,
gorgeous,

2172
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:24,790
glorious universe that we live in and we
have this amazing bodies and we should 

2173
01:46:24,790 --> 01:46:26,690
just celebrate every minute of it.
Psychedelics help with that too.

2174
01:46:26,870 --> 01:46:27,980
Yeah,
it's hard.

2175
01:46:27,981 --> 01:46:29,630
It's hard to keep a balanced 
perspective,

2176
01:46:29,631 --> 01:46:34,631
but it's.
I think it's also important to realize 

2177
01:46:34,631 --> 01:46:36,881
that perspective shifting consciousness,
shifting experiences can also change the

2178
01:46:38,811 --> 01:46:41,750
way you look at the world and when you 
change the way you look at the world,

2179
01:46:41,751 --> 01:46:46,340
it can adjust the way your brain 
functions and that it's not an either or

2180
01:46:46,341 --> 01:46:48,620
situation.
It's a Kombucha Tory situation.

2181
01:46:48,621 --> 01:46:53,621
Sure,
they might affect your brain in a very 

2182
01:46:53,621 --> 01:46:56,181
chemical way,
but also just the altering of a 

2183
01:46:56,181 --> 01:46:58,551
perspective could enhance your mood and 
it can enhance the way your body and 

2184
01:46:58,551 --> 01:47:01,710
brain function because the mind is what 
we are.

2185
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:04,110
We are our minds.
The mind is the most powerful,

2186
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:07,170
the most powerful thing,
and that's where all healing,

2187
01:47:07,171 --> 01:47:08,880
I believe resides.
It resides.

2188
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:12,180
It resides in the mind.
If you can kick in the body's ability to

2189
01:47:12,181 --> 01:47:15,600
heal itself through right mental 
attitude,

2190
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:17,790
no,
no medicine will do that for you,

2191
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:20,330
and that's why placebos actually work.
You know?

2192
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:25,580
That's why they worked better than than 
the prescription drugs that had been 

2193
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:25,580
tested.
Again,

2194
01:47:25,580 --> 01:47:26,790
they don't work better than prescription
drugs,

2195
01:47:26,791 --> 01:47:30,060
but occasionally they do do just the 
fact that they work at all.

2196
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,690
The placebo effect is not nearly as 
effective as medicine,

2197
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,100
right,
in most cases,

2198
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:37,620
but just the fact that it does work at 
all,

2199
01:47:37,740 --> 01:47:42,740
that there's a way that you can tell 
your body to make itself better and the 

2200
01:47:42,740 --> 01:47:45,570
way is by tricking it to thinking as 
taking medicine.

2201
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:46,590
Look,
you're going to be better.

2202
01:47:46,620 --> 01:47:51,620
I'm going to be better.
The alleviation of stress and 

2203
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:54,240
anticipation of this horrible demise 
that your impending doom that you can 

2204
01:47:54,511 --> 01:47:57,450
escape with a sugar pill.
That's incredible.

2205
01:47:57,480 --> 01:47:59,850
It's incredible.
It says something about the mind set and

2206
01:47:59,851 --> 01:48:04,851
it's something really worth looking at 
that further that is enhanced in 

2207
01:48:04,851 --> 01:48:08,841
psychedelic experiences.
Perspective enhancing aspects of that I 

2208
01:48:08,841 --> 01:48:10,710
do believe can change your overall 
health or change overall consciousness,

2209
01:48:10,920 --> 01:48:12,500
which can change your overall health.
Yeah.

2210
01:48:12,840 --> 01:48:14,340
Yeah.
There's a lot going on man,

2211
01:48:14,341 --> 01:48:19,341
and I think these conversations are 
super important for people that are 

2212
01:48:19,341 --> 01:48:20,840
uninitiated and that haven't.
They don't understand what the.

2213
01:48:21,010 --> 01:48:26,010
What's the Hoopla about?
Why is everybody got down with that 

2214
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:26,010
Rogan's going on about drugs again,
I know I.

2215
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:30,891
I have.
I have a constituency of my readers and 

2216
01:48:30,891 --> 01:48:35,480
people who follow me on facebook who are
constantly throwing handcuffs or a 

2217
01:48:35,480 --> 01:48:40,000
druggie and pass at me,
and I just feel this is really 

2218
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:40,140
important.

2219
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:44,100
It's a really important conversation to 
have and fundamentally get right down to

2220
01:48:44,101 --> 01:48:48,420
the bottom of what it's about.
It's about this whole issue of us taking

2221
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:53,421
back power over ourselves.
That's what it's really about and the 

2222
01:48:53,421 --> 01:48:55,200
and it needs to be seen in that,
in that context,

2223
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:58,560
to make decisions about our own lives,
right or wrong,

2224
01:48:58,710 --> 01:49:02,250
and to learn from our mistakes and to 
grow and develop as a result.

2225
01:49:02,370 --> 01:49:07,370
I think it's also super important that 
you discussed your relationship with 

2226
01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:10,080
cannabis in an abusive way too,
that there's a balance to be achieved.

2227
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:12,120
There's a balance to be achieved for all
of us.

2228
01:49:12,580 --> 01:49:13,770
Sort of a strange.
That's what.

2229
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:15,960
That's what I've.
That's what I've learned in a way I.

2230
01:49:16,360 --> 01:49:21,360
I had to deny myself this wonderful 
sense you'll plant,

2231
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:26,820
which helped me to enjoy food and music 
and many other essential plays.

2232
01:49:27,170 --> 01:49:28,410
Sax.
Absolutely.

2233
01:49:28,750 --> 01:49:30,740
You've never had socks on pot.
You know what I mean?

2234
01:49:30,741 --> 01:49:35,741
What you're talking about.
I don't even know what led Zepplin 

2235
01:49:35,741 --> 01:49:35,741
sounds like.
Exactly.

2236
01:49:35,741 --> 01:49:37,200
It's a beautiful sense.
You will ally,

2237
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:42,290
and I've had to deny myself.
That sends you an ally for the last 

2238
01:49:42,290 --> 01:49:45,750
three years because I abused it because 
I might spark up a joint right now.

2239
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,840
Want

2240
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:50,500
to dive in right now?
Of course the jail.

2241
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:51,760
You're like,
you're like the,

2242
01:49:52,030 --> 01:49:56,890
the garden of didn't sure you want.
Yes.

2243
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:58,780
You sure?
Why not?

2244
01:49:58,781 --> 01:50:00,230
I don't want to force you into anything.
You're not.

2245
01:50:00,280 --> 01:50:02,170
You're not forcing me.
It's an interesting expand now.

2246
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:02,850
Now.
No,

2247
01:50:02,851 --> 01:50:03,210
no,
no.

2248
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:04,330
Not that.
I'm going to go.

2249
01:50:04,450 --> 01:50:08,080
I'm going to go live on Joe Rogan.
Is that bad?

2250
01:50:08,140 --> 01:50:09,010
No,
that's not bad.

2251
01:50:09,690 --> 01:50:11,200
That's the way to do it.
If you want to dive in,

2252
01:50:11,380 --> 01:50:13,000
we'll go a little baby.
Hit little baby.

2253
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:16,240
Little Baby.
My first baby hit in three years.

2254
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,240
Nothing crazy.
Nobody has to get hurt here.

2255
01:50:19,450 --> 01:50:24,450
Okay.
You were showing some images from 

2256
01:50:24,450 --> 01:50:26,290
Lebanon before the POC.
What have you gotten into?

2257
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:31,380
Well,
not by the time I smoked this little 

2258
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:31,380
baby hit.
I'll,

2259
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:31,850
I'll probably have forgotten.
But um,

2260
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:37,380
so what I was getting into was,
um,

2261
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:40,210
this,
this fella here,

2262
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:41,980
American shit too.

2263
01:50:41,980 --> 01:50:46,980
That's not that crappy getting England 
that's made by American scientists and 

2264
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:50,431
botanists.
They all drive muscle cars and they do 

2265
01:50:50,431 --> 01:50:50,431
steroids.
So familiar.

2266
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:53,710
That's such a nice feeling.
That's,

2267
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,120
that's back.
Can we,

2268
01:50:55,150 --> 01:50:57,890
are we seeing on the screen?
That is.

2269
01:50:58,150 --> 01:51:02,830
You're going in for another baby hit.
She's a little tiny.

2270
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:05,590
That's it.
Stop right there.

2271
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,020
Right you to get confused on the way 
back.

2272
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:09,700
We will see.
So here it is.

2273
01:51:09,790 --> 01:51:11,800
Lebanon.
This is the um,

2274
01:51:11,980 --> 01:51:14,800
this is what is called the stone of the 
pregnant woman.

2275
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,410
Whoa.
I fall back.

2276
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:21,480
That's the level on top of that is me on
top of that can be a power point 

2277
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:22,840
demonstration.
So we see it.

2278
01:51:22,841 --> 01:51:23,800
But this,
this little,

2279
01:51:24,040 --> 01:51:27,730
this little tiny dark up here on top of 
that.

2280
01:51:27,731 --> 01:51:31,810
That's me in Lebanon.
And is this a recent in July?

2281
01:51:31,811 --> 01:51:33,760
Yes.
I was there and I was there in July.

2282
01:51:34,180 --> 01:51:37,750
People say that Lebanon is very 
dangerous and this place is right on the

2283
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:42,751
Syrian border.
But I didn't see any danger there at 

2284
01:51:42,751 --> 01:51:42,751
all.
I had a,

2285
01:51:42,751 --> 01:51:42,880
I had a magical experience in Lebanon.
It was great.

2286
01:51:42,881 --> 01:51:44,440
It was exciting.
It was for you,

2287
01:51:44,441 --> 01:51:47,290
it must be incredible because that's a 
sight of so many ancient,

2288
01:51:47,560 --> 01:51:52,560
huge monolithic structures that are 
unexplained as far as our construction 

2289
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,281
methods are.
So the temple of Jupiter at Baalbek in 

2290
01:51:56,281 --> 01:51:56,530
Temple of Jupiter,
this is what they call it.

2291
01:51:56,560 --> 01:51:58,720
It's a rough.
There's undoubtedly a Roman temple.

2292
01:51:58,721 --> 01:52:03,721
They're okay.
And that Roman temple dates from the 

2293
01:52:03,721 --> 01:52:04,600
known historical periods some two,
300 years after Christ.

2294
01:52:04,930 --> 01:52:07,570
It's the Roman temple of Jupiter and 
it's very extraordinary,

2295
01:52:07,571 --> 01:52:12,571
but it stands on these huge foundations.
There's a group of stones called three 

2296
01:52:13,421 --> 01:52:16,210
stones called the tree lithium,
which are,

2297
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:20,220
um,
each weighing 840 tons,

2298
01:52:20,950 --> 01:52:23,110
840 tons.

2299
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,650
What the fuck?
And they are lifted to 20 feet above the

2300
01:52:26,651 --> 01:52:29,920
ground and built into a wall of sat on 
top of one of those stones.

2301
01:52:29,921 --> 01:52:34,921
I've been done underneath it and looked 
up at it to 840 ton stones.

2302
01:52:35,230 --> 01:52:40,230
This is this gigantic achievement.
Now the Orthodox view is that the Romans

2303
01:52:40,871 --> 01:52:44,920
did everything that they,
they built those foundations and they,

2304
01:52:45,230 --> 01:52:50,230
the temple I think,
and many researchers who have studied 

2305
01:52:50,230 --> 01:52:50,510
them in this field would agree with me 
on this,

2306
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:55,130
that actually the Romans found a much 
more ancient site and they,

2307
01:52:55,160 --> 01:53:00,160
which was just extraordinarily 
megalithic gigantic stones and they 

2308
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,691
built their temple on top of it and 
later historians have simply given the 

2309
01:53:04,691 --> 01:53:06,650
whole thing to the Romans without 
considering,

2310
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,090
uh,
what was,

2311
01:53:08,091 --> 01:53:13,091
what was going on there?
And part of the reason I think that is 

2312
01:53:13,091 --> 01:53:13,091
because of these stones that are still 
in the quarry,

2313
01:53:13,091 --> 01:53:13,670
which I was trying to.

2314
01:53:13,880 --> 01:53:15,350
I don't know if it showed up on the 
screen.

2315
01:53:15,351 --> 01:53:16,290
I was trying.
I got it.

2316
01:53:16,340 --> 01:53:17,390
You got it.
I'm trying to show it,

2317
01:53:17,391 --> 01:53:18,800
you know,
I'm trying to show it just now.

2318
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:21,380
These stones stood in the quarry.
Okay.

2319
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:26,770
Now,
so what the historians say is that the 

2320
01:53:26,770 --> 01:53:26,810
Romans.
Okay.

2321
01:53:26,811 --> 01:53:29,690
They found they could move the 840 ton 
stones.

2322
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,840
That's 1 million.
Six hundred and 80,000

2323
01:53:32,841 --> 01:53:35,450
pounds for people who don't like the 
word ton.

2324
01:53:35,451 --> 01:53:37,260
You've got your calculator going back 
to.

2325
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,890
Because it didn't make sense.
I was trying to double it,

2326
01:53:39,891 --> 01:53:42,620
but it's not double.
It's two pounds,

2327
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:46,210
2000 pounds.
It's a number.

2328
01:53:46,220 --> 01:53:49,650
Whatever it is.
It's just a CSM number is 6,000

2329
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:52,700
pounds for every ton.
So I was going eight to 2000 for each.

2330
01:53:52,730 --> 01:53:54,750
What?
Eight hundred 40 times 2000.

2331
01:53:54,990 --> 01:53:56,660
Is that real?
And then that's where it is.

2332
01:53:56,720 --> 01:53:57,770
That's what it is.
Now a million.

2333
01:53:57,860 --> 01:54:02,860
So here's the thing,
those are the 840 ton blocks in the 

2334
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:02,860
walls in the foundation of the temple.

2335
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:07,840
Then we go to the quarry and we find 
this humongous thing which weighs over 

2336
01:54:07,840 --> 01:54:12,491
1000 tons.
And there's another one on the other 

2337
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:13,790
side of the road which was 1,200
tubs.

2338
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:18,820
One thousand two,
one thousand two hundred thousand to 2 

2339
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:19,220
million.
Four hundred thousand pounds.

2340
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,200
Yeah.
So here's a fuck.

2341
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,490
So here's the theory.
Okay.

2342
01:54:22,670 --> 01:54:26,600
The Romans,
the Romans found they could move the 840

2343
01:54:26,601 --> 01:54:31,601
ton blocks and they did.
This is the orthodox theory and then 

2344
01:54:31,601 --> 01:54:35,741
they built their temple on top of it,
but they found they couldn't move these 

2345
01:54:35,741 --> 01:54:37,910
thousand or 1,200
plus ton blocks,

2346
01:54:37,911 --> 01:54:42,911
and by the way,
this one is completely separated from 

2347
01:54:42,911 --> 01:54:45,341
the bedrock of which has been caught.
They couldn't move them so they left 

2348
01:54:45,341 --> 01:54:49,361
them in the quarry.
I think that actually proves that the 

2349
01:54:49,361 --> 01:54:53,171
Romans didn't create the 840 ton 
megaliths because if the Romans had 

2350
01:54:53,871 --> 01:54:58,010
known that these gigantic blocks in the.
If they had cut the blocks,

2351
01:54:58,011 --> 01:54:59,840
okay,
if they had cut them themselves,

2352
01:54:59,841 --> 01:55:01,850
which we must say they did.

2353
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:05,030
If we are saying that the Romans were 
responsible for these mega list,

2354
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:06,920
if the Romans had cut these blocks 
themselves,

2355
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:11,030
they knew they were there and the very 
first thing they would have used for the

2356
01:55:11,031 --> 01:55:15,920
smaller blocks that they put into place 
in the temple of Jupiter was these large

2357
01:55:15,921 --> 01:55:20,921
blocks.
They would have sliced them up like a 

2358
01:55:20,921 --> 01:55:21,770
loaf of bread into smaller blocks and 
move those over to the temples.

2359
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:26,771
The fact that these huge megaliths still
standing in the quarry suggest to me 

2360
01:55:26,771 --> 01:55:30,641
that they were buried when the Romans 
came to that site because otherwise it 

2361
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:33,911
would have been the very first thing 
they would have used for quarrying 

2362
01:55:33,911 --> 01:55:37,090
smaller blocks that they were buried and
that the Romans found an existing 

2363
01:55:37,090 --> 01:55:40,610
prehistoric megalithic platform.
And on top of it they built their temple

2364
01:55:40,611 --> 01:55:42,920
of Jupiter.
That's fascinating theory.

2365
01:55:42,990 --> 01:55:44,700
Um,
it's,

2366
01:55:44,850 --> 01:55:47,010
it seems like open to interpretation to 
me.

2367
01:55:47,070 --> 01:55:48,590
Sure.
Absolutely.

2368
01:55:48,760 --> 01:55:50,370
Yeah.
Because you're looking at.

2369
01:55:50,820 --> 01:55:51,840
But we'll either,
you know,

2370
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:55,230
regardless of why they built the one.
What is it?

2371
01:55:55,231 --> 01:55:56,760
1,000,000?
Jesus Christ.

2372
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:58,710
2 million.
400,000.

2373
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:00,960
It freaky when you done in pounds.
That's insane.

2374
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:02,430
Yeah.
When you do it in tons,

2375
01:56:02,460 --> 01:56:04,770
it's abstract.
Twelve hundred tons.

2376
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:05,670
Okay.
What does that mean?

2377
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:07,390
You know,
it's hard for my head.

2378
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:08,280
Well,
let's consider,

2379
01:56:08,580 --> 01:56:10,620
bless.
Consider an average vehicle which might.

2380
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:11,190
Wait,
let's,

2381
01:56:11,191 --> 01:56:13,890
let's push in pounds.
So it's about two tons,

2382
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:18,891
right?
Is that about the weight of an average 

2383
01:56:18,891 --> 01:56:18,891
vehicle?
So two tons divide a thousand by that.

2384
01:56:18,891 --> 01:56:22,290
So you're looking at 500 family sized 
cars under a thousand,

2385
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,900
10,000
tons.

2386
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:30,410
Oh my God,
it's just the imagining a 2 million 

2387
01:56:30,410 --> 01:56:35,121
pound rock and a bunch of dudes are 
moving it and we know that someone at 

2388
01:56:35,121 --> 01:56:39,810
some time in history they built that.
They moved those stones.

2389
01:56:39,870 --> 01:56:41,190
I mean it wasn't that one,
right?

2390
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:42,210
It wasn't.
It was.

2391
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,010
What was the first calculation that we 
had?

2392
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:49,310
What did we say?
It was 640 times is that there's three 

2393
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:49,310
blocks of 800,
84.

2394
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:52,110
I joined so closely that you can't slip 
a sheet of paper between them.

2395
01:56:52,111 --> 01:56:54,060
I mean they've not been just roughly 
leave it into place.

2396
01:56:54,061 --> 01:56:57,540
They'd been set down with perfect with 
perfect precision.

2397
01:56:58,400 --> 01:56:59,710
So someone did that.
We know that.

2398
01:56:59,711 --> 01:57:04,711
What did that?
And there are plenty of people arguing 

2399
01:57:04,711 --> 01:57:07,071
that the Romans did it.
I feel along along with other 

2400
01:57:07,071 --> 01:57:10,281
researchers have approached this a bit.
I feel I want to look at alternative 

2401
01:57:10,281 --> 01:57:13,371
possibilities for,
for what these mega lists are all about 

2402
01:57:13,371 --> 01:57:15,891
and that's.
And that's one of the things I'd been 

2403
01:57:15,891 --> 01:57:15,891
doing for the last year,
is traveling around the world looking.

2404
01:57:16,410 --> 01:57:21,030
I feel so lucky to have the opportunity 
to do this and just amazing,

2405
01:57:21,570 --> 01:57:26,570
amazing archeological sites and one of 
the countries that I visited and I want 

2406
01:57:27,010 --> 01:57:30,810
to really mention this is Armenia,
um,

2407
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:35,340
where I have seen incredible stone 
circles,

2408
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:40,400
just wonderful dwarfs stonehenge make,
make us just standing all and look at 

2409
01:57:43,741 --> 01:57:48,741
the way that these huge megalithic 
stones in what is called the moonstone 

2410
01:57:48,741 --> 01:57:48,741
circle.

2411
01:57:48,741 --> 01:57:51,810
They have certain holes drilled in them 
to align up with particular areas of the

2412
01:57:51,811 --> 01:57:56,811
sky at an Armenian Akio.
Astronomer from that kind of data 

2413
01:57:57,421 --> 01:57:59,430
believes that the place called 
[inaudible],

2414
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:02,610
not just two or 3000 years old,
as most historians believe,

2415
01:58:02,611 --> 01:58:04,350
but well over 12,000
years old.

2416
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:09,380
Why did you believe that?
Because of the astronomical alignments 

2417
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:12,360
that the positions of the stars in the 
sky change very slowly down the ages.

2418
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:17,720
That the alignment to the solstices 
changes because there's a slow nod on 

2419
01:58:18,001 --> 01:58:19,350
the axis of the earth,
very,

2420
01:58:19,351 --> 01:58:21,450
very slow over tens of thousands of 
years.

2421
01:58:21,690 --> 01:58:26,690
Which means that if the sun rises at a 
certain point on the horizon,

2422
01:58:27,330 --> 01:58:31,470
on the summer solstice today in two or 
three or 5,000

2423
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:36,471
years' time,
that point on the horizon will have 

2424
01:58:36,471 --> 01:58:36,471
changed.
You wouldn't notice it in a lifetime.

2425
01:58:36,471 --> 01:58:38,970
You wouldn't notice it in 10 lifetimes,
but if you stay long enough,

2426
01:58:38,971 --> 01:58:43,971
you'll note that actually the sun isn't 
rising in the place on the horizon 

2427
01:58:43,971 --> 01:58:43,971
anymore.

2428
01:58:43,971 --> 01:58:47,700
When did we?
That's called the procession of the 

2429
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:47,700
equinox.
Well,

2430
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:47,700
actually no,
that's the second.

2431
01:58:47,700 --> 01:58:48,250
That's the second.
That's a difference.

2432
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:52,240
That's the changing tilt of the Earth's 
axis,

2433
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:57,690
which which kind of is a wobble and nods
back if there's a wobble and there's a 

2434
01:58:57,690 --> 01:58:59,890
tilt and then there's actually a tilt 
within the tilt.

2435
01:58:59,950 --> 01:59:00,430
No,
well,

2436
01:59:00,431 --> 01:59:01,100
yeah.
This is the.

2437
01:59:01,101 --> 01:59:06,101
This is the view,
but the effect is because the earth is 

2438
01:59:06,101 --> 01:59:09,241
the viewing platform from which we 
observed the stars in which we observed 

2439
01:59:09,241 --> 01:59:09,280
the other celestial bodies such as the 
moon and the sun.

2440
01:59:09,730 --> 01:59:14,730
The earth is our viewing platform.
If you change the orientation in space 

2441
01:59:14,730 --> 01:59:17,470
of that viewing platform,
then the rising points of stars,

2442
01:59:17,530 --> 01:59:18,820
the moon,
the sun change,

2443
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:23,880
and the positions of the stars in the 
sky change and it becomes a kind of 

2444
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:25,300
language.
Once you understand this,

2445
01:59:25,301 --> 01:59:28,690
that it is universally available to us,
the calculations can be done.

2446
01:59:28,690 --> 01:59:33,690
We can do it.
Anybody can buy a computer software 

2447
01:59:33,690 --> 01:59:36,241
today which will show you the ancient 
skies over at any point on the earth's 

2448
01:59:36,241 --> 01:59:37,270
surface at anytime in the last 30,000
years.

2449
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:42,300
That's amazing.
These and what's involved in those 

2450
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:45,781
computer simulations is simply 
calculations that had been done in 

2451
01:59:45,781 --> 01:59:46,330
previous centuries by it,
by astronomers,

2452
01:59:46,331 --> 01:59:48,310
and we understand these,
these processes.

2453
01:59:48,311 --> 01:59:53,311
We can measure them and set them up,
but there you have a regularity of 

2454
01:59:53,311 --> 01:59:57,001
changing patterns in the sky.
If you tie that into architecture on the

2455
01:59:57,461 --> 02:00:00,040
ground,
then actually you have a way free of all

2456
02:00:00,041 --> 02:00:01,960
language,
of dating,

2457
02:00:02,110 --> 02:00:07,110
of actually speaking.
You can use this universal language of 

2458
02:00:07,110 --> 02:00:08,380
the stars and architecture to make a 
statement to the future.

2459
02:00:08,381 --> 02:00:12,880
You can say that this particular time 
was very important to me,

2460
02:00:12,940 --> 02:00:15,040
to our culture.
It mattered to us,

2461
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:19,660
it mattered to us so much that we've 
created this huge monument to freeze the

2462
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:21,190
skies over a particular point.

2463
02:00:21,190 --> 02:00:24,340
I wonder why those particular 
constellations,

2464
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:26,170
if at all,
were important to them.

2465
02:00:26,230 --> 02:00:31,230
That's where things get really strange 
and if I wanted to play devil's 

2466
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:31,230
advocate,
I would say,

2467
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:31,330
well,
these holes,

2468
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:36,390
they're pointing up towards the sky.
Here's a lot of fucking stars on the 

2469
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:36,390
show.
How do we know?

2470
02:00:36,390 --> 02:00:39,700
Just because they line up with this and 
a thousand years ago,

2471
02:00:39,701 --> 02:00:42,220
it doesn't mean you weren't looking.
It's very complicated.

2472
02:00:42,221 --> 02:00:47,221
So what you want is multiple locks.
I mean take the pyramids of Giza and 

2473
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:51,400
here I cite the work of my close friend 
and colleague,

2474
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:54,790
Robert Robert Duvall in particular in 
his book,

2475
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:56,230
the Orion mystery.
You,

2476
02:00:56,360 --> 02:01:01,360
you take the three great pyramids of 
Giza and you look at the heavens 

2477
02:01:01,930 --> 02:01:06,930
overhead and you also look at the 
religious system of the ancient 

2478
02:01:07,451 --> 02:01:09,130
Egyptians.
What was important to them?

2479
02:01:09,131 --> 02:01:10,300
What did they.
What did they believe?

2480
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:13,120
You pretty soon discovered that stars 
were incredibly important to them.

2481
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:16,640
Stars cover the inside of the ceilings 
of,

2482
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:19,870
of all tombs,
of the pharaohs tombs,

2483
02:01:19,871 --> 02:01:20,920
for,
for example,

2484
02:01:21,110 --> 02:01:25,750
a monuments are lined up to particular 
places on the horizon.

2485
02:01:25,751 --> 02:01:30,751
Whereas star,
perhaps it's serious who's counterpart 

2486
02:01:30,751 --> 02:01:34,021
amongst the gods was the goddess Isis.
Perhaps it's a Ryan who's counterpart 

2487
02:01:34,021 --> 02:01:34,780
amongst the gods who was the goddess 
Cyrus.

2488
02:01:35,230 --> 02:01:36,030
Uh,
this is the thing.

2489
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:38,590
You have a mythology that speaks of 
entities who have,

2490
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:42,510
who are clearly stated to be connected 
to particular asterisks,

2491
02:01:42,530 --> 02:01:44,570
particular,
particular constellations.

2492
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:49,870
That's the first thing.
Are The constellations that are being 

2493
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:49,870
said to have a reflection upon the 
ground and architecture,

2494
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:51,860
were they significant to the culture 
concerned?

2495
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:52,880
Well,
yes,

2496
02:01:53,630 --> 02:01:58,630
absolutely.
The constellation of Orion was of 

2497
02:01:58,630 --> 02:01:58,700
enormous significance to the ancient 
Egyptians.

2498
02:01:58,701 --> 02:02:03,701
Therefore,
it has to be a matter of interest that 

2499
02:02:03,701 --> 02:02:04,790
the three pyramids on the ground are 
laid out in a pattern that is temptingly

2500
02:02:04,791 --> 02:02:07,300
similar to the pattern of the three 
belts,

2501
02:02:07,301 --> 02:02:08,870
stars of the Constellation of Orion.

2502
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,900
That's fascinating.
Temptingly similar,

2503
02:02:12,410 --> 02:02:17,410
but there's something else.
Then you have shafts which run through 

2504
02:02:17,410 --> 02:02:21,581
the body of the Great Pyramid you have.
There's a place called the king's 

2505
02:02:21,581 --> 02:02:25,121
chamber high up in the Great Pyramid.
It has a shaft and it's north and south 

2506
02:02:25,121 --> 02:02:28,211
wall,
which are about eight inches high and 

2507
02:02:28,211 --> 02:02:28,460
eight inches wide,
and those shafts cut all the way through

2508
02:02:28,461 --> 02:02:33,461
the body of the pyramid and they come 
out on the south and north sides of the 

2509
02:02:33,461 --> 02:02:33,461
pyramid.
You can actually,

2510
02:02:33,461 --> 02:02:35,450
and it's been done in the past,
you can drop a cannonball in,

2511
02:02:35,451 --> 02:02:40,451
at the outside entrance to those shafts 
and they appear and that cannonball 

2512
02:02:40,451 --> 02:02:40,451
moments later will appear in the king's 
chamber,

2513
02:02:40,451 --> 02:02:42,830
the shelter about 200 feet long.
Okay.

2514
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:46,220
In the Queens Chamber down below,
there are also two shafts.

2515
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:51,580
Uh,
these shafts do not exit on the outside 

2516
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:51,650
of the pyramid,
which creates a mystery of its own,

2517
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:52,760
of great interest.

2518
02:02:52,820 --> 02:02:54,200
What is it?
The other end of those shots,

2519
02:02:54,201 --> 02:02:56,420
but they do have very definite 
alignments.

2520
02:02:56,870 --> 02:03:01,430
And what Robert was really the first to 
show some archeo astronomers were,

2521
02:03:01,431 --> 02:03:03,620
we're onto this as well in the case of 
some of the stars,

2522
02:03:03,621 --> 02:03:06,710
but what Robert was really the first to 
show is that in 2,500

2523
02:03:06,711 --> 02:03:09,860
BC,
the epoch in which Egyptologists say the

2524
02:03:09,861 --> 02:03:14,861
pyramids were built,
all of those foreshafts that shoot up 

2525
02:03:14,861 --> 02:03:19,090
out of the king's chamber and the Queen 
Chamber all targeted very significant 

2526
02:03:19,090 --> 02:03:21,830
stars in the sky at that time.
Like for example,

2527
02:03:21,831 --> 02:03:26,831
the southern shaft of the Queens Chamber
targeted the star Sirius at exactly the 

2528
02:03:26,831 --> 02:03:28,580
moment that the star crosses the 
Meridian.

2529
02:03:28,610 --> 02:03:33,610
That's the north south line that divides
the sky above our heads at exactly the 

2530
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:37,070
moment that the star crosses that line.
The shaft targets it and you could,

2531
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:39,080
you could fire a laser beam up and you'd
hit that.

2532
02:03:39,190 --> 02:03:40,820
In theory,
you'd hit that,

2533
02:03:40,821 --> 02:03:41,380
start the,
the,

2534
02:03:41,381 --> 02:03:42,470
the,
the alignment is that great.

2535
02:03:42,471 --> 02:03:46,430
So they locking the pyramid in in the 
epoch of 2,500

2536
02:03:46,431 --> 02:03:50,000
BC,
two four significant stars in the sky.

2537
02:03:50,001 --> 02:03:52,760
Another one of those stars is the lowest
star of the belt of Orion.

2538
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:59,200
That tells us that this is a dating 
mechanism of some kind and it it can't 

2539
02:03:59,961 --> 02:04:03,260
be an accident that that's the case and 
once you understand procession,

2540
02:04:03,261 --> 02:04:04,790
you understand that these alignments 
will change,

2541
02:04:04,791 --> 02:04:09,791
so therefore it becomes very interesting
to discover that the orientation of the 

2542
02:04:09,791 --> 02:04:13,811
pyramids on the ground is that which 
Robert argues are the terrestrial 

2543
02:04:14,931 --> 02:04:17,300
reflection of the three stars of the 
belt of Orion,

2544
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:22,540
that the orientation of the pyramids on 
the ground because of procession shifts 

2545
02:04:22,540 --> 02:04:23,840
very slowly down the ages.
And if you,

2546
02:04:23,841 --> 02:04:28,841
and you can see this clearly on any good
sky map program as you go back in time,

2547
02:04:29,121 --> 02:04:32,780
you find that the constellation of Orion
at the moment it crosses the Meridian.

2548
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,240
The same place that was targeting the 
star Sirius at the moment.

2549
02:04:35,241 --> 02:04:40,241
It crosses the Meridian.
That the perfect alignment between the 

2550
02:04:40,241 --> 02:04:43,110
belt stars for Ryan and the three Great 
Pyramids of Giza is not in 2,500

2551
02:04:43,111 --> 02:04:44,820
BC,
but in 10,500

2552
02:04:44,821 --> 02:04:45,720
BC,
8,000

2553
02:04:45,721 --> 02:04:50,721
years earlier.
So we have a very interesting problem 

2554
02:04:50,721 --> 02:04:54,111
here.
Either it's all coincidence or the 

2555
02:04:54,111 --> 02:04:55,590
pyramids are monuments that speak both 
to the age of the ancient Egyptians,

2556
02:04:55,620 --> 02:04:58,110
2,500
BC and to a much earlier time,

2557
02:04:58,530 --> 02:05:03,530
wasn't it?
Also the same time where the Sphinx was 

2558
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:03,530
pointing towards the Constellation Leo?
Well,

2559
02:05:03,530 --> 02:05:05,130
that's the again,
the third part of the lock,

2560
02:05:05,131 --> 02:05:10,131
and Robert and I looked at this in depth
together in our book called the message 

2561
02:05:10,131 --> 02:05:12,300
of the Sphinx,
and so we have the Giza plateau.

2562
02:05:12,301 --> 02:05:15,840
We have the three pyramids laid out on 
the ground in the pattern of the belt of

2563
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:17,940
Orion in 10,500
BC.

2564
02:05:18,480 --> 02:05:20,940
That's looking south.
Now let's look east.

2565
02:05:21,060 --> 02:05:23,840
Let's look Julie's east east of course,
where the sunrises,

2566
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,880
but people who don't observe the sun 
don't realize that the sun tracks back 

2567
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:32,241
and forth along the horizon during the 
solar year reaches its most northern 

2568
02:05:32,241 --> 02:05:33,540
most point on the summer solstice 21st 
of June,

2569
02:05:33,541 --> 02:05:36,960
and it's southern most point on the 
winter solstice 20,

2570
02:05:36,990 --> 02:05:39,240
20,
first of December.

2571
02:05:40,410 --> 02:05:45,410
On the equinox.
The day that night and day are of equal 

2572
02:05:45,410 --> 02:05:47,130
length.
The sunrises directly,

2573
02:05:47,131 --> 02:05:52,131
perfectly due east.
That's actually how you define an 

2574
02:05:52,131 --> 02:05:54,831
equinox because the sun is rising 
perfectly Jewish and looking at it is 

2575
02:05:54,831 --> 02:05:59,271
the sphinx aligned gazing directly 
perfectly at the point of sunrise.

2576
02:06:01,500 --> 02:06:04,410
Now we have to consider what's behind 
the sun.

2577
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:09,530
Then what is the constellation of the 
Zodiac that the sun is rising in because

2578
02:06:10,471 --> 02:06:12,370
that's what the Zodiac is.
It's A.

2579
02:06:12,370 --> 02:06:17,370
It's a group of constellations that by 
chance that the son passes through 

2580
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:22,160
during the course of the year,
but that the constellation that the sun 

2581
02:06:22,160 --> 02:06:23,640
rises against,
the background of it is also affected by

2582
02:06:23,641 --> 02:06:25,950
precession,
the wobble on the axis of the earth,

2583
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:27,690
and that changes.

2584
02:06:28,290 --> 02:06:33,290
You have roughly 2,160
years in each house of the Zodiac for 

2585
02:06:33,290 --> 02:06:34,020
the last 2000,
160 years.

2586
02:06:34,021 --> 02:06:39,021
We've been in Pisces and as I often say,
it's not an accident that the the early 

2587
02:06:39,021 --> 02:06:43,881
Christians use the fish as their symbol.
Before that it was the constellation of 

2588
02:06:43,881 --> 02:06:48,230
areas.
The Ram Ram's were incredibly important 

2589
02:06:48,230 --> 02:06:49,200
in the year from 2000 down to the time 
of Christ.

2590
02:06:49,230 --> 02:06:51,630
Just look at the biblical stories.
Anyway,

2591
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:54,710
to cut a long story short,
the Great Sphinx is a lion,

2592
02:06:55,350 --> 02:07:00,350
admittedly with a human head,
but that head is rather small and we 

2593
02:07:00,350 --> 02:07:02,070
think that the head almost certainly was
recovered in a later time.

2594
02:07:02,160 --> 02:07:07,160
Probably the whole statute was 
originally Elian crouching there on the 

2595
02:07:07,160 --> 02:07:11,830
horizon,
gazing Julie East at the rising sun on 

2596
02:07:11,830 --> 02:07:12,900
the equinox and at the Constellation 
pint the sun,

2597
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:16,740
and that constellation is in 10,500
BC,

2598
02:07:16,830 --> 02:07:21,830
the constellation of Leo as above.
So below Leo speaking to the Sphinx,

2599
02:07:22,540 --> 02:07:24,270
uh,
Ryan speaking to the pyramids,

2600
02:07:24,390 --> 02:07:28,500
locking in to a date that is far before 
any civilization began.

2601
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,660
And I,
I know I'm on a long wrap here,

2602
02:07:31,410 --> 02:07:32,520
but just at that,
at,

2603
02:07:32,640 --> 02:07:33,030
at,
at,

2604
02:07:33,180 --> 02:07:35,500
at that point when the egyptologist 
well,

2605
02:07:35,501 --> 02:07:40,501
it's impossible for there to be any 
thing like a civilization at Giza 12 and

2606
02:07:40,691 --> 02:07:45,691
a half thousand years ago.
Just when they're very happy saying 

2607
02:07:45,691 --> 02:07:48,001
that,
and they're telling us that no other 

2608
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:48,001
monument can be found anywhere in the 
world,

2609
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:48,430
which is 12 and a half thousand years 
old on this scale.

2610
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:53,110
Lo and behold,
up pops go directly to Epi in Turkey.

2611
02:07:53,590 --> 02:07:58,590
Go back to in the area of Turkey that by
the way was once historic Armenia go,

2612
02:07:58,930 --> 02:08:03,930
Beckley tempe pops up.
It's dated by the German archeological 

2613
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:07,621
institute.
They discovered that this huge complex 

2614
02:08:07,621 --> 02:08:08,800
of stone circles has been deliberately 
buried 10,000

2615
02:08:08,801 --> 02:08:11,800
years ago and the carbon dating,
because you can't date stones,

2616
02:08:11,801 --> 02:08:16,801
you have to date organic materials.
The carbon dating of organic materials 

2617
02:08:16,801 --> 02:08:20,011
found with those stone circles puts 
their age back to 12,000

2618
02:08:20,831 --> 02:08:21,040
years.

2619
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,020
I'm more for you.
That must have been like Christmas.

2620
02:08:23,050 --> 02:08:25,080
It was Christmas.
It was Christmas.

2621
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:26,770
It was like.
It was like a gift.

2622
02:08:26,780 --> 02:08:27,190
I,
I,

2623
02:08:27,191 --> 02:08:28,070
you know,
I don't,

2624
02:08:28,071 --> 02:08:31,090
I don't want to.
I have to confess.

2625
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:32,080
I mean,
we all have egos.

2626
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,670
Of course.
I have to confess that,

2627
02:08:33,850 --> 02:08:38,850
that it was a nice moment for me when 
the New Scientist magazine in Britain,

2628
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:45,360
which years ago,
back in the nineties when I published 

2629
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:47,761
fingerprints of the gods,
was amongst the magazines that tact my 

2630
02:08:47,761 --> 02:08:48,980
work as quote unquote pseudoscientific 
and all of the.

2631
02:08:48,981 --> 02:08:51,310
I don't know how my work can be pseudo 
scientific because I don't claim to be a

2632
02:08:51,311 --> 02:08:53,050
scientist.
I'm a fucking journalist.

2633
02:08:53,051 --> 02:08:53,650
You know?
I'm not,

2634
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,870
I'm not a scientist,
how can I be a pseudo scientists,

2635
02:08:55,871 --> 02:08:58,030
but here's a guy who's got an obsessed 
with an idea.

2636
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:00,850
I kind of,
and I'm a little weed,

2637
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:05,851
like that's actually New Scientist 
magazine back in the 19 nineties was 

2638
02:09:10,301 --> 02:09:15,301
saying that I was wrong,
where the basic message of fingerprints 

2639
02:09:15,301 --> 02:09:17,761
of the gods is history as much older and
much more mysterious than we'd been 

2640
02:09:17,761 --> 02:09:20,851
told,
so it was great in October 2013 when 

2641
02:09:20,851 --> 02:09:20,851
you.

2642
02:09:20,851 --> 02:09:23,940
This magazine came out with a headline 
saying history is much older and more 

2643
02:09:23,940 --> 02:09:24,040
mysterious than we thought.
It's funny.

2644
02:09:24,170 --> 02:09:29,170
The Hancock was right.
Title showed up in my next.

2645
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:34,601
Sorry Dude.
In my next life we were fucking with 

2646
02:09:34,601 --> 02:09:34,601
you,
but there was,

2647
02:09:34,601 --> 02:09:36,850
there was happy and that's what changes 
everything.

2648
02:09:37,160 --> 02:09:38,030
Yeah,
they're really done.

2649
02:09:38,220 --> 02:09:43,220
By the way.
I'll just say I guess we may be running 

2650
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:43,220
out of time,
but I'll just say,

2651
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:43,960
are we good?
I just say also Indonesia,

2652
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:49,320
which is the other place that my wife 
Santha and I've done a lot of research 

2653
02:09:49,320 --> 02:09:52,840
in the last six or seven months,
has been found.

2654
02:09:53,080 --> 02:09:58,080
What was thought to be a 2,500
year old site on top of the hill.

2655
02:09:59,500 --> 02:10:02,680
I'm a site made of blocks of columnar 
basalt,

2656
02:10:02,710 --> 02:10:06,010
which forms naturally but which can be 
used as a construction medium.

2657
02:10:06,520 --> 02:10:09,280
Okay.
It's called Gunung Padang.

2658
02:10:09,670 --> 02:10:14,670
And on the top of the hill in a series 
of terraces is a rather extraordinary 

2659
02:10:14,670 --> 02:10:15,550
monument,
thought to be about 2,500

2660
02:10:15,551 --> 02:10:20,551
years old,
made of these blocks of columnar 

2661
02:10:20,551 --> 02:10:20,551
battled.

2662
02:10:20,551 --> 02:10:23,080
Um,
no really thorough research has ever 

2663
02:10:23,080 --> 02:10:25,471
done by archeologists.
A little bit of trenching down to about 

2664
02:10:25,471 --> 02:10:28,170
half of half a meter in depth was done 
and some carbon was brought up and 

2665
02:10:28,170 --> 02:10:28,570
dated,
but really the site,

2666
02:10:28,571 --> 02:10:33,571
it was just kind of taken for granted 
that it was two and a half thousand 

2667
02:10:33,571 --> 02:10:34,540
years old.
Along comes Danny Natoya ggn,

2668
02:10:34,820 --> 02:10:39,820
who is a caltech trained phd geologist,
a working out of the city of Bandung in 

2669
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,310
a government agency of the Indonesian 
government.

2670
02:10:43,350 --> 02:10:45,590
In fact,
he particularly focuses on earthquakes.

2671
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:47,200
Earthquakes are his thing.
Um,

2672
02:10:47,630 --> 02:10:51,290
he comes along and he's intrigued by 
Gunung Padang first of all,

2673
02:10:51,291 --> 02:10:54,020
that there's old traditions about it 
being a sacred place.

2674
02:10:54,420 --> 02:10:56,000
It's go back at,
it seemed to go back a very,

2675
02:10:56,001 --> 02:11:01,001
very,
very long way and he starts to look at 

2676
02:11:01,001 --> 02:11:01,430
it as a geologist and what he realized 
is suddenly it comes to him.

2677
02:11:01,550 --> 02:11:03,200
He's not looking at a natural hill.

2678
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:08,560
He's looking at a pyramid on top of 
which is this relatively recent 

2679
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:10,040
monument,
but somebody built a pyramid there,

2680
02:11:10,160 --> 02:11:12,890
so he begins work on this,
so it's covered in dirt.

2681
02:11:13,140 --> 02:11:15,800
It looks like a grown,
but it's inside.

2682
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:17,180
It's a.
it's a manmade structure.

2683
02:11:17,570 --> 02:11:19,430
That was Danny's intuition,
but then he had to prove it,

2684
02:11:19,431 --> 02:11:24,431
so he put together a team and they did a
huge amount of remote sensing work and 

2685
02:11:24,431 --> 02:11:28,340
some core drilling down to depths of 
about 15 meters into the top of the hill

2686
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:34,240
and what they.
What they discovered was incredibly 

2687
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:34,240
tempting it,
it supports Dan,

2688
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:36,230
his intuition that we are looking at a 
manmade pyramid here.

2689
02:11:36,710 --> 02:11:40,700
It has produces dates that go back as 
much as 26,000

2690
02:11:40,701 --> 02:11:45,701
years right into the last ice age and 
the remote sensing equipment shows 

2691
02:11:46,160 --> 02:11:49,700
rather regular cavities inside the 
monument,

2692
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:53,210
which looked like chambers of some kind.
Well,

2693
02:11:53,211 --> 02:11:58,211
naturally Danny and his team were 
stopped working for quite a long while 

2694
02:11:58,211 --> 02:11:59,930
by the archeological establishment in 
Indonesia who said,

2695
02:11:59,931 --> 02:12:04,931
we know that this structure is two and a
half thousand years old and there's no 

2696
02:12:04,931 --> 02:12:08,051
need for any further research on it and 
it just disturbs the local villages and 

2697
02:12:08,051 --> 02:12:08,051
um,
uh,

2698
02:12:08,051 --> 02:12:08,290
you know,
go away.

2699
02:12:08,290 --> 02:12:10,220
And so they lobbied and they had him 
stopped.

2700
02:12:10,570 --> 02:12:12,560
Uh,
but donny took it to the highest level.

2701
02:12:12,620 --> 02:12:17,620
He got the support of the Indonesian 
government and two and a half weeks ago 

2702
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:19,940
they started work excavating,
thoroughly excavating.

2703
02:12:21,050 --> 02:12:25,920
And so far the results look very 
interesting to see a building 26,000,

2704
02:12:25,980 --> 02:12:27,650
26,000
years old.

2705
02:12:27,680 --> 02:12:28,850
And again,
you know,

2706
02:12:28,851 --> 02:12:31,280
we can't,
I can't summon up a map magically,

2707
02:12:31,281 --> 02:12:33,260
but if I were to do so,
consider Indonesia,

2708
02:12:33,261 --> 02:12:38,261
which is a long string of islands today.
But if you go back 12 and a half 

2709
02:12:38,571 --> 02:12:40,510
thousand years ago,
that long strip of art,

2710
02:12:40,540 --> 02:12:43,430
string of islands is joined to a 
gigantic mainland,

2711
02:12:43,670 --> 02:12:44,900
huge,
you know,

2712
02:12:45,080 --> 02:12:48,260
ice age continent because sea level is 
hundreds of feet lower.

2713
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:53,710
And therefore,
Indonesia becomes actually quite a 

2714
02:12:53,710 --> 02:12:54,290
plausible play place for some sort of 
whole of records,

2715
02:12:54,291 --> 02:12:59,010
some sort of time capsule because 
Rebecca is also a time capsule that's so

2716
02:12:59,120 --> 02:13:00,770
absolutely incredible.

2717
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,590
I can't say fascinating anymore because 
people started giving me shit about it.

2718
02:13:04,290 --> 02:13:09,290
Last few podcasts I see.
I don't know when things are 

2719
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:09,290
fascinating.
I would camp come up with any.

2720
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:09,860
You know me.
It was my way of going,

2721
02:13:09,861 --> 02:13:14,861
whoa.
There's interesting stuff happening 

2722
02:13:14,861 --> 02:13:17,711
happening in the world.
I've been lucky to spend some time 

2723
02:13:17,711 --> 02:13:20,920
exploring this.
I am writing a sequel to my best known 

2724
02:13:20,920 --> 02:13:20,920
book and undoubtedly his fingerprints of
the gods,

2725
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:23,510
the evidence for earth lost 
civilization.

2726
02:13:23,720 --> 02:13:26,720
There was that 1995,
1995,

2727
02:13:26,721 --> 02:13:31,721
and now you know,
after being scorned and put down by the 

2728
02:13:31,721 --> 02:13:36,471
archeological establishment,
there is enough new evidence out there 

2729
02:13:36,471 --> 02:13:38,340
for me to produce a whole other book.
There's a whole other story to tell.

2730
02:13:38,341 --> 02:13:43,341
Not An update of fingerprints of the 
gods would with a new book which looks 

2731
02:13:43,341 --> 02:13:43,770
at all of this information.
What's going on in Stonehenge?

2732
02:13:43,830 --> 02:13:48,830
This most recent monuments,
they discovered bigger than the rest of 

2733
02:13:48,830 --> 02:13:49,500
Stonehenge stonehedge.

2734
02:13:49,510 --> 02:13:50,250
They.
That's the thing,

2735
02:13:50,251 --> 02:13:55,251
you see this why archeologist need to be
a little more humble because the next 

2736
02:13:55,251 --> 02:13:56,970
turn of the spade can change everything 
completely alter the story and we should

2737
02:13:56,971 --> 02:14:01,860
always remain,
remain open to just a one discovery like

2738
02:14:01,861 --> 02:14:04,950
that one farmer finding this stone and 
go back with on earth.

2739
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:08,850
This incredible structure that rewrites 
history literally turn to the space.

2740
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:12,840
That piece of stone is seen by American 
archeologists in the 19 fifties really,

2741
02:14:12,930 --> 02:14:17,930
and they decide not to look at it 
because it's so finely done that they 

2742
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:20,850
think it belongs to the Ottoman period 
within the last four or 500 years.

2743
02:14:21,720 --> 02:14:23,910
Actually it turns out to be 12,000
years old.

2744
02:14:23,950 --> 02:14:25,380
What's good that they didn't fuck with 
it?

2745
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:33,280
It's cool that it happens this way.
Got The German archeological institute 

2746
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:36,981
later.
Unfortunately they've stuck a hideous 

2747
02:14:36,981 --> 02:14:36,981
roof over the top of the top.
Now they have.

2748
02:14:36,981 --> 02:14:41,060
Oh,
it's trying to keep it from decaying or 

2749
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:41,060
something.
Look,

2750
02:14:41,060 --> 02:14:41,160
it was 19 years.
It was exposed to.

2751
02:14:41,161 --> 02:14:43,190
The Sun was out there.
It was being.

2752
02:14:43,240 --> 02:14:46,860
They began the excavations in 1996 and 
it's fine.

2753
02:14:47,130 --> 02:14:52,130
Fine,
and now that they finished the 

2754
02:14:52,130 --> 02:14:54,051
excavations,
they decided that in that particular 

2755
02:14:54,051 --> 02:14:54,051
area,
they're excavating other areas,

2756
02:14:54,051 --> 02:14:55,560
they decide to stick this horrendous 
roof over it,

2757
02:14:56,460 --> 02:15:01,460
which cuts out the light,
makes it impossible to see the stump is 

2758
02:15:01,460 --> 02:15:04,610
the roof is badly built,
so it there are platforms built inside 

2759
02:15:04,610 --> 02:15:05,190
it on which huge heaps of stones have 
been part of.

2760
02:15:05,220 --> 02:15:08,040
That's to keep the roof on if there's 
any high winds,

2761
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:12,150
so suddenly so suddenly the possibility 
of any kind of magical experience at the

2762
02:15:12,151 --> 02:15:17,151
world's most intriguing and mysterious 
ancient site is completely written off 

2763
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:20,070
by this hideous piece of soco protective
architecture,

2764
02:15:20,071 --> 02:15:22,800
which in my view is just the worst kind 
of vandalism.

2765
02:15:22,830 --> 02:15:25,050
I've really offended by it.
I went back to.

2766
02:15:25,051 --> 02:15:30,051
I was in Tibet in 2013.
I went back again this year and I am.

2767
02:15:30,270 --> 02:15:35,270
I was just horrified.
It made me feel physically sick to see 

2768
02:15:35,270 --> 02:15:35,270
what had been,
what have been done to it.

2769
02:15:35,370 --> 02:15:38,040
That's so bizarre.
The desire to.

2770
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:42,240
Is it because to sell tickets so people 
have to pay to get in there?

2771
02:15:43,450 --> 02:15:45,200
I think.
I think it's a kind of.

2772
02:15:45,960 --> 02:15:47,760
In this case,
I think it's a kind of possession.

2773
02:15:47,850 --> 02:15:51,570
This is ours.
We've seen it with the experts,

2774
02:15:51,571 --> 02:15:53,430
with the authorities.
Nobody else.

2775
02:15:53,431 --> 02:15:58,431
We're really get to form an opinion 
about it because we're going to damage 

2776
02:15:58,431 --> 02:16:00,210
it's appearance so much in protecting it
that it'll,

2777
02:16:00,240 --> 02:16:03,660
that it'll lose its essential mystery.
Well,

2778
02:16:03,661 --> 02:16:06,390
it just seems bizarre that they're 
trying to protect stone.

2779
02:16:06,391 --> 02:16:07,950
That doesn't make any sense.
It's like,

2780
02:16:07,951 --> 02:16:12,951
imagine if someone decided to put a 
giant canopy over the sphinx and be 

2781
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:12,951
like,
what are you talking about?

2782
02:16:12,951 --> 02:16:16,840
Big Bear forever.
This is being done at archeological 

2783
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:16,860
sites around the world has been done at 
dre and I go him in,

2784
02:16:16,930 --> 02:16:19,860
in Malta,
which have profound,

2785
02:16:19,861 --> 02:16:24,861
astronomical alignments.
You stick a fucking great dome over the 

2786
02:16:24,861 --> 02:16:24,861
top of it,
you know,

2787
02:16:24,861 --> 02:16:28,690
um,
it's being done at Rosslyn Chapel in 

2788
02:16:28,690 --> 02:16:30,070
Edinburgh.
Everything and the worst of the worst

2789
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,080
vandals or often the authorities,
those who,

2790
02:16:32,590 --> 02:16:33,640
those who are in control.
Well,

2791
02:16:33,641 --> 02:16:35,470
that's how we asked guys in the pokey 
now,

2792
02:16:35,471 --> 02:16:36,820
right now,
he's not,

2793
02:16:36,910 --> 02:16:38,440
didn't get arrest him.
He did,

2794
02:16:38,441 --> 02:16:39,550
but all the challenges.
Withdrawal.

2795
02:16:39,580 --> 02:16:43,360
Oh,
he came up with some shackles situation.

2796
02:16:43,570 --> 02:16:47,050
He said he's a big front man for Egypt,
still running everything over there.

2797
02:16:47,051 --> 02:16:48,280
No,
he's not running everything,

2798
02:16:48,281 --> 02:16:52,210
but he's got an official position in 
relation to the promotion of tourism and

2799
02:16:52,211 --> 02:16:56,230
so bizarre when you see those guys so 
vehemently opposed to new information,

2800
02:16:56,231 --> 02:17:01,231
which is essentially what the idea is 
being proposed are there's new 

2801
02:17:01,231 --> 02:17:01,231
information.
Yeah.

2802
02:17:01,231 --> 02:17:05,790
There's certain pieces of new 
information that in my mind or just 

2803
02:17:05,790 --> 02:17:06,710
undeniable the Robert Schoch stuff.
I mean,

2804
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:09,770
I'm trying to.
I my first trip to go back to Tempe,

2805
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:13,480
Robert Shuck and I traveled together.
You guys made a video,

2806
02:17:13,481 --> 02:17:15,680
right?
There was some filming yet,

2807
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:16,660
but we were.

2808
02:17:16,660 --> 02:17:19,340
We were at Rebecca tappy in December.
Uh,

2809
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,790
sorry,
not go back to tempe at Gunung Padang in

2810
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:26,880
Indonesia.
Shock and I were were there in December 

2811
02:17:26,880 --> 02:17:29,760
2013 and then I went back again with,
what was his impression of it?

2812
02:17:29,830 --> 02:17:32,800
His impression was very much that this 
is an intriguing site.

2813
02:17:32,801 --> 02:17:34,480
He looked at the,
you as a geologist,

2814
02:17:34,481 --> 02:17:39,481
he can understand what remote scanning 
paperwork looks like and he looked at 

2815
02:17:39,481 --> 02:17:41,110
what Danny's team had produced and said,
this is absolutely fascinating.

2816
02:17:41,111 --> 02:17:44,590
It really deserves further research and 
that's now what it's getting fortunate.

2817
02:17:44,830 --> 02:17:49,830
Well,
it's just amazing when they uncover 

2818
02:17:49,830 --> 02:17:51,571
these things like I love the ones that 
they find in Mexico when they're like 

2819
02:17:51,571 --> 02:17:54,040
building something and then they stumble
upon some ancient Aztec temple.

2820
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:59,070
Not many people who go to Chichen Itza 
and see the temple of cookware can 

2821
02:17:59,070 --> 02:17:59,500
there.
The pyramidical con,

2822
02:17:59,530 --> 02:18:01,460
which is the famous monument petition 
eater.

2823
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:07,230
Not many people realize that there's 
another pyramid inside it which is 

2824
02:18:07,230 --> 02:18:11,000
inside it.
There's a little door at the bottom of 

2825
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:12,310
the stairway and I don't think it can be
done now.

2826
02:18:12,311 --> 02:18:14,770
The place has been so tightly 
controlled.

2827
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:18,090
I don't think people even allowed to 
climb the pyramid of cuckold con.

2828
02:18:18,250 --> 02:18:23,250
When did they stop that?
I believe that stopped in the last two 

2829
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:23,250
or three years.
I was bare.

2830
02:18:23,250 --> 02:18:27,910
I know it may be a little longer.
I was in the last time I was there was 

2831
02:18:27,910 --> 02:18:30,451
in 2010 and then it was stopped with 
Roseann by people's feet.

2832
02:18:32,020 --> 02:18:35,440
I don't know,
maybe maybe all kinds of arguments,

2833
02:18:35,441 --> 02:18:40,441
but.
But the fact is it was possible to 

2834
02:18:40,441 --> 02:18:40,441
climate.
Yeah.

2835
02:18:40,441 --> 02:18:42,520
I used to back in the nineties anyway,
inside it is a whole second pyramid.

2836
02:18:42,640 --> 02:18:47,640
The pyramid that we see has been built 
on top of an earlier one and there's a 

2837
02:18:47,640 --> 02:18:48,970
passageway leads up to the top of it and
there's an altar and there's a figure of

2838
02:18:48,971 --> 02:18:51,310
a Puma or a Jaguar.

2839
02:18:51,420 --> 02:18:53,860
Inside is very spooky place.
Wow.

2840
02:18:54,620 --> 02:18:55,360
Yeah.
That whole.

2841
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:58,990
The whole complex is so incredible.
It's so amazing to think that,

2842
02:18:59,340 --> 02:19:01,180
you know,
I know you scuba dive.

2843
02:19:01,210 --> 02:19:04,140
You ever done those tunnels that they 
found in the Senate?

2844
02:19:04,330 --> 02:19:05,500
No,
no.

2845
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:09,430
Those are terrifying.
These people scuba dive and they go.

2846
02:19:09,431 --> 02:19:13,600
There's is mind tunnels that they had 
found that are underwater.

2847
02:19:13,620 --> 02:19:14,410
Yeah.
So you have to,

2848
02:19:14,411 --> 02:19:19,411
but the people that are treasure hunters
have gone into these things and you 

2849
02:19:19,411 --> 02:19:19,411
found these incredible artifacts.
Yeah,

2850
02:19:19,411 --> 02:19:22,040
but you gotta be willing to swim 
underwater.

2851
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:25,150
Scuba gear in a dark tunnel for a long 
time.

2852
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:27,770
They're long.
Like you can get a mile in

2853
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:30,200
that.
Temporary takes.

2854
02:19:30,201 --> 02:19:33,380
Tremendous courage also takes,
it takes very special equipment.

2855
02:19:33,830 --> 02:19:34,610
Um,
you know,

2856
02:19:34,611 --> 02:19:38,960
you're having to having to carry a lot 
more air with you and it would be a very

2857
02:19:38,961 --> 02:19:42,110
complex mixture of gases.
Sometimes they have narrow pastures.

2858
02:19:42,111 --> 02:19:44,240
Do you have to squeeze through one of 
the most cave?

2859
02:19:44,280 --> 02:19:47,920
Cave diving is one of the most dangerous
things you know,

2860
02:19:48,200 --> 02:19:49,580
because.
Because I'll tell you why,

2861
02:19:49,581 --> 02:19:52,310
because the entrance passage can be long
and winding.

2862
02:19:52,311 --> 02:19:57,311
There can be several alternative routes 
through it and it's often heavily laden 

2863
02:19:57,311 --> 02:19:59,410
with silt with sediment.
If the dry,

2864
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:03,560
if the diver is not very experienced or 
if the diver panics and starts thrashing

2865
02:20:03,561 --> 02:20:05,030
around,
that silt,

2866
02:20:05,090 --> 02:20:10,090
silt gets thrown up into the water and 
completely fills the water so that you 

2867
02:20:10,090 --> 02:20:13,661
can't see your hand in front of your 
face and suddenly your mile in 100 feet 

2868
02:20:14,271 --> 02:20:16,220
deep and blind.
Oh fuck.

2869
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:23,740
That was one of the most legitimate 
freak out you've ever had on a podcast 

2870
02:20:23,740 --> 02:20:27,490
right there.
You're saying that me thinking that was 

2871
02:20:27,490 --> 02:20:27,620
just a tremendous freak out.
Yeah,

2872
02:20:27,680 --> 02:20:32,680
just the idea of being,
knowing that it's going to run out of 

2873
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:32,680
air before it settles to.
Yes.

2874
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:33,710
Oh yes.
You're done for.

2875
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:37,940
Unless unless you can find your way,
unless by some miracle you can find your

2876
02:20:37,941 --> 02:20:40,070
way through that fog where the very 
first thing,

2877
02:20:40,130 --> 02:20:45,130
if you're going to do that,
that you have to do is you have to calm 

2878
02:20:45,130 --> 02:20:45,130
your mind.
You're freaking me out,

2879
02:20:45,130 --> 02:20:46,340
man.
Yeah,

2880
02:20:46,520 --> 02:20:47,920
yeah.
Well,

2881
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:49,640
let's talk about my novels then.
Well,

2882
02:20:49,641 --> 02:20:51,620
listen,
those people are just brave as far.

2883
02:20:52,300 --> 02:20:54,350
It's amazing that people are willing to 
do that.

2884
02:20:54,800 --> 02:20:56,090
It's guts.
It's courage.

2885
02:20:56,690 --> 02:20:59,390
It's courage.
Courage of the warrior in a way.

2886
02:20:59,510 --> 02:21:02,260
So is this.
How many novels have you written there?

2887
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:04,640
So I've written three.
Just the third.

2888
02:21:04,641 --> 02:21:05,780
Well,
I've written an entangled,

2889
02:21:05,781 --> 02:21:10,781
which is a whole other story.
And then I've written volume one and 

2890
02:21:10,781 --> 02:21:11,000
volume two of war.
God,

2891
02:21:11,060 --> 02:21:12,920
the first volume was war God,
knights of the,

2892
02:21:12,921 --> 02:21:17,570
which it was published in 2013.
There was a big support and take up from

2893
02:21:17,571 --> 02:21:18,950
your audience,
which has beautiful,

2894
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:23,990
really grateful for.
I heard a lot of positive reviews to 

2895
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:23,990
people.
Enjoyed it.

2896
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:24,320
Thank you.
And I made A.

2897
02:21:24,320 --> 02:21:29,320
I made an offer at that time on your 
show where I said that if people wrote 

2898
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:32,840
to me at a particular address,
which is war God dedications@gmail.com,

2899
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:37,340
and sent me their own address and showed
me that they've pre ordered the book,

2900
02:21:37,930 --> 02:21:41,450
I would send them assigned dedicated 
bookplate.

2901
02:21:41,630 --> 02:21:43,010
In other words,
I would sign a label.

2902
02:21:43,011 --> 02:21:44,660
I would dedicate it to them.
I would send it to them.

2903
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:49,870
Little did I know that nearly 5,000
people would ask for those signed 

2904
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:50,270
dedicated book plates.

2905
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:54,800
It became a massive labor of love for 
myself and my wife Santha.

2906
02:21:54,840 --> 02:21:59,840
She's doing the envelope thing.
I'm dealing with the correspondents 

2907
02:21:59,840 --> 02:21:59,900
putting the signing,
signing the book plates.

2908
02:21:59,930 --> 02:22:03,830
We go to the post office were spending 
thousands of pounds on postage and that.

2909
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:06,380
But it was great.
It was a fantastic thing and it gave and

2910
02:22:06,381 --> 02:22:09,050
it.
And it helped the book to get noticed.

2911
02:22:09,070 --> 02:22:11,720
Um,
because there was great skepticism about

2912
02:22:11,721 --> 02:22:16,721
buying a second volume from my 
publishers unless the first volume 

2913
02:22:16,721 --> 02:22:20,080
worked.
And the first volume worked enough for 

2914
02:22:20,080 --> 02:22:21,140
me to to be commissioned to write volume
two of what God,

2915
02:22:21,160 --> 02:22:26,160
which is called war God,
returned to the prelim serpent and that 

2916
02:22:26,160 --> 02:22:29,160
is published on the ninth of October.
And I'm making the same special offer.

2917
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:31,680
Very Limited.
Don't do to you,

2918
02:22:31,820 --> 02:22:33,360
but it's going to be a bit different.
First Time.

2919
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:36,300
First off the,
if you go to my website,

2920
02:22:36,390 --> 02:22:40,920
go to www.grahamhancock.com
and go to the war God page.

2921
02:22:40,920 --> 02:22:43,560
It's very easy to get there.
I'm right.

2922
02:22:43,590 --> 02:22:48,590
Scroll down at the bottom of the page 
that shows the covers of all the 

2923
02:22:48,590 --> 02:22:50,070
additions and you will find a statement 
there.

2924
02:22:50,100 --> 02:22:53,220
And that is that if people write to me,
if people preorder,

2925
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:58,250
first of all,
they have to preorder either order 

2926
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:00,621
volume one or preorder volume to Amazon.
Don't take your money until they 

2927
02:23:00,621 --> 02:23:02,820
actually send the book.
And I've got the links to Amazon.com.

2928
02:23:02,821 --> 02:23:07,821
They're a,
I will when I finished my travels and 

2929
02:23:07,821 --> 02:23:10,200
I'm going to be on the road until the 
27th of October.

2930
02:23:10,920 --> 02:23:15,920
Uh,
but during November I will send out 

2931
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:17,580
those book plates again.
But what I can't do this time is I can't

2932
02:23:17,581 --> 02:23:19,530
get into personal correspondence with 
people.

2933
02:23:19,890 --> 02:23:23,050
It was very interesting.
It was very touching and heart and heart

2934
02:23:23,051 --> 02:23:28,051
warming thing that so many people wrote 
to me and so many of them I wanted to 

2935
02:23:28,051 --> 02:23:28,710
speak back to them.

2936
02:23:28,900 --> 02:23:29,850
It's very cold,
you know,

2937
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:32,050
to receive a letter and not to reply.
So.

2938
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:33,840
So I did,
but I.

2939
02:23:33,841 --> 02:23:38,841
The problem this year is that I've got 
to write the sequel to fingerprints of 

2940
02:23:38,841 --> 02:23:42,021
the gods and I really need to start that
during November because my research 

2941
02:23:42,021 --> 02:23:45,510
travels will be over at that point.
I've got to write that and I can't spend

2942
02:23:45,511 --> 02:23:48,480
two months or three months corresponding
in detail.

2943
02:23:48,481 --> 02:23:50,580
So my,
my offer is right to me.

2944
02:23:51,150 --> 02:23:55,350
Show me that you've bought the book or 
preordered volume to a and above all,

2945
02:23:55,351 --> 02:23:58,200
please give me your postal address 
because you can't imagine how many times

2946
02:23:58,201 --> 02:24:03,201
people write to me asking for the book 
flights and don't get me their postal 

2947
02:24:03,201 --> 02:24:06,081
address.
Please give me your postal address and 

2948
02:24:06,081 --> 02:24:06,390
when I get back from my travels,
I will sign the book plates.

2949
02:24:06,450 --> 02:24:11,450
I will send you a signed book plate,
which is simply a label that you can 

2950
02:24:11,450 --> 02:24:11,640
stick inside your copy of the book and 
that if,

2951
02:24:11,641 --> 02:24:15,810
if,
if that results in a bit more uptake for

2952
02:24:15,960 --> 02:24:20,960
war God too,
it'll be good for me because it's very 

2953
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:23,400
difficult to start a new career as a 
novelist at the age of 64.

2954
02:24:23,580 --> 02:24:25,650
Uh,
and we really enjoy it.

2955
02:24:25,651 --> 02:24:30,651
I love it.
I love writing novels and I love 

2956
02:24:30,651 --> 02:24:30,651
getting.
This is why I was talking about warriors

2957
02:24:30,651 --> 02:24:34,791
earlier.
I love getting into the spirit of the 

2958
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:34,791
warrior.

2959
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:35,970
I don't know why it's fascinating.
It's just,

2960
02:24:35,971 --> 02:24:40,971
it's just absolutely fascinating what 
would drive a man like Cortez to take 

2961
02:24:40,971 --> 02:24:44,601
490 men and,
and face them against the might of the 

2962
02:24:44,601 --> 02:24:49,040
Aztec Empire,
hundreds of thousands of men under arms 

2963
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:49,040
who will kill you in the most awful way 
if they,

2964
02:24:49,040 --> 02:24:53,510
if they catch you,
what kind of will does it take to do 

2965
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:53,510
that?
And,

2966
02:24:53,510 --> 02:24:58,020
and it was,
it's been interesting for me to get 

2967
02:24:58,020 --> 02:24:59,781
inside the heads of these people and 
also to consider because I'm interested 

2968
02:24:59,781 --> 02:25:03,621
in them supernatural elements where they
being misled by demonic forces in some 

2969
02:25:03,621 --> 02:25:03,750
way.
That's something that,

2970
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:05,640
that exam.
So I love doing it,

2971
02:25:05,641 --> 02:25:10,641
but it's,
I'm known as a nonfiction author and 

2972
02:25:10,641 --> 02:25:10,710
that's mainly what I do.
Uh,

2973
02:25:10,920 --> 02:25:13,920
people by nonfiction because they're 
interested in the subject.

2974
02:25:13,921 --> 02:25:18,921
Very often people buy a novelist because
they trust that novelist and know that 

2975
02:25:18,921 --> 02:25:20,340
his next book will be good leadership.

2976
02:25:20,550 --> 02:25:25,550
Your fascination with demons.
What's your fascination with 

2977
02:25:25,550 --> 02:25:27,380
supernatural influences and the concept 
of demons?

2978
02:25:27,440 --> 02:25:32,440
For a long time,
I didn't believe in any spiritual 

2979
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:32,440
element to life.
I was,

2980
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:35,050
I didn't see any of that at all.
It was only really when I send,

2981
02:25:35,051 --> 02:25:36,160
and this is where my credit is,
we'll say,

2982
02:25:36,161 --> 02:25:37,270
well,
handcuffs gone nuts.

2983
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:42,271
You know,
it was only really when I started 

2984
02:25:42,271 --> 02:25:44,281
drinking Iowasca in 2003,
I suppose for a decade before that,

2985
02:25:45,430 --> 02:25:47,860
I'd been immersed in the ancient 
Egyptian texts.

2986
02:25:48,280 --> 02:25:53,280
And the ancient Egyptians are all about 
the quest for immortal life.

2987
02:25:53,470 --> 02:25:56,590
They're all,
they're all about how you live this life

2988
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:01,920
to continue on as a,
as a spirit and ultimately to live the 

2989
02:26:01,920 --> 02:26:05,470
life of millions of years,
and they very clearly indicate that dark

2990
02:26:05,471 --> 02:26:10,471
forces are at work in the universe which
can mislead us as well as there are 

2991
02:26:10,471 --> 02:26:11,740
light and positive forces that we can 
choose to follow,

2992
02:26:11,741 --> 02:26:16,080
which will lead us into very nurturing 
and worthwhile and excellent directions.

2993
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:19,180
All those influences are there.
So that's there in ancient Egypt.

2994
02:26:19,450 --> 02:26:23,360
Then I start drinking.
I asked her in 2003 and I encounter,

2995
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:27,190
um,
seamlessly convincing parallel realms,

2996
02:26:27,220 --> 02:26:32,220
inhabited by intelligent beings,
some of whom a seem very dark and 

2997
02:26:33,341 --> 02:26:38,341
dangerous and some have,
and some of whom are filled with light 

2998
02:26:38,341 --> 02:26:39,580
and joy and,
and exercise the power of healing.

2999
02:26:39,581 --> 02:26:44,581
Now,
I absolutely accept that all of this 

3000
02:26:44,581 --> 02:26:46,960
could be a projection or a creation of 
my own mind,

3001
02:26:46,961 --> 02:26:50,200
that there is no exterior reality to it 
whatsoever.

3002
02:26:50,320 --> 02:26:51,850
It's just,
that's all there is.

3003
02:26:52,130 --> 02:26:54,370
Um,
but I don't think it's that way.

3004
02:26:54,430 --> 02:26:59,430
I think.
I think that what happens in a deeply 

3005
02:26:59,430 --> 02:26:59,890
altered state of consciousness is that 
we've reached in the receiver wavelength

3006
02:26:59,891 --> 02:27:04,891
of the brain and and counter other 
levels of reality that are normally 

3007
02:27:05,681 --> 02:27:08,160
closed off to our senses.
And the first thing I would say to any.

3008
02:27:08,170 --> 02:27:13,170
I know that a number of people who've 
worked with psychedelics in depth 

3009
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:14,050
haven't come to that conclusion.
I know that,

3010
02:27:14,320 --> 02:27:19,320
but the conclusion that I come to my,
the little offering that I bring to the 

3011
02:27:19,320 --> 02:27:22,870
table and that many others have brought 
is that there is a separate freestanding

3012
02:27:22,871 --> 02:27:26,260
reality of some kind which we don't 
fully understand yet.

3013
02:27:26,320 --> 02:27:30,190
And that in altered states of 
consciousness we can encounter,

3014
02:27:30,191 --> 02:27:33,770
interact with that reality.
That's the.

3015
02:27:33,780 --> 02:27:38,050
That's the view that I have now.
In that reality are spiritual forces.

3016
02:27:38,410 --> 02:27:42,730
Some of which seem to eat fear in energy
and,

3017
02:27:42,731 --> 02:27:43,150
and,
and,

3018
02:27:43,151 --> 02:27:45,490
and dark energy.
They thrive on.

3019
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:48,450
They think they seem to thrive on 
anything that's miserable or wicked or,

3020
02:27:48,451 --> 02:27:48,850
or,
or,

3021
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:52,630
or cruel or thoughtless of viral about 
humanity.

3022
02:27:52,900 --> 02:27:57,900
And at the other side of it are entities
that glow with light and love and that 

3023
02:27:58,480 --> 02:28:03,480
and that seek to show us how we may 
bring to light that divine spark within 

3024
02:28:04,901 --> 02:28:07,120
us to go back to the GNOSTIC,
gnostic idea,

3025
02:28:07,420 --> 02:28:12,420
those you encounter in a very direct way
in the Iowaska journey,

3026
02:28:13,210 --> 02:28:14,770
um,
because unlike,

3027
02:28:14,800 --> 02:28:16,750
you do encounter them in the DMT,
Jenny too,

3028
02:28:16,751 --> 02:28:18,100
they're not quite the same.

3029
02:28:18,100 --> 02:28:21,500
But unlike DMT I asked,
it allows time for really processing and

3030
02:28:21,501 --> 02:28:23,270
thinking through what you're 
experiencing.

3031
02:28:23,271 --> 02:28:25,070
It's,
it's unfolding over four hours,

3032
02:28:25,071 --> 02:28:26,510
not four or five minutes.
And that,

3033
02:28:26,850 --> 02:28:27,610
you know,
that is,

3034
02:28:28,350 --> 02:28:31,460
is a huge effect and it had a huge 
effect on me and I,

3035
02:28:31,461 --> 02:28:32,090
I'm,
I'm,

3036
02:28:32,650 --> 02:28:34,880
I'm not adamant about this.
I accept.

3037
02:28:34,881 --> 02:28:37,380
I could be fantasizing it all.
It's interesting.

3038
02:28:37,381 --> 02:28:40,080
The other people encounter pretty much 
the same beings and,

3039
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:45,120
and the same sort of drive to do 
something better than they've done 

3040
02:28:45,171 --> 02:28:50,171
before.
It's interesting that there's that 

3041
02:28:50,171 --> 02:28:52,871
transpersonal side of it.
I choose to believe that there are 

3042
02:28:52,871 --> 02:28:53,990
freestanding parallel dimensions and 
that we are encountering them in altered

3043
02:28:53,991 --> 02:28:58,991
states of consciousness.
And therefore there's interesting 

3044
02:28:58,991 --> 02:29:01,031
scientific work to be done because in 
theory we could actually begin the 

3045
02:29:01,031 --> 02:29:04,031
targeted exploration of those dimensions
by using volunteers on psychedelics.

3046
02:29:05,151 --> 02:29:06,590
I choose to believe that that's what's 
going on.

3047
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:11,590
I could be completely wrong.
It could just be the majesty of the 

3048
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:11,590
human mind and we just invent all these 
worlds.

3049
02:29:11,590 --> 02:29:16,300
That's what I was going to ask you.
What's the most compelling argument 

3050
02:29:16,300 --> 02:29:18,761
against it?
Like what's the most compelling art 

3051
02:29:18,761 --> 02:29:21,040
article?
A argument rather from a neurological 

3052
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:21,770
standpoint like has anybody ever 
explained to you like what's going on?

3053
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:23,690
There isn't a compelling argument.
I don't know.

3054
02:29:23,960 --> 02:29:28,960
There isn't a compelling argument.
There's a reference frame and the 

3055
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:32,141
reference frame,
and this is again where where I got 

3056
02:29:32,141 --> 02:29:34,421
myself into so much trouble with Ted,
the reference frame is the reference 

3057
02:29:34,421 --> 02:29:37,901
frame of materialist science and that 
reference frame says that all 

3058
02:29:37,901 --> 02:29:42,251
consciousness is a kind of accidental 
epi phenomenon of brain activity.

3059
02:29:43,420 --> 02:29:46,250
There's actually no reality to 
consciousness.

3060
02:29:46,460 --> 02:29:50,450
That is not something that's been proven
scientifically and experimentally.

3061
02:29:50,780 --> 02:29:55,780
It is just the way that a large and 
influential group of scientists see the 

3062
02:29:55,780 --> 02:29:57,710
world that everything can be reduced to 
material causes.

3063
02:29:57,710 --> 02:30:01,190
So the changes in brain activity that 
accompany visions,

3064
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:06,520
you can measure,
you can observe those changes on MRI 

3065
02:30:06,520 --> 02:30:09,251
scanner,
those changes in brain activity are the 

3066
02:30:09,251 --> 02:30:11,000
experience you're having according to 
this reference frame.

3067
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:11,530
Your,
the,

3068
02:30:11,531 --> 02:30:14,030
your experience can be reduced to that 
and there's nothing else to it,

3069
02:30:14,031 --> 02:30:16,190
but that's not a fact.
That is a,

3070
02:30:16,640 --> 02:30:20,090
that is a philosophical view about how 
reality works.

3071
02:30:21,050 --> 02:30:24,730
We don't know for sure.
It could easily be the other way round,

3072
02:30:25,100 --> 02:30:26,210
um,
that,

3073
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:31,270
that the brain activity is simply 
necessary in order for us to see 

3074
02:30:31,270 --> 02:30:35,741
something that was always there,
but it was normally closed off to our 

3075
02:30:35,741 --> 02:30:35,741
senses.
So the,

3076
02:30:35,741 --> 02:30:38,800
the,
the compelling argument as far as like,

3077
02:30:39,010 --> 02:30:43,250
what's happening when you're having 
these extreme visual experiences,

3078
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:46,010
what's,
what does the argument.

3079
02:30:46,040 --> 02:30:51,040
Has anybody ever tried to explain it?
Is it just some supposed to be some 

3080
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:51,040
chemical reaction with your cerebral 
cortex?

3081
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:51,830
That's the.
Yes,

3082
02:30:51,831 --> 02:30:56,831
that is the,
that is the materialist reductionist 

3083
02:30:56,831 --> 02:30:57,410
view,
but it's just that and nothing more.

3084
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:03,040
But there's a whole other view on it.
Rick Strassman at the University of New 

3085
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:07,540
Mexico,
you're very familiar with his weight 

3086
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:07,540
because you presented the spirit 
molecule.

3087
02:31:07,540 --> 02:31:09,440
Yes,
Rick's Rick Strassman does entertain the

3088
02:31:09,441 --> 02:31:14,441
possibility that what is going on is not
merely in and of our brains but does 

3089
02:31:14,601 --> 02:31:17,690
represent stable,
freestanding dimensions of reality.

3090
02:31:17,691 --> 02:31:20,370
We have no facts in but we have an 
incredibly

3091
02:31:20,370 --> 02:31:22,950
intriguing area to inquire into,
you know,

3092
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:28,260
and it's also one of those things where 
I feel like when you've experienced it 

3093
02:31:28,260 --> 02:31:31,641
yourself,
you get a really better frame of 

3094
02:31:31,641 --> 02:31:31,641
reference as to why this is compelling 
it all because it sounds preposterous to

3095
02:31:31,641 --> 02:31:34,050
someone who has no experience.
I know it really does.

3096
02:31:34,490 --> 02:31:35,240
You know,
because.

3097
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:38,610
And I'm going to have loads of people 
saying handcuffs at Draghi of course too

3098
02:31:38,611 --> 02:31:43,611
late,
but there's that thing that people want 

3099
02:31:43,611 --> 02:31:45,510
when you want to define certain aspects 
of,

3100
02:31:45,530 --> 02:31:50,530
of whatever the psychedelic experiences 
where they seem to be almost impossible 

3101
02:31:52,141 --> 02:31:54,750
to define for people who have actually 
experienced it.

3102
02:31:54,751 --> 02:31:59,751
Yes.
The real problem is when someone who 

3103
02:31:59,751 --> 02:31:59,751
hasn't experienced it tries to define it
and it's like,

3104
02:31:59,751 --> 02:32:04,550
man,
you can come up with a bunch of really 

3105
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:06,510
compelling arguments from a medical 
standpoint.

3106
02:32:06,511 --> 02:32:11,511
It's to like what is,
what's the effect on the cerebral 

3107
02:32:11,511 --> 02:32:11,511
cortex?

3108
02:32:11,511 --> 02:32:12,210
What's the effect on the visual aspects 
of,

3109
02:32:12,240 --> 02:32:12,750
you know,
the,

3110
02:32:12,751 --> 02:32:17,751
your interpretation of this thing is 
because of this chemical interacting 

3111
02:32:17,751 --> 02:32:17,751
with that.
That's all fascinating,

3112
02:32:17,751 --> 02:32:22,341
amazing stuff.
But the science is bad science to 

3113
02:32:23,191 --> 02:32:27,330
present it as fact when it isn't.
I have many times given this very simple

3114
02:32:27,331 --> 02:32:29,300
analogy of the telescope,
um,

3115
02:32:29,490 --> 02:32:32,670
which I think explains the logical 
problem in the materialist view.

3116
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:35,790
If you want to look at a distant star 
with your telescope,

3117
02:32:35,791 --> 02:32:38,550
you're going to point it at the right 
area of the sky first of all,

3118
02:32:38,720 --> 02:32:41,250
and then you're going to focus it.
And as you focus it,

3119
02:32:41,550 --> 02:32:46,550
physical changes will take place in the 
relationship between the lenses inside 

3120
02:32:46,550 --> 02:32:47,730
the barrel of the telescope.
Yeah,

3121
02:32:47,850 --> 02:32:48,760
right.
Okay.

3122
02:32:49,020 --> 02:32:52,230
Eventually the star will come into view 
and you can see it clearly.

3123
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:57,440
You'd be completely wrong to say that 
the star is the physical changes inside 

3124
02:32:57,440 --> 02:32:57,440
the barrel of the telescope.

3125
02:32:57,780 --> 02:33:02,780
Those physical changes have simply 
allowed you to see the star with my 

3126
02:33:02,780 --> 02:33:05,640
fucking mind,
and that's the same idea with Dmt,

3127
02:33:05,670 --> 02:33:10,670
that it's that it's changing brain 
function to allow you to see something 

3128
02:33:10,670 --> 02:33:13,881
that you couldn't.
It's refocusing the brain in other 

3129
02:33:13,881 --> 02:33:13,881
words.
Wow,

3130
02:33:13,881 --> 02:33:15,750
that's very possible.
It's an interesting inquiry.

3131
02:33:15,810 --> 02:33:17,520
I'd never thought about it that way.
I don't think.

3132
02:33:17,550 --> 02:33:22,550
Not Entirely and and interesting 
experiments could be done to test that 

3133
02:33:22,550 --> 02:33:23,910
with human volunteers.
You could.

3134
02:33:23,911 --> 02:33:26,280
You could begin to investigate if there 
is a freestanding reality,

3135
02:33:26,281 --> 02:33:31,281
then we ought to be able to get certain 
information out of it that they should 

3136
02:33:31,281 --> 02:33:32,490
be possibilities.
So you know,

3137
02:33:33,290 --> 02:33:36,540
we always had just started as a chemical
gateway.

3138
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:41,600
Yeah,
but I think this is a way better way of 

3139
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:44,241
explaining it.
The idea of a telescope having to focus 

3140
02:33:44,241 --> 02:33:47,931
in to see something and then the 
chemicals focusing you in that a 

3141
02:33:47,931 --> 02:33:50,340
chemical,
your own brain makes your brain makes it

3142
02:33:50,370 --> 02:33:52,710
focusing Ulan and perhaps for some very 
good reason.

3143
02:33:52,770 --> 02:33:54,120
Wow,
that's amazing.

3144
02:33:54,121 --> 02:33:58,980
I never thought about that way before,
but whatever it is,

3145
02:33:59,070 --> 02:34:02,010
it's pretty fucking profound and for 
someone to comment on it,

3146
02:34:02,011 --> 02:34:04,050
that hasn't taken.
It seems kind of silly,

3147
02:34:04,230 --> 02:34:07,500
especially because it's only 15 minutes 
is disrespectful to speak of.

3148
02:34:07,501 --> 02:34:12,501
It too is it's fine to speak of it,
but it's disrespectful to put it down 

3149
02:34:12,501 --> 02:34:16,410
without having had the guts actually to 
have the experience yourself.

3150
02:34:16,470 --> 02:34:19,180
Don't you think it's becoming more and 
more accepted though?

3151
02:34:19,240 --> 02:34:24,240
Because I think for a long time 
academics resisted taking it or if they 

3152
02:34:24,240 --> 02:34:28,081
did take it,
talking about it because they didn't 

3153
02:34:28,081 --> 02:34:28,510
want to be labeled because there's a lot
of people have that will label you.

3154
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:33,540
If you talk about psychedelic recently,
it's been considered a career relenting 

3155
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:36,640
move and I can talk very recently,
even though they all knew the news,

3156
02:34:37,170 --> 02:34:41,020
it'll knew the positive side of this,
but this is again gradually changing and

3157
02:34:41,021 --> 02:34:43,420
again,
I think the the American role,

3158
02:34:43,600 --> 02:34:48,600
the role of the American people in 
changing the legal status of cannabis 

3159
02:34:48,600 --> 02:34:52,711
state by state is also going to feed 
into this and allow us to have a more 

3160
02:34:52,711 --> 02:34:53,620
rational dialogue regarding 
psychedelics,

3161
02:34:53,860 --> 02:34:55,180
which can be.

3162
02:34:55,420 --> 02:35:00,420
Of course,
I'm not saying to people yet go out and 

3163
02:35:00,420 --> 02:35:03,271
take psychedelics.
What I'm saying is that these are very 

3164
02:35:03,271 --> 02:35:06,751
powerful agents and that they can be 
extremely healing used in the right way 

3165
02:35:07,850 --> 02:35:10,810
and they can change our whole view of 
reality.

3166
02:35:10,811 --> 02:35:15,811
Why should we be forbidden to explore 
that if as responsible adults we choose 

3167
02:35:15,811 --> 02:35:16,740
to do so?
Yeah,

3168
02:35:16,770 --> 02:35:17,290
it's,
it's,

3169
02:35:17,291 --> 02:35:22,291
it's the argument is stupid and I think 
the argument is eventually going away 

3170
02:35:22,291 --> 02:35:26,790
and I think it will be replaced by a new
argument and then the new argument is 

3171
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:26,790
what the fuck is really happening?
Yeah,

3172
02:35:26,790 --> 02:35:31,530
and your.
Is it your question about it or your 

3173
02:35:31,530 --> 02:35:32,770
proposal is vast,
very fascinating one,

3174
02:35:32,980 --> 02:35:37,980
but whatever it is,
those things are there and you can 

3175
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:39,040
benefit from them or not.
It's up to you,

3176
02:35:39,070 --> 02:35:44,070
but yeah,
it's the fact that we live in a world 

3177
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:44,070
where those are illegal is is,
is crazy,

3178
02:35:44,070 --> 02:35:48,520
it's gone,
and if people are having very bad 

3179
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:48,520
experiences from time to time with 
psychedelics,

3180
02:35:48,520 --> 02:35:53,340
part of the reason for that is the world
we've created where these are illegal 

3181
02:35:53,340 --> 02:35:55,720
and where it's impossible for people to 
get good advice that they can trust them

3182
02:35:55,721 --> 02:35:58,300
with as this atmosphere of danger and 
threat that surrounds it.

3183
02:35:58,360 --> 02:36:03,360
Take all that away and this very 
powerful instrument can be managed much 

3184
02:36:03,851 --> 02:36:04,740
more effectively.
No,

3185
02:36:04,780 --> 02:36:05,590
no,
no doubt,

3186
02:36:05,591 --> 02:36:08,010
and I equate it a lot of ways.
This,

3187
02:36:08,070 --> 02:36:13,070
this idea of it being bad and negative,
acquainted a lot of ways to vaccinations

3188
02:36:13,571 --> 02:36:18,571
and here's why there's this vaccination 
is anti vaccination movement in this 

3189
02:36:18,571 --> 02:36:22,501
country.
A lot of people feel like vaccinations 

3190
02:36:22,501 --> 02:36:23,650
are unnecessary and they may have some 
good arguments.

3191
02:36:23,830 --> 02:36:28,830
They may have some good arguments,
especially about some certain 

3192
02:36:28,830 --> 02:36:29,050
vaccinations for things that are 
sexually transmitted,

3193
02:36:29,051 --> 02:36:32,140
diseases and things along those lines 
like hepatitis shots and shit.

3194
02:36:32,141 --> 02:36:37,141
You're given a little kid,
so there's a real good argument against 

3195
02:36:37,141 --> 02:36:40,891
that and there's a little.
There's definitely an argument that 

3196
02:36:40,891 --> 02:36:43,270
there's a lot of medication the kids are
taking and is it the right amount,

3197
02:36:43,690 --> 02:36:48,340
but there's no argument that 
vaccinations haven't saved a fuck ton of

3198
02:36:48,341 --> 02:36:49,540
lives because they have.

3199
02:36:50,210 --> 02:36:52,390
They've stopped a lot of diseases.
Data and attract.

3200
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:54,520
Absolutely,
but they also,

3201
02:36:54,580 --> 02:36:57,520
much like we talked about,
some people are allergic to cats,

3202
02:36:57,790 --> 02:37:02,790
some people are very different 
biological reactions to all sorts of 

3203
02:37:02,790 --> 02:37:03,110
different chemicals and there's going to
be some adverse reactions.

3204
02:37:03,380 --> 02:37:07,810
Something in your body that I absolutely
agree that the vaccination is incredibly

3205
02:37:07,811 --> 02:37:12,811
effective medical tool in many ways,
but there also is a kind of vaccination 

3206
02:37:12,811 --> 02:37:16,561
mafia because they are the ultimate mass
medication and people are making money.

3207
02:37:16,750 --> 02:37:19,220
There's no doubt there's whenever 
there's profits,

3208
02:37:19,250 --> 02:37:21,230
there's fuckery.
There's no getting around it.

3209
02:37:21,420 --> 02:37:25,070
Just the way he even being side by side.
So the.

3210
02:37:25,080 --> 02:37:25,540
Yeah,
it's.

3211
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:31,060
It's one of those scenarios very much 
like psychedelics in a way that the are 

3212
02:37:31,060 --> 02:37:34,220
going to be some rare cases.
If we make psychedelics legal across the

3213
02:37:34,221 --> 02:37:36,020
board,
there's going to be some rare cases of a

3214
02:37:36,021 --> 02:37:41,021
person in a bad state of mind or a bad 
mental makeup or what have you.

3215
02:37:41,110 --> 02:37:46,110
Pad psychological makeup,
you can fill in the blanks where they 

3216
02:37:46,110 --> 02:37:48,821
take it and it's detrimental to them.
It's going to happen and that'll be 

3217
02:37:48,821 --> 02:37:51,941
highly publicized and used as an 
argument to stop all of these freedoms 

3218
02:37:51,941 --> 02:37:55,010
and building access is ridiculous.
Have the very best answer to that as I'm

3219
02:37:55,011 --> 02:37:56,730
sure as I'm sure you remember,
you know the,

3220
02:37:56,740 --> 02:37:57,200
the,
the,

3221
02:37:57,230 --> 02:38:01,400
the lunatic who leaps out of the window 
and he can fly on Lsd.

3222
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:03,780
Why didn't the fucker try and take off 
from the ground?

3223
02:38:04,940 --> 02:38:06,250
He goes,
we lost a moron.

3224
02:38:06,260 --> 02:38:08,600
The world got lighter.
Exactly.

3225
02:38:09,520 --> 02:38:11,450
World got lighters.
One of my favorite lines.

3226
02:38:11,480 --> 02:38:13,010
Beautiful.
But that's,

3227
02:38:13,011 --> 02:38:15,020
um,
that is,

3228
02:38:15,021 --> 02:38:16,260
uh,
you know,

3229
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:22,750
it's,
it's just a strange argument to keep 

3230
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:22,790
people from doing it because,
especially like this doctor that we were

3231
02:38:22,791 --> 02:38:27,791
talking about earlier that's talking 
about cannabis in the addictive 

3232
02:38:27,791 --> 02:38:30,551
properties of cannabis,
and this isn't even talking to someone 

3233
02:38:30,551 --> 02:38:31,170
who was addicted to cannabis and you,
it's still,

3234
02:38:31,370 --> 02:38:33,200
it's a silly,
I like,

3235
02:38:33,201 --> 02:38:35,000
there's a lot going on when someone's 
addicted.

3236
02:38:35,190 --> 02:38:40,190
It's not all necessarily chemical and 
the ones that are chemical you're 

3237
02:38:40,190 --> 02:38:41,180
getting paid for,
so that doesn't even make any sense.

3238
02:38:41,270 --> 02:38:46,270
The ones that chemically make you 
addicted as the ones you're getting 

3239
02:38:46,270 --> 02:38:49,151
money from,
people are fed up with all of this shit 

3240
02:38:49,151 --> 02:38:51,791
because it's so corrupt and it's so 
wrong and it's time that is time that a 

3241
02:38:51,791 --> 02:38:54,851
new direction was taken.
And there are people who are on the 

3242
02:38:54,851 --> 02:38:54,851
wrong side of history on this and the 
will be.

3243
02:38:54,900 --> 02:38:57,710
But we are moving forward.
I think we are as well.

3244
02:38:57,711 --> 02:38:58,600
I think it's,
uh,

3245
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:00,970
it's,
it's pretty cool to see too.

3246
02:39:01,090 --> 02:39:01,580
Yeah.
But,

3247
02:39:01,610 --> 02:39:06,610
you know,
I think it's also important that a guy 

3248
02:39:06,610 --> 02:39:07,280
like you who smoked pot from 9:00
AM to 2:00

3249
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:08,660
AM every day,
seven days a week,

3250
02:39:08,690 --> 02:39:10,920
seven days a week,
365 days a week,

3251
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:13,100
going to enormous length to be able to 
obtain it.

3252
02:39:13,100 --> 02:39:18,100
When I was traveling,
I was that of sources that it is,

3253
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:20,690
it is.
Um,

3254
02:39:20,860 --> 02:39:22,730
I,
I do know what I'm talking about.

3255
02:39:22,731 --> 02:39:25,230
I had a long relationship with it.
And um,

3256
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,910
I understand how,
how do you feel now having good dip back

3257
02:39:28,911 --> 02:39:29,810
in the water?
A little bit.

3258
02:39:29,811 --> 02:39:32,660
I feel good,
but I don't feel any urge to become that

3259
02:39:32,661 --> 02:39:35,120
guy again.
My clarity,

3260
02:39:35,420 --> 02:39:35,910
I've,
I,

3261
02:39:35,970 --> 02:39:40,010
I was able to write with cannabis,
but since I stopped smoking cannabis,

3262
02:39:40,011 --> 02:39:43,710
I've been clear.
My mind has been a clarity.

3263
02:39:43,720 --> 02:39:46,880
So there's a certain fog was lifted.
That fog wouldn't have been there if I'd

3264
02:39:46,881 --> 02:39:51,881
had one joint at the weekend and that 
was all but it since I was smoking all 

3265
02:39:51,881 --> 02:39:51,881
day long.
That's why it was there.

3266
02:39:51,881 --> 02:39:52,770
It's nice not to have that felt.
Yeah,

3267
02:39:52,970 --> 02:39:54,230
go to bed.
I feel more productive.

3268
02:39:54,231 --> 02:39:56,450
I write my novels.
I can write 5,000

3269
02:39:56,451 --> 02:39:58,680
words a day,
sometimes I'd get sucked the zone,

3270
02:39:58,681 --> 02:40:00,490
so into the flow.
Um,

3271
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:05,560
you know,
that all that is good and I feel I feel 

3272
02:40:05,560 --> 02:40:08,081
good about it.
And I think field probably in the long 

3273
02:40:08,081 --> 02:40:08,900
run,
my right choice would not be have a big,

3274
02:40:08,930 --> 02:40:11,090
have a big relationship with cannabis.
I think I've done that.

3275
02:40:11,091 --> 02:40:12,260
Been there,
done that.

3276
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:14,160
Know I've got the t shirt.

3277
02:40:14,740 --> 02:40:16,200
For me,
it's a tool.

3278
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:19,770
I don't use the same tool every day is 
that sometimes I'll use any tools,

3279
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:25,160
need it,
but it has a pretty profound effect a 

3280
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:25,160
lot of ways.
You know,

3281
02:40:25,160 --> 02:40:29,340
one of my favorite things to do is at 
night get high and go down to the beach 

3282
02:40:29,610 --> 02:40:32,010
and stare at the ocean.
I used to love doing that.

3283
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:34,200
Oh my God,
I think freaks me out when I'm high.

3284
02:40:34,650 --> 02:40:35,910
When you're,
when you're this,

3285
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:38,370
it's a goddess.
It's a monster.

3286
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:41,160
It's a living thing almost.
It's a force.

3287
02:40:41,510 --> 02:40:45,330
It's a nature force that doesn't give a 
fuck about you.

3288
02:40:45,720 --> 02:40:50,720
I think there's one reason why like 
people that live by the beach or so 

3289
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:50,950
mellow.
Yeah.

3290
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:53,460
The beach communities are notoriously 
mellow.

3291
02:40:53,490 --> 02:40:58,490
That's true,
and I think one of the reasons why 

3292
02:40:58,490 --> 02:40:59,520
they're notoriously Melo is because 
they're faced with overwhelming evidence

3293
02:40:59,521 --> 02:41:00,630
that day ain't shit.

3294
02:41:00,670 --> 02:41:05,670
Yes.
You're sitting there looking out at the 

3295
02:41:05,670 --> 02:41:08,130
greatest like natural force that you 
could imagine.

3296
02:41:08,131 --> 02:41:10,950
It's an entire different world.
You're out there.

3297
02:41:11,100 --> 02:41:16,100
Literally.
It's like if we had explained it in a 

3298
02:41:16,100 --> 02:41:18,811
galactic term,
it would be like your parking yourself 

3299
02:41:18,811 --> 02:41:22,041
next to the membrane between dimensions.
I mean you are literally in this world 

3300
02:41:22,141 --> 02:41:26,580
over here and right next to your face is
a whole nother world.

3301
02:41:26,850 --> 02:41:29,880
Like we couldn't even imagine that,
but that the fuck exactly what it is.

3302
02:41:30,030 --> 02:41:35,030
Have you go.
Like if you go to Santa Monica and you 

3303
02:41:35,030 --> 02:41:36,390
go over by where that peer as and you 
just walk along that sand and just start

3304
02:41:36,391 --> 02:41:41,391
walking out into that water.
You're in another world in like 20 

3305
02:41:41,391 --> 02:41:44,661
steps.
You're and you're over your head and 

3306
02:41:44,661 --> 02:41:44,661
you're in another dimension that you 
can't survive in.

3307
02:41:44,661 --> 02:41:47,340
But to get the fuck back,
it doesn't feel like you went to another

3308
02:41:47,341 --> 02:41:52,341
planet,
but you might as well have gone to 

3309
02:41:52,341 --> 02:41:52,341
another planet.
Definitely.

3310
02:41:52,341 --> 02:41:52,470
And it's right there.
One of

3311
02:41:52,470 --> 02:41:57,470
my strongest experiences of diving was 
just to tell a little story,

3312
02:41:57,631 --> 02:42:00,690
was dieting it off a tenor reef in the,
in the Canary Islands.

3313
02:42:00,870 --> 02:42:04,440
And I was down at a good 20 meters under
water,

3314
02:42:04,441 --> 02:42:09,441
let's say 70 feet.
But there was a storm that day and the 

3315
02:42:09,441 --> 02:42:13,680
huge swell on the surface was so 
powerful that it was smashing me against

3316
02:42:13,681 --> 02:42:15,340
the bottom of the sea.
Oh my God,

3317
02:42:15,540 --> 02:42:16,590
Bang,
Bang,

3318
02:42:16,650 --> 02:42:18,930
Bang.
And I just,

3319
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:22,980
that moment I realized I am.
I'm in the hands of a gigantic force,

3320
02:42:23,010 --> 02:42:27,540
but I can do absolutely nothing about.
There's nothing you can do the sea,

3321
02:42:27,541 --> 02:42:32,541
the sea for me is a goddess.
Fortunately I got over a lip and down 

3322
02:42:32,641 --> 02:42:35,220
into deeper water and it was okay for 
water.

3323
02:42:35,250 --> 02:42:37,410
Yeah.
Another 10 feet is what the fuck man.

3324
02:42:37,770 --> 02:42:41,550
How long did you have to wait it out?
That was another story.

3325
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:44,880
Um,
we stayed down for about 20,

3326
02:42:44,881 --> 02:42:47,250
25 minutes.
We then had to have to come up.

3327
02:42:47,251 --> 02:42:49,440
We'd been working quite hard at depth 
that you get through,

3328
02:42:49,441 --> 02:42:54,441
you get through your Ehr.
But what we hadn't done was recky the 

3329
02:42:54,510 --> 02:42:59,510
exit point and when we surfaced in this 
heavy swell,

3330
02:42:59,910 --> 02:43:02,010
it was extremely difficult to get out of
the sea.

3331
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:05,920
The rocks came down quite steep and we 
discussed this before you.

3332
02:43:05,921 --> 02:43:08,670
You came up at a different spot and it 
was bad.

3333
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:10,350
But anyway,
here I am,

3334
02:43:10,351 --> 02:43:12,190
I will tell the tale and

3335
02:43:12,320 --> 02:43:14,920
an older and wiser man.
Greg Fitzsimmons is a terrifying.

3336
02:43:14,921 --> 02:43:16,270
He's a good buddy of mine.
Very funny.

3337
02:43:16,271 --> 02:43:18,810
Standup comedian has a terrifying story.
He was on vacation.

3338
02:43:18,820 --> 02:43:23,820
He saw a woman drowning and he went out 
to save her and he realized that was 

3339
02:43:23,820 --> 02:43:25,590
hanging onto this woman's swim in back 
while his kids and his wife and everyone

3340
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,950
was on the shore.
And he was like,

3341
02:43:26,951 --> 02:43:31,951
Holy Shit.
Like I'm trying to save someone hear 

3342
02:43:31,951 --> 02:43:31,951
sometimes when people try to say people,
they get drowned.

3343
02:43:31,951 --> 02:43:33,870
I know happens often.
It happens often.

3344
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:34,980
Yeah,
that's it.

3345
02:43:35,130 --> 02:43:37,450
He said that the tide was a little bit 
too strong.

3346
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:39,580
Who's really spooky.
Rip Tide.

3347
02:43:39,620 --> 02:43:41,750
The sea is something to respect.
Fuck yeah.

3348
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:47,100
Something.
Something fast I had is that's a 

3349
02:43:47,100 --> 02:43:49,291
terrifying thing,
but that's my favorite thing to one of 

3350
02:43:49,291 --> 02:43:50,680
my favorite things to do at the beach 
late at night by myself.

3351
02:43:50,681 --> 02:43:51,430
Smoke a spliff.

3352
02:43:51,460 --> 02:43:53,590
Just stand out there and stare it by 
myself.

3353
02:43:54,110 --> 02:43:56,500
Puts everything in perspective.
It's just.

3354
02:43:56,501 --> 02:43:59,180
It's like the ultimate.
It's very psych,

3355
02:43:59,560 --> 02:44:01,900
not just like a duck,
but it's very isolation tank.

3356
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:07,400
Ask in a way.
It's an overwhelming amount of 

3357
02:44:07,400 --> 02:44:09,511
information,
but there's solitude and the sound and 

3358
02:44:09,511 --> 02:44:13,591
the noise that sort of drowns out the 
rest of the world doesn't totally drown 

3359
02:44:13,591 --> 02:44:17,311
it out like an isolation tank does,
but it has a partial effect because you 

3360
02:44:17,311 --> 02:44:21,391
get.
It's a moving but semi static image 

3361
02:44:21,391 --> 02:44:23,530
because it's these water waves that are 
coming at you and they're very similar,

3362
02:44:23,660 --> 02:44:28,660
so get in this very similar thing over 
and over again with very little 

3363
02:44:28,660 --> 02:44:29,290
variation and then there's the 
overwhelming number,

3364
02:44:30,160 --> 02:44:35,160
the gallons of water that's just so in 
front of you so you can't see past this 

3365
02:44:35,160 --> 02:44:37,990
fucking thing and it's dark.
So then there's the unknown,

3366
02:44:38,290 --> 02:44:39,770
the unknown,
which is the big freaker.

3367
02:44:39,940 --> 02:44:44,940
Know you're looking out this black 
monster and sometimes when it's this 

3368
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:47,581
black monster,
you get a better sense of it than when 

3369
02:44:47,581 --> 02:44:48,040
it's this beautiful blue thing during 
the day when the sun's hitting it.

3370
02:44:48,041 --> 02:44:51,370
It's reflecting because you need to give
all this visual stuff that's distracting

3371
02:44:51,371 --> 02:44:55,650
you from the fact that south Florida 
water giant fuck load of water.

3372
02:44:55,670 --> 02:44:57,700
It's right there.
And he could just go,

3373
02:44:57,820 --> 02:44:58,750
which,
yeah,

3374
02:44:58,810 --> 02:45:03,810
just come in like this and you're gone 
and everything's gone like a thousand 

3375
02:45:03,810 --> 02:45:06,700
fucking feet high waves.
That's happened before.

3376
02:45:06,770 --> 02:45:06,970
As

3377
02:45:06,970 --> 02:45:11,970
has happened before.
That's also part of the new research 

3378
02:45:11,970 --> 02:45:16,031
that I'm doing and I'm about to do a 
trip with randall cardinal crosses being

3379
02:45:16,430 --> 02:45:17,660
on your show.
Love Him.

3380
02:45:17,680 --> 02:45:18,450
Um,
you know,

3381
02:45:18,520 --> 02:45:23,520
randall was so far ahead of the curve in
recognizing that the gigantic flooding 

3382
02:45:23,520 --> 02:45:27,641
that came off the North American ice cap
wasn't just caused by what I used to 

3383
02:45:27,641 --> 02:45:31,760
think it was caused by,
which is that lakes of meltwater develop

3384
02:45:31,761 --> 02:45:33,350
on the surface of the ice cap.
And finally,

3385
02:45:33,351 --> 02:45:38,351
the dam,
the dam breaks and the melt water pours 

3386
02:45:38,351 --> 02:45:38,570
out randomly pointing out for years 
that,

3387
02:45:38,590 --> 02:45:43,590
uh,
that the water flows were much too 

3388
02:45:43,590 --> 02:45:43,590
radical for that,
something much bigger.

3389
02:45:43,590 --> 02:45:47,631
I had to be had to be involved.
So he was well ahead of the evidence 

3390
02:45:47,631 --> 02:45:51,701
when scientists began to realize that 
the North American ice cap had been hit 

3391
02:45:51,701 --> 02:45:53,750
by a comet 12,980
years ago.

3392
02:45:53,800 --> 02:45:55,400
It was set in motion,
the epoch,

3393
02:45:55,401 --> 02:45:57,940
the geologist called the younger dryas.
So run.

3394
02:45:57,941 --> 02:46:00,100
And so randall is a great expert in 
this,

3395
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:02,630
in this area.
My wife's sent this traveling with us as

3396
02:46:02,631 --> 02:46:07,631
well,
and a friend of Randall's who's worked 

3397
02:46:07,631 --> 02:46:10,211
with him for many years called Bradley.
And we're going to do a road trip from 

3398
02:46:10,211 --> 02:46:10,211
Portland,
Oregon,

3399
02:46:10,550 --> 02:46:12,670
all the way to Minneapolis,
uh,

3400
02:46:12,740 --> 02:46:14,570
following the,
it's about 2000 miles,

3401
02:46:14,571 --> 02:46:19,571
I believe,
following the southern edge of the 

3402
02:46:19,571 --> 02:46:19,700
former ice cap.
And Randall's going to show us the scars

3403
02:46:19,701 --> 02:46:23,150
and tears on the landscape of what 
happened when that ice cap was instantly

3404
02:46:23,151 --> 02:46:28,151
liquidized by a comet impact and huge 
tidal waves of water roared down,

3405
02:46:28,731 --> 02:46:29,730
off it,
across the land.

3406
02:46:30,140 --> 02:46:31,550
Lord,
going to see that,

3407
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:32,130
uh,
in,

3408
02:46:32,160 --> 02:46:34,160
in detail with Randall Real,
looking forward to doing that.

3409
02:46:34,161 --> 02:46:36,650
Also the first time I've ever crossed.
Well,

3410
02:46:36,651 --> 02:46:38,690
most of America by road.
Um,

3411
02:46:38,860 --> 02:46:41,480
I've always wanted to do that.
Certain spots shouldn't stop.

3412
02:46:42,790 --> 02:46:44,900
If you feel like you're in danger,
you're in danger.

3413
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:46,210
Get in the car.
I hit the gas.

3414
02:46:46,211 --> 02:46:51,211
Yeah.
And if you do you know what country 

3415
02:46:51,211 --> 02:46:51,211
music is.
You've got to listen to some of that.

3416
02:46:51,211 --> 02:46:51,710
Gets a hold of some country.
You got to fit in,

3417
02:46:51,720 --> 02:46:52,400
you got to blend in.

3418
02:46:52,730 --> 02:46:57,730
Can you fake southern accent?
Because if they think you're from the 

3419
02:46:57,730 --> 02:46:57,730
England,
I can do my best.

3420
02:46:57,730 --> 02:47:02,180
But from the angland they won't like him
and they want to get very upset if you 

3421
02:47:02,180 --> 02:47:02,940
go down better knows what are you dr 
who.

3422
02:47:03,530 --> 02:47:07,190
The funny thing is in England,
I often get mistaken for an American.

3423
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:08,870
Do you really?
It's weird.

3424
02:47:08,890 --> 02:47:11,420
You here nobody.
Nobody's in any doubt once I am,

3425
02:47:11,421 --> 02:47:13,310
but in England I'm officer American.
Yeah.

3426
02:47:13,311 --> 02:47:16,040
Or sometimes Canadian.
Well,

3427
02:47:16,310 --> 02:47:20,960
Canada has a bit of that.
There's like a certain amount of English

3428
02:47:20,961 --> 02:47:25,961
it sounds like in there,
the way they talk about things in a 

3429
02:47:25,961 --> 02:47:25,961
certain,
uh,

3430
02:47:25,961 --> 02:47:28,610
clear variation between them and us.
If there is definitely I even,

3431
02:47:28,611 --> 02:47:30,720
I can hear that and I've got a 10 year.
Can I,

3432
02:47:30,740 --> 02:47:32,030
can.
I can hear that too?

3433
02:47:32,360 --> 02:47:35,270
Yeah.
I can totally telecommute Canadian after

3434
02:47:35,271 --> 02:47:36,170
awhile,
but.

3435
02:47:36,170 --> 02:47:37,280
So similar.
Yeah,

3436
02:47:37,340 --> 02:47:38,660
very similar.
Very similar.

3437
02:47:38,720 --> 02:47:41,280
That's hilarious that anybody would ever
think you're American.

3438
02:47:41,281 --> 02:47:42,140
I know,
I know.

3439
02:47:42,650 --> 02:47:43,490
Anyway,
it's going to be great.

3440
02:47:43,491 --> 02:47:44,710
I'm really looking forward to this.
Boy.

3441
02:47:44,810 --> 02:47:49,810
That sounds fantastic.
It's going to take loads and loads of 

3442
02:47:49,810 --> 02:47:51,881
pictures and we're going to go up in an 
airplane a few times and look at the 

3443
02:47:51,881 --> 02:47:52,190
look at the land underneath us and is 
going to be a great,

3444
02:47:52,370 --> 02:47:57,370
exciting research trip and it's the last
research trip for this cul that I'm 

3445
02:47:57,370 --> 02:48:00,491
writing to fingerprints.
I'm sure you've seen this most recent 

3446
02:48:00,491 --> 02:48:00,580
discovery about micro diamonds.
Yeah,

3447
02:48:00,590 --> 02:48:02,870
that's exactly it.
That's precisely.

3448
02:48:02,871 --> 02:48:05,360
That is the,
that has finally settled it.

3449
02:48:05,690 --> 02:48:09,140
Any scientists who were attempting to 
argue that there wasn't a comedy impact.

3450
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:14,350
Now,
with all the evidence that's come in 

3451
02:48:14,350 --> 02:48:16,571
over the last five or six years is just 
settled by the nano diamonds scattered 

3452
02:48:16,571 --> 02:48:18,350
in a huge swathe all over the world,
which are assure,

3453
02:48:18,580 --> 02:48:21,440
a chemical imprint of a massive comet 
impact,

3454
02:48:21,770 --> 02:48:24,110
and they know a lot about it.

3455
02:48:24,110 --> 02:48:25,730
Now.
It's really very,

3456
02:48:25,731 --> 02:48:28,310
very clear,
and this was an episode that changed the

3457
02:48:28,311 --> 02:48:29,150
world,
uh,

3458
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:32,660
it killed off the many of the megafauna 
that we've all heard of,

3459
02:48:32,661 --> 02:48:34,880
the mammoth,
the woody rhinos and so on and so forth,

3460
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:39,200
and it got rid of what was called the 
clovis culture.

3461
02:48:39,201 --> 02:48:40,730
A hunter gather a culture in the United 
States.

3462
02:48:40,850 --> 02:48:45,850
And I think it got rid of a whole 
civilization that we've only remembered 

3463
02:48:45,850 --> 02:48:49,571
in myth and memory.
At least that's the line that I'm 

3464
02:48:49,571 --> 02:48:50,290
investigating.
It's a fascinating line,

3465
02:48:50,300 --> 02:48:55,300
especially when,
as each visit that you come back to the 

3466
02:48:55,300 --> 02:48:55,430
podcast,
there's new information.

3467
02:48:55,710 --> 02:49:00,710
Last time it was the nuclear glass that 
they discovered when they were doing 

3468
02:49:00,710 --> 02:49:01,160
core samples again,
which is about 12,000

3469
02:49:01,161 --> 02:49:01,940
years ago.
Right?

3470
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:03,930
And then the new one is this micro 
diamonds.

3471
02:49:03,950 --> 02:49:07,100
It seems like over and over again,
this is not.

3472
02:49:07,110 --> 02:49:08,250
It becomes not a possibility,

3473
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:10,200
but a reality that there was some sort 
of an impact,

3474
02:49:10,201 --> 02:49:12,830
something gigantic happened,
but all over the world and right.

3475
02:49:12,870 --> 02:49:16,560
It wasn't just all over the world.
It was massive in America,

3476
02:49:16,561 --> 02:49:21,561
but it was the effect was everywhere.
Both impacts because this comment broke 

3477
02:49:21,561 --> 02:49:21,990
up into fragments like she would make a 
levy nine,

3478
02:49:22,290 --> 02:49:25,920
both impacts,
but also very important,

3479
02:49:25,980 --> 02:49:29,400
the gigantic cloud of dust that's thrown
up into the upper atmosphere,

3480
02:49:29,640 --> 02:49:34,640
which then so you have this immediate 
reaction of flooding as the comment 

3481
02:49:34,640 --> 02:49:34,770
liquidiser as part of the North American
ice cap.

3482
02:49:34,771 --> 02:49:38,790
And then a huge dust plume is up in the 
air all over the world.

3483
02:49:38,791 --> 02:49:43,560
And the whole earth is shrouded in dust 
as cool and cool because it's reflecting

3484
02:49:43,561 --> 02:49:46,680
back the sun's rays.
So we go into this 1,300,

3485
02:49:46,750 --> 02:49:51,750
1000,
400 year period called the younger 

3486
02:49:51,750 --> 02:49:51,750
Dryas,
uh,

3487
02:49:51,750 --> 02:49:55,010
where the earth gets incredibly cold 
even though previously it had been 

3488
02:49:55,010 --> 02:49:58,161
coming out of the,
out of the ice is truly are gigantic 

3489
02:49:58,161 --> 02:49:58,161
event.

3490
02:49:58,161 --> 02:49:58,740
And then weirdly,
all our history,

3491
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:03,800
everything we think of as our past 
begins at the end of the younger dryas 

3492
02:50:03,800 --> 02:50:05,880
around it kicks in 12,000,
980 years ago,

3493
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:07,560
ends 11,000,
600 years ago.

3494
02:50:07,770 --> 02:50:12,770
The Earth begins to want,
begins to warm up again and everything 

3495
02:50:12,770 --> 02:50:15,210
we know about ourselves or can claim we 
know unfolds in that last 11,000,

3496
02:50:15,211 --> 02:50:17,790
600 years and the period before the 
younger dryas,

3497
02:50:17,940 --> 02:50:20,880
we really blank on so much of it.
It's so fascinating.

3498
02:50:20,940 --> 02:50:21,900
I send it again.
Shit.

3499
02:50:23,100 --> 02:50:26,940
It's amazing that all this information 
keeps coming up to support this.

3500
02:50:27,150 --> 02:50:32,150
And it's amazing.
If we do consider the possibility that 

3501
02:50:32,150 --> 02:50:35,151
it is true,
that everything can be essentially shut 

3502
02:50:35,151 --> 02:50:38,301
back down to zero with some rocks from 
the sky and that that's something that 

3503
02:50:38,301 --> 02:50:40,720
we really need to get in our head that 
could happen there.

3504
02:50:40,880 --> 02:50:44,070
There is a very distinct possibility 
that we could be hit by something.

3505
02:50:44,850 --> 02:50:48,150
The NASA photographs of the,
I think they call it the black diamond,

3506
02:50:48,151 --> 02:50:48,960
the earth at night.

3507
02:50:49,560 --> 02:50:54,560
Okay.
What you see is certain areas of the 

3508
02:50:54,560 --> 02:50:56,940
world a brightly lit up Europe,
North America for example,

3509
02:50:57,660 --> 02:51:02,660
on the other hand,
Africa and large parts of South America 

3510
02:51:02,660 --> 02:51:06,950
are dark because there's no 
electrification in those areas and those

3511
02:51:07,051 --> 02:51:11,640
photographs are often taken to say to 
speak of our achievement,

3512
02:51:11,790 --> 02:51:13,580
look how we can light up the planet like
a,

3513
02:51:13,820 --> 02:51:18,820
like a Christmas tree,
so that it can be viewed from viewed 

3514
02:51:18,820 --> 02:51:22,011
from space.
But I would say it also says another 

3515
02:51:22,011 --> 02:51:24,831
thing that if we had,
if we were to confront again the same 

3516
02:51:24,831 --> 02:51:27,240
sort of cataclysm that hit the earth 
12,000,

3517
02:51:27,241 --> 02:51:32,241
980 years ago,
then the people who would survive and 

3518
02:51:32,241 --> 02:51:35,841
carry the human story forward would be 
those very people who live in the dark 

3519
02:51:35,841 --> 02:51:37,020
areas,
the areas that aren't electrified.

3520
02:51:37,170 --> 02:51:42,170
And we who live in the glowing lights 
that show up on those NASA photographs 

3521
02:51:43,100 --> 02:51:48,100
who've become so specialized,
who most of us are unable even to know 

3522
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:48,300
how to plant a vegetable or,
or,

3523
02:51:48,301 --> 02:51:50,670
or hunt an animal.
We're the ones who would,

3524
02:51:50,750 --> 02:51:52,650
uh,
who would be gone and the whole order of

3525
02:51:52,651 --> 02:51:55,680
the world would be reversed.
Whoa.

3526
02:51:55,740 --> 02:51:57,960
So the world would become like an Arrow 
Oscar culture.

3527
02:51:57,961 --> 02:51:59,970
You'd have all these fucking people from
the Amazon.

3528
02:51:59,971 --> 02:52:02,070
That would be fine because they're fed,
they're fine,

3529
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:04,560
they'd be absolutely fine.
They know how to survive,

3530
02:52:04,680 --> 02:52:05,620
you know,
they know,

3531
02:52:05,680 --> 02:52:06,070
they know how

3532
02:52:06,070 --> 02:52:07,450
to do it.
So again,

3533
02:52:07,451 --> 02:52:12,451
I think the message of this is we 
shouldn't be arrogant and complacent in 

3534
02:52:12,451 --> 02:52:15,961
the achievements of our civilization.
We have done wonderful and amazing 

3535
02:52:15,961 --> 02:52:18,721
things as well as terrible things,
but we shouldn't be arrogant or 

3536
02:52:18,721 --> 02:52:22,111
complacent about it.
We should recognize it's all very 

3537
02:52:22,111 --> 02:52:22,111
fragile.
It can be taken away from us at anytime.

3538
02:52:22,111 --> 02:52:24,520
We can take it away from ourselves 
without a doubt.

3539
02:52:24,521 --> 02:52:26,230
The information is something to 
consider.

3540
02:52:26,290 --> 02:52:30,460
Just the information about these,
these impacts.

3541
02:52:30,970 --> 02:52:35,970
It's something to consider and it's also
something to consider that if that's 

3542
02:52:35,970 --> 02:52:39,691
correct,
for what a magical time it must have 

3543
02:52:39,691 --> 02:52:42,631
been back when they had developed some 
sort of technology that was enabling 

3544
02:52:43,961 --> 02:52:48,961
them to make structures like go Beckley 
tap is why I'm magicians of the gods 

3545
02:52:48,961 --> 02:52:52,330
because there's something magical.
Something about it that we would,

3546
02:52:52,390 --> 02:52:57,310
we would call magic perhaps was just 
another another form of science.

3547
02:52:57,430 --> 02:52:57,690
Well,
yeah,

3548
02:52:57,740 --> 02:52:59,860
whatever they were able to do.
I mean,

3549
02:52:59,890 --> 02:53:01,900
it's amazing that we haven't figured it 
out yet,

3550
02:53:01,901 --> 02:53:06,901
but we're so arrogant in our assumptions
that it had to be all the ways that 

3551
02:53:06,901 --> 02:53:08,140
we've already figured out.
He's so silly,

3552
02:53:08,480 --> 02:53:11,730
like isn't there some shit we haven't 
figured out exactly like this new,

3553
02:53:11,830 --> 02:53:16,830
this new ability to.
They've just found out that they've 

3554
02:53:16,830 --> 02:53:19,860
taken people and they've used the 
internet to send information for more 

3555
02:53:19,860 --> 02:53:20,590
person's mind or another person saying 
that 5,000

3556
02:53:20,591 --> 02:53:22,240
miles away.
It's incredible,

3557
02:53:22,510 --> 02:53:25,900
but nobody else did that before that and
so we didn't really think that that was.

3558
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:28,390
We thought maybe it'd be a possibility,
but now we know it's possibility.

3559
02:53:28,960 --> 02:53:33,960
Whatever the fuck they did to make these
pyramids like just because we haven't 

3560
02:53:33,960 --> 02:53:37,591
figured it out yet,
it doesn't mean that we're using wooden 

3561
02:53:37,591 --> 02:53:39,721
rollers,
like they could have had some really 

3562
02:53:39,721 --> 02:53:40,130
incredible technology that we don't have
a trace of it anymore.

3563
02:53:40,130 --> 02:53:45,130
We're looking at a full of technology 
that we don't recognize as exactly 

3564
02:53:45,130 --> 02:53:45,910
because we're.
We're programmed thinking about entirely

3565
02:53:45,911 --> 02:53:50,911
on our own terms and it's almost like 
the universe is giving us a puzzle that 

3566
02:53:50,911 --> 02:53:55,711
so incredibly in your face with its most
obvious results and because because we 

3567
02:53:58,961 --> 02:54:03,961
have these preconceived notions that 
we're not willing to accept that as a 

3568
02:54:03,961 --> 02:54:05,170
possibility.
Like when people look at the pyramids,

3569
02:54:05,171 --> 02:54:05,710
they go,
well,

3570
02:54:05,890 --> 02:54:10,890
you know,
the thing is they build ramps and they 

3571
02:54:10,890 --> 02:54:12,490
use stone rowers and like there's a 
whole faction who will look for the most

3572
02:54:12,491 --> 02:54:14,510
boring,
meaningless might've,

3573
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:16,800
but they might've done it,
but they might've done that.

3574
02:54:16,810 --> 02:54:21,810
But the fact that that there are large 
groups of people whose mission is to 

3575
02:54:21,810 --> 02:54:23,110
look for the most boring rather than the
most extraordinary possibility.

3576
02:54:23,230 --> 02:54:25,750
It's good.
That's how we have bonds in our society.

3577
02:54:25,751 --> 02:54:26,770
We do need to look.

3578
02:54:26,800 --> 02:54:31,800
We do need to look with a skeptical eye 
and say that there could be mundane 

3579
02:54:31,800 --> 02:54:33,160
explanations for this,
but we also need to keep a tiny fraction

3580
02:54:33,161 --> 02:54:38,161
of our research effort.
Perhaps a very small fraction indeed to 

3581
02:54:38,161 --> 02:54:42,410
exploring alternative alternative ideas.
Because every night if they do come out 

3582
02:54:42,410 --> 02:54:46,741
right,
they change everything in the way that 

3583
02:54:46,741 --> 02:54:49,381
the mundane things don't and it's really
worthwhile and the only thing I'm 

3584
02:54:49,381 --> 02:54:52,960
understand why I've been subjected to so
much criticism and I welcome it,

3585
02:54:52,961 --> 02:54:56,170
I've I've learnt a great deal from that 
criticism,

3586
02:54:56,230 --> 02:55:01,230
but is it wise for us to live in a 
society which is hostile to the 

3587
02:55:01,230 --> 02:55:02,920
exploration of extraordinary 
possibilities?

3588
02:55:02,930 --> 02:55:04,220
Shouldn't we actually protect

3589
02:55:04,220 --> 02:55:09,220
that and make that something which,
which we encourage those who wish to do 

3590
02:55:09,220 --> 02:55:13,391
so in our society to do just on the off 
chance that they might come up with 

3591
02:55:13,391 --> 02:55:17,021
something utterly world changing,
especially if it's done with careful 

3592
02:55:17,021 --> 02:55:20,111
consideration like you've done or 
especially like with Randall Crawson's 

3593
02:55:20,111 --> 02:55:22,520
done with asteroidal impacts is 
absolutely stunning and fascinating.

3594
02:55:22,850 --> 02:55:27,850
I mean,
and what he's done is done with very 

3595
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:27,850
careful consideration.
Absolutely rattles real.

3596
02:55:27,850 --> 02:55:31,600
He's a real scholar,
real thorough researcher and 

3597
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:33,641
investigator and he was awesome.
And the podcasts wasn't one of my all 

3598
02:55:33,641 --> 02:55:33,641
time favorites.
Right?

3599
02:55:33,641 --> 02:55:33,770
Yet these,
these ideas are fascinating,

3600
02:55:33,771 --> 02:55:37,820
but what I was gonna say was that it's 
almost like the number is so large,

3601
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,440
like 2 million,
300,000

3602
02:55:39,441 --> 02:55:41,900
stones in the Great Pyramid,
which is so bizarre.

3603
02:55:41,901 --> 02:55:43,610
The numbers in tons.
Yeah.

3604
02:55:43,611 --> 02:55:48,611
The number of 50 to 70 tons roofing.
The king's chamber elevated to heights 

3605
02:55:49,071 --> 02:55:50,900
of 300 feet above the ground.

3606
02:55:51,360 --> 02:55:53,660
It's almost perfectly aligned to true 
north,

3607
02:55:53,661 --> 02:55:58,661
south,
east and West within a fraction of a 

3608
02:55:58,661 --> 02:55:58,661
single degree.
You know,

3609
02:55:58,661 --> 02:56:01,460
so crazy that the like if they could 
come back from,

3610
02:56:01,490 --> 02:56:04,640
from the past and if they come to our 
time today and go,

3611
02:56:04,641 --> 02:56:06,250
wait a minute,
how did you guys think we did that?

3612
02:56:06,830 --> 02:56:09,770
You think we use slaves?
Oh my God.

3613
02:56:09,771 --> 02:56:10,750
That's so funny.
Yeah,

3614
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:12,320
yeah.
You've got to come over here,

3615
02:56:12,321 --> 02:56:13,340
man.
Tell him,

3616
02:56:13,400 --> 02:56:14,900
tell him how you think we made the 
pyramids.

3617
02:56:15,290 --> 02:56:17,450
Slaves on would get the fuck out of 
here.

3618
02:56:17,451 --> 02:56:18,860
Yeah,
exactly.

3619
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:22,310
Like laughing like you guys haven't 
invented this magneto thing yet and it's

3620
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:26,810
something that allows you to turn to you
turn things with staff with sound.

3621
02:56:26,990 --> 02:56:31,990
Yeah.
You don't know how to manifest things 

3622
02:56:31,990 --> 02:56:33,730
out of the air.
I don't know how to exercise the 

3623
02:56:33,730 --> 02:56:35,030
majestic and incredible power of your 
mind just running out of time.

3624
02:56:35,030 --> 02:56:37,160
We are unfortunately running out of 
time.

3625
02:56:37,250 --> 02:56:38,130
Can I say it again?
Yes,

3626
02:56:38,150 --> 02:56:40,010
please.
Because I am a big playlist.

3627
02:56:40,070 --> 02:56:41,210
Please,
please,

3628
02:56:41,240 --> 02:56:44,030
if anybody out there we'd like to take 
me up on this offer.

3629
02:56:44,031 --> 02:56:47,780
Just go to Graham Hancock.com.
Go to the war God page,

3630
02:56:47,781 --> 02:56:50,240
which you'll find easily.
Scroll down and see what to write to me,

3631
02:56:50,241 --> 02:56:53,330
but I have to repeat again.
I will send you the book plates,

3632
02:56:53,331 --> 02:56:58,331
but I can't correspond.
Correspond and it will be November 

3633
02:56:58,331 --> 02:57:02,171
before I'm in a position to send the 
book plates because I'm on the road 

3634
02:57:02,171 --> 02:57:02,420
continuously until the 27th Graham 
Hancock Dot Com.

3635
02:57:02,660 --> 02:57:03,940
Graham Hancock Dotcom.
I.

3636
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:09,000
My goal is to make this so successful 
that you never make another offer ever 

3637
02:57:09,021 --> 02:57:11,210
again.
I wanna I wanna ruin you.

3638
02:57:12,610 --> 02:57:16,550
You can't sign all these things.
Too many coming in and you're like,

3639
02:57:16,551 --> 02:57:18,170
what the fuck am I doing?
Why Am I.

3640
02:57:18,270 --> 02:57:19,790
I can't do this.
This is my whole life now,

3641
02:57:20,100 --> 02:57:22,070
so now it's.
This would be the last one.

3642
02:57:22,310 --> 02:57:24,020
I think it'll probably be the last one.
By the way,

3643
02:57:24,021 --> 02:57:29,021
this.
There's chapters to read free online on 

3644
02:57:29,021 --> 02:57:31,271
the [inaudible] page as well,
so I'm not asking people to buy sight 

3645
02:57:31,271 --> 02:57:33,641
unseen.
They can have a look beautiful and your 

3646
02:57:33,641 --> 02:57:33,641
book,
fingerprints of the Gods.

3647
02:57:33,641 --> 02:57:36,611
I've said it before when you've been on 
the podcast for changed my single 

3648
02:57:36,611 --> 02:57:37,940
handedly changed my ideas about history,
changed my ideas,

3649
02:57:37,941 --> 02:57:42,941
not just not in any way discounting the 
amazing work that traditional 

3650
02:57:42,941 --> 02:57:47,800
traditional historians have done,
but just that these things exist that 

3651
02:57:47,800 --> 02:57:52,151
defy explanation and that I didn't know.
Just the fact that there is a guy from 

3652
02:57:52,151 --> 02:57:56,860
Boston University named Robert Shaw 
who's a prominent geologists who said 

3653
02:57:56,860 --> 02:57:58,760
this is clear erosion and there was last
time there was rosie was 9,000

3654
02:57:58,761 --> 02:58:00,380
BC,
like you're talking about.

3655
02:58:00,381 --> 02:58:05,381
An insane amount of time has passed 
since there was thousands of years of 

3656
02:58:05,381 --> 02:58:06,030
that rain fall.
By the way,

3657
02:58:06,031 --> 02:58:08,610
you needed thousands of years to do what
we see on this.

3658
02:58:08,850 --> 02:58:12,440
This isn't wind like this is some crazy 
shit and that's what I try to do.

3659
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:17,720
Fingerprints was to bring together 
people like John Anthony West who 

3660
02:58:17,720 --> 02:58:17,780
brought Robert show up to this fixate,
Robert Duvall,

3661
02:58:17,790 --> 02:58:18,780
like random rose,
phlegm,

3662
02:58:18,781 --> 02:58:20,490
math,
a lot of researchers who were working in

3663
02:58:20,491 --> 02:58:25,491
the field and coming out with 
extraordinary information and part of 

3664
02:58:25,491 --> 02:58:27,561
what I did in that book was was to bring
all that information together into a 

3665
02:58:27,561 --> 02:58:27,561
kind of synthesis.
I suppose

3666
02:58:27,561 --> 02:58:31,680
it's such an interesting theory and it's
such an interesting subject and now that

3667
02:58:31,681 --> 02:58:34,650
it seeps getting substantiated by places
like go Beckley,

3668
02:58:34,651 --> 02:58:38,160
tappy or these micro meteors that sort 
of piece the puzzle together.

3669
02:58:38,161 --> 02:58:40,560
Slowly but surely,
I think as time goes on,

3670
02:58:40,561 --> 02:58:43,410
we're going to find there's going to be 
a bunch of civilizations that we uncover

3671
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:48,590
those ones that are finding in Mexico,
and then of course there's ones that 

3672
02:58:48,590 --> 02:58:51,831
they're finding in the Amazon with a 
thing just like we were talking about 

3673
02:58:51,831 --> 02:58:55,030
the other.
They find a hill and they think it's a 

3674
02:58:55,030 --> 02:58:55,030
hill,
and then someone realized.

3675
02:58:55,030 --> 02:58:55,030
I was like,
Holy Shit,

3676
02:58:55,030 --> 02:58:55,660
this is a.
This is a building guys.

3677
02:58:55,710 --> 02:58:58,170
Huge earthworks in the Amazon stone 
circles.

3678
02:58:58,410 --> 02:59:03,410
You know?
That's another place to look for a lost 

3679
02:59:03,410 --> 02:59:03,410
civilization.

3680
02:59:03,410 --> 02:59:03,410
We're out of time.
That's it,

3681
02:59:03,410 --> 02:59:04,080
right?
Or we're dying.

3682
02:59:04,260 --> 02:59:05,430
We're dying.
How much time we have.

3683
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:08,300
It's counting down.
How much time give me seconds.

3684
02:59:08,340 --> 02:59:09,300
Less than a man.
Alright.

3685
02:59:09,360 --> 02:59:10,500
Thank you.
Thank you Graham.

3686
