00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,300
So a tab your arm and I
slept on the floor at Chata.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:41,000
Tag Out.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,100
No team makes me sad.

12
00:00:46,101 --> 00:00:46,934
I know.

13
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,080
Now I'm the jealous

14
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,200

Yeah,

16
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,580
I can be angry.

17
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,983
Ooh.

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,830
My hands and knees,

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:09,490

Make me a fan.

25
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,463
Friends.

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:34,110
Seventies.

27
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,680
My innocence in the hands.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:38,873
Whole,

29
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,330
the skin.

30
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,170
The taste.

31
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,420
Even my hips just throw.

32
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:44,190
Oh yeah.

33
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,920
And then I'll give them my time.

34
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,070
Waste.

35
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,450
Praise your name.

40
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,293
Nice.

41
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,500

Oh,

51
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,570

52
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,550
Good.

Waiting for [inaudible].

56
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,960
Feel confused.

57
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,370
Feels like a trainwreck.
