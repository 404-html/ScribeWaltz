1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,500
Can we go for three to Henry Rollins?
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,900
how are you fella?
I'm better now being here with you.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,853
I'm better now that you're here.
We were just talking about a show that 

4
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:17,610
you've got you and Ted nugent.
Apparently someone.

5
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:18,750
Did someone.
Did you pitch it?

6
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,450
Who pitched the show?
It was an idea that uh,

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,060
my manager,
Heidi and I came up with,

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,460
well mostly Heidi.
It was like,

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,480
it was called basically Henry and uh,
you put me and someone I might have some

10
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,314
disagreements with or a few agreements 
with and we just go somewhere and we 

11
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:35,814
weigh in with a camera following us and 
we're thinking what it'll be like a six 

12
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,830
part mini series like me and plus six 
interesting people.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,160
And one of the names that came up with 
Ted nugent because I,

14
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,403
I'm a fan of his music,
I think is one of the best guitar 

15
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:52,380
players I've ever seen yet.

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,860
He and I would probably disagree on one 
or a few topics.

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,663
And so we actually picked,
pitched it to Ted who said he loved the 

18
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,000
idea,
but he said,

19
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,490
I got to go.
I'm busy with a,

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,020
he had a ton of tour dates.
I think he's on now,

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,680
but he said I want to talk to henry to 
thank him for thinking of me.

22
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:14,723
Okay.
And so ted called like on my phone in 

23
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:20,910
the office,
I guess he got my number from the powers

24
00:01:20,911 --> 00:01:25,500
that be and suddenly it's,
it's Ted on my phone.

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:27,150
I'm at my desk like,
okay,

26
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:27,984
this is surreal.
And we talked for a few minutes and he 

27
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,364
said,
uh,

28
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,990
you know,
like,

29
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,100
what do you think?
I'm a bad guy.

30
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,120
I'm like,
no,

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,970
I just,
some of the things you say,

32
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:42,804
I just kind of takes my breath away.
And then we quickly got on the topic of 

33
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,300
music.

34
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:50,160
He said,
you like all that old Detroit music?

35
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:51,210
I go,
yeah man,

36
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,660
I mean you,
Mitch Ryder the stooges,

37
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,060
Mc five.
I mean it's kind of the best.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,180
Some of the best music I've ever heard.
I mean,

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,890
as far I asked him,
I go,

40
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,510
what is it?
Is something in the water?

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,460
What is it with you,
Michigan guys?

42
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:09,390
And Guitar Tone.
Like no one gets tone like you,

43
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,730
Ron,
Ashton stooges,

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,770
Fred Sonic,
Smith,

45
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:14,730
MC five.
I go,

46
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:15,460
you guys,
I mean,

47
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,550
you're so good.
And he said,

48
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:20,460
you gotta we gotta hang out some time 
and we'll just talk about music.

49
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,110
I want,
I'll do that with you.

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,290
So I'll be taking notes.
And he was just telling me,

51
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,131
you know,
like,

52
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:28,110
yeah,
he used to hang out at the MC five house

53
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:31,470
and go see the stooges and I'm like,
you're killing me because this is like,

54
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:32,304
you know,
I,

55
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,213
that would have been heaven for me to 
see those bands like back in 1969 or 

56
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:38,400
whatever.

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,660
Did you.
When did you know him?

58
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,110
Did you know him back in the day?
Only recently as a punter.

59
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,063
I would go see him like in high school 
in the 18 seventies to Neil Carter 

60
00:02:46,711 --> 00:02:50,490
administration.
I'd go see him at play in my local arena

61
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,100
in Washington dc in a place called the 
capital center in Largo,

62
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:56,970
Maryland.
And he was as good as rock'n'roll gets.

63
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,790
I mean it was,
I saw the,

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,260
the double life Gonzo lineup and like,
forget it.

65
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:07,210
It was like two and a half hours of just
getting beat up by music.

66
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,044
It was fantastic and to this day it's 
still a high watermark as far as gigs 

67
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,733
and in the nineties I met him on 
politically incorrect Bill Maher and I 

68
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,130
said,
hey man,

69
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:24,310
I'm a big fan,
and he gave me a bowhunting catalog.

70
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,173
I'm like,
well,

71
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,570
you know,
for his whack master,

72
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:31,600
you know,
you get the croquet mallet and the.

73
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,630
Anyway,
I kept it,

74
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,583
I tell them a fan and then I met him 
years later and I did this radio show 

75
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,194
like St Patrick's Day,
1997 to Kressley promote my next record 

76
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,963
and I said we met years ago and we got 
to talking for like a couple of hours 

77
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,270
and we,
it was just about music and I played him

78
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,390
some of my new record which you really 
liked and he,

79
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,300
between the commercial breaks he was 
like playing riffs for me.

80
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,134
We had little headphone amp and he was 
sitting across from me on a stool 

81
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,570
playing and I'm like,
this is pretty cool.

82
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,880
And so that's the kind of relationship I
have with him where I,

83
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,530
you know,
you read some of the things he says,

84
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:12,041
you're like,
okay,

85
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:16,840
that's really hard to take and but those
records are,

86
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:17,683
they're just so good to me.
And I saw him play in 2000 opening for 

87
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:22,930
kiss 2001 somewhere in there.

88
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,120
And he was great.
Great.

89
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,940
The tone,
the playing just fantastic.

90
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,750
And so he's just an interesting,
a bunch of guys,

91
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,640
a bunch of guys,
you know what I mean?

92
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,490
Cause like he can finish a sentence.
He's not,

93
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,440
he's not,
he's not stupid.

94
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,070
He's hilarious.
He has a steel trap memory.

95
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,250
But then he'll just say,
you know,

96
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,600
the Obama's as subhuman,
Hmong girl,

97
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:46,961
like,
man,

98
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:51,640
you don't need to talk like that because
there's people you will inspire to punch

99
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:55,060
some black guy in the parking lot for no
reason.

100
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Like something bad could happen if you 
talk like that to the millions of people

101
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,204
who love you.
Like someone will get that message and 

102
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:06,040
they'll go south with it.
And when you're in that position,

103
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,874
I don't believe in self censorship,
but I think you should be careful of 

104
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,914
what you say.
I think there's some merit in having 

105
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,630
some control of yourself.

106
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,800
And so I don't completely understand the
guy,

107
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,920
this currency and outrageousness that's 
what it is.

108
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:26,800
And you cash in by being the God that 
says things he can't.

109
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,693
I can't believe what he just said.
And then you become the guy that goes 

110
00:05:30,521 --> 00:05:33,130
places that says things that no one can 
believe that you're saying.

111
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:33,701
You know,
I,

112
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:34,534
I know that there's some people that's 
how they get their next book deal or 

113
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,900
whatever,
you know,

114
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,123
for myself,
I would never want to trade in that 

115
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,183
because my,
my reality coming up through punk rock 

116
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:45,484
and all of that is very,
very immediate in that I don't say 

117
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:52,660
anything about anybody without expecting
them to hear it.

118
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:56,800
And with me turning the next corner,
like going to my car in your parking lot

119
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,980
and having that

120
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,890
person waiting for me at the car saying,
hey,

121
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,173
you said this.
And having the meal to hold it up on a 

122
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,903
tablet and say.
And so I watch what I say because in my 

123
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:14,720
mind I answer,
I will have to answer to all of it.

124
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,990
And so I would never say something where
someone going really well,

125
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:22,991
today's the day we're going to see who 
can kick his ass because you know,

126
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,420
men have this wrong idea that they can't
be beat.

127
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,340
Are you kidding?
Anyone could get knocked on their ass.

128
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,400
You think you're tough.
There's always,

129
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:32,990
you know,
you're in the business of tough guys.

130
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,190
There's always a tougher guy around the 
corner of guy.

131
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,890
But more than that,
it's like you don't,

132
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,040
most of the conflict that you get and 
when you talk and shit about somebody,

133
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,874
like someone like you or I can do an 
interview and talk shit about someone 

134
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,800
and didn't go public and you don't think
twice about it.

135
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,633
But then now it extends to social media 
and potentially anybody could do it at 

136
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,040
any time.
And it just seems so easy to do.

137
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,450
But I always tried to think if that 
person was in front of me,

138
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,190
how is that treated?
And if I would,

139
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,140
if I would say,
fuck this guy,

140
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,160
like when he's in front of me,
then this is,

141
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I have a real problem with this person.
It's a real bad.

142
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,253
I would always wait until I was in front
of that person and I have waited and 

143
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,630
bided my time with people that don't 
like.

144
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,660
And you get into a conversation.
And all I have said,

145
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,660
you know,
very calmly,

146
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,840
I,
I think you're ridiculous person.

147
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,330
I think you're a standing,
walking,

148
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,253
talking billboard for cowardice.
Something that people need to hear that 

149
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:24,584
too.
Because sometimes people don't hear 

150
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,230
that.
They don't hear that from someone.

151
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,150
I'm not trying to help the guy but 
believe me.

152
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,800
But I waited until I was there.
The only people I'll rip on it,

153
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,603
our politicians,
like some member of Congress I think is 

154
00:07:40,221 --> 00:07:43,030
just an inactive waste of food.
Um,

155
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,370
that'll say anywhere,
hoping it'll bring him to me.

156
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:52,280
So I can say it to his or her face.
But for the most part,

157
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,563
the way I was brought up in the world of
music and the street is if you say 

158
00:07:58,731 --> 00:07:59,564
something,
that guy will be lining you up for a 

159
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,014
broken jaw so you better mean it,
but maybe just wait until you guys are 

160
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,550
in a room and see what you really want 
to say.

161
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,663
Cause Sniping from a windowless room 
from somewhere or being a a keyboard 

162
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,570
activist.
That's not.

163
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:23,180
That doesn't mean much to me.
Yeah.

164
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,130
I think,
you know,

165
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:29,140
ted is the spokesperson for the right in
that he's this contrast in so many ways.

166
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,290
He's just wild and it used to be long 
hair.

167
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,124
He doesn't have long hair anymore,
but long haired guitar player from 

168
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,810
Michigan.
I mean he's Ted nugent.

169
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:39,644
He should be this.
He shouldn't be a drug user or 

170
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:41,751
something.
Right.

171
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:44,510
It should be on tour all the time,
but he's the opposite.

172
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:46,490
He was like,
doesn't do any drugs,

173
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,503
doesn't drink.
And he's super right wing and he 

174
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:52,100
supports the second amendment and guns 
and he,

175
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,963
there's,
he's in this group of and he has some 

176
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:58,080
very strong beliefs that he really does 
hold in that group.

177
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,153
But then comes the outrageous stuff that
he says and you would get a 

178
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,220
mischaracterization of him because of 
some of the things he says.

179
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:08,280
But if you meet him in person,
person to person,

180
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,114
he's a great guy.
I talked to them all the time that 

181
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,280
texted each other,
only been my experience with him.

182
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,133
Great guy is.
I've had really cool conversations with 

183
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,770
him and I'm a hyper fan of the records.
I mean,

184
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,380
it's Gospel to me that those records are
in my dna.

185
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,210
I don't fit.
I'm with you.

186
00:09:24,211 --> 00:09:27,260
And that I don't know what fuels those 
and I just don't get it.

187
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,450
I'm not here to rip on him.
I just honestly do not.

188
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,373
I can't reconcile that conversations I 
had were super friendly and happy that 

189
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:40,560
you're a fan of the guy and then you 
watch some things.

190
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:41,280
He says,
uh,

191
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,930
you know,
on some stage somewhere you're like,

192
00:09:42,931 --> 00:09:43,764
wow,
that's,

193
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,460
that's as bummed that my whole evening,
that's like,

194
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,890
okay,
that's you,

195
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:51,480
that's the first amendment.
Go do your thing.

196
00:09:51,481 --> 00:09:52,171
But like,
wow,

197
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,900
that's this currency in that though,
I really think that,

198
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:57,840
that getting that charge out of it,
saying that outrageous thing.

199
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,880
It keeps the ball rolling in some way.

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,920
It's not a ball I'd want to roll though.
I don't want to.

201
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,660
This doesn't seem sustainable.
Uh,

202
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,323
speaking of sustainable,
are you have a showtime special coming 

203
00:10:08,551 --> 00:10:09,600
out tomorrow night?
Wow.

204
00:10:09,601 --> 00:10:11,120
That was a great segue.
It's pretty good.

205
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:12,023
That was good.
I've actually got a radio real radio 

206
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:17,400
show.
Yeah.

207
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,590
Yeah.
Just wanted sequitur Rogan.

208
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,620
Grip it on Ted.
Yeah.

209
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,553
Yeah.
So do I.

210
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,500
A showtime special tomorrow.
Friday.

211
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,000
What's tomorrow?
The oled attempt?

212
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,834
The 10th.
Sorry,

213
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:33,540
a Friday,
August 10th,

214
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,740
10:00 PM.
East Coast,

215
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:37,350
west coast showtime.
It's called keep talking pell.

216
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,830
And so the,
there it is a 10 seconds on that.

217
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:41,940
They said,
what are you going to name it?

218
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,830
And I said,
keep talking.

219
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,221
Pow.
They go,

220
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,510
what does that mean?
It's just,

221
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,730
it's how you talk to yourself in and out
of trouble,

222
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,600
like you're about to get punched out.
Like keep talking pal.

223
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,960
If you don't get a laugh,
you're not getting out of this bar.

224
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:00,920
And that's kind of how I came into 
talking shows was being as a young guy,

225
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,090
skinny,
unwritten,

226
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,790
not a good fighter,
not a good fighter at all,

227
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,050
you know,
just not into it.

228
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,090
And you know,
the local bully,

229
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:09,924
I've said something snarky or funny and 
all of a sudden he's got me by the 

230
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,344
scruff of my shirt with a fist in my 
face and the only thing you can do is 

231
00:11:16,471 --> 00:11:17,304
like imitate him so much that everyone 
else laughs and he has to drop you 

232
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:22,340
because he's now like drop will drop 
your collar,

233
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,320
not your body.
Um,

234
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,510
because you're now making him laugh.
And so when in doubt,

235
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,373
keep talking pal.
And the fact that I have a quote comedy 

236
00:11:31,321 --> 00:11:32,154
special on showtime is so unlikely from 
some guy from the minimum wage working 

237
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:37,830
world,
I don't believe it myself.

238
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
And so they said,
what are you going to call at night?

239
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,990
A lot of these people,
they have a lot of confidence like going

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,980
to call it like just me and my mighty 
Wang take this is.

241
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:47,814
I don't have any of that.
So like keep talking because I know I'm 

242
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:54,220
really not supposed to be there.
So how did you do your first show?

243
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,053
Like what?
What made you do your first talking 

244
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,280
show?
$5.

245
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,393
Nineteen 83.
A little venue on Hudson right off of 

246
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,140
like about 10 paces north of Santa 
Monica Boulevard.

247
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,720
It's like treat the dead ends onto Santa
Monica Boulevard.

248
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:08,743
It was an art space.
They're called the Lasa club and there 

249
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:12,904
was a local promoter in town,
amazing guy and he would get like 25 

250
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,124
people on stage in one night.
Everyone gets five minutes and it'd be 

251
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,450
the singer of that band,
the drummer of that band,

252
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,100
that artists,
that poet,

253
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,023
like real artists who speak for a living
and then the guy with the funny tour 

254
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,453
journal or the guy from the band that we
all like and he's going to be an idiot 

255
00:12:31,421 --> 00:12:34,160
for five minutes and these shows were 
really fun because it just.

256
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,193
People are offstage all night long,
like running off stage and the bass 

257
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:43,390
player and black flag truck to Koski fed
fantastic intellect.

258
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,373
He would get invited onto these bills.
I would go with him because we were 

259
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,720
beach guys.
We lived in the sticks and the gigs were

260
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:50,554
in Hollywood,
so we'll go into the big smoke will go 

261
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:52,774
see the big city.
I'd go with him because he had the band 

262
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,590
van.
He'd go into town,

263
00:12:56,591 --> 00:12:59,990
I'd tag along,
so he'd read out of some notebook,

264
00:12:59,991 --> 00:13:04,120
has apocalyptic rantings and one night 
the promoter said,

265
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:08,230
you got a big mouth next week,
you five minutes or seven minutes,

266
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,064
five bucks.
All I could think of was the five bucks 

267
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,540
and like what I could.
Because we're starving.

268
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,340
Yeah,
as any band was.

269
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,623
And so the next show I got onstage at 
Lasa told a story about what had 

270
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:21,304
happened at band practice the day before
where a white supremist in a car tried 

271
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:25,294
to run over our guitar player because we
had brown skinned people at our band 

272
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,450
practice and so he yelled.

273
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,313
He accused our guitar player of being a 
Iep lover and tried to run him over on 

274
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:38,290
his way to the liquor store to get some 
orange juice,

275
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,960
so our guitar player comes back a little
shaken,

276
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,423
a nearly got run over by a Neo Nazi and 
let's go back to practice and so for us 

277
00:13:46,391 --> 00:13:47,224
that was as Tuesday in the life of black
flag for an audience like you hear jaws 

278
00:13:51,371 --> 00:13:53,830
hit the ground and then I read something
I'd written,

279
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:55,240
I go,
well my five minutes are up,

280
00:13:55,241 --> 00:13:58,690
or whatever it was,
and I left the stage and it felt right.

281
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,180
I felt like a fish dropped into water 
for the first time.

282
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:01,661
Like,
Hey,

283
00:14:01,661 --> 00:14:03,460
I'm a fish.
Like I didn't have a band,

284
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,190
but I had no stage fright and this me 
and a microphone.

285
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:09,790
It felt more natural than music ever 
felt,

286
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,060
which was cool to do,
but never felt natural.

287
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,950
Just felt like,
is it this thing is in me,

288
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:15,784
has got to come out.
I'm serving as a monster where the 

289
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,600
talking shows like,
yeah,

290
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,523
this is me.
And after the show people came up and 

291
00:14:23,141 --> 00:14:24,100
said,
when's your next show?

292
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,551
I said,
well,

293
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:25,450
I'm leaving on tour.
They go,

294
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:25,621
no,
no,

295
00:14:25,621 --> 00:14:27,040
no,
when you're just talking.

296
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,323
I said,
well,

297
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,530
no,
that's a one off.

298
00:14:29,531 --> 00:14:31,390
I got this $5 bill.
I'm Outta here.

299
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,630
And so the agent that the promoter guy 
said,

300
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,760
okay,
you're very good at that.

301
00:14:36,761 --> 00:14:38,200
You're a natural.
So how about this?

302
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,283
Uh,
I promote all these different poets and 

303
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,100
performance artists.
I'll get you,

304
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:42,934
I'll give you 20 bucks.
You'll do 20 minutes opening for this 

305
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:46,870
guy.
Okay.

306
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,140
So I did 20 minutes and then after a 
handful of those shows,

307
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:53,174
those poet types,
we're opening for me because the black 

308
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:56,864
flag aspect kicks in like the do from 
black flag people show up and I guess I 

309
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,030
was good enough.

310
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,900
And so those poets weren't that happy.
Like I'm out opening for this guy.

311
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:06,943
Okay.
And that was 83 turning into 84 by 

312
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,333
[inaudible] 85.
I had gone to Europe for some poetry 

313
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,910
festival,
which I kind of blabbed onto in Holland.

314
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,073
I had done a cross country tour,
12 to 50 people a night sleep on the 

315
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:22,880
promoters couch,
go by Amtrak.

316
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,630
And started my little book company or 83
84 self published to this day.

317
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,163
That's awesome.
And it went from strength to strength 

318
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,780
and now it's a 14 month tour that takes 
in 20 countries,

319
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,230
multiple nights in cities at nice 
theaters.

320
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,123
Do you only use yourself for your 
publishing company or do you publish 

321
00:15:43,941 --> 00:15:47,720
anybody else's books?
We used to many years ago we,

322
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:48,440
I,
uh,

323
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,660
people I knew who I thought were great 
writers.

324
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:51,494
I put them out.
We licensed Nick Cave books from his 

325
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:55,360
publishers in Europe.
Uh,

326
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,410
we licensed a few different titles.

327
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,740
We did photo books and a couple of 
novels,

328
00:16:00,741 --> 00:16:01,574
short story collections.
And it's very hard to have a book 

329
00:16:05,661 --> 00:16:06,494
company.
It's hard to sell a book in the world 

330
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,380
unless it's like Stephen King or 
Danielle steel.

331
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:11,720
It's mega,
you know,

332
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,090
at the,
at the cash register,

333
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:15,950
at the airport store.
Uh,

334
00:16:15,951 --> 00:16:17,510
if you're selling poetry,
books,

335
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,480
different kinds of literature,
you are nothing but uphill.

336
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,400
My books did okay.
They still,

337
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:23,300
they always do.
Okay.

338
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,250
Everyone else's books is like trying to 
sell dead animal guts.

339
00:16:28,251 --> 00:16:28,881
You know what I mean?
Like,

340
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,710
no one,
no one's that interested in the look,

341
00:16:30,711 --> 00:16:35,711
but they don't want to take it home.
And so we stopped signing new writers,

342
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,460
sold through the press runs,
let the licenses run out,

343
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:45,170
everyone got to keep their masters and 
then we just concentrated on me because,

344
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:46,004
uh,
I keep a whole staff busy with all the 

345
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:48,710
stuff I've got going.

346
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,970
And so we publish what we publish me and
I've done a bunch of books.

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,680
How many books have you written?
About 27.

348
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,680
Holy Shit.
I got nothing else going on.

349
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,540
Uh,
all the two of them.

350
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,380
Uh,
we wanted to do a photo book a few years

351
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,280
ago.
And Heidi,

352
00:17:04,281 --> 00:17:06,410
who runs all my company,
she's the smart one.

353
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,090
So I showed her the manuscript,
she goes,

354
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,050
okay,
the book is great,

355
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:10,483
but let's not do it our company because 
it's a lot of startup money for a photo 

356
00:17:13,371 --> 00:17:14,990
book.
It's just a lot of setup costs.

357
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,920
Let's get you a literary agent and do it
somewhere else.

358
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:19,933
And so a smart idea.
And so we got a literary agent and we 

359
00:17:22,701 --> 00:17:24,500
did get a book deal with a very good,
uh,

360
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,110
Chicago.
It's a Chicago Company,

361
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,870
Chicago review,
I'm forgetting,

362
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,930
um,
and they put out the photo book and that

363
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:35,360
was a learning experience,
like working with an editor like,

364
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,710
oh,
well here's the cover,

365
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,430
and they,
well,

366
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,020
we're going to have a meeting about that
and I'm like,

367
00:17:39,021 --> 00:17:39,860
you're having a meeting.

368
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,993
It's my book.
It's my book cover because I'm used to 

369
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:43,843
owning my own machine.
But when you work with other people's 

370
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:47,930
money,
everyone has a big opinion.

371
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,750
So that,
that book came out and did and continues

372
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:52,584
to do very well.
And many years ago I did a kind of a 

373
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:59,541
best of if I have any best of material.
I did a best of for random house many,

374
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:04,020
many years ago that you still see it.
It's in print.

375
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:08,130
And that's a lot of people's first book 
of mine because it's in stores.

376
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,353
We pulled my company's books out of 
circulation because of Amazon because 

377
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,094
they can actually sell it cheaper than 
we can because they don't mind making 

378
00:18:17,161 --> 00:18:21,270
five cents on a book because they're 
selling 80 billion books a second.

379
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,463
So we pulled ourselves out of 
distribution and now it's very much the 

380
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:26,634
website.
And it live shows and we have less 

381
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:28,770
returns.

382
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:31,350
We don't get a pallet of damaged books 
coming back that were,

383
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,090
you know,
abused in some bookstore,

384
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,973
in a shopping mall in the Midwest,
like heavily thumbed but never taken 

385
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,454
home.
So you can't buy your books off Amazon 

386
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,700
unless a third party seller.
Right.

387
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,880
And you just sell them on your own.
Yep.

388
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,970
And you might not sell as many,
but you don't get 1100 returns.

389
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,150
You've got 1,112,
you know what I mean?

390
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,773
Well,
when we were selling everyone else's 

391
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,663
books to read,
get like a pallet of like books that 

392
00:18:59,161 --> 00:19:02,190
looked like a dog chewed them or like 
remainder stickers.

393
00:19:02,191 --> 00:19:03,024
It is what it is.
And so I am extraordinarily small of 

394
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:10,260
fame.
I sell lots of books.

395
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,620
They do create a as ebooks as well.
In fact,

396
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:16,620
that's kind of overtaking.
I'm not an ebook guy.

397
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:20,250
I like to take a marker and mark books 
up and so I buy paper ones,

398
00:19:20,251 --> 00:19:23,910
but apparently the real world likes to 
read on their tablet.

399
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,730
And so all my books are on that 
platform.

400
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,450
Thanks to Heidi and apparently they sell
very well.

401
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,040
I don't keep track,
I just write them.

402
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,200
I don't count them.
If you had to suggest to somebody,

403
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,990
a good book of yours to start with,
what would you say to start with?

404
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,480
If I was gonna read your books,
which are,

405
00:19:39,481 --> 00:19:40,051
start with.
Oh,

406
00:19:40,051 --> 00:19:42,600
I would tell you to read blood Meridian 
by Cormac McCarthy.

407
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,300
I would just tell you,
read a real writer.

408
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,510
I'm getting the van.
My tour journals from black flag is just

409
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,740
A.
People like that book.

410
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,380
It's in a bunch of different languages.
Uh,

411
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,333
it's just a cool,
insane read of like living this very 

412
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:01,130
feral life,
like,

413
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:01,964
you know,
fighting women and music and relative 

414
00:20:05,101 --> 00:20:07,910
poverty.
So that's a fun one to start.

415
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,690
Um,
I,

416
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:13,200
I like the travel books I've been 
writing the last few years.

417
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:13,531
I've,
these,

418
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:15,960
I write when I travel all over the 
world.

419
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,230
And so I write these books from these 
places,

420
00:20:19,231 --> 00:20:24,231
like from a ship in Antarctica,
from a tent in the deserts of Timbuktu.

421
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,990
And those travel books I like quite a 
bit.

422
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:31,770
And I'm a dull roar.
They always have an a,

423
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,813
an a at the beginning,
a dull roar a off to come up with the 

424
00:20:38,191 --> 00:20:39,024
rest of the name Sorta.
Your manic dedication to work is very 

425
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,473
inspiring.
Like it makes me feel like I need to 

426
00:20:44,071 --> 00:20:44,904
work more.
Like when you're writing all the time 

427
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:48,520
and doing all these,
like you're one of those guys.

428
00:20:48,521 --> 00:20:49,354
It's like,
it feels like you're always with your 

429
00:20:50,951 --> 00:20:55,660
foot on the gas.
I'm kind of furious for work.

430
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,130
Yeah,
I don't.

431
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,010
It's not what,
it's what I do,

432
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,203
but it's also what I don't do in that I 
don't have a family and I'm not putting 

433
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:06,730
it down.
I just don't have that.

434
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,090
I'm just not chipped that way.
I never thought of having kids.

435
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,550
I don't have a wife,
I don't have friends really.

436
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:17,350
I,
most of the people I know,

437
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,903
uh,
either pay a salary or a commission to 

438
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,503
my phone doesn't ring my old best friend
from since I was 12 in mci of the band 

439
00:21:26,801 --> 00:21:30,190
Fugazi.
He and I talk every Sunday of possible,

440
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,403
uh,
but past that my phone usually doesn't 

441
00:21:32,651 --> 00:21:35,440
ring unless it's an interview or Heidi 
going,

442
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:36,041
hey,
you're late.

443
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:37,750
Get over there.
Is that good?

444
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,160
It.
It is.

445
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,690
What it is.
Work for you.

446
00:21:40,691 --> 00:21:41,524
Like it's all.
I know I've been that way since I was 

447
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,060
five,
but the no friends part.

448
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,710
Well I don't.
I'm not looking for enemies.

449
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:49,390
I'm not looking for a fight.
Of course.

450
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:53,770
I just don't want to come over on the 
weekend for dinner.

451
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,520
No,
no.

452
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,510
I ever have a good time at dinner with 
somebody missed.

453
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,373
Uncomfortable that I'll say the wrong 
thing and I just act like look at the 

454
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:06,580
table full of people.
Go Act like them.

455
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,533
You should be friends with comics 
because you can't say the wrong thing 

456
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:11,410
because no one cares.
Yeah.

457
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,750
But then you have to.
Then they'll call and say,

458
00:22:13,751 --> 00:22:14,740
hey,
come out with us.

459
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:16,090
We're going.
Then you have to go,

460
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,150
ah,
you don't have to go a deadbeat.

461
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,860
I'd be a deadbeat friend because that's 
fine.

462
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,750
I'd never want to go with anyone to do 
any.

463
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,260
You don't have to,
but we'll look at all the phone calls.

464
00:22:29,261 --> 00:22:33,190
I'm saying it sounds like you're 
managing expectations versus you know,

465
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,860
like it doesn't sound like you don't 
like friends.

466
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:39,350
It's just you don't want expectations.
I,

467
00:22:39,351 --> 00:22:40,450
I,
you know,

468
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,080
as it's going to get in the way.
So.

469
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:44,380
Well also I'm just kind of moody in 
that.

470
00:22:44,381 --> 00:22:45,214
Yeah,
we're going to go out and do this thing 

471
00:22:46,151 --> 00:22:51,040
and then I don't want to see anyone to 
do anything until 20,

472
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,550
28 and I don't want to cancel.

473
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,530
And so here,
this is my big,

474
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,660
besides hanging out with you,
uh,

475
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,280
my big social thing as many,
many years ago,

476
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:07,690
2003,
I did a song with William Shatner,

477
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,530
Bill Shatner on this album and we became
pals.

478
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,993
Henry come by the house for Monday night
football and he invited me to the house 

479
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:23,890
for Monday night football.
He lives a few traffic lights for me and

480
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:28,150
I'm walking up the stairs to the living 
room where the TV is.

481
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,223
And I heard all this laughter and voices
and I froze and I was right at the 

482
00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,570
threshold of the door and I said,
turn back,

483
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:40,580
turn back,
turn turning back Henry.

484
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,750
And he saw me and I'm like,
hey.

485
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,350
And I walked in and met all his really 
cool friends and he,

486
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,760
at least for me,
Bill is,

487
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,020
were the nicest people I've ever met in 
my life.

488
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:02,710
And it's one of the oddest friendships I
have in that.

489
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,930
I've been going to bill shatner's house 
every year since 2003.

490
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,420
So what's that?
Fifteen years.

491
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,540
Right?
And I will be there this year.

492
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm on his next record.
He's doing another record.

493
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,110
Oh yeah,
I did the vocal last year.

494
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,680
Rocket Man.
Um,

495
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,050
this is,
uh,

496
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,010
it,
it'll be fun.

497
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:27,470
I'm not gonna you know,
for him to announce it.

498
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,573
But,
um,

499
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,593
every great,
once in a while his assistant will 

500
00:24:31,161 --> 00:24:32,060
contact me,
hey,

501
00:24:32,061 --> 00:24:34,130
bill,
really wants to see you.

502
00:24:34,131 --> 00:24:34,791
Uh,
how bout like,

503
00:24:34,791 --> 00:24:37,040
next you guys,
are you free for next Wednesday?

504
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:40,070
Go meet him and the wife and the valley 
and go eat.

505
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,120
I'm like,
yeah.

506
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,270
And it's great to see him in his amazing
wife.

507
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,950
And I truly value that friendship.
I mean,

508
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:49,784
I look forward to seeing him.
I really enjoy hearing what he's up to 

509
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,463
because it was doing like five things 
and it's become this thing where I 

510
00:24:59,271 --> 00:25:01,550
really look forward to football season.

511
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,270
I don't know much about football.
I have no idea what a halfback does run.

512
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:07,100
I think they run.
I don't know,

513
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:07,620
I,
I,

514
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,453
I'd never knew,
but I like going there and it's always 

515
00:25:11,211 --> 00:25:14,390
the same group of people.
People he's known for like 500 years and

516
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:19,391
they're super nice and I've kind of sort
of known them for like 15 years and it's

517
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:26,441
so odd because I have nothing else like 
that really in my life.

518
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,590
I'm just a Weirdo.
Just William Shatner.

519
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,360
Yeah,
it's weird.

520
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,513
Sounds awesome.
The other thing I would do once a year 

521
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,740
and sadly it ended,
but for a few years I would go to gail's

522
00:25:40,741 --> 00:25:41,574
APP as birthday party on January first 
because I would play a lot of her 

523
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,853
husband's music on my radio show,
Frank Zappa and one time someone in the 

524
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:51,020
family wrote me and said,
Hey,

525
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,030
thanks for playing dad on the show.
I'm like,

526
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:53,600
are you kidding?

527
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,840
I love those records.
And then gail,

528
00:25:56,841 --> 00:25:58,880
the mom,
the wife wrote and said,

529
00:25:58,881 --> 00:25:59,930
Hey,
thank you.

530
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,130
And um,
you know,

531
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:03,680
we know who you are here and we like 
you.

532
00:26:03,681 --> 00:26:06,380
I have a birthday party every January 
first,

533
00:26:06,381 --> 00:26:10,040
why don't you come up to the house this 
year or next next year.

534
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:13,310
Like he'll and I did and that was like 
three or four years in a row.

535
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:18,311
I did that until gail passed away and in
the more you get there,

536
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,570
whatever it is,
like two in the afternoon,

537
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,560
two hours before,
I'm genuinely nervous to go be in a room

538
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:32,030
full of extraordinarily nice people with
fantastically good food.

539
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,360
And there everyone was always so nice to
me and like,

540
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,730
it's like a WHO's who,
you walk in,

541
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,090
you're like,
wow,

542
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,920
it's just all these people you 
recognize.

543
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,053
I'm not here to name drop,
but some of the tables I sat at that 

544
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:46,560
thing I'm like,
really am I really talking to,

545
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,260
like really fantastic.

546
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:53,220
And she was always so nice to me.
And like last time I was up there,

547
00:26:53,221 --> 00:26:55,110
one of my books is like in the living 
room.

548
00:26:55,111 --> 00:26:56,220
I'm like,
wow.

549
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,450
When she passed away,
I wrote one of the family members.

550
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,860
I said,
I am so sorry.

551
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,880
Thank you for the hospitality.
Your mom was so great to me and I'm kind

552
00:27:06,881 --> 00:27:07,714
of like the rescue dog.
I'm used to being outside so I don't 

553
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,010
come inside very often and I went to 
that birthday party because the just the

554
00:27:16,171 --> 00:27:21,090
friendliness of that,
I wouldn't as socially nerve wracking as

555
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:25,830
those things are for me.
I had such respect for that extension of

556
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:26,664
kindness.
I cannot disrespect it by not going and 

557
00:27:30,391 --> 00:27:33,980
wouldn't dare the Samurai and he says,
you do not distract.

558
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,020
You must be respectful even if it makes 
you nauseous with social anxiety because

559
00:27:40,081 --> 00:27:40,914
I just don't know what to do.
I can't say no because it's such a nice 

560
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:48,510
thing to do for someone.
Yeah.

561
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,370
Play.
She must not really know how I am.

562
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,870
Otherwise she never would have invited 
me.

563
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,550
So,
um,

564
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,953
but things like that,
out of sheer politeness and respect for 

565
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:00,264
someone being friendly to me,
I'm kind of a pushover just because I'm 

566
00:28:03,421 --> 00:28:04,021
like,
wow,

567
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:07,050
that was so nice.
I must salute that.

568
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,940
I think it's so good that you're open 
about your social anxiety and then about

569
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,774
how you feel like being around all these
people because a lot of people in the 

570
00:28:17,591 --> 00:28:19,870
outside,
they see someone like you,

571
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,960
you know,
black flag.

572
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,910
Oh,
your spoken word things,

573
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,700
your books,
your fucking mean.

574
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,370
I,
I always go back to uh,

575
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:29,680
that uh,
uh,

576
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,633
the liar song,
your fucking neck was like the size of 

577
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:36,640
my waist and you're screaming and 
painted red and like,

578
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,730
you're this crazy intimidating guy and a
lot of ways.

579
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:43,930
So to hear you talk about social anxiety
and how weird you feel.

580
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,930
And I think we all can.
We all feel that.

581
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,700
I always feel like that.
I mean,

582
00:28:48,701 --> 00:28:49,534
it doesn't matter.
I think no matter how famous you get 

583
00:28:51,491 --> 00:28:53,260
your,
if you're paying attention,

584
00:28:53,261 --> 00:28:54,910
you're going to have an imposter 
syndrome.

585
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:55,973
You're,
you're always gonna feel like you don't 

586
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:57,100
belong there.

587
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,410
If you're actually paying attention.
And if you don't,

588
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,670
you'll,
you're probably,

589
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:04,660
you're probably delusional at some sort 
of wonder about the people who don't.

590
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,720
Like,
I never get to do cool stuff.

591
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,130
And the bit before we go into that,
to on your point,

592
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:15,070
it's easy for me to be in front of 
people.

593
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,670
That's a very different than than being 
with people.

594
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,100
I can be the party,
but going to the parties,

595
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,730
difficult putting,
put me in front of like five people,

596
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,100
5,000 people.
Stage fright.

597
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:28,840
No,
I can't wait to be out there.

598
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:31,540
You're a performer type.
Love that audience.

599
00:29:31,541 --> 00:29:32,590
See if they showed up.
Like,

600
00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:35,080
are you kidding?
I'm a dog with a wagging tail.

601
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,140
I want to get out there and,
and get it going.

602
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:37,983
I can't wait.
I wait the whole day on tour to get out 

603
00:29:39,431 --> 00:29:41,620
there.
The whole day is about o'clock,

604
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,160
you know,

605
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,160
stage time I'm being amongst people like
going to like a gallery event.

606
00:29:48,671 --> 00:29:49,504
I go see a shepard fairey thing or 
something and people are Super Nice to 

607
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:55,810
me and I'm always polite back.
But I'm a little nervy.

608
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,973
But if they say,
can you get up and speak for five 

609
00:29:58,571 --> 00:29:59,201
minutes?
Oh yeah,

610
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:02,710
I got this strange.
It is strange,

611
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,100
but it's also um,
it's a way to avoid being with people,

612
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:06,934
be in front of them.
It's a way to be in the room with 

613
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:11,410
people,
just be the center of attention,

614
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,650
so maybe that's coming from some kind of
neediness or some deprivation as a,

615
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:18,244
you know what I didn't get as a kid,
but you make a great point about that 

616
00:30:22,811 --> 00:30:24,040
when you really think,
well,

617
00:30:24,041 --> 00:30:29,041
this is where I belong.
I think you lose all the fun of it.

618
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,200
Yeah.
And you turn into kind of a jerk.

619
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,303
So when I,
every 500 years I go to one of those 

620
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:37,990
premiers,
I get invited and you're standing,

621
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:38,873
you're in a room full of tons of really 
good food and none of those people eat 

622
00:30:42,191 --> 00:30:45,550
side just like go in there and come out 
nine pounds heavier.

623
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:49,330
Bunch of shrimp have I just eat.
But you,

624
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,800
you're a big Hollywood premier big,
big movie years ago.

625
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:55,780
And it's like that one,
that one,

626
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:56,501
that one,
that one.

627
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:57,220
And they're all like,
ah,

628
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,920
it is their lives.
And I'm with a buddy of mine.

629
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,920
We blagged in there and we're like,
what are we doing here?

630
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:05,590
This is so cool because we know we 
shouldn't be here.

631
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,360
And after shaking Ike Turner's hand,
10 minutes later,

632
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:14,380
I'm back in my own kitchen going.
That was so weird.

633
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,170
Like,
what a surreal evening.

634
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,233
And uh,
because my friend and I were standing 

635
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:22,090
next to other and he said,
that looks like I turn.

636
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:22,811
I go,
no man,

637
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:24,690
that is eye turner.
He looked,

638
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,160
looked like a human barracuda.
He's like terrifying.

639
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:31,480
I was like,
we bought a ticket at the dance.

640
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:32,560
Let's,
let's go talk to this guy.

641
00:31:32,561 --> 00:31:33,010
He was like,
no,

642
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:33,310
no,
no,

643
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,900
no.
I just walked right over there.

644
00:31:34,901 --> 00:31:37,000
I said,
you invented rock and roll rocket 88.

645
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,230
And he went,
yes I did.

646
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:39,820
It shook my head.
Wow.

647
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,250
I say first ever distorted guitar on 
tape,

648
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,410
which is kind of true.
Anyone that's right.

649
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,950
And I fluffed him up and he was all 
happy to meet me.

650
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,963
And I said,
hey,

651
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:49,803
here's my friend.
And I brought my friend over and we 

652
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:54,640
shook his hand and kind of stood with 
him for a minute and went,

653
00:31:54,641 --> 00:31:55,474
okay.
So it's probably not gonna get any 

654
00:31:56,771 --> 00:31:58,600
better for us.
So let's get outta here.

655
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:04,920
We ate a few more handfuls of mini 
burritos and we bale,

656
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,170
but it was one of those nights were 
like,

657
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,180
we were supposed to be in there and if I
ever lose that then just never talked to

658
00:32:13,091 --> 00:32:16,390
me again because I'll just have my head 
would have disappeared up.

659
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,630
Pardon me with that anxiety.
And that insecurity is a big part of the

660
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:22,310
fuel that keeps everything moving.
Super fuel for me.

661
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,480
You analyzing yourself?
Yeah.

662
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,700
And anger.
Yeah.

663
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm mad at I,
I,

664
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:32,010
I like fighting and not fighting like in
a ring for me.

665
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,740
A lot of things or confrontation like 
tourists.

666
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:38,800
What you think?
I can't do 47 shows in 48.

667
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,131
No,
it actually,

668
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:43,030
my next tour is 47 and 47.
Um,

669
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,830
I have a day off and I have two shows a 
few days later in one day.

670
00:32:45,831 --> 00:32:46,910
So,
um,

671
00:32:46,911 --> 00:32:49,190
what you think I can't will then book 20
more,

672
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,073
200 more in the winter and just give me 
a lama and a knife and I make every gig 

673
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:01,220
like watch this and,
and that's so much of what fuels me.

674
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,800
Like yeah.
And like,

675
00:33:03,801 --> 00:33:06,080
I come up with these huge ideas for 
books,

676
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,630
like that's gonna take me five years to 
write it.

677
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,520
And it did,
and I just finished it.

678
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,250
It's going to the proofreader soon.
This epic project,

679
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,600
I just,
it's,

680
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:18,560
it's a series of music books.
It's 407,000 words.

681
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,880
It's a bit much.
But so am I.

682
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,870
is this idea pages?
I don't know.

683
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,713
It's a lot.
It's mostly on the hard drive so we 

684
00:33:28,461 --> 00:33:31,710
don't have to deforest some park.
Um,

685
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,710
but it was an idea I had.
I said,

686
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:34,544
okay,
this is going to take a lot of years to 

687
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:37,460
execute this idea.
And so like,

688
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,710
watch me work seven days a week on this 
thing,

689
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:40,723
watch we stay up until the next day 
working on this thing and a lot of what 

690
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:48,470
fuels me.
That's what gets me into auditions.

691
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,030
Like I think,
you know,

692
00:33:50,031 --> 00:33:50,590
like,
Hey,

693
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,450
go audition for this TV show.
I'm not an actor.

694
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,580
So am I going,
yeah,

695
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:55,414
I'm going.
And I sit in that hallway like 20 years 

696
00:33:57,681 --> 00:33:58,910
older than all these other people.

697
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,180
And they got the good jim bodies on 
fantastic hair,

698
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,373
chiseled bodies.
And they all know each other like this 

699
00:34:05,361 --> 00:34:09,860
weird old man going for the same part,
the only guy not dipped in Cologne.

700
00:34:09,861 --> 00:34:10,910
I'm like,
oh man.

701
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,403
And I go in there and I bomb.
Of course I get my parking pass 

702
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:18,500
validated and listen to slayer on the 
way home.

703
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,710
Take the lump out of my.
How often do you do that?

704
00:34:21,711 --> 00:34:22,790
How often are you auditioning for?
It?

705
00:34:22,791 --> 00:34:23,624
Depends if I'm in town and there's 
interesting things happening more and 

706
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:29,830
more,
uh,

707
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,703
as I don't know what's happening,
but I take more meetings and just get 

708
00:34:33,081 --> 00:34:33,861
more offers.
Like,

709
00:34:33,861 --> 00:34:34,671
Hey,
we like you for this.

710
00:34:34,671 --> 00:34:35,810
Yes or no.
Cool.

711
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,030
Yes.
But there's auditions.

712
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:38,910
I do,
uh,

713
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,973
for voiceover,
for like animated or like car ads or 

714
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:44,570
what have you.
And acting.

715
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,600
I auditioned for all kinds of things and
every great once in a while the audition

716
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,890
will get work.

717
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:55,700
But mainly I just get offers.
We like you for this.

718
00:34:55,701 --> 00:34:56,534
It starts in October.
I'm in and that happens fairly often 

719
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:00,674
now.
But I get in those lines that at any 

720
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,273
major studio you want to imagine or I go
in for the meeting with a casting 

721
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:10,280
person,
they kind of look you over,

722
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:11,114
but I do those raw auditions.
Whereas you leave and you see like five 

723
00:35:14,691 --> 00:35:15,524
head shots on a desk.
It is what it is and you get literally 

724
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,600
you're out of there in about 35 seconds.
You walk in,

725
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:25,440
you're a Henry Henry Harley.
Uh,

726
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,810
are you ready?
Sure.

727
00:35:26,811 --> 00:35:28,040
Do you have any questions?
No.

728
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:31,650
Stand on this piece of tape.
She'll be reading with you and you,

729
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,420
you know.
No,

730
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,253
no,
no.

731
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,513
Thank you very much for coming in.
And you leave the trailer and you get 

732
00:35:40,441 --> 00:35:44,310
back on the one on one and go home and 
you never hear from them again.

733
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,773
Often for me,
most of the time out of 100 of those 98 

734
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,460
times for everybody except putting it 
down.

735
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:55,440
But I'm going to say,
and you asked about auditions.

736
00:35:55,441 --> 00:35:56,490
Hell yeah.
I go in there.

737
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,503
I think that's one of the things that 
makes acthar so fucking weird is not 

738
00:36:00,811 --> 00:36:01,644
just that they need attention in the 
first place where they told Nola they 

739
00:36:04,321 --> 00:36:06,690
get told no a lot,
which sucks.

740
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,583
It sucks and they're already insecure in
the first place and then they sort of 

741
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,184
try to model their behavior based on 
what they think the casting agents and 

742
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:15,744
the producers want to hear and they 
change and they developed this style of 

743
00:36:18,601 --> 00:36:20,430
communicating.
That's very actory.

744
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,940
It's a weird way to make your living.
I mean,

745
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,980
I've never relied on acting as my source
of income in 1984 when I was 23 either a

746
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,580
thing that has been serving me up to 
sitting here with you now.

747
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,230
I was very young in 23 years of age,
a young idiot and I looked all around.

748
00:36:37,231 --> 00:36:41,070
Me and all my peers are super talented.
Who are my peers under threat,

749
00:36:41,071 --> 00:36:42,120
bad rains,
Husker du,

750
00:36:42,121 --> 00:36:44,040
the meat puppets,
the dead Kennedys.

751
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:47,160
I'm just surrounded by really talented 
people who are brilliant,

752
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,000
great songwriters and between tours,
many of them are waiting tables,

753
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,520
living with mom,
living on couches,

754
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,440
you know,
sleeping at band practice,

755
00:36:55,441 --> 00:36:56,760
you know,
with a kick drum,

756
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,390
a pillow as,
as their pillow just like,

757
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,000
you know,
roughing it and I,

758
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:01,883
I reckon that I'm less talented than all
of them and if they're waiters between 

759
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:06,564
tours,
the only reason I'm not as black flag 

760
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:08,514
never stopped drawing,
like were the ball never hit the ground 

761
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:14,490
because we'd starve.
And so I better get plans B,

762
00:37:14,491 --> 00:37:14,941
c,
d,

763
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,774
e,
F and g ready because music's not going 

764
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:18,120
to sustain me.

765
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,953
Ironically,
it went very well for me and so I was 

766
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:22,320
doing the writing,
so I said,

767
00:37:22,321 --> 00:37:24,210
I'm going to really get better at 
writing.

768
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:27,150
I'm going to really bear down on this.
The talking shows.

769
00:37:27,151 --> 00:37:30,780
I'm getting 35 people a night.
I'm going to get 50 people a night.

770
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,330
And then voiceover people started coming
like,

771
00:37:33,331 --> 00:37:34,530
Hey,
can you do a voiceover?

772
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:35,820
I got a voice.
What do you want me to?

773
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,510
I better learn to say yes to stuff and 
by the mid eighties,

774
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,340
hey,
you want to be in a movie?

775
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah,
that'd be like,

776
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,880
what do I have to lose except your 
calories from starving?

777
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,030
And so it was fear of not eating that,
you know,

778
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:51,864
and knowing I better have a plan and so 
I started developing that in the 

779
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,003
eighties,
nineties.

780
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:59,550
And from that came what I,
I'm done with this.

781
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:00,384
I'm going to go immediately into this 
documentary and then I'm finishing this 

782
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:05,620
radio show and then I'm going off to do 
this film and then I'm going on tour and

783
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,533
then I'm coming back and finishing this 
book and it turned into this like 

784
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,660
juggling all these things.
So I never had to be a full time actor.

785
00:38:12,661 --> 00:38:13,494
Like that's how I pay the rent.
That would be terrifying right up there 

786
00:38:16,171 --> 00:38:17,004
with being a professional comedian.
Like I don't know how someone acts for 

787
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:24,480
living without being really good or out 
of their minds with anxiety.

788
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,050
But being a professional comedian,
at least you write your own stuff,

789
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,320
so you're kind of in control of that.
And then you don't have pain.

790
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,860
It doesn't seem that rough and then you 
don't have to pay people,

791
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:36,100
like

792
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
you don't have to pay roadies,
you don't have a drummer that has to 

793
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:39,970
show up.
Also,

794
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:42,490
you don't have the bass player who 
you've got to get along with.

795
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,510
Like there's so many variables with a 
band that comedians don't have.

796
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,190
Like we always look at you guys and go,
wow,

797
00:38:48,191 --> 00:38:52,440
I don't know how the fuck you guys do it
because there's not as much like you.

798
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:54,580
You might do the same size venues that 
we do,

799
00:38:54,581 --> 00:38:57,190
but you're splitting the money with all 
these fucking people.

800
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,220
You know.
And then a lot of times today the record

801
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:02,830
company gets a piece.
They get a piece of everything,

802
00:39:02,831 --> 00:39:04,480
right?
They get a piece of your merchandise,

803
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,373
you see bands play really big places and
it's amazing how much money they don't 

804
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:12,230
make.
Or each guy in the band gets like,

805
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,500
really?
Huh?

806
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,523
And then you see someone,
a small comedian playing like a 150 

807
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:23,380
cedar for two nights,
two sets of night,

808
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,511
you know,
the,

809
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:26,680
the left whatever in the Midwest.

810
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,540
And you're like,
wow,

811
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,793
wow,
that's a pretty good weekend because 

812
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,790
he's just taking it home in his 
suitcase.

813
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:34,840
Yeah.
You can get by,

814
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,220
get by.
Yeah.

815
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,200
And you can work,
you can work everywhere.

816
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,640
You know,
for a band.

817
00:39:39,641 --> 00:39:40,474
I think it's more the venues are more,
are more limited places you go are more 

818
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,220
limited,
you know.

819
00:39:45,221 --> 00:39:47,680
And I think uh,
that's interesting that you're,

820
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,130
it was almost like a desperation to not 
have to work a job as a waiter that kept

821
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:55,450
you just hustling.
What does it mean?

822
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,940
I just knew that the straight world,
because I'd been in it,

823
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,110
I come from it,
you know,

824
00:39:59,111 --> 00:40:02,680
minimum wage work and everything.
And I knew I couldn't survive in it.

825
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,390
Cause I know you get as a young adult,
you start to figure out who you are.

826
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,530
Like,
okay,

827
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm not an artist,
but I'm an artist type.

828
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,770
I'm an,
I'm nuts.

829
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,550
You can't put me in a straight shot.
I can pass for normal just because I can

830
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:17,080
task it.
I can totally do it.

831
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,810
Like you can put me in a Ralph's,
a kroger's,

832
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,823
a starbucks.
I will totally get in there and hit the 

833
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:25,480
work and cleaned it all and serve it up 
with a smile,

834
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,913
but I'll be going crazy inside.
I will be punch everybody in those 

835
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:33,270
places is going crazy inside.
I Dunno.

836
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,593
But um,
I can't sustain in that and I haven't 

837
00:40:37,361 --> 00:40:39,340
had to for many years.
I've been lucky.

838
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:44,610
I've been in the world of lunatics since
1981 being a crazy person out with other

839
00:40:44,981 --> 00:40:45,814
crazy people.
And when I look at a straight job I'm 

840
00:40:48,881 --> 00:40:49,570
like,
man,

841
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,580
I don't think at this point I could hack
it.

842
00:40:51,581 --> 00:40:52,414
Not because I'm spoiled just because 
I've never had to tether my adult mind 

843
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,430
too that I work seven days a week.

844
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,820
But on Henry stuff,
to me it's not,

845
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,500
it's a different thing.
It's a different thing.

846
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,330
You enjoy that work and it's,
it's way over 60 hours a week.

847
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:11,164
I mean it's,
I do two shifts usually to eight to 10 

848
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,610
hour shifts depending on every workload.
Well,

849
00:41:15,611 --> 00:41:19,810
I can't do four hours of sleep a night,
but I tie my sleep.

850
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,390
I hit the stopwatch on the phone before 
I go to bed.

851
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:24,040
Just this clock,
sleep patterns.

852
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,370
I did about six point something hours of
sleep last night.

853
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,540
That's good.
It's good.

854
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:31,840
I feel great today.
I barely ate and I uh,

855
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,703
got into a good workout.
And all last night he did a lot of pull 

856
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,800
ups.
I played 15,

857
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,634
seven inch records and between flipping 
him over I got a beam in my living room 

858
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:41,954
is a beam coming out of the ceiling that
supports me and I just run over there 

859
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:48,260
and just do a bunch of pull ups and then
go change the record.

860
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:49,843
So you want more music?
You have to pay and pay and pay and all 

861
00:41:52,371 --> 00:41:54,380
this by yourself all alone.
Yeah.

862
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,490
But by bedtime you are hurting and ready
to sleep.

863
00:41:58,491 --> 00:41:59,324
So I got good sleep last night.
So you mix the workout in with your 

864
00:42:01,941 --> 00:42:04,640
enjoyment of music.
He just space it in between the song.

865
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:07,360
Last night was pulling.
Tonight at the turntable,

866
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:11,090
I'll be listening to more records.
I'll just do sets of pushups next to the

867
00:42:11,091 --> 00:42:11,924
turntable.
That's a smart move because like that's 

868
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:19,130
probably a good interval of rest.
Like get a good hard workout in.

869
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:20,660
And then you listen to a form and it's 
on.

870
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,360
Yeah.
And,

871
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,280
but I do it all night and it's just a,
I'm not doing 50 sets,

872
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:28,040
50 rep sets.
I'm doing like 15 to 25,

873
00:42:28,041 --> 00:42:32,480
but I'm doing them for quite a while.
By the time I go to bed it's advil time.

874
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,373
I'm like,
Oh,

875
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,810
I'm too old for this.
But um,

876
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:40,310
I,
I work on something every day on tour.

877
00:42:40,311 --> 00:42:42,980
I don't take vacations.
I'm not trying to brag.

878
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,080
I just can't.
I can't handle not doing it.

879
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,710
Whatever the thing is.
Yeah.

880
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:52,100
Well you found an interesting way to 
live life.

881
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,620
I don't know anybody like you,
but it's working for you.

882
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,510
Yeah,
it works on all levels.

883
00:42:56,511 --> 00:42:57,980
And like I,
I can sustain.

884
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:58,963
I pay my bills,
I'm not bored and I get for the most 

885
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,310
part to call my own shots.
And you seem happy.

886
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:06,170
Happy when I'm working.
Yeah.

887
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:08,130
Yeah.
Happy with the task.

888
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:10,250
Yeah.
I value work.

889
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm an achievement junkie.
Like if I'm depressed,

890
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:18,050
I just picked something to do,
like finish your radio show,

891
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,770
edit this thing,
transcribed this chapter from a notebook

892
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,150
and after I'm done,
I'm like,

893
00:43:23,151 --> 00:43:23,984
okay,
that's the antidepressant was actually 

894
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,370
doing something which is not the worst.

895
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,980
It's not booze,
it's not a pill,

896
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:36,230
it's the treadmill or it's the Oh that 
damn thing I got to get it written,

897
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,900
will shut up and write it and when I'm 
done,

898
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:42,290
it's like an endorphin thing where I'm 
great for another day.

899
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,860
There was an article written about 
happiness and those.

900
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:45,733
One of the things that they said that 
one of the things that seems to sustain 

901
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:52,070
people's happiness or facilitate 
happiness is accomplishing tasks,

902
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,173
like setting goals for yourself,
accomplishing those goals and getting 

903
00:43:54,831 --> 00:43:55,664
this sense of completion that you've.
You've actually done the work and you 

904
00:43:58,401 --> 00:43:59,234
did it and you discipline yourself and 
got through it and that this is one of 

905
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:04,820
the major keys to happiness for a lot of
work for me,

906
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,710
totally works for me because I may as 
well.

907
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,280
I've tried everything but drugs because 
I've been battling with depression since

908
00:44:10,281 --> 00:44:13,070
I was a little kid and I just knew what 
is this.

909
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,780
It's just awful.
And you know,

910
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:18,230
later I found out it was depression and 
I don't want to do drugs.

911
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,530
I'm not,
I just don't want it.

912
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:23,240
My brain plus drugs.
It's like someone else's idea.

913
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:26,690
It's terrifies me.
So I had to figure out what do you do.

914
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,763
And so that's where the gym you're 
working out really is a big help 

915
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:31,303
writing.
But listening to music that is like a 

916
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:36,610
kind of my drug,
you know,

917
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,600
I just put the records on and like three
songs in,

918
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:39,991
you're like,
oh,

919
00:44:39,991 --> 00:44:42,300
there's that feeling,
buoyancy neutral.

920
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:43,403
It's like floating in the tank or when 
you're scuba diving you get your air 

921
00:44:45,631 --> 00:44:46,800
just right in.
You're floating.

922
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,000
That's how I feel.
I have the music on.

923
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:49,771
I'm like,
ah,

924
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:52,770
this is as good as it gets.
And that's why I always have,

925
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:53,670
you know,
record.

926
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,533
I'm always looking at new records,
going to the record store is more 

927
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:58,230
happiness coming in.

928
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,030
Does the exercise work better or the 
same as work?

929
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,400
Like for managing depression?
Uh,

930
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:08,790
the workout is maintenance,
it doesn't achieve much,

931
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:12,090
but I achieved the workout.
But you feel like the,

932
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:14,670
the endorphin release,
does that help you?

933
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:15,710
Yeah,
yeah,

934
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,920
it does.
And I,

935
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:19,410
as the Buddhists say,
I made merit.

936
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:20,873
I,
I went in there and did my time on the 

937
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:23,784
treadmill.
I don't want to be there just the last 

938
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:29,280
15 minutes.
I don't.

939
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,020
I'd rather be somewhere else like,
yo,

940
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:32,190
that's cool.
You'll be fine.

941
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:33,570
Sit Down,
do your work.

942
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:37,140
That's why before the podcast how 
suggesting hot yoga to you and you,

943
00:45:37,141 --> 00:45:40,830
you seem to be very stiff lately.
You've got some injuries and some things

944
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,110
back.
Dude,

945
00:45:43,111 --> 00:45:45,360
I'm telling you that'll fix a lot of 
that shit.

946
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:46,291
It'll really.
Yeah.

947
00:45:46,291 --> 00:45:49,350
I know you have.
You have a great workout diversity.

948
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,184
You,
when you and I were talking before we 

949
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,490
were at your place and you said some 
mornings you feel like training this way

950
00:45:56,491 --> 00:45:57,324
and you'll go to that gym or you'll 
train like a judo or whatever and then 

951
00:46:01,021 --> 00:46:02,490
the next day it's going to be kettle 
bells.

952
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:03,324
So you really like to mix it up.
I think it's good for a body to always 

953
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,490
be guessing what's coming next.
Yeah,

954
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:08,324
I think

955
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,350
I also,
I,

956
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,350
there's some things that are really have
to do.

957
00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:12,423
I think I need at least one day of hard 
cardio a week and I think I need at 

958
00:46:16,451 --> 00:46:18,760
least one day of hard lifting weights a 
week,

959
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,980
but I also think I need at least one day
of yoga.

960
00:46:20,981 --> 00:46:21,814
We call East Yoga is to me it's one of 
the most important things that I do 

961
00:46:24,911 --> 00:46:27,610
because for that 90 minutes I can't go 
anywhere.

962
00:46:27,611 --> 00:46:29,650
I don't touch my phone,
not in the room with me.

963
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,713
It was just me and a jug of water and 
the Yoga Mat and the class and a bunch 

964
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:38,440
of old ladies that are kicking my ass.
These ladies are fucking tough man.

965
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,990
This is old lady.
She goes to this workout,

966
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,170
classmates see you there all the time.
She's got to be close to 70.

967
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:47,290
She doesn't even bring water.
She just tufts it out.

968
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,183
She's there for 90 minutes.
Sweating and grunting through the 

969
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:53,200
postures and those you doing an hour and
a half class.

970
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:58,201
Those last 20 minutes in a 104 degrees,
it's so hard to get through,

971
00:46:59,290 --> 00:47:02,440
but when you get through you just feel 
like you feel better.

972
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,990
I just,
I almost like can't wallow in it.

973
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:05,883
I can't wait to do it again.
Like while I'm struggling and I was 

974
00:47:07,931 --> 00:47:08,381
like,
God,

975
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:10,540
I need to do more than this.
I need to do this more often.

976
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:14,770
Rather I can't wait to do this again.
I always feel that and it just lengthens

977
00:47:14,771 --> 00:47:15,604
everything.
Like all the bad things and the leg 

978
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:18,214
things,
the hamstring things just stretches 

979
00:47:19,991 --> 00:47:22,780
everything out,
lengthens it and all the tension.

980
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:23,614
It just straightens it out and loosens 
it up and I just feel like for a guy 

981
00:47:26,891 --> 00:47:29,980
like you or I who does a lot of a Lotta,
like

982
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:32,080
especially like used a lot of heavy 
lifting.

983
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:34,000
You were saying a lot of dead lifts and 
squats.

984
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,133
This is the antidote for all that stuff.
It's decompression and for your body 

985
00:47:38,561 --> 00:47:40,180
maintenance,
it's just phenomenal.

986
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:42,730
Probably let's lose the lactic acid out 
of your muscle tissue.

987
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:43,810
Yeah.
Yeah.

988
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:45,400
You know,
here's what I've observed.

989
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,260
You know,
I live in Los Angeles,

990
00:47:47,261 --> 00:47:51,280
so there's a lot of yoga people,
but I know them because they have a mat,

991
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,960
but you could also see how they walk,
how they sit there,

992
00:47:55,961 --> 00:48:00,961
so in their body,
and there is a grace to you.

993
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:03,550
I'm not trying to put anyone in the 
pejorative,

994
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,200
but a yoga person where there's not only
are they limber,

995
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:13,201
they're just really okay though this 
their body articulation,

996
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,410
you're like,
okay,

997
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,933
I don't have that.
I'm a Herky Jerky and coordinator 

998
00:48:17,871 --> 00:48:19,100
person,
but there is a,

999
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,310
uh,
uh hum.

1000
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:23,680
Coming from that person's overall body.

1001
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:25,810
It just,
it's a beautiful machine.

1002
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:28,330
The way they articulate themselves in 
the way they sit,

1003
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,120
very unusual balance.
The balance of like,

1004
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,640
tell someone who does it.
They have that.

1005
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,680
Yeah.
And it's not subtle.

1006
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,600
I recognize that you would love it,
man.

1007
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:38,434
You know what?
You would love it because it fucking 

1008
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:41,530
sucks.
And while you're doing it,

1009
00:48:41,531 --> 00:48:43,690
man,
you have the internal dialogues.

1010
00:48:43,691 --> 00:48:44,524
Crazy.
You want to bolt what do you want a 

1011
00:48:45,941 --> 00:48:46,774
ball,
but you also start going over your life 

1012
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:52,600
and your mind and dealing with all your 
bullshit and your to do list and all the

1013
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:53,250
things you're.
You're,

1014
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,083
you're doing wrong or slacking.
There's something about really 

1015
00:48:57,161 --> 00:48:57,994
struggling in these static positions for
like a minute where you're trying to 

1016
00:49:00,821 --> 00:49:02,650
like hold your leg up there and you're 
sweating.

1017
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,443
Sweat is literally pouring off your arms
and your head and there's something 

1018
00:49:07,841 --> 00:49:10,120
about that man that it's just really 
cleansing.

1019
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,163
It just really mtz.
I just think it's a thing that you're 

1020
00:49:12,851 --> 00:49:15,190
missing that you would really love if 
you tried.

1021
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,040
I bet if you did it and he came back,
we did a podcast a year later,

1022
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:19,450
like,
Fuck Yoga.

1023
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,580
I fucking love it.
It's changed my life.

1024
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,130
It's changed my life.
I know a lot of fighters,

1025
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,550
a lot of people who like are hectic for 
living.

1026
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:27,970
Yup.
There Yoga people,

1027
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:32,020
like in the seventies you say yoga,
so I was going to punch you like yoga,

1028
00:49:32,021 --> 00:49:34,150
wham.
You know what I found out about it?

1029
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:39,160
How do you know Hixon Gracie is well.
Are we talking about the Gracie family?

1030
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,053
Well,
the family hoists Gracie is the most 

1031
00:49:41,681 --> 00:49:42,514
famous because he's probably the most 
important figure ever in the history of 

1032
00:49:45,791 --> 00:49:46,624
martial arts because he won the first 
ultimate fighting championship and 

1033
00:49:48,641 --> 00:49:49,474
showed that a small man could actually 
beat larger men with technique and 

1034
00:49:52,421 --> 00:49:53,230
skill.

1035
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,063
Well his brother is Hickson and his 
brother is like universally regarded as 

1036
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,124
one of the greatest Jujitsu guys,
if not the greatest of all time and he 

1037
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:05,710
was different than everybody else and 
that he did yoga.

1038
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,660
Like his thing was like I'd never heard 
of a martial artist that got into yoga,

1039
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:15,280
but hixon would do these breathing 
exercises and they do these balance beam

1040
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:16,114
exercises and he was always doing yoga 
and stretching and it was a giant part 

1041
00:50:19,571 --> 00:50:24,571
of his workout and he was above and 
beyond everyone else in his time period.

1042
00:50:25,301 --> 00:50:28,040
Like in the nineties,
everyone scared of Hixon.

1043
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,650
He was the man.
I mean,

1044
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,493
but it wasn't like there was any debate.
It's very rare that you get something 

1045
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,124
that is so antagonistic and so tightly 
contested as two men using martial arts 

1046
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:40,574
techniques trying to strangle each other
and one guy stands above all by such a 

1047
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:45,674
large margin and that was Hickson and I 
really do believe that part of it was 

1048
00:50:49,011 --> 00:50:49,844
his mind.

1049
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:50,773
Part of it was his physicality,
but a lot of that physicality was 

1050
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:56,240
enhanced by his dedication to yoga.
Oh yeah.

1051
00:50:56,241 --> 00:50:57,074
He's a legit Yogi.
Like who does that fire breathing shit 

1052
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:03,080
where he sucks his stomach in that weird
way and hasn't move up and down.

1053
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,970
You ever see someone do that?
Yeah,

1054
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,640
he does that like a,
like a real Yogi.

1055
00:51:07,641 --> 00:51:09,050
Like it's,
it's a real trip.

1056
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,950
And I think because of his,
uh,

1057
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:13,590
his,
his,

1058
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:15,620
his like physical,
like you can see there.

1059
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:17,450
He's good.
He's got this video here.

1060
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,580
You can see him do this fire breathing 
shit.

1061
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:22,550
Like watch what he does this stomach 
because it's kind of fucking crazy.

1062
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:24,860
He sucks his stomach way,
way,

1063
00:51:24,861 --> 00:51:25,694
way up deep into his rib cage.
He does this breath of fire thing and 

1064
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:32,150
then as it gets going,
he starts pumping.

1065
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,940
Is here,
see if you pull it up there,

1066
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,280
Jamie.
The part where it starts to do it.

1067
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,153
Look at this.

1068
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,090
Wow.
Yeah.

1069
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,630
Like what the fuck?
Isn't that insane?

1070
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,120
Yeah,
it's crazy.

1071
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,493
And this is one of the things he has 
abdominal muscle control gets that you 

1072
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:53,590
never try and articulate,
make it do anything.

1073
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:55,071
Well He,
you know,

1074
00:51:55,071 --> 00:51:57,470
he'd practice yoga for a long,
long,

1075
00:51:57,471 --> 00:51:57,750
long

1076
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:58,583
time and because of that he had this 
phenomenal core strength and phenomenal 

1077
00:52:02,011 --> 00:52:07,011
balance and he just had a giant 
advantage over everyone else and I think

1078
00:52:07,111 --> 00:52:07,944
a lot of that advantage was his,
his ability to move his body was 

1079
00:52:11,221 --> 00:52:12,054
different,
but it's also just for a guy like you 

1080
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,170
that's been just lifting weights for so 
long,

1081
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,820
it's the perfect antidote for your body.
It's like your body will react to like,

1082
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:21,450
oh yeah,
stretch this out.

1083
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,760
Thank you.
Thank you.

1084
00:52:22,761 --> 00:52:24,590
I've been asking for this,
you know,

1085
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:25,800
Linkedin,
this,

1086
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:28,880
hold that pose.
This is instead of just lifted something

1087
00:52:28,881 --> 00:52:31,920
that you know,
which is what men like to do.

1088
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:33,060
Instead of that,
you're

1089
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,980
holding your arms out there like that.
You're like,

1090
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:35,843
fuck,
I don't even have any weight in these 

1091
00:52:36,631 --> 00:52:39,270
things and I want to drop them.
Yeah,

1092
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,460
I've done a,
you know,

1093
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,230
every once in awhile I've worked out 
with someone else and they go,

1094
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:44,064
okay,
we're going to do this and this and 

1095
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:45,960
that.
You work with and then you let them.

1096
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:47,870
You let yourself be trained.
Yeah,

1097
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,640
and I've done a few workouts like,
go,

1098
00:52:49,641 --> 00:52:51,300
okay,
I'm going to kill you.

1099
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,120
I'm like,
okay,

1100
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,180
what does that mean?
Like by the end of this,

1101
00:52:54,181 --> 00:52:57,750
you won't be able to take your shirt off
to change and I've done,

1102
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,120
you know where you're benching this much
then this much.

1103
00:53:00,121 --> 00:53:02,460
Then this much.
You ended up doing like a hundred and 50

1104
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:07,461
reps and by the time you can't lift the 
bar and you can't lift your arms,

1105
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:11,310
you're literally trembling from 
exhaustion and I've told that to people.

1106
00:53:11,311 --> 00:53:12,360
They go,
that's yoga.

1107
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,223
You will tremble from exhaustion and 
you'll be so happy when you leave 

1108
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,570
because of how good you feel and you 
can't wait to go back and you won't blow

1109
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:23,880
your joints out the way you will with 
lifting.

1110
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,380
I already have.
Yeah,

1111
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:26,050
there's no

1112
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,570
way around it.
I've paid.

1113
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:29,410
Yeah,
you,

1114
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:32,270
I did a thing the other day,
uh,

1115
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:37,350
on advice of Heidi,
the manager and Joey Diaz.

1116
00:53:37,891 --> 00:53:40,560
I tried that Cryo cryotherapy.
Yes.

1117
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,190
And I am not,
I'm a,

1118
00:53:43,450 --> 00:53:47,430
I'm a naysayer in lowercase.
I understand why would work,

1119
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,713
and I'm not saying it's quackery,
but I just feel like I'm in an Annie 

1120
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,220
Hall scene when I walk into these places
like,

1121
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,630
because it's like super,
hey,

1122
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,464
where's that?
Whatever therapy and I'm moonlight and 

1123
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,150
this is.
And then like you shake the guy's hand,

1124
00:54:04,151 --> 00:54:07,170
he damn your breaks your arm.
These people are in incredible shape.

1125
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:09,390
And so I said,
okay,

1126
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:10,363
you know,
I got in the robe and I went into that 

1127
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:16,020
room for two minutes and 45 seconds and 
the endorphin rush,

1128
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:20,130
it's like a ups truck of endorphins.
You come out of there like,

1129
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,360
can I go back in?
And since I got out of it,

1130
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,420
all I have been thinking about is going 
back in,

1131
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:28,860
in the parking lot.

1132
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,723
I just wanted to turn around and get 
another shy and I asked the guy at the 

1133
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:34,230
counter like,
what is that goes?

1134
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:35,860
It's endorphins,
it says,

1135
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:39,780
unleashes them like fight or flight.
You just get this rush.

1136
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:40,950
I said I,
I want to go back.

1137
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:42,510
He said,
come and see us again sometime.

1138
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:43,973
But um,
it was incredible and is not long like 

1139
00:54:46,591 --> 00:54:48,960
you're out of there before you know it.
Ten minutes you're in and out.

1140
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,000
Yeah.
But wow,

1141
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,893
it me on and I know that a lot of 
athletes and I know that you use it a 

1142
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,630
Joey Diaz,
but all the brochure,

1143
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:03,090
nearly all these sports teams,
like it's just part of what you do,

1144
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,880
but one thing that has been proven to do
it,

1145
00:55:04,881 --> 00:55:05,714
there's a lot of naysayers when it comes
to this even scientist apparently that 

1146
00:55:08,431 --> 00:55:09,264
don't exercise,
but people that do exercise and do try 

1147
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:14,280
it all pretty much universally regarded 
as being beneficial.

1148
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,113
But one of the things that's been shown 
in clinical studies is that it reduces 

1149
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,230
and it produces more anti inflammatory 
bodies in the blood.

1150
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,030
It is,
that's what I was.

1151
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:23,863
Yeah.
So it,

1152
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,060
it does reduce inflammation in your body
and it just.

1153
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:30,360
But I think just for the mood elevation 
it's worth doing.

1154
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,610
I mean,
it does say that nor epinephrin released

1155
00:55:32,611 --> 00:55:34,010
that you get when you get out of there,
it's,

1156
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,540
it's unbelievable.
You get that.

1157
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,310
It wasn't subtle.
It was like,

1158
00:55:38,311 --> 00:55:40,980
wow.
And the sun feels great in your face and

1159
00:55:40,981 --> 00:55:41,814
you get outside.
You're like,

1160
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,340
ah,
everything felt great.

1161
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:44,860
I mean,
I,

1162
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:49,860
I don't do much as far as stimulants,
like coffee and aspirin I guess.

1163
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,280
Uh,
so I'm not even sure what the effect is,

1164
00:55:53,310 --> 00:55:54,143
if at anything.
And so it doesn't take much to make me 

1165
00:55:57,001 --> 00:55:57,301
go,
well,

1166
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:58,980
that's different,
you know what I mean?

1167
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,470
And that I walked out back to the 
parking lot,

1168
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,460
like,
damn.

1169
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,060
Yeah,
that was fantastic.

1170
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:05,880
Do three and then I'd take 10 minutes 
off.

1171
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:08,460
Then I do three again.
So I do two sessions.

1172
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,430
I do two back to back.
So you go in,

1173
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:13,980
you do two or three minutes,
three minutes,

1174
00:56:13,981 --> 00:56:14,814
and then my body warms back up to like,
once your skin temperature gets around 

1175
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:19,680
84 degrees,
I'll let you get back in there.

1176
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:22,440
And then I'll go back in there again for
another three minutes.

1177
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,020
So wait,
how many in an

1178
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:25,510
like you'll go into this place?

1179
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,403
Three minutes and then I wait for 10 
minutes and then I go on for another 

1180
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:30,620
three minutes.
So usually to two sessions.

1181
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,980
Two sessions in one visit?
Yes.

1182
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,540
Yeah.
And how many times?

1183
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,270
How often?
How many times a month whenever I can.

1184
00:56:37,271 --> 00:56:39,070
But I've been mixing it up more with 
Sauna.

1185
00:56:39,071 --> 00:56:43,060
I've been doing a lot of sauna lately.
I kinda like that as much if not more.

1186
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,250
Sauna,
sauna,

1187
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,113
sauna seems to be really good for muscle
injuries and something about the sauna 

1188
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:53,350
for anytime to like muscle tissue or 
soreness or weird shit.

1189
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:56,830
Sauna just blows that all out and so on.
Is also one of those things.

1190
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,770
It's what it is,
is your body reacting to extremes,

1191
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:00,604
right?
Whether it's extreme cold or extreme 

1192
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:02,344
heat,
your body produces heat shock proteins 

1193
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:04,654
and cold truck proteins and all those 
things are doing is reducing 

1194
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:07,740
inflammation.
That's,

1195
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,380
that's the number one thing.

1196
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,620
Like you want to feel better,
reduce inflammation,

1197
00:57:11,621 --> 00:57:12,454
and this,
one of the best ways to manipulate your 

1198
00:57:13,541 --> 00:57:17,320
body is either through carf cryotherapy 
or through sauna.

1199
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:20,380
Both of those things are amazing.
Yeah.

1200
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,170
Someone I know that she says it's all 
about inflammation.

1201
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,810
GotTa beat the inflammation and cut out 
all the sugar.

1202
00:57:25,811 --> 00:57:27,580
Cut out the carbs,
cut out all the bread,

1203
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:30,010
cut it all the alcohol.
If you can do that,

1204
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:33,250
you'll massively reduce inflammation and
that's for Gospel is all that.

1205
00:57:33,251 --> 00:57:36,100
That's nothing good in there for you?
Yeah man.

1206
00:57:36,101 --> 00:57:38,620
And once your body gets used to it too,
that's what's really interesting.

1207
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:41,830
You didn't even really crave it anymore.
Like I still like ice cream.

1208
00:57:41,831 --> 00:57:44,200
I still enjoy like a dessert or 
something like that,

1209
00:57:44,201 --> 00:57:45,034
but it doesn't have the same impact that
he used to like I see a sandwich and I 

1210
00:57:48,261 --> 00:57:48,850
go,
oh,

1211
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,250
get that sandwich.
Like that Pastrami Sandwich,

1212
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,160
big thick bread and that doesn't do it 
for me anymore.

1213
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,890
I don't.
It doesn't recognize what that is like.

1214
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:58,750
Well that's the trick.
That's the trick.

1215
00:57:58,751 --> 00:57:59,860
That's not even really food.

1216
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:01,163
Yeah.
I,

1217
00:58:01,410 --> 00:58:02,243
I don't eat as much as I used to.
I just feel so much better when I just 

1218
00:58:07,141 --> 00:58:10,440
skipped the middle meal and like,
whose idea was it?

1219
00:58:10,441 --> 00:58:12,510
Three meals a day anyway.
You don't need to.

1220
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:13,403
Right.
And I found that I can live very 

1221
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,553
comfortably.
I'm not into like torturing myself so 

1222
00:58:18,151 --> 00:58:21,330
like I'm going to starve and nail myself
to this chair,

1223
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:22,673
but you know,
if I'm too distracted to work as I'm 

1224
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:25,734
hungry I need to address that.
But what I found is if I just kind of 

1225
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,263
don't eat a lot after a couple of days,
I'm like a jet in the high air where 

1226
00:58:35,671 --> 00:58:36,504
you're burning no fuel because you're 
just in the thin air where I walked pie 

1227
00:58:39,961 --> 00:58:41,220
food going like,
Nah,

1228
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:42,533
I've had like two meals in the last two 
and a half meals like in the last three 

1229
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:47,880
days.
And I feel fine actually.

1230
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:48,713
I feel like really bouncy,
like I don't need the postworkout seven 

1231
00:58:52,621 --> 00:58:54,130
minute power nap.
I,

1232
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,720
I'm feeling really good.
Do you do intermittent fasting at all?

1233
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:00,330
Um,
yes.

1234
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,150
On the,
the woman I work with,

1235
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,193
you know Heidi,
she does that sometimes and I'll just 

1236
00:59:06,361 --> 00:59:08,130
follow her lead.
So she'll go,

1237
00:59:08,131 --> 00:59:09,240
hey,
let me do this.

1238
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,700
I'll try that because I just don't know 
this stuff.

1239
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,010
And she knows a lot more about it than I
do.

1240
00:59:14,011 --> 00:59:19,011
So I just do what she does and so a few 
years ago I had got into like one meal a

1241
00:59:19,891 --> 00:59:21,170
day.
I was just trying it out,

1242
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,093
no one told me to.
I was in India of all places and I was 

1243
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:25,784
out all day taking photos and sweating 
and I would eat dinner and that will be 

1244
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,930
it and I would sleep through breakfast 
and go back out and with my camera.

1245
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:33,883
So dinner became my meal and the first 
three days of that was a little tough 

1246
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,310
and then it was like I never wanted.

1247
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:44,480
I kind of felt bad when I went back to 
the western or I'm eating a lot of food.

1248
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:46,280
Your body adapts.
Yeah,

1249
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,343
well we can adapt.
You can live on pizza for the rest of 

1250
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,750
your life very happily all,
you know,

1251
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:52,760
whatever.
But your body really does adapt to that.

1252
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:54,380
Intermittent.
That time will know what I'm saying.

1253
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:55,214
It'll adapt to anything.
It'll adapt to too much food and little 

1254
00:59:57,240 --> 01:00:01,130
depth to like a fraction of what you 
used to eat right here.

1255
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:01,964
But just,
here's what I have found when I start 

1256
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:06,620
limiting the food,
I'm more alert,

1257
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,960
my sleep is more restorative and I 
bounce out of bed,

1258
01:00:11,961 --> 01:00:16,961
like just flying out of bed.
I don't have that afternoon drowsiness.

1259
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,120
I just stay with it and I just feel way 
more buoyant and present a type faster,

1260
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:28,380
just concentrate more.
And if I,

1261
01:00:28,381 --> 01:00:29,214
I,
when I'm on tour it's usually I do one 

1262
01:00:31,431 --> 01:00:34,190
point something meals a day like I'm 
about to leave on tour.

1263
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,610
It'll be,
it's an evening meal post show.

1264
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:37,633
I put myself into an eight hour feeding 
window and 16 hour fasting window every 

1265
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:42,763
day.
And I've been pretty consistent with 

1266
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:45,800
that over the last like four or five 
months.

1267
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,810
And as a,
it has a big impact man.

1268
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,490
When you,
when I eat dinner,

1269
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,440
you know,
say if I'm done at 8:00,

1270
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,573
just I just time it out.
Sixteen hours later is when my first 

1271
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:56,114
meal comes.
I can have a coffee in between now and 

1272
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:58,933
then.
But nothing with any real significant 

1273
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:03,410
calories.
I'm just having some liquid or something

1274
01:01:03,411 --> 01:01:04,370
like that.
And that's it.

1275
01:01:04,371 --> 01:01:06,860
And then it just,
by doing that man,

1276
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:10,220
just like a wake up in the morning,
I'm not craving breakfast,

1277
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,360
I'm not,
I'm not even hungry.

1278
01:01:11,361 --> 01:01:13,880
My body's just totally adapted to.
Yeah,

1279
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:14,923
just gives your body a chance to digest.
I think we're always in a state of 

1280
01:01:17,631 --> 01:01:21,220
feeding and your body just never has 
really a chance to digest it.

1281
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:22,330
Juggling,
you know,

1282
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,510
the body's like as it's processing,
it's incoming,

1283
01:01:26,511 --> 01:01:27,344
like really another order.
So it never gets to realize digestion 

1284
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:33,580
and we're done.
It's always in your like a cow.

1285
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:34,863
They're always processing nutrition.
And I wonder if that's a western model 

1286
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,790
because in other parts of the world,
people live very differently than we do.

1287
01:01:45,820 --> 01:01:46,960
It just,
it is what it is.

1288
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,273
And a meal is.
It's almost just a thing that happens 

1289
01:01:51,491 --> 01:01:54,310
now in then.
It's not like it's dinner time and we're

1290
01:01:54,311 --> 01:01:57,790
going to talk about report cards and 
gathering.

1291
01:01:57,791 --> 01:02:02,320
It's like the whole family works all 
over the city and they're going to eat.

1292
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:06,490
I think at some point wherever even 
sleep you go to like Parse,

1293
01:02:06,491 --> 01:02:07,324
like Vietnam and people just like 
sleeping behind the counter of the 

1294
01:02:10,061 --> 01:02:10,894
store.
They work at because they've been for a 

1295
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,320
day and a half because mom can't come 
in.

1296
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:15,154
So there were you running the store and 
the sleep business thing that you get 

1297
01:02:17,711 --> 01:02:19,980
now and then.
And I think food is

1298
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,360
like that in a lot of parts of the 
world,

1299
01:02:21,361 --> 01:02:22,194
like a meal a wouldn't.
The next time I eat will be the next 

1300
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,450
time I eat.
When you go to these places,

1301
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,580
and I know you traveled pretty much all 
over the world,

1302
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:34,850
do you go out of your way to try to 
sample in as wide a variety as the local

1303
01:02:35,011 --> 01:02:35,910
cuisines?
You can.

1304
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:36,793
No,
no.

1305
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:42,180
Depends on where I go and I'm not that 
guy who just brings it all from home and

1306
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:47,181
I never leave home when I'm abroad,
but I can't afford to eat a bad meal and

1307
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:51,570
be bedridden,
bedridden for the next day when I should

1308
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:53,850
be out hitting the streets,
looking at stuff.

1309
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:55,830
And so I've had,
you know,

1310
01:02:55,831 --> 01:02:56,664
as you do,
you run into the bad meal where you're 

1311
01:02:58,321 --> 01:03:01,530
like hugging a tree,
watching the arc of vomit,

1312
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:02,580
like wow,
Linda Blair.

1313
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:08,390
And I've done that from here to a 
Myenmar and Russia,

1314
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:10,020
wherever I've had some bad meals.

1315
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:14,670
And so when the food looks dodgy,
like in the interior of Africa where you

1316
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,130
pointed the meat object and go,
what is that?

1317
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:17,983
And the guy will say,
I think it's goat Clif bar just because 

1318
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:26,340
I just can't.
And so what I've learned to do,

1319
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:28,770
and it's hard on your back because it's 
a lot of weight.

1320
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:32,490
I take say I'm going to be out in Africa
for two weeks.

1321
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,260
I bring about two meals worth of chow 
with me.

1322
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,390
That's a lot of nuts.
A lot of cliff bars,

1323
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:41,160
a lot of like peanut butter and you 
know,

1324
01:03:41,161 --> 01:03:41,994
things that just don't go bad.
And heat where I can just look at the 

1325
01:03:45,871 --> 01:03:47,160
food and gum.
No,

1326
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,023
not tonight.
It's going to be a handful of almonds 

1327
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:54,430
and this and water.
Also in parts of the world where water's

1328
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,890
dodgy,
you find a store,

1329
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,473
you buy the box of water,
rip it open to make sure it hasn't been 

1330
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:01,410
tampered with by the whole box.

1331
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:05,610
Put it in your backpack and look 40 
pounds of water for the next five days.

1332
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:08,980
It sucks,
but you can't be somewhere and go like,

1333
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:09,903
I'm thirsty and I don't know about that 
water because they have these portable 

1334
01:04:14,071 --> 01:04:14,904
backpack filters and stary pens and 
things that a lot of backpack hikers 

1335
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,401
they use.
Uh,

1336
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:20,970
they're,
they're very small now.

1337
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,550
They're very small and lightweight and 
you can get some,

1338
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:26,040
like if you're staying in a place that 
you think it has dodgy water,

1339
01:04:26,041 --> 01:04:28,980
you can get a gravity filter.
You put water,

1340
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:31,380
like you can literally get rain water 
from outside in a puddle.

1341
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,214
And I know a lot of people do that and 
they take it and they put it in this 

1342
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:35,244
large gravity filter in a drip down,
almost like it looks like someone's 

1343
01:04:38,371 --> 01:04:42,330
peeing at the bottom of this huge bag of
60 liter bag of water,

1344
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:46,320
but it filters at all and it allows you 
to drink basically puddle water,

1345
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,071
right?
No,

1346
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:52,071
I've never gotten that high tech.
I've been in some pretty dodgy places,

1347
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:53,993
but I've always been somewhere in prep 
like a city before I go into the 

1348
01:04:58,621 --> 01:05:00,420
countryside where I go,
okay,

1349
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:03,210
it's going to be five days before I see 
anything like this again,

1350
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:06,360
so I'm provisioning for eight days.
That's a good one,

1351
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,194
but usually google stary pen,
you should get one of these things 

1352
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:11,370
because this,
this thing is so,

1353
01:05:11,371 --> 01:05:12,204
so simple.
It's like it basically looks like a pen 

1354
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:17,980
and it works with ultraviolet light and 
you put it in like say if

1355
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,050
you have a glass of water,
you just stir this into water.

1356
01:05:20,051 --> 01:05:22,150
It kills everything in the water.
Everything.

1357
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:22,901
Wow.
Yeah.

1358
01:05:22,901 --> 01:05:25,030
It'll still give us this.
There it is right there.

1359
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,013
So if there's buffalo pis and the water,
it's still going to smell like buffalo 

1360
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:29,824
pissed.
It's not gonna kill you and it won't 

1361
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,490
give you Giardia and it won't give you 
anything else.

1362
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,211
Oh,
that's smart.

1363
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,500
Yeah,
and it's not big.

1364
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:37,240
It's a small little device.
You see it,

1365
01:05:37,250 --> 01:05:38,660
this handheld,
these,

1366
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:39,970
those are drugs.
That's smart.

1367
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,800
Yeah.
I think that's a different thing.

1368
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:42,700
Yeah.
Yeah,

1369
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:47,701
because there's parts of mainly Africa 
where you go really in the water,

1370
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:51,730
like that's a lot of sketches,
drinking,

1371
01:05:52,170 --> 01:05:54,010
like clearing the larva out of the way.
I'm like,

1372
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:56,080
don't do that.
What do you mean that's,

1373
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,600
that's our water.
My good friend Justin Wren,

1374
01:05:58,601 --> 01:06:01,930
he runs a charity called fight for the 
forgotten where they build wells for the

1375
01:06:01,931 --> 01:06:02,764
pygmies in the Congo and he's had 
malaria three times from going over 

1376
01:06:06,011 --> 01:06:06,190
there.

1377
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:07,780
Yeah,
and he's A.

1378
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:11,170
He's a beautiful human being like this 
guy sacrifices so much.

1379
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:13,840
He's in the Congo several months out of 
every year.

1380
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:15,610
Tough,
dangerous.

1381
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:16,533
It's very dangerous and you know,
he's got some crazy stories about it 

1382
01:06:18,731 --> 01:06:19,930
too,
but you know,

1383
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,310
these people that you see little 
children with horrible distended bellies

1384
01:06:24,311 --> 01:06:27,010
because they're filled with parasites 
and it's heartbreaking.

1385
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,810
A lot of it is clean water and so 
they're developing their.

1386
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:31,644
There initially partnered up with water 
four and now he's kind of doing it all 

1387
01:06:33,731 --> 01:06:35,650
on his own,
but in through this,

1388
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:38,980
one of my responses called the cash app 
and through the cash app,

1389
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:40,273
we've already raised thousands of 
dollars to build several wells in the 

1390
01:06:43,091 --> 01:06:43,924
Congo.
We're constantly raising more money and 

1391
01:06:45,581 --> 01:06:48,400
building more wells and it changes their
life.

1392
01:06:48,401 --> 01:06:52,540
If free actual clear water that comes 
out of the ground,

1393
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,910
he see these people celebrating and 
dancing.

1394
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:57,880
When the wells get turned on like this 
is so powerful.

1395
01:06:57,881 --> 01:06:59,530
You just think of water is like,
Oh hey,

1396
01:06:59,531 --> 01:07:01,150
here's some water.
I've got a bottle.

1397
01:07:01,360 --> 01:07:02,950
But to them it's,
it's everything,

1398
01:07:02,970 --> 01:07:03,100
right?

1399
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:03,933
Yeah.
I've been working on and off with the 

1400
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:06,833
Water Ngo for many years called drop in 
the bucket and I've been to Uganda and 

1401
01:07:09,881 --> 01:07:14,340
south Sudan with them.
They drill it schools and you know,

1402
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:17,860
as a Westerner of water system thing,
we sing in the shower with,

1403
01:07:17,861 --> 01:07:18,401
you know,
it's just like,

1404
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,790
it's always around,
you know,

1405
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:20,624
you trip over the bottles.
There's so much water in other parts of 

1406
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:25,120
the world as you know,
not so much.

1407
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:26,373
And when you,
when you see the impact of water on the 

1408
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:29,073
school,
there's so many things you don't think 

1409
01:07:29,801 --> 01:07:30,634
about.
And so I was at this one school where 

1410
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:34,180
they had drilled,
dropping the bucket,

1411
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:37,690
had drilled before and we were there to 
visit the well and meet the kids.

1412
01:07:38,170 --> 01:07:39,560
Uh,
in Masaka it's,

1413
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:40,433
I think north of Kampala and what one of
the drop in the bucket people said is 

1414
01:07:45,391 --> 01:07:48,610
like they now have toilets and running 
water.

1415
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:52,090
Do you understand what that means for 
female literacy?

1416
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:55,420
I'm like,
what do you mean a woman?

1417
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:58,330
A girl hits a certain age.
She goes through a major,

1418
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,193
major physiological change.
If there's not running water in a way 

1419
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:02,434
for her to clean herself up,
there's a lot of potential shame and 

1420
01:08:05,861 --> 01:08:09,370
self consciousness.
You stopped going to school because it's

1421
01:08:09,371 --> 01:08:14,371
not a way to keep yourself together and 
you stopped your learning stops at young

1422
01:08:16,191 --> 01:08:19,250
adulthood.
But with running water in a way to,

1423
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,460
you know,
as we westerners do,

1424
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,353
so you know,
easily you keep yourself a hygienic and 

1425
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:27,560
you can go back to class and learn to 
read.

1426
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:30,890
And I was like,
I'd never would've thought of that had I

1427
01:08:30,891 --> 01:08:35,690
not come on this trip and it hit me like
a truck because he's the water.

1428
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,940
I'm thirsty.
Water means so much more.

1429
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:40,850
Just dignity.
Like I want to be clean.

1430
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:41,863
You and me,
we throw our clothes in the laundry 

1431
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:45,170
everyday.
Clean clothes.

1432
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:46,004
I mean,
you see these women walking eight miles 

1433
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:50,960
each way with the jerry cans of water.
Some of that's for drinking.

1434
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:51,853
A lot of it's for cleaning clothes 
because they're sending their kid to a 

1435
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:56,350
school and want the kid,
you know,

1436
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,750
human dignity,
water and all of that is a big,

1437
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,630
you know,
you can't have dignity without the water

1438
01:09:02,631 --> 01:09:05,730
because water means I don't stink and 
you must take me.

1439
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,673
You must respect me as a person because 
I don't smell like I've been living in 

1440
01:09:09,831 --> 01:09:12,020
these clothes for a week.
And um,

1441
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:17,110
I learned a lot of that by traveling.
But traveling with that NGO was a,

1442
01:09:17,361 --> 01:09:18,650
you know,
like going to class.

1443
01:09:18,651 --> 01:09:20,420
It was huge.
Yeah,

1444
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:21,140
man,
that's,

1445
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:22,330
that's,
that's know.

1446
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:24,110
That's something I never would have 
considered.

1447
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:26,280
And human dignity.
You know,

1448
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:31,520
why we have a lot of angry people in the
world because you and I as Westerners,

1449
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:37,180
we don't suffer the indignities that we 
don't suffer that a lot of people in the

1450
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,820
world work hard to not suffer.

1451
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:41,910
Like they have to go like,
okay,

1452
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,330
I have to go get the water today.
You know,

1453
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:45,164
that's a long trip.
Got to walk to Long Beach and back to 

1454
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:52,270
get the water because there's no tap and
I got kids and you know,

1455
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,203
infants and I got to make this work 
because I can't have my family stinking 

1456
01:09:58,940 --> 01:09:59,773
and I got to do the cooking and 
hopefully you don't get eaten by a 

1457
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,250
crocodile and were taught by a monkey.
The monkey.

1458
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:06,830
They smell the water and they,
they mug you for the water.

1459
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:07,730
Really?
Yeah.

1460
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:08,923
Um,
they just assault yield bite and he 

1461
01:10:10,051 --> 01:10:10,884
grabbed the water,
knock it over and just lick it off the 

1462
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:13,004
ground.
Yet people get assaulted in dry season 

1463
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:15,890
by monkeys.
Wow.

1464
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,580
Yeah.
So these creeps.

1465
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:22,460
But just you see what people do.
They're not trying to be rockstars.

1466
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,323
All they want to do is what you and I do
just without even thinking twice and 

1467
01:10:27,711 --> 01:10:28,220
that,
you know,

1468
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:31,190
it's made me as an older guy,
I'm pushing 60.

1469
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:35,960
It's made me really reconsider human 
relationships,

1470
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:40,040
like our current political climate,
the way people talk to each other now.

1471
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:40,874
It's sometimes kind of terrifying and it
makes me really reconsider human 

1472
01:10:45,351 --> 01:10:48,260
dignity,
respect patients.

1473
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:50,420
Like there's a lot of people like I 
disagree with,

1474
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,480
but they're coming from something real,
like something very real there,

1475
01:10:56,390 --> 01:11:01,390
an honest propelled them to make that 
sign or to do that thing and the,

1476
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:03,793
the cause and effect.
I think there may be wrongheaded what 

1477
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,083
the causes real.
And the effect is sincerely the action 

1478
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:13,680
of sincerely held

1479
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:19,130
that the motivation and it's that kind 
of travel and looking how,

1480
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:21,150
looking at how people,
they don't want much,

1481
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:24,720
they just want to get by by and large.
And um,

1482
01:11:25,950 --> 01:11:30,950
it's made me reconsider kind of how I 
virtually everyone out in the world.

1483
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,330
Um,
I think I'm getting better at it because

1484
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:35,070
it's so hard.
It is hard.

1485
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:38,910
But I think if you pay attention to it 
and you keep concentrating on,

1486
01:11:38,911 --> 01:11:40,770
as you get older you do get better at 
it.

1487
01:11:40,771 --> 01:11:41,604
And the idea that someone who's almost 
60 is still learning like that is just 

1488
01:11:45,421 --> 01:11:46,710
how we are,
you know,

1489
01:11:46,730 --> 01:11:47,563
and we have this weird idea that people 
are static and they meet a guy and he's 

1490
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:54,060
70 when you meet him when he's 75 is 
going to be the same guy if not worse,

1491
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:56,640
but no people,
they're capable of growth.

1492
01:11:56,641 --> 01:11:59,280
As long as they're alive and and 
motivated,

1493
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:02,310
you'll,
you'll grow as much as you want to ask.

1494
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:05,370
And I've met 70 year old who wear me 
out.

1495
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,600
I'm like,
I can't keep up with this.

1496
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:09,690
Like I go in some little cool eco travel
trips.

1497
01:12:09,691 --> 01:12:11,580
You go like Antarctica and these old 
fuck,

1498
01:12:11,581 --> 01:12:12,460
come on.
You're like,

1499
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,340
I can't.
You go to take a photo or shorts.

1500
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,753
And then you meet people who are 22 and 
they're so burned out and they're so 

1501
01:12:20,431 --> 01:12:21,510
hard to be around.
Like,

1502
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:23,460
man,
if I had your youth,

1503
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:26,580
I'd be bouncing off the planet.
What are you doing?

1504
01:12:26,790 --> 01:12:27,623
And it's just a mindset and you know,
all kinds of surrounding factors and 

1505
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:34,650
forces.
But it's really just what you want to do

1506
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:35,583
at a certain part of your life.
I have very little sympathy for adults 

1507
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:39,930
in that.
You're 35.

1508
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,810
This is all you pal,
your addictions,

1509
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:45,830
your crap marriage,
that's all you like.

1510
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,790
I don't have that much.
Well,

1511
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:48,630
I did so much coke.

1512
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,463
I don't have a house anymore.
That's a lot of coke and I'm sorry that 

1513
01:12:54,331 --> 01:12:57,780
you're living in a box or in a van down 
by the river.

1514
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:00,660
But come on man.
That's a long hill.

1515
01:13:00,661 --> 01:13:01,680
You slid down.
Yeah.

1516
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:06,000
So get up and don't do it.
Don't make the same mistake.

1517
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,080
But adults.
Come on,

1518
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:07,914
man.
You know who you are at this point and 

1519
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:11,370
you,
you know what you can be.

1520
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,800
And at this point I,
I abhor rudeness.

1521
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:15,990
I hate it.
And I hate it when I'm rude.

1522
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:16,711
I'm like,
damn,

1523
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:19,770
I have to punish myself.
And so I,

1524
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:20,663
as I get older,
I'm working as best as I can to be more 

1525
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:25,044
clear,
to be more polite and more patient just 

1526
01:13:28,021 --> 01:13:32,620
so I'm more it unavoidable.
Like onstage,

1527
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,473
I don't curse,
so there's no way you can marginalize 

1528
01:13:36,811 --> 01:13:38,800
me.
Even when you're doing your,

1529
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:39,643
you're live speaking shows,
you have these discussions and you're 

1530
01:13:42,361 --> 01:13:44,400
talking about crazy things that you've 
seen.

1531
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:46,770
You don't swear.
How many times have I sworn in this room

1532
01:13:46,771 --> 01:13:49,830
with you right now on that today?
I don't think you have.

1533
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:51,630
I haven't.
I keep track.

1534
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,090
Why is that?
Um,

1535
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,190
many years ago,
almost 10 years ago,

1536
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:57,563
I was going out with a woman who never 
cursed and I work with people who don't 

1537
01:14:01,081 --> 01:14:05,070
curse in the EU.
They get their point across and I,

1538
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,083
this girl I was going out with,
she's fantastic and she never cursed in 

1539
01:14:09,121 --> 01:14:11,140
my sailor speak.
I was like,

1540
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:11,974
wow,

1541
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:13,083
I don't have any company here.
And also Barack Obama and presidents 

1542
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:18,653
have traditionally don't curse,
but he's had such a good way with words 

1543
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:25,270
that just admired him on the stump.
I'm sure it was all written for him,

1544
01:14:25,271 --> 01:14:27,140
but nonetheless,
I,

1545
01:14:27,141 --> 01:14:30,340
I just like how,
how the men carried himself and I said I

1546
01:14:30,341 --> 01:14:31,174
want to be more like that.
And I was just in Australia a couple of 

1547
01:14:33,641 --> 01:14:34,220
weeks ago.
Uh,

1548
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:37,060
speaking and I was on a very interesting
panel about me too.

1549
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:37,894
I was the only male on the panel is 
fascinating and a guy came up with his 

1550
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:43,180
kids like,
Hey,

1551
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:44,014
I'm a big fan and I want my kids to meet
you and my son's 11 and I want them to 

1552
01:14:48,101 --> 01:14:50,350
come see one of your shows one day.
I said,

1553
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,390
oh,
I think he should see me on my next tour

1554
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:53,870
here in 20 slash 20 will.

1555
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:54,491
He'll be like,
what?

1556
01:14:54,491 --> 01:14:56,050
13.
No problem.

1557
01:14:56,380 --> 01:14:58,750
And I'm not seeing my show is namby 
Pamby,

1558
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,970
but I want to be unavoidable where you 
can write me off.

1559
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:05,230
Say I'm wrong.
Fine.

1560
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:07,180
Disagree with me that that's fine.
Like,

1561
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,014
oh,
he's just a foul mouth so we don't have 

1562
01:15:09,101 --> 01:15:09,934
to take him seriously.
I don't want to give you that handle to 

1563
01:15:12,281 --> 01:15:15,090
jerk me around line.
I have a plenty of other handles.

1564
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,030
You can turn it around by.
Um,

1565
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:18,173
and so I'm just trying to not give 
people that angle and it forces me to 

1566
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:27,301
evolve my point of view where those 
words are fun and hyperbolic,

1567
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,640
but they just don't necessarily don't 
serve me.

1568
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:34,340
They don't get across what I want to get
across.

1569
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:35,203
That's interesting.
I would think that you're probably best 

1570
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:41,350
what you should do it anyway you want.
But what I'm.

1571
01:15:41,420 --> 01:15:46,420
What I'm thinking is that what one way 
to use those words is to have your point

1572
01:15:47,811 --> 01:15:50,720
is clear as possible and then use them 
rarely.

1573
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:51,893
You know,
like one of the things when I was 

1574
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,420
starting doing comedy back in Boston,
they would do,

1575
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:56,283
they would call the FEC meter.
They would say you don't want to go 

1576
01:15:58,221 --> 01:15:59,054
onstage and say fuck every other word.
Because a lot of people use the word 

1577
01:16:01,701 --> 01:16:04,260
fuck and place of the word Om.
You know,

1578
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:07,190
they're like fucking guides fucking says
to me,

1579
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:09,080
fucking,
I don't want to fucking tell you what to

1580
01:16:09,081 --> 01:16:12,800
fucking do that as you're just poor 
communication.

1581
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,930
This is a shitty economy of words.

1582
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,740
So that word you've given it,
you've used it so many times,

1583
01:16:18,980 --> 01:16:21,680
you've given away all its meaning.
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

1584
01:16:21,770 --> 01:16:22,910
So when you do,
and I'm like,

1585
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,190
fuck you.
It doesn't mean anything anymore.

1586
01:16:25,220 --> 01:16:27,060
Yeah.
But if you say it like once a year,

1587
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:29,810
if you say fuck you once a year,
it means a lot.

1588
01:16:29,900 --> 01:16:31,370
Everyone will believe it.
Yes.

1589
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:33,140
Like,
oh,

1590
01:16:33,141 --> 01:16:34,760
he's serious.
But yeah,

1591
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,100
if you just drop it all the time.
And I,

1592
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:38,540
you know,
I believe in the first amendment.

1593
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:42,050
But um,
to me it's when you use that stuff,

1594
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:47,090
you come in as one thing,
but everyone you kind of read the result

1595
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:51,530
is something else to sell a lot of 
people in front of some people's eyes.

1596
01:16:51,531 --> 01:16:52,161
Yeah.
I mean,

1597
01:16:52,161 --> 01:16:56,240
you certainly limit your,
a digestability yeah.

1598
01:16:56,270 --> 01:16:58,760
And impact,
you know,

1599
01:16:58,761 --> 01:16:59,594
I,
I'd rather be articulate than 

1600
01:17:01,881 --> 01:17:03,950
overbearing and I,
you know,

1601
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:06,890
I watched the news and some of these 
pundits are very,

1602
01:17:06,891 --> 01:17:08,900
very educated and they're very,
very sharp.

1603
01:17:08,901 --> 01:17:10,220
They're for living,
they

1604
01:17:10,370 --> 01:17:11,203
comp,
they make commentary for a living and 

1605
01:17:12,771 --> 01:17:14,570
they're damn good at it.
And you're like,

1606
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:16,790
wow,
that's a hell of a sentence.

1607
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:20,190
I might like to be able to have rock,
something like that Monday.

1608
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,080
And um,
that's,

1609
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,290
that's kind of what I admire as a,
you know,

1610
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,250
I start shrinking with age.
Well,

1611
01:17:28,251 --> 01:17:29,084
as you know,
it's interesting that the difference 

1612
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:33,230
between writing something and saying 
something,

1613
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:34,393
so as you do your spoken word shows and 
you have these stories that you want to 

1614
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:39,824
tell,
but I would imagine that you probably 

1615
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:46,691
write out a good most of it.
Do you do that or do some of it?

1616
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:50,900
You just know the story so you just tell
the story the way.

1617
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:53,630
When I'm out in the world,
I'll be out all day,

1618
01:17:53,631 --> 01:17:56,450
like taking photos or whatever,
fooling with the locals,

1619
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:57,284
getting information.
Then I come back somewhere and I write 

1620
01:18:00,231 --> 01:18:02,150
it up or we'll take,
you know,

1621
01:18:02,151 --> 01:18:04,970
sometimes you're in a place like Haiti,
you don't want to be outside at noon.

1622
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,700
The Sun will just like beat you up so 
you find shade,

1623
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:08,563
make your notes.
So I'm always trying to make notes and 

1624
01:18:10,191 --> 01:18:14,060
then at night I write it all up a lot.
That turns into a book,

1625
01:18:14,180 --> 01:18:16,970
like I use every part of the deer.
Like when I go somewhere,

1626
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:20,660
I make soup jewelry,
a coat.

1627
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,210
Every part gets used.
And so,

1628
01:18:23,570 --> 01:18:25,820
um,
the books come from that,

1629
01:18:25,821 --> 01:18:26,654
but some stories from those travels,
I mold them over in my mind and I like 

1630
01:18:33,080 --> 01:18:36,640
the show for me when I'm onstage,
you just can't be mere rapport.

1631
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,440
Tosh,
there has to be something,

1632
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,340
there has to be an aroma coming from it,
there has to be built,

1633
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:43,633
there has to be,
uh,

1634
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:44,840
something that,
uh,

1635
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,340
wisdom or some kind of melody that comes
from the raw information.

1636
01:18:49,341 --> 01:18:51,650
Like I took all these notes and got the 
houses,

1637
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,330
the holy album,
which is just,

1638
01:18:53,370 --> 01:18:56,210
if it's component parts,
but it was mixed together in a way where

1639
01:18:56,211 --> 01:18:57,410
it's like this beautiful thing.

1640
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:01,220
And so that often takes weeks were like,
so I,

1641
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:02,293
I saw this,
what was the story where the guy fell 

1642
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:05,840
over?
But no,

1643
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:08,300
it wasn't six weeks of thinking about 
it.

1644
01:19:08,301 --> 01:19:10,190
It wasn't him.
He's not the story.

1645
01:19:10,730 --> 01:19:13,220
It's the guy who is watching and did 
nothing.

1646
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:14,533
That's the story.
And all of a sudden the whole angle 

1647
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,043
changes.
And so I'll mull these things over 

1648
01:19:20,571 --> 01:19:22,220
because I have a lot of time.
I live alone.

1649
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,130
And so by the time a story gets to the 
stage,

1650
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,030
it's like a stone that's been rolled in 
polished and I will.

1651
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:32,510
There's parts of the valley,
Ventura Boulevard where at night there's

1652
01:19:32,511 --> 01:19:35,660
nothing but dog walkers and joggers.
All the shops are closed.

1653
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:40,960
I will park in a parking lot and I'll 
walk about a mile each way.

1654
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:45,150
Talking out loud.
He saying the stories out loud.

1655
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:46,910
Know you're looking for you now.
Yeah.

1656
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,530
Henry's practice.
That is one man show.

1657
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,470
That's why I don't get the location 
because you will go,

1658
01:19:51,471 --> 01:19:52,970
wow,
I remember that one.

1659
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,780
Um,
and I will let my brain here,

1660
01:19:56,781 --> 01:20:00,470
my voice say them and I'll make edits 
while I'm walking.

1661
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:00,831
Like,
okay,

1662
01:20:00,831 --> 01:20:01,880
no,
that's a dead end.

1663
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,230
And,
and I,

1664
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,830
and I've been doing this for years and I
do it on the treadmill and my,

1665
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,153
you know,
like I'll just kind of mumble to myself 

1666
01:20:09,961 --> 01:20:11,370
where people will come over to Jim,
like,

1667
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:12,730
are you okay?
Like,

1668
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,321
yeah,
I'm just,

1669
01:20:13,321 --> 01:20:15,150
you know,
just say actor.

1670
01:20:15,151 --> 01:20:16,380
And they'll go,
oh yeah,

1671
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:17,683
know that that's the kind of preparation
I do because I don't believe in warmup 

1672
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,910
shows.
Like who wants to see her warm up show?

1673
01:20:23,911 --> 01:20:25,290
I go,
thanks for your demo.

1674
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:27,180
Like screw you,
I paid money,

1675
01:20:27,380 --> 01:20:28,213
I won a game,
and so I only understand come in with 

1676
01:20:32,251 --> 01:20:33,084
the a game and so I do all my 
woodshedding alone and so by the time I 

1677
01:20:37,351 --> 01:20:38,184
hit stage it's that story is very 
evolved and then it continues to every 

1678
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:42,810
night,
you know,

1679
01:20:42,811 --> 01:20:43,644
I keep shading the parts off and it's a 
chiseled thing of beauty a few nights 

1680
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:47,730
in.

1681
01:20:47,730 --> 01:20:48,563
Yeah.
I found that you really can only do so 

1682
01:20:49,741 --> 01:20:52,650
much on the written page or on the 
screen.

1683
01:20:52,980 --> 01:20:55,410
You have to evolve it in front of a live
audience,

1684
01:20:55,411 --> 01:20:57,990
especially with xander up,
which you're essentially doing.

1685
01:20:57,991 --> 01:20:59,880
You're pretty much,
you're doing very.

1686
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:00,813
I mean I listened to a bunch of your 
older stuff and it's essentially a form 

1687
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:05,120
of standup.
Yup.

1688
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:08,310
It's like there's different kinds of 
music,

1689
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:09,480
right?
I mean there's rock and roll,

1690
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,590
there's blues,
there's jazz,

1691
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:12,240
there's different kinds of standup as 
well.

1692
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,750
Yours is a storytelling standup.
Yeah.

1693
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:16,763
And with that,
it's going to evolve in front of the 

1694
01:21:18,421 --> 01:21:19,254
live audience will,
like on my showtime special tomorrow 

1695
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:23,250
night,
tomorrow night at 10 on showtime,

1696
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:25,410
showtime.
You'll hear stories and that's,

1697
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:30,270
I'll keep talking to them.
And a lot of that is just storytelling.

1698
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,100
And it is funny.
I mean,

1699
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,283
but I always leave room in my resume 
because I don't want to tie myself to 

1700
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:43,140
comedy because when I'm telling the 
story about the,

1701
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,143
the,
the part of wherever I would like 

1702
01:21:47,340 --> 01:21:49,740
Bangladesh I was in that wasn't funny.

1703
01:21:49,950 --> 01:21:52,230
I don't want to be in a comedy club with
some guy going,

1704
01:21:52,231 --> 01:21:53,670
wait a minute,
I didn't pay for this.

1705
01:21:53,671 --> 01:21:54,750
You make me laugh,
idiot.

1706
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:59,040
And so I don't want to be selling a 
false bill of goods.

1707
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,700
And so,
uh,

1708
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,110
sometimes it's quite often it's funny,
but sometimes it's not.

1709
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:06,900
But for me,
events plus time,

1710
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:10,560
if someone didn't,
if there are no casualties,

1711
01:22:10,590 --> 01:22:14,700
if it was this mere injury,
maybe an eye it is pretty funny,

1712
01:22:14,950 --> 01:22:18,900
was a week later after the scabs have 
fallen off a.

1713
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,580
it's pretty funny.
Well,

1714
01:22:20,581 --> 01:22:21,414
the thing is also the you don't have a 
restricted sort of form in which you 

1715
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:31,050
have to perform in by doing it spoken 
word style.

1716
01:22:31,230 --> 01:22:32,880
You essentially can do whatever you 
want.

1717
01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:34,320
Yes,
and I need that freedom.

1718
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:36,660
He's like,
I can't be dependent on pond to make you

1719
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:37,800
laugh all the time.
Right?

1720
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:38,634
Yeah.
Like there's the thing about standup is 

1721
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,423
part of it I really liked because it 
forces you to use an economy of words 

1722
01:22:44,431 --> 01:22:45,264
and boil your ideas down into this very 
clear rhythm where you really keep 

1723
01:22:48,511 --> 01:22:51,990
hammering them with laughs,
but part of it is a win.

1724
01:22:52,170 --> 01:22:53,003
Where I get my freedom is from this,
like from doing podcasts like so I can 

1725
01:22:56,101 --> 01:23:00,990
express myself in ways and get thoughts 
across where it doesn't have to have any

1726
01:23:00,991 --> 01:23:03,090
form.
It can be funny or it can be.

1727
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:04,373
It can be depressing or funny and sad or
it doesn't have to realize itself in 11 

1728
01:23:08,561 --> 01:23:09,700
seconds.
Right.

1729
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:10,534
And it doesn't have to have an impact 
like this is the thing about standup is 

1730
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:14,854
that you're always getting a reaction 
and if you don't get that reaction is 

1731
01:23:17,771 --> 01:23:20,230
not successful,
you can call it whatever you want you to

1732
01:23:20,231 --> 01:23:21,190
say,
oh this is stand up,

1733
01:23:21,191 --> 01:23:22,024
but you know,
I'm talking about stand up or I'm 

1734
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:26,110
talking about things that are tragic in 
my standup.

1735
01:23:26,111 --> 01:23:27,810
So it's deeper and more meaningful.
It's like,

1736
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:30,390
okay,
but then it's not really stand up.

1737
01:23:31,020 --> 01:23:32,580
Stand up is funny.
Yeah.

1738
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,140
And once it stops being funny,
then you're doing something else,

1739
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:38,050
you know,
you're doing spoken word or you're doing

1740
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:41,170
a play or a one person show or whatever 
it is.

1741
01:23:41,190 --> 01:23:42,023
Right.
And I would never dare go into a comedy 

1742
01:23:43,271 --> 01:23:45,670
club and do what I do.
You never do that.

1743
01:23:45,671 --> 01:23:48,070
You never go to the Improv or something 
like that.

1744
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:48,933
Two Times in my life.
One time the venue I was supposed to be 

1745
01:23:52,121 --> 01:23:54,790
and got knocked out because of a storm.
And so they said,

1746
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:55,624
we've moved your show too,
like the laugh dungeon that was in 

1747
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:03,070
someplace in the east coast with like 
80,000 head shots on the wall,

1748
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:07,060
that little part case stage,
the PV boxes,

1749
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:12,090
the PA screwed into the wall.
And I did my talking show my audience.

1750
01:24:12,941 --> 01:24:14,410
They're all sitting at these tables 
going,

1751
01:24:14,860 --> 01:24:19,390
why are we here?
And on the last big tour in 2016,

1752
01:24:19,391 --> 01:24:20,950
I don't like nights off.
They said,

1753
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:22,360
okay,
thanksgiving.

1754
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,470
I said,
find me a show.

1755
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:24,730
They said,
we found your show.

1756
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:28,150
It's a comedy club next to a strip bar.

1757
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:29,763
And there's no backstage,
there's no monitors is two boxes in the 

1758
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:33,874
wall.
Family owned really nice people and I 

1759
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:38,920
forget where it was somewhere in 
Illinois.

1760
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,233
I was a one show one night my,
my tour bus was rumbling away in the 

1761
01:24:45,371 --> 01:24:49,420
parking lot the next night I think it 
was like three nights of Ralphie May,

1762
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:54,700
the great comedian,
but it was a straight up comedy club and

1763
01:24:54,701 --> 01:24:55,534
I went in there and I just Kinda did 
what I've been doing for the last nine 

1764
01:24:58,361 --> 01:24:59,194
months on the road.
And a lot of it was very funny and the 

1765
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:04,410
audience was fantastic and so the owner,
I came up to her and said,

1766
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:06,610
like,
I played this place again anytime.

1767
01:25:06,611 --> 01:25:08,170
Thank you so much.
And he said,

1768
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:09,870
well,
you know where we are anytime.

1769
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:10,713
We loved it,
we like you and you're always welcome 

1770
01:25:12,281 --> 01:25:13,114
here.
And that I don't know if it was my 

1771
01:25:14,321 --> 01:25:15,820
audience for a comedy audience.

1772
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,370
I said,
how did the show too is,

1773
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:18,550
oh,
it's sold out in a day.

1774
01:25:18,551 --> 01:25:19,121
I mean,
you know,

1775
01:25:19,121 --> 01:25:21,150
your,
your name and um,

1776
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,460
I think,
but this is.

1777
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:23,990
But I said,
so the audience is,

1778
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:25,270
Oh,
I recognize these people.

1779
01:25:25,271 --> 01:25:28,790
This is my local comedy crowd.
There's just,

1780
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:31,150
they just know you from sons of anarchy 
or whatever.

1781
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,313
So we'll see how you go.
And it was fine and it turned into like 

1782
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:39,580
this to our laugh riot.
I mean it was just great.

1783
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:40,583
It was a super function.
You don't have an opening act or 

1784
01:25:41,771 --> 01:25:42,660
anything,
you just go right out.

1785
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,900
Because I torture him enough.
It's just me.

1786
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:47,433
Can I ask you a professional question?
Feel free to edit this out when you're 

1787
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:52,920
on stage.
And like you're doing a big theater like

1788
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:55,780
where you're the main guy at like a big 
Saturday night somewhere.

1789
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:57,520
How long are you on stage for?

1790
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:01,470
Usually an hour and 10 to an hour and 20
minutes.

1791
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,620
Seventy to 80 minutes?
Yeah.

1792
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:04,483
Okay.
I just fascinated because I live in a 

1793
01:26:06,171 --> 01:26:07,490
bubble.
I just do my own thing.

1794
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:10,220
I'm onstage for like two hours and 40 
minutes.

1795
01:26:10,460 --> 01:26:12,710
I bring an opening act.
And how,

1796
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:16,070
what do they do between 20 and 30 and 
how many openers?

1797
01:26:16,071 --> 01:26:16,904
One.
Sometimes they bring to that's rare but 

1798
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:19,364
it's usually just for fun.
So to have two people the most and 

1799
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:25,610
they'll do a total of 40 minutes and 
then there's a brief intermission,

1800
01:26:26,580 --> 01:26:29,180
three Bang Bang,
Bang.

1801
01:26:29,181 --> 01:26:32,210
We go and the show could be 80 minutes.
Ninety minutes.

1802
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:34,670
And so the whole thing you would to two 
hours.

1803
01:26:34,671 --> 01:26:37,400
It's like two point something hours.
It could be two hours.

1804
01:26:37,401 --> 01:26:38,234
Yeah.
Easily.

1805
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:39,650
Yeah.
But that's the whole night,

1806
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:40,783
the whole night.
And Are you ever on your own with 

1807
01:26:42,591 --> 01:26:43,730
nobody?
Never.

1808
01:26:43,940 --> 01:26:45,200
Okay.
So there's always an opener.

1809
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,660
Usually one.
Yes.

1810
01:26:46,730 --> 01:26:51,730
And so that's 20 minutes and 70 to 80.
So the whole night is a little less than

1811
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:54,614
two hours depending upon the show,
whether or not we have two shows in a 

1812
01:26:56,991 --> 01:26:59,300
night.
A short show is an hour and a half,

1813
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:02,180
which I like a rock 'em sock,
'em robots.

1814
01:27:02,181 --> 01:27:03,620
Hour and a half.
Like a movie.

1815
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:05,780
You go to a movie and it's two and a 
half hours.

1816
01:27:05,781 --> 01:27:06,860
Even if it's really good,
it's like,

1817
01:27:07,180 --> 01:27:07,640
oh no,
no.

1818
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:11,870
You fill out a city last 20 minutes.
You really feel that lack of editing,

1819
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:14,120
but an hour and a half as bang,
Bang,

1820
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:14,691
Bang,
Bang,

1821
01:27:14,691 --> 01:27:15,524
Bang.
Good.

1822
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:19,090
Yeah.
And so how many two night,

1823
01:27:19,190 --> 01:27:21,740
two sets of night do you do often?
Yeah,

1824
01:27:21,741 --> 01:27:24,050
I'll do seven to nine or something like 
that.

1825
01:27:24,051 --> 01:27:26,870
I'll do it pretty often depending on the
size of the venue.

1826
01:27:26,930 --> 01:27:27,763
You know,
some places a giant place I'll do one 

1827
01:27:29,541 --> 01:27:30,920
show or you know.

1828
01:27:30,920 --> 01:27:32,700
But I've done.
I've done a lot of,

1829
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:33,823
especially this last year,
I did a lot of two shows that night in 

1830
01:27:35,811 --> 01:27:37,370
big theaters and stuff.
You know,

1831
01:27:37,770 --> 01:27:38,603
it's a lot of turnaround too because you
got to clear out all those people 

1832
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:42,530
shouldn't get a new crowd in there.
I just,

1833
01:27:42,531 --> 01:27:42,850
you know,
I,

1834
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:46,130
I work alone because I don't have a peer
group really.

1835
01:27:46,190 --> 01:27:48,600
If I do,
I'm not trying to find them and I,

1836
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:52,820
I'm just curious about how other people 
do their thing because I live alone in a

1837
01:27:52,821 --> 01:27:56,160
tour bus with you,
road manager and a bus driver and emerge

1838
01:27:56,290 --> 01:27:57,123
guy.
And I have no opener excepted in 

1839
01:27:58,791 --> 01:28:00,860
Australia.
There's a rule they want one for one.

1840
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,140
And so there's this open reviews for 
years.

1841
01:28:03,310 --> 01:28:04,870
Australian Open,
we want,

1842
01:28:04,890 --> 01:28:06,950
you want American one Australia,
which I really like.

1843
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,410
They used to do that with music,
you know,

1844
01:28:09,411 --> 01:28:12,500
they don't do that with me when I'm 
there I bring American openers.

1845
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,280
Oh well they with me the last few years,
like I've gotten to bigger places and my

1846
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,790
agent and said,
okay,

1847
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,470
you're going to have an opener.
And I've met.

1848
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,170
I've used this guy,
used him.

1849
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:25,004
He's,
he's done shows with me for like three 

1850
01:28:26,421 --> 01:28:28,430
tours.
He's hilarious.

1851
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,320
Really low keys.
A really nice guy.

1852
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:33,380
I'm forgetting.
I see the guy every three years,

1853
01:28:33,381 --> 01:28:35,600
so it's not in the memory,
but he's great and he's,

1854
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:36,523
he's super funny.
He's real smart and the audience loves 

1855
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:39,194
him.
I mean I think he's kind of known but 

1856
01:28:40,431 --> 01:28:42,050
he's great and he's just like,
I don't know,

1857
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:43,490
20 minutes,
whatever it is.

1858
01:28:43,491 --> 01:28:46,370
And then I go do my thing,
but that's per.

1859
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:50,300
It's not in every city in Australia it's
like in a couple of places.

1860
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,220
Oh.
So there's some kind of thing.

1861
01:28:52,250 --> 01:28:53,420
Regional rules.
Yeah.

1862
01:28:53,421 --> 01:28:57,740
And that's happened a few times with 
what I would do music like,

1863
01:28:57,741 --> 01:29:00,260
okay,
four guys on stage we're going to have a

1864
01:29:00,261 --> 01:29:01,740
foreperson opener.
Like,

1865
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:02,100
okay

1866
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,933
man and I kinda like that,
like give the local band some time or 

1867
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:07,164
give the local guy a moment in front of 
his hometown audience or let him tour 

1868
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:12,210
with me.
I love that idea,

1869
01:29:12,570 --> 01:29:15,090
but that's the only time it or every 
once in a while.

1870
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:18,930
I was at Bonnaroo once and it was 
tremendously lopsided.

1871
01:29:18,931 --> 01:29:23,931
It was me and Tig Notaro who's amazing.
I don't know her very well,

1872
01:29:24,241 --> 01:29:27,750
but I've seen her on stage and she was 
Kinda,

1873
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:28,793
she didn't exactly open for me,
but she did like half an hour and I did 

1874
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:33,540
like an hour.
It was like,

1875
01:29:33,541 --> 01:29:36,060
and they cleared the tent and then uh,
uh,

1876
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:40,470
cheech Marin came on,
but a Lewis black was before it was like

1877
01:29:40,471 --> 01:29:41,304
three tent loads of people in one night 
at Montereau and that's the only time 

1878
01:29:44,371 --> 01:29:45,204
I've ever done a is everyone's.
So I'll be the festival where you're 

1879
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:52,500
like the eight to 9:30 guy and then the 
10:00 guy comes onstage.

1880
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,300
But quite often I'm just on my own on 
tour and I'm the only thing onstage.

1881
01:29:57,320 --> 01:30:00,300
It's a different thing for me.
I have to have my friends with me.

1882
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:02,430
Otherwise I get bored.
Like I want,

1883
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,990
I go on the road like

1884
01:30:04,460 --> 01:30:05,293
we want to take on the road with me as a
national headliner that would normally 

1885
01:30:07,731 --> 01:30:10,160
be headlining somewhere on their own.
Like cool.

1886
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:10,940
Double.
Yeah.

1887
01:30:10,940 --> 01:30:11,880
Yeah.
It's a cool double bill,

1888
01:30:11,881 --> 01:30:16,881
but it's also I want the best guys that 
I can find that I pay them well to go on

1889
01:30:17,031 --> 01:30:17,980
in front of me.
I don't,

1890
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:21,530
I don't want it to be a bad show by any 
stretch of the imagination,

1891
01:30:21,531 --> 01:30:23,540
so I try to get the best guys,
but also by that,

1892
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:26,390
then I'm traveling with the best guys,
so we're having fun.

1893
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:27,740
Like we're,
you know,

1894
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:28,753
it's,
it's a,

1895
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:32,390
it's a weird group like standups.
There's not that many of us.

1896
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:33,503
It was like maybe a thousand of us in 
the whole country that are like real 

1897
01:30:36,261 --> 01:30:37,094
professional comedians,
maybe 500 headliners and the whole 

1898
01:30:39,321 --> 01:30:40,810
country.
So this,

1899
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:41,783
there's just not that many of us.
And so when we relate to each other and 

1900
01:30:45,131 --> 01:30:46,520
sort of a weird way.

1901
01:30:46,640 --> 01:30:47,840
Yeah,
well there's not many of you.

1902
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:50,690
When presidents get together,
it was like four of them.

1903
01:30:50,691 --> 01:30:51,524
They all,
they're kind of chummy because they 

1904
01:30:52,881 --> 01:30:53,714
might be opposed,
but they all kind of know they're the 

1905
01:30:56,181 --> 01:30:58,310
only people who know that stuff.
Especially when they're out,

1906
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,793
when they're out there,
he did their time and then they can 

1907
01:31:00,771 --> 01:31:04,400
relax and they just look like they've 
been sucked dry by a vampire.

1908
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:05,503
That's why I noticed when the.
When Obama welcomed the president elect 

1909
01:31:08,810 --> 01:31:09,643
trump to the Oval Office for that 90 
minute meeting that trump thought was 

1910
01:31:12,861 --> 01:31:16,430
going to last 15 minutes.
Obama looked like two-toned come moon.

1911
01:31:16,431 --> 01:31:19,370
He just like his skin was so drawn 
across his face.

1912
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:20,313
It's like a snare drum.
It must have been so exhausted and his 

1913
01:31:22,780 --> 01:31:23,613
legacy is going to be taken over.
Just any president like George W dot 

1914
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:31,940
Bush was to meet a handsome energetic 
guy when he got into office,

1915
01:31:32,660 --> 01:31:33,493
but eight years in nine slash 11 and the
invasion and occupation of Iraq on the 

1916
01:31:38,061 --> 01:31:40,150
way out,
his face had fallen.

1917
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:42,980
His hair had died.
And I,

1918
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:45,890
I'm not a guy who hates him,
just disagrees,

1919
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:49,400
but the presidency killed that guy.
I mean,

1920
01:31:49,401 --> 01:31:50,234
I just think the stress,
because you don't get the nice phone 

1921
01:31:51,711 --> 01:31:52,520
call.
Hey the cat,

1922
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,320
we got the cat out of the tree.
It's like,

1923
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:55,910
hey,
we lost eight guys.

1924
01:31:56,660 --> 01:32:00,100
That thing you said go.
It went well.

1925
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:00,933
I'm very curious to see how trump comes 
out of this because he's one of the 

1926
01:32:03,401 --> 01:32:06,220
older guys to get in there.
I think he's 70 or 71.

1927
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:08,620
Right.
And in just in the past year,

1928
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:11,610
like there's a picture of Bush for 2000 
and 2000 and what I'm saying,

1929
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:13,290
that's crazy.
It just,

1930
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:18,600
it kicked his ass and I'm not trying to 
put them in the majority of reality.

1931
01:32:18,820 --> 01:32:19,653
It's like when you see those really 
amazing photos of Lincoln during the 

1932
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:27,871
civil war or Lyndon Johnson in those 
think tank meetings,

1933
01:32:28,811 --> 01:32:29,644
him and Mcnamara,
his face is sliding off his skull 

1934
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,690
because he's getting those phone calls.
Hey,

1935
01:32:34,691 --> 01:32:35,524
we just lost six slash 600 guys.
Mr President really started to give you 

1936
01:32:38,621 --> 01:32:39,454
this news because he insisted on getting
the bad phone call and you see what it 

1937
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:43,323
does to a human being.
And I noticed it with Bush and Obama 

1938
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,233
because those were trying times for both
presidents who was trying very trying 

1939
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:52,834
administrations and I wonder what it's 
gonna do to a guy who doesn't take care 

1940
01:32:56,951 --> 01:33:00,370
of himself,
who is carrying a lot of weight.

1941
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:05,970
Probably nowhere near the best diet and 
I don't,

1942
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:10,000
I hope he doesn't have some kind of 
heart attack.

1943
01:33:10,060 --> 01:33:11,860
I mean,
I'm not the kind of guy who wants people

1944
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:13,810
to die easily could,
but um,

1945
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:14,710
man,
you look at them,

1946
01:33:14,711 --> 01:33:15,251
you're like,
man,

1947
01:33:15,251 --> 01:33:17,480
you need to listen to the White House 
doctor.

1948
01:33:17,481 --> 01:33:19,840
Get on a plan because they can really 
rock you.

1949
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,763
They can help you lose 40 pounds by 
spring of next year and you can really 

1950
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:26,770
be,
feel better.

1951
01:33:26,771 --> 01:33:27,521
You look at him,
you're like,

1952
01:33:27,521 --> 01:33:28,354
man,
there's someone in the White House who 

1953
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:30,904
can help you with that.
Like they're paid to get you on the 

1954
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:34,024
track every morning.
They could get them up at five in the 

1955
01:33:35,681 --> 01:33:37,510
morning and get them out there and it's 
not going to do it.

1956
01:33:37,511 --> 01:33:38,344
He's got to watch Fox News.
Something that I agree or disagree with 

1957
01:33:40,241 --> 01:33:41,074
those people on the TV's too bad because
the president has all those people who 

1958
01:33:44,081 --> 01:33:45,100
are ready.

1959
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:45,933
They're already in.
They're jogging outfits like a dog who 

1960
01:33:47,531 --> 01:33:49,530
wants to go to the park,
waiting to train them.

1961
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,910
And it's um,
and a dietician.

1962
01:33:51,911 --> 01:33:55,390
They can rock those calories.
I think he wants it.

1963
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,450
I don't think he gives a shit.
Well,

1964
01:33:56,460 --> 01:33:58,930
you have to apparently drinks like 12 
diet cokes a day.

1965
01:33:59,650 --> 01:34:00,850
That's one of the things they were 
saying.

1966
01:34:01,500 --> 01:34:05,020
Would that wind that diet window you 
were talking about?

1967
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,420
Um,
when you do eat,

1968
01:34:08,020 --> 01:34:09,820
are you eating,
you have a family.

1969
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:13,600
Is it the dinner table eating at home 
with families.

1970
01:34:13,610 --> 01:34:14,650
That's,
that's the meal.

1971
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:19,780
Is your family,
is that meal targeted like nutrition for

1972
01:34:19,781 --> 01:34:21,620
the kids' nutrition for Dad,
I'm here.

1973
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:25,030
You guys eat smart.
The kids actually eat very healthy.

1974
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,193
Yeah.
We've been eating together really 

1975
01:34:28,331 --> 01:34:30,430
healthy since they were babies.
That's all.

1976
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:35,230
I mean they're always eating vegetables 
and some healthy meat and they eat a lot

1977
01:34:35,231 --> 01:34:37,390
of wild game because I hunt,
you know,

1978
01:34:37,391 --> 01:34:38,920
so they,
they really healthy.

1979
01:34:39,010 --> 01:34:41,710
They have.
It's an interesting thing with kids too,

1980
01:34:41,711 --> 01:34:42,544
if you,
if you shield them from interesting 

1981
01:34:44,201 --> 01:34:46,180
foods,
like my eight year old loves Kimchi,

1982
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:50,710
she loves like Spicy Korean fermented 
cabbage,

1983
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:52,480
which to a lot of kids would be 
disgusting.

1984
01:34:52,481 --> 01:34:55,120
She loves it.
She eats like fucking plates of it.

1985
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:57,980
And because of that she rarely sick.
You know,

1986
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:00,380
she,
she eats a lot of probiotics and healthy

1987
01:35:00,381 --> 01:35:01,214
foods,
but they're always eating fruit and 

1988
01:35:02,601 --> 01:35:03,434
vegetables.
They've been doing it so they're a 

1989
01:35:03,951 --> 01:35:06,200
little kid.
We don't stop them from eating candy,

1990
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,213
but I do tell them what candy is and I 
showed them that sugar documentary and 

1991
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:12,464
I've talked to them in length about how 
sugar didn't use to be something that 

1992
01:35:15,351 --> 01:35:17,750
people ate all the time and it's a 
really recent thing.

1993
01:35:17,810 --> 01:35:18,643
I've showed them photographs of people 
from like the 18 hundreds and the early 

1994
01:35:21,441 --> 01:35:22,490
19 hundreds.
Like,

1995
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:24,020
look what these people looked like.
They were thin,

1996
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:25,910
they were different,
they had a different diet,

1997
01:35:26,060 --> 01:35:26,893
but now we just eat too many 
carbohydrates and it's fine every now 

1998
01:35:29,541 --> 01:35:31,370
and then like don't keep it from 
yourself,

1999
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:35,150
but understand that these are empty 
calories and they make your body.

2000
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:37,910
They actually make you tired.
One thing I've noticed,

2001
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:38,923
I look at people when I travel,
I just find that our species is 

2002
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:42,590
fascinating all over the world.

2003
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:43,903
You look at people's teeth in parts of 
the world were sugar and corn syrup is 

2004
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:49,154
just not normal and you see like these 
75 year old women like carrying a couch 

2005
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:54,793
up a hill and their teeth are these 
bright white tree trunks just like of 

2006
01:35:59,370 --> 01:36:04,370
like they're never a good a fall out of 
their heads and like no dentistry,

2007
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:08,690
you know that no noticeable dentistry 
and the teeth are gleaming.

2008
01:36:08,691 --> 01:36:13,691
White maybe darken from tobacco or tea,
but nothing like in the West where their

2009
01:36:15,110 --> 01:36:18,740
teeth are just getting assaulted by our 
own diet.

2010
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:22,850
And you see people have great age with 
like they look,

2011
01:36:22,970 --> 01:36:25,880
they're just ripped and you look at what
they're eating.

2012
01:36:26,050 --> 01:36:26,930
Fish,
rice,

2013
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:27,793
vegetables and it's all lean smart food.
And did the sugars are all a 

2014
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:35,750
monosaccharides,
like fruit sugar,

2015
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:37,123
you know,
the occasional banana or orange is a 

2016
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:40,380
treat,
but you know,

2017
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,920
the sugars really not in the Diet at 
all.

2018
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,480
Maybe shouldn't be,
you know,

2019
01:36:45,710 --> 01:36:46,543
but not like we're doing it now.
No one's ever done it by the way we're 

2020
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:51,650
doing it.
No one's ever been as fat,

2021
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:52,863
you know?
And then we have these things to shield 

2022
01:36:54,111 --> 01:36:56,000
people from,
we call it fat shaming,

2023
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,680
you know,
don't tell someone their fat,

2024
01:36:57,681 --> 01:36:58,514
let them just be morbidly obese and go 
through life at a massive risk of heart 

2025
01:37:02,661 --> 01:37:03,494
attack or stroke or diabetes.
Don't say anything because then you'll 

2026
01:37:06,471 --> 01:37:07,860
hurt their feelings.
Meanwhile,

2027
01:37:08,170 --> 01:37:09,003
you could say something to someone and 
it might be uncomfortable in the moment 

2028
01:37:11,541 --> 01:37:12,374
of,
Hey Mike,

2029
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:15,290
Listen,
I don't want to be that guy,

2030
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:16,183
but you got to lose some weight.
And then that guy could go and look in 

2031
01:37:18,441 --> 01:37:19,490
the mirror and go,
fuck,

2032
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:20,563
I really do need to lose some weight.
And then they'll lose some weight and 

2033
01:37:23,181 --> 01:37:24,014
they'll be healthier.
They'll talk to you four or five months 

2034
01:37:25,041 --> 01:37:25,851
later and go,
you know,

2035
01:37:25,851 --> 01:37:27,080
you fucked my head up that day.

2036
01:37:27,290 --> 01:37:28,123
And because of that,
I really started changing the way I eat 

2037
01:37:29,481 --> 01:37:32,300
and I'm so much healthier.
I feel better because he's your friend,

2038
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,610
my friend Tom Seger and and Bert 
Kreischer.

2039
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,440
They did this thing last year,
well,

2040
01:37:36,441 --> 01:37:39,080
two years ago where they did.
They had a weight loss competition.

2041
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:43,370
And one of the things they kept doing is
fat shaming each other,

2042
01:37:43,371 --> 01:37:46,460
like ruthlessly and they would use 
Hashtag bird is fat,

2043
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:47,323
Hashtag Thomas Fat.
And they had this weight loss 

2044
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:54,650
competition and they fucking both lost a
shitload of weight.

2045
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:55,663
I they both lost between 50 and 60 
pounds and they looked fucking 

2046
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:01,500
incredible.
But then after it was over,

2047
01:38:01,501 --> 01:38:02,281
Tom was like,
dude,

2048
01:38:02,281 --> 01:38:04,620
let me tell you something.
Fat Shaming works.

2049
01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:06,450
It works.
It got me off my ass.

2050
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:09,780
I realized I was a fat fuck.
And it made me lose weight.

2051
01:38:09,781 --> 01:38:12,770
It doesn't feel good.
That shaming thing is you.

2052
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,330
Fat Shaming doesn't work on people 
weren't fat,

2053
01:38:15,390 --> 01:38:16,223
okay,
it works on people who have a problem 

2054
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:20,340
but don't want to address that problem.

2055
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:22,440
So you bring up that problem and then 
they go,

2056
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:23,274
oh,
you're making me feel bad by thinking 

2057
01:38:24,511 --> 01:38:26,910
about my problem.
You're a bad person.

2058
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,860
No,
you have a weak spot.

2059
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,770
That weak spot shouldn't be there.
A good shouldn't.

2060
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:34,860
You shouldn't Belabor it and constantly 
ridicule someone for being fat.

2061
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,830
But the idea that you're never supposed 
to bring it up,

2062
01:38:37,831 --> 01:38:38,664
even with someone you care about,
even ingest or friends busting balls 

2063
01:38:41,521 --> 01:38:42,061
like,
no,

2064
01:38:42,061 --> 01:38:42,301
no,
no,

2065
01:38:42,301 --> 01:38:45,990
you should bring it up because that,
that bad feeling is a gift.

2066
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,970
It makes you realize like,
Oh my God,

2067
01:38:47,971 --> 01:38:48,804
I've been remiss.
I haven't been paying attention to my 

2068
01:38:50,161 --> 01:38:52,650
own physical sovereignty.
You know,

2069
01:38:52,651 --> 01:38:54,780
I have control over what goes in my 
body.

2070
01:38:54,781 --> 01:38:56,200
I have control over the,
the,

2071
01:38:56,220 --> 01:39:00,180
the amount of calories I take in the 
kind of calories I have control over how

2072
01:39:00,181 --> 01:39:01,800
much body fat I'm carrying around.

2073
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:04,110
And there's ways to fix it.
Yeah,

2074
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:07,640
I think you should use discretion.
Yes.

2075
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:10,020
And she's in line at the supermarket,
you know,

2076
01:39:10,530 --> 01:39:13,140
some people you'd like and you know,
it's just.

2077
01:39:13,260 --> 01:39:16,080
But it was funny to hear Tom just was 
getting angry.

2078
01:39:16,081 --> 01:39:17,940
He's like,
fucking fat shaming works,

2079
01:39:17,941 --> 01:39:18,774
man.
All these people that say don't fat 

2080
01:39:19,621 --> 01:39:20,191
shame.
Fuck.

2081
01:39:20,191 --> 01:39:24,030
That's how I got skinny fat shaming 
works until.

2082
01:39:24,220 --> 01:39:25,053
But again,
don't be rude to someone out in public 

2083
01:39:27,391 --> 01:39:29,460
for no reason to drive an 11 year old to
suicide.

2084
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:31,130
Definitely don't do this.
But.

2085
01:39:31,140 --> 01:39:31,973
So yeah,
the little kids is the worst because 

2086
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:34,793
their parents will get them hooked on 
those sugary sodas and once it's the 

2087
01:39:37,651 --> 01:39:38,910
Goddamn Sodas,
man,

2088
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,210
I mean that is one of the primary causes
for people being fat in this country.

2089
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:44,710
And it just seems so innocuous.
It's just an glass.

2090
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:45,630
I'll just drink this.

2091
01:39:45,810 --> 01:39:48,540
It's got some ice cubes.
No big deal goes down so fast,

2092
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,310
tastes great.
And the weekends,

2093
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:51,920
um,
I,

2094
01:39:52,210 --> 01:39:54,450
I like ginger beer and the,
the,

2095
01:39:54,510 --> 01:39:57,690
the Bundler Burke's.
It's the same power as a coke.

2096
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:02,750
I mean it's a lot of sugar and I buy a 
four pack and I have one bottle a week,

2097
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,000
Saturday night,
my big drink,

2098
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:09,090
like discipline,
he's going nuts.

2099
01:40:09,091 --> 01:40:10,440
Look at him.
He's got his drink,

2100
01:40:12,190 --> 01:40:14,550
the best tasting stuff.
But man,

2101
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:18,930
it tastes good for a reason.
It's so sweet and like you just want the

2102
01:40:18,931 --> 01:40:21,300
next one when you're done.
But man,

2103
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:21,960
I,
I,

2104
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,590
and I could drink all day but I just 
can't do that to my system.

2105
01:40:25,591 --> 01:40:28,020
So I do one a week.
That's good discipline.

2106
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:29,431
But it's like,
you know,

2107
01:40:29,431 --> 01:40:30,264
you still need to look forward to.
Do you have a diet that you follow them 

2108
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,140
that.
Yeah,

2109
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:38,820
I mean I love ice cream so I don't eat 
it.

2110
01:40:39,340 --> 01:40:40,740
Um,
you know,

2111
01:40:40,741 --> 01:40:41,574
I,
I try not to because it's just my body 

2112
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:45,690
is slowed down with age.
I just can't shed pounds,

2113
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:47,670
but I've never really had a weight 
problem.

2114
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:48,601
I,
I've never like,

2115
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:50,760
oh,
I got to like lose 30 pounds.

2116
01:40:50,761 --> 01:40:52,970
I just don't.
My metabolism is such.

2117
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:54,640
Always kind of like a greyhound.

2118
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:57,640
Like it was kind of nervous and we,
you're always working out as well.

2119
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:02,800
I'm always kind of like doing something 
and just kind of uptight.

2120
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:03,813
Kind of nervy.
Will you talked the last time you were 

2121
01:41:04,901 --> 01:41:08,350
about the fact that your parents had you
on Ritalin from the time you were really

2122
01:41:08,351 --> 01:41:09,184
small boy.
Who Do you think that just like wired 

2123
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:14,050
you in a certain way?
I don't know,

2124
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,210
but I,
I would need a doctor to tell me,

2125
01:41:16,211 --> 01:41:18,580
but it was a,
it's not a subtle drug,

2126
01:41:18,750 --> 01:41:19,583
especially when you're a little kid,
but I try and eat as clean as I can 

2127
01:41:23,110 --> 01:41:26,440
because more energy,
more,

2128
01:41:26,530 --> 01:41:30,580
less need for sleep and not feeling so 
bad all the time.

2129
01:41:30,581 --> 01:41:31,930
Mentally,
like not feeling.

2130
01:41:31,931 --> 01:41:34,840
I don't want to do anything with a good 
diet.

2131
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:39,670
I mean I feel better mentally and like I
said before,

2132
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:42,520
I've been struggling with trying to feel
okay,

2133
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:43,050
not,
don't know.

2134
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:45,160
You need to feel good.
I just want to be neutral.

2135
01:41:45,530 --> 01:41:47,460
Not just like,
not in deficit.

2136
01:41:47,470 --> 01:41:48,550
Okay.
To be here,

2137
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:52,300
that's all I want.
I'm not asking for much and good.

2138
01:41:52,360 --> 01:41:54,520
I found a good diet.
Really,

2139
01:41:54,940 --> 01:41:58,390
really rocks that were,
I feel when I do the bad meal,

2140
01:41:58,960 --> 01:41:59,793
like a depression meal,
like tons of carbs for like a day later 

2141
01:42:03,371 --> 01:42:04,540
I'm just like,
Oh man,

2142
01:42:04,541 --> 01:42:09,370
I'm feeling every bite of that and so I 
don't want to feel like that.

2143
01:42:09,371 --> 01:42:10,210
So I'm like,
nope,

2144
01:42:10,211 --> 01:42:12,280
can't do that because it's just not 
worth it.

2145
01:42:12,281 --> 01:42:15,400
So what kind of food you like?
What's a typical meal for you today?

2146
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:16,234
I had a salad with some chopped up 
chicken with a low calorie dressing on 

2147
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:22,864
it and a cup of coffee and tonight I'm 
going to have a glass of carrot juice 

2148
01:42:27,251 --> 01:42:32,050
with a splash of beet juice and probably
a cup half a cup of coffee.

2149
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:33,580
The other half of the cup.
I started this.

2150
01:42:33,610 --> 01:42:35,230
That's your dinner?
Yeah,

2151
01:42:35,231 --> 01:42:36,064
I already.
Basically the salad with the chicken is 

2152
01:42:37,460 --> 01:42:38,800
your whole day.
Yeah,

2153
01:42:38,810 --> 01:42:40,140
I'll eat tomorrow.
Wow.

2154
01:42:40,141 --> 01:42:44,080
I'll be good in Hungary tomorrow if I'm 
feeling like I can't sleep.

2155
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:47,890
I'm distracted from hunger.
I've got some peanuts in my room and all

2156
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:49,630
of a sudden a handful of peanuts.
See?

2157
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:51,870
Very clean,
neat,

2158
01:42:52,150 --> 01:42:54,580
very clean,
very clean.

2159
01:42:54,581 --> 01:42:55,800
Was like some kind of thing.
No,

2160
01:42:55,801 --> 01:42:56,110
no,
no.

2161
01:42:56,110 --> 01:43:00,190
I to clean because I have found I get 
great results with it.

2162
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:02,920
Like it is no joke.
It totally works.

2163
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:06,790
And I,
as we do in our line of work,

2164
01:43:06,791 --> 01:43:09,620
I got a lot of stuff coming up.
A lot of suffering,

2165
01:43:09,700 --> 01:43:12,070
you know,
I got a TV show,

2166
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:14,320
a lot of shows,
a lot of,

2167
01:43:14,340 --> 01:43:16,180
uh,
a couple of speeches.

2168
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:21,210
I got a teaching a class at Ucla one day
coming up November,

2169
01:43:21,731 --> 01:43:22,564
but when you're teaching a,
they just want me to talk about music 

2170
01:43:25,061 --> 01:43:30,061
and culture and I just got asked to talk
about change at another place and I have

2171
01:43:31,091 --> 01:43:33,490
a bunch of shows coming up from here to 
Kiev,

2172
01:43:33,491 --> 01:43:36,220
Ukraine and just a lot of marks I got to
hit.

2173
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:37,353
It's just what I do and so I'm basically
getting ready to walk out of the house 

2174
01:43:43,151 --> 01:43:48,151
until about Christmas and the hitting 
marks and not screwing up day after day,

2175
01:43:48,971 --> 01:43:53,971
night after night.
And so diet is a lot goes into that prep

2176
01:43:54,530 --> 01:43:55,740
big time.
Well,

2177
01:43:55,770 --> 01:43:56,603
I mean it makes sense if you,
if you're demanding that much out of 

2178
01:43:59,361 --> 01:44:00,590
your body,
you really don't want.

2179
01:44:00,591 --> 01:44:02,810
Your body's struggling with shitty 
nutrition.

2180
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:05,080
I can't afford it.
Like I,

2181
01:44:05,170 --> 01:44:05,750
I,
I,

2182
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,200
my car can't go off the road.
I can't fail.

2183
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:12,800
I'm going to be screwing up.
Like if I hit that set,

2184
01:44:13,200 --> 01:44:16,850
I'm going to be on a TV show soon.
I can't not know the lines.

2185
01:44:16,851 --> 01:44:19,760
I can't be tired.
I can't look like I haven't slept.

2186
01:44:19,761 --> 01:44:20,594
I got to be a game.
Do you take any vitamins or supplements 

2187
01:44:23,031 --> 01:44:23,864
or anything like that?
I try and I forget and that they go 

2188
01:44:25,971 --> 01:44:26,730
stale.

2189
01:44:26,730 --> 01:44:31,430
I have the five lined up.
My friend Heidi said,

2190
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:31,970
okay,
here,

2191
01:44:31,970 --> 01:44:34,070
here,
and I got into it and I,

2192
01:44:34,071 --> 01:44:34,904
you know,
eventually they get put in the cupboard 

2193
01:44:36,201 --> 01:44:38,240
and then you look at like,
oh,

2194
01:44:38,241 --> 01:44:39,074
three years ago.
And so that's why I do like the carrot 

2195
01:44:42,471 --> 01:44:43,304
and beet juice just so that those kinds 
of vitamins are coming through and I do 

2196
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:49,250
that like almost every day.
I just liked the way it tastes too.

2197
01:44:49,780 --> 01:44:52,040
Um,
but no,

2198
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:54,620
I can't,
I've never been able to stick with it.

2199
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:56,660
I just forget.
Yeah.

2200
01:44:57,050 --> 01:45:00,160
Have you ever had anything that you took
that gave you great benefits?

2201
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:01,273
I never noticed.
The only thing I've ever noticed is 

2202
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:09,191
restorative sleep for just general 
concentration and wellbeing.

2203
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:12,500
And the cleaner I eat,
the better I feel.

2204
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,430
Caffeine,
I don't know if I get jumped up on it.

2205
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:17,264
I can't tell.
And so as far as anything I've ever 

2206
01:45:21,261 --> 01:45:23,810
done,
working out is an antidepressant.

2207
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,730
Good Diet is an antidepressant and makes
me a more efficient way when I'm awake.

2208
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:30,950
Other than that,
like I don't,

2209
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,320
I've never taken cod fish oil or 
whatever and said,

2210
01:45:33,321 --> 01:45:34,700
wow,
my joints feel better.

2211
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,863
I've just,
maybe I'm just not aware enough or I'm 

2212
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:39,644
not expecting it to work so I.
I have no thing I can hold up and go 

2213
01:45:42,411 --> 01:45:44,630
this.
This really helped me.

2214
01:45:45,110 --> 01:45:49,100
Besides physical fitness,
getting the work done,

2215
01:45:49,220 --> 01:45:51,940
like you want to alleviate anxiety 
before an audition,

2216
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:56,030
rehearse the wind prepared.
Then there's nothing to be worried about

2217
01:45:56,031 --> 01:45:59,960
because he can't wait to show the guy 
what you got and so preparation,

2218
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:05,560
good diet and and finishing the thing so
you can really clear the deck.

2219
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:09,590
Those are the things.
Because for me,

2220
01:46:09,591 --> 01:46:14,591
my whole life is don't be depressed.
I worked so hard not to feel bad.

2221
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:19,400
A lot of what I do is to not feel really
bad.

2222
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,130
It's interesting that you've chosen to 
do this in a non pharmaceutical way.

2223
01:46:23,310 --> 01:46:25,700
Specifically you've,
you've strategies,

2224
01:46:25,730 --> 01:46:27,050
just afraid of it.
Yeah.

2225
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:27,973
I just don't believe that someone I 
don't know can come up with the drug 

2226
01:46:32,420 --> 01:46:33,253
that's going to work for my unique 
little mind and I've seen people on 

2227
01:46:37,551 --> 01:46:38,840
antidepressants.
I said,

2228
01:46:38,841 --> 01:46:41,690
so how's that working for you?
Like I think I'm losing my mind.

2229
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:47,360
I've been doing this for three months 
and I don't know who I am right now.

2230
01:46:47,390 --> 01:46:48,223
I'm like,
okay,

2231
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:50,040
I have that problem anyway.

2232
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,940
So I don't want any pharmaceuticals to 
enhance that.

2233
01:46:53,941 --> 01:46:57,030
I'm just basically afraid that's a 
legitimate concern.

2234
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:57,923
Yeah.
I think the brain is real fragile and 

2235
01:46:59,941 --> 01:47:02,790
I'm not one of those types.
You say all medication is bad.

2236
01:47:02,791 --> 01:47:03,624
I'm not that.
I just anything having to do with the 

2237
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:06,714
brain,
I'd rather just deal with what I got 

2238
01:47:08,370 --> 01:47:13,370
right and use these more kind of on the 
ground ideas,

2239
01:47:13,561 --> 01:47:14,394
like I'll just sweat a lot and I'm going
to do a lot of pull ups and whatever I 

2240
01:47:17,521 --> 01:47:18,354
do,
oh look like a ton of pushups or like 

2241
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:24,650
get on the stationary bike or whatever.
I do feel better and when I eat the lean

2242
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:26,640
fish salad,
you know,

2243
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:29,040
the salmon and the spinach,
I do feel better.

2244
01:47:29,041 --> 01:47:30,610
I feel great.
Yeah.

2245
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,270
Um,
and that's,

2246
01:47:32,271 --> 01:47:33,750
that's good enough for me.
Yeah.

2247
01:47:33,751 --> 01:47:37,560
You've got successful strategies they 
working for me.

2248
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:38,473
Yeah.
Yeah.

2249
01:47:38,820 --> 01:47:41,280
Now when you're,
you mean you do so many different things

2250
01:47:41,480 --> 01:47:42,313
at this point of your life.
Do you have specific goals that you set 

2251
01:47:46,171 --> 01:47:47,004
out for the year or you were,
you would like to be a year from now or 

2252
01:47:50,281 --> 01:47:51,114
do you just do things that are really 
interesting to you and just pursue them 

2253
01:47:54,031 --> 01:47:54,864
with passion and just let the chips fall
where they may I do that and I don't 

2254
01:47:59,251 --> 01:48:01,590
have a goal like at,
at 65,

2255
01:48:01,591 --> 01:48:04,320
I want to be here.
I have no idea where I'll be.

2256
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:08,040
I'm trying to get ready for 2019.
I have no plans yet.

2257
01:48:08,041 --> 01:48:10,420
I'm just hoping for a lot of work.
Um,

2258
01:48:12,030 --> 01:48:14,070
I don't have those kind of long range 
plans.

2259
01:48:14,670 --> 01:48:19,170
Unfortunately.
I'm a short ranged to know ranged person

2260
01:48:19,560 --> 01:48:20,393
and a lot of my motivation is vengeance.
And I know that revenge and vengeance 

2261
01:48:26,521 --> 01:48:28,710
are synonyms.
However,

2262
01:48:29,370 --> 01:48:31,500
the fact that revenge has [inaudible] in
it,

2263
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:32,640
like,
you do this,

2264
01:48:32,641 --> 01:48:33,474
I do that.

2265
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:37,650
Vengeance is just like the difference 
between aggression and hostility.

2266
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:39,510
Where you agro.
No,

2267
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:42,000
I'm hostile.
What does that mean?

2268
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,040
Wham.
With the ashtray.

2269
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,230
That's hostility,
right?

2270
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,430
You just hit me.
Yes,

2271
01:48:47,431 --> 01:48:48,264
but I'm not aggressive.
I just like watching you bleed and so 

2272
01:48:55,530 --> 01:48:56,730
ridiculous.
Right?

2273
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:58,620
But,
and I'm not saying it makes sense.

2274
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:03,621
I know and so I don't believe in tit for
tat.

2275
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:05,123
I believe in tit tat.
Watch me just jump up and down and just 

2276
01:49:08,311 --> 01:49:10,200
break it all.
You want to prove yourself?

2277
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:12,340
Yes.
This is a primary motivation.

2278
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:17,280
So I wake up every day wanting to get 
back at every teacher,

2279
01:49:18,030 --> 01:49:18,863
every guy at school,
every bad boss who would ever parent 

2280
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:24,463
irked me.
And like everyday I out everything you 

2281
01:49:27,380 --> 01:49:28,770
man.
And that's why I like,

2282
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:29,670
Hey,
it's four in the morning.

2283
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:30,504
You want to work?
Yeah.

2284
01:49:31,260 --> 01:49:36,260
Like I'll work it in a snow storm.
Like you know someone I know,

2285
01:49:36,331 --> 01:49:37,850
like they go on vacation,
like Gavin,

2286
01:49:37,851 --> 01:49:41,490
nice vacation and everyday you're 
getting Tan.

2287
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:44,910
I'm not quitting.
Like it's ridiculous.

2288
01:49:44,940 --> 01:49:46,440
It's,
I'm an 11 year old.

2289
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,130
It's insane.
So

2290
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:53,130
juvenile and it's not cool but it has 
fuel in some way.

2291
01:49:53,551 --> 01:49:56,470
I don't spray paint your house on that.
I'm not flattening your tire.

2292
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:59,230
I'm just working.
And when someone goes,

2293
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:01,750
oh,
I didn't get up early enough and get,

2294
01:50:01,810 --> 01:50:02,643
how'd you get five of those?
Because I got up at three and I stood 

2295
01:50:05,501 --> 01:50:09,660
outside and I ate this rat tail and like
climbed the wall.

2296
01:50:09,670 --> 01:50:12,400
I got it.
And I got two of them.

2297
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:17,080
And um,
because so you could have none.

2298
01:50:17,990 --> 01:50:20,870
Just I'm so mad and I'm not,
you know,

2299
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:21,743
I'm not trying to get somewhere by 
stepping on you to use it as a ladder 

2300
01:50:24,341 --> 01:50:26,680
rung.
You cling to this.

2301
01:50:26,681 --> 01:50:28,870
This is not something you ever plan on 
an abandoned.

2302
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:33,040
It's the corner I come fighting out of.
It's my true north is like,

2303
01:50:33,070 --> 01:50:34,700
oh yeah,
thank you.

2304
01:50:35,450 --> 01:50:36,283
And I,
it really works and it's not like I'm 

2305
01:50:37,841 --> 01:50:38,674
not,
I would never cheat someone out of 

2306
01:50:41,411 --> 01:50:43,540
something or steal from them.

2307
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:44,973
But um,
whoever gets up earlier is going to get 

2308
01:50:46,691 --> 01:50:48,490
it.
Then I just won't sleep tonight.

2309
01:50:49,390 --> 01:50:50,930
My anger will keep me awake.
What,

2310
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:53,380
what are you having for dinner?
This.

2311
01:50:55,010 --> 01:50:57,100
And that's all I need.
Like you say,

2312
01:50:57,101 --> 01:51:01,470
I can't,
then I'll just sit up all night to which

2313
01:51:02,070 --> 01:51:03,040
I,
that's all I need.

2314
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:05,920
Who are these people like when you say 
you say I can,

2315
01:51:05,921 --> 01:51:08,660
does anybody really say you can at this 
point in time where you have to mentally

2316
01:51:08,690 --> 01:51:09,600
in my head.
Oh,

2317
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:10,930
I totally manufacturer.
Are you kidding?

2318
01:51:12,090 --> 01:51:12,920
Oh yeah.
Absolutely.

2319
01:51:12,920 --> 01:51:15,010
Have these people in your head and as 
Henry you're a loser.

2320
01:51:15,220 --> 01:51:16,060
I'm a loser.
Oh,

2321
01:51:16,061 --> 01:51:17,600
what the fuck are you?
Yeah.

2322
01:51:17,830 --> 01:51:19,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

2323
01:51:19,470 --> 01:51:20,810
And,
and this,

2324
01:51:20,860 --> 01:51:23,130
this doesn't mean I'm walking over to 
hit somebody.

2325
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:28,720
I'm not looking to get beat up.
I'm just motivating yourself.

2326
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,060
Yeah.
And I don't have a T.

2327
01:51:31,120 --> 01:51:31,953
I don't have a bunch of.
I don't have an entourage of just all I 

2328
01:51:34,121 --> 01:51:35,860
got is me.
So I get the pump pumps out,

2329
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:36,820
go,
go,

2330
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:37,800
push her back,
push.

2331
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:40,550
God is me.
I'm up in my office.

2332
01:51:40,551 --> 01:51:43,390
So you know,
like at four in the morning,

2333
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:44,380
just like,
okay,

2334
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,470
I'm on Australian jet lag.
I'm going to make it work.

2335
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:48,333
I've been up since 1:30.
I'm going to work for 16 hours and I do 

2336
01:51:53,690 --> 01:51:54,440
it.
Why?

2337
01:51:54,440 --> 01:51:56,680
Cause I'm mad at it.
Do I need to write another book?

2338
01:51:56,681 --> 01:51:58,420
Probably not.
Must die.

2339
01:51:58,480 --> 01:51:59,590
Yes.
I must.

2340
01:52:00,280 --> 01:52:01,113
I must put that into the world.
And so you create these people that are 

2341
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:06,310
telling you you can't do it.
Tells me I can't.

2342
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:11,460
The world I make money.
I never counted the accountant does I,

2343
01:52:12,411 --> 01:52:14,710
I just,
we talked a few snakes shirts coming in.

2344
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:17,710
I just say,
am I doing anything horribly wrong?

2345
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:20,320
And she'll say it will from your 
receipts.

2346
01:52:20,321 --> 01:52:23,590
It doesn't look like you eat very much,
but you sure seem to like records.

2347
01:52:23,591 --> 01:52:26,190
Are you eating those?
Um,

2348
01:52:26,260 --> 01:52:27,093
but past that I just book it,
put me in there like a here's five 

2349
01:52:31,601 --> 01:52:32,770
shows.
Can I have five more?

2350
01:52:33,100 --> 01:52:37,480
So I don't really count.
I want to do well.

2351
01:52:37,481 --> 01:52:39,700
I want to pay my bills and I don't want 
to lose my house.

2352
01:52:39,701 --> 01:52:40,534
I want to keep eating and filling the 
car with gasoline and going to the 

2353
01:52:42,671 --> 01:52:45,800
grocery store.
But I'm not

2354
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,750
just trying to,
hey,

2355
01:52:47,751 --> 01:52:49,400
I got a lot of money.
I can hang around.

2356
01:52:49,401 --> 01:52:51,080
I,
I got some money in.

2357
01:52:51,410 --> 01:52:53,060
Excuse me.
I really got to go.

2358
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:56,690
We still drove that boring car.
The Mazda six still keys,

2359
01:52:56,691 --> 01:52:59,990
get me from a to B,
super boring,

2360
01:52:59,991 --> 01:53:02,390
but damn z keep starting off.
Got Me here.

2361
01:53:02,450 --> 01:53:03,283
I love Japanese cars.
I got it because a Heidi said you're 

2362
01:53:06,650 --> 01:53:09,500
getting this car.
The other car I had,

2363
01:53:09,501 --> 01:53:11,420
they took from me.
They,

2364
01:53:12,290 --> 01:53:13,123
the powers that be.
I was the voice of Infinity car for 

2365
01:53:16,461 --> 01:53:19,700
about five years and they give you a new
car every year.

2366
01:53:19,701 --> 01:53:21,560
And that's a good car.
Wow.

2367
01:53:21,561 --> 01:53:23,090
Nice.
That's a great cod.

2368
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:26,150
One of those big queue trucks,
those cute or whatever they are.

2369
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:27,160
They're great.
Yup.

2370
01:53:27,380 --> 01:53:29,830
And it's the car of the future.
And um,

2371
01:53:29,990 --> 01:53:31,850
when the contract finally came to an 
end,

2372
01:53:31,851 --> 01:53:32,361
they said,
okay,

2373
01:53:32,361 --> 01:53:33,380
we'll come and get the car.

2374
01:53:33,380 --> 01:53:34,213
This is a perfect example.
Joe will come and get the car in 30 

2375
01:53:36,381 --> 01:53:36,921
days.
So what?

2376
01:53:36,921 --> 01:53:39,380
No,
come and get it tomorrow morning.

2377
01:53:39,950 --> 01:53:42,110
Screw you,
screw your car.

2378
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,450
And I said to Heidi,
because she's the brains.

2379
01:53:44,451 --> 01:53:45,680
I said,
I need a new car.

2380
01:53:45,681 --> 01:53:47,150
She goes,
you're getting a Mazda six.

2381
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:49,340
It's going to be blue.
And I'm picking the interior,

2382
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:52,490
get in my car.
And we wanted to just get an infinity.

2383
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:56,180
You're driving them forever because they
didn't want me anymore.

2384
01:53:56,220 --> 01:53:57,300
Well,
I mean,

2385
01:53:57,470 --> 01:54:00,050
all good things come to an end.
Wow.

2386
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,210
Double fingers don't want me anymore.
And we went to,

2387
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,863
we went to the lot and two hours later I
parked the Mazda six next to the 

2388
01:54:12,051 --> 01:54:12,884
infinity that got taken while I was on 
the set of the TV show the next morning 

2389
01:54:17,180 --> 01:54:18,013
and I drove my new car to the set and I 
kind of shit compared to the infinity 

2390
01:54:22,641 --> 01:54:23,210
though,
isn't it?

2391
01:54:23,210 --> 01:54:25,430
It's a different kind of ride.
It makes sense.

2392
01:54:25,970 --> 01:54:29,390
It makes you very humble because you 
floor it in the nine.

2393
01:54:29,391 --> 01:54:30,224
Durables go calm.
We're working in the sunflower seeds 

2394
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:34,970
fall out and every other car passes you 
and you're.

2395
01:54:35,160 --> 01:54:37,250
I'm coming and uh,
yeah,

2396
01:54:37,251 --> 01:54:39,310
you get used to a nice ride.
Um,

2397
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:42,840
but it's um,
and that was that.

2398
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:44,150
She said,
oh,

2399
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,620
well why don't you,
we'll take a couple of days.

2400
01:54:45,621 --> 01:54:47,900
I'll go,
no new car right now.

2401
01:54:47,930 --> 01:54:48,763
But that's my question,
like 9:00 AM tomorrow morning or to a 

2402
01:54:50,170 --> 01:54:51,560
really nice car.
I mean,

2403
01:54:51,561 --> 01:54:53,010
you work really hard.
Yep.

2404
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:53,893
How do you take any compensation or do 
you have any like happiness that you 

2405
01:54:58,971 --> 01:55:01,340
derive from buying something?
I have no.

2406
01:55:01,370 --> 01:55:03,500
You have a really good stereo stereo.
Yeah.

2407
01:55:03,501 --> 01:55:04,880
We talked about it last time you were 
here,

2408
01:55:04,881 --> 01:55:05,714
your giant speakers,
but don't you want a car that has a 

2409
01:55:07,551 --> 01:55:08,330
crazy stereos?

2410
01:55:08,330 --> 01:55:09,163
Well,
Nah,

2411
01:55:09,350 --> 01:55:14,350
I just go to trader Joe's and auditions 
and to the Joe Rogan podcast.

2412
01:55:15,160 --> 01:55:17,450
No,
I live in really utilitarian life.

2413
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:20,240
Like in La when I'm off the road.
You don't even wear a watch?

2414
01:55:20,670 --> 01:55:21,860
No,
I use the phone.

2415
01:55:22,140 --> 01:55:22,973
Um,
I use the watch when I travel just so I 

2416
01:55:24,921 --> 01:55:26,360
can just see the time,
see the time.

2417
01:55:26,890 --> 01:55:29,670
Um,
but when I'm off the road I just use the

2418
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,730
phone.
It's just laziness.

2419
01:55:32,010 --> 01:55:32,843
I'm,
I live very utilitarian here because 

2420
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:37,004
basically I'm just counting down the 
days before I leave again because a lot 

2421
01:55:39,561 --> 01:55:43,530
of my work happens out in the world 
location,

2422
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:47,190
like a film or TV show or just touring 
or traveling.

2423
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:49,050
Uh,
last year,

2424
01:55:49,470 --> 01:55:51,180
uh,
Heidi said something funny,

2425
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:52,980
she's,
you're driving me crazy at the office,

2426
01:55:52,981 --> 01:55:56,010
like pacing and huffing and puffing like
a wild animal.

2427
01:55:56,460 --> 01:55:57,293
She said,
I'm going to book you a trip and you 

2428
01:55:59,131 --> 01:56:00,930
can't know where you're going to the day
you leave.

2429
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:03,990
I'm just going to get you outta here for
10 days because you're driving me crazy.

2430
01:56:03,991 --> 01:56:05,910
I will kill you.
So I said bucket,

2431
01:56:06,360 --> 01:56:07,193
and so I said,
all I need is the right electrical plug 

2432
01:56:09,241 --> 01:56:11,550
in the basic temperature range so I know
how to pack.

2433
01:56:11,910 --> 01:56:14,850
She gave it to me and I picked the 
itinerary up,

2434
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:18,210
got in the car to go to the airport is 
this nice lady,

2435
01:56:18,420 --> 01:56:19,620
takes me to the airport.
She goes,

2436
01:56:19,621 --> 01:56:20,670
where are we going today,
Hun?

2437
01:56:21,060 --> 01:56:22,890
I said,
let's see where the boss is sending me.

2438
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,570
I said,
I'm going to Lima,

2439
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:25,613
Peru,
and so I was in Lima and Cusco for a 

2440
01:56:28,920 --> 01:56:29,753
week working on my book manuscript and 
walking the streets up in the Peruvian 

2441
01:56:33,511 --> 01:56:36,150
Andes up in Cusco.
And so I.

2442
01:56:36,240 --> 01:56:39,840
A lot of my life happens out in the 
world,

2443
01:56:39,930 --> 01:56:44,550
so when I'm here I'm just editing and 
prepping to get outta here.

2444
01:56:44,790 --> 01:56:47,310
And so a car,
low maintenance,

2445
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:50,760
close,
low maintenance and conspicuous.

2446
01:56:50,820 --> 01:56:51,653
Yeah.
I tried trying not to have anything on 

2447
01:56:54,091 --> 01:56:54,924
this shirt.
I'd love to have a listen to black 

2448
01:56:56,401 --> 01:56:58,350
sabbath tee shirt on.
I'd wear that one every day.

2449
01:56:58,351 --> 01:56:59,184
I love that shirt,
but I'm always trying to slip through 

2450
01:57:02,460 --> 01:57:06,000
crowds and just head down.
Just blank close.

2451
01:57:06,670 --> 01:57:07,503
That's a.
You have a very interesting philosophy 

2452
01:57:08,971 --> 01:57:11,730
and like I said,
your work ethic and your flow.

2453
01:57:11,790 --> 01:57:15,210
It's very inspiring because it makes me 
want to work more.

2454
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:16,140
It really does.

2455
01:57:16,140 --> 01:57:18,390
When I talked to you and I listened to 
you get plenty done,

2456
01:57:18,391 --> 01:57:19,141
sir.
I know I did,

2457
01:57:19,141 --> 01:57:21,990
but that's one of the reasons why I do 
is because I get inspired by people like

2458
01:57:22,020 --> 01:57:24,330
me.
I get inspired by you and other people.

2459
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:26,830
Like I love getting inspired.
I,

2460
01:57:26,900 --> 01:57:31,110
I live a fairly solitary life,
but I have a lot of heroes.

2461
01:57:31,500 --> 01:57:35,660
I'm a fan of bands and people.
I just dig presidents and,

2462
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:36,863
and other people in other countries.
I go to see bands play and they don't 

2463
01:57:40,021 --> 01:57:40,854
know what I have all their records.
I have the bootlegs Uber Fan of so many 

2464
01:57:44,371 --> 01:57:46,020
people,
like a fraction my age.

2465
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:49,320
Um,
it because I need that.

2466
01:57:49,321 --> 01:57:51,990
I need to be pumped up by other people.
And it works.

2467
01:57:51,991 --> 01:57:53,370
You put on someone's record,
Jack.

2468
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:54,750
Yeah man.
That's great.

2469
01:57:55,120 --> 01:57:56,970
Well these 19,
what does he know?

2470
01:57:57,130 --> 01:57:59,400
He plays a guitar better than I'll ever 
be like,

2471
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:00,420
well,
what are you talking about?

2472
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:03,740
And so it can come in all kinds of ways.
I need people,

2473
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:05,530
amazing people when I travel.
So I,

2474
01:58:05,531 --> 01:58:07,500
I need that.
I'm in.

2475
01:58:07,501 --> 01:58:09,630
The only thing good about me in my 
opinion,

2476
01:58:09,631 --> 01:58:12,660
is what I do like.
Don't be my friend.

2477
01:58:12,661 --> 01:58:13,090
I,
I'm,

2478
01:58:13,090 --> 01:58:16,260
I'm no good.
I'll help you move your house.

2479
01:58:16,410 --> 01:58:19,950
I'll help you move or painting your 
house.

2480
01:58:20,520 --> 01:58:22,890
But I don't want to come to Thanksgiving
dinner.

2481
01:58:23,220 --> 01:58:25,440
I really don't.
But if you're in trouble,

2482
01:58:25,620 --> 01:58:28,860
I'll drive from here to Ohio to get you 
out of the trouble.

2483
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:29,933
I'm so happy to bail you out of a jam.
Let's don't want to come over for 

2484
01:58:33,831 --> 01:58:34,664
dinner.
I don't want to come over for the 

2485
01:58:34,981 --> 01:58:37,860
holidays and I less your William 
Shatner.

2486
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:40,280
Yeah.
Right.

2487
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:46,600
So what's good about me when people are.
I would love to hang out with you.

2488
01:58:46,661 --> 01:58:47,494
I'm like,
no,

2489
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:49,960
just use your books are interesting.

2490
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,630
Thank you.
Let me go write them.

2491
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:54,930
That's the only the,
the,

2492
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:55,773
the,
when I'm on stage or got the books of 

2493
01:58:57,281 --> 01:58:58,114
the radio show I do on Kcrw,
that's my great human greatest hits the 

2494
01:59:02,801 --> 01:59:03,634
rest of my life.
I'm just a nervous wreck trying to get 

2495
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:06,334
somewhere on time and kick ass.
And so I travel for months at a time 

2496
01:59:12,431 --> 01:59:13,264
with road manager award.
My road manager of many years at top 

2497
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:17,260
guy.
Fantastic guy.

2498
01:59:18,740 --> 01:59:21,730
There's hours that go by where we don't 
talk.

2499
01:59:22,030 --> 01:59:23,800
He's got a life.
I,

2500
01:59:24,110 --> 01:59:24,943
I have a life and we sit on the bus and 
hours go by and there's no sound except 

2501
01:59:29,081 --> 01:59:30,370
the TV,
whatever.

2502
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:31,630
Xyz.
It's fine.

2503
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:34,390
But um,
my,

2504
01:59:34,520 --> 01:59:35,353
what's good about me is what you see on 
stage on the page when I do my little 

2505
01:59:40,571 --> 01:59:42,730
radio show,
the rest of it.

2506
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:47,880
I'm not good friend material,
but I will help your ass out of a jam.

2507
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:49,510
Like,
Hey,

2508
01:59:49,511 --> 01:59:51,520
I'm in Long Beach.
Can you come bail me out of jail?

2509
01:59:51,521 --> 01:59:54,160
It's three in the morning.
I'm so ready to do that for you.

2510
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:56,280
Like that's a very unusual,
quite.

2511
01:59:56,281 --> 01:59:58,060
I don't know why it is.
Why do you find,

2512
01:59:58,180 --> 02:00:00,160
I don't know,
but that doesn't bug me at all.

2513
02:00:00,790 --> 02:00:03,470
I'm just happy to kind of be the dog 
with the ball.

2514
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:05,150
The bottle of alcohol.
Yeah.

2515
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:05,531
Yeah,
yeah.

2516
02:00:05,531 --> 02:00:07,390
Running up the hill.
Um,

2517
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:11,650
cause I'm so happy to get you out of a 
jam.

2518
02:00:12,130 --> 02:00:14,140
Just hey,
come and meet the family.

2519
02:00:14,141 --> 02:00:16,130
Please don't make me meet your family.

2520
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:21,940
How did you meet Joey?
How'd you meet Joe Ideas?

2521
02:00:22,180 --> 02:00:24,790
Uh,
I think Heidi set that up.

2522
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:28,330
You'd never met him before he shows via 
Heidi via you?

2523
02:00:28,600 --> 02:00:29,920
Uh,
yeah,

2524
02:00:30,010 --> 02:00:33,580
I knew who he was and um,
he's a really lovable guy.

2525
02:00:33,670 --> 02:00:38,020
As soon as I met him I liked him just by
seeing them online,

2526
02:00:38,350 --> 02:00:40,960
but when I met him I read there's 
nothing not to like,

2527
02:00:40,961 --> 02:00:44,440
he's so honest.
He's full,

2528
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:46,600
full exposure,
like who,

2529
02:00:46,840 --> 02:00:50,020
who he is.
You get it in 60 seconds.

2530
02:00:50,350 --> 02:00:53,740
But I think it's why people like him 
because there's no bs and like,

2531
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:54,611
you know,
there's the good,

2532
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:55,444
the bad of anybody.
He lets you know who he is in the first 

2533
02:00:58,961 --> 02:01:00,610
five minutes and you can take or leave 
it.

2534
02:01:00,730 --> 02:01:02,410
Yeah.
But there's no ambiguity.

2535
02:01:03,070 --> 02:01:03,903
And I really liked being around that 
because you can be yourself because he 

2536
02:01:09,191 --> 02:01:10,780
has shown up being himself.

2537
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:12,273
He's not holding back.
That's a really good way of looking at 

2538
02:01:13,991 --> 02:01:14,824
it.
You can be yourself because he is being 

2539
02:01:16,271 --> 02:01:19,270
himself totally.
And he's not going to judge you on that.

2540
02:01:19,271 --> 02:01:21,430
It's going to give you the freedom.
He's going to be himself,

2541
02:01:21,580 --> 02:01:24,760
but give you also the freedom to be 
yourself unlimited.

2542
02:01:24,910 --> 02:01:26,550
Yeah.
I mean we,

2543
02:01:26,610 --> 02:01:27,443
we spoke for a while on his podcast,
had a great time and he's one of those 

2544
02:01:31,631 --> 02:01:33,220
guys.
If he called me at three in the morning,

2545
02:01:33,221 --> 02:01:34,150
Hey,
I'm in trouble.

2546
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:35,380
I'm in San Diego.
I'm like,

2547
02:01:35,381 --> 02:01:37,390
hold on,
give me three hours.

2548
02:01:37,930 --> 02:01:38,321
I mean,
I,

2549
02:01:38,321 --> 02:01:40,220
I'll help like come

2550
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:45,220
and meet the family.
I please just send those specific,

2551
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:51,110
like so specific.
But know I'm just a,

2552
02:01:51,160 --> 02:01:51,993
I don't want to come over,
but you don't want bullshit smalltalk 

2553
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:57,440
and you've got things to do and you're 
obsessed.

2554
02:01:57,441 --> 02:01:57,950
But.
But I'm,

2555
02:01:57,950 --> 02:01:59,900
I'm not what I'm trying to get across 
as.

2556
02:01:59,901 --> 02:02:02,750
I'm not mean spirited.
I'm just so happy to help.

2557
02:02:03,060 --> 02:02:04,710
Just a little awkward.
Yeah.

2558
02:02:04,980 --> 02:02:07,740
But he always ready to help.
I think that this thing is,

2559
02:02:07,850 --> 02:02:10,070
the thing of that awkwardness is the 
fuel.

2560
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:11,383
It's like we were talking about about 
having imposter syndrome that I don't 

2561
02:02:13,851 --> 02:02:15,820
think it ever goes away.
I thought one day it would go,

2562
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:16,753
it would go away.
I'm more comfortable meeting famous 

2563
02:02:18,651 --> 02:02:21,440
people now than I've ever been before,
but I still feel full of shit.

2564
02:02:21,740 --> 02:02:22,573
I think you always will.
And everybody that I've ever talked to 

2565
02:02:23,841 --> 02:02:24,500
that is any good.

2566
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:25,333
They all say the same thing.
Like they all kind of feel like no one 

2567
02:02:27,801 --> 02:02:31,220
ever feels like they're anything special
and you always like,

2568
02:02:31,221 --> 02:02:32,054
if there were any good they don't know 
and you always ruthlessly self critical 

2569
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,730
and trying to get better.
I mean I've worked with big actors,

2570
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:39,343
big,
Big Rock Stars and the Big Rock Stars 

2571
02:02:42,890 --> 02:02:45,440
like one big rock star once one time 
said to me,

2572
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:46,670
I opened.
He said,

2573
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:48,470
is there anyone out there?
I said,

2574
02:02:48,500 --> 02:02:52,580
uh,
like 19,000 people.

2575
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:54,003
You smell the wd 40.
That's how they got the last thousand 

2576
02:02:56,031 --> 02:02:57,380
people in.
Are you kidding?

2577
02:02:57,650 --> 02:02:58,483
He said,
I'm always worried that no one's going 

2578
02:02:59,261 --> 02:03:00,021
to show up.
I said,

2579
02:03:00,021 --> 02:03:02,990
when was that?
Ever Been Your problem?

2580
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:03,751
He said,
well,

2581
02:03:03,751 --> 02:03:05,670
never,
but who is this a?

2582
02:03:05,671 --> 02:03:10,671
See Jesus Christ who's just one of my 
favorite people.

2583
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:13,520
He's just so.
He's another guy.

2584
02:03:14,140 --> 02:03:14,973
He's honest.
How many people were like in some 

2585
02:03:22,330 --> 02:03:23,163
floridian?

2586
02:03:23,950 --> 02:03:26,050
Those are the will be anyone other than,
oh,

2587
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:26,451
no,
no,

2588
02:03:26,451 --> 02:03:26,861
no,
no,

2589
02:03:26,861 --> 02:03:27,291
no,
no.

2590
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:30,830
And he goes out there and the place goes
nuts to show is great of course.

2591
02:03:30,831 --> 02:03:32,330
And I said,
you worry about people don't,

2592
02:03:32,360 --> 02:03:34,720
she'll get really depressed.
And I went,

2593
02:03:35,600 --> 02:03:38,260
okay.
And you know,

2594
02:03:38,950 --> 02:03:41,210
I did the beacon theater once many years
ago.

2595
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:42,430
New York.
Beautiful Room.

2596
02:03:42,460 --> 02:03:43,890
Loved that place.
Um,

2597
02:03:44,690 --> 02:03:46,130
I was,
uh,

2598
02:03:46,131 --> 02:03:46,964
I was,
uh,

2599
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:48,003
a few days later I was at mtv doing 
something with like Matt Pinfield or 

2600
02:03:51,711 --> 02:03:56,540
somebody that was living in New York and
I'm leaving in the courtesy lady.

2601
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:57,770
She said,
hey,

2602
02:03:57,800 --> 02:04:01,550
George Carlin is in the green room and 
he wants to meet you.

2603
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:02,780
And went,
wait a minute,

2604
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:05,910
dumb question.
The George Carlin [inaudible].

2605
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:08,810
I've been listening to that guy since I 
was an eighth grade class clown.

2606
02:04:08,811 --> 02:04:13,130
And occupation fool actually came out 
for me to go to the record store.

2607
02:04:13,131 --> 02:04:15,920
They were not nice price records.
They were what was on.

2608
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:19,220
That's how old I am memorized and by 
eighth grade of course,

2609
02:04:19,580 --> 02:04:21,260
and I said,
George Carlin wants you to meet me.

2610
02:04:21,450 --> 02:04:23,630
Okay.
Walk in and there's George Carlin,

2611
02:04:23,631 --> 02:04:24,464
he's there to promote his next hbo thing
and he's going to do like multiple 

2612
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:31,700
nights at the beacon theater place.
I would never sell out who's going to do

2613
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:34,040
a month or whatever,
and he said,

2614
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:34,580
hey,
I'm.

2615
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:35,880
I said,
Mr Carlos [inaudible].

2616
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:36,950
I'm George.
I'm like,

2617
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:38,513
wow.

2618
02:04:38,670 --> 02:04:39,331
She said,
Oh,

2619
02:04:39,331 --> 02:04:41,700
you did a book signing the other night 
at tower records?

2620
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:42,631
I said,
yeah.

2621
02:04:42,631 --> 02:04:43,411
He goes,
oh man.

2622
02:04:43,411 --> 02:04:44,244
It was so cool.
I was in line for like half an hour and 

2623
02:04:46,141 --> 02:04:47,880
finally I got so cold.
I went home.

2624
02:04:48,570 --> 02:04:51,120
I said,
you waited in line to meet me?

2625
02:04:51,121 --> 02:04:51,954
He's like,
yeah.

2626
02:04:52,200 --> 02:04:53,970
I'm like,
why don't you just walk in like,

2627
02:04:53,971 --> 02:04:55,230
oh,
I can't do that man.

2628
02:04:56,500 --> 02:04:59,640
And he said,
so you just were at the beacon?

2629
02:04:59,641 --> 02:05:00,211
I said,
yeah,

2630
02:05:00,211 --> 02:05:01,590
it was amazing.
He said,

2631
02:05:01,820 --> 02:05:04,230
did they get the jokes?
I said,

2632
02:05:04,800 --> 02:05:06,930
oh,
that's not really what I do.

2633
02:05:06,931 --> 02:05:07,651
I said,
I'm sorry,

2634
02:05:07,651 --> 02:05:09,030
what do you mean?
He goes,

2635
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:11,880
d to d,
Can you get to the audience?

2636
02:05:11,881 --> 02:05:12,900
So that stage.
I said,

2637
02:05:12,901 --> 02:05:13,734
it's actually a pretty big place.
It's a lot his feet to before the first 

2638
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:18,060
row.
I said,

2639
02:05:18,061 --> 02:05:18,540
yeah.
I said,

2640
02:05:18,540 --> 02:05:20,850
you're George Carlin.
I think you're going to do okay.

2641
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:25,050
But he was sincerely wondering like,
is it going to be okay in there?

2642
02:05:25,051 --> 02:05:26,850
I'm like,
are you kidding?

2643
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:27,713
You were handcuffed with lenny bruce in 
the back of a cop car and you're asking 

2644
02:05:31,831 --> 02:05:34,540
me if it's going to be okay.
Was He handcuffed?

2645
02:05:34,870 --> 02:05:36,360
Yeah.
It's a great book.

2646
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:40,050
It's an that great book,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

2647
02:05:40,050 --> 02:05:40,500
Lenny Bruce.
Ah,

2648
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:43,080
in that book,
it's a great read reading and a half.

2649
02:05:43,081 --> 02:05:45,330
I've read it like 22 years ago.
It was fantastic.

2650
02:05:45,331 --> 02:05:49,130
I think I read it that long ago to 
forgot about dre was a time when the,

2651
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:49,921
you know,
as,

2652
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:50,754
as you know,
the first amendment was not being used 

2653
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:55,440
in Lenny Bruce's life towards the end of
his life and that was his.

2654
02:05:55,470 --> 02:05:59,870
Every standup thing he did was about the
law towards the end and using,

2655
02:06:00,170 --> 02:06:01,003
doing a show one night.
George Carlin was there under age and 

2656
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:05,970
George said something and they were 
waiting.

2657
02:06:05,971 --> 02:06:08,840
They pounced on them and then they went 
through the crowd Id id id.

2658
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,601
Oh,
come here,

2659
02:06:09,601 --> 02:06:12,060
youngster.
And they handcuffed them together.

2660
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,760
So I said,
and that's how you met Lenny Bruce,

2661
02:06:14,761 --> 02:06:15,331
right?
He said,

2662
02:06:15,331 --> 02:06:17,280
no,
I had met him before,

2663
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:18,593
but he said like,
we were literally one pair of handcuffs 

2664
02:06:20,370 --> 02:06:23,630
together just like the book,
but I thought that's easily.

2665
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:24,690
That's not how we met.
I said,

2666
02:06:24,691 --> 02:06:26,400
so how'd you guys meet?
He said,

2667
02:06:26,460 --> 02:06:30,600
Lenny Bruce was very sympathetic to 
young comics,

2668
02:06:30,750 --> 02:06:33,780
so what we would do is like he said,
give me your best five minutes,

2669
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:35,410
and he would critique us.
Wow.

2670
02:06:35,580 --> 02:06:36,990
Soon as he tried to take your mature,
said,

2671
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:37,271
no,
no,

2672
02:06:37,271 --> 02:06:37,680
no.
He just.

2673
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:38,161
He said,
look,

2674
02:06:38,161 --> 02:06:39,180
okay,
leave that part out.

2675
02:06:39,181 --> 02:06:42,150
That part sucks.
Do more of that in that first part.

2676
02:06:42,151 --> 02:06:43,440
Put it lasts.
You would like help.

2677
02:06:43,740 --> 02:06:45,960
When he said he was great with all the 
young comics,

2678
02:06:45,961 --> 02:06:47,100
he said,
they'll give me your stuff.

2679
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:48,840
Okay,
here's how you redo it.

2680
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,340
Make it better.
I said,

2681
02:06:50,341 --> 02:06:51,930
so you had known him before?
He said,

2682
02:06:51,931 --> 02:06:53,250
yeah.
I said,

2683
02:06:53,251 --> 02:06:54,590
well,
because you know,

2684
02:06:54,610 --> 02:06:56,320
Lenny Bruce to me is a real,
again,

2685
02:06:56,321 --> 02:06:59,940
a hero and inspiration fought back and 
um,

2686
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:02,540
I,
I walked out of there until like,

2687
02:07:02,541 --> 02:07:03,570
you know,
the freezing,

2688
02:07:03,600 --> 02:07:06,480
you know,
east New York to take the end of the car

2689
02:07:06,480 --> 02:07:07,313
back down to the East village.
But the fact that here's this guy with 

2690
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:11,643
the point I'm making is stone cold pro 
anywhere where I sell out half the 

2691
02:07:15,481 --> 02:07:19,560
tickets he does 20 nights there.
I'm in know you'll never get out of that

2692
02:07:19,561 --> 02:07:21,510
shadow.
And even he is saying,

2693
02:07:21,511 --> 02:07:22,344
Hey,
I have a question and here's what I've 

2694
02:07:24,631 --> 02:07:28,770
found with all of your big actors and 
big,

2695
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,240
the ones,
the ones I've worked with,

2696
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:34,440
they are obedient to the muse.
They work for the art.

2697
02:07:34,680 --> 02:07:38,740
They are so subservient to the job.
It's not about,

2698
02:07:38,741 --> 02:07:39,401
hey,
I'm rich,

2699
02:07:39,401 --> 02:07:40,840
I'm populous.
Like dammit,

2700
02:07:40,850 --> 02:07:41,683
I gotta make this script come to life.
And they fear it like someone on their 

2701
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:48,940
first job.
And there might've been a middle period,

2702
02:07:48,941 --> 02:07:49,774
like in the seventies,
they had their idiot phase for three 

2703
02:07:51,941 --> 02:07:54,820
years and they kind of went sideways.
But man,

2704
02:07:54,910 --> 02:07:57,850
the big actors I've worked with are just
so like,

2705
02:07:57,851 --> 02:07:58,684
okay,
this take is everything and it's a good 

2706
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:01,361
lesson.
You're like,

2707
02:08:01,361 --> 02:08:03,130
okay,
never lose that.

2708
02:08:03,190 --> 02:08:04,430
Yeah,
because that's what you have when you're

2709
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,353
young and you're coming up and you're 
starting to show promise and somewhere 

2710
02:08:08,211 --> 02:08:09,044
along the line it seems like some people
get into this mindset that they deserve 

2711
02:08:13,371 --> 02:08:14,204
it and when they deserve it,
it's a terrible thing that happens to 

2712
02:08:17,301 --> 02:08:18,890
comedians.
There's something that happens.

2713
02:08:18,891 --> 02:08:19,724
Comedians when they can't relate to 
people anymore and they stopped being 

2714
02:08:21,951 --> 02:08:22,784
relevant and by George waiting in line 
to see you outside in the cold shows 

2715
02:08:27,291 --> 02:08:28,124
that he never really got to that place,
that that bad place and he was probably 

2716
02:08:32,211 --> 02:08:36,020
the most prolific standup of all time 
because he never stopped.

2717
02:08:36,080 --> 02:08:40,670
He would do a fresh hbo our every year.
Every year he would just sit down and he

2718
02:08:40,671 --> 02:08:41,504
would write it all.
He would write it all out and then he 

2719
02:08:44,121 --> 02:08:46,760
would just kind of fine tuned it.
Sort of like you were saying,

2720
02:08:46,761 --> 02:08:47,594
you do nude,
fine tune it and performance after 

2721
02:08:49,971 --> 02:08:50,804
performance and then put it on hbo and 
then start working on the next one and 

2722
02:08:53,931 --> 02:08:55,010
then just crank them out.

2723
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:56,353
Yeah.
I was told by someone who had a in as 

2724
02:08:58,161 --> 02:08:58,994
venue in northern California.
He just sits in front of the mirror 

2725
02:09:01,251 --> 02:09:04,640
before the show and does the whole show 
at hyper speed and the low voice.

2726
02:09:06,580 --> 02:09:07,413
Oh,
I did that on a TV show once means the 

2727
02:09:10,071 --> 02:09:11,740
actors.
It was one of the actors ideas say,

2728
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:12,583
okay,
everyone in my trailer and we did the 

2729
02:09:13,371 --> 02:09:14,204
whole show at hyperspeed and the low 
voice standing in a huddle was really 

2730
02:09:18,891 --> 02:09:21,230
cool because we were in each other's 
face going on.

2731
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:23,600
It's funny and we just kind of did it 
like this,

2732
02:09:23,601 --> 02:09:27,020
like crazy mumbling fest for like 20 
minutes and we're like,

2733
02:09:27,021 --> 02:09:28,060
okay,
okay.

2734
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:30,170
We got it.
We went out there and did it.

2735
02:09:30,171 --> 02:09:31,004
It was like live in front of a TV 
audience and it was like I'd never done 

2736
02:09:33,231 --> 02:09:36,680
that before.
He was really cool and apparently that's

2737
02:09:36,681 --> 02:09:37,850
how George preps.

2738
02:09:38,030 --> 02:09:39,470
Wow,
that's interesting.

2739
02:09:39,500 --> 02:09:40,333
I don't know anybody else who does that.
Most people don't even look at 

2740
02:09:42,951 --> 02:09:45,140
themselves.
They don't stand in front of a mirror,

2741
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:48,380
they just don't look at myself.
But I do one thing that actually works.

2742
02:09:48,381 --> 02:09:51,350
I pace.
And I,

2743
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:52,720
I,
uh,

2744
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:57,050
I quote Lincoln's speeches as a 
centering exercise,

2745
02:09:58,190 --> 02:10:00,650
especially as speech from a,
like January 19th,

2746
02:10:00,651 --> 02:10:02,000
18,
38 kimmy some,

2747
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:05,180
it's a famous speech.
He said when he was talking about,

2748
02:10:05,181 --> 02:10:09,230
will America ever be taken over by 
anywhere else?

2749
02:10:09,320 --> 02:10:09,861
And he said,
no,

2750
02:10:09,861 --> 02:10:11,870
the only way America's going to fall 
from within.

2751
02:10:12,290 --> 02:10:13,123
So we said,
should we fear some transatlantic giant 

2752
02:10:15,131 --> 02:10:17,450
to cross the ocean and crushes us a 
blow?

2753
02:10:17,630 --> 02:10:18,740
Never,
uh,

2754
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:19,603
all the country in Asia,
Europe and Africa with their war chests 

2755
02:10:23,690 --> 02:10:24,523
combined,
ours with charges of the world aren't 

2756
02:10:26,450 --> 02:10:27,283
accepted.
And Bonaparte as a commander could not 

2757
02:10:29,540 --> 02:10:30,373
in a trial of a thousand years so much 
as take a sip from the river or a tread 

2758
02:10:34,341 --> 02:10:35,090
on the,
on the,

2759
02:10:35,090 --> 02:10:36,350
on the Blue Ridge mountains.

2760
02:10:36,790 --> 02:10:38,990
Uh,
if suicide,

2761
02:10:39,020 --> 02:10:41,210
if destruction be our lot,
we,

2762
02:10:41,211 --> 02:10:42,650
uh,
we must,

2763
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:43,484
uh,
either live through all the time or die 

2764
02:10:45,701 --> 02:10:46,534
by suicide.
And I just take chunks of that speech 

2765
02:10:48,951 --> 02:10:50,480
because it's so easy.
It's like 28,

2766
02:10:50,481 --> 02:10:52,520
29 years of age.
He's so eloquent.

2767
02:10:52,790 --> 02:10:56,060
A sentence of Lincoln is worth 10 of 
anyone else's.

2768
02:10:56,090 --> 02:10:59,060
It's all online for free,
but go to the.

2769
02:10:59,061 --> 02:10:59,894
It's called the speech to the young 
men's lyceum or the perpetuation of our 

2770
02:11:02,181 --> 02:11:06,170
government institutions and it's like 
3,200 words and it's.

2771
02:11:06,200 --> 02:11:07,820
It'll be the best thing you read this 
week.

2772
02:11:07,850 --> 02:11:09,980
It hasn't work as a centering exercise.
I don't know.

2773
02:11:09,981 --> 02:11:12,560
I just get in the Lincoln framework 
where words matter to him.

2774
02:11:12,561 --> 02:11:15,230
He's a lawyer and a politician,
so he's a double bastard.

2775
02:11:16,490 --> 02:11:21,110
I was in the vault of the Lincoln Museum
in Springfield a few years ago.

2776
02:11:21,111 --> 02:11:24,830
They let me in and they pull it out of 
one of his,

2777
02:11:25,180 --> 02:11:27,150
a beaver skin top hats and they.

2778
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:28,930
They won't let me touch it.
Of course I didn't try,

2779
02:11:28,950 --> 02:11:30,560
but the guy with the gloves pulls it out
and he said,

2780
02:11:30,980 --> 02:11:35,180
do you notice an indentation on the 
right side of the brim?

2781
02:11:35,540 --> 02:11:36,051
I said,
yeah.

2782
02:11:36,051 --> 02:11:37,010
He goes,
what do you think that is?

2783
02:11:37,011 --> 02:11:38,170
I said,
let me guess there.

2784
02:11:38,410 --> 02:11:41,480
There's one on top and two underneath,
and I looked and there was,

2785
02:11:41,481 --> 02:11:46,481
I said that's him doffing his cap,
his hat over and over again,

2786
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:49,230
which,
what wears out the beaver skin.

2787
02:11:49,231 --> 02:11:50,064
And he said,
yeah,

2788
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:51,680
how do you think you wore it out?
I said,

2789
02:11:51,681 --> 02:11:55,340
he's a politician and a lawyer,
so he's trying to get everyone's vote.

2790
02:11:55,550 --> 02:11:57,020
And when.
So he's like,

2791
02:11:57,021 --> 02:11:57,681
good morning,
good morning,

2792
02:11:57,681 --> 02:11:59,600
good morning world,
because I have an office and I'm running

2793
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:00,920
for office.
And he said,

2794
02:12:00,980 --> 02:12:01,813
yeah,
that's probably it.

2795
02:12:02,660 --> 02:12:03,830
And um,
that's funny.

2796
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,630
These beaver skin line,
their hats.

2797
02:12:06,040 --> 02:12:08,120
Well,
it was the outside of it and this famous

2798
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:10,190
hats,
you saw him in the Lincoln Museum.

2799
02:12:10,191 --> 02:12:14,500
They have one in the vault and literally
he wore out the hide.

2800
02:12:14,690 --> 02:12:15,530
Wow.
Um,

2801
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:20,810
but I use Lincoln and amendments from 
the Constitution.

2802
02:12:21,480 --> 02:12:23,750
Um,
the 14th is a,

2803
02:12:23,870 --> 02:12:26,730
is,
it's in four parts or five parts.

2804
02:12:26,780 --> 02:12:30,680
The top part for we the people,
the rest is legal ease and I'll do that.

2805
02:12:30,681 --> 02:12:32,570
Or the fourth amendment.
The privacy one.

2806
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:33,404
That's a great one.
It's not completely in the front of my 

2807
02:12:35,271 --> 02:12:36,104
brain pan,
but I carry a copy of the constitution 

2808
02:12:37,881 --> 02:12:38,714
with me whenever I travel and I open it 
like people open the Bible and all just 

2809
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:44,320
pick an amendment and read it.
Really?

2810
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:45,290
Yeah.
And I,

2811
02:12:45,300 --> 02:12:45,981
I have,
uh,

2812
02:12:45,981 --> 02:12:46,814
one of those,
the constitution for idiot books were 

2813
02:12:48,231 --> 02:12:51,110
like lawyers write about here's when it 
was brought into law,

2814
02:12:51,111 --> 02:12:51,920
here's why.

2815
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:56,870
Here's what it means in layman terms.
And it's never not interesting to read.

2816
02:12:57,900 --> 02:12:58,733
The constitution is great.
It is fascinating and we think this is 

2817
02:13:00,651 --> 02:13:01,484
an experiment in self government that 
these people from 300 years ago put 

2818
02:13:04,911 --> 02:13:05,750
together.
It's Kinda,

2819
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:11,140
they kinda are gods to me in that they 
couldn't see the future.

2820
02:13:11,481 --> 02:13:16,481
Maybe they couldn't see the Ar 15,
but Jefferson and company definitely saw

2821
02:13:17,121 --> 02:13:20,660
how easily corruptible humans are.
You give him a little bit of power.

2822
02:13:20,720 --> 02:13:21,553
We can get a little crazy.
And American democracy is really all 

2823
02:13:24,591 --> 02:13:25,610
about the checks you like,
you're,

2824
02:13:25,611 --> 02:13:27,230
you're,
you're a bad ass,

2825
02:13:27,231 --> 02:13:30,140
but you're not a bad ass as Congress.
Congress is going to check.

2826
02:13:30,141 --> 02:13:30,974
We're seeing now with,
I mean trump where we're essentially 

2827
02:13:33,751 --> 02:13:34,584
seeing the reason why all these checks 
and balances are put in place in the 

2828
02:13:38,341 --> 02:13:40,600
first place because he's just like him.
Yeah.

2829
02:13:40,830 --> 02:13:45,600
Because we have president comes from we 
the people.

2830
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:46,913
It can be you or me potentially and I 
think the framers really saw that like 

2831
02:13:51,991 --> 02:13:52,824
it should be from the people.
So we got to put this person in checks 

2832
02:13:55,711 --> 02:13:59,370
because he might be a failed 
businessman,

2833
02:13:59,371 --> 02:14:02,400
bad reality show actor who doesn't 
understand.

2834
02:14:02,790 --> 02:14:06,990
I have to read 1500 pages of stuff this 
weekend and have five lawyers advised me

2835
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:08,243
no golf for fun for me.
I'm the president and a lot of 

2836
02:14:11,191 --> 02:14:13,440
presidents do understand before they go 
in,

2837
02:14:13,441 --> 02:14:13,831
like,
boy,

2838
02:14:13,831 --> 02:14:17,250
this job's going to be boring and a lot 
of people are going to be mad.

2839
02:14:17,340 --> 02:14:18,173
And in my lifetime we finally have a 
president who really is from the people 

2840
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:23,760
who says,
uh,

2841
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:25,560
he looks at like,
you know,

2842
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:27,470
here's eight folders of stuff to read.
And like,

2843
02:14:27,480 --> 02:14:29,280
I don't think so.
Give me the cliff notes.

2844
02:14:29,490 --> 02:14:30,060
Yeah.

2845
02:14:30,060 --> 02:14:31,560
Like I'll play it from the hip.
Like,

2846
02:14:31,920 --> 02:14:33,330
no,
I'm going to watch Fox.

2847
02:14:33,331 --> 02:14:34,164
And friends,
you tell me what I needed to know and 

2848
02:14:35,731 --> 02:14:36,564
you know,
it's not for me to sit and rip on the 

2849
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:39,990
guy because he's not here to defend 
himself,

2850
02:14:39,991 --> 02:14:40,824
but never in my life have I ever watched
an American president thought to myself 

2851
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:46,830
I could have done better in that 
situation.

2852
02:14:48,050 --> 02:14:50,460
And there's presidents,
I've had nothing but disagree with,

2853
02:14:50,461 --> 02:14:53,550
but they were way better for the job 
than I ever could be.

2854
02:14:54,270 --> 02:14:56,190
I look at this guy and be like,
man,

2855
02:14:56,191 --> 02:15:00,380
you just got played and there's 
something out.

2856
02:15:00,600 --> 02:15:02,250
When I knew I was going to be talking to
you,

2857
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:05,490
there's a thing I was thinking about,
um,

2858
02:15:05,670 --> 02:15:06,503
because I,
I,

2859
02:15:06,510 --> 02:15:11,460
I heard you speak many years ago about 
these politicians are gangster.

2860
02:15:11,461 --> 02:15:12,294
He said like,
okay,

2861
02:15:12,360 --> 02:15:13,193
what that guy did that's Gangsta and 
what this guy just did straight up 

2862
02:15:16,520 --> 02:15:18,660
gangsters during the Bush 
administration.

2863
02:15:18,660 --> 02:15:20,730
You are just,
I think it was like Halliburton,

2864
02:15:20,731 --> 02:15:23,250
all these people that change the world 
and you're like,

2865
02:15:23,340 --> 02:15:25,580
that's a gangster move.
That's a gangster movie.

2866
02:15:25,581 --> 02:15:26,414
I'm like,
I can't disagree with anything he just 

2867
02:15:27,331 --> 02:15:30,090
said.
And on that kind of level,

2868
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:35,600
I think what I hear is that Donald trump
is a guy who gets consistently played,

2869
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:40,650
rolled,
got rolled by his wife,

2870
02:15:40,920 --> 02:15:41,753
who a woman I have nothing against,
but she comes from a really tough part 

2871
02:15:44,881 --> 02:15:45,714
of the world,
Slovenia as just a rough patch or real 

2872
02:15:47,851 --> 02:15:49,230
estate.
She's smart,

2873
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:52,110
she's tough.
And she got out cut to America.

2874
02:15:52,590 --> 02:15:54,330
Well,
he's not much on looks,

2875
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:59,750
but it's a way in from the storm.
So he got played by his wife.

2876
02:16:00,540 --> 02:16:04,910
He got played by Paul Manafort.
He got played by Kim Jong Un.

2877
02:16:05,490 --> 02:16:06,323
He got played like Jimi Hendrix at 
Monterrey that that particular 

2878
02:16:11,670 --> 02:16:16,670
stratocaster by Vladimir Putin and gets 
played like rock modern off every single

2879
02:16:18,451 --> 02:16:19,284
day.

2880
02:16:19,740 --> 02:16:24,410
And anyone he does high stakes business 
with negotiations.

2881
02:16:24,540 --> 02:16:29,540
He gets played,
played and and Manafort just used him to

2882
02:16:29,681 --> 02:16:33,640
try and get out of debt and all these 
other people,

2883
02:16:33,641 --> 02:16:38,641
they just roll all over him.
And unfortunately his Hubris is such.

2884
02:16:39,490 --> 02:16:40,570
He's like,
ha ha,

2885
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:45,310
like no dude.
You just got blown out and like everyone

2886
02:16:45,311 --> 02:16:46,144
around you is playing you.
We probably doesn't feel that way with 

2887
02:16:48,161 --> 02:16:51,640
manafort because manafort's on trial and
he's not yet right,

2888
02:16:51,641 --> 02:16:52,474
but manafort playdom [inaudible] 
manafort really does play in that world 

2889
02:16:56,141 --> 02:16:58,930
of oligarchs and millions of dollars in 
laundering money.

2890
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:00,543
If he wrote a book I was telling someone
the other day as I have all these 

2891
02:17:02,801 --> 02:17:03,634
people,
he should write the book because it 

2892
02:17:04,541 --> 02:17:06,820
would be a page turner if he told the 
truth,

2893
02:17:06,821 --> 02:17:07,654
would get him killed.
He touched the wrong door knob and he 

2894
02:17:10,980 --> 02:17:14,890
gets poisoned because Putin can't have 
him telling what he knows.

2895
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:18,310
He's a man that he probably will go to 
prison.

2896
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:21,010
Watch him have some kind of strange 
accident.

2897
02:17:23,650 --> 02:17:26,860
He was liquefied in the shower.
Something about the water.

2898
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:29,800
Um,
because he knows a lot and there's a lot

2899
02:17:29,801 --> 02:17:32,560
of people who can pay a lot of money to 
keep his mouth shut.

2900
02:17:33,240 --> 02:17:33,611
Yeah.
Well,

2901
02:17:33,611 --> 02:17:36,880
you know what's fascinating to me is 
that over the last year too,

2902
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:41,920
especially from the Fox crew,
you're seeing Vladimir Putin admired.

2903
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:45,880
It's very strange.
I never thought we would see that.

2904
02:17:45,910 --> 02:17:50,910
I was watching a something a couple of 
years ago,

2905
02:17:50,970 --> 02:17:52,600
a year ago,
and I was like,

2906
02:17:52,601 --> 02:17:53,530
some guy,
well,

2907
02:17:53,531 --> 02:17:55,930
he's a good Christian man,
and he believes in family.

2908
02:17:55,931 --> 02:17:58,090
I'm like,
he's the butcher of Chechnya.

2909
02:17:59,290 --> 02:18:00,123
Let's flash back to the 19 sixties.
I'm a young boy on the weekend visit 

2910
02:18:03,131 --> 02:18:06,340
with my father to the right of my father
is a wall.

2911
02:18:06,400 --> 02:18:07,900
There's nothing to the right of my 
father.

2912
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:09,970
Just nothing.
And um,

2913
02:18:09,971 --> 02:18:10,804
if he's still with us,
he'd be in his nineties and hard as a 

2914
02:18:13,451 --> 02:18:15,310
rock,
just like nothing.

2915
02:18:15,790 --> 02:18:19,060
He's like a bar of Hickory.
Anyway.

2916
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:21,250
Um,
he's an economist.

2917
02:18:21,310 --> 02:18:23,770
He's a numbers guy and a phd.
Real smart.

2918
02:18:24,430 --> 02:18:28,690
I'm coming home to my mom's apartment 
from the Saturday,

2919
02:18:28,690 --> 02:18:31,600
Sunday visit with dad.
We're in the Washington DC area.

2920
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:34,030
I'm a little boy,
five years old,

2921
02:18:34,150 --> 02:18:38,170
somewhere around there.
Very small economist and Communist.

2922
02:18:38,290 --> 02:18:41,610
I don't know what either of them are 
arguably to a five year old.

2923
02:18:41,820 --> 02:18:46,820
Kind of sounds the same.
I'm in the big buick station wagon to my

2924
02:18:46,901 --> 02:18:49,780
father's right.
We're pulling up to mom's apartment.

2925
02:18:50,530 --> 02:18:53,590
Henri Dad,
are you a communist?

2926
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:57,970
I don't think my father's facial 
expression changed.

2927
02:18:58,570 --> 02:19:03,570
His right hand came off the wheel and 
his backhand collided with my head.

2928
02:19:05,260 --> 02:19:07,210
It was just like,
I hear the word Communist,

2929
02:19:07,420 --> 02:19:11,650
a boy get smacked and it was without 
hatred or violence.

2930
02:19:11,740 --> 02:19:14,890
It was like national security,
like whack.

2931
02:19:14,920 --> 02:19:17,680
He didn't even know he did it.
It was like a sneeze,

2932
02:19:18,100 --> 02:19:20,560
like Kapow and it hurts so much.

2933
02:19:20,560 --> 02:19:24,970
My head went numb and it was not even 
the pain.

2934
02:19:24,971 --> 02:19:27,450
It was the shock of,
uh,

2935
02:19:27,670 --> 02:19:28,503
your dad whacking you with,
you had no idea what you did and all I 

2936
02:19:32,991 --> 02:19:33,824
could do was hyperventilate.
And he opened the door and he let me 

2937
02:19:37,281 --> 02:19:38,960
out.
He didn't say a word.

2938
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:39,853
He didn't tell you that there's a 
difference between a communist and an 

2939
02:19:41,811 --> 02:19:45,170
economist.
So I left for like,

2940
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:46,770
till I was like 33,
you know,

2941
02:19:47,440 --> 02:19:51,290
you know what I mean?
Cause it's so destabilizing.

2942
02:19:51,291 --> 02:19:55,340
Like your dad just walloped you and I 
get out of the elevator.

2943
02:19:55,341 --> 02:19:59,660
I go into the apartment,
but I did that till I was like,

2944
02:19:59,661 --> 02:20:02,420
you know,
until two years ago it was totally.

2945
02:20:02,810 --> 02:20:03,591
She said,
honey,

2946
02:20:03,591 --> 02:20:05,000
what happened?
I said,

2947
02:20:05,001 --> 02:20:06,740
I asked dad if he was a commerce.
She's like,

2948
02:20:06,750 --> 02:20:09,710
okay.
The point I'm making is this,

2949
02:20:10,520 --> 02:20:12,680
there's a bunch of people who voted for 
trump.

2950
02:20:13,070 --> 02:20:17,930
Were you say Russia.
They say a bunch of sons of bitches.

2951
02:20:17,931 --> 02:20:20,210
Trust them as far as you can throw your 
car.

2952
02:20:20,390 --> 02:20:21,223
Are you kidding?
And when I see staunch conservative 

2953
02:20:24,141 --> 02:20:25,250
Republicans is going,
well,

2954
02:20:25,251 --> 02:20:26,390
that Burton guy,
I'm like,

2955
02:20:27,170 --> 02:20:31,700
are you kidding people like,
my dad's heads are exploding.

2956
02:20:31,701 --> 02:20:36,701
He's an old Cold War Guy.
We would wash a Boris and Natasha,

2957
02:20:36,711 --> 02:20:38,960
whatever that cartoon was as a Winco.
Yeah,

2958
02:20:38,961 --> 02:20:41,630
as a kid,
I'm laughing because the guy with,

2959
02:20:41,650 --> 02:20:44,270
uh,
my dad's laughing on a whole other level

2960
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:48,260
because it's Cold War funnies.
It's was written for the parents.

2961
02:20:48,590 --> 02:20:52,300
The kids get the cartoon.
The parents got the jokes that,

2962
02:20:52,301 --> 02:20:54,980
that was for adults with their kids on 
Saturday.

2963
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:56,960
You watch them later on,
you're like,

2964
02:20:56,990 --> 02:20:58,580
oh,
this is cold war humor.

2965
02:20:58,970 --> 02:21:01,340
I wouldn't have known,
but that's my dad's world.

2966
02:21:01,610 --> 02:21:02,443
You say Russia,
he'd probably hate my guts because I've 

2967
02:21:04,140 --> 02:21:08,360
been there six times for shows and to 
take the Trans Siberian express.

2968
02:21:08,840 --> 02:21:13,840
And so this warming up to a guy who is a
true bad guy,

2969
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:18,980
he's scary.
There's bodies buried because of him.

2970
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:22,640
He's one of the scariest cars on the 
planet in and capably violent.

2971
02:21:22,641 --> 02:21:25,970
And we'll have you taken out.
I mean like an a political sky.

2972
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:27,650
One of the greatest journalists of our 
time.

2973
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:31,850
She was critical of Putin and she got 
assassinated in your apartment building.

2974
02:21:31,851 --> 02:21:34,040
Her books are great.
Her books from Chechnya are amazing.

2975
02:21:34,640 --> 02:21:35,473
And like he was,
she was critical of him and she had to 

2976
02:21:37,401 --> 02:21:38,234
go.
And when you see our president cozying 

2977
02:21:40,131 --> 02:21:41,930
up to this guy,
I just want to go,

2978
02:21:42,590 --> 02:21:44,150
bro.
Let's talk.

2979
02:21:44,480 --> 02:21:46,700
Let's take a walk in the garden for 20 
minutes.

2980
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:49,810
You can't be friends with this guy.
My theory is he,

2981
02:21:50,410 --> 02:21:51,230
there,
there,

2982
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:52,790
there's,
there's some kind of finances.

2983
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:53,953
Whereas he's got a stick up for him.
I don't think it's a tape of people 

2984
02:21:57,081 --> 02:21:58,160
urinating on anyone.

2985
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,590
I think it says money too cliche to 
interesting.

2986
02:22:00,830 --> 02:22:01,830
Um,
it,

2987
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:02,600
it,
it's,

2988
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:03,860
it's a,
it's a money thing.

2989
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:06,380
It's a hotel deal.
It's money sitting in Cyprus.

2990
02:22:06,381 --> 02:22:07,214
It's something.
But the fact that we're being becoming 

2991
02:22:10,700 --> 02:22:11,533
okay with this guy,
that is the part that bugs me the most 

2992
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:17,083
and why people in Congress or guy like 
Sean Hannity who like probably likes 

2993
02:22:21,561 --> 02:22:26,561
Communist as much as my dad even me.
I trust people like that at all.

2994
02:22:28,230 --> 02:22:31,470
Putin is a criminal.
Should be in jail for a million,

2995
02:22:31,471 --> 02:22:33,600
billion years.
And the fact like,

2996
02:22:33,601 --> 02:22:36,180
Hey,
he's like when he's a strong leader,

2997
02:22:36,290 --> 02:22:37,160
he,
he,

2998
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:38,850
he's a,
he's a human being.

2999
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,240
We can talk like,
gosh,

3000
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:44,730
he's a kgb guy who and there's no such 
thing as next KGB guy,

3001
02:22:44,820 --> 02:22:45,690
right?
Yeah.

3002
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:47,490
Gb for life,
for life.

3003
02:22:47,730 --> 02:22:50,880
And he's a supreme operative.
And what he does is he,

3004
02:22:50,910 --> 02:22:52,950
he rolls people like you dude.

3005
02:22:53,250 --> 02:22:56,160
And like cut you are a guppy.
He's a shark.

3006
02:22:56,820 --> 02:22:57,653
Like uh,
no.

3007
02:22:57,690 --> 02:22:58,523
Two guys hanging out.
No one guy getting played in one guy 

3008
02:23:00,811 --> 02:23:03,620
playing someone.
I think he admires the fact that Putin's

3009
02:23:03,630 --> 02:23:05,760
able to run his country the way he does 
too.

3010
02:23:05,820 --> 02:23:06,653
Yes.
And that's why he likes to tear Tay and 

3011
02:23:08,070 --> 02:23:09,840
wound.
And I've been tested.

3012
02:23:09,841 --> 02:23:10,650
We said about,
Ooh.

3013
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:12,420
He said he's a strong head.
And I was.

3014
02:23:13,370 --> 02:23:14,760
Countries,
I've been to the Philippines,

3015
02:23:14,761 --> 02:23:18,660
I've been to North Korea,
they're tough places to live and like,

3016
02:23:18,661 --> 02:23:20,700
you don't want your country looking like
those places.

3017
02:23:20,701 --> 02:23:21,534
You don't want America to be like Russia
if the economy is destroyed and there's 

3018
02:23:26,551 --> 02:23:29,490
a lot of people like in the wintertime,
it's really tough.

3019
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:31,770
How do you think the scene is the scene?
He goes to jail?

3020
02:23:31,950 --> 02:23:33,550
No,
no,

3021
02:23:34,210 --> 02:23:37,890
because I don't believe in Karma.
Karma.

3022
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:39,810
Here's my two words that disproved 
Karma.

3023
02:23:40,110 --> 02:23:43,920
Dick Cheney,
he's got a new heart and a new heart.

3024
02:23:44,160 --> 02:23:45,750
He has no pulse,
which is perfectly.

3025
02:23:45,751 --> 02:23:48,240
He's got a pulse now with the new heart 
machine.

3026
02:23:48,250 --> 02:23:49,230
Yeah.
Machine.

3027
02:23:49,231 --> 02:23:52,800
And he just heard a wash,
which is perfect for him.

3028
02:23:54,200 --> 02:23:57,150
He may very well live because he looked 
like he's watching his weight now.

3029
02:23:57,180 --> 02:24:00,300
He's like looking lean.
He might live to be 105.

3030
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:03,330
Um,
and so he'll never go to jail.

3031
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:05,640
And like how many millions does he make 
a year?

3032
02:24:05,641 --> 02:24:07,500
Just from his dividends,
from whatever.

3033
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,420
Like who knows what you do with that 
kind of money?

3034
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:13,080
I don't know what you do with it.
And so I don't think he goes to jail.

3035
02:24:13,170 --> 02:24:14,910
I don't think jared cushner goes to 
jail.

3036
02:24:15,450 --> 02:24:18,480
I think it most,
they leave like maybe next year.

3037
02:24:18,481 --> 02:24:19,314
And they go like,
I drained the swamp I did when I came 

3038
02:24:21,031 --> 02:24:21,864
here to do.
And the fake news media brought me down 

3039
02:24:23,970 --> 02:24:26,610
and all his people buy one of 
everything.

3040
02:24:26,610 --> 02:24:27,443
He makes forever stake vodka.
I think it's possible that Donald Trump 

3041
02:24:29,971 --> 02:24:32,760
jr goes to jail.
It's very possible they're talking about

3042
02:24:32,761 --> 02:24:36,210
perjury charges against him now because 
his own dad admitted on twitter.

3043
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:38,033
I follow all that stuff as you know.
I just don't think white collar guys go 

3044
02:24:41,371 --> 02:24:43,470
to prison for stuff.
I just don't believe it.

3045
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:46,170
You know,
I just don't believe it.

3046
02:24:46,380 --> 02:24:49,410
I want to be proven wrong,
but I don't have all the facts.

3047
02:24:49,470 --> 02:24:50,790
I'm a,
I'm a news watcher.

3048
02:24:50,791 --> 02:24:51,624
I know nothing.
I don't get any classified briefs so I 

3049
02:24:53,971 --> 02:24:57,180
only know what I read and what I.
He talk about any of this stuff and your

3050
02:24:57,181 --> 02:25:00,510
stage act a little bit.
But knowing my audience,

3051
02:25:00,511 --> 02:25:05,511
they're very sharp and they read the 
readers and they don't need me repeating

3052
02:25:06,180 --> 02:25:08,460
what they know.
And so,

3053
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:09,540
well,
good for you for that.

3054
02:25:09,570 --> 02:25:10,403
If I make a point as my dad used to say,
you want to score hidden where they 

3055
02:25:14,191 --> 02:25:16,410
ain't the baseball idea.

3056
02:25:16,710 --> 02:25:17,543
And so if I can make a point,
like if I was on stage tonight talking 

3057
02:25:20,731 --> 02:25:23,680
about trump,
I would roll out that idea of trump is a

3058
02:25:23,681 --> 02:25:24,514
guy who's been played by so many people 
around him and no one talks about his 

3059
02:25:27,791 --> 02:25:30,280
wife playing him.
Like there's no love in that marriage.

3060
02:25:30,281 --> 02:25:34,150
I don't think she saw a way out.
Came to New York and went,

3061
02:25:34,240 --> 02:25:38,080
that guy gets naked with the toad a few 
nights a month,

3062
02:25:39,070 --> 02:25:43,960
a handful of Prozac,
some Stoli and a credit card and a seven

3063
02:25:43,961 --> 02:25:44,794
figure expense account.
You can take a shower and make it go 

3064
02:25:48,251 --> 02:25:49,600
away.
Um,

3065
02:25:49,780 --> 02:25:51,010
so I,
I think he,

3066
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:53,080
and I think he kinda knows that,
you know,

3067
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:54,640
she was not like,
wow,

3068
02:25:54,641 --> 02:25:56,110
what a hot gosh.
She's like,

3069
02:25:56,111 --> 02:25:57,250
Hey,
and this,

3070
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:58,630
you know,
that happens a lot in this town.

3071
02:25:58,840 --> 02:26:01,660
You'll see that yield the couple.
And you're like,

3072
02:26:01,700 --> 02:26:02,500
okay.

3073
02:26:02,500 --> 02:26:03,333
Yeah,
right.

3074
02:26:04,300 --> 02:26:06,340
Harvey Weinstein,
before his,

3075
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:08,020
uh,
for his wife left him.

3076
02:26:08,380 --> 02:26:11,500
Harvey Weinstein's wife is beautiful.
Well,

3077
02:26:11,580 --> 02:26:12,413
yeah,
but you see that a lot in this town 

3078
02:26:13,421 --> 02:26:16,990
where you see the,
the old weird dude with like the,

3079
02:26:17,030 --> 02:26:19,330
the eight year old girlfriend.
You're like,

3080
02:26:19,360 --> 02:26:20,260
oh yeah,
that's a,

3081
02:26:20,261 --> 02:26:21,880
that's a setup.
That's an agency.

3082
02:26:21,910 --> 02:26:22,743
That's an agreement.
That's someone's getting a salary or an 

3083
02:26:25,511 --> 02:26:26,800
implied,
you know,

3084
02:26:26,801 --> 02:26:27,341
it's,
it's,

3085
02:26:27,341 --> 02:26:29,200
uh,
there's some kind of quid pro quo.

3086
02:26:29,201 --> 02:26:30,034
There's a credit card,
there's an expense account or there's 

3087
02:26:31,841 --> 02:26:35,380
just a,
a big fist full of hundreds and just let

3088
02:26:35,381 --> 02:26:40,381
me chew on you for the next four weeks 
or whatever the agreement is.

3089
02:26:40,590 --> 02:26:42,040
And,
and I.

3090
02:26:42,040 --> 02:26:47,000
So if I was going to say anything about 
Donald Trump on stage with Alex and I,

3091
02:26:47,290 --> 02:26:49,390
I never talked about any problem 
onstage.

3092
02:26:49,420 --> 02:26:52,240
And I learned this from,
of all people President Clinton,

3093
02:26:52,780 --> 02:26:53,613
because some of his later has 
post-presidency I'm not a huge fan of 

3094
02:26:55,841 --> 02:26:57,520
the guy,
but he's a good speaker.

3095
02:26:57,850 --> 02:26:58,683
And he did some speeches in the UK a few
years ago and I happened to be in in 

3096
02:27:01,911 --> 02:27:05,470
England when he was there and I watched 
him on tv the last part of this huge,

3097
02:27:05,471 --> 02:27:07,960
the last 10 minutes was here's a problem
and here's three solutions.

3098
02:27:07,961 --> 02:27:08,794
Here's another problem here.
Three solutions were like for for 

3099
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:14,830
$60,000,000 we could put Internet 
through this thing or we could open this

3100
02:27:14,831 --> 02:27:19,831
waterway or we could reconfigure this 
workforce to upgrade so everyone can get

3101
02:27:19,871 --> 02:27:22,870
a paycheck.
He just had logical ways forward.

3102
02:27:23,500 --> 02:27:25,990
So what I took from that is to my 
audience,

3103
02:27:25,991 --> 02:27:27,970
don't propose a problem.
Will he sucks.

3104
02:27:27,971 --> 02:27:29,030
Thanks.
Good night.

3105
02:27:29,560 --> 02:27:32,250
Don't give them a Gordian knot unless 
you can go.

3106
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:33,123
Actually it's not a Gordian knot.
Here's three ways to get out of this 

3107
02:27:36,131 --> 02:27:36,964
burning rec.
And so like when when trump became 

3108
02:27:39,851 --> 02:27:40,601
elected,
it was,

3109
02:27:40,601 --> 02:27:41,434
I was on tour,
I was doing a bunch of nights in La and 

3110
02:27:43,900 --> 02:27:44,351
I said,
okay,

3111
02:27:44,351 --> 02:27:46,480
you have a new president and some of you
are depressed.

3112
02:27:47,020 --> 02:27:47,853
I said,
I know.

3113
02:27:48,070 --> 02:27:51,610
And so gay people are on the endangered 
species list.

3114
02:27:51,611 --> 02:27:55,210
It's as if they've never been brown 
people,

3115
02:27:55,240 --> 02:27:56,410
black people,
women,

3116
02:27:56,411 --> 02:27:57,760
people,
people with ovaries,

3117
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:01,360
these were all on the you're screwed 
list.

3118
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:05,020
So instead of being coming depressed and
oh no,

3119
02:28:05,260 --> 02:28:08,590
let's we get up,
we start doing more benefits now.

3120
02:28:08,591 --> 02:28:10,960
All your words matter.
Your actions matter.

3121
02:28:10,990 --> 02:28:14,470
How you stick up for your lgbt friends 
really matters.

3122
02:28:14,471 --> 02:28:16,900
Now,
how you stick up for women,

3123
02:28:17,350 --> 02:28:18,183
how you stick up for racial equality,
equality in the like how you check 

3124
02:28:23,421 --> 02:28:25,850
yourself.
When you rule a view with other people,

3125
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:28,640
words matter,
actions matter more than ever.

3126
02:28:28,880 --> 02:28:29,713
And so to me,
it's an exciting time to show how great 

3127
02:28:32,631 --> 02:28:34,880
you can be because now it's all on the 
line.

3128
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:38,000
The fat is off the land.
We're being tested.

3129
02:28:38,390 --> 02:28:40,580
I love a test,
so let's get it on.

3130
02:28:41,510 --> 02:28:43,790
It's like a in your line of work.
When the guy goes,

3131
02:28:43,791 --> 02:28:46,640
here we go.
That's how I saw it.

3132
02:28:46,910 --> 02:28:47,743
Like,
okay,

3133
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:49,033
let's let's get the money to the ACU.
Let's get some money to planned 

3134
02:28:51,921 --> 02:28:52,754
parenthood.
Let's get a conversation going about a 

3135
02:28:55,340 --> 02:28:58,070
child suicide,
intimidation to facebook.

3136
02:28:58,310 --> 02:29:01,520
Let's start making things better because
this guy is not our ally.

3137
02:29:02,330 --> 02:29:06,350
Governments not necessarily going to 
help at its best.

3138
02:29:06,351 --> 02:29:09,620
It's inactive at its worst.
It's divisive and predatory,

3139
02:29:09,890 --> 02:29:14,890
so let's be the antidote by being cool 
by not throwing rocks through windows or

3140
02:29:15,941 --> 02:29:18,740
like you getting into the Tiki torch and
beating them up.

3141
02:29:18,750 --> 02:29:20,200
Come on,
I'm.

3142
02:29:20,270 --> 02:29:23,090
You're never going to convince that guy 
that he's wrong,

3143
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:24,103
so get to the people you agree with and 
let's start sticking together more and 

3144
02:29:27,351 --> 02:29:28,184
raising more money and get some more 
interesting people in office and let's 

3145
02:29:31,281 --> 02:29:33,920
get some young people in office and I 
think that's what's happening.

3146
02:29:34,190 --> 02:29:36,860
Like you're seeing all these young 
people like twenties,

3147
02:29:36,861 --> 02:29:38,330
thirties.
Sadly,

3148
02:29:38,331 --> 02:29:40,550
there's a bunch of kids who died at a 
high school in Florida,

3149
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:41,833
but look what happened.
Look at all those kids hitting the 

3150
02:29:43,221 --> 02:29:44,054
streets.
Look at all these kids who through cell 

3151
02:29:45,841 --> 02:29:48,350
phones and selfies and instagram and 
snapchat,

3152
02:29:48,650 --> 02:29:49,483
they're already ready for primetime.
You see these high school juniors in 

3153
02:29:53,541 --> 02:29:55,520
front of a CNN camera going,
hi,

3154
02:29:55,640 --> 02:29:58,460
I'm 17 years old.
This happened to my school and next year

3155
02:29:58,461 --> 02:30:01,010
I'm going to vote and here's what's 
going to happen and here's the march.

3156
02:30:01,011 --> 02:30:02,450
I'm starting like,
oh,

3157
02:30:02,510 --> 02:30:04,970
that's a future senator.
You just.

3158
02:30:04,971 --> 02:30:08,510
That school shooting just birthed a 
voting demographic.

3159
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:11,420
Are you kidding?
All those kids are going to vote.

3160
02:30:11,630 --> 02:30:13,610
All of them,
all those kids who marched,

3161
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:14,953
there's going to be no millennial apathy
with those kids that are all going to 

3162
02:30:16,751 --> 02:30:19,340
vote.
I kind of have an idea what side they're

3163
02:30:19,341 --> 02:30:22,970
going to vote with and if you think 
you're going to sell those kids on their

3164
02:30:22,971 --> 02:30:25,640
grandfathers,
drunken homophobia,

3165
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:28,820
racism,
and just overall bigotry and xenophobia,

3166
02:30:29,420 --> 02:30:30,170
you're wrong.

3167
02:30:30,170 --> 02:30:32,060
He never had a password.
I don't need to travel.

3168
02:30:32,061 --> 02:30:34,730
I don't want to meet some damn Mexican.
Trust me,

3169
02:30:34,731 --> 02:30:37,190
the kids going to travel.
He's going to go to India.

3170
02:30:37,460 --> 02:30:42,020
She's going to go to Columbia and meet 
other people and get a more global sense

3171
02:30:42,021 --> 02:30:43,550
of the world.
A sense of water,

3172
02:30:43,551 --> 02:30:45,320
food,
energy,

3173
02:30:45,321 --> 02:30:47,450
where it comes from,
what happens with money,

3174
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:49,760
what happens with mediocrity,
the danger of it.

3175
02:30:50,090 --> 02:30:53,300
So I think we're in for some tough 
times,

3176
02:30:53,390 --> 02:30:56,460
but I think they're going to lead to 
good times and so that's.

3177
02:30:56,690 --> 02:30:59,350
If I get political onstage,
all I say is like,

3178
02:30:59,390 --> 02:31:03,620
here's five ways forward because the 
despair part you like,

3179
02:31:03,621 --> 02:31:06,140
you need me to tell you,
you watch the news,

3180
02:31:06,380 --> 02:31:10,320
so don't get down in the mouth,
start burning more calories and that and

3181
02:31:10,330 --> 02:31:11,163
that's not my job,
but I would never weigh in on stage any 

3182
02:31:17,690 --> 02:31:20,550
other way about that stuff because all I
would be as obvious

3183
02:31:20,970 --> 02:31:24,780
and my audience is pretty sharp and they
don't need to be told twice.

3184
02:31:28,170 --> 02:31:29,310
Outstanding.
Thank you sir.

3185
02:31:29,340 --> 02:31:30,870
Well said.
I couldn't agree more.

3186
02:31:31,560 --> 02:31:34,200
Friday night show time,
August 10th.

3187
02:31:34,530 --> 02:31:37,680
Henry motherfucking Rawlins.
Keep talking,

3188
02:31:38,010 --> 02:31:39,600
keep talking.
Keep talking,

3189
02:31:39,601 --> 02:31:40,680
pal.
Thank you sir.

3190
02:31:40,710 --> 02:31:42,060
Thank you sir.
I really appreciate it.

3191
02:31:42,260 --> 02:31:45,410
That's great.
