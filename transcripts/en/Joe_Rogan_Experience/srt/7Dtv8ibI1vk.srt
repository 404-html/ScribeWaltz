1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,393
Alright,
here we go.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,860
Four,
three,

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,670
two.
Hello Bill.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,930
Hi,
what's going on man?

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:12,360
I am very excited to be here.
I'm excited to have you here.

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,280
Excellent.
The social leap.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,780
Yes.
What's the social leap?

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,090
I'll tell you all about it.
Please do.

9
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,020
Okay.
So,

10
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:19,854
um,
the story that I want to tell is 

11
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,730
basically how we got here,
how are we became human?

12
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,133
And so that story begins about six or 7 
million years ago when our ancestors 

13
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,474
left the rain forest.
And so the question is why would they 

14
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,400
leave and how would they survive once 
they left?

15
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,990
And,
and that's what the social leap.

16
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,570
So it takes a second to get it all out 
there.

17
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,840
Okay.
Yeah.

18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:42,480
Right.
So here's the story.

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,960
So if you look back about 7 million 
years,

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,093
our ancestors and chimps,
we had a common ancestor at about that 

21
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51,450
point in time six or 7 million years 
ago,

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,793
and that common ancestor,
we don't know exactly what it looked 

23
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,550
like,
but it was from all we can tell,

24
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:59,580
it was awfully close to today's chimps 
and so there,

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,503
if you look at chimps today,
you can get a pretty good sense of what 

26
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,820
life was like then.

27
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,330
And chimps today are really interesting.
They're basically at the top of the food

28
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:10,580
chain in the rain forest there,
super fast up in the trees,

29
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:13,250
super athletic,
and they.

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,260
Because they travel in groups,
even amazing tree climbers like leopards

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,620
won't try to attack them in trees.
It's just they're too dangerous,

32
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,454
too fast.
But if you look at a chimp on the 

33
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,130
ground,
it can't even lock.

34
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:25,580
It's nice.
It's kind of cute little stumbling along

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,423
thing.
And then the question is why would an 

36
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,734
animal that runs the show in the canopy 
leave the rain forest for the Savannah 

37
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:34,680
and then how it survived.
Once I did that and that's.

38
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,643
That's the story of this book.
And then how that manifests itself to 

39
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,830
where we are today.
So really my goal,

40
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:41,664
I'm a psychologist,
I want to understand why we are the way 

41
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:45,990
we are.
And so in trying to figure that out,

42
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:46,381
I said,
well,

43
00:01:46,381 --> 00:01:47,214
let's take a look back all the way to 
our common ancestors and seed some of 

44
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,460
the key events and how they might've had
an influence on how we are today.

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,940
So the first question is why would we 
leave the trees right here we are,

46
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,570
we're dominant position where we're food
on the ground.

47
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,404
Why would we ever take that risk?
And the basic story there is the great 

48
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,454
African Rift Valley,
I'm not sure if you're familiar with 

49
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:07,914
that at all,
but basically it runs down from up at 

50
00:02:10,321 --> 00:02:12,630
the Red Sea down to the coast of 
Mozambique.

51
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,090
And you can think of it like a 
geographic zipper.

52
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,373
You know,
all the world's sits on these tectonic 

53
00:02:17,311 --> 00:02:20,010
plates and sometimes they crash into 
each other like,

54
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:20,844
uh,
how Indians smashing into Asia and 

55
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:22,944
creates amylase.
Sometimes they literally tear apart and 

56
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,840
Africa's tearing apart at the great 
African Rift Valley.

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,150
So that plate that has Somalia and 
Ethiopia,

58
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:31,230
Tanzania,
Kenya,

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,423
that's moving off to the lower right,
the rest of Africa is moving off to the 

60
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:40,101
upper left and I got no idea why it's 
been going on for quite a while,

61
00:02:40,381 --> 00:02:41,214
but one of the consequences that is that
the east Africa starting to rise up 

62
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:44,964
slowly bit by bit and when it rises up,
the rainforest dry out and so basically 

63
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:50,334
what you have is a situation where our 
ancestors were on the east side of that 

64
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,903
Rift Valley and it started to dry out 
and now they're in a situation where 

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,040
they've got this great lifestyle,
their dominant position,

66
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,060
but now they're pushed.

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,893
They're forced out onto the ground 
increasingly more and more because 

68
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:05,260
there's more and more ground and less 
and less rain forest.

69
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,423
And so how do they survive that?
What do they do in order to make that 

70
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,010
work?
And this is a what,

71
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:14,560
what period of time is this?
How many millions of years ago,

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,450
six or seven,
six or seven.

73
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,493
Does this coincide with the when?
When was the jump of the human brain 

74
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,534
size?
We're doubling.

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,533
We'll get to that.
So it's a super interesting question 

76
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,954
about why that happened as well.
So basically if you track us across the 

77
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:29,314
next 3 million years,
how did our ancestors survive when 

78
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:32,554
they're basically chimpanzees on the 
open savannah and you can get a hint of 

79
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:36,814
how they did it because there's one 
chimpanzee group that does live on the 

80
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:39,544
Savannah in Senegal and they,
they show some differences between 

81
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,060
themselves and other chimps that 
traveling slightly larger groups.

82
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,180
They share more nicely with each other,
which is interesting.

83
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,570
That's kind of a human trait as well.
And uh,

84
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,483
they also avoid open space,
like they're just kind trying to stay 

85
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,190
near the trees as much as possible.
And so,

86
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,920
and if you look at other eight,
they're not aids,

87
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:02,050
but other primates that are on the 
Savannah,

88
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,190
Savannah,
baboons,

89
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,024
they're only monkey,
so they're not as sharp as chimpanzees 

90
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,600
are,
but they have a similar strategy,

91
00:04:07,601 --> 00:04:08,434
large groups to try to protect 
themselves and lots of eyes to look out 

92
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,180
for predators.
And they do fine on the savannah.

93
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,020
And so what I suspect happened is for 
the first few million years,

94
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,063
basically what you've got is this chimp 
like animal that's kind of skirting the 

95
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,904
edges of Savannah,
nowhere near the top dominant position 

96
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:25,930
they used to be and just kind of 
noodling around.

97
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,790
And that takes,
I suspect,

98
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,610
that takes us for about the first three,
three and a half million years.

99
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,050
And if you look at who we are,
then we're Australopithecus afarensis.

100
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,030
So it's,
if you looked at one of them,

101
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,330
you'd think it belongs in a zoo.
It looks almost like a chimpanzee.

102
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,710
And so a chimp brain and answer the 
first part of your question is about 380

103
00:04:44,711 --> 00:04:45,544
grams.
And australopithecines brain is about 

104
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,514
450 grams.
So 3 million years of evolution and all 

105
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:55,360
we've got four to 70 grams.
So why do we get so smart?

106
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:57,430
Why do we take off in the next few 
million years?

107
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,740
And what is it that Australopithecus did
that,

108
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,440
that helped us survive?
And why do I call that the social late?

109
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,303
That's all kind of tied together.
And the basic story is it by this point 

110
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,620
Australopithecus has become bipedal and 
we can talk about how that happened,

111
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:14,050
if you'd like.
And so because they're bipedal,

112
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,840
their waste is now stretched out their,
um,

113
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,770
their musculature.

114
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,190
Like if you look at Chimpanzee Pecs,
they aim upward because of course chimps

115
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:22,024
climbing all the time.
I'm Australopithecus is more lateral 

116
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,144
like we are.
We're basically completely lateral 

117
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,050
because things are side to side as far 
as we're concerned.

118
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,123
It's harder to climb a tree,
but it's a whole lot easier to do a lot 

119
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,630
of other things.
And um,

120
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,500
we have much more limber shoulder,
we have much more limber wrist,

121
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,343
all that sort of thing.
And a lot of that was in place by 

122
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,320
Australopithecus.
So once they became bipedal,

123
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,363
they gained a lot of these qualities.
And then the question is why do those 

124
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,150
qualities matter?
Well,

125
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,820
the,
if you watch a chimpanzee throw,

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,833
it's terrible at it,
even though they're stronger than you 

127
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:56,200
and I are pound for pound by a sizable 
margin.

128
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,760
When they throw their inept,
they can't aim very well.

129
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:02,390
And they typically use two hands because
they're not lined up well to throw.

130
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,380
If you watch a really good thrower,
like a grid iron football player,

131
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,180
a baseball player,
or a hunter gatherer throw,

132
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,060
you know it's a full body motion to step
forward with the other leg.

133
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,300
There's this rotation and the very last 
minute you bring your risks through.

134
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:18,920
Well what that does is it creates an 
enormous amount of elastic energy across

135
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,450
your muscles,
tendons and ligaments.

136
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,140
And the end of that throw for a human is
like the snapping of a rubber band.

137
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,100
So chimps can't do that.
They're not lined up properly.

138
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,060
But australopithecus got to the point 
where they could probably do that pretty

139
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,070
well.
And so now,

140
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,373
and this purely a byproduct to 
bipedalism because it's stretched out 

141
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,270
their whole body and they don't,
they're not climbing as much anymore.

142
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,113
So their musculature is more lateral,
which would have been helped them for 

143
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:44,294
throwing.
So now you get to a point where they 

144
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:49,580
have access to the single most important
military intervention in history,

145
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:52,160
which is the capacity to kill it a 
distance.

146
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,593
So if you and I are running around the 
savannah and lion attacks us and we got 

147
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:58,790
50 of our best friends,
we could kill it with our bare hands,

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,770
but a lot of us are going to die in the 
process,

149
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,753
right?
Because you think 50 of us can get 100 

150
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,193
that someone think even though it was 
with a bunch of Nice and shy and I'd be 

151
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,790
super confident where other people you 
wouldn't worry very much but.

152
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,920
But even if we could.
So we knew what we're doing.

153
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,450
We're all armed with knives,
whoever,

154
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:22,160
whoever goes first screwed right.
And so the capacity to kill the distance

155
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:22,994
that will allows a larger force of 
weaker individuals to come to easily 

156
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:30,200
defeat a stronger individual.
And so once they gained this capacity to

157
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,034
throw,
if they were attacked by lions or 

158
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,014
something like that,
whereas in the past they just scattered 

159
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,204
for the trees.

160
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:38,070
Now they could throw stones at it and 
defend themselves now.

161
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,750
And australopithecus throwing rocks at 
alliant is going to be in the belly of a

162
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:43,700
slightly annoyed line in about three 
minutes.

163
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:46,940
Right?
But 50 australopithecines throwing rocks

164
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:50,410
at Lyons is a totally different story 
and so it's the.

165
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,910
This is the idea,
here is the throwing hypothesis there,

166
00:07:52,911 --> 00:07:53,930
what,
what changed?

167
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,764
Everything was throwing and the reason 
it changed everything is that it caused 

168
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,364
us.
It was the first reason why we should 

169
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:00,914
have any effective collective action 
because it's not a good strategy when 

170
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:04,364
you're on your own.
It's not a good strategy if I do it in 

171
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,150
the rest of the group hits heads for the
trees,

172
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,820
but it's a great strategy if we all do 
it together.

173
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,320
And so for the first time in history,
the group's goals in our history,

174
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:16,610
in our line,
the primate line,

175
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,130
the group's goals aligned with the 
individual goals,

176
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:19,964
which is let's cooperate and work 
together to try to drive away these 

177
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,233
predators.

178
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,213
Now it,
if you look at a lion and you look at 

179
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:29,900
someone throwing rocks,
it still seems like a really big ask,

180
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:32,150
right?
To drive that thing away or kill it,

181
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,920
throwing rocks.
And so.

182
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,293
But Barbara Isaac was one of the first 
anthropologist to propose this 

183
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,354
hypothesis quite awhile ago.
Went Back and looked through the 

184
00:08:39,921 --> 00:08:40,754
historical record and these 
extraordinary stories of how effective 

185
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:44,264
people are throwing rocks and so in,
when the Portuguese went to the Canary 

186
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:50,420
Islands to try to subjugate it,
they rock up with,

187
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,280
you know,
armor guns,

188
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,203
uh,
crossbows and this isn't the 14 

189
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:56,190
something

190
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,023
and all the locals were on with,
with stones and despite the fact that 

191
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,710
the Portuguese are there in army 
trained,

192
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,180
you know,
ready to shoot and,

193
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,093
and in their armor they were just 
decimated by the local stone rock 

194
00:09:06,321 --> 00:09:07,154
center.
And the stories happened over and over 

195
00:09:08,551 --> 00:09:09,960
again.
And when you read these accounts,

196
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,330
they're extraordinary.
I can read you some examples from here.

197
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,880
They just,
the happened in Australia,

198
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:16,920
it happened in the Canary Islands that 
happened elsewhere.

199
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,050
They just throw rocks incredibly 
accurately,

200
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:22,290
incredibly hard and really fast.
So,

201
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,124
and there's know accounts in Africa 
basically killing a zebra with one blow 

202
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:27,900
of Iraq to the head.

203
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,450
So like a pitcher of major league 
pitcher.

204
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,080
Exactly what rock who gets very accurate
at it.

205
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,960
Yeah.
So do you think they must have practiced

206
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,900
constantly.
And so what I suspect is that we evolved

207
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:45,100
to like to throw rocks and so if I let 
you know,

208
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,160
if I look at my son as a,
for example,

209
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,130
when he was 18 months old,
we will be walking back toward that.

210
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,023
Sophie saw a rock on the street,
he pick it up and started trying to 

211
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:54,390
throw it.
And my wife was like,

212
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:54,661
no,
no,

213
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:56,580
don't let him throw rocks.
It's only going to cause trouble.

214
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,633
First of all I'm thinking,
well maybe I'll develop a good arm so 

215
00:09:58,831 --> 00:09:59,940
I'm going to go ahead and let him 
anyway.

216
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,220
But secondly,
he fricking wants to.

217
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,450
This is something inherently fun for 
him,

218
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,413
right?
And I think all humans enjoy throwing 

219
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:10,530
and it's stunning how good you can get 
it with practice.

220
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,880
So,
um,

221
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,020
we were at the Ohio state fair this 
before my son was born and I was walking

222
00:10:16,021 --> 00:10:19,050
by one of these stalls where you can 
throw in a radar gun.

223
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,153
And so I thought the,
I was just starting to date my wife and 

224
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:22,501
I thought,
oh,

225
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,970
here's a perfect chance to impress her.
Right?

226
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,320
And how,
how much you I am.

227
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,071
So I said,
hey,

228
00:10:26,071 --> 00:10:28,140
why don't I stop and I'll throw some 
balls here and this net,

229
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,210
because I hadn't ever thrown.
I didn't know how fast I could.

230
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,470
So she's like,
sure.

231
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,180
And I was,
I played like literally Greg.

232
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,860
So I throw the ball and it's like 50 
miles an hour and she's pretty impressed

233
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,590
because that's sounds fast,
right?

234
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,590
Then it's like kid shows up next to me,
it's got to be 12 years old,

235
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,603
probably weighs 85 pounds.
This total gangland not a muscle in his 

236
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:47,460
body.

237
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,293
And he just starts to fricking thrown 
ball after ball at like 65 miles an 

238
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,080
hour.
And I'm like fuck,

239
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,093
I mean she's not going to be impressed 
because it's like human twig next to me 

240
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,130
is kicking my ass.
Right?

241
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,940
And so I pick up the last ball,
I fucking throw it as hard as I can,

242
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:02,310
hurts my shoulder,
flies off at an odd angle,

243
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
doesn't hit anything,
and it's like 57 miles an hour.

244
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,870
Now,
that little guy who's like literally the

245
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:07,704
size of the nostril,
pythagoras was thrown at 65 and hitting 

246
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:13,380
the target every time.
And so it's obvious that it's skill,

247
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,120
it's practice that would've made you 
good at this,

248
00:11:15,121 --> 00:11:17,310
and if your life depends on it,
you're going to do it.

249
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,480
Well.
That makes sense.

250
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,703
Coming from a martial arts background,
like coordinated movement where at the 

251
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,660
end of it you snap exactly makes sense 
that this technique is so critical,

252
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:30,723
even though you're a larger person.
So better technique would have more of 

253
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,570
an impact with that.
So the throwing arm,

254
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:39,630
I had read this and if that was one of 
the hypothesis,

255
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,733
several hypothesis,
why the human brain doubled over a 

256
00:11:43,081 --> 00:11:45,810
period of 2 million years.
Another one was cooked meat,

257
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:46,644
right?
They figured out a way to get more 

258
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,120
nutrients out of meat that's writing 
over fire,

259
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,470
right?
So that's a little bit down the road.

260
00:11:52,471 --> 00:11:54,010
So here we are and a half million years 
ago.

261
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,053
And so for the first time we put some 
pressure on ourselves to have an 

262
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,950
advantage to be smarter.
So imagine you're a zebra.

263
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,350
You know what the hell good is it to you
to be Einstein.

264
00:12:02,351 --> 00:12:04,060
You got what are you going to do with 
that brain?

265
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,320
Right?
But it's a big.

266
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,183
It's a big cost.
Our brains are 20 percent of our 

267
00:12:07,931 --> 00:12:10,660
metabolic energy,
whether we're doing math or watching tv,

268
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,430
it's,
it's constant drain.

269
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,370
And so what our ancestors,
why would they pay for that drain?

270
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,930
Now,
just recently,

271
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:20,800
there was a paper that came out maybe 
three months ago now on um,

272
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,443
a new brand expansion gene.
They found it or they think that's what 

273
00:12:24,131 --> 00:12:26,650
it is called notch to an l.
and it turns out,

274
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,521
I don't know,
12,

275
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:28,354
15 million years ago,
there was an accidental duplication of 

276
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,414
that gene on our genome and it,
but it was ineffective and it just sat 

277
00:12:33,431 --> 00:12:34,264
there doing nothing.

278
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,493
Now that's a great way that evolution 
works where it accidentally doubles the 

279
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:39,760
gene because then you don't,
you can mess with it.

280
00:12:39,761 --> 00:12:41,530
And the old jeans still doing the job,
right?

281
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,843
So it sat there for about 9 million 
years in our line till about 3 million 

282
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:47,200
years ago,
round Australopithecus.

283
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,050
And then it duplicated itself and it 
came online again.

284
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,250
And what that gene seems to do is it 
makes our brain remain as stem cells for

285
00:12:54,251 --> 00:12:55,084
longer,
which means a lot more duplication 

286
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,870
before they run away.
And start becoming neurons.

287
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,213
And so if I had to guess,
I'd say that that probably that gene 

288
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,494
coming online probably happened many 
times in the past and every time it 

289
00:13:08,051 --> 00:13:10,240
happened in the past it was more costs 
than it was worth.

290
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,313
And so what's the chimp going to do with
a little bit more brain and just needs 

291
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:14,920
more calories and what does he gain from
it?

292
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,700
But now that we're working together,
now that we have collective action,

293
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,980
all sorts of things open up,
we could,

294
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,290
we could devise division of labor,
I'll say,

295
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,790
hey man,
you do this and I'll do that.

296
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:28,090
Because also the [inaudible],
they've got 70 more grams and a chimp.

297
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,940
They can't do things like that,
but they can all throw rocks at the same

298
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:32,320
time.
That's not rocket science,

299
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,513
but all the kinds of things that came 
next probably were enabled by that 

300
00:13:36,851 --> 00:13:39,970
process of us coming together and 
deciding to work together and cooperate.

301
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,910
So if you look at chimpanzees,
they don't cooperate very well.

302
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,070
Um,
for example,

303
00:13:45,071 --> 00:13:47,890
one of the activities were they sort of 
cooperate is when they hunt monkeys.

304
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,083
And so the law gather around and they'll
see some monkeys in the trees and they 

305
00:13:51,441 --> 00:13:54,070
come in from every angle.
It's not very coordinated.

306
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:55,540
It's kind of a wild free for all.

307
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,300
But what's interesting about it is that 
when the hunts over,

308
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,613
let's say you just sat there the whole 
time and watched and I'm working my ass 

309
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,490
off chasing these monkeys,
I got one.

310
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,400
You come up and bug me for it and I 
don't.

311
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,110
I don't willingly handle it.
You like keep nudging me until I share,

312
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,200
but I'm just as likely to share with you
if you helped as if you didn't.

313
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,243
I don't make any distinction.
And you'll never established effective 

314
00:14:14,591 --> 00:14:17,950
groups if you can't reward those who 
participate compared to those who don't.

315
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,350
Even little kids,
four year old kids.

316
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:23,110
When you give them games to play and 
they earn stickers.

317
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,990
If you didn't play,
you don't.

318
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,440
When you come up and ask,
you don't get it.

319
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,330
You played.
Even if you didn't do your job right,

320
00:14:28,331 --> 00:14:29,110
but you tried,
boom,

321
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,210
you can have a sticker.
So humans immediately get that,

322
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:34,780
that you get rewarded for your 
activities as part of the group.

323
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,630
Chimps don't seem to have that.
That's fascinating because.

324
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:41,860
But because chimps really do have a 
sense of fairness though,

325
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,993
and that,
that's one of the issues that happened 

326
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:48,130
with the captive chimps that attack the 
man who brought the birthday cake.

327
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:49,240
Do you know that story?
I don't know.

328
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:51,810
That's too awful story.
These couple,

329
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,963
they kept a chimp as a pet for a long 
time and then as it got older it got a 

330
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,614
little violent and they had to bring it 
to a sanctuary and they brought it to a 

331
00:15:00,231 --> 00:15:01,064
sanctuary and they would go to visit it 
and the chimp would remember them and 

332
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,910
they went to visit it and it was on his 
birthday.

333
00:15:04,911 --> 00:15:05,744
So they brought him a cake.
And the other chimps in the sanctuary 

334
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,860
were furious that they didn't get the 
cake,

335
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,420
uh,
as well.

336
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,370
They didn't think it was fair or they're
angry.

337
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:17,960
So they figured out somebody had left a 
gate open and they got out and tour this

338
00:15:17,961 --> 00:15:20,630
guy apart because he didn't give them a 
cake.

339
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,533
Yeah.
So there's the most famous example of 

340
00:15:22,961 --> 00:15:24,390
that is actually with capital and 
monkeys,

341
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,224
which aren't nearly as smart as chimps,
and it's this amazing study by Sarah 

342
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,660
Bronfman and Frans de Waal,
and if you want to see it in action,

343
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:33,390
dwell has it on a Ted talk.
It's really quite something to see.

344
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,470
And what they do in that study is a 
teacher these capuchin monkeys to.

345
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,513
They give them pebble and they teach the
captions to return the pebble and they 

346
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:41,784
give it a cucumber slice.
And so it's learning the game for 

347
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,260
cucumber slices.
So if you wanted to ask,

348
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:47,880
does the monkey think that's a fair 
reward?

349
00:15:47,881 --> 00:15:49,090
The answer has to be yes.
Right,

350
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,060
because it's.
It's doing that for cucumber.

351
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,430
So now you and I are.
Both monkeys were in our cage.

352
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,650
I returned the pebble,
I get a cucumber.

353
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:58,830
Now you return the pebble and they hand 
you a great capuchins.

354
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,490
Much prefer grapes over cucumbers.
And so then what happens next?

355
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,473
Well,
I've been doing this behavior for 

356
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,150
cucumbers,
but as soon as you get a great,

357
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:06,691
I'm like,
yeah,

358
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:07,524
I'm not playing anymore.
And you watch this tape and the cabbage 

359
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
in it.
They give you a great,

360
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,160
they give me the cucumber and the thing 
looks totally pissed.

361
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,203
It starts pounding on the ground and 
throws the cucumber back or it's 

362
00:16:17,641 --> 00:16:18,474
amazing.
Yeah.

363
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,520
Well,
so the question is what does that mean?

364
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,590
Why do they care about fairness in that 
way?

365
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,723
And,
and I think the answer to that question 

366
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:30,171
is sexual selection.
And so the key to sexual selection is it

367
00:16:30,871 --> 00:16:31,704
doesn't matter what everybody's getting 
so long as I'm getting about as much as 

368
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,274
everybody else,
but at the second that you're starting 

369
00:16:36,481 --> 00:16:39,990
to get more than I have.
Well then whatever females in our group,

370
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:41,550
she's going to pick you before she picks
me.

371
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,790
And so everything is relative.
We may think now,

372
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,890
why do you care so much about what other
people are doing?

373
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,660
Why don't you just be happy with what 
you got?

374
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,673
But literally the day you find out that 
the guy in the studio over salary's 

375
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,660
twice years,
your salary sucks because it makes sense

376
00:16:57,661 --> 00:16:58,494
because literally she's going to choose 
him now before she chooses you 

377
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,780
comparison's the thief of joy.
Yeah,

378
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:04,870
that's exactly right.
It's a.

379
00:17:04,871 --> 00:17:08,490
it's a really unfortunate fact because,
and sometimes it matters a lot.

380
00:17:08,491 --> 00:17:11,780
Like for example,
imagine I invented drug and I say here,

381
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,440
take a dose in,
it'll double your Iq.

382
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,940
Instantly you're going to feel like a 
genius,

383
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,130
but unbeknownst to I gave everybody two 
doses.

384
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,173
You walk out of there,
you're going to feel like a dumb ass 

385
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,240
because there's people saying stuff you 
can understand,

386
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,010
right?
So then it would matter,

387
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,930
but the killer cases or things where 
where it's only just a residence.

388
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,803
For example,
there's this amazing study where they 

389
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:33,630
showed that people were making minimum,
just above minimum wage are the ones who

390
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:37,340
don't want you to raise minimum wage to 
the most against it real.

391
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,460
Now,
why would that be?

392
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,950
Well,
right now they've got a slight advantage

393
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:41,784
over people making minimum wage.
The day minimum wage gets raised now 

394
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,580
they're not any better off than anybody 
else.

395
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:49,650
So even though they're the most likely 
to from it,

396
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,010
because they

397
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,620
may lose that job,
they have enough to take minimum wage.

398
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,740
They're actually against it because it 
gives them a slight advantage over,

399
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:56,850
you know,
the guy next door.

400
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,743
This is based on one study because I 
would think that the people that would 

401
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,390
be most against it will be the people 
that are hiring folks are at.

402
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,070
Fair enough.
It's only,

403
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,340
it's only looking at income so the boss 
probably feels even the more negative of

404
00:18:09,341 --> 00:18:10,174
all,
but if you look at people's income and 

405
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:11,874
their and their feelings about raising 
the minimum wage that people are making 

406
00:18:14,281 --> 00:18:15,114
minimum wage wanted to go up the people 
one notch above do not and then as the 

407
00:18:17,581 --> 00:18:18,810
higher you go,
they do again.

408
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:19,940
Really?
Yeah.

409
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:20,843
Wow.
Up until you get to the point where 

410
00:18:22,471 --> 00:18:25,470
you're employing people and some 
employers want to raise it.

411
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,190
Right?
I mean,

412
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,170
and some don't.
There's huge argument about that.

413
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,033
Now when it comes back to the capital 
and monkeys does the same effect happen 

414
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,590
whether it's a female or a male.
I don't know.

415
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,830
I mean so thing is people argue like 
crazy about exactly what this means.

416
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,220
I don't think the monkeys have a sense 
of fairness like you and I have,

417
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,740
but I do think they have a sense of,
hold on,

418
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,260
you're getting more than I am.
I can't let this happen,

419
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,453
otherwise I'm screwed and there's lots 
of great evidence that if you let that 

420
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:50,334
happen,
you're screwed.

421
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,293
But do the females have that same sense 
of competitiveness that they need to 

422
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:55,494
have the exact same thing,
those other bitches or having to get 

423
00:18:57,481 --> 00:18:58,291
angry?
Well,

424
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,124
here's the thing,
it depends on whether you're mating 

425
00:19:01,831 --> 00:19:04,290
system is going to be pair bonding or 
not,

426
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:08,340
so if you're a frog or a lots of 
different products,

427
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:09,174
not all of them are laughing tree frog 
or if you're a elephant seal or 

428
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:14,580
something,
we'll all the females mate with the best

429
00:19:14,581 --> 00:19:19,100
male because his job is just sex and so 
every female can add the best one or the

430
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,140
either in a situation where they've got 
no choice like the elephant seals.

431
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,973
He controls the rookery or in a 
situation where they just listened to 

432
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,600
all the croaking and then the guard.
You're the best broker,

433
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,493
you're the dad,
but if your pair bonding like humans or 

434
00:19:31,981 --> 00:19:33,930
like lots of other animals,
birds,

435
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,773
etc.
The then what you need is you've got 

436
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,704
competition on both sides.
So she's always compeTing to get the 

437
00:19:40,261 --> 00:19:43,050
best male and he's always competing to 
get the best female.

438
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,430
And there's reasons why male male 
competition is always a bit more intense

439
00:19:47,431 --> 00:19:49,830
than female female competition.
But both of them are there.

440
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,933
And the more monogamous the system gets,
the more both sides compete for each 

441
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:55,080
other.
Hm,

442
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,063
interesting.
So what about in the case of like 

443
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,163
bonobo's where they're.
So polyamorous and elbows are super 

444
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:03,474
interesting systems.
So you've got lots of polyamorous 

445
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,990
animals,
um,

446
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,190
banabos or interests.
Their chimps are also,

447
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,121
you know,
so if you look at,

448
00:20:09,121 --> 00:20:09,954
um,
one of the great ways to look at our 

449
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,294
ancestors and what their lives were like
because you look in your trousers and 

450
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,444
the size of your testicles tells you a 
lot about what sort of mating system 

451
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:19,740
your ancestors had.

452
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,783
So gorillas have tiny little testicles 
and the reason that they have such tiny 

453
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,654
testicles as they use their huge body to
drive away the other males and then all 

454
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,713
the females are in his harem so he 
doesn't need big testicles because he 

455
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:34,500
only needs a sperm in order to 
inseminate the females he's got.

456
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,200
it doesn't take much sperm to inseminate
anyone.

457
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,110
Female and testicles are really 
expensive tissue to make.

458
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,060
And if you want a pair and you land on 
them,

459
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:43,620
you know they're uncomfortable too.
Right?

460
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,783
And so then you look at our testicles 
and they're quite a bit bigger than a 

461
00:20:47,561 --> 00:20:48,394
gorillas,
but they're nowhere near the size of a 

462
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,460
chimp or urbanova.
Both.

463
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,593
They're baSically in many ways almost 
the same beast and so although socially 

464
00:20:55,661 --> 00:20:56,494
quite different and they have a system 
where they basically have to wash out 

465
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:00,664
the guy who was there before them.
And so it takes really big testicles to 

466
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,400
have sperm competition.
So their competition is.

467
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,690
And by fighting each other,
although there's a degree of that too,

468
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,180
they know full well that when she comes 
into estrus,

469
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:12,320
into heat,
there's going to be aligned.

470
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,203
And if you're fifth in line and you can 
wash everybody out before you might end 

471
00:21:15,561 --> 00:21:18,250
up the dad wash everybody out.
It was a funny way of putting it.

472
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,203
So it's not.

473
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,893
It's a this,
this testicle size is directly 

474
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:26,260
proportionate to the number of 
promiscuous females.

475
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,520
Well,
that's right.

476
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,120
The promise acuity the mating system.
And so if you look at our mating system,

477
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,580
we clearly evolved to be largely 
monogamous,

478
00:21:33,581 --> 00:21:34,414
but not entirely.
Our testicles are unnecessarily large 

479
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,203
for for an entirely monogamous species.
And so we're a little bit on the wash 

480
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,284
the guy out ahead of us.
There's many people to make arguments 

481
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:48,310
that are monogamy's socially reinforced 
and it's not natural.

482
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,593
Look,
if you look at hunter gatherers and and 

483
00:21:51,371 --> 00:21:53,500
so the best,
the best way that we get a sense of,

484
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,334
well what did we evolve to do is to look
at the remaining hunter gatherer 

485
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:57,814
societies,
particularly if you look at what are 

486
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:02,560
called immediate return on togethers.
So there are people who eat today,

487
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:04,990
what they killed today.
You've got a lot of hunter gatherers.

488
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,823
Once they left the equator,
they could store food and everything 

489
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,120
changed for them.
And they actually,

490
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,073
in many of the behaviors,
they look a lot like us and we can come 

491
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,950
back to that if you'd like,
but if you look at hunter gathers around

492
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:17,140
the equator there typically immediate 
return,

493
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,333
kill,
eat,

494
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,510
and so those guys tend to be,
tend to be,

495
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:23,344
there's always,
of course human differences where it's 

496
00:22:24,101 --> 00:22:27,910
super variable species,
but they tend to be serially monogamous.

497
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,020
And so some people pair up for life,
lots of people pair up for five,

498
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:34,720
seven years and then break apart and 
pair up again.

499
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,630
And so you have a sequence of children 
with the secrets of people,

500
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,840
but,
but largely monogamists not entirely.

501
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,940
And in fact,
monogamous during those time periods,

502
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:47,050
largely now we know every single animal 
we've ever described as monogamous.

503
00:22:47,051 --> 00:22:49,450
When we do the dnA,
we now find they're not entirely,

504
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,070
but they're mostly.

505
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,420
Hm.
Interesting.

506
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,610
So,
um,

507
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,530
have you ever had sex at dawn?
What did you think of that?

508
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,180
Um,
no offense,

509
00:22:58,181 --> 00:22:59,710
but I think it's total crap.
Oh,

510
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,150
chris ryan,
do you hear that shit?

511
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:03,010
Everybody's rocking on your book,
bro.

512
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,021
Uh,
what,

513
00:23:04,021 --> 00:23:07,420
what did you think is crap about it?
I just don't think the system works that

514
00:23:07,421 --> 00:23:08,254
way.
The the explain to people that may or 

515
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,263
may not know what we're talking about.
I haven't read that book now since it 

516
00:23:11,741 --> 00:23:12,880
came out,
so let me remind,

517
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,320
remind me the thesis.
Do you remember it off?

518
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,154
The idea is that we evolved in these 
small tribes of people that essentially 

519
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,510
shared sexual partners.
That's bullshit.

520
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:25,630
And so the thing is that what makes you 
say that so confidently?

521
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,980
well,
I don't know.

522
00:23:26,981 --> 00:23:29,080
I shouldn't say quite so confidently.
You're absolutely right.

523
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,790
I believe that's bullshit.
How's that?

524
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,530
Okay.
Why do you believe that's bullshit?

525
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:33,483
Because I'm so human beings have very 
clear evolve jealousy systems and 

526
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,070
they're not just a product of the world 
that we live in today.

527
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,860
You can see jealousy among hunter 
gatherers as well.

528
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,250
Now the thing is they get jealous

529
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,083
about different things because of course
men and women are slightly different 

530
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:51,250
pressure on them,
but they both get jealous by infidelity.

531
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:52,243
Now that's not to say that the book is 
incorrect about some societies in some 

532
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:56,474
places because one of the interesting 
things about humans is our flexibility 

533
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,313
and so you can create a system and some 
hunter gatherers have where there's a 

534
00:24:03,171 --> 00:24:06,080
lot of that,
a ton of that to some really interesting

535
00:24:06,081 --> 00:24:08,810
ones were literally once the woman gets 
pregnant,

536
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:09,644
she then starts to sleep with all the 
other males because she thinks her baby 

537
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:14,140
will gain the qualities of all the men 
that she sleeps with.

538
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,983
So I'm not trying to claim that we're 
always monogamous Because absolutely 

539
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:18,764
that's untrue.
but I do think that the dominant system 

540
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,333
is one of serial monogamy.
And the reason I think that that's the 

541
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:24,914
dominant system is this is kind of the 
deal that we made whereby the males go 

542
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:30,400
out and do the hunting.

543
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,320
The females go out and do gathering.
And that's basically universal.

544
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,560
She tends to cook for him And that comes
back to the fire point you made,

545
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:39,110
which we can come back to.
And um,

546
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,860
and so they share resources and,
and he's happy to share resources and do

547
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:44,930
his best to kinda sorta look out for her
kids.

548
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:45,764
I mean human males aren't,
we don't take as much care as human 

549
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:48,854
females do have our kids,
but we're much better than the other 

550
00:24:50,811 --> 00:24:51,644
great apes.
And so that level of investment he's 

551
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:54,434
going to make his,
tends to be to the degree that he 

552
00:24:55,821 --> 00:24:57,410
believes that he's the father of the 
kids.

553
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,513
Now you have societies where he doesn't 
know that really all are polyamorous 

554
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:02,444
like that by all means.
I don't know what percentage they are 

555
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:06,920
and it could even be,
they're more common than I believe,

556
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,143
but when that happens,
the systems tend to change a little bit 

557
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,070
and he's a little bit less willing to 
look out,

558
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,113
try to help out kids other than to do 
her a favor unless the kid looks a lot 

559
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,043
like himself.

560
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:23,740
Now what about why having a system,
a biological system where jealousy comes

561
00:25:26,661 --> 00:25:27,494
up?
What makes you think that that somehow 

562
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:33,950
or another negates the idea of 
polyamorous relationships?

563
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,843
Well,
it does suggest that they're not our 

564
00:25:36,141 --> 00:25:40,430
default because it doesn't more likely 
suggests that it encourages competition,

565
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:41,600
which is just natural

566
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,310
when we think about envy instead of 
jealousy,

567
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,293
and so if I'm jealous,
I'm upset that my wife slept with 

568
00:25:48,181 --> 00:25:50,610
somebody else last night.
He could be a low life.

569
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:53,340
I don't envy a thing about him.
I don't want anything he owns,

570
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,550
but I'm jealous of her behavior.
I'm.

571
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,130
I'm protective of what she's done and so
there's a wonderful experiment.

572
00:25:59,131 --> 00:26:01,360
David buss has run at the university of 
Texas stuff.

573
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,540
They're jealous of the man as well.
You're not just jealous of her behavior.

574
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,443
You're jealous of this other male that 
gets to have sex with your wife and 

575
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:11,274
could not possibly encourage competition
and encourage men to be more aggressive 

576
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:21,231
or more ingenious or just create 
encouraged creativity and courage,

577
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,220
better hunting skills.
So you attract more women.

578
00:26:26,221 --> 00:26:28,670
I mean,
all those things seem to control.

579
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,700
YeaH,
I would agree with all that.

580
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,613
I phrased it a little bit differently.
So there's this wonderful study out of 

581
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:33,404
the Philippines where they measured 
men's huge number of men's testosterone 

582
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:40,100
when they were single and then they 
waited a few years and measured it again

583
00:26:40,101 --> 00:26:40,934
after they were.
They were still single or now they're 

584
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:42,914
married and now they're married and they
have kids and I'm sure it wasn't a 

585
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,120
psychology study because we can't afford
to do that.

586
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:48,954
It was probably some medical thing,
but they used to to answer this 

587
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:53,340
interesting psychological question,
which what's have,

588
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,323
who's most likely to get the girl by the
original testosterone levels and what 

589
00:26:57,001 --> 00:26:58,710
happens when you do?
Well,

590
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,813
the guys who got married in the 
intervening few years had higher 

591
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:05,310
testosterone than the guys who didn't.
So yeah,

592
00:27:05,311 --> 00:27:06,144
you're absolutely right.
we're out there competing with other 

593
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:11,250
males in order to get the girl and 
there's lots and lots of goes on there.

594
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,083
Tons of really interesting things.
but what's interesting is once we get 

595
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:17,670
the girl are testosterone drops and so 
if we.

596
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,450
Once we partner up and if we're in a 
monogamous relationship,

597
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:23,610
not polyamorous,
but in a monogamous relationship,

598
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:25,920
our testosterone drops and then it drops
again.

599
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:26,754
If we have kids and testosterone is a 
great hormone for getting out there and 

600
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:30,894
being competitive with other guys,
it's not a great hormone for being 

601
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:34,014
nurturing for your children and it's not
a great hormone for being faithful to 

602
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:37,464
your partner and so I think that we 
evolved to compete with other males in 

603
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:44,700
order to get into the mating game.
So if you look at our ancestral dna,

604
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:45,534
you know how you can track our male and 
female ancestry through mitochondrial 

605
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,194
dna in the mother's side and why you'll 
see that we have far more female 

606
00:27:51,511 --> 00:27:54,390
ancestors than male,
not quite two to one,

607
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:56,700
But I think it's close to that.
And so what does that tell us?

608
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:58,710
Well,
lots of guys are getting left out of the

609
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,350
mating game entirely and lots of guys 
are inseminating,

610
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:02,184
lots of different women.
So all those things that you said are 

611
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,630
absolutely true and all that pushes us 
for competition,

612
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,710
but part of what I believe goes on as 
part of that competition that we engaged

613
00:28:10,711 --> 00:28:11,544
in was in order to get the girl to get 
into that relationship in the first 

614
00:28:14,011 --> 00:28:14,760
place.

615
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,593
Could I stop you there?
Because I think that if you're going to 

616
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,820
have a study on testosterone and you 
have to have a study on lifestyle,

617
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,173
I mean you,
if you get married and you have 

618
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:26,934
children,
one of the things that happens is you 

619
00:28:27,841 --> 00:28:29,310
become less active.
You'd be,

620
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,920
you don't exercise as much,
you don't sleep as much.

621
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,280
All those things have a pretty radical 
effect on hormone production.

622
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,050
Absolutely.
And it could well be that,

623
00:28:37,051 --> 00:28:37,884
you know,
you always have to have a proximal 

624
00:28:38,521 --> 00:28:40,680
mechanism whereby evolution plays its 
game,

625
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:44,130
right?
So the distal cause is as,

626
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,973
as an evolved species where testosterone
is super important to get us into the 

627
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:50,460
mating game,
but it's less useful once we're in it.

628
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,980
Well all you could,
you could,

629
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,833
all you have to do is have a system 
whereby those things tend to 

630
00:28:54,361 --> 00:28:56,430
downregulate testosterone.
Exactly like you said,

631
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,060
because you know those things are gonna 
happen once you get partnered up and so.

632
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,070
But mind you,
when our ancestors partnered up,

633
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:03,890
they're still out hunting every day.
You know,

634
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,733
we may be right.

635
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,960
You don't have Studies on.
Unfortunately we don't.

636
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,200
The issue is that I'm having with this 
is we have studies on the general health

637
00:29:12,931 --> 00:29:16,290
and testosterone and hormonal health of 
sedentary humans.

638
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,173
Yeah,
I mean I would like to know what their 

639
00:29:18,421 --> 00:29:20,640
lifestyle is.
I would like to know what they're doing.

640
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,863
I'm sure that seem to make any sense to 
me because one thing that everybody 

641
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,060
knows is that you get dad bod,
right?

642
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,950
That's dad by what his dad bought.
Dad.

643
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:30,660
Bob's a guy who works all day,
comes home,

644
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:33,180
sits on the couch,
probably eats food.

645
00:29:33,181 --> 00:29:35,700
You probably shouldn't eat,
hangs out with his kids,

646
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,680
doesn't get a whole lot of exercise,
works,

647
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,570
probably doesn't sleep as much as he 
should.

648
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,220
That.
That's to me,

649
00:29:42,221 --> 00:29:45,850
that's a symptom of poor health and 
fitness.

650
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,920
Right?
And it's not a symptom or ancestors ever

651
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:48,730
experienced.

652
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,370
Not.
This is not necessarily an indication of

653
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:52,204
any sort of evolutionary benefit of 
having low testosterone because we've 

654
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,004
demonstrated for sure that when people 
don't get sleep and when they don't get 

655
00:30:00,851 --> 00:30:02,800
exercise,
their testosterone drops.

656
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,634
So those are two things that absolutely 
happen when you get married and have 

657
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:05,400
children.

658
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,233
Right.
And the only thing I would say is the 

659
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,250
times of the time span of this study was
only over a few years and let's see.

660
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:13,163
The worst thing about having this kind 
of a study and making these kinds of 

661
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,490
kind of conclusions based on.
I mean we see,

662
00:30:20,491 --> 00:30:21,324
we know these mechanisms are in place,
we already know that there's natural 

663
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:27,750
effects of sedentary lifestyle,
lack of sleep,

664
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:32,370
and the effects are your hormone 
production drops,

665
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:34,290
your body suffers,
you become less healthy.

666
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:37,860
And this is.
This is not indicating monogamy,

667
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,993
this is just indicating poor health.
This is not like an evolutionary 

668
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,870
advantage to having low testosterone 
because it helps you raise children.

669
00:30:45,871 --> 00:30:46,704
You can have high testosterone is still 
be a good dad and raise children and 

670
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:50,620
still have friends.
That theme,

671
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,490
of course,
all of these things are bell curves,

672
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:53,750
right?
The higher you are,

673
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:54,584
the harder it gets.

674
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:59,180
Part of the problem I'm having iS,
is drawing conclusions on this one study

675
00:30:59,181 --> 00:31:00,800
and stating them as if they're facts.

676
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,833
No,
you're absolutely right.

677
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,090
I,
if I say it's a fact,

678
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:06,220
it's certainly overstated because we 
only know the problem with almost all of

679
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:07,810
our studies is the exact one you pointed
out.

680
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,260
We've got them on us.
We don't have.

681
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,970
So like the sex studies are a perfect 
example.

682
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:15,730
Like things like female orgasm.
What role does it play?

683
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,743
Well,
you need really good data on hunter 

684
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,450
gatherers to know the answer to that 
question.

685
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,970
If you look at hunter gatherers,
they don't have dad bod,

686
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:22,804
right?
They're all running and whether their 

687
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:25,144
fathers are not because they're out 
there hunting every day or gathering 

688
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:28,450
everyday.
Very physically active.

689
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,160
So if I,
if I oversold that,

690
00:31:30,161 --> 00:31:31,420
my apologies.
Because you're absolutely right.

691
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,880
I suspect though that you'd find the 
same thing.

692
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:36,070
I don't know it.
It's all we got right now,

693
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,560
but how can you suspect it?
I mean it just,

694
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,080
there's no data,
there's no data.

695
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,180
It just,
when you look

696
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,010
these guys,
I have a friend of mine who he was,

697
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,990
was it,
how'd you say the name?

698
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:51,380
The yanomami in Bolivia.
Bolivia.

699
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,940
Whether in Venezuela,
Brazil.

700
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,810
Yeah.
And he spent some time with them and you

701
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,810
see these people and the lifestyle they 
live,

702
00:31:57,811 --> 00:32:00,050
they're all barefoot wandering through 
the jungle.

703
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:00,884
They have these crazy looking feet,
whether their toes splay out because 

704
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:06,620
they're just constantly gripping the 
floor with their toes when they probably

705
00:32:06,621 --> 00:32:08,000
could choke you with me,
you know,

706
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,020
and these people just look so fit and 
healthy in their,

707
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,510
in their fifties and sixties and 
seventies.

708
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:16,070
And they have their shirt off and 
they're ripped.

709
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,270
Yeah,
they're super fit.

710
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:19,630
Same holds.
If you look at the hubs in Tanzania,

711
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:20,563
any of these groups,
the yanomamo are interesting because 

712
00:32:22,101 --> 00:32:22,934
they're a hunter horticulturalist,
so they're actually doing a little bit 

713
00:32:24,591 --> 00:32:25,424
of gardening as well.
But they're ripped and strong and they 

714
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:28,484
don't have obesity problem.
And so all I would say is That the same 

715
00:32:32,001 --> 00:32:34,490
thing holds.
The one thing that we found in humans in

716
00:32:34,491 --> 00:32:38,210
our modern culture where we have these 
data is if you're married and have kids,

717
00:32:38,211 --> 00:32:39,044
but you're still looking,
your tea hasn't gone down as much that 

718
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,163
you're going to point out quite rightly 
that well maybe that's a different kind 

719
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:47,000
of person than the person who marries 
and isn't looking around,

720
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,283
and so it's all confounded,
super hard to do experiments on these 

721
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:53,240
things and we'll be a lot better off 
when we've got,

722
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,460
as you know,
we're losing the world's last hunter.

723
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,660
Gatherers are disappearing and it's not 
easy to collect these kinds of data,

724
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:00,494
but they're doing lots of genetic work 
with these people right now all over 

725
00:33:02,901 --> 00:33:04,230
africa because you know,
there's.

726
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,290
We've got tons of genetic data now on 
european descent and east asian descent,

727
00:33:09,291 --> 00:33:10,124
but almost none on africans and so 
that's a huge project underway and so 

728
00:33:13,161 --> 00:33:13,994
for all I know,
they're working on hormones and other 

729
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,580
things as well.
Yeah.

730
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:20,360
That's the reason why I'm asking about 
this is you.

731
00:33:20,361 --> 00:33:25,361
You were so readily dismissing.
You were so willing to dismiss that,

732
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,480
but yeah.
Well,

733
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,323
the.
A lot of the facts that are laid out as 

734
00:33:30,951 --> 00:33:33,250
facts in the book don't really hold up 
and I'm in.

735
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,320
I wish I'd read it more recently and so 
I could go through the details with you.

736
00:33:36,321 --> 00:33:37,154
There's some really good reviews by 
anthropologists and by people who work 

737
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,060
in,
you know,

738
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,710
sexual studies and stuff like that.

739
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,980
Going through the details.
We read it as a,

740
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:46,003
we haven't this evolutionary center 
center for psychology and evolution and 

741
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:51,740
we read it and went through it and we 
weren't convinced.

742
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,400
I'm embarrassed to admit I can't 
remember the details of.

743
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,360
Chris is a very smart guy and he's a 
good friend of mine.

744
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,520
also a great book.
It is a great book.

745
00:33:58,521 --> 00:34:00,560
I would love to see him debate one of 
those folks.

746
00:34:00,561 --> 00:34:02,510
I'm sure he probably has.
He probably has.

747
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,493
And look,
I know that all these things that we're 

748
00:34:05,451 --> 00:34:06,950
talking about are heavily debated,
right?

749
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:07,784
So.
So my colleague rob brooks is a 

750
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:11,450
wonderful evolutionary biologists and 
Australia loves that book.

751
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:15,500
So the fact that I think it's bullshit 
is obviously one person's opinion.

752
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,480
Where I.
I dismissed that argument.

753
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,500
Other people might say,
well look,

754
00:34:18,501 --> 00:34:19,334
there's a lot of cultures that they do 
have much more like the system I told 

755
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:24,460
you about where they have sex with lots 
of men after they have their baby.

756
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,710
Humans are so flexible,
we can do all those things.

757
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:29,630
we just changed the nature of how we do 
things.

758
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,850
The social leap that I'm arguing about 
is not this pair bonding thing.

759
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,910
It's about how our groups came together 
to engage in collective action.

760
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,370
so in principle,
I'm agnostic on this issue.

761
00:34:40,371 --> 00:34:43,100
I just happen to disagree with that.
I happen to feel like no,

762
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,920
I think we made these deals.
And so to come back to the study,

763
00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:48,710
the david buss did that I started to 
tell you about.

764
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,480
So bas has this,
um,

765
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:52,940
he's got,
when he came along,

766
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,193
people thought that the two sexes had 
similar levels of jealousy for 

767
00:34:56,781 --> 00:34:58,430
infidelity.
And david was like,

768
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:00,260
well,
looks inseminations internal.

769
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,363
And so men should be a lot more worried 
about her sleeping with somebody else 

770
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,913
than women should be because he.
Men never know for sure if they're the 

771
00:35:08,961 --> 00:35:10,490
father,
they can't see it happen.

772
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,601
Whereas,
you know,

773
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:12,710
if you're a salmon,
you can say,

774
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:13,341
okay,
I'm the debt,

775
00:35:13,341 --> 00:35:15,200
I just watched that,
but um,

776
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,710
females inseminations turn,
but they know they're the mother.

777
00:35:18,711 --> 00:35:19,544
That's not their concern.
They should be more concerned about 

778
00:35:21,111 --> 00:35:21,944
things like his given her resources to 
help her raise the kids and things like 

779
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:26,354
that.
And so what bus found is if you ask 

780
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:30,680
people this question,
what would bother you more?

781
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,430
Imagine your wife having sex with 
somebody that she just met for the first

782
00:35:34,431 --> 00:35:35,264
time,
having this great time and doing all 

783
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,690
these different things with them and 
then never doing it again.

784
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,530
Or your wife develops this,
you know,

785
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:44,730
ongoing,
emotional connection with somebody.

786
00:35:44,731 --> 00:35:46,590
She never touched him.
He never touches her,

787
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,920
but they talk and have shared their 
feelings and stared deep in each other's

788
00:35:49,921 --> 00:35:51,390
eyes.
What would bother you more?

789
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,300
And you ask men and women that question.
So what would,

790
00:35:54,301 --> 00:35:55,134
in your case,
what would bother you to have your wife 

791
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,500
to know?
She had this one off a fair fling.

792
00:35:59,100 --> 00:35:59,933
Sex only didn't care about the guy or 
she develops a sort of emotional bond 

793
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:04,590
with somebody.
Never touches it.

794
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,620
That's a good question.
I'd really have to think about that.

795
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,750
It's not an easy one because nobody 
likes either of them.

796
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,040
No.
Yeah,

797
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:15,610
because it's a matter of time for that 
dude gets in.

798
00:36:15,611 --> 00:36:16,444
That's a no.
The guarantee in this case is the 

799
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:20,920
guarantee.
It's a guarantee that they never,

800
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,850
never touched.
Never.

801
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,470
As long as he doesn't talk shit about 
me.

802
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,090
That's the problem.
Those guys,

803
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,200
they started the pool.
I would do so much better.

804
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:31,481
Right?
Well,

805
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:32,500
here's the thing.
Weasels,

806
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,280
on average,
men are more bothered by sex.

807
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,720
The one off sex and women are more 
bothered by the emotional,

808
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,020
emotional connection because connection 
could lead to him leaving her.

809
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,953
Well also,
if it's him leaving her directing his 

810
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:49,280
resources elsewhere,
so it's,

811
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,173
it's mind you,
every time we talk about gender 

812
00:36:51,321 --> 00:36:52,940
differences is super important to keep 
in mind.

813
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,783
They're heavily overlapping bell curves,
so it's never 100 percent this way and 

814
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,670
except like do you have this Oregon or 
something?

815
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,430
But psychologically it's always 
overlapping,

816
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:04,970
but on this is a big effect.
Men on average are much more bothered by

817
00:37:04,971 --> 00:37:07,490
the one off sex and women on average are
much more

818
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,600
bothered by the emotional connection.
Yeah,

819
00:37:10,601 --> 00:37:11,434
that's fascinating because I was reading
something about inappropriate emotional 

820
00:37:14,501 --> 00:37:15,334
relationships that people have at work 
and that this is an issue with people 

821
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:20,524
that work together.
They develop these office friendships 

822
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,440
that lead to inappropriate emotional 
relationships and I was like,

823
00:37:29,441 --> 00:37:30,274
whoa,
this is a,

824
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:31,883
you know,
I've never worked in an office so I'm 

825
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:35,170
listening to this or reading this 
rather.

826
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:37,720
And I'm like,
what a strange world that is.

827
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,280
Like,
I get it though.

828
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,353
I get it.
Like if there's a guy and he's married 

829
00:37:42,141 --> 00:37:42,974
and a gal and she's married,
but they meet at work and they stare in 

830
00:37:44,831 --> 00:37:45,664
each other's eyes all day and they go to
lunch and maybe they even hold hands 

831
00:37:49,061 --> 00:37:50,020
every now and then.
Well,

832
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:52,990
they become.
That's where it crosses the line.

833
00:37:52,991 --> 00:37:55,120
Like you're allowed to hug people when 
you hold hands.

834
00:37:55,121 --> 00:37:56,920
That's fucking.
That's tense.

835
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,330
That skin to skin.

836
00:37:58,690 --> 00:37:59,523
It is serious.
It's going to concern you if you're a 

837
00:38:02,171 --> 00:38:03,004
partner,
but what's also going to concern you as 

838
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:06,400
a mere fact that you see this kind of 
thing,

839
00:38:06,401 --> 00:38:08,290
this deep conversation happening and all
that,

840
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:12,190
because think about it.
If we evolve to basically partner up for

841
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,033
awhile,
then there's always going to be the 

842
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:15,454
chance that that next person long it's 
gonna be the one which is years away 

843
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,303
serial monogamy and both males and 
females gain from not putting all their 

844
00:38:21,641 --> 00:38:24,520
eggs into the same genetic basket.
So if my.

845
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,230
If my wife partners up with you for 
awhile,

846
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:29,500
she'll get a certain kind of offspring 
and then maybe that'll be a great thing,

847
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:34,240
but maybe when the situation changes or 
the in tomorrow's world,

848
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:36,160
some smaller guy would be handy

849
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,220
in some way and so maybe she's better 
off partnering with me next.

850
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,180
Interesting.

851
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,120
Yeah.
It is fascinating when you break it down

852
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,263
that it really does become.
There's a biological reason for these 

853
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:49,984
behaviors and these are the motivation 
for the jealousy and all these things 

854
00:38:54,011 --> 00:38:54,844
that there's.
There's a history of biological history 

855
00:38:56,801 --> 00:38:57,280
to all this

856
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,113
stuff and we don't know what hunter 
gathers how they would answer that 

857
00:39:00,741 --> 00:39:01,574
question so we can only just assuming 
that the answer we're providing is 

858
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,140
general,
but for me,

859
00:39:06,141 --> 00:39:08,920
those kinds of things suggests that we 
evolved.

860
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,763
We evolved in a lot of longterm 
monogamous circumstances that may have 

861
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:14,810
been serial and there was certainly 
fooling around,

862
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,853
but if we were polyamorous,
like the book says we'd have bigger 

863
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:21,050
balls.
Are balls are so big though,

864
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,430
compared to a chimp there.
Small.

865
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:24,050
Yeah.
But chimps are.

866
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,820
I mean,
everything's big with them.

867
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,601
Well,
no.

868
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:29,720
Our penis is way bigger than theirs.
They got a tiny little.

869
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,690
They have large.
Paul's smaller penises.

870
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,280
Puppets would probably get in the way.
Right.

871
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,510
When though.
Here's the thing about,

872
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:36,363
so human beings copulate for an 
extraordinarily long period of time and 

873
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,570
we also have this cryptic ovulation,
you know,

874
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,340
where she's not showing you that she's 
in heat,

875
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,563
so mail chimp's aren't interested unless
she has an enormous swelling on her 

876
00:39:48,381 --> 00:39:49,910
vagina and then they're like,
oh,

877
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:51,080
that's super attractive to me.

878
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,933
Oh,
I say,

879
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,580
but what about banabos?
Because they,

880
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,463
well,
they do this funky sex thing all the 

881
00:39:55,371 --> 00:39:56,204
time.
Right?

882
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,171
Have fun,
right?

883
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,004
Yeah.
They're all sorts of funky orgiastic 

884
00:40:00,261 --> 00:40:01,270
kinds of things.
We used,

885
00:40:01,271 --> 00:40:02,104
there's a,
when I taught at Ohio state university 

886
00:40:04,071 --> 00:40:04,904
that the zoo there has a great exhibit 
and you bring your kids through and 

887
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:09,950
there's a series orgy going on and the 
kids are like,

888
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,930
came out and she said,
yeah,

889
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,700
there's a lot of zoos that won't happen.
Novos,

890
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:14,563
because they're pretty interesting.
And so the thing is that those kinds of 

891
00:40:18,471 --> 00:40:20,300
things just show you that it's 
complicated,

892
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:21,134
right?
Any kind of straightforward answer that 

893
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,020
it's going to have some wrinkles.
Yes.

894
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,020
Yeah.
And I apologize if I get some earlier.

895
00:40:27,021 --> 00:40:28,430
No worries.
And so anyway,

896
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:31,520
the um,
the but back to this issue.

897
00:40:31,521 --> 00:40:35,750
So if we had a total bonobo,
chimp kind of system,

898
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,660
I don't think we had evolved those 
systems of jealousy because what's,

899
00:40:38,661 --> 00:40:41,120
what's to be gained by that we're not 
making these longterm partners.

900
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,650
Why would you get these differences?
again,

901
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:43,484
whenever I bring chris's book up,
I have to defend it because it has 

902
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:47,660
happened a couple times in the last 
year.

903
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,963
I haven't read it and at least two years
I'd have to go back and I read it back 

904
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:54,680
over five years ago,
but someone who came out,

905
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,623
when my friend's wife got ahold of it,
my friend got it and my friend's wife 

906
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:01,204
got all of it

907
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,770
to a right in the trash.
She read like a paragraph or two and she

908
00:41:04,771 --> 00:41:05,980
was like,
fuck this book.

909
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,540
A lot of women react that way and I 
can't remember why.

910
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,381
Yeah,
sorry,

911
00:41:11,381 --> 00:41:12,580
I just don't have it loaded up.

912
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,220
Whatever.
Um,

913
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,143
so when these chimp,
like creatures from millions of years 

914
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:19,883
ago,
slowly started walking upright and 

915
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,970
started moving into the grasslands and 
making,

916
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,930
making experiments and traveling away 
from the jungle.

917
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,783
And this coincided the development of 
the throwing arm and this could because 

918
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:40,760
they started walking upright.
When did this,

919
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,140
when did the cooked meat

920
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,970
come along?
So they don't control fire.

921
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,160
so also can't do that.
So now we go forward.

922
00:41:47,161 --> 00:41:49,380
We're now about three and a half million
yearS ago.

923
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,393
You got to now go forward to about a 
little less than 2 million years ago to 

924
00:41:53,431 --> 00:41:56,460
get to homo erectus.
So once we get to homo erectus,

925
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,990
we now got an,
uh,

926
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,780
an ancestor that literally,
if it went to the z,

927
00:42:00,781 --> 00:42:02,610
you'd say,
well that's a kind of rough hewn guy,

928
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,653
but you think it's a person and not 
somebody who bought belongs behind the 

929
00:42:05,671 --> 00:42:06,910
glass.
So,

930
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:07,783
so a chimp brain is three 80 
australopithecus for 50 and homoerectus 

931
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:13,350
nine slash 60.
Whoa.

932
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:14,820
So you got doubling.
A brain says,

933
00:42:14,821 --> 00:42:15,151
no,
mind you.

934
00:42:15,151 --> 00:42:15,984
It's a bigger being.
So it's not as quite as big dramatic of 

935
00:42:18,351 --> 00:42:19,184
a change as you think.
But along with that comes all sorts of 

936
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:21,834
capabilities.
Now you write about this book catching 

937
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,090
fire.

938
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:26,760
Richard wrangham argued that what 
enabled that?

939
00:42:26,761 --> 00:42:30,180
So if you look at the gut of a gorilla 
or a chimpanzee in their brain,

940
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:31,014
they got a lot of guts for a little bit 
of brain because it takes a lot of 

941
00:42:33,181 --> 00:42:35,640
digestion to keep a little bit of brain 
going.

942
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:38,720
We have a tiny gut for a huge brain and 
rang a argues,

943
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:39,563
and I think quite rightly,
that the only way you can achieve that 

944
00:42:41,581 --> 00:42:43,680
is by releasing more nutrients from your
food.

945
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,693
And the only way you can release more 
nutrients from your food is by cooking 

946
00:42:46,531 --> 00:42:48,330
it.
So when he made that argument,

947
00:42:48,331 --> 00:42:50,580
he thinks it goes back to the beginning 
of homo erectus.

948
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:54,150
And I suspect he's right at this point.
When he made the argument,

949
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,380
we.
It was only back to,

950
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:58,410
I don't remember half a million years,
350,000.

951
00:42:58,411 --> 00:42:59,940
It's already back to a million years 
ago.

952
00:42:59,941 --> 00:43:03,690
We found in caves in South Africa,
evidence of control of fire.

953
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:06,860
and so it'll probably keep getting 
pushed back because you know that crap.

954
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:09,960
It's hard to find.
So this was a half million years,

955
00:43:09,961 --> 00:43:11,600
so now it's back to a million 
millionaires.

956
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,890
And he made that prediction when it 
wasn't even that far back

957
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:14,803
in a million years ago,
even though they're not technically not 

958
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:18,430
homeless.

959
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,850
No,
we're still at home erectus.

960
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,430
And so they started a one point nine or 
so,

961
00:43:22,431 --> 00:43:25,790
one point 7 million years ago.
And one point nine,

962
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:28,460
I think.
And what homo erectus could now do.

963
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:31,750
So now remember what the argument is,
this social leap,

964
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,500
it's this collective action that not 
only protects us on the savanna but sets

965
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,200
us on this new pathway.
It creates this new niche.

966
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,034
It's this cognitive niche,
although I think of it as a social 

967
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:42,434
cognitive niche because it's the working
together that gives you all these 

968
00:43:44,991 --> 00:43:48,860
potential advantages to getting smarter 
and so now when that gene sitting in our

969
00:43:48,861 --> 00:43:49,694
head,
if it kicks into gear those and starts 

970
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:54,200
to work and it leads to cranial 
expansion,

971
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:55,303
those animals will have and will have an
advantage because they can coordinate 

972
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,570
with each other better and so they can 
remember,

973
00:43:59,571 --> 00:44:00,404
hey man,
you helped me out last time but you 

974
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:01,970
weren't.

975
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:03,260
So yeah,
couldn't count on you.

976
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:05,120
So I'm avoiding you and I'm sticking 
with you.

977
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,333
They can do a lot of things with that 
brainpower and by the time you get to 

978
00:44:08,541 --> 00:44:10,100
homo erectus and the brain power is 
doubled.

979
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:12,080
We see all sorts of super interesting 
things.

980
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:15,530
So before homo erectus,
when you look at our tools,

981
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,403
it's called an older one tool and it's 
basically a barely sharpened rock and 

982
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:20,414
you never find an older one tool to very
far away from wherever it was quarried 

983
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:25,310
and made like,
you know,

984
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,263
you look at the rock and the chips and 
not far away is where it's lying on the 

985
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:31,380
ground.
Homo erectus made a much nicer tool.

986
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:32,310
It's bi-facial.

987
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,293
It took a lot of energy to make it.
When we teach modern anthropologists or 

988
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:38,933
grad students or whatever to make them 
and you put them in an mri magnet where 

989
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:43,950
it can measure your metabolism and your 
brain is you go,

990
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,083
you see that it takes a lot of frontal 
lobe functioning in order to make one 

991
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:49,163
because it's a lot of planning.
how am I going to hit it next to make 

992
00:44:51,001 --> 00:44:51,834
this thing just right compared to an 
older one tool to make those doesn't 

993
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,210
take much frontal functioning.
Just racket there and it'll be sharp.

994
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,440
And so the first of all,
we know homo erectus invented that tool,

995
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:02,403
this,
this assurion tool with his bi-facial 

996
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,920
handhelds.
and second of all,

997
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,100
and one of my,
one of the coolest findings,

998
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:11,880
there's some interesting work in a one 
point 2 million year old site in India,

999
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,033
uh,
by carrie sHipped and where he finds 

1000
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:18,921
that the production of these tools is 
separated spatially about the place.

1001
00:45:20,310 --> 00:45:24,510
So the first step is bashing loose a big
piece of rock and that's done here.

1002
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,373
And then 10 meters over there,
somebody doing the initial chipping on 

1003
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:28,554
it and 10 meters over there,
somebody sharpening up the final 

1004
00:45:30,961 --> 00:45:31,950
touches.
Now,

1005
00:45:31,951 --> 00:45:35,010
if you were making it by yourself,
why would you systematically walk around

1006
00:45:35,011 --> 00:45:37,200
the site as you made it?
You almost assuredly wouldn't.

1007
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,260
But if you've got division of labor,
you're the big strong guy,

1008
00:45:40,261 --> 00:45:41,094
you do the first thing,
then you hand it to me and I do the 

1009
00:45:42,631 --> 00:45:43,464
finer sharpening.
It makes sense that it would be 

1010
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:50,040
spatially distributed about the site.
So there's that evidence for division of

1011
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:50,874
labor.
There's the evidence that they're 

1012
00:45:51,241 --> 00:45:52,074
bringing down some pretty fast animals 
like horses and potentially even 

1013
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:55,434
bringing down elephants,
which in those days are like twice the 

1014
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:57,714
size of an elephant and then they using 
spirits at that point we don't know 

1015
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:02,160
because they didn't survive.

1016
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,870
Right.
And nothing would is still around.

1017
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,733
There's no sign of hafting anything.
So if it was beers it would have been a 

1018
00:46:06,781 --> 00:46:07,614
wooden point.
so I think what they could meaning the 

1019
00:46:09,811 --> 00:46:12,440
end of it like cut in half.
so you could stick an ear tip.

1020
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:13,603
exactly.
And then exactly strapping it on or any 

1021
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,100
of a variety of were put.
Yeah.

1022
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:19,920
And so they.
There was no sign of that yet,

1023
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:21,910
but there's no reason why they couldn't 
have a sharpened spirit.

1024
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:22,770
In fact,
we know that.

1025
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,873
Remember the,
I mentioned the chimps in Senegal that 

1026
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,574
live on the savannah.
They're the only chimps on earth who do 

1027
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:30,390
this.
They'll bite the stick to sharpen it and

1028
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:33,990
poke them monkeys to when they're in the
hollow of a tree and stab up.

1029
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:35,780
Did you see that recent discovery and 
I'm in.

1030
00:46:35,790 --> 00:46:36,623
It's really recently.
There was an article I read one or two 

1031
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,010
days ago at about orangutans when they 
gave them wire.

1032
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,920
They use the wire to fashion and into 
fishhooks.

1033
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,050
Now I didn't.
That's totally cool.

1034
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,550
They figured out how to make a fishhook 
independently and that's amazing.

1035
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,710
You've seen them like spearfish,
right?

1036
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,130
Hangover,
tornadoes that.

1037
00:46:54,131 --> 00:46:56,880
That's that.
That picture is actually of an orangutan

1038
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:59,370
who's watched fishermen do this.
He couldn't do It.

1039
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:00,563
Remember an orangutan,
if it meant you could literally pull 

1040
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:04,650
your arms off like that.
The enormous strength,

1041
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,493
particular gearing for that strength.
They got very poor motor control like 

1042
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,900
you and I can type.
They can't do that.

1043
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,410
Right.
And so that,

1044
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:12,263
that orangutan,
that famous photo never could catch 

1045
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,220
anything,
seen it done and it was trying to see if

1046
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:18,330
he could do it too.
Fair enough.

1047
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,600
He's trying to use a timer but.
But you know,

1048
00:47:21,601 --> 00:47:22,434
there's these corporate,
these crows and such dell fashioned 

1049
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:26,210
hooks to.
Yeah.

1050
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,143
So there's some,
there's a lot of amazing evidence for 

1051
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:30,820
this sort of animal ingenuity and making
tools will.

1052
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,610
You've seen the studies with crows were 
they use one stick to get a larger study

1053
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,360
to get a larger food?
Amazing.

1054
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,840
Now the one thing is we don't.
They can do that and then they fail some

1055
00:47:40,841 --> 00:47:41,674
super simple tests so it could be that 
their brains tiny though they are 

1056
00:47:44,471 --> 00:47:45,304
dedicated to a particular way of solving
a particular problem because it's 

1057
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,833
especially these ones that live in new 
caledonia do this in the wild and so 

1058
00:47:51,851 --> 00:47:53,470
they they fashioned amount of palm 
fronds,

1059
00:47:53,471 --> 00:47:54,304
they tear it off and they reshape it and
then they hook insects out of the bark 

1060
00:47:57,071 --> 00:47:57,904
of trees and stuff.
And so you could imagine that they've 

1061
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,020
kind oF learned a specific way of 
problem solving,

1062
00:48:02,021 --> 00:48:02,854
but they can't do something that to you 
because you would solve that using some 

1063
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:07,960
pretty domain general mechanisms to you 
looks the same.

1064
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:09,040
But to them it's totally different.

1065
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:13,390
Did you find a thing with the ringtones?
It's really crazy.

1066
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,820
It's just a.
Well,

1067
00:48:15,821 --> 00:48:17,410
you know,
I'd read something.

1068
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:18,873
Here we go rank 10 spontaneously.
Ben straight wires into hooks to fish 

1069
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,580
for food,
which is amazing.

1070
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:26,920
Is they have a photo of a jamie if you 
scroll down a little bit there,

1071
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,270
but does that photo.
It's just.

1072
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:31,570
I'll just him with a stick.
yeah,

1073
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:32,650
that's really,
really cool.

1074
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,233
I had read something a few years back 
that said that they were agreeing that 

1075
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:41,560
chimpanzees had officially moved into 
the stone age.

1076
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:43,263
Yeah,
so chimpanzees were used stones as 

1077
00:48:44,681 --> 00:48:47,080
tools,
so they'll crack nuts with them,

1078
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,890
but they've never.
They've never been shown to modify stone

1079
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,230
tiles and so if you want to say the 
stone age,

1080
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,340
doosan stones,
by all means,

1081
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:56,010
if you want to say it's modifying 
stones.

1082
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,033
The the oldest evidence that we have 
potentially modified is three point 3 

1083
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,170
million years ago.
These lamech we tools,

1084
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,460
but there's argument about how legit 
those right.

1085
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,543
There's argument about a lot of those 
sites too where they believe that they 

1086
00:49:07,591 --> 00:49:08,424
find stone tools that are ancient 
because it could easily just spend 

1087
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,733
shale.

1088
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,950
Yeah.
And overwatch.

1089
00:49:12,951 --> 00:49:15,620
It's super complicated to know exactly 
when it got laid down,

1090
00:49:15,621 --> 00:49:17,720
everyone.
So I'll get lucky and the and the layers

1091
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,000
are super orderly and then when you get 
to that layer,

1092
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:20,834
you know exactly what you got,
but now what's the chances of finding 

1093
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:27,440
what you're after there?
Right now when they say the stone age,

1094
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:28,303
that's what they mean.
Just the idea of consciously using a 

1095
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:32,570
rock to like smash open a clam or 
something like that.

1096
00:49:32,571 --> 00:49:32,931
Yeah,
I mean,

1097
00:49:32,931 --> 00:49:33,820
to me that does.
I,

1098
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,100
I gotta I gotta admit I'm not quite sure
technically what an anthropologist would

1099
00:49:37,101 --> 00:49:39,300
mean when they say stone age,
but um,

1100
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,383
to what,
what we know is that chimps will do 

1101
00:49:42,081 --> 00:49:43,340
that.
They'll use rocks to,

1102
00:49:43,490 --> 00:49:44,323
they'll even,
if they're clever enough to have an 

1103
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:48,650
anvil basically like her hammer ball 
based on put a rock on it,

1104
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:49,820
smash what?

1105
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,653
They're not clever enough to do.
So chimps have partial theory of mind 

1106
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:54,933
and theory of mind is this idea that I 
know that the contents of your mind 

1107
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:58,364
differ from the contents of mine.
And all humans get there when they're 

1108
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:03,920
little around age four.
And so the.

1109
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:04,853
And you can see the penny drop because 
they just assume everybody knows the 

1110
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:09,330
same things and everybody's the same 
preferences and,

1111
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:10,760
and that's why when they're really 
little,

1112
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:11,594
their stories can be hard to follow 
because they assume what's in your head 

1113
00:50:13,821 --> 00:50:16,460
is the same as theirs.
They assume you liked the same things.

1114
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,473
And actually it turns out that the ones 
who have siblings learn it earlier 

1115
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:21,900
because like,
oh you like the red jellybeans.

1116
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,180
I like the green ones.
Awesome.

1117
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,220
This is a beneficial deal for both of 
us,

1118
00:50:25,221 --> 00:50:26,054
right?
Right.

1119
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,523
Anyway,
can get partial theory of mind so I 

1120
00:50:28,851 --> 00:50:30,300
could see what you could say.

1121
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,243
I know what you could see at your angle 
of how much chimp and I know that might 

1122
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:34,694
differ from what I could see,
but they can't get to the point of 

1123
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:39,860
knowing that you could represent beliefs
that aren't true,

1124
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:41,630
that you could have deeply,
etc.

1125
00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,300
Or that maybe I don't like bananas,
but he does like,

1126
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,163
but then they can't really get there.
And so what the problem is without 

1127
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:49,610
theory of mind,
how do you teach somebody?

1128
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,770
Because if I just assume you know what I
know,

1129
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,940
then when you're doing a crappy job 
breaking the net,

1130
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:55,430
I'm like,
what's wrong with joe here?

1131
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:00,410
And so chip mothers take years to to 
teach their offspring,

1132
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:03,350
to break these nuts open 10 years on 
average,

1133
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,393
because first of all,
they don't get a chance to do it very 

1134
00:51:05,241 --> 00:51:06,590
often.
Then that's got to be in season.

1135
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,810
Second of all,
it's easy to bReak your fingers and that

1136
00:51:08,811 --> 00:51:09,650
kind of slows you down.

1137
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,813
But third of all,
they'll occasionally make some very 

1138
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:16,130
specific corrections when the,
when the offspring is doing it wrong,

1139
00:51:16,370 --> 00:51:17,203
but they don't know what the problem is 
because they don't know what the kid 

1140
00:51:19,191 --> 00:51:20,024
doesn't know.
And so when you don't know that you 

1141
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,544
can't teach.
And that's why humans are stunningly 

1142
00:51:24,291 --> 00:51:27,080
effective teachers.
That's fascinating.

1143
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,130
So chimps learn more just by observing.
Yeah,

1144
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:31,964
and what's amazing about the way chimps 
observed is that because we have theory 

1145
00:51:34,881 --> 00:51:36,980
of mind,
we also do imitate differently.

1146
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:37,973
So there's this amazing experiment by 
andy white and his colleagues and what 

1147
00:51:40,131 --> 00:51:42,380
they did is they created this treasure 
box.

1148
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,710
And so inside this treasure box,
there is something that a chimp or a kid

1149
00:51:45,711 --> 00:51:46,544
wants,
like a little piece of food and in one 

1150
00:51:48,771 --> 00:51:49,604
condition the box is totally opaque so 
you can't see how it works and they'll 

1151
00:51:52,521 --> 00:51:53,354
poke at the top of it and then the poke 
in the middle and it pops open and then 

1152
00:51:56,361 --> 00:51:57,950
they give it to the chimp,
close it up.

1153
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,390
Chimp does the exact same thing.
Poke,

1154
00:51:59,391 --> 00:51:59,811
poke,
poke,

1155
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:00,650
poke,
pops open,

1156
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:02,450
give it to a kid,
does the exact same thing.

1157
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:03,763
Now they do the,
they do the replicate that same 

1158
00:52:05,451 --> 00:52:06,284
experiment,
but instead of having that box be 

1159
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,384
opaque,
it's translucent and you can see well 

1160
00:52:10,251 --> 00:52:11,990
and truly the poking the top does 
nothing.

1161
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,033
The latch is actually right here and so 
that initial poke was a waste of your 

1162
00:52:15,681 --> 00:52:16,514
time.
This second one actually is one that 

1163
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:21,440
opened the box up when when chimps watch
that,

1164
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,960
they skip the first one and they just 
opened the box.

1165
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:28,910
Kids despite being smarter than a chimp 
poke at the top first and then they poke

1166
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:31,760
it in the bottom and we call this over 
imitation.

1167
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,640
They're imitating clearly irrelevant 
actions.

1168
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,953
Now,
why would anybody imitate clearly 

1169
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:39,110
irrelevant actions?
WhAt advantage would it give you?

1170
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,730
Well,
if you have theory of mind,

1171
00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:42,770
you say,
well that's joe's box.

1172
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,340
He knows something about it.
There may be a reason why I can't see,

1173
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,710
but then maybe reason why he's poking at
the top first,

1174
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,570
and so I better do everything that he 
does.

1175
00:52:50,571 --> 00:52:51,404
I better have the highest fidelity 
copying that I possibly can because it 

1176
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:55,304
may be valuable.
And what you end up with is these 

1177
00:52:57,521 --> 00:52:58,354
systems around the world where people 
eat these amazing foods that you think 

1178
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,133
you know,
how on earth could they ever figured 

1179
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:03,890
that out?
Well,

1180
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:04,724
it was probably developed step by step 
and everybody's always got this super 

1181
00:53:07,281 --> 00:53:09,650
high fidelity imitation because they're 
over imitating.

1182
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,000
So my favorite examples in new Guinea,
they,

1183
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:12,843
the sago palm,
I'm not sure if you've ever seen a sago 

1184
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:15,434
palm,
but it does not look like an edible 

1185
00:53:16,161 --> 00:53:17,870
tree.
It just looks like a free country.

1186
00:53:17,871 --> 00:53:19,830
Right?
And it turns out that if you,

1187
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:23,000
you chop the tree down,
take the bark off,

1188
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,040
take like an ads or something similar,
grind up the sawdust,

1189
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,210
have all that sawdust.

1190
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,093
you then wash it off in warm water 
because of course all the water in new 

1191
00:53:30,211 --> 00:53:32,190
Guinea will be nice and warm,
and that causes.

1192
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:33,024
It's a super high starch tree that 
causes the starch molecules to separate 

1193
00:53:35,941 --> 00:53:37,710
from the sawdust because at that point 
it's inevitable.

1194
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,670
So then they have these cloth and the 
starch molecules pass through the cloth,

1195
00:53:41,671 --> 00:53:44,220
the sawdust one.
Now they collect this cloudy water.

1196
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,560
They put in these traditional canoes,
they let it sit overnight and all of the

1197
00:53:47,561 --> 00:53:50,850
starts sinks to the bottom.
Then they pour the water off the top and

1198
00:53:50,851 --> 00:53:51,684
now they've got this flower.
But you have to dry it out in the sun 

1199
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,540
really faster.
It becomes toxic.

1200
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:58,050
So it's like this nine step process that
who on earth could ever come up with it,

1201
00:53:58,051 --> 00:53:59,970
right?
But once it's in place,

1202
00:53:59,971 --> 00:54:02,130
once they slowly figured it out to make 
it work,

1203
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,830
everybody just does it the same way 
because even though they don't know,

1204
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,570
they may understand it,
but they don't need to.

1205
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:07,910
They just know this is how we do.

1206
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,980
Well,
that's like that.

1207
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:13,300
What is that root that they cassava?
Yeah.

1208
00:54:13,370 --> 00:54:14,203
That if you don't cook it correctly,
it's literally cyanide and they have 

1209
00:54:18,961 --> 00:54:22,260
water from and they have to take that 
water and they have the buckets of these

1210
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:23,094
water,
the water for that they're using to 

1211
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,263
create this stuff and they just leave it
laying around and kids are playing 

1212
00:54:30,361 --> 00:54:33,360
around it and the pigs and animals 
around it.

1213
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:35,250
And if they drank it,
they'd be dead.

1214
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,113
Yeah.
I don't know.

1215
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:37,740
I don't know.
The detoxing of cassava.

1216
00:54:37,741 --> 00:54:39,450
Unfortunate I'm not.
I'm not familiar with that.

1217
00:54:39,451 --> 00:54:42,540
But there's a lot of those examples and 
you're also right that in those kinds of

1218
00:54:42,541 --> 00:54:43,374
societies,
they're super relaxed about things that 

1219
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:46,430
we strike the strike.

1220
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,310
Kill you quote.
Exactly.

1221
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,110
But that's tough.
it.

1222
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,800
It becomes cyanide,
right?

1223
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,390
You could be right.
I don't know that one.

1224
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,740
See if you could find this because it's 
on an episode of that same show.

1225
00:54:56,741 --> 00:54:57,574
It's this show is called meat eater.
It's my friend steve who went and spent 

1226
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:04,210
some time with them down in the jungle 
south America.

1227
00:55:04,211 --> 00:55:05,044
It's really interesting stuff.
Just seeing how these people function 

1228
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:09,274
and and they have this big vat and 
they're cooking this stuff and he was 

1229
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,640
explaining like right now if you hate 
it,

1230
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,000
you're dead.
You got to wait a while and like,

1231
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:22,200
how the fuck did they figure this out?
Researchers to get to the sinai.

1232
00:55:22,201 --> 00:55:23,034
Oh,
cyanide producing abilities because I 

1233
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,270
was the third most important food source
in tropical countries,

1234
00:55:28,271 --> 00:55:29,104
but as one major problem,
the roots and the leaves of poorly 

1235
00:55:30,821 --> 00:55:31,654
processed cassava plants contain a 
substance that when eaten can trigger 

1236
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:37,030
the production of cyanide,
kills the shit out of you.

1237
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,800
But it's weird that that thing is like a
major staple in their diet.

1238
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:44,020
Well,
this is a really good example of a,

1239
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:47,410
the value of human learning and this 
over invitation process,

1240
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:48,430
right?
Because the first guy where they go,

1241
00:55:48,431 --> 00:55:49,390
okay,
I'm not going to do that.

1242
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:50,243
Right?
And then this person aided unaided 

1243
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,290
successful.
Let's take a look at what they did.

1244
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:54,503
So I remember when I was a kid,
I was turned to learn to play baseball 

1245
00:55:56,981 --> 00:56:00,640
and pitch the ball and the person raises
their knee almost up to their nipples.

1246
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,653
And I'm like,
that's the most awkward pitching motion 

1247
00:56:03,371 --> 00:56:05,230
I've ever seen.
But I didn't occur to me.

1248
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,460
I'm not going to do that.
Right?

1249
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,570
It occurred me.
Well,

1250
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,080
there must be a reason to do that.
So,

1251
00:56:09,081 --> 00:56:09,914
um,
what can I do to try to emulate that 

1252
00:56:11,651 --> 00:56:12,484
motion?
Right?

1253
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,433
Right.
The whole,

1254
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,900
the whole nine yards.
There's a purpose for every one of those

1255
00:56:16,901 --> 00:56:18,700
pieces.
And as humans we're saying,

1256
00:56:18,701 --> 00:56:19,534
well,
you're teaching me how you've got to 

1257
00:56:20,861 --> 00:56:21,694
have a reason for doing that.
And that's the huge between us and 

1258
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:24,430
everybody

1259
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:25,263
else.
Nobody else can do that theory of mind 

1260
00:56:26,441 --> 00:56:29,560
thing to make that assumption.
And that's why the chimps skip that step

1261
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:30,394
that they,
that they know at least in that 

1262
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,780
particular tournament is really actually
useless and kids don't.

1263
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:35,410
So

1264
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,243
you're a concept is that as these 
animals that used to be monkeys start 

1265
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:42,343
evolving and trying out new things,
one thing that they learn as they enter 

1266
00:56:46,131 --> 00:56:49,090
into this new climate as if there's a 
massive benefit to.

1267
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,910
Yes.
Now I would say it's not monkeys because

1268
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:55,170
technically speaking aren't all apes 
monkeys,

1269
00:56:55,171 --> 00:56:57,170
but not all monkeys or apes?
No.

1270
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,390
So a monkeys and apes are different.
They split off a month.

1271
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,653
He's not a real word.
I mean it's not a word in terms of 

1272
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:05,540
scientific designation,

1273
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,410
right?
Even the monkey of two different things.

1274
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,380
Right?
But there's.

1275
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:10,140
There's old world monkeys in new world 
monkeys,

1276
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,670
but all of them have a genus and species
that.

1277
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:15,600
But it's not a scientific name,
right?

1278
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:18,240
There's a key's not now they're 
primates.

1279
00:57:18,241 --> 00:57:20,130
They're all privates.
What did I read?

1280
00:57:20,131 --> 00:57:21,960
The cv?
Google that google.

1281
00:57:21,961 --> 00:57:22,800
There was a whole

1282
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,540
bullet.
Anthropologist wrote that.

1283
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,660
Not all apes or monkeys,
but all monkey.

1284
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,240
No,
not all monkeys or apes,

1285
00:57:30,241 --> 00:57:33,600
but all apes or monkeys because monkeys 
almost a slang term

1286
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,930
because it's bullshit.
I think it's bullshit,

1287
00:57:35,931 --> 00:57:36,764
but we'll find out that what I would say
is it all apes and monkeys are primates 

1288
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:42,560
and they all started from monkey 
ancestry.

1289
00:57:42,561 --> 00:57:43,394
Right,
right.

1290
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:45,290
And so.
But then the ape split off.

1291
00:57:45,291 --> 00:57:47,720
You've got to rang content.
The great apes are orangutans,

1292
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,190
gorillas,
chimps and us,

1293
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,410
and then you got gibbons which are 
lesser apes,

1294
00:57:51,411 --> 00:57:54,110
which split off quite a while ago and 
they're very different.

1295
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:55,820
They don't have the brain power of the 
great apes.

1296
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,240
Do you find anything like that?
I read this a few years ago.

1297
00:57:59,241 --> 00:58:02,920
Was it confused the shit out of me 
because I didn't know that monkey wasn't

1298
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:03,910
a scientific term.

1299
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:04,743
Well,
scientists talk about old world monkeys 

1300
00:58:05,411 --> 00:58:09,840
in new world,
but it's almost a slang term as well.

1301
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,960
Whenever you're.
If you're.

1302
00:58:11,050 --> 00:58:11,883
If you're a prepper biologist and you 
have the species and say that was a 

1303
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,910
chimpanzee is thing I found.
Is it like pen light source,

1304
00:58:18,911 --> 00:58:19,744
but it pops up

1305
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,590
on google.
Okay.

1306
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:22,850
Comes up,
but it's a longer.

1307
00:58:22,851 --> 00:58:23,684
It's there's more to it.
Apes or monkeys in the same way that 

1308
00:58:27,081 --> 00:58:30,380
monkeys are primates.
Humans are apes and I am a human.

1309
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,000
It's called the nested hierarchy.
That's right.

1310
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:36,140
It means that all apes or monkeys,
but not all monkeys or apes,

1311
00:58:36,141 --> 00:58:37,850
just as all humans are.
Abe's,

1312
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:40,080
but not all apes are humans.
Okay.

1313
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,740
Yeah.
Zygoma per click on that link.

1314
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,710
They get someone's website at.
Yeah.

1315
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:47,300
This is what I read.
Now,

1316
00:58:47,301 --> 00:58:49,160
is this a.
Is this a bullshit article?

1317
00:58:49,161 --> 00:58:50,360
I don't know.
Sorry.

1318
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,640
Apes or monkeys deal with it.
That's another term.

1319
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:56,420
I don't know the origin of the term.
Mark martin robbins wrote a fun piece to

1320
00:58:56,421 --> 00:58:58,720
the lay scientists the other day,
the incorrect term.

1321
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,573
These monkeys described apes.
It triggered an article by graham smith 

1322
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:04,250
for the daily mail.
In martin's words,

1323
00:59:04,251 --> 00:59:05,084
a great crime against entry is in 
progress and it's time for someone to 

1324
00:59:10,101 --> 00:59:12,040
draw a line.
So as a parent,

1325
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,150
how do yoU say that pen

1326
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,050
today?
Antic.

1327
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,350
Yeah,
but I never stood by itself,

1328
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:17,323
uh,
with a professional interest in the 

1329
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:20,480
issue.
I'm taking my stand to help ensure the,

1330
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,640
that a miscarriage of pedantic

1331
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,250
justice doesn't occur.
That guy likes that word.

1332
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:27,620
Um,
nested hierarchies.

1333
00:59:27,650 --> 00:59:29,930
Apes or monkeys in the same way that 
monkeys are primates.

1334
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,580
Humans are abe's.
And I'm a human,

1335
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,920
it's called a nested hierarchy and he 
has a primate nested hierarchy setup.

1336
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:36,830
Could be right.
I just don't know.

1337
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:37,664
I don't know the origin of the term,
but he cares and he cares enough to put 

1338
00:59:40,581 --> 00:59:41,301
that up.
Yeah,

1339
00:59:41,301 --> 00:59:43,020
he fucked my head up.
Just dude.

1340
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,310
You could be right or not right.
He's,

1341
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,300
if anybody's right,
he's right or you're right.

1342
00:59:48,970 --> 00:59:50,210
No,
no knowledge.

1343
00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:51,203
But all I mean is that.
So the ancestors who moved to the 

1344
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:56,060
savannah weren't monkeys like baboon 
monkeys,

1345
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:59,660
chimp,
ancient chimp.

1346
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:02,660
And so once we get tome erectus,
they're Basically like us,

1347
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:06,140
although there are brains there around 
nine 60 were around 13,

1348
01:00:06,141 --> 01:00:09,260
15 and we literally have a chimp brain 
added on top of there.

1349
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:11,690
So There's a big difference and you're 
absolutely right.

1350
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:15,740
It's accelerating like crazy.
And I am totally convinced.

1351
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:17,120
Well I believe rang gms,
right?

1352
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,100
I mean we don't know for sure of course,
but I believe he's right,

1353
01:00:19,101 --> 01:00:21,470
that it was fired.
They played a huge role in that.

1354
01:00:21,710 --> 01:00:22,543
And so what you got is this process,
where are our evolution facilitates a 

1355
01:00:25,101 --> 01:00:26,090
further evolution,
right?

1356
01:00:26,091 --> 01:00:26,924
So you get the cognitive capacities to 
control fire and now that allows you to 

1357
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:32,450
grow your brain even larger.
Because we can,

1358
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,313
we can store fat,
we can get more nutrients from the food 

1359
01:00:34,851 --> 01:00:37,280
we eat,
we can detoxify other things.

1360
01:00:37,450 --> 01:00:38,283
Fire super valuable.
Even chimps will eat if they go through 

1361
01:00:40,821 --> 01:00:42,320
a area where there's a forest fire and 
you know,

1362
01:00:42,321 --> 01:00:46,400
speaking to what's going on locally,
they'll eat like the roasted nuts first.

1363
01:00:46,401 --> 01:00:48,180
They really liked that because I mean,
you know,

1364
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,660
just you go in your kitchen,
you smell a raw steak.

1365
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:53,270
It's like palatable.
You smell it when it's cooking.

1366
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:55,440
It's delicious or that is interesting,
right?

1367
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,353
That's us.
No salt or anything on our nose telling 

1368
01:00:58,341 --> 01:01:01,550
us that is a great source of food and 
nutrients.

1369
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,470
That's not so much.
That is interesting.

1370
01:01:03,471 --> 01:01:05,510
I've never thought about it that way,
but yeah,

1371
01:01:05,511 --> 01:01:06,344
there's a tremendous difference in the 
way your body reacts to it and it's not 

1372
01:01:09,471 --> 01:01:13,710
just based on your experience eating it.
It just smells amazing.

1373
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:15,800
It smells amazing and so random talks 
about.

1374
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:16,634
he argues that you can't live on a diet 
of raw food unless you're reading these 

1375
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:21,523
super fruits and stuff like that,
that basically we've horticulture into 

1376
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:27,140
existence because raw food just doesn't 
give you enough calories.

1377
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,260
So the example that he uses,
which is a great one,

1378
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:34,730
is chimps literally spent something like
six to eight hours a day chewing just to

1379
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:37,670
soften up the food enough so that they 
can swallow it and digest it.

1380
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:39,980
You know,
if sushi you're hardly,

1381
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:40,814
you know,
some of the things that we cooked and 

1382
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:43,130
that's all in that case,
but you know,

1383
01:01:43,131 --> 01:01:44,450
cooked steak,
I really nice one.

1384
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:46,750
You barely chew it at all.
It's just down the hatch.

1385
01:01:46,751 --> 01:01:47,584
It goes.
So that's a great argument for gorillas 

1386
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:49,671
as well,
right?

1387
01:01:49,671 --> 01:01:50,504
Because gorillas are just eating roots,
fucking celery and so literally they 

1388
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:56,720
have a humongous got right constantly 
chewing in order to me and they've got a

1389
01:01:56,721 --> 01:01:57,554
huge,
the sagittal crest right here with the 

1390
01:01:58,311 --> 01:01:59,144
bone so that the muscles attached to it 
so they can chew hard enough to get 

1391
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:04,160
through all that stuff and make a 
digestible and still there.

1392
01:02:04,161 --> 01:02:05,450
God is enormous.
Yeah,

1393
01:02:05,451 --> 01:02:06,284
that is interesting.
The chimps have those enormous chewing 

1394
01:02:07,881 --> 01:02:08,714
muscles on their head and so we lost.
That's another example where somebody 

1395
01:02:11,481 --> 01:02:14,270
along the way last,
I can't remember what that gene was,

1396
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,880
where our muscles weakened in our jaw 
and that would have been a year.

1397
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,710
That would have been a death knell if 
you're back cooking,

1398
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:20,000
right

1399
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,833
post cooking.
All that does is free up space for get 

1400
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:25,770
rid of some unnecessary muscle,
free up morris cranio space for brains,

1401
01:02:25,771 --> 01:02:27,180
the inside,
not the outside,

1402
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:28,163
so is it likely that there was a bunch 
of different factors that there was 

1403
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:31,734
natural selection in play and that there
was also the the throwing arm and then 

1404
01:02:35,731 --> 01:02:36,564
also cooking and also this,
this cooperative effort that led to 

1405
01:02:41,671 --> 01:02:43,830
people being a little bit more 
ingenious,

1406
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:44,773
a little bit smarter and how they hunted
and how they tried to get food and then 

1407
01:02:48,691 --> 01:02:51,780
how they protected their fire,
how they cultivated fire,

1408
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:52,833
and that all these things lead to more 
clever behavior which led to a natural 

1409
01:02:56,641 --> 01:02:57,474
selection of clever,
more clever champs with larger brains 

1410
01:03:00,511 --> 01:03:03,140
are apes rather with larger brains?
Absolutely,

1411
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:05,580
and so anytime you got something major 
happening,

1412
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:06,414
it probably doesn't have a single cause,
it probably has lots and lots of causes 

1413
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:12,420
and so in this case all these kinds of 
factors came together.

1414
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,480
Now if you're standing at the outset and
you're playing god and saying,

1415
01:03:15,481 --> 01:03:16,314
well,
let's see what happens when I dry out 

1416
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:17,694
the rain forest,
I think nine times out of 10 the chimps 

1417
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:20,910
all end up dead,
right?

1418
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,833
But somehow we got really lucky and they
went down this very particular road and 

1419
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,950
once they got their social act together 
and they started cooperating,

1420
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,053
chimps are never going to be very 
effective in groups because they can't 

1421
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:33,330
get along.
They can cooperate very well,

1422
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:34,543
but,
but once these animals probably had us 

1423
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:37,230
fill a pivot,
gus,

1424
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,063
but maybe not till later.
Of course we don't know all we can look 

1425
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:40,674
at what they were capable of,
but it fits the storyline that they 

1426
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,340
would have been the ones who develop 
that.

1427
01:03:44,341 --> 01:03:47,250
Once that happened,
social becomes everything.

1428
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:48,084
So we tend to think about what are the 
challenges of physical life like sago 

1429
01:03:52,651 --> 01:03:53,190
palm.

1430
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,560
You move into that territory and you got
to configure that out.

1431
01:03:55,561 --> 01:03:56,394
It seems enormously complicated,
but you have to remember that before 

1432
01:03:58,651 --> 01:03:59,484
modern travel was invented,
everybody walked everywhere which meant 

1433
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:02,723
you spent your entire life basically in 
territory that you're familiar with or 

1434
01:04:05,581 --> 01:04:06,414
the kinds of animals that lived there,
the kinds of problems that you face and 

1435
01:04:08,671 --> 01:04:09,504
so cognitively the terrain is not really
a challenge for you and how to even 

1436
01:04:12,751 --> 01:04:15,810
making food in those really complicated 
ways is not a challenge for you.

1437
01:04:15,811 --> 01:04:17,880
Once you got theory of mind and you can 
learn how to do it,

1438
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:22,140
but what is a huge challenge for you is 
the social interactions with each other.

1439
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,350
Because as my group gets smarter,
if I'm not smarter for sole member,

1440
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:27,870
we talked about sexual selection.
I'm not going to get picked.

1441
01:04:27,871 --> 01:04:29,880
I'll get left behind.
Second of all,

1442
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:32,040
we live in a world where there's no law 
enforcement,

1443
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:35,150
and so the day that you decide that I'm 
more troubled than I'm worth,

1444
01:04:35,151 --> 01:04:35,820
I'd go to sleep on.

1445
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:36,653
I never wake up again,
and so I have to be able to manage some 

1446
01:04:38,671 --> 01:04:41,460
very complicated relationships.
It's a little bit in my mind,

1447
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,990
it's like every morning when you wake 
up,

1448
01:04:42,991 --> 01:04:43,824
it's to an episode of the sopranos.
How are you going to find a way to get 

1449
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:47,700
through your day without getting 
whacked?

1450
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:49,500
Right?
And if you can't figure it out,

1451
01:04:49,560 --> 01:04:53,700
that's the end of your life.
Have you ever read any terence mckenna?

1452
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:56,730
I know you're familiar with something 
called the stoned ape theory.

1453
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,291
No,
sorry,

1454
01:04:58,291 --> 01:04:59,520
not mckenna.
It was,

1455
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:00,450
uh,
he was,

1456
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:01,284
uh,
an ethnobotanist and he was also a 

1457
01:05:02,820 --> 01:05:05,310
psychedelic adventure and he had a 
theory.

1458
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:09,450
And the theory was that the,
what you're talking about,

1459
01:05:09,451 --> 01:05:14,370
this climate change that also coincided 
with a doubling of the human brain size.

1460
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:18,130
His theory was that one of the things 
that was

1461
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:18,963
in play was that these apes would 
experiment with different food sources 

1462
01:05:22,121 --> 01:05:22,954
as they moved into the grasslands and 
there was a lot of undulates and these 

1463
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:26,824
grasslands and it siliciden mushrooms,
which we know existed back then would 

1464
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:34,730
grow in these grasslands and that these 
monkeys,

1465
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,583
apes rather started consuming siliciden 
mushrooms and it led them to be more 

1466
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:39,664
creative.
And it also led to specific traits like 

1467
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:42,603
the development of language that eating 
mushrooms in low doses increases visual 

1468
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:50,110
acuity,
which would lead them to be better.

1469
01:05:50,111 --> 01:05:53,920
Hunters are more perceptive.
It also leads them to be hornier,

1470
01:05:54,370 --> 01:05:58,750
which would most likely involve more 
breeding,

1471
01:05:58,930 --> 01:05:59,763
more sexual activity,
and possibly select the ones that chose 

1472
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,173
the mushrooms would maybe possibly breed
more than the ones that didn't choose 

1473
01:06:09,401 --> 01:06:11,350
the mushrooms because they were more 
into it.

1474
01:06:11,351 --> 01:06:15,280
And then we're more social,
more sexually active.

1475
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:18,480
And he has a series of,
uh,

1476
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,940
like his brother dennis,
who's still alive,

1477
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,133
detailed it on a podcast we did the very
first podcast we did in his brother is 

1478
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:28,720
an,
as is an actual scientist.

1479
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:29,913
And detailed it in terms of how silicide
affects the brain and what areas of the 

1480
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:37,360
brain it,
what,

1481
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:38,253
what,
what actually takes place when you're 

1482
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:41,134
under the influence of this and that it 
could very potentially have led to the 

1483
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:48,760
development of language and that this,
all these things in play,

1484
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:49,594
the throwing arm,
the developing these new social 

1485
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:54,600
networks,
uh,

1486
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:55,633
where you need to communicate with each 
other along with the harnessing of fire 

1487
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:04,660
along with the consumption of 
psychedelic mushrooms on a regular basis

1488
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:06,940
because they were incredibly frequent 
and very admirable.

1489
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,110
Right?
That's total trip.

1490
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:09,690
I've never heard of that.
Fascinating.

1491
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,723
It would be really like,
that's a really good example of some 

1492
01:07:12,121 --> 01:07:14,340
random thing if it really did play that 
role,

1493
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:15,353
how random that is,
that these freaking things happen to be 

1494
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:19,590
growing there and that they happen to be
attracted to them and ate them.

1495
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:23,760
We know that animals like to get high.
I'm elephants will eat these fruits that

1496
01:07:23,761 --> 01:07:26,850
have well the drunk in this case,
overripe and,

1497
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:29,850
and have become alcoholic.
We know that animals will do that.

1498
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:30,733
you've seen jaguars that consumed 
psychedelic plants and they rely on 

1499
01:07:33,171 --> 01:07:35,840
their back and stare at the sky and no.
Oh,

1500
01:07:35,841 --> 01:07:38,300
it's amazing.
But you know what iowasca is?

1501
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,180
No.
Iowasca is a,

1502
01:07:42,470 --> 01:07:44,420
it's a way that,
uh,

1503
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:45,673
these people in the rain forest develop 
untold thousands of years ago of 

1504
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,290
developing an orally active version of 
dimethyltryptamine.

1505
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:58,070
Do you know what their mental tryptamine
dimethyltryptamine is?

1506
01:07:58,071 --> 01:08:00,040
The most potent psychedelic known to 
man.

1507
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:04,700
It's incredibly potent drug that is just
intensely hallucinatory.

1508
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:08,410
Gives you these insane visions.
And it also is this.

1509
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:11,000
Here's a jaguar.
It's really crazy.

1510
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,043
And this is in the amazon.
These jaguars eat these plants and 

1511
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:20,260
plants are the,
they have the ingredients of iowasca and

1512
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:21,644
these jaguars are known to eat these 
things and then trip her fucking balls 

1513
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:25,244
off.
they eat them and there are pupils 

1514
01:08:26,241 --> 01:08:29,060
dilate and they roll over on their back 
and stare at the sky.

1515
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,480
I mean,
they're clearly high.

1516
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,210
So this is something that you're going 
to say,

1517
01:08:33,211 --> 01:08:34,160
yeah,
this is what I'm gonna say.

1518
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,173
So this is what iowasca is,
is dimethyltryptamine look kind of cool 

1519
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:43,650
watching this jaguar trip balls.
They just stare.

1520
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,600
They see shit that's not there,
I mean,

1521
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:48,020
or it is.
They're still traveling.

1522
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:52,100
It's amazing.
So what iowasca is is w,

1523
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:53,203
there's dimethyltryptamine,
which is this incredibly potent 

1524
01:08:55,611 --> 01:08:57,740
psychedelic drug is produced in the 
human body.

1525
01:08:57,741 --> 01:09:00,650
It's produced by the liver.
It's produced by the lungs,

1526
01:09:00,651 --> 01:09:03,200
and they also believe it's produced by 
the pineal gland,

1527
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:04,063
which is literally your third eye,
the pineal gland in certain reptiles 

1528
01:09:07,551 --> 01:09:09,830
actually as a rep,
a retina in a lens.

1529
01:09:10,130 --> 01:09:10,963
I mean it's like an eyeball and they 
think that the egyptians called it the 

1530
01:09:14,211 --> 01:09:18,470
seed of the soul and they think that 
this is one of the reasons why they have

1531
01:09:18,471 --> 01:09:23,300
this obsession with this gland in 
eastern mysticism is somehow or another,

1532
01:09:23,301 --> 01:09:24,134
they figured out that this is the gland 
that produces this incredibly potent 

1533
01:09:27,801 --> 01:09:28,640
psychedelic truck.

1534
01:09:29,030 --> 01:09:29,863
This psychedelic drug dimethyltryptAmine
also exists in thousands of different 

1535
01:09:33,171 --> 01:09:34,004
plants.
The problem is when you consume it 

1536
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,480
orally,
your body produces something in your gut

1537
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:41,990
called monoamine oxidase,
and monoamine oxidase breaks it down.

1538
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,033
So what these indigenous people figured 
out is how to combine one plant which 

1539
01:09:47,691 --> 01:09:48,524
contains this psychedelic compound with 
another plant which contains a natural 

1540
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:55,820
mao inhibitor called harming.
So they brew this all together,

1541
01:09:55,821 --> 01:09:56,654
much like they did the cassava,
which we have no idea how they figured 

1542
01:09:58,851 --> 01:09:59,684
that out.
They bring this stuff up together and 

1543
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:04,310
they create this psychedelic t called 
iowasca and iowasca.

1544
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:05,144
Now they have all these trips where 
people go down to Peru and take this 

1545
01:10:08,211 --> 01:10:11,840
stuff and trip to fucking balls off.
And this,

1546
01:10:11,841 --> 01:10:12,860
uh,
this,

1547
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:17,930
the combination of these things leads to
this incredibly potent trench,

1548
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:24,950
really transformative experience,
which is impossible to describe and that

1549
01:10:24,951 --> 01:10:26,840
this,
this psychedelic drug.

1550
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:27,920
Why?
Why did I bring that up?

1551
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,590
Was what we were talking about how maybe
chimps and are these early ancestors did

1552
01:10:32,591 --> 01:10:33,424
something similar which pushed them 
along this path that starting to 

1553
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:36,660
communicate.
How did I get it?

1554
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,450
Wow.
How did I get the iowaSca?

1555
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:40,943
There are a couple of links in that 
chain is because of animals that get 

1556
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:43,750
high.
That's,

1557
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:46,350
that's what it was.
So this is what this.

1558
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,000
That's exactly what it was.
It was,

1559
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,010
yeah.
The jaguar getting high on dmt,

1560
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:51,420
that's what they think.
The jaguar,

1561
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:55,530
it's the jaguar consuming this stuff.
It's making them trip on dmt.

1562
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,990
Dmt is.
I mean it's fun.

1563
01:10:58,170 --> 01:11:00,180
it's really exciting.
And so that's.

1564
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:01,133
So robert trevors is wonderful biologist
who started a lot of the kinds of work 

1565
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:06,300
that we're talking about going in the 
seventies,

1566
01:11:06,660 --> 01:11:09,120
calls these sorts of things of 
phenotypic intelligence,

1567
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:09,954
right?
So evolution gave you these pleasure 

1568
01:11:11,491 --> 01:11:12,324
centers in your brain so that you do in 
your genes best interests and kill the 

1569
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:18,630
animal or get the girl or whatever and 
that makes you feel good.

1570
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:21,480
And so we tend to like the things that 
are good for us in dislike,

1571
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:23,400
the things that are bad for us.
We don't want to eat feces,

1572
01:11:23,401 --> 01:11:24,234
we do on a to stick.
So there's cases like this where it 

1573
01:11:27,601 --> 01:11:29,610
short circuits that it goes right to the
pleasure center.

1574
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:31,590
Even though what it's doing,
it's kind of irrelevant,

1575
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,340
but this is a case where maybe it wasn't
irrelevant.

1576
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:35,183
Maybe it actually causes animals to then
change the way that they behave to 

1577
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:38,520
become more sociable.

1578
01:11:38,730 --> 01:11:39,690
Right.
It's very possible.

1579
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:42,180
Something like that played a role along 
the way,

1580
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:46,440
which is why if you replay the sequence,
the vanishing rainforest 10 times,

1581
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:47,393
only one time does it maybe lead to 
anything good and the other nine times 

1582
01:11:49,961 --> 01:11:52,890
that leads to a bunch of dead chimps.
Yeah.

1583
01:11:52,950 --> 01:11:55,650
Well the the process is probably 
incredibly slow,

1584
01:11:55,651 --> 01:11:56,484
right?
Over millions of years of the climate 

1585
01:11:57,631 --> 01:11:58,464
did alter was right,
so you've got millions of years for the 

1586
01:12:00,001 --> 01:12:02,460
rain forest to disappear,
so you get these animals to slowly,

1587
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:03,690
slowly say,
I've got no choice.

1588
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:07,410
So they figure it out and then I think 
for three and a half million years,

1589
01:12:07,411 --> 01:12:10,710
literally there's skulking around the 
edges and they figured nothing out,

1590
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,490
but there was a pressure on them to walk
up.

1591
01:12:13,491 --> 01:12:14,324
Right.
And nobody knows for sure what that 

1592
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:18,090
pressure is.
One hypothesis that has some possible.

1593
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:19,530
There's probably a lot of reasons,
right?

1594
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:21,870
Any time something big happens is 
probably a lot of causes.

1595
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:23,033
So some people said that you can cover 
ground more efficiently when you walk 

1596
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:25,501
up.
Right?

1597
01:12:25,501 --> 01:12:26,334
With fewer calories,
and especially this idea of slowly 

1598
01:12:28,681 --> 01:12:29,514
running down animals.
You may have heard about this notion of 

1599
01:12:31,170 --> 01:12:34,160
persistence hunting exactly and talked 
about that yesterday.

1600
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:35,720
And so,
um,

1601
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,480
the uh,
but another reason is so ask yourself,

1602
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:42,480
so why would an animal,
so if we back up a little bit,

1603
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:43,314
remember I talked about how older one 
tools which are made even later than 

1604
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:51,780
when we first started walking upright.
So there even after that,

1605
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:52,823
all the tools are never carried it.
Integrate distance from where they are 

1606
01:12:54,650 --> 01:12:57,210
acquired inmate.
And so what you have is an animal,

1607
01:12:57,211 --> 01:12:59,550
just like today's chimps,
they can't plan for tomorrow.

1608
01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:02,880
So a chimp can plan for needs that are 
currently feels,

1609
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:03,811
it can say,
oh,

1610
01:13:03,811 --> 01:13:08,100
I want to go get 'em termites out of 
that mound all break the stick off.

1611
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,560
I'll strip the leaves and then I'll go 
over there and do that.

1612
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:11,603
But it can't plan for the fact that it 
might have that need again tomorrow if 

1613
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:18,240
it doesn't feel the need can plan for it
and humans can plan for unfelt needs.

1614
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:19,193
And the best example of that is notion 
of taking a tool with you that you've 

1615
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,470
now used in st.
Well,

1616
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:23,970
I want to use it again tomorrow,
right,

1617
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,373
so whichever.
Also a pythagoras was the first one to 

1618
01:13:27,961 --> 01:13:28,794
start walking upright was almost 
assuredly incapable of planning for the 

1619
01:13:32,311 --> 01:13:36,650
future for unfilled needs,
but it could plan for felt needs because

1620
01:13:36,660 --> 01:13:37,493
the chimp can do that too.
And if you think about how would you 

1621
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:40,314
feel if you're about to walk across the 
open savannah and you're kind of small 

1622
01:13:42,871 --> 01:13:44,850
and leopards and lions are way faster 
than you.

1623
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,040
I think the primary thing could feel his
fear like,

1624
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:47,874
oh shit,
I'm going to get attacked and so I want 

1625
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:51,180
something in my hands to help me defend 
myself.

1626
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,100
Let's be.
You're a club,

1627
01:13:53,101 --> 01:13:53,934
a stick something.
And so what I suspect is a part of the 

1628
01:13:56,491 --> 01:14:01,050
process is my desire to hold something 
in my hand as I'm looking around and I'm

1629
01:14:01,051 --> 01:14:05,010
scared and a bunch of us are doing that 
and so I suspect that that's what led to

1630
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:05,993
played a role in leading to bipedalism.
There would have been other factors at 

1631
01:14:08,041 --> 01:14:11,290
play like persistence hunting and stuff,
but I suspect that came later.

1632
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,250
So whole actually

1633
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,810
holding a weapon might've led to the 
beginning of that just because you don't

1634
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:18,820
need to be a rocket scientist.
You're scAred now.

1635
01:14:18,821 --> 01:14:19,654
You want something to defend yourself.
Do we have evidence of them sharpening 

1636
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:24,220
sticks?
Will remember.

1637
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,040
So modern chimps who live on the 
savannah do sharpen sticks.

1638
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,200
Modern.
yeah.

1639
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:31,180
What do we have evidence of ancient man 
and we don't even.

1640
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:34,080
We don't even have sticks leftover for 
rectus.

1641
01:14:34,090 --> 01:14:34,923
We know they must have used them because
they're making some pretty complicated 

1642
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:37,564
stones.
And so surely they were sharpening 

1643
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:40,510
sticks,
but all of it's decade.

1644
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:41,373
So what year did we.
So we really don't know when they first 

1645
01:14:44,321 --> 01:14:47,890
started attaching these stone tools to 
sticks rail,

1646
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:49,930
waking axes,
spears.

1647
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:53,380
We know that that's happening very 
recently by homo sapiens.

1648
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:54,820
We don't know if it happened before 
that.

1649
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:58,120
If I had to guess,
I would say that homo erectus did that.

1650
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,280
If you look at the quality of other 
things that they've done.

1651
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:03,310
So for example,
there's this amazing site off the sea of

1652
01:15:03,311 --> 01:15:05,230
galilee.
It's about 700,000

1653
01:15:05,231 --> 01:15:06,250
years old.
So member humans,

1654
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:08,140
homo sapiens,
let's call it 300,000

1655
01:15:08,141 --> 01:15:10,000
years.
So now we're 700,000

1656
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:10,834
or so years ago and there's this 
elephant skull that's been turned over 

1657
01:15:13,871 --> 01:15:16,240
so that they can get access to the 
brain's friend.

1658
01:15:16,241 --> 01:15:19,210
This thing is unwieldy.
It's heavy as anything.

1659
01:15:19,211 --> 01:15:22,480
You got to have people working together 
to turn that thing over and there's even

1660
01:15:22,481 --> 01:15:26,170
a log underneath it that might've been 
used as a lever to kinda help plop thing

1661
01:15:26,171 --> 01:15:27,004
over.
So what you got is people are quite 

1662
01:15:28,121 --> 01:15:28,954
capable of working together.
They know what they're trying to 

1663
01:15:30,221 --> 01:15:31,990
achieve,
they know how to access those things.

1664
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:33,123
I suspect that they knew that they could
sharpen the stake or maybe even have to 

1665
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:37,720
put a stone to make it even better.

1666
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,420
It's just that we can't find any 
evidence for that.

1667
01:15:40,421 --> 01:15:42,100
At least not yet.
He wasn't there.

1668
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:42,934
Some certain really ancient evidence of 
cannibalism too because of the scrape 

1669
01:15:47,561 --> 01:15:48,394
marks inside of skulls and they think 
that they were scooping out brain 

1670
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:52,210
matter.
That's possible.

1671
01:15:52,211 --> 01:15:54,610
I haven't seen those data,
but absolutely you can see where they've

1672
01:15:54,611 --> 01:15:57,220
used those tools on like the legs of 
animals and things like that.

1673
01:15:57,221 --> 01:15:58,950
So you'd see it inside the skull as 
well.

1674
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:00,930
A human skull that,
um,

1675
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:02,073
I'm sure you're aware of that little 
person that was discovered just a few 

1676
01:16:06,940 --> 01:16:07,773
years ago.
I think it was like a decade or so ago 

1677
01:16:08,921 --> 01:16:11,530
that on Indonesia and a flores.
Yeah.

1678
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:14,890
Yeah.
They think that little person type thing

1679
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,690
using stone tools,
right?

1680
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:18,100
Yes.
Those guys.

1681
01:16:18,101 --> 01:16:18,934
So remember there.
So what happened about one point 6 

1682
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,260
million years ago,
we'll call it one point seven,

1683
01:16:23,261 --> 01:16:24,250
I don't remember exactly.

1684
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:26,860
homo erectus leaves africa,
but they also stay.

1685
01:16:27,190 --> 01:16:28,023
So you got home rectus basically 
colonizing all of africa and you've got 

1686
01:16:30,281 --> 01:16:32,380
homo erectus colonizing almost all of 
europe,

1687
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,260
all of southern asia.
And so they don't,

1688
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,390
they don't go beyond that,
at least not to our knowledge.

1689
01:16:37,391 --> 01:16:39,370
Maybe they dId,
but um,

1690
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:43,330
but they certainly covered all that 
ground and an outside of.

1691
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:46,480
So now you've got homo erectus in africa
and homo erectus outside of africa.

1692
01:16:46,481 --> 01:16:47,314
And of course then overtime,
both of them are going to evolve and 

1693
01:16:48,851 --> 01:16:52,030
change the ones outside of africa and 
depth as neanderthals.

1694
01:16:52,031 --> 01:16:52,864
Those,
the most recent recent instantiation of 

1695
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:54,964
them,
the ones inside of africa ended up is 

1696
01:16:56,261 --> 01:16:58,450
us.
And so when we leave africa,

1697
01:16:58,451 --> 01:17:00,940
the first thing we encountered as 
neanderthals in arabia,

1698
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,220
because that's the first point of entry 
out of africa,

1699
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:05,790
and so we probably started copulating 
with them there.

1700
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:07,840
We know we started copulating with them 
soon afterward.

1701
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:10,250
So as we left they involved somewhere 
else.

1702
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:14,990
They evolved in europe and asia and so 
they had evolved from some other type of

1703
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:16,710
the same ancestors.
So our.

1704
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:17,544
Okay.
Our great uncle left and our great 

1705
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:21,440
grandpa stayed.
And so the ones who left,

1706
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24,950
some of them evolved into those people 
on flores to those tiny little people.

1707
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:28,010
Some of them we know this,
dentists sylvan from a pinky bone,

1708
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:29,540
you know,
in a cave inside Russia.

1709
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:30,873
And we have got,
we know that we interbred with 

1710
01:17:32,961 --> 01:17:33,794
neanderthals and that's where a lot of 
our genes that we currently have for 

1711
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:37,154
light skin and blue eyes and things like
that come from and they think we 

1712
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:42,020
interbred with denisovans as well,
right?

1713
01:17:42,110 --> 01:17:43,910
Well not all of us.
So there's some,

1714
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:47,540
there's evidence for melanesians if I 
remember having dennis blood,

1715
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,740
our dna I don't,
I don't know about.

1716
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:51,860
so it may turn out that we did.
Um,

1717
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,473
I don't think so though,
but there's no evidence that humans 

1718
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:59,060
interbred with the folks from flores.
Not that I know of.

1719
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:00,410
I've never seen that.
They're tiny.

1720
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:01,490
They're really good.
They're very small.

1721
01:18:01,491 --> 01:18:03,670
They're like hobbit.
Like now that doesn't mean that if,

1722
01:18:03,671 --> 01:18:07,040
if,
if we well know we would have.

1723
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,083
It's possible that we could have 
overlapped with them if somebody would 

1724
01:18:10,701 --> 01:18:11,400
do it.
Yeah.

1725
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,170
so like we hit,
we hit Australia by 65,000

1726
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:16,004
years ago and I don't remember when the 
floor is people we hit Australia at 

1727
01:18:18,341 --> 01:18:19,550
65,000
years ago.

1728
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:20,403
Wow.
And that was through some sort of boat 

1729
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:25,580
traveling.
So 65,000

1730
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:26,414
years ago would've still been ice age 
and so we would have had a lot less 

1731
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:30,350
water.
And so if you,

1732
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:31,184
if you look at topographical maps then 
when you look at what the pacific 

1733
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:35,330
islanders didn't stuff,
it seems ballsy as hell,

1734
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:38,300
but it's a little less ballsy when you 
can keep seeing the next piece of land.

1735
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,433
Not not as far away compared to now 
where the seed is much higher and you 

1736
01:18:41,991 --> 01:18:43,280
can't see the land.
Oh,

1737
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:44,114
okay.
So when the pacific islanders like 

1738
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:47,900
traveled to Hawaii,
you think they could see things?

1739
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:48,950
Yeah,
they could see a lot better.

1740
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:49,903
Now.
The most recent that the very last 

1741
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:52,184
place,
the pacific islander settled as New 

1742
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:54,680
Zealand.
That's only 700 years ago,

1743
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:57,200
so that's the same as today.
But um,

1744
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,173
but a lot of that discovery was done at 
a time where the seed was a lot lower 

1745
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,203
and so there'd be a lot more islands 
ticking up that we don't currently have 

1746
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:07,400
700 years ago they had much more 
sophisticated boats.

1747
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:08,770
Yeah.
That was awesome.

1748
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,230
You records and all that.
Yeah,

1749
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:11,473
it is crazy when you think about like 
we're like little rats with the way 

1750
01:19:14,351 --> 01:19:16,970
we've scattered across the globe.
And if you,

1751
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:18,370
if you think about it,
it,

1752
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,200
it seems like it's all ballsy 
exploration,

1753
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:22,034
but I actually suspect a bigger part of 
it is running away from the guy behind 

1754
01:19:24,561 --> 01:19:25,310
you.

1755
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:27,890
It's causing problems.
And so my favorite example of that is if

1756
01:19:27,891 --> 01:19:31,310
you look at the cliff dwellings,
like in the american southwest,

1757
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,860
and you go there and thinking who the 
hell would live like this?

1758
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:34,520
I mean,
you know,

1759
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,450
when junior walks out there,
but if the people down in the valley are

1760
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:40,590
scarier than the risk of falling outside
uk,

1761
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,670
you're going to live up in a cave 
dwelling where they're going to climb up

1762
01:19:43,671 --> 01:19:44,504
to get.
And that's part of the memory we talked 

1763
01:19:46,221 --> 01:19:49,670
about sexual selection as a source of 
people don't like unfairness.

1764
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:50,623
Well,
people also don't like unfairness 

1765
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:54,680
between groups because if you and I make
a deal and you know,

1766
01:19:54,681 --> 01:19:58,610
I'm from Ohio and you're from California
and the California has benefit more than

1767
01:19:58,611 --> 01:20:00,530
the ohioans.
Even though my benefit,

1768
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,410
you benefit more noW I'm at risk because
maybe your group,

1769
01:20:03,411 --> 01:20:05,210
you know,
ancestrally it's going to cause my group

1770
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:06,770
problems.
Interesting.

1771
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,070
So when

1772
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,270
you're studying all this stuff,
how does that make you feel as a person?

1773
01:20:12,271 --> 01:20:12,781
Do you mean?
Do you,

1774
01:20:12,781 --> 01:20:13,614
do you.
Could you ever internalize all this 

1775
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:18,240
stuff when you're thinking about like 
all the weird ape,

1776
01:20:18,241 --> 01:20:19,074
like creatures that turned into people 
and all the thousands and thousands of 

1777
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:28,020
years of evolution and how it could have
gone left and it did go right.

1778
01:20:28,021 --> 01:20:28,854
And does That freak you out when you 
really get deep into the study of all 

1779
01:20:32,221 --> 01:20:32,700
this stuff?

1780
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:34,440
It first of all,
I do this all the time,

1781
01:20:34,441 --> 01:20:35,490
right?
so it doesn't freak me out,

1782
01:20:35,491 --> 01:20:36,324
but it's what I like and it also,
we can talk about all the ways that you 

1783
01:20:38,611 --> 01:20:39,444
can predict things about our modern 
cells based on knowing these things in 

1784
01:20:41,281 --> 01:20:42,114
the past.
Right.

1785
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,313
But secondarily,
what freaks me out the most probably is 

1786
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:48,000
the enormous role of random chance and 
all this.

1787
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:50,280
Right?
And so if you think about the,

1788
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:51,660
I mean,
just think about our own backgrounds,

1789
01:20:51,661 --> 01:20:52,494
the random chance that our mom and dad 
got amaris the night that they did made 

1790
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:58,260
you and me if,
if they did a different position,

1791
01:20:58,261 --> 01:20:59,940
maybe your brother's talking to my 
brother,

1792
01:20:59,941 --> 01:21:00,750
right?
Yeah.

1793
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:04,320
So it's reAlly which sperm wins that 
race is so unlikely to be us.

1794
01:21:04,380 --> 01:21:05,213
Right?
And so every roll of the dice has to go 

1795
01:21:07,351 --> 01:21:08,184
your way.
Right.

1796
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,143
And so the role of chance and all this 
kind of freaks you out if you think 

1797
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:12,324
about that.

1798
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:13,163
But at the same time your brother is 
probably a lot like you and my brother 

1799
01:21:15,271 --> 01:21:17,370
is probably a lot like me or my sister 
or whatever.

1800
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:21,210
And so you have one child or have more?
I've got a boy and a girl.

1801
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,103
Okay.
Yeah.

1802
01:21:22,150 --> 01:21:24,750
Well you know,
then that they're so different right out

1803
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:27,120
of the box,
which is really weird.

1804
01:21:27,150 --> 01:21:29,320
It is weird.
So I don't know if you saw this book,

1805
01:21:29,321 --> 01:21:30,154
the ploumen just wrote called blueprint 
robert plomin who's a behavioral 

1806
01:21:33,241 --> 01:21:35,020
geneticists.
I haven't seen that.

1807
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,851
Our,
it's a lovely book.

1808
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:40,851
Just came out and just really recently,
like a month or two at the most.

1809
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,180
How do you say his name?
P l o m I n robert pillowman.

1810
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,193
And um,
he's a wonderful behaviors geneticists 

1811
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:50,154
over in the uk and this book blueprint 
talks about the role of genes and all 

1812
01:21:53,941 --> 01:21:55,280
this.
And he,

1813
01:21:55,281 --> 01:21:56,114
he basically is one of these people 
who's been in the field almost since it 

1814
01:21:58,651 --> 01:21:59,484
got started.

1815
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,473
And what they kept thinking is that the 
environment was going to play a huge 

1816
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:03,624
role,
that parents were going to play a huge 

1817
01:22:04,981 --> 01:22:05,814
role,
but of course what they keep finding 

1818
01:22:07,261 --> 01:22:08,780
over and over again.
there you go.

1819
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:13,260
There's how dna makes us who we are and 
what they find over and over again,

1820
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:15,540
and this was so disconcerting,
is first of all,

1821
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:16,583
on average,
most things are about 50 percent 

1822
01:22:17,881 --> 01:22:18,714
genetic,
but the bummer is that the other half 

1823
01:22:20,791 --> 01:22:21,624
isn't,
isn't what's happened in your house and 

1824
01:22:23,491 --> 01:22:24,324
the way you're brought up by your folks.
It's the random other stuff like the 

1825
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:28,510
first,
we don't even know what it is.

1826
01:22:28,511 --> 01:22:30,390
It's just,
it's what we call unshared environment.

1827
01:22:30,391 --> 01:22:31,224
Maybe that first girlfriend you had,
maybe you biked into a tree and you 

1828
01:22:32,990 --> 01:22:35,640
unimproved your face,
you know a million different things that

1829
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:39,480
specifically happened to you that didn't
happen to everybody else in your family.

1830
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,010
Right?

1831
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:44,330
And also the way you address those 
things that happen and that could have a

1832
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:45,164
factor that could be a factor in how you
were raised and how you were taught to 

1833
01:22:47,661 --> 01:22:48,494
deal with stress.
How you were taught to deal with 

1834
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:52,910
situations and character development,

1835
01:22:53,110 --> 01:22:53,943
but all the data suggest,
not suggest parents just don't matter 

1836
01:22:56,290 --> 01:22:57,123
how you were taught doesn't seem to play
a role because when we parse up all the 

1837
01:23:00,221 --> 01:23:02,980
different traits about you,
there's a few that your parents actually

1838
01:23:02,981 --> 01:23:05,050
have a big influence on what religion 
you're in,

1839
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,120
for example,
but not how religious you are.

1840
01:23:07,450 --> 01:23:10,990
SO the biggest role that you play seems 
to be when sperm medic.

1841
01:23:11,350 --> 01:23:13,210
So a friend of mine,
the analogy they made when,

1842
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:14,980
when I,
when I had my first kid is these,

1843
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:15,843
he says,
here's what you're going to find out 

1844
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:18,640
that you're handed.
When the baby's born,

1845
01:23:18,641 --> 01:23:20,920
you're handed a negative.
It's the pictures already been taken.

1846
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:22,033
You can screw it up by being in the dark
room a little bit wrong or you can help 

1847
01:23:24,821 --> 01:23:26,590
it a little bit by being in the darkroom
a little bit.

1848
01:23:26,591 --> 01:23:27,424
Right?
But the photograph is already there and 

1849
01:23:29,531 --> 01:23:32,200
my son and my daughter are wildly 
different in some ways.

1850
01:23:32,201 --> 01:23:33,034
In some ways they're quite similar,
but I feel like I'm along for the ride 

1851
01:23:35,591 --> 01:23:38,320
more than I feel like I'm shaping them 
to make them who they are,

1852
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:40,210
but don't you think you're shaping him 
somewhat?

1853
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:41,380
I'm trying.
Look,

1854
01:23:41,381 --> 01:23:43,900
that's what we do,
but the date is say no,

1855
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:45,880
but how would the data?
No,

1856
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:47,320
I mean,
so here's how we do

1857
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,740
to study so many different human beings.
You have to.

1858
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:54,430
You have to take into account all the 
variables that took place during all the

1859
01:23:54,431 --> 01:23:56,050
developmental periods of their life.

1860
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,110
Well,
the it to do it right,

1861
01:23:58,111 --> 01:24:00,450
you need to do all that and we can't do 
that yet and to do it right.

1862
01:24:00,451 --> 01:24:03,750
What you want is actually to have that.
The actual genetic markers,

1863
01:24:03,751 --> 01:24:07,170
not just to know that the genes are 
there and that's all starting now,

1864
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:08,640
but.
But we don't know yet.

1865
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,170
What they do do is they'll say,
well,

1866
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:11,970
we got a bunch of where there's two ways
to go about this.

1867
01:24:11,971 --> 01:24:13,410
Employment was at the front of both of 
them.

1868
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:16,290
One,
you look at adaptive studies versus kids

1869
01:24:16,291 --> 01:24:17,124
who are adopted into a family versus 
biological and you can compare the 

1870
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:21,533
parents of the adopted kids to the 
biological parents versus the home 

1871
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:24,804
parents,
and it turns out that the biological 

1872
01:24:26,851 --> 01:24:27,684
parents predict a whole lot more about 
the adopted child than the parents who 

1873
01:24:29,971 --> 01:24:30,804
raised them.
The parents were raised in predict 

1874
01:24:32,491 --> 01:24:33,360
almost nothing.

1875
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:34,410
Whoa.
I know,

1876
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:35,244
and then the second thing you can do is 
you can look at fraternal versus a 

1877
01:24:38,550 --> 01:24:39,383
monozygotic identical twins and you find
that the when you then they all share 

1878
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:45,310
the same environment.
They're,

1879
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:46,650
they're all brought up by you and me,
right?

1880
01:24:46,651 --> 01:24:50,250
Where the parents of these kids,
but the they also,

1881
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:53,670
there's a lot of unshared environment 
and that's when they differ.

1882
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:54,504
It's not because of you and me,
we can't find any evidence that you and 

1883
01:24:56,461 --> 01:24:57,294
me that you and I made any difference.
All we can find is evidence that other 

1884
01:25:00,211 --> 01:25:01,044
things in their life made a difference.
Not to say that means what we really 

1885
01:25:03,601 --> 01:25:04,351
don't know is,
well,

1886
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:05,184
what is that unshared environment?
All we know is it's not something about 

1887
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:11,220
your household because that would cause 
fraternal and identical twins to both be

1888
01:25:11,221 --> 01:25:13,620
more similar to each other and it 
doesn't.

1889
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,823
Well obviously a lot.
There's not a lot of data in terms of 

1890
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:22,180
when you're measuring someone's entire 
life from birth to death,

1891
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:25,750
but there's enough that people are 
starting to draw conclusions.

1892
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,130
One of the more interesting ones is when
you see identical twins that were raised

1893
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:33,340
in different households without any 
knowledge of each other,

1894
01:25:33,610 --> 01:25:34,443
and then they run into each other 30 
years later and they find out they have 

1895
01:25:37,210 --> 01:25:38,670
disturbing similarity.
YeAh,

1896
01:25:38,990 --> 01:25:41,650
that's exactly another example,
and what's also interesting about it,

1897
01:25:41,651 --> 01:25:42,484
which plum and talks about in blueprint 
is that your genes become more powerful 

1898
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:47,224
as you age.
So the heritability of things like iq 

1899
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:51,214
goes up as you get older,
and so the argument is that your gene 

1900
01:25:53,691 --> 01:25:55,990
seemed to be causing you to select out 
environments.

1901
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:57,340
So you gave the example,
well,

1902
01:25:57,341 --> 01:26:01,630
maybe the way that you discipline them 
or tell them to be resilient or whatever

1903
01:26:01,631 --> 01:26:04,010
you do as a parent causes them to shape 
their environment.

1904
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:07,360
It doesn't seem to be the case,
but it does seem to be the case that the

1905
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,203
genes that you give them caused them to 
select their environments in certain 

1906
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:12,560
ways because remember,
kids choose their friends,

1907
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:14,570
right?
You want them to play with timmy,

1908
01:26:14,571 --> 01:26:16,930
but they want to play with johnny.
That's,

1909
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:20,360
that's the unshared environment.
They're making those choices every day.

1910
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:21,343
It's also the case that their peers 
matter a whole lot more than their 

1911
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:25,010
parents do once they get to a certain 
age.

1912
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:27,140
You know,
I'm chopped liver as soon as my kids are

1913
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:28,220
a bit older,
but when I'm young,

1914
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:31,800
I'm their hero right now.
When you.

1915
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:35,300
When you say that your genes become more
powerful as you get older,

1916
01:26:35,301 --> 01:26:36,560
what do you mean by that though?
Well,

1917
01:26:36,561 --> 01:26:37,394
they,
they are more predictive of the outcome 

1918
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:41,840
and so if you look at the heritability 
of iq when you're a kid,

1919
01:26:41,841 --> 01:26:42,674
it's lower than when you're an adult and
it's lower still than when you're an 

1920
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:45,344
older adult,
and so what seems to be happening to a 

1921
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:49,220
lot of our traits?
Probably almost usually.

1922
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:53,660
Are you saying that like if you have 
children as an older person,

1923
01:26:53,661 --> 01:26:55,940
it's charitable as the kids get older.
Sorry.

1924
01:26:56,030 --> 01:26:57,010
Okay,
so as a.

1925
01:26:57,160 --> 01:27:00,650
So if you look at the heritability of iq
when kids are two,

1926
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:01,670
four,
eight,

1927
01:27:01,730 --> 01:27:02,930
10,
20,

1928
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:03,764
60,
you find that identical twins come more 

1929
01:27:06,111 --> 01:27:06,944
and more together as they age,
whether they're aging in the same 

1930
01:27:08,541 --> 01:27:09,410
household or not.

1931
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,490
And so There's something about selecting
your environment.

1932
01:27:12,491 --> 01:27:15,500
So like here's one kid who loves to 
think of do puzzles and it's identical.

1933
01:27:15,501 --> 01:27:18,050
Twin loves due to the same and they kind
of get smarter their whole lives.

1934
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:20,000
Here's another kid who's not interested 
in that.

1935
01:27:20,001 --> 01:27:22,640
They have other interests and they go in
a different direction,

1936
01:27:22,641 --> 01:27:24,200
but when you're,
when you're the parent,

1937
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:25,034
you can be busily pushing them to do the
things you want them to do and so 

1938
01:27:27,621 --> 01:27:29,640
they're heritability is less strong and 
there's,

1939
01:27:29,641 --> 01:27:30,474
there's lots of cool examples.
It's like when totalitarian governments 

1940
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:35,240
are eliminated in the school system 
becomes more fair.

1941
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:36,253
Heritability of intelligence goes up in 
those societies because kids are now 

1942
01:27:39,081 --> 01:27:41,960
more capable of selecting the schools.
they want to go to the environments that

1943
01:27:41,961 --> 01:27:43,880
they want to be part of.
Wow.

1944
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:46,340
What we're.
We're so flexible.

1945
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:47,233
It's so weird when you think about all 
the various styles of civilization that 

1946
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:53,990
human beings exist in and thrive in.

1947
01:27:54,170 --> 01:27:54,641
Right?
And,

1948
01:27:54,641 --> 01:27:55,700
and for me,
that's the key.

1949
01:27:55,701 --> 01:27:57,970
So when a lot of people hear about this,
they sort,

1950
01:27:58,010 --> 01:27:58,843
it sounds like genetic determinism that 
your genes are forcing you to be a 

1951
01:28:01,371 --> 01:28:03,290
certain way,
but for me it's,

1952
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:04,124
there's nothing genetic determinism that
you can think of about as a genetic 

1953
01:28:06,591 --> 01:28:08,600
nudge.
Part of your nudge is going to come from

1954
01:28:08,601 --> 01:28:09,434
the dna your inherited,
but part of it's going to come from the 

1955
01:28:10,941 --> 01:28:13,400
environment and part of it's going to 
come from your own personal decisions.

1956
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:16,520
So in my mind we talk about in terms of 
your mind,

1957
01:28:16,521 --> 01:28:20,390
because that's what psychology,
but an easier example is your muscles.

1958
01:28:20,690 --> 01:28:21,523
You know,
some people inherit genes that if they 

1959
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:23,690
lift one,
wait once,

1960
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,560
they're both other people's genes.
They have to work out a lot if they want

1961
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:28,394
to gain anything,
but you can still decide I'm going to 

1962
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:30,890
work out a lot or I'm not.

1963
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,280
I'm gonna eat these nutrients or you 
know,

1964
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:34,123
a lot of protein or not.
You can choose a lifestyle that leads 

1965
01:28:36,501 --> 01:28:37,850
you to be more muscular,
less so.

1966
01:28:37,851 --> 01:28:40,270
it's partially choice.
It's partially environment.

1967
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:43,610
It's partially that interaction between 
your genes and environment,

1968
01:28:43,790 --> 01:28:46,370
which would make sense if you think 
about how flexible we are.

1969
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,440
AbsoLutely.
It has to be active that we are.

1970
01:28:48,530 --> 01:28:49,363
It has to be because human beings have 
to learn how to survive in every 

1971
01:28:51,261 --> 01:28:54,050
environment on this planet.
If we were mere cats or something,

1972
01:28:54,051 --> 01:28:55,490
well,
we got a certain way of doing things and

1973
01:28:55,820 --> 01:28:56,653
your genes can basically tell you what 
to do and with mere cats there's some 

1974
01:28:58,851 --> 01:29:01,140
really interesting experiments where you
can show your genes,

1975
01:29:01,141 --> 01:29:03,180
caused you to listen to one signal and 
just follow that.

1976
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,910
But as human beings,
your genes have no choice but to give up

1977
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:08,730
control.
Once we went down this cognitive pathway

1978
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:12,060
that emphasizes learning over inborn 
instincts,

1979
01:29:12,150 --> 01:29:12,983
you know you've had a little ones.
You know they're worthless when they're 

1980
01:29:14,371 --> 01:29:15,204
babies,
right?

1981
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:18,420
Baby willdabeast gets up and off.
It can go run away from a lion.

1982
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,660
Yeah.
It's just so fantastically complicated.

1983
01:29:23,020 --> 01:29:23,853
The developmental process from birth to 
adulthood and that this is taking place 

1984
01:29:29,231 --> 01:29:30,064
simultaneously amongst hundreds and 
hundreds of millions of people with 

1985
01:29:34,780 --> 01:29:35,613
varying results and all sorts of 
different levels of creativity and 

1986
01:29:39,431 --> 01:29:40,264
ingenuity and mathematical prowess and 
literature and all these different 

1987
01:29:44,201 --> 01:29:46,150
things that are being created by all 
these different,

1988
01:29:46,151 --> 01:29:46,984
weird little ape creatures everywhere.
And there's so many different factors 

1989
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:52,870
that determine what this ape creature 
becomes.

1990
01:29:53,070 --> 01:29:53,903
Right?
And that's one of the best things in my 

1991
01:29:54,871 --> 01:29:58,050
mind about being a person.
So if like if you're a dung beetle,

1992
01:29:58,350 --> 01:29:59,183
you got one job in life,
push up all the poor and you can't push 

1993
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:01,811
a ball,
a poo,

1994
01:30:01,811 --> 01:30:04,500
that's three times your body weight.
well that's the end of the line for you,

1995
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:06,000
right?
But if you're a human,

1996
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:07,730
maybe you're big and strong,
maybe you're not.

1997
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:09,540
Maybe you're really smart,
maybe you're not.

1998
01:30:09,541 --> 01:30:10,650
Maybe you're really creative,
you know,

1999
01:30:10,651 --> 01:30:13,120
there's a million ways to skin that cat.
And,

2000
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,233
and the great thing about being in the 
human is that any good at any of those 

2001
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:17,790
things,
there's a niche for you.

2002
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:18,624
You will be beneficial.
And because we evolved to all work 

2003
01:30:20,731 --> 01:30:22,110
together,
there'll be value in you,

2004
01:30:22,111 --> 01:30:23,730
you're my favorite barista,
you're my favorite,

2005
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:25,620
whatever,
whatever you're good at.

2006
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:26,970
And everybody's good at something.

2007
01:30:27,180 --> 01:30:28,013
And so the thing is that people worry 
about the sort of upcoming genetic 

2008
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:32,154
revolution that it's going to be,
whether it's going to be the good and 

2009
01:30:33,991 --> 01:30:36,180
everybody else,
and that's just not going to happen.

2010
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:37,283
Because one of the things that we know,
and you'll see this if you look at 

2011
01:30:38,641 --> 01:30:39,474
blueprint,
is that you have a kazillion jeans on 

2012
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,361
july.
Every trait,

2013
01:30:42,361 --> 01:30:45,480
there aren't five smart genes.
There's like a thousand of them.

2014
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:46,523
And furthermore,
each one of them only accounts for a 

2015
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:48,684
tiny,
tiny bit and they do lots of other 

2016
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:51,550
things too.
So you can't like,

2017
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:52,703
you can't make a designer baby that has 
all these qualities because all you do 

2018
01:30:54,691 --> 01:30:55,524
is noodle around with five or six genes.
There's a couple of disorders that work 

2019
01:30:58,201 --> 01:30:59,820
that way.
But our personalities,

2020
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:00,654
our abilities,
our proclivities are all heavily 

2021
01:31:02,581 --> 01:31:03,414
determined by large numbers of genes 
that do lots and lots of different 

2022
01:31:05,521 --> 01:31:06,320
things.
But we're talking,

2023
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,840
talking about our understanding of 
genetics currently.

2024
01:31:09,020 --> 01:31:09,853
Yes.
And when you talk about things like 

2025
01:31:11,721 --> 01:31:12,554
genetic manipulation or the use of 
crispr or any of these maybe new tools 

2026
01:31:15,981 --> 01:31:18,830
that they're working on right now,
they've already updated crispr.

2027
01:31:18,831 --> 01:31:20,060
They were crisper point two,
right?

2028
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:21,613
When,
when this continues to evolve and more 

2029
01:31:25,671 --> 01:31:29,060
and more innovation takes place in that 
world,

2030
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,283
don't you think they're going to get to 
a point where they're going to 

2031
01:31:31,521 --> 01:31:35,360
understand all the various factors and 
genetics and they're going to be able to

2032
01:31:35,361 --> 01:31:37,880
create a person who looks like thor?

2033
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:39,181
Well,
yes and no.

2034
01:31:39,181 --> 01:31:40,680
So in principle,
yes.

2035
01:31:40,681 --> 01:31:41,590
So you've got like,
I don't know,

2036
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:42,453
3 billion base pairs in your dna and 
most of those we all share all the same 

2037
01:31:46,411 --> 01:31:47,820
ones.
So screw the ones that are shared.

2038
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:48,654
We don't care about those.
All we can do is noodle around with the 

2039
01:31:50,101 --> 01:31:50,934
ones that aren't.
Now what makes it complicated is that 

2040
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:57,510
most of the ones that differ between 
people are actually non there in what we

2041
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:00,490
now call the regulatory region.
We used to think of as junk dna,

2042
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,930
but now we know.
Well,

2043
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:03,940
think about a company,
a company that makes widgets,

2044
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:05,680
doesn't just make widgets,
has to have sales,

2045
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:08,290
avesta marketing and asset management,
and now we know,

2046
01:32:08,291 --> 01:32:09,124
well sure enough,
a lot of the dna that's not coding for 

2047
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:11,704
proteins is working with the other dna 
to turn things on and turn things off 

2048
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:16,450
and there's 3 billion base pairs.

2049
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:18,700
So there's that level of complexity.
There is outrageous,

2050
01:32:18,710 --> 01:32:19,600
right?
So,

2051
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:21,430
but let's still some day we'll get it 
right.

2052
01:32:21,740 --> 01:32:22,573
It's not you and I won't see it.
And and what we now know from these 

2053
01:32:24,671 --> 01:32:25,504
studies,
g was studies a genome wide association 

2054
01:32:27,461 --> 01:32:28,294
studies is that you can look at all the 
very base pairs that very and you can 

2055
01:32:32,681 --> 01:32:33,430
say,
all right,

2056
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:36,160
which one of these things are correlated
with my outcome of interest?

2057
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:37,360
And so you say,
oh,

2058
01:32:37,361 --> 01:32:38,194
education.
And they create what's called 

2059
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:39,934
apologetics score and you say,
let's predict how many years of 

2060
01:32:42,491 --> 01:32:44,350
education you're going to get.
And sure enough,

2061
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:45,963
the richer you are on average,
the higher your polygenic score is it 

2062
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:49,993
you're born into a rich family.
You probably have a higher apologetics 

2063
01:32:51,361 --> 01:32:52,930
score,
but if you're apologetic,

2064
01:32:52,931 --> 01:32:57,070
score for education is lower than the 
average for your thing.

2065
01:32:57,071 --> 01:32:59,530
You'll probably get poor across your 
life if it's higher,

2066
01:32:59,531 --> 01:33:02,290
you probably get richard,
is that a gene for being smart,

2067
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,124
for sitting there and doing what you're 
told for self control like it could be 

2068
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,353
and there's a thousand things in there 
and each one of them accounts for one 

2069
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:10,564
10th of one percent of the variants,
but what makes it complicated is that 

2070
01:33:13,271 --> 01:33:16,000
whole set of genes also predicts how 
artistic you are,

2071
01:33:16,001 --> 01:33:16,834
but in a different combination and it 
predicts how friendly you are in a 

2072
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:19,624
different combination and so the the the
genes that do one set of things almost 

2073
01:33:23,531 --> 01:33:27,170
always do lots of things and we have 
very few traits through that.

2074
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:30,340
don't have lots and lots of genes that 
each play a tiny role underneath them.

2075
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:32,920
The example ploumen gives in his book,
which I think is great,

2076
01:33:33,150 --> 01:33:33,983
he says,
we started out looking for golden 

2077
01:33:34,931 --> 01:33:37,480
nuggets and we now realize we looking 
for gold dust.

2078
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:39,460
It's just lots of tiny stuff like that.

2079
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,640
They're so in many ways when you're 
looking at a one,

2080
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:44,543
you know,
you talk about the human genome and our 

2081
01:33:47,891 --> 01:33:49,370
genetic code,
we're,

2082
01:33:49,380 --> 01:33:50,213
we're really similar to computer 
programs and that there's millions and 

2083
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:55,420
millions of lines of code and computer 
programs,

2084
01:33:55,421 --> 01:33:58,890
but we know how to make computer 
programs so we know what these will.

2085
01:33:58,891 --> 01:33:59,724
We don't need to know somebody smarter 
than both of us knows how to make these 

2086
01:34:04,090 --> 01:34:05,240
incredible,
you know,

2087
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:07,030
that lead to operating systems.

2088
01:34:07,410 --> 01:34:09,450
But now we're writing codeS that we 
don't understand.

2089
01:34:09,660 --> 01:34:10,493
So if you look at neural networks,
they'll be input levels in the output 

2090
01:34:12,901 --> 01:34:13,734
levels in the fricking computer decides 
how to mix those things together and we 

2091
01:34:16,261 --> 01:34:17,094
don't even know what the it's done.
And two of them that are learning the 

2092
01:34:18,571 --> 01:34:20,460
same thing might get there via different
mechanisms.

2093
01:34:20,510 --> 01:34:24,470
So by that idea or with it through that 
idea,

2094
01:34:24,471 --> 01:34:25,304
wouldn't you think that artificial 
intelligence could lead to the mapping 

2095
01:34:27,021 --> 01:34:31,460
out of the human genome or rather the 
altering of the human genome and mapping

2096
01:34:31,461 --> 01:34:33,050
out a different type of human

2097
01:34:33,100 --> 01:34:34,850
look?
In principle it could and,

2098
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:35,923
and,
and it may and all I would say is that 

2099
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:39,143
you,
what we thought though is that there'd 

2100
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:41,344
be five smart genes that really matter 
and the rest are trivial and so turn on 

2101
01:34:44,771 --> 01:34:45,604
those five smart once everybody's going 
to want that and there'll be five funny 

2102
01:34:47,801 --> 01:34:49,030
jeans and we'll turn those on,
you know,

2103
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:50,410
et cetera.
But there's not.

2104
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,460
and so what that means is I got to 
decide what,

2105
01:34:52,660 --> 01:34:53,493
imagine this future world where I'm 
about to have a baby and I can crisper 

2106
01:34:55,331 --> 01:34:57,650
the whole thing and I have to decide 
what genes I'll say,

2107
01:34:57,651 --> 01:34:58,484
well I can make them smarter,
but then he's not going to be very 

2108
01:35:00,051 --> 01:35:00,884
friendly,
you know,

2109
01:35:01,180 --> 01:35:02,013
whatever.
Right?

2110
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:05,450
The old trade off against each other.
You could get the big dick gene,

2111
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:09,170
but it doesn't exactly give them 
glasses.

2112
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,980
Exactly.
And so the thing is that it makes it.

2113
01:35:12,981 --> 01:35:14,460
So yeah,
we will get rid of things,

2114
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,520
these single gene disorders that are 
awful.

2115
01:35:16,580 --> 01:35:17,413
Right?
Right.

2116
01:35:17,630 --> 01:35:18,463
But we're not gonna I suspect we're not 
going to noodle around with our smarts 

2117
01:35:21,921 --> 01:35:22,754
and our personalitY because every single
change we make is going to have a 

2118
01:35:24,831 --> 01:35:26,150
commensurate change somewhere else.
Oh,

2119
01:35:26,151 --> 01:35:27,950
well I can make a smarter,
but then he's going to be depressed.

2120
01:35:28,070 --> 01:35:28,903
And you know,

2121
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:30,400
like that.
Yeah.

2122
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:32,920
That,
that is a boy,

2123
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,730
that the idea of playing god like that.
I mean,

2124
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:38,280
that's,
that's really mean.

2125
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:41,680
We are playing creator.
I don't even necessarily think we should

2126
01:35:41,681 --> 01:35:42,514
use the word god in that respect because
it's something that's already been 

2127
01:35:44,171 --> 01:35:45,004
created.
But we're taking this life form and 

2128
01:35:47,261 --> 01:35:48,700
radically altering it

2129
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:52,080
and we can already do that and people 
will start doing it soon.

2130
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,430
And we,
like when I was a kid,

2131
01:35:53,431 --> 01:35:55,740
when we were kids,
ivf is playing god,

2132
01:35:56,230 --> 01:36:01,230
now it's a triviality that is,
that is crazy what we're do.

2133
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:03,243
You don't think that this is gonna take 
place in our lifetime that maybe Russia 

2134
01:36:05,401 --> 01:36:07,260
and China is going to make some super 
person,

2135
01:36:07,410 --> 01:36:10,230
not too many genes that play too small 
of a role.

2136
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:13,270
And so the thing is that the,
um,

2137
01:36:14,260 --> 01:36:16,500
it,
it's too hard to mess around with.

2138
01:36:16,501 --> 01:36:18,570
It's too hard to make the to to create 
these things.

2139
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:19,523
There's nO reason that you'd be a lot 
better off if you just did selective 

2140
01:36:21,181 --> 01:36:23,010
breeding and the reality is you don't 
even need to.

2141
01:36:23,220 --> 01:36:25,050
People already assertively,
mate.

2142
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:28,500
They already choose partners who were 
similar to themselves.

2143
01:36:28,501 --> 01:36:30,510
If they value education,
the other person does two.

2144
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:32,430
If they value athletics,
the other person does too.

2145
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:33,713
That works so much better than anything 
that we're capable of doing right now 

2146
01:36:36,450 --> 01:36:37,283
and when you do these,
ge was studies with these polygenic 

2147
01:36:38,971 --> 01:36:40,560
scores and you say,
oh look,

2148
01:36:41,390 --> 01:36:44,370
you're born into a social class and 
suggested to it probably behind.

2149
01:36:44,371 --> 01:36:46,650
You're just kind of low and sure enough,
you get poor across your life.

2150
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:49,470
You're literally accounting for three 
percent of the variants.

2151
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,304
You're barely explaining anything 
because even though when we look at the 

2152
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,110
behavioral genetic studies,
we can say,

2153
01:36:55,111 --> 01:36:57,450
wow,
intelligence has 50 percent genetic.

2154
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,390
We can't come close to finding the genes
that actually do that,

2155
01:37:00,850 --> 01:37:05,280
and part of the reason we don't know,
but part of the reason may be that first

2156
01:37:05,281 --> 01:37:06,960
of all,
it's course 50 percent environmental and

2157
01:37:06,961 --> 01:37:10,260
what those random things are.
We don't know and second think about how

2158
01:37:10,261 --> 01:37:12,390
you were 3 billion base pairs,
how many things,

2159
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,313
maybe when those two are in place in 
that one isn't in the third one can be 

2160
01:37:15,541 --> 01:37:16,374
interactions that really,
really complicated levels where you're 

2161
01:37:18,391 --> 01:37:19,224
almost dead infinite.
And so that's why I don't think it 

2162
01:37:21,181 --> 01:37:22,740
happens when you and I around to see it.

2163
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:24,643
I think you're probably right.
But then I just realized that things 

2164
01:37:27,351 --> 01:37:30,290
like crispr,
which were invented by accident,

2165
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,060
came out of nowhere less than a decade 
ago.

2166
01:37:33,061 --> 01:37:34,700
I believe it was less than a decade ago.
Right.

2167
01:37:35,370 --> 01:37:36,780
It's super recent.
It's outside of the.

2168
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:37,490
Okay.

2169
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:38,323
And then if you really stop and think 
about even the mapping of the human 

2170
01:37:41,721 --> 01:37:42,554
genome,
it used to be an unbelievably difficult 

2171
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:45,560
thing.
Yeah.

2172
01:37:45,560 --> 01:37:46,930
And then,
you know,

2173
01:37:47,180 --> 01:37:50,420
checking your genetics was 
preposterously expensive.

2174
01:37:50,421 --> 01:37:54,680
Now you just spit into a little tube and
send it to 23 and me and they,

2175
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:55,890
they tell you,
hey bro,

2176
01:37:55,891 --> 01:37:56,040
you

2177
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
know,
someone in your family is from europe 

2178
01:37:58,411 --> 01:37:59,244
and this guy's from asia and yeah,
and so I could easily be wrong that you 

2179
01:38:02,491 --> 01:38:05,730
and I will see it and it's only 10 years
away because competition really,

2180
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:06,564
it seems so hard right now.
But things that were competition the 

2181
01:38:08,031 --> 01:38:09,780
impossible when I was in grad school,
you know,

2182
01:38:09,810 --> 01:38:12,330
the simple analyses we did with our data
in grad school,

2183
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:15,210
it's just like a phone could do that so 
easily now.

2184
01:38:15,211 --> 01:38:17,790
And we waited 24 hours for the mainframe
to give it back to us.

2185
01:38:17,910 --> 01:38:22,530
Kurzweil talks about that,
that we really don't see things in terms

2186
01:38:22,531 --> 01:38:25,080
of the exponential increase in 
technology.

2187
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,233
You know,
kurzweil believes all this is going to 

2188
01:38:27,451 --> 01:38:28,410
happen,
plus more.

2189
01:38:28,411 --> 01:38:29,244
He thinks you're going to be able to 
download your brain into a computer and 

2190
01:38:31,970 --> 01:38:32,803
you know,
and he started ourselves and smarter 

2191
01:38:34,261 --> 01:38:34,560
than me.

2192
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:35,440
I don't know if he's smarter than,
you know,

2193
01:38:35,441 --> 01:38:36,274
he's definitely smarter than me and his 
research has just turned on the world's 

2194
01:38:39,331 --> 01:38:42,540
most powerful super computer designed to
mimic a human brain.

2195
01:38:42,590 --> 01:38:44,820
Won't think I was telling you about a 
week or last week.

2196
01:38:45,110 --> 01:38:45,943
That sounds pretty scary.
Computer neural morphic computer just 

2197
01:38:49,741 --> 01:38:53,940
got a big boost with a million core 
supercomputer that took over a decade to

2198
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:55,560
build.
Mother.

2199
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,780
Yeah.
This is the beginning of a movie,

2200
01:38:57,781 --> 01:38:58,360
right?
Right.

2201
01:38:58,360 --> 01:38:59,850
It doesn't go well,
but here's the thing,

2202
01:38:59,851 --> 01:39:01,830
right?
This movie in this movie,

2203
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:05,970
this is a whole room full of computers,
just like the apollo missions.

2204
01:39:05,971 --> 01:39:10,470
Use the room for a computer that can't 
fuck with your phone and this was really

2205
01:39:10,471 --> 01:39:13,140
crazy.
That's 1965.

2206
01:39:13,141 --> 01:39:14,430
Sixty six,
67,

2207
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,200
right?
They,

2208
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,490
they had a room.
This iphone,

2209
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:18,413
berries that room full of fucking shitty
ass computers and 10 plus it takes 

2210
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:22,674
pictures.
Do you remember when your kids and 

2211
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:26,460
everybody said everyone will have their 
own phone and I'm thinking,

2212
01:39:26,461 --> 01:39:27,360
who the hell wants a phone?

2213
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,160
Like my mom will just reach me wherever 
I go.

2214
01:39:29,670 --> 01:39:31,030
She didn't know what a phone could do in
those.

2215
01:39:31,110 --> 01:39:31,943
Nice to have a bit.
And this is only from 2005 from a 

2216
01:39:34,711 --> 01:39:37,620
netflix special I did in 2005,
which,

2217
01:39:37,670 --> 01:39:39,510
you know,
it's 13 years ago,

2218
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,553
but doesn't seem like that long ago,
but I was making fun of people texting 

2219
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:47,130
because uh,
I was like,

2220
01:39:47,131 --> 01:39:48,030
hey bro,
why?

2221
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:50,220
Why are you making me read?
Call me.

2222
01:39:50,430 --> 01:39:50,760
I go,
well,

2223
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:53,730
you're sending me texts from a fall,
you will fucking call me.

2224
01:39:53,850 --> 01:39:58,410
It takes you four presses to get an s.
That was back when you had numbers.

2225
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:00,043
Yeah.
And then that was also back when people 

2226
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:04,500
thought it was cool to have those walkie
talkies,

2227
01:40:04,501 --> 01:40:06,770
those nextel phones.
Do you remember that?

2228
01:40:07,160 --> 01:40:10,500
That was like a big deal to have a 
walkie talkie on a phone that died out,

2229
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,513
thankfully.

2230
01:40:11,700 --> 01:40:12,533
But this,
this whole change in the way we view 

2231
01:40:15,931 --> 01:40:16,764
technology from 2005 to 2018.
The world is a radically different 

2232
01:40:21,751 --> 01:40:22,584
place.
And the funny thing is that you and I 

2233
01:40:23,821 --> 01:40:26,100
both make a living by observing the 
human condition,

2234
01:40:26,130 --> 01:40:28,350
right?
That's our job and we both get it wrong.

2235
01:40:28,351 --> 01:40:30,190
Constantly write every day.
You got that?

2236
01:40:30,290 --> 01:40:31,650
The texting,
what the hell is that?

2237
01:40:31,910 --> 01:40:32,743
I remember my sister showed me facebook 
because she was in an ngo and they're 

2238
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,660
using it to keep track of each other.
I was like,

2239
01:40:36,810 --> 01:40:38,040
yeah,
people don't want to do that shit.

2240
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,320
I'm wrong.
Every time,

2241
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:41,303
every single time I'm wrong.
I follow quite a few people on facebook 

2242
01:40:44,610 --> 01:40:45,443
that are nuts and uh,
I go to their pages just to see what 

2243
01:40:49,141 --> 01:40:52,650
kind of arguments or getting into like 
as a sociological experiment.

2244
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:58,140
And there are people that are on 
facebook arguing about trump or abortion

2245
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:04,000
or islam or fill in the blank,
environmental concerns,

2246
01:41:04,001 --> 01:41:04,834
fracking.

2247
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:08,860
And they just fucking argue all day 
long.

2248
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,320
It's fascinating.
You look at their timeline,

2249
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:13,210
you look at it,
the entries and you're like,

2250
01:41:13,211 --> 01:41:14,044
oh my god,
there's like 10 hours of this shit in a 

2251
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,730
day.
And they just do it all day long.

2252
01:41:18,731 --> 01:41:19,564
And you just picture this sweaty person 
sitting in front of a computer arguing 

2253
01:41:23,771 --> 01:41:24,604
with the world.
I never would have thought that there'd 

2254
01:41:26,950 --> 01:41:27,783
be people sitting in front of their desk
arguing with people that they can't see 

2255
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,330
all throughout the world.
Who thought that?

2256
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:37,210
Who thought that would be fun?
I don't think it is fun.

2257
01:41:37,211 --> 01:41:38,044
I think it's an impulsive,
obsessive thing that people get sucked 

2258
01:41:40,961 --> 01:41:41,794
into and I think they're vastly 
healthier and happier when they're not 

2259
01:41:44,021 --> 01:41:44,790
engaged in it.

2260
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:45,151
Yeah.
Well,

2261
01:41:45,151 --> 01:41:47,550
I mean the truth of the matter is,
and this comes back to the past again,

2262
01:41:47,551 --> 01:41:48,384
so you.
We talked about all of these 

2263
01:41:48,751 --> 01:41:49,584
differences,
so one of the really lovely things that 

2264
01:41:50,971 --> 01:41:52,710
you can do is look for the past and then
say,

2265
01:41:52,711 --> 01:41:54,390
well,
how does that manifest itself today?

2266
01:41:54,750 --> 01:41:57,390
And one of my favorite examples is the 
whites of your eyes.

2267
01:41:57,660 --> 01:42:01,320
So chimpanzees have brown eyes.
The sclerA around the cornea.

2268
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:03,690
Ours are white.
Why would you do that?

2269
01:42:03,691 --> 01:42:05,940
Well then advertise as the direction of 
your gaze.

2270
01:42:06,210 --> 01:42:07,830
Why would you advertise the direction 
case?

2271
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:10,440
Because what that says is that on 
average as a human,

2272
01:42:10,680 --> 01:42:12,150
when I look over there and see 
something,

2273
01:42:12,151 --> 01:42:12,984
I want you to know that I saw it.
You and I are probably going to 

2274
01:42:15,241 --> 01:42:18,780
cooperate to help us achieve whatever 
the goal is that I just encountered.

2275
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:22,650
A chimp wants to hide it from its fellow
chimps because it's competitive,

2276
01:42:22,651 --> 01:42:23,484
right?

2277
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,080
On average,
whatever the hell is over there,

2278
01:42:25,081 --> 01:42:26,790
you're not going to help me get it right
or.

2279
01:42:26,970 --> 01:42:27,990
Yeah,
exactly.

2280
01:42:27,991 --> 01:42:29,510
You're gonna.
Make it harder for me to get it.

2281
01:42:29,530 --> 01:42:32,450
yeah.
The chimps ever did our amazingly,

2282
01:42:34,140 --> 01:42:37,160
amazingly groupers and octopi hunt 
together and they do that.

2283
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:38,873
Groupers and octopi work together,
the so the group will be over the great 

2284
01:42:42,451 --> 01:42:43,284
barrier reef and the fish has gone in 
and he goes to the octopus and he goes 

2285
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:47,460
right there.
No one reason.

2286
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:48,990
He doesn't give a shit about the octopus
of course,

2287
01:42:48,991 --> 01:42:51,300
but if the octopus goes to get it and 
doesn't get it,

2288
01:42:51,301 --> 01:42:52,710
it's going to come out and the group has
got it.

2289
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:55,770
Cooperation always works better than 
working on your own.

2290
01:42:55,771 --> 01:42:56,300
Right.

2291
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:57,133
Wow.
So is there real evidence that shows 

2292
01:42:58,851 --> 01:42:59,684
that the whites of our eyes developed in
order to indicate which way we're 

2293
01:43:02,121 --> 01:43:02,420
looking?

2294
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:03,920
Well,
in all these cases,

2295
01:43:03,921 --> 01:43:06,320
all we can do is say,
let's do a little phylogenetic analysis.

2296
01:43:06,321 --> 01:43:07,154
Who's got an and who doesn't?
We're the only great ape with whites to 

2297
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:10,100
their eyes.
So 90.

2298
01:43:10,180 --> 01:43:11,550
So we're going to look at it.
Get

2299
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:15,510
this.
Here's an octopus that's chilling.

2300
01:43:15,511 --> 01:43:18,640
And is that a group or.
It's a weird look and spot it.

2301
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:21,030
I guess.
I don't know really pretty.

2302
01:43:21,031 --> 01:43:23,190
It looks like a coral trout to me.
Oh man,

2303
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:25,740
what do I know?
Look how pretty that octopuses too.

2304
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:29,270
and they're really fucking love octopus 
and they can change colors like that.

2305
01:43:29,410 --> 01:43:30,243
Yeah.
we've gone down massive rabbit holes 

2306
01:43:32,191 --> 01:43:35,310
with these things for hours at a time.
Look at it is changing right now.

2307
01:43:35,311 --> 01:43:36,150
It's.
We're watching him,

2308
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:41,810
so he's sitting there waiting and the 
fish tries to get out and the guy that's

2309
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:47,910
really cool.
The way they have the good sense to work

2310
01:43:47,911 --> 01:43:49,570
together.
Look at the octopuses matt.

2311
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:53,090
It's getting dark.
Oh cool.

2312
01:43:53,091 --> 01:43:53,924
His skin is so.
It just changes and morphs as you're 

2313
01:43:56,001 --> 01:43:58,130
looking at it.
That is so bizarre.

2314
01:43:58,640 --> 01:43:59,431
What a crate.
I didn't,

2315
01:43:59,431 --> 01:44:00,264
you know,
I didn't know that they could do this 

2316
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:02,383
until my friend remy warren came on the 
podcast and he had a television show 

2317
01:44:06,051 --> 01:44:06,884
called apex predator and within on the 
show they would study all the various 

2318
01:44:10,461 --> 01:44:13,640
ways these animals would hunt and the 
way they would,

2319
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,713
you know,
all the different adaptations to their 

2320
01:44:17,631 --> 01:44:18,464
environment,
all the different ways that they would 

2321
01:44:20,271 --> 01:44:21,104
use the environment and,
and he would try to mimic those 

2322
01:44:23,271 --> 01:44:28,271
different ways and one of the things 
that they studied was octopus and what's

2323
01:44:28,611 --> 01:44:29,800
that other fish that's like it.

2324
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:32,550
The cuddle fish,
which is also the same thing.

2325
01:44:33,060 --> 01:44:36,320
Octopus is using a clamshell.
What is he doing?

2326
01:44:37,400 --> 01:44:39,500
He's lounging.
He found that he picked it up.

2327
01:44:39,770 --> 01:44:41,680
Oh my god,
there's a bbc.

2328
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:45,410
This is crazy.
Oh my god.

2329
01:44:45,411 --> 01:44:49,510
The octopus is climbing inside of 
clamshell and then he closes it.

2330
01:44:50,420 --> 01:44:55,130
That is bananas.
There's a bbc blue planet where it shows

2331
01:44:55,131 --> 01:44:55,964
the octopus picking up all that random 
shrapnel when there's a shark coming 

2332
01:44:58,341 --> 01:45:01,490
after it and it covers itself like a big
ball and the shark keeps going.

2333
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,980
Wow.
They're super smart octopi.

2334
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:05,330
Well,
they eat sharks.

2335
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,193
You ever see that one?
There was a video where they found this 

2336
01:45:08,451 --> 01:45:11,180
aquarium was having an issue with sharks
were disappearing.

2337
01:45:11,181 --> 01:45:12,014
They couldn't figure out what was going 
on and they put a camera inside the 

2338
01:45:15,051 --> 01:45:15,884
aquarium,
but it turned out that the octopus was 

2339
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:18,853
waiting,
just chilling on the rocks till the 

2340
01:45:20,541 --> 01:45:22,910
sharks came by and then he would snatch 
them and eat them.

2341
01:45:22,970 --> 01:45:25,160
Watch this.
It's really cool to watch.

2342
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,890
He's like do to do to who?
Me don't bother with me.

2343
01:45:27,891 --> 01:45:28,724
I'm just a piece of coral.
I'm just hanging out here being clear 

2344
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:32,513
you like,
cause he looks exactly even in texture 

2345
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:39,860
like the coral,
which is so fascinating.

2346
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:42,530
But when they found this,
they were stunned.

2347
01:45:42,680 --> 01:45:45,170
They had no idea that octopus could do 
that.

2348
01:45:45,171 --> 01:45:46,004
Could not only that they could do that,
but that they would eat a shark and at 

2349
01:45:49,491 --> 01:45:51,020
the big fight.
Fuck man.

2350
01:45:51,021 --> 01:45:53,840
It's not though.
You want to squeeze the thing first,

2351
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:56,090
but it's an easy fight.
It looks like.

2352
01:45:56,091 --> 01:45:56,924
Is the thing about octopus though too?
They could sacrifice a technical and it 

2353
01:45:59,361 --> 01:46:02,030
just grows back.
So really no big deal.

2354
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:04,820
It's annoying,
but I don't even know if it's annoying.

2355
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:06,110
I mean we're just guessing.
Right.

2356
01:46:06,230 --> 01:46:11,230
So there's a fascinating animal.
There's a rivet twisted them up.

2357
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:15,830
It was an amazing case in Australia 
where a coolant brown is a biologist,

2358
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:20,120
had cuddle fish in this tank and they 
can signal like an octopus octopus.

2359
01:46:20,121 --> 01:46:20,954
They can do whatever color and in this 
tank he's got a bunch of females on one 

2360
01:46:23,421 --> 01:46:24,650
side,
a bunch of males than the other.

2361
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:28,430
So male goes in between them and he 
signals to different sides of his body.

2362
01:46:28,431 --> 01:46:29,750
He shows a female,
he's male,

2363
01:46:29,751 --> 01:46:33,080
but he shows the males that he's female,
so they want to attack him for a sidling

2364
01:46:33,081 --> 01:46:34,430
up to the female.
Yeah.

2365
01:46:34,500 --> 01:46:36,440
How smart is that?
It's weird.

2366
01:46:36,770 --> 01:46:40,970
it's weird that they split off from us 
hundreds of millions of years ago.

2367
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:42,620
Right?
Like as closely related to salary.

2368
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:43,760
Basically.
It's crazy,

2369
01:46:44,750 --> 01:46:45,583
but they're so smart and their eyes are 
similar to ours and like in the 

2370
01:46:49,321 --> 01:46:50,154
development

2371
01:46:50,190 --> 01:46:52,860
actually it's the opposite.
So there our eyes are poorly designed.

2372
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:53,694
There's a very well designed so our eyes
have all the detecting stuff is in its 

2373
01:46:57,451 --> 01:46:59,820
own way.
It's backwards and so the light comes in

2374
01:46:59,821 --> 01:47:00,654
and has to pass all the cellular bodies 
before it can get picked up by the 

2375
01:47:02,581 --> 01:47:03,414
detectors.
There's aim in the proper direction so 

2376
01:47:05,181 --> 01:47:08,850
the shit isn't in the way and we have 
this blind spot because the big thing,

2377
01:47:08,980 --> 01:47:11,220
the nerve connection,
they don't.

2378
01:47:11,221 --> 01:47:12,960
There's comes in from the back where it 
belongs.

2379
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:14,153
So what that tells you is that yeah,
we both started out with some kind of 

2380
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:20,360
randoms light sensitive spot and there's
happened to work much better if you want

2381
01:47:20,361 --> 01:47:23,520
to turn it into an eyeball than ours did
because evolution can always.

2382
01:47:23,540 --> 01:47:25,410
It only can start with what you got.
Right.

2383
01:47:25,950 --> 01:47:28,980
But there's work better because they 
could see in water.

2384
01:47:28,980 --> 01:47:29,880
I mean,
no,

2385
01:47:29,910 --> 01:47:32,650
I mean because there I think it's purely
random that they don't have.

2386
01:47:32,700 --> 01:47:33,533
We do a great job of getting rid of the 
segue of their bodies that are in our 

2387
01:47:35,401 --> 01:47:37,230
way.
So what you're it does is it wiggles all

2388
01:47:37,231 --> 01:47:39,710
the time and so if anything's retinal 
stationary,

2389
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:40,553
it's wiggling and equally with your 
eyeball you ignore it and so you don't 

2390
01:47:43,711 --> 01:47:44,970
even know.
You have your own blind spot.

2391
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:47,850
You feel it in your brain does amazing 
things to fix the problem.

2392
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:50,010
If you have a piece of lint on your eye 
or something like that,

2393
01:47:50,011 --> 01:47:50,844
if it were literally attached to vinci 
would disappear and because your brain 

2394
01:47:53,881 --> 01:47:54,210
says,
oh,

2395
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:57,150
that's irrelevant,
and so you can't see your own blind spot

2396
01:47:57,151 --> 01:48:00,780
unless you close one eye and then you 
sit there with a neutral background,

2397
01:48:00,781 --> 01:48:01,614
you move your thumb across and literally
your thumbnail disappears because that 

2398
01:48:05,010 --> 01:48:08,190
spot is just being filled in by whatever
the background and what happens with the

2399
01:48:08,191 --> 01:48:09,024
octopus.

2400
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:09,923
It doesn't have that problem because our
nerve endings creates the bond spot by 

2401
01:48:12,301 --> 01:48:13,134
being on the wrong side.
There's comes in from the back and so 

2402
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:15,954
the whole thing works beautifully.
They don't have to deal with the blind 

2403
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:19,890
spot.
Would that be as effective though in the

2404
01:48:19,891 --> 01:48:21,900
world that we live in?
Yeah.

2405
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:24,330
It's a water area irrelevant.
It's purely,

2406
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:25,164
it happenstance that the light sensitive
pit that they had started to get 

2407
01:48:28,831 --> 01:48:31,050
innovated properly from the back and 
ours didn't,

2408
01:48:31,260 --> 01:48:33,210
and then as ours evolved into an.
I mean,

2409
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:36,000
of course we don't know this,
but as far as evolved tonight,

2410
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:36,834
we just had to find ways around the 
problem that all the fancy structures 

2411
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:40,830
that we now need in front of it or in 
the way.

2412
01:48:40,920 --> 01:48:43,830
Does anything have an eye like an 
octopus that lives on land?

2413
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:45,810
Great question.
I don't know.

2414
01:48:45,811 --> 01:48:46,710
I don't see.

2415
01:48:46,710 --> 01:48:50,870
I've read something about eyes that they
think that I got shit information.

2416
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:53,780
Now you're pregnant.
Memory that they have an amazing memory.

2417
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,650
All these shows.
These still sore away.

2418
01:48:55,730 --> 01:48:57,570
That's too many shows,
man.

2419
01:48:57,571 --> 01:48:59,940
I don't have any memory anymore.
So it's like full.

2420
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,350
Yeah.
I feel like I'm like a hoarder.

2421
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:04,650
Like my house is filled with boxes of 
shit that I don't need.

2422
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:08,340
That's how brains work.
I'm afraid how brains work,

2423
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:09,174
right?
I mean it must be because like I know 

2424
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:14,370
that there's a lot of stuff in there 
that didn't use to be in there before,

2425
01:49:14,371 --> 01:49:15,204
but I also know like it's like random 
people that I should remember that I 

2426
01:49:17,881 --> 01:49:18,920
don't remember.
Yeah.

2427
01:49:18,930 --> 01:49:19,763
Well no.
The funny thing about brains is we may 

2428
01:49:20,941 --> 01:49:24,210
never forget anything but we just lose 
our capacity to access it,

2429
01:49:24,540 --> 01:49:25,373
but the data suggests it may still guide
our behavior and so every single 

2430
01:49:27,991 --> 01:49:30,990
experience you've ever had may still be 
in there and it guides your behavior,

2431
01:49:30,991 --> 01:49:31,760
but,
but it's use,

2432
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:32,593
it's annoying for you to recall it 
because it gets in the way of what you 

2433
01:49:34,051 --> 01:49:34,884
want.
And so when we talk about forgetting 

2434
01:49:36,061 --> 01:49:36,894
what we're actually talking about is 
being able to actually retrieve it and 

2435
01:49:38,761 --> 01:49:41,160
talk about it,
not to have it guide our action.

2436
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,083
Well also I can,
I can retrieve things far better if I 

2437
01:49:45,930 --> 01:49:47,950
get access the file

2438
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:48,963
by someone else's memory.
So like if you and I had an experience 

2439
01:49:51,431 --> 01:49:52,264
like 10 years ago,
we went on a camping trip or something 

2440
01:49:53,591 --> 01:49:55,930
like that and I forgot something that 
happened.

2441
01:49:56,050 --> 01:49:56,883
And you said,
do you remember what happened by the 

2442
01:49:57,461 --> 01:49:59,350
creek when mike hurt his foot away,
right?

2443
01:49:59,530 --> 01:50:01,410
Oh yes.
Exactly.

2444
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:02,830
Oh my god,
I forgot about that.

2445
01:50:02,831 --> 01:50:05,080
And then next thing you know,
you have this memory,

2446
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:05,943
right?
and so what we've done is you've broken 

2447
01:50:06,821 --> 01:50:09,330
the access in and so,
but if you,

2448
01:50:09,331 --> 01:50:11,170
you could literally find the sneakers 
were go,

2449
01:50:11,171 --> 01:50:13,090
holy crap,
you know.

2450
01:50:13,580 --> 01:50:15,450
And so that's how our brain is designed 
it,

2451
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,373
it's,
it's annoying to retrieve when you're 

2452
01:50:17,381 --> 01:50:18,940
looking for one thing to retrieve 
everything.

2453
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:23,320
If it's important or happened recently,
it probably should be retrieved.

2454
01:50:23,321 --> 01:50:26,380
If it's not,
let it sit away and it'll still got your

2455
01:50:26,381 --> 01:50:27,214
baby.
You won't put your foot in that same 

2456
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:30,370
hole when you and mike go on the camping
trip the next time.

2457
01:50:30,580 --> 01:50:31,750
But you won't even remember why.

2458
01:50:31,870 --> 01:50:32,703
Right.
And in likely significant lessons are 

2459
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:38,120
important because there are seared in 
your memory of this is a,

2460
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:39,003
this is a significant point where you 
figured something out they didn't know 

2461
01:50:41,441 --> 01:50:43,480
before and it changed the way you looked
at the world.

2462
01:50:43,750 --> 01:50:45,160
So this is seared in your memory.

2463
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:47,360
Yeah.
And so when emotions get involved,

2464
01:50:47,361 --> 01:50:50,110
you tend to have,
it's much more easily retrieved later on

2465
01:50:50,111 --> 01:50:51,410
because your brain is saying,
yeah,

2466
01:50:51,411 --> 01:50:53,900
that's our evolution,
or whatever you wanna call it is telling

2467
01:50:53,901 --> 01:50:56,060
you that it's important that should be 
retrievable.

2468
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,130
And and what you had yesterday for 
lunch,

2469
01:50:58,131 --> 01:50:59,190
I can never retrieve.

2470
01:50:59,590 --> 01:51:00,423
Right?
That's one of the reasons why 

2471
01:51:02,530 --> 01:51:03,363
epidemiology studies on diet are so 
difficult because people don't remember 

2472
01:51:06,641 --> 01:51:09,090
what that day was.
The same thing every day.

2473
01:51:09,150 --> 01:51:09,911
Yeah.
Yeah.

2474
01:51:09,911 --> 01:51:10,744
It's,
the human mind is so fascinating and it 

2475
01:51:12,851 --> 01:51:13,684
varies so much and there's so many 
different factors involved and whatever 

2476
01:51:16,931 --> 01:51:21,370
it becomes cultural factors and 
environmental factors,

2477
01:51:21,400 --> 01:51:22,233
dietary,

2478
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:23,443
and that's all that flexibility that we 
evolved to put us in that special place 

2479
01:51:26,691 --> 01:51:28,610
that we are.
And so we made a deal,

2480
01:51:28,611 --> 01:51:29,301
right?
So we said,

2481
01:51:29,301 --> 01:51:30,134
all right,
we're going to start going down this 

2482
01:51:30,741 --> 01:51:31,574
cognitive pathway,
but that means that there's very little 

2483
01:51:33,411 --> 01:51:36,590
inboard knowledge and that means that 
we're going to have to learn from people

2484
01:51:36,591 --> 01:51:38,690
older than us and people with experience
there.

2485
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:39,673
And that means that and the best way to 
learn from them as high fidelity 

2486
01:51:41,871 --> 01:51:42,704
copying.
And so if you happen to go off in a 

2487
01:51:43,951 --> 01:51:46,010
direction where they use chopsticks,
well that's how you eat.

2488
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,140
You happen to go in a direction,
that's how you eat.

2489
01:51:48,141 --> 01:51:48,974
There's a million ways to do things.
And so we started with the sort of 

2490
01:51:51,111 --> 01:51:52,220
argument about,
well,

2491
01:51:52,221 --> 01:51:53,750
it wasn't monogamy or not,
right,

2492
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:55,400
and the,
um,

2493
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:56,323
I'm arguing that by and large it was 
monogamy because you've got these 

2494
01:51:58,101 --> 01:52:01,010
systems in place that our testicles 
aren't big enough,

2495
01:52:01,011 --> 01:52:01,844
we've got cryptic ovulation,
which means that we can't tell when 

2496
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:06,560
she's fertile,
which means that we have to be available

2497
01:52:06,561 --> 01:52:07,394
sexually interested in available all the
time so we can make sure we're the 

2498
01:52:09,291 --> 01:52:10,124
father.

2499
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:12,500
And so that allows her to pair bond with
us.

2500
01:52:12,501 --> 01:52:15,980
And there's some evidence that orgasm is
a pair bonding experience,

2501
01:52:15,981 --> 01:52:18,020
certainly for females,
probably for males.

2502
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,380
it works in lots of animals via oxytocin
and vasopressin,

2503
01:52:21,381 --> 01:52:22,510
all that kind of stuff.
Right?

2504
01:52:23,060 --> 01:52:23,893
So all that suggests that probably on 
average that we evolved to do it this 

2505
01:52:27,171 --> 01:52:28,004
way,
but we're so super dooper flexible that 

2506
01:52:29,451 --> 01:52:30,680
went.
Another society says,

2507
01:52:30,681 --> 01:52:31,011
well,
hey,

2508
01:52:31,011 --> 01:52:33,440
this works for us.
Off we go and we find a way to make that

2509
01:52:33,441 --> 01:52:36,290
work.
Are there studies that compared testicle

2510
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:38,990
size of different civilizations,
different cultures?

2511
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:41,420
Yeah.
So there's a lot of argument about this.

2512
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:44,150
And the problem is that the prince,
it's racist,

2513
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:46,190
it's racist.
That's what underlies

2514
01:52:46,190 --> 01:52:48,050
a lot of it,
but we get this right,

2515
01:52:48,110 --> 01:52:50,010
so the thing is that that the,
the,

2516
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:51,223
the genetics that explain why one animal
or one species would have large 

2517
01:52:54,381 --> 01:52:57,290
testicles and other a small testicles 
are not the genetics.

2518
01:52:57,291 --> 01:53:00,140
That would explain why two different 
individuals in the same species would be

2519
01:53:00,141 --> 01:53:02,840
that way.
Because the only way to make that latter

2520
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:05,660
one work is you have to inherit a 
constellation of traits.

2521
01:53:05,870 --> 01:53:06,703
So if I'm an inherit the genes for big 
balls and for impulsiveness and for 

2522
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:14,210
having lots of kids and not caring much 
about him and all of the things that are

2523
01:53:14,211 --> 01:53:16,040
supposedly go with that,
that do.

2524
01:53:16,041 --> 01:53:16,874
When you look between species,
there's no way for the constellation of 

2525
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:22,070
traits to be inherited together.
Because remember I was talking about how

2526
01:53:22,071 --> 01:53:22,904
polygenic everything is and so they'd 
all literally need to sit next to each 

2527
01:53:25,791 --> 01:53:26,630
other on the chromosome.

2528
01:53:26,630 --> 01:53:30,170
If they've got any chance of being 
passed on as a package and they don't.

2529
01:53:30,350 --> 01:53:32,180
And you also get all the shifting around
her.

2530
01:53:32,181 --> 01:53:33,014
In meiosis.
I can't remember the term for off the 

2531
01:53:35,361 --> 01:53:39,110
top of my head,
but where the pieces of genetic material

2532
01:53:39,111 --> 01:53:39,944
move around and that virtually 
guarantees that you're not going to 

2533
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:42,314
inherit this huge constellation of 
traits within a species between species 

2534
01:53:45,771 --> 01:53:46,840
is dead easy.
You know,

2535
01:53:46,841 --> 01:53:49,730
you're A species inherits big testicles 
and inherits impulsiveness.

2536
01:53:49,731 --> 01:53:51,540
It inherits whatever,
uh,

2537
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:52,533
and our strategy just reproduce it down 
and ignore them in all that kind of 

2538
01:53:55,401 --> 01:53:56,234
stuff's dead easy.
And so cim fathers don't pay any 

2539
01:53:58,101 --> 01:53:58,934
attention to chimp babies to speak of 
because while that's their mating 

2540
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:02,534
system,
right?

2541
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,583
Whereas I'm,
you've got pair bonded gibbons and 

2542
01:54:05,661 --> 01:54:07,580
things and now parents start to play a 
much bigger.

2543
01:54:07,730 --> 01:54:09,350
Even male parents start to play a bigger
role,

2544
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:10,184
but there's no studies that show that 
human beings with archer testicles tend 

2545
01:54:12,921 --> 01:54:13,850
to ignore their children.

2546
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:14,983
Well,
so this is just that people have tried 

2547
01:54:15,801 --> 01:54:17,250
to show that,
but here's the problem.

2548
01:54:17,251 --> 01:54:21,320
And tried to show that in studies.
So lots of people make that argument and

2549
01:54:21,321 --> 01:54:23,240
it's called life history strategies 
where you say,

2550
01:54:23,241 --> 01:54:25,100
well,
you're going to develop one life history

2551
01:54:25,101 --> 01:54:28,310
strategy in these circumstances and 
another and these other circumstances.

2552
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:31,790
The problem is that you end up with 
ethnic differences in testicle size,

2553
01:54:31,791 --> 01:54:36,791
which we know exist and you also have 
ethnic differences in where in the kinds

2554
01:54:37,011 --> 01:54:37,844
of lives that people currently lead.
The difficult thing is it's super easy 

2555
01:54:40,461 --> 01:54:41,294
to look at the world we are in right now
and this is what tripped me up earlier 

2556
01:54:43,401 --> 01:54:44,234
as well.
You look at the world that we are right 

2557
01:54:45,231 --> 01:54:45,831
now and assume,
well,

2558
01:54:45,831 --> 01:54:48,170
that's the way things have always been 
and they haven't,

2559
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:52,530
and so right now you know the 
mathematics used for awhile.

2560
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,250
They're the best math in the world was 
taking place in the arabic world.

2561
01:54:55,460 --> 01:54:57,260
Now it's not anymore,
and so if you,

2562
01:54:57,470 --> 01:54:58,730
if you don't know that past,
you'd say,

2563
01:54:58,731 --> 01:54:59,564
well look,
people in the arabic world aren't as 

2564
01:55:00,711 --> 01:55:01,544
good at mathematics and they have these 
qualities and that you'd make an 

2565
01:55:03,411 --> 01:55:04,244
inference.
Right now the ethnic differences in 

2566
01:55:06,231 --> 01:55:08,330
testicles,
I believe,

2567
01:55:08,331 --> 01:55:11,180
but I can't promise you that.
it's some different.

2568
01:55:11,181 --> 01:55:14,840
West african groups happen to have the 
largest testicle size on average.

2569
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:18,410
Those west african groups tend to be 
poorer right now.

2570
01:55:18,500 --> 01:55:19,333
There's lots of things about life that 
go with being poor that looked like and 

2571
01:55:22,041 --> 01:55:22,874
our strategy,
having lots of kids and paying less 

2572
01:55:24,171 --> 01:55:27,290
attention to them,
but what you're probably looking at is a

2573
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:28,143
coincidental association between some 
biology and some part of some way that 

2574
01:55:32,241 --> 01:55:33,074
your your people happen to live that 
didn't exist a while ago and that won't 

2575
01:55:35,931 --> 01:55:36,764
exist awhile from now and so it's really
easy to try to use this research which 

2576
01:55:40,490 --> 01:55:42,440
people have to say,
well,

2577
01:55:42,650 --> 01:55:43,483
you've got primitive people who have big
testicles and low parental effort and 

2578
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:47,484
you've got some more sophisticated 
people with smaller testicles and high 

2579
01:55:49,421 --> 01:55:51,750
parental effort,
but that's genetically super naive.

2580
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:54,350
One of the things that I learned when I 
was in rome,

2581
01:55:54,650 --> 01:55:57,290
we took a tour of the vatican by this 
guy who's a professor.

2582
01:55:57,291 --> 01:56:01,340
It was really interesting.
It was cool because we have a,

2583
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:06,430
a really enthusiastic guide and who who 
could explain a lot of things to you and

2584
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:07,513
he was really excited that me and my 
family were very curious about these 

2585
01:56:09,891 --> 01:56:10,724
things too,
but one of the things that he said that 

2586
01:56:11,451 --> 01:56:12,350
was really interesting.
I said,

2587
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:13,640
okay,
I go,

2588
01:56:13,641 --> 01:56:17,150
why all the dudes have little dicks like
what's going on with that?

2589
01:56:17,450 --> 01:56:22,450
And he said that they believed that if 
you had a large penis,

2590
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:23,473
that large penises were a symbol of 
barbaric behavior and that these were 

2591
01:56:29,241 --> 01:56:30,074
crude or people and that to,
to be thought to be a sophisticated 

2592
01:56:34,611 --> 01:56:36,410
person,
you wanted a smaller penis.

2593
01:56:36,411 --> 01:56:37,244
So they actually accentuated smaller 
penises in their gods and smaller 

2594
01:56:41,031 --> 01:56:42,200
penises in their statute.

2595
01:56:42,260 --> 01:56:43,220
And that's funny.
I mean,

2596
01:56:43,221 --> 01:56:44,930
you can see these kinds of things all 
the time.

2597
01:56:45,170 --> 01:56:47,560
So early pre western contact.
Uh,

2598
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:49,790
if you look At japanese women,
they're pins,

2599
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:50,753
they're painted with their eyes as 
narrow of a slit as possible post 

2600
01:56:53,121 --> 01:56:53,954
western contact.
Now the women want more almond shaped 

2601
01:56:55,431 --> 01:56:56,264
eyes and so they start painting them 
with the beautiful women have bigger 

2602
01:56:58,191 --> 01:56:59,024
eyes.
These things can change all over the 

2603
01:57:00,051 --> 01:57:00,884
map.
I personally suspect that large penis 

2604
01:57:02,841 --> 01:57:04,880
size is also a product of sexual 
selection.

2605
01:57:05,090 --> 01:57:07,520
So it's more fun for her if he's got a 
larger penis,

2606
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:10,640
they're having sex for longer and more 
regularly because is hidden.

2607
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:11,623
So he has to be available at the time.
So she has to be available all the time 

2608
01:57:14,031 --> 01:57:16,820
or the system doesn't work and that's 
what creates pair bonding.

2609
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:19,460
So humans copulating for a very long 
period of time.

2610
01:57:19,461 --> 01:57:20,294
If you compare this to the other 
primates with the single exception of 

2611
01:57:22,341 --> 01:57:23,174
bonobos and we have way bigger penises 
than any of the other great apes and I 

2612
01:57:27,681 --> 01:57:29,840
suspect that that's something that is 
female.

2613
01:57:29,841 --> 01:57:31,640
I mean women.
I would say why are men so obsessed with

2614
01:57:31,641 --> 01:57:32,474
the penis size?
But I suspect that there the creator of 

2615
01:57:33,981 --> 01:57:35,600
it and that's why we're so obsessed with
it.

2616
01:57:35,800 --> 01:57:40,450
Women who say that are playing games,
they know that's ridiculous.

2617
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:44,500
I don't know that they are.
they're definitely playing games.

2618
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,753
That's like men who are saying,
why are women so obsessed with big 

2619
01:57:47,801 --> 01:57:49,510
breasts?
We don't even care.

2620
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:50,883
I've never met a guy who said that.
Some some asshole out there that's 

2621
01:57:53,321 --> 01:57:54,500
playing games.
Okay.

2622
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:55,580
Possibly.
You're right.

2623
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:58,653
It is fascinating when you think about 
all these different things that lead to 

2624
01:58:01,421 --> 01:58:02,254
natural selection and the fact that 
there's so many variables that are in 

2625
01:58:04,871 --> 01:58:09,250
place and that we're trying to find out 
what is better and what is not.

2626
01:58:09,251 --> 01:58:10,084
And if you have a study and this study 
finds genetic differences and ethnic 

2627
01:58:13,691 --> 01:58:15,500
genetic differences there,
there's,

2628
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:18,040
there's a lot of blowback and a lot of 
pushback against.

2629
01:58:18,280 --> 01:58:19,051
There will be.
And,

2630
01:58:19,051 --> 01:58:19,884
and one of the interesting things that 
we do know is if you think about how 

2631
01:58:22,421 --> 01:58:27,160
homosapiens evolved in africa and a 
small percentage of us left,

2632
01:58:27,370 --> 01:58:29,320
which means the majority of us didn't,
right?

2633
01:58:29,321 --> 01:58:32,050
I mean there's few randoms who lived up 
in the top right hand corner,

2634
01:58:32,051 --> 01:58:32,884
we're available to go,
which means that all the rest of the 

2635
01:58:34,811 --> 01:58:35,644
earth comes out of a few small 
percentage of the population that could 

2636
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:38,793
have left.
And so we now know there's enormous 

2637
01:58:41,140 --> 01:58:42,430
genetic variation

2638
01:58:42,430 --> 01:58:45,490
within africa,
way more genetic variation within africa

2639
01:58:45,491 --> 01:58:46,324
than outside of africa.
Then between any two people are chinese 

2640
01:58:49,151 --> 01:58:49,984
person in a norwegian prison are much 
more closely related to each other 

2641
01:58:53,351 --> 01:58:57,190
genetically then an african guy who 
lives in the next village over.

2642
01:58:57,580 --> 01:59:00,670
And because most of the genetic 
variability never left the continent.

2643
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:05,470
And so we had this idea of race as if it
has genetic meaning and it doesn't.

2644
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:08,530
But ethnicity does have genetic meaning,
right?

2645
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:09,483
So an ethnic group evolved in a very 
certain spot to deal with very certain 

2646
01:59:12,491 --> 01:59:13,324
problems and their body shape will vary 
and you've got these west africans or a 

2647
01:59:16,120 --> 01:59:19,420
really jacked with these big muscle,
a lot of quick jerk musculature.

2648
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,820
You don't see that over on east africa 
very much.

2649
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:22,963
Um,
you've got a tall people in Denmark you 

2650
01:59:25,061 --> 01:59:26,530
don't see that,
you know,

2651
01:59:26,531 --> 01:59:27,860
in other parts of europe,
etc.

2652
01:59:27,940 --> 01:59:31,020
So people are the adaptation with the 
nun to deal with the cold climate.

2653
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,863
Exactly.
Also,

2654
01:59:31,890 --> 01:59:34,990
and lots of that sanitation and a lot of
that's just random genetic drift,

2655
01:59:34,991 --> 01:59:38,170
a founder population,
the other causes that aren't evolved but

2656
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:41,020
nonetheless have a big impact on what 
the population ends up looking like.

2657
01:59:41,290 --> 01:59:44,650
It's just so amazing to consider that 
this entire species essentially,

2658
01:59:44,651 --> 01:59:46,750
except for the times that We interacted 
with,

2659
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:47,663
uh,
interbred with neanderthals came from 

2660
01:59:49,991 --> 01:59:51,910
one part of africa,
you know,

2661
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:52,873
that's one of the reasons why racism is 
so preposterous because we're 

2662
01:59:54,761 --> 01:59:57,250
essentially all africans.
We are all africans.

2663
01:59:57,290 --> 02:00:00,010
We've all of us who are out have a 
little bit of other stuff in the us,

2664
02:00:00,011 --> 02:00:01,540
but just a tiny bit,
which,

2665
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:02,730
so weird though.
We're so,

2666
02:00:02,780 --> 02:00:04,690
we're so much like dogs,
you know,

2667
02:00:04,691 --> 02:00:07,180
like a great dane can breed with a 
poodle.

2668
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,830
They DoN't look Anything like each 
other.

2669
02:00:08,890 --> 02:00:10,480
So were from another planet.
You go,

2670
02:00:10,481 --> 02:00:11,314
well that's definitely true.

2671
02:00:12,370 --> 02:00:13,203
or that's not gonna happen.
It's like if you looked at lebron james 

2672
02:00:15,731 --> 02:00:17,090
and um,
you know,

2673
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:19,480
traci lords,
right?

2674
02:00:19,510 --> 02:00:21,160
They look like two different things.
They really do.

2675
02:00:21,161 --> 02:00:23,800
And I suspect that when we ran into 
neanderthals were like,

2676
02:00:23,801 --> 02:00:25,630
oh,
she's kind of interesting looking,

2677
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:27,040
sort of hot,
sort of different.

2678
02:00:27,190 --> 02:00:28,370
And so it,
you know,

2679
02:00:28,540 --> 02:00:30,940
first of all we know humans will 
copulate with almost anything that old,

2680
02:00:30,941 --> 02:00:32,010
stale.
Yeah.

2681
02:00:32,011 --> 02:00:35,620
And things that aren't even alive.
Things that aren't alive.

2682
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:36,633
Things,
the things that they probably shouldn't 

2683
02:00:37,961 --> 02:00:38,570
be,
et cetera.

2684
02:00:38,570 --> 02:00:41,650
But the end athol ones are interesting 
because really they are cousins.

2685
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:44,110
They're cousins separated by a million 
years and some change.

2686
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:47,230
And um,
and if we don't know too much about them

2687
02:00:47,231 --> 02:00:48,400
either,
which is really weird,

2688
02:00:48,401 --> 02:00:49,234
we know they had larger brains than us,
but we don't really know how smart they 

2689
02:00:51,311 --> 02:00:52,240
were now.
And,

2690
02:00:52,330 --> 02:00:54,040
and,
and why did we replace them?

2691
02:00:54,190 --> 02:00:55,690
Yeah.
Like did we,

2692
02:00:55,780 --> 02:00:57,730
was it diseases we carry that wiped them
all out,

2693
02:00:57,940 --> 02:01:00,580
was it we were better organized.
So we got rid of,

2694
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:02,800
we all competed them.
We killed them on purpose,

2695
02:01:02,940 --> 02:01:05,020
you know,
if there's a million branch species,

2696
02:01:05,021 --> 02:01:05,854
we happen to know a lot about 
neanderthals because they are existed 

2697
02:01:07,660 --> 02:01:10,020
until very recently.
But wHat we do,

2698
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:12,310
there's all sorts of branching that took
place early on,

2699
02:01:12,311 --> 02:01:14,160
lots of different australopithecines,
et cetera.

2700
02:01:14,580 --> 02:01:15,413
All those are dead ends and you know,
the fact that we're the only one that 

2701
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:19,504
comes out of that could mean,
well we got lucky or were me in this 

2702
02:01:22,301 --> 02:01:24,520
shit and we took care of all of our 
cousins who didn't,

2703
02:01:24,521 --> 02:01:25,840
you know,
we wanted what they had.

2704
02:01:25,890 --> 02:01:27,550
I think the ladder.
Yeah.

2705
02:01:27,551 --> 02:01:29,650
Probably a bit of both mean.
Well,

2706
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:30,493
I mean that doesn't make sense.
That were mean to shit a million years 

2707
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:33,330
ago.
We're mean,

2708
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:34,210
Shit.
Exactly,

2709
02:01:34,211 --> 02:01:35,920
and what's so interesting is,
you know,

2710
02:01:35,980 --> 02:01:36,813
this is something that coming back to 
the point I was making earlier about us 

2711
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,130
cooperating,
so we evolved

2712
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,963
to cooperate with each other,
but the key is we did not evolve to 

2713
02:01:43,311 --> 02:01:44,144
cooperate across different groups,
so once you get to homo erectus and now 

2714
02:01:46,581 --> 02:01:47,414
you've got division of labor and you've 
got the capacity to plan for unfilled 

2715
02:01:50,781 --> 02:01:51,231
needs,
right,

2716
02:01:51,231 --> 02:01:53,960
where they're carrying these issue lean 
tools with them over great distances,

2717
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:54,794
et cetera.
Well now who's your most effective 

2718
02:01:56,451 --> 02:01:57,284
predator?
The occasional mammoth or saber tooth 

2719
02:01:59,491 --> 02:02:01,130
tiger will have killed the occasional 
one of us,

2720
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:04,250
but they can't possibly take us on the 
same way we can take them on.

2721
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:05,353
There's only one other thing on the 
planet that can take us on and that's 

2722
02:02:07,161 --> 02:02:07,994
ourselves.
So other groups of homo erectus would 

2723
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:10,874
have probably been a major threat.
Certainly by the time we're homo 

2724
02:02:13,531 --> 02:02:14,364
sapiens,
other groups would have been our only 

2725
02:02:15,201 --> 02:02:16,034
major threat,
and so we evolved to be kind to each 

2726
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:21,050
other within our group,
but we did not evolve to be kind outside

2727
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:21,680
our group.

2728
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,320
That doesn't mean we evolved to be mean.
We evolved to be neutral,

2729
02:02:24,321 --> 02:02:27,150
so let's see if you're going to be 
friend or foe and um,

2730
02:02:27,151 --> 02:02:28,790
and that neutrality,
super important.

2731
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:31,850
It has the potential for cooperation 
across group boundaries.

2732
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:32,684
We can change women and men can mingle 
so we don't interbreed too much amongst 

2733
02:02:36,141 --> 02:02:37,940
ourselves.
We can trade with each other.

2734
02:02:37,941 --> 02:02:41,030
Lots of good things can happen.
But the second you guys get a little bit

2735
02:02:41,031 --> 02:02:42,290
aggro with us,
you know,

2736
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:46,040
now we're in a position to just go all 
out and try to exterminate you.

2737
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,470
And so rang him as he's great data.
Richard wrangham,

2738
02:02:48,471 --> 02:02:49,304
same catching fire guy shows that if you
look at the rates of violence within 

2739
02:02:52,821 --> 02:02:56,330
human groups compared to chimps to like 
500 times more violent,

2740
02:02:56,331 --> 02:02:57,164
physically aggressive than we are,
you look at the rates between human 

2741
02:02:59,450 --> 02:03:02,270
groups equal,
they're the one to one ratio.

2742
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:04,700
So we tend to think about,
well,

2743
02:03:04,701 --> 02:03:06,770
how could it be that we're both so nice 
and so mean,

2744
02:03:07,040 --> 02:03:07,873
but we have to remember that we evolved 
to cooperate and to be nice to each 

2745
02:03:09,891 --> 02:03:11,540
other,
to be more effective killers.

2746
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:14,480
It wasn't because let's make a hippie 
paradise.

2747
02:03:14,690 --> 02:03:15,321
It's like,
shit,

2748
02:03:15,321 --> 02:03:16,154
these lines are going to eat as you and 
I got to have to get together to sort 

2749
02:03:18,591 --> 02:03:19,424
out these guys,
and so our cooperative nature is 

2750
02:03:20,961 --> 02:03:24,930
literally the flip side of the coin of 
our competitive violent killings.

2751
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:25,813
Nature.
Also the undeniable history of 

2752
02:03:28,240 --> 02:03:29,073
unbelievably ruthless tribal warfare 
would indicate that we have a long 

2753
02:03:32,441 --> 02:03:36,100
history of fighting against others that 
are like us that we don't know.

2754
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:37,163
Absolutely.
When when hunter gatherers meet each 

2755
02:03:38,611 --> 02:03:42,240
other and they do come into conflict,
which is a huge percentage of the time,

2756
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:44,940
they literally fight to the death 
because if you capture me,

2757
02:03:44,941 --> 02:03:46,950
you're going to torture me to death.
If I'm female,

2758
02:03:46,951 --> 02:03:48,570
you're gonna.
Incorporate it into your system and then

2759
02:03:48,571 --> 02:03:50,520
it's going to be okay.
Not great,

2760
02:03:50,521 --> 02:03:51,900
but okay,
but if I'm male,

2761
02:03:51,901 --> 02:03:52,734
I'm going to die so I might as well die 
fighting you now because I'm going to 

2762
02:03:54,661 --> 02:03:57,360
die on pleasantly later and that's super
common.

2763
02:03:57,361 --> 02:03:58,194
That's everywhere we see it and there's 
tons and tons of bodies that are 

2764
02:04:01,560 --> 02:04:05,310
healthily perforated that are the 
clearly the consequences of this kind of

2765
02:04:05,311 --> 02:04:06,010
wharf.

2766
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:06,843
Crazy that is thought to be even in 2018
and inevitable part of being human 

2767
02:04:11,861 --> 02:04:12,694
being,
I mean warfare even to this day is 

2768
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:16,960
thought to be inevitable because there's
no,

2769
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:20,320
I mean we would all love that one day 
there'll be no warfare,

2770
02:04:20,321 --> 02:04:22,830
but there's no indication whatsoever 
that that's taken

2771
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:23,803
not almost there and I actually,
I think pinker has got the best answer 

2772
02:04:26,451 --> 02:04:28,490
to this question which is basically,
well,

2773
02:04:28,491 --> 02:04:31,400
what structures do you need to put in 
place to make the world a safer and less

2774
02:04:31,401 --> 02:04:32,620
violent place?
And,

2775
02:04:32,621 --> 02:04:33,454
and I don't knoW if you've talked to him
about his book better angels of our 

2776
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:36,524
nature.
I know you've talked to him about more 

2777
02:04:37,381 --> 02:04:37,980
recent ones,
but

2778
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:40,320
yes.
Better angels is a great example.

2779
02:04:40,670 --> 02:04:41,503
It's a great book.
It's a great example of how we become 

2780
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:45,570
less and less violent and even over our 
lifetimes.

2781
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,653
And,
and part of that is undoubtedly better 

2782
02:04:48,601 --> 02:04:49,434
governance structure and all that.
But part of that I think is cycles on 

2783
02:04:51,391 --> 02:04:53,340
itself.
So when I was a little kid,

2784
02:04:53,341 --> 02:04:54,840
and this kind of thing probably happened
to you,

2785
02:04:55,200 --> 02:04:56,033
I was on when I was in kindergarten,
the guy who drove our car pool was a 

2786
02:04:59,401 --> 02:05:00,234
cop.
So this cop is driving me home in the 

2787
02:05:01,951 --> 02:05:02,784
back of his car.
Now he's got no seat belts because this 

2788
02:05:04,591 --> 02:05:06,720
is 1969 and cars don't have seat belts,
right.

2789
02:05:06,721 --> 02:05:07,554
Big bench seat and a buick or something.
And we'd come around a corner and they 

2790
02:05:10,321 --> 02:05:11,154
all slide up against me to the edge of 
the car seat and I'm trying to push 

2791
02:05:13,441 --> 02:05:14,400
back.
But I'm this little guy,

2792
02:05:14,401 --> 02:05:14,820
right?

2793
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,110
And I can't.
Then I hit the,

2794
02:05:16,111 --> 02:05:17,880
I mUst have hit my elbow against the 
door,

2795
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,350
flies open.
I rolled out of the car.

2796
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:21,540
Oh my god.
And I go bouncing across the street.

2797
02:05:21,541 --> 02:05:22,570
Right.
So he's,

2798
02:05:22,571 --> 02:05:23,404
you know,
he's not going to arrive home empty 

2799
02:05:23,941 --> 02:05:24,774
handed.
So of course he goes and retrieves me 

2800
02:05:25,411 --> 02:05:26,244
from the ditch and he brings me home,
shows my mum and I'm bleeding and 

2801
02:05:28,921 --> 02:05:32,250
bruised and torn shIrt and you know,
like you'd expect from bouncing out of a

2802
02:05:32,251 --> 02:05:34,560
car.
And my mom who's a pediatrician.

2803
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:36,270
So she could tell I wasn't badly 
damaged.

2804
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:37,160
It looks to me over and says,
hi,

2805
02:05:37,170 --> 02:05:38,160
he looks fine.
Don't worry about it.

2806
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,683
Can you?
Can you imagine somebody brought your 

2807
02:05:40,501 --> 02:05:41,490
kid home?
Said,

2808
02:05:41,491 --> 02:05:42,720
hey man,
I'm really sorry joe.

2809
02:05:42,870 --> 02:05:43,703
Your daughter fell out the car and 
bounced across the street to a throttle 

2810
02:05:46,231 --> 02:05:47,064
them.
It'd be freak out and that's not that 

2811
02:05:48,511 --> 02:05:49,540
long ago either.
No,

2812
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:50,453
this is 1969 when you and I are both on 
this planet and so what I think is part 

2813
02:05:53,731 --> 02:05:56,790
of what's what pinker's documenting is 
as the world gets safer,

2814
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:00,900
we start getting used to a low mayhem 
world and these,

2815
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:02,063
these mayhem event stand out in our 
minds and so it actually self 

2816
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:05,454
perpetuates where the safer it gets,
the safer we needed to be because every 

2817
02:06:08,221 --> 02:06:10,680
little thing that goes wrong stands out 
in sharper relief.

2818
02:06:11,940 --> 02:06:12,773
Very fascinating way Of looking at it.
You know what's interesting to me about 

2819
02:06:16,680 --> 02:06:17,513
pinker's work is how much pushback he 
gets and particularly about the world 

2820
02:06:20,611 --> 02:06:21,444
being a safer place.
Like people want to keep putting 

2821
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:24,833
pointing towards violent episodes and 
and racism and crime and all these 

2822
02:06:30,571 --> 02:06:31,404
different things is different factors as
if it's some sort of evidence against 

2823
02:06:34,441 --> 02:06:36,540
what he's saying when he's incorporating
that,

2824
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:41,160
those Current events into this large 
database.

2825
02:06:41,310 --> 02:06:44,910
And he's saying yes,
it's not that we don't live in utopia,

2826
02:06:45,240 --> 02:06:46,073
but the woRld is vastly safer and better
now than it was a thousand years ago or 

2827
02:06:49,681 --> 02:06:50,514
10,000
years ago or even 100 years ago or even 

2828
02:06:51,711 --> 02:06:53,790
if there's.
Why is there so much pushback

2829
02:06:53,850 --> 02:06:55,090
against this.
So the thing is,

2830
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:55,963
I think what's going on as that people 
worry that it doesn't look like a 

2831
02:06:58,121 --> 02:07:00,030
problem to be solved anymore.
Right?

2832
02:07:00,031 --> 02:07:01,480
So when you.
When our kids,

2833
02:07:01,720 --> 02:07:02,553
we both have lots of gay friends,
but we didn't know it because they're 

2834
02:07:04,211 --> 02:07:05,044
not telling anybody because someone's 
going to kick their ass if they knew 

2835
02:07:06,851 --> 02:07:08,440
that they were gay.
Now,

2836
02:07:08,441 --> 02:07:09,274
yes,
gay people are still discriminated 

2837
02:07:09,941 --> 02:07:10,774
against,
but it's so much better than it was 

2838
02:07:11,651 --> 02:07:12,970
then.
What you don't want to.

2839
02:07:13,100 --> 02:07:15,010
What I think people are advocates don't 
want to say as well,

2840
02:07:15,011 --> 02:07:15,844
there's no problem anymore because then 
you can allow them to still run into 

2841
02:07:19,061 --> 02:07:19,894
troubles in various circumstances.
Even though the trouble they run into 

2842
02:07:21,671 --> 02:07:22,504
today is a thousand times less than the 
trouble they ran into and read little 

2843
02:07:25,510 --> 02:07:28,200
same thing holds for racism.
Same thing holds for sexism.

2844
02:07:28,240 --> 02:07:29,073
They've all gotten so much better,
but and sexual violence is a perfect 

2845
02:07:32,771 --> 02:07:33,290
example.

2846
02:07:33,290 --> 02:07:34,690
You know if you look at,
if you set,

2847
02:07:34,740 --> 02:07:38,920
this is in pinker's book,
if you set rape and homicide to you call

2848
02:07:38,921 --> 02:07:39,754
it both of them,
whatever level they are in 1970 to 100 

2849
02:07:41,710 --> 02:07:42,543
and then you track them through to the 
early two thousands on homicide is in 

2850
02:07:45,731 --> 02:07:46,564
the uS.
homicides dropped down to like 50 rapes 

2851
02:07:48,370 --> 02:07:49,203
dropped down to like 25,
but if you listen to women's advocacy 

2852
02:07:52,031 --> 02:07:54,040
groups about campus sexual assault and 
stuff,

2853
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:54,874
you'd never know that and the reason you
wouldn't know it is because people 

2854
02:07:57,941 --> 02:07:58,774
worry.
Well,

2855
02:07:58,870 --> 02:08:00,850
if you think the problem's getting 
better on its own,

2856
02:08:00,851 --> 02:08:03,100
then you won't keep doing anything to 
help fix it.

2857
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:04,293
And that's a really unfortunate part of 
our psychology because it makes people 

2858
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:09,730
feel like there's been no progress and 
when you feel like there's no progress,

2859
02:08:09,731 --> 02:08:10,564
then you think,
well maybe we need to completely 

2860
02:08:11,321 --> 02:08:13,210
overturn the whole system and try 
something new.

2861
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:15,520
And that's of course the point of 
pinker's newest book,

2862
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:18,040
enlightenment.
Now no things are going fricking great.

2863
02:08:18,330 --> 02:08:20,980
Turning anarchy and all of those things 
are really bad ideas.

2864
02:08:20,981 --> 02:08:21,814
Voting for somebody like trump's a 
really bad idea because things are 

2865
02:08:23,681 --> 02:08:24,514
actually running along really nicely.
It's just that we tend to forget it 

2866
02:08:27,131 --> 02:08:27,964
because every advocacy group who's all 
worried about whatever their particular 

2867
02:08:30,701 --> 02:08:31,534
issue is,
doesn't want the word to get out that 

2868
02:08:33,341 --> 02:08:34,630
things are a lot better than they used 
to be.

2869
02:08:34,631 --> 02:08:36,370
Because I think at some fundamental 
level they think,

2870
02:08:36,371 --> 02:08:38,890
well,
25 grapes here isn't bad enough.

2871
02:08:38,891 --> 02:08:40,520
We better say that there's 100 or you 
know,

2872
02:08:40,540 --> 02:08:43,510
I'm not saying they do this consciously,
but of course 25 reps here,

2873
02:08:43,511 --> 02:08:45,310
whatever the number is,
is bad enough.

2874
02:08:45,311 --> 02:08:46,150
Right?
It doEsn't.

2875
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:49,690
It doesn't have to be the numbers that 
it used to be when I was a child to be a

2876
02:08:49,691 --> 02:08:50,380
problem at all.

2877
02:08:50,380 --> 02:08:52,840
That has to be as a number above zero.
Well,

2878
02:08:52,900 --> 02:08:53,733
there seems to.
The people develop this vested interest 

2879
02:08:56,621 --> 02:09:00,640
in promoting an idea and they want to 
exaggerate that idea.

2880
02:09:00,641 --> 02:09:01,474
Whatever it is,
whether it's the idea that the world is 

2881
02:09:02,741 --> 02:09:03,574
a safer place than it actually is,
or whether it's the world as an idea of 

2882
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:07,173
a more dangerous,
more dangerous place and it really is 

2883
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:13,090
and for whatever reason,
once we have it in our mind that this is

2884
02:09:13,150 --> 02:09:13,983
the thing we're married.
Two were married to this concept of 

2885
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:20,130
polyamorous life and that this is a 
natural way to live or that you know,

2886
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:22,720
violence is inevitable and then this is 
just a part of who we are.

2887
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:27,190
We tend to promote that and we tend to 
have massive confirmation bias and it's,

2888
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:28,593
it's.
I think it's because we personally 

2889
02:09:31,631 --> 02:09:35,320
associate ourselves with ideas.
We don't look at ideas as being a thing.

2890
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:36,423
Like if you think that something is one 
way and then you're pointed towards 

2891
02:09:40,511 --> 02:09:41,344
evidence that you're incorrect,
you feel like personally you've been 

2892
02:09:44,351 --> 02:09:47,500
slighted,
or your being somehow,

2893
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:50,470
somehow you're being diminished by your 
lack of being.

2894
02:09:50,471 --> 02:09:51,304
Correct,
but you're incorrect assumptions and 

2895
02:09:52,411 --> 02:09:54,010
notions.
You're absolutely right.

2896
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:54,873
That is a weird part of being a person.
It's a very weird part of it being a 

2897
02:09:57,611 --> 02:09:58,444
person.
It's the hardest part about being a 

2898
02:09:59,261 --> 02:10:01,960
scientist because every good scientist 
is wrong all the time.

2899
02:10:02,380 --> 02:10:04,000
I've been wrong already on your show.
Right?

2900
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:07,240
And so it's super hard to admit it 
because by human nature you just want.

2901
02:10:07,241 --> 02:10:08,074
You want.
My immediate reaction is to fight 

2902
02:10:09,221 --> 02:10:10,480
against it and not say,
well,

2903
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:11,660
hold on.
What's joe saying?

2904
02:10:11,830 --> 02:10:12,400
No,
he's right.

2905
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,990
I overstated that.
Let's back off.

2906
02:10:13,991 --> 02:10:14,824
Right?
And so there's this really lovely paper 

2907
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:19,030
that came out in 2011 by mercier and dan
sperber,

2908
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:22,150
and what they argued is,
I think they nailed it and they said,

2909
02:10:22,151 --> 02:10:22,984
here's what it is.
Our Brain actually evolved our logical 

2910
02:10:25,721 --> 02:10:28,540
processing abilities not to find out the
truth of the world,

2911
02:10:28,720 --> 02:10:29,553
but to convince you of my point of view.
And so with oUr logical abilities 

2912
02:10:33,531 --> 02:10:34,010
evolved in

2913
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:36,950
service of persuasion,
not in service of seeking out the truth,

2914
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:38,113
because of course,
if I can persuade you that the world is 

2915
02:10:40,041 --> 02:10:42,830
the way it would in a way that benefits 
bill,

2916
02:10:43,140 --> 02:10:47,480
that the world is something about the 
way bill wants the world to be is true,

2917
02:10:47,690 --> 02:10:49,550
then the world's going to be a little 
kinder to me.

2918
02:10:49,551 --> 02:10:52,280
It'll fit my worldview and others will 
give me the things I want.

2919
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:55,580
And so I go through life trying to 
persuade you of my worldview rather than

2920
02:10:55,581 --> 02:10:57,440
trying to find out what's actually out 
there.

2921
02:10:57,710 --> 02:10:58,543
And so that's why you think,
oh well smart people are going to fall 

2922
02:11:00,171 --> 02:11:01,160
for that.
No smart.

2923
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:02,940
It doesn't matter how smart you are,
you,

2924
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:04,730
you're using whatever brain power you 
have.

2925
02:11:04,760 --> 02:11:05,593
Not defined the truth,
but rather to find evidence for your 

2926
02:11:07,641 --> 02:11:09,340
particular point of view.
Well,

2927
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:10,183
I think,
I think it's also a byproduct of 

2928
02:11:11,241 --> 02:11:12,074
ignorance because for the longest time 
you could tell me something and there 

2929
02:11:14,871 --> 02:11:17,570
was very little way that I could find 
out whether or not your writer,

2930
02:11:18,490 --> 02:11:19,370
I really couldn't.

2931
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:20,450
No,
you're correct.

2932
02:11:20,451 --> 02:11:21,284
Unless I went and started doing research
and read some books and whereas now I 

2933
02:11:24,471 --> 02:11:27,350
could just pull up my phone and say,
hey,

2934
02:11:27,351 --> 02:11:29,180
bill just said this,
is that right?

2935
02:11:29,360 --> 02:11:30,440
And then the phone wIll go,
no,

2936
02:11:30,441 --> 02:11:32,030
there's been 100 different studies that 
show that,

2937
02:11:32,031 --> 02:11:33,080
and you go,
oh look,

2938
02:11:33,090 --> 02:11:34,820
motherfucker,
I got the stats.

2939
02:11:35,870 --> 02:11:38,390
That's true,
and that definitely matters a lot.

2940
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:41,120
It's this awesome democratization of 
knowledge,

2941
02:11:41,540 --> 02:11:42,373
but if that really were all that it was,
then everybody would agree on their 

2942
02:11:45,711 --> 02:11:47,750
politics.
Everybody would agree that the fake news

2943
02:11:47,751 --> 02:11:51,050
was fake and the real news was real.
Not necessarily because this is a fairly

2944
02:11:51,051 --> 02:11:51,884
recent invention,
but what I'm getting at is that I think 

2945
02:11:53,511 --> 02:11:54,344
that the ability to be deceptive was 
perhaps there was an evolutionary 

2946
02:11:58,311 --> 02:11:59,270
advantage.
Oh,

2947
02:11:59,271 --> 02:12:00,020
absolutely.
Yeah,

2948
02:12:00,020 --> 02:12:00,853
so that's one of the very first thing 
that happens when you have theory of 

2949
02:12:02,601 --> 02:12:03,434
mind,
because as soon as I realized the 

2950
02:12:04,461 --> 02:12:06,860
contents of your mind differ from the 
contents of my own,

2951
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:07,933
I say,
oh,

2952
02:12:08,060 --> 02:12:10,550
I can plant something in joe's mind 
that'll help me.

2953
02:12:10,550 --> 02:12:12,350
That ain't true,
but if he believes it is,

2954
02:12:12,351 --> 02:12:13,184
life will be better for me.
And so as soon as kids learn theory of 

2955
02:12:15,651 --> 02:12:16,461
mind,
at age four,

2956
02:12:16,461 --> 02:12:18,590
they start to lie.
And prior to theory of mind,

2957
02:12:18,591 --> 02:12:21,170
they tell the truth when it's like,
where are you playing?

2958
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:21,960
Hide and seek.
I'm right here,

2959
02:12:21,960 --> 02:12:24,410
dad.
You're supposed to keep quiet.

2960
02:12:24,440 --> 02:12:25,273
But they can't because they don't 
understand that you don't know the same 

2961
02:12:26,961 --> 02:12:27,560
things.
They know,

2962
02:12:27,560 --> 02:12:28,640
right?
Yeah.

2963
02:12:28,641 --> 02:12:29,474
And they also understand that they could
perhaps change the way you feel about 

2964
02:12:32,601 --> 02:12:35,180
them by manipulating the truth relating 
information.

2965
02:12:35,530 --> 02:12:40,530
It's what's weird is having kids and 
seeing kids grow up and troubled homes.

2966
02:12:41,690 --> 02:12:44,140
One,
one thing you see almost universally is,

2967
02:12:44,141 --> 02:12:46,210
are those kids lie a lot,
you know,

2968
02:12:46,820 --> 02:12:48,110
because you're in the no choice 
condition,

2969
02:12:48,111 --> 02:12:48,531
right?
Yeah.

2970
02:12:48,531 --> 02:12:49,364
You're in a bad spot.
And like one of my daughter's little 

2971
02:12:51,381 --> 02:12:54,490
friends is constantly lying,
but you know,

2972
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:58,880
she has a broken home and the 
situation's not good and it's just,

2973
02:12:59,300 --> 02:13:02,990
it's unfortunate.
But this little kid is tormented because

2974
02:13:02,991 --> 02:13:05,900
of it.
She's always making stuff up and all the

2975
02:13:05,901 --> 02:13:08,720
other little girls roll their eyes and 
they know she's a liar and it's.

2976
02:13:08,721 --> 02:13:11,090
IT's sad.
But the ability to be deceptive,

2977
02:13:11,630 --> 02:13:14,000
I feel like that,
you know this,

2978
02:13:14,470 --> 02:13:19,470
there's some sort of idea that we cling 
to that if you can deceive someone about

2979
02:13:20,661 --> 02:13:23,750
certain particular aspects of your mind 
or your past or what you've,

2980
02:13:24,020 --> 02:13:27,200
what you've accomplished or what you're 
capable of doing,

2981
02:13:27,590 --> 02:13:30,950
that you will have a better place in the
social chain.

2982
02:13:31,450 --> 02:13:32,220
No,
that's absolutely

2983
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:34,230
right.
And so the way I think about it is think

2984
02:13:34,231 --> 02:13:37,020
about the difference between conspecific
conflicts,

2985
02:13:37,021 --> 02:13:37,854
conflicts between members of the same 
species and conflicts between predator 

2986
02:13:40,411 --> 02:13:41,244
and prey.
So every time predator and prey 

2987
02:13:42,811 --> 02:13:45,180
interact,
eventually one of them's going to die.

2988
02:13:45,410 --> 02:13:47,460
Your editor's going to starve,
praise going to get eaten,

2989
02:13:47,461 --> 02:13:48,294
right?
But when conspecifics members of the 

2990
02:13:49,651 --> 02:13:51,960
same species interact more,
competing over something,

2991
02:13:51,961 --> 02:13:53,940
even if it's a very subtle level of 
competition,

2992
02:13:54,300 --> 02:13:57,520
we don't want to come to blows because 
if I'm trying to size you up,

2993
02:13:57,521 --> 02:14:01,380
be it physical blows or mental blows.
We suffering on both sides.

2994
02:14:01,381 --> 02:14:02,214
If we have to do get out.
And so I want to sell myself as being a 

2995
02:14:04,771 --> 02:14:07,830
little more than I really am.
I want to be bill plus 20 percent.

2996
02:14:08,190 --> 02:14:10,350
And you want to say yourself as a little
more than you really are,

2997
02:14:10,351 --> 02:14:13,410
because we know that we're not fully 
going to test each other because there's

2998
02:14:13,411 --> 02:14:17,070
negative consequences for testing and 
whenever this negative consequences,

2999
02:14:17,071 --> 02:14:17,904
even for the winter for testing,
there's a lot of posturing that's going 

3000
02:14:20,061 --> 02:14:20,894
to go on and that posturing is something
that's literally built into our psyche 

3001
02:14:23,940 --> 02:14:26,460
and we go through life trying to sell 
from flight on average.

3002
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:30,270
Not already does this,
but on average trying to sell as much as

3003
02:14:30,270 --> 02:14:31,103
we can in order to gain the things in 
life that we might not get if we're 

3004
02:14:33,511 --> 02:14:35,990
brutally honest about what our 
capabilities actually are.

3005
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:37,443
Fascinating that we cling to all of 
these ancient structures that are in 

3006
02:14:40,691 --> 02:14:41,524
place when it comes to the way we 
interact with each other and how 

3007
02:14:44,201 --> 02:14:45,034
important is the social exchanges that 
we have and that I think this is one of 

3008
02:14:48,761 --> 02:14:52,170
the reasons why we cling to ideas so 
much that these ideas,

3009
02:14:52,420 --> 02:14:55,840
if you can push an idea through,
you've got some sort of points

3010
02:14:56,010 --> 02:14:56,840
board.
Yep.

3011
02:14:56,840 --> 02:14:57,673
Got points on the board and probably 
your ideas on average are going to 

3012
02:15:00,091 --> 02:15:04,080
benefit you and my days on average 
benefit me and so if I'm,

3013
02:15:04,290 --> 02:15:05,123
if I'm happily married in a monogamous 
relationship and I'm not looking around 

3014
02:15:07,981 --> 02:15:11,040
within monogamy's,
the great thing and sleeping around is a

3015
02:15:11,041 --> 02:15:12,240
sin,
but if I'm,

3016
02:15:12,630 --> 02:15:14,460
if I'm single and I've got 
opportunities,

3017
02:15:14,580 --> 02:15:16,520
well then I probably hold alternative 
views.

3018
02:15:16,521 --> 02:15:17,354
So on average our views not perfectly,
but on average our views serve as well 

3019
02:15:20,520 --> 02:15:23,190
and if I can plant my views in your mind
and I've benefited.

3020
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:25,440
yeah,
I saw that a lot.

3021
02:15:25,640 --> 02:15:28,050
I mean,
do you see that a lot with everything,

3022
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:29,213
but I guess more what we're talking 
about people that don't want to admit 

3023
02:15:33,691 --> 02:15:34,524
like what about when it comes to like 
pinker's data about the world being a 

3024
02:15:37,621 --> 02:15:38,454
better place because they have almost a 
vested interest in stirring up fear and 

3025
02:15:41,550 --> 02:15:46,140
that they're committed in their mind.
They're committed to constantly studying

3026
02:15:46,520 --> 02:15:47,353
the wrongs of the world and the evil of 
the world and that any sort of 

3027
02:15:50,491 --> 02:15:51,324
diminishing of that is actually going to
cause harm to the people that are 

3028
02:15:54,901 --> 02:15:55,734
suffering.
So I think they have a good perk in 

3029
02:15:58,291 --> 02:16:00,150
their mind.
There's good intention,

3030
02:16:00,350 --> 02:16:01,183
I totally agree,
and the data are consistent with their 

3031
02:16:02,691 --> 02:16:03,524
strategies because on average fear 
appeals and anger appeals work a whole 

3032
02:16:06,861 --> 02:16:07,641
lot better than,
hey man,

3033
02:16:07,641 --> 02:16:09,740
things are great.
Donate to this cause and we'll keep them

3034
02:16:09,741 --> 02:16:10,600
great.
That doesn't work at all.

3035
02:16:10,630 --> 02:16:12,830
It doesn't work at all.
And so when,

3036
02:16:12,831 --> 02:16:13,664
when viagra was invented in 1989,
my little brother and I were chatting 

3037
02:16:17,571 --> 02:16:18,620
about it and we thought,
you know this,

3038
02:16:18,621 --> 02:16:19,454
I'll save some animals because there's a
lot of animals that are consumed for 

3039
02:16:21,771 --> 02:16:22,604
their presumed potency affects by like 
traditional chinese medicine consumers 

3040
02:16:26,151 --> 02:16:27,830
and things like that.
And so we thought,

3041
02:16:27,831 --> 02:16:30,230
boy,
if I ever actually works prior to viagra

3042
02:16:30,231 --> 02:16:32,980
and nothing is out there that works up 
at this 11 impact.

3043
02:16:32,981 --> 02:16:36,070
And so we wrote this little letter off,
send it to a journal and said,

3044
02:16:36,310 --> 02:16:39,130
you know that this is going to save 
certain animals like seals,

3045
02:16:39,131 --> 02:16:41,320
which they could be harvested to eat 
their penises.

3046
02:16:41,470 --> 02:16:43,360
Canadian seals.
I know a minute what?

3047
02:16:43,420 --> 02:16:46,360
I know people that you're allowed to 
kill a certain number.

3048
02:16:46,400 --> 02:16:48,250
You can't kill the seals in America,
they're protected,

3049
02:16:48,251 --> 02:16:49,360
but in Canada,
us,

3050
02:16:49,361 --> 02:16:51,640
but in Canada you can,
there's a hood seal,

3051
02:16:51,641 --> 02:16:54,430
eliminate allow men and a harp seal 
allotment,

3052
02:16:54,730 --> 02:16:57,220
and so people were killing up to their 
allotments and selling.

3053
02:16:57,221 --> 02:16:58,054
You could do it solely for the penis and
sell the penis for enough money to make 

3054
02:17:00,431 --> 02:17:01,750
your money back.
Now,

3055
02:17:01,751 --> 02:17:04,050
what purpose does the seals penis have 
beyond the seals?

3056
02:17:04,210 --> 02:17:05,500
Original purpose.
Zilch.

3057
02:17:05,501 --> 02:17:07,570
Right?
But they eat it because it's supposed to

3058
02:17:07,571 --> 02:17:08,404
make you more potent,
satisfied as a rhino horn rhino horn as 

3059
02:17:11,031 --> 02:17:12,880
an example.
That's used for lots of different things

3060
02:17:12,881 --> 02:17:16,330
so it's less likely to be helped,
but the seal penis is only,

3061
02:17:16,331 --> 02:17:17,164
you know,
people basically only using it for its 

3062
02:17:18,161 --> 02:17:19,810
potency.
And then when fire comes along,

3063
02:17:19,811 --> 02:17:22,080
like literally you're shopping in the 
supermarket where you could have by,

3064
02:17:22,090 --> 02:17:22,923
you're going to get,
I'll have some ceo peanuts or I'll take 

3065
02:17:24,371 --> 02:17:25,300
a viagra.
Well,

3066
02:17:25,301 --> 02:17:27,670
we just said people are going to switch.
We were greeDy.

3067
02:17:27,671 --> 02:17:29,770
You throw both of them to try them both.
And.

3068
02:17:29,771 --> 02:17:31,380
And people did actually.
But,

3069
02:17:31,500 --> 02:17:32,333
but we,
we made this argument and we literally 

3070
02:17:33,491 --> 02:17:34,324
were attacked by the world wildlife fund
government looking at plan to revive 

3071
02:17:37,511 --> 02:17:42,511
seal peanuts.
What hold the fuck on is this recent?

3072
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:46,330
It was updated,
was published in 2015,

3073
02:17:46,331 --> 02:17:47,560
but it was updated.
This may

3074
02:17:47,990 --> 02:17:50,870
what the government is looking at a 
plan,

3075
02:17:50,930 --> 02:17:55,930
go back up to revive seal penis sales.
Okay.

3076
02:17:56,960 --> 02:18:00,230
This must be a plan was brought to the 
government.

3077
02:18:00,231 --> 02:18:01,064
This must not be the worst way of like 
looking at that headline is that the 

3078
02:18:04,071 --> 02:18:05,120
government's thinking,
man,

3079
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:07,460
we got to fucking revive these penis 
sales.

3080
02:18:07,610 --> 02:18:08,443
No one's buying.

3081
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:09,853
Because they actually may be thinking 
that because you got some relatively 

3082
02:18:12,001 --> 02:18:14,580
impoverished people are hunting for them
and no one's buying them anymore.

3083
02:18:15,050 --> 02:18:16,410
So if you're not going to.
Well,

3084
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:20,880
if you're not going to reveal the report
drafted by the for institute.

3085
02:18:20,910 --> 02:18:21,743
Yeah,
there you go.

3086
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:22,833
Aimed at creating new markets to support
an earlier proposal to kill a hundred 

3087
02:18:27,071 --> 02:18:27,904
and 40,000
gray seals over five years in the 

3088
02:18:30,041 --> 02:18:30,874
southern gulf of st laurence.
Seventy percent of gray seals that 

3089
02:18:35,561 --> 02:18:38,950
frequent the area so that what they want
to do is they want to diminish the.

3090
02:18:39,010 --> 02:18:40,060
Okay,
here's what it is.

3091
02:18:40,390 --> 02:18:41,223
They have long complained that the 
growing population of gray seals is to 

3092
02:18:43,241 --> 02:18:46,180
blame for eating too many commercially 
viable fish,

3093
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,940
which has resulted in repeated calls for
a call.

3094
02:18:49,060 --> 02:18:51,070
Okay,
so they want to kill the seals.

3095
02:18:51,370 --> 02:18:52,203
So to save the fish market,
so they're going to get people to buy 

3096
02:18:54,191 --> 02:18:54,660
dick.

3097
02:18:54,660 --> 02:18:56,460
Right?
So They make it financially viable.

3098
02:18:56,500 --> 02:18:57,700
Look at this.
This is racist.

3099
02:18:57,970 --> 02:18:58,803
The penises have juvenile adult animals 
may be dried and sold as sexual 

3100
02:19:01,721 --> 02:19:04,150
enhancement products,
particularly the asian buyers.

3101
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:05,693
Well,
that's because it's not meant to be 

3102
02:19:06,241 --> 02:19:08,340
racist is because in traditional chinese
medicine,

3103
02:19:08,341 --> 02:19:10,560
the seal penis was used as a potency 
product.

3104
02:19:10,620 --> 02:19:12,030
I understand,
but the target,

3105
02:19:12,031 --> 02:19:13,590
those agents,
those poor fools,

3106
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:15,660
but they're not portfolios anymore 
because you know what?

3107
02:19:15,661 --> 02:19:18,600
They switched.
So we wrote this paper and literally the

3108
02:19:18,601 --> 02:19:21,300
world wildlife fund attacks tax us and I
did not see that coming.

3109
02:19:21,301 --> 02:19:22,490
Right?
I thought,

3110
02:19:22,500 --> 02:19:23,333
boy,
the world wildlife fund is going to be 

3111
02:19:24,031 --> 02:19:26,250
psyched because here's some good news 
for a change.

3112
02:19:26,610 --> 02:19:27,770
But they don't.
Good news,

3113
02:19:27,771 --> 02:19:28,130
they only

3114
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:31,790
want bad news because people pay and 
they do what they can to fix things when

3115
02:19:31,791 --> 02:19:35,000
it's bad news and they forget that you 
got to have some good news along the way

3116
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:38,420
or people give up.
Look at this list says here,

3117
02:19:38,630 --> 02:19:39,463
asian consumers,
particularly athletes also consume a 

3118
02:19:41,751 --> 02:19:43,400
beverage called.
How do you say that?

3119
02:19:43,401 --> 02:19:47,570
Dallas shen oral liquid that is made 
from seal penis and testicles,

3120
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:51,230
which they believe to be energizing and 
performance enhancing.

3121
02:19:51,530 --> 02:19:53,060
How about some studies?
motherfucker,

3122
02:19:53,061 --> 02:19:56,540
before you start eating sealed dick's,
try it.

3123
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:57,760
See a.
No,

3124
02:19:58,770 --> 02:19:59,740
don't need that.
Check it.

3125
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:02,240
Why would you take that one?
You can get fucking viagra.

3126
02:20:02,300 --> 02:20:04,340
Exactly.
Guarantee a viagra is better.

3127
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:06,140
It is.
I mean if it's not better,

3128
02:20:06,170 --> 02:20:08,360
it's good enough.
Like what are you trying to do?

3129
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:10,220
So.
So we actually,

3130
02:20:10,700 --> 02:20:12,470
because we got attacked by the world 
wildlife fund,

3131
02:20:12,471 --> 02:20:13,304
we sent a,
one of my graduate student from Hong 

3132
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:16,723
Kong,
we descend them to go back to Hong Kong 

3133
02:20:17,631 --> 02:20:19,500
for the holidays to go back to you.

3134
02:20:19,980 --> 02:20:21,770
The world wildlife fund,
because they said that were wrong.

3135
02:20:21,771 --> 02:20:23,630
people won't switch.
They say,

3136
02:20:23,631 --> 02:20:24,310
what?
How would,

3137
02:20:24,310 --> 02:20:26,270
how did they phrase it where they wrote 
an article?

3138
02:20:26,271 --> 02:20:27,840
They rebutted us and they said,
no,

3139
02:20:27,860 --> 02:20:28,820
no,
our data show,

3140
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,790
when we tried to get people to switch 
from ryan,

3141
02:20:30,791 --> 02:20:32,110
oh,
and tiger horn to aspirin,

3142
02:20:32,120 --> 02:20:32,953
they wouldn't.
And so they want sprint so they won't 

3143
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:36,200
switch to viagara.
And I'm like,

3144
02:20:36,201 --> 02:20:37,940
look,
I think fire is different from aspirin.

3145
02:20:38,090 --> 02:20:39,500
I got a headache,
I take an aspirin.

3146
02:20:39,690 --> 02:20:40,523
So yeah,
I think my headache got better faster 

3147
02:20:41,721 --> 02:20:43,400
than it would have otherwise.
A little bit vague.

3148
02:20:43,700 --> 02:20:44,960
You need a viagra,
you take it.

3149
02:20:44,961 --> 02:20:45,441
You're like,
yep,

3150
02:20:45,441 --> 02:20:46,274
that sucker worked right.
There's visual evidence and so we argue 

3151
02:20:48,761 --> 02:20:49,594
that it's different.
And so we actually went into these 

3152
02:20:51,231 --> 02:20:52,064
clinics and we asked people in 
traditional chinese clinics in Hong 

3153
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:56,750
Kong,
what do you take for a headache?

3154
02:20:56,750 --> 02:20:59,150
What do you take for gout?
What do you take for rectal dysfunction?

3155
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:01,070
And that was the one case where they'd 
switched.

3156
02:21:01,370 --> 02:21:03,800
So consumers all over the world,
they know when a pro,

3157
02:21:03,850 --> 02:21:06,320
a better product comes along.
They know when they've got no options.

3158
02:21:06,321 --> 02:21:07,410
Like what?
You might as well eat seals,

3159
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:10,610
penis because that's as good as anything
or because nothing works.

3160
02:21:11,090 --> 02:21:13,520
Maybe you'll get a little bit of a 
placebo effect or you know.

3161
02:21:13,521 --> 02:21:13,881
Oh,
hey,

3162
02:21:13,881 --> 02:21:15,230
look,
there's something that actually works.

3163
02:21:15,231 --> 02:21:17,210
That's what I'm going to buy.
What I read about the.

3164
02:21:17,270 --> 02:21:22,140
One of the issues with rhino horn with 
some asian buyers is that also it's a.

3165
02:21:22,430 --> 02:21:25,430
It's a signal of affluence.
That's exactly right.

3166
02:21:25,580 --> 02:21:27,130
Yeah.
It's prestige purchase,

3167
02:21:27,140 --> 02:21:27,973
so sad.
It is sad as shit ever because that is 

3168
02:21:30,681 --> 02:21:35,681
such a crazy animal bizarre creature 
that almost seems like a living dinosaur

3169
02:21:36,650 --> 02:21:40,130
it looks at and we're losing them left 
and right now because people are killing

3170
02:21:40,131 --> 02:21:40,964
them for their fucking horn,
which just basically just collagen 

3171
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:44,720
fingernail.

3172
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:46,490
Yeah.
It's bananas.

3173
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:49,850
IT just doesn't make any sense to me 
that that is still,

3174
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:53,540
that they haven't realized that there's 
no value in it,

3175
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:56,700
that there's no physical value.
It doesn't really give you erections and

3176
02:21:57,850 --> 02:21:58,990
fever,
fever.

3177
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:00,680
It's got to have a long list 
unfortunately,

3178
02:22:01,390 --> 02:22:02,700
and then they're still buying it and 
they're.

3179
02:22:03,050 --> 02:22:06,020
And they're buying it again for athletes
like they get a kick.

3180
02:22:06,021 --> 02:22:07,520
Exactly.
It's like buying a maserati.

3181
02:22:07,700 --> 02:22:09,770
Wow.
That's so crazy.

3182
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:12,260
That's so sad.
Oh,

3183
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:13,820
my daughter's outside the door.
Hi.

3184
02:22:14,240 --> 02:22:15,410
Get out of here.
You bothering us?

3185
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:17,811
Um,
yeAh.

3186
02:22:17,811 --> 02:22:21,680
It's so strange to me that there are 
these specific cases,

3187
02:22:21,681 --> 02:22:22,371
right?
Like,

3188
02:22:22,371 --> 02:22:23,204
it's not like people are looking for a 
giraffe horns like funny is they're 

3189
02:22:26,491 --> 02:22:29,820
looking for rhino horn.
Like what do you think that they made an

3190
02:22:29,821 --> 02:22:31,290
association like,
damn,

3191
02:22:31,291 --> 02:22:33,440
if I was jack liquor wine,
oh this chick's like,

3192
02:22:33,510 --> 02:22:35,370
man,
I need to get that horn and eat it.

3193
02:22:35,370 --> 02:22:36,203
And my dick get hard.
Like I do think so because if you look 

3194
02:22:37,891 --> 02:22:38,724
at the long list of products,
they look pretty phallic and mostly 

3195
02:22:40,891 --> 02:22:43,380
people he'd phallic things in order to 
gain potency.

3196
02:22:43,440 --> 02:22:45,330
Is there something crazy about seal 
dicks?

3197
02:22:45,750 --> 02:22:47,730
Like what's going on with decently 
sized?

3198
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:49,290
Decent.
A good word for that.

3199
02:22:49,291 --> 02:22:52,380
I like that.
And so you know,

3200
02:22:52,381 --> 02:22:53,610
you think,
oh that sucker,

3201
02:22:53,611 --> 02:22:54,930
I'll get big too.
Right?

3202
02:22:55,440 --> 02:22:56,273
We're so weird.
But it's so weird that in the face of 

3203
02:22:58,651 --> 02:22:59,484
new evidence that people haven't adopted
this new evidence and they still clean 

3204
02:23:03,181 --> 02:23:04,530
it.
At least some people claim to.

3205
02:23:04,570 --> 02:23:06,100
But here's the thing.
So our,

3206
02:23:06,260 --> 02:23:09,270
our pre modern ancestors didn't 
understand germs at all,

3207
02:23:09,271 --> 02:23:10,350
right?
There was no way they could have.

3208
02:23:10,351 --> 02:23:12,840
It's such a bizarre idea that something 
that small could kill you,

3209
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:15,300
but they did know that if I touched you 
when you were sick,

3210
02:23:15,301 --> 02:23:16,380
I might end up sick too.

3211
02:23:16,740 --> 02:23:19,260
And that seems almost like a magical 
transference.

3212
02:23:19,380 --> 02:23:21,360
And if you accept this and they all know
that,

3213
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:22,373
like they,
they'll,

3214
02:23:22,410 --> 02:23:23,880
they'll shy away.
We all evolve.

3215
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:24,743
chimpanzees will shy away from 
disgusting stuff and open source and 

3216
02:23:28,110 --> 02:23:28,980
people really.
Yeah,

3217
02:23:28,981 --> 02:23:29,814
absolutely.
if you get the right kinds of illness 

3218
02:23:30,691 --> 02:23:32,110
that,
that manifests,

3219
02:23:32,130 --> 02:23:34,770
that you're seriously outwardly sick and
contagious,

3220
02:23:34,771 --> 02:23:39,000
people find it disgusting.
And so that kind of magical contagion.

3221
02:23:39,030 --> 02:23:39,863
It's super easy to see why.
Well then it make you think that while 

3222
02:23:41,671 --> 02:23:43,850
ryan and warren will make my dick bigger
too.

3223
02:23:43,960 --> 02:23:45,210
Yeah,
I guess,

3224
02:23:46,110 --> 02:23:47,940
I mean,
are there any instances where that stuff

3225
02:23:47,941 --> 02:23:49,950
is real where it does actually work that
way?

3226
02:23:50,880 --> 02:23:52,410
Not that I,
I can't think of any,

3227
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,670
but it is the case that,
that you,

3228
02:23:54,671 --> 02:23:57,120
you being sick Will make me sick.
No question,

3229
02:23:57,121 --> 02:24:00,240
but nothing that like you eat and 
animals thing you consume.

3230
02:24:00,600 --> 02:24:01,770
No,
but If it is the case,

3231
02:24:01,771 --> 02:24:04,610
imagine that,
that like after you and I chat you said,

3232
02:24:04,611 --> 02:24:05,161
hey,
bill here,

3233
02:24:05,161 --> 02:24:07,620
have my jacket,
and now I go out with your jacket on.

3234
02:24:07,621 --> 02:24:08,371
And people go,
oh man,

3235
02:24:08,371 --> 02:24:09,204
he's got joe rogan jacket,
he's cool and now I've got a little bit 

3236
02:24:10,951 --> 02:24:13,400
of your cool and now the girls are like 
me too.

3237
02:24:14,430 --> 02:24:15,263
LIke when hercules put the lion's head 
on the head over and the lions thing on 

3238
02:24:19,970 --> 02:24:23,190
it that you,
you kicked some ass to have that thing.

3239
02:24:23,220 --> 02:24:24,510
That's true.
Yeah.

3240
02:24:24,810 --> 02:24:25,800
Yeah.
I guess,

3241
02:24:25,940 --> 02:24:27,180
you know,
it's just,

3242
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:30,670
we're so weird,
you know,

3243
02:24:31,170 --> 02:24:32,003
just uh,
the human animal itself is just such a 

3244
02:24:33,571 --> 02:24:34,404
strange thing and the more you study it,
the more you go deeper and deeper into 

3245
02:24:37,201 --> 02:24:38,034
the layers of weirdness that we are.
And psychology is pretty good about 

3246
02:24:41,701 --> 02:24:44,070
finding out.
Our average weirdnesses were not so good

3247
02:24:44,071 --> 02:24:44,904
at finding out they're really unusual 
weirdnesses because we can't predict 

3248
02:24:46,741 --> 02:24:48,870
that one out of a thousand behavior very
well.

3249
02:24:49,170 --> 02:24:52,140
We can predict what people tend to do 
when the bell curves tend to split.

3250
02:24:52,350 --> 02:24:53,183
We can't say what some random psycho or 
genius or artist or whatever we'll do 

3251
02:24:56,611 --> 02:24:59,520
under those circumstances because that's
not what our models are designed for.

3252
02:24:59,870 --> 02:25:02,010
You know,
it's um,

3253
02:25:02,390 --> 02:25:05,130
it,
it's so interesting when you think about

3254
02:25:05,131 --> 02:25:05,964
our interactions also with all the 
various animals that we've come up come 

3255
02:25:10,381 --> 02:25:12,030
across like all,
all throughout our,

3256
02:25:12,330 --> 02:25:15,870
our,
our life as human beings and that people

3257
02:25:15,871 --> 02:25:19,880
have chosen some to,
some to cherish and some to,

3258
02:25:20,190 --> 02:25:23,770
some to take on as food sources and some
to worship and,

3259
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:25,960
and,
and often it makes good sense.

3260
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:28,580
So dogs are great because we have great 
vision though.

3261
02:25:28,581 --> 02:25:29,414
Our noses and ears don't work very well.
If we could have somebody around who 

3262
02:25:31,661 --> 02:25:33,640
could hear and smell well and is on our 
side,

3263
02:25:33,910 --> 02:25:35,230
that's a huge plus,
right?

3264
02:25:35,230 --> 02:25:36,063
It's worth feeding that thing or at 
least tolerating it and they need some 

3265
02:25:37,951 --> 02:25:40,090
scraps.
And some of them cats,

3266
02:25:40,150 --> 02:25:40,931
you know,
they're annoying.

3267
02:25:40,931 --> 02:25:41,764
They don't like you,
but they're good at killing rats and 

3268
02:25:43,151 --> 02:25:45,370
other vermin that would,
once we were agriculturalists,

3269
02:25:45,610 --> 02:25:47,380
those kind of vermin would have been a 
real problem.

3270
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,870
They'd have been largely irrelevant when
we're still hunter gatherers,

3271
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:51,213
but so we had dogs.
We domesticated those while we were 

3272
02:25:53,081 --> 02:25:53,914
hunter gatherers,
but cat's the best I know is like 

3273
02:25:55,781 --> 02:25:56,614
ancient Egypt and these,
these societies and in that storing 

3274
02:25:58,570 --> 02:26:01,780
grain and things like that.
So those ancient systems make good sense

3275
02:26:01,781 --> 02:26:02,614
that you're making a deal with an animal
that can achieve something that you 

3276
02:26:04,481 --> 02:26:05,314
can't achieve and of course you're 
living in a world without chemicals and 

3277
02:26:07,361 --> 02:26:08,194
machines and all that kind of stuff,
but tons of them are just totally 

3278
02:26:11,111 --> 02:26:11,944
random.
And in this culture that thing is a 

3279
02:26:13,210 --> 02:26:14,320
worshiped in this culture.

3280
02:26:14,320 --> 02:26:16,420
It's eaten and you know,
and that,

3281
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:18,250
that sort of stuff is super hard to 
predict.

3282
02:26:18,490 --> 02:26:20,950
Now in studying all this stuff and 
writing this book,

3283
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:24,760
how much has this changed the way you 
just see humans?

3284
02:26:24,761 --> 02:26:27,840
Like as you're just going to the mall,
it does change it,

3285
02:26:27,841 --> 02:26:28,511
right?
So you see,

3286
02:26:28,511 --> 02:26:31,540
like I,
I remember being proud of my son when he

3287
02:26:31,541 --> 02:26:36,400
told a lie because I was like,
oh good I made and so we're in the,

3288
02:26:36,480 --> 02:26:39,880
we're in the playground and this little 
boys playing with him and my son doesn't

3289
02:26:39,881 --> 02:26:40,714
have a lunchbox at all.
He doesn't own one and the little boy 

3290
02:26:42,581 --> 02:26:45,700
says I got a spiderman lunchbox and my 
son is like four,

3291
02:26:45,701 --> 02:26:46,534
four and a half.
And he looks at the kid and he doesn't 

3292
02:26:47,651 --> 02:26:48,484
know spiderman.
It's because he hasn't seen the show 

3293
02:26:49,121 --> 02:26:50,670
yet.
But he knows it's obvious.

3294
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:51,260
The kids bragging.

3295
02:26:51,260 --> 02:26:52,750
It's obviously something good.
And he goes,

3296
02:26:52,751 --> 02:26:53,920
yeah,
I got a grasp man.

3297
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:57,650
And a leaf man lunchbox.
Nobody.

3298
02:26:57,670 --> 02:26:58,810
He just made the shit up,
right?

3299
02:26:59,190 --> 02:27:00,850
Because spiders,
right?

3300
02:27:00,851 --> 02:27:03,700
The spiderman or a grasp and he's 
looking around for other things.

3301
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:04,833
Right?
And so I was actually proud of it 

3302
02:27:05,651 --> 02:27:07,690
because it showed a.
He's got theory mind down,

3303
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:09,520
he knows what the kid can and can't 
know.

3304
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:10,503
And b,
he knows that telling these stories are 

3305
02:27:12,040 --> 02:27:14,560
gonna be important for his place in the 
social hierarchy.

3306
02:27:14,800 --> 02:27:16,990
So the kid looks at me and I'm like,
trying not to laugh,

3307
02:27:17,020 --> 02:27:19,330
right,
because I got to support my son and he's

3308
02:27:19,331 --> 02:27:19,991
like,
really?

3309
02:27:19,991 --> 02:27:21,490
And I'm like,
damn right kid.

3310
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:26,440
And so you can imagine that it,
without this background,

3311
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:27,370
you might say,
look,

3312
02:27:27,371 --> 02:27:28,204
we should discourage this kind of lying,
but it gives you a little bit of a 

3313
02:27:30,371 --> 02:27:31,300
different perspective on it.

3314
02:27:31,310 --> 02:27:32,890
It also probably weird because you,
you know,

3315
02:27:32,891 --> 02:27:34,150
your kid realizes,
yeah,

3316
02:27:34,151 --> 02:27:35,520
my dad's got my back.
Like,

3317
02:27:35,590 --> 02:27:38,800
well that's good to know.
Thanks bro.

3318
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:40,233
Exactly.
And then she'd always have your kids 

3319
02:27:41,141 --> 02:27:42,070
back.
Yeah.

3320
02:27:42,340 --> 02:27:44,440
But grass man and leaf man,
you got to pull them aside.

3321
02:27:44,441 --> 02:27:44,801
Like,
dude,

3322
02:27:44,801 --> 02:27:48,520
you gotta come up with an animal to try 
to do something that's got.

3323
02:27:49,240 --> 02:27:50,740
Well congrats man.
Actually do.

3324
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:53,790
Besides photosynthesize by cow.
Exactly.

3325
02:27:54,490 --> 02:27:56,560
But he was on the spur of the moment and
he's only four.

3326
02:27:56,561 --> 02:27:58,600
So I decided it was good enough.
You know,

3327
02:27:58,800 --> 02:28:02,440
that that is also cattle worshiping is 
very fascinating to um,

3328
02:28:02,590 --> 02:28:05,260
the uh,
like the hindus and all these different,

3329
02:28:05,620 --> 02:28:06,453
different tribes and different cultures 
that were shipped cattle were other 

3330
02:28:09,551 --> 02:28:11,170
people just thought of them as food 
sources.

3331
02:28:11,230 --> 02:28:12,370
Right?
And so again,

3332
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:15,190
now I don't know the origins that,
but you could imagine a system whereby,

3333
02:28:15,191 --> 02:28:18,670
well if you keep cattle and you benefit 
from them rather than eating them,

3334
02:28:18,671 --> 02:28:20,020
you're going to get some gains from 
that.

3335
02:28:20,050 --> 02:28:22,070
And we do know when you shift from being
a hunter

3336
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:23,990
gatherer to basically kill in an eaton 
stuff,

3337
02:28:24,140 --> 02:28:24,973
to being a pastoralist,
so your cattle or sheep or whatever or 

3338
02:28:27,351 --> 02:28:30,440
to being a farmer,
you suddenly have to start taking on the

3339
02:28:30,441 --> 02:28:31,274
long game.
So humans are perfectly capable of 

3340
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,080
envisioning unfelt needs no matter what 
kind of society they're in.

3341
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:38,770
But hunter gatherers they're living for 
today and so it's,

3342
02:28:38,860 --> 02:28:39,830
it's kill it,
you know,

3343
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:41,840
hunted,
shared out amongst all of us.

3344
02:28:41,960 --> 02:28:45,560
And then we eat it and then we'll worry 
about tomorrow when it comes along.

3345
02:28:45,830 --> 02:28:48,380
Well,
once you shift to having herds or having

3346
02:28:48,381 --> 02:28:49,130
land,
you can't.

3347
02:28:49,130 --> 02:28:49,963
That psychology doesn't work anymore.
And so what's super interesting is it 

3348
02:28:52,701 --> 02:28:53,534
took literally like 10 or 20,000
years we've got the implements in place 

3349
02:28:57,470 --> 02:29:00,440
to be agricultural is,
but we're not planting and it just,

3350
02:29:00,441 --> 02:29:02,060
we're just grinding stuff that we 
gather.

3351
02:29:02,061 --> 02:29:04,040
And why did it take so long to plant 
when maybe it was,

3352
02:29:04,041 --> 02:29:05,390
whether,
maybe it was a bunch of things,

3353
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:08,150
but part of it is you have to shift your
psychology over and say,

3354
02:29:08,151 --> 02:29:09,830
all right,
I got to stop thinking about eating,

3355
02:29:09,930 --> 02:29:11,540
killing and eating it today.

3356
02:29:11,540 --> 02:29:12,141
I got to say,
well,

3357
02:29:12,141 --> 02:29:12,974
all right,
well would it be beneficial to me to 

3358
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:15,583
keep this beast around and have it for 
tomorrow and drink it's blood or it's 

3359
02:29:18,621 --> 02:29:19,454
milk or whatever.
And one way to get there might have 

3360
02:29:21,261 --> 02:29:22,094
been,
well let's create a religion that says 

3361
02:29:23,301 --> 02:29:25,280
we can't eat them today because that'll 
solve it immediately.

3362
02:29:25,460 --> 02:29:27,890
Right.
That's one way to look at it.

3363
02:29:27,891 --> 02:29:28,724
But have you ever looked into some of 
the other hypothesis on the origin of 

3364
02:29:31,851 --> 02:29:32,684
cattle worship?
I think it again has to do with 

3365
02:29:34,251 --> 02:29:35,440
psilocybin because.
Oh,

3366
02:29:35,540 --> 02:29:36,890
that could be too.
That'd be totally cool.

3367
02:29:37,130 --> 02:29:39,110
Grown cow shit.
And that'd be totally cool.

3368
02:29:39,111 --> 02:29:39,944
And not only that,
but it would because it has benefits so 

3369
02:29:41,171 --> 02:29:42,830
like societies can do anything they 
want,

3370
02:29:42,980 --> 02:29:45,140
right.
And there's some crazy systems that they

3371
02:29:45,141 --> 02:29:46,970
do in a lot of those are really bad 
ideas.

3372
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:48,043
There's sources of infection and disease
and death and those societies tend not 

3373
02:29:50,841 --> 02:29:51,674
to grow,
but societies that do things that 

3374
02:29:53,001 --> 02:29:53,834
happened to be good ideas,
even if they got it from mushrooms and 

3375
02:29:55,611 --> 02:29:58,700
things like that,
those are going to really pass along.

3376
02:29:58,700 --> 02:30:01,070
And so you've got a lot of people on 
this planet to worship cows,

3377
02:30:01,310 --> 02:30:02,143
which suggests that whatever got that 
started actually probably had a benefit 

3378
02:30:04,761 --> 02:30:07,980
because those societies grew and 
worshiping god,

3379
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,290
not something like when you come to me 
and say,

3380
02:30:09,291 --> 02:30:11,210
hey man,
I worship cows and I'm thinking,

3381
02:30:12,490 --> 02:30:13,151
okay,
I,

3382
02:30:13,151 --> 02:30:14,510
I'd rather eat them,
but fine.

3383
02:30:14,840 --> 02:30:15,673
It's hard to imagine being persuaded,
but it's easy to imagine growing up in 

3384
02:30:18,141 --> 02:30:19,640
that system over imitating,
right?

3385
02:30:19,641 --> 02:30:20,474
We talked about that.
You automatically just copy to add 

3386
02:30:22,641 --> 02:30:23,301
warships,
cows,

3387
02:30:23,301 --> 02:30:25,190
things are working out well for him,
I'll do the same.

3388
02:30:25,580 --> 02:30:28,220
And then you've got.
And that's a good thing for your society

3389
02:30:28,221 --> 02:30:29,054
too because you can drink.
It's blood or it's milk or whichever 

3390
02:30:30,590 --> 02:30:32,180
you're lactose tolerant,
whatever you do,

3391
02:30:32,510 --> 02:30:34,340
and then that allows you to society to 
grow.

3392
02:30:34,580 --> 02:30:39,530
Was there anything surprising to you in 
writing this book and researching it and

3393
02:30:39,531 --> 02:30:40,310
putting it together?

3394
02:30:40,310 --> 02:30:43,970
Was there anything that really just had 
made you step back and go,

3395
02:30:43,971 --> 02:30:46,460
wow,
I didn't see that one common look.

3396
02:30:46,461 --> 02:30:47,294
There's a lot of things that I didn't 
see coming and a lot of times where I 

3397
02:30:49,041 --> 02:30:52,160
thought I had an idea of how it all 
worked and then I thought I would read a

3398
02:30:52,161 --> 02:30:53,180
lot more papers and like,
oh,

3399
02:30:53,181 --> 02:30:54,014
that's not even possible.
They didn't have that capability or 

3400
02:30:55,491 --> 02:30:58,220
whatever.
What surprised me was that I.

3401
02:30:58,540 --> 02:30:59,373
A big part of where this book comes from
is that then colleagues would say they 

3402
02:31:02,301 --> 02:31:03,560
would know I'm working on this,
and they'd say,

3403
02:31:03,561 --> 02:31:04,394
well,
come give a talk at my conference on 

3404
02:31:05,541 --> 02:31:06,890
leadership,
and I'd say,

3405
02:31:06,891 --> 02:31:07,724
well,
I don't know anything about leadership 

3406
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:08,600
nickel.
Well,

3407
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:10,880
surely something.
It must have implications for that,

3408
02:31:11,240 --> 02:31:13,510
and every time they asked me to do that,
you know,

3409
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:14,450
I'd say,
okay,

3410
02:31:14,451 --> 02:31:15,284
I'll give it a try.

3411
02:31:15,440 --> 02:31:17,260
And then literally you sit down and you 
think about it,

3412
02:31:17,290 --> 02:31:17,781
you realize,
wow,

3413
02:31:17,781 --> 02:31:21,330
there are important implications for 
leadership or innovation or happiness or

3414
02:31:21,331 --> 02:31:22,164
sociality and I never saw them coming.
And so it was literally friends of mine 

3415
02:31:25,411 --> 02:31:26,244
kind of forced.
I had one goal which is to just 

3416
02:31:27,481 --> 02:31:28,314
understand social intelligence and how 
did we become so socially intelligent 

3417
02:31:31,800 --> 02:31:32,633
and the.
And that was where I started in friends 

3418
02:31:35,011 --> 02:31:36,480
just kept asking me to look at other 
things.

3419
02:31:36,481 --> 02:31:38,130
And every time I did there was an 
answer.

3420
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:40,020
Sometimes it was an answer that is 
easier to find.

3421
02:31:40,021 --> 02:31:42,240
It seems harder to find,
but it was always there.

3422
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:43,403
And what that tells me is that there's 
really a lot of value in taking the 

3423
02:31:46,651 --> 02:31:49,080
anthropology and the biology and putting
them together and saying,

3424
02:31:49,081 --> 02:31:50,250
all right,
where did we come from?

3425
02:31:50,460 --> 02:31:52,740
And now what can that tell us about who 
we are today?

3426
02:31:52,950 --> 02:31:53,783
That's an interesting.

3427
02:31:53,920 --> 02:31:54,753
It's sort of a intellectual exercise to 
write a different perspective on the 

3428
02:31:59,301 --> 02:32:03,020
material that you're going over.
And if somebody forces you into a little

3429
02:32:03,021 --> 02:32:06,530
box,
like tell me what you know,

3430
02:32:06,740 --> 02:32:07,573
what's the influence on or what the 
impact on creativity or what's the 

3431
02:32:10,191 --> 02:32:11,024
impact on leadership or all these 
different things just to give you a 

3432
02:32:13,821 --> 02:32:15,980
different view.
Let's look at it from the left.

3433
02:32:16,010 --> 02:32:17,960
Let's look at it from the top.
So I'll get it from below.

3434
02:32:18,050 --> 02:32:20,010
And that's what's so fun about sciences.
You can say,

3435
02:32:20,011 --> 02:32:20,844
all right,
well let's see if it tells us anything 

3436
02:32:22,111 --> 02:32:22,944
that either we already know is true and 
now we could get new things that we 

3437
02:32:25,081 --> 02:32:27,570
would know about it or if it tells us 
something that we don't even know,

3438
02:32:27,571 --> 02:32:28,404
but that might explain the way the world
is and both of those are valuable 

3439
02:32:30,991 --> 02:32:33,990
because then you can run off and try to 
test them and a lot of dead ends.

3440
02:32:33,991 --> 02:32:34,824
I mean that's what science is all about,
but some of them will hopefully not be 

3441
02:32:36,961 --> 02:32:38,640
dead ends and you have runoff and test 
and say,

3442
02:32:38,641 --> 02:32:40,560
holy shit,
now I understand innovation.

3443
02:32:40,590 --> 02:32:41,510
Now I understand whatever.

3444
02:32:41,790 --> 02:32:42,623
Well,
what's interesting about this kind of 

3445
02:32:43,381 --> 02:32:47,760
material is that it gives you,
to me as an individual,

3446
02:32:47,761 --> 02:32:48,594
it gives me insight in my own behavior 
and I think it would do a lot of people 

3447
02:32:53,880 --> 02:32:54,713
do all of us some real good if we had a 
better understanding of what our 

3448
02:32:58,621 --> 02:33:02,130
motivations are and how we got to this 
point in civilization,

3449
02:33:02,430 --> 02:33:04,120
what we actually are,
you know,

3450
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:06,630
I mean maybe it will or won't change 
your behavior,

3451
02:33:06,631 --> 02:33:08,430
but at least it will give you some 
insight into.

3452
02:33:09,040 --> 02:33:11,920
I totally agree.
And the thing is that when I find myself

3453
02:33:11,921 --> 02:33:12,754
getting upset because you disagree with 
me about something trivial or even 

3454
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:18,670
important like politics or something and
it takes a second,

3455
02:33:18,671 --> 02:33:19,191
you got stumped.
Say,

3456
02:33:19,191 --> 02:33:20,650
hold on,
I don't have any privilege.

3457
02:33:20,651 --> 02:33:22,510
Access to the right way to do things 
right?

3458
02:33:22,660 --> 02:33:23,493
And so the fact that you care more about
x and I care more about why it doesn't 

3459
02:33:26,261 --> 02:33:28,930
mean that you're an evil person and must
be overcome.

3460
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:32,680
It means that probably we ought to be 
talking to each other and trying to find

3461
02:33:32,681 --> 02:33:34,870
a compromise solution that makes things 
work best.

3462
02:33:34,900 --> 02:33:37,840
But there's this automatic instead I 
think that you are evil,

3463
02:33:38,250 --> 02:33:40,260
absolutely with me.
And so the beauty of this kind of,

3464
02:33:40,290 --> 02:33:42,830
the more you know about this stuff in 
the past and our evolutionary origins,

3465
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:43,833
the more you know that literally we've 
evolved to do that because if we didn't 

3466
02:33:46,271 --> 02:33:47,260
do that,
we're screwed,

3467
02:33:47,500 --> 02:33:50,020
but now we don't need to anymore.
And so now we can say,

3468
02:33:50,021 --> 02:33:50,854
well,
hold on,

3469
02:33:50,950 --> 02:33:51,783
I'm a lefty and you're in my example.
You're a righty and we disagree about 

3470
02:33:55,331 --> 02:33:56,920
this particular president,
but a fine.

3471
02:33:57,130 --> 02:33:57,963
Let's see if we can both agree on a goal
that will make both of us happy rather 

3472
02:34:00,071 --> 02:34:00,311
than,
no,

3473
02:34:00,311 --> 02:34:02,350
you're evil and all I have to do is 
overcome you.

3474
02:34:02,710 --> 02:34:03,543
One of the things that I've really tried
very hard from doing this podcast is to 

3475
02:34:07,121 --> 02:34:10,300
not be attached to ideas and to do that 
as an exercise.

3476
02:34:10,301 --> 02:34:12,340
And I think over the course of the years
I've been doing this,

3477
02:34:12,341 --> 02:34:14,320
I've gotten way,
way better at that,

3478
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:19,240
but it's just so fascinating.
I encounter in the raw form,

3479
02:34:19,430 --> 02:34:20,263
like when I go to a party and I just run
into some guy who's a dad and he brings 

3480
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:24,370
something up and I tell them,
well,

3481
02:34:24,400 --> 02:34:27,550
that's not totally true because of this,
and then you see this.

3482
02:34:27,970 --> 02:34:28,803
The blood starts pumping,
the heart starts beating and they're 

3483
02:34:31,031 --> 02:34:35,500
trying to look at some way you're wrong 
and it becomes a personal thing.

3484
02:34:35,501 --> 02:34:36,970
It gets very,
very heated

3485
02:34:37,250 --> 02:34:40,940
and it's easy for all of us to do that 
in my job and your job is the same.

3486
02:34:40,941 --> 02:34:42,140
It's to say,
okay,

3487
02:34:42,141 --> 02:34:45,320
is it time to abandon this idea?
Is there a time the defendant and when I

3488
02:34:45,321 --> 02:34:48,080
was young and an academic,
there was no way I was abandoning.

3489
02:34:48,290 --> 02:34:50,610
That was last quarter.
it was going to do is defense,

3490
02:34:50,611 --> 02:34:53,540
so you attack me and I marshall 
everything I can and I try to attack you

3491
02:34:53,541 --> 02:34:54,374
back.
And it was some of my colleagues were 

3492
02:34:55,311 --> 02:34:55,851
like,
hey man,

3493
02:34:55,851 --> 02:34:58,190
you know when you're wrong,
it's cool.

3494
02:34:58,191 --> 02:34:59,630
That's what science is.
And I'm like,

3495
02:34:59,631 --> 02:35:00,590
ah,
you're right.

3496
02:35:00,591 --> 02:35:01,580
You're right.
I've got to start.

3497
02:35:01,790 --> 02:35:02,623
And so now,
even though I love the give and take of 

3498
02:35:04,461 --> 02:35:06,950
academics and I love to argue about 
stuff I tried really,

3499
02:35:06,951 --> 02:35:07,784
really hard to keep in my mind.
Well what if what You're saying right 

3500
02:35:09,801 --> 02:35:11,540
now is right.
Rather than trying to just attack it,

3501
02:35:11,541 --> 02:35:13,910
which is my automatic instinct to say,
well,

3502
02:35:14,060 --> 02:35:14,893
what is it that you're saying now might 
be a value that I should actually be 

3503
02:35:17,631 --> 02:35:19,090
incorporating and not trying to stomp 
on.

3504
02:35:19,350 --> 02:35:20,183
Yeah.
And also just the ideas aren't you 

3505
02:35:23,160 --> 02:35:23,993
exactly.
Your you and these ideas are just 

3506
02:35:25,291 --> 02:35:26,370
something that you're tossing around

3507
02:35:26,550 --> 02:35:27,980
beach ball.
Exactly rIght.

3508
02:35:27,981 --> 02:35:30,580
And that's super hard to keep in mind 
because everything that,

3509
02:35:30,650 --> 02:35:32,990
that we come to own,
we get attached to.

3510
02:35:33,350 --> 02:35:34,183
And if I tend to have my ideas because 
they tend to make the world a more 

3511
02:35:36,831 --> 02:35:40,730
hospitable place to bill.
And in a way I kind of do need to defend

3512
02:35:40,731 --> 02:35:43,860
them because if you convince me no,
the way the world should work is whoever

3513
02:35:43,861 --> 02:35:45,890
is strongest gets everything while I'm 
stuffed.

3514
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:49,480
And so I need to try to fight against a 
lot of alternative views.

3515
02:35:49,530 --> 02:35:51,740
And,
and I have to overcome that in my effort

3516
02:35:51,741 --> 02:35:53,540
to find what the right answer is as 
well.

3517
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:54,553
So it's,
it makes good sense that our ideas are 

3518
02:35:55,821 --> 02:35:58,040
like possessions,
that we have attitudes toward our ideas,

3519
02:35:58,160 --> 02:35:59,990
just like we have toured the objects 
that we own,

3520
02:35:59,991 --> 02:36:01,880
that means something to us,
to our family,

3521
02:36:01,881 --> 02:36:02,780
to our group,
et cetera.

3522
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:06,530
That all makes really good sense.
And the other side of that coin is if we

3523
02:36:07,010 --> 02:36:10,130
talking about the way things used to be 
in a premedical world,

3524
02:36:11,030 --> 02:36:11,863
if you're the chances of you carrying 
different pathogens and I carry is 

3525
02:36:14,151 --> 02:36:16,670
reasonably high and if you infect me,
I'm screwed.

3526
02:36:16,970 --> 02:36:17,803
Now if you do tHings differently than I 
do think so you eat this food and I eat 

3527
02:36:20,841 --> 02:36:22,700
that.
Food was different.

3528
02:36:22,701 --> 02:36:23,534
Could actually be wrong from my 
perspective because if I do what you've 

3529
02:36:25,791 --> 02:36:26,624
done,
I'm like get myself sick because you've 

3530
02:36:27,411 --> 02:36:28,970
adapted to that,
that thing.

3531
02:36:29,180 --> 02:36:32,750
And so we literally probably for good 
evolutionary reasons,

3532
02:36:32,900 --> 02:36:33,733
came to view cultural ways of doing 
things that are different as if they're 

3533
02:36:35,630 --> 02:36:37,280
wrong.
Because that saved us,

3534
02:36:37,281 --> 02:36:38,114
that protected us from the kind of 
pathogen vectors that you've gotten 

3535
02:36:40,161 --> 02:36:41,630
adapted to,
but that I haven't.

3536
02:36:42,110 --> 02:36:45,500
That's fascinating.
So that this is almost like ingrained in

3537
02:36:45,501 --> 02:36:46,210
us.
Well,

3538
02:36:46,210 --> 02:36:49,910
as we've evolved to be this way and so 
it's hard to undo that.

3539
02:36:50,550 --> 02:36:51,383
Do you think that with the access to 
information that we're currently 

3540
02:36:54,001 --> 02:36:54,834
enjoying that because there's so much 
information now and it's so easy to get 

3541
02:36:59,101 --> 02:36:59,934
to that perhaps there'll be more 
instances of people not becoming 

3542
02:37:04,321 --> 02:37:07,440
attached to their ideas and recognizing 
that they are there.

3543
02:37:07,441 --> 02:37:11,910
They are separate the you are just to 
thinking organism and what the facts are

3544
02:37:11,911 --> 02:37:16,070
and what reality is is just something 
that's happening and you don't

3545
02:37:16,070 --> 02:37:18,950
have to be personally attached to it.
It's not a part of your identity.

3546
02:37:18,951 --> 02:37:23,000
I hope so because in an ideal world we 
could have the things that were attached

3547
02:37:23,001 --> 02:37:26,090
to that don't really matter.
I'm an iphone guy and you're an android,

3548
02:37:26,140 --> 02:37:27,220
but who cares?
Right.

3549
02:37:27,230 --> 02:37:29,310
We cOuld argue about it.
It'd be silly and have time.

3550
02:37:29,690 --> 02:37:31,820
Exactly.
We could still be friends and all that,

3551
02:37:31,821 --> 02:37:35,200
and then we could win something that 
mattered and know this,

3552
02:37:35,380 --> 02:37:38,930
this political strategy will make 
everyone poor or sick or whatever.

3553
02:37:39,080 --> 02:37:39,913
Then We could be willing to change their
minds because in the end i think we've 

3554
02:37:42,441 --> 02:37:45,260
got this evolved desire to latch on to 
these things,

3555
02:37:45,261 --> 02:37:50,261
these ideas and values and um,
and products even and all that.

3556
02:37:50,810 --> 02:37:51,643
And so it'd be nice if we could do it 
with the trivial and let the stuff that 

3557
02:37:54,681 --> 02:37:57,290
really matters.
Guide rna by its accuracy.

3558
02:37:57,350 --> 02:37:58,550
Well,
it'd be also nice if that.

3559
02:37:58,670 --> 02:38:00,570
The stuff that we do with trivial,
it's,

3560
02:38:00,571 --> 02:38:03,810
it stays actually trivial because 
there's so many people will,

3561
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:04,783
I guess it goes with sports teams and.
but it also goes with like brands of 

3562
02:38:08,451 --> 02:38:10,910
cars.
Like I've heard people say,

3563
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:12,580
I've always been a ford guy.
Love for.

3564
02:38:12,600 --> 02:38:13,433
It's like,
okay,

3565
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:15,380
yeah.
It probably reminds you of the ford your

3566
02:38:15,381 --> 02:38:18,950
dad drove or whatever I guess.
But it's like I would never buy a chevy.

3567
02:38:19,690 --> 02:38:22,130
I know.
Really never.

3568
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,080
It's funny,
isn't it?

3569
02:38:23,081 --> 02:38:26,900
If the best fucking car was a chevy and 
you have the opportunity to buy it,

3570
02:38:26,901 --> 02:38:27,350
you're like,
no,

3571
02:38:27,350 --> 02:38:28,430
no.
I'm a ford guy.

3572
02:38:28,431 --> 02:38:29,240
Like,
right.

3573
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:32,380
What benefits?
It's some strange reason.

3574
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:37,220
There's some weird motivation to stick 
to your initial statements.

3575
02:38:37,390 --> 02:38:38,223
Yeah,
so I think it's like oliver wendell 

3576
02:38:39,291 --> 02:38:40,124
holmes or someone who's had a foolish 
consistency is the hoBgoblin of small 

3577
02:38:42,351 --> 02:38:43,184
minds.
Right?

3578
02:38:43,370 --> 02:38:47,240
But we all have these consistencies 
because part of the problem Is if I move

3579
02:38:47,241 --> 02:38:49,040
around with the wind,
you look at me as I'm a [inaudible],

3580
02:38:49,150 --> 02:38:49,740
right?

3581
02:38:49,740 --> 02:38:52,910
stand flop.
If I can't stand by what I believe in,

3582
02:38:52,911 --> 02:38:54,920
then you have no respect for me,
but what if you.

3583
02:38:55,190 --> 02:38:58,490
What if you.
What you believe in is incorrect,

3584
02:38:58,910 --> 02:39:00,990
right?
That's how you play into that.

3585
02:39:02,110 --> 02:39:03,440
That's where it gets real,
right?

3586
02:39:03,500 --> 02:39:05,830
So what you.
Obviously what you ideally want is,

3587
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:08,870
here's my value structure and it's 
unchangeable and then negotiable.

3588
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:10,123
And yet when you show me that I'm in 
that my attitudes are impeding my own 

3589
02:39:13,251 --> 02:39:14,084
goals,
then I'm willing to change them to 

3590
02:39:14,961 --> 02:39:15,794
achieve that value structure.
And I think the best politicians and 

3591
02:39:18,681 --> 02:39:19,514
scientists and artists and comedians and
all the rest of the ones who can do 

3592
02:39:22,671 --> 02:39:23,170
that.
Well,

3593
02:39:23,170 --> 02:39:24,410
yeah.
Well I like what you said.

3594
02:39:24,411 --> 02:39:26,690
Like here's my value structure.
This is,

3595
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:28,550
these are my ethics,
these are my morals,

3596
02:39:28,551 --> 02:39:30,860
this is how I treat people,
this is who I am.

3597
02:39:31,250 --> 02:39:33,170
But all that other stuff is just 
information.

3598
02:39:33,250 --> 02:39:35,000
Yeah.
It's all a means to an end.

3599
02:39:35,180 --> 02:39:37,490
And so some people care a lot about 
loyalty.

3600
02:39:37,730 --> 02:39:38,563
Other people care a lot about fairness.
Other people care a lot about sanctity 

3601
02:39:41,571 --> 02:39:42,201
and purity,
right?

3602
02:39:42,201 --> 02:39:43,640
There's different values that are 
important.

3603
02:39:43,641 --> 02:39:45,050
All of the world.
We all care about them,

3604
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:48,530
but some people wait one set more 
important more than another set.

3605
02:39:48,830 --> 02:39:49,640
John hyde,
if you.

3606
02:39:49,640 --> 02:39:50,960
I don't know if you've had him on your 
show,

3607
02:39:51,410 --> 02:39:52,243
he does this work and he's one of the 
first people that push these ideas and 

3608
02:39:54,951 --> 02:39:57,350
you can predict them by people's 
politics and stuff like that.

3609
02:39:57,620 --> 02:40:00,350
And so if we all agree,
they all matter,

3610
02:40:00,380 --> 02:40:01,213
but the problem is then we get into an 
argument where you tell me loyalty is 

3611
02:40:03,531 --> 02:40:06,950
more important than I tell you,
fairness or harm is really important and

3612
02:40:06,951 --> 02:40:09,970
then we're never going to see eye to eye
and probabilities,

3613
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:12,770
you know,
with two humans that are healthy.

3614
02:40:12,990 --> 02:40:14,310
That's an interesting discussion

3615
02:40:14,310 --> 02:40:15,143
because why do you think fairness is 
more important and why do I think 

3616
02:40:17,460 --> 02:40:20,610
discipline is more important than 
fairness or education is more,

3617
02:40:20,611 --> 02:40:24,630
or whatever it is.
I think that when someone clings to this

3618
02:40:24,631 --> 02:40:28,140
idea that this is the most significant 
aspect of human civilization,

3619
02:40:28,141 --> 02:40:28,974
that's always weird and it's hard when 
they can't acknowledge other 

3620
02:40:31,081 --> 02:40:32,370
possibilities.
Right?

3621
02:40:32,550 --> 02:40:33,510
And some,
and again,

3622
02:40:33,570 --> 02:40:35,010
all of these things are,
I hate to say it,

3623
02:40:35,011 --> 02:40:36,480
but they're like 50 percent genetic,
right?

3624
02:40:36,570 --> 02:40:40,710
Some of us are more openminded and some 
of us are more closed minded and there's

3625
02:40:40,711 --> 02:40:43,680
probably good reasons to be that way 
that made your,

3626
02:40:44,100 --> 02:40:46,980
that made you successful under one set 
of circumstances versus another.

3627
02:40:46,981 --> 02:40:48,270
Because you know,
extroversion,

3628
02:40:48,300 --> 02:40:49,133
for example,
almost all people prefer extroverts or 

3629
02:40:51,450 --> 02:40:52,283
introverts,
but extroverts are all sorts of risks 

3630
02:40:53,821 --> 02:40:54,654
for disease because they're constantly 
up in everyone's face and so an 

3631
02:40:56,851 --> 02:40:57,684
ancestral environment,
so it was probably pretty costly to be 

3632
02:40:59,281 --> 02:41:00,114
extroverted and you paid a price in that
introverts didn't have to pay when you 

3633
02:41:02,971 --> 02:41:03,804
got sick,
but it's also like we gained so much 

3634
02:41:05,371 --> 02:41:07,770
creativity and insight from introverts 
course.

3635
02:41:07,830 --> 02:41:08,170
No,
but,

3636
02:41:08,170 --> 02:41:09,600
but,
but at a social level,

3637
02:41:09,601 --> 02:41:10,434
extroverts benefit introverts might 
benefit by then running microsoft and 

3638
02:41:12,841 --> 02:41:15,120
being the greatest artist and all that.
And that's again,

3639
02:41:15,440 --> 02:41:18,060
as we talked about this earlier,
the beauty about being human is how many

3640
02:41:18,061 --> 02:41:20,040
different ways you can achieve the same 
goal.

3641
02:41:20,750 --> 02:41:23,400
What are your thoughts on the influence 
of epigenetics?

3642
02:41:23,910 --> 02:41:25,900
Look at super interesting.
So my,

3643
02:41:25,930 --> 02:41:27,620
my.
I know little about it,

3644
02:41:27,750 --> 02:41:28,583
very little about it.
My behavioral genetics colleague insist 

3645
02:41:30,711 --> 02:41:31,544
that there's no good evidence among 
humans for multigenerational epigenetic 

3646
02:41:34,471 --> 02:41:35,304
effects.
We know that they exist now in some 

3647
02:41:36,901 --> 02:41:37,734
animals.
We can do the experiments pretty easily 

3648
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:42,750
to get these multigenerational epigenic 
epigenetic effect.

3649
02:41:42,751 --> 02:41:43,980
Explain to people what we're talking 
about.

3650
02:41:44,010 --> 02:41:47,370
Yeah.
So epigenetics is basically you can turn

3651
02:41:47,371 --> 02:41:48,204
genes on and off in the simplest sense,
and so environmental factors will 

3652
02:41:51,211 --> 02:41:52,044
matter,
like maybe when you're in utero there's 

3653
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,710
a famine and that's a common thing 
that's looked at.

3654
02:41:55,710 --> 02:41:57,690
We'll look at that in rats,
for example,

3655
02:41:57,691 --> 02:41:58,524
will underfeed the mother when the 
baby's in there and that causes the 

3656
02:42:01,630 --> 02:42:02,463
baby's methylation of some of the jeans.
I don't understand the science of it at 

3657
02:42:05,581 --> 02:42:06,414
all,
but the turn some jeans on and some 

3658
02:42:07,891 --> 02:42:12,840
jeans off and so a baby of a of a mother
rat who was raised who is in utero,

3659
02:42:12,841 --> 02:42:16,350
when the mother was underfed will mature
more rapidly.

3660
02:42:16,351 --> 02:42:17,184
It'll eat everything that's not nailed 
down and it'll have sex with lots more 

3661
02:42:19,741 --> 02:42:21,810
rats than unregular than a rat that 
wasn't,

3662
02:42:21,960 --> 02:42:22,481
that,
didn't have it.

3663
02:42:22,481 --> 02:42:23,314
Some other starved.
And the key thing is that makes good 

3664
02:42:25,291 --> 02:42:27,210
sense because it's a way to respond to 
times of famine.

3665
02:42:27,390 --> 02:42:28,223
Grow as fast as you can,
reproduce as quickly as you can because 

3666
02:42:30,361 --> 02:42:32,280
you know reproductions of currency,
of evolution,

3667
02:42:32,460 --> 02:42:34,320
the fact that you exist and live is 
trivial.

3668
02:42:34,440 --> 02:42:37,590
The fact that you passed on your genes.
That's what evolution works with,

3669
02:42:38,100 --> 02:42:38,933
so it's a great way to change with the 
local environment and there's some very 

3670
02:42:43,051 --> 02:42:46,140
interesting evidence that then those 
effects are even in the next generation,

3671
02:42:46,141 --> 02:42:50,070
so the child of a rat that was.
That was in a mother who was underfed.

3672
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:52,410
We'll also have some of these strategies
I think,

3673
02:42:52,411 --> 02:42:54,040
believe they find that in humans as 
well.

3674
02:42:54,041 --> 02:42:56,520
We all have suffered from famine.
That's the argument,

3675
02:42:56,700 --> 02:42:57,533
but none of the data.
My behavioral genetics colleagues says 

3676
02:42:58,981 --> 02:43:01,620
none of those data are robust enough.
It's sort of like some of the criticisms

3677
02:43:01,621 --> 02:43:03,090
you made of what I've said and you're 
right,

3678
02:43:03,270 --> 02:43:04,103
the data suggests things that might be,
but there's lots of alternative 

3679
02:43:06,540 --> 02:43:07,373
explanations so we don't yet know it 
will get read as about longevity and 

3680
02:43:11,170 --> 02:43:12,010
that there was some sort

3681
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:12,843
of evidence that points to the 
descendants of people who survived 

3682
02:43:16,301 --> 02:43:17,770
famine.
They,

3683
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:19,870
they live longer.
Right?

3684
02:43:19,871 --> 02:43:23,530
And so the question might be why.
So we know,

3685
02:43:23,531 --> 02:43:25,720
for example,
that if you're in utero,

3686
02:43:25,721 --> 02:43:29,020
during famine,
males are more likely to be aborted than

3687
02:43:29,021 --> 02:43:30,490
females.
When it gets really bad,

3688
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:34,780
female fetuses are probably more robust,
but if you ignore that gender effect,

3689
02:43:34,960 --> 02:43:35,793
in all probability,
those fetuses that could survive in a 

3690
02:43:37,841 --> 02:43:40,840
mother during feminine might just be the
more robust specimens.

3691
02:43:40,841 --> 02:43:43,030
Right?
and so you might just be calling out the

3692
02:43:43,031 --> 02:43:46,010
people who wouldn't have lived as long 
and so it's super hard to,

3693
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:47,920
you know,
you don't do experiments on these things

3694
02:43:47,921 --> 02:43:48,754
in humans.
You can do experiments in mice and rats 

3695
02:43:50,781 --> 02:43:52,540
and,
and try to find these things out.

3696
02:43:52,541 --> 02:43:53,920
The downside is,
you know,

3697
02:43:54,010 --> 02:43:54,843
if you've read about a million cancer 
drugs that are really going to help us 

3698
02:43:56,921 --> 02:43:57,700
and then they disappear.

3699
02:43:57,700 --> 02:44:00,580
It's because it works in a mouse and it 
doesn't work in us.

3700
02:44:01,060 --> 02:44:04,930
And the downside of these things is even
mice and rats differ from each other and

3701
02:44:04,931 --> 02:44:07,150
so,
and we're a long way from either of them

3702
02:44:07,151 --> 02:44:09,490
and so the epigenetic effects,
did they show?

3703
02:44:09,491 --> 02:44:12,070
There may be good reasons why we don't,
you know,

3704
02:44:12,490 --> 02:44:13,323
there's some real ethical questions in 
regard to running studies like that on 

3705
02:44:17,951 --> 02:44:19,420
human being.
Exactly.

3706
02:44:19,570 --> 02:44:23,740
We're going to have to develop headless 
humans in a lab that have no soul,

3707
02:44:23,860 --> 02:44:24,693
that we could do tests on what we could,
but I actually think that what will get 

3708
02:44:27,881 --> 02:44:31,330
really good at is the issue you raised 
earlier and that is,

3709
02:44:31,480 --> 02:44:33,370
I don't know everything that's ever 
happened to you,

3710
02:44:33,460 --> 02:44:34,293
but some day it'll be possible to know a
ton of that stuff and I'll be able to 

3711
02:44:37,181 --> 02:44:40,870
rule out all sorts of alternative causes
and diet is a perfect example.

3712
02:44:40,870 --> 02:44:42,400
You guys talk about that a lot on this 
show.

3713
02:44:42,401 --> 02:44:43,234
Well,
how do we know that this particular 

3714
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,300
collection of foods will actually do you
any good?

3715
02:44:46,301 --> 02:44:47,950
How do we know how well people are 
sticking to it?

3716
02:44:48,280 --> 02:44:51,310
And a big part of those effects are 
actually the psychological effects.

3717
02:44:51,311 --> 02:44:53,910
So protein is a really good example that
you know,

3718
02:44:53,950 --> 02:44:57,880
steve simpson argued in the early 
nineties that if you started with locus,

3719
02:44:58,030 --> 02:44:58,863
that animals are motivated to eat as a 
function of how much protein that 

3720
02:45:01,331 --> 02:45:02,164
they've consumed.
And so the atkins diet was the right 

3721
02:45:04,481 --> 02:45:06,880
idea,
but a misunderstanding of the cause.

3722
02:45:07,060 --> 02:45:09,100
It's just the protein.
We evolved to feel full.

3723
02:45:09,101 --> 02:45:09,934
When you get protein,
we didn't evolve to feel full from 

3724
02:45:11,291 --> 02:45:12,124
carbohydrates and there's a host of 
reasons for that and there's a host of 

3725
02:45:13,781 --> 02:45:15,340
other effects that are going on at the 
same time,

3726
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:19,090
but the consequence of that is then when
people's diets move around,

3727
02:45:19,300 --> 02:45:19,871
you say,
oh look,

3728
02:45:19,871 --> 02:45:21,490
this diet is this affecting that one 
doesn't,

3729
02:45:21,491 --> 02:45:24,400
but you don't actually know what they've
been doing because some diets are harder

3730
02:45:24,401 --> 02:45:26,260
to maintain and they're cheating more 
whatever.

3731
02:45:26,800 --> 02:45:29,590
Someday we'll have much better evidence 
and all of that.

3732
02:45:29,591 --> 02:45:31,800
You'll be wearing a device.
I'll know what you consumed.

3733
02:45:31,801 --> 02:45:33,640
I'll know which aisle,
an accelerometer on the wall,

3734
02:45:33,641 --> 02:45:35,320
everything that happened to you.
Well,

3735
02:45:35,321 --> 02:45:37,120
that's another interesting aspect of 
genetics,

3736
02:45:37,121 --> 02:45:37,954
right?
There's one thing that we absolutely 

3737
02:45:38,771 --> 02:45:42,010
knows that some people respond 
differently to doris and other people do

3738
02:45:42,340 --> 02:45:43,173
and you know,
for some person a particular type of 

3739
02:45:45,461 --> 02:45:49,230
diet is beneficial and perfect and just 
locked in and other person.

3740
02:45:49,231 --> 02:45:50,240
That'd be horrible.
Yeah,

3741
02:45:50,350 --> 02:45:51,610
absolutely.
That's weird.

3742
02:45:51,860 --> 02:45:55,420
You kNow,
across the species I find that with dogs

3743
02:45:55,421 --> 02:45:57,140
or.
But it it at an ethnic level.

3744
02:45:57,141 --> 02:45:57,974
That makes perfect sense because the 
people who have been eating different 

3745
02:45:59,471 --> 02:46:00,304
foods for a long period of time,
I have to adapt to that and of course 

3746
02:46:03,700 --> 02:46:06,310
agriculture is only 12,000
years old total,

3747
02:46:06,610 --> 02:46:08,920
although we've been eating cereals 
before that in lots of.

3748
02:46:09,500 --> 02:46:13,640
Didn't have it at all or only had it 
very recently and so it's super hard for

3749
02:46:13,641 --> 02:46:17,370
some people eat grains compared to other
people to eat grains because they're.

3750
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:18,253
They haven't adapted either diabetes 
wise or all the other kinds of things 

3751
02:46:20,601 --> 02:46:23,240
that it can cause it to go wrong.
Certainly with alcohol,

3752
02:46:23,241 --> 02:46:24,620
that's a giant fan.
Exactly.

3753
02:46:24,621 --> 02:46:25,454
And alcohol gets invented every time 
someone invents agriculture because all 

3754
02:46:27,621 --> 02:46:29,930
you do is you accidentally leave it 
there too long and it ferments.

3755
02:46:29,990 --> 02:46:30,823
Right.
And so there's an argument that we 

3756
02:46:32,751 --> 02:46:33,584
actually evolved to have a tolerance for
beer rather than a taste for it because 

3757
02:46:37,491 --> 02:46:41,030
once we're in early agricultural 
settlements for the first time ever were

3758
02:46:41,031 --> 02:46:43,250
crapping where we're drinking,
we're not moving on.

3759
02:46:43,430 --> 02:46:44,263
And so we found our own drinking water,
so beers literally safer to drink than 

3760
02:46:46,731 --> 02:46:48,350
water,
low beer and wine,

3761
02:46:48,351 --> 02:46:49,184
low grade alcohol.
And so what the data said suggest what 

3762
02:46:51,981 --> 02:46:55,610
people argue is that we evolved to 
actually have a taste for it,

3763
02:46:55,611 --> 02:46:56,444
but,
but tolerance to it rather than a 

3764
02:46:57,531 --> 02:46:58,070
distaste for.

3765
02:46:58,070 --> 02:47:01,010
Which makes sense evolutionarily.
Getting drunk with hippos running around

3766
02:47:01,150 --> 02:47:02,600
you can't be a good idea.
Also,

3767
02:47:02,601 --> 02:47:03,434
if you think about wine or,
or any booze the first time you drink 

3768
02:47:06,451 --> 02:47:07,284
it,
it's discussed.

3769
02:47:07,430 --> 02:47:09,590
Yeah,
it's hard to develop a taste for it.

3770
02:47:09,591 --> 02:47:10,730
It's exactly right.
And so,

3771
02:47:10,910 --> 02:47:12,350
and lots of things that,
that way tabasco,

3772
02:47:12,351 --> 02:47:13,184
you know,
lots of these spices have antibacterial 

3773
02:47:14,541 --> 02:47:17,450
effects so the mothers are given it to.
The kids were like,

3774
02:47:17,451 --> 02:47:18,284
on my mouth would be on fire if I want 
some six year old canadian India or 

3775
02:47:20,451 --> 02:47:23,930
something like that.
Initially why they added sabi to sushi.

3776
02:47:23,960 --> 02:47:25,880
That's what a lot of people argue.
And in fact,

3777
02:47:25,881 --> 02:47:27,860
as you work your way from the pole to 
the equator,

3778
02:47:27,861 --> 02:47:28,694
you get more and more spices because of 
course in Sweden there's six pathogens 

3779
02:47:31,370 --> 02:47:35,180
and you've got salt and pepper in the 
jungle and then africa,

3780
02:47:35,190 --> 02:47:37,130
you've got to get zillion spices,
garlic,

3781
02:47:37,131 --> 02:47:38,600
all of these things are super powerful.

3782
02:47:38,600 --> 02:47:39,680
Antibacterials,
oh,

3783
02:47:39,710 --> 02:47:42,050
that is a really interesting way of 
looking at it.

3784
02:47:42,051 --> 02:47:43,520
Yeah,
I'm sure.

3785
02:47:43,521 --> 02:47:45,020
Right.
Like Mexico,

3786
02:47:45,021 --> 02:47:47,690
very hot and spicy food.
Warm climate.

3787
02:47:48,110 --> 02:47:49,520
Totally make sense.
Yeah,

3788
02:47:49,540 --> 02:47:50,373
exactly.
And the same thing happens with the 

3789
02:47:51,830 --> 02:47:55,070
profusion of religions and languages.
The closer you get to the equator,

3790
02:47:55,071 --> 02:47:57,080
the more languages you out in the world 
religions,

3791
02:47:57,081 --> 02:47:58,700
yet because people start saying,
you know,

3792
02:47:58,701 --> 02:48:01,130
on the other side of the valley,
literally you could have a pathogen that

3793
02:48:01,131 --> 02:48:01,964
makes me sick and so I'm going to stay 
away from you and by staying away from 

3794
02:48:04,071 --> 02:48:04,904
you.
Over time we developed different 

3795
02:48:05,331 --> 02:48:06,650
languages,
different religions.

3796
02:48:06,860 --> 02:48:07,970
Again,
back to Sweden,

3797
02:48:08,150 --> 02:48:09,200
whatever you got,
I got.

3798
02:48:09,201 --> 02:48:10,470
There's three things to have,
right?

3799
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:13,340
And so you're not a risk to me and we 
share the same language.

3800
02:48:13,341 --> 02:48:14,174
We intermingle much more readily and 
there's more ethnocentrism is you go 

3801
02:48:16,521 --> 02:48:17,540
close to the equator.

3802
02:48:17,780 --> 02:48:18,613
Wow.
To keep keeping apart makes good 

3803
02:48:20,601 --> 02:48:22,700
evolutionary sense under those 
circumstances,

3804
02:48:22,820 --> 02:48:24,950
but we live in a world where no one's 
keeping apart.

3805
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:27,020
Now we live in a world where it makes it
much,

3806
02:48:27,021 --> 02:48:29,510
much more difficult and you don't 
necessarily least in our,

3807
02:48:29,830 --> 02:48:30,663
in our blessitt industrialized 
democracies where we've got good 

3808
02:48:32,091 --> 02:48:33,380
medicines,
at least for now,

3809
02:48:33,381 --> 02:48:35,390
they still work.
You don't need to anymore.

3810
02:48:35,570 --> 02:48:36,403
Right.
But we also have these crazy factory 

3811
02:48:39,921 --> 02:48:40,754
farming setups that lead to the kind of 
horrible super bugs that could kill a 

3812
02:48:45,860 --> 02:48:47,110
million people.
We did it.

3813
02:48:47,310 --> 02:48:51,140
I remember when I first found that out 
that most of the major flus,

3814
02:48:51,141 --> 02:48:52,940
like avian flu,
swine flu,

3815
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:55,250
I didn't know why they were calling it 
the swine flu.

3816
02:48:55,610 --> 02:48:56,443
And then I found that no,
it's from domesticated pigs and it's 

3817
02:48:58,630 --> 02:49:01,580
somehow more of some jumps to humans and
why.

3818
02:49:01,581 --> 02:49:03,740
And that was the cost we paid with 
agriculture.

3819
02:49:04,010 --> 02:49:05,540
so the first time we were starting to 
get.

3820
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:08,760
We're a cheek by jowl with a bunch 
animals and agriculture.

3821
02:49:08,761 --> 02:49:10,060
I mean hunter gatherers eat them.
They,

3822
02:49:10,070 --> 02:49:12,180
the animal never lives long enough to 
give you the flu.

3823
02:49:12,270 --> 02:49:13,650
Right?
Wow.

3824
02:49:13,740 --> 02:49:14,700
So everything,
you know,

3825
02:49:14,730 --> 02:49:19,260
there's always pluses and minuses when 
you change how you do things and we,

3826
02:49:19,261 --> 02:49:20,094
you and I are really lucky.
We live in a time where all these great 

3827
02:49:22,081 --> 02:49:22,914
medicines exist in,
they haven't become worthless yet and 

3828
02:49:24,751 --> 02:49:25,584
now it's really a race against the 
evolution of the bacteria and devising 

3829
02:49:29,611 --> 02:49:30,444
new medicines that can continue to 
defeat them because everything's 

3830
02:49:32,550 --> 02:49:34,320
becoming treatment resistant.
Right?

3831
02:49:34,321 --> 02:49:37,740
That's how evolution works and and 
that's just starting to happen.

3832
02:49:37,741 --> 02:49:38,574
And so now scientists have to work 
double time to keep inventing new drugs 

3833
02:49:41,341 --> 02:49:42,174
to stay ahead of the game with the 
exception of some things that just for 

3834
02:49:44,611 --> 02:49:46,860
whatever reason,
bacteria don't seem to be able to evolve

3835
02:49:46,861 --> 02:49:47,880
resistance to them.

3836
02:49:48,240 --> 02:49:49,073
Well,
what's fascinating to me is not just 

3837
02:49:50,341 --> 02:49:51,174
scientists creating these vaccines and 
all these different medicines to deal 

3838
02:49:53,731 --> 02:49:54,564
with these diseases,
but the potential of shutting off genes 

3839
02:49:58,270 --> 02:49:59,103
that potential of altering the human 
genome and using things like whatever 

3840
02:50:02,671 --> 02:50:06,000
the future version of crispr is going to
be to.

3841
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:10,080
I mean they've already figured out a way
to stop certain diseases.

3842
02:50:10,110 --> 02:50:10,943
So those single gene things are great.
Remember with everything being so 

3843
02:50:14,191 --> 02:50:15,024
apologetic,
you don't just want to shut shit down 

3844
02:50:16,201 --> 02:50:18,680
willy nilly and so then really what 
you're at,

3845
02:50:18,690 --> 02:50:20,640
the advantages,
the point you made earlier.

3846
02:50:20,641 --> 02:50:21,474
So my diet should be 60 percent protein 
in your should be 15 percent or mindset 

3847
02:50:25,961 --> 02:50:27,840
or more leafy vegetables in euros,
whatever,

3848
02:50:27,930 --> 02:50:28,763
and we'll be able to know that we'll 
know how my guts going to respond to it 

3849
02:50:31,141 --> 02:50:31,974
and how you're gonna respond to it.
Well that's one of the things that 23 

3850
02:50:34,021 --> 02:50:35,160
and me actually does.

3851
02:50:35,160 --> 02:50:35,993
They do.
They do show like what foods you'd be 

3852
02:50:37,861 --> 02:50:38,694
more likely to be allergic to and what 
things would be most likely to be 

3853
02:50:42,121 --> 02:50:42,954
attracted and that's a great start.
But what we really need is apologetic 

3854
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:47,520
scores that tell you how do you process 
leafy vegetables,

3855
02:50:47,521 --> 02:50:49,860
how do you process fats,
how do you process all that stuff?

3856
02:50:50,520 --> 02:50:54,030
And so because you knowj,
genes account for most of our weight,

3857
02:50:54,031 --> 02:50:56,700
that's most of the variance in our 
weather or obese or not,

3858
02:50:56,880 --> 02:51:00,610
but nobody was obese when you and our 
kids have.

3859
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:01,703
Tons of people are obese now.
So what those genes really are is genes 

3860
02:51:03,991 --> 02:51:06,620
to sensitivity to something changing in 
our environment.

3861
02:51:06,621 --> 02:51:07,454
Either activity levels of the foods 
we're eating or how process they are or 

3862
02:51:09,751 --> 02:51:12,000
how much carbs,
whatever we don't know.

3863
02:51:12,180 --> 02:51:13,013
But that's what we're actually 
genetically sensitive to it because all 

3864
02:51:15,301 --> 02:51:16,890
of us have the same underlying problem.

3865
02:51:16,890 --> 02:51:17,723
That evolution didn't really worry about
obesity because the problem was the 

3866
02:51:19,981 --> 02:51:23,580
opposite starving and so we were not 
really good at telling when we're full.

3867
02:51:23,850 --> 02:51:26,670
ANd there's interesting evidence that 
suggests some really lovely studies that

3868
02:51:26,671 --> 02:51:30,000
show that really one of the key guides 
of appetite was variety.

3869
02:51:30,480 --> 02:51:32,310
When you eat a lot less variety,
you're.

3870
02:51:32,311 --> 02:51:35,190
That's when your stomach tells you 
you're full really much more reliably.

3871
02:51:35,400 --> 02:51:36,233
But as you add variety to your diet,
which everybody on earth can do now 

3872
02:51:38,220 --> 02:51:39,053
while everybody's got any money on earth
can do now that actually you short 

3873
02:51:41,911 --> 02:51:44,460
circuit the best mechanism we had to 
tell us to stop eating.

3874
02:51:44,940 --> 02:51:45,870
Yeah,
that's interesting.

3875
02:51:45,871 --> 02:51:50,590
And now as an argument that people who 
are experts on nutrition are,

3876
02:51:50,591 --> 02:51:54,960
are making about one of the more recent 
diet plans that people are using.

3877
02:51:55,140 --> 02:51:55,973
The carnivore diet is that just eating 
only meat and there's a lot of people 

3878
02:52:00,661 --> 02:52:01,494
that are doing that and they're finding 
that they're having all these like 

3879
02:52:04,350 --> 02:52:06,340
really rapid decreases

3880
02:52:06,340 --> 02:52:07,173
in autoimmune diseases and rapid 
recoveries from eczema and siberia and 

3881
02:52:13,370 --> 02:52:18,070
I'll psoriasis and the people that are.
A lot of people are saying,

3882
02:52:18,100 --> 02:52:18,851
oh,
it's the meat.

3883
02:52:18,851 --> 02:52:19,684
Meat's great for me.
It's great for her and some nutrition 

3884
02:52:22,121 --> 02:52:27,121
experts saying more likely this is a 
calorie like you're,

3885
02:52:28,010 --> 02:52:28,843
you're at a calorie deficit and by 
putting your body into a calorie 

3886
02:52:31,721 --> 02:52:32,880
deficit,
you're almost like in a,

3887
02:52:32,881 --> 02:52:33,714
in a state of fasting and you're 
decreasing your body weight because 

3888
02:52:36,041 --> 02:52:36,874
almost universally all these people that
are that are talking about the positive 

3889
02:52:40,031 --> 02:52:42,550
benefits of these diets,
these elimination diets,

3890
02:52:42,551 --> 02:52:43,384
and just eating one thing.
One of the things that they're showing 

3891
02:52:45,041 --> 02:52:45,340
us,
they.

3892
02:52:45,340 --> 02:52:46,420
They lose a shitload of weight.

3893
02:52:46,530 --> 02:52:47,363
Right?
And so the thing is that I suspect 

3894
02:52:48,181 --> 02:52:49,650
you're right,
that either they're cutting out what for

3895
02:52:49,651 --> 02:52:52,200
them is the perpetrator and who would 
ever know out of the 4,000

3896
02:52:52,201 --> 02:52:53,034
things,
right?

3897
02:52:53,250 --> 02:52:54,083
Or it's literally the losing weight and 
then hopefully they're taking 

3898
02:52:56,641 --> 02:52:58,920
multivitamins to make it for all the 
stuff that they're not getting.

3899
02:52:58,921 --> 02:52:59,391
Right.
Yeah.

3900
02:52:59,391 --> 02:53:00,360
I don't think they are.

3901
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:03,760
A lot of them are not doing that.
It's really interesting.

3902
02:53:04,150 --> 02:53:04,983
I've been following it pretty closely 
and I've had quite a few people on the 

3903
02:53:06,821 --> 02:53:09,580
podcast,
including really intelligent guys.

3904
02:53:09,581 --> 02:53:11,470
Like Jordan Peterson is on this.

3905
02:53:11,660 --> 02:53:13,060
Oh,
he does he and salt.

3906
02:53:13,070 --> 02:53:14,330
Right.
And for me that wouldn't work.

3907
02:53:14,331 --> 02:53:15,120
Although I am,
I,

3908
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:19,400
I meet in fruit basically and then very 
little else about grief.

3909
02:53:19,401 --> 02:53:21,960
You leafy green vegetables.
I know I should but I don't like.

3910
02:53:21,990 --> 02:53:25,820
Um,
so I know I don't like broccoli.

3911
02:53:26,690 --> 02:53:27,880
Broccoli's edible.
Oh,

3912
02:53:28,040 --> 02:53:29,370
I know I should.
So I,

3913
02:53:29,420 --> 02:53:31,220
my,
my wife makes them and I'll eat a little

3914
02:53:31,221 --> 02:53:32,420
bit of it.
But like a little kid.

3915
02:53:32,550 --> 02:53:33,270
I know,
I know,

3916
02:53:33,270 --> 02:53:35,860
but in my way it's like these arguments 
I have with my eight year old.

3917
02:53:35,861 --> 02:53:36,694
no,
I know.

3918
02:53:37,010 --> 02:53:38,630
And your year olds right now,
by the way,

3919
02:53:38,631 --> 02:53:42,100
it turns out there are genes that make 
people find broccoli more disgusting and

3920
02:53:42,140 --> 02:53:42,973
more at more bitter versus less bitter.
Some people really have their tongue 

3921
02:53:46,041 --> 02:53:47,600
says no,
broccoli is called the beat,

3922
02:53:47,601 --> 02:53:48,434
a little baby gene,
but the one thing I would say there's 

3923
02:53:51,051 --> 02:53:51,884
this really lovely study done with that 
nice mix and what they did is they fed 

3924
02:53:54,441 --> 02:53:58,470
people a couple of different foods and 
you try a few and then you eat one until

3925
02:53:58,490 --> 02:54:00,980
you're full and then when you come back 
to.

3926
02:54:00,980 --> 02:54:03,250
I don't know if you know this work,
like paul rosin started with amnesiacs.

3927
02:54:03,280 --> 02:54:03,860
If you.
If I,

3928
02:54:03,860 --> 02:54:06,350
if you're densely in music,
so I talked to you.

3929
02:54:06,351 --> 02:54:07,670
I leave the room,
I come back five minutes later.

3930
02:54:07,671 --> 02:54:09,620
You don't know who I am because you've 
got brain damage.

3931
02:54:09,980 --> 02:54:13,070
When I come back with lunch,
literally you'll eat a second lunch.

3932
02:54:13,130 --> 02:54:15,050
We have such poor mechanism that tells 
us we're full.

3933
02:54:15,051 --> 02:54:16,380
We think we do.
We feel good.

3934
02:54:16,550 --> 02:54:17,900
I've had a great dinner.
I'm really full,

3935
02:54:18,050 --> 02:54:18,883
but we don't realize is that's really 
driven a lot by the knowledge that we 

3936
02:54:20,901 --> 02:54:21,734
just ate and so what rosin found when he
went back into he had eat lunch to your 

3937
02:54:25,281 --> 02:54:26,114
fault.
He goes back and says it's time for 

3938
02:54:27,051 --> 02:54:28,760
lunch,
and literally they all eat it again,

3939
02:54:29,330 --> 02:54:32,330
and so what's what's amazing about these
studies is then this follow up study,

3940
02:54:32,331 --> 02:54:35,720
what they did is they served amnesic or 
control food people,

3941
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,360
foods that they sampled and food that 
they till their full.

3942
02:54:39,110 --> 02:54:39,943
So you sample potato chips and then you 
eat a tuna sandwich and now I come back 

3943
02:54:42,981 --> 02:54:45,350
to you and say if you're a normal,
and I say,

3944
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:47,960
do you want to eat a potato chip?
Do you want a tuna sandwich?

3945
02:54:47,961 --> 02:54:49,100
If you're normally say,
well,

3946
02:54:49,101 --> 02:54:49,934
I just had lunch.
I'm not really that keen deed either of 

3947
02:54:50,841 --> 02:54:52,430
them anymore.
If you're uneasy,

3948
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:54,440
you say,
I don't want a tuna sandwich,

3949
02:54:54,441 --> 02:54:55,274
but yeah,
I'll have some potato chips and so you 

3950
02:54:57,201 --> 02:54:58,034
don't even need to know you ate it.
And so your hunger mechanism is still 

3951
02:55:00,771 --> 02:55:02,450
there,
but the fact is you've had a lot of tuna

3952
02:55:02,451 --> 02:55:04,580
sandwich and that's controlling your 
appetite.

3953
02:55:04,581 --> 02:55:06,740
It's making you feel like you don't want
to eat it anymore.

3954
02:55:07,130 --> 02:55:08,840
And so in the same sense,
you go to a steakhouse,

3955
02:55:09,110 --> 02:55:09,750
you think,
boy,

3956
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:10,790
I love this.
My favorite steak.

3957
02:55:10,791 --> 02:55:13,160
I could eat it forever and then you 
finish it or not,

3958
02:55:13,430 --> 02:55:14,241
and then you think,
oh,

3959
02:55:14,241 --> 02:55:15,750
I'm stuffed and somebody goes desert.

3960
02:55:16,430 --> 02:55:16,911
Actually,
yeah,

3961
02:55:16,911 --> 02:55:17,760
that does sound good,
right?

3962
02:55:18,230 --> 02:55:20,690
Because now you're shifting and you're 
eating something else,

3963
02:55:21,070 --> 02:55:21,903
and so I suspect that what guided our 
ancestors was the fact they had no 

3964
02:55:24,501 --> 02:55:26,690
variety.
What's for dinner was not a question you

3965
02:55:26,691 --> 02:55:28,220
ever asked.
Whatever dad killed him,

3966
02:55:28,230 --> 02:55:30,200
whatever mum dug up like there's two 
things there.

3967
02:55:30,201 --> 02:55:31,034
Right,
and so you're going to gorge on the 

3968
02:55:31,860 --> 02:55:32,693
meat.
There's not a vegetarian hunter gather 

3969
02:55:33,801 --> 02:55:35,240
on the planet.
You when you,

3970
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:37,790
when you're hungry everyday.
Everybody loves me.

3971
02:55:37,910 --> 02:55:39,590
It's not only whatever.
You can every loves it.

3972
02:55:39,591 --> 02:55:42,410
Every in every hunter gatherer society 
meet is a big deal.

3973
02:55:42,411 --> 02:55:44,690
Someone comes home with a big kill.
It's a big deal.

3974
02:55:45,230 --> 02:55:46,063
When you can afford to be very well fed,
suddenly you can start to think 

3975
02:55:47,901 --> 02:55:49,910
differently and even have different 
preferences,

3976
02:55:49,911 --> 02:55:50,744
but you don't if you're a hunter 
gatherer and so literally if they had 

3977
02:55:53,301 --> 02:55:55,460
killed a giraffe,
you're just stuffing as much.

3978
02:55:55,460 --> 02:55:58,490
Draft me down the pipe as you can and it
makes sense for you to then evolve.

3979
02:55:58,491 --> 02:55:59,324
Okay.
You're going to get nothing new out of 

3980
02:56:00,261 --> 02:56:01,650
the giraffe you eat other than you're 
going gonna.

3981
02:56:01,651 --> 02:56:04,550
Pull it out the back end.
It's time to shut this dinner down.

3982
02:56:04,551 --> 02:56:05,790
Right?
But if you told me,

3983
02:56:05,791 --> 02:56:06,624
oh look,
we've got this other thing that's 

3984
02:56:08,361 --> 02:56:08,721
helpful.
Well,

3985
02:56:08,721 --> 02:56:10,490
there's nutrients in that I don't 
already have.

3986
02:56:10,491 --> 02:56:12,140
And so you could imagine getting hungry 
again.

3987
02:56:12,141 --> 02:56:13,790
That's what they did to suggest.
Well,

3988
02:56:13,791 --> 02:56:14,624
it's interesting because that's kind of 
the argument that these carnivore diet 

3989
02:56:16,761 --> 02:56:17,594
people use is that that is the most 
beneficial food because that's the food 

3990
02:56:21,141 --> 02:56:23,770
that you look forward to the most,
the right,

3991
02:56:23,810 --> 02:56:26,420
but don't forget you only need to do 
this within every meal.

3992
02:56:26,750 --> 02:56:27,583
So if you sit down for your favorite 
lobster dinner just to have lobster and 

3993
02:56:30,111 --> 02:56:32,450
then that doesn't mean emptied it for 
lunch or for breakfast tomorrow.

3994
02:56:32,451 --> 02:56:34,670
Now you can have pancakes.
Whatever it is.

3995
02:56:34,850 --> 02:56:35,683
The key is within every meal,
minimize your variety because that's 

3996
02:56:38,601 --> 02:56:41,360
where the effect is having itself.
It doesn't have to carry over time.

3997
02:56:41,361 --> 02:56:43,310
It doesn't mean you lobster every single
meal.

3998
02:56:43,370 --> 02:56:45,920
You know it's interesting.
That's actually the gracie diet.

3999
02:56:46,230 --> 02:56:47,063
There's jujitsu family called the grace,
started the ufc and world famous 

4000
02:56:52,171 --> 02:56:54,480
brazilian jiu jitsu family,
but just a family,

4001
02:56:54,481 --> 02:56:55,314
philip killers and one of the founders,
I believe it was carlos gracie invented 

4002
02:56:59,911 --> 02:57:00,744
this.
He invented a diet that was basically 

4003
02:57:03,391 --> 02:57:06,180
you shouldn't mix foods together.
if you're eating fruits,

4004
02:57:06,181 --> 02:57:08,210
you should eat fruits by themselves.
You meet,

4005
02:57:08,230 --> 02:57:09,063
you eat that by itself,
and that in combining all these things 

4006
02:57:11,851 --> 02:57:12,684
together,
your body produces a variety of 

4007
02:57:13,861 --> 02:57:14,694
different enzymes.
You don't get as much nutritional 

4008
02:57:15,811 --> 02:57:16,470
absorption.

4009
02:57:16,470 --> 02:57:18,030
Now that may be.
I have no idea.

4010
02:57:18,031 --> 02:57:18,864
I don't know.
I don't understand the underlying bio 

4011
02:57:20,921 --> 02:57:21,950
science,
but what I do know,

4012
02:57:21,980 --> 02:57:26,670
the psychology suggests that you'll stop
eating sooner if within any one meal you

4013
02:57:26,671 --> 02:57:27,504
have less variety,
so the psychological level we've we 

4014
02:57:29,101 --> 02:57:32,790
appear to have evolved to not want that 
anymore.

4015
02:57:32,791 --> 02:57:36,660
When we've had enough of that be it a 
taro root or mom dug up or a giraffe are

4016
02:57:36,661 --> 02:57:37,494
dad shot,
so these sort of evolutionary traits 

4017
02:57:41,130 --> 02:57:41,560
that are

4018
02:57:41,560 --> 02:57:43,810
inside of our bodies,
they would.

4019
02:57:43,990 --> 02:57:44,823
They would sort of encourage us to eat 
much more if we have a variety of 

4020
02:57:49,091 --> 02:57:51,130
different foods.
If you're eating at a buffet in vegas,

4021
02:57:51,260 --> 02:57:54,360
yeah,
versus if you just eating chicken,

4022
02:57:54,470 --> 02:57:57,300
that chicken,
you'll eat as much chicken as really you

4023
02:57:57,301 --> 02:58:00,330
need and then you'll stay.
I don't want any more chicken,

4024
02:58:00,350 --> 02:58:02,160
but if there's chicken mashed potatoes 
and corn

4025
02:58:02,160 --> 02:58:02,993
on the cob and then cole slaw and our 
ancestors never faced that prompts the 

4026
02:58:06,131 --> 02:58:06,964
date.
We don't know how to deal with it and 

4027
02:58:08,311 --> 02:58:10,350
the other side of that coin.
So what steve simpson did,

4028
02:58:10,351 --> 02:58:12,530
this guy who did the early study on 
protein and locus,

4029
02:58:12,610 --> 02:58:13,443
he,
he took his biology students on field 

4030
02:58:15,511 --> 02:58:16,344
trips and he would talk to the food to 
increase the protein in the food or 

4031
02:58:18,931 --> 02:58:19,764
decrease it in the food,
but it's the exact same foods like to 

4032
02:58:21,280 --> 02:58:23,700
read in the same roles in the same 
sushi,

4033
02:58:23,880 --> 02:58:24,713
but he's increasing levels of protein in
those foods and then it's a buffet and 

4034
02:58:28,621 --> 02:58:29,454
all he does is weigh the food when it 
starts and when it finishes across all 

4035
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:34,470
the students eating it and he found that
as the protein levels go up,

4036
02:58:34,650 --> 02:58:37,050
the amount of food that people eat at 
the buffet goes down.

4037
02:58:37,470 --> 02:58:39,150
So there's these two parallel 
mechanisms,

4038
02:58:39,151 --> 02:58:43,200
one were made of protein and so that 
seems carbs do drive appetite,

4039
02:58:43,201 --> 02:58:45,330
but not nearly as strongly as proteins 
do.

4040
02:58:45,590 --> 02:58:46,423
So you,
the tolerance and how much courage to 

4041
02:58:47,641 --> 02:58:49,020
lead is huge.
The tolerance,

4042
02:58:49,021 --> 02:58:49,854
how much protein.
Juliet is very narrow and he finds out 

4043
02:58:51,960 --> 02:58:52,793
of course,
when he finds that in crickets and now 

4044
02:58:53,581 --> 02:58:54,414
he finds it in humans.
And then I think the other side of that 

4045
02:58:56,341 --> 02:58:57,330
coin is,
is variety.

4046
02:58:57,331 --> 02:59:00,390
And the bad luck for us right now is we 
live in a world where,

4047
02:59:00,630 --> 02:59:03,210
especially if you're poor,
proteins are expensive and hard to get.

4048
02:59:03,211 --> 02:59:04,044
So you're going to have these high carb 
diets and then everybody can have 

4049
02:59:06,061 --> 02:59:10,560
variety and variety is probably a really
bad thing that is so fascinating is that

4050
02:59:10,561 --> 02:59:13,980
are our good fortune is our demise.
Exactly.

4051
02:59:14,120 --> 02:59:15,330
And in so many ways,
I mean,

4052
02:59:15,530 --> 02:59:17,010
you know,
we evolved to seek out fat,

4053
02:59:17,011 --> 02:59:19,310
sugar and salt because they were in 
short supply another every.

4054
02:59:19,440 --> 02:59:21,330
Now you,
if you eat them every time you see them,

4055
02:59:21,331 --> 02:59:22,290
you're stuffed.
Right?

4056
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:23,640
They're everywhere,
man.

4057
02:59:23,670 --> 02:59:26,190
I mean everything you eat as fat,
sugar and salt.

4058
02:59:26,191 --> 02:59:27,210
Exactly.
And then the other,

4059
02:59:27,420 --> 02:59:29,580
it's not just what you eat.
We also evolved.

4060
02:59:29,581 --> 02:59:32,590
So if there's a novel per person in the 
opposite sex,

4061
02:59:32,591 --> 02:59:33,590
it comes along.
Boy,

4062
02:59:33,591 --> 02:59:35,280
what a rare event that was.
Maybe fat.

4063
02:59:35,281 --> 02:59:36,260
sugar.
Exactly.

4064
02:59:36,270 --> 02:59:37,800
You should jump on that train,
right?

4065
02:59:37,980 --> 02:59:39,780
Because that'll give you a new genetic 
opportunities,

4066
02:59:39,781 --> 02:59:41,970
but you look out the door,
there's novelty everywhere.

4067
02:59:41,971 --> 02:59:42,804
it's super hard.
It's hard to stay married in the city 

4068
02:59:44,161 --> 02:59:44,994
than it is in the country.
It's hard to stay married if you're a 

4069
02:59:46,411 --> 02:59:47,244
celebrity than if you're a nobody.
Because those people are just dev 

4070
02:59:49,560 --> 02:59:52,260
novelty constantly.
They have variety constantly.

4071
02:59:52,530 --> 02:59:54,120
And the rest of us,
well you know,

4072
02:59:54,180 --> 02:59:56,250
there may be variety out there,
but they're not interested in me.

4073
02:59:56,251 --> 02:59:57,560
So it's kind of irrelevant.
Anyway.

4074
02:59:57,570 --> 03:00:00,030
All right bill,
thank you so much.

4075
03:00:00,790 --> 03:00:03,690
I can't wait to read your book.
Excellent approach for everybody.

4076
03:00:04,140 --> 03:00:09,140
It's available right now.
Go get it.

4077
03:00:09,381 --> 03:00:10,940
You.
Fox is awesome.

4078
03:00:10,941 --> 03:00:11,950
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

4079
03:00:11,960 --> 03:00:12,920
Really fun.
A lot of fun.

4080
03:00:12,950 --> 03:00:14,420
Thank you.
Bye everybody.

4081
03:00:23,100 --> 03:00:23,933
That's amazing.
