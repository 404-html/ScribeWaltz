1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,750
You know I think about that last year I 
did blow.

3
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,080
I was ready to call 60 minutes.
Okay.

4
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:09,914
Think of this state of mind right now,
like I had already a pitch for 60 

5
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:16,070
minutes to explain to them that I had 
found the cure for cocaine.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,020
If you do heroin on Mondays just a 
little bit,

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:21,854
you will not snort the rest of the week.
Like I was really going to pit 60 

8
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,114
minutes.
I was going to get an agent and go to 

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,750
CBS and the list.
I got a groundbreaking idea.

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,063
There's no reason for rehabs.
We'll get that white powder you 

11
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:34,210
motherfuckers are going to war for

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,753
and we'll get that little white poppy 
seed will make it into some pill and 

13
00:00:39,371 --> 00:00:40,204
we'll get people high on Monday because 
the rest of the week I didn't want to 

14
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,240
get high.
How crazy is that?

15
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,940
I was doing heroin on a Monday and it 
wouldn't let me do the rest of the week.

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,630
I look forward to Mondays.
Fox,

17
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,080
CSI Miami.
Why only Monday?

18
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,840
I Dunno,
I dunno,

19
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,390
I have no fucking idea.
That was just a week off,

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,490
right?
That was just snorting it.

21
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,640
Yeah.
Snort at two little lines of heroin just

22
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,080
to get me out.
And what does it do?

23
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:06,540
Like what's the feeling?
Hit.

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,620
Tell me what it feels like when it hits 
you.

25
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,280
Oh,
it takes a couple minutes to hit and you

26
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:13,114
feel this weird thing and then you feel 
like your blood pressure going up and 

27
00:01:16,301 --> 00:01:21,040
you feel like this euphoric warmth.
You feel like this fucking to.

28
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,160
I felt like my body.
Did you ever take a white shit?

29
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,850
It's warmer.
You can see if you shit outside.

30
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:28,684
Steve's gonna come out of it.
That's what your body feels like that 

31
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:33,580
one and then I would get an urge to puke

32
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:37,440
for a couple minutes.
I would gag and Puke a little bit,

33
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,990
would come out of yellow and then after 
I put a little bit,

34
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:44,991
I would just go into this state of 
fucking bonus for four hours.

35
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:48,310
It was like smoking in their cars all 
day and mum onus,

36
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:50,730
like just sitting there smoking a 
cigarette,

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,683
looking out a window,
and I'd make believe I was writing John 

38
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,310
Lennon type lyrics to until I looked at 
them the next day.

39
00:01:59,311 --> 00:02:00,144
This brilliance about a refrigerator.
Like I remember writing a bit about a 

40
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:06,060
refrigerator once and looking at it the 
next day and say,

41
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:08,890
thank God,
thank God I never tried.

42
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,680
You know what I'm saying?
Like little things like just,

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,580
well that was hedbergs drug of choice 
and his jokes,

44
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,943
man,

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,553
it's,
I think he's probably the best 

46
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,710
nonsequitor joke I ever because all his 
jokes are unrelated.

47
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,843
It's like here's a nonsequitor.
Here's some other things I was thinking 

48
00:02:28,041 --> 00:02:30,440
about.
Here's something I thought his,

49
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,540
um,
I saw and it was like,

50
00:02:32,541 --> 00:02:33,980
I was listening to it the other day is 
like,

51
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,180
half of his jokes were only funny 
because he was saying them,

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:41,510
you know,
but they were hilarious.

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,563
Like he had a,
he had a way of doing it that was Kinda 

54
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,300
like heroin comedy,
you know?

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,110
Would they be messed up during the week 
or no?

56
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,500
Who?
Uh,

57
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,980
it takes me a day to recover on Tuesdays
I'd be out.

58
00:02:56,981 --> 00:02:57,814
I didn't say nothing to nobody.
I was doing the and I wasn't doing cold 

59
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,610
showers.
Really Fun.

60
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,950
So you would be like sober Thursday,
Friday,

61
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,784
Saturday,
and then he'd look forward to the big 

62
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,650
bump on Monday?
Yeah.

63
00:03:09,651 --> 00:03:13,270
The kids that used to send it to me,
he used to send me $7 bags.

64
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,370
What kid?
His name was a bonehead.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,920
He died from an old date.
How weird.

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,330
Yeah.
Fairy that counts to live forever.

67
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,650
I knew I knew bonehead from my 
restaurant piece.

68
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,390
Last phone had Bergman taste about bone 
health.

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,880
Bone health was like your boy.
He was.

70
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,163
I could go into a room with 90 
motherfuckers in bone that will 

71
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,570
liquidate of them.
Bonehead was a bad motherfucker dog.

72
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,370
I love bump on her three brothers.

73
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,540
I love Dalton,
but bone that was in two of the brothers

74
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,560
were very successful and bleeding bone 
head was successful as a plumber.

75
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,560
He had his own company.
He only went crazy at night bone.

76
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:51,394
That bone head when I was 17,
would take me to mcsorley's hell house 

77
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,881
in New York City Id.
He called the bartender.

78
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:01,480
I'm going to give them three mugs of 
beer,

79
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,820
given three mugs or beer and give him a 
bowl of Chili.

80
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,500
Mug would take 10 bucks for the both of 
us and he'd go to Washington Square Park

81
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,783
and he come back and he gave me eight 
volumes and by the meantime he would go 

82
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:17,290
by his heroin and they buy these mixture
of pills and they melt them to the black

83
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,124
and whites.
They take us to a strip club in New 

84
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:24,220
Jersey or something and they take us 
home and the next day,

85
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,113
seven in the morning,
that strip had this bone head in the 

86
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,024
fucking in the fucking a plumbing van up
and Dan that he was a functioning 

87
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:34,540
addict.
He wasn't like your regular.

88
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,570
There's a lot of those guys out there 
and he had a check that was a 13 bailey.

89
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,430
She was half Asian,
half Irish,

90
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,353
and they used to do heroin together and 
they'd pass out in the living room late 

91
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,010
fucking.
They both go to sleep and then I'd be in

92
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,940
the bedroom because I just moved in with
bonus.

93
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,153
They were Italian.
They were real fucking the talents and 

94
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,643
the mother used to.
The mother was the first person ever 

95
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,104
made me an eight grade.
She was a little Irish chicken and she 

96
00:05:07,151 --> 00:05:07,984
said that she used to say the word Earl.
She couldn't say oil and she was the 

97
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,740
bookkeeper for union 52,
whatever.

98
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:16,460
The teamsters,
the Labor unit.

99
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,650
I was over there one day when I was 16.
She goes,

100
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:22,590
you've got a book,
walk me to work tomorrow.

101
00:05:22,591 --> 00:05:24,850
Get your book.
You can start fucking being it.

102
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,250
So I,
you know,

103
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,060
like a hod carrier,
like hod carrier for the brick masons.

104
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,553
She goes,
I can get you with the Italians or by 

105
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:35,080
the brick mason.
She was from hoboken,

106
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,840
so she got me a book.
I financed that.

107
00:05:37,841 --> 00:05:40,870
She got a loan shark to finance it.
I love these people.

108
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,870
This is,
if I'm thinking it might be,

109
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,803
I don't like doing documentaries,
but I need to do a documentary about 

110
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:50,120
this family because it's the rise and 
fall of American family.

111
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,973
I saw before my eyes as a child that 
went over there and ate with them and 

112
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,143
hanging out with all three brothers by 
the like I wasn't just friends or 

113
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,173
bonehead with Chrissy fish and I hung 
out with the little whatever his name 

114
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:06,140
was,
but bone hood was my nighttime guy.

115
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,560
Bonehead used to take me into the murky 
waters of the underworld.

116
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,970
He can get me guns and shit.
Another medium brother was a drug dealer

117
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,883
in the eighties and he drugged he so big
times coke and he used to buy jewelry 

118
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:19,724
and he used to put them in a tackle box.
So one night me and the younger brother 

119
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:23,894
in the bed,
sleep and bone had comes in the borrow 

120
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:28,010
money from us because he was going to 
the city again,

121
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,880
heroin.
And he goes,

122
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,620
he and I got it.
I got to go to the back.

123
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,453
I don't have any money on me.
He went into his brother's room and 

124
00:06:33,711 --> 00:06:36,020
instead of his brother was sleeping,
the drug dealer,

125
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,560
instead of just opening up the tackle 
box and taken $40 out,

126
00:06:39,561 --> 00:06:43,430
he took the whole tackle box and it had 
$40,000

127
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,520
cash and was 30 and jewelry.
He went to the Bronx.

128
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,823
These are the best times in my life by 
comrade is your war stories and you saw 

129
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:57,320
that house was haunted and this was not 
a hunter,

130
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,640
so the house at all these people were 
decent Italian people.

131
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,533
Dad was a longshoreman and the mom was 
in charge of the teamsters union and 

132
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,680
they hung out with westies.
They hung out with the fucking.

133
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,533
The mother was friends with this dude 
that was a a whatever for the West East 

134
00:07:11,101 --> 00:07:13,740
and he used to get me jobs.
He would get me jobs,

135
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,820
casing joints.
When you have a summer job now,

136
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,880
he would tell me,
come in,

137
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,570
I want you to go that warehouse.

138
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm going to give you $200.
They're going to give you one 80.

139
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,243
I want you to go in that warehouse and 
write down all the alarms and tell me 

140
00:07:26,161 --> 00:07:26,994
where the safe is.
Walks around the safe and he would pay 

141
00:07:28,561 --> 00:07:30,550
me money.
This was a great house.

142
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,250
Stop old school Italian announcement 
back the bonehead bone.

143
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,153
It has the fishing tackle box.
He's about to go upstairs to buy heroin 

144
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,424
and shoot it.
He puts the tackle box and the garbage 

145
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,930
can in front of the building and puts a 
lid on it.

146
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,123
When he's upstairs shooting heroin,
the garbage bin come and they take the 

147
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:52,401
40 large with the $30,000
fucking jewelry to understand me.

148
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:57,420
I mean this was nonstop.
Le Bonheur came home high on heroin.

149
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,610
He decided to make French fries,
so he put the pot out,

150
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,463
but that this.
Remember in the eighties they had those 

151
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:04,320
pots.

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,153
You could bring it home with the hot oil
and they would boil and you could throw 

153
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,200
French fries.
America went crazy over him.

154
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:12,060
I forgot what they were praised 
everybody.

155
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,700
Everybody was making onion rings and 
shit.

156
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,110
Well,
he did heroin and knotted up and left.

157
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:19,300
That thing went on fire.
Of course,

158
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,510
we're all on the fucking house.
Oh Jesus.

159
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,920
All right.
I went into oil.

160
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:27,600
I wake up,
boom and alarms and awesome coach waking

161
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:30,080
me up and we'll go out of the house and 
the is outside.

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,390
The grandmother and the fire department 
crawls on top of the roof.

163
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:34,224
Joe,
when they hit the fucking roof to let 

164
00:08:35,611 --> 00:08:36,444
the smoke out and fire trucks are coming
from the side land water and they got 

165
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:42,990
the sirens in the middle of all this had
taken them on and we all look around and

166
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:43,824
go,
oh my God,

167
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,700
Emile stonehouse,
bonehead was still in the house on fire,

168
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,800
Bro.
They turn the fire off.

169
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:54,780
They go in and he's still with his feet 
up with his.

170
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,020
Just heroin out of his mind.

171
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,070
He slept through the fire.
Oh my God.

172
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:04,730
Everything.
When they woke up on my fries,

173
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:08,970
ready?
Crazy.

174
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:13,971
This family was ready.
We have to fucking battalions after nine

175
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:21,030
slash 11 hours.
Are you still fucking sleeping?

176
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,550
Oh my God.
It burned the house down.

177
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,100
Burn the fucking kitchen down and half 
the bedroom.

178
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:26,934
They had a movie for a hotel for six 
months and they had a grandmother 

179
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,780
downstairs.
It was old school Italian,

180
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:32,670
but you couldn't smell,
so we kinda,

181
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,513
we smoked pot.
We just got on there and blow smoke in 

182
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,544
his face and grandma would pass out in 
the wheelchair and that was the end 

183
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,420
that.
I mean it didn't stop.

184
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,160
It didn't stop genius.
So this is why you get mad at people for

185
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:47,340
binge watching stuff on Netflix and this
is what you were talking about.

186
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,650
I get mad at everything are you got to 
bother me for.

187
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:53,100
I get mad when people like he used to 
hide the coat.

188
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,963
The medium brother.
He used to hide the coke on his car and 

189
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:57,174
I'd be walking down the hill and I could
see a little container that he didn't 

190
00:09:58,981 --> 00:09:59,814
even have a Maserati.
What's the other Italian call is how 

191
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,000
much of a guineas?
These motherfuckers.

192
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,843
What?
What's the other Italian car like you 

193
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,470
said?
The avanti Avanti.

194
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:11,041
Oh,
okay.

195
00:10:11,041 --> 00:10:13,080
I remember those.
Remember that piece of Shit?

196
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,270
That was a piece of shit.
Pieces of shit.

197
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,630
Can you show me a piece of carbon trust?
Anything Italian?

198
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,760
Oh my God.
That was the.

199
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,930
He tried to sell it to me once.
It was through grants.

200
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:26,250
Yeah.
I drove it down the corner blows up.
