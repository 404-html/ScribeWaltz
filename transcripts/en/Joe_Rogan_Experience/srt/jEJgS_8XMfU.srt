1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,393
J London.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,101
Oh,

4
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:06,480
Jay Jay London,

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,620
J London man.

6
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,550
He's a funny dude,

7
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:08,910
man.

8
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,780
Jay's funny man.

9
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,541
But he's a boy.

10
00:00:10,541 --> 00:00:12,000
You talking about a guy who's a mess.

11
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,181
Oh,

12
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,014
he's crazy.

13
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:13,491
We ain't.

14
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:16,080
London was selling American
flags after nine slash 11.

15
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,250
That's what he's doing for a living.

16
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,250
And uh,

17
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,260
I worked with them.

18
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,880
The first Gig I ever did
on television in 1992,

19
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,770
I want to say two or three.

20
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,240
I did standup spotlight in
New York and it was with me,

21
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,630
me and Jay London and a couple other
people and Jay and I were friends,

22
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:33,840
you know,

23
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,020
from the New York comedy scene
and then he just kinda like,

24
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,050
faded away and then he came to La and in
2001 he was like basically like almost

25
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,320
homeless.

26
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:43,710
Yeah.

27
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:43,951
Yeah.

28
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:45,130
Before you did less calm.

29
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,100
Like he was the only guy who stood in
line on last comic and made it to the

30
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:51,240
finals of the show.

31
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,440
Wow.

32
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,850
So he went through the whole line.

33
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,170
You went through the whole addition.

34
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,070
Wait outside.

35
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:58,980
But I'll get my best j London moment.

36
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,391
We were,

37
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:00,950
uh,

38
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,940
we were in the house and it was a game,

39
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,070
have fraud had called it 10.

40
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:06,750
I don't know if you ever heard of this,

41
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:10,890
but there's a group of people and you
start telling facts about your stuff's

42
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,730
self,

43
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,890
starting from the most innocuous thing.

44
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,180
That's number 10.

45
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:16,050
Like I might say,

46
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:16,571
you know,

47
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:17,401
my name's Alonzo,

48
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,450
I'm from New York City,

49
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,171
you know,

50
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:21,180
and you go around that number nine,

51
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,441
you,

52
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,274
you know,

53
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,350
uh,

54
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,860
I had my first girlfriend
at 18 or whatever,

55
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:26,380
you know what I mean,

56
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,090
like you go number six j Dot j Dot London.

57
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Sometimes I get mad at myself and I ripped
pubic hairs out with pliers and I was

58
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:36,061
like,

59
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,380
that's your fucking six.

60
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,960
Because I had to go after him.

61
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:41,520
I was like,

62
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,790
that's number six.

63
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,320
What the fuck do I have like six?

64
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,130
And he was serious,

65
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,963
absolutely,

66
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,830
absolutely mad at himself.

67
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,161
Like,

68
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:50,880
what is your,

69
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,241
what is,

70
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:51,510
no,

71
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,980
I don't think we got to number two.

72
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,390
What is the amount of himself for,

73
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,583
who knows,

74
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,281
who knows?

75
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:56,610
Jay,

76
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,660
Jay's a sweetheart.

77
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:57,871
But,

78
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,140
uh,

79
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,700
but definitely a tortured soul.

80
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,750
There are a lot of demons.

81
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,860
It was,

82
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,780
it was fascinating watching him become
famous because knowing him as long as I

83
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,781
knew him and then for us for a small
window of like a year or so after last

84
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:12,691
comic standing,

85
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:13,890
he was really well known.

86
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,171
No,

87
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:14,731
absolutely.

88
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:15,450
People loved him.

89
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:15,730
Yeah.

90
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,140
Yeah.

91
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,070
We were at the store.

92
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,933
People would love him.

93
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,570
He would.

94
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:20,640
People come up to him at
the store and they'll go,

95
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,840
can I get a picture with you?

96
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,150
And he'd be like me,

97
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,173
you want a picture with me?

98
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,940
Like he was like genuinely confused.

99
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,210
Yeah.

100
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,010
He never figured it out.

101
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:31,800
He was a guy who needed
someone to take care of them.

102
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,640
You need a manager?

103
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:32,820
Yeah.

104
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,280
He needed a man in here that would,

105
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,530
uh,

106
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,730
handle and take care of him,

107
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,720
which he didn't book them.

108
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,950
Just get them booked.

109
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:38,701
I mean,

110
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,370
it's just like having him
manage his career on his own.

111
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,750
Did he ever have a manager?

112
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,750
He was with a battery briefly.

113
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,351
Exactly.

114
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,410
Did he ever have a manager that.

115
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:47,730
No.

116
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:47,990
Yeah,

117
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:48,270
no,

118
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,020
he didn't.

119
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:49,430
We,

120
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:49,890
we,

121
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,170
we toured with them for awhile.

122
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:51,400
Me,

123
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,330
him and Gary Goldman toward
for about six months.

124
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,020
Really?

125
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,250
And I'm being,

126
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:00,190
Goldman would call it London itis
where you just get tired of Jay,

127
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,971
like you love him,

128
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,481
but man,

129
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,820
I can't do it anymore,

130
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:03,490
you know?

131
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:04,101
But he needed,

132
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,210
he needed somebody to help him.

133
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:09,400
It was fucked up because it was one of
those cases where if somebody worked with

134
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:10,234
him,

135
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,500
he could have sustained it.

136
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:11,841
You know,

137
00:03:11,841 --> 00:03:12,310
he's,

138
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,840
he's a guy who could just come in and
do 10 minute guest spots forever and

139
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:17,680
people would love it.

140
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,101
Well,

141
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:23,101
he opened up for Louis recently in La at
the comedy store when Louis was warming

142
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:25,060
up for his standup special.

143
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,540
Yeah.

144
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,460
That he filmed there
and he was really funny,

145
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:27,820
man.

146
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,070
He's got some great one line.

147
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,250
He's got some killer one.

148
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,480
My girlfriend had crabs.

149
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,770
I bought a fishnet stocking.

150
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,921
I'll be over here.

151
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,320
And he was like,

152
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,220
move the microphone.

153
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,770
When he went on a joke didn't go well.

154
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,860
He's the only guy I know who could
honestly do the same joke twice in one set

155
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,770
because he forgot and the crowd
would laugh because everyone knew,

156
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,270
like he honestly forgot.

157
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,620
He's already told that joke.

158
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,360
Oh yeah.

159
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:52,750
Well,

160
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,670
that's Dr Davidson from the UFC is the
one who connected me with the people,

161
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,880
but dude,

162
00:03:59,590 --> 00:03:59,920
they,

163
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,060
they've done a bunch of people now.

164
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,300
Bunch of UFC people
have staggering results.

165
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,491
Yeah.

166
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:09,491
You're saying Roy Nelson did his knee
or Daniel cormier is knee stem cells.

167
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,680
Either of those guys at Ak.

168
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,100
I would just do every joint.

169
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,230
Even if there's no problem,

170
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,410
I'd be like if you were the coach,

171
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:16,640
you back,

172
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,750
just get in there and just do it.

173
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,840
That's what Ludwig did.

174
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,003
Pretty applicable.

175
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,320
Preemptively got both shoulders done.

176
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,000
I think he did his hips too.

177
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,461
Dude.

178
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,110
I can't imagine the fuck.

179
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,360
He's such a savage and to
hold knits for somebody like,

180
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:29,981
like him.

181
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,390
Like winkeljohn should do that too.

182
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,910
Like you beat the fuck out of yourself.

183
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,751
Brandon Gibson,

184
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:35,570
all those guys.

185
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,030
You professional holder,

186
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,443
you need to do that.

187
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,550
That's worse than fighting.

188
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,220
Yeah.

189
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,550
Yeah.

190
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,840
For,

191
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,621
for your shoulder.

192
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,220
Don't health.

193
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,761
That's horrible.

194
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,970
Especially if you're holding
mitts for some fucking John Jones.

195
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,810
Come on.

196
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:47,830
Well Jon Jones hits hard,

197
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,300
but like imagine like,

198
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,480
like travis or Travis Browne,

199
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:54,880
allister,

200
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,713
allister.

201
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,950
Especially allister when he was on this.

202
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,130
I don't know if that's true or not.

203
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,233
I believe it's true.

204
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,710
I believe it was proven

205
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:09,100
so dumb that drug shit fucking stupid.

206
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,091
You know,

207
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:13,330
when I was in high school had to write
a paper and the paper that I wrote was

208
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:18,331
that you should legalize every drug
and and I was all the kind of thing,

209
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,460
a 13 year old,

210
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,020
right?

211
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,100
I was all hyped up on,

212
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:21,550
on,

213
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,410
on Nwa Gangsta rap and I was like,

214
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,090
how in the fuck did easy Egan oozy?

215
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,250
Like he doesn't look like
anybody that should have Uzi.

216
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,570
That's true is because he can sell and
the black market is the only thing that

217
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:35,201
makes crime.

218
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:35,560
I'm like,

219
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,950
why do we have a black if they want to.

220
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,140
But that's the thing is like everybody
is all fucking excited about marijuana

221
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,540
being you all plots.

222
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,840
Everybody's a fucking pussy.

223
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,010
You're out there like,

224
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,050
oh look at wic and smoke a joint on CNN.

225
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:47,884
Well guess what?

226
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,070
You still got fucking 500,000
guys that are locked up.

227
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:53,200
You should be protesting that
every fucking day of pop.

228
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,570
Really actually legal
like in those states.

229
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:58,940
They should just be letting dudes out
by the fucking dozens every minute.

230
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,893
That is true.

231
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,530
If you were in Colorado
and you're in jail,

232
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,661
I'd be like,

233
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:03,650
what in the fuck?

234
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,690
What the fuck?

235
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,430
And then how many of
those guys are in there?

236
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,350
And then they fucking catch a real case
in there because now you've got to fight

237
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,610
or you're a a fuck.

238
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,150
That's horrible.

239
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,170
That does happen.

240
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,801
That does happen.

241
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,820
All that shit should be legal.

242
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:17,510
The only thing that,

243
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,291
and people are like,

244
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:18,580
well,

245
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,720
they just tax it.

246
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:21,560
Everybody's like they just
tax to the government.

247
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,120
But that's on the idea that the
government gives a fuck the government.

248
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,661
I mean,

249
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,494
it makes more money.

250
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,470
It's not like if I can tax
you who wants to buy weed?

251
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,400
I wanted,

252
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,990
how do I tax everybody?

253
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,370
I make them all scared and then I
am prison guys for this illegality.

254
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,080
And then I can get the
public dollars because look,

255
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:40,211
it.

256
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,190
Isn't it scary that we got these black
and Mexican guys that are selling dope

257
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:44,210
and we need to put them somewhere.

258
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,900
My stepdad and his,

259
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:46,540
uh,

260
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,440
his um,

261
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,090
he had a business partner.

262
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:51,850
And architectural firm and they
beat each other up one day.

263
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,950
Should it be like he came home,

264
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,160
he had a black eye and he was
in his forties and I was a kid.

265
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:58,601
I was like,

266
00:06:58,601 --> 00:06:58,751
what?

267
00:06:58,751 --> 00:06:59,081
First of all,

268
00:06:59,081 --> 00:06:59,914
I was like,

269
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:04,780
I was fighting back down
to zero skills like this.

270
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,820
Like what did this
fight look like between.

271
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,330
Because I knew as basic
as that dead worse.

272
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,780
What is like he's a good guy,

273
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,040
he's a bad person.

274
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,630
But I knew the guy fought with two.

275
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:13,841
I'm like,

276
00:07:13,841 --> 00:07:17,260
that's even more ridiculous that that
guy gave you a black eye because that has

277
00:07:17,261 --> 00:07:17,861
to be thinking.

278
00:07:17,861 --> 00:07:18,970
I'm mad though.

279
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,110
They missed so bad.

280
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,090
Well it was a very complicated situation
where they had a government contracts

281
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,200
and then the government lost money.

282
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,900
Like there was like a,

283
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,630
there was a recession and during the
recession they cancel a lot of their

284
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:35,300
contracts.

285
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,781
So these guys,

286
00:07:35,781 --> 00:07:40,090
they put all this time and work and effort
into these projects and the projects

287
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:44,080
were pulled out from under them and all
their investment was done super fucked.

288
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,070
It was really bad.

289
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,150
And you know,

290
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:46,983
they all,

291
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,040
I'm sure there was a lot of blame on
both sides and who knows what the fuck

292
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:51,401
happened.

293
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,710
But it's weird when you
see someone come home,

294
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,450
your Stepdad got Scott are black.

295
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:58,190
I want what are

296
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,960
like if I was pretty sharp but be like,

297
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,591
for sure.

298
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:05,500
Keep your hands up next time for sure.

299
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:06,940
Don't let them get that close to you.

300
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,790
Talk Shit to each other.

301
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:09,821
Get in a fight.

302
00:08:09,821 --> 00:08:11,740
When I was 12,

303
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,350
I'm not making this up a whatever.

304
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,880
Fucking cars.

305
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:16,480
Right?

306
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,890
My Dad pulls in front of him.

307
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:18,880
He pulls it from my dad.

308
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,110
He gets out and my dad goes,

309
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:21,100
you want to fucking go?

310
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,640
My Dad's like,

311
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,211
oh no,

312
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,800
like an old school Irish boxer.

313
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,280
I remember being like 10 or 11 being like,

314
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:27,850
ah,

315
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,020
fuck man.

316
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,230
See the problem with that is Nick
Diaz can actually fight like that.

317
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:36,130
Oh my dad breaks off this dude that Sun
was about to throw him off the side of

318
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:36,830
the highway.

319
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,050
No leather jacket.

320
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,320
Did Not fuck around when a
guy stands out like that.

321
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,940
So that's doing the old school boxing.

322
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,050
One of two things can happen.

323
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,530
He's trying to scare you off
or he's so good with his hands.

324
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:48,940
He just Kinda roll actually.

325
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:49,061
Like,

326
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,691
what's up dude?

327
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:50,524
You want some?

328
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:50,971
Yeah,

329
00:08:50,971 --> 00:08:51,804
man.

330
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,610
It was weird.

331
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,830
That situation.

332
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
I'll tell you why.

333
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,630
For reals,

334
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,463
man.

335
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,640
I remember my dad got in the car.

336
00:08:59,641 --> 00:08:59,941
I'm like,

337
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,110
God dammit.

338
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,310
And then my brother gets out,

339
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,020
kicks getting the balls from behind.

340
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,790
I was probably 12 at the time.

341
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:10,050
He's as Christ brother kicked a
grown man and throw him in the balls,

342
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,020
but that's when it gets really dangerous
because that kid gets involved.

343
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,150
Father becomes like super violent.

344
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,910
Little Brown was doing what
was crying in the backseat.

345
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,253
How old were you?

346
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,860
Probably like 10 or 11 in the back seat.

347
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,380
Can't be trusted if shit goes down.
