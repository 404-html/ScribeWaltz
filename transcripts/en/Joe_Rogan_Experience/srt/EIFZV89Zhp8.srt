1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:02,200
MMM.

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,110
And we're live.
Dave Rubin.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:11,960
What a time to be alive,
Joe.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,160
I am so excited to be here because you
could have selected anybody.

5
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,390
I mean,
it ends tomorrow.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,370
It does end tomorrow.
Supposedly.

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:20,600
Allegedly.
Unless,

8
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:23,170
uh,
maybe Jill Stein wins.

9
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:23,781
No,
no,

10
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:25,610
I'm talking about the world.
I mean it is over.

11
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:28,850
I don't mean the election.
I mean the whole game is up tomorrow.

12
00:00:28,851 --> 00:00:30,030
You could have had anybody.
You,

13
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,270
you're a pretty powerful guy.
Powerful Joe Ryan.

14
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,350
Enjoy your company,
sir.

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:34,280
Well,
I appreciate that.

16
00:00:34,281 --> 00:00:37,490
But you could think of all the
philosophers you could had the thinkers,

17
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:38,900
the artists,
too much work.

18
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,480
Instead,
you went with me for the last show,

19
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,750
so I'm going to bring it.
I already,

20
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,100
I have notes.
I busted out the notepad.

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,690
I believe that end of the world is
tomorrow.

22
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,210
So you're the preview to the end of the
world.

23
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,520
So I feel like you're going to offer
some pr.

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,401
Well,
hopefully.

25
00:00:52,401 --> 00:00:56,060
What together we're going to offer some
perspective and a,

26
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:57,630
we're going to get a look at this thing.
Well,

27
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,610
I already pounded two of these bad boys,
so I am ready to this fucking thing of

28
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,090
270 milligrams of caffeine.
Well,

29
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,970
it sways in a small cans,
so I thought it was all right.

30
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,380
It seems like it seems small,
but if it was that much acid and think

31
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:11,510
about what we're doing to you,
you really have to think about it that

32
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,051
way.
Yeah.

33
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:14,540
I did acid once.
Only one time.

34
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,100
I did it once last week.
That did.

35
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,000
He really did.
It was awesome.

36
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,740
Yeah,
I've done it three times.

37
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:20,450
I only did it this year for the first
time,

38
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:22,310
but I've done it three times this year.
Really?

39
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,340
And you feel like all the doors,
the hinges of the brain,

40
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:28,760
there's still going because I don't
think we're any good at all before.

41
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,020
I think I'm going,
I'm out.

42
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,320
It's like cock for my brain.
Yeah.

43
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,600
I shrew many times.
You know,

44
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,730
over the years I did acid once,
did not like it at all.

45
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,230
I,
every time I closed my eyes and he's

46
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:41,720
like three dimensional triangle is
flying at me.

47
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,070
Like could not,
you know,

48
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,430
when you just can't stop your brain.
Like I felt that there was no end to it.

49
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:48,980
Shrooms until he's like very natural and
nice and pleasant.

50
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,700
Yeah.
The concern is the potency of,

51
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,370
of acid.
I hadn't heard it described by Terence

52
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:58,490
Mckenna as like molecularly,
if you looked at it in scale,

53
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:02,690
it's something the size of an ant that
can break down the empire state building

54
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:06,110
in 30 minutes.
That's a bit much for me at this point.

55
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,091
You know what I mean?
I,

56
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:10,730
I turned 40 this year.
I don't need to break down the empire

57
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,650
state building or any other building at
this point.

58
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,890
Now it's really about keeping the mental
faculties I have adding in a little more

59
00:02:18,261 --> 00:02:20,960
occasionally going from there.
Yeah.

60
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,820
But you know what I mean?
You have to function right?

61
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,440
Like you have a show,
you're doing comedy,

62
00:02:24,441 --> 00:02:27,020
all this stuff.
Like at some point the expansion of the

63
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:30,170
mind is like,
I still gotta be on earth.

64
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,820
You know,
if you got to do the show,

65
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:34,100
you definitely have to be there.
You have to be there.

66
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,963
But,
um,

67
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,890
Duncan and I did a show on acid.
We did our last podcast with full

68
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:42,520
disclosure.
We were on acid cheeses.

69
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,470
Yeah.
I'm sitting in a room sober with these

70
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,870
beans.
Well,

71
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:50,700
it's less is expected of me.
I think you,

72
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,910
you're expected to be rational.
But being a standup comedian slash cage

73
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:58,130
fighting commentator,
you get a lot of wiggle room.

74
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

75
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,883
You can,
you could,

76
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,390
you could say some pretty stupid shit.

77
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,360
People go.
Yeah,

78
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,960
that's right.
Probably got hit in the head.

79
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,380
Exactly.
Yeah,

80
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,290
exactly.
So you know,

81
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,900
obviously we're going to do election,
but I,

82
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,160
there's a couple updates so I haven't
been here in about a year,

83
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:14,200
a little more than a year.
A couple of things I want to tell you

84
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,850
first off.
So I got a house last week not too far

85
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,140
from here building a home studio.
I'm very excited.

86
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,060
Cool.
Might,

87
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,890
my fans are funding it,
which is amazing.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,200
Oh,
a ton of stuff has happened since last,

89
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,530
but I told you last time that I would
know that I've hit a certain level of

90
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:36,931
success when I'm not sitting on an ikea
couch and did not have ikea stuff around

91
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,170
me everywhere.
Now,

92
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:41,710
I did bring all the Ikea stuff,
but I made one purchase for the new

93
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:42,940
house.
Only one purchase.

94
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,870
We've got a real couch.
I got a real couch.

95
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,540
That's nice.
I had a real couch.

96
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:48,310
I mean,
I'm talking people delivered it and I

97
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,950
didn't have to put it together.
It was act.

98
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,700
Did you?
I didn't even know that that was a thing

99
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,390
that they come put together.
Did you know that Kia stuff is bullshit.

100
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,270
If you just charge 10 bucks more and put
it together,

101
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,640
everybody would probably cost more than
10 bucks.

102
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,230
All right.
Isn't that the whole thing?

103
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,760
It costs more than 10 yeah.
If for them to put it together for you,

104
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,930
did they put it together for you?
Will they do that?

105
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,760
They will,
but it's going to be more than 10 bucks.

106
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,720
I don't even mind putting it together.
It was just time for me not to have to

107
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:16,980
put together furniture desks together
once and it's,

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:17,980
you know,
I was like,

109
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,050
I forgot it.
If it had an estimate of how much time

110
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,970
it took,
but it took me four fucking hours.

111
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,500
[inaudible]

112
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,220
answer.
Was this an acid situation?

113
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,020
That would be something different.
Shit.

114
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,320
Ikea assembly on acid.
I bet you do it better.

115
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,250
You know like talk Willis,
the guy who pitched a no hitter,

116
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:37,810
he was fucked up all day.
He was doing acid and then you got the

117
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,910
call and didn't know he's supposed to
play that day.

118
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:41,260
And it's like,
oh no,

119
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:45,030
they want me to play today.
He like got his shit together for good.

120
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,050
Just pitching.
Just imagine getting your shit together.

121
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,910
Getting there.
Just that in and of itself.

122
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,600
Well it depends on the guests,
your biological makeup,

123
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,920
how it hits you,
you know,

124
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:56,380
cause I know a lot of friends who just
can't smoke pot.

125
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,060
They just,
it just doesn't work with them.

126
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:01,720
And with me it works great.
It's my favorite.

127
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,760
What do you like indicators?
Sativa or hybrid?

128
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,650
I'm prefer sativa,
but if someone's passed around the end

129
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,890
to good joint,
I don't say no.

130
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,020
See,
all my comic friends like Sativa,

131
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,360
I like Endeca because for me at this
point,

132
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,310
and I guess this goes back to the doors
and the main thing,

133
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:17,260
like I don't want to think anymore if
I'm smoking,

134
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,600
I don't smoke pot to think or to write
or anything.

135
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,340
I smoke pot because it's 1130 at night
and I'm going to take one puff and watch

136
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,560
Seinfeld that I've seen 3000 times
already or simpsons that I've seen three

137
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,010
and that's it.
You know what I mean?

138
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,120
Like I don't need,
I don't smoke to like,

139
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,020
like all my concrete smoking,
right.

140
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,863
Or that.
And I'm like,

141
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,850
no.
So it's a decompressing.

142
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:37,960
Yeah.
Agent purely.

143
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,153
Purely.
Yeah.

144
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,120
Well,
you know,

145
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,620
people get real wary when you started
talking about pot or acid or even

146
00:05:44,621 --> 00:05:48,760
alcohol because there's a lot of people
that everyone knows that it's kind of

147
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:50,500
fucked her life up doing that.

148
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,860
But 35,000 people died driving every
year.

149
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,750
It doesn't stop us from driving,
you know?

150
00:05:55,751 --> 00:05:58,580
I mean,
and obviously if you're doing acid,

151
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:00,650
most likely you're not going to kill
somebody else.

152
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,200
So it's the responsibility of driving
out of a window like a Helen Hunt did

153
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,180
that.
Did you ever see that inform word,

154
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:10,490
that kid's thing?
They showed it at my high school.

155
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,870
They showed it in high school.
How?

156
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,150
When I was growing up,
I think it was helen,

157
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,040
how you know which one I'm talking
about.

158
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,460
What they should know.
That education will video where they

159
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:18,980
showed these high school kids and it's
Helen Hunt.

160
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:21,830
It was like a 15 year old and she's on
acid and she jumped out a window and

161
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,930
breaks the window.
It just kills herself at school.

162
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,780
Fucking old Bill Hicks bit.
Remember that Bill Hicks,

163
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,060
bit young man on acid thought he could
fly,

164
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:30,230
jumps off the building.

165
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,120
What a tragedy goes.
What a Dick.

166
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,460
He thought he could fly.
What did he tried taking off from the

167
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,830
ground first and as we lost a moron,
man,

168
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,520
we need a hex.
Don't we need a hicks?

169
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,570
Every day I wake up and I go,
man,

170
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,200
I wish we had is still,
because we still,

171
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,120
you know,
obviously there's plenty of good comics

172
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:51,570
out there and there's so much,
there's such a plane,

173
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,570
this stuff to,
I don't need to see Helen Hunt to talk

174
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,460
about.
Um,

175
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,870
you know how many times that it's been
said before,

176
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,903
Hey,
a lot.

177
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,080
That's the best Paul Riser.
It's not his business card.

178
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,150
I think he wakes up in the middle.
I like,

179
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,010
what the hell was I talking about?
Acid?

180
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,740
No.
People dying.

181
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,560
No,
we moved on all the good comics.

182
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:13,460
There was something there.
Oh,

183
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,510
well one that,
just imagine what George Carlin would be

184
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:21,110
going through if he lived right now,
the politically correct age we live in.

185
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,340
If you took any of his old stuff,
he would be being attacked by all sides.

186
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:29,120
But dare I say he'd be hacked more by
the left these days for the shit that he

187
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,600
would be talking and saying about women
or about minorities or anything.

188
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,160
You know,
it's so,

189
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,170
it's such a shame the way things have
turned.

190
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:36,741
Well,
yeah,

191
00:07:36,741 --> 00:07:40,010
he had some mean stuff that I think
like,

192
00:07:40,011 --> 00:07:42,410
I remember this one bit that he had that
even at the time I was like,

193
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:45,440
whoa.
It was like anorexia and he's like,

194
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:47,770
dumb,
rich doesn't want Tucker,

195
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,050
but we need that now.
That's the point.

196
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,990
You know what I mean?
It's not,

197
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:56,670
he wasn't saying this specific girl who
may have anorexia that you're going to a

198
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,120
lot or died from anorexia and you heard
that you'd be like,

199
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,260
whoa man,
you would,

200
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,750
you would,
that would upset you at that moment.

201
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,990
And then you know what life goes on.
You know George Carlin,

202
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:11,610
there was one issue with Carlin and that
one issue was that he had a plan to do a

203
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:17,111
whole new hour every year.
And so he would put together this hour

204
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:19,550
and he didn't work out at comedy clubs
either.

205
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,280
He would just sort of write it and then
go and perform it and you know,

206
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,320
do little tweaks here and there,
but that doing that one hour every year,

207
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:33,590
like you don't have enough time to like,
you can't sit around and go,

208
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,260
hmm,
I wonder if this is a good bit,

209
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:36,981
you know,
I want to,

210
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:39,200
am I committed to this?
Cause I believe in it.

211
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:42,920
Like if I explored all the possibilities
and all the ways that this is going to

212
00:08:42,921 --> 00:08:45,380
be interpreted,
is this the most effective way to convey

213
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:48,500
that idea?
But he was also so,

214
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,360
so loved and so awesome that he just
wanted to shock the shit out of people.

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,830
That was half of it was like he tired of
all this.

216
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:58,830
Talk about Anorexia and you know,
maybe if he was alive today and you were

217
00:08:58,831 --> 00:08:59,970
talking to him about it,
he would,

218
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,580
he would change his opinion on that bit.
Yeah.

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,300
Look,
I'm sure if we went back in the however

220
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:08,590
many years you've been doing standup
there things that you've said there

221
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,360
probably that's probably not,
as you said last week.

222
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,530
Yeah.
But,

223
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,040
but we need that idea of people just
saying shit and letting it upset people

224
00:09:20,701 --> 00:09:22,020
and other people are going to laugh at
it.

225
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:27,260
We so desperately need it now because it
has led the inability to do that these

226
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,080
days has led to everything that's
happening in our country right now.

227
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,840
What related to politics and media and
everything.

228
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,190
You're right,
there's a blow back,

229
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,540
right?
If you go too far left though,

230
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:43,620
the alt right emerges and I think the
more looney we get in terms of like

231
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:48,120
gender pronouns and that there's 58 now
it's 58 gender pronouns.

232
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,860
Yeah.
I didn't have to,

233
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:52,860
you know this morning I think the only
recognize 31 in New York that you could

234
00:09:52,861 --> 00:09:54,700
be sued.
$250,000 for it.

235
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:57,870
Or you find if you pull it up,
it's fucking fiasco.

236
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,930
It's wonderful.
It's one going to look back at this and

237
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:04,050
laugh as long as you're not one of the
person who gets fined $250,000 and I

238
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:06,060
don't think anybody's ever been hit with
that yet.

239
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,290
I think that's more more like horse
shit.

240
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,720
But it's not even,
it's not even about the fine as much as

241
00:10:12,721 --> 00:10:16,920
what it does to us as people.
Then it puts the idea in your mind,

242
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,990
look,
if I was walking down the street and I

243
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:20,910
saw a guy and I said,
hey,

244
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,490
how you doing man?
And then I realized it was a woman,

245
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,760
I would kind of feel bad.
But that's life.

246
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,610
That's life.
We're trying to through words and

247
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:30,150
trickery.

248
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,070
And now legal means we're trying to dumb
everyone down to the point that we can't

249
00:10:35,071 --> 00:10:38,640
even think for ourselves.
If you look at somebody and you think

250
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,170
they're a man and you say,
dude,

251
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:42,700
that's not evil.
Right?

252
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,541
You know what I mean?
And,

253
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,430
and not every person that transitions
transitions perfectly and someone might

254
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:49,260
be in the middle of it or whatever and
you know,

255
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,620
or there might just be a guy who looks
like there's,

256
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,220
there's guys that look like women and
there's women that look like guys.

257
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:57,240
You know what's ironic about this is
it's not really a trans issue.

258
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,920
Cause you know,
talk to trans people.

259
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:02,250
Most women who transition to men want to
be called men.

260
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,310
And most men who transition to women
want to be called women.

261
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:08,010
Like they're there.
They assumed gender pronouns.

262
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,300
Like the guy who becomes a woman wants
to use he or once you,

263
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:13,470
she or her.

264
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Right?
So it's not them.

265
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,140
It's just nonsense is what it is and
it's nonsense that comes out of

266
00:11:19,141 --> 00:11:21,840
universities.
It's this weird Marxism thing that's

267
00:11:21,841 --> 00:11:26,010
going on.
It's this very strange leftist bullying

268
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:28,890
because it's so deranged.
I went to,

269
00:11:28,891 --> 00:11:33,000
I know you've had my on here and he's
become like this cultural thing.

270
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:35,370
It's like he's,
he's sort of become something beyond

271
00:11:35,371 --> 00:11:38,220
himself at this point.
What's the streisand effect that keeps

272
00:11:38,221 --> 00:11:41,280
silencing him and when you silence the
guy who,

273
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,010
first of all,
what they silenced him for was so

274
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:47,760
unwarranted because when you,
when you remove someone on twitter for

275
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:52,110
just a harmless joke that's very similar
to the jokes that Leslie Jones makes

276
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:53,470
about her own self.
You know,

277
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:53,980
she's got a

278
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,310
God damn commercial.
Yeah.

279
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,550
She pulls up a Geico commercial,
I think it is.

280
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,060
Well,
what does that,

281
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,710
what does that commercial was?
She pulls up to someone.

282
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,640
I don't know who it is,
what it is,

283
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,710
but she pulls up to a guy,
she's like,

284
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:05,110
do you want my number?
You guys who get the fuck out of here?

285
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,560
It's like an obvious joke about her
being unattractive.

286
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,110
She's perpetrating that joke.
That is what it is.

287
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:11,911
I mean,
if that's,

288
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:14,320
say if you do that same joke with,
you know,

289
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:16,690
fill in the blank.
What's a girl for Sofia Vergara or

290
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,310
something like that.
The joke doesn't work.

291
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,150
It's just hot as fuck.
And then the guy would be like,

292
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,370
but when Leslie Jones does it,
the reason why that joke works is

293
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:26,140
because they're implying that she's not
attractive.

294
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,300
So all Milo said is something about her
being a man or looking like a man or

295
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:31,900
something like that.

296
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,920
And that was enough.
Well,

297
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:35,530
what's particularly interesting about
what happened to him is that they

298
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:36,870
claimed,
I think when,

299
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:38,890
when twitter finally said a little
something about it,

300
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,520
that it was because if targeted
harassment that Milo had unleashed his

301
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:44,200
followers on her.
Now first off,

302
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,380
you're not.
You don't control all your followers.

303
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:49,020
You know what I mean?
If you got into a fight with somebody,

304
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,770
Joe Rogan got into a fight with somebody
on twitter,

305
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,110
uh,
you can't control what your followers

306
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,820
do.
And so that's number one.

307
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:56,530
Number two,
she,

308
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,050
she had done that before.
There are instances,

309
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:03,010
people had screen captured things where
she had gotten into fights with trollie

310
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,810
type people,
not public people and said,

311
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,644
guys,
get them.

312
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,090
So she had actually instigated mobs.
But it's okay for all the politically

313
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,400
correct reasons,
it's okay when she does it well not only

314
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,420
she had,
she'd done that,

315
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:17,230
she had said things about white people
specifically like white people,

316
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,410
you know,
and it was specifically mocking white

317
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,740
people are saying things about white
people where it's like you can't do that

318
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:24,574
the other way.

319
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,470
The,
you know,

320
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:30,220
there's this also this very bizarre
thing that people keep saying is that

321
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,150
black people can't be racist against
white people because racism only works

322
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,780
when someone's in a position of power.
Guess fucking what?

323
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,740
If you have millions of followers and
you're super famous and you say things

324
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:42,371
about,
you know,

325
00:13:42,371 --> 00:13:45,220
any white person,
you have a position of power.

326
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,720
Not only does she have a position of
power,

327
00:13:46,721 --> 00:13:49,840
but she think how much by doing,
by that fight happening,

328
00:13:49,841 --> 00:13:53,200
she got more powerful her,
her star rose.

329
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,150
Yeah.
So by damaging free speech,

330
00:13:55,151 --> 00:13:57,520
whether you like my lower,
not she,

331
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,610
she then elevated her own status.
I actually,

332
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,100
I've never interacted with her.
I've never even seen ghostbusters.

333
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:04,120
I don't,
I don't even watch this.

334
00:14:04,121 --> 00:14:06,160
And now I don't even know what she's
really done or anything better.

335
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,250
But when the whole thing was going down,
I went to tweet at her to say,

336
00:14:09,251 --> 00:14:09,800
come on my show.

337
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,140
I'd be,
I,

338
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,110
I like Milo buttom all that free speech.
I'd love to have you on.

339
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,300
She has me blocked.
She blowouts.

340
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,410
I Dunno.
It's like a mass block thing.

341
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:19,690
Maybe you block people associated with
Milo or something.

342
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,070
But the point is,
I have nothing.

343
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:24,970
I have nothing against her in any way.
We're just talking about this specific

344
00:14:24,971 --> 00:14:26,770
thing and I was going to invite her on
my show and it's like,

345
00:14:26,771 --> 00:14:28,270
well,
well you're a nice guy.

346
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:30,400
That's so cowardly.
It's so foolish.

347
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,630
I,
and I like Leslie.

348
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,760
I think she's funny as hell.
I think she's hilarious.

349
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,450
I even enjoyed her and ghostbusters
I'll,

350
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,790
although Milo is correct,
most of that movie,

351
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:38,840
it was a piece of shit.
Yeah.

352
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,600
I thought the movie started out really
funny,

353
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,580
but what he was saying was that it was
like,

354
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:46,840
it was a ridiculous feminist version of
ghostbusters where all the men are

355
00:14:46,841 --> 00:14:50,080
complete buffoons and failures and all
the women saved the day.

356
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,100
And it just wasn't a good movie.

357
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,030
It wasn't well designed and it was sort
of a kind of a slap in the face to men.

358
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:59,510
And that was his whole commentary on it.
It was very eloquently written.

359
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,820
Maybe a little bit bitchy,
but that's his whole thing.

360
00:15:01,821 --> 00:15:03,020
Yeah,
it wasn't,

361
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,000
it certainly wasn't targeted harassment.
It was a review of art will look,

362
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,090
the point is that even if he had been
harassing her and said,

363
00:15:11,091 --> 00:15:13,130
guys,
get her first off,

364
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,730
but if he did do that,
I can understand them saying we don't

365
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,410
want our platform use for that.
Sure.

366
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:20,630
So that's up to their terms of service.
So I'm not,

367
00:15:20,631 --> 00:15:22,250
so there's obviously a difference
between,

368
00:15:22,251 --> 00:15:23,360
of course,
the First Amendment,

369
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:25,790
which is the government stopping you
from speaking of what a private company

370
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,980
can do.
Ironically though all these people on

371
00:15:27,981 --> 00:15:30,590
the left that we're thrilled or had no
problem with Milo being banned,

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,520
they're the same people that want it to
force that Baker in Indiana to bake the

373
00:15:34,521 --> 00:15:35,540
cake for the gay wedding.

374
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,290
So they're okay with private companies
doing things when it's the things that

375
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,680
they want them to do,
like get rid of,

376
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,290
uh,
a conservative,

377
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,560
right when they want it to force that
bay.

378
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,650
I'm gay,
married,

379
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:48,260
right?
So I wouldn't force that Baker to do it.

380
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,041
Why?
You know,

381
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:50,810
what's fucked up about,
why would I want the government?

382
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:53,660
Why would I want the government to say,
you have to do something with your

383
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,710
private business.
No,

384
00:15:54,711 --> 00:15:56,510
I'll go to another fucking baker.
Of course.

385
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,460
And not only that,
that's,

386
00:15:57,461 --> 00:16:00,110
that wasn't an organic situation.
They'd set that up.

387
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,320
They went specifically and targeted
bakers to try to make a case for this.

388
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,430
Right.
And then you went to a Christian Baker

389
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,850
and finally found one who said no,
and that was the one they went after.

390
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,080
You know,
I mean,

391
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,610
look,
I don't agree with that guy and not

392
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,750
being able to make that cake.

393
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,110
I feel like you shouldn't go and do
business at that guy's place.

394
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:21,410
And that's the kind of person he is.
But what they're doing is,

395
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:23,970
I like trying to target that guy.
But would you for,

396
00:16:23,971 --> 00:16:26,410
would you want the government forced him
to do well?

397
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,940
I would think,
I think the market should dictate

398
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,990
whether or not someone does.
I mean,

399
00:16:31,010 --> 00:16:35,010
I think alerting people is a good thing,
but having the government dictate to

400
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,100
these people have to make that case.
That's kind of,

401
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,140
that's kind of crazy.
So that's the,

402
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:41,390
that's what's happened to the left.
Basically.

403
00:16:41,391 --> 00:16:46,391
The left has gone from liberalism using
logic and thinking and uh,

404
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,870
an information basically to make
decisions to inform your decisions.

405
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,370
And usually liberals err on the side of
the other.

406
00:16:53,371 --> 00:16:56,180
So in this case they're trying to,
they think they're protecting the gaze

407
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,050
so that,
right.

408
00:16:57,051 --> 00:16:59,540
Like we want days to get cakes where
everyone else gets cake.

409
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:02,780
So we're going to help the gays.
But what they've done is all they're

410
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:05,210
doing is expanding state power.
They're extending,

411
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:07,820
expanding control.
Let the market decide.

412
00:17:07,821 --> 00:17:09,920
Sure you want to,
you want to use your free speech,

413
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,740
protest outside,
tweet about it.

414
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,590
It's,
they don't go there.

415
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:15,500
There's a baker to two blocks over goes,
especially if you're gay,

416
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,251
you know,
use your,

417
00:17:16,251 --> 00:17:18,620
use your money wisely.
Support people that support your

418
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:19,880
community.
Of course,

419
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:22,100
that's a,
but that's a thing for everything.

420
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:23,930
That's for rude people.
That's for,

421
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,810
you know,
for assholes,

422
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:28,460
for people who are Shitty to you.
For people who are,

423
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,710
you know,
it's just for people who will rip you

424
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:31,341
off.
I mean,

425
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,980
it's kind of along the same lines.
Let the market decide,

426
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,030
let the market decide.
Of course,

427
00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:37,430
if you don't like Joe Show,
you don't like Reuben's show.

428
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,660
You don't watch,
don't watch.

429
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,340
Tell people that you don't like it.
And that's quite all right,

430
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:45,170
but,
but don't try to shut us down.

431
00:17:45,171 --> 00:17:48,680
Don't try to go to youtube and strike us
or whatever other thing there is.

432
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,100
But that's what the left

433
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,110
is doing this now.
And that's why I talk about the left all

434
00:17:52,111 --> 00:17:56,100
the time because I have liberal and I'm
watching my guys band speakers,

435
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:59,100
I'm watching my guys d platform people.
I'm watching,

436
00:17:59,101 --> 00:18:02,820
my guys tried to close restaurants and
it's like you're now you're moralizing

437
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:04,980
the same way you've mocked the
Christian,

438
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:05,970
right.
For All these years.

439
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,680
Yeah.
It's,

440
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,950
it's just,
it gets to a point where you,

441
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,280
you wonder if it's to swing back the
other way.

442
00:18:11,281 --> 00:18:13,350
I've been saying for a while,
we'll find out tomorrow.

443
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,551
Yeah.
Right.

444
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:18,300
And that creates tomorrow.
I've been saying for a while that I

445
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:20,250
think Caitlyn Jenner created Donald
Trump.

446
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,100
Not really,
but it created this thing.

447
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,720
I mean,
I think there was a thing,

448
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:28,830
there was a tipping point.
And for me it was when they gave her

449
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:33,660
woman of the year and Glamour magazine
and then Espn has gave her ass a athlete

450
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:34,440
of the year.

451
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,440
And when we're that ridiculous thing
that they did where they circled or

452
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:40,980
House with the helicopter and she was
hiding behind the curtains and there was

453
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:41,850
all mysterious,
like,

454
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,420
what in the fuck are you selling?
What is this?

455
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,990
And for people at home that are like in
Indiana and they're drinking beer and

456
00:18:48,991 --> 00:18:51,510
they like football and they went to
watch the sps to see,

457
00:18:51,511 --> 00:18:53,760
you know,
like who won best quarterback in the

458
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,080
year?
And they're seeing that kind of shit.

459
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:58,110
They're like,
what the fuck is as we need a make

460
00:18:58,111 --> 00:18:59,820
America great again.
You know,

461
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,490
I never linked it that specifically,
but I think you're totally right.

462
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,870
Even right now,
when I've been watching,

463
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,580
you know,
nba season just started and I love

464
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:08,430
basketball.
Every time I turn on TNT now it's

465
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:12,300
Barkley and Kenny Smith and Shaq and
Ernie Johnson talking about race.

466
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,700
They're not talking about basketball,
they're talking about race.

467
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,270
They're talking about policing.
Those are all important issues to talk

468
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:21,960
about.
But people go to sports for the release,

469
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,390
they go to sports because they care
about that leads and what's happening on

470
00:19:24,391 --> 00:19:26,880
the field and in the,
in the boxing match or whatever it is.

471
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,120
And now everything is becoming
politicized.

472
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:33,780
So espn is giving their athlete of the
year to Caitlyn Jenner.

473
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:36,920
It makes no freaking sense.
Well that was the NFL ratings down.

474
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,880
You know,
it's because people are talking about

475
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:41,850
Kaepernick and politics instead of
sports.

476
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:44,040
Does that make the ratings go down?
Really is the ratings down.

477
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,880
The ratings are hugely down in the NFL
this year.

478
00:19:45,881 --> 00:19:48,450
And a lot of people are linking that.
I don't know it empirically,

479
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,120
I wouldn't be shocked.
There's a lot of people in this country

480
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,830
just have zero tolerance.
I mean,

481
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,660
it's almost like separation of church
and state.

482
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,900
They would like their sports to just be
sports and about sports.

483
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,771
Yeah.
You know,

484
00:19:58,771 --> 00:20:00,690
and I,
I kind of appreciate that in a certain

485
00:20:00,691 --> 00:20:02,940
way because it's like if you were
watching a comedy show and all of a

486
00:20:02,941 --> 00:20:06,020
sudden during that comedy show they
started deeply discussing religion,

487
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,650
like really like discussing deep
intricacies of different faith based

488
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,590
cultures.
You'd be like,

489
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:15,780
what the fuck am I want?
This is not comedy.

490
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,630
Right.
Do is funny.

491
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:19,170
Sure.
But once you heard that thing and now

492
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:21,450
you're doing something else right,
you're doing a different thing but

493
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:22,890
you're not doing sports.
You're doing,

494
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,900
you're doing race relations.
Are you doing?

495
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,240
But I don't understand that.
It's also,

496
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:30,690
they look at it as a platform for our
culture and that's what Kaepernick did.

497
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,351
He said,
look,

498
00:20:31,351 --> 00:20:35,280
I have this platform.
And in some ways I think what he did

499
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:39,000
kind of worked because a lot of kids in
high school now are doing that.

500
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,040
They're taking knees and the national,
you know,

501
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,010
when they do the national anthem,
it's,

502
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,270
it's strange,
but it's also like the black,

503
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,040
uh,
when people have the black fist at

504
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,960
the Olympics,
when those dudes that did that and the

505
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,180
1960,
seventies,

506
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,900
I think it was 71,
[inaudible] 71,

507
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:55,150
something like that,
whatever that was.

508
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,430
I mean,
that got people talk and this gets

509
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:00,430
people talking to,
and maybe sometimes you need to kind of

510
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:05,431
inject some sort of something to think
about during sporting events.

511
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,190
I'm not,
again,

512
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,010
I'm not telling them not to do it.
Of course I would knit cabernet and

513
00:21:09,011 --> 00:21:10,030
wants to do that.
Go ahead.

514
00:21:10,031 --> 00:21:11,950
These guys,
if Barkley and all they want it,

515
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:14,620
if they're tnt bosses are okay with it
may go,

516
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,191
well,
you know,

517
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,080
you can do that.
Instead of talking about how many points

518
00:21:17,081 --> 00:21:18,220
to ran head then,
so be it.

519
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,810
But I'm just saying what I think most
people want from sports is an escape.

520
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,480
And I can tell you for sure in the two
or three weeks at the NBA season,

521
00:21:26,481 --> 00:21:26,980
it's been gone.

522
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,710
Every time I flipped by TNT and they're
doing that,

523
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,960
I change it where I used to.
I love those guys.

524
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:36,130
I think that show in many ways is an
incredible social experiment,

525
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:38,610
not just as a sports.
I don't know what the show is.

526
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:40,540
You know,
it's the after show on TNT where they'll

527
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:42,970
watch Barkley.
So it's Barkley who's obviously

528
00:21:42,971 --> 00:21:46,810
completely outspoken and an incredible,
and Kenny Smith who also is in shack,

529
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,001
uh,
and,

530
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:52,410
and Ernie Johnson's the token white guy
in the white guys,

531
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,040
but they're all really great and their,
their rhythm with each other for four

532
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,100
guys to sit there and do it.
They've been doing it for probably 15

533
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,480
years.
Shacks newer to it.

534
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,680
But anyway,
uh,

535
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,140
I go to espn or tnt for sports and you
want to hear,

536
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:09,780
and there's so many to talk about in
sports.

537
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,530
It's all these players.
All these plays,

538
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:14,440
all these games,
so much is riding on each event.

539
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,280
Yeah.
So I'm not a grudging them any of the

540
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,710
legitimate things that you're talking
about.

541
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,960
Of course they,
the athletes can do whatever they want

542
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:24,280
to express themselves in any way.
But once that starts becoming more of

543
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:25,750
what you're talking about,
then the sports,

544
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,360
that's why people start tuning out.
Well again,

545
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:31,870
the market's decided right and if their
ratings go down because of this,

546
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:34,210
I guess maybe someone in the head office
will go,

547
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,170
hey guys,
what the fuck?

548
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,033
Right.
You know,

549
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,860
and that's how it should be.
I mean that's absolutely how it should

550
00:22:38,861 --> 00:22:39,641
be.
Yeah,

551
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:42,340
it's,
it's a fascinating time and I think this

552
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:45,010
is a side effect of everyone having a
voice.

553
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:47,440
Cause we all have voices now.
You know what I mean?

554
00:22:47,441 --> 00:22:52,000
This is the new world we live in.
The new world we live in is anyone can

555
00:22:52,001 --> 00:22:54,550
broadcast,
anyone can get on periscope and just

556
00:22:54,551 --> 00:22:55,360
start talking.

557
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,610
Anybody don't tell everybody that anyone
can.

558
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,910
Anyone can get on twitter and just make
a post about something.

559
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,530
I mean,
I've been telling my people,

560
00:23:02,531 --> 00:23:05,170
I'm the only one that can do it.
You remember that woman?

561
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,680
What was her name again?
The woman who wrote the post about aids

562
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,330
on twitter.
I'm going to Africa.

563
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,770
Hope I don't get aids.
Lol.

564
00:23:11,771 --> 00:23:12,670
Just kidding.
I'm white.

565
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:15,510
Yeah.
She was just a nobody pr person.

566
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,860
Nobody knew who she was before that.
I can't remember her name.

567
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,880
Justine Sacco,
right?

568
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,380
Yeah.
I think that's it.

569
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,700
Yeah,
but that,

570
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:25,570
that sort of event it was,
it's like that's the beginning.

571
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:29,350
It's the first pop of the colonel when
you start making popcorn and you hear

572
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,990
that first pop,
pop,

573
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:31,860
pop,
pop,

574
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,640
pop up,
blah blah,

575
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,200
blah.
We're culturally about to fucking Jiffy

576
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:38,110
pop the fuck out of this thing.
That's what's happening.

577
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,760
You're going nuts.
You know?

578
00:23:39,761 --> 00:23:43,180
I remember when that sacco thing
happened and so basically she said that

579
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,980
she said that joke,
she gets on a plane,

580
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,100
she disappears for what,

581
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,440
eight 10 hours or something and then she
gets up late.

582
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,420
Her life is destroyed.
She has to leave her job,

583
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,321
blah blah,
blah.

584
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:53,840
She's publicly humiliated.
I remember and look,

585
00:23:53,841 --> 00:23:56,630
I tweet all the time.
I love twitter and I love the way you

586
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:59,300
can communicate through it.
But I remember I didn't tweet anything

587
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:01,100
about it intentionally cause I was like,
wait a minute,

588
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,030
it's good for you,
please.

589
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:02,541
I was like,
wait,

590
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:02,840
wait,
wait.

591
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,390
Let me get this straight.
A woman who I've never heard of before

592
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:08,570
who's not a public person per se,
tweeted a bad joke,

593
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:11,930
basically really tasteless,
stupid thought.

594
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,110
Her life is going to be the short.
Why would I add to that?

595
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,200
So I really tried to make a conscious
decision to just be like,

596
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,880
you know,
and I do that now and again,

597
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,260
we're certain news things where I'm
like,

598
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,410
this one,
I'm going to sit out because we this

599
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:28,070
gang mentality like no one had,
you'd know you didn't know who that was

600
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:29,960
before.
Nobody knew who this woman was before.

601
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,500
But so one random person said something
that I didn't like,

602
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:35,480
we must destroy her.
So you're right,

603
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,880
it is.
That's the first pop and now they're,

604
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,740
these pops are happening all over the
place.

605
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,800
Which by the way,
is what I,

606
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,320
why I think what Peter Teal did with
Hogan and Gawker is fucking phenomenal.

607
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,890
I agree.
Nominal.

608
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,200
Right,

609
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,270
great.
Because there,

610
00:24:48,271 --> 00:24:51,850
there's some,
there's some violent and aggressive

611
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:55,990
invasion of privacy that's going on with
companies that are trying to make a lot

612
00:24:55,991 --> 00:24:58,480
of money by doing that.
And that's one of the things that a lot

613
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,960
of people thought about Gawker.
Yeah,

614
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,080
I'll do,
I did read an incredible piece on Gawker

615
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,290
from May,
I hate to say this about donald trump's

616
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:09,200
hair or they are investigating donald
trump's hair is a very expensive,

617
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,560
I read it and they had like a diagram of
showing how beers around and like that

618
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,140
there's an office in trump tower

619
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,560
does that.
That's one floor below his and the

620
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:23,080
office doesn't have any,
it doesn't have a website anymore.

621
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,590
And they've been doing this procedure
for like a long time.

622
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,150
Yeah.
And it's like they essentially,

623
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:33,190
they take a hair and then they,
they find whatever hairs you have and

624
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:38,191
they sort of tie this hair onto your
hair one hair at a time and it's like

625
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:42,670
some crazy eight hour procedure.
And the speculation is that the entire

626
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:45,880
business revolves around maintaining his
hair in that manner.

627
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:48,340
Now as someone who,
uh,

628
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:51,220
is bald,
his balls going to try to do thing

629
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,580
violently challenge hair transplants.
I went to the

630
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,170
big smile scar in the back of my head
from you chop out a piece of the back of

631
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:02,920
your head and they tried to put it up
front.

632
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,930
Yeah.
The way I described it as like they take

633
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:08,410
some people that are really healthy and
they move into a neighborhood where

634
00:26:08,411 --> 00:26:09,250
everyone's dying.

635
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,490
That's funny.
Yeah.

636
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,690
Well I,
I was,

637
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,680
you know,
when I did it,

638
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,910
I was in my late twenties and I was,
I was just on television and I was

639
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,440
panicking because my hair was falling
out.

640
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:21,240
I was like,
Oh my God,

641
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm just,
my career is just getting started and

642
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm going to lose it all because I was
thinking very probably correctly that a

643
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,910
lot of my success is predicated on my
appearance.

644
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,550
And I was like,
if this goes like if I go bald,

645
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,620
I'm fucked.
They want had shaved heads back then in

646
00:26:35,621 --> 00:26:36,790
the nineties either.
If they did,

647
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:40,090
it was very rare and a,
so I went through all this,

648
00:26:40,091 --> 00:26:42,880
but it helped.
It definitely gave me like thicker hair,

649
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,733
but

650
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,270
it was too,
it was too much work and eventually I

651
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,240
realized like it's so pointless.
And then when I shaved my head it was

652
00:26:51,241 --> 00:26:55,200
like the most freeing feeling.
I'll say I like it better like this.

653
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:57,600
If I,
if I had hair right now at fucking shave

654
00:26:57,601 --> 00:26:58,350
it.
Yeah.

655
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,950
I mean I'm holding ground and I,
when I looked wonderful,

656
00:27:01,951 --> 00:27:03,660
don't,
don't go hard on your hair,

657
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,750
but I used to have hair over here.
You know that that's what happens is as

658
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:09,240
you age.
But I know for sure there were times in

659
00:27:09,241 --> 00:27:11,550
my life when I was very stressed and I'm
not kidding you.

660
00:27:11,551 --> 00:27:13,290
I could feel it.
Could you feel it when you were,

661
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:16,290
when you were losing hair,
could you feel it at times coming out?

662
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,230
Not like a,
almost like a,

663
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,300
not literally like each individual
thing,

664
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:23,930
but almost like a,
I could feel my tension there basically.

665
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,460
And as I,
that was just psychological.

666
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,390
Yeah.
Maybe.

667
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,520
Maybe.
Maybe your hair is completely connected

668
00:27:29,521 --> 00:27:30,650
to your emotions.
Maybe you're one of them.

669
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,590
That's why I don't smoke pot anywhere
cause that's what I would think about.

670
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,900
I smoked pot and go,
wait a minute,

671
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:34,830
what's going on up there?
You know,

672
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,950
railing,
kind of,

673
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,050
yeah.
That's the,

674
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,370
that's the rub on the pot.
Right?

675
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,900
But it's fucking with you.
Yeah,

676
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,090
exactly.
Just comes to this.

677
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,330
That's why I like the Sativa Endeca.
I like pop for that reason though to go

678
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,600
to fucking with me.
I don't know.

679
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,880
It's like that old joke that Kennison
used to have about a,

680
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:53,040
they say every man's got a homosexual
fantasy.

681
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:53,940
He goes,
oh,

682
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,130
I'm sitting around the other day.
Go on through my fantasies.

683
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:57,980
Because if there's one on there,
I want to know.

684
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,650
I want to know about it.
Did you find yours?

685
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:05,520
I didn't have one.
So sorry for your people.

686
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,920
So when you see someone that is shaved,
that feels good about it,

687
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:12,770
as you said,
it's like a burning off all the time of

688
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:13,820
the dudes are struggling.
I'm like,

689
00:28:13,821 --> 00:28:17,580
just shave your fucking head so that,
doesn't trump seem doubly ridiculous to

690
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:18,540
you in a certain way?
Well,

691
00:28:18,541 --> 00:28:20,880
he's more than doubly ridiculous.
He's ridiculous.

692
00:28:20,881 --> 00:28:22,710
In a million different wines just on the
hair front.

693
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,270
Really.
I mean that's cliche so we don't have to

694
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:26,500
spend too much time talking about,
but doesn't that like if someone who

695
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:27,960
shaved your head,
you feel good about it,

696
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,590
that he does this thing,
this whatever the fuck he did.

697
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,420
He always says it's my hair,
it's my hair.

698
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:35,910
Which is sort of a cop cause yeah,
they're probably doing something by

699
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,460
Harris.
Yeah.

700
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,100
But doesn't it seem doubly ridiculous?
And to someone like you like knowing

701
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:44,250
that you shaved and you feel good and
life goes on and then I get it from a

702
00:28:44,251 --> 00:28:47,520
psychological standpoint,
I get it also is a person who likes to

703
00:28:47,521 --> 00:28:49,110
have control of their life.

704
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,900
You know,
like you,

705
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,590
you feel like that's one thing that
really freaks people out about their

706
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:56,550
hair,
but it's like features and an appearance

707
00:28:56,551 --> 00:28:57,990
is very bizarre.
Right.

708
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:02,220
Cause I know this woman who recently got
a nose job and uh,

709
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:05,700
she's beautiful and she decided that she
didn't like her nose and she got like a

710
00:29:05,701 --> 00:29:07,230
little bit trimmed off.
It's kind of crazy,

711
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:07,710
right?
Yeah.

712
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:12,210
But there's a weird thing where people
decide that if my nose was one eighth of

713
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,600
a millimeter smaller,
I would feel better about myself.

714
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:20,580
I would feel better about my appearance.
But I've met people that have big noses.

715
00:29:20,581 --> 00:29:21,900
No,
she doesn't look any better.

716
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:23,700
She looked great before.
She looks great now.

717
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,930
It's just a weird thing that people do.
They fixate.

718
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,880
But what I was going to get at is it's
really strange,

719
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:33,260
like what we decide looks good,
you know?

720
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:37,170
And that it's cultural and a lot of ways
because if you go to something like,

721
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,990
how bout those think it's Sir Siri women
who decide,

722
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,340
put those giant plates

723
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,370
in their lips.
Yeah.

724
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:46,630
And the bigger the plate,
the more cattle they're worth when they

725
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:49,900
get married.
There's like fucking really bizarre

726
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,690
cultures.
And it's an example of how human beings

727
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,870
when isolated for whatever reason,
what I mean,

728
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:59,470
there's scar scarf,
vacation rituals that many cultures go

729
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:03,490
through with a cut pieces out of their
skin to appear to look like crocodiles.

730
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,040
And you're seeing that where they do
their backs then do it.

731
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,881
Yeah.
Yeah.

732
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:11,881
They cut these chunks out of their back
and then they develop these keloid scars

733
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:16,930
that pop up and they see if you could
find that Janet men with crocodiles

734
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,730
scarring.
But it's,

735
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,060
there's so many different scarf,
vacation rituals,

736
00:30:22,061 --> 00:30:23,740
and look at me,
I'm covered in tattoos.

737
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,950
There's like weird things that people do
to their body and weird appearances that

738
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:30,850
people choose to enjoy or not enjoy it.
And it just gets,

739
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,290
it gets very bizarre.
Like,

740
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:36,670
what the fuck is hair?
Why is that guy's back?

741
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,421
Oh Man.
Oh,

742
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:38,960
I have seen that.
Crazy.

743
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,390
Yeah,
and they just,

744
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:44,470
they cover their entire back with this,
that it makes it look like,

745
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,970
like a crocodile skin.

746
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,180
Wow.
Yeah.

747
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,133
Well,
you know,

748
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,600
joy bay heart used to say a phrase on,
on the view,

749
00:30:50,601 --> 00:30:52,840
dare I quote the view,
but joy bay,

750
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:54,560
how are you saying that?
I always thought it was great.

751
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,490
It was really simple.
She usually,

752
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:59,330
they just say it's an inside job,
that everything really is just an inside

753
00:30:59,331 --> 00:31:00,650
job.
So if you're walking around,

754
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:03,110
your friends walking around and she
thinks that this little,

755
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,870
you're a beautiful woman,
but she thinks this little millimeters

756
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:09,350
so it bothers her.
For some reason it's an inside job.

757
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:11,780
Now she may still have that same
insecurity after,

758
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,540
or maybe she exercised it,
you know?

759
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,860
Or maybe it actually did do what it was
supposed to do.

760
00:31:15,861 --> 00:31:19,730
But most of us are walking around the
ship that we're walking around with is

761
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:24,731
just an inside job and it's your,
it's your job as a human to to exercise

762
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:25,964
that stuff.
And that's,

763
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,280
I mean,
I try to do it every day that that's

764
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:29,900
what you're trying to get better is all
about.

765
00:31:29,901 --> 00:31:32,180
And then we fail at it constantly.
I fail every day.

766
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,620
But there's also like a certain amount
of you that should be upset with the way

767
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:42,530
you look so that you force yourself to
go to the gym and he keeps you healthy.

768
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:45,100
That'll west Hollywood.
We talked about this last time I was

769
00:31:45,101 --> 00:31:47,400
here.
You know where every guy is,

770
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:50,110
but they're disgusting,
but they're actually disgusting.

771
00:31:50,111 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah.

772
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,630
How so?
Because they're just fucking each other

773
00:31:52,631 --> 00:31:55,330
in the street cause they're not dogs
because you don't want to go to the

774
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,560
steam room.
I don't know.

775
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,960
I just left.
I lived in West Hollywood for three

776
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,340
years.
I never,

777
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:05,230
I went to the Locker Room in that gym,
24 hour fitness once cause I had to pee

778
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:07,210
so bad as Hollywood is the one I always
talk about.

779
00:32:07,211 --> 00:32:11,380
My friend used to be the manager there.
I used to go to the 24 hour bastard.

780
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,410
I used to go to the 24 hour fitness and
woodland hills and there was a guy that

781
00:32:14,411 --> 00:32:16,390
worked there that was my friend who was
a manager.

782
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,200
They sent him over,
he was at another 24 hour fitness but he

783
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:22,450
was like a really good well organized
guy,

784
00:32:22,451 --> 00:32:25,810
well liked and they sent him to West
Hollywood to clean up and he said he got

785
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:29,800
there and dudes were just gone at it in
the sauna and they would have to mop it

786
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:31,180
down.
He said it was insane.

787
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:33,610
He said it was basically just a gay
hookup spot.

788
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,643
The whole

789
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,860
frankly is disgusting.
I made it really real,

790
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:41,570
but beyond just like that,
just the sex or whatever,

791
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,440
this idea that you have to look perfect
and there's never enough.

792
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:49,610
And that's why for me it's like that's
why gay marriage was so important.

793
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:53,140
Not because of the weather you want to
get married,

794
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,000
not is irrelevant.
But the idea that all these people that

795
00:32:56,001 --> 00:32:59,270
could never get married,
they had to stay in the rat race

796
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:01,520
forever.
Imagine that if you always felt like you

797
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:05,660
had to stay in the rat race because the
same equality of being in a relationship

798
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:09,830
that was sanctioned by the state,
as silly as that may all be in at some

799
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:11,780
level,
but the idea that you just had to stay

800
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:15,830
in this race forever and then one day
you're 50 and you're trying to look like

801
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:19,820
you're 20 because you're still in that
race because you never found someone,

802
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,710
whether it's a guy or a girl or
whatever,

803
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,170
that you can start,
you know,

804
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,680
maturing into some other thing with.
Yeah.

805
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,220
And that's why your quality was
important.

806
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:29,480
Marriage.
Equality was important to me,

807
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,180
not whether someone actually gets
married and Milo and I have great

808
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:33,710
debates on this.
Um,

809
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,820
but that you got to get out cause
there's nothing sadder than,

810
00:33:36,821 --> 00:33:39,080
than those people that never stopped

811
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,900
to you on the outside.
But if those people are on

812
00:33:42,901 --> 00:33:46,190
antidepressants and cocaine,
they might be having a great time,

813
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:49,740
but maybe they're happier than me.
Hash the expendable income.

814
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,590
Yeah,

815
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:54,130
they got her hair plugs and there 10
beyond imagining they look good.

816
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:56,350
I'm not saying they don't look it,
but actually they don't look that good

817
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,600
because their muscles are too big.
You know,

818
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,550
they all just,
the shirts are too tight.

819
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,520
Like it's like settle down everybody.

820
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,480
Yeah.
Well there's,

821
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,250
there's a lot of that going on.
I,

822
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,710
you know,
I used to work out at Gold's gym on

823
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:09,820
coal,
which is,

824
00:34:09,821 --> 00:34:11,770
uh,
you know where that is in West

825
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,300
Hollywood.
It's like right down the street from

826
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:17,920
sunset and Gower Studios.
We used to do news radio at sunset and

827
00:34:17,921 --> 00:34:19,690
so there was a gold's gym down the
street and I'm like,

828
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,990
oh well I'll just make a membership
there that way over at lunch I can just

829
00:34:22,991 --> 00:34:25,000
shoot over,
get a workout in real quick and get by.

830
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,330
Because I had just gotten used to like
set life,

831
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,700
like life on the set,
on a new sitcom,

832
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:34,750
you're working at a minimum.
If those sitcoms not going well,

833
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:38,050
like Newsradio wasn't really going well
in terms of like we're trying to find

834
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:42,760
its legs in the early days and we would
work 1214 hours a day and it was really

835
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,130
hard to do stand up at night and it was
really hard to work out.

836
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,060
I was like,
God damn man.

837
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:48,340
And same with like my hair.
I was like,

838
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:49,630
shit,
I got to stay in shape.

839
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,230
You know,
like there's a lot of scenes on news

840
00:34:51,231 --> 00:34:53,800
radio where I had to take my shirt off.
That was like a kind of a part of who I

841
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,660
was.
I don't want him to replace me.

842
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,660
I better fucking keep going to the gym
and pus on vein.

843
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:01,690
So anyway,
I went over to this gold's gym and I

844
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:05,410
didn't know that that was exactly like
the 24 hour fitness West Hollywood.

845
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,560
It was just a gay disco.
I used to feel like a tasty little

846
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:12,610
morsel and a big homos.
I would walk in there like a wounded

847
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,910
antelope trailing up to the waterhole
and there was all these dudes with like

848
00:35:15,911 --> 00:35:18,700
scrunchy socks,
like from fucking Olivia Newton,

849
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,410
John,
let's get physical and they would have

850
00:35:20,411 --> 00:35:24,520
timberlands on and cutoff Jimmy's we'll
wearing animals.

851
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,710
It just fucking big yoked up,
steroid up dudes just gay or than the

852
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,350
day is long.
It was a,

853
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,370
it was,
it was interesting because it made me

854
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,880
feel like what it must feel like to be a
woman who's not interested in getting

855
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:38,010
hit.
Who goes to

856
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,000
the gym.
Yeah.

857
00:35:39,001 --> 00:35:40,830
Well when I first moved to West
Hollywood,

858
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,200
I first was intimidated by it because I
was like,

859
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:45,630
you know,
I'm at this gym with all these like huge

860
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:46,500
muscly,
whatever.

861
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,930
And then as time went on,
I started enjoying it because I was

862
00:35:48,931 --> 00:35:50,670
like,
this is actually ridiculous.

863
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,570
It really is a comedy.
So if you take it just at that,

864
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,230
which that's the level you are taking it
out,

865
00:35:56,231 --> 00:35:58,410
you walk in there and go look at this
idiot and timber who worked out in

866
00:35:58,411 --> 00:35:59,190
timberlands.
Right?

867
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,770
But you're not kidding.
They actually do with Jean shorts.

868
00:36:01,771 --> 00:36:05,040
It's like,
what are you building a log cabin or

869
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,830
working out like spending,
they're sending rather a very clear

870
00:36:07,831 --> 00:36:10,290
message.
They're looking for some Dick and this

871
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:12,660
is how you get it with Timberland's.
Throw that flag up.

872
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,880
Timberland,
the daisy dukes are important.

873
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,330
There's no,
there's no like subtlety and daisy

874
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:20,820
Dukes,
daisy dukes on whether you're a guy or a

875
00:36:20,821 --> 00:36:21,930
girl.
You're looking for Dick,

876
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:22,890
right?
Well,

877
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,140
the universal flag of,
I'm looking for Dick,

878
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,550
I got to get some new shorts.

879
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:30,840
Daisy did something about the daisy
Dukes,

880
00:36:30,841 --> 00:36:32,090
right?
Like,

881
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,080
and when guys started adopt them,
it's like,

882
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,400
whoa,
all right buddy.

883
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,530
But that's,
that all goes to like,

884
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,720
nobody cares.
Like all of this stuff about,

885
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,610
what are we talking about?
Gay Marriage or any of the stuff.

886
00:36:41,611 --> 00:36:43,650
It's like enough already.
It's there.

887
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:45,390
It exists.
Like plot support,

888
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,650
I should say.
We want to say one thing.

889
00:36:46,651 --> 00:36:48,570
I support you doing whatever the fuck
you want to do.

890
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:52,710
If you want to wear a daisy dukes and
fuck a bunch of dudes who cares,

891
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,240
go have fun.
This is,

892
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,520
this is a short experience.
I'm 49 years old,

893
00:36:57,521 --> 00:37:00,810
so I'm almost 50 which is if everything
goes great,

894
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,210
I'm halfway dead and it's probably not
going to go that great.

895
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,930
All the accident pot and all that jazz.
I have a little faith in some of the

896
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:09,090
robotics that are coming in,
some of the gene stuff,

897
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,910
but I mean realistically I don't want to
plan on that.

898
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:15,360
And then I also got some dose,
so you're on the good side of it,

899
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:17,880
but on the good side of it,
but there's also issues like fucking

900
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:20,490
asteroids,
supervolcanoes Zombie invasion,

901
00:37:20,491 --> 00:37:23,040
alien attack.
Who knows what the fuck's going to go

902
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,750
down in the next couple of decades.
But yeah,

903
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,560
my point is this is a short ride.
It's not that long.

904
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,780
It seems like it's a long time when
you're young,

905
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,530
because when you're 22 you look at 81
god,

906
00:37:34,531 --> 00:37:37,080
it's so far away.
But when you're 50 and you look at 80

907
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:40,200
like Yo,
that's around the corner a year is not

908
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:43,080
that long.
It just seems long when you've only gone

909
00:37:43,081 --> 00:37:45,000
through 20 of them in your whole life,
you're like,

910
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:47,040
wow,
it's so long here.

911
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:51,960
I can't wait until I'm 21 you know?
And then all the sudden you look back

912
00:37:51,961 --> 00:37:52,591
and you go,
oh,

913
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,370
this thing happened in the blink of an
eye.

914
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,770
My from 30 to 40 which I turned this
year went so fast.

915
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:02,070
I mean I,
I remember my 30th birthday and I

916
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,200
remember thinking wow,
and now like I'm not a kid anymore.

917
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:04,660
Like,
cause I,

918
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,270
you can push it into your twenties
right?

919
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,040
You can get through your 20s and still
think you're somehow not an adult maybe

920
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,640
or but 30 then you go,
well shit,

921
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,410
now I'm kind of,
and now it's like wow,

922
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:17,880
I just turned 40 and it's like now it's
like this is real.

923
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,860
This is really real.
You're in now.

924
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,490
And I think the key is to not even
concentrate on that,

925
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,650
to be aware of it,
to recognize it,

926
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:28,290
to address it,
but just to concentrate on,

927
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,030
and this is such a fucking cliche
statement,

928
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,650
but I tried to say it as much as
possible,

929
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,920
living in the moment,
just being here in the taking care of

930
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:36,070
your

931
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,180
biology,
you know,

932
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,670
respect your meet vehicle,
take care of that thing,

933
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:42,850
but try to enjoy this thing and live in
the moment.

934
00:38:42,851 --> 00:38:44,590
And the more you don't live in the
moment,

935
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,490
the more you get caught up in bullshit,
the more it gets away from you.

936
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:52,600
And then anxiety and nonsense and all
this stupidity and that kind of goes

937
00:38:52,601 --> 00:38:56,350
back to trump with his fucking wacky
hair like you not living in the moment.

938
00:38:56,351 --> 00:39:00,340
If you're a 70 year old guy and you're
spraying your hair down with a fucking

939
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,760
gallon of aquanet before you go out and
everybody knows what you're doing,

940
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,830
everybody knows what you're doing.
That's the piece.

941
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:08,170
That's the piece.
It's like everyone knows some shame,

942
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,780
that fucking head,
you're worth $18 billion,

943
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:12,820
whatever the hell he's,
maybe he's not really worth that much.

944
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:14,590
Right?
There's nothing we have no freaking clue

945
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,050
I'd like to do with them.

946
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:17,950
Come on and do it.
I'll do it.

947
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:20,830
He did that today.
Imagine if he did it today,

948
00:39:20,831 --> 00:39:23,230
one day before the election he went in a
landslide.

949
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:27,640
He would get there would be such
positive real towards him.

950
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:31,170
Like you guys would go,
he's wonderful.

951
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
Larry.
David would endorse him.

952
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:34,450
I mean it would be huge.
Well,

953
00:39:34,451 --> 00:39:38,170
I'm curious as to the backlash against
trump,

954
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,740
not the current backlash against trump,
but when it's going to come from other

955
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:45,640
people because people,
when whenever someone is perceived to be

956
00:39:45,641 --> 00:39:46,870
a bully,
whether he is or not,

957
00:39:46,871 --> 00:39:50,140
you can make your own choice decision
about that.

958
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,460
But I think he is and a lot of people
think he is and I think that's also

959
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:56,830
probably one of the reasons why he's
been so successful is because he's so

960
00:39:56,831 --> 00:40:00,940
ruthlessly competitive and he thinks of
himself so highly and those sorts of

961
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:05,020
traits like narcissistic,
narcissistic traits are oftentimes very

962
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,530
prevalent.

963
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:07,030
And people that are successful in
business,

964
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:10,360
like really successful like he is when
he puts his name on everything and he's

965
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,730
branded everything and everything's
trump this and trump that.

966
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:15,220
He has no notion whatsoever staying low
key.

967
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,700
Well w when you fight against like he's
really mad at Alec Baldwin on Snl for

968
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:25,270
doing what I think is hilarious and
very,

969
00:40:25,271 --> 00:40:26,530
it's,
it's really well done.

970
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,880
Like that thing that they do grab him by
the Bougie,

971
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,823
you know,
he does that.

972
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,070
Alec Baldwin,
his best work I think since fucking

973
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,570
beetle juice.
Yeah.

974
00:40:34,571 --> 00:40:35,620
Right.
Well what is the one,

975
00:40:35,621 --> 00:40:39,160
the one glengarry Glen Ross,
probably his best work since the coffee

976
00:40:39,161 --> 00:40:42,390
is for closers line has been this shit.
I mean it's,

977
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,460
it's,
it's funny and he gets angry.

978
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,610
Like Jon Stewart did a bit,
he was doing this,

979
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:49,690
uh,
um,

980
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,280
stand up for veterans for some sort of a
benefit and he did this bit where he

981
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:58,900
started reading off these twitter
exchanges between him and Donald Trump

982
00:40:58,901 --> 00:41:01,310
that Donald Trump just started tweeting
at him in the,

983
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:05,080
in the middle of the night,
like a tweet from one 30 in the morning.

984
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,580
Have you seen this?
Uh,

985
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,091
I mean,
uh,

986
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,620
probably have seen some of the brand
new,

987
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,540
it's brand new,
this standup bit.

988
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,061
Oh,
you should watch.

989
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:11,780
No,
I haven't seen it.

990
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,850
So let's pull it up,
Jamie,

991
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:15,100
because I,
I think Jon Stewart,

992
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,660
I think we could actually play this
unused.

993
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,450
I'm friends with John Stewart.
I'm sure he would let us play it cause

994
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:21,220
it's,
I think he'd also agree that this is

995
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:23,920
kind of important.
Like it just shows you,

996
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:29,310
it's not whether or not Donald Trump's
conservative approach and make America

997
00:41:29,471 --> 00:41:32,140
great again and not letting in terrorist
and all that stuff.

998
00:41:32,141 --> 00:41:33,710
All the things you may or not agree
with.

999
00:41:33,711 --> 00:41:36,290
We're just talking about from a
psychological standpoint,

1000
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,370
from looking at him as a human being.
Like there's,

1001
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:44,210
there's some thing off here.
There's something incorrect about his

1002
00:41:44,211 --> 00:41:45,500
thinking.
Well that's,

1003
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,330
you're hitting a lot of the,
a lot of this stuff.

1004
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,164
So we can look,
let's,

1005
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,110
let's watch this because it's pretty
fucking funny

1006
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,980
to find out somebody was tweeting weird
shit about me.

1007
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:58,803
Okay.

1008
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,180
So on April 24 2013 at 11:00 AM someone
comes into my office and says,

1009
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,490
Donald Trump just tweeted,
I promise you I'm much smarter than

1010
00:42:14,491 --> 00:42:16,530
Jonathan Leibowitz.
I mean,

1011
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:20,370
Jon Stewart,
who by the way is totally overrated.

1012
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,573
Okay,

1013
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,140
now I'm going to say something to you.
This is real,

1014
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,093
okay.

1015
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,950
And I don't necessarily disagree with
it.

1016
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,193
Okay?

1017
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,510
So,
so I said,

1018
00:42:37,511 --> 00:42:41,830
as you might say to yourself,
what the fuck is that about?

1019
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:43,610
Okay,

1020
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,790
so we're not quite sure.
We can't quite figure it out.

1021
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:51,170
So
a couple of days later,

1022
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:54,860
he tweets,
as I've said many times before,

1023
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,870
Jon Stewart is highly overrated.

1024
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:02,540
Okay?

1025
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,540
I swear this is true.
He tweets again if John Stewart is so

1026
00:43:07,641 --> 00:43:12,020
above it all and legit,
why did he change his name from Jonathan

1027
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,030
Liebowitz?
He should be proud of his heritage.

1028
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:16,791
Yeah,
that,

1029
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:18,080
that,
that guy wants to be president.

1030
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:18,651
Okay,
hold on,

1031
00:43:18,651 --> 00:43:19,484
let me keep going.

1032
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,150
Okay.

1033
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,410
Then he tweeted,
Jon Stewart,

1034
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,140
he's a total phony.
He should cherish his past,

1035
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:29,260
not run from it.
So I start to think to myself like,

1036
00:43:31,370 --> 00:43:33,770
Oh,
I think this guy's trying to let people

1037
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:38,771
know I'm a Jew.
And I think to myself like does it my

1038
00:43:42,711 --> 00:43:43,544
face to do that.

1039
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,530
Okay.

1040
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:50,500
Honestly,
like where have you seen this face other

1041
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:52,090
than a poster for Yentl,
right,

1042
00:43:52,091 --> 00:43:55,780
right.
What world are people like Stewart?

1043
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,540
That's a Scottish name,
but there's something about that fella.

1044
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,580
Okay.

1045
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,250
That looks a little shmear.
Yeah.

1046
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,000
It wouldn't be funny if it wasn't so
toxically fucking crude and horrible,

1047
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:17,030
but so I decided to tweet back at him.
Have any people don't know this,

1048
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:23,750
but donald trump's real name is fuckface
von clown stay.

1049
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,180
Okay.

1050
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,460
I wish you would embrace the fon plows
stick.

1051
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:35,393
Yeah.

1052
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,493
Yeah.

1053
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,650
Awesome.
You remember by the way,

1054
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,980
Lincoln used to get into this shit

1055
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:51,983
all the time.

1056
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:01,990
I swear to God this is true.
The man who will more than likely given

1057
00:45:02,121 --> 00:45:06,950
the FBI's preference be our next
president then tweeted

1058
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:14,830
amazing how the haters and losers keep
tweeting the name fuckface von Karman.

1059
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:19,930
Right.

1060
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,650
They are so original and like no one
else is doing.

1061
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:30,190
What happened is it turned out a lot of
people on twitter picked up on the name

1062
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:35,191
fuck face and started tweeting at it.
Then you tweets.

1063
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,980
What's funny about the name?
Fuck facebook.

1064
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:42,020
Okay.

1065
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:47,020
It was not coined by John Liebowitz
stole it from a moron on twitter,

1066
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,180
so I do back.
We seem to have hit a fuckface von

1067
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:01,564
nerves today.

1068
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,563
Silence

1069
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:17,040
radio silence.
Four days later,

1070
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:23,210
I shit you not
perhaps the next president of the

1071
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:29,220
greatest country in the world at one 30
in the mall.

1072
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:30,143
Morning

1073
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,070
tweeted little Jon Stewart is a pussy.

1074
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:45,963
Okay.

1075
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,390
Hopeless in a debate with me.
Vote wisely this November.

1076
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,310
Well that that line at the end.
Yeah,

1077
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,550
really says it all right there,
but wisely this November,

1078
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:04,570
because this is where we're at now and
Jon Stewart is a pussy,

1079
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:08,440
is that that speaks volumes too.
Like who fucking tweet?

1080
00:47:08,441 --> 00:47:10,000
Something like that.
Who's what?

1081
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,340
Seven year old tweet,
something like that was running for

1082
00:47:12,341 --> 00:47:13,750
President John.
I'm going to do something.

1083
00:47:13,751 --> 00:47:15,520
It's very difficult right now.
Oh,

1084
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:18,880
I'm going to try to defend Donald Trump
for a second on this,

1085
00:47:18,881 --> 00:47:23,140
which is he is using the system against
itself.

1086
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,750
So he's using the trolling tactics.
He knew what,

1087
00:47:26,751 --> 00:47:28,210
what is his ultimately?
Yes.

1088
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,460
That's all insane.
That's all completely,

1089
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,820
utterly insane.
Strange like antisemetic dog whistling.

1090
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:36,000
Although it's as if John Stewart hiding
the fact that he's Jewish.

1091
00:47:36,001 --> 00:47:39,070
It talks about being Jewish everyday.
Like there's so much bizarre lunacy in

1092
00:47:39,071 --> 00:47:42,730
there in the comments,
but what my best defense of him is not

1093
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:45,010
that he look,
the guy's obviously a narcissist.

1094
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:47,320
He obviously has some sort of
personality disorder and all kinds of

1095
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:50,500
other shit and and shady business
practices and we don't know the taxes

1096
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,380
and all that stuff.
The defense I can give of him is that

1097
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:57,370
he's using the system against itself.
So all of this corrupt media bullshit,

1098
00:47:57,371 --> 00:47:59,560
all of this political correctness,
all of this,

1099
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,840
the outrage culture,
all the stuff we've been talking about,

1100
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:05,950
he purposely does it just to keep his
name out there.

1101
00:48:05,951 --> 00:48:07,390
So these idiots,
these,

1102
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,870
the lapdog media just keeps giving him
free attention.

1103
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:14,050
And then by giving him free attention,
he doesn't have to spend the money,

1104
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,640
but all the other candidates do.

1105
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:18,430
Hillary's outspending him.
I don't know what the numbers are,

1106
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,030
but I bet you it's something like 20 to
one and it's like he's just using it.

1107
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:25,840
So does he believe any of this stuff
he's saying and is that morally wrong

1108
00:48:25,841 --> 00:48:27,520
and ethically gross?
Sure.

1109
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,400
But he's just using the system.
And I think,

1110
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:31,660
you know,
when people are saying,

1111
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:32,141
well,
you know,

1112
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,120
if it had only been rubio and although a
lot of Democrats,

1113
00:48:34,121 --> 00:48:36,970
whenever we'd only been rubio or Romney
or Jeb Bush,

1114
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,580
it would have been so much better.
All the shit,

1115
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:42,140
whether they're calling him anti women
are anti gay or Antioch,

1116
00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:44,290
they would have been saying it about
them too because they did it.

1117
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:46,030
I mean,
remember what they were saying about

1118
00:48:46,031 --> 00:48:48,280
Romney four years ago,
he had binders of women,

1119
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:49,480
he hates women,
he hates him.

1120
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:52,210
Or like I would probably vote for Romney
at this point.

1121
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,410
He did say binders of women.
Right.

1122
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,880
But it was just,
they took it out of context.

1123
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,240
There's a talking point.
I mean that's what politics is all

1124
00:49:01,241 --> 00:49:02,660
about.
What's important to know?

1125
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,440
First of all,
I agree with you and I think his use of

1126
00:49:05,441 --> 00:49:08,710
really ridiculous statements and stuff
is brilliant because he does force the

1127
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:10,450
media to report on some of the things he
says.

1128
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:13,560
But that was 2013 he was running for
president then,

1129
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,030
right?
No.

1130
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:16,840
So he,
he has always used it for his own

1131
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:19,630
purposes just to keep his own celebrity
out there.

1132
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:22,030
Right.
So everything he's done from,

1133
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:26,320
from any point that I can remember him
from in the 80s to forward has been to

1134
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:29,050
further his own brand,
his own empire,

1135
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,850
his own money,
all of that stuff.

1136
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:34,360
And now he's just,
he's doing exactly what the media has

1137
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:35,890
demanded in a weird way.

1138
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,380
You know,
like the media doesn't even wait for us

1139
00:49:38,381 --> 00:49:39,910
to get outraged anymore.
They,

1140
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:42,460
they're sitting there,
all of these people at all of these,

1141
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,990
you know,
daily beast,

1142
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:47,090
all these sites that somehow we're all
considered legit and nothing personal

1143
00:49:47,091 --> 00:49:48,220
against daily beast.
I'm just picking one,

1144
00:49:48,221 --> 00:49:52,300
but like they're literally just waiting
for him to tweet so that they can write

1145
00:49:52,301 --> 00:49:54,460
the article about the outrage that the
tweet,

1146
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:57,550
because they don't even wait for us to
be outraged.

1147
00:49:57,790 --> 00:50:00,850
They just start.
So it's like he's just feeding them.

1148
00:50:00,851 --> 00:50:03,460
He's feeding the monster.
Knowing it keeps getting more clicks.

1149
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,880
The more clicks and views he gets,
the more they'll want to talk about him.

1150
00:50:06,881 --> 00:50:08,140
The more money it makes,
the networks.

1151
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:11,710
It's like he really is just,
he's just playing the game really well.

1152
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:14,080
He's playing the game brilliantly.
I mean he's a great,

1153
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:15,760
he'll,
he does a great job at it.

1154
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:16,181
Yeah.
Look,

1155
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:19,660
he loves wrestling.
I mean he used to do stuff with the WWF

1156
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:24,580
b because he gets that and that's what
people are missing here.

1157
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,530
So we can talk all about all the
policies and whether he actually has a

1158
00:50:27,531 --> 00:50:28,160
personality

1159
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,830
disorder and all that.
But in terms of the tactics,

1160
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,320
he's just doing it.
He's just,

1161
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,290
um,
they invited me to go on celebrity

1162
00:50:36,291 --> 00:50:39,380
apprentice back when we did the second
version of fear factor,

1163
00:50:39,381 --> 00:50:42,890
which I guess was like 2011 or 12 or
something like that.

1164
00:50:42,891 --> 00:50:45,380
I forget what year it was and I should
have done it.

1165
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:47,750
I didn't want to do it cause I would
have had to move to New York for like

1166
00:50:47,751 --> 00:50:48,584
three months.
Right.

1167
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:51,110
But my family was down when they are
like,

1168
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:51,980
let's do it.
And I was like,

1169
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:54,080
all right,
maybe fuck that.

1170
00:50:54,430 --> 00:50:56,090
I do that.
I'm like,

1171
00:50:56,091 --> 00:50:57,200
I don't know.
It's just this,

1172
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,740
I don't like shit.
I don't like showers.

1173
00:50:58,741 --> 00:50:59,574
You know,
I don't,

1174
00:50:59,630 --> 00:51:01,880
maybe if it was a show that I've watched
and joy,

1175
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:04,910
but I'd never watched it,
but I wish I did now because I wanted

1176
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:06,950
it.
I would love to have some insight.

1177
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:10,400
I love to be around that guy and pick
his brain because Jeff Ross was around

1178
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,670
him when they roasted him for comedy
central and he said the guy was very

1179
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:15,500
reasonable.
And this is when they roasted him.

1180
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:17,960
He like,
he signed up for the roast and Jeff had

1181
00:51:17,961 --> 00:51:19,010
a conversation with him.
He's like,

1182
00:51:19,011 --> 00:51:20,770
you know,
when they turn to you and they're saying

1183
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:23,180
jokes about you,
you should laugh because it looks bad if

1184
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,430
you're just sitting there like you're
upset,

1185
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:25,540
like,
or make you look better if you like.

1186
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,780
He's like,
you're right.

1187
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,030
Like he like,
he seemed very reasonable.

1188
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:32,540
I think there's something about,
he's very concerned with perception,

1189
00:51:32,541 --> 00:51:33,470
hence the hair,
right?

1190
00:51:33,471 --> 00:51:36,560
Like he's very concerned with control.
It's very concerned with all these

1191
00:51:36,561 --> 00:51:38,570
different things.
So like in a lot of ways,

1192
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,840
this is sort of a psychological profile
as much as it is a presidential race.

1193
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:48,590
It's like we're watching two different
people that are extremely flawed.

1194
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,870
Like she is not honest.
She,

1195
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:53,660
Hillary Clinton is a very,
very dishonest person.

1196
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,610
There's an incredible amount of data to
point that she is incredibly dishonest.

1197
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,220
Whether it's dishonest about the Clinton
Foundation,

1198
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,680
dishonest about the emails,
dishonest,

1199
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:06,710
completely about Bengazi.
Do you remember when they were trying to

1200
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:09,350
say Bengazi was all in response to a
youtube video,

1201
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:11,720
which she knew it wasn't the proven
yeah,

1202
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:13,430
exactly.
Exactly.

1203
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:15,020
And it's,
it's very,

1204
00:52:15,021 --> 00:52:17,630
very disturbing when you consider the
fact that it's not,

1205
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,210
that's not,
it doesn't disqualify you from running

1206
00:52:20,211 --> 00:52:22,700
the government.
It doesn't like if you're going to have

1207
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:24,830
someone who represents the people of,
you know,

1208
00:52:24,831 --> 00:52:27,500
as John Stuart said,
and I agree the greatest country in the

1209
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:30,470
world,
you should have someone who's honest.

1210
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,080
And he look,
even Barack Obama's turned out through

1211
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,940
these wikileaks,
um,

1212
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,490
uh,
releases that he lied about not knowing

1213
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:39,530
that Valerie Clinton had that email
server.

1214
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:40,520
Yeah.
He had,

1215
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:42,080
you know,
he had commented on it and he had

1216
00:52:42,081 --> 00:52:44,690
emailed her on it.
So that's not true.

1217
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,880
So it's,
the whole thing is very,

1218
00:52:46,881 --> 00:52:48,560
very sorted in many,
many,

1219
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:50,240
many ways.
And you know,

1220
00:52:50,241 --> 00:52:53,600
Gary Johnson keeps fucking out.
I've had him on the podcast before and I

1221
00:52:53,601 --> 00:52:55,430
enjoyed them.
I liked talking to him,

1222
00:52:55,431 --> 00:53:00,130
but how do you not know what Aleppo is?
I didn't know where to Aleppo the way,

1223
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,050
but I knew what was going on in Syria,
but I didn't know the name of the city

1224
00:53:03,051 --> 00:53:04,220
that was getting bombed.
Sure.

1225
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,010
And of course,
look,

1226
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:08,810
the media is disingenuous when they,
when they find that Aleppo moment with

1227
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:12,230
Gary Johnson and suddenly that's the
lead story all over the place or for 24

1228
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,430
hours,
it's all over twitter cause it's like

1229
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:17,930
you guys ignored everything he says.
So now he screwed up once and now that's

1230
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:20,890
the way you discredit him.
So I've had Gary Johnson on my show,

1231
00:53:20,891 --> 00:53:23,000
so I chatted with him.
Uh,

1232
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:24,950
he was going on Larry King when I was
over at or,

1233
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:26,280
and we had about a half hour before

1234
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,190
we went on air in the green room.
The guy is,

1235
00:53:28,230 --> 00:53:31,290
he's a perfectly decent,
lovely human being.

1236
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,020
He's not dumb.
He is a nice guy.

1237
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:36,120
I would,
I would love to smoke pot with them and

1238
00:53:36,121 --> 00:53:37,440
go skiing.
But like,

1239
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:40,620
but like,
but that said in August,

1240
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:42,450
I did a video on my channel where I
said,

1241
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:45,420
I will support this guy to get to 15% to
get him in the,

1242
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,210
in the debates because we,
whether you like him or not,

1243
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,930
we desperately need another voice.
Talk about limited government,

1244
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:56,100
talk about why uh,
taxes should be low or whatever it is.

1245
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,660
Now.
I failed at that.

1246
00:53:57,661 --> 00:54:01,260
Obviously I tried but from that point,
from about mid August to the debate,

1247
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:05,580
he had about 10 horrific moments.
Like I actually think as much as I like

1248
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,220
him personally,
he's done the libertarians,

1249
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:10,260
uh,
and in a certain way the country a major

1250
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:12,540
disservice by being so ill prepared for
this.

1251
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,950
So many people would have been excited
to have heard an actual imagine if there

1252
00:54:16,951 --> 00:54:20,040
was a libertarian right now obviously
he's not going to win like a Ross Perot

1253
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:22,830
type character,
Ross Perot type or just someone who had

1254
00:54:22,831 --> 00:54:24,840
a certain command of the issues because
Gary,

1255
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,760
he's googling all of the reasons that we
like him,

1256
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:28,930
but he's kind of goofy and silly and you
know,

1257
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,010
he stammers a lot and he speaks in a
funny way in his body.

1258
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:33,960
Language is kind of,
you know,

1259
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:37,290
slide in a slippery or I dunno,
but the point is,

1260
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,950
this was the year if there were,
if we're ever going to have a third

1261
00:54:40,951 --> 00:54:41,850
party,
a third choice,

1262
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:44,190
something like that.
This was the year where it could have

1263
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:48,510
made a real dent the way Ross Perot did.
And Gary could have,

1264
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,760
it should have been the libertarian
candidate more than,

1265
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:51,571
uh,
Jill Stein,

1266
00:54:51,571 --> 00:54:52,230
I think.

1267
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,230
But Gary just at every opportunity to
show that he knows what he's doing can,

1268
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,360
can speak clearly about the issues he
failed.

1269
00:55:00,361 --> 00:55:01,170
You know,
he's not,

1270
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:04,350
he's for having the government forced
the India,

1271
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:05,520
Indiana,
uh,

1272
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,200
Baker to bake the cake.
Did you not?

1273
00:55:07,201 --> 00:55:09,630
He's a libertarian.
So a lot of these,

1274
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,180
forcing them to bake a cake.
Yeah.

1275
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,370
So,
so he isn't even a great,

1276
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:15,720
but I even said this in my video.
I said,

1277
00:55:15,721 --> 00:55:17,250
look,
the guy's not a great libertarian.

1278
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,050
I don't think he's a great candidate.
He was a republican and he wouldn't get

1279
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,290
in New Mexico.
He was a republican and he was a good

1280
00:55:22,291 --> 00:55:23,820
two term governor.
Bill Weld,

1281
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:24,320
by the way.
Yeah.

1282
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,430
This is running mate,
who's the former governor of

1283
00:55:26,431 --> 00:55:27,360
Massachusetts.
Yeah.

1284
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,060
So if they're both decent fellows,
you know what I mean?

1285
00:55:30,061 --> 00:55:32,640
They're both decent fellows and maybe
that's just not what makes you the

1286
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:33,150
president.

1287
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,460
But this was,
they missed a huge opportunity.

1288
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:40,610
Imagine if there just been a well-spoken
libertarian who could just have elicited

1289
00:55:41,701 --> 00:55:45,960
what the points of libertarianism is.
I think it would look,

1290
00:55:45,961 --> 00:55:49,280
it's not going to flip the election,
but it could have done something and,

1291
00:55:49,281 --> 00:55:51,780
and I think he was the wrong guy.
It's a dirty business,

1292
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,340
you know?
And that's one of the reasons why

1293
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:55,710
Hillary Clinton is good at it.
She's a dirty person.

1294
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:59,370
Yeah,
I mean I say that with no ill will.

1295
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,510
I mean I don't hate that lady.
What she does is dirty.

1296
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:06,450
And if you look at what the DNC did to
Bernie Sanders,

1297
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,540
that's dirty and what she did,
as soon as that woman got fired from the

1298
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:11,610
DNC,
she hires her immediately.

1299
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,600
I mean it's so incredibly transparent.
So think how corrupt really how corrupt

1300
00:56:15,601 --> 00:56:17,520
this is.
And this is again why I talk about the

1301
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:21,060
left a lot because they need to call out
their side.

1302
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,070
We will be very,
it would be very easy for us,

1303
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:26,590
for us to sit here and just mock the
right the whole time and we can get

1304
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,340
further into trump and mock the shit out
him and talk about problem is,

1305
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,360
I don't believe in a left and a right.
No,

1306
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:34,420
I don't either,
but I'm just within the way we have to

1307
00:56:34,421 --> 00:56:36,250
sort of frame the discussions,
you know what I mean?

1308
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:36,551
Like,
yeah,

1309
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,980
the labels,
they're all ridiculous at this point.

1310
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:43,210
But think about how corrupt the DNC is.
Debbie Wasserman Schultz was the head of

1311
00:56:43,211 --> 00:56:46,300
the DNC.
They find out she's rigging it for

1312
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:48,820
Hillary.
She steps down in shame,

1313
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,010
literally the same day or the next day.
She,

1314
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:55,090
then we'll start same day she starts
working for the Hillary campaign.

1315
00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:56,860
Then Donna Brazil,
who's a,

1316
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:59,290
who's a democratic super delegate,
right?

1317
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,400
She's a democratic,
super dope.

1318
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:04,810
Who CNN had on is a contributor as if
she could possibly give you any,

1319
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:05,801
uh,
you know,

1320
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:08,170
remotely honest answer on anything.

1321
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:13,270
She then becomes the head of the DNC and
then now it's of course come out on Wiki

1322
00:57:13,271 --> 00:57:16,600
leaks in the last week that she was
feeding Hillary questions for the

1323
00:57:16,601 --> 00:57:19,750
debates so it,
so you may hate the Republicans for all

1324
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,430
the,
all your fans out there that hate the

1325
00:57:21,431 --> 00:57:23,980
Republicans.
You still got to acknowledge that there

1326
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:27,420
is something deeply,
deeply corrupt with the Democrats and

1327
00:57:27,421 --> 00:57:29,440
Hillary.
Hillary's the head of that simply simply

1328
00:57:29,441 --> 00:57:33,220
put deeply corrupt against Bernie
Sanders who's also a democrat.

1329
00:57:33,221 --> 00:57:37,930
It's like what?
What Hillary Clinton is is a hustler and

1330
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:40,360
she knows how to put it all together and
she's got,

1331
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,730
and the both of the Clintons,
they're hustlers,

1332
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:45,270
they keep these people close to them and
they,

1333
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,400
they make sure that everyone is taken
care of.

1334
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:52,260
Whether it's people from other countries
that donate money to the Clinton can

1335
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:54,760
foundation,
whether it's all these different people,

1336
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,210
like when you know,
when she hired that woman for her

1337
00:57:58,211 --> 00:58:01,720
campaign,
that's not unusual like standard

1338
00:58:01,721 --> 00:58:04,660
operational procedure for the Clinton
campaign.

1339
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:07,180
It's like how she's conducted business
and it's,

1340
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:09,910
that's what we don't like about
politics.

1341
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:14,740
What we don't like about politics is the
cronyism and the established roots that

1342
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:17,290
they have developed over 30 plus years
in government.

1343
00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:20,230
So that's what's happening right now is
that because of wikileaks,

1344
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:22,510
we're starting to see how the sausage is
made.

1345
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:25,670
It's not just a theory anymore.
So for the last couple of years where,

1346
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,390
where a lot of online people would be
screaming about the government's

1347
00:58:28,391 --> 00:58:29,890
corrupt,
the media is in bed with them,

1348
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:30,680
you know,
they,

1349
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:33,640
they are pitching softball interview.
So well now we're seeing that it's

1350
00:58:33,641 --> 00:58:36,610
actually true.
Like there's actual evidence in email

1351
00:58:36,611 --> 00:58:39,250
saying yeah,
give softball stories too easy.

1352
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:42,190
Reporters at the New York Times don't
talk to this person,

1353
00:58:42,191 --> 00:58:43,024
you know,
Blah Blah Blah.

1354
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,180
We're seeing all of it now and it's
coming to a head and then you throw

1355
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:49,960
trump into it and you throw trolling and
internet culture and you get all of that

1356
00:58:49,961 --> 00:58:50,290
going.

1357
00:58:50,290 --> 00:58:55,270
And back to that popcorn that we started
with now it's all bubbling at once and

1358
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,550
you know,
it all comes down to tomorrow.

1359
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,440
And I also think there's waves of this
stuff.

1360
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:03,220
There's waves of outrage and then the
people sort of get resigned to it all

1361
00:59:03,221 --> 00:59:06,070
because they get their own life calls.
You know,

1362
00:59:06,071 --> 00:59:09,940
like if you really wanted to delve deep
into the Clintons or delve deep into

1363
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:14,970
trump and just that would absorb every
second of your day for decades really,

1364
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:19,120
really would with both of those guys.
And you've got to live and it's always

1365
00:59:19,121 --> 00:59:21,030
been like that.
Do you remember Jeff Gannon?

1366
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:21,980
Do you remember who he is?

1367
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:25,460
It sounds familiar.
Gimme a little shop again and was a

1368
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:30,530
embedded reporter in the White House who
actually spent time sleeping at the

1369
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:32,300
White House.
He had slept in the White House and more

1370
00:59:32,301 --> 00:59:34,460
than one occasion,
and this was during the Bush

1371
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:37,490
administration,
and he would ask the most ridiculous

1372
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,560
questions that you would never think
that a reporter would ask.

1373
00:59:39,561 --> 00:59:40,520
Like,
uh,

1374
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,810
like mister president,
when are the Democrats going to wake up

1375
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,360
and come to their senses?
It's like those kind of questions,

1376
00:59:47,361 --> 00:59:50,780
like just completely ridiculous leading
questions.

1377
00:59:51,050 --> 00:59:52,370
Complete softballs.
Yeah.

1378
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:54,740
Well,
it turned out that he,

1379
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:57,740
this is like when the Internet was just
starting to emerge,

1380
00:59:57,741 --> 00:59:59,120
right?
It was during the Bush administration.

1381
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:04,450
It turned out that he was a gay escort
and he ran an all military gay escort

1382
01:00:05,601 --> 01:00:10,520
service any more like fucking dog tags
and a towel over his dick.

1383
01:00:10,521 --> 01:00:13,440
And he was straddled on the ground with
combat boots on his,

1384
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:16,880
in his online ad that I've seen him at
24 hour fitness.

1385
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:20,570
And he's the manager that's the guy with
the mop.

1386
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:24,020
So they realize that this fucking guy
was,

1387
01:00:24,021 --> 01:00:27,100
I mean this was how they got,
I mean,

1388
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:31,280
this is how they got the questions that
they want to be asked and presented the,

1389
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,560
you know,
the narrative that they wanted to push.

1390
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,040
But this has always been the case.
He's always been ridiculous.

1391
01:00:37,041 --> 01:00:42,041
People who are almost like vampire
familiars who stay close to the master

1392
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,560
and so they want to,
you know,

1393
01:00:45,561 --> 01:00:49,580
in one way or another,
feed off of whatever power that he has

1394
01:00:49,581 --> 01:00:50,930
and,
and capitalize on it,

1395
01:00:50,931 --> 01:00:52,880
whether it's Debbie Wasserman Schultz,
whether it's,

1396
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,920
you know,
what does a woman's name that's the

1397
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:58,070
attorney general that Clinton met on the
tarmac and his jet.

1398
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,450
Oh,
a lynch.

1399
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,760
Loretta Lynch.
That story.

1400
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:04,640
It's fucking insane.
They had a private meeting.

1401
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:06,830
I mean,
trump's been hitting that over the head

1402
01:01:06,831 --> 01:01:08,690
and he's actually,
every time he says it,

1403
01:01:08,691 --> 01:01:09,021
I'm like,
yeah,

1404
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:09,470
wait a minute.

1405
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:12,230
They had a meeting in the plane for a
couple minutes right before the

1406
01:01:12,231 --> 01:01:13,430
indictment didn't happen.
Like,

1407
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,290
well,
that's why people like Scott Adams,

1408
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,470
who was a very reasonable guy.
He's coming on soon.

1409
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:19,770
He's great.
He will.

1410
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:22,010
A little bit of what I said before about
the trump tactics,

1411
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,160
he came on my show and he laid it out so
clearly,

1412
01:01:25,161 --> 01:01:25,941
and he at,
at that point,

1413
01:01:25,941 --> 01:01:28,040
he wasn't supporting trump really,
and I think,

1414
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,680
I think he,
I think now he officially his,

1415
01:01:30,681 --> 01:01:34,160
but his whole point was,
it's not the policy.

1416
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,470
Understand what he's doing,
the trolling,

1417
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:40,070
understand the leading that he does and
then comes in after all of that.

1418
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,240
He fully gets it.
You're,

1419
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:42,620
you're going to love talking to them.
Yeah.

1420
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:45,560
I mean,
I feel like what trump represents to a

1421
01:01:45,561 --> 01:01:47,870
lot of people that are supporting him is
they'll,

1422
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,190
they're willing to look past all of his
flaws and all the bullshit and the

1423
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:57,191
bullying and the craziness because he's
something completely unique that has

1424
01:01:57,561 --> 01:01:59,950
never run for president before.
What he is he,

1425
01:01:59,951 --> 01:02:04,951
what he represents is a guy who has been
inside but is also outside.

1426
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:10,550
He is independent in terms of
financially and he's also independent in

1427
01:02:10,911 --> 01:02:14,120
terms of his connections and his
obligations to them.

1428
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:17,420
One of the things about him being a
narcissist and one the things about him

1429
01:02:17,421 --> 01:02:20,490
being a guy who probably have a whole
lot of friends

1430
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,940
is that in establishing that and
becoming the super successful guy who's

1431
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:30,330
really concerned only about himself,
he's immune to all that cronyism

1432
01:02:30,331 --> 01:02:32,880
bullshit.
He's not going to do that and you're

1433
01:02:32,881 --> 01:02:36,360
seeing that like the way he's hammering
hillary on all these different things,

1434
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:40,590
the way he's attacking,
I mean he got paid to be at Hillary's

1435
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:44,550
fucking wedding or hillary rather got
paid to be at his wedding.

1436
01:02:44,850 --> 01:02:49,380
He paid
her donation for her to show up at his

1437
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:51,440
wedding or fucked it up.
Um,

1438
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,580
I mean,
this is a guy that's been deeply

1439
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:54,900
embedded in,
in,

1440
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,300
in politics,
but to his credit then he points that

1441
01:02:57,301 --> 01:02:57,721
out.
I mean,

1442
01:02:57,721 --> 01:03:00,870
in the first debate,
the first republican debate,

1443
01:03:00,871 --> 01:03:02,790
what was,
he said it within the first 10 minutes.

1444
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:03,510
Yeah,
yeah.

1445
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:06,000
I gave her money and she showed up to my
wedding.

1446
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,610
That's how corrupt the system is.
So you're totally right.

1447
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:11,760
What's happening is people are,
they're so frustrated,

1448
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:15,090
they're frustrated about language and
all the bullshit and seeing all the

1449
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:19,080
nonsense between the media and the White
House correspondence dinner where,

1450
01:03:19,081 --> 01:03:20,880
you know,
they call it nerd prom and all the,

1451
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,700
they're supposed to be guarding the
politicians and instead they're having

1452
01:03:23,701 --> 01:03:26,040
dinner with them.
And we could go through the list of the

1453
01:03:26,041 --> 01:03:29,460
amount of people that are on CNN that
are married to public.

1454
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:31,170
People are work for campaigns.
You know,

1455
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,850
I just mentioned the Donna Brazil thing.
There's a good Jew,

1456
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,120
Paul Begala for example,
he runs a hillary SUPERPAC.

1457
01:03:36,121 --> 01:03:38,620
He's on CNN as an analyst like this
show,

1458
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,220
everyone is now seeing it.
There was the idea of it.

1459
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,520
But now because of the Internet,
we're seeing all of it and people have

1460
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,450
just had it.
Think about it.

1461
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,850
Everyone wants to be close to power in a
certain way.

1462
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:51,150
So if you had a,
if you had Barack Obama,

1463
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:55,770
you're the president in here,
you can probably in your first interview

1464
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:57,930
with him,
the first time you met him might go a

1465
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:01,230
little easier hoping that he might come
back again because you'd like to be

1466
01:04:01,231 --> 01:04:03,000
around it a little.
Not Man Dude,

1467
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:04,710
I hope,
I hope not.

1468
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:07,630
You go hard.
I would show up drunk and high and I had

1469
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:09,960
to go like let's kill it says do this
man.

1470
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,030
Let's just do this.
I want to know what's up.

1471
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:14,910
But he gets a chance to give you the
president.

1472
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:15,550
Look,
can,

1473
01:04:15,550 --> 01:04:18,150
I don't want to be president,
but likely there would be like some

1474
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:19,710
serious consequences if I didn't do
that.

1475
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:20,520
Right.
So,

1476
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,220
so that's the real concern.
So there's two things.

1477
01:04:23,221 --> 01:04:26,880
There's one is that he won't do.
If you ask if you are going to demand a

1478
01:04:26,881 --> 01:04:29,130
really hard interview,
I mean a really,

1479
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:29,790
really high degree.

1480
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:33,600
They'd be a hard interview.
What I would do if I had a chance to sit

1481
01:04:33,601 --> 01:04:36,150
down with Barack Obama because he's not
much older than me.

1482
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,530
Yeah.
He's only a couple of years older than

1483
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:39,060
me,
like I had essentially could hang out

1484
01:04:39,061 --> 01:04:41,490
with that guy.
I think in a lot of ways,

1485
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:45,950
let's forget about what he's done and
the drones and the attacks on whistle

1486
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:48,270
blowers and the attacks on the freedom
of the press.

1487
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:50,550
There's been a lot of horrible things
that have occurred during this

1488
01:04:50,551 --> 01:04:52,500
administration.
It's been one of the wars

1489
01:04:52,501 --> 01:04:55,020
administrations in terms of freedom of
the press.

1490
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:57,420
It's not,
that doesn't seem to say much about

1491
01:04:57,421 --> 01:04:58,350
that.
Not at all,

1492
01:04:58,570 --> 01:04:59,940
cause it's,
it's bullshit.

1493
01:04:59,970 --> 01:05:01,860
That's why I don't believe in this left
and right thing.

1494
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,510
It's like the raiders versus the
dolphins.

1495
01:05:03,511 --> 01:05:05,550
You pick a team and your team can do no
wrong.

1496
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,490
Yeah.
What I would talk to him about is what

1497
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:12,330
does it like being a human being under
that immense amount of pressure.

1498
01:05:12,331 --> 01:05:14,460
And is that job even manageable?
Is it,

1499
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:18,190
is it possible for one person to really
be for 300

1500
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:19,870
and whatever million people there are
here?

1501
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,330
Yeah.
Well that's right,

1502
01:05:22,570 --> 01:05:24,010
but that,
but that's donald trump's got to put it

1503
01:05:24,011 --> 01:05:26,650
into that.
People think we're voting for a cane.

1504
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:27,940
They don't realize that,
you know,

1505
01:05:27,941 --> 01:05:30,910
there's simple civics things that people
need to know that they don't know

1506
01:05:30,911 --> 01:05:32,050
anywhere.
Stuff that you should have learned in

1507
01:05:32,051 --> 01:05:35,020
seventh grade social studies that we
have three branches of government.

1508
01:05:35,021 --> 01:05:37,990
The president is one branch,
he's the executive branch.

1509
01:05:37,991 --> 01:05:40,960
All he is supposed to do,
the president doesn't write laws,

1510
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:42,760
right?
All he is supposed to do is sign the

1511
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,730
law.
Congress writes the law that the

1512
01:05:44,731 --> 01:05:48,400
legislative branch and then the judicial
branch and the courts actually make sure

1513
01:05:48,401 --> 01:05:51,490
that they're legal and there's
separation of powers in a balance so

1514
01:05:51,491 --> 01:05:52,241
that they can,
you know,

1515
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:55,000
checks and balances.
So they make sure no branch gets too

1516
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:56,440
powerful.
But if you think about it,

1517
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,780
think about what the last two years have
been like for this election.

1518
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,630
People think we're voting on a king.
So Hillary,

1519
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,460
I can solve this and all that.
And it's like,

1520
01:06:03,461 --> 01:06:05,050
wait a minute.
If you can do all these shit,

1521
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:07,300
why didn't you tell brock these last
eight years?

1522
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,880
I'll bring all the jobs back.
Well,

1523
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,230
you were on his team,
so maybe you should have mentioned that.

1524
01:06:11,231 --> 01:06:12,610
So you know,
that's all bullshit.

1525
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:15,600
And then when trump says,
I'm the only one that can solve

1526
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:17,050
immigration,
I'm the only one that can make the

1527
01:06:17,051 --> 01:06:17,791
economy grading.
I know.

1528
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:19,120
It's like,
well,

1529
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,830
you're just a part of the government.
I get it.

1530
01:06:20,831 --> 01:06:24,250
You're a big part.
And we fetishize the president in a way

1531
01:06:24,251 --> 01:06:26,380
that we don't the other branches,
which is a problem.

1532
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:28,480
Um,
but they're,

1533
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:31,270
they're not a king.
And we have to remind ourselves of that.

1534
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,880
And for the people that are really ready
to jump off the bridge tomorrow if

1535
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:37,030
they're a guy loses or gal or,
or Gal.

1536
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,470
Uh,
for those people,

1537
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,520
the hope is that the system is,
can be stronger than either one of these

1538
01:06:42,521 --> 01:06:43,510
two people.
You Ha if,

1539
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,040
if,
if we're not at that point,

1540
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,040
then we're really in trouble.
You already established so that the

1541
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:50,150
system itself is just,
yeah,

1542
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:52,150
it's just busted.
It's just busted.

1543
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:54,460
But that's why they're voting trump.
And that's the thing,

1544
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,800
that's the thing with trump.
If you think about trump,

1545
01:06:57,070 --> 01:06:59,710
what of progressive hated all these
years,

1546
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,510
they hate Christian conservatives.
Well guess what?

1547
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:04,630
Trump's not a Christian conservative.
He doesn't give a fuck he had,

1548
01:07:04,631 --> 01:07:07,330
they're all supporting him.
I've oddly at the highest numbers,

1549
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,790
but he doesn't care about that.
Do you think trump really cares about

1550
01:07:09,791 --> 01:07:11,530
abortion?
He's an old school pussy grabber.

1551
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,320
Exactly right.
He's an old school pussy grabber.

1552
01:07:15,321 --> 01:07:18,490
O.
S.

1553
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:20,120
P.
He doesn't care about abortion each

1554
01:07:20,150 --> 01:07:22,690
Jesus tee shirt.
There you go.

1555
01:07:22,691 --> 01:07:23,524
You can have that one.

1556
01:07:23,950 --> 01:07:26,650
But he doesn't care about abortion.
He doesn't care about gay rights.

1557
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:28,010
I think about it.
He gave the,

1558
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:31,000
the,
at the RNC at the convention,

1559
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:33,370
he talked about gay rights.
It got out of pause,

1560
01:07:33,371 --> 01:07:35,260
break.
He brought Peter Teal up there to talk

1561
01:07:35,261 --> 01:07:37,000
about being openly gay and they loved
him.

1562
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,790
I mean,
so it's a lot of ways stablish that

1563
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:44,560
Hillary Clinton was anti gay marriage
until 2013 when it became convenient.

1564
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:47,740
She is on record many,
many times of saying that she believes

1565
01:07:47,741 --> 01:07:49,390
in a marriage between a man and a woman.
Yeah.

1566
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:52,090
But that's what just incredibly
regressive of,

1567
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:53,650
well that's what they all do.
They wait now,

1568
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:55,480
even Obama,
it's like he waited,

1569
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:56,830
waited,
waited until Obama,

1570
01:07:57,340 --> 01:07:58,173
Obama.

1571
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:03,040
Um,
but even Obama didn't do it until Biden

1572
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:04,960
was on meet the press and he like kind
of slipped.

1573
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:06,670
And then the next day Obama was like,
me too,

1574
01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:09,220
you know,
saying Mo Bama,

1575
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,230
Michelle Obama,
she ran,

1576
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:14,140
she could probably fucking,
when you want to talk about a woman who

1577
01:08:14,141 --> 01:08:19,141
has been in the White House who has
shown an incredible resolve at her,

1578
01:08:19,310 --> 01:08:21,680
the way she speaks,
she's,

1579
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:24,950
she's like a very intelligent,
very articulate,

1580
01:08:24,951 --> 01:08:27,830
very composed person.
I think she could win.

1581
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,090
Well,
what does it tell you though,

1582
01:08:29,091 --> 01:08:31,100
that I have heard than Hillary?
How about that?

1583
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,010
Yeah.
I would probably rather have 100% yeah,

1584
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,790
100% so I don't know.
I don't even know what she thinks it,

1585
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:41,600
but he'll,
being a president is,

1586
01:08:41,690 --> 01:08:42,523
ah,
I'm here.

1587
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,980
I'm sitting here talking about I don't,
I just know she's not as compromised.

1588
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:49,880
Maybe she would be if she got that job.
So is that ultimately where we're at is

1589
01:08:49,881 --> 01:08:54,410
that the system is so corrupt that all
they could choke out all the two years

1590
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:57,290
of this bullshit could give us at the
end was these two.

1591
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,650
Like I kind of think they just,
they perfectly deserve each other,

1592
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,900
but if you want to look and find out
what went wrong,

1593
01:09:02,901 --> 01:09:05,690
you got to look in the mirror because we
all have to look at ourselves and say,

1594
01:09:05,691 --> 01:09:09,350
how did we all allow this to happen?
It was a joke at first.

1595
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:11,300
The trump thing was a joke.
I mean,

1596
01:09:11,301 --> 01:09:13,730
I'll fully own up.
I remember when he first got in,

1597
01:09:13,731 --> 01:09:15,560
I said he's going to be in three debates
and that's it.

1598
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:18,530
And he was definitely in three debates.
He was,

1599
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:20,540
yeah.
And then he stayed for the fourth and I

1600
01:09:20,541 --> 01:09:21,374
went,
Oh shit,

1601
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:25,070
he's better at talking to those people.
He's used to being on camera and he's

1602
01:09:25,071 --> 01:09:28,160
used to insulting people.
Like when Marco Rubio tried to insult

1603
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:29,120
him,
he was terrible.

1604
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:30,500
Oh my God.
He's like,

1605
01:09:30,501 --> 01:09:32,780
he's not good at that.
Like that's not something you just pick

1606
01:09:32,781 --> 01:09:33,320
up on.

1607
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:37,110
It was like watching an open mic comic
half to like headline the biggest show

1608
01:09:37,111 --> 01:09:37,944
of their life.
You know,

1609
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:40,310
he just couldn't get the words out
properly.

1610
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,360
But,
but to that point maybe so far for all

1611
01:09:44,361 --> 01:09:47,390
the things that we're talking about,
it seems to me that trump,

1612
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:50,960
the best sales job I could give her a
trump would be that he has a lot,

1613
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,480
his family has a lot,
they have everything to live for.

1614
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:54,870
They have everything that most of us
want,

1615
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,530
material assets and what all of that
stuff.

1616
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,390
And it's like,
is he really people that are like,

1617
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:01,010
he's going to start world war three or
you know,

1618
01:10:01,011 --> 01:10:03,680
we're going to fight North Korea are.
But isn't that a real concern though

1619
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:08,060
that with his hubris and the way he
treats opponents in business and the way

1620
01:10:08,061 --> 01:10:11,150
he treats opponents socially,
like Rosie O'donnell,

1621
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:16,460
I go the way he does sort of conduct
himself that that is not something that

1622
01:10:17,241 --> 01:10:20,180
you can do if you want to talk to some
foreign leader.

1623
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:22,370
Absolutely.
It's a con for sure.

1624
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:24,020
I,
so I'm not diminishing that.

1625
01:10:24,021 --> 01:10:25,370
We don't,
as I say on the show with him,

1626
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,480
I don't know what his moral center is,
you know?

1627
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:32,090
I just have no sense of is this really
all about him or is this,

1628
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,510
does he really feel does like in the
truest moment of him,

1629
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:40,520
does he feel that the country really has
been derailed and is he just using the

1630
01:10:40,521 --> 01:10:44,660
trolling tactics to just get something
good out of it?

1631
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:46,520
My point is that,
that he has,

1632
01:10:46,570 --> 01:10:50,090
well I was saying he has a lot to lose
and it's like maybe he,

1633
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:53,930
this is the moment where he finally like
came around and was like,

1634
01:10:53,931 --> 01:10:56,270
I have no one's going to stop this
bullshit,

1635
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,030
this corrupt,
all this awful shit that you're talking

1636
01:10:59,031 --> 01:11:00,680
about with Hillary.
And maybe he's like,

1637
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,620
I'm the only one that can do it.
That's,

1638
01:11:02,650 --> 01:11:04,910
that's the best way I can frame it.
I'm not telling you that's,

1639
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:08,380
that's,
that's a really fantasy based view of it

1640
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,790
though.
It's not based on his actual words,

1641
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,400
but it's impossible to base any of
those.

1642
01:11:13,401 --> 01:11:13,990
So.
Right.

1643
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,570
So how do we base any of this on their
words?

1644
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:17,820
We know that is lying left and right.
You know what I mean?

1645
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,320
Well,
if you've seen the thing,

1646
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:23,010
the difference between the s the FBI
director giving the description of what

1647
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:26,760
Hillary did and then her saying what the
FBI had said.

1648
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:29,610
Yeah,
and I mean it is so horrifically

1649
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,700
inaccurate and dishonest.
This is like,

1650
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:35,760
how does that not immediately disqualify
you in any other time?

1651
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:37,680
It would because she was running
against,

1652
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,710
let's put it this way,
if she was running against Obama and

1653
01:11:40,711 --> 01:11:41,760
these things,
and this is,

1654
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:44,130
this was the Hillary Clinton that we had
been exposed to.

1655
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,040
It's like our standards have dropped so
low,

1656
01:11:47,130 --> 01:11:49,620
but the media would have been all over
her because they liked Obama.

1657
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:52,950
So that's what's happened here.
Trump has been the great unifier to take

1658
01:11:52,951 --> 01:11:55,290
all of these people,
progressives and liberals,

1659
01:11:55,291 --> 01:11:56,630
and we'll all these people and even,
you know,

1660
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,470
the never trump conservatives,
all these people,

1661
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:00,720
they're all unified in just their hatred
of trump.

1662
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,570
And then that gets them to ignore all
the horrible shit about Hillary.

1663
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:05,520
So like the stuff with the emails,
when she,

1664
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:07,500
when the guy basically call me,
came out and he was like,

1665
01:12:07,501 --> 01:12:09,270
well,
it wasn't negligent with sort of,

1666
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,950
he was like,
she's basically an idiot.

1667
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:13,140
She didn't know what she was doing,
but it wasn't negligent.

1668
01:12:13,141 --> 01:12:16,260
Well,
that's grounds to be fired at most jobs

1669
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,780
if you're,
you can't screw up something really,

1670
01:12:18,781 --> 01:12:19,980
really important and say,
well,

1671
01:12:19,981 --> 01:12:22,250
I didn't do it in purpose.
I'm just an idiot who's not.

1672
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:25,470
Not,
not even that it's illegal and illegal.

1673
01:12:25,471 --> 01:12:26,860
Who would go to jail?
Right.

1674
01:12:26,861 --> 01:12:28,860
What everything she did,
if she was a sailor,

1675
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:31,170
you know,
you know the story about the,

1676
01:12:31,390 --> 01:12:34,930
the,
the naval officer who took photos and

1677
01:12:34,940 --> 01:12:36,650
I'm not,
it wasn't even an officer as an enlisted

1678
01:12:36,651 --> 01:12:39,450
guy who took photos of the inside of a
nuclear cockpit.

1679
01:12:39,740 --> 01:12:42,570
He's facing 10 years in jail.
Just took photos on his phone.

1680
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,980
Top secret shit.
Well,

1681
01:12:43,981 --> 01:12:46,830
did you see this in last two days that
hillary was having her cleaning lady

1682
01:12:46,831 --> 01:12:49,320
print emails?
Classified emails there.

1683
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,930
Wikileaks is showing things where she's
saying have her print it,

1684
01:12:51,931 --> 01:12:54,030
have her print deal.
She'll over Anthony Wiener thing that

1685
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:54,870
she had.
Huma,

1686
01:12:54,990 --> 01:12:59,370
huma forwarded her fucking classified
emails to Anthony Wiener's account and

1687
01:12:59,371 --> 01:13:03,420
then printed them up because I guess his
computer was hooked up to the fucking

1688
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,550
printer in the house so he could print
his dick pics.

1689
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,390
Right.
So then,

1690
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:09,300
well he was he printing them?
Where do you send them once you find the

1691
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,580
large,
I'm otherwise you get no traction.

1692
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:15,750
You can't send actual size dick pics.
Say ask you this before we get any

1693
01:13:15,751 --> 01:13:18,780
further,
what do you want?

1694
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:23,550
Either one of them to win and if you do
you have a preference or a you like Iti,

1695
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:25,590
want to step back and watch this nuclear
explosion.

1696
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:28,050
Go off and see what happens.
None of those three options.

1697
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,650
I don't want this thing to blow up.
You know,

1698
01:13:29,651 --> 01:13:30,930
one of,
one of the things I say on the show all

1699
01:13:30,931 --> 01:13:34,680
the time is that our country is still so
good and we don't realize it.

1700
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:37,950
We think that it's just this endless
fighting and this awfulness.

1701
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:39,870
There's so much good here.
You wake up.

1702
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,750
I know we're a little,
we're a little different as as public

1703
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,820
people,
but the average person wakes up here.

1704
01:13:44,821 --> 01:13:46,830
They can say what they want to say.
For the most part,

1705
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,830
you can say what you want to say.
You can get a decent job.

1706
01:13:49,831 --> 01:13:52,890
For the most part,
where we go to New York City and go on a

1707
01:13:52,891 --> 01:13:57,030
subway and be with literally every
single person from every part of the

1708
01:13:57,031 --> 01:13:58,140
world,
from every,

1709
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,810
every ethnicity and nationality and
religion and race and sexuality,

1710
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,730
and we're all here and we're not killing
each other.

1711
01:14:02,731 --> 01:14:05,190
That doesn't mean that we could do a lot
better.

1712
01:14:05,191 --> 01:14:06,870
It doesn't mean that the system's
broken.

1713
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:09,240
It doesn't,
but it's still pretty damn good here.

1714
01:14:09,270 --> 01:14:11,380
Almost everyone in the world still wants
to come here.

1715
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:11,980
We don't.

1716
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,600
How many of your friends are leaving
America?

1717
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:15,340
I know Lena Dunham's going to leave.
That will be all right.

1718
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:17,140
She's going,
if trump wins,

1719
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:18,360
you know,
like she said that yeah,

1720
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:22,300
she'd going to Mexico or Canada.
He's got a lot of problems of her own.

1721
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,960
Yeah,
right.

1722
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,300
Let's not waste that.
He,

1723
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:26,680
so I was at her butt,
but,

1724
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:29,320
so my,
my overriding point would be I don't

1725
01:14:29,321 --> 01:14:32,740
want to blow the system up to that level
where it's really like,

1726
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:34,880
yeah,
cause I didn't say,

1727
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:37,190
I didn't mean like watch this nuclear
explosion go off.

1728
01:14:37,191 --> 01:14:41,150
I'm at an event like this isn't a
tomorrow's and event and we're going to

1729
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:43,460
sit back and watch how this event plays
out.

1730
01:14:43,461 --> 01:14:44,630
Who are you?
What do you want to say?

1731
01:14:44,631 --> 01:14:44,860
Who you are

1732
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:46,320
voting for him?
So look,

1733
01:14:46,321 --> 01:14:47,430
we're,
we're in California,

1734
01:14:47,431 --> 01:14:48,840
so,
so I haven't said this publicly.

1735
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:50,700
I figured I would sort of wait until
today.

1736
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,700
So we're in California here.
So we know Hillary's Wayne in

1737
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:56,160
California.
So the two of us have a little bit of a

1738
01:14:56,161 --> 01:15:00,170
luxury to do something that might be
more principled than what that

1739
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:01,513
independent,
yeah.

1740
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,860
Then what the average person,
if you're in Ohio or you're in Florida

1741
01:15:04,861 --> 01:15:06,600
or Colorado or whatever your,
your votes,

1742
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:09,360
Matt,
literally every single person's vote

1743
01:15:09,361 --> 01:15:13,740
match highlights how fucking goofy this
system is so completely does.

1744
01:15:13,741 --> 01:15:15,570
Right.
And I now there are people that trading

1745
01:15:15,571 --> 01:15:17,730
votes over state lines and all kinds of
crazy things.

1746
01:15:17,731 --> 01:15:20,520
Look,
my biggest thing this time is that the

1747
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:23,730
system is just mangled and we need more
voices.

1748
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:24,750
So I,
my,

1749
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:27,570
I'm not totally sure.
My gut feeling is I'm going to vote for

1750
01:15:27,571 --> 01:15:32,571
Gary Johnson for all the wrong reasons
because I just want somebody to realize

1751
01:15:32,671 --> 01:15:34,890
down the road that four years from now
we should have somebody else.

1752
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:40,130
But I think you can make equally strong
cases for trump and for Hillary and

1753
01:15:40,171 --> 01:15:42,580
equally wrong cases for both of them.
Yeah,

1754
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,070
because everything,
cause it's funny,

1755
01:15:44,071 --> 01:15:45,660
I don't,
I'll ask you the same question,

1756
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:47,250
but just from what we've talked about
here,

1757
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:52,700
my sense is you're going to vote for
Hillary in the most begrudging possible

1758
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,870
way.
I don't think I am.

1759
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,730
If I was going to vote for Hillary,

1760
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,610
so think about this,
I would have to,

1761
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:03,970
I would have to have a way that I could
justify supporting her.

1762
01:16:04,150 --> 01:16:07,240
Not just a way that I didn't feel like
trump should be the president.

1763
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:11,650
It's all in my mind for the system,
it's,

1764
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,221
it's,
it's,

1765
01:16:12,221 --> 01:16:16,930
it's far better if
it's not even done,

1766
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,720
it doesn't make sense.
I think.

1767
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:23,680
I definitely think my options are either
voting for Gary Johnson or writing

1768
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:26,630
someone in and I don't think Gary
Johnson should be pressing.

1769
01:16:26,631 --> 01:16:27,460
No,
I know.

1770
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:28,480
Look,
he's not going to be,

1771
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:29,960
so you can do that.
And clean coach,

1772
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,030
he was president.
Look,

1773
01:16:31,031 --> 01:16:34,120
the guy did a great job as a governor of
New Mexico and I mean,

1774
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:39,160
what would I find disagreeable about him
is so much different than what I found

1775
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,340
disagreeable about George Bush and
George Bush was president for eight

1776
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:44,800
years.
What I find disagreeable about him,

1777
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:47,020
like his only,
his lack of preparedness,

1778
01:16:47,021 --> 01:16:50,710
but I think he's a very disciplined guy.
I just don't think he prepared well

1779
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:53,110
enough about foreign policy and about a
lot of other issues.

1780
01:16:53,111 --> 01:16:56,500
And I also think the pressure of the
national media and the spotlight of that

1781
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,030
uniquely.
Yeah,

1782
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:01,420
the Gotcha.
Journalism is something unique that he

1783
01:17:01,421 --> 01:17:04,180
had not experienced before.
So I think how depressing

1784
01:17:04,180 --> 01:17:07,450
that is with everything going on here.
And for as much as you and I are in this

1785
01:17:07,451 --> 01:17:08,550
thing,
like in it in a,

1786
01:17:08,551 --> 01:17:12,590
in a public way that we're,
but we both may be will begrudgingly the

1787
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:15,410
day before the election kind of be like,
ad we're going to vote for the guy that

1788
01:17:15,411 --> 01:17:16,970
definitely can't win.
I mean,

1789
01:17:16,971 --> 01:17:21,140
think about the shit that you've just
said about Hillary that is seriously

1790
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:23,840
damning shit.
Really Damn Shit.

1791
01:17:23,841 --> 01:17:24,770
Now look,
Sam Harris,

1792
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,050
who is one of my heroes who I know
you've had on a zillion times and I've

1793
01:17:27,051 --> 01:17:29,780
had him on and he did the best sell job
he could on Hillary.

1794
01:17:29,781 --> 01:17:30,890
He's,
he's supporting her.

1795
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:32,870
And I think it just is not really,
well,

1796
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:36,330
it's mostly trump's of funny little
article about the,

1797
01:17:36,331 --> 01:17:37,400
the,
the war,

1798
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:40,160
you know,
to the best of two evils or I mean,

1799
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,410
not a whole article,
a whole podcast about it.

1800
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,290
Right.
And I think he makes some good points

1801
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:46,160
about that.
He,

1802
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:47,630
he absolutely does.
And look,

1803
01:17:47,631 --> 01:17:49,910
I hold him as high as I can hold
another,

1804
01:17:49,911 --> 01:17:51,770
another person.
Um,

1805
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:57,100
but I think that the,
maybe the best way this could go down is

1806
01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:59,600
that if you don't want the,
if you're really afraid of what could

1807
01:17:59,601 --> 01:18:00,434
happen with trump,
that,

1808
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:03,890
that it's just like the rules have just
changed forever and it just doesn't

1809
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:05,980
sound right that trump would be
president,

1810
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,430
United States,
this reality TV star.

1811
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:09,020
If you're really,
really afraid of that.

1812
01:18:09,230 --> 01:18:13,940
I think the best argument for Clinton
then would be that get her in the system

1813
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:18,941
basically keeps chugging along and then
good liberals and decent conservatives

1814
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:23,150
and Libertarians and the people that
really aren't on the fringes that are

1815
01:18:23,151 --> 01:18:25,100
dragging everybody apart.
You know what I mean?

1816
01:18:25,101 --> 01:18:28,100
Like the real regressive left people in
the real outright people.

1817
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,220
But everyone else kind of comes together
and says,

1818
01:18:31,221 --> 01:18:33,050
we're going to change things over the
next couple of years.

1819
01:18:33,051 --> 01:18:33,531
And I,
this is,

1820
01:18:33,531 --> 01:18:35,330
I'm giving you a real like kind of pie
in the sky.

1821
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:36,280
Like,
you know,

1822
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:39,430
let's try to spin this positively stuff
ABC after school special.

1823
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:41,150
Like that's really what I'm giving you
right now.

1824
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:43,820
Cause I got nothing left with one day to
go in this fucking thing.

1825
01:18:43,821 --> 01:18:46,250
But,
but that's what I would say is that it's

1826
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:47,990
become obvious to me over the course of
this,

1827
01:18:48,380 --> 01:18:52,940
the average conservative who I may
disagree with on taxes or abortion or

1828
01:18:52,941 --> 01:18:54,290
whatever,
they're not my enemy.

1829
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:56,060
They're not as a liberal,
they're not my enemy.

1830
01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:00,830
And we can find,
we have to find room to be okay with

1831
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:01,880
other people.
This,

1832
01:19:01,930 --> 01:19:05,480
all this whole election is just a result
of not being okay if demonizing

1833
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:07,040
everybody to the point that they're
evil.

1834
01:19:07,190 --> 01:19:10,040
And then what did we end up with?
We got this.

1835
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,400
So the best argument for Hillary I think
is let her have for years,

1836
01:19:13,430 --> 01:19:14,900
the whole thing is going to be scandal
written.

1837
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:19,490
No matter what she's going to.
This is about not letting people just do

1838
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:20,720
their own thing.
Like that's,

1839
01:19:20,750 --> 01:19:22,530
that's a big part of what this is.
What,

1840
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,720
what do you mean when you say,
explain,

1841
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:28,490
explain what you just said about the
whole reason why we're in this.

1842
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:32,270
We're in this position because we've got
cause over the last however long because

1843
01:19:32,271 --> 01:19:33,830
of cable news.
Because a twitter,

1844
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:36,410
because of all of that,
all everyone caters their news to

1845
01:19:36,411 --> 01:19:39,140
themselves and then demonizes everybody,
right?

1846
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:42,260
So everyone on the right will tell you
that they're all lived hard,

1847
01:19:42,261 --> 01:19:44,480
left socialist,
Marxist,

1848
01:19:44,481 --> 01:19:46,700
Blah Blah Blah.
And everyone on the left will tell you

1849
01:19:46,701 --> 01:19:49,190
that they're all racist white
supremacist Nazis.

1850
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:51,200
And it's like neither one of those
things are true.

1851
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,730
And,
and there could be,

1852
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:53,690
you know,
it's like when,

1853
01:19:53,691 --> 01:19:55,580
uh,
people argue about abortion and it's

1854
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:58,910
like everyone on the left will say that
the people on the right,

1855
01:19:58,911 --> 01:20:00,410
they're against abortion,
they hate women.

1856
01:20:00,411 --> 01:20:03,560
And people on the right,
we'll say that people on the left are

1857
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:05,180
for abortion.
So they hate babies.

1858
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:07,470
And guess what,
it's not really true either.

1859
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:08,220
One of those,

1860
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,400
you got to realize that we,
there's much more in common that we all

1861
01:20:11,401 --> 01:20:12,031
have.
I know,

1862
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,310
you know,
this is like obviously like that's not

1863
01:20:14,311 --> 01:20:17,400
rocket science and we have to realize
that people can have different political

1864
01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:20,130
opinions and that way you can still find
some room.

1865
01:20:20,131 --> 01:20:23,990
There is some place Democrats and
Republicans used to work together so

1866
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,540
well,
civility and just common,

1867
01:20:27,541 --> 01:20:32,340
the common bond of being American and
being so incredibly fortunate to be born

1868
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,650
on this awesome patch of dirt.
I mean that's,

1869
01:20:34,651 --> 01:20:37,170
that's really what we are.
We're the lottery winners when it comes

1870
01:20:37,171 --> 01:20:38,880
to the world and a lot of people
disagree.

1871
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,080
Fuck,
you kind of does better.

1872
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,160
And it was a lot of people,
but you know,

1873
01:20:42,210 --> 01:20:43,170
there be,
just ignore them.

1874
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,110
And I suppose that's where I would live.
I didn't live here.

1875
01:20:46,111 --> 01:20:48,450
I live in Canada or Australia.
Those are my two spots.

1876
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:50,720
Will Australia.
I've had a couple of Australians on

1877
01:20:50,730 --> 01:20:51,720
places.
The Shit,

1878
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:56,310
I fucking love us to get the ball.
I love the people over there.

1879
01:20:56,311 --> 01:20:58,600
It's such a fucking great place.
Yeah.

1880
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:02,760
I Melbourne is fucking fantastic.
Sydney is awesome sister.

1881
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:05,400
I enjoy it.
So they have their problems too.

1882
01:21:05,401 --> 01:21:07,880
But yeah,
I had read up and [inaudible],

1883
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,690
who's a writer for the Herald Sun in
Australia,

1884
01:21:09,691 --> 01:21:10,870
she's at,
born in Iran,

1885
01:21:11,220 --> 01:21:12,780
moved to uh,
Australia,

1886
01:21:12,781 --> 01:21:16,200
and now she's basically,
she's on the right in that she's,

1887
01:21:16,201 --> 01:21:17,700
you know,
she would be considered a republican

1888
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:21,030
here and she's actually fighting against
immigration the way they're doing it

1889
01:21:21,031 --> 01:21:23,610
there because she realized how good that
country is.

1890
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:25,770
She says,
Australia is the most tolerant nation on

1891
01:21:25,771 --> 01:21:29,400
earth,
and we're now a unfurling that tolerance

1892
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:32,670
by allowing everybody and even if even
if they don't believe the things we

1893
01:21:32,671 --> 01:21:34,440
believe,
and even if they don't want to integrate

1894
01:21:34,441 --> 01:21:36,030
and assimilate properly and all that
stuff,

1895
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,400
well,
they're very hard on illegal immigrants.

1896
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,050
They tend to illegal immigrants.
They put them on a boat and the ship

1897
01:21:41,051 --> 01:21:43,710
into a fucking island,
which is happening all over the place

1898
01:21:43,711 --> 01:21:44,850
and they're sinking boats.
I mean,

1899
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:47,610
there are videos of boats trying to get
to Greece and they're just literally

1900
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:48,444
sinking.
Right.

1901
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,160
Um,
but,

1902
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:52,320
but Australia,
Canada,

1903
01:21:52,530 --> 01:21:53,910
yeah.
There's some other places that are,

1904
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,120
that are pretty good.
But the fight against people who

1905
01:21:57,121 --> 01:22:00,240
disagree and the demonization,
I completely agree with you on.

1906
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:03,540
I think that we have a real problem with
teams.

1907
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:07,380
We have a really real tribal mentality
when it's a team of the ride or a team

1908
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,630
of the left or even a team of the
independence.

1909
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:13,080
I've been seeing so many people and I've
been so disappointed with so many people

1910
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:18,081
ignoring all the things that Clinton has
done and using that Hashtag I'm with

1911
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:20,610
her,
especially my friends that are women

1912
01:22:20,850 --> 01:22:24,390
that are really excited about having the
first woman president and like this one,

1913
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,720
this,
this is the one you want like this is,

1914
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,660
this is like if you wanted to have the
first woman president,

1915
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:35,790
like wouldn't you want to have a woman
who was like Obama when he ran for

1916
01:22:35,791 --> 01:22:40,380
president was a perfect candidate and a
lot of ways and a perfect response to

1917
01:22:40,381 --> 01:22:41,214
George Bush.

1918
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:46,080
I mean take away all the things that he
didn't do that he had offered in his

1919
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:50,550
whole hope and change campaign and
there's so much that he went against,

1920
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:53,340
especially really disturbing stuff like
the whistle blower thing,

1921
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:57,490
like he was offering support for
whistleblowers and saying that people

1922
01:22:57,491 --> 01:23:00,690
were doing illegal activity and they
expose that there'd be protected,

1923
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:04,350
which has been absolutely not the case.
That's to me is like super disturbing

1924
01:23:04,351 --> 01:23:06,070
and I think as many

1925
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:08,110
people said,
he's going to be on the wrong side of

1926
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:10,810
history when it comes to that stuff,
but I don't know how much control or

1927
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:12,550
power they really have.
I don't know.

1928
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:15,640
I don't know what kind of influences the
president really has in that position,

1929
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,940
but my point is he was a great
candidate.

1930
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,130
Hillary Clinton is not a great
candidate.

1931
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:24,160
She's just not.
She's a scary person in a lot of ways.

1932
01:23:24,161 --> 01:23:28,480
All this shit that she's been saying
about Russia being a part of the attack

1933
01:23:28,481 --> 01:23:31,240
and the hacks on her email server and
the DNC,

1934
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:33,310
that's all bullshit.
Well think about improving,

1935
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:38,080
but she keeps saying that she's offered
up the fact that she would respond

1936
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:43,150
militarily,
militarily against Russia for her

1937
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:46,540
writing a bunch of fucked up shit in
emails and getting caught for it.

1938
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:48,850
Right.
So the way you know that it's actual

1939
01:23:48,851 --> 01:23:52,540
bullshit and you're not just giving
hyperbole there is that if they were

1940
01:23:52,541 --> 01:23:56,260
doing the things that now the hillary
campaign is claiming and they do it very

1941
01:23:56,261 --> 01:23:57,730
caring,
they're very careful with their words

1942
01:23:57,731 --> 01:24:00,720
where they never flat out condemn them
for,

1943
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,560
you know,
it's both.

1944
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,120
It has to be coming from the road room
and it's all,

1945
01:24:04,121 --> 01:24:04,841
it's all,
you know,

1946
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:07,450
it's a magic trick to keep you off the
topics of the emails,

1947
01:24:07,451 --> 01:24:09,850
which is really the stuff we should be
talking about.

1948
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,900
But the way you know it's really not
real is that if it was real,

1949
01:24:13,901 --> 01:24:17,370
let's say there was real evidence,
the CIA or the FBI or NSA or whatever

1950
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:20,980
had real evidence that Russia was
genuinely rigging our elections either

1951
01:24:20,981 --> 01:24:23,920
with trump or without trump or whatever
it,

1952
01:24:23,950 --> 01:24:26,650
that would truly be an act of war at
this point.

1953
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,470
That would be an act of war and Obama
would have to be talking about it

1954
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:34,090
endlessly because that's an alley that
like the term rigging the elections and

1955
01:24:34,091 --> 01:24:35,860
interfering with the,
when you say Russia,

1956
01:24:35,890 --> 01:24:38,080
do you mean a guy in Russia?
Like,

1957
01:24:38,081 --> 01:24:41,840
cause that's like a guy in America could
have hacked into that sheet.

1958
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:44,830
Do you mean Putin directly?
The government or do you mean Russian

1959
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:46,230
hackers?
Russian citizen.

1960
01:24:46,260 --> 01:24:48,910
The person who has no connection
whatsoever to the Russian governor who

1961
01:24:48,911 --> 01:24:50,970
may have gotten your shit.
Yeah.

1962
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:52,510
So what about this?
Have you thought about this?

1963
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:55,550
So all this stuff comes out wikileaks.
Let's go on the assumption that Hillary

1964
01:24:55,551 --> 01:24:57,670
is going to win tomorrow.
What if,

1965
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,210
and I,
you know I say this with a,

1966
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:02,770
I always quote Carl Sagan on this one,
which was extraordinary.

1967
01:25:02,771 --> 01:25:07,771
Claims require extraordinary evidence.
But what if wikileaks or the Russian

1968
01:25:08,531 --> 01:25:12,850
government or whoever it is is right?
What if they're saving the real shit

1969
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:15,010
until she's president when they release
it today?

1970
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:15,941
No,
we're not.

1971
01:25:15,941 --> 01:25:18,400
If you really want it to blackmail the
president of the United States,

1972
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,230
black male.
But yeah,

1973
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:23,020
if they wanted to look,
they want money or something or they

1974
01:25:23,021 --> 01:25:25,720
want some [inaudible] global trade
agreements or whatever.

1975
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:25,931
No,
no,

1976
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:26,181
no.
That,

1977
01:25:26,181 --> 01:25:28,540
that you release enough so that she's
damaged.

1978
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:32,200
Now she gets into the White House and
then either you start continually

1979
01:25:32,201 --> 01:25:34,600
leaking more.
Cause I suspect they've got plenty more.

1980
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:39,190
You continually leak more to hamper her
or you actually then have some shit

1981
01:25:39,191 --> 01:25:41,530
over.
Like what if there's some real shit,

1982
01:25:41,531 --> 01:25:42,280
you know,
that she was,

1983
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,290
she facilitated,
you know,

1984
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:48,250
something worse in Libya or you know,
like some other thing and then they

1985
01:25:48,251 --> 01:25:52,210
could potentially have some shit on her,
which then could actually lead to a war

1986
01:25:52,211 --> 01:25:52,931
with Russia.
Again,

1987
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:57,100
I'm just that fully,
I fully throw the Carl Sagan caveat out

1988
01:25:57,101 --> 01:25:59,860
there when I say that,
but you have to think like they have a

1989
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:02,080
political motive.
They're not,

1990
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,160
they're not an a organization.

1991
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,580
Clearly they want to damage hillary.
So I think there's something there.

1992
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,470
You're giving me the skeptical eye,
which is I,

1993
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,370
which is great.
Yeah,

1994
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:12,560
I think that's a lot of speculation.
I think.

1995
01:26:12,561 --> 01:26:13,371
Yeah,
it is for sure.

1996
01:26:13,371 --> 01:26:15,290
It had anything big,
it would've already been out.

1997
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:17,060
I mean,
everybody got a couple of hours left.

1998
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,400
I don't buy it.
I think they would have released it

1999
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:21,440
yesterday or well,
maybe not on Sunday.

2000
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:25,340
Nobody's paying attention,
but I just think that there's no way

2001
01:26:25,341 --> 01:26:26,540
they would've waited this long.
Look,

2002
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:30,470
the FBI saying that they're going to
reopen the investigation was one of the

2003
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:34,040
most damaging things and that came from
the investigation of Anthony Wiener and

2004
01:26:34,041 --> 01:26:35,510
had nothing to do with wikileaks.
Yeah.

2005
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:40,780
It came from just them looking into this
other creep and finding out that he's

2006
01:26:40,941 --> 01:26:44,000
sending his dick pics to some 15 year
old girl or whatever the fuck he was

2007
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:44,834
doing.

2008
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,430
I just don't think there's anything
there.

2009
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:48,170
I think what we've seen,
we've already seen,

2010
01:26:48,180 --> 01:26:50,330
so we have it.
We really have,

2011
01:26:50,331 --> 01:26:52,400
I think the most damaging thing,
in my opinion,

2012
01:26:52,401 --> 01:26:54,200
was Colin Powell,
his impression of her.

2013
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,960
That was,
it was horrific because Colin Powell is

2014
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:59,930
such a respected person.
You very rarely hear anything negative

2015
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:03,440
about him,
and he essentially said that she's a

2016
01:27:03,441 --> 01:27:06,260
moron.
You mean or not not a moron and

2017
01:27:06,261 --> 01:27:08,600
intelligent person who's Hubris fucks up
everything,

2018
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:12,920
which is a way of being a moron and that
you know hill.

2019
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:17,210
The thing about bill out dicking Bimbos
hilarious,

2020
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:18,830
you know,
and he still is.

2021
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,350
And then when Donald Trump brought those
women than he,

2022
01:27:21,351 --> 01:27:23,900
you know,
he's allegedly sexually assaulted and he

2023
01:27:23,901 --> 01:27:25,760
brought them and even raped.
Yeah.

2024
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:29,210
Allegedly brought them to the debate and
had them sit there.

2025
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:31,460
There's a photo of a bill looking over
it.

2026
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:32,690
Those women.
Have you ever seen that?

2027
01:27:32,760 --> 01:27:36,080
I've seen it.
What in the holy fuck was on his mind

2028
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:38,030
when he took,
when the impression,

2029
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:40,250
you know,
that he's giving while he's looking over

2030
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:43,670
at those women like that.
So doesn't that go to why people are

2031
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:44,950
voting for trump?
Yeah.

2032
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:47,510
One of my best friends,
since I'm four years old,

2033
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:51,110
he does not care about politics at all.
Could not care less.

2034
01:27:51,111 --> 01:27:52,730
I don't even know that he could name the
vice president.

2035
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:56,810
He has been all in on trump.
I've never talked more politics with him

2036
01:27:56,811 --> 01:27:59,630
ever in our entire lives.
My best friends is a right wing guy.

2037
01:28:00,110 --> 01:28:02,930
He's completely a political,
he's not big on the government in

2038
01:28:02,931 --> 01:28:04,190
general.
He doesn't care if you,

2039
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:06,170
he doesn't care what you do.
Don't hurt him.

2040
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:07,820
He live and let live.
That's his whole,

2041
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:09,140
I don't think he's ever voted.

2042
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:11,540
I mean this is a great guy,
but that he just has nothing to do with

2043
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:14,180
politics.
He's been all about trump because his

2044
01:28:14,181 --> 01:28:18,350
whole thing is the system is so gross.
We all know it and now the guy's

2045
01:28:18,351 --> 01:28:22,820
exposing it and he's willing to take
that risk of what that might mean.

2046
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,660
Isn't that sort of what Scott Adams and
saying that that's basically the thrust

2047
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:28,460
of it,
that people are just saying,

2048
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,210
we all knew it was fucked up.
Now someone's showing it to you and

2049
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:33,860
your,
but you don't like how he behaves.

2050
01:28:33,861 --> 01:28:36,290
You don't like how he talks about pussy.
You don't like that.

2051
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:37,940
He says mean things to Rosie old,
old,

2052
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:41,270
truly gross things.
I'm not defending any of those things,

2053
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:45,350
but like when someone's actually pulling
the curtain and showing you the wizard

2054
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:48,040
and now the wizards a little weirder
than you like and they go,

2055
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:49,160
oh,
forget that.

2056
01:28:49,160 --> 01:28:50,690
Yeah.
Like let's pull the curtain back and get

2057
01:28:50,691 --> 01:28:53,060
another curtain and you know,
and that's what they were all afraid of.

2058
01:28:53,061 --> 01:28:56,420
They're afraid of this is their chance.
And if they blow it,

2059
01:28:56,930 --> 01:29:00,620
it'll never that the machine will just
swallow everybody up.

2060
01:29:00,650 --> 01:29:01,980
I don't think machine swole and

2061
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:03,990
shit.
I think what we're seeing is the

2062
01:29:03,991 --> 01:29:08,820
inevitable demise of a system that's
wholly incompatible with the Internet.

2063
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:09,840
Yeah.
I think,

2064
01:29:09,870 --> 01:29:11,610
I love that.
That that's what's happening.

2065
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,380
That's what's happening.
This system,

2066
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:18,410
you cannot exist in a world where I
think all communication within the next

2067
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:23,910
20 years is going to be transparent.
Your emails to Jamie,

2068
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,130
you know,
your tweets to your mom,

2069
01:29:26,131 --> 01:29:28,050
whatever the fuck you're doing.
I think it's all going to be

2070
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:29,280
transparent.
I don't think,

2071
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:33,990
I think what the Internet is providing
and what modern,

2072
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:37,740
um,
communication is providing is almost

2073
01:29:37,741 --> 01:29:42,741
instantaneous access to data and to the
way people feel and express themselves.

2074
01:29:43,141 --> 01:29:45,840
And what we were talking about earlier
with these little pops of popcorn,

2075
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,090
the,
that they're going to boil up to a

2076
01:29:48,091 --> 01:29:48,980
gigantic,
but

2077
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,980
it's going to,
technology's not going to stop here.

2078
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:56,100
It's not like what we can do now is as
much as we're going to be able to do in

2079
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:56,430
the future.

2080
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,350
No.
It's going to continue to progress and

2081
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,940
it's going to get to a point where
there's not going to be,

2082
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,610
the deception is going to be impossible.
So that's what it is.

2083
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,340
That's what it is.
Cable News is deceiving everyone we

2084
01:30:05,341 --> 01:30:06,690
know,
they're deceiving everyone.

2085
01:30:06,691 --> 01:30:08,880
They're sleeping with the people.
They're supposed to be taken care of.

2086
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:10,290
All you know what you're supposed to be
watching.

2087
01:30:10,291 --> 01:30:12,570
Sorry.
And now we're exposing it.

2088
01:30:12,571 --> 01:30:13,920
So think about just what we've done
here,

2089
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:16,920
whether if we got one decent point and
the in the however long we've been

2090
01:30:16,921 --> 01:30:19,590
sitting here,
if we got one thing out 15 years ago,

2091
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,820
you could not do this.
You could not have two people fully

2092
01:30:23,821 --> 01:30:27,060
unfiltered for this amount of time doing
what we're doing.

2093
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,270
So if we manage one cogent point in this
whole thing,

2094
01:30:30,420 --> 01:30:33,150
that's more than you could have got out
15 years ago.

2095
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:34,710
Well,
it's definitely more than you're ever

2096
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:39,090
going to see on networks because
networks have an obligation and they

2097
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:41,580
have an agenda.
And I was going back and forth and I

2098
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:44,070
tweeted about this,
that was going back and forth between

2099
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:47,670
Fox News and CNN.
One night I just sat in front of the TV.

2100
01:30:47,850 --> 01:30:51,390
My wife and kids were out and so I was
just sitting in front of the TV.

2101
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:54,840
Stone is fuck flipping through the
channels going back and forth between

2102
01:30:54,841 --> 01:30:57,250
CNN and Fox and I was Goddamn
bewildered.

2103
01:30:57,251 --> 01:30:59,100
I was like,
I'm watching two different worlds,

2104
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,320
two different plants,
like there's two different parallel

2105
01:31:01,321 --> 01:31:04,860
universes in a one parallel universe.
Hillary Clinton is,

2106
01:31:04,861 --> 01:31:06,810
you know,
the savior of the world and the other

2107
01:31:06,811 --> 01:31:08,790
one,
she's a monster and Bill Clinton is a

2108
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,260
rapist and a sexual Predator and these
women are a bunch of Bimbos or just came

2109
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:17,900
out against Donald Trump and they're all
puppets and Gloria all reds in on it and

2110
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:19,290
all this craziness.

2111
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:20,190
And I'm like,
what?

2112
01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:23,070
What?
What would a person think if they had,

2113
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:25,230
this is their first exposure to human
beings.

2114
01:31:25,350 --> 01:31:28,680
If an alien came here from another
planet and there's first exposure to

2115
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:33,681
human beings was looking at this process
to decide who controls the button,

2116
01:31:33,940 --> 01:31:38,940
then that has all the nuclear weapons of
the world pointed at various countries.

2117
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:42,390
I mean,
this is insanity and this is an insane

2118
01:31:42,391 --> 01:31:44,700
way to communicate.
So how do,

2119
01:31:44,730 --> 01:31:49,110
how do we then as as the,
the neos of this,

2120
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,520
of this matrix,
right?

2121
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:53,160
How do we then keep emboldening?
I mean,

2122
01:31:53,161 --> 01:31:54,850
I guess we just have to keep doing that
for the building.

2123
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,320
There's an inevitable process going on
and it's,

2124
01:31:57,321 --> 01:31:59,870
it's going to,
it's

2125
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:04,420
going to,
it's going to overwhelm what we consider

2126
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:07,960
to be normal communication.
It's going to overwhelm that and right

2127
01:32:07,961 --> 01:32:12,670
now I think we're at,
we're at a very early stage of this

2128
01:32:12,790 --> 01:32:15,490
technological progression and I think
we're looking at,

2129
01:32:15,491 --> 01:32:18,790
in terms of the Internet and devices and
phones and laptops and shit,

2130
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:23,500
but I think new technology is going to
emerge that's going to foot look.

2131
01:32:23,740 --> 01:32:28,060
No one would have ever thought that you
would have people addicted to a phone.

2132
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:31,300
Just 20 years ago.
No one would've ever even considered the

2133
01:32:31,301 --> 01:32:34,300
idea of being addicted to a phone,
that you would go to a restaurant and

2134
01:32:34,301 --> 01:32:37,990
80% of the people would just be on their
phone and no one likes it when you bring

2135
01:32:37,991 --> 01:32:39,280
it up.
If you say to them,

2136
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:40,750
hey man,
want to get off your phone?

2137
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:41,980
Like,
fuck dude,

2138
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:43,340
I got important emails coming through.

2139
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:45,550
Everybody gets mad.
It's like,

2140
01:32:45,551 --> 01:32:46,390
you know,
you like saying,

2141
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:47,560
Hey,
do you really need that drink?

2142
01:32:47,561 --> 01:32:50,620
I fuck him off that track.
It's the same goddamn feeling.

2143
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:54,580
People were responding to an addiction,
but this is just step one man.

2144
01:32:54,581 --> 01:32:58,180
This is step one of an ultimate complete
invasiveness.

2145
01:32:58,181 --> 01:33:03,070
There's going to be some new technology,
whether it's a neural implant or whether

2146
01:33:03,071 --> 01:33:06,070
there's some other device that we're
going to wear,

2147
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:10,510
but there's going to be something that
connects us far more intimately with

2148
01:33:10,511 --> 01:33:12,190
each other than what we're experiencing
now,

2149
01:33:12,191 --> 01:33:13,900
which is pretty God damn intimate.
Yeah.

2150
01:33:13,901 --> 01:33:16,930
Wouldn't it be nice?
I had a guy who was running for the

2151
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:20,330
transhumanist party [inaudible].

2152
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,070
Yeah,
so that's what we talked.

2153
01:33:22,071 --> 01:33:23,260
I mean we spend,
as I'm sure you did,

2154
01:33:23,261 --> 01:33:25,330
we spent the hour basically talking
about all that,

2155
01:33:25,331 --> 01:33:27,430
that think about it.
We're not talking about it this look,

2156
01:33:27,431 --> 01:33:29,200
it's not that this shit's happening
tomorrow,

2157
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:32,200
but instead of talking about grabbing
pussy and emails,

2158
01:33:32,201 --> 01:33:35,200
we should be talking about some of these
things,

2159
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:39,970
some of these actual things that are
going to shape our lives and we don't

2160
01:33:39,971 --> 01:33:42,970
talk about any of this stuff.
And then the shit just happens.

2161
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,430
And then instead of talking about it and
preparing ourselves,

2162
01:33:45,550 --> 01:33:48,310
we react.
But we need to do a little legwork so

2163
01:33:48,311 --> 01:33:50,260
that when this stuff comes,
whatever it is,

2164
01:33:50,770 --> 01:33:52,660
we have to be ready for it.
And we don't.

2165
01:33:52,661 --> 01:33:55,150
So one day the robots will be here and
we're going to be bound down to him

2166
01:33:55,151 --> 01:33:57,170
because we didn't do the Legwork to go,
Huh,

2167
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:58,390
you know what they were gonna turn on
us.

2168
01:33:58,390 --> 01:33:59,340
We should have,
uh,

2169
01:33:59,620 --> 01:34:02,170
well,
I don't necessarily know if the robots

2170
01:34:02,171 --> 01:34:04,720
are gonna turn on us like the,
that's the big concern that a lot of

2171
01:34:04,721 --> 01:34:06,820
people have.
Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk,

2172
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:10,000
the artificial intelligence.
I think before then we're going to

2173
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:10,781
integrate.
I mean,

2174
01:34:10,781 --> 01:34:14,320
I think before virtual reality you're
going to have augmented reality and I

2175
01:34:14,321 --> 01:34:17,980
think that augmented human beings,
human beings that are augmented with

2176
01:34:17,981 --> 01:34:20,460
technology,
that's really going to be what's going

2177
01:34:20,461 --> 01:34:24,700
to separate us from what we are now,
which is essentially the monkey holding

2178
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:26,800
the device.
I think the device is going to be in the

2179
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:28,720
monk.
We'll look at all ten's got the chip in

2180
01:34:28,721 --> 01:34:31,580
him and he can open his garage door and
strength and he's,

2181
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:32,940
he was talking about a guy that,
you know,

2182
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:36,190
he knows a guy that wants to chop his
arm off to get the bionic arm to be

2183
01:34:36,191 --> 01:34:36,671
able,
you know,

2184
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,490
and get Wifi in your arm and Ooh.
Yeah.

2185
01:34:39,491 --> 01:34:42,040
And then somebody hacks into the
Russians are going to hack his arm.

2186
01:34:42,041 --> 01:34:46,470
That's gonna jerk his own dick off.
Leaders going to do with this robotic.

2187
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:47,650
Oh boy.
Yeah.

2188
01:34:47,651 --> 01:34:50,050
You think we're in shit now.
I think we should go into stand up.

2189
01:34:50,051 --> 01:34:52,320
I've been saying that for years.
It's a really good public speaker.

2190
01:34:52,321 --> 01:34:54,370
He's obviously fucked off.
He's got all the traits,

2191
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,200
you know,
he's got everything going on.

2192
01:34:56,230 --> 01:34:58,070
They get them in stand up.
I think he's

2193
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:59,650
probably pretty fucking funny.
He looks,

2194
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:01,430
he looks funny.
Yeah.

2195
01:35:01,560 --> 01:35:03,260
He's a great face for it.
Yeah.

2196
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:07,880
The wrong line of business politics are
essentially show business for ugly

2197
01:35:07,881 --> 01:35:09,920
people.
Guess what sounds comedy,

2198
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:11,120
you know,
comedy,

2199
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:14,540
you knows there's been some really not
very good looking people that have done

2200
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:15,890
a wonderful job of,
uh,

2201
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:18,880
telling jokes and becoming famous.
I think we look pretty good relative,

2202
01:35:18,970 --> 01:35:19,930
relative Max.
Yeah.

2203
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:21,500
I mean,
I haven't been doing stand up much in

2204
01:35:21,501 --> 01:35:23,600
the last couple of years,
but I think relatively speaking,

2205
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:25,990
we gotta be on the higher end of
relatively speaking.

2206
01:35:25,991 --> 01:35:28,640
And tosh is probably number one,
that handsome bastard bastard.

2207
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:30,440
Beautiful Hair.
Fuck beautiful man.

2208
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:32,630
There's a few of them like that.
Sebastian,

2209
01:35:32,631 --> 01:35:35,780
he's a good looking goddamn guy too.
There's quite a few,

2210
01:35:36,290 --> 01:35:40,250
but now more so than ever in the past
that was happened to the fat slob and

2211
01:35:40,251 --> 01:35:42,620
Lee comedian I would know.

2212
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:45,760
But I'm talking to Lucy Kay embraces it.
Lou Anderson,

2213
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:47,560
and he just,
I was happy that he wanted that.

2214
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:49,890
Yeah.
That he won the Ralphie May,

2215
01:35:49,891 --> 01:35:50,301
right?
Yeah.

2216
01:35:50,301 --> 01:35:51,920
Ralphie may takes us to the whole new
level.

2217
01:35:52,060 --> 01:35:55,240
Yeah.
And he's like a Bruce Lee of,

2218
01:35:59,060 --> 01:36:00,230
well,
there you go.

2219
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,000
Something you wouldn't say in front of
him.

2220
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:02,923
No,
I would,

2221
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:05,960
he knows what he is.
Yeah.

2222
01:36:06,740 --> 01:36:08,630
It's not the worst thing in the world.
Um,

2223
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,910
well whatever.
I just,

2224
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:14,210
I honestly believe that we're at a
tipping point in,

2225
01:36:14,211 --> 01:36:16,040
uh,
in human civilization.

2226
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:20,240
And I think that what this election is
exposing is how ridiculous our processes

2227
01:36:20,450 --> 01:36:23,420
that our process was created by people
who used to write with feathers.

2228
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:24,681
You know,
I mean,

2229
01:36:24,681 --> 01:36:27,110
it really was,
it was created by people who rode horses

2230
01:36:27,111 --> 01:36:30,350
to get around and you know,
they needed a representative government

2231
01:36:30,351 --> 01:36:32,240
cause there was no fucking way are you
gonna be able to talk to someone in

2232
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:33,020
Missouri,
right.

2233
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,270
It would take forever.
And so they needed someone to talk to

2234
01:36:35,271 --> 01:36:37,340
those people and then get the word back
to Washington.

2235
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,920
We don't need that anymore.
It's an archaic system.

2236
01:36:39,950 --> 01:36:42,980
And then an archaic system is in many
ways being exposed.

2237
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:44,840
Um,
I made a tweet recently or an instagram

2238
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:47,390
post about this guy that was going over
the electoral map,

2239
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:50,210
like a storm was coming.
He was like [inaudible] and all the

2240
01:36:50,211 --> 01:36:51,500
states.
And I was like,

2241
01:36:51,501 --> 01:36:54,220
this guy is like talking about storms.
He's talking about,

2242
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:58,190
he's doing a forecast.
Like this is so bizarre what we're

2243
01:36:58,191 --> 01:36:59,160
seeing now.
Well you're,

2244
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:01,280
you're so right.
I mean just on the technology front and

2245
01:37:01,281 --> 01:37:03,620
how we vote,
it's like every state has two senators.

2246
01:37:03,621 --> 01:37:07,340
And the reason they did it back then was
because they wanted to make sure that

2247
01:37:07,341 --> 01:37:10,220
the states like Montana that have nobody
living there had some sort of

2248
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:11,270
representations.

2249
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:14,210
So they needed to make sure that the
train with the president campaigning

2250
01:37:14,211 --> 01:37:16,820
would actually make it there or the
horse and buggy or whatever it was.

2251
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:20,300
And it's like now it's all changed.
So everything being equal,

2252
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:22,690
even though I'm not for changing a lot
of the,

2253
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:25,550
I certainly wouldn't be for changing the
constitution,

2254
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:30,020
but like the fact that Montana has two
senators and California has two

2255
01:37:30,021 --> 01:37:31,710
senators,
California has like that.

2256
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:33,770
What is it like the 10th biggest economy
in the world?

2257
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:34,703
Right?
Something like that.

2258
01:37:34,970 --> 01:37:36,480
So it's like,
that's not right.

2259
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:37,161
Right.
You know,

2260
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:39,620
technology has changed,
so it's not necessary anymore.

2261
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:43,130
The people in Montana can hear all the
same shit that the people in California

2262
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:45,200
have.
So there are things that are happening

2263
01:37:45,201 --> 01:37:48,980
now that the system,
because it's so ingrained and because

2264
01:37:48,981 --> 01:37:51,260
the people that control it and the
money,

2265
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,960
I don't even think that's a conspiracy.
I think that's just the way things work.

2266
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:55,680
It's just,
it's so grained.

2267
01:37:55,690 --> 01:37:56,070
You know what

2268
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:01,070
we love about the constitution has
essentially already been violated by the

2269
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:03,750
Patriot Act,
the Patriot Act to the NDA.

2270
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:07,740
There's a lot of weird shit that's
already in place that kind of takes away

2271
01:38:07,741 --> 01:38:11,430
from the things that the founding
fathers had set up to make sure that

2272
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:14,330
tyranny was never embraced.
That we,

2273
01:38:14,331 --> 01:38:15,031
we,
we,

2274
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:20,031
we have these things that we established
a long time ago that we think of when we

2275
01:38:21,691 --> 01:38:23,760
think of what the United States is.
Freedom of speech,

2276
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:25,350
freedom of speech.
Um,

2277
01:38:25,380 --> 01:38:27,530
you,
you have a right to a fair trial when

2278
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:31,620
you don't anymore with the Patriot Act.
And with indefinite detention that was

2279
01:38:31,621 --> 01:38:34,800
provided by the NDA,
they could kind of put you in jail for

2280
01:38:34,801 --> 01:38:36,960
whatever they decide.
They put you in jail because you

2281
01:38:36,961 --> 01:38:41,430
represent a threat or that you are on a
terrorist watch list or whatever.

2282
01:38:41,431 --> 01:38:43,410
And if they decide that you're a threat
to America,

2283
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:45,570
you,
you really don't have the right to a

2284
01:38:45,571 --> 01:38:47,220
trial,
they can just lock you up.

2285
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:49,590
I mean,
look at what the fuck they did to

2286
01:38:49,591 --> 01:38:50,790
Chelsea manning.
Yeah,

2287
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:52,800
I mean,
to this day she just tried to commit

2288
01:38:52,801 --> 01:38:54,780
suicide again apparently.
Yeah.

2289
01:38:55,530 --> 01:38:56,520
This,
this whole,

2290
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,120
I mean not to me disturbs me almost as
much as anything.

2291
01:39:00,121 --> 01:39:05,121
The Way Julian assange just like trapped
in a house in London and can't leave.

2292
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:07,860
He's in an embassy.
So what does that tell you then about

2293
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:10,200
the progressive's that we're all about
this right?

2294
01:39:10,201 --> 01:39:12,930
They were all about Chelsea manning.
They were all about getting all the

2295
01:39:12,931 --> 01:39:15,270
information when it was all breaking.
I was completely with them.

2296
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,021
It's,
I'm all,

2297
01:39:16,021 --> 01:39:16,831
you know,
like look,

2298
01:39:16,831 --> 01:39:19,230
I believe that governments should be
transparent,

2299
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:21,270
but there is some shit.
Are you with me on this?

2300
01:39:21,271 --> 01:39:24,120
That some shit has to go down that we
can't know of.

2301
01:39:24,121 --> 01:39:24,871
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2302
01:39:24,871 --> 01:39:27,270
Like that's,
I just think it's when people want

2303
01:39:27,271 --> 01:39:29,280
everything to be fully transparent,
it's like put it,

2304
01:39:29,281 --> 01:39:34,260
the problem is who gets to keep those
secrets and why the regular folks as a

2305
01:39:34,261 --> 01:39:37,140
regular person get to keep those secrets
over the American people?

2306
01:39:37,770 --> 01:39:39,540
Well,
I dunno.

2307
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:42,840
I Dunno what the right answer to that is
other than there has to be,

2308
01:39:42,841 --> 01:39:45,450
you can't have everyone walking around
with all the knowledge.

2309
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,910
That's a problem.
And I think someday that's going to be

2310
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:49,920
inevitable.
That's what I'm saying about technology

2311
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:51,870
that eventually it'll just unfurl the
whole thing.

2312
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:55,440
It's a bottleneck is there.
And I also think the bottleneck is going

2313
01:39:55,441 --> 01:39:59,370
to occur with money because I think
money right now is really just numbers

2314
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:03,270
mean money isn't backed by gold anymore.
It's just numbers.

2315
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:06,510
It's just numbers on a well.
So that means it's data.

2316
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:09,540
So that means it's information and
information.

2317
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,830
It's going in the direction that
information is eventually going to be

2318
01:40:13,831 --> 01:40:16,170
completely transparent.
You're gonna be able to share

2319
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:19,200
information back and forth.
I don't know if we're going to be able

2320
01:40:19,201 --> 01:40:22,470
to hold onto this concept of money.
I think the concept of money that we

2321
01:40:22,471 --> 01:40:26,730
have in our,
it's connected to civilization and that

2322
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,520
in itself is only a few thousand years
old.

2323
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:32,550
I mean if you look at the invention of
money before that,

2324
01:40:32,551 --> 01:40:35,310
it was sort of like trading in goods and
services or whatever it was.

2325
01:40:35,700 --> 01:40:37,950
You're going back what,
20,000 years,

2326
01:40:37,951 --> 01:40:39,990
30,000 years.
Human beings have been around for a long

2327
01:40:39,991 --> 01:40:42,540
fucking time.
Culture's been around for a long time.

2328
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:47,570
I thought like 10,000 years.
Human beings in this current state are

2329
01:40:47,971 --> 01:40:51,750
incredibly recent where we're not even
dealing with gold anymore.

2330
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:54,070
Now we're just dealing with numbers.
I think the

2331
01:40:54,070 --> 01:40:57,010
next step is that you can't keep track
of that anymore.

2332
01:40:57,190 --> 01:41:00,220
The next step is going to be a resource
based economy,

2333
01:41:00,520 --> 01:41:04,420
meaning that people are just going to be
sharing and trading and resources and

2334
01:41:04,421 --> 01:41:07,630
we're going to have to figure out some
way to quantify those resources and

2335
01:41:07,631 --> 01:41:11,620
quantify your value and I don't think
it's going to be the way it is now where

2336
01:41:11,621 --> 01:41:15,190
you have these hedge fund managers and
these Bernie Madoff twats that are

2337
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:20,191
fucking just essentially moving numbers
around and making ungodly sums of money.

2338
01:41:20,561 --> 01:41:22,030
I mean,
if you look at the Hamptons,

2339
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:26,380
a lot of those fucking people that have
these castles out there and then in the

2340
01:41:26,381 --> 01:41:30,250
castles in Connecticut,
you have these people that have just

2341
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:31,830
figured out a way to move numbers
around.

2342
01:41:31,930 --> 01:41:34,480
That's all they're doing.
They're moving playing tricks with the

2343
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:35,590
system basically.
Yes.

2344
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:37,840
They're extracting money from a broken
system.

2345
01:41:37,870 --> 01:41:38,770
Well,
that's why I think that,

2346
01:41:38,771 --> 01:41:40,720
you know,
even when people come after trump on the

2347
01:41:40,721 --> 01:41:43,750
money stuff,
you know the whole thing with the $918

2348
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:44,930
million in the write off and all that.
Yes.

2349
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:45,850
Now look,
we don't know.

2350
01:41:45,851 --> 01:41:48,400
We haven't seen his taxes.
He made it the election tomorrow.

2351
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:51,700
He made it without John's talk city.
Do that because again,

2352
01:41:51,701 --> 01:41:54,040
it's just trolling the system.
But do you remember when,

2353
01:41:54,150 --> 01:41:57,190
when Howard stern was running for
governor and they were forcing him to

2354
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:58,900
reveal his taxes and he went,
fuck you,

2355
01:41:58,901 --> 01:42:00,140
I'm out.
Oh,

2356
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:02,560
I remember that.
Was that what happened to drop?

2357
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:04,780
Basically?
Howard's a very wise guy.

2358
01:42:04,850 --> 01:42:06,850
So I would,
I would imagine that he knew that was

2359
01:42:06,851 --> 01:42:09,010
going to happen and didn't really want
to be governor anyway,

2360
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,680
but when he was running for governor,
that was the heart.

2361
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:15,880
That was a hurdle that they told him he
had to expose his taxes to Howard's

2362
01:42:15,881 --> 01:42:16,150
credit.

2363
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:16,841
And I love,
love,

2364
01:42:16,841 --> 01:42:18,280
love Howard.
Um,

2365
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,440
you know,
did you see a couple of weeks ago they

2366
01:42:20,441 --> 01:42:22,150
were,
people were asking him to release all

2367
01:42:22,151 --> 01:42:24,940
the trump interviews from all the years,
from the 20 years,

2368
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:25,751
and he said,
no,

2369
01:42:25,751 --> 01:42:29,620
I'm not going to do it.
Because when people came and come to my

2370
01:42:29,621 --> 01:42:30,880
studio,
it's,

2371
01:42:30,881 --> 01:42:33,710
we're playing a game,
sort of we're talking about women were,

2372
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:36,500
and it would add nothing to this.
And,

2373
01:42:36,501 --> 01:42:38,350
and Donald Trump is a good sport about
it.

2374
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:41,170
So for me to betray that it would be
betraying my own self.

2375
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,900
I thought it was a pretty great
principled statement by him.

2376
01:42:43,930 --> 01:42:47,140
That is great.
It's also taking it out of context,

2377
01:42:47,141 --> 01:42:49,360
the context of being on the stern show,
but didn't do,

2378
01:42:49,370 --> 01:42:51,030
they did use some of the stuff that he
said,

2379
01:42:51,031 --> 01:42:54,640
so they got supporting the war.
So I think somebody else had that video.

2380
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:58,780
But I guess there's apparently archive
full of stuff that I guess he owns or,

2381
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:00,070
Oh,
okay.

2382
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:02,790
Well,
I mean there is of,

2383
01:43:03,100 --> 01:43:05,680
there's a time and a place for things,
but there's also,

2384
01:43:05,860 --> 01:43:09,460
you have to think that this guy was not
running for president back when he was

2385
01:43:09,461 --> 01:43:13,120
saying those things.
I was just being a silly man on a silly

2386
01:43:13,121 --> 01:43:15,700
show where it's all about humor and you
know,

2387
01:43:15,701 --> 01:43:18,550
being a good sport and playing a role as
Howard put it.

2388
01:43:19,150 --> 01:43:20,780
Maybe you're paraphrasing him,
but I think that's,

2389
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:22,620
that's pretty accurate.
Yeah,

2390
01:43:22,640 --> 01:43:23,520
so he was,
yeah,

2391
01:43:23,530 --> 01:43:24,730
he was playing the game.
I thought that was,

2392
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:25,220
you know,
look,

2393
01:43:25,220 --> 01:43:28,090
he would've had an opportunity to get
him in the mix again.

2394
01:43:28,091 --> 01:43:28,620
You know,
may,

2395
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:29,800
you know,
more publicity for him.

2396
01:43:29,801 --> 01:43:30,430
And he said,
no,

2397
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:32,740
that's not,
that's not what the purpose of what I've

2398
01:43:32,741 --> 01:43:36,280
built here for the last 40 years is,
and I'm not going to throw in on this

2399
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:38,470
garbage.
So I thought it was pretty good.

2400
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:39,521
Well,
you know,

2401
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:44,350
I'm sure he probably realizes that if he
ever decided to run for government in

2402
01:43:44,351 --> 01:43:46,450
the form,
now the same thing would be used against

2403
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:48,200
him.
But what does that say about an std?

2404
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:50,710
Not Him.
You know who he is,

2405
01:43:50,711 --> 01:43:53,690
is you ask him,
what are your well considered opinions

2406
01:43:53,691 --> 01:43:55,520
on things right now?
And then,

2407
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,640
you know,
the woe in 1989 you've said,

2408
01:43:58,970 --> 01:44:01,380
you know that this person's a monkey and
you know,

2409
01:44:01,381 --> 01:44:03,890
and like think how fucking dangerous
that is.

2410
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:07,370
So from the,
from the limited amount that I know you,

2411
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,980
I,
you seem to me to be an extremely

2412
01:44:09,981 --> 01:44:12,080
principled person.
You have a code that you live by,

2413
01:44:12,081 --> 01:44:14,450
you,
you care about honesty and being

2414
01:44:14,451 --> 01:44:16,280
forthright and,
and all of that stuff,

2415
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:18,080
right?
Think of all the things that you've said

2416
01:44:18,081 --> 01:44:19,960
here about doing drugs or sex or,
right,

2417
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:20,481
blah,
blah,

2418
01:44:20,481 --> 01:44:20,960
blah.

2419
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,530
Someone like you would never want to run
for president ever.

2420
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,060
We could,
you even possibly fathom running five

2421
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:29,390
wouldn't want the job.
But if I did,

2422
01:44:29,690 --> 01:44:30,970
if I did run,
I don't,

2423
01:44:30,990 --> 01:44:32,390
I don't want to.
But if I did,

2424
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:33,780
they would definitely use all that stuff
against.

2425
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:36,590
And that's why context is so incredibly
important.

2426
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:40,070
And this is also an incredibly new thing
with human beings.

2427
01:44:40,071 --> 01:44:44,300
Being able to extract little soundbites
from things that you've said and whether

2428
01:44:44,301 --> 01:44:47,090
it's a tweet from justine sacco or
whatever the fuck it is.

2429
01:44:47,091 --> 01:44:49,580
And then say,
this defines you this moment.

2430
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:53,210
This one moment defines you.
This one moment where someone cuts you

2431
01:44:53,211 --> 01:44:55,370
off and you go,
you fucking cunt,

2432
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:59,510
and you lay on your horn.
This is Dave Rubin that you want Dave

2433
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:02,740
Ruben running your country.
What if that was your mom that cutoff?

2434
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:05,150
Dave Ruben.
What if that woman was headed to the

2435
01:45:05,151 --> 01:45:05,984
hospital?

2436
01:45:05,990 --> 01:45:09,910
What if her baby was dying in the
backseat and Dave Ruben called her con?

2437
01:45:10,580 --> 01:45:11,420
I mean,
you know,

2438
01:45:11,590 --> 01:45:14,870
that's,
I'm trying to,

2439
01:45:14,871 --> 01:45:16,730
I'm just throwing little,
little,

2440
01:45:16,731 --> 01:45:17,600
uh,
whatever.

2441
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:21,730
I just think that that's the problem.
That's the problem that you can't think

2442
01:45:21,731 --> 01:45:23,000
of.
I mean even I'm not,

2443
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:26,210
all I'm doing right now is saying what I
think as it comes out of my brain,

2444
01:45:26,211 --> 01:45:27,410
right?
I'm not freaking me out.

2445
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:27,770
Yeah,
it's,

2446
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:28,461
it's,
it's wild.

2447
01:45:28,461 --> 01:45:30,530
But it's all freaking me out.
But that's all we're doing here.

2448
01:45:30,531 --> 01:45:33,290
But anyone,
anyone that doesn't like us or wanted to

2449
01:45:33,291 --> 01:45:36,380
discredit us or anything and you know,
not to bring it back to Sam again,

2450
01:45:36,381 --> 01:45:38,630
but you know,
the types of things that people with

2451
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:42,630
really awful intentions have done with
misquoting him and all that stuff and

2452
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:47,770
that thing needs to be destroyed.
That outrage monster that we'll find one

2453
01:45:48,441 --> 01:45:53,000
thing that you did or said once to then
destroy every other piece of goodness

2454
01:45:53,001 --> 01:45:55,130
that you've put out there must end.

2455
01:45:55,130 --> 01:45:57,020
And that's,
that is a big piece of what's happening

2456
01:45:57,021 --> 01:45:59,090
here too.
I also think discourse in particular

2457
01:45:59,091 --> 01:46:02,750
like discourse against Sam is,
is what a lot of people are doing.

2458
01:46:02,751 --> 01:46:06,860
They're playing a game and Sam has a
high profile and they're using their

2459
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:09,950
voice to attack that high profile to
make a move on the castle.

2460
01:46:10,220 --> 01:46:11,870
You know,
it's like they're moving chess pieces

2461
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:14,150
around and they're using strategy and
they're saying,

2462
01:46:14,151 --> 01:46:15,650
well,
he said this about Islam,

2463
01:46:15,980 --> 01:46:18,080
you know,
and do you understand how many billions

2464
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:22,010
of people or a peaceful Muslims and how
offensive this is to say that they,

2465
01:46:22,011 --> 01:46:23,360
you know,
and that that's what they're doing

2466
01:46:23,361 --> 01:46:25,490
there.
They're taking these positions and

2467
01:46:25,491 --> 01:46:29,390
they're also taking these positions in a
weird way because there's something

2468
01:46:29,391 --> 01:46:33,320
about writing a blog.
It's a very cowardly thing when you're

2469
01:46:33,321 --> 01:46:35,510
attacking someone because they don't
respond.

2470
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:36,860
They just,
I mean,

2471
01:46:36,861 --> 01:46:39,020
you want someone to respond back in a
blog,

2472
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:42,020
you're requiring an incredible amount of
their time sitting there and formulate

2473
01:46:42,030 --> 01:46:44,210
another blog,
but then you know that,

2474
01:46:44,270 --> 01:46:47,480
that it's a one way dialogue.
Or if someone writes an attack blog on

2475
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:48,520
Dave Ruben.
Yeah,

2476
01:46:48,640 --> 01:46:50,070
they,
that's a very cowardly

2477
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:54,240
thing because what they're doing is
they're sort of forcing you to respond

2478
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:59,420
by establishing a false narrative are by
portraying you in an unfavorable light

2479
01:47:00,061 --> 01:47:02,490
by taking things out of context and
using them.

2480
01:47:02,491 --> 01:47:04,080
And I'm,
I do people do it against me.

2481
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,250
And it's,
it's almost,

2482
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,480
it's funny when you read,

2483
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:07,191
you read it,
you're like,

2484
01:47:07,191 --> 01:47:08,300
wow,
this is weird.

2485
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,140
Or that someone split,
spent so much thought on extrapolating

2486
01:47:12,141 --> 01:47:14,960
something that you said that you didn't
either mean or it's like,

2487
01:47:14,961 --> 01:47:17,180
wow,
you really went deep on my psyche in a

2488
01:47:17,181 --> 01:47:18,850
way that had nothing to do that.
So you,

2489
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:20,720
you know,
this Guy Mike Cernovich by any chance?

2490
01:47:20,721 --> 01:47:21,410
Yes.
Okay.

2491
01:47:21,410 --> 01:47:22,340
Have you had them on?
No,

2492
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:23,990
I have not.
So I'm going to smoke some pot.

2493
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:25,730
Yeah.
Smokes and is all freaking me out.

2494
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:29,510
I'm kind of freaked out for a,
I can't smoked the sativa.

2495
01:47:29,511 --> 01:47:30,344
Sorry.
But,

2496
01:47:30,710 --> 01:47:32,120
um,
so,

2497
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:34,010
so Mike Cernovich I've had on my show,
he's,

2498
01:47:34,011 --> 01:47:37,700
he's big within the,
he's the pro trump guy and,

2499
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:39,950
uh,
I'll try to make this really deep.

2500
01:47:39,951 --> 01:47:40,800
So yeah.
Man.

2501
01:47:40,820 --> 01:47:41,750
Really appreciate it,
dude.

2502
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:43,220
Um,
anyway,

2503
01:47:43,680 --> 01:47:45,710
uh,
w from having him on,

2504
01:47:45,711 --> 01:47:48,650
I got more shit than I've had than
anyone else that I've had on because you

2505
01:47:48,651 --> 01:47:51,110
had them on because I had,
because he was sort of a cause he's

2506
01:47:51,111 --> 01:47:52,670
thought of as part of the alt right.

2507
01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:56,900
He apparently he had tweeted like three
years before I had him on the show.

2508
01:47:56,930 --> 01:47:59,300
I didn't even know who he was until
about two weeks before I had him on.

2509
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:02,660
But about three years before that,
he had tweeted something that sounded

2510
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:06,710
like he was a rape apologist,
but it was either a bad joke or it was a

2511
01:48:06,711 --> 01:48:08,880
little unclear,
rewarded clumsily or whatever.

2512
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:10,480
Remember what it was.
We,

2513
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,020
it can put,
we can probably find it pretty quick,

2514
01:48:12,290 --> 01:48:13,850
but I don't,
I don't remember exactly what it was.

2515
01:48:14,120 --> 01:48:16,100
But then suddenly I got all these people
saying,

2516
01:48:16,110 --> 01:48:19,970
you see Ruben had a rape apologist on,
he must hate women or you know,

2517
01:48:19,971 --> 01:48:21,290
something to that effect.
And it's like,

2518
01:48:21,291 --> 01:48:24,740
what you guys are doing is just,
you're picking,

2519
01:48:24,741 --> 01:48:27,050
okay,
so should I let you pick who I talked

2520
01:48:27,051 --> 01:48:27,771
to?
You know,

2521
01:48:27,771 --> 01:48:29,930
and that's like you should have the guy
on,

2522
01:48:29,931 --> 01:48:31,400
you'll get a certain amount of hate for
it,

2523
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:33,650
but you'll have an a really interesting
conversation with him,

2524
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:34,880
haven't you had

2525
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:39,230
people that you've communicated with
that you thought were one way and as you

2526
01:48:39,231 --> 01:48:42,200
got to know them better and better,
you found out some stuff they had said

2527
01:48:42,201 --> 01:48:43,070
and you might,
Whoa,

2528
01:48:43,100 --> 01:48:45,470
I'll call it.
There's some things that people say that

2529
01:48:45,471 --> 01:48:50,471
is just absolutely are inarguable.
You can't,

2530
01:48:51,230 --> 01:48:52,580
you can't support it.
You know,

2531
01:48:52,581 --> 01:48:54,110
there's,
there's certain things that people have

2532
01:48:54,111 --> 01:48:55,640
said that inexcusable,
right?

2533
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:56,580
Of course.
And you,

2534
01:48:56,580 --> 01:49:00,890
you might come across those two.
So I could see the point of taking some

2535
01:49:00,891 --> 01:49:04,850
things and maybe they might be even out
of context and using that to sort of

2536
01:49:04,851 --> 01:49:07,460
like say at the very least consider
this.

2537
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:08,590
Sure.
But as an,

2538
01:49:08,620 --> 01:49:10,450
as an interviewer,
you're not,

2539
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,030
you're not,
you or I are not held to.

2540
01:49:13,780 --> 01:49:18,780
If we had to basically vet every person
that we ever sat down with for every

2541
01:49:18,821 --> 01:49:20,920
thought that they had three years ago on
twitter,

2542
01:49:21,250 --> 01:49:23,230
we would be,
I have a pretty Brooke and lonely life.

2543
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:25,690
I'm out some pretty offensive people on
for sure.

2544
01:49:25,691 --> 01:49:27,430
I've gotten a lot of shit for the Milo
interviews.

2545
01:49:27,730 --> 01:49:29,610
I've gotten a lot of shift for some
other people that have so do you,

2546
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:30,530
so,
so Milo,

2547
01:49:30,550 --> 01:49:32,620
I really like my life.
I had him over for dinner.

2548
01:49:32,621 --> 01:49:34,780
I've gone out with him.
I think he's a good guy.

2549
01:49:34,781 --> 01:49:37,420
He's,
he say shit that I would not say it's

2550
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:39,310
working.
That's why we're talking about a much

2551
01:49:39,311 --> 01:49:40,144
like trump.
Yeah.

2552
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:42,070
And that's why trump has done.
Exactly.

2553
01:49:42,071 --> 01:49:43,690
And then when they ban Milo,
what do you do?

2554
01:49:43,690 --> 01:49:45,270
You make him stronger.
The strategy effect.

2555
01:49:45,340 --> 01:49:46,900
You make him stronger.
I spoke,

2556
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,980
I did a speech at a,
at Ucla with Milo were just a little

2557
01:49:50,981 --> 01:49:53,920
back and forth chat thing.
They had all of these kids out.

2558
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:55,930
So first of all there were hundreds of
kids trying to get in.

2559
01:49:55,931 --> 01:49:59,660
But then there was this loud 200 kids
trying to literally block people.

2560
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,180
So they're not against walls.
They don't,

2561
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:02,130
you know,
they don't like trump's wall,

2562
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:04,480
but they're okay.
But blocking a wall for other people to

2563
01:50:04,481 --> 01:50:07,780
exercise their free speech and they're
dumping garbage cans and spitting on

2564
01:50:07,781 --> 01:50:10,420
cops,
getting in cops faces with cameras,

2565
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:13,300
like just begging them to just flip in a
second.

2566
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,280
Anyway,
we have this great chat.

2567
01:50:15,610 --> 01:50:17,320
Um,
it was really funny actually,

2568
01:50:17,321 --> 01:50:20,080
at one point,
this girl in the audience,

2569
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:22,300
she just busted about halfway through,
starts screaming.

2570
01:50:22,301 --> 01:50:23,260
She got an a,
you know,

2571
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:24,820
people weren't,
didn't know she was a protestor.

2572
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,230
She gets in,
she starts screaming,

2573
01:50:26,410 --> 01:50:27,750
I hate you,
I hate you,

2574
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,220
blah blah.
So I stopped and I said,

2575
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:32,560
I bet you actually we were going to do a
q and a at the end,

2576
01:50:32,561 --> 01:50:35,530
but I bet you right now if you ask my
little one question that you really have

2577
01:50:35,531 --> 01:50:38,140
burning or make one point,
I bet you he'll respond to you.

2578
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,820
So I stopped the show ready for this.
So I said,

2579
01:50:40,821 --> 01:50:42,800
do you have one point?
And the girl

2580
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,560
goes,
hey yo.

2581
01:50:44,920 --> 01:50:45,880
And it was like,
well,

2582
01:50:45,881 --> 01:50:48,210
she's a kid,
but that's how stupid these people,

2583
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:52,210
are they stupid or are they just kids?
Like when you're talking about these

2584
01:50:52,211 --> 01:50:56,230
kids that are protesting and stopping
people from going into lectures or some

2585
01:50:56,231 --> 01:50:58,960
of these crazy feminists that have uh,
with,

2586
01:50:58,961 --> 01:51:00,790
you know,
the scene from the University of

2587
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:02,350
Toronto,
very famous thing where they had this

2588
01:51:02,351 --> 01:51:04,120
guy,
they completely misrepresented his

2589
01:51:04,121 --> 01:51:09,121
opinions on things and they had painted
this guy out to be anti female and anti

2590
01:51:09,131 --> 01:51:11,920
woman and as some sort of a men's rights
thing,

2591
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:14,920
which is a very bizarre thing.
Like you have to deny that men's rights

2592
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:16,720
are applicable.
Like it can't,

2593
01:51:17,110 --> 01:51:19,960
if you can't be a feminist and also
recognize men's rights,

2594
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:21,190
it's very,
it's very,

2595
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:26,191
very bizarre of a thing going on where
it's as much as trying to get back at

2596
01:51:28,361 --> 01:51:31,360
the perceived winners of the world when
you feel like you've been a loser of the

2597
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:31,870
world.

2598
01:51:31,870 --> 01:51:34,900
That's where I think white privilege is
coming from and a lot of this stuff,

2599
01:51:35,140 --> 01:51:39,580
not to deny that white people have it
easier than black people in terms of

2600
01:51:39,581 --> 01:51:42,400
dealing with racism,
but it doesn't mean that those white

2601
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:44,410
people are racist.
There's a lot of white people that are

2602
01:51:44,411 --> 01:51:45,790
your allies,
like the,

2603
01:51:45,791 --> 01:51:47,380
the,
the real problem is the racist

2604
01:51:47,381 --> 01:51:49,990
themselves,
not people who aren't victim of the

2605
01:51:49,991 --> 01:51:53,170
racist.
It's like saying that these people are

2606
01:51:53,171 --> 01:51:54,070
lucky.
Yeah,

2607
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:56,860
for sure.
But painting it this some sort of a way

2608
01:51:57,130 --> 01:52:02,110
like where these privileged people,
they're assholes for for allowing this

2609
01:52:02,111 --> 01:52:06,160
privilege to even take place.
Now the problem is always singular.

2610
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:09,560
The problem is racism itself,
the racist themselves,

2611
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:12,040
the problem,
not that people aren't victim of the

2612
01:52:12,041 --> 01:52:14,110
individual,
not the collective and this is what the

2613
01:52:14,111 --> 01:52:17,700
left is doing that is literally
destroying culture and it destroyed.

2614
01:52:17,950 --> 01:52:21,610
We've man,
I think it's going to pull back just

2615
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:24,190
like waves always do.
I think there's cycles to things.

2616
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:27,850
I mean I think that's why we went from
the 60 to the seventies in the 70s to

2617
01:52:27,851 --> 01:52:29,920
the 80s I mean I think this is what I
mean.

2618
01:52:29,921 --> 01:52:34,921
It also responds to the condemnation of
psychedelic drugs and sweeping schedule.

2619
01:52:34,961 --> 01:52:38,980
One Act that passed in 1970 which was
directly attributable to the Richard

2620
01:52:38,980 --> 01:52:41,800
Nixon realizing that a lot of what was
going on while the people are coming

2621
01:52:41,801 --> 01:52:43,840
after him or part of the psychedelic
movement,

2622
01:52:44,080 --> 01:52:46,820
all these Republicans started like,
we've got to stop this.

2623
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:49,730
The psychedelic movement will destroy
our culture.

2624
01:52:49,731 --> 01:52:53,570
You go from this gold water republican
era to all the sudden you're dealing

2625
01:52:53,571 --> 01:52:56,480
with freaks and hippies and Jimi Hendrix
and Janice Joplin,

2626
01:52:56,481 --> 01:52:59,280
and they're like,
stop the fucking fire.

2627
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:01,730
They just threw as much water on it as
they could.

2628
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:06,620
It locked a bunch of people in jail and
they created laws that made marijuana in

2629
01:53:06,621 --> 01:53:09,980
particular and all these other drugs.
They demonize them so that they could go

2630
01:53:09,981 --> 01:53:12,770
after the civil rights movement that
people that were in charge of it,

2631
01:53:12,771 --> 01:53:16,400
they got them for drugs and so they
would go after all these different anti

2632
01:53:16,401 --> 01:53:19,460
war protest movements.
They would go after them for drugs too.

2633
01:53:19,461 --> 01:53:23,990
And that schedule one classification of
these things that weren't dangerous or

2634
01:53:23,991 --> 01:53:28,340
deadly or killing anyone was directly
attributable to a strategy where they

2635
01:53:28,341 --> 01:53:33,140
were going after people that opposed the
Vietnam war going after people that

2636
01:53:33,141 --> 01:53:36,860
impose the administration,
clearly lying to them about all sorts of

2637
01:53:36,861 --> 01:53:38,750
things.
And that was before they even knew that

2638
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:42,860
the Gulf of Tonkin was a false flag.
The original thing that got us into

2639
01:53:42,890 --> 01:53:45,260
Vietnam.
So there's so many,

2640
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:50,320
there's so much evidence that that this,
this way that people behave when they

2641
01:53:52,011 --> 01:53:54,080
suppress things that it has.

2642
01:53:54,110 --> 01:53:55,820
There's a direct response,
first of all.

2643
01:53:55,821 --> 01:53:56,930
I mean,
if you attack someone,

2644
01:53:56,931 --> 01:53:58,370
they're wounded,
they're damaged,

2645
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:01,520
and then they rise up and they'd go
after that attack.

2646
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:03,710
And that's what you're seeing with the
alt right.

2647
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:06,500
And I don't know if there,
I don't agree with him on a lot of

2648
01:54:06,501 --> 01:54:10,390
things they stand for,
but I recognize it almost as if I,

2649
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:11,540
I'm not objective,
right?

2650
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:12,650
I'm a person,
I'm a human being.

2651
01:54:12,651 --> 01:54:14,210
Like all of us,
I have my own shit.

2652
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:17,180
But if I was outside of it,
trying to look at it objectively,

2653
01:54:17,181 --> 01:54:17,601
I'm like,
oh,

2654
01:54:17,601 --> 01:54:19,850
this thing goes like this.
And then it goes like that and it goes

2655
01:54:19,851 --> 01:54:21,260
like,
it's like a fucking swing.

2656
01:54:21,460 --> 01:54:23,690
It's like a pendulum.
It's like a Yin and a Yang.

2657
01:54:23,691 --> 01:54:27,560
It comes in and it comes out.
And I think one of the things that's

2658
01:54:27,561 --> 01:54:31,430
happening with this alt right movement
and these people that are really super

2659
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:35,120
conservative and the build that fucking
wall build a fucking wall,

2660
01:54:35,450 --> 01:54:39,020
what you're dealing with is a response
to what they perceive to be.

2661
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:41,270
Too much openness from the Obama
administration.

2662
01:54:41,410 --> 01:54:44,300
This fucking look,
Obama care,

2663
01:54:44,301 --> 01:54:46,370
I don't know enough about it.
I don't,

2664
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:49,310
I don't know enough about it,
but I have friends that are doctors who

2665
01:54:49,311 --> 01:54:50,600
fucking,
hey,

2666
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:53,050
I got a friend in docker in Texas a and
they,

2667
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:58,010
and they spit when they talk to you and
they get red in the face and then they

2668
01:54:58,011 --> 01:54:59,960
have to stand back and take a drink.
I mean,

2669
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:03,620
I know people that lost a practice.
I know a chiropractor lost his practice

2670
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:05,600
because of it.
So I think there's,

2671
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:09,410
there's a lot of people that are upset
at anyone who's the president.

2672
01:55:09,530 --> 01:55:12,710
Anyone who's the president,
if you don't get fucking shot.

2673
01:55:12,890 --> 01:55:14,720
Miss is a joke that I have for my last
special.

2674
01:55:14,721 --> 01:55:16,850
Who Do we like?
Kennedy and Lincoln.

2675
01:55:17,150 --> 01:55:19,350
That's what you like,
but you didn't get shot in the head.

2676
01:55:19,351 --> 01:55:20,960
We were like,
you fucking sell out.

2677
01:55:21,260 --> 01:55:24,860
What did you do?
I think that that is just the natural

2678
01:55:24,861 --> 01:55:27,470
reaction when we always have,
and I think that's why we go left,

2679
01:55:27,471 --> 01:55:27,951
right.
Left,

2680
01:55:27,951 --> 01:55:30,260
right.
I don't think it's a coincidence that we

2681
01:55:30,261 --> 01:55:35,261
go right from George Bush to Bill
Clinton to George W.

2682
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:37,970
Bush.
I don't think that's a coincidence.

2683
01:55:37,971 --> 01:55:39,980
Yeah.
I mean I think that's a very clear

2684
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:40,910
response.
Or The com,

2685
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:42,650
the government's like,
Whoa,

2686
01:55:42,651 --> 01:55:44,190
now we're this.
And the people like,

2687
01:55:44,191 --> 01:55:46,380
well that doesn't fucking work either.
Let's try this.

2688
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:49,350
And then they swing back and forth.
Well then what do you make of what's

2689
01:55:49,351 --> 01:55:51,610
happening now?
[inaudible] she's very hockey.

2690
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:53,490
So you think it actually is a swing
back,

2691
01:55:53,491 --> 01:55:55,350
right?
I think there's two factors here.

2692
01:55:55,380 --> 01:55:58,350
There's the woman factor,
which is gigantic cause there's a lot of

2693
01:55:58,351 --> 01:56:01,450
women that vote and a lot of men are
fuck ups right there.

2694
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:04,470
They're probably going to vote.
I would imagine that women out vote men,

2695
01:56:04,950 --> 01:56:06,240
I really think they probably do.

2696
01:56:06,240 --> 01:56:07,650
I don't know.
I'm just totally guessing.

2697
01:56:07,680 --> 01:56:10,920
Let's find out Jamie.
But I would say that there's a slight

2698
01:56:10,921 --> 01:56:14,040
advantage.
I would say that maybe it'd be like 46

2699
01:56:14,041 --> 01:56:17,250
54 for women in favor of women that more
women vote.

2700
01:56:17,460 --> 01:56:21,330
But I think that you're,
you have also is,

2701
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:27,420
there's no good choice here.
So this is a very unique situation.

2702
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:32,480
You have this really strong anti woman
feeling that a lot of these gals get

2703
01:56:32,881 --> 01:56:34,500
from Donald Trump,
especially now.

2704
01:56:34,501 --> 01:56:35,490
Right?
There's that.

2705
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:39,810
There's the the again and that
conversation that he had on that bus,

2706
01:56:40,710 --> 01:56:44,100
I've heard way worse for some people
that I love and cherish very deeply and

2707
01:56:44,101 --> 01:56:46,920
they're trying to be funny and they're
saying fucked up things that are totally

2708
01:56:46,921 --> 01:56:49,440
ridiculous.
He grows and a lot of them are saying it

2709
01:56:49,441 --> 01:56:52,590
because it's just you and me and you and
me and we'll just talk some shit.

2710
01:56:52,620 --> 01:56:54,300
Yeah.
And I run a bus.

2711
01:56:54,330 --> 01:56:56,820
Words are not action.
And that's what people need.

2712
01:56:56,821 --> 01:56:58,770
Understand if he died,
there you go.

2713
01:56:58,771 --> 01:57:01,590
Women voted higher rates than men.
That might help Clinton in November.

2714
01:57:01,591 --> 01:57:02,490
See what the numbers,
yeah,

2715
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:06,450
there you go.
But it doesn't say it has different

2716
01:57:06,451 --> 01:57:08,170
numbers here.
Okay.

2717
01:57:08,880 --> 01:57:10,170
There's not an overall,
yeah,

2718
01:57:10,580 --> 01:57:12,780
no.
So the idea though,

2719
01:57:12,781 --> 01:57:16,110
that words are in action,
so I'm not defending the grab them by

2720
01:57:16,111 --> 01:57:16,921
the Pussy and blah,
blah,

2721
01:57:16,921 --> 01:57:18,360
blah.
And he was sort of saying that he had

2722
01:57:18,361 --> 01:57:19,240
done it in the past.
So if,

2723
01:57:19,350 --> 01:57:23,610
if there had been evidence that he had
done those actions actually assaulted,

2724
01:57:23,770 --> 01:57:26,700
which is no evidence unless you know a
women's vaginas not made out of

2725
01:57:26,770 --> 01:57:28,760
playdough.
It's not like fingerprints that are

2726
01:57:28,770 --> 01:57:30,150
permanent forever,
you know,

2727
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:32,430
so that's fully legit.
But you can't prosecute him for just

2728
01:57:32,431 --> 01:57:34,950
saying.
That's my point is that words he said

2729
01:57:34,951 --> 01:57:36,210
some shit that was gross.

2730
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:37,740
Right.
But it might have been true.

2731
01:57:37,810 --> 01:57:39,780
Yeah,
true.

2732
01:57:39,930 --> 01:57:42,120
So words and actions are two different
things.

2733
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:43,980
Now maybe you can't prove those things
cause yeah,

2734
01:57:44,130 --> 01:57:48,390
they're not made out of play dough.
But that's still until it's provable.

2735
01:57:48,870 --> 01:57:51,360
You can't,
you can get outraged by it.

2736
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:53,460
I see.
I see your point with the problem is

2737
01:57:53,461 --> 01:57:57,780
that just relying completely on the
burden of evidence being like physical

2738
01:57:57,781 --> 01:58:00,240
proof.
You're dealing with an act of people

2739
01:58:00,241 --> 01:58:02,250
touching each other's bodies and it's
just,

2740
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:04,080
there's not a whole lot of proof when it
comes to that.

2741
01:58:04,081 --> 01:58:06,450
So I agree with that.
But then what do you do and where does

2742
01:58:06,451 --> 01:58:09,690
that put us?
Because we know that some people when

2743
01:58:09,691 --> 01:58:12,930
they,
when they give a a rape allegation,

2744
01:58:13,020 --> 01:58:16,410
you know,
we know that there's gonna be a lot of

2745
01:58:16,411 --> 01:58:19,510
people that are telling you the absolute
truth as they remember it.

2746
01:58:19,950 --> 01:58:22,620
There's also going to be crazy people
that make things up.

2747
01:58:22,800 --> 01:58:25,860
There's going to be some spectrum in
between those two things.

2748
01:58:26,140 --> 01:58:29,010
Where are you going to have people that
exaggerate situations that I'm sure

2749
01:58:29,011 --> 01:58:31,680
you've had any conversations that you've
had with people that maybe you've had a

2750
01:58:31,681 --> 01:58:34,590
disagreement and they go to someone else
and they completely reframed a

2751
01:58:34,591 --> 01:58:35,990
disagreement,
like you're a piece of shit.

2752
01:58:36,390 --> 01:58:39,570
It's a common thing that people do.
We love to do it and we love to do it

2753
01:58:39,571 --> 01:58:41,650
for all kinds of things.
And I've been guilty of it and I'm sure

2754
01:58:41,651 --> 01:58:45,970
you have and everybody listening to this
thing I'm sure as we are learning the

2755
01:58:45,971 --> 01:58:49,720
very complicated game of communication
with human beings and how much is

2756
01:58:49,721 --> 01:58:53,140
involved in it,
the ego and personality conflicts and

2757
01:58:53,141 --> 01:58:56,050
where you are in your life and your own
stresses and frustrations and whenever

2758
01:58:56,051 --> 01:58:58,930
the fuck is going on,
whatever is going on in this big

2759
01:58:58,931 --> 01:59:00,670
struggle that we're all involved in,
right?

2760
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:05,920
W there's not always a very clear
perception of how events went down.

2761
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:08,410
Yeah.
So see you have to take that into

2762
01:59:08,411 --> 01:59:10,610
consideration.
You also have to take any consideration

2763
01:59:10,630 --> 01:59:11,860
the fact they might be telling the
truth.

2764
01:59:11,890 --> 01:59:15,520
We do not know.
So it's not that there's no evidence

2765
01:59:15,610 --> 01:59:18,070
because there's people that are talking,
it's just,

2766
01:59:18,071 --> 01:59:22,300
it's nothing you can put on a scale and
we don't know how to read minds yet.

2767
01:59:22,301 --> 01:59:24,280
And the problem is if you read minds,
man,

2768
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,770
right,
I find some fucking memories of things.

2769
01:59:26,771 --> 01:59:29,480
Then I went back and looked at them
again like a video or something.

2770
01:59:29,481 --> 01:59:30,131
And I'm like,
wow,

2771
01:59:30,131 --> 01:59:32,320
I didn't even know when to,
they're like,

2772
01:59:32,350 --> 01:59:35,590
we just went over that the other day I
was talking about Tommy hearns versus

2773
01:59:35,591 --> 01:59:36,910
Marvin Hagler.
She's like,

2774
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:39,460
one of my all time favorite fights.
I would have swore it was a second round

2775
01:59:39,461 --> 01:59:40,170
knockout.

2776
01:59:40,170 --> 01:59:41,350
No,
they went to a third round.

2777
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:42,880
Hagwon knocked him out in the third
round.

2778
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:44,590
I'm like,
how the fuck did it in my mind,

2779
01:59:44,591 --> 01:59:47,140
I would have told you,
I'll bet you $1,000.

2780
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:50,710
It was the second round and I was wrong.
I remembered it.

2781
01:59:50,830 --> 01:59:52,900
I remembered it wrong.
There was moments in the fight with the

2782
01:59:52,901 --> 01:59:56,740
fights playing out and this is something
that doesn't have any attachment to me

2783
01:59:56,741 --> 01:59:57,910
in my life.
Obviously.

2784
01:59:57,911 --> 02:00:01,750
I'm not like saying that someone's going
to throw in memory.

2785
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:04,000
I'm not,
especially someone who is involved in

2786
02:00:04,001 --> 02:00:06,490
some sort of a violent crime where the
victim,

2787
02:00:06,550 --> 02:00:09,690
you know,
I don't know because I think it's gotta

2788
02:00:09,700 --> 02:00:13,660
be absolutely horrific and it's entirely
possible that some people can go through

2789
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:16,870
an assault or a crime like that and
remember everything.

2790
02:00:17,110 --> 02:00:20,590
And then there's other people that
cannot cause people that even black out

2791
02:00:20,620 --> 02:00:25,000
horrible things because the memory is so
disturbing to them that they have to,

2792
02:00:25,460 --> 02:00:26,950
they,
they blocked them out.

2793
02:00:26,950 --> 02:00:31,060
Especially molestations a lot of people
go through that later in life when they

2794
02:00:31,061 --> 02:00:33,280
realize like what they were trying to
suppress.

2795
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:37,930
Your brain is like literally trying to
save you from these memories because

2796
02:00:37,931 --> 02:00:40,810
they're too fucking painful.
So what it does is it buries them,

2797
02:00:41,170 --> 02:00:42,910
I don't know how it works,
they don't understand it,

2798
02:00:42,911 --> 02:00:45,100
but this is real.
Then people suddenly at 40 they go,

2799
02:00:45,101 --> 02:00:47,440
wait a minute is a proven effect.
It's a proven effect.

2800
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:49,870
So there's all these things that we need
to take into consideration.

2801
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:54,730
I think there's also the very real
cultural benefit of having our first

2802
02:00:54,731 --> 02:00:57,210
woman president.
I think culturally what I do,

2803
02:00:57,211 --> 02:01:00,970
I just don't think that she's a good
representative in terms of like her need

2804
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:05,971
for financial compensation for speeches
and the Goldman Sachs connection and the

2805
02:01:07,181 --> 02:01:11,080
connection to the Saudis.
I also don't have a fucking clue as to

2806
02:01:11,081 --> 02:01:13,850
what it's like to deal with foreign
policy and foreign leaders.

2807
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:16,060
And I don't know.
I don't know if that's even a voidable

2808
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:17,200
but that's the thing.
It's like,

2809
02:01:17,201 --> 02:01:17,771
you know,
people will say,

2810
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:19,990
well the,
the she's in bed with the Saudis or

2811
02:01:19,991 --> 02:01:20,771
something.
Well guess what?

2812
02:01:20,771 --> 02:01:22,300
The Saudis,
whether we like it or not,

2813
02:01:22,301 --> 02:01:25,630
who do horrific things and explored all
kinds of Wahhabi Islam and real

2814
02:01:25,631 --> 02:01:29,950
extremism and or bombing the shit out of
Yemen and with our weapons and all kinds

2815
02:01:29,951 --> 02:01:32,110
of stuff.
Well she also took $1 million from

2816
02:01:32,111 --> 02:01:36,010
Qatar.
Qatar right now is using slave labor to

2817
02:01:36,011 --> 02:01:39,200
build their World Cup stadium,
which there may not even get the World

2818
02:01:39,200 --> 02:01:40,100
Cup.
So

2819
02:01:40,520 --> 02:01:42,920
it's like every,
why did they give her $1 million?

2820
02:01:42,921 --> 02:01:44,330
It's for something.
You know what I mean?

2821
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:47,390
It's not for nothing.
You don't give $1 million for no reason.

2822
02:01:47,630 --> 02:01:49,190
So,
but that again goes to like,

2823
02:01:49,191 --> 02:01:51,440
we're seeing how all this shit is made
right now.

2824
02:01:51,620 --> 02:01:54,980
And the simple fact is if you're upset
that she has a close relationship with

2825
02:01:54,981 --> 02:01:57,740
the Saudis,
then you got to hate Obama for it to

2826
02:01:58,010 --> 02:02:00,020
where I think a lot of these people are
letting that slide.

2827
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:01,910
I'm,
I'm not even making a judgment call on

2828
02:02:01,911 --> 02:02:05,210
it as much to say is this,
there are things that are going on at

2829
02:02:05,211 --> 02:02:09,170
extremely high levels for governments
and that we just have to try to decipher

2830
02:02:09,171 --> 02:02:11,930
some truth to it because we're not going
to get another way.

2831
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:13,490
Saudi Arabia,
women can't drive.

2832
02:02:13,670 --> 02:02:15,710
They can barely go out without men.
They are stuck in,

2833
02:02:15,711 --> 02:02:18,620
as Bill Maher says,
beekeeper costumes in the Burkas,

2834
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:20,240
right?
I mean all of these things,

2835
02:02:20,540 --> 02:02:22,760
well,
how could they possibly be our ally if

2836
02:02:22,761 --> 02:02:25,520
we're for women,
if Barack Obama is for women,

2837
02:02:25,521 --> 02:02:29,330
if Hillary Clinton is for women,
how is Saudi Arabia one of our most

2838
02:02:29,331 --> 02:02:32,180
stable allies that we give a ton of
money too,

2839
02:02:32,450 --> 02:02:33,710
if,
if that's what it is.

2840
02:02:33,810 --> 02:02:38,810
The only thing that I would take into
consideration is that if I was trying to

2841
02:02:39,091 --> 02:02:42,630
figure this out as an outsider,
I would see there's gotta be some

2842
02:02:42,631 --> 02:02:47,631
benefit to keeping people like that
connected to you and obligated to

2843
02:02:48,241 --> 02:02:51,180
communicate with you and oils and your
friend,

2844
02:02:51,460 --> 02:02:54,630
but not just the oil.
Also some other publishing,

2845
02:02:54,690 --> 02:02:58,080
a non combative relationship with a
very,

2846
02:02:58,081 --> 02:03:02,670
very wealthy Middle East country that
they're more could be done with honey

2847
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:03,840
than with vinegar.
You know,

2848
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:06,030
this idea of being connected with those
people,

2849
02:03:06,031 --> 02:03:09,750
there might be some sort of a benefit
because they're so alien to us and

2850
02:03:09,751 --> 02:03:12,120
they're so dominant in their control
over their environment.

2851
02:03:12,480 --> 02:03:15,000
Like you look at these dictators in this
foreign,

2852
02:03:15,030 --> 02:03:17,670
these foreign countries that we
supported for so many years and you can

2853
02:03:17,671 --> 02:03:20,700
make the argument that they're horrible,
absolutely terrible people that we

2854
02:03:20,701 --> 02:03:21,720
should have nothing to do with.

2855
02:03:22,200 --> 02:03:26,160
You could also make the argument that
that part of the world is so fucked up

2856
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:31,170
that you have to somehow or another
maintain some sort of friendly

2857
02:03:31,171 --> 02:03:33,030
connection to the people that are in
power.

2858
02:03:33,480 --> 02:03:36,360
And then that might be the best way to
keep everybody safe.

2859
02:03:36,420 --> 02:03:38,970
While we figured out a fucking strategy,
how to deal with religious

2860
02:03:38,971 --> 02:03:40,960
fundamentalist,
crazy people that literally have

2861
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:44,400
trillions of dollars at their disposal
to do anything they want from the

2862
02:03:44,401 --> 02:03:45,234
Saudis.
By yes,

2863
02:03:45,270 --> 02:03:49,200
but not just from the Saudis.
I mean there's a gigantic chunk of the

2864
02:03:49,200 --> 02:03:53,070
Middle East that has so much money,
it's incomprehensible and not everyone,

2865
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,040
just a few people,
oligarchy,

2866
02:03:55,080 --> 02:03:57,200
monarchs and these people that have
looked at,

2867
02:03:57,201 --> 02:04:00,000
in Abu Dhabi,
they make it rain every week.

2868
02:04:00,180 --> 02:04:01,560
They make it rain.
Literally.

2869
02:04:01,561 --> 02:04:06,390
They literally see the sky to do cloud
seeding and they make it rain like it's

2870
02:04:06,391 --> 02:04:09,090
the desert and they use their money to
make it rain.

2871
02:04:09,091 --> 02:04:12,030
Like not a strip club and you're not
using one

2872
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:14,620
is that wasn't hyperbole.
It was actual real well,

2873
02:04:14,621 --> 02:04:17,380
think about Egypt is the best example of
what you're talking about because Egypt

2874
02:04:17,381 --> 02:04:19,390
for 30 years had Mubarak,
this was a guy,

2875
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:22,030
he was a military guy backed by the
United States.

2876
02:04:22,180 --> 02:04:25,300
Horrible on on a human rights and all
that other stuff.

2877
02:04:25,420 --> 02:04:29,260
But he kept control of the country,
basically kept their borders,

2878
02:04:29,261 --> 02:04:32,890
kept peace with Israel,
basically kept things under control.

2879
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:36,730
I was in Egypt in 97 and it was pretty
disgusting actually.

2880
02:04:36,731 --> 02:04:38,000
Even go to the pyramids.
It was the,

2881
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:40,390
the pollution was terrible.
Uh,

2882
02:04:40,440 --> 02:04:43,590
it was the people weren't friendly.
Like I would love to go back.

2883
02:04:43,600 --> 02:04:45,830
I have a friend there now who I,
uh,

2884
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:49,020
who's a youtube or this Guy Joe,
who probably will show his face.

2885
02:04:49,021 --> 02:04:51,450
He's an atheist and a free thinker.
Um,

2886
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:52,680
if I could ever get him to the United
States,

2887
02:04:52,681 --> 02:04:53,250
you should have me enter.

2888
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:54,450
The guy's really,
he's great.

2889
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:59,280
Freely and openly and Egypt.
Sometimes he disappears for months and

2890
02:04:59,281 --> 02:05:02,760
then the side,
he doesn't really publicly say exactly

2891
02:05:02,761 --> 02:05:05,340
what he's doing.
But when I had him on the show,

2892
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:06,151
I said to him,
you know,

2893
02:05:06,151 --> 02:05:08,670
if you want to wear a spiderman mask,
you don't have to show your face.

2894
02:05:08,700 --> 02:05:09,780
You know,
you do whatever you want.

2895
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:11,310
And he said,
no,

2896
02:05:11,311 --> 02:05:13,140
I want to show my face.
So anyway,

2897
02:05:13,141 --> 02:05:15,510
they had Mubarak for 30 years.
He kept the Muslim Brotherhood.

2898
02:05:15,511 --> 02:05:18,090
They were illegal under the time.
Then they have the Tahrir Square,

2899
02:05:18,330 --> 02:05:20,070
a revolution.
What happens?

2900
02:05:20,071 --> 02:05:20,960
They,
we deposed,

2901
02:05:20,970 --> 02:05:23,640
we partly,
they depose Mubarak,

2902
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:26,340
they get the Muslim Brotherhood through
democracy,

2903
02:05:26,610 --> 02:05:29,160
and then a year later they realize these
guys are way worse.

2904
02:05:29,161 --> 02:05:31,560
So what they got from democracy was way
worse.

2905
02:05:31,561 --> 02:05:35,520
So then what happens?
The military then steps in and then has

2906
02:05:35,521 --> 02:05:39,720
a coup overthrows the democracy.
And now they have a military leader

2907
02:05:39,721 --> 02:05:42,090
again,
United States the entire time to support

2908
02:05:42,091 --> 02:05:42,924
it.
All of that.

2909
02:05:43,170 --> 02:05:45,480
So it's like,
this is the problem with democracy.

2910
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:48,750
And we know this from Iraq too.
It's like you can give democracy,

2911
02:05:48,751 --> 02:05:51,690
but if the institutions aren't there
ready to support it,

2912
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:54,600
you could get a lot of bad people then.
And then

2913
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,670
it's over like what the Hell's going on?
And you mentioned Bengazi before we got

2914
02:05:59,671 --> 02:06:01,800
rid of Qaddafi who was obviously a bad
dude.

2915
02:06:02,310 --> 02:06:03,980
You have any idea what kind of
government there isn't it

2916
02:06:04,030 --> 02:06:06,280
fear right now?
Nobody knows is a scary state.

2917
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:08,650
That's a state of chaos,
right?

2918
02:06:08,680 --> 02:06:12,850
So it was a state,
but you're more aware of uh,

2919
02:06:13,210 --> 02:06:18,210
Amber Lyon and a amber Lyon when she was
working for CNN and she did a piece on

2920
02:06:18,521 --> 02:06:21,250
bowel rain.
No notice I said bow rain like an

2921
02:06:21,251 --> 02:06:24,010
American,
not Bahrain Lane.

2922
02:06:24,770 --> 02:06:26,710
Um,
thank you for dumbing that down for me.

2923
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:30,370
It's not that I just don't want to be
pretentious and puts born to check what

2924
02:06:30,371 --> 02:06:32,620
Obama says.
Bucky stun Pakistan.

2925
02:06:32,621 --> 02:06:35,140
Yeah.
Or Latinos or Latinos.

2926
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:37,940
Well now you have to say Latin ex so
that you're not,

2927
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:41,750
it's not Latino's that implies men or
Latino women.

2928
02:06:41,751 --> 02:06:43,630
Now you say Latin X.
Cause if you're a fucking,

2929
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:47,830
why don't we call ourselves to Max?
I said a humanz genetics.

2930
02:06:47,950 --> 02:06:48,680
I like it.
I'm know.

2931
02:06:48,680 --> 02:06:50,970
Humanics that sounds dope.
Yeah.

2932
02:06:51,240 --> 02:06:51,721
Um,
what,

2933
02:06:51,721 --> 02:06:54,490
what kind of species are there?
Humanics yeah,

2934
02:06:54,510 --> 02:06:55,930
sounds like male,
female and female.

2935
02:06:55,931 --> 02:06:56,764
Who?
Max.

2936
02:06:56,840 --> 02:06:57,673
Whew,
man.

2937
02:06:57,700 --> 02:06:58,660
Right.
It's so rude.

2938
02:06:58,690 --> 02:07:00,040
It's rude.
Why not you?

2939
02:07:00,070 --> 02:07:01,420
Whoa man,
man.

2940
02:07:01,421 --> 02:07:04,060
When history,
what about her story?

2941
02:07:04,360 --> 02:07:05,260
I mean,
come on Joe.

2942
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:06,070
Yeah,
man.

2943
02:07:06,070 --> 02:07:08,410
What about her story?
So amber lions,

2944
02:07:08,411 --> 02:07:10,660
because of her stories,
she does this,

2945
02:07:10,810 --> 02:07:15,280
um,
investigative piece on Bahrain and a CNN

2946
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:20,230
completely turns it into like a vacation
and tourism commercial and they cut out

2947
02:07:20,231 --> 02:07:22,810
all the bad stuff aired it.
And uh,

2948
02:07:23,020 --> 02:07:24,340
I don't remember if she did.
Jamie,

2949
02:07:24,341 --> 02:07:26,710
do you remember she got fired if she
went up resigning,

2950
02:07:27,280 --> 02:07:31,810
do you remember anyway?
Um,

2951
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,390
that sounds like a resigning.
It was.

2952
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:36,790
I don't if she was fired.
If she resigned.

2953
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:37,990
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

2954
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:39,730
I don't remember.
But the point is,

2955
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:42,790
she came on my podcast,
she wrote a book.

2956
02:07:43,150 --> 02:07:44,710
Um,
and um,

2957
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:48,780
she sort of explained like what,
what would really go on when you tried

2958
02:07:48,781 --> 02:07:50,620
to put together these pieces and you
know,

2959
02:07:50,621 --> 02:07:51,060
in,
in,

2960
02:07:51,060 --> 02:07:52,540
in defense of CNN,
they,

2961
02:07:52,541 --> 02:07:55,420
I know they had a rebuttal to what she
said and they disagreed with her,

2962
02:07:55,450 --> 02:07:57,790
her framing of it,
her memory of it,

2963
02:07:57,810 --> 02:07:58,643
you know,
I don't know,

2964
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:02,800
but it sounds to me like whatever stuff
that she found that was very

2965
02:08:02,801 --> 02:08:05,920
questionable did not make the air.
And that's probably why.

2966
02:08:05,950 --> 02:08:10,950
I mean there was the CIA's talked pretty
openly about having people that work in

2967
02:08:11,021 --> 02:08:14,320
different news organizations where they
sort of framed the news.

2968
02:08:14,800 --> 02:08:15,521
Yeah.
Well look,

2969
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:17,620
that goes to everything we've been
talking about this,

2970
02:08:17,621 --> 02:08:22,300
it all seems to be coming back to this
idea of the online world and the old

2971
02:08:22,301 --> 02:08:25,240
school thing,
they're like starting to have parody now

2972
02:08:25,241 --> 02:08:27,700
where what we're doing is as an
influential,

2973
02:08:27,701 --> 02:08:30,040
you,
Joe Rogan is more influential than

2974
02:08:30,041 --> 02:08:32,140
anybody on CNN in reality.

2975
02:08:32,170 --> 02:08:33,760
In the reality of,
yeah,

2976
02:08:33,761 --> 02:08:36,670
but not a Fox News.
That man,

2977
02:08:36,850 --> 02:08:38,180
she,
Megan Kelly,

2978
02:08:38,181 --> 02:08:39,280
so hot.
If you weren't gay,

2979
02:08:39,281 --> 02:08:40,390
Dude,
do you understand?

2980
02:08:40,420 --> 02:08:42,400
Still do it well,
it's still doing so hot.

2981
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:44,740
She is.
She's so something violent about her.

2982
02:08:45,550 --> 02:08:47,740
God Damn.
Something violent like masculine.

2983
02:08:47,741 --> 02:08:49,600
Like you would think of her as a man.
So she,

2984
02:08:49,601 --> 02:08:51,880
I feel like she has a big Dick.
Wow.

2985
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:54,410
Isn't it her brain though?
It's in her breakdown.

2986
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:59,260
Externalizes oh yeah.
You know they're trying to give her $20

2987
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:02,160
million and she hasn't accepted yet or
you go girl,

2988
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:05,350
get that 40 you get 40 it's fucking
worth it.

2989
02:09:05,351 --> 02:09:07,570
The networks useless without you
wherever she goes.

2990
02:09:07,571 --> 02:09:09,160
I'm watching.
Isn't that crazy though?

2991
02:09:09,161 --> 02:09:11,730
I mean,
think about it like 20 million bucks.

2992
02:09:11,750 --> 02:09:13,340
Skipped perfect cheeks.
She does.

2993
02:09:13,380 --> 02:09:15,910
She does.
She deserves it.

2994
02:09:16,510 --> 02:09:18,190
She's very good talk.
She's good man.

2995
02:09:18,191 --> 02:09:20,100
She's very eloquent.
Did you see that thing that you went,

2996
02:09:20,110 --> 02:09:21,340
went at it with Newt Gingrich?

2997
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:23,680
Newt Gingrich is a fucker,
isn't he?

2998
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:24,940
He's,
you know,

2999
02:09:24,941 --> 02:09:27,120
I have a little bit of a love hate thing
with them cause I do the,

3000
02:09:27,121 --> 02:09:29,190
he's really smart.
He's very smart guy.

3001
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:30,640
He's really smart.
He understands.

3002
02:09:30,641 --> 02:09:34,060
Like when I talked before about like
knowing what the role of government is

3003
02:09:34,061 --> 02:09:36,700
and all that stuff that we should know
more about in civics and all that.

3004
02:09:36,701 --> 02:09:40,390
Like that guy gets it in and out and
whether you agree with his politics or

3005
02:09:40,391 --> 02:09:42,800
not,
he did do some stuff with the contract

3006
02:09:42,801 --> 02:09:44,800
with America to with America to,
you know,

3007
02:09:44,801 --> 02:09:47,410
move the country in a certain way.
I'm actually surprised he hasn't run for

3008
02:09:47,411 --> 02:09:50,350
president.
Well he ran four years ago and they

3009
02:09:50,351 --> 02:09:52,780
basically remember at that point when
it's right.

3010
02:09:52,781 --> 02:09:54,940
That was the whole thing with his wife
and he left,

3011
02:09:54,941 --> 02:09:59,941
his wife was sick and had another bra.
In a weird way he was the precursor to

3012
02:10:01,061 --> 02:10:04,390
trump because you remembered that during
those primaries he would be,

3013
02:10:04,391 --> 02:10:06,070
you know,
he was really good with zingers and with

3014
02:10:06,071 --> 02:10:09,730
some comedy and he would get the
audience to applaud and cheer and boo

3015
02:10:10,030 --> 02:10:13,240
talking about the media,
the media and they boo and hiss and then

3016
02:10:13,241 --> 02:10:17,110
suddenly the moderators started saying
every time there'll be no booing or

3017
02:10:17,111 --> 02:10:19,600
applauding or,
and it's like sit there like a fucking

3018
02:10:19,601 --> 02:10:20,140
robot.

3019
02:10:20,140 --> 02:10:22,440
It's 1984 and eight press here.
Just stay.

3020
02:10:22,470 --> 02:10:24,950
That's American.
It's American.

3021
02:10:25,030 --> 02:10:28,270
They do it now in the debates door.
There'll be silence.

3022
02:10:28,271 --> 02:10:28,930
You know?
It's like,

3023
02:10:28,930 --> 02:10:31,240
cause she'd be in jail.
Remember that?

3024
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:32,180
Yeah.
Oh,

3025
02:10:32,290 --> 02:10:34,100
you'd be in jail cause it should be in
jail.

3026
02:10:35,600 --> 02:10:38,540
That was in my mind,
the best bomb ever dropped on a

3027
02:10:38,541 --> 02:10:41,240
presidential debate next to I knew Jack
Kennedy.

3028
02:10:41,640 --> 02:10:43,520
You're no jacket.
Remember that?

3029
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:46,400
Against Dan Quayle.
We don't even remember who the other

3030
02:10:46,401 --> 02:10:48,140
dude is.
Lloyd Benson.

3031
02:10:49,010 --> 02:10:50,230
Lloyd Benson.
Yeah.

3032
02:10:50,510 --> 02:10:51,410
Yeah,
man.

3033
02:10:51,950 --> 02:10:54,770
Politics.
That seems like something else.

3034
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:57,610
You talked about parallel universe.
It doesn't that I watched,

3035
02:10:57,611 --> 02:10:59,090
this is going to sound,
this is going to be corny as hell,

3036
02:10:59,091 --> 02:11:01,850
but about two weeks ago I was sitting a
Saturday.

3037
02:11:01,851 --> 02:11:03,260
If you're going,
I'm just flipping the channels.

3038
02:11:03,470 --> 02:11:08,450
Cspan comes on and they're replaying the
1992 debate between George Hw Bush.

3039
02:11:08,451 --> 02:11:12,410
Bill Clinton running for the first time
and Perot and I watched about a half

3040
02:11:12,410 --> 02:11:14,360
hour of it,
I think three o'clock on a Saturday and

3041
02:11:14,361 --> 02:11:16,280
he really was like being in an alternate
universe.

3042
02:11:16,310 --> 02:11:19,550
It felt so different.
They were actually talking about

3043
02:11:19,670 --> 02:11:22,560
economics or Ross Perot with is try and
I'm going to do this and we don't know.

3044
02:11:22,561 --> 02:11:24,000
You're kind of me and Wilma and bill.
Good.

3045
02:11:24,001 --> 02:11:25,670
Oh I do.
And it was like wow.

3046
02:11:26,240 --> 02:11:28,730
There was actual,
it was about politics.

3047
02:11:29,210 --> 02:11:32,390
Maybe it was completely fucked up.
Maybe it was all bullshit and lies and

3048
02:11:32,391 --> 02:11:35,090
all that stuff,
but it was about politics and that was

3049
02:11:35,091 --> 02:11:36,380
only,
what is that?

3050
02:11:36,381 --> 02:11:38,570
That's 20 years ago basically.
Yeah.

3051
02:11:38,571 --> 02:11:42,230
This is a different era.
This is the reality TV show air.

3052
02:11:42,290 --> 02:11:44,300
You know,
I used to have this joke that I never

3053
02:11:44,301 --> 02:11:47,000
figured out how to get to work,
but it's sort of just an observation

3054
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:50,720
that there's so many people with shows
where there's just a pr like this is

3055
02:11:50,730 --> 02:11:54,440
like when Jersey shore was around,
like we're going to have a show one day

3056
02:11:54,441 --> 02:11:57,620
where it's going to be a reality show
about a reality camera man.

3057
02:11:57,950 --> 02:11:59,450
And then we're going,
why?

3058
02:11:59,570 --> 02:12:02,510
We're going to follow that guy around as
he goes to all these exotic places and

3059
02:12:02,511 --> 02:12:04,430
films,
these people getting drunk on the beach.

3060
02:12:04,760 --> 02:12:07,730
And then one day we're going to want to
know who's the man behind the camera,

3061
02:12:07,731 --> 02:12:10,280
behind the man behind the camera and
then we're going to follow that guy

3062
02:12:10,281 --> 02:12:11,870
around.
He's going to get a reality show is

3063
02:12:11,871 --> 02:12:15,140
going to be a reality show about a
camera man who's on a reality show about

3064
02:12:15,141 --> 02:12:17,120
a camera man who's a reality.
Show.

3065
02:12:17,121 --> 02:12:22,121
Cameramen deeper and deeper and deeper
until the whole world is filled with

3066
02:12:22,281 --> 02:12:25,760
people on a reality show while they're
holding up a camera like two mirrors

3067
02:12:25,761 --> 02:12:28,670
facing themselves with infinite camera
man in each direction.

3068
02:12:29,120 --> 02:12:31,730
That's what we have right now.
I mean there's some good weed.

3069
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:34,150
Well this is what we have though is
good,

3070
02:12:34,151 --> 02:12:35,900
but that's a,
it's an old bit that I never figured out

3071
02:12:35,901 --> 02:12:38,870
how to get to work,
but the point being is like this is what

3072
02:12:38,871 --> 02:12:39,980
we're experiencing.

3073
02:12:40,190 --> 02:12:42,110
This is what we're experiencing with
phones.

3074
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:46,310
Like it's,
it might not be on a network on a bravo

3075
02:12:46,311 --> 02:12:49,580
coming up next at eight it's Mike the
camera man on a reality show.

3076
02:12:49,880 --> 02:12:54,200
It doesn't have to be by a network.
It is what you're having with something

3077
02:12:54,201 --> 02:12:56,850
like periscope.
It is what you're having when people are

3078
02:12:56,851 --> 02:12:58,490
alive,
facebook streaming from,

3079
02:12:58,550 --> 02:13:00,170
you know,
amusement parks or whatever the fuck

3080
02:13:00,171 --> 02:13:01,700
they're doing.
It's a reality show.

3081
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:02,960
How do you,
how do you blend,

3082
02:13:02,961 --> 02:13:07,580
how much of your Joe Rogan,
actual human versus Joe Rogan,

3083
02:13:07,581 --> 02:13:08,870
the public person,
how do you,

3084
02:13:08,871 --> 02:13:13,470
where do you put that line in terms of
periscoping from home or showing I don't

3085
02:13:13,471 --> 02:13:15,440
do this stuff because they're not
public.

3086
02:13:15,441 --> 02:13:17,960
People know my wife and kids aren't
public people.

3087
02:13:17,980 --> 02:13:18,890
Yeah.
They don't want to be,

3088
02:13:18,891 --> 02:13:20,600
they're just regular people.
Just because they know me,

3089
02:13:20,601 --> 02:13:23,180
it doesn't mean I should drag them into
this nonsense.

3090
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:29,350
I just think all of us could do better
with a little less interaction

3091
02:13:30,321 --> 02:13:33,480
digitally.
I think it's happening so fast that,

3092
02:13:33,690 --> 02:13:35,130
you know,
like we're talking about people at

3093
02:13:35,131 --> 02:13:39,120
restaurants that are constantly on their
phone and when you check them on it,

3094
02:13:39,150 --> 02:13:40,620
they get upset.
I've been upset.

3095
02:13:40,890 --> 02:13:42,210
People telling me to put my phone down,
I'm like,

3096
02:13:42,211 --> 02:13:43,110
I got to do this.
Yeah,

3097
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:44,820
it's normal.
It's natural reaction.

3098
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:46,470
I think we have,
I think,

3099
02:13:46,471 --> 02:13:50,400
um,
all of us are going to eventually though

3100
02:13:50,401 --> 02:13:55,401
step into that great divide and the
future is going to be everybody all the

3101
02:13:56,731 --> 02:13:58,620
time connected to everybody all the
time.

3102
02:13:58,621 --> 02:14:01,530
And it's going to be very weird.
It's going to change thought.

3103
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:04,740
I think it's going to,
I think we really are going to become

3104
02:14:04,741 --> 02:14:07,350
like some sort of a bizarre hive mind.
Well they do.

3105
02:14:07,351 --> 02:14:09,720
They've done studies where the Internet
already,

3106
02:14:09,721 --> 02:14:12,320
when they look at Internet addicts that
they find that the,

3107
02:14:12,470 --> 02:14:15,090
the wiring in their brain actually has
changed.

3108
02:14:15,091 --> 02:14:19,380
It's changed certain synapse.
It's actually caused like membranes to

3109
02:14:19,381 --> 02:14:21,660
shrink into all kinds of stuff.
Last,

3110
02:14:21,661 --> 02:14:24,810
uh,
I think it was may I for eight days and

3111
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:26,280
I never,
I'd never take off.

3112
02:14:26,281 --> 02:14:28,170
I don't remember the last time I took
like some actual time of,

3113
02:14:28,171 --> 02:14:30,570
I took eight days off,
went to Mexico.

3114
02:14:30,600 --> 02:14:32,640
I locked my phone in a safe,
whoa.

3115
02:14:33,090 --> 02:14:34,980
We're actually,
my husband did it lock the phone in the

3116
02:14:34,981 --> 02:14:37,170
safe.
I did not know the code word for eight

3117
02:14:37,171 --> 02:14:38,580
days.
I sat on a beach.

3118
02:14:38,610 --> 02:14:39,660
It was at like an Olympian.

3119
02:14:41,700 --> 02:14:44,880
It was like a digital moderately,
the dirtiest thing we've ever done.

3120
02:14:47,980 --> 02:14:49,860
Do you want that phone?
It was really,

3121
02:14:49,861 --> 02:14:51,200
it was why.
Um,

3122
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:53,850
but for eight days I had no phone and I
kid you not,

3123
02:14:53,851 --> 02:14:56,550
I mean I felt my brain kind of
resetting.

3124
02:14:57,130 --> 02:14:59,250
I felt some things happening and also I
felt more,

3125
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,560
I felt more patient.
I felt like,

3126
02:15:01,561 --> 02:15:03,000
you know,
in conversations where,

3127
02:15:03,180 --> 02:15:03,991
you know,
not like this,

3128
02:15:03,991 --> 02:15:07,170
but where you're constantly just
distracted by every little thing.

3129
02:15:07,171 --> 02:15:10,680
Like I got away from it and then when I
got back on the grid,

3130
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:12,300
you know,
because immediately the second I got off

3131
02:15:12,301 --> 02:15:13,170
the plane and I was,
you know,

3132
02:15:13,200 --> 02:15:14,520
doing my thing,
I realize,

3133
02:15:14,521 --> 02:15:14,941
wow,
you know,

3134
02:15:14,941 --> 02:15:17,280
the world went on and it was all right.
It was actually okay.

3135
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:18,210
Yeah.
I missed some shit.

3136
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:20,490
Something,
something happened on my show that took,

3137
02:15:20,491 --> 02:15:21,510
that got a lot of news.

3138
02:15:21,690 --> 02:15:24,180
I didn't know about it for eight days,
but like,

3139
02:15:25,080 --> 02:15:26,790
yeah,
it was just like some shit happened.

3140
02:15:27,450 --> 02:15:28,283
Yeah.
I,

3141
02:15:28,630 --> 02:15:29,700
I mean,
like I said,

3142
02:15:29,730 --> 02:15:32,940
I'm not trying to judge people who are
using these things,

3143
02:15:32,941 --> 02:15:34,980
using these devices.
I'm just trying to talk about it as

3144
02:15:34,981 --> 02:15:38,130
honestly as I can because I think it's
almost inevitable.

3145
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:42,000
But I think for your own personal good,
it has to be managed carefully.

3146
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:45,660
I think you have to take audit of all
the stuff that's in your life.

3147
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:51,050
And if you spend like I have an hour and
a half just reading through tweets about

3148
02:15:52,471 --> 02:15:55,590
like almost nothing and just looking for
something interesting.

3149
02:15:55,640 --> 02:15:57,570
Just constantly scrolling,
looking for something interesting.

3150
02:15:57,571 --> 02:16:00,540
Like step away from that thing.
Cause you're,

3151
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:05,250
you're impulsively or me speaking to me,
talking to me impulsively checking

3152
02:16:05,251 --> 02:16:08,010
images on instagram.
What Cool Shit did people post up?

3153
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:10,680
You know what interesting.
And my main news is out there right now,

3154
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:12,670
but you know what is uh,
the,

3155
02:16:12,671 --> 02:16:15,520
the latest trending topics on twitter?
Yeah.

3156
02:16:15,960 --> 02:16:17,520
After a while.
Like what the fuck am I doing?

3157
02:16:17,521 --> 02:16:18,420
What,
how about my life?

3158
02:16:18,480 --> 02:16:20,190
What about me as a person?
Like what am I doing?

3159
02:16:20,191 --> 02:16:21,490
I'm not even paying attention.
Yeah.

3160
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:23,880
Well that's why I framed it like that
between Joe Rogan,

3161
02:16:23,881 --> 02:16:26,370
the public person,
and then actually the human that has to

3162
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:30,010
go ahead and live and do this operation.
And kids and a wife

3163
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:32,680
and all those things.
Those are two separate things.

3164
02:16:32,681 --> 02:16:36,910
And yet you got to bring them somehow
into harmony so that they can exist

3165
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:38,050
together.
A big ones.

3166
02:16:38,051 --> 02:16:39,560
Meditation,
thinking,

3167
02:16:39,900 --> 02:16:43,510
Meditation and thinking about what you
actually want to do versus what your

3168
02:16:43,511 --> 02:16:48,010
momentum is leading you towards.
And for me it's isolation tanks.

3169
02:16:48,220 --> 02:16:49,180
That's the big one.
You know,

3170
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:51,490
I have one of my patients,
I use it all the time.

3171
02:16:51,491 --> 02:16:55,450
I think about things.
They're in an undistracted way and I

3172
02:16:55,451 --> 02:16:58,940
take an evaluation of like how I'm
thinking and I,

3173
02:16:59,060 --> 02:17:01,210
it was always like it.
And that's one of the things that people

3174
02:17:01,211 --> 02:17:03,190
don't like about getting high.
And it's one of the things that people

3175
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:06,350
don't like about isolation tanks and or
yoga class too.

3176
02:17:06,351 --> 02:17:09,200
It was talking with my yoga instructor
the other day and you know,

3177
02:17:09,220 --> 02:17:11,830
she was saying it forces people to
examine their shit.

3178
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,860
It does,
it forces you to look at your stuff when

3179
02:17:14,861 --> 02:17:16,810
you're struggling,
you know?

3180
02:17:16,811 --> 02:17:19,220
And Yoga seems so easy when you just say
the word.

3181
02:17:19,221 --> 02:17:20,290
It seems like something,
Oh,

3182
02:17:20,291 --> 02:17:22,330
you're just grabbing your feet and you
know,

3183
02:17:22,331 --> 02:17:23,500
it's fucking hard.
Man,

3184
02:17:23,501 --> 02:17:26,620
it's hard and everyone was 104 degrees.
Speaking of fucked up,

3185
02:17:26,621 --> 02:17:27,470
did you see that?
Uh,

3186
02:17:27,520 --> 02:17:29,470
Hbo,
real sports things with that be from

3187
02:17:29,471 --> 02:17:31,540
guy.
They interviewed beak from Yoga,

3188
02:17:31,541 --> 02:17:33,550
got holy Shit.
People are,

3189
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:37,120
they're taking their name,
his name off the yoga studio now he's

3190
02:17:37,121 --> 02:17:38,470
killing people.
No,

3191
02:17:38,471 --> 02:17:38,921
no,
no,

3192
02:17:38,921 --> 02:17:41,170
no.
He's just a like a crazy fuck.

3193
02:17:41,171 --> 02:17:45,400
Who was saying that all these women you
know have lied because he's been accused

3194
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:50,230
of sexual assault and that people pay $1
million for one drop of his sperm.

3195
02:17:50,470 --> 02:17:53,860
He's like one drop of my sperm.
$1 million.

3196
02:17:56,400 --> 02:17:57,880
I mean he's,
he's a guru,

3197
02:17:57,881 --> 02:17:58,270
right?
Yeah.

3198
02:17:58,270 --> 02:18:00,760
He's uses Yoga Guru who's responsible
for,

3199
02:18:00,770 --> 02:18:03,320
it's one.
It's really an excellent sort of an

3200
02:18:03,330 --> 02:18:08,330
analogy to how weird and fucked up human
beings are that we are not perfect in

3201
02:18:09,911 --> 02:18:10,870
any way,
shape or form.

3202
02:18:11,200 --> 02:18:15,910
You have this guy who brought this thing
its beak from yoga to America and he

3203
02:18:15,911 --> 02:18:18,280
didn't create it.
It's been around for thousands of years

3204
02:18:18,281 --> 02:18:21,790
and he tried to sue people for the
patent and all the movements he lost.

3205
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:23,410
He there was like,
you can't pat in Yoga,

3206
02:18:23,920 --> 02:18:28,920
but this guy has brought yoga and,
and sort of promoted yoga too.

3207
02:18:29,800 --> 02:18:33,730
Who knows how many millions of people.
He's like one of the most directly

3208
02:18:33,731 --> 02:18:35,800
responsible people for promoting this
stuff.

3209
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:39,070
But then you see him as a person,
he's a crazy fuck.

3210
02:18:39,190 --> 02:18:41,980
He won't let people go to the bathroom.
You have to sit there and listen to them

3211
02:18:41,981 --> 02:18:44,680
talk and if you have to go,
you're going to go in your pants.

3212
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:48,070
Like it's all like cult shit.
It makes them stay up all night and

3213
02:18:48,071 --> 02:18:50,440
watch bollywood movies.
It's like a fuck you.

3214
02:18:50,450 --> 02:18:53,110
He's a crazy man.
He's got rolls royces and shit.

3215
02:18:53,111 --> 02:18:56,380
And they busted him with all these cars
and he said that he was gonna open up a

3216
02:18:56,381 --> 02:18:59,440
school for children to learn
automobiles.

3217
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:01,610
Oh yeah.
That's why I bought these Rolls Royces.

3218
02:19:01,780 --> 02:19:04,210
It's a school for underprivileged
children with Rolls Royce.

3219
02:19:04,250 --> 02:19:05,920
It's amazing.
It's amazing.

3220
02:19:05,980 --> 02:19:08,140
But I think,
but that goes to the worship thing that

3221
02:19:08,141 --> 02:19:10,390
we were talking about and that's like
when we see these people worshiping

3222
02:19:10,391 --> 02:19:14,530
Hillary or worshiping trump and it's
like they are not going to solve all

3223
02:19:14,531 --> 02:19:16,480
your problems and not only are they not
going to stop weapons,

3224
02:19:16,690 --> 02:19:19,030
they shouldn't.
The president should.

3225
02:19:19,060 --> 02:19:23,530
The president should keep the road safe.
The president should make sure nobody

3226
02:19:23,531 --> 02:19:25,390
bombs us.
The president should make sure the

3227
02:19:25,391 --> 02:19:27,950
economy keeps chugging.
Just think about the shit jobs that you

3228
02:19:27,951 --> 02:19:28,130
just

3229
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,140
said.
How does one person have those three

3230
02:19:30,141 --> 02:19:32,490
important jobs?
It's fucking crazy.

3231
02:19:32,491 --> 02:19:35,300
You get a guy for the roads.
If it's ridiculous,

3232
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:37,700
you get the department or something.
I call him,

3233
02:19:37,701 --> 02:19:38,720
hey man,
you're doing a job.

3234
02:19:38,750 --> 02:19:41,190
Yeah,
got to go check these roads working sly

3235
02:19:41,330 --> 02:19:42,680
in Arizona.
Let me see the road.

3236
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:44,450
But the road,
but that's actually,

3237
02:19:44,451 --> 02:19:48,050
that's actually the point.
Like they're not supposed to be our

3238
02:19:48,051 --> 02:19:50,180
guide.
They're not supposed to be our emperor.

3239
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:52,520
They're supposed to keep the ship
afloat,

3240
02:19:52,740 --> 02:19:54,700
but as human beings,
we want champs.

3241
02:19:54,710 --> 02:19:55,543
We want it.
God.

3242
02:19:55,580 --> 02:19:56,390
We want.
Yeah.

3243
02:19:56,390 --> 02:19:59,960
We want to bring jfk back to life when a
clone them and even him,

3244
02:19:59,961 --> 02:20:03,140
he would never survive today.
All the crazy shit that guy was up to.

3245
02:20:03,420 --> 02:20:05,480
That's the point.
It's like he would have made wiener

3246
02:20:05,481 --> 02:20:08,960
looked like a Catholic school gave him
or that's Graham gram account.

3247
02:20:12,440 --> 02:20:15,260
I think there's so many people like that
that are complicated.

3248
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:19,880
They're not that we have this narrative
that's been created by film and buy

3249
02:20:19,881 --> 02:20:22,100
books.
We have this false narrative of this

3250
02:20:22,130 --> 02:20:25,070
perfect human being.
This John Wayne care two rides off into

3251
02:20:25,071 --> 02:20:27,440
the sunset,
this clint eastwood who are,

3252
02:20:27,441 --> 02:20:29,570
you know,
Sondra Locke has always waving goodbye

3253
02:20:29,571 --> 02:20:31,730
to him.
He's your rides off and away from the

3254
02:20:31,731 --> 02:20:33,890
Indian.
It's like this is all a false narrative

3255
02:20:33,891 --> 02:20:38,891
and it's created in such a potent way
that our brains are stained by that and

3256
02:20:39,261 --> 02:20:41,390
we kind of expect that out of our
leaders instead of,

3257
02:20:41,810 --> 02:20:43,970
I think that's not the case in other
countries,

3258
02:20:43,971 --> 02:20:46,040
like in Europe in particular,
right?

3259
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:47,660
In Europe,
like in France,

3260
02:20:47,930 --> 02:20:51,380
like politicians dare fucking affairs
and shit.

3261
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:54,060
Nabisco running a brothel or something,
you know,

3262
02:20:54,061 --> 02:20:54,580
like,
hey,

3263
02:20:54,580 --> 02:20:55,413
we're having,
it's Italy.

3264
02:20:56,240 --> 02:20:58,790
Italy is another example.
It's a different world.

3265
02:20:58,850 --> 02:21:02,180
I mean we've developed a very strange
culture over here in America.

3266
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:05,540
Very strange and and,
and a lot of ways confused culture both

3267
02:21:05,570 --> 02:21:08,150
in the positive and in the negative,
you know,

3268
02:21:08,151 --> 02:21:13,151
and bolt and the condemnation of things
that people like trump have said or you

3269
02:21:13,311 --> 02:21:15,650
know,
people like Clinton have allegedly done.

3270
02:21:15,920 --> 02:21:18,640
And also our reaction to it,
both of them were,

3271
02:21:18,641 --> 02:21:20,750
we're weird.
We're just fucking weird man.

3272
02:21:21,390 --> 02:21:23,570
And I don't,
I don't think we've really fully

3273
02:21:23,571 --> 02:21:28,571
embraced our weirdness as a species yet.
I think that's part of the problem with

3274
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:32,000
being a president in the first place.
It's based on bullshit.

3275
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:35,570
Like it's,
it's based on the idea that you can give

3276
02:21:35,571 --> 02:21:39,080
people power and they won't abuse it
because of an ancient scroll.

3277
02:21:39,440 --> 02:21:41,270
That's really what it is.
Someone,

3278
02:21:41,271 --> 02:21:44,360
many,
many moons ago before electricity,

3279
02:21:44,600 --> 02:21:47,630
they figured out how to make anc of like
bugs and shit.

3280
02:21:48,190 --> 02:21:50,890
Whether you use charcoal,
the fuck they used to make any,

3281
02:21:50,950 --> 02:21:52,880
I was going to buy the bugs.
That seems sensible.

3282
02:21:52,930 --> 02:21:57,020
They dip their quill into that and they
would write on a scroll,

3283
02:21:57,021 --> 02:21:58,700
which by the way,
it was mostly made out of hemp.

3284
02:21:58,720 --> 02:22:00,620
Most of these hemp paper.
Well look,

3285
02:22:00,621 --> 02:22:04,730
everyone is incredibly complex and it
has to do with we're all flawed.

3286
02:22:04,731 --> 02:22:07,610
We all fail every day and succeed at
other things.

3287
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:09,440
You could look at,
look at Thomas Jefferson.

3288
02:22:09,441 --> 02:22:11,870
I was at,
my cousin got married near Monte Cello

3289
02:22:12,050 --> 02:22:13,050
in Virginia where,
and that's,

3290
02:22:13,060 --> 02:22:14,390
you know,
that's where his house was and

3291
02:22:14,391 --> 02:22:15,970
everything where he,
uh,

3292
02:22:16,010 --> 02:22:18,740
where he lived and owned slaves and had
sex with some of the slaves and one of

3293
02:22:18,741 --> 02:22:22,070
the slaves had sex with several of them.
I think he was having a good time.

3294
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:23,180
Yeah,
he did.

3295
02:22:23,210 --> 02:22:24,950
But think about that.
He was writing the very,

3296
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:26,070
that ultimately

3297
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,680
freed the slaves while at the same time
in effect,

3298
02:22:28,681 --> 02:22:30,840
you could argue,
and I'm sure people have argued this,

3299
02:22:31,110 --> 02:22:33,660
that he was raping a slave because if it
is about power,

3300
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:36,720
even if she was fully down with it,
she was his slave.

3301
02:22:36,721 --> 02:22:38,040
So,
so,

3302
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:42,900
but at the same time he was also a
writing the very laws to free them.

3303
02:22:42,930 --> 02:22:47,700
That shows you how,
how flawed all of us are that you could

3304
02:22:47,701 --> 02:22:49,770
hate,
you could hate him for,

3305
02:22:49,830 --> 02:22:52,620
for owning slaves.
You could hate him for having this

3306
02:22:52,621 --> 02:22:54,270
relationship with this woman and all
that.

3307
02:22:54,450 --> 02:22:58,740
And at the same time he was instrumental
in writing the very laws that made us

3308
02:22:58,741 --> 02:23:01,590
all equal.
So that goes and you could,

3309
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:05,310
that's why it's so dangerous when you
look back on a different time and you

3310
02:23:05,311 --> 02:23:09,750
try to apply our morality of today on
other people.

3311
02:23:09,790 --> 02:23:11,160
It's on other times.

3312
02:23:11,160 --> 02:23:12,960
It's so dangerous because you could look
at him and go,

3313
02:23:12,961 --> 02:23:14,310
fuck that guy.
Let's,

3314
02:23:14,311 --> 02:23:18,330
let's erase every bit of history the way
we did with the dukes of hazzard car and

3315
02:23:18,331 --> 02:23:19,450
all that shit.
And it,

3316
02:23:19,460 --> 02:23:21,420
that's crazy.
It's a thing that existed.

3317
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:26,060
Confederate flags go back to generally
gets you to the generally,

3318
02:23:26,070 --> 02:23:27,600
yeah.
I just think it should be on the car and

3319
02:23:27,601 --> 02:23:29,280
TV.
Land shouldn't have taken the show off

3320
02:23:29,281 --> 02:23:30,720
the air.
You know what I mean?

3321
02:23:30,721 --> 02:23:33,450
Like Bill Cosby,
I told you this last time I was here.

3322
02:23:33,640 --> 02:23:37,200
Like that guy was my hero.
I went into comedy because I was five

3323
02:23:37,201 --> 02:23:40,440
years old and I saw bill cosby himself
when he's talking about chocolate cake

3324
02:23:40,441 --> 02:23:42,750
and Theo and Vanessa,
the whole thing.

3325
02:23:43,050 --> 02:23:45,780
And I thought it was the funniest
fucking thing ever and it changed my

3326
02:23:45,781 --> 02:23:47,400
life.
It changed the course of my life.

3327
02:23:47,670 --> 02:23:50,880
Now my childhood hero is the biggest
serial rapist of all time.

3328
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:51,900
Of all time.
Yeah.

3329
02:23:51,901 --> 02:23:53,790
That's depressing.
Yeah.

3330
02:23:53,820 --> 02:23:57,090
That's another great example.
Holy should really think about what

3331
02:23:57,091 --> 02:23:59,370
goodness,
you could absolutely draw a line between

3332
02:23:59,371 --> 02:24:02,640
bill cosby and Barack Obama.
You can clearly draw a line that if bill

3333
02:24:02,641 --> 02:24:07,020
cosby and that shows
they're both black.

3334
02:24:07,021 --> 02:24:07,900
So there you go.
No,

3335
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:11,400
but you could draw a line to say that if
that show had not been on NBC primetime

3336
02:24:11,401 --> 02:24:14,700
in had he not done that,
that middle class upstanding family.

3337
02:24:14,701 --> 02:24:18,510
But that was incredibly funny and all
the great stuff about cosby that that

3338
02:24:18,720 --> 02:24:21,660
led to eventually 20 some odd years
later,

3339
02:24:22,110 --> 02:24:26,160
Barack Obama being president and,
and at the same time he was a horrific

3340
02:24:26,161 --> 02:24:29,490
rapist.
Do you think that like a lot of his

3341
02:24:29,491 --> 02:24:31,980
morality,
and this goes back to the sort of tied

3342
02:24:31,981 --> 02:24:33,390
thing,
slingshot effect,

3343
02:24:33,660 --> 02:24:37,740
that a lot of his sort of projected
morality was to make up for the fact

3344
02:24:37,741 --> 02:24:39,200
that it was drug and chicks and rape.

3345
02:24:39,200 --> 02:24:42,240
And I'm so he was America's Dad.
Right.

3346
02:24:42,241 --> 02:24:46,230
And he was also like the ups down
upstanding citizen for the black

3347
02:24:46,231 --> 02:24:50,460
community to get upset if comedians
would swear that whole thing with Eddie

3348
02:24:50,460 --> 02:24:50,730
Murphy.
Yeah.

3349
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:53,610
I mean,
and not just him or not just uh,

3350
02:24:53,630 --> 02:24:56,340
Eddie Murphy.
But I believe the same with Dave

3351
02:24:56,340 --> 02:24:57,930
Chappelle.
I think he had a problem with Chris

3352
02:24:57,930 --> 02:24:59,310
Rock.
You know what he,

3353
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:03,780
what he stood for as was like this
really conservative,

3354
02:25:03,781 --> 02:25:05,550
really friendly,
you know,

3355
02:25:05,551 --> 02:25:08,160
don't we don't talk about Dick's and
pussies and all that stuff.

3356
02:25:08,161 --> 02:25:12,810
Like he had a whole thing about like
when he was really old to before he got

3357
02:25:12,811 --> 02:25:16,060
caught,
it was a whole thing about w w talk

3358
02:25:16,061 --> 02:25:18,540
about it,
but we don't hit it.

3359
02:25:19,020 --> 02:25:22,460
We don't hit on it.
W W we know what I'm saying.

3360
02:25:22,620 --> 02:25:23,990
Can every comedian do

3361
02:25:23,990 --> 02:25:27,520
a cause we can't even that impressive.
And probably the only time I've ever

3362
02:25:27,521 --> 02:25:29,260
tried it,
but it's pretty decent.

3363
02:25:29,261 --> 02:25:30,094
Thank you.
Yeah,

3364
02:25:30,170 --> 02:25:31,680
I need it needs work.
Let's be honest.

3365
02:25:32,260 --> 02:25:35,620
But the point being is that this guy was
the most vocal.

3366
02:25:35,660 --> 02:25:36,970
Yeah.
You'd never heard of the common,

3367
02:25:36,971 --> 02:25:40,000
like you never heard George Wallace tell
other comedians what they should do.

3368
02:25:40,001 --> 02:25:41,920
You know,
you never hear that from Paul,

3369
02:25:41,980 --> 02:25:43,030
you know,
Paul Mooney maybe.

3370
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:45,260
But there's,
you know what I'm saying?

3371
02:25:45,261 --> 02:25:47,080
Like it's like you don't,
well,

3372
02:25:47,081 --> 02:25:50,560
I guess partly partly that may have been
because cosby became such a big

3373
02:25:50,561 --> 02:25:52,180
institution.
You know what I mean?

3374
02:25:52,181 --> 02:25:54,580
It wasn't like,
I love both those guys,

3375
02:25:54,610 --> 02:25:57,580
especially George Wallace,
I think is like absolutely hilarious,

3376
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:02,760
but he never got the level of mainstream
success where what he says has some sort

3377
02:26:03,251 --> 02:26:06,220
of cultural significance right.
Within the comedy world.

3378
02:26:06,380 --> 02:26:09,060
Cosby got to the place of it.

3379
02:26:09,150 --> 02:26:10,840
It's something else.
It's beyond,

3380
02:26:11,230 --> 02:26:13,350
it's beyond what,
99.9,

3381
02:26:13,351 --> 02:26:13,540
nine,
nine,

3382
02:26:13,540 --> 02:26:15,850
9% of comics or any public figure
actually gets,

3383
02:26:16,180 --> 02:26:19,900
he gets a place in the scheme of
history,

3384
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:20,721
so,
well,

3385
02:26:20,721 --> 02:26:21,251
yeah,
it's different.

3386
02:26:21,251 --> 02:26:22,030
He was,
uh,

3387
02:26:22,030 --> 02:26:27,030
he was the best example of like the
elevated person from this minority.

3388
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:32,260
Like the best example,
very well spoken.

3389
02:26:32,500 --> 02:26:35,470
He got a doctorate.
I can't think it got a kind of a legit

3390
02:26:35,471 --> 02:26:39,280
one or you got an honorary one?
I pretty sure it was legit.

3391
02:26:39,281 --> 02:26:43,060
One was like from a paper that he had to
write and graduate school or something

3392
02:26:43,061 --> 02:26:44,200
like that.
See if you,

3393
02:26:44,590 --> 02:26:46,840
I think you got a legit one from New
Jersey.

3394
02:26:46,841 --> 02:26:49,150
He's actually an h cosby.
Write that out to me.

3395
02:26:49,151 --> 02:26:50,710
Yeah.
But I mean you can get an honorary

3396
02:26:50,711 --> 02:26:53,950
doctorate just for your humanitarian
work or cause people think you're slick.

3397
02:26:54,370 --> 02:26:56,950
Well,
heath cliff huxtable was a ob Gyn,

3398
02:26:56,951 --> 02:26:58,090
so there you go.

3399
02:26:58,290 --> 02:27:00,430
It must've went to school there.
I must have.

3400
02:27:00,490 --> 02:27:01,540
Yeah.
Um,

3401
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:04,240
I think that you see,
you grab her by the Pussy,

3402
02:27:04,241 --> 02:27:06,130
but you'd give her a drink first.
Trump.

3403
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:09,490
See now if you went to run for
president,

3404
02:27:09,550 --> 02:27:12,610
they go back to that.
They'd take that out of context and I

3405
02:27:12,611 --> 02:27:14,740
go,
what the fuck did that caused me

3406
02:27:14,741 --> 02:27:17,770
worshiping pussy grabbing.
You'll see.

3407
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:19,540
But it isn't it.
Here it goes.

3408
02:27:19,541 --> 02:27:22,240
Is this is sometimes referred to as
doctor Cosby.

3409
02:27:22,241 --> 02:27:25,360
He has his doctorate in education from
the University of Massachusetts in

3410
02:27:25,361 --> 02:27:28,330
Amherst.
He earned the degree in the mid 1970s a

3411
02:27:28,331 --> 02:27:31,690
thesis entitled the Integration of
Visual Media via fat Albert and the

3412
02:27:31,691 --> 02:27:33,670
Cosby kids.
That's what I did my doctorate on.

3413
02:27:33,850 --> 02:27:35,200
How weird.
Okay.

3414
02:27:36,400 --> 02:27:39,850
It's a teaching aide and vehicle to
achieve increased learning.

3415
02:27:39,880 --> 02:27:40,740
That's interesting.
So,

3416
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,030
so that goes to your point,
did a,

3417
02:27:43,031 --> 02:27:47,440
was the public person really just
defending the horrible actions of the

3418
02:27:47,441 --> 02:27:50,320
private person,
but also he clearly was trying to do

3419
02:27:50,321 --> 02:27:52,450
good work,
but here it says,

3420
02:27:52,451 --> 02:27:55,870
but how he got his degree has been
controversial ever since.

3421
02:27:56,320 --> 02:28:00,760
According to Michael Eric Dyson,
a sociology professor at Georgetown

3422
02:28:00,760 --> 02:28:02,440
University and acclaimed author of his
Bill Cosby,

3423
02:28:02,441 --> 02:28:04,210
right.
And numerous other books.

3424
02:28:04,420 --> 02:28:07,960
Cosby dropped out of high school after
he flunked his 10th grade three times.

3425
02:28:07,961 --> 02:28:09,820
He enlisted in the navy where he got his
ged.

3426
02:28:09,821 --> 02:28:13,360
They enrolled at temple where he dropped
out to pursue a show business career is

3427
02:28:13,361 --> 02:28:15,040
unfinished.
Bachelor degree from Temple was

3428
02:28:15,041 --> 02:28:17,290
eventually it bestowed upon him because
of his life experience.

3429
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:21,440
Cosby enrolled in a part time doctoral
student as the University of

3430
02:28:21,441 --> 02:28:22,370
Massachusetts Amherst,

3431
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:23,840
which awarded home.
See?

3432
02:28:23,841 --> 02:28:25,820
So that's it.
So he dropped out of high school,

3433
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:29,390
came back,
got his ged enrolled in temple,

3434
02:28:29,391 --> 02:28:33,020
dropped out of that and got a doctorate
for writing about a cartoon.

3435
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:35,570
But even the bachelor's degree,
they're saying he had an unfinished

3436
02:28:35,571 --> 02:28:37,490
bachelor's degree because of life
experience.

3437
02:28:37,491 --> 02:28:40,010
So he didn't get that degree reality.
Wow,

3438
02:28:40,011 --> 02:28:41,390
that's wild.
So both of them.

3439
02:28:41,450 --> 02:28:43,160
So it's not entirely true.
I mean,

3440
02:28:43,161 --> 02:28:45,440
he did get a degree,
but obviously there's a,

3441
02:28:45,770 --> 02:28:47,920
there's an asterick attached to that.
Yeah.

3442
02:28:48,080 --> 02:28:49,520
But,
but separating it from that,

3443
02:28:49,521 --> 02:28:51,690
it's like that,
that thing that you're talking about is,

3444
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:53,750
is pretty powerful stuff.
That what you,

3445
02:28:53,900 --> 02:28:56,660
that he was doing this horrible shit
until and yet.

3446
02:28:56,870 --> 02:28:59,390
And yet he enriched so many lives at the
same time,

3447
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:02,960
literally at the same time that he was
doing this horrible stuff to these

3448
02:29:02,961 --> 02:29:06,710
women.
He was bringing so much goodness to the

3449
02:29:06,711 --> 02:29:07,544
country.

3450
02:29:08,180 --> 02:29:09,410
That's,
that's deep.

3451
02:29:09,620 --> 02:29:12,110
You know,
there's fucking deep and that's people.

3452
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:16,730
No,
I think the sooner we recognize how

3453
02:29:16,731 --> 02:29:21,560
flawed human beings are,
the the better we're going to be off.

3454
02:29:21,620 --> 02:29:24,470
And I think also on a,
this is another thing that I've talked

3455
02:29:24,471 --> 02:29:26,420
about on stage before,
but it's a real issue.

3456
02:29:26,900 --> 02:29:31,900
I don't think human beings are designed
to take in the data for media.

3457
02:29:31,911 --> 02:29:35,840
I don't think we can truly distinguish
the difference between false narratives

3458
02:29:35,841 --> 02:29:37,180
and fiction.
I mean,

3459
02:29:37,260 --> 02:29:38,510
I know we can,
you know,

3460
02:29:38,511 --> 02:29:41,030
when you go to see a fucking movie,
you know it's a movie you leave.

3461
02:29:41,031 --> 02:29:43,010
Lao is a good movie man.
God Damn,

3462
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:45,040
can't wait for doctor.
Strange to,

3463
02:29:45,320 --> 02:29:47,390
you know,
we know it's a movie,

3464
02:29:47,420 --> 02:29:51,230
but there's an impact that that data has
on our mind that we have to,

3465
02:29:51,231 --> 02:29:53,120
even though we have to separate it and
move it around,

3466
02:29:53,330 --> 02:29:57,740
that impact is there were designed to
follow like the tribal leader,

3467
02:29:57,741 --> 02:30:02,060
this old guy with scars who's fucking
survived battles and he has wisdom and

3468
02:30:02,061 --> 02:30:06,530
he knows the poems and we sit around the
fire and we follow him because of actual

3469
02:30:06,531 --> 02:30:08,480
real live accomplishments in real life.

3470
02:30:08,480 --> 02:30:11,930
Things that we've seen him do.
And it's how he stays alive is I stay

3471
02:30:11,931 --> 02:30:13,550
alive.
Whereas only 30 of us.

3472
02:30:13,580 --> 02:30:15,770
Okay,
we've got fucking bear skins on and

3473
02:30:15,771 --> 02:30:17,810
we're living in a cave and we,
we don't have much time.

3474
02:30:17,811 --> 02:30:20,270
We got to follow that guy.
He knows how to stay alive and we might

3475
02:30:20,271 --> 02:30:22,400
not make it.
And this is a very real concern because

3476
02:30:22,401 --> 02:30:24,170
we know tribes that are gone,
right?

3477
02:30:24,171 --> 02:30:28,880
So this is how human beings develop for
fucking thousands of thousands of years.

3478
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:32,150
If you believe in evolution,
when we went from being a monkey to

3479
02:30:32,151 --> 02:30:34,370
being a guy who's addicted to a cell
phone,

3480
02:30:34,490 --> 02:30:38,930
there was a lot of steps along the way.
And in those steps we developed a lot of

3481
02:30:38,931 --> 02:30:43,150
these human reward systems where you get
you,

3482
02:30:43,151 --> 02:30:46,850
you get used to and look forward to
certain things was those things,

3483
02:30:46,851 --> 02:30:49,100
those rewards will keep you alive.

3484
02:30:49,250 --> 02:30:51,560
Whether it's being attractive to
females,

3485
02:30:51,710 --> 02:30:54,890
the will spread your DNA.
That when you must be concerned about

3486
02:30:54,891 --> 02:30:57,770
this,
whether it's a overcoming the

3487
02:30:57,771 --> 02:30:59,510
adversaries,
because if you don't,

3488
02:30:59,511 --> 02:31:01,310
they're going to kill you.
Like you have to stay alive.

3489
02:31:02,210 --> 02:31:05,300
You gotta be,
you have to figure out how to stay quiet

3490
02:31:05,301 --> 02:31:08,600
when you're hunting is one of the
reasons today why women enjoy gossip and

3491
02:31:08,601 --> 02:31:11,440
men enjoy quiet and why the two are
sometimes incompatible.

3492
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:13,500
Like there's a design,
women are designed,

3493
02:31:13,520 --> 02:31:15,860
they were trying to keep the fucking
tribe together so that sit around

3494
02:31:15,861 --> 02:31:18,290
washing clothes.
She got this dirty bitch fucks everybody

3495
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:19,750
when we go to sleep.
Like that's,

3496
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:20,190
that's

3497
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:21,080
where it came from.
Yeah.

3498
02:31:21,090 --> 02:31:23,190
And with the men they were out of these
hunting parties and like shy,

3499
02:31:23,191 --> 02:31:26,130
everybody shut the fuck up.
What's pay attention?

3500
02:31:26,131 --> 02:31:27,390
We gotta be,
we gotta stay close here.

3501
02:31:27,570 --> 02:31:30,700
And this is the whole reason why there's
a difference in the way these to behave.

3502
02:31:30,701 --> 02:31:34,860
And this has all been like well
established by sociologists,

3503
02:31:35,010 --> 02:31:37,710
by people who have studied human
behavior.

3504
02:31:38,220 --> 02:31:42,540
I think that where we're at now with
movies and songs,

3505
02:31:42,600 --> 02:31:45,630
you're getting this data in a way.
We don't know how to process.

3506
02:31:45,900 --> 02:31:47,610
We obviously internally,
you know,

3507
02:31:47,611 --> 02:31:50,530
we obviously can rationalize and go,
well I know that's just a song.

3508
02:31:50,531 --> 02:31:53,100
Or I know that's just a movie.
And I know the Indiana Jones isn't a

3509
02:31:53,101 --> 02:31:56,920
real guy and he wouldn't just survive
every time the fucking bowling ball size

3510
02:31:56,921 --> 02:31:58,140
boulder comes his way.
He would,

3511
02:31:58,170 --> 02:32:01,290
he would get killed.
Then he got in the fridge and parked for

3512
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:04,530
you
to fucking Ark of the covenant.

3513
02:32:04,530 --> 02:32:05,970
How do you survive the,
come on man.

3514
02:32:05,971 --> 02:32:08,660
There's a lot of shit going on in that.
I could accept that the fucking news

3515
02:32:08,690 --> 02:32:10,440
goes to be apocalyptic.
All of it.

3516
02:32:10,441 --> 02:32:13,200
It's supposed to be replacing the dark.
Yeah.

3517
02:32:13,240 --> 02:32:14,730
The way it looked the other way from the
nuke.

3518
02:32:14,820 --> 02:32:16,380
That's all he needed to do.
Kidney Cancer.

3519
02:32:16,381 --> 02:32:19,560
He's got a fucking cool hat.
But those,

3520
02:32:19,590 --> 02:32:24,590
those narratives and this,
this life version is all data that's

3521
02:32:25,050 --> 02:32:28,700
entered into the human consciousness.
And the more we expose ourselves to it,

3522
02:32:28,701 --> 02:32:31,530
when kids are watching eight hours of
fucking television and uh,

3523
02:32:31,560 --> 02:32:35,100
people were like constantly and gross in
their phones and all this like two

3524
02:32:35,101 --> 02:32:38,100
dimensional data and video and all these
different things on youtube,

3525
02:32:38,310 --> 02:32:41,340
the more that stuff gets into your mind,
into your life,

3526
02:32:41,610 --> 02:32:43,740
the less you're experiencing the actual
life.

3527
02:32:43,770 --> 02:32:48,030
It's almost like a preparation for us
being a part of this hive mind.

3528
02:32:48,030 --> 02:32:52,050
Like these are the steps you take when
you create this sort of new type of

3529
02:32:52,080 --> 02:32:53,400
being.
I mean,

3530
02:32:53,401 --> 02:32:54,410
it's integrated.
You're,

3531
02:32:54,411 --> 02:32:56,050
you're talking about the matrix that
we're,

3532
02:32:56,051 --> 02:33:00,030
we're slowly morphing into this thing.
And that's why,

3533
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:01,620
you know,
people have to understand that what

3534
02:33:01,621 --> 02:33:04,680
happens there isn't real yet.
So like,

3535
02:33:04,710 --> 02:33:06,780
you know,
sorta jumping all the way back to that,

3536
02:33:06,781 --> 02:33:07,440
Leslie,
don't think it,

3537
02:33:07,440 --> 02:33:09,870
when people say mean things to you,
I'm sure if you would look at your

3538
02:33:09,871 --> 02:33:11,490
twitter right now,
somebody is probably saying something

3539
02:33:11,491 --> 02:33:14,370
mean they will now how they're going to
be really pissed.

3540
02:33:14,371 --> 02:33:15,600
You're a bully.
You told them to do it.

3541
02:33:17,020 --> 02:33:18,730
You see you,
you've sick.

3542
02:33:19,550 --> 02:33:21,220
Don't worry.
There's a lot of mine are you already?

3543
02:33:21,250 --> 02:33:22,790
So they'll,
they'll turn it on me door.

3544
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:24,420
We're all fine.
But uh,

3545
02:33:24,450 --> 02:33:26,130
but point is that,
that those words,

3546
02:33:26,131 --> 02:33:28,460
it goes to that words are not acting
thing like it.

3547
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:30,390
So what someone said something mean to
you,

3548
02:33:30,510 --> 02:33:31,470
you got to get over it.
So,

3549
02:33:31,471 --> 02:33:33,480
for example,
part of my,

3550
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:35,280
uh,
this is gonna sound sort of Corny,

3551
02:33:35,281 --> 02:33:39,540
but part of my success in the last year
is directly related to you because your

3552
02:33:39,550 --> 02:33:41,160
name,
because my show is my,

3553
02:33:41,161 --> 02:33:43,050
for real,
my show was taken off when I was on here

3554
02:33:43,051 --> 02:33:46,080
last time.
And by you giving it a little bump here

3555
02:33:46,081 --> 02:33:48,660
and then you've been,
you've been real good to me on social

3556
02:33:48,661 --> 02:33:51,300
media.
You helped amplify what I do.

3557
02:33:51,570 --> 02:33:54,360
And in the process of that,
I now all my social media,

3558
02:33:54,361 --> 02:33:57,360
when I scroll in a weird way,
it's become sort of meaningless.

3559
02:33:57,390 --> 02:34:01,230
It's become all noise because if 95% of
its good,

3560
02:34:01,231 --> 02:34:03,450
which it usually is low,
then it's like,

3561
02:34:03,451 --> 02:34:05,760
oh there's another nice one.
It's nice and it is nice,

3562
02:34:05,761 --> 02:34:08,220
you know,
I'm not demeaning and people giving you

3563
02:34:08,221 --> 02:34:11,340
compliments just a nice things or I like
what you're doing or retweeting what I'm

3564
02:34:11,341 --> 02:34:11,940
doing or whatever.

3565
02:34:11,940 --> 02:34:14,340
That's all nice.
And then the bad ones come in and then,

3566
02:34:14,341 --> 02:34:16,080
you know,
for whatever reason I focus on the bad

3567
02:34:16,081 --> 02:34:18,460
ones more.
But then I just let it all becomes noise

3568
02:34:18,461 --> 02:34:19,241
and I'm just like,
you know what?

3569
02:34:19,241 --> 02:34:23,900
I just have to do what I do and then let
the rest of it be I,

3570
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:26,530
you know what I mean?
We probably at this point can't respond

3571
02:34:26,531 --> 02:34:27,730
to everybody anymore.
Oh No,

3572
02:34:27,731 --> 02:34:28,780
I can't.
No,

3573
02:34:28,810 --> 02:34:29,740
it's it.
But that's the thing.

3574
02:34:29,741 --> 02:34:31,590
It's not fun anymore.
Like part of the,

3575
02:34:31,820 --> 02:34:36,100
the price to pay for a little success
here is that the part that used to be

3576
02:34:36,101 --> 02:34:39,490
fun when I would play around with people
more on there and spend more time

3577
02:34:39,491 --> 02:34:40,900
interacting.
It's like,

3578
02:34:40,901 --> 02:34:44,580
it's become such like a cal vacate of
craziness that I,

3579
02:34:44,581 --> 02:34:47,140
I just don't have the time where I
didn't have the mental bandwidth more

3580
02:34:47,141 --> 02:34:47,590
than anything else.

3581
02:34:47,590 --> 02:34:50,380
I have a lot going on and it's like,
so that's been a little bit of a

3582
02:34:50,381 --> 02:34:52,930
sacrifice along the way.
But yeah,

3583
02:34:52,931 --> 02:34:56,680
but that's just comes with the program.
Especially when you're thinking about

3584
02:34:56,681 --> 02:34:58,210
the numbers of people that you're
reaching.

3585
02:34:58,240 --> 02:35:00,160
Nobody ever had to do that.
Like madmen magic.

3586
02:35:00,161 --> 02:35:03,100
Johnny Carson had a twitter account and
he was trying to interact with all the

3587
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:06,520
fans where he got email carson tonight,
show.com and he's like,

3588
02:35:06,521 --> 02:35:09,100
did not know that there's,
look at all those fucking email.

3589
02:35:09,101 --> 02:35:10,630
How am I gonna respond to these people?
If you don't,

3590
02:35:10,631 --> 02:35:11,620
they get mad at you.
They were,

3591
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:15,520
but this one good thing that's going on
is people don't expect you to do that

3592
02:35:15,521 --> 02:35:19,030
when you reach a certain number of fans.
Like I get way more,

3593
02:35:19,410 --> 02:35:21,340
um,
messages from people that say,

3594
02:35:21,341 --> 02:35:24,010
Hey,
I love the podcast or a great job in the

3595
02:35:24,011 --> 02:35:25,060
UFC,
or something like that.

3596
02:35:25,060 --> 02:35:29,620
That those kind of messages I get way
more often than someone actually trying

3597
02:35:29,621 --> 02:35:33,150
to get me to respond to things I would
like to do if I had,

3598
02:35:33,151 --> 02:35:35,350
I had that kind of time,
but no one has that kind of time.

3599
02:35:35,380 --> 02:35:36,191
Right.
That's what I'm saying.

3600
02:35:36,191 --> 02:35:39,610
There's just a certain amount and that
goes to combining public person and

3601
02:35:39,970 --> 02:35:41,620
private person.
Like there's a certain amount of

3602
02:35:41,621 --> 02:35:44,550
bandwidth that your brain has that all
of us have to do what,

3603
02:35:44,551 --> 02:35:46,360
whatever it is we do.
I could,

3604
02:35:46,420 --> 02:35:48,850
we,
the two of us could sit here for 24

3605
02:35:48,851 --> 02:35:51,070
hours in a row and just respond to
things and blah,

3606
02:35:51,071 --> 02:35:53,770
blah blah.
And it's like your brain also has to be

3607
02:35:53,771 --> 02:35:56,380
able to breathe well.
Your spirit has to be able to breathe,

3608
02:35:56,381 --> 02:35:58,780
you have to live life.
And I think if you have anything to

3609
02:35:58,781 --> 02:36:00,250
offer,
and this one of the things that I'm

3610
02:36:00,251 --> 02:36:02,730
finding,
it's kind of important to me and I've

3611
02:36:02,740 --> 02:36:06,730
tried to,
I've tried to engineer this in my own

3612
02:36:06,731 --> 02:36:10,030
life in a way,
is that I've got to have as much life

3613
02:36:10,031 --> 02:36:15,031
experiences or more than I do work
because like just working.

3614
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:18,820
Like if I just did podcasts every day,
I would have things to say because

3615
02:36:18,821 --> 02:36:20,110
there's always something going on in the
world.

3616
02:36:20,410 --> 02:36:23,470
But I think I wouldn't be doing my own
perspective,

3617
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:26,260
a service I think to do my perspective
of serve it,

3618
02:36:26,261 --> 02:36:28,060
to,
to be honest about it.

3619
02:36:28,061 --> 02:36:30,670
I need to experience things.
I needed to live life.

3620
02:36:30,700 --> 02:36:31,660
I needed to,
uh,

3621
02:36:32,270 --> 02:36:33,700
you know,
travel to places.

3622
02:36:33,701 --> 02:36:36,070
Yeah.
I needed to do things that are difficult

3623
02:36:36,100 --> 02:36:38,110
and I need to get involved in a lot of
activities.

3624
02:36:38,111 --> 02:36:41,770
I like to do different things because I
think first of all,

3625
02:36:41,771 --> 02:36:45,640
because I enjoy them first and foremost.
And I think embracing that I enjoy them

3626
02:36:45,641 --> 02:36:47,210
benefits me and a great way to,
yeah.

3627
02:36:47,350 --> 02:36:48,930
Because when I do things that I enjoy
it,

3628
02:36:48,940 --> 02:36:50,260
I get happy.
When I get happy,

3629
02:36:50,261 --> 02:36:51,880
I work better,
you know?

3630
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:56,410
And I think if,
if I didn't do that and if I didn't like

3631
02:36:56,411 --> 02:36:57,940
actively seek out,
it would just,

3632
02:36:57,941 --> 02:37:00,340
it's really easy for a lot of people.
A lot of people find this,

3633
02:37:00,341 --> 02:37:04,000
they get caught up in work so much that
that's all they focus on.

3634
02:37:04,390 --> 02:37:08,410
And then,
then I think you stop being the person

3635
02:37:08,411 --> 02:37:10,720
who got to that position in the first
place.

3636
02:37:10,750 --> 02:37:14,410
The person who got to that position in
the first place got there because people

3637
02:37:14,411 --> 02:37:16,190
liked what you talked about,
what you thought

3638
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:18,440
about.
And then the only way that even gets

3639
02:37:18,470 --> 02:37:21,560
more enhanced is by experiencing things.
And by the way,

3640
02:37:21,561 --> 02:37:22,820
you don't have to go to,
uh,

3641
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:24,320
across the world to do that.
Even,

3642
02:37:24,321 --> 02:37:25,400
I was telling you before we started
that.

3643
02:37:25,401 --> 02:37:26,840
So I just,
I bought a house.

3644
02:37:26,841 --> 02:37:28,220
We're,
we're doing the home studio thing.

3645
02:37:28,221 --> 02:37:30,620
My fans are funding it.
It's like my dreams literally are

3646
02:37:30,621 --> 02:37:32,510
becoming reality.
It's as you know,

3647
02:37:32,511 --> 02:37:35,240
like Dez validating as anything that has
happened in my entire life.

3648
02:37:35,300 --> 02:37:36,120
Congratulations.
Yes.

3649
02:37:36,120 --> 02:37:37,040
That's awesome.
It's like,

3650
02:37:37,100 --> 02:37:37,933
it's beautiful.
Yeah,

3651
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:40,130
it's very cool too man.
It's awesome.

3652
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:43,100
Um,
and yesterday I'm trying to hook up some

3653
02:37:43,101 --> 02:37:47,000
speakers in the house and I have some
old ass stereo that I've had forever and

3654
02:37:47,001 --> 02:37:50,420
I'm trying to hook this shit up and it
was driving me crazy,

3655
02:37:50,421 --> 02:37:53,660
but I actually halfway through after
like three hours of fucking pulling

3656
02:37:53,661 --> 02:37:57,340
things out of the wall and you know,
the old wire is the little metal ones

3657
02:37:57,341 --> 02:38:02,341
that you've got to turn and jamming them
into speakers and negative a twist and

3658
02:38:03,940 --> 02:38:04,400
the black thing.

3659
02:38:04,400 --> 02:38:06,110
And I'm jamming.
I mean that's literally what I'm doing

3660
02:38:06,111 --> 02:38:09,560
yesterday and I'm frustrated as fuck.
And then about halfway through I was

3661
02:38:09,561 --> 02:38:11,300
like,
this is actually great.

3662
02:38:11,330 --> 02:38:15,200
My attention was so focused,
turning those things,

3663
02:38:15,380 --> 02:38:17,090
getting that thing in there,
pulling one out.

3664
02:38:17,091 --> 02:38:18,770
Wait a minute,
I had to run across the other and make

3665
02:38:18,771 --> 02:38:21,500
the speaker work and this one I have to
run outside and it's like,

3666
02:38:21,860 --> 02:38:25,640
that was actually great.
It was a moment completely where I set

3667
02:38:25,641 --> 02:38:27,470
all my shit aside and I realized I was
like,

3668
02:38:27,471 --> 02:38:30,920
wow,
for the last hour I was fucking in this

3669
02:38:30,921 --> 02:38:33,980
shitty ass Yamaha Stereo thing,
you know?

3670
02:38:35,050 --> 02:38:37,160
And it was actually pretty great,
right?

3671
02:38:37,260 --> 02:38:38,750
Yeah.
There really is.

3672
02:38:38,751 --> 02:38:40,700
So you don't have to go across the world
to do it.

3673
02:38:40,940 --> 02:38:44,930
Just doing something that there was
meaning in me doing it.

3674
02:38:44,990 --> 02:38:46,640
I didn't want to hire someone to do it.
You know,

3675
02:38:46,641 --> 02:38:47,960
like I want to figure this thing out.

3676
02:38:48,020 --> 02:38:49,730
And I did.
I think there's definitely something to

3677
02:38:49,731 --> 02:38:51,650
that.
But I went to the Vatican this summer

3678
02:38:51,651 --> 02:38:54,290
and I think it was more fun than you
install on your stereo and I got to

3679
02:38:54,310 --> 02:38:56,730
learn more about people and looking at,
you know,

3680
02:38:56,840 --> 02:39:01,130
St Peter's basilica than I ever would've
done screwing together some fucking

3681
02:39:01,131 --> 02:39:03,950
wires and sticking them into some box
that makes noise.

3682
02:39:03,980 --> 02:39:06,800
I Bet I can beat you on that because
many years ago,

3683
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:09,080
I believe around 97,
I think it might have been the same trip

3684
02:39:09,081 --> 02:39:12,020
that I ended up in Egypt.
I went to Amsterdam.

3685
02:39:12,230 --> 02:39:15,950
I like basically shrooms for like eight
days and then we want it.

3686
02:39:15,951 --> 02:39:18,290
So my buddy and I,
we wanted to take that,

3687
02:39:20,010 --> 02:39:22,390
we wanted to take shrooms to,
uh,

3688
02:39:22,430 --> 02:39:25,880
to Rome to trip at the Sistine Chapel.
So listen to this,

3689
02:39:25,881 --> 02:39:26,900
we get on the train,
you know,

3690
02:39:26,901 --> 02:39:28,570
it's like the overnight train,
I don't know,

3691
02:39:28,571 --> 02:39:31,430
probably 12 hours to go from Amsterdam
to Rome.

3692
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:34,760
We got boarded,
the train got boarded by like,

3693
02:39:34,790 --> 02:39:35,960
uh,
I dunno,

3694
02:39:35,961 --> 02:39:37,820
like blush or police or something.
Yeah,

3695
02:39:37,821 --> 02:39:38,900
something.
So we were like,

3696
02:39:38,930 --> 02:39:39,741
what are we gonna do?
What do we do?

3697
02:39:39,741 --> 02:39:42,700
So we ate the evidence.
So we literally ate the shrooms on the

3698
02:39:42,910 --> 02:39:45,230
trains.
I don't remember like enough for one

3699
02:39:45,231 --> 02:39:46,011
person each,
like,

3700
02:39:46,011 --> 02:39:47,300
not,
not like a crazy amount,

3701
02:39:47,570 --> 02:39:50,090
but we're on an overnight train in like
one of those little cruise ships where

3702
02:39:50,091 --> 02:39:51,710
you're sleeping with two people above
you.

3703
02:39:51,830 --> 02:39:54,430
So we're both on the bottom in a tiny
little room with,

3704
02:39:54,460 --> 02:39:58,580
with four Italians tripping balls for
hours and hours and hours.

3705
02:39:58,820 --> 02:40:03,260
We get to,
we get to room and we went right to the

3706
02:40:03,260 --> 02:40:04,460
Sistine Chapel,
which you have to walk through like a

3707
02:40:04,461 --> 02:40:06,810
lot of other chapels kind of to get to.
And he said,

3708
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:10,430
but so I wasn't fully tripping but I had
just enough,

3709
02:40:10,910 --> 02:40:13,100
just enough in the Sistine Chapel beat
that.

3710
02:40:13,350 --> 02:40:14,280
Now you can't

3711
02:40:14,340 --> 02:40:15,880
pretty good.
Well you only thing where you could do

3712
02:40:15,881 --> 02:40:18,540
that through four countries cause I
tripped through uh,

3713
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:19,990
the Netherlands.
I tripped through bolt,

3714
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:21,960
Belgium,
uh,

3715
02:40:22,350 --> 02:40:23,390
something in Italy.
There's,

3716
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:25,380
there's another one in there.
What else would be in there?

3717
02:40:26,010 --> 02:40:28,110
I Dunno.
I mean it all sounds Florence,

3718
02:40:28,111 --> 02:40:29,520
did you go to Florence?
I went to Florence,

3719
02:40:29,521 --> 02:40:30,870
but that's in Italy.
Yeah.

3720
02:40:30,871 --> 02:40:32,410
You said something else in Italy.
So he was,

3721
02:40:32,420 --> 02:40:34,050
he just,
it was Belgium.

3722
02:40:34,500 --> 02:40:36,690
Netherlands is where I started with
things other than Italy.

3723
02:40:36,691 --> 02:40:38,940
Is that what you meant?
I don't know what I said.

3724
02:40:38,941 --> 02:40:41,400
I don't know,
but good time.

3725
02:40:41,401 --> 02:40:42,660
That's the point.
Like we,

3726
02:40:42,661 --> 02:40:45,510
you,
we visualizing just,

3727
02:40:45,540 --> 02:40:47,160
you know,
when you have just enough of the

3728
02:40:47,161 --> 02:40:48,000
visuals,
like just,

3729
02:40:48,001 --> 02:40:49,470
it's like a little moving,
you know,

3730
02:40:49,471 --> 02:40:53,130
just a little something.
I was stone cold sober inside St Peter's

3731
02:40:53,131 --> 02:40:55,020
Basilica and I freaked out.

3732
02:40:56,010 --> 02:40:59,880
I was just thinking about the sheer
effort involved in making something so

3733
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:03,630
insanely huge and how many hundreds of
years it took to build it.

3734
02:41:04,050 --> 02:41:07,380
We had a great guide.
He was really smart.

3735
02:41:07,381 --> 02:41:11,040
He was a professor and uh,
he spoke fluent English and fluent

3736
02:41:11,041 --> 02:41:13,680
Italian and he was a local professor who
did this on the side.

3737
02:41:13,681 --> 02:41:18,450
And when someone was like really
enthusiastic about the history of it,

3738
02:41:18,451 --> 02:41:22,500
he like lit up like a Christmas tree.
So me and this guy had some awesome

3739
02:41:22,501 --> 02:41:24,300
conversations and you know,
you,

3740
02:41:24,750 --> 02:41:27,270
he stuck with us for like our like five
or six hours.

3741
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:30,390
Then we went to dinner with him
afterwards and um,

3742
02:41:30,450 --> 02:41:32,190
you know,
he was just so,

3743
02:41:32,191 --> 02:41:36,510
he sold love the artwork and the culture
and the history of it.

3744
02:41:36,590 --> 02:41:38,730
And it was like,
it was so infectious when he was talking

3745
02:41:38,731 --> 02:41:39,241
about it.
Well,

3746
02:41:39,241 --> 02:41:39,630
that's the thing.

3747
02:41:39,630 --> 02:41:42,390
You don't have to be religious per se.
I'm not a believer.

3748
02:41:43,030 --> 02:41:43,980
Doesn't matter.
Right?

3749
02:41:43,981 --> 02:41:45,900
I believe in things that I,
that can be proven.

3750
02:41:45,901 --> 02:41:47,340
If someone could prove something to me
then,

3751
02:41:47,370 --> 02:41:50,040
then I would believe it.
If you told me that Lebron James dunked

3752
02:41:50,041 --> 02:41:51,990
from half court,
well I'd need to see video.

3753
02:41:51,991 --> 02:41:52,800
You know,
like I would just,

3754
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:53,640
Oh,
he did well,

3755
02:41:53,641 --> 02:41:54,510
hot damn,
you know,

3756
02:41:54,660 --> 02:41:58,110
so why wouldn't I apply that same logic
to the biggest questions of the

3757
02:41:58,111 --> 02:41:59,940
universe?
But even not being a believer,

3758
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:03,510
you can acknowledge that the work that
these people had to do,

3759
02:42:04,020 --> 02:42:08,010
that maybe they felt some divine spirit,
they felt something in themselves that I

3760
02:42:08,011 --> 02:42:11,310
can't explain or whatever.
That there's an incredible power to

3761
02:42:11,311 --> 02:42:11,701
that.
I mean,

3762
02:42:11,701 --> 02:42:13,250
go to Jerusalem.
You can look at the,

3763
02:42:13,500 --> 02:42:15,390
the Western Wall is literally,
you know,

3764
02:42:15,391 --> 02:42:18,270
the holiest site in Judaism is adjacent
with the Temple Mount.

3765
02:42:18,710 --> 02:42:20,550
The Dome of the Rock is right on top of
that.

3766
02:42:20,551 --> 02:42:23,430
The third holy site and Islam.
And if you walk five minutes the other

3767
02:42:23,431 --> 02:42:25,020
way,
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre where

3768
02:42:25,021 --> 02:42:27,690
Jesus was crucified is right there.
I mean,

3769
02:42:28,200 --> 02:42:29,760
so whether you believe in this stuff or
not,

3770
02:42:29,790 --> 02:42:34,350
it the fact the facts on the ground
exist and you have to acknowledge that

3771
02:42:34,351 --> 02:42:37,110
some people find meaning and value in
that.

3772
02:42:37,111 --> 02:42:39,000
And we could,
we could argue whether that would have

3773
02:42:39,001 --> 02:42:43,800
been a destructive force throughout time
or I think a lot of ways religion is

3774
02:42:43,801 --> 02:42:45,930
like bill cosby.
It's both.

3775
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:49,740
It's helped people and it's hurt a lot.
I mean,

3776
02:42:49,741 --> 02:42:52,590
religion is,
or been responsible for some horrible

3777
02:42:52,591 --> 02:42:54,780
trustees and not just one religion,
like many,

3778
02:42:54,781 --> 02:42:56,490
many religions,
but like many,

3779
02:42:56,491 --> 02:43:00,330
many groups of power,
many groups that have influencing great

3780
02:43:00,331 --> 02:43:02,790
influence over people.
A lot of times they look out for

3781
02:43:02,791 --> 02:43:04,920
themselves,
they protect themselves ruthlessly,

3782
02:43:04,921 --> 02:43:06,840
especially when they have massive
amounts of power.

3783
02:43:06,841 --> 02:43:08,070
That doesn't make any sense in the
world.

3784
02:43:08,290 --> 02:43:12,150
Like when you look at any sort of,
uh,

3785
02:43:12,670 --> 02:43:16,210
any side of a coup or any sort of a
usurping of power,

3786
02:43:16,390 --> 02:43:19,600
like it's someone who has massive
amounts of power and someone else wants

3787
02:43:19,601 --> 02:43:23,920
that massive amounts of power and they
conquer him and takeover and it's always

3788
02:43:23,921 --> 02:43:27,130
like this spectacular,
chaotic event.

3789
02:43:27,670 --> 02:43:31,600
And that's what human beings sort of,
that's what they do.

3790
02:43:31,990 --> 02:43:32,561
You know,
they,

3791
02:43:32,561 --> 02:43:36,490
they established positions of power than
the abused them and they're almost

3792
02:43:36,491 --> 02:43:39,430
begging for some better,
smarter person to come along and take it

3793
02:43:39,431 --> 02:43:42,190
from there.
I think about that sometimes even when

3794
02:43:42,191 --> 02:43:44,830
I'd be like walking where I used to live
in west Hollywood where it's like

3795
02:43:44,831 --> 02:43:46,000
pretty,
uh,

3796
02:43:46,030 --> 02:43:47,290
you know,
it's next to beverly hills,

3797
02:43:47,350 --> 02:43:50,230
it's a nice area and that all these
people are sort of walking,

3798
02:43:50,231 --> 02:43:52,870
you know,
there's nice shops there and everyone

3799
02:43:52,871 --> 02:43:54,660
kind of looks good.
So it's sort of where he's at.

3800
02:43:54,661 --> 02:43:56,230
But when they go to the gym,
they tan,

3801
02:43:56,231 --> 02:43:58,300
they get surgery,
they're,

3802
02:43:58,301 --> 02:43:59,920
they're like,
they're all working on themselves all

3803
02:43:59,921 --> 02:44:01,960
day doing their own thing and it's,
and you're right,

3804
02:44:01,961 --> 02:44:05,110
it's almost like they're just,
they're so blind to the fact that there

3805
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:06,460
is something else happening.

3806
02:44:06,490 --> 02:44:11,050
There is a real power play happening in
the world where there are forces that

3807
02:44:11,051 --> 02:44:14,110
want to change things,
either for what may be better for you

3808
02:44:14,111 --> 02:44:15,670
or,
or worst for you or whatever.

3809
02:44:15,940 --> 02:44:20,710
And most people just ignore it because
it's a lot easier to get lost in twitter

3810
02:44:20,711 --> 02:44:22,870
or watch the Kardashians or country
clubs,

3811
02:44:22,871 --> 02:44:24,490
the kids of the world.
That's what we are.

3812
02:44:24,491 --> 02:44:27,610
We're just spoiled country club kids.
The world that don't realize the

3813
02:44:27,611 --> 02:44:32,470
consequences of flying drones in the
Yemen and bombing wedding parties,

3814
02:44:32,480 --> 02:44:34,070
you know,
there's like the,

3815
02:44:34,080 --> 02:44:36,490
the consequence that's attached to those
people.

3816
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:39,970
It would be so significant it was
happening on this patch of dirt,

3817
02:44:40,240 --> 02:44:43,360
but since it's happening over there,
we don't think of it as a big a deal.

3818
02:44:43,390 --> 02:44:46,750
Could you imagine what would happen if
someone from another country had flown a

3819
02:44:46,751 --> 02:44:50,230
drone over the United States and
accidentally bombed some sort of a

3820
02:44:50,231 --> 02:44:51,490
wedding party in Phoenix?

3821
02:44:51,520 --> 02:44:53,770
Right.
Could you fucking imagine,

3822
02:44:53,830 --> 02:44:56,830
imagine if a one rocket flew over
Mexicans,

3823
02:44:56,860 --> 02:45:00,160
Mexico's border to a hotel,
Passover,

3824
02:45:00,190 --> 02:45:02,110
a La Jolla.
We bomb Canada.

3825
02:45:02,111 --> 02:45:05,890
I mean like that.
Like think about that.

3826
02:45:05,891 --> 02:45:08,620
Like it's so crazy when you think,
you know,

3827
02:45:08,621 --> 02:45:09,730
and I get it.
As I said before,

3828
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:14,200
I'm not against every state secret.
I understand that some shit has,

3829
02:45:14,340 --> 02:45:18,000
there are rules that are beyond what the
average time of day.

3830
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:21,760
They're only that way because there's no
transparency in these other countries

3831
02:45:21,761 --> 02:45:22,541
too.
Yeah.

3832
02:45:22,541 --> 02:45:26,620
Once all these countries develop this
new level of transparency where you

3833
02:45:26,621 --> 02:45:28,420
can't hide shit,
you can't lie.

3834
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:30,160
You're going to do one or two things.
You're going to say,

3835
02:45:30,161 --> 02:45:31,140
look,
I'm Gaviscon,

3836
02:45:31,180 --> 02:45:33,640
I'm running this motherfucker and you're
going to put in the whole thing.

3837
02:45:33,940 --> 02:45:36,070
I mean,
what Putin is doing right now is old

3838
02:45:36,071 --> 02:45:40,210
school dictators kills his rivals
publicly.

3839
02:45:40,460 --> 02:45:41,890
He has sat,
has Sasa natives,

3840
02:45:41,891 --> 02:45:42,040
right?

3841
02:45:42,040 --> 02:45:44,020
Did you see the fucking assassination
attempt on him?

3842
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:45,400
No.
You haven't seen it?

3843
02:45:45,430 --> 02:45:46,750
I don't think so.
On on Putin?

3844
02:45:46,810 --> 02:45:47,760
Yeah.
No.

3845
02:45:47,790 --> 02:45:50,950
Yeah,
some wise that it made a suicide attack

3846
02:45:50,951 --> 02:45:54,070
on his car,
but his driver was in the car and not

3847
02:45:54,071 --> 02:45:57,400
him.
This guy drove high speed head on right

3848
02:45:57,401 --> 02:45:59,270
into Putin's car.
When we try this,

3849
02:45:59,280 --> 02:46:01,090
how the hell did I miss two weeks ago?
No Shit.

3850
02:46:01,150 --> 02:46:02,350
Yeah,
two weeks ago.

3851
02:46:02,370 --> 02:46:03,910
Check out this.
That takes a lot at seafood.

3852
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:05,410
Watch this,
watch this,

3853
02:46:05,411 --> 02:46:07,750
watch this car.
See the guy in the middle is doing that

3854
02:46:07,751 --> 02:46:09,620
so he could hit Putin's caught,
Bam.

3855
02:46:09,890 --> 02:46:10,160
That's

3856
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:12,710
it.
He knew where the car was and he drove

3857
02:46:12,711 --> 02:46:16,010
in the median and then turn towards
Putin's car.

3858
02:46:16,260 --> 02:46:17,980
We tried to tell him one more time real
quick,

3859
02:46:17,981 --> 02:46:20,600
now that I can see it right now I see
the front part to watch the median.

3860
02:46:20,601 --> 02:46:22,140
What's the middle strip?
That guy is,

3861
02:46:22,141 --> 02:46:24,860
they're planning this.
Then he sees the car and turns right

3862
02:46:24,861 --> 02:46:27,380
into a holy shit.
Holy Shit is right.

3863
02:46:27,650 --> 02:46:31,550
It killed the driver.
I think it killed both guys.

3864
02:46:31,970 --> 02:46:35,120
See if we kill both guys,
but Putin was not in that car,

3865
02:46:35,121 --> 02:46:36,170
but that's his,
um,

3866
02:46:36,200 --> 02:46:39,560
his favorite driver.
Fucking bananas.

3867
02:46:40,110 --> 02:46:41,930
So I mean that's,
that's game of thrones.

3868
02:46:42,070 --> 02:46:43,220
That's right.
That's to the point.

3869
02:46:43,221 --> 02:46:45,260
This is very modern game of thrones
happening.

3870
02:46:45,261 --> 02:46:45,741
Yeah.
And,

3871
02:46:45,741 --> 02:46:49,700
but all these other people,
these are the people that are protected

3872
02:46:49,730 --> 02:46:54,140
by the dark lords that run the kingdom
and that this is just the modern version

3873
02:46:54,141 --> 02:46:56,210
of shit that's been going on since the
beginning of time.

3874
02:46:56,210 --> 02:46:59,420
So then that said,
does that give you any empathy for what

3875
02:46:59,421 --> 02:47:02,000
Clinton has to do to get there?
So that's what I'm saying.

3876
02:47:02,001 --> 02:47:03,470
I don't have,
not necessarily empathy,

3877
02:47:03,471 --> 02:47:08,240
but a vague understanding of how
ignorant I am about how the world works.

3878
02:47:09,560 --> 02:47:11,840
And that's a,
it's a weird place to sit,

3879
02:47:11,870 --> 02:47:13,250
I suppose.
And you know,

3880
02:47:13,251 --> 02:47:17,180
here's the defense of Clinton,
the major Clinton dot bill because,

3881
02:47:17,181 --> 02:47:19,820
you know,
not a defense of whatever he may or may

3882
02:47:19,821 --> 02:47:20,850
not have done,
uh,

3883
02:47:21,110 --> 02:47:23,510
physically to all those people that are
accusing him of things,

3884
02:47:23,810 --> 02:47:27,080
but about his,
like the speeches that he does and all

3885
02:47:27,081 --> 02:47:31,100
the money that he's trying to acquire.
People forget how ruthlessly prosecuted

3886
02:47:31,101 --> 02:47:33,950
he was my Kenneth Star while he was in
office.

3887
02:47:34,100 --> 02:47:36,740
And how crazy that all that all that
situation was.

3888
02:47:37,280 --> 02:47:38,540
Um,
who was leading it?

3889
02:47:38,541 --> 02:47:40,010
Newt Gingrich,
who as we said before,

3890
02:47:40,011 --> 02:47:42,320
it was having an affair off his wife
that was dying.

3891
02:47:42,440 --> 02:47:43,940
Yeah.
And then there was another guy,

3892
02:47:44,140 --> 02:47:45,800
the strategist who's the,
uh,

3893
02:47:45,801 --> 02:47:48,200
the Republican strategist.
It was Ken Mehlman.

3894
02:47:48,201 --> 02:47:48,831
No,
that was after,

3895
02:47:48,831 --> 02:47:49,940
that was the George W.
Bush guy.

3896
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:51,133
Rove?
No.

3897
02:47:51,150 --> 02:47:53,450
Yeah.
Call Ralf Karl Rove is about part of it

3898
02:47:53,451 --> 02:47:53,841
too,
right?

3899
02:47:53,841 --> 02:47:55,760
Wasn't he partially involved Clinton
thing?

3900
02:47:55,910 --> 02:47:58,790
Maybe he's not.
Maybe I'm confusing cause Karl Rove is

3901
02:47:58,791 --> 02:48:00,380
definitely a part of the Jeff Gannon
story.

3902
02:48:01,040 --> 02:48:02,150
Um,
I don't,

3903
02:48:02,270 --> 02:48:05,090
you know,
I don't know what that could have

3904
02:48:05,091 --> 02:48:08,240
possibly been like for them,
but I know that when Bill Clinton got

3905
02:48:08,241 --> 02:48:11,090
out of office,
apparently he was deeply in debt because

3906
02:48:11,091 --> 02:48:13,640
of his legal fees.
And the whole thing was just like off

3907
02:48:13,641 --> 02:48:15,350
the chart.
That was one of the things that Hillary

3908
02:48:15,351 --> 02:48:18,050
talked about.
Like she had said that when they left,

3909
02:48:18,080 --> 02:48:19,610
when he left the office,
they were dead broke.

3910
02:48:19,940 --> 02:48:22,760
Well he obviously found ways to
capitalize on it and did it.

3911
02:48:22,760 --> 02:48:26,570
But could you imagine being a guy who's
a former president and is,

3912
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:30,230
how old was he at the time?
Like maybe in his late fifties and

3913
02:48:30,440 --> 02:48:34,490
fucking,
not just dead broke but beaten down by

3914
02:48:34,491 --> 02:48:36,760
public scandal.
And you are,

3915
02:48:36,761 --> 02:48:41,030
you're in debt to the tune of who knows
how many dollars and you've lost all

3916
02:48:41,031 --> 02:48:44,060
your money to legal cases cause you're
fighting off impeachment by all these

3917
02:48:44,061 --> 02:48:48,140
crazy people that want to prosecute you
for doing shit that pretty much every

3918
02:48:48,141 --> 02:48:50,000
president has done since the beginning
of time,

3919
02:48:50,001 --> 02:48:52,220
whipped his dick out and people just
start sucking it because they're the

3920
02:48:52,221 --> 02:48:54,350
fucking king.
Cause it's crazy to be in that position

3921
02:48:54,351 --> 02:48:56,570
in the first place.
Who Cares?

3922
02:48:56,600 --> 02:49:00,050
Well people should care because he lied.
If you raped people or whatever,

3923
02:49:00,051 --> 02:49:01,730
then that's one thing.
But I'm just going to just the general,

3924
02:49:01,731 --> 02:49:04,190
if the president's having affairs,
who gives a fuck?

3925
02:49:04,310 --> 02:49:07,650
Is the country working?
Is it this thing basically not going

3926
02:49:07,651 --> 02:49:09,510
towards the iceberg then.
Okay.

3927
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:13,740
But here's where it's curious.
He didn't get prosecuted because he lied

3928
02:49:13,770 --> 02:49:18,420
because obviously Obama now we don't now
found out that he lied about the emails

3929
02:49:18,421 --> 02:49:21,000
from the wikileaks.
He lied to the American people.

3930
02:49:21,001 --> 02:49:23,910
It is a small lie.
It is a white lie I guess you could say

3931
02:49:23,911 --> 02:49:25,220
cause nobody,
you know,

3932
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:28,020
I mean might not be the worst luck.
Obama's wasn't under oath.

3933
02:49:28,021 --> 02:49:29,800
Clinton's was exactly that was going to
get to.

3934
02:49:30,060 --> 02:49:35,060
But the difference being that he didn't
raise his hand and put his hand on the

3935
02:49:35,071 --> 02:49:38,670
Bible and say,
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth?

3936
02:49:38,671 --> 02:49:41,220
Like why you have to,
you have to,

3937
02:49:41,221 --> 02:49:43,800
I have to know your really honest,
like now,

3938
02:49:44,260 --> 02:49:47,220
like this is the time where you can't
lie anymore.

3939
02:49:47,221 --> 02:49:51,390
So we have this crazy rule that if you
do lie during that time,

3940
02:49:51,540 --> 02:49:56,540
it's so different than when you lie
about what FBI Administrator Komi or

3941
02:49:56,701 --> 02:49:57,730
whatever the fuck his title is.

3942
02:49:57,730 --> 02:49:58,330
Yeah.
Comb.

3943
02:49:58,330 --> 02:50:01,470
He says about what you did and versus
what you think you did.

3944
02:50:01,550 --> 02:50:04,320
Right.
Or whether it's who knows what other

3945
02:50:04,321 --> 02:50:07,080
things,
whether it's how many fucking cell phone

3946
02:50:07,081 --> 02:50:11,550
she had or Ben Gazi or what are those
lines where you have your team destroy

3947
02:50:11,551 --> 02:50:14,170
all your old devices.
But Hammers and I had a team,

3948
02:50:14,730 --> 02:50:16,290
we actually did take some,
uh,

3949
02:50:16,291 --> 02:50:19,170
old hard drives out to the gun range.
Yeah.

3950
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:19,900
And I,
uh,

3951
02:50:19,900 --> 02:50:22,800
I put some 300 win mag rounds into him.
That'll,

3952
02:50:23,220 --> 02:50:26,430
that'll show him who's boss cause we
were going to get rid of him anyway.

3953
02:50:26,431 --> 02:50:28,440
They were old.
It is old bullshit.

3954
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:30,420
I said it'd be fun to take these to the
range.

3955
02:50:30,421 --> 02:50:33,450
Just blow them apart.
Say I said we took them out there and I

3956
02:50:33,451 --> 02:50:36,690
was siting in my rifle.
Ooh.

3957
02:50:36,740 --> 02:50:38,760
Should see what it does to one.
I'd like to try that.

3958
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:41,500
You would like to try that?
I would do that with you sometime

3959
02:50:42,440 --> 02:50:45,210
computers or you have some old laptops.
You know what I did today?

3960
02:50:45,570 --> 02:50:47,060
Um,
I got off the apple tip.

3961
02:50:47,100 --> 02:50:50,400
I got my apple laptop here,
but I bought a windows laptop just to

3962
02:50:50,401 --> 02:50:52,800
see what's going on a bottle.
Yes they do.

3963
02:50:52,830 --> 02:50:55,680
They make a Lenovo thinkpad.
Uh,

3964
02:50:55,681 --> 02:50:57,450
that's what I got.
I was like think pads.

3965
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:00,720
I had one a long time ago and I'm so
let's see what the newest thinkpads look

3966
02:51:00,721 --> 02:51:01,111
like.
I'm like,

3967
02:51:01,111 --> 02:51:02,430
I still had that little red.
Yeah,

3968
02:51:02,431 --> 02:51:04,650
the little nipple that you play with.
I like that thing.

3969
02:51:05,010 --> 02:51:06,620
Yes.
They have the nipple still.

3970
02:51:06,690 --> 02:51:07,560
Yeah,
yeah,

3971
02:51:07,620 --> 02:51:10,950
yeah.
I got a p 50 Lenovo thinkpad p 50.

3972
02:51:10,951 --> 02:51:13,530
So anyway,
I get this thing pad and it has windows

3973
02:51:13,531 --> 02:51:14,071
seven.
Well,

3974
02:51:14,071 --> 02:51:18,150
the newest windows is windows 10.
So I try upgrading to windows 10.

3975
02:51:18,210 --> 02:51:21,600
Oh Geez.
Three and a half hours later after to

3976
02:51:21,601 --> 02:51:25,410
fucking live chats with people.
They can't figure out how to get it to

3977
02:51:25,411 --> 02:51:28,640
work to different people.
I'm talking to um,

3978
02:51:28,740 --> 02:51:29,391
with,
uh,

3979
02:51:29,391 --> 02:51:30,211
you know,
tech support.

3980
02:51:30,211 --> 02:51:31,350
They can't figure out how to get it to
work.

3981
02:51:31,351 --> 02:51:34,740
It's still got windows seven on it.
I spent three and a half hours this

3982
02:51:34,740 --> 02:51:37,180
morning,
not as therapeutic as my little Yamaha

3983
02:51:37,200 --> 02:51:37,860
stretches.
Nothing.

3984
02:51:37,860 --> 02:51:40,370
I didn't lose my,
I didn't lose my temper because I

3985
02:51:40,380 --> 02:51:41,850
treated it.
I have a laptop.

3986
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:46,380
This one's getting kind of,
it's got a lot of space taken up by porn

3987
02:51:46,590 --> 02:51:50,760
and stupid shit and I'm fucking pool
videos and a bunch of dumb stuff on my

3988
02:51:50,761 --> 02:51:52,990
phone from my phone rather.
And I was saying,

3989
02:51:52,991 --> 02:51:55,350
and why I should probably get like a new
laptop,

3990
02:51:55,351 --> 02:51:57,120
like,
why don't I see what windows 10 is like?

3991
02:51:57,300 --> 02:51:59,470
So I figure if you buy a new laptop,
oh,

3992
02:51:59,471 --> 02:52:01,260
for sure it's going to have windows 10
on it.

3993
02:52:01,530 --> 02:52:05,850
No one had fucking windows seven windows
seven an

3994
02:52:06,310 --> 02:52:09,580
eight nine I didn't know that they did
anything after 95 I thought it was

3995
02:52:09,581 --> 02:52:12,850
windows 95 and then that was it.
I heard windows 10 is good.

3996
02:52:12,851 --> 02:52:15,010
I've,
I've heard it reviewed by a tech people,

3997
02:52:15,011 --> 02:52:17,050
so I'm,
I'm hoping to see what the fuss is all

3998
02:52:17,051 --> 02:52:17,884
about.
But I've been,

3999
02:52:18,820 --> 02:52:21,010
I at least,
I think it might be like,

4000
02:52:21,490 --> 02:52:26,200
like going,
going to a really shitty job for a while

4001
02:52:26,710 --> 02:52:28,780
and then coming back to your regular job
and going,

4002
02:52:28,781 --> 02:52:32,300
God is so much better.
Isn't it funny how sometimes like if

4003
02:52:32,340 --> 02:52:35,920
we're as connected as you may be,
sometimes some technology just kind of

4004
02:52:35,921 --> 02:52:38,740
gets passed you and then you realize you
just like miss something.

4005
02:52:38,741 --> 02:52:42,040
So for the last five years I've been
using firefox,

4006
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:44,440
the browser,
firefox,

4007
02:52:44,760 --> 02:52:46,100
you're on chrome I guess.
Right?

4008
02:52:46,110 --> 02:52:48,250
So I'm using firefox.
Nothing would work.

4009
02:52:48,251 --> 02:52:51,100
Like things like videos would freeze,
audio would freeze.

4010
02:52:51,280 --> 02:52:52,870
I couldn't open three windows at once,
you know,

4011
02:52:52,871 --> 02:52:54,850
like whole bunch of shit.
And then my,

4012
02:52:54,851 --> 02:52:55,920
uh,
my director were,

4013
02:52:55,921 --> 02:52:58,690
Mira saw me clicking firefox and she
was,

4014
02:52:58,691 --> 02:53:00,190
you know,
she's 23 or 24.

4015
02:53:00,191 --> 02:53:03,040
And she was laughing hysterically like,
you fucking idiot.

4016
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:05,800
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

4017
02:53:06,040 --> 02:53:08,290
And then she said,
you got to get on chrome.

4018
02:53:08,530 --> 02:53:09,161
And I was like,
no,

4019
02:53:09,161 --> 02:53:10,990
that can't be any different than
firefox.

4020
02:53:10,991 --> 02:53:14,200
I thought everybody was on firefox,
like for as much as I'm in this thing,

4021
02:53:14,440 --> 02:53:15,131
this was,
I don't know,

4022
02:53:15,131 --> 02:53:17,890
I got on firefox and I just was there.
Chrome is the shit.

4023
02:53:17,920 --> 02:53:19,420
So now I'm on chrome.
And guess what,

4024
02:53:19,510 --> 02:53:20,830
you press play,
you know what happens?

4025
02:53:20,890 --> 02:53:22,240
Shit plays,
she plays.

4026
02:53:22,270 --> 02:53:22,601
Yeah.
Well,

4027
02:53:22,601 --> 02:53:25,690
I'm a big believer in the Google and one
of the things that I've been thinking

4028
02:53:25,691 --> 02:53:26,524
about is,
uh,

4029
02:53:26,560 --> 02:53:28,780
getting off the apple tit and,
uh,

4030
02:53:28,840 --> 02:53:31,780
using an android phone and a windows
laptop.

4031
02:53:31,780 --> 02:53:33,760
So I'm going to try that over the next
few months.

4032
02:53:33,820 --> 02:53:36,100
This is the beginning of the end.
I don't think so.

4033
02:53:36,460 --> 02:53:38,500
I want to,
I don't think being frustrated be such a

4034
02:53:38,501 --> 02:53:39,490
bad thing.
I mean,

4035
02:53:39,491 --> 02:53:41,680
I think at the very least I can call
people on good dude.

4036
02:53:41,710 --> 02:53:43,330
I don't think I could send you a text
anymore.

4037
02:53:43,390 --> 02:53:45,130
Something's going on and send me
pictures.

4038
02:53:45,131 --> 02:53:47,560
I can't find him.
That's a great way to get off the grid.

4039
02:53:47,561 --> 02:53:49,840
Sorry.
I heard when people say the pictures on

4040
02:53:49,841 --> 02:53:52,150
those google phones,
like they go into a folder,

4041
02:53:52,660 --> 02:53:55,990
like if someone sends you a picture,
it's attached to your text message.

4042
02:53:55,991 --> 02:53:59,560
That picture like automatically goes
into a folder and may not even exist on

4043
02:53:59,561 --> 02:54:02,110
the tech stream.
Like I don't get it.

4044
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:03,360
I don't know if that's the case.
You know,

4045
02:54:03,361 --> 02:54:05,110
even live like this,
I'm going to find out,

4046
02:54:05,111 --> 02:54:05,944
I'm going to find out.

4047
02:54:06,130 --> 02:54:07,480
I'm going to find it.
I want to see what's going on.

4048
02:54:07,481 --> 02:54:08,261
I'm going to try that.
They have a,

4049
02:54:08,261 --> 02:54:12,130
Google has a new phone called the Google
Google Pixel heard about it and it's

4050
02:54:12,131 --> 02:54:15,970
very highly received by tech dorks.
The people that really know what the

4051
02:54:15,971 --> 02:54:18,550
fuck they're talking about unlike me.
And they uh,

4052
02:54:18,580 --> 02:54:21,400
they really liked the camera.
They were like the speed,

4053
02:54:21,401 --> 02:54:24,250
the pure google experience,
because nobody fucks with it.

4054
02:54:24,450 --> 02:54:27,040
It comes straight from them.
They don't have a third party software

4055
02:54:27,041 --> 02:54:29,590
built into it so I'm going to say let's
see what's going on.

4056
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:32,590
Cause I think if you just stay on the
apple tit all the time,

4057
02:54:32,920 --> 02:54:35,170
like when people send me a text message
is all green,

4058
02:54:35,200 --> 02:54:38,320
I can a little envy like this person is
out there and just rebelling.

4059
02:54:38,770 --> 02:54:41,580
They're out there and be wild and
sending text messages.

4060
02:54:41,581 --> 02:54:45,730
Now this morning when I was dealing with
the Yamaha show you,

4061
02:54:45,731 --> 02:54:48,970
I'm not making this shit up.
See I'm just a real big fan of Google in

4062
02:54:48,971 --> 02:54:52,810
general took a picture of a wire and it
came back green and I thought what's

4063
02:54:52,811 --> 02:54:54,160
this guy know that?
I don't know.

4064
02:54:54,250 --> 02:54:57,760
This guy's got green.
He knows he knows things or he doesn't

4065
02:54:57,761 --> 02:54:59,290
or he's poor,
poor guy.

4066
02:54:59,350 --> 02:55:01,630
He's going to be unemployed.
It was very sad.

4067
02:55:01,631 --> 02:55:04,340
It could be that he's just a crazy,
he doesn't trust apple,

4068
02:55:04,610 --> 02:55:06,410
but there is something fucking weird
about that.

4069
02:55:06,440 --> 02:55:09,770
Those blue things like,
and then if someone's got another kind

4070
02:55:09,771 --> 02:55:12,170
of phone then it's Greens.
Like oh they're an outsider.

4071
02:55:12,740 --> 02:55:15,680
It's green.
You didn't even send you a blue one.

4072
02:55:15,710 --> 02:55:17,330
Like why?
Why do you have different fucking

4073
02:55:17,331 --> 02:55:19,430
collars for different people that have
different phones?

4074
02:55:19,431 --> 02:55:22,790
I don't like the word where that's going
well the other ones that feel it's that

4075
02:55:22,791 --> 02:55:26,930
1984 commercial that apple did in 1984
when they were fighting windows at the

4076
02:55:26,931 --> 02:55:30,620
time they were fighting Microsoft.
But the idea that the bigger my apple

4077
02:55:30,621 --> 02:55:33,410
gets and the more we just instinctively
go to it.

4078
02:55:33,411 --> 02:55:35,480
And by the way,
I say this with all due irony because I

4079
02:55:35,481 --> 02:55:37,070
got the iphone seven the day it came
out.

4080
02:55:38,150 --> 02:55:39,220
Awesome.
Um,

4081
02:55:40,130 --> 02:55:43,040
but you know,
the more that we all do that you

4082
02:55:43,041 --> 02:55:46,810
actually incentivize them to not
innovate because if they know that if,

4083
02:55:46,910 --> 02:55:48,920
cause this phone,
really the reality is that this phone

4084
02:55:48,921 --> 02:55:51,740
that we're both have right now,
it barely is different than the,

4085
02:55:51,770 --> 02:55:52,340
than the six.

4086
02:55:52,340 --> 02:55:53,610
Right.
Are you finding it?

4087
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:57,560
But who are you now?
We've been talking for awhile.

4088
02:55:57,950 --> 02:55:59,540
A little better,
a little better,

4089
02:55:59,570 --> 02:56:03,470
but maybe a little worse.
I like the annoying Shin and I do miss

4090
02:56:03,471 --> 02:56:05,220
the phone and the headphone Jack.
Yeah.

4091
02:56:05,270 --> 02:56:06,800
Guess what?
Sometimes I want to have a headphone

4092
02:56:06,801 --> 02:56:10,790
plugged in while I'm in my car so I can
talk to someone with a thing dangling

4093
02:56:10,791 --> 02:56:14,590
from my ear because it's way easier to
hear them that it is through speaker

4094
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:17,210
phone or what if you want to charge your
phone and use headphones.

4095
02:56:18,200 --> 02:56:20,570
I don't agree with what they're doing
and I don't agree with what they're

4096
02:56:20,571 --> 02:56:23,840
doing with laptops either where they're
getting rid of USB and they have,

4097
02:56:23,841 --> 02:56:26,360
now they have some new type of Usb like,
come on man,

4098
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:29,360
this isn't any better.
But the thing is that goes to my point.

4099
02:56:29,361 --> 02:56:31,730
If they know that you're going to buy
this shit no matter what,

4100
02:56:31,731 --> 02:56:34,010
and they know us,
they knew the day they put this out,

4101
02:56:34,011 --> 02:56:36,470
they're going to make x amount of
hundreds of millions of dollars if not

4102
02:56:36,471 --> 02:56:37,040
more.

4103
02:56:37,040 --> 02:56:40,130
So the more that we all instinctively
just go to them,

4104
02:56:40,370 --> 02:56:44,150
the actual less they have.
There's less incentive for them to give

4105
02:56:44,151 --> 02:56:48,330
us good innovative shit because why keep
changing it if you just tweak a couple

4106
02:56:48,331 --> 02:56:50,900
of things and they don't put that much
into it and we all do it anyway.

4107
02:56:51,050 --> 02:56:56,050
I also think that it's probably
important to support competition and to,

4108
02:56:56,660 --> 02:56:57,530
you know,
like when,

4109
02:56:57,560 --> 02:57:01,790
I think once they reach a point where
the tech people are saying this is the

4110
02:57:01,791 --> 02:57:03,770
best phone,
like a lot of the Google,

4111
02:57:04,460 --> 02:57:06,530
the people that have a reviewed the
Google Pixel,

4112
02:57:06,710 --> 02:57:08,870
they're saying,
I have ditched my iphone for this is the

4113
02:57:08,871 --> 02:57:12,140
best phone in the market.
Finally for the first time an android

4114
02:57:12,141 --> 02:57:14,150
phone,
I don't know if they're rooting for

4115
02:57:14,210 --> 02:57:17,000
android and so they may have a biased
opinion.

4116
02:57:17,170 --> 02:57:17,880
My,
my tribe,

4117
02:57:17,880 --> 02:57:19,460
like these guys are out of their fucking
mind.

4118
02:57:19,490 --> 02:57:20,750
Right.
Well we're gonna find out,

4119
02:57:20,930 --> 02:57:23,660
I'm going to find out about windows 10
and I'm going to find out about android.

4120
02:57:23,661 --> 02:57:26,540
I want to give them both.
A shot decided that recently I was like,

4121
02:57:26,541 --> 02:57:29,720
this is just too instinctive a move for
me to just go to apple.

4122
02:57:30,430 --> 02:57:32,360
Like I remember when I was on news
radio,

4123
02:57:32,390 --> 02:57:33,980
it's when apple wasn't really even that
good.

4124
02:57:34,010 --> 02:57:38,780
It was before m o s 10 osx rather,
which was the big operating system

4125
02:57:38,781 --> 02:57:43,100
change where it went to unix based
system opposed to the way it was before.

4126
02:57:43,101 --> 02:57:47,090
It was like it would freeze up before it
had no memory protection.

4127
02:57:47,091 --> 02:57:49,290
You couldn't really multitask correctly.
It did.

4128
02:57:49,300 --> 02:57:51,560
It didn't have what they call preemptive
multitasking.

4129
02:57:51,830 --> 02:57:54,250
So like the tech people didn't
appreciate the,

4130
02:57:54,251 --> 02:57:59,251
the Mac platform until Osx and then Osx
had this really like responsive user

4131
02:57:59,511 --> 02:58:01,890
interface.
It was very cool little animation things

4132
02:58:01,891 --> 02:58:01,980
would

4133
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:04,260
happen when you click on things and I
saw that and what,

4134
02:58:04,261 --> 02:58:06,150
Whoa,
okay I want to try it,

4135
02:58:06,180 --> 02:58:07,070
I'm going to try it.
So I went,

4136
02:58:07,110 --> 02:58:10,440
that's when I jumped back over from
windows to Mac again.

4137
02:58:10,980 --> 02:58:14,340
And there's so many people that get in
these clans.

4138
02:58:14,370 --> 02:58:16,770
It's like we were talking about with
Republicans versus Democrats.

4139
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:19,890
There's a lot of clans.
Like when I was on the set of news

4140
02:58:19,891 --> 02:58:21,120
radio,
one of the guys,

4141
02:58:21,121 --> 02:58:23,940
this is back when Max sucked,
one of the guys just like,

4142
02:58:23,941 --> 02:58:25,080
uh,
you know,

4143
02:58:25,081 --> 02:58:26,550
do,
do you hear our sales are up,

4144
02:58:26,700 --> 02:58:28,770
our sales are up,
but he's talking about like Max,

4145
02:58:28,800 --> 02:58:31,200
I go our sales,
he's like sounds of Matt.

4146
02:58:31,230 --> 02:58:32,490
Cause you know,
he knew he was a man.

4147
02:58:32,520 --> 02:58:35,010
He'd have where apple t shirts and shit.
He was such a,

4148
02:58:35,420 --> 02:58:39,150
Bill Gates was there.
Steve Jobs was the key grip on a news

4149
02:58:39,310 --> 02:58:39,760
radio.

4150
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:40,561
He,
you know,

4151
02:58:40,561 --> 02:58:42,390
he's a creative guy behind the scenes
guy,

4152
02:58:42,391 --> 02:58:46,050
but he was like so excited about apple
sales being up.

4153
02:58:46,051 --> 02:58:46,650
And I'm like,
dude,

4154
02:58:46,650 --> 02:58:48,450
this is weird.
You're getting weird with me.

4155
02:58:48,780 --> 02:58:50,520
You know we've got new,
a new Mac.

4156
02:58:50,521 --> 02:58:52,350
Books are coming up.
Okay,

4157
02:58:52,380 --> 02:58:54,150
don't you have a computer?
Like what the fuck are we doing?

4158
02:58:54,990 --> 02:58:57,720
What are we doing?
We become slaves to these machine.

4159
02:58:57,721 --> 02:58:59,790
Yeah.
But then it was like apple was the

4160
02:58:59,791 --> 02:59:01,620
underdog.
It's a different experience.

4161
02:59:01,621 --> 02:59:03,300
Well that's what I mean.
That 1984 commercial,

4162
02:59:03,301 --> 02:59:08,250
their whole point was you all bow down
to Microsoft and we are the upstarts.

4163
02:59:08,251 --> 02:59:10,020
Where are the people that are going to
break the system?

4164
02:59:10,021 --> 02:59:11,490
Break the Matrix.
I think different.

4165
02:59:11,550 --> 02:59:14,640
Think different and now it's like think
the same and Natalie's they think the

4166
02:59:14,641 --> 02:59:16,980
same and if you don't think the same,
there's something wrong with you.

4167
02:59:16,980 --> 02:59:18,500
You've got a green text.
What the Hell is wrong with you?

4168
02:59:18,501 --> 02:59:19,261
Yeah.
But you know,

4169
02:59:19,261 --> 02:59:22,560
apple for all the cries of everybody
with trump in the taxes because

4170
02:59:22,561 --> 02:59:24,150
everything these days is somehow linked
back to together.

4171
02:59:24,300 --> 02:59:26,580
You know apple pays virtually no
corporate taxes.

4172
02:59:26,610 --> 02:59:28,140
Exactly.
And what's his name?

4173
02:59:28,141 --> 02:59:30,990
The head guy now tim cook basically it
was like,

4174
02:59:30,991 --> 02:59:32,970
yeah,
when they rewrite fairer tax laws,

4175
02:59:32,971 --> 02:59:35,420
we'll bring our money back here.
Now know some back.

4176
02:59:35,450 --> 02:59:38,340
For some reason nobody's upset by that.
We don't see people throwing iphone is

4177
02:59:38,341 --> 02:59:40,410
out the window.
The problem is they have a

4178
02:59:40,411 --> 02:59:44,550
responsibility as a gigantic corporation
to the people that hold their stock.

4179
02:59:44,910 --> 02:59:47,340
Like there's a weird thing that happens
with corporations.

4180
02:59:47,570 --> 02:59:49,950
They're public and people own stock in
it.

4181
02:59:49,951 --> 02:59:52,620
Like you have a direct obligation,
your stockholders to make a profit.

4182
02:59:52,621 --> 02:59:54,330
So it doesn't that prove trump's point
though.

4183
02:59:54,390 --> 02:59:56,520
So it does proves his point because it's
like,

4184
02:59:56,521 --> 02:59:58,610
all right,
I'm doing what's legal.

4185
02:59:58,700 --> 03:00:00,810
Right at the end of the year when
you're,

4186
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:03,570
when you go to pay your taxes,
I'm pretty sure you tell your account in

4187
03:00:03,571 --> 03:00:05,220
the same thing that every sensible
person does,

4188
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:08,130
which is do whatever is legal and I want
to pay the least amount of taxes.

4189
03:00:08,340 --> 03:00:09,540
I don't,
I still don't see everybody.

4190
03:00:09,580 --> 03:00:12,350
Does tax shelters exist?
Yeah.

4191
03:00:12,390 --> 03:00:13,620
So I don't,
so again,

4192
03:00:13,621 --> 03:00:15,390
he hasn't released his taxes,
so that's shitty.

4193
03:00:15,391 --> 03:00:16,320
And he lied.
And by the way,

4194
03:00:16,321 --> 03:00:18,300
he's lying when he says the thing about
auditing,

4195
03:00:18,440 --> 03:00:19,171
you know,
he's whole thing is,

4196
03:00:19,171 --> 03:00:20,790
well I'm under audit so I'm not going to
do it.

4197
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:22,770
But then,
then the next sentence at the last

4198
03:00:22,771 --> 03:00:23,491
debate,
he was like,

4199
03:00:23,491 --> 03:00:25,320
you know what,
I'm going to write it but I won't do it.

4200
03:00:25,321 --> 03:00:28,740
But if hillary releases her emails,
I'll release my taxes.

4201
03:00:28,860 --> 03:00:29,581
And it's like,
oh well,

4202
03:00:29,581 --> 03:00:30,550
which is it?
You know,

4203
03:00:30,610 --> 03:00:32,130
I think it was the Goldman Sachs
speeches,

4204
03:00:32,131 --> 03:00:33,000
wasn't it?
No,

4205
03:00:33,001 --> 03:00:34,920
he said emails.
He said emails,

4206
03:00:35,040 --> 03:00:36,150
so he's lying.
You know,

4207
03:00:36,151 --> 03:00:37,740
it's just a way of lying.
I'm under audit,

4208
03:00:37,741 --> 03:00:39,840
which there is no technical reason that
you couldn't.

4209
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:41,670
But then he says,
but if she does hers,

4210
03:00:41,860 --> 03:00:43,380
you know that thing I'll do,
I'll do it.

4211
03:00:43,410 --> 03:00:46,380
Well there's no technical reason,
but that's his argument.

4212
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:49,320
It's like while they're auditing him,
he's not going to do it cause he doesn't

4213
03:00:49,321 --> 03:00:50,490
have to write.
You know,

4214
03:00:50,491 --> 03:00:54,090
which does make sense.
Like if they are auditing him like why

4215
03:00:54,091 --> 03:00:56,490
he wouldn't want to like open it up to
public discourse.

4216
03:00:56,550 --> 03:00:57,360
Right.
So that,

4217
03:00:57,360 --> 03:01:00,100
so that in itself may be,
but the idea

4218
03:01:00,100 --> 03:01:01,590
that,
but if she realizes her emails off,

4219
03:01:01,591 --> 03:01:03,790
forget that whole thing with the audit
and I'll go ahead and do it like that.

4220
03:01:03,860 --> 03:01:07,830
You think though that that would,
if he did releases taxes while they were

4221
03:01:07,831 --> 03:01:11,040
auditing him,
it could positively effect for sure.

4222
03:01:11,041 --> 03:01:13,770
Cause it would affect public opinion.
And we know for a fact that public

4223
03:01:13,771 --> 03:01:17,730
opinion has had a big impact on things
that may,

4224
03:01:17,731 --> 03:01:18,091
you know,
if,

4225
03:01:18,091 --> 03:01:20,850
if people didn't,
they didn't get outraged about it.

4226
03:01:21,090 --> 03:01:24,510
Maybe the president or whoever's in
charge wouldn't move in a certain

4227
03:01:24,511 --> 03:01:25,260
direction.
Right.

4228
03:01:25,260 --> 03:01:25,680
Right.

4229
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:27,810
Well that's,
but that's the point is that if you want

4230
03:01:27,811 --> 03:01:29,880
this,
if you feel that this stuff is broken,

4231
03:01:29,881 --> 03:01:33,600
that the tax system is broken and all
these guys that can hide money in,

4232
03:01:33,660 --> 03:01:34,260
uh,
you know,

4233
03:01:34,260 --> 03:01:35,700
offshore accounts.
If you think all that's broken,

4234
03:01:36,030 --> 03:01:37,920
don't be upset at the businessman who
used it.

4235
03:01:37,921 --> 03:01:41,250
Now that doesn't mean what he was doing
was ethical or whatever.

4236
03:01:41,880 --> 03:01:43,050
Maybe it was,
maybe it wasn't.

4237
03:01:43,051 --> 03:01:44,700
That's,
that's a different conversation.

4238
03:01:44,701 --> 03:01:48,010
But you have to be upset at the people
who put the laws in place that allow

4239
03:01:48,011 --> 03:01:51,450
this to happen.
Any businessman just uses the system as

4240
03:01:51,451 --> 03:01:53,280
it exists.
So when all these people are like,

4241
03:01:53,281 --> 03:01:55,230
well,
trump makes his ties in Mexico.

4242
03:01:55,770 --> 03:01:58,560
Yeah.
He's a smart businessman in that regard.

4243
03:01:58,561 --> 03:02:03,030
He uses cheap Mexican labor if you're
upset and that that is the reality than

4244
03:02:03,031 --> 03:02:05,400
be upset at the people who set up those
trade deals.

4245
03:02:05,590 --> 03:02:08,440
But isn't the issue really not the,
does the stuff in Mexico,

4246
03:02:08,441 --> 03:02:12,190
the issue is that he does it in Mexico,
but it only pays people at tiny amount

4247
03:02:12,191 --> 03:02:15,370
of money.
If somebody opened up a plant in Mexico

4248
03:02:15,371 --> 03:02:18,610
and paid people American wages,
there would be no incentive whatsoever

4249
03:02:18,611 --> 03:02:22,090
to go to Mexico.
We should have laws as human beings and

4250
03:02:22,091 --> 03:02:23,860
what we're,
what we allow.

4251
03:02:23,861 --> 03:02:25,960
And not just in America,
you can't just say,

4252
03:02:25,961 --> 03:02:28,360
you go past this line,
there's a rock over there.

4253
03:02:28,361 --> 03:02:31,090
Once you pass that rock,
you can pay him 7 cents an hour.

4254
03:02:31,180 --> 03:02:33,880
But over here we get 11 bucks.
You fuck right,

4255
03:02:34,170 --> 03:02:36,670
right.
So team Merica world police.

4256
03:02:36,780 --> 03:02:39,480
Yeah.
So I'm not defending the ethics of his

4257
03:02:39,481 --> 03:02:41,580
business practices,
I'm just saying all a bit.

4258
03:02:41,581 --> 03:02:42,331
As you said,
they're,

4259
03:02:42,331 --> 03:02:46,260
they're beholding to their stock shares
and their holders and all that stuff.

4260
03:02:46,500 --> 03:02:48,930
So I'm just saying if he didn't do
anything illegal,

4261
03:02:48,990 --> 03:02:51,600
then he just did.
He just played the system.

4262
03:02:51,601 --> 03:02:55,230
So you should be angry at the system and
you can say he's immoral or took

4263
03:02:55,231 --> 03:02:58,920
advantage in a way that a more less
unscrupulous business person may not

4264
03:02:58,921 --> 03:03:00,330
have.
And maybe that's the type of person you

4265
03:03:00,331 --> 03:03:01,920
would want to work with and not a Donald
Trump.

4266
03:03:02,540 --> 03:03:04,690
But that's why this is really complex.
And we instead,

4267
03:03:04,710 --> 03:03:07,470
people look at the ties in Mexico and
they go see he's a hypocrite and it's

4268
03:03:07,471 --> 03:03:11,750
like not quite the truth.
Well he is.

4269
03:03:11,780 --> 03:03:13,470
He's a,
he's a hypocrite for a minute.

4270
03:03:14,360 --> 03:03:16,410
He's a hypocrite.
I mean he was talking about of

4271
03:03:16,411 --> 03:03:18,240
corporations go over to Mexico.
It will,

4272
03:03:18,241 --> 03:03:20,910
we'll find them to the tune of 35% yeah.
Okay,

4273
03:03:20,911 --> 03:03:22,200
but you were already there.
No,

4274
03:03:22,230 --> 03:03:25,230
but if you're running for president and
you're making your ties over there,

4275
03:03:25,231 --> 03:03:26,630
you should stop.
Like,

4276
03:03:26,670 --> 03:03:29,280
cause you're saying there's something
wrong with the company taking their

4277
03:03:29,281 --> 03:03:32,760
stuff and moving over there and
profiting from it and taking jobs out of

4278
03:03:32,761 --> 03:03:33,750
America.
You do it.

4279
03:03:33,751 --> 03:03:35,070
I've already done it,
but I'm doing it right now.

4280
03:03:35,100 --> 03:03:36,540
So if you do it,
I'm going to find you.

4281
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:38,860
So that's a at least,
so you're making a distinction there

4282
03:03:38,861 --> 03:03:41,410
that in the course of this he could have
said,

4283
03:03:42,040 --> 03:03:46,390
I'm not going to do it any more to show
you that I'm going to be moral or

4284
03:03:46,391 --> 03:03:48,160
whatever you want to call it,
ethical or whatever.

4285
03:03:48,161 --> 03:03:48,994
I will stop.

4286
03:03:49,090 --> 03:03:51,880
It isn't the ethical moral way to do it,
to just pay them more.

4287
03:03:52,540 --> 03:03:53,051
Yeah,
of course.

4288
03:03:53,051 --> 03:03:56,080
But that's unfortunately we live in a
reality that,

4289
03:03:56,110 --> 03:03:58,550
you know,
that's what a loss so much it past that

4290
03:03:58,551 --> 03:04:00,320
as human beings that live in the United
States,

4291
03:04:00,321 --> 03:04:02,480
in the world,
the United States of America,

4292
03:04:02,481 --> 03:04:05,570
one of the most fortunate countries,
if not the most fortunate in the world.

4293
03:04:05,780 --> 03:04:09,770
We will respect our American privilege
and you know,

4294
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:14,920
not be willing to subjugate people that
live in impoverished countries too.

4295
03:04:15,380 --> 03:04:16,990
Like taking advantage of that.
Don't do,

4296
03:04:17,030 --> 03:04:20,150
don't take advantage of that.
An unfortunate circumstances like if

4297
03:04:20,151 --> 03:04:24,770
you're living in a very poor third world
country and a Nike factory opens up or

4298
03:04:24,771 --> 03:04:26,630
whatever,
you can't.

4299
03:04:27,230 --> 03:04:31,010
As a,
as a person who is aware that they have

4300
03:04:31,011 --> 03:04:34,760
the best like location roll the dice
that's available today.

4301
03:04:34,790 --> 03:04:37,610
You're living in America,
you're born here like the fact that

4302
03:04:37,611 --> 03:04:41,300
you're going to like make someone in
some other country work for essentially

4303
03:04:41,301 --> 03:04:44,660
with slave labor,
like the phone you buy this fucking

4304
03:04:44,661 --> 03:04:48,380
iphone having my hand is made in a
factory where they have nets around the

4305
03:04:48,381 --> 03:04:52,910
factory because so many people have
tried to kill themselves that they made

4306
03:04:52,911 --> 03:04:56,330
it where they catch you in a fucking net
when you jump off the roof because they

4307
03:04:56,331 --> 03:04:58,310
were cleaning up bodies off the ground.

4308
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:02,570
And when people defend it,
they defend it in the most bizarre way

4309
03:05:02,790 --> 03:05:04,090
they,
the defense is.

4310
03:05:04,310 --> 03:05:06,110
Yeah.
But the percentage of people that commit

4311
03:05:06,111 --> 03:05:09,650
suicide of those factories is very
similar to the percentage of people that

4312
03:05:09,880 --> 03:05:14,870
commit suicide and the culture factory.
No fucking money.

4313
03:05:14,871 --> 03:05:16,730
And they live at the factory and the
jumping off the roof.

4314
03:05:16,731 --> 03:05:17,720
That's,
you can't defend that.

4315
03:05:17,750 --> 03:05:19,940
No.
So then what do you make of our sort of

4316
03:05:19,941 --> 03:05:24,020
fake moralizing with this where you,
you are fully acknowledging we both have

4317
03:05:24,021 --> 03:05:25,760
this thing,
we both paid a lot of money for it.

4318
03:05:25,761 --> 03:05:28,580
We acknowledge,
we have the intellectual knowledge of

4319
03:05:28,581 --> 03:05:31,760
what you just said,
that they do some shady things and yet

4320
03:05:31,761 --> 03:05:35,150
at the same time all these people that
are doing the exact same thing with us

4321
03:05:35,151 --> 03:05:38,180
that have this phone will go buzzard
over the ties.

4322
03:05:38,210 --> 03:05:41,090
So we,
we picked we and that goes to this

4323
03:05:41,091 --> 03:05:45,170
side's everyone's picking aside so well
they can just go and ask you this guy.

4324
03:05:45,170 --> 03:05:46,820
They're going after this guy.
And then there's,

4325
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:49,310
there's validity to what they're saying.
Even though they have a phone that was

4326
03:05:49,311 --> 03:05:51,710
built by slaves,
there's still validity in what they're

4327
03:05:51,711 --> 03:05:52,730
saying.
And not only that,

4328
03:05:52,940 --> 03:05:56,390
I mean we had Shane Smith from vice on
one day and we were talking about the

4329
03:05:56,391 --> 03:05:58,750
cult [inaudible] cult Tran,
Colton,

4330
03:05:58,780 --> 03:06:01,760
that they had to take out of the ground,
the con in the Congo and how,

4331
03:06:01,790 --> 03:06:02,630
you know,
like the,

4332
03:06:02,631 --> 03:06:04,670
the,
the way they were getting a lot of the

4333
03:06:04,850 --> 03:06:08,840
elements that they use in cell phones,
it's fucking complete slave labor and

4334
03:06:08,841 --> 03:06:10,240
child labor.
I mean,

4335
03:06:10,250 --> 03:06:13,220
it's scary,
scary stuff when you get down to the

4336
03:06:13,221 --> 03:06:16,460
nitty gritty of how things are
manufactured and constructed in order

4337
03:06:16,461 --> 03:06:18,170
for us to get them at a reasonable
price,

4338
03:06:18,560 --> 03:06:19,670
then it's,
it's,

4339
03:06:19,710 --> 03:06:22,550
it's just really spooky that we're
willing to do that.

4340
03:06:23,120 --> 03:06:24,840
It's,
yeah,

4341
03:06:24,860 --> 03:06:25,710
it's,
it's just a,

4342
03:06:25,711 --> 03:06:26,980
we just sinked up there.
That was why,

4343
03:06:27,010 --> 03:06:28,370
I mean we,
it's partly,

4344
03:06:28,371 --> 03:06:31,210
it's just the unintended consequences of
wanting things,

4345
03:06:31,211 --> 03:06:33,350
you know?
It's also the unintended consequences of

4346
03:06:33,351 --> 03:06:36,170
having this business model of unlimited
growth.

4347
03:06:37,220 --> 03:06:41,720
And that what we're talking about about
trump having a sort of responsibility to

4348
03:06:41,721 --> 03:06:44,690
its shareholders,
just like apple having a responsibility

4349
03:06:44,691 --> 03:06:48,740
to their shareholders like this,
this thing of unlimited growth places

4350
03:06:48,741 --> 03:06:52,790
more allity at the end of the list of,
of motivations for what you're doing.

4351
03:06:52,970 --> 03:06:55,770
And there's a thing called diffusion of
responsibility that takes place when you

4352
03:06:55,771 --> 03:06:56,430
have a gigantic

4353
03:06:56,430 --> 03:06:59,220
group of people,
they call themselves a corporation.

4354
03:06:59,221 --> 03:07:01,050
You're just a little piece of that
corporation.

4355
03:07:01,290 --> 03:07:04,830
It's not like Dave Rubin's out there
making people work for 13 cents an hour.

4356
03:07:05,070 --> 03:07:06,990
No,
it's Microsoft or it's,

4357
03:07:06,991 --> 03:07:08,940
you know,
Hitachi or you know,

4358
03:07:08,941 --> 03:07:10,620
fill in the blank.
I don't know if those companies do bad

4359
03:07:10,621 --> 03:07:12,240
things,
but whatever company it is,

4360
03:07:12,241 --> 03:07:15,420
apple,
it's paying people ridiculously low

4361
03:07:15,421 --> 03:07:16,660
wages.
I mean,

4362
03:07:17,160 --> 03:07:18,840
that is what it is.
You know,

4363
03:07:19,010 --> 03:07:23,550
it's,
the corporation becomes this entity that

4364
03:07:23,551 --> 03:07:26,760
needs Zeros and ones and you have to
figure out a way to get them and you

4365
03:07:26,761 --> 03:07:28,710
can,
you get them by taking these people that

4366
03:07:28,711 --> 03:07:31,140
have worked for us for 20 years,
just fucking casting them out.

4367
03:07:31,320 --> 03:07:32,340
Can you do that?
Yeah,

4368
03:07:32,490 --> 03:07:33,330
but they,
they're good.

4369
03:07:33,331 --> 03:07:34,840
They do a good job.
Fuck them.

4370
03:07:35,130 --> 03:07:37,350
You cut them off and you make asphalt
face to the right,

4371
03:07:37,530 --> 03:07:39,300
work for extra hours a day.

4372
03:07:39,610 --> 03:07:42,900
So then you take instead,
think of all the executives and all the

4373
03:07:42,930 --> 03:07:46,650
mid level people that they've got up in
Cupertino making absurds amount of

4374
03:07:46,651 --> 03:07:47,640
money.
I'm not just talking about the

4375
03:07:47,641 --> 03:07:50,760
shareholders who cashed in on talking
about all those silicon valley guys

4376
03:07:50,761 --> 03:07:53,370
making an absurd amount of money.
I don't begrudge any of them any of that

4377
03:07:53,371 --> 03:07:55,290
money.
But imagine if all of them who could

4378
03:07:55,291 --> 03:08:00,180
live incredibly well on 10% of what they
have and funneled some of that money,

4379
03:08:00,181 --> 03:08:03,210
did the same people making their shit.
I'm not a socialist.

4380
03:08:03,211 --> 03:08:05,430
That's why I'm not even saying this
would be the right thing to do in any

4381
03:08:05,431 --> 03:08:06,720
way.
But like they,

4382
03:08:06,721 --> 03:08:09,060
those people all walk around with a
pretty clean conscience.

4383
03:08:09,500 --> 03:08:10,530
You know,
while they have,

4384
03:08:10,531 --> 03:08:11,610
you know,
the fancy,

4385
03:08:11,611 --> 03:08:15,210
you know they probably all have teslas
and all that shit and the people that

4386
03:08:15,211 --> 03:08:18,510
are literally making the shit,
not just the ones coming up with the,

4387
03:08:18,810 --> 03:08:21,790
the ideas in Cupertino cause they always
say you know,

4388
03:08:21,940 --> 03:08:25,680
Boto in Cupertino but meanwhile they
don't say made in China within that.

4389
03:08:25,710 --> 03:08:28,650
It is interesting how we really
distinguished very clearly the

4390
03:08:28,651 --> 03:08:32,160
difference between the person who has
the idea and the person who puts the

4391
03:08:32,161 --> 03:08:36,000
idea together with their fingers.
Like that's not nearly as valuable but

4392
03:08:36,001 --> 03:08:38,850
without that person putting it together.
Because whatever gets done,

4393
03:08:38,940 --> 03:08:43,500
like the manufacturing process does not
just include the people that buy the

4394
03:08:43,501 --> 03:08:45,930
machines.
That includes the people that work for

4395
03:08:45,931 --> 03:08:48,330
the people that buy the machines.
But the people that buy the machines get

4396
03:08:48,331 --> 03:08:50,250
so much more money than the people that
work for them.

4397
03:08:50,251 --> 03:08:53,730
And then the people that designed the
plans and give them to the people that

4398
03:08:53,731 --> 03:08:55,350
buy the machines,
they get even more money.

4399
03:08:55,740 --> 03:08:58,770
They get the most money.
The people who design the idea is most

4400
03:08:58,771 --> 03:09:02,940
important and I don't know if that's
because of like the nature of the thing

4401
03:09:03,330 --> 03:09:07,110
that like that it's,
it's set up that way because that's,

4402
03:09:07,111 --> 03:09:07,860
those are the people.

4403
03:09:07,860 --> 03:09:11,430
The people at the very top are the ones
who are going to expand this weird thing

4404
03:09:11,431 --> 03:09:14,400
that we're doing.
Expand this technological sort of

4405
03:09:14,401 --> 03:09:19,401
progression that just this ongoing wave
of improvement and innovation that we

4406
03:09:19,981 --> 03:09:22,800
demand.
We demand new better versions.

4407
03:09:22,801 --> 03:09:24,990
We not an iphone,
seven's a piece of shit.

4408
03:09:24,991 --> 03:09:28,290
When's the eight come out?
Do the aid's going to have hd reality

4409
03:09:28,291 --> 03:09:31,680
built in?
The question really at the end of the

4410
03:09:31,680 --> 03:09:35,760
day is are any of us happier or any of
us more functional or any of us more?

4411
03:09:36,450 --> 03:09:38,760
Yeah,
like what have we done here?

4412
03:09:38,790 --> 03:09:42,930
What have we done is any,
if they were to gauge happiness of the

4413
03:09:42,931 --> 03:09:47,460
average person who had the exact same
physical attributes as you that grew up

4414
03:09:47,461 --> 03:09:50,940
in the same town you grew up in in 1950
versus right now,

4415
03:09:50,970 --> 03:09:53,950
is there any quantifiable difference?
And I would

4416
03:09:53,980 --> 03:09:56,680
argue,
I would guess that basically it's no,

4417
03:09:56,830 --> 03:09:59,710
that doesn't mean this thing has done
incredible things cause Tahrir Square,

4418
03:09:59,711 --> 03:10:02,230
all the revolutions that haven't really
worked out the way they're supposed to,

4419
03:10:02,231 --> 03:10:05,860
but it connected people all over the
world and that's pretty awesome.

4420
03:10:05,861 --> 03:10:07,360
So it does,
of course it does great stuff.

4421
03:10:07,660 --> 03:10:10,930
But like in terms of what are we
actually chasing constantly,

4422
03:10:10,931 --> 03:10:12,760
as you said,
there is no end because once it's always

4423
03:10:12,761 --> 03:10:14,410
profit.
Well we got an mu,

4424
03:10:14,411 --> 03:10:14,711
nu,
nu,

4425
03:10:14,711 --> 03:10:15,071
nu,
NU,

4426
03:10:15,071 --> 03:10:16,660
nu.
Cause you're not chasing happiness,

4427
03:10:16,661 --> 03:10:18,550
you're not chasing fulfillment.
You're not chasing,

4428
03:10:18,760 --> 03:10:20,050
you know,
whatever the,

4429
03:10:20,051 --> 03:10:23,320
the end game of the human experiences,
you just chasing something.

4430
03:10:23,380 --> 03:10:26,320
I don't think it's for humans.
I think it's for the next thing.

4431
03:10:26,650 --> 03:10:29,440
I think we're setting it up for the next
thing or the little workers that are

4432
03:10:29,441 --> 03:10:31,510
building the shop for the machine
overlords.

4433
03:10:31,511 --> 03:10:33,670
Oh man,
we're the guys with the nats or we're

4434
03:10:33,671 --> 03:10:34,390
the guys with the nets.

4435
03:10:34,390 --> 03:10:38,710
We just don't think we are.
We're our thirst for technology is

4436
03:10:38,711 --> 03:10:43,360
probably connected in some way to this
thing wanting to emerge and that as we

4437
03:10:43,361 --> 03:10:46,720
become more and more materialistic and
interested in the latest and greatest,

4438
03:10:46,721 --> 03:10:51,310
we feel we fuel this,
this innovation and we're a part of it

4439
03:10:51,311 --> 03:10:54,670
whether we like it or know it or not.
That's why like as a human being,

4440
03:10:54,671 --> 03:10:57,820
it's very frustrating and confusing when
you're addicted to technology,

4441
03:10:58,120 --> 03:10:59,860
when you're caught up in it and locked
away in it.

4442
03:11:00,130 --> 03:11:03,970
And for me,
I find that the only way I stay happy as

4443
03:11:03,971 --> 03:11:07,180
by being involved in very physical
things like,

4444
03:11:07,181 --> 03:11:09,970
and I think that's one of the reasons
why record numbers of people are

4445
03:11:09,971 --> 03:11:12,520
depressed today.
I think they're not fulfilling the human

4446
03:11:12,521 --> 03:11:14,950
requirements,
their biological human requirements.

4447
03:11:15,250 --> 03:11:18,010
For me,
exercise is gigantic.

4448
03:11:18,011 --> 03:11:21,370
Meditation is also gigantic,
which I also consider a very physical

4449
03:11:21,371 --> 03:11:23,080
thing because it's,
it's a focus.

4450
03:11:23,080 --> 03:11:27,820
Concentration internally versus on
whatever bullshit is on my fucking

4451
03:11:27,821 --> 03:11:32,050
twitter feed or whatever facebook feed
or dealing with some nonsense about a

4452
03:11:32,051 --> 03:11:34,030
job you don't really give a fuck about.
Instead of that,

4453
03:11:34,031 --> 03:11:36,430
I'm focusing on things that are
important to me,

4454
03:11:36,431 --> 03:11:38,530
like the management of the actual mind
itself.

4455
03:11:39,190 --> 03:11:43,780
I think putting yourself in a
competition scenario is putting in

4456
03:11:43,781 --> 03:11:45,550
things where you have to perform under
pressure.

4457
03:11:45,670 --> 03:11:48,940
That's one of the reasons why people get
so addicted to Jujitsu because then it's

4458
03:11:48,941 --> 03:11:51,790
like this high level problem solving
thing that you're doing all the time and

4459
03:11:51,791 --> 03:11:56,200
it makes regular life seems so much more
easy to manage and regular dilemmas are

4460
03:11:56,201 --> 03:12:00,160
nothing compared to a fucking hundred 90
pound man who's built like a gorilla on

4461
03:12:00,161 --> 03:12:03,500
your back trying to choke you sleep.
That reminds me of the gym in West

4462
03:12:03,500 --> 03:12:06,610
Hollywood and actually
what I did there,

4463
03:12:06,990 --> 03:12:09,850
probing ladies and gentlemen,
but I think regardless,

4464
03:12:09,851 --> 03:12:10,600
it's happening.

4465
03:12:10,600 --> 03:12:13,060
It's happening to US regardless.
The technology in my mind,

4466
03:12:13,061 --> 03:12:16,060
nonsense and talking to you about
switching a windows 10 and a fucking

4467
03:12:16,270 --> 03:12:18,220
google phone,
this bullshit stupid.

4468
03:12:18,430 --> 03:12:20,320
It's not going to fix anything and I'm
not trying to,

4469
03:12:20,321 --> 03:12:23,530
I'm not claiming to not claiming that I
ever possibly could or have the

4470
03:12:23,531 --> 03:12:26,380
influence,
but what I'm saying is you as a human

4471
03:12:26,381 --> 03:12:31,381
being have an obligation to yourself.
To extract that happy juice out of your

4472
03:12:32,411 --> 03:12:36,640
body in a positive way.
And I don't think we're designed to sit

4473
03:12:36,641 --> 03:12:38,350
at desks.
I don't think we're designed for

4474
03:12:38,351 --> 03:12:40,930
fluorescent lights.
I don't think we're designed for movies

4475
03:12:41,260 --> 03:12:43,360
and all those things are great.
All those things are great,

4476
03:12:43,361 --> 03:12:46,060
but you got to manage the amount of
exposure you have.

4477
03:12:46,061 --> 03:12:48,040
Did that shit.
You have to manage the amount of

4478
03:12:48,041 --> 03:12:50,410
exposure.
You have to fictitional narratives.

4479
03:12:50,620 --> 03:12:53,750
You have to merit,
you have to manage the kind of exposure

4480
03:12:53,770 --> 03:12:55,580
you have to electronic influence.

4481
03:12:55,940 --> 03:12:57,530
You have to manage the,
there's just like,

4482
03:12:57,531 --> 03:12:59,330
you have to manage the type of people
that are in your life.

4483
03:12:59,331 --> 03:13:01,400
You around people that are complaining
all the time.

4484
03:13:01,730 --> 03:13:03,530
If you just around people that just wine
and like,

4485
03:13:03,531 --> 03:13:04,910
oh my God,
another day,

4486
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:07,520
Hey,
you know,

4487
03:13:07,521 --> 03:13:09,650
I'm sure you didn't see the movie,
but uh,

4488
03:13:09,740 --> 03:13:11,840
there was a,
this kid's movie about,

4489
03:13:11,841 --> 03:13:15,570
um,
inside out and it's about like this

4490
03:13:15,590 --> 03:13:17,360
girl's brain.
It's a little kids moving.

4491
03:13:17,361 --> 03:13:20,000
So all of my daughters,
but it's a little kid's movie about

4492
03:13:20,001 --> 03:13:22,700
like,
this girl has like these characters in

4493
03:13:22,701 --> 03:13:25,370
her brain.
One of them's anger and Lewis Black

4494
03:13:25,371 --> 03:13:26,990
place anger,
which is fucking awesome.

4495
03:13:27,410 --> 03:13:29,810
And uh,
and the other one is sadness and sad.

4496
03:13:29,811 --> 03:13:34,811
I was like molly and everything,
sadness touches becomes sadness.

4497
03:13:35,061 --> 03:13:37,790
Like everything turns blue.
It's kind of an interesting movie

4498
03:13:37,791 --> 03:13:39,110
because it's funny,
it's entertaining,

4499
03:13:39,111 --> 03:13:40,490
but it's also,
it's kind of,

4500
03:13:40,700 --> 03:13:43,040
there's a lesson to be learned for
children that like you can,

4501
03:13:43,041 --> 03:13:45,530
you can marinate in those fucking
thoughts.

4502
03:13:45,650 --> 03:13:48,260
You can allow those thoughts to
influence and touch all these different

4503
03:13:48,261 --> 03:13:50,690
aspects of your life.
Or you can figure out how to stop them,

4504
03:13:50,900 --> 03:13:52,220
like understand what they are.
These are,

4505
03:13:52,221 --> 03:13:56,000
these are these thoughts or it's almost
like a living thing,

4506
03:13:56,001 --> 03:13:59,840
like a life force and that living think
and grow if you feed it.

4507
03:14:00,140 --> 03:14:03,320
But if you don't feed it and you push
this side and you feed the positive

4508
03:14:03,321 --> 03:14:05,930
thing,
you can manage that little fucker might

4509
03:14:05,931 --> 03:14:08,450
not ever go away because you're not
living in a movie.

4510
03:14:08,810 --> 03:14:12,080
But you could definitely manage it way
better than you're doing if you don't

4511
03:14:12,081 --> 03:14:14,810
take conscious decisions and what kind
of energy you let into your life.

4512
03:14:14,910 --> 03:14:15,421
Yeah.
Well,

4513
03:14:15,421 --> 03:14:18,720
we all know people that are addicted to
their own pain or their own trauma,

4514
03:14:18,721 --> 03:14:21,540
their own story.
And no matter what you do,

4515
03:14:21,930 --> 03:14:23,670
you know you can't.
And they love it.

4516
03:14:23,730 --> 03:14:25,420
They love it.
We all have relatives like this or,

4517
03:14:25,430 --> 03:14:28,740
or friends and it's like,
you gotta do the work.

4518
03:14:28,741 --> 03:14:31,080
It is work.
Life is work.

4519
03:14:31,110 --> 03:14:32,550
It is,
it is endless.

4520
03:14:32,820 --> 03:14:36,150
It's endless till it's over.
And then you may regret not doing some

4521
03:14:36,151 --> 03:14:36,660
of the work.

4522
03:14:36,660 --> 03:14:39,360
It's also,
it's your [inaudible].

4523
03:14:39,380 --> 03:14:40,950
It's not,
there's no,

4524
03:14:41,040 --> 03:14:44,370
it's not like there's no options.
There are options to fit thought

4525
03:14:44,371 --> 03:14:47,520
patterns.
And if you just allow these like deeply

4526
03:14:47,521 --> 03:14:51,030
ingrained paths to exist in your mind,
where you immediately fall into

4527
03:14:51,031 --> 03:14:53,340
complaining and the woe is me.
It never works out for me.

4528
03:14:54,030 --> 03:14:57,780
You know,
someone sent me a text the other day

4529
03:14:57,781 --> 03:15:00,150
comparing to people.
There was two,

4530
03:15:00,160 --> 03:15:03,270
the same thing happened to,
people are at the same event and one

4531
03:15:03,271 --> 03:15:06,840
person had this horrific like,
like all my God,

4532
03:15:06,841 --> 03:15:08,490
this is terrible.
This is the worst,

4533
03:15:08,491 --> 03:15:10,610
is such a waste of my time.
And the other person was,

4534
03:15:10,620 --> 03:15:11,640
well,
uh,

4535
03:15:11,641 --> 03:15:14,100
it hasn't been good yet,
but there's still time,

4536
03:15:14,250 --> 03:15:15,780
exclamation point,
Smiley face.

4537
03:15:15,781 --> 03:15:17,400
I'm like,
this is a perfect example.

4538
03:15:17,401 --> 03:15:20,550
The difference between two different
people in the exact same experience

4539
03:15:20,700 --> 03:15:23,700
having two different patterns that they
allow their brain to go down.

4540
03:15:23,720 --> 03:15:27,360
Now what if you find that that guy's on
his zoloft that has an issue?

4541
03:15:27,390 --> 03:15:28,710
That's an issue,
right?

4542
03:15:28,711 --> 03:15:31,220
And that's what a lot of people do
instead of one.

4543
03:15:31,240 --> 03:15:33,810
And again,
this is not to disparage people who have

4544
03:15:33,811 --> 03:15:36,790
legitimate mental imbalances where they
need medication.

4545
03:15:36,810 --> 03:15:39,000
I have a bunch of friends that have had
that.

4546
03:15:39,270 --> 03:15:42,050
But the question with that is like,
is that nature or nurture?

4547
03:15:42,060 --> 03:15:44,880
Like what does it become,
what it was causing these negative

4548
03:15:44,881 --> 03:15:48,420
thoughts in your mind?
Is it a biological issue that you have

4549
03:15:48,421 --> 03:15:50,280
because part of you is not working
correctly,

4550
03:15:50,281 --> 03:15:53,670
which is entirely possible?
Or is it you've embraced these negative

4551
03:15:53,671 --> 03:15:56,910
thoughts and this negative program by
your family or by people that you hang

4552
03:15:56,911 --> 03:16:00,600
around with are bad influences and
you've embraced it to the point where

4553
03:16:00,601 --> 03:16:03,630
you're unable to take these positive
thought patterns.

4554
03:16:03,631 --> 03:16:05,730
You know,
you almost like have to go to a retreat.

4555
03:16:05,760 --> 03:16:08,370
They almost have to like kidnap you and
put you on some island somewhere where

4556
03:16:08,371 --> 03:16:10,380
somebody talks to you and he goes,
hey man,

4557
03:16:10,440 --> 03:16:12,360
this is,
this is life right now is life.

4558
03:16:12,510 --> 03:16:13,920
You don't have to get back to that
email.

4559
03:16:13,950 --> 03:16:15,490
You think I know you think you do.
Right.

4560
03:16:15,510 --> 03:16:18,090
You know you don't have to get back to
those people that are negative,

4561
03:16:18,091 --> 03:16:19,440
that are in your life.
You don't have to like,

4562
03:16:19,470 --> 03:16:21,120
this is life.
This right here,

4563
03:16:21,300 --> 03:16:22,950
breathe in,
breathe out.

4564
03:16:23,100 --> 03:16:26,070
You're alive.
You're also alive and maybe the greatest

4565
03:16:26,071 --> 03:16:28,350
fucking time the world has ever known.
I mean come on man.

4566
03:16:28,380 --> 03:16:30,360
There's never been,
it's never been easier to get food.

4567
03:16:30,450 --> 03:16:31,920
It's never been safer to walk the
streets.

4568
03:16:32,100 --> 03:16:34,170
There's never been more cool,
cool people to communicate with.

4569
03:16:34,240 --> 03:16:37,410
This is the best fucking time ever.
Like don't go woe is me.

4570
03:16:37,411 --> 03:16:38,780
Cause some girls want to suck your Dick
Anymore.

4571
03:16:38,790 --> 03:16:41,910
Just do we.
Can you just fucking stop and relax for

4572
03:16:41,911 --> 03:16:44,970
a moment?
If you were a 90 year old man living in

4573
03:16:44,971 --> 03:16:47,250
Ecuador,
you know that his whole life he had been

4574
03:16:47,251 --> 03:16:50,940
forced to be a farmer working for
pennies and eating fucking raw potatoes

4575
03:16:50,941 --> 03:16:53,190
and shit,
and someone gave you the opportunity to

4576
03:16:53,191 --> 03:16:56,310
come here and beat you.
Now how God damn happy would you be?

4577
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:58,140
You'd be so happy.
Well,

4578
03:16:58,141 --> 03:16:59,520
that is you.
That's you right now.

4579
03:16:59,521 --> 03:17:04,521
You won the lottery bitch and you're
still complaining and 99.9% of the

4580
03:17:05,101 --> 03:17:09,870
people listening have won the lottery in
comparison to all the other people that

4581
03:17:09,871 --> 03:17:12,740
they're going to come in contact with.
So in a lot of the other people,

4582
03:17:13,210 --> 03:17:15,210
you're,
you're almost making a case though,

4583
03:17:15,211 --> 03:17:19,020
for people to,
that the key to happiness in the midst

4584
03:17:19,021 --> 03:17:22,800
of this technological monstrosity that
were part of that.

4585
03:17:22,801 --> 03:17:26,940
The key really is to disconnect yourself
from it and there that comes with

4586
03:17:26,941 --> 03:17:28,050
certain costs too.

4587
03:17:28,140 --> 03:17:30,840
I don't think the disconnect,
I think to have discipline.

4588
03:17:31,260 --> 03:17:34,200
I think for me,
at least,

4589
03:17:34,340 --> 03:17:36,960
my,
my best happiness comes from when I have

4590
03:17:36,961 --> 03:17:40,260
discipline and avoiding the technology
or,

4591
03:17:40,290 --> 03:17:45,240
or limiting my access to the technology
and consciously choosing to do other

4592
03:17:45,241 --> 03:17:47,490
things.
You know,

4593
03:17:47,820 --> 03:17:50,160
get involved in other hobbies,
get involved in,

4594
03:17:50,190 --> 03:17:50,611
uh,
you know,

4595
03:17:50,611 --> 03:17:53,130
like whether it's yoga or archery or you
know,

4596
03:17:53,210 --> 03:17:55,170
go run marathons or go,
you know,

4597
03:17:55,200 --> 03:17:56,520
get involved in,
you know,

4598
03:17:56,521 --> 03:17:59,130
to go in or a Jujitsu tournament,
go,

4599
03:17:59,131 --> 03:18:00,270
uh,
climb a mountain.

4600
03:18:00,510 --> 03:18:05,430
There's things that people do that are
hard to do and you don't just do it to

4601
03:18:05,431 --> 03:18:08,280
get to the top of the mountain I think.
Or to,

4602
03:18:08,310 --> 03:18:09,450
you know,
finish the cross.

4603
03:18:09,451 --> 03:18:11,820
That line that you decided you're going
to run to.

4604
03:18:12,450 --> 03:18:14,280
You do it because you,
your,

4605
03:18:14,281 --> 03:18:18,960
your body requires it.
Your brain may require it like you as a

4606
03:18:18,961 --> 03:18:23,961
being as an entity,
problem solving and puzzle solving is a

4607
03:18:24,001 --> 03:18:27,420
part of who you are.
Overcoming adversity is a muscle that's

4608
03:18:27,421 --> 03:18:28,480
gotta be exercise.
Yeah.

4609
03:18:28,760 --> 03:18:31,560
Cause if it's not,
then once the shit hits the fan,

4610
03:18:31,680 --> 03:18:34,230
you fucking fall apart.
And we all know people like that.

4611
03:18:34,590 --> 03:18:37,500
They're just went,
one bad thing goes on in their life.

4612
03:18:37,710 --> 03:18:40,930
They become blabbering fucking idiots.
Yeah,

4613
03:18:41,310 --> 03:18:44,070
that's,
I mean that's why you gotta just push

4614
03:18:44,090 --> 03:18:45,750
you,
you like you have no choice in a way.

4615
03:18:45,751 --> 03:18:48,310
I guess once you see that,
which seems fairly

4616
03:18:48,310 --> 03:18:50,770
obvious to someone if you're awake
enough,

4617
03:18:50,920 --> 03:18:53,560
once you see it,
you gotta just push and push and push

4618
03:18:53,830 --> 03:18:55,780
and you will fail.
As I've said several times,

4619
03:18:55,781 --> 03:18:58,810
like you're going to fail at it and I
fail at it all the time where suddenly

4620
03:18:58,930 --> 03:19:00,340
three hours went by and I go,
Oh shit,

4621
03:19:00,341 --> 03:19:05,200
I just stared at twitter but three hours
literally just taking my dog for a walk

4622
03:19:05,590 --> 03:19:08,780
sometimes that that would just reset it
and then I feel better after that.

4623
03:19:08,800 --> 03:19:10,030
Yeah.
And if you don't do that,

4624
03:19:10,240 --> 03:19:14,170
it's taking that step,
get yourself to take that step and just

4625
03:19:14,171 --> 03:19:16,630
once you're doing something,
it's usually pretty easy to do it.

4626
03:19:16,840 --> 03:19:19,590
Like once you're working out,
it's pretty easy to be there once your

4627
03:19:19,591 --> 03:19:20,231
start like,
oh,

4628
03:19:20,231 --> 03:19:22,090
this is what I'm doing now and I
actually started enjoying it.

4629
03:19:22,091 --> 03:19:26,020
It's making yourself take that step.
You know like this is a lot of times for

4630
03:19:26,021 --> 03:19:28,300
Yoga class where I'm like I could just
stay here.

4631
03:19:28,470 --> 03:19:31,450
I watch TV,
I fucking put my feet up and do nothing.

4632
03:19:31,451 --> 03:19:32,620
Man,
I'm feeling kind of sore.

4633
03:19:32,800 --> 03:19:35,230
Maybe I should relax.
Like your brain starts playing all these

4634
03:19:35,231 --> 03:19:39,400
fucking mind games with you but when you
do go to yoga class and you take that

4635
03:19:39,401 --> 03:19:41,350
class in,
90 minutes later you've lost fucking

4636
03:19:41,380 --> 03:19:44,740
eight pounds of sweat and you've been
freaking out and almost blacking out.

4637
03:19:44,890 --> 03:19:46,000
When you get out of there you feel
better.

4638
03:19:46,030 --> 03:19:47,350
I feel better.
I feel way better.

4639
03:19:47,351 --> 03:19:52,351
And it gives you also I think momentum
and motivation to continue with the rest

4640
03:19:52,811 --> 03:19:55,180
of your life too to keep pushing
forward.

4641
03:19:55,320 --> 03:19:59,710
What do you think about um,
the fact that you are your own boss

4642
03:19:59,740 --> 03:20:01,330
also?
Cause pretty much I,

4643
03:20:01,331 --> 03:20:02,740
you know,
I know you have outside gigs too,

4644
03:20:02,741 --> 03:20:04,930
but for the most part,
probably 90% of what you do,

4645
03:20:04,931 --> 03:20:07,390
I would guess is,
is you are in charge of the,

4646
03:20:07,840 --> 03:20:10,000
the ultimate decisions if not 100%.

4647
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,100
Maybe it's,
well not the UFC.

4648
03:20:12,101 --> 03:20:14,930
The UFC is my one job that I have,
but right.

4649
03:20:15,210 --> 03:20:16,540
And it's still,
it's a job,

4650
03:20:16,541 --> 03:20:20,200
but it's the greatest job I've ever had.
That's what he was a super pleasure.

4651
03:20:20,500 --> 03:20:21,830
And it's also,
um,

4652
03:20:21,910 --> 03:20:26,350
it's an honor and it's also,
there's a massive obligation to respect

4653
03:20:26,351 --> 03:20:30,460
and represent the people that are
competing in what I think is one of the

4654
03:20:30,461 --> 03:20:33,370
most difficult physical endeavors in all
of sports,

4655
03:20:33,730 --> 03:20:36,670
if not the most.
I think it's incredibly difficult to do.

4656
03:20:36,730 --> 03:20:40,300
And I feel like I'm in a very privileged
position to represent those people.

4657
03:20:40,720 --> 03:20:42,280
But yeah,
I like it that I don't need it.

4658
03:20:42,730 --> 03:20:44,020
Yeah.
I love that.

4659
03:20:44,050 --> 03:20:45,010
I love that.
I love,

4660
03:20:45,011 --> 03:20:47,890
I like not having a boss man.
Even though my boss is amazing,

4661
03:20:48,250 --> 03:20:50,410
you know,
that job was the greatest job of all

4662
03:20:50,411 --> 03:20:53,350
time.
I like doing things when I want to do

4663
03:20:53,351 --> 03:20:55,840
them too,
but it's not like I'm lazy.

4664
03:20:55,870 --> 03:20:58,850
So I pushed myself to do a lot of shit
and I,

4665
03:20:59,010 --> 03:21:01,270
you know,
I have goals and accomplish them or

4666
03:21:01,271 --> 03:21:02,530
attempt to,
and I have,

4667
03:21:02,560 --> 03:21:04,510
you know,
commitments as far as like writing and

4668
03:21:04,840 --> 03:21:07,510
performing and producing things.
But um,

4669
03:21:07,870 --> 03:21:09,160
yeah,
being your own boss,

4670
03:21:09,161 --> 03:21:10,510
man,
if you could pull it off,

4671
03:21:10,511 --> 03:21:13,180
it's like the greatest thing ever
because it's not work anymore.

4672
03:21:13,600 --> 03:21:15,470
It's like you're working for yourself,
but you're,

4673
03:21:15,490 --> 03:21:17,690
you're doing things instead of working
like that,

4674
03:21:17,800 --> 03:21:19,030
punching in.
I mean,

4675
03:21:19,031 --> 03:21:22,090
I went independent in June,
so it's only,

4676
03:21:22,091 --> 03:21:25,840
I'm not even six months out of that.
And not only was it the smartest

4677
03:21:25,900 --> 03:21:29,560
business decision I ever made,
which partly was because I saw guys like

4678
03:21:29,561 --> 03:21:31,970
you and Corolla and a couple other guys
that will,

4679
03:21:31,990 --> 03:21:32,800
I was like,
wait a minute.

4680
03:21:32,800 --> 03:21:37,120
They built great brands.
They have their fans and they're doing

4681
03:21:37,121 --> 03:21:37,670
it.
Like I,

4682
03:21:37,670 --> 03:21:38,500
it was like,
I was like,

4683
03:21:38,500 --> 03:21:40,120
oh,
there's actual template for this.

4684
03:21:40,300 --> 03:21:42,190
If I,
if I built my audience correctly.

4685
03:21:42,400 --> 03:21:44,740
And I just took the risk and said,
you know,

4686
03:21:44,741 --> 03:21:45,890
let's see what happens.
And

4687
03:21:46,070 --> 03:21:47,900
we know we launched this patrion
campaign,

4688
03:21:47,901 --> 03:21:50,060
which is where fans can donate per
month,

4689
03:21:50,061 --> 03:21:51,170
whatever they want so that,
you know,

4690
03:21:51,171 --> 03:21:53,060
do you do like two bucks to get a
newsletter?

4691
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:56,420
We people that donate 250 and I skyped
with them every month and like a whole

4692
03:21:56,421 --> 03:21:59,120
bunch of different things.
I didn't know when I woke up the next

4693
03:21:59,120 --> 03:22:01,650
morning after we launched it,
they might've been over my career,

4694
03:22:01,670 --> 03:22:04,790
literally might've been over like just
like that because I quit my job.

4695
03:22:04,791 --> 03:22:06,620
I had no,
I had no job.

4696
03:22:06,621 --> 03:22:07,940
My producer had no job.
My director,

4697
03:22:07,941 --> 03:22:09,020
I had no job,
no insurance,

4698
03:22:09,021 --> 03:22:13,610
no nothing.
And I woke up and our fans showed up and

4699
03:22:13,611 --> 03:22:15,500
they took care of us.
And because of that,

4700
03:22:15,501 --> 03:22:18,770
now in the six months since then,
now I bought this House and build in the

4701
03:22:18,771 --> 03:22:22,760
studio and we're figuring out all other
ways to to make deals and all that kind

4702
03:22:22,761 --> 03:22:25,110
of stuff and it's incorrect.

4703
03:22:25,190 --> 03:22:27,860
But I still wake up sometimes.
This is my point was I still wake up

4704
03:22:27,861 --> 03:22:28,730
sometimes I'm like,
wait a minute.

4705
03:22:28,731 --> 03:22:31,010
So I have to answer to somebody.
Like I have a feeling it's just a

4706
03:22:31,011 --> 03:22:31,791
feeling,
you know,

4707
03:22:31,791 --> 03:22:32,690
like,
wow,

4708
03:22:32,691 --> 03:22:34,000
I can't believe this.
I,

4709
03:22:34,360 --> 03:22:37,220
I make the decision here and a way like
that,

4710
03:22:37,280 --> 03:22:39,470
that hunger that,
that you know,

4711
03:22:39,471 --> 03:22:43,310
that fear that to take that chance and
to do things,

4712
03:22:43,550 --> 03:22:46,760
that's like one of the best things you
could ever have in life because it's the

4713
03:22:46,761 --> 03:22:48,410
motivator.
If you don't,

4714
03:22:48,470 --> 03:22:50,960
if you're not like a woe is me,
I'm always going to be a loser.

4715
03:22:50,961 --> 03:22:52,820
If you're a person who really tries to
do something,

4716
03:22:52,850 --> 03:22:57,260
risk taking is so God damn critical
because it forces you to action and it

4717
03:22:57,261 --> 03:23:00,920
forces you to be inspired and to get
fired up and that's when things really

4718
03:23:00,921 --> 03:23:03,160
take place.
It really is like that's,

4719
03:23:03,170 --> 03:23:05,960
and that's one of the things that Scott
Adams had said sort of about the

4720
03:23:05,961 --> 03:23:10,550
election is that there's such chaos now,
but whatever happens after out of chaos,

4721
03:23:10,790 --> 03:23:12,230
something new will happen.

4722
03:23:12,270 --> 03:23:14,050
May Not be good immediately.
May Not be bad.

4723
03:23:14,051 --> 03:23:15,440
I mean,
we don't know what that will be,

4724
03:23:15,650 --> 03:23:17,360
but the chaos,
the chance,

4725
03:23:17,480 --> 03:23:20,210
the risk will now allow for something
else to happen.

4726
03:23:20,211 --> 03:23:22,220
So all these people who,
you know,

4727
03:23:22,221 --> 03:23:24,590
all these pundits who got everything
wrong for the last year,

4728
03:23:24,591 --> 03:23:27,120
and oh well it's going to be a rubio,
it's going to be cruise,

4729
03:23:27,180 --> 03:23:27,401
blah,
blah,

4730
03:23:27,401 --> 03:23:29,150
blah.
It's like they'll now tell you

4731
03:23:29,151 --> 03:23:31,730
everything else that there is going to
happen for the next year and they're

4732
03:23:31,731 --> 03:23:34,110
going to get all that wrong.
But out of chaos,

4733
03:23:34,240 --> 03:23:35,540
that happens.
And that's what I realized.

4734
03:23:35,541 --> 03:23:37,820
I had a path,
I had a salary and I was doing fine.

4735
03:23:37,821 --> 03:23:40,430
And I liked working at Ora and Larry
King's been great to me and it was all

4736
03:23:40,431 --> 03:23:43,340
good.
But I just had this feeling of like,

4737
03:23:43,820 --> 03:23:45,500
I gotta try this.
I got to try this.

4738
03:23:46,160 --> 03:23:48,230
You get a very different position if it
didn't work,

4739
03:23:48,231 --> 03:23:48,740
you know?

4740
03:23:48,740 --> 03:23:50,870
Yeah.
You don't want to be that guy who just

4741
03:23:50,871 --> 03:23:54,170
wishes they took that chance and you're
still working for some company and they

4742
03:23:54,171 --> 03:23:55,850
still treat like shit.
I mean,

4743
03:23:55,851 --> 03:23:58,540
because that's,
you know,

4744
03:23:58,850 --> 03:24:00,680
in that sense,
you're the person making the phones.

4745
03:24:00,681 --> 03:24:03,800
You're not the person with the idea and
the person with the idea.

4746
03:24:03,801 --> 03:24:06,200
Especially if you're a smart guy like
you are,

4747
03:24:07,560 --> 03:24:11,180
it's you do yourself a disservice if you
don't express yourself completely,

4748
03:24:11,181 --> 03:24:16,040
fully and without any reserve or any
reservations.

4749
03:24:16,100 --> 03:24:18,110
And when you work for someone,
you'll always have a reservation.

4750
03:24:18,111 --> 03:24:19,070
You're always worried,
man.

4751
03:24:19,071 --> 03:24:21,980
You're always,
you always like biting your tongue or

4752
03:24:21,981 --> 03:24:24,710
flavoring your words or you know,
they come into your office and go,

4753
03:24:24,711 --> 03:24:26,360
Dave,
you've been really hard on Clinton.

4754
03:24:26,390 --> 03:24:29,010
I think it's really important for Mike.
You know the,

4755
03:24:29,011 --> 03:24:33,830
the produce a producer is a,
he's got Hashtag I'm with her on his

4756
03:24:33,831 --> 03:24:36,590
twitter account and we just wanted you
to just think about doing that,

4757
03:24:36,800 --> 03:24:39,380
like criticized her if he choose to,
but be balanced,

4758
03:24:39,680 --> 03:24:41,620
be balanced and you're being real like
you're,

4759
03:24:41,740 --> 03:24:43,410
you're being silly,
but you're also being real.

4760
03:24:44,100 --> 03:24:46,740
That is the real shit that's going on.
Hashtag I'm with her.

4761
03:24:46,760 --> 03:24:47,593
Yeah.
You know,

4762
03:24:47,700 --> 03:24:50,400
you've got to have a Hashtag Jeanette,
the president of the company is going to

4763
03:24:50,401 --> 03:24:52,710
come down and talk to you about a lot of
the things you said.

4764
03:24:52,720 --> 03:24:56,190
I don't necessarily disagree,
have been kind of misogynist,

4765
03:24:56,220 --> 03:24:56,680
you know,
and,

4766
03:24:56,680 --> 03:24:59,070
and maybe just a little bit unsupportive
of women's issues.

4767
03:24:59,310 --> 03:25:01,590
And uh,
this company is very progressive and we

4768
03:25:01,591 --> 03:25:05,010
really feel strongly that that's the
kind of shit that p that and you don't

4769
03:25:05,040 --> 03:25:08,070
get to very progressive.
So you should think exactly like you

4770
03:25:08,071 --> 03:25:11,070
have to be Dave Ruben with a mortgage
who's worried about losing his job,

4771
03:25:11,260 --> 03:25:13,080
then that's,
that's not good for business.

4772
03:25:13,081 --> 03:25:15,420
It's not good for thinking it's not good
for humans.

4773
03:25:15,421 --> 03:25:17,220
It's not good for the business of
culture.

4774
03:25:17,540 --> 03:25:19,070
And I don't mean business,
but the,

4775
03:25:19,071 --> 03:25:21,060
the endeavour,
the Endeavour of culture,

4776
03:25:21,330 --> 03:25:25,770
the endeavor of culture requires like
sort of some sort of an open discourse,

4777
03:25:26,040 --> 03:25:26,370
you know?

4778
03:25:26,370 --> 03:25:28,650
And that includes shit like wikileaks.
Okay.

4779
03:25:28,651 --> 03:25:32,220
That's a part of the open discourse when
you tell someone like Chelsea manning

4780
03:25:32,400 --> 03:25:35,580
that they can't let anybody know about
this horrific shit that's going on,

4781
03:25:35,581 --> 03:25:36,570
that you know,
is illegal.

4782
03:25:36,960 --> 03:25:39,090
You've,
you've set up this sort of a system

4783
03:25:39,091 --> 03:25:41,010
where you're stopping data from going
through it.

4784
03:25:41,011 --> 03:25:43,380
You're stopping people from
communicating and you're going to

4785
03:25:43,381 --> 03:25:47,940
ultimately stop people from expressing
their opinions on what was communicated,

4786
03:25:47,941 --> 03:25:50,340
which is going to stop progress.
A Russian hacker,

4787
03:25:50,920 --> 03:25:55,410
the shit must be,
I'm just stuck pot smoking hippies,

4788
03:25:56,130 --> 03:26:00,300
but no hair.
All of us are just fucking people.

4789
03:26:00,330 --> 03:26:02,130
Dave Rubin,
and I think that's one of the things

4790
03:26:02,131 --> 03:26:06,150
that's going to come out when the dust
settles and we pick a new king or queen,

4791
03:26:06,870 --> 03:26:09,420
we're going to figure it out.
Anything's going to happen now that we

4792
03:26:09,421 --> 03:26:11,730
been talking to is going to win and
everyone's going to hate her and it's

4793
03:26:11,731 --> 03:26:16,731
going to be record record number of
people that are intolerant and say crazy

4794
03:26:17,221 --> 03:26:19,530
shit and you know,
and we're going to have to all figure

4795
03:26:19,531 --> 03:26:20,490
out a way to get along.

4796
03:26:21,090 --> 03:26:24,840
Do you see any situation where we wake
up tomorrow night that trump's

4797
03:26:24,841 --> 03:26:26,670
president?
100% yeah.

4798
03:26:26,700 --> 03:26:27,533
Yeah,
I do.

4799
03:26:27,600 --> 03:26:29,280
I don't think it's going to happen.
I would think.

4800
03:26:29,640 --> 03:26:31,680
I think most likely Hillary's going to
win.

4801
03:26:31,681 --> 03:26:36,681
But I absolutely could see just some
giant fuck up where the mass media has

4802
03:26:38,461 --> 03:26:42,720
been lied to by polls and by public
opinion.

4803
03:26:42,721 --> 03:26:46,350
And I don't think necessarily polls are
very accurate anymore because I don't

4804
03:26:46,351 --> 03:26:48,180
think people choose to take polls very
often.

4805
03:26:48,240 --> 03:26:51,330
Mostly call land lines.
When's the last time you had an exact a

4806
03:26:51,331 --> 03:26:53,880
mundo?
I had a joke about that in my last

4807
03:26:53,881 --> 03:26:55,060
special,
but like,

4808
03:26:55,380 --> 03:26:59,880
like maybe you're dealing with 1%,
like the problem with polls is the

4809
03:26:59,881 --> 03:27:01,540
people who answer polls.
Yeah.

4810
03:27:01,590 --> 03:27:03,360
That's the problem.
Have you ever been pulled?

4811
03:27:03,361 --> 03:27:04,194
Ever?
Never.

4812
03:27:04,200 --> 03:27:05,040
Yeah,
exactly.

4813
03:27:05,041 --> 03:27:05,930
Exactly.
So it's,

4814
03:27:05,931 --> 03:27:09,090
it's a weird thing that we're doing here
where we're basing that on Poles.

4815
03:27:09,090 --> 03:27:11,190
Exit polls are different.
It's a little bit different,

4816
03:27:11,400 --> 03:27:13,090
but that was way off,
um,

4817
03:27:13,170 --> 03:27:15,410
during with Al Gore,
right?

4818
03:27:15,480 --> 03:27:16,980
I mean they,
the predicted Al Gore to be,

4819
03:27:17,220 --> 03:27:18,960
apparently he was like the popular
winter,

4820
03:27:18,961 --> 03:27:22,590
right when he won the popular,
why doesn't he run,

4821
03:27:23,130 --> 03:27:24,630
Fuck's going on?
And I'm not a huge,

4822
03:27:24,631 --> 03:27:26,250
I know,
it's very cool to say like,

4823
03:27:27,090 --> 03:27:29,160
I'm not an outdoor guy.
Yeah.

4824
03:27:29,220 --> 03:27:30,630
You know,
you know what Al Gore did?

4825
03:27:30,631 --> 03:27:33,690
He uh,
he created current television.

4826
03:27:33,691 --> 03:27:34,770
Right.
And then that,

4827
03:27:34,800 --> 03:27:36,780
you know,
then eventually when he,

4828
03:27:36,781 --> 03:27:39,420
it was a failure as a network.
It was purging money.

4829
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:40,590
Right.
And then he had a choice.

4830
03:27:40,591 --> 03:27:42,160
He could see you had a couple offers

4831
03:27:42,160 --> 03:27:43,750
on the table,
could have sold it to Glenn Beck,

4832
03:27:43,780 --> 03:27:45,700
but I guess he doesn't like Glenn's back
politics.

4833
03:27:45,701 --> 03:27:47,830
That's fine.
He sold it to Al Jazeera,

4834
03:27:47,860 --> 03:27:52,390
which is owned by the government of
Qatar that puts out more fossil fuel,

4835
03:27:52,420 --> 03:27:53,860
oil,
garbage,

4836
03:27:53,861 --> 03:27:55,930
the same stuff that he rails against all
day long.

4837
03:27:56,110 --> 03:27:58,300
And he sold him that.
So he basically did the producers,

4838
03:27:58,450 --> 03:28:02,580
he used all his,
all of his connections and money as a

4839
03:28:02,581 --> 03:28:06,100
vice president to get a network on the
air because it's incredibly hard to get

4840
03:28:06,101 --> 03:28:08,860
into the cable system.
So he used all his leverage to get

4841
03:28:08,861 --> 03:28:10,180
there,
created a failure.

4842
03:28:10,181 --> 03:28:12,950
And he walked away,
I think with $500 million and it was all

4843
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:16,900
funded Qatar.
And it was in many ways funded by his

4844
03:28:16,901 --> 03:28:20,190
humanitarian campaign to alert the world
the dangers of global one.

4845
03:28:20,191 --> 03:28:22,180
Yeah.
That was what gave him credibility.

4846
03:28:22,210 --> 03:28:23,620
So he,
that's a cosby situation.

4847
03:28:24,470 --> 03:28:27,730
It's a card.
And on that note,

4848
03:28:27,790 --> 03:28:29,420
we're gonna wrap it up with that.
Dave Rubin.

4849
03:28:29,421 --> 03:28:32,170
That was just a three and a half hours.
Holy Shit.

4850
03:28:32,200 --> 03:28:33,670
Yeah.
I honestly had no idea.

4851
03:28:33,671 --> 03:28:35,410
I have no,
when I'm on stage or when I'm doing my

4852
03:28:35,411 --> 03:28:36,880
show,
I have no sense of time.

4853
03:28:36,910 --> 03:28:38,530
So don't do three and a half hour shows.
Man.

4854
03:28:38,531 --> 03:28:41,320
People get pissed.
They look at their wall with the longest

4855
03:28:41,321 --> 03:28:41,981
one.
Was it?

4856
03:28:41,981 --> 03:28:43,060
Was it sam?
Four hours.

4857
03:28:43,150 --> 03:28:44,440
What's your longest one?
Oh,

4858
03:28:44,441 --> 03:28:47,980
I don't know man.
I'm five and a half for fight

4859
03:28:47,981 --> 03:28:49,150
companions.
No Shit.

4860
03:28:49,230 --> 03:28:51,370
Yeah,
we've done some long fucking podcast in

4861
03:28:51,371 --> 03:28:52,930
here.
I can't shut the fuck up.

4862
03:28:53,400 --> 03:28:54,460
Yeah.
Good job for me.

4863
03:28:54,520 --> 03:28:56,680
Listen,
I am now going to publicly,

4864

but I'm publicly you gotta you gotta

4865
03:28:59,260 --> 03:29:00,520

I'll do it.

4866
03:29:00,521 --> 03:29:02,770
I know you will.
I'll do it a little guilty at the end.

4867
03:29:02,771 --> 03:29:06,290
If we've had a nice report here,
there's a been a great conversation and

4868
03:29:06,600 --> 03:29:08,290
how to get your podcast,
where can they go to?

4869
03:29:08,320 --> 03:29:13,320
youtube.com/rubin report,
Ruben report.com [inaudible] on twitter.

Yeah.
