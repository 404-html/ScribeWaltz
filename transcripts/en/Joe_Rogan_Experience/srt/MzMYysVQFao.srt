1
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,360
Now we're live on new stream.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,770
It's a series of events
that have to take place.

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:08,700
Tommy buns.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,751
I like it,

5
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,640
including me shutting off my laptop.

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,923
Oh really?

7
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,380
No.

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:13,650
My,

9
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,220
my uh,

10
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,020
my volume.

11
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,190
I'm,

12
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,023
I'm a retard.

13
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,330
I always leave it on and it always,

14
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:18,960
I always,

15
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,600
there's like a checklist of shit that I
should do for the podcast starts number

16
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:21,751
one.

17
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:23,940
It turned the volume off of my
laptop so I don't hear myself.

18
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,383
So that's stupid.

19
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,640
Right?

20
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,170
I'm sure we should.

21
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,530
We should put together a list,

22
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,820
put together a list checklist.

23
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,810
I need to get my shit together.

24
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,670
Me,

25
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,000
it doesn't look like
it's getting any better.

26
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,910
The Joe Rogan experience podcast
is brought to you by on it.

27
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,261
If you go to o,

28
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:45,261
n n I t he will check out some manly
shit like kettle bells and battle ropes.

29
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,510
That's the kind of Shit I be using lately.

30
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,640
I hired a trainer recently.

31
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,570
Did you really?

32
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:51,730
Yeah.

33
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,730
This young dude that I do Jujitsu with,

34
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:55,860
it's always an awesome
shape and kicks my ass

35
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,220
ass.

36
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,830
These fucking workouts are so brutal.

37
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,870
Cross training style stuff.

38
00:01:01,871 --> 00:01:02,110
Well,

39
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,330
I feel like if you don't
have someone yelling at you,

40
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:04,840
you know,

41
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,980
getting you to do shit,

42
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,840
it's like no matter how
hard you push yourself,

43
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:10,780
you don't quite push yourself
as if not even close man.

44
00:01:10,781 --> 00:01:11,820
Someone else does it.

45
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,130
Yeah,

46
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:13,750
that's exactly what I don't push myself.

47
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,010
Yeah,

48
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,080
that's exactly right.

49
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,210
I just started doing that recently.

50
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,500
It's pretty bad ass.

51
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,130
I do it for,

52
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,160
I hire somebody once every once in a
while for like a month and I'm like,

53
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,023
that's just too hard.

54
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,220
I got Justin,

55
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,660
he trains in my gym and he would,

56
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,240
we would,

57
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,811
I would watch him,

58
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,461
his train and I'm like,

59
00:01:30,461 --> 00:01:32,260
this guy never gets fucking tired.

60
00:01:32,261 --> 00:01:32,780
So I said like,

61
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,210
what are you doing for conditioning?

62
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,460
He told me he's a trainer and so I said,

63
00:01:36,461 --> 00:01:37,210
let me one more time.

64
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,400
Which one day he had me doing all kinds.

65
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:40,450
How long the workouts are you doing?

66
00:01:40,451 --> 00:01:41,020
Shit,

67
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,100
it's only an hour.

68
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:42,930
That's all I can tell you.

69
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,020
But intense hour is tarted,

70
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,700
dude.

71
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,700
It's all like Madison balls and jumping
over this and jumping squats and all

72
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:56,821
this nutty tracking on the field shit and
jumping over boxes and pushups left to

73
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:57,731
right,

74
00:01:57,731 --> 00:01:58,241
left to right,

75
00:01:58,241 --> 00:01:58,451
left,

76
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:58,601
right,

77
00:01:58,601 --> 00:02:01,570
like all this crazy like
conditioning type shit.

78
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,920
Holy Fuck.

79
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:07,330
Is it hard to do whenever every time I've
done a workout with a trainer and it's

80
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:08,230
been like an hour,

81
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,710
I'm always amazed at how little
I usually accomplish in an hour.

82
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,131
You know what I mean?

83
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:14,170
Cause like you finished with
the trainer and you're like,

84
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:14,801
man,

85
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,190
we did all,

86
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,240
we did that in an hour.

87
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,260
I usually spend an hour and I do
a fraction of one of those things.

88
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,140
It's hard to

89
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,140
really fucking bucks down,

90
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,620
feel it a little bit.

91
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,790
I could do it every now and again,

92
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,820
but I think on a regular basis sometimes
you need to take a class or you got to

93
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,150
have somebody yell at you.

94
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,530
It's like working with a deadline.

95
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,740
Like you were working on a deadline
and you analyze what you accomplish and

96
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,490
then,

97
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,590
and then when you're on your own again,

98
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,090
you're like,

99
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,730
yeah,

100
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,311
you feel like it.

101
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,061
Lazy Bitch.

102
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:42,930
What's wrong with me?

103
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,150
I am always,

104
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,910
I've worked with a deadline a few
times from the road and I'm like,

105
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Holy Shit,

106
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:51,570
how much work I just
accomplished this weekend?

107
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,190
And then it's usually the,

108
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,361
the opposite thought.

109
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:54,511
Like,

110
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,530
Holy Shit,

111
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,750
I went the entire weekend
without doing one product.

112
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:03,000
I got up and I went down to do the
show and I dropped off four times.

113
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,210
That's the day.

114
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:06,250
It's amazing how much time you can waste.

115
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,413
It's an amazing,

116
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,080
but it's a crazy feeling when you set
the bar really high and you accomplish

117
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:13,930
something and like you
short period of time,

118
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,540
you accomplish a lot of
things because then you know,

119
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,950
you've got to keep that pace up.

120
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:18,550
Oh,

121
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,383
that's brutal.

122
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:19,960
Yeah,

123
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,793
it's hard.

124
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,963
It's very hard.

125
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,380
That creative pace,

126
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,950
this has nothing to do
with on a.com or cattle.

127
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,010
That was a fun time.

128
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,671
But whatever,

129
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,504
folks,

130
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,850
go buy some vitamins for your brain.

131
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,340
Some mushroom tech sport.

132
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,960
We have hemp protein powder.

133
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,620
We have kettle bells,

134
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,271
as I said,

135
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:38,020
battle ropes,

136
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,070
all kinds of cool shit.

137
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:39,904
All of it.

138
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,790
Health and fitness related and uh,

139
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:45,700
and mental focus and clarity related.

140
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,600
You're still the sleep one?

141
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,260
Yeah.

142
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,981
Well it's not asleep.

143
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,191
One,

144
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:48,791
one that's a,

145
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,140
it's a mood booster.

146
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:52,590
It's a five HTP and l fan.

147
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,000
A supplement does have melatonin.

148
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,840
No,

149
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,620
I don't think so.

150
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,453
It does it,

151
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,413
I should know that.

152
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,630
Let's Google it.

153
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,463
Um,

154
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,400
because it's what don't do it.

155
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,190
Don't you think what it does?

156
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,024
Um,

157
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,170
did you get bill blade?

158
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,020
What it does is it's five HTP,

159
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:11,920
um,

160
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,940
produces a,

161
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
it makes your brain produce serotonin
and l tryptofan converts to five HTP.

162
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,190
So it like literally it's like a,

163
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:26,191
it acts as sort of a time released
formula for helping your body produce

164
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,780
essentially what makes you happy.

165
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:30,523
But people have heard,

166
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,580
cause I haven't tried it,

167
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:34,360
but I've heard other people talk
about since they started it,

168
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,120
they sleep better.

169
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:35,490
They said,

170
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,151
they told me that,

171
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:36,540
well,

172
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,610
there's a lot of things that
can make you sleep better.

173
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,030
Um,

174
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,530
zinc and zinc is a good one.

175
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:40,891
That zinc,

176
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:41,910
magnesium stuff.

177
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,160
That stuff was good.

178
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:44,920
That's the,

179
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,571
it really,

180
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:46,404
um,

181
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,333
helps you,

182
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,000
uh,

183
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,721
really,

184
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:49,140
uh,

185
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,940
get a good deep sleep.

186
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,570
But a lot of people have
good success with Melatonin.

187
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,040
Melatonin has a,

188
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,531
yeah,

189
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,880
I've tried Valerian root,

190
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,170
but that would get that Gamey
psychadelic dream crazy dreams.

191
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,540
Have you ever tried it?

192
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,480
And I'm going to now have to try it.

193
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,380
That seems amazing.

194
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,930
I've had bananas fucking dreams on that.

195
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,400
Oh Wow.

196
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,680
It's like nature sleeping.

197
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,910
The craziest Shit I've ever
done is the Alpha brain dreams.

198
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,023
Oh really?

199
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,351
Yeah.

200
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:20,490
Alpha brain especially.

201
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:21,301
It seems like the,

202
00:05:21,301 --> 00:05:21,391
uh,

203
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:24,090
the old formula may be fucked
with your head even more.

204
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,051
The real formula,

205
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:26,460
either that or I'm used to it,

206
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,163
I'm not sure.

207
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,240
Um,

208
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,240
but what it used to do to me was
giving me these crazy lucid dreams.

209
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,650
There were really strange because there
were so much more like potent than my

210
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:41,490
normal dreams.

211
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:42,150
Like I,

212
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,020
they were like,

213
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,220
this is how I describe it.

214
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:48,290
It's like my normal dreams or
like a bubble that a kid would

215
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,440
below and they're blowing
those soap bubbles.

216
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,000
It's like so fragile.

217
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:52,834
It's so fragile.

218
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,300
These dreams were like basketballs.

219
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,740
Like they were hard,

220
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:57,050
right?

221
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,280
Like they were real.

222
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:58,730
It was,

223
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,140
it was really strange because it was
like I was aware that I was dreaming,

224
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,960
but I was still able to
maintain the dream state.

225
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,670
I've never been able to do that before.

226
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,480
Maybe.

227
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,880
Maybe we've been able to do
that for like reef seconds.

228
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,260
I've never tried.

229
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,330
Apparently there's this thing called,

230
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:15,164
um,

231
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:20,430
a lucid dreaming where you can actually
practice certain techniques that can aid

232
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:24,320
you and into literally
manipulating your dreams.

233
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,363
That's awesome.

234
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:25,581
Yeah.

235
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:26,031
I don't know.

236
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:26,864
I've never tried it.

237
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm too scared that I would like that too
much and I'm fucking forget real life.

238
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,130
I'm fucking bad ass and my dreams a dream.

239
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:34,461
Oh,

240
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:35,271
it'd be worried.

241
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,880
I would be worried that I wasn't
dedicated enough time to real life.

242
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,350
It's,

243
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,460
that's like virtual living,

244
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:40,731
right?

245
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:41,000
Like,

246
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,720
I mean,

247
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,220
there are times when you
wake up from a dream,

248
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:43,431
you're like,

249
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:44,480
the dream was so awesome.

250
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:44,830
What?

251
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,740
She kind of go back to sleep and I don't
know if anybody's that much of a master

252
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,090
that they can really control it that,

253
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,080
but there's somebody like that.

254
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,140
If I focus on what I
want to dream about next.

255
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,790
I just did it yesterday.

256
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,391
I don't know why,

257
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:58,280
but I wanted to dream
about Phyllis Diller.

258
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,600
I was like obsessed with her yesterday
on my dream about Phyllis Diller and I

259
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:04,880
went to sleep and I did Phyllis Diller.

260
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,301
Wow.

261
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:06,710
Why were you obsessed with Phyllis Diller?

262
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,570
I think because,

263
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,270
uh,

264
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,860
Tommy's cousin came over and,

265
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,400
and Phyllis Diller sent me
like a note that I had framed.

266
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,280
Like she encouraged me
before she died in my career.

267
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,720
So I just have this bond with her.

268
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,231
I love her.

269
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:19,910
I'm fascinating with
her life and everything.

270
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,773
Wow.

271
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,590
And I just wanted to,

272
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,290
I don't know,

273
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,430
want to talk to her or something,

274
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,310
I feel as how did you feel better?

275
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,990
I dreamt about her house.

276
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,321
Yes.

277
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:30,680
I dreamt that I slept in her bed and
then it's split in two and I fell on the

278
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:31,190
floor.

279
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,710
We've got to give you some Alpha
brain fucks with your head.

280
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,183
Yeah.

281
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,960
Too late or do you take
the Alpha brand new?

282
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:43,170
You'll come back with like I just did a
Europe tour with Phyllis Diller and like

283
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,510
stories about the road.

284
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,080
Anyway,

285
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,470
we've got to get to
these stupid commercials,

286
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,330

Joy,

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,653
scared.

290
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,990
I'm having a heart attack.

291
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:52,491
Anyway,

292
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,324

Kerrison Games makes us bad.

302
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:13,811
Asking called Blade slinger for the IPAD
and the iPhone and it's a a really good

303
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:19,751
game that was made from the ground up
for a pad instead of like a computer game

304
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,620
that they poured over.

305
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,310
This is a,

306
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,140
an actual high end game,

307
00:08:24,141 --> 00:08:29,141

was created just for the IPAD and the,

308
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,510
the graphics are insane.

309
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,040
It's really cool.

310
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,810
Really cool looking like a real,

what they can do now
is so amazing with me.

313
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,550
Even just an IPAD,

314
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:44,540
the computer processing power and the
visual processing power allows him to do

315
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,100
some really cool shit.

316
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:47,990

325
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,230
If you go to a rogan.ting.com

326
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,280

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,390
Don't confuse people.

328
00:09:07,391 --> 00:09:08,320
You fuck you work here.

329
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,573
Um,

330
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,133
that's not it.

331
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:11,890
I'll find it.

332
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,630
I'll find that URL while I do this.

333
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,030
But what's important is what ting is.

334
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,880
And Ting is a cell phone
company that uses sprints,

335
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:21,220
backbone and um,

336
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:21,760
they,

337
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,150
but they,

338
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,560
what they do is they make it really
fair and they don't have any contracts.

339
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:27,910
You can quit whenever you want.

340
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,920
It's the same service
that you get with sprint,

341
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,620
but it's like they,

342
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,550
they don't have you as locked in to this.

343
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:38,440
Just sort of a shitty situation that
you can get in with a regular cell phone

344
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,250
company,

345
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,240
regular cell phone company.

346
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:41,290
When you buy a phone,

347
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,690
like say if you buy a phone
and it costs like 500 bucks,

348
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,150
what it really costs us
probably more than that.

349
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:48,130
It probably really costs like 700 bucks.

350
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:48,560
But they,

351
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,900
they take it and they apply it to your
contract so that if you are going to

352
00:09:52,901 --> 00:09:56,800
stick with them for three years and
give them x amount of dollars a month,

353
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
then it's worth it for them
to sorta take that money,

354
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,860
take a little piece of that
and pay off that phone.

355
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,281
Well,

356
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:04,810
when you want to leave early,

357
00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:09,190
that's why you have to pay these
cancellations places like several hundred

358
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:09,220
dollars,

359
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,053
you know,

360
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,620
that doesn't happen with Ting.

361
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,380
You can get the exact same
services you get with sprint.

362
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,380
So it's like really good
cell phone service is shit.

363
00:10:17,381 --> 00:10:20,290
Joey Diaz swears by and it's um,

364
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,330
you,

365
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,163
I'll also get,

366
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,300
it's the best cock sucker when I got to
tell you what the fuck do I got to tell

367
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:28,134
you?

368
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:33,780
I'm telling you is not to be fucked
with sprint is not to be fucked with Joe

369
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,470
Rogan ducks St Com.

370
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,270
That's what it is.

371
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:38,671
Um,

372
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,391
if you go there,

373
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:40,200
you will save

374
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,760
it's rogan.ting.com.

375
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:43,381
You A,

376
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,214
if you go there,

377
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
you will save 50 bucks off of,

378
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,070
uh,

379
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,020
any of their android devices.

380
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,840
I have the Samsung Galaxy s three,

381
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:52,710
and it's the shit.

382
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,700
It's fucking awesome.

383
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,530
It's a beautiful phone.

384
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,160
Like it's,

385
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,160
it used to be that it was
by phones or you know,

386
00:10:59,161 --> 00:10:59,994
crap.

387
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,810
And uh,

388
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,340
that's just not the case anymore.

389
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:02,671
These,

390
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:06,900
these really beautiful big android phones.

391
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,603
They get my dick hard.

392
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,210
Oops,

393
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,043
I said it,

394
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:10,923
I said it.

395
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,870
I don't think this is,

396
00:11:12,871 --> 00:11:14,190
the client's not happy about this.

397
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,200
It's not a part of the,

398
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,680
we were listening to your library
once you get online with it,

399
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,090
one of those men that you'll,

400
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,580
it's so hard to go back to even an iPhone
when you get online and you look at

401
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,071
websites,

402
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:27,311
it's like,

403
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,860
it's almost like having
a tablet fucking huge.

404
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,690
It's like 4.8 inches.

405
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,110
And they have a galaxy and well I
don't know if these guys carry it,

406
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,830
but there's a new one that Samsung
has cause they called the galaxy note.

407
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,570
That is just preposterous.

408
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,113
It is.

409
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,520
It's an iPad mini got,

410
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:46,931
damn it.

411
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,110
It's huge.

412
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:53,090
I get such screen envy when I
see it and I got that from the,

413
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,130
the galaxy s three,

414
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,910
having that thing.

415
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:56,380
It's changed the way I look at,

416
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:56,920
uh,

417
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,150
I used to think there were too big,

418
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,650
I don't think.

419
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,200
Yeah,

420
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,650
that's pretty good.

421
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,280
Cool.

422
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,050
All these phones have
seven o'clock on him.

423
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:02,884
I just realized,

424
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,191
dude,

425
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,030
it's a lucky number.

426
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,060
Superstitious.

427
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,450
The other one of were scared.

428
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,430
You see somebody a at a show,

429
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,720
take pictures when they take
pictures with that Samsung,

430
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:14,151
you were looking at you,

431
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:14,620
you're like,

432
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,221
whoa.

433
00:12:15,221 --> 00:12:17,770
It's like someone brought
up the photo on a computer.

434
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,080
Like it's so much clearer.

435
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,520
Right.

436
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,100
Huge.

437
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,430
Huge God damn screen.

438
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:21,901
Anyway,

439
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:26,800
go to rogan.ting.com and you
will say 50 bucks off of,

440
00:12:26,801 --> 00:12:27,150
uh,

441
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:30,210
any of those android
devices or any dirty fucks.

442
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,900
Thank you all for listening in.

443
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,420
Brian,

444
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,201

445
00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:35,210
Let's get a roll man.

446
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,200
Joe Rogan experience.

447
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,251
Try my day.

448
00:12:38,251 --> 00:12:39,910
Joe Rogan podcast my night.

449
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,660
That was one of our longest
yet most enjoyable commercials.

450
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,643
Fantastic.

451
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:51,720
Cause it wasn't,

452
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,441
I mean it wasn't,

453
00:12:52,441 --> 00:12:52,951
it wasn't,

454
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:53,491
you know what I'm saying?

455
00:12:53,491 --> 00:12:53,850
Man,

456
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,340
I know you sent me brother
to me a little bit of both.

00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,790
Tom Segura and Christina pee.

459
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:02,040
I got to give you guys world champion.

460
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,020
Funniest couple.

461

Yeah,

462
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,540
thanks Mandi.

463
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,030
Uh,

464
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,220
the,

465
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:11,220
the breaking of the mold
of every entertainer with
an entertainer is in a shit

466
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,300
relationship.

467
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,780
Sure.

468
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,880
You guys can totally fix that.

469
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,540
Yeah,

470
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:15,811
thanks.

471
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:16,644
It's always like,

472
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,970
it's always like the dude's funny and
the check is like good looking and he

473
00:13:21,971 --> 00:13:23,250
writes jokes for her.

474
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:23,851
It's like,

475
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:25,650
what a Lowe's or,

476
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,341
or it's,

477
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:26,851
you know,

478
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:27,541
that the,

479
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:27,781
the,

480
00:13:27,781 --> 00:13:30,330
the guy's funny and he takes
the girl with them on the road.

481
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,120
It's very rare that there's equals.

482
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,411
Yeah.

483
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:33,780
Yeah.

484
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,111
You know,

485
00:13:34,111 --> 00:13:38,010
but you guys are both really funny
and you really love each other.

486
00:13:38,011 --> 00:13:40,710
You get along and it's
like a weird and hot

487
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,030
both artists.

488
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,863
Fuck.

489
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,593
But it's very,

490
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,340
it's a,

491
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,700
that's a weird situation
that it actually works.

492
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,600
So lucky.

493
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:48,940
Yeah.

494
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,100
We did ask about it all the time

495
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,470
when you guys would suck.

496
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,540
It's usually one of your sucks.

497
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:55,980
Right?

498
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,491
Am I right?

499
00:13:56,491 --> 00:13:57,030
For sure.

500
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,571
Oh definitely.

501
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,420
Originally like you have
to hang out with this guys.

502
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:00,830
No,

503
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,000
really annoying.

504
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,510
A wife who's also a comedian or really
annoying husband who's also a comedian.

505
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,380
Oh yeah.

506
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,940
And she's actually has
less tolerance for it then.

507
00:14:09,941 --> 00:14:11,930
Not like when we go
out with other couples,

508
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,093
she's always like,

509
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,330
don't leave me at the table.

510
00:14:14,331 --> 00:14:15,164
Some boring fucking yeah,

511
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,270
I hate while you go have fun.

512
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,133
Okay guys.

513
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,010
Comics like it's usually
dudes and then they have like,

514
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,581
you know,

515
00:14:24,581 --> 00:14:25,091
wives,

516
00:14:25,091 --> 00:14:26,160
it maybe not ours.

517
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,981
Inspiring.

518
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:29,890
And I always want to hail to dudes and
talk shit about how many and then I

519
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:31,050
always get stuck swab and fucking

520
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
apple brown Betty.

521
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,060
I'm like,

522
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,740
I talk about Slos man.

523
00:14:35,741 --> 00:14:35,871
Like,

524
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:35,980
like

525
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,080
let's talk about some shit.

526
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,620
They have to find you by your vagina.

527
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,500
You got lumped it to the wrong group.

528
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,221
Oh Shit.

529
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:43,551
Thank you.

530
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:48,320
Speaking of which did you hear about
this fucking 50 year old guy who um,

531
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:53,380
he had a sex change [inaudible] and
now he's playing college basketball.

532
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,843
What?

533
00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,320
That college has to wore men's basketball.

534
00:15:00,321 --> 00:15:02,270
He's enormous.

535
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,311
Weight it out.

536
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:03,950
Did he?

537
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,680
This is,

538
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,970
I don't know about this is hold on.

539
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,750
This is really,

540
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,520
you just made me really think about this.

541
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Did he have college eligibility or did
he already go to college as a man and

542
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,650
then since he's switched sex,

543
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,583
she has new

544
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,600
cause that would be so
awesome if he did that way.

545
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,441
Dude,

546
00:15:22,441 --> 00:15:23,274
this thing,

547
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,420
this guy,

548
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,060
okay,

549
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,100
I'm probably very sweet,

550
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,821
sweet person.

551
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:27,654
I shouldn't say thing,

552
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,010
but this dude slash woman woman,

553
00:15:32,011 --> 00:15:32,821
now I'll say,

554
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:33,654
what did I say woman?

555
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,430
A woman that used to be a man,

556
00:15:35,431 --> 00:15:36,270
let's call her a woman.

557
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,850
She is six foot six.

558
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,713
Whoa.

559
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,040
She's not like a giant man and
she's decided that she's girl now.

560
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,500
So she has the sex change operation,

561
00:15:49,501 --> 00:15:54,501
but she's still a six
foot six man bodied woman.

562
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,573
Big Badge.

563
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,700
That is like if you're looking at all
these little girls that are playing with

564
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:00,340
her,

565
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:00,961
he man,

566
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:05,730
if your daughter was playing basketball
with a dude that was pretending to be a

567
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,280
woman or because decided
to become a woman,

568
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,473
you can't.

569
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,210
That's all fine and
good for the real world.

570
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,070
If you want to define yourself as a woman.

571
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,110
But we will enter into athletics.

572
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,940
There's a reason why there is fucking
different categories for men and women

573
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,270
get an unfair advantage.

574
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,133
Oh my God,

575
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,603
man,

576
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,893
that's crazy.

577
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,850
The other thing is

578
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:32,600
two is because the one thing that's hard,

579
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,610
I think when you're,

580
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,090
you're not involved in this,

581
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:36,020
but you see somebody,

582
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:39,500
let's say who gets a sex change
and I'm saying outside of Sports,

583
00:16:39,501 --> 00:16:39,741
right?

584
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,020
Just in life you go there like,

585
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,261
Hey,

586
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:43,880
you know I've decided to do this.

587
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:44,571
I'm a woman now,

588
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:44,871
and you go,

589
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:45,430
okay,

590
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:45,621
all right,

591
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:46,401
you want to be like,

592
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:46,701
fine,

593
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:47,534
you're a woman now.

594
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,810
But there's that part in
my mind that always goes,

595
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,200
yeah,

596
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,450
but when I look at your hands,

597
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,980
even if you've had surgery and everything,

598
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,990
those are still man men's hands.

599
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:57,900
You know what I'm saying?

600
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,320
Those are men's arms
that you have and legs.

601
00:17:00,321 --> 00:17:04,010
Even if you have like implants in
and you change your whole face,

602
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:07,070
like that's still a
guys bicep and your arm,

603
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,110
even though you had a sex change,

604
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:09,921
so you're still,

605
00:17:09,921 --> 00:17:11,300
so if you think that's a sports,

606
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,380
yeah,

607
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,550
that's where it all counts.

608
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,930
That's where your original

609
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,960
allergies the other way as well,

610
00:17:16,961 --> 00:17:21,190
because there was a guy who is a Meu tie
fighter and he was really like a high

611
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:26,191
level fighter and he decided to get a
sex change and then once you get a sex

612
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:26,501
change,

613
00:17:26,501 --> 00:17:26,861
he literally,

614
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:27,760
he got his balls cut off,

615
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:30,420
stop producing testosterone and
started getting the fuck beat out.

616
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,363
No Shit.

617
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,530
He was still fighting men.

618
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,011
Oh,

619
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:33,791
he's still fighting men,

620
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:34,810
but they didn't have balls anymore.

621
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,900
So it's not exactly that.

622
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,450
This six foot tall person that was a man.

623
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,920
And I see what you're saying.

624
00:17:41,921 --> 00:17:43,150
I'm a woman is a woman,

625
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,490
but it's not exactly that is a man either.

626
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,770
He's sort of in this weird limbo state.

627
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:48,250
Yeah.

628
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,400
But he still this unfair
mechanical advantage.

629
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:52,630
That's a giant person.

630
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,370
He's got huge shoulders,

631
00:17:54,371 --> 00:17:55,240
huge hands.

632
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,920
If you're playing against a little girl,

633
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:57,760
that's just stupid.

634
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,040
Yeah.

635
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:58,251
Well,

636
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,460
and it is like those athletes then they
weren't they saying that the people that

637
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:03,410
had prosthetic limbs,

638
00:18:03,411 --> 00:18:05,300
like the runners with those special,

639
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,441
you know what I mean,

640
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:07,274
those legs,

641
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,580
but they're like,

642
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:08,700
oh,

643
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,890
it's an unfair advantage.

644
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,180
So lucky to be criminal.

645
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,110
One guy made it in.

646
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:12,520
Well,

647
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:12,770
no,

648
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,161
I don't want,

649
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:14,580
I don't want to say that.

650
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,320
You know,

651
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,200
that anybody would be
lucky to be critical.

652
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,790
But they were saying that,

653
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,030
but I don't think they
were really saying that.

654
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,140
What they're really saying.

655
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:22,590
It's like,

656
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,610
realistically,

657
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,050
let's look at what's going on here.

658
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,380
There's a mechanical advantage to those
things that surpasses the human body.

659
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,070
Like these are springs.

660
00:18:32,071 --> 00:18:34,290
You're running on these
crazy sprinting springs.

661
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:34,800
Right.

662
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,281
You know?

663
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:35,611
I mean,

664
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,230
those things work like a motherfucker.

665
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,910
So if they're really the,

666
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,070
it seems like they work better than legs.

667
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,230
Yeah.

668
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,720
That is one thing that
can happen for sure.

669
00:18:44,721 --> 00:18:46,910
What goes on is you
cannot tear your Achilles.

670
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:47,450
Yeah.

671
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,500
It's like it literally,

672
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,393
you don't have one.

673
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,151
You can't,

674
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:50,600
you can't.

675
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,270
You can't tear your ACL
if it's up to your quad.

676
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:53,740
Yeah.

677
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,140
Yeah.

678
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,590
Well,

679
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,060
the whole thing is really,

680
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:56,511
I mean,

681
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,380
you would never want to say that
there's anyone that has any sort of an

682
00:18:59,381 --> 00:19:00,800
advantage to being handy.

683
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,541
You know what I'm saying?

684
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:02,840
I mean,

685
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,950
it's a sensitive issue.

686
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,131
I mean,

687
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:05,780
we're all very lucky that we're not.

688
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,400
Thank God.

689
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:06,911
Of course.

690
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:07,700
Of course.

691
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,180
When you do see like that
you can run faster with that.

692
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:14,960
Like at what point in time do you let
that go off the world record becomes a guy

693
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:15,170
with

694
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,070
robot legs.

695
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,880
Right.

696
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,391
You know what I mean?

697
00:19:17,391 --> 00:19:18,890
Like how do you define the athletics?

698
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:21,560
Like that guy was in the Olympics
this summer with prosthetics.

699
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,403
Remember that?

700
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,091
The spinner,

701
00:19:23,091 --> 00:19:24,050
was he South African?

702
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,650
I don't know.

703
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:25,760
I forget where he was from.

704
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,541
I think he was,

705
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:27,410
but he,

706
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:27,830
um,

707
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,960
it was cool to see him in the event.

708
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:30,740
He didn't,

709
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,730
he didn't win or metal,

710
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,980
which made it less of an issue.

711
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:34,550
You know,

712
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:35,331
people didn't press it,

713
00:19:35,331 --> 00:19:36,860
but they were pressing
it before he got in.

714
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,880
Everybody was,

715
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,920
people were saying that South African run.

716
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,290
Remember Africa was she,

717
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,810
she was both genders or
something and everyone was upset?

718
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,250
No.

719
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:45,831
Well that was,

720
00:19:45,831 --> 00:19:48,680
people were accusing her of being,

721
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,280
um,

722
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,680
a hermaphrodite and they put her throat.

723
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,630
She at the end of the day,

724
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,021
no,

725
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:54,500
it's the shoes.

726
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,220
She's a woman.

727
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,160
But she was put through
like really brutal,

728
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,180
um,

729
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,571
exam.

730
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:00,530
I read the scrutiny.

731
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:00,851
Yeah.

732
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:01,090
Yeah.

733
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:01,370
And,

734
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:03,440
and they were people were
people definitely as a woman,

735
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:04,040
100%.

736
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:04,590
I'm,

737
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:05,750
I'm almost certain,

738
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,470
um,

739
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,861
I forget,

740
00:20:06,861 --> 00:20:08,570
I just forgot her name
blanked on her name too,

741
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,210
but she is South African and uh,

742
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,470
yeah and the country,

743
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:15,020
they adore her because she was so,

744
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,291
yeah,

745
00:20:15,291 --> 00:20:15,680
cause they were,

746
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,640
people really were,

747
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:19,280
were horrible to her like during the,

748
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:20,270
you know the scribe.

749
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:20,511
Right,

750
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:20,840
right,

751
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,380
right.

752
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:21,531
Yeah.

753
00:20:21,531 --> 00:20:22,364
But she's,

754
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,230
I'm fairly certain she's legitimately,

755
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,270
I mean if you go through the trouble of
of cotton your Peter off and doing all

756
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:29,510
that,

757
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,190
like just let the guy let the girl,

758
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,203
but that's not her.

759
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:32,451
Sure.

760
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,550
No problem is it's not
let her play basketball,

761
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,350
play basketball with a little girl.

762
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,200
What school does all these like
little girls that are playing there?

763
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:40,520
Like they just went to college.

764
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,360
The 18.

765
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,980
This is a 50 year old man.

766
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,570
That was crazy.

767
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,120
That one is crazy.

768
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,730
What school is he?

769
00:20:47,731 --> 00:20:47,990
Is

770
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,380
this Lucy here?

771
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,650
Yes.

772
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:53,820
You're white.

773
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,481
You're right.

774
00:20:54,481 --> 00:20:55,620
Absolutely.

775
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,450
Yeah.

776
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:56,790
You know,

777
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,620
God bless him his whole life.

778
00:20:58,621 --> 00:21:00,640
He just wanted to be on the ladies' team.

779
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,711
What's happening?

780
00:21:01,711 --> 00:21:02,160
Yes.

781
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,030
Sort of,

782
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:04,500
but it's not fair.

783
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,300
I mean it's just not,

784
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,340
the problem is once you start
having competitive athletics,

785
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,050
it's like ended.

786
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,560
But then the other thing in life,

787
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,850
it's do whatever you want to do.

788
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,260
If you want to go to work with a dress,

789
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,161
if you're nice,

790
00:21:17,161 --> 00:21:17,994
I'll talk to you.

791
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,700
I don't know.

792
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,750
It was more of you to dress
like a man if you were,

793
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:21,250
you know,

794
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,350
whatever your fucking thing is.

795
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,363
If you're nice,

796
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:23,971
I don't care,

797
00:21:23,971 --> 00:21:24,870
I'll talk to you I,

798
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,940
but when you have to recognize the
mechanical advantages to the male frame,

799
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,710
of course the tendon strength.

800
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:36,120
Even when there's a depletion
of testosterone and your
body showed us shrivels

801
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,770
up a little bit and then
you lose muscle mass.

802
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,440
It's still a God damn man.

803
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:43,350
And the overwhelming evidence
is if you look at men's verse,

804
00:21:43,351 --> 00:21:47,280
if you line up men's and women's
results for athletic competition,

805
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:48,030
there's a,

806
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,490
there's a depth.

807
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,850
There's a reason why every single one,

808
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,320
basically the men are more
advanced and they're there,

809
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,343
they run faster,

810
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,233
jump higher,

811
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,260
but then you guys are going
to get like the anomalies,

812
00:21:58,261 --> 00:22:01,920
like every now and then there is a woman
that can do as many pushups as the male

813
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,000
marines or whatever.

814
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,660
They have the same athletic standards.

815
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,361
But if you,

816
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:10,760
you might get a group of weak guys,

817
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:11,900
one really strong girl.

818
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,500
But if you have all the guys,

819
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,920
you have just the strongest
guys in the strongest girls.

820
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:18,220
Let's strong as Christ this.

821
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:21,230
There are fucking freaks out there.

822
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:21,770
Oh yeah.

823
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,980
I've seen some of these
guys in the UFC that fine.

824
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,621
Three,

825
00:22:24,621 --> 00:22:24,980
four,

826
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,200
five rounds and don't
even get fucking tired.

827
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:27,860
Wow.

828
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,540
What kind of incredible shape.

829
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:31,400
Some of those fucking guys are amazing,

830
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,300
amazing.

831
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,070
Some high level shit.

832
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,860
And at that level that those men,

833
00:22:36,861 --> 00:22:37,241
those like,

834
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,260
like the really high level men,

835
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,220
like there's nothing like that that when
women can't really keep up with that.

836
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:43,491
Oh,

837
00:22:43,491 --> 00:22:43,940
you know,

838
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,761
and that's one of the,

839
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:44,971
the,

840
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:49,971
the big accusation against this one
woman who is like one of the top women in

841
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,134
the world.

842
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,600
She was stripped of her tire named Cyborg.

843
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,460
And she's built like,

844
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,810
she's built like a strong dude like Brian,

845
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,100
can you pull up a picture,

846
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:01,731
pull up,

847
00:23:01,731 --> 00:23:04,970
pull up a picture of Cyborg muscular dude.

848
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:05,421
You wait,

849
00:23:05,421 --> 00:23:07,240
wait to see how scary this.

850
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,560
And she fought this other chick,

851
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,150
Gina Carano and Gina Carano,

852
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,160
beautiful son of us.

853
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:14,870
I guess it has like a
famous football player,

854
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,011
you know,

855
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:16,611
beautiful,

856
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:17,391
smart,

857
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:18,224
tough chick.

858
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,380
And this Brazilian bitch
just ragdoll really horrific.

859
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:24,770
It was a vicious,

860
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:25,910
vicious beating.

861
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,970
But everybody accuses
her of doing steroids.

862
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,440
Okay.

863
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,820
So then she got caught.

864
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,470
She didn't get caught and she got caught.

865
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:36,200
She tested hot and when she tested hot,

866
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:37,034
everybody was like,

867
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:39,710
like,

868
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,580
I don't know,

869
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,680
that's one picture of her.

870
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,371
There's a,

871
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:44,560
there's some other pictures of her,

872
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:44,931
Brian,

873
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:46,490
like she's a celebrating

874
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,990
in the cage cause that's,

875
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:49,850
that's her at a way in.

876
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:53,060
And there's a difference
between you and a wagon and you,

877
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,660
um,

878
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,070
when you're actually fighting.

879
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,330
Cause when you're actually fighting,

880
00:23:56,331 --> 00:23:58,280
that's when your muscles
pump up with blood.

881
00:23:58,281 --> 00:24:00,020
Like we have one on the far right.

882
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,570
You see your Brian far IA right there.

883
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:03,170
Yeah.

884
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,003
Right there.

885
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,950
She looks like Kate from the
last mix with the sweetest.

886
00:24:07,951 --> 00:24:09,150
Are you kidding me,

887
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:09,750
grandma?

888
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,583
Yeah.

889
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,513
Uh,

890
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,653
anyway,

891
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:13,953
in any way,

892
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,330
like Lauren Landry,

893
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,070
she's a very,

894
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:18,570
very muscular woman.

895
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,260
Jesus,

896
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,510
she's a tank and she's scary,

897
00:24:21,511 --> 00:24:22,081
talented,

898
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:22,470
like the,

899
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,251
as a striker.

900
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:23,950
She's really,

901
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,900
she's for a woman.

902
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:26,760
She is fucking vicious.

903
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,061
It's so okay.

904
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:31,250
And as feminist as I totally am,

905
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:31,820
I,

906
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,980
there's some part of me that
I look at her and you're like,

907
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:34,580
why,

908
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,090
why sweet?

909
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:35,271
Well,

910
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:36,620
because she wants to go to war.

911
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:39,890
And I liked that and I respect that
because I too am an angry fucking,

912
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,570
but at the same time you're like,

913
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,751
oh,

914
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,650
I just want to protect her.

915
00:24:42,651 --> 00:24:44,000
I don't want her to get her face head.

916
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:44,321
Oh,

917
00:24:44,321 --> 00:24:44,710
she,

918
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:45,040
um,

919
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:45,430
she,

920
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,370
she came up with the
craziest camp in Brazil.

921
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:49,263
There she is.

922
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,500
She came up with the shoot,

923
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,650
the shoot the box shoe box and a shoot.

924
00:24:53,651 --> 00:24:57,880
The box camp is all these like
bad ass Brazilian Moy Thai guys.

925
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,260
They're fucking animals.

926
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:00,100
And uh,

927
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,650
she was married to the
other dude's Cyborg,

928
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,030
eventually sta.

929
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,080
And he's a,

930
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,400
he's a fucking lease too.

931
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:08,620
He's an old school and then a legend.

932
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,410
So the two of them were just
like the scariest Koppel ever.

933
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,760
And they breeding super babies.

934
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,100
I don't think they're together anymore.

935
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,040
She fortunately,

936
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:16,451
but yeah,

937
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:17,460
she is a,

938
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,240
she's terrifying woman.

939
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,021
Did you,

940
00:25:20,021 --> 00:25:20,471
by the way,

941
00:25:20,471 --> 00:25:21,040
did you get,

942
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,900
I told you I got to see a little bit of
the fights this weekend when I was in a,

943
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:26,471
in the hotel.

944
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:26,770
I was like,

945
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,570
I was in Calgary and uh,

946
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,230
I saw you on and then when a
brown beat Swick it was right.

947
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:35,450
Yeah.

948
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:35,830
Uh,

949
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,251
which was,

950
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:37,084
um,

951
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,451
yeah,

952
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:38,110
he was,

953
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:38,590
uh,

954
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,220
there's some great,

955
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,780
that was a most of the ground game fight.

956
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:41,614
If I remember.

957
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,420
It was,

958
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,180
uh,

959
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,013
I don't think they went to the,

960
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:44,171
well,

961
00:25:44,171 --> 00:25:44,950
they went to the ground.

962
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,990
He got them in a dark and
then he almost got him,

963
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:49,420
I think he almost got him
at a triangle and the cars,

964
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:49,900
I thought,

965
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:50,733
uh,

966
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,590
Brown almost had him like
they would in the first round,

967
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:54,813
the first round,

968
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,320
and then the second one is stomped him.

969
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,630
Is that what happened or did they stop
him at the end of the first round?

970
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,673
Was that the first round?

971
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,173
I think it was,

972
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:01,871
I don't remember.

973
00:26:01,871 --> 00:26:02,141
Whatever.

974
00:26:02,141 --> 00:26:04,660
I don't remember when exactly it happened,

975
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,900
but mine knocked the sensational Knox.

976
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,351
Yeah.

977
00:26:07,351 --> 00:26:07,980
Yeah.

978
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,221
Great.

979
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:08,670
Knock out.

980
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,503
Um,

981
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,940
but afterwards did,

982
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:13,380
did you know or did you
just see or they tell you,

983
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,250
uh,

984
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:17,220
when Brown was waiting for you and
like what Erin on Fox was that he was

985
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:18,230
standing there and he was looking around.

986
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:18,461
He was like,

987
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:19,294
Hey Joe.

988
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:20,910
He was like,

989
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:21,570
what's up man?

990
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,050
Yeah,

991
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:22,741
cut to commercial.

992
00:26:22,741 --> 00:26:23,020
Well,

993
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,270
he even said that to me.

994
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:25,051
Like he looked over at me.

995
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,050
It was totally not my call.

996
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:28,860
I didn't miss it.

997
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,370
When,

998
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:29,761
when,

999
00:26:29,761 --> 00:26:32,320
if you see me in the cage or,

1000
00:26:32,321 --> 00:26:32,640
or,

1001
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,420
or uh,

1002
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:33,931
or not,

1003
00:26:33,931 --> 00:26:34,201
it's like,

1004
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,220
it's not my call.

1005
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,790
They tell me we want an interview or
they tell me there's no time for an

1006
00:26:38,791 --> 00:26:39,420
interview.

1007
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,100
And a lot of times they
say there's no time.

1008
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,350
And when you do a sh a like the Fox card,

1009
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:49,090
like I think they were already worried
about time and it turned out to be a good

1010
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:49,924
worry because of the,

1011
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,790
the fight I believe started
after it was supposed to end.

1012
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,160
So like for people that set their dvrs,

1013
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,510
like they didn't even get to fight.

1014
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,130
A lot of people didn't
get the fight apparently.

1015
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,270
Oh No.

1016
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,570
Yeah.

1017
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,200
Oh No.

1018
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,930
So that's why they were behind the time.

1019
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,050
I don't understand like how
they produce a show like that.

1020
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:08,320
I don't,

1021
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:08,570
I don't,

1022
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:11,260
I don't really like even
go in the truck and peak.

1023
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,730
Like I dunno what the fuck they're doing,

1024
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,390
but I know that when you know
you have like live fight,

1025
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:20,020
it's really difficult to judge
how much actual time you have.

1026
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,250
It could be like three first round knock
outs or it could be three really long

1027
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:27,280
decisions where or it can be three
decisions where a guy gets kicked in the

1028
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:29,800
balls and you have to stop
the time for five minutes.

1029
00:27:29,801 --> 00:27:33,820
Like sometimes shit can drag on past
where you think it's going to be.

1030
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:37,930
So they err on the side of caution and
they cut out interviews when they can.

1031
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,500
Yeah.

1032
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,970
Well you got to have much tighter time
restrictions on a network like Fox than

1033
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,540
like a normal either.

1034
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:44,740
You know,

1035
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,750
obviously a paper view or
even like a cable thing.

1036
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:51,310
Cause that's like hard out and ends for
other shows that you can't go late into.

1037
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,541
Right.

1038
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:51,730
Yeah,

1039
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:52,630
I guess it is.

1040
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,040
She just get walkie talkies between
that probably solve everything.

1041
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,383
Talking to

1042
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,630
the next fights on,

1043
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:01,603
come on out.

1044
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,290
You know who's talking?

1045
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:03,531
No,

1046
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:03,941
no you don't.

1047
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:05,240
I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

1048
00:28:05,241 --> 00:28:06,074
Silly bitch

1049
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,130
talking about like miss [inaudible] idea.

1050
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,290
What we're saying

1051
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,763
problem.

1052
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,910
Why don't you go into your next
production meeting and be like,

1053
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,910
I'm just going to bring him and he's going
to talk for me from you guys talking,

1054
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,730
talking about the guys
getting kicked in the balls.

1055
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,770
They have something to protect her.

1056
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:28,371
Yeah,

1057
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:28,920
they do.

1058
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,640
They do.

1059
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,171
They do.

1060
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,450
But a lot of guys that
were the wrong cups,

1061
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,680
if you just wear like a
regular jockstrap strap,

1062
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:36,860
it's um,

1063
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,820
there's like,

1064
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:42,350
there's those things move around and
they're designed for like sports.

1065
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,550
They're really not designed for dudes
kicking you in the things that you need

1066
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:47,810
when someone's kicking you in the deck,

1067
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:48,520
you need it

1068
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,870
more comprehensive approach

1069
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,650
has been a Titleist natural.

1070
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah.

1071
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,010
You can't be set off for
that softball bullshit

1072
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,460
because those,

1073
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,720
those kicks are hard as fuck inside
leg kicks that Dick or one of the most

1074
00:29:03,721 --> 00:29:05,130
painful things I ever,

1075
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:05,510
oops.

1076
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,170
So they're so horrible.

1077
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,850
I'd been kicked in the balls so many times

1078
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,670
because I've had,

1079
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,940
I've probably had been kicked in the
balls at least a hundred times in my life.

1080
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,183
Really hard.

1081
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,060
It's amazing that they,

1082
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,230
you can get through those.

1083
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:22,531
I mean,

1084
00:29:22,531 --> 00:29:23,490
cause I worry about,

1085
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,030
oh,

1086
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,020
but always with a cup on.

1087
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:25,590
Yeah.

1088
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,040
Okay.

1089
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,300
Well I don't think I've ever been
kicked without a cup that God,

1090
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,191
oh my gosh.

1091
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:30,510
Well there's videos about that.

1092
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,250
Yeah.

1093
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,880
It's the Cup protects
you a little bit caught,

1094
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,100
protects you a little bit.

1095
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,020
It keeps them from rupturing.

1096
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:39,480
I think is what it is.

1097
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,080
Oh yeah.

1098
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,060
Guys have lost testicles because

1099
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,080
they were sparring and they got
kicked and they didn't have a cup on.

1100
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:45,580
Oh,

1101
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,321
what about one of those?

1102
00:29:46,321 --> 00:29:47,350
Like people get like the,

1103
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:48,870
the high heels and the balls.

1104
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,310
How's that?

1105
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,380
She doesn't have burst Burstows.

1106
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:53,640
And you played the one before?

1107
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,300
Um,

1108
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,570
yeah,

1109
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,080
I got that.

1110
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,970
There's a video that shit's frightening.

1111
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,680
There's some that are clearly faked.

1112
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,610
Yeah.

1113
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,170
Like you can be like,

1114
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,261
oh,

1115
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:02,460
they've got a cup on or whatever.

1116
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,260
But then I have one,

1117
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:06,270
I'll send it to you where they,

1118
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,020
it starts,

1119
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,980
she's kicking 'em really hard
and he's got underwear on.

1120
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:11,191
Yeah,

1121
00:30:11,191 --> 00:30:11,401
it's a,

1122
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:12,234
it's in Spanish.

1123
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,261
And then she just like,

1124
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:13,621
suffer,

1125
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:13,981
suffer.

1126
00:30:13,981 --> 00:30:14,820
I want you to suffer.

1127
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,450
And you're like,

1128
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:15,721
all right.

1129
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:16,610
But maybe he has a cup on.

1130
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,460
Then she takes the underwear
off and she fucking,

1131
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,380
she's like punting a football
kicking out like Bam.

1132
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,800
And He is like,

1133
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,640
what heals on his knees are
shaking and he starts to bleed.

1134
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:30,780
He starts bleeding.

1135
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:31,890
Oh my God.

1136
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:33,810
He's just taking it
like London's likes it.

1137
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,530
Right.

1138
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,570
She squeezes so hard.

1139
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,890
Some grill over.

1140
00:30:37,891 --> 00:30:38,900
She's saying Spanish.

1141
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,320
You bleed.

1142
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,153
Yes.

1143
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,633
Macro.

1144
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,800
Unnecessary.

1145
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:43,981
Oh,

1146
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:44,730
I know.

1147
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,480
Tell her to stop.

1148
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,090
Then when I saw as she
was taking the healing,

1149
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,530
she was grinding it like a cigarette,

1150
00:30:49,531 --> 00:30:51,300
but after our rainy day,

1151
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,760
grinding it into this concrete,

1152
00:30:53,761 --> 00:30:55,860
that's what she was doing
his balls with high heels on.

1153
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:56,760
What is it?

1154
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,990
How could someone want that?

1155
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,853
I don't know.

1156
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,890
What is what?

1157
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:01,840
What is the switch that
goes wrong in your,

1158
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,900
I don't think where you
want someone to hurt you.

1159
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,370
He's dirty balls.

1160
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:06,204
I hate them

1161
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:10,890
healthy.

1162
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,760
They can even would want it.

1163
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,470
I don't think they even
think they want it.

1164
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,250
I do it.

1165
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,350
I think they something with
leads them to discover it.

1166
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:18,210
Not that they want it,

1167
00:31:18,211 --> 00:31:19,044
but they're like,

1168
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,351
oh,

1169
00:31:19,351 --> 00:31:22,200
my reaction to that is not
what most people go through,

1170
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,010
which is like,

1171
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,251
God,

1172
00:31:23,251 --> 00:31:24,240
that's the worst thing ever.

1173
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,350
All of a sudden they get that and some
something happens inside where it's like

1174
00:31:28,351 --> 00:31:29,184
they get a rush,

1175
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,540
some type of adrenaline,

1176
00:31:30,541 --> 00:31:31,320
and then they're like,

1177
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,160
oh wow,

1178
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,730
that there's a pleasure to write.

1179
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,030
Right,

1180
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:34,260
right,

1181
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,890
right.

1182
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,041
Yeah,

1183
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:35,500
I think so.

1184
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,120
Scrubber thing,

1185
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,380
isn't it an s and m thing?

1186
00:31:37,381 --> 00:31:39,300
It's being submissive
watching one right now.

1187
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,480
You guys,

1188
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,290
me scared.

1189
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:42,990
There we go.

1190
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,070
Look at John the TV.

1191
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,080
I don't think you're
allowed to show this now.

1192
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,990
You can't show balls,

1193
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:49,291
dude.

1194
00:31:49,291 --> 00:31:50,070
Now it,

1195
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,060
it's blurred out.

1196
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,800
Oh is it really for real?

1197
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:57,060
Like he has it spread out like it looks
like a frog on a Ustream is our friend.

1198
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,193
Just kidding.

1199
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,510
We can't get him in trouble high.

1200
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,610
He'll commercial though.

1201
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,220
Um,

1202
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,840
you ever listened to Dan Savage?

1203
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,640
He has the savage love podcast.

1204
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:09,670
He's a sex columnist and he says that
those fetishes come from your childhood.

1205
00:32:09,711 --> 00:32:10,650
Like let's say if you've got a,

1206
00:32:10,651 --> 00:32:11,990
a fetish for raincoats.

1207
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,430
When you were a little kid,

1208
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,300
you associated some
pleasure with your rain rye.

1209
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,060
Like you'd rub against it and maybe
that gave you a boner and then later in

1210
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:20,840
life,

1211
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,030
that's what she associates
your sexual needs.

1212
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,211
A latex can,

1213
00:32:24,211 --> 00:32:24,411
right?

1214
00:32:24,411 --> 00:32:28,040
So maybe this kid got kicked in the balls
when you use like a little boy by like

1215
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:29,390
a little girl that he liked or something.

1216
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,980
Whoa.

1217
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:33,800
How many dudes have gotten
kicked in the balls by girls.

1218
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,540
They like to the point
where it became a thing.

1219
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,580
I wasn't possible.

1220
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,090
How?

1221
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:42,740
How is it possible that so many dudes
became turned on by that idea of getting

1222
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:45,560
it every fetish guy model guys story.

1223
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,371
When I was four,

1224
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:48,090
I got kicked in the balls by Molly

1225
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:55,100
turned me like a Werewolf
and I came a ball kick.

1226
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:56,300
Fetishist totally.

1227
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:57,890
That's got to hurt you.

1228
00:32:57,891 --> 00:32:58,400
What?

1229
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,660
I don't understand it.

1230
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,160
It's so painful.

1231
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:03,710
I can't imagine that
anybody would want it.

1232
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,161
Well,

1233
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:07,250
I always feel so tentative
handling Tommy's nuts.

1234
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:08,203
That's so nice.

1235
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:11,510
Gentle and sweet and the
thought of hurting them.

1236
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,600
And I asked for a little more.

1237
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,610
I could give him a little tug.

1238
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:14,683
A little something.

1239
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,590
Did you know that?

1240
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,070
Uh,

1241
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,020
the size of a man's testicles,

1242
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:23,110
the sides of the humans testicles is
proportionate to the promiscuity of the

1243
00:33:23,721 --> 00:33:28,220
women in his surrounding
area was all primates.

1244
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:33,350
That the size of the testicles rises
and falls depending on how big a hooker

1245
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,520
your the girls from your neighbor?

1246
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,270
No,

1247
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,490
my dad must've group Breslin real sluts.

1248
00:33:38,491 --> 00:33:39,324
Then

1249
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,970
my dad's [inaudible]
talking about last night,

1250
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,690
I was like,

1251
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,620
I saw him,

1252
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,221
uh,

1253
00:33:47,221 --> 00:33:48,900
I went into his room and he was like,

1254
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,340
I think he was putting on underwear.

1255
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,660
So from behind I go,

1256
00:33:51,661 --> 00:33:53,190
Jesus Christ man.

1257
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,911
And he was like,

1258
00:33:53,911 --> 00:33:55,350
what could you get like donkey nuts?

1259
00:33:55,351 --> 00:33:55,591
He's like,

1260
00:33:55,591 --> 00:34:00,591
all right Tommy [inaudible] so
he must have been a real horse.

1261
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,570
It's probably his g not necessarily him,

1262
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,750
but you know the generations
before him that made him,

1263
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,141
you know,

1264
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:14,460
it's like it becomes a genetic thing
and it all comes from being around more

1265
00:34:14,461 --> 00:34:15,390
promiscuous women.

1266
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,390
That's why chimps have the biggest balls,

1267
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:22,170
seven normous ball cause Dick's
aren't even as big as ours

1268
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:24,250
cause female chimps like way bigger.

1269
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,200
Their balls are so big.

1270
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,650
Yeah,

1271
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:28,940
chimps are down to fuck all day.

1272
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:31,660
What's the other monkey

1273
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,070
and actual cousin that the chimp,

1274
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,481
it's a,

1275
00:34:36,481 --> 00:34:38,110
it's a separate type of champ.

1276
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,143
Oh yeah.

1277
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,330
They don't just masturbate.

1278
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:43,750
They do everything except mother and son.

1279
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:44,890
Mother,

1280
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:45,830
mother and son is the only,

1281
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,060
I think

1282
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,893
they don't do.

1283
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,610
Yeah.

1284
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,040
Yeah.

1285
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,860
And we were talking about that on the
podcast is that someone had speculated

1286
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:51,491
that that might,

1287
00:34:51,491 --> 00:34:56,491
because they had figured out that there
was like bad things happen to the baby

1288
00:34:56,831 --> 00:34:58,030
when the mother has sex.

1289
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,440
Figured it out basically.

1290
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,401
Maybe,

1291
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:03,220
but the problem with that is
that they're fucking all day.

1292
00:35:03,221 --> 00:35:04,180
They're fucking everybody.

1293
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,040
You wouldn't have to like
really be sure to kind of,

1294
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,820
they use sex as a social tool.

1295
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,081
Yes.

1296
00:35:10,081 --> 00:35:11,290
Smooth over differences.

1297
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,150
Homosexual sex.

1298
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,693
Yeah,

1299
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,573
they do.

1300
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,570
They just show the,

1301
00:35:16,571 --> 00:35:17,710
and they just fucking each other.

1302
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:19,870
They go crazy and they are like,

1303
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,060
they're very rarely
violent with each other.

1304
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,140
It's really fascinating.

1305
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,850
But yeah,

1306
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,331
for sure.

1307
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:25,841
Definitely.

1308
00:35:25,841 --> 00:35:27,670
But it's amazing how that evolved.

1309
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:28,780
Like how does that evolve?

1310
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,913
It's incredible.

1311
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,521
It's weird.

1312
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:33,820
How do you get to a point where you gotta
like this Weird Society of like loving

1313
00:35:33,821 --> 00:35:34,151
chimps?

1314
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:35,170
It just fuck all the time.

1315
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,000
Then we look at them like they're sick.

1316
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,530
Right?

1317
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,140
Right.

1318
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,150
They're the oldest
primates that we know of,

1319
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:42,970
but don't kill each other or
don't kill each other a lot.

1320
00:35:42,971 --> 00:35:43,271
I mean,

1321
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:43,781
maybe,

1322
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:44,614
you know,

1323
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,830
there's probably some aberrations even
in the Bonobo world where some shit goes

1324
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:48,100
down,

1325
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:48,490
right?

1326
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,660
Someone's got to regulate.

1327
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,593
Yeah.

1328
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,300
Banabos decks don't work.

1329
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,601
No.

1330
00:35:55,601 --> 00:36:00,460
I heard somewhere that before we had
traditional marriage that it actually made

1331
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:05,230
sense for the woman to bang his many
dudes in the village so that the paternity

1332
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:10,240
of her children was unknown and she'd
actually have more men to protect the

1333
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:10,990
offspring.

1334
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,930
Like that to me would make
sense if I had all of you guys,

1335
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:14,500
right,

1336
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Tommy Red Banjo and that guy
all doing me and then right.

1337
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:20,501
I make a baby.

1338
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:21,334
Whose baby is it?

1339
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,160
Logan's going to defend it and yeah,

1340
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,060
I'll have to take care of my babies.

1341
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,380
They become community babies.

1342
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,650
If you guys want to set that up,

1343
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,533
Mckenna,

1344
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,033
Terence Mckenna,

1345
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,600
the sinks to the bottom,

1346
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:38,010
Terence Mckenna always thought that in
our distant history that it's likely that

1347
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:43,141
we had these polygamous groups of
people that like did psychedelic drugs

1348
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:44,110
together.

1349
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:48,730
Like his idea of like the long
forgotten paradise was like these,

1350
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,653
you know,

1351
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,190
back where he believed like,

1352
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,730
you know,

1353
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,170
civilization was first being created
and he believes that those civilizations

1354
00:36:56,171 --> 00:36:56,681
that came up,

1355
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:57,880
they were all just eating mushrooms,

1356
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,770
tripping their balls off
and fucking each other.

1357
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,370
Right.

1358
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:00,760
Yeah.

1359
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,990
And then Club Med came,

1360
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,650
is that,

1361
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:03,940
that took a long time.

1362
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:04,900
I think your timeline,

1363
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:07,390
it might be a little bit off,

1364
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,400
but that sounds like a fun time,

1365
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,810
but that Mccain was world.

1366
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:16,140
But this idea was that at one time there
was enough people doing ego suppressing

1367
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:19,060
things like he eating mushrooms,

1368
00:37:19,061 --> 00:37:19,894
like they,

1369
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,390
it's all like really speculative.

1370
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,460
There's the idea of trying to figure out
how many different cultures we're doing

1371
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:31,330
psychedelic drugs when they
came up with their religion,

1372
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,080
when they came up with a lot
of their ideas about life and,

1373
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:35,730
and,

1374
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:35,860
uh,

1375
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,131
you know,

1376
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,170
studying the cosmos,

1377
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,000
like a lot of those cultures that
really got heavily into that stuff.

1378
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:42,640
We're also really heavily
into psychedelic drugs.

1379
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,870
Like the Mayans,

1380
00:37:43,871 --> 00:37:45,520
like making their crazy fucking calendars.

1381
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,620
The Mayans did a lot of mushrooms,

1382
00:37:47,621 --> 00:37:48,160
man,

1383
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,820
I didn't know that.

1384
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,710
Oh yeah,

1385
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,750
they mushrooms and raw chocolate together.

1386
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:53,501
There's a,

1387
00:37:53,501 --> 00:37:54,160
there's some,

1388
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,340
some plant that had
like an LSD like effect.

1389
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,320
They also took this,

1390
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,280
I don't remember what it was,

1391
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:00,880
but the idea,

1392
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,870
I went on a tour of Cheech and needs.

1393
00:38:02,871 --> 00:38:06,430
So with this guy who was a
professor and it was a really cool,

1394
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,820
like you can hire him as a guide
and he was so knowledgeable,

1395
00:38:09,821 --> 00:38:10,000
man.

1396
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,380
It was just really interesting.

1397
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:11,560
Yeah.

1398
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:11,831
You know,

1399
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,960
him talking about all the,

1400
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:17,260
the different traditions and why this
was created and that was created.

1401
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,040
But he had the,

1402
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,330
he took me to this room and he's like,

1403
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,380
this is where they did their,

1404
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:21,843
their rituals.

1405
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,280
They,

1406
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,511
they,

1407
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:22,781
you know,

1408
00:38:22,781 --> 00:38:26,020
and taking some sort of a
psychedelic plant that had an Lsd,

1409
00:38:26,021 --> 00:38:26,651
like a fact,

1410
00:38:26,651 --> 00:38:29,830
like this was just like a
culture of super duper trippers.

1411
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,753
Yeah.

1412
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,150
Yeah.

1413
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:31,301
Well,

1414
00:38:31,301 --> 00:38:32,340
when you see the right,

1415
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,610
when you see what they built,

1416
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:34,120
you're like,

1417
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,070
you did not have been sound mind when

1418
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,090
you came up with not logical.

1419
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:38,924
Not at all.

1420
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,870
He got to some weird places,

1421
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,490
weirder than anybody where they,

1422
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,570
they fucking killed people so
often that they had like spots.

1423
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,070
Like we're going to kill him right here.

1424
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:50,590
This is the altar they had alters
where they would sacrifice.

1425
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:52,210
Be Sure I saw one,

1426
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:52,720
I didn't,

1427
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,740
not in Mexico.

1428
00:38:53,741 --> 00:38:54,490
I went to a,

1429
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,001
in Peru,

1430
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,880
I went to Machu Picchu a couple
of times and they had the,

1431
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:00,700
like a sacrificial room they showed you.

1432
00:39:00,701 --> 00:39:02,080
They would like on this table,

1433
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,460
people would voluntarily be sacrificed.

1434
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:04,841
Let's see,

1435
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:07,560
utilities that you have to
be high as fuck for a thing.

1436
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,240
Is that the point to satisfy the gods?

1437
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,350
Take a virgin?

1438
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:12,400
Are you taking so strong?

1439
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,300
There was a period in um,

1440
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:15,840
uh,

1441
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,580
when the Aztecs,

1442
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,391
when they,

1443
00:39:18,391 --> 00:39:18,780
uh,

1444
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,380
when they killed 80,000 people,

1445
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,211
some,

1446
00:39:24,211 --> 00:39:28,670
some insane number of people over like a,

1447
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:32,540
just a period of four
days when there was one,

1448
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,680
one of the temples that
was being built there.

1449
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,570
They apparently,

1450
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,500
this is like,

1451
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,070
it's been,

1452
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:43,070
it's disputed whether or not they
killed 80,000 or whether they killed,

1453
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,340
you know,

1454
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,160
whether it was only really
10,000 people exaggerated.

1455
00:39:47,161 --> 00:39:50,190
Like there's some dispute as to how
many people were actually killed.

1456
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:55,191
But if the number there
they believe is 80,000,

1457
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,230
she,

1458
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,770
and this was said in 1487,

1459
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:00,390
the Aztec King,

1460
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,440
uh,

1461
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:01,990
he,

1462
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,490
and when,

1463
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:04,440
when they completed one of their,

1464
00:40:04,441 --> 00:40:04,830
uh,

1465
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,850
their pyramids,

1466
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:10,050
he killed every prisoner that like was,

1467
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,330
was part of the construction.

1468
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:13,951
Oh yeah.

1469
00:40:13,951 --> 00:40:14,784
So they like,

1470
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:18,100
they fucking built this shit for free,

1471
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,250
built this shit for him.

1472
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:24,750
And then he kills some insane amount
of people over the course of four days.

1473
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,600
But that's a lot of voluntarily dying to,

1474
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,290
you know,

1475
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:28,950
I don't know.

1476
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:29,760
I think so.

1477
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,420
This was not,

1478
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,740
it was so crazy that like Duncan
told me about this first and then,

1479
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,190
um,

1480
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,050
I read it and I couldn't believe it.

1481
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,910
And then I told a bunch
of different people,

1482
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:39,360
I go,

1483
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,620
did you know that this happened?

1484
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,030
And I've had people go,

1485
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,631
fuck it.

1486
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:42,871
Did.

1487
00:40:42,871 --> 00:40:43,051
No,

1488
00:40:43,051 --> 00:40:45,180
it didn't like walk like
totally incredulous.

1489
00:40:45,181 --> 00:40:47,520
Walk away from me and I let us send them,

1490
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:51,090
I've had to send them emails
like that when I won that,

1491
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,190
that hunting show.

1492
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,370
Yeah.

1493
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:52,581
Yeah.

1494
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:53,550
It was Steve Vanilla.

1495
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,811
Great Guy.

1496
00:40:54,811 --> 00:40:55,110
Man,

1497
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,890
really,

1498
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,300
but really intelligent guy.

1499
00:40:57,301 --> 00:40:58,740
Very well read guy.

1500
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,120
And I told him about it.

1501
00:41:00,121 --> 00:41:01,530
He didn't believe it either and he's like,

1502
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:02,101
there's no way.

1503
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:02,371
I'm like,

1504
00:41:02,371 --> 00:41:03,020
I'm telling Ya,

1505
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,181
I'll,

1506
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:04,110
I'll send you the thing.

1507
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,860
When you send someone to the,

1508
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,920
the actual,

1509
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,430
you know,

1510
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,390
the different stories
and depictions of this,

1511
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:14,310
this time and the 14 hundreds and you
see that number 80,000 can you even wrap

1512
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:15,144
your head around?

1513
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,120
You're not doing this with guns folks.

1514
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,660
Okay.

1515
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,660
Wrap your head around 80,000
people getting cut to death.

1516
00:41:23,671 --> 00:41:27,370
Fucking the Rose Bowl in
four fucking slaughtered.

1517
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,020
Oh my gosh.

1518
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:34,070
Is everybody has their

1519
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,020
throats and they're heart
pulled out of their chests.

1520
00:41:37,021 --> 00:41:38,300
Dude is nuts.

1521
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,380
What a Co Raisie motherfucker.

1522
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:41,900
Yeah,

1523
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,260
that is,

1524
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,093
that's insane.

1525
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:43,580
Yeah.

1526
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,300
They yard,

1527
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,070
they took shit to the next level.

1528
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,730
Again,

1529
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:48,270
massive mushroom meters.

1530
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,660
Trippers bid time.

1531
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:51,494
Trippers.

1532
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,730
It's weird when you combine like a,

1533
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,820
a lot of the,

1534
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,880
the interesting things
about those cultures,

1535
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,400
a lot of the interesting discoveries,

1536
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:06,610
there's very strange use of like an UN
hieroglyphic like language and it took us

1537
00:42:06,801 --> 00:42:10,430
a long time to figure out if
they still work on some of the,

1538
00:42:10,431 --> 00:42:10,640
the,

1539
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,391
the different,

1540
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:15,530
more complex character
things in order and debate.

1541
00:42:15,531 --> 00:42:17,060
Like what exactly it means.

1542
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:17,630
Like there,

1543
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,070
there's a great documentary,

1544
00:42:19,071 --> 00:42:22,420
I think it's from Nat Geo
called decoding the Maya,

1545
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,870
I believe that's what it's called and
it's really interesting to see these guys,

1546
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:29,870
these scholars trying to figure
out what the fuck this was.

1547
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,820
It's crazy language.

1548
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,050
Well the other thing that blows your
mind every time if you see something mine

1549
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:40,100
as tech or the Incas is that
when you see what they built,

1550
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,320
you can take today's greatest
architect and be like,

1551
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:46,700
how would you do this here?

1552
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:47,960
And they don't even like,

1553
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,010
I don't even know where to start,

1554
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,040
but how these things were built perfectly
constructed and stones that way,

1555
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,000
like 20 times are laid on top of
another stone and fits into it.

1556
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,021
They have theories.

1557
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:00,201
They're like,

1558
00:43:00,201 --> 00:43:00,411
well,

1559
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,050
we think that they would
pour water down here.

1560
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:03,621
And then you're like,

1561
00:43:03,621 --> 00:43:04,910
how many people would
it take to move this?

1562
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:05,211
And they're like,

1563
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:05,361
oh,

1564
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:06,194
like 8,000.

1565
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,750
And then we probably put it over.

1566
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:08,181
And you're like,

1567
00:43:08,181 --> 00:43:09,014
none of it makes sense.

1568
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,880
Anybody that like there's,

1569
00:43:10,881 --> 00:43:11,200
there's,

1570
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,880
there's a people that will
try to debunk anything.

1571
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,770
Anytime you bring up anything that
seems even remotely paranormal,

1572
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:19,461
you know,

1573
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:20,060
like,

1574
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,410
hey,

1575
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,170
like ghosts or fuck on the aliens here,

1576
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,720
anything you remotely parent,

1577
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,480
they automatically try to go block.

1578
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,020
There's no,

1579
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,340
there's no evidence for that.

1580
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:34,420
There's no that's all well and
good till you get to giant stones.

1581
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,310
And there's something about moving.

1582
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,420
Giant stones are like,

1583
00:43:37,421 --> 00:43:38,111
listen man,

1584
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,060
you got to explain this.

1585
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,200
You got to explain that.

1586
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,220
You can't just say,

1587
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,380
oh well they did that.

1588
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,191
And uh,

1589
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:45,581
you know,

1590
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:45,751
they,

1591
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:45,951
they,

1592
00:43:45,951 --> 00:43:48,550
they figured it out and they cut
it out of this quarry right here.

1593
00:43:48,551 --> 00:43:48,761
Look,

1594
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:49,430
we have one.

1595
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,410
There's one of my favorite pieces of
evidence is would they show this one,

1596
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:53,920
um,

1597
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,580
one of these giant
fucking pig stone pillars.

1598
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,440
They were carving out of this,

1599
00:43:59,441 --> 00:43:59,890
uh,

1600
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:03,640
this one giant piece of granite and they
stopped in the middle of the carving.

1601
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:08,380
But because of the fact that it
was like partially completed,

1602
00:44:08,381 --> 00:44:10,750
you could see the method of shaping it.

1603
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,050
Yeah.

1604
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,310
It was really kind of interesting.

1605
00:44:12,311 --> 00:44:12,870
Like they,

1606
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,990
they learned a lot from that.

1607
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:18,490
So they believe that they did it with
stones and they believe that they did it

1608
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:19,360
slowly.

1609
00:44:19,361 --> 00:44:23,410
Like it was a real painstaking process
of slowly chipping away to get these,

1610
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:25,120
but how the fuck

1611
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:25,983
did they move?

1612
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,200
You gotta tell me how they move.

1613
00:44:28,201 --> 00:44:29,050
There's no cranes,

1614
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,070
no bulldozers.

1615
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:30,670
Yeah.

1616
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,980
We to assume

1617
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:38,250
that they had some incredible knowledge
of leverage and moving things and they

1618
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:43,180
figured out how to get things under it
and leverage it and move it somehow.

1619
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:47,770
But to pretend that that's not a
mystery is really kind of disingenuous.

1620
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:48,980
The day.

1621
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:49,581
I find that,

1622
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:53,750
I mean also to human thinking changes
over time and since the enlightened

1623
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,090
imminent period and like
the scientific revolution,

1624
00:44:56,091 --> 00:44:59,980
we discredited anything that's
remotely Ooky and mysterious

1625
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,900
because there's so much
ooky mysterious stuff.

1626
00:45:01,901 --> 00:45:03,250
That's bull shit.

1627
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:03,940
Yeah.

1628
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:05,410
It's such a problem.

1629
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,900
There's so much bullshit out there.

1630
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,380
Whether it's ghost
bullshit or Ufo bullshit.

1631
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,860
There's so many nutty motherfuckers
with fake bigfoot stories.

1632
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:15,310
Yeah.

1633
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,630
Just muddying up the waters.

1634
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:17,020
Right.

1635
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:17,700
That's true.

1636
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,370
Bull Shit.

1637
00:45:18,370 --> 00:45:19,080
Yeah.

1638
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,260
So a course,

1639
00:45:20,261 --> 00:45:25,261
a smart person is going to gravitate
towards the scientific and more likely

1640
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:26,704
explanation.

1641
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:26,950
Yeah.

1642
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:29,400
Almost everything that's very,

1643
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,150
but it's not explaining everything.

1644
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:32,130
That's the thing is,

1645
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:32,570
is leading.

1646
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:34,580
It's leaving things that are,

1647
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:35,720
that are valid.

1648
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:36,260
You know,

1649
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,640
not the bullshit story.

1650
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,330
It was leaving the real thing also
like unexplored or unexplained and,

1651
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,590
and people just go like,

1652
00:45:42,591 --> 00:45:42,830
man,

1653
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:43,300
whatever.

1654
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,300
Well with science can't figure out his
emotions and our org and why do we like

1655
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:50,890
beautiful things and why?

1656
00:45:50,891 --> 00:45:53,290
Why do I love hearing certain songs?

1657
00:45:53,291 --> 00:45:55,660
Why has it changed the way my body feels?

1658
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:56,380
You know,

1659
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,180
what does it feel like to the,

1660
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,680
to kiss somebody that you love?

1661
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:01,330
Is that really just a bunch of chemicals?

1662
00:46:01,331 --> 00:46:02,440
It's floating around in your brain?

1663
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,620
What is going on there?

1664
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,230
What can science measure that?

1665
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:05,830
You know,

1666
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:06,210
the,

1667
00:46:06,210 --> 00:46:07,120
the emotional,

1668
00:46:07,121 --> 00:46:10,270
human aspect of life is
the one thing that science,

1669
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:11,341
Canton,

1670
00:46:11,341 --> 00:46:13,600
we're really truly defined yet,

1671
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,011
but who knows?

1672
00:46:15,011 --> 00:46:15,221
Man,

1673
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:18,800
we might be able to break it down one day
to ones and Zeros and you just program

1674
00:46:18,801 --> 00:46:19,000
the,

1675
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,900
the right ones and Zeros in your
head and you're happy all the time.

1676
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:23,070
Let's do it just goes keep dreaming.

1677
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,340
Men Stream all day.

1678
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,970
You ever talked to someone like who has
a problem with like normal consciousness

1679
00:46:27,971 --> 00:46:31,510
and they need something like an Ssri or
something like that and then when they

1680
00:46:31,511 --> 00:46:33,790
take it they talk about how like they,

1681
00:46:33,850 --> 00:46:35,950
they finally can like see life.

1682
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:40,460
We're going to be able to
engineer that in people like,

1683
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,140
yeah,

1684
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,670
I mean I guess we're doing it right now,

1685
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:43,990
but people taking pills,

1686
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,970
the meat and the cheese of it.

1687
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:46,530
Well,

1688
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:46,770
the,

1689
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:47,350
well,

1690
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:50,590
the levels of certain things that make,

1691
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,610
you know,

1692
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:51,940
your,

1693
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,180
your consciousness operate certain
things like serotonin and dopamine,

1694
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:58,090
like the levels of these things like
how these things are produced by them,

1695
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:59,560
they're going to be able
to manipulate that shit.

1696
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:00,423
Oh yeah.

1697
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:02,350
And they're going to be building
to manipulate your mood.

1698
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:04,300
Like you're going to be like way happier.

1699
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:05,310
You're also okay

1700
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,410
be able to program or
there'll be able to program,

1701
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,300
um,

1702
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:13,410
the genes that are more desirable
and leave out things that are not.

1703
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,220
Yeah.

1704
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,110
Well that's one of the
things I always felt like,

1705
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,520
if you look at those,

1706
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:18,320
the,

1707
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:18,680
the,

1708
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,460
the standard image of the alien,

1709
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:21,511
you know,

1710
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:22,344
the gray I,

1711
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,340
the gray can big idea alien.

1712
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,820
They're like real flimsy bodies that big,

1713
00:47:26,821 --> 00:47:27,061
big,

1714
00:47:27,061 --> 00:47:27,894
giant heads.

1715
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,333
If you look at,

1716
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,200
and you look at us and
you look at a gorilla,

1717
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,270
they look more like us than the gorilla.

1718
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,761
Okay.

1719
00:47:34,761 --> 00:47:35,160
Yeah,

1720
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:35,993
they do.

1721
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:36,690
Right?

1722
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:36,980
Yeah.

1723
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,150
Like that might be what we're gonna do.

1724
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,560
We're gonna get,

1725
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:43,620
get rid of all the whole sex
organ thing and just going to,

1726
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:44,011
yeah,

1727
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:49,011
we're going to design these
like bulletproof bodies
that can see through walls

1728
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,090
and we're just going to take that on.

1729
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,950
They had and we're going to repeat it.

1730
00:47:52,951 --> 00:47:53,140
Well,

1731
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:56,610
I think there's going to be able to figure
out a way to manipulate your genetics

1732
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,150
and there's never going to
be a dumb kid born again.

1733
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,013
Sure.

1734
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,920
Or develop a new language to dumb people
and your fucking kids going to be five

1735
00:48:04,921 --> 00:48:05,071
going,

1736
00:48:05,071 --> 00:48:05,221
hey,

1737
00:48:05,221 --> 00:48:05,850
stupid.

1738
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:06,030
Okay,

1739
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:06,863
why are you doing

1740
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:10,470
fucking super genetic freak kid,

1741
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:10,570
right?

1742
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:11,540
Five [inaudible] village.

1743
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,770
Three languages will stop speaking
English at this point or any real

1744
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,910
and that'll mean that everything will
just communicate with our consciousness.

1745
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,540
We don't even have to speak anymore.

1746
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,820
I wouldn't how much different the
world would be if we all had the same

1747
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:25,654
language.

1748
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,400
It makes a huge difference.

1749
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,300
I wonder how much do you know
confusion when it comes to like,

1750
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,313
especially like,

1751
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,321
well,

1752
00:48:33,321 --> 00:48:34,630
things like that are going on.

1753
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,800
Excuse me.

1754
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,150
Since they're going on in the Middle East.

1755
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,660
You know,

1756
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:38,860
we,

1757
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,490
I don't,

1758
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,170
I don't speak Israeli.

1759
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:42,940
I don't speak Hebrew.

1760
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,460
I don't,

1761
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:43,720
I dunno,

1762
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,610
I dunno what the Palestinians are saying.

1763
00:48:45,611 --> 00:48:47,110
I don't know what the Saudis are saying.

1764
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,520
I know what the Iranians are saying.

1765
00:48:48,521 --> 00:48:48,950
I can't hear,

1766
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:49,331
hear that.

1767
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:50,164
I don't understand it.

1768
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:51,121
Sorry.

1769
00:48:51,121 --> 00:48:51,340
See,

1770
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:54,790
you're reliant on someone like have you
ever seen like some of the translations

1771
00:48:54,791 --> 00:48:55,690
that were uh,

1772
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,980
that were attributed to aqua,

1773
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:59,290
a jod the a,

1774
00:48:59,291 --> 00:48:59,860
is that his name?

1775
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,070
The A to come in and then a job.

1776
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:04,990
There's like,

1777
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:08,560
people take like things out of context
that he said and make it like much more

1778
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,161
inflammatory.

1779
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:09,311
I mean,

1780
00:49:09,311 --> 00:49:11,020
he says plenty of inflammatory shit,

1781
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,560
but they manipulate things
and we don't know about that.

1782
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,570
We don't know about that
unless you really go and look.

1783
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,000
And if he talked English,

1784
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:19,930
we would know,

1785
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:20,660
oh yeah,

1786
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,493
fucker loans

1787
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,590
radians and fucking
listen to this podcast.

1788
00:49:25,591 --> 00:49:26,281
And I ran like,

1789
00:49:26,281 --> 00:49:27,114
bitch,

1790
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,440
I thought you were cool.

1791
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,470
Here's the thing too
is that hitting folks,

1792
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,760
it always universal language.

1793
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,590
We should learn Farsi.

1794
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:34,011
There you go.

1795
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:35,110
Universal language.

1796
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:39,530
It always blows my mind too because it
brings to the point when people say the

1797
00:49:39,531 --> 00:49:44,000
word fluent when they say they're fluent
in another language and you realize

1798
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:48,800
what it really means to be fluent because
people can speak a lot of a language

1799
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:51,740
and still miss tons of things,

1800
00:49:52,010 --> 00:49:55,090
misunderstand things
and definitely not true.

1801
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,660
Like I speak pretty damn good Spanish
from growing up in a Spanish speaking

1802
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:02,060
household and I've seen,

1803
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,253
I've watched,

1804
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:03,530
uh,

1805
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:07,520
like court shows where they
have an interpreter for
somebody and I've been like,

1806
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:08,361
that's not what he said.

1807
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:09,860
And that like the person said it,

1808
00:50:09,861 --> 00:50:10,430
you know,

1809
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:10,851
like that.

1810
00:50:10,851 --> 00:50:13,820
I've watched translations like
UN things where you'll be like,

1811
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:14,150
oh,

1812
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,961
that person speaks,

1813
00:50:14,961 --> 00:50:16,820
let's say fluent Spanish.

1814
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,290
And you think you're like,

1815
00:50:18,291 --> 00:50:18,441
no,

1816
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:19,520
they speak great English too,

1817
00:50:19,521 --> 00:50:24,380
but it's actually like they speak 90%
good English and can miss a word and

1818
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:28,390
intention the it can be shuffled
around and that when you miss it,

1819
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,220
when you misunderstand something
by a word or I'll have it,

1820
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:31,460
you know,

1821
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,670
in Spanish we're all like you.

1822
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:35,300
You think I'm pretty much on point,

1823
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:36,830
but you missed just a little thing,

1824
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:41,630
a little detail that you don't miss
when it's either your native language or

1825
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:44,990
you're so immersed in a language
that you truly are fluent in it,

1826
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,560
right?

1827
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:45,891
You are,

1828
00:50:45,891 --> 00:50:47,360
you're thinking while you're talking.

1829
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:47,870
Oh yeah.

1830
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:48,171
And like,

1831
00:50:48,171 --> 00:50:48,441
you know,

1832
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:49,640
I mean if you live in a,

1833
00:50:49,641 --> 00:50:49,911
in a,

1834
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:50,570
in a,

1835
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:54,410
in a country where if you live
in your second language country,

1836
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:58,160
you can overtime I think
really speak tremendous,

1837
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,720
whatever that language might be.

1838
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:00,441
You know what I mean?

1839
00:51:00,441 --> 00:51:01,100
Like once you lit,

1840
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:02,990
when you're surrounded by that language,

1841
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:04,880
24 seven but short of that,

1842
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,730
like you really do miss things
and then you let them saying,

1843
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,060
that's also what leads to
misunderstandings lead to argument.

1844
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:15,600
And he's a neat leads to confrontation
and violent sometimes because you

1845
00:51:15,601 --> 00:51:16,880
misunderstood something.

1846
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:18,440
It wasn't even a disagreement.

1847
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:20,780
You just say it right or understand it,

1848
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:21,614
right?

1849
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:22,583
Yeah.

1850
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:22,970
Yeah.

1851
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:23,481
There's a,

1852
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:27,980
apparently there's a new app and it,

1853
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,500
you can talk to it and if you're
talking and whatever language,

1854
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,610
it translates it back to you
in real time and English.

1855
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,290
Wow.

1856
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:40,123
Yeah.

1857
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:41,570
I haven't,

1858
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,740
do you know what I'm talking about Brian?

1859
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:43,191
No,

1860
00:51:43,191 --> 00:51:44,024
I had no idea.

1861
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,330
Yeah.

1862
00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:44,960
Have you heard of this?

1863
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:45,793
No.

1864
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,330
Goddamn and I have to find about this.

1865
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:49,880
I have to Google search it now because,

1866
00:51:49,881 --> 00:51:50,210
um,

1867
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,850
somebody told me about it
and I haven't looked into it,

1868
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,970
but this is apparently
something and either they're
working on and it's going to

1869
00:51:55,971 --> 00:51:58,430
be released soon or it's out now.

1870
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:00,923
Um,

1871
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,990
like with my parents who are Hungarians
speakers and I can understand stuff,

1872
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,240
but even when I speak
to my father in English,

1873
00:52:08,241 --> 00:52:08,600
right?

1874
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,630
Like he has a whole different
understanding of English,

1875
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:12,170
of course,

1876
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,940
as I do in a different continent.

1877
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,380
When he speaks Hungarian,

1878
00:52:15,381 --> 00:52:19,760
I still don't really understand because
of the different time and space that we

1879
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:23,840
grew up learning a language in like even
generational between your father who is

1880
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:24,674
American,

1881
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,560
like you didn't grow up with the
same TV shows that you did or no.

1882
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,110
The same references that you can almost,

1883
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,490
you can misunderstand each other.

1884
00:52:31,491 --> 00:52:32,760
Even then this act,

1885
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,070
this is a real thing.

1886
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,521
Okay.

1887
00:52:34,521 --> 00:52:38,930
It's an APP that translates languages
during real time phone calls.

1888
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:39,860
Wow.

1889
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:44,090
So you can call someone and you can be
talking to someone and in real fucking

1890
00:52:44,091 --> 00:52:44,511
time,

1891
00:52:44,511 --> 00:52:49,511
whatever they say in French or Spanish
two translates it to you in realtime.

1892
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,070
Wow.

1893
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:50,420
Wow.

1894
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:51,110
Wow.

1895
00:52:51,110 --> 00:52:51,943
That's incredible.

1896
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,980
That's nuts.

1897
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:55,401
Yeah.

1898
00:52:55,401 --> 00:52:56,234
We should,

1899
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,430
but we don't know any
other anglers languages,

1900
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:00,530
so we would know if I can
call it Japanese girl.

1901
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:00,951
No,

1902
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:01,784
you don't know shit.

1903
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,790
Have you ever been to kings,

1904
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,750
a Taiwan website?

1905
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:09,170
Have you,

1906
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:10,490
did you see that Twitter did today?

1907
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:10,850
No.

1908
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:11,450
No.

1909
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:12,530
Kings of Taiwan.

1910
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:13,281
I was this,

1911
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:17,420
I was on Amazon last night looking up
books and it said like where it says

1912
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:20,390
recommends to you and one
was recommends to you.

1913
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,990
Uh,

1914
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:22,280
Tie Taiwan,

1915
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:23,300
hookers and I,

1916
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,350
it was a kindle book.

1917
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:24,630
Why?

1918
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,140
And so I like what the fuck is this book?

1919
00:53:26,141 --> 00:53:27,940
And I started reading through
it and then I was like,

1920
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:28,661
oh wait,

1921
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:29,770
this is from a website.

1922
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,170
Somebody just took it and
made it a book on Amazon.

1923
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:35,200
So then I started going on this website
and next thing I know I'm looking deep

1924
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:39,670
into this like report of how
to get hookers and Taiwan
and how there's like it's

1925
00:53:39,671 --> 00:53:42,850
accepted there and how
it is so interesting.

1926
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,580
But then I found myself like on Orbitz,

1927
00:53:44,590 --> 00:53:47,050
like how expensive is it
going to get a Taiwan,

1928
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:50,790
but what am I doing about going to Taiwan?

1929
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:51,663
I was lost.

1930
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,660
I was lost on,

1931
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,970
sometimes you just get lost in
that barrel on the Internet,

1932
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:55,210
you know,

1933
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:59,920
you just not really keep on going fall
down that hole man that you were thinking

1934
00:53:59,921 --> 00:54:01,540
about action going to Taiwan.

1935
00:54:01,690 --> 00:54:02,590
It looked really nice.

1936
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:05,320
I was looking at videos on youtube and
it looked like really pretty there and

1937
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:08,650
stuff and then people were saying
it's like it's better than Vegas.

1938
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:12,580
It's like way better than Vegas
prison just for smoking pot.

1939
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:13,601
Oh No,

1940
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:13,770
no.

1941
00:54:13,770 --> 00:54:14,970
Just don't do drugs or anything.

1942
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:16,030
I follow the rules.

1943
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:20,470
They have articles on that website
about all the laws there and what to do,

1944
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,070
where to stay and what's soapies to get.

1945
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:26,023
Who has the youngest?

1946
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,503
Angela?

1947
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,380
It's a soapy.

1948
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:30,603
Soapy.

1949
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,140
So you guys never been in Taiwan?

1950
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:32,471
No,

1951
00:54:32,471 --> 00:54:33,250
no yet.

1952
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:34,570
We're planning on going for the,

1953
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:35,710
for the Vegas experience

1954
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,093
for the better.

1955
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:41,300
It's really hard to get
people leave the country.

1956
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:42,140
Yeah.

1957
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:42,980
Especially now.

1958
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:43,880
You know,

1959
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,091
like,

1960
00:54:44,091 --> 00:54:46,490
but if you're looking for a place
where really good hookers do it,

1961
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,324
man,

1962
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,390
we're not the world champs
and report back to us

1963
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:51,723
by no means.

1964
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,150
I meant more just for the night life.

1965
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:53,810
It seems like if they,

1966
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,390
it was just seems crazy though.

1967
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:55,721
Uh,

1968
00:54:55,721 --> 00:54:55,901
we,

1969
00:54:55,901 --> 00:54:56,380
um,

1970
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:56,531
yeah,

1971
00:54:56,531 --> 00:54:57,370
we've Sung that song.

1972
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,600
I love the,

1973
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,383
uh,

1974
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:04,180
uh,

1975
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,640
we just had Yoshi on
our show for the ocean.

1976
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,530
A man I've seen too much.

1977
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:10,520
He called,

1978
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:10,660
he,

1979
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:11,000
he,

1980
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,833
he believes in,

1981
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,540
in strictly the hooker experience.

1982
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:13,931
Oh,

1983
00:55:13,931 --> 00:55:14,764
poor Yoshi.

1984
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,420
Yoshi is our friend.

1985
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,620
Frankfurt is great.

1986
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:19,640
And so it was a Amsterdam for,

1987
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:21,443
is that in Germany?

1988
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:22,270
That is,

1989
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:25,150
Yoshi is a standup comedian
friend of ours who,

1990
00:55:25,151 --> 00:55:25,470
uh,

1991
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,040
always worked for porn companies.

1992
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:27,270
Yeah.

1993
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,310
So we would be at the
comedy store and Yoshi was,

1994
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:29,771
she would go,

1995
00:55:29,771 --> 00:55:30,670
she would roll up with like,

1996
00:55:30,671 --> 00:55:32,920
I'll box of [inaudible].

1997
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,130
I was always giving you oh,

1998
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:35,470
agent sensation and check it.

1999
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:37,660
I'll take a DVD

2000
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:40,460
stuff to beat off to.

2001
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:41,300
Oh,

2002
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:44,090
actually we did for a long
part of my collection.

2003
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:49,320
It was secondhand Yoshi DVDs that Yoshi
had given people that they take and

2004
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:50,683
shit.

2005
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:52,083
That's hilarious.

2006
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,790
Yeah.

2007
00:55:54,790 --> 00:55:55,630
That fetish stuff.

2008
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,690
Strange as fuck.

2009
00:55:56,691 --> 00:55:57,071
Like dude.

2010
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:58,960
So like jerk off on girl's feet and shit.

2011
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,113
Weirdness

2012
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:08,690
in glasses and drives all I'd be
like here and all over the glasses,

2013
00:56:08,730 --> 00:56:09,550
which is like,

2014
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:09,770
ah,

2015
00:56:09,770 --> 00:56:11,060
you got it on my glasses.

2016
00:56:11,061 --> 00:56:11,894
I can't,

2017
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,580
I'll try to go back to reading now.

2018
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:15,680
And then they would always try to either.

2019
00:56:15,681 --> 00:56:16,550
Next sentence.

2020
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:17,990
My friend got out,

2021
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:21,140
she does bondage stuff and she just got
a letter the other day that was like,

2022
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:21,441
Hey,

2023
00:56:21,441 --> 00:56:21,771
you know,

2024
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:23,030
I want to be your gimp.

2025
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:23,331
Uh,

2026
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:24,070
I just

2027
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:24,460
can't,

2028
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:24,821
you know,

2029
00:56:24,821 --> 00:56:26,020
I have to wear a mask,

2030
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:30,220
but you can like peel off pieces of
my arm and eat it if you want to.

2031
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:31,720
You could do anything you want to.

2032
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,303
The person that you know,

2033
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:36,540
she said that to you wrote a letter,

2034
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:38,110
an email to this person I know.

2035
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,120
Oh,

2036
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:39,500
okay.

2037
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,530
And it was like this,

2038
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:43,780
any scent attached a photo and
it's so horrible to look at.

2039
00:56:43,781 --> 00:56:44,561
You look at it and go,

2040
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:45,011
wow,

2041
00:56:45,011 --> 00:56:45,550
that's,

2042
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:46,780
that's a serial killer right there.

2043
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,850
That guy right there as a cigarette.

2044
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,850
You know what they say about people
that have like this thing where they're

2045
00:56:51,851 --> 00:56:53,140
always hurting themselves.

2046
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:55,740
I like terrible like
cut themselves or pin,

2047
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:56,020
you know,

2048
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:58,450
like some people like have like crazy,

2049
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:00,520
like genital piercings and shit like that.

2050
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,880
They think that some people that do like
really freaky shit might have a problem

2051
00:57:06,671 --> 00:57:09,070
with a not experiencing
pain the right way.

2052
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:09,371
Oh,

2053
00:57:09,371 --> 00:57:10,330
that's interesting.

2054
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,051
They really,

2055
00:57:11,051 --> 00:57:11,830
yeah.

2056
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:15,100
And it leads to more and more extreme,

2057
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:15,940
uh,

2058
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,390
you know,

2059
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:16,411
uh,

2060
00:57:16,411 --> 00:57:18,880
things to like really jolt
themselves and feel it.

2061
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:19,421
Well,

2062
00:57:19,421 --> 00:57:24,070
some people clearly don't have the same
pain threshold that like I would say the

2063
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:25,060
majority of people have.

2064
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,500
You see some people do
things and you're like,

2065
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,410
how the fuck did that not
hurt you more than anything?

2066
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:31,450
Well you know that guy that
got fucked death by the Horse?

2067
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:32,110
Yeah.

2068
00:57:32,110 --> 00:57:32,770
That guy,

2069
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,603
that guy had,

2070
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,970
that guy had piercings all over his balls.

2071
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:39,850
His balls were like a three ring binder.

2072
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:40,833
I'm not joking.

2073
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:42,010
You just click,

2074
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:42,250
click,

2075
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:42,501
click,

2076
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:43,334
click.

2077
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,080
It's all like this guy was,

2078
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,950
he was a straight up loke stir.

2079
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:50,380
It wasn't just getting horses
to fuck him in the ass.

2080
00:57:50,381 --> 00:57:52,600
He was like run metal
through his ball bag.

2081
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,713
Horses,

2082
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:54,600
horses,

2083
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,150
grazing.

2084
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,730
That horse fucked him to death.

2085
00:57:57,070 --> 00:58:02,070
The craziest thing too about the horse
fucking and then being into that is the

2086
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:08,010
Horse Dick is second to the horse
thrust because an animal thrust,

2087
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:12,010
a thrust from a horse is
in the hospital cancer.

2088
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:14,530
You could line up eight
people and be like,

2089
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:17,470
don't let him push and
that was so fucking,

2090
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:19,333
yeah man.

2091
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,190
All they eat is grass too.

2092
00:58:21,191 --> 00:58:22,060
What the fuck?

2093
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:22,550
Yeah,

2094
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:24,690
I can imagine of grasses or solution.

2095
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:25,300
The whole time.

2096
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:25,930
Everything.

2097
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:29,230
Healthiest fucking just
run for a hundred miles.

2098
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:30,940
Horses he grasps in.

2099
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:31,774
They're yoked.

2100
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:33,030
Yeah.

2101
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:35,320
There's so swollen.

2102
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,550
Any animal more swollen.

2103
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,340
A horse.

2104
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,970
I was about to say if they're
like thoroughbreds and
then I remembered they are

2105
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:44,903
like

2106
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,410
thoroughbred horse,

2107
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:50,320
like there's no animal in the
animal kingdom that is more like,

2108
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,020
and they're fucking beautiful.

2109
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:53,410
Yeah.

2110
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:53,771
You see them,

2111
00:58:53,771 --> 00:58:54,071
you're like,

2112
00:58:54,071 --> 00:58:55,450
that looks like I'm a Jessica.

2113
00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,160
The fact that you can actually ride it
and get it to do shit with you on its

2114
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:00,461
back.

2115
00:59:00,461 --> 00:59:01,060
It's like,

2116
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:02,800
how's 35 miles an hours down?

2117
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,420
You know?

2118
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,580
Like we didn't know the
real problem though.

2119
00:59:06,581 --> 00:59:10,740
It's like the people that want to do
those like jumping things and you know all

2120
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,580
that other kind of crazy
shit with the horses.

2121
00:59:12,581 --> 00:59:13,420
Like those sports,

2122
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:15,190
they can stream sports.

2123
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:17,020
People die during those times.

2124
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:20,400
That's how Christopher you've got fucked
up and the horses get fucked up a lot

2125
00:59:20,401 --> 00:59:20,710
too.

2126
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:21,020
Yeah.

2127
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:21,950
I don't get that.

2128
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,390
I just feel like,

2129
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:23,661
you know,

2130
00:59:23,661 --> 00:59:25,820
that's a scary proposition right there.

2131
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:26,011
You're,

2132
00:59:26,011 --> 00:59:28,070
you're planning on this
animal listening to you.

2133
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:29,150
What if it pulls a muscle?

2134
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:29,430
Yeah.

2135
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:30,263
Are you ready for that?

2136
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:31,603
That shit.

2137
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,260
If you understand like bodies,

2138
00:59:33,261 --> 00:59:34,400
you know the animals,

2139
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,480
the strain things,

2140
00:59:35,481 --> 00:59:36,261
they break legs,

2141
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:38,420
they twist ankle shit goes wrong.

2142
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,670
If Shit's going wrong while
that animal does that,

2143
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,790
you're attached to that fucking thing
and it's going to spike you into the

2144
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,580
ground with all of its
weight on top of you.

2145
00:59:45,581 --> 00:59:46,131
Yeah Dude.

2146
00:59:46,131 --> 00:59:47,150
Fuck riding a horse.

2147
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:47,990
Buck riding a horse.

2148
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,880
I got bucked virtual knuckles.

2149
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:52,360
Girl,

2150
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,021
I'm with you.

2151
00:59:53,021 --> 00:59:53,860
Fuck that.

2152
00:59:54,070 --> 00:59:54,270
Look,

2153
00:59:54,270 --> 00:59:56,120
I think they're beautiful and I wouldn't,

2154
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:57,000
I wouldn't mind writing

2155
00:59:57,110 --> 01:00:01,090
horse like a trail horse and stuff like
that as long as I guess cool horse that

2156
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:02,740
some guy had hadn't tooken care of.

2157
01:00:02,741 --> 01:00:04,060
Like you know that this is like uh,

2158
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,150
an easy going hoarse.

2159
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:09,830
It's always been loved treating those
respect who's been hanging out years.

2160
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:11,380
I'm totally down with that.

2161
01:00:11,381 --> 01:00:11,800
But the real,

2162
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,410
the real problem is
he's fucking a question.

2163
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,070
Events.

2164
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,600
We've got jumping over shit.

2165
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:18,083
Ooh,

2166
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:21,130
for this beautiful,

2167
01:00:21,131 --> 01:00:22,440
magnificent beast.

2168
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,920
I mean short of it is kind
of cool to watch the jump.

2169
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:25,390
It is,

2170
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:26,530
but I mean it have respect.

2171
01:00:26,531 --> 01:00:27,101
Like you said,

2172
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:27,561
this animal,

2173
01:00:27,561 --> 01:00:29,080
he also has a mind of its own.

2174
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:30,490
How do you know what it's going to do?

2175
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:32,830
It wants to do that bullshit.

2176
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,420
It doesn't want to do that.

2177
01:00:36,310 --> 01:00:40,120
Especially cause the animal can clearly
see that there is nothing to the left of

2178
01:00:40,121 --> 01:00:42,880
this fucking boards and
nothing to the right.

2179
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:43,271
It's like,

2180
01:00:43,271 --> 01:00:44,104
why am I jumping?

2181
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,510
And I've seen that.

2182
01:00:46,530 --> 01:00:47,450
I've seen that on,

2183
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,020
I've seen footage of that before
where the horse goes like,

2184
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:51,730
stop stupid.

2185
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:53,470
Why am I jumping this man?

2186
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:53,951
What am I?

2187
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:54,760
You're fucking,

2188
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:55,600
we got trained.

2189
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:57,461
We got options.

2190
01:00:57,461 --> 01:00:58,294
I'm going round.

2191
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,920
Why should I jump you on my back

2192
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:03,920
jumping contest?

2193
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:04,550
Just us.

2194
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:05,690
Who Do you think of jumps highest?

2195
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:06,583
The highest.

2196
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,051
Brian,

2197
01:01:08,051 --> 01:01:08,720
are you rolling?

2198
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:09,720
Are you broken today?

2199
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,620
Something broken you because
it gave me that joint,

2200
01:01:12,621 --> 01:01:17,170
whatever the fuck was [inaudible]
do you have a good verdict?

2201
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,770
Cool.

2202
01:01:17,770 --> 01:01:18,300
Um,

2203
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,950
I could probably jump decent.

2204
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,130
Not like nothing happening

2205
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:23,130
is the one of all like the,

2206
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,910
you know,

2207
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:25,560
the physical things and,

2208
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:25,801
and,

2209
01:01:25,801 --> 01:01:28,470
and attributes that you can desire.

2210
01:01:28,471 --> 01:01:28,621
Like,

2211
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:29,520
I wish I could do this,

2212
01:01:29,521 --> 01:01:30,310
or you know,

2213
01:01:30,310 --> 01:01:32,160
when I remember with somebody,

2214
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:35,760
especially if they're your size and
they have an amazing vertical leap,

2215
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,780
it's the fucking most fascinating thing
to watch them to watch it because it's

2216
01:01:39,781 --> 01:01:40,390
totally natural.

2217
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:42,090
Like I've been with people my height,

2218
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,360
they can literally jump 15
inches higher than I can.

2219
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:47,340
You just like Holy Shit.

2220
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,630
And it's the thing,

2221
01:01:48,631 --> 01:01:49,051
I was like,

2222
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:49,321
man,

2223
01:01:49,321 --> 01:01:50,220
and it is not from,

2224
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,470
and the people that I've seen to do it
wasn't through like about training every

2225
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:53,631
day,

2226
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:54,464
but it was just,

2227
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:55,530
that's how high I can jump.

2228
01:01:57,610 --> 01:01:58,443
I jump all day.

2229
01:01:58,650 --> 01:01:58,840
No,

2230
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,090
it was just a natural,

2231
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,010
hereditary like were whatever.

2232
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:05,250
They were just born being able
to jump through the fucking roof.

2233
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:06,300
And I think it's the person,

2234
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,070
that's what Bo Jackson was like.

2235
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:12,660
That's one of the most amazing
physical specimens in recorded time.

2236
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:13,620
Jackson,

2237
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:16,140
he's still got records
and the NFL combine.

2238
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:18,870
I think he still holds the
record for the 40 does he?

2239
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:20,250
I don't think so.

2240
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,090
Watching that guy.

2241
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:25,010
So that was like watching
a human horse like that.

2242
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,373
It really was.

2243
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:31,580
That guy is an unbelievable athletes
by somebody who wrote a book about him,

2244
01:02:32,731 --> 01:02:33,900
was talking about,

2245
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:35,310
I wish I could remember the guy's name,

2246
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,720
I should Google it,

2247
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,280
watch,

2248
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:41,070
look up Bo Jackson highlights from,

2249
01:02:41,490 --> 01:02:44,950
from football when he
was at Auburn or when he,

2250
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:45,730
when he played for the,

2251
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,190
if he didn't get his hip injured.

2252
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,550
There is absolutely no telling
what that guy would have done.

2253
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:51,690
He would fucking,

2254
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,820
he was so fast that he was like,

2255
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:54,091
you know,

2256
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:56,010
he was like the fastest guy on the team,

2257
01:02:56,370 --> 01:03:01,370
but it was on like a 225 or 230 pound
body so he could trust people to like just

2258
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,960
lower his shoulder and just,

2259
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:06,390
he would deliver hits,

2260
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,230
you know,

2261
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:10,080
he'd give a concussion out
with the football in his hand.

2262
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,130
Wow.

2263
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:16,130
That just unbelievable physical specimen
bojack's in Christ and he played

2264
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:19,860
professional baseball just
because he liked baseball too.

2265
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:20,461
You know,

2266
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,810
just one of those guys who was like,

2267
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:22,351
oh,

2268
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:25,970
how about I'll also play
another professional sport,

2269
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:26,431
be Aussie,

2270
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:26,980
but yeah,

2271
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,350
and be awesome at it and just,

2272
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,610
just home runs.

2273
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,540
I remember watching him.

2274
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:30,840
Here's,

2275
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:31,673
see a guy,

2276
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,360
because I saw him do this for sure.

2277
01:03:33,361 --> 01:03:38,361
There's footage of this Bo
Jackson breaking a baseball
bat over his boyfriend's

2278
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,890
name and like you would
do it like it was nothing.

2279
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:42,390
It lives like a twig man.

2280
01:03:42,391 --> 01:03:44,170
He like blew up like it
was breaking a candy bar.

2281
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:45,040
Be like you have half of,

2282
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:45,953
I'll take half.

2283
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,520
Like he would just snap that shit.

2284
01:03:47,521 --> 01:03:47,791
Fuck.

2285
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:48,540
I struck out,

2286
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,060
apparently he was always
able to do freaky shit.

2287
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:52,950
This guy was talking about
that when he was young.

2288
01:03:52,951 --> 01:03:54,840
He used to be able to jump over cars.

2289
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,180
He gets jumped over the hood of a car.

2290
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,060
I saw a guy do that too.

2291
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:01,040
That's crazy.

2292
01:04:01,050 --> 01:04:02,660
Was that's like one of
the things I was talking.

2293
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,830
I saw a guy do that who
was smaller than me,

2294
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:05,693
shorter than me.

2295
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:06,623
You know,

2296
01:04:06,660 --> 01:04:08,790
a total fucking just yoked dude.

2297
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:09,690
He played running back.

2298
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,620
He actually broke California state
records in high school and he did that.

2299
01:04:13,621 --> 01:04:15,480
He jumped over the hood
of a car and I was like,

2300
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,550
that is amazing to watch.

2301
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,810
I mean amazing and crazy to watch a
guy like that sprint and you're like,

2302
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,321
oh dude,

2303
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:24,240
I could run forever and
never sprint like that.

2304
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,073
She does.

2305
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:25,861
Yeah.

2306
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:30,360
There's a kid that I saw on a
video who jumped off a roof,

2307
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:35,460
did a back flip off a roof and it was
like a three story or two story building

2308
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:37,470
was the most ridiculous
shit I've ever seen.

2309
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,960
And the kid made it and
lived in it was fine.

2310
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,910
If you want to see like that,

2311
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:42,631
that's incredible.

2312
01:04:42,631 --> 01:04:43,830
If you want to see like a crate,

2313
01:04:44,010 --> 01:04:49,010
like a crazy other level like type of
athlete meaning athlete like you just see

2314
01:04:50,191 --> 01:04:51,750
like Oh said another gear that they have.

2315
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,100
The other people just don't have.

2316
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:54,510
If you look at um,

2317
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:58,640
there's this guy that
plays football for like a,

2318
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:01,890
he plays for the bills I think now his
name's Cj spiller and when he was at

2319
01:05:01,891 --> 01:05:02,724
Clemson,

2320
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:06,180
there's highlights of him
like where he would stop,

2321
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:10,020
like stop in the middle of the field and
there's like five guys surrounding him

2322
01:05:10,021 --> 01:05:11,310
and he just turns it on again.

2323
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,420
But he goes to like,

2324
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:15,030
he goes like fifth gear
before they get to first.

2325
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:15,864
You know,

2326
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:16,793
that's like,

2327
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,390
he's to his gear so much faster than them.

2328
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:21,390
But those are all like dynamite.

2329
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:22,300
Yeah.

2330
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:22,631
You know,

2331
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:23,410
and you're just like that.

2332
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,370
That doesn't make sense.

2333
01:05:24,371 --> 01:05:28,870
Like are like Devin Hester is this
guy who he plays for the bears.

2334
01:05:28,871 --> 01:05:29,090
He's like,

2335
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:29,770
you know,

2336
01:05:29,770 --> 01:05:30,100
well,

2337
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,520
well known returner and if
you watch his highlights,

2338
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:35,110
the thing about him is that he hits,

2339
01:05:35,111 --> 01:05:39,520
they say like there are guys who
have faster 40 times than him,

2340
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:44,770
but he hits his highest speed immediately.

2341
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:45,490
Wow.

2342
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:48,520
So it's like he gets the
ball and then he's just like,

2343
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:50,710
here I'm running as fast as I can.

2344
01:05:50,711 --> 01:05:52,150
The first second I have the ball.

2345
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:54,070
Whereas everybody else has to stop.

2346
01:05:54,190 --> 01:05:54,550
Yeah.

2347
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:55,091
And you just like,

2348
01:05:55,091 --> 01:05:55,541
Holy Shit.

2349
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:56,081
He is like,

2350
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:56,914
he just,

2351
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,440
he hit fifth gear immediately

2352
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,390
and you see the other guy
that's a gate explosions.

2353
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:01,550
Yeah.

2354
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,540
It's incredible.

2355
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:03,470
It's incredible.

2356
01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:03,741
There's,

2357
01:06:03,741 --> 01:06:03,931
yeah,

2358
01:06:03,931 --> 01:06:04,460
there's,

2359
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,830
there's no even playing field.

2360
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:10,790
The idea that this uneven playing field
when it comes to human beings is crazy.

2361
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:11,150
Yeah.

2362
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:13,040
Just by looking at the
different sizes of us.

2363
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:14,570
There's a reason why
we need weight classes.

2364
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:15,290
Okay.

2365
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:17,810
And the variables inside
of weight classes,

2366
01:06:17,990 --> 01:06:21,380
those are also pretty
extreme with some athletes.

2367
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:23,330
Some people just aren't that coordinated.

2368
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,590
They don't move that well,

2369
01:06:24,591 --> 01:06:25,880
they don't have that kind of power.

2370
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:29,570
And then there's guys that can just learn
things like immediately and they can

2371
01:06:29,630 --> 01:06:33,380
run like a gazelle and they can do
shit to you that you can't do to them.

2372
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:36,170
And they were out of the box like that.

2373
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:36,650
Yeah.

2374
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:36,861
You know,

2375
01:06:36,861 --> 01:06:37,131
there's,

2376
01:06:37,131 --> 01:06:39,230
there's guys that are
out of the box athletes.

2377
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,670
If you were thinking about how

2378
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:45,300
unlikely the total
package of Lebron James,

2379
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:46,210
that's crazy.

2380
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,240
That like that is a 0.001% like package
a critical date gives birth to him.

2381
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:55,291
Yes.

2382
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:56,124
His mom really crash.

2383
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,293
Yes.

2384
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:58,570
Not only is his momma crackhead,

2385
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:00,820
his mom allegedly was
fucking one of his teammates.

2386
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:01,240
Oh,

2387
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:01,910
that's right.

2388
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:02,630
That's true.

2389
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:02,920
Uh,

2390
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,120
hot sauce in that bag.

2391
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:05,200
The latte West,

2392
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:05,960
is that true?

2393
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,793
Yes.

2394
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:08,140
Delonte west man,

2395
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,760
his wife,

2396
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,780
his allegedly had a
substance abuse problem.

2397
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:14,290
Okay.

2398
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:17,890
She gives birth to this
gigantic super athletes.

2399
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:18,551
Amazing.

2400
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:21,250
Who moves like a panther,

2401
01:07:21,251 --> 01:07:22,750
like a giant panther,

2402
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:23,500
you know,

2403
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:23,861
if that,

2404
01:07:23,861 --> 01:07:25,540
if Lebron James was an MMA,

2405
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,670
do you know how many people
that got would be fucking up?

2406
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:28,773
Oh yeah.

2407
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:32,500
If you train that guy and that guy wanted
to fight if he had the will to fight.

2408
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:33,503
Yeah.

2409
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:35,130
Yeah.

2410
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:35,251
Well,

2411
01:07:35,251 --> 01:07:35,760
you know,

2412
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,380
in high school he was all state
tied and playing football.

2413
01:07:40,381 --> 01:07:41,310
Cause people always talk about,

2414
01:07:41,311 --> 01:07:42,350
can you imagine this time?

2415
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:43,380
But when it's playing football,

2416
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:44,490
he stopped playing.

2417
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:47,190
I think after his sophomore season
it was all state like already.

2418
01:07:47,191 --> 01:07:50,790
Like this can be somebody you're gonna
have to deal with and stop playing.

2419
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:52,170
But you look at that body six,

2420
01:07:52,171 --> 01:07:53,004
eight,

2421
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:56,880
two 70 [inaudible] your body
toward and learn how to fight.

2422
01:07:57,350 --> 01:07:57,550
Oh,

2423
01:07:57,550 --> 01:07:58,180
right.

2424
01:07:58,180 --> 01:08:00,570
What time did play football
this whole time with Jesus,

2425
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:04,950
Lebron James Basketball.

2426
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,020
It's just whatever Tom tells me.

2427
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:08,910
If you don't watch
anything outside of that.

2428
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:09,121
No,

2429
01:08:09,121 --> 01:08:09,954
I like tennis.

2430
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,640
I used to about like ladies golf.

2431
01:08:11,641 --> 01:08:12,474
Do you still

2432
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,540
have that day isn't gay come on?

2433
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:19,760
Is that the case that I've
heard that said before?

2434
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,780
What's that ladies?

2435
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:22,100
Golf is like a lot of uh,

2436
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:22,963
k checks.

2437
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,540
I think there's a little bit of support.

2438
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:26,121
100% yeah,

2439
01:08:26,121 --> 01:08:26,730
of course.

2440
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:27,350
Always do.

2441
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,210
But there's definitely
get the sticks they use.

2442
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:30,103
There's definitely,

2443
01:08:31,610 --> 01:08:32,720
this is trying today.

2444
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,460
There's definitely loves anger is Twitter.

2445
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:38,294
That's what it is.

2446
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:40,400
I like the came here and my Twitter.

2447
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:42,170
I don't know who watches ladies' golf.

2448
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:43,040
I'm not sure what the,

2449
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,350
they are amazing offers that are golfers.

2450
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:50,450
So essentially just a bunch of
Lesbos around staring at each other.

2451
01:08:50,451 --> 01:08:51,830
It's amazing how good they are though.

2452
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:52,873
Fuck man.

2453
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,090
Well,

2454
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:56,480
it's one of the few groups that
lesbians available to really grow.

2455
01:08:56,481 --> 01:08:57,640
Like lesbians can't,

2456
01:08:57,660 --> 01:08:59,030
they have a hard time getting a community,

2457
01:08:59,530 --> 01:08:59,890
you know,

2458
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:02,720
like gay dudes have massive
communities all over the country.

2459
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:07,880
There's parts of the tenderloin and
if you go to the Santa Monica area,

2460
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:10,443
West Hollywood,

2461
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:13,160
Santa Monica Boulevard area,

2462
01:09:13,161 --> 01:09:14,120
there are days they've,

2463
01:09:14,270 --> 01:09:14,690
they've,

2464
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:16,300
they've all can go on rated.

2465
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:17,510
They know where the party's at.

2466
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:20,063
Yeah,

2467
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,910
the but then fucking that place
on Hollywood boulevard though.

2468
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:24,561
The west side,

2469
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:25,394
Santa Monica Boulevard,

2470
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,510
West Hollywood spot.

2471
01:09:26,690 --> 01:09:28,010
That is the gay spot on earth.

2472
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:28,531
Sorry,

2473
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:29,001
which one?

2474
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:30,080
Let's study area.

2475
01:09:30,110 --> 01:09:32,630
That whole area while you
drive in Santa Monica,

2476
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:32,960
is that,

2477
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,550
is that club rage still there?

2478
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:35,413
Is it a five?

2479
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:36,580
I don't go every week.

2480
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:38,880
That's the flagship club.

2481
01:09:38,950 --> 01:09:39,950
That's the one that's on the big,

2482
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:41,630
that was the one that I think,

2483
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:46,640
you know we're Dakini is w I was coming
down though and I'm at the red light

2484
01:09:46,641 --> 01:09:50,630
there and it was a Saturday night and
it was fucking beautiful weather and

2485
01:09:50,631 --> 01:09:53,510
everybody was out and it leaves
a gay party on the streets,

2486
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:53,900
man.

2487
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:54,140
Yeah.

2488
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:57,500
There's these two dudes and
they both have their hands,

2489
01:09:57,501 --> 01:10:01,970
their fingers looped into
each other's a belt loops.

2490
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:02,270
Right.

2491
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:03,650
And they were like in a lot,

2492
01:10:03,651 --> 01:10:06,680
because I kind of scissoring and
just grinding Dick's together.

2493
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,530
It was like I can only wash is a certain
amount of time before some days slips

2494
01:10:12,580 --> 01:10:15,490
and I gotta get Outta here like this.

2495
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:15,831
It was,

2496
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:18,230
it was like a fucking bomb had been,

2497
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:18,670
you know,

2498
01:10:18,670 --> 01:10:21,230
I did and I had to get
outside of the blast radius

2499
01:10:23,210 --> 01:10:24,043
bomb here,

2500
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,690
but they're so happy.

2501
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:27,920
They're happy as fuck

2502
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:28,430
joy.

2503
01:10:28,430 --> 01:10:28,581
Well,

2504
01:10:28,581 --> 01:10:31,460
we used to live next to a
bear bar in silver lake,

2505
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:33,290
so you'd have to walk past the bear bar,

2506
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:34,990
the best get to trader Joe.

2507
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:35,570
Whoa.

2508
01:10:35,570 --> 01:10:37,970
That's a specific type
of game is so wonderful.

2509
01:10:37,971 --> 01:10:38,540
And so like,

2510
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:39,080
you know,

2511
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,510
Tuesday nights is like job Tuesdays,

2512
01:10:41,511 --> 01:10:42,390
job Tuesday,

2513
01:10:42,391 --> 01:10:43,221
big sign out front.

2514
01:10:43,221 --> 01:10:47,630
It's rem job Tuesdays and they had a huge
rooster in the bag and like these guys

2515
01:10:47,631 --> 01:10:48,464
just party.

2516
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,050
You'd hear like you drive by,

2517
01:10:51,051 --> 01:10:51,261
it could be,

2518
01:10:51,261 --> 01:10:53,930
you could have be having
like the like the most quiet,

2519
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,130
lame kind of night and you're like,

2520
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:56,060
there's nothing going on.

2521
01:10:56,061 --> 01:10:56,360
Yeah.

2522
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:57,380
Then as you pulled up,

2523
01:10:57,381 --> 01:10:57,740
you're like,

2524
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:58,573
Ooh.

2525
01:10:58,670 --> 01:10:59,000
You're like,

2526
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,181
oh,

2527
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:00,014
there's the decline.

2528
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:02,480
And like you're like,

2529
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,110
ah,

2530
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:04,220
neighborhood is alive,

2531
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:04,371
right?

2532
01:11:04,371 --> 01:11:04,691
Yeah.

2533
01:11:04,691 --> 01:11:04,810
And

2534
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:05,351
the best part,

2535
01:11:05,351 --> 01:11:07,240
there was a security guard
that would stand out,

2536
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:09,610
but because he was in front of a gay bar,

2537
01:11:09,611 --> 01:11:11,200
you didn't know if it was just a costume.

2538
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:14,040
First few times I was

2539
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,480
going on out tonight and he's like,

2540
01:11:15,481 --> 01:11:15,631
no,

2541
01:11:15,631 --> 01:11:16,530
I'm the security guy.

2542
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,880
He had a mustache,

2543
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,183
mustache,

2544
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,291
very few.

2545
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:26,990
The pull off the John Stossel
fat thick upper monsters.

2546
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,480
We commit to that strange.

2547
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:33,240
Well that's how I always wonder that
because people usually mock the mustache.

2548
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:33,540
No,

2549
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:33,631
are,

2550
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,310
they rocked the ironic mustache,

2551
01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:38,520
but in the gay community it's like,

2552
01:11:38,610 --> 01:11:39,443
Yo,

2553
01:11:40,190 --> 01:11:41,500
I'm down for you.

2554
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:42,700
I saw a guy the other day,

2555
01:11:42,701 --> 01:11:43,471
it was beautiful.

2556
01:11:43,471 --> 01:11:48,360
He had timberlands on and he had
cut off Jean shorts and he had like,

2557
01:11:48,361 --> 01:11:48,960
uh,

2558
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,650
like uh,

2559
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:53,700
one of those leather scally cap song
and he had a Jean jacket that was

2560
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:54,660
sleeveless.

2561
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:55,710
Nice.

2562
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:56,880
He was fucking,

2563
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:57,960
that's like,

2564
01:11:57,960 --> 01:12:01,230
this was like right after
I worked in San Francisco,

2565
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,030
San Francisco with Greg Fitzsimmons.

2566
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,990
Greg Fitzsimmons fucking killed me.

2567
01:12:07,150 --> 01:12:07,400
He,

2568
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,610
he got on stage and he goes,

2569
01:12:08,611 --> 01:12:10,950
this is the last city
where there's real faggot

2570
01:12:13,300 --> 01:12:16,380
leather pants and a handlebar mustache.

2571
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:19,590
It fucking crushed too.

2572
01:12:19,591 --> 01:12:20,490
Cause it was so true.

2573
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,960
He's unabashed animals.

2574
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:24,540
That's fun and funny.

2575
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:27,930
That guy that you described,

2576
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:28,710
like if,

2577
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,070
if,

2578
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:34,070
if cock was a company that's the chairman
and CEO of cock in charge with the

2579
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:36,510
fluffy socks,

2580
01:12:36,511 --> 01:12:36,691
you know,

2581
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:37,381
the style.

2582
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:37,711
Yeah.

2583
01:12:37,711 --> 01:12:40,740
Scrunched down and the
timberlands like open.

2584
01:12:40,741 --> 01:12:44,130
And then he's got cutoff Jean
shorts and a Jean Jacket.

2585
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:44,780
He's,

2586
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:46,320
he was just so gay.

2587
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:48,420
San Francisco,

2588
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:51,780
Santa Monica in both Santa Monica.

2589
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:53,460
This one,

2590
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:54,450
the gas guy,

2591
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:58,020
the only one that comes close to him.

2592
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:01,240
I was in Houston once and I find I wanted,

2593
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:05,820
want to congratulate this guy
the way he was rocking it,

2594
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,700
but I didn't want to
offend them so I let it go.

2595
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,030
But he had leg warmers on that.

2596
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:17,031
We're rainbow that's already covered
leg warmers on and he had these little

2597
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:19,590
designer,

2598
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:24,620
like they looked like some odd tennis
shoe type thing that he was wearing,

2599
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,060
some very trendy tennis shoe.

2600
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:30,150
And then he had these boys gym shorts,

2601
01:13:30,420 --> 01:13:31,290
these board member,

2602
01:13:31,300 --> 01:13:34,830
those gym shorts he used to wear do
your blue with the white stripe and they

2603
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:35,730
were way too small.

2604
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:36,780
They were way too small.

2605
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:37,351
Okay.

2606
01:13:37,351 --> 01:13:39,240
And he's our frail man as it is.

2607
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,610
And then he had a pink skin,

2608
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:46,611
tight shirt and a some
crazy multicolored Bandana.

2609
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:48,300
And as he was working out,

2610
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:49,134
he's working out like this,

2611
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,033
like grunting

2612
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,930
legwarmers man gas man that's
ever walked the face of the earth.

2613
01:14:01,950 --> 01:14:02,321
Absolutely.

2614
01:14:02,321 --> 01:14:02,971
This guy,

2615
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:04,770
if he got together with the other guy,

2616
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:08,330
they would create a black
hole of homosexuality.

2617
01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:10,810
It would eat its way through the cement,

2618
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:11,580
eat cement,

2619
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:12,060
spit,

2620
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:12,960
come back at you.

2621
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:16,540
It would be a sinkhole of gay.

2622
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:17,940
If you slipped and fell into it,

2623
01:14:17,941 --> 01:14:18,660
you'd fall,

2624
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,690
fall prey to the game.

2625
01:14:19,691 --> 01:14:20,790
You saw something.

2626
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:21,750
Which one?

2627
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,710
And lived in San Francisco.

2628
01:14:22,711 --> 01:14:25,350
He lives in San Francisco
at the college that she,

2629
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:29,400
you definitely saw the gay thing
that you can see during the,

2630
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:34,020
you said during the parade one time
you saw a guy is fucking on the corner.

2631
01:14:34,030 --> 01:14:34,863
Yeah,

2632
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:35,551
on the street.

2633
01:14:35,551 --> 01:14:36,390
Just on the street.

2634
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:37,580
I mean,

2635
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,240
seen guys dress or a bed.

2636
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,510
Do you see guys bud fucking on the street?

2637
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:43,830
You'd be like straight up.

2638
01:14:43,831 --> 01:14:45,880
You'll never forget that
street at that moment.

2639
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:46,800
It's one of the gas station.

2640
01:14:47,210 --> 01:14:47,610
Sure.

2641
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:50,810
But I think it was during the
Folsom street fair and all in all,

2642
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,700
so that,

2643
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,120
that's like the gay
Mardi gras on the street.

2644
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,240
I like to limit it to fairs.

2645
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:00,030
Don't bring your kids if you're willing
to fuck on the street during the fair.

2646
01:15:00,031 --> 01:15:01,230
You're a real gangster.

2647
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:01,560
Yes.

2648
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:02,580
You're out there just fucking,

2649
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,193
he's here.

2650
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:05,430
You're a part of the problem.

2651
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,353
Oh Hey,

2652
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:07,350
we're at the,

2653
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:07,651
the,

2654
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:09,600
the bare Jim in our old neighborhood.

2655
01:15:09,601 --> 01:15:09,910
Yeah.

2656
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:10,100
Yeah.

2657
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:10,980
And some guys,

2658
01:15:10,981 --> 01:15:13,710
so this thing also in
bare culture is they,

2659
01:15:13,711 --> 01:15:14,640
these big guys,

2660
01:15:14,641 --> 01:15:16,860
they also like to build their Musk.

2661
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:17,490
Yes.

2662
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:18,960
And that's another part of it.

2663
01:15:18,961 --> 01:15:19,681
And Tommy,

2664
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:22,170
one time I would think you
were downwind of a guy,

2665
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:22,531
weren't you?

2666
01:15:22,531 --> 01:15:24,330
A fan was behind him or something.

2667
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:25,020
Fuck man.

2668
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:25,980
And you could smell it.

2669
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:26,391
It was like,

2670
01:15:26,391 --> 01:15:27,410
it was so strong.

2671
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:29,720
It wasn't like Jim Smell strong.

2672
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:33,500
It was like a personal body odor that,

2673
01:15:33,501 --> 01:15:33,681
you know,

2674
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:37,550
you can just tell when someone's Bi
was kicking butt kicking because he was

2675
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:38,120
dirty.

2676
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:39,440
Like cotton washed it.

2677
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:39,831
Yeah.

2678
01:15:39,831 --> 01:15:40,071
Yeah.

2679
01:15:40,071 --> 01:15:40,291
It was,

2680
01:15:40,291 --> 01:15:41,720
it was a definitely a,

2681
01:15:41,780 --> 01:15:44,480
I haven't showered in like in a while.

2682
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:48,120
Maybe it's to ward off the smell
of shit while you're fucking,

2683
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,720
you ever think about that?

2684
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:52,203
I,

2685
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:52,551
I mean,

2686
01:15:52,551 --> 01:15:54,530
there's got to be such a pride.

2687
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,660
He had such pride about his Musk.

2688
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,310
I could just tell like
the way he was like,

2689
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:58,610
right.

2690
01:15:58,610 --> 01:16:00,140
You picking up what I'm
putting out there right now?

2691
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,140
Like look about them genre.

2692
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,003
Yeah.

2693
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:06,800
I imagine that some people were walking
through the gym that day like thanks

2694
01:16:06,801 --> 01:16:07,400
brother.

2695
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:11,270
Thanks for putting this out here cause
you got me fired up to be ready to do

2696
01:16:11,271 --> 01:16:12,104
some squats.

2697
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:14,540
I'm writing this motherfucker smells good.

2698
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,033
Damn.

2699
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:17,751
Yeah,

2700
01:16:17,751 --> 01:16:20,300
there's different levels
of like gay guys to write,

2701
01:16:20,301 --> 01:16:24,320
but what they're into like some guys would
just send to other like crazy big gay

2702
01:16:24,321 --> 01:16:26,750
guys and some guys they like twinks.

2703
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,500
They like little tiny little boy.

2704
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:29,421
Yeah.

2705
01:16:29,421 --> 01:16:31,790
There was this dude that
I shave it down brother,

2706
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:32,790
but I knew that it was a

2707
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,510
producer type character.

2708
01:16:35,930 --> 01:16:39,910
So wealthy character always had
like these young boys with them.

2709
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:42,260
They were always like just 20 years old.

2710
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:47,261
A little confused like that's I know
a well known comic or likes that one.

2711
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:48,321
The only know why.

2712
01:16:48,321 --> 01:16:48,561
Yeah,

2713
01:16:48,561 --> 01:16:49,190
that's true.

2714
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:49,911
I know several.

2715
01:16:49,911 --> 01:16:50,300
Yeah,

2716
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:51,270
that's sort of a,

2717
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,850
it's kind of a type.

2718
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:54,121
There's all types.

2719
01:16:54,121 --> 01:16:55,470
There's Otters,

2720
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:56,821
otters.

2721
01:16:56,821 --> 01:16:57,420
What's an honor?

2722
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:57,571
No,

2723
01:16:57,571 --> 01:16:58,770
I believe in honor.

2724
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:00,211
It's a tall,

2725
01:17:00,211 --> 01:17:01,380
slender.

2726
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:05,850
Hairless is an auditor as
opposed to a big hairy fat,

2727
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,810
which is a bear.

2728
01:17:06,930 --> 01:17:10,050
And a younger bear is actually a cub cub

2729
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:15,310
bears go with cubs and cubs
are just smaller and more.

2730
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,590
It was wrong.

2731
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:21,710
But now I heard that the word Twinkies
becoming taboo to the way that bag is

2732
01:17:21,711 --> 01:17:23,060
kind of not cool to say.

2733
01:17:23,061 --> 01:17:24,850
I think twink is starting to become

2734
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:28,710
what stopped,

2735
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:30,803
you know,

2736
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,750
well here's what happened.

2737
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:33,321
So you know,

2738
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:34,730
Andy Cohen on Bravo,

2739
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,700
I think he went on some
other show and he's like,

2740
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,170
oh look at all these twinks here.

2741
01:17:39,171 --> 01:17:43,820
And then the twin community got really
upset and started tweeting and so he

2742
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:44,960
apologized.

2743
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:49,333
But um,

2744
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:53,900
everybody is just looking for
an opportunity to be sensitive.

2745
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:59,260
We are in such a weird time is it's
like people have found reward in like

2746
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:02,030
pointing at like hot button,

2747
01:18:02,031 --> 01:18:02,781
things like that.

2748
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:02,991
Like,

2749
01:18:02,991 --> 01:18:03,411
Hey,

2750
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:03,741
you know,

2751
01:18:03,741 --> 01:18:05,360
at the twin community we do not

2752
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,683
organize.

2753
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:11,030
You know,

2754
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,700
who else

2755
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,980
is fucking super annoying and like this,

2756
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:18,690
I mean this one's way different level
of like how fucking what assholes they

2757
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:19,170
are.

2758
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:22,310
Is this like 1 million moms group?

2759
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:26,820
It's just like we're mothers that are
Christian that want to raise the fucking

2760
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,560
like great kids and like,

2761
01:18:28,561 --> 01:18:31,290
but we're complete politically bigoted,

2762
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:31,561
uh,

2763
01:18:31,561 --> 01:18:33,030
discriminatory assholes.

2764
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,550
They publicly lash out for the,

2765
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:40,610
this is like the second or third time at
JC Penney for having Ellen to generous

2766
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:41,623
after spokesman.

2767
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:42,350
They're like,

2768
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,140
you realize that none of us are ever going
to shop there again because you good.

2769
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:48,030
You hired Ellen to be
like that kind of shit.

2770
01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:48,540
Like,

2771
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:52,260
and they got really mad about her latest
Christmas commercial with Elvis and

2772
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:52,471
they're like,

2773
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:54,750
you have fucking a gay woman with Elvis.

2774
01:18:54,751 --> 01:18:56,190
What's going to fucking happen next?

2775
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:58,180
Hey,

2776
01:18:58,180 --> 01:18:59,040
that's a good point.

2777
01:18:59,310 --> 01:18:59,820
Yeah.

2778
01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:00,031
I mean,

2779
01:19:00,031 --> 01:19:00,301
what,

2780
01:19:00,301 --> 01:19:01,134
what happened?

2781
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:07,980
Eons mixing up with
magical creatures chick.

2782
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:08,731
The crazy.

2783
01:19:08,731 --> 01:19:09,340
Definitely.

2784
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:12,220
What if they like develop some
ways they have nefarious intention,

2785
01:19:12,230 --> 01:19:15,810
so they developed some sort of lesbian
pixie dust sprayed over a city when

2786
01:19:15,811 --> 01:19:17,890
they're flying around
and your kids because

2787
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,223
yeah,

2788
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,830
we've got a bunch of miniature
gay elves running around.

2789
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:23,790
Listen man,

2790
01:19:23,790 --> 01:19:24,623
you mock

2791
01:19:26,710 --> 01:19:27,511
Ian Community.

2792
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:28,950
Have these genres.

2793
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:29,610
I don't know.

2794
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:30,151
I don't know.

2795
01:19:30,151 --> 01:19:30,730
Yeah,

2796
01:19:30,730 --> 01:19:30,960
yeah.

2797
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:31,711
They have lipstick.

2798
01:19:31,711 --> 01:19:32,260
Lesbian.

2799
01:19:32,260 --> 01:19:34,380
I'd have those Fred Flintstone.

2800
01:19:34,381 --> 01:19:37,050
Looking lesbian lipsticks the best,

2801
01:19:37,051 --> 01:19:37,884
right?

2802
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:39,840
Yeah.

2803
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:40,673
The lipsticks

2804
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:43,521
100%.

2805
01:19:43,521 --> 01:19:45,540
Yet the other ones are intimidating,

2806
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:46,920
especially if they want to fight,

2807
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:48,390
but not always good at shows.

2808
01:19:48,391 --> 01:19:48,750
Either.

2809
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,760
You'd want to argue over
the best instance of humor

2810
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:54,360
can be cool.

2811
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:55,213
They can be.

2812
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:59,640
It's like you can't really generalize
a whole fucking sexual orientation.

2813
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,500
I've met a lot of cool lesbians.

2814
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:04,680
Annoying straight people too.

2815
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:06,970
God Damn it.

2816
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,873
That's true.

2817
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,350
That's sort of the anti positive approach.

2818
01:20:10,770 --> 01:20:12,570
Everybody's got their own special gift.

2819
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:16,770
Everybody sucks in their own
way to the dark play trail.

2820
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:17,881
That's hilarious.

2821
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:18,714
And so true.

2822
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:20,063
It's true.

2823
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,620
We have a little something,

2824
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,920
a little something fucking with us.

2825
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:23,930
I had to ask you this.

2826
01:20:24,550 --> 01:20:25,140
I haven't,

2827
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:25,440
uh,

2828
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,370
I wanted to get your thoughts on uh,

2829
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:31,890
Pacquiao going down to
mark has this crazy crazy,

2830
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:32,140
huh?

2831
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:32,580
Yeah.

2832
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:34,350
Well many pack y'all.

2833
01:20:34,351 --> 01:20:34,711
First of all,

2834
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,210
it's a super nice guy.

2835
01:20:36,590 --> 01:20:39,360
Tosh and I film this thing
with him where I played,

2836
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:39,540
uh,

2837
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,730
Daniel Tosh is manager and uh,

2838
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,713
he uh,

2839
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:46,990
was to let Manny Pacquiao punch him in
the face of some strange reason like

2840
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:47,540
that.

2841
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:48,660
And so Manny Pacquiao,

2842
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:50,190
he's very nice about it by the way.

2843
01:20:50,191 --> 01:20:50,760
He like,

2844
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,680
like kind of tapped him and
then like hit him harder,

2845
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:56,910
hit him harder and Taj is looking at
me like what the fuck man mean he's not

2846
01:20:56,911 --> 01:20:58,670
going to hurt you to little harder,

2847
01:20:58,950 --> 01:20:59,783
harder,

2848
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:00,390
you know.

2849
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,720
And,

2850
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,070
and even then Manny Pacquiao
just sort of pop like so gently,

2851
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:05,430
you know?

2852
01:21:05,430 --> 01:21:06,330
But he's so nice.

2853
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,710
He's like a really friendly guy.

2854
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,520
Like he doesn't have any
like weird feeling around
like he's a super duper star.

2855
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:14,730
He travels deep with like this giant
entourage entourages taken care of

2856
01:21:14,731 --> 01:21:18,210
everything around him all the time and
he's like the nicest guy in the world.

2857
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:20,490
So that made me sad.

2858
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,010
But that's the game he's playing.

2859
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:24,360
He plays a crazy game.

2860
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,360
That game is you,

2861
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:29,550
you are competing with your consciousness,

2862
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:30,930
you're competing with
your physical health,

2863
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:35,670
your competing against another
man who's a trained killer.

2864
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:36,773
And when,

2865
01:21:37,290 --> 01:21:38,280
when he hits you,

2866
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,641
you,

2867
01:21:38,641 --> 01:21:40,200
your body is just like any other body.

2868
01:21:40,230 --> 01:21:42,750
And if someone hits you
perfectly like he did twice,

2869
01:21:42,751 --> 01:21:47,070
he name dropped him with that first one
and mo most likely he was still hurt

2870
01:21:47,071 --> 01:21:47,580
from that.

2871
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:51,510
But that's second punch was so powerful.

2872
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:56,690
That was like the perfect punch cause
Pacquiao was moving forward and mark has

2873
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:01,830
caught him moving forward and just crushed
him in his tracks and he was lights

2874
01:22:01,831 --> 01:22:02,730
out on the way down.

2875
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:02,911
Yeah,

2876
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:04,420
it was one of the worst or,

2877
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:07,940
or best one punch knockouts
I've ever seen in all of boxing.

2878
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:09,540
I think it goes in the top 10.

2879
01:22:09,880 --> 01:22:10,160
It's,

2880
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:10,970
it's like,

2881
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:11,601
I mean that,

2882
01:22:11,601 --> 01:22:13,020
that shit is right up there with uh,

2883
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,330
Paul Williams getting knocked
out by Sergio Martinez.

2884
01:22:15,331 --> 01:22:16,164
Did you see that?

2885
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,780
Sergio Martinez is,

2886
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:22,410
it got a vicious lefthand and he's like
super athletic and moves around a lot

2887
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:27,330
and he nailed Paul Williams like this
perfect overhand left as he was moving in

2888
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:30,360
and just spun him around and face planted.

2889
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,620
It was just like that.

2890
01:22:31,740 --> 01:22:32,700
He's at that,

2891
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:34,580
but I just didn't expect to see that.

2892
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:35,370
I think,

2893
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:35,641
well,

2894
01:22:35,641 --> 01:22:36,260
you know,

2895
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:41,260
I think I was seeing some stats on it
that that was his first time being knocked

2896
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:42,930
out.

2897
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:43,171
Yeah.

2898
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:44,740
Since 19 well he hasn't been,

2899
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:48,540
maybe not sound even [inaudible]
98 I think he's been dropped,

2900
01:22:48,541 --> 01:22:49,070
dropped.

2901
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:50,010
I think it has been dropped.

2902
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:54,780
Some incredible stat that like it hadn't
happened since 98 that he was thinking,

2903
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:55,890
well actually now that I think about it,

2904
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:58,650
I think mark has dropped him in his fight,

2905
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,930
this fight before he knocked him out.

2906
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:02,970
That was the first time mark
has it knocked him down.

2907
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:03,601
He had knocked,

2908
01:23:03,601 --> 01:23:04,470
mark has done before,

2909
01:23:04,471 --> 01:23:06,520
but mark has had staggered him before,

2910
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,160
but somebody had stopped
him earlier in his career.

2911
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:09,841
He had,

2912
01:23:09,841 --> 01:23:12,640
he had been knocked out early in
his career but never liked this.

2913
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:16,180
This was one of those knockouts
that might just be a game changer.

2914
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:16,770
Yeah,

2915
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:17,603
that's so really,

2916
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:18,970
and you know boxers,

2917
01:23:18,971 --> 01:23:23,260
what you're seeing first of all in in
many is you're seeing a guy who's already

2918
01:23:23,261 --> 01:23:25,300
had before this fight,

2919
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:27,840
they had three crazy fucking wars,

2920
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:28,120
right?

2921
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:32,950
Three wars back blasting
each other and you,

2922
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,530
how many of those can you
have really in your life?

2923
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:36,580
You know this,

2924
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,390
there's a number,

2925
01:23:37,390 --> 01:23:39,340
it might be 10 it might be seven.

2926
01:23:39,341 --> 01:23:41,950
Everybody's different
depending on when you start,

2927
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:44,770
depending on how good your defenses
you're going to get nailed.

2928
01:23:44,771 --> 01:23:45,760
You're getting your head hit,

2929
01:23:45,761 --> 01:23:46,594
you're getting your body,

2930
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,680
you've got a lot of fun problems
that among other fights,

2931
01:23:50,681 --> 01:23:51,251
training,

2932
01:23:51,251 --> 01:23:53,070
sparring sessions just,

2933
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:53,780
yeah,

2934
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:54,580
Zach,

2935
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,181
that was the point.

2936
01:23:55,181 --> 01:23:59,560
The point is what you're saying is a tiny
fraction of the actual damages head is

2937
01:23:59,561 --> 01:24:03,370
taken cause you're only seeing one fight
so you think about all the fights that

2938
01:24:03,371 --> 01:24:05,050
he's had to all the
punches that he's taken.

2939
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:07,630
It's a tremendous amount
of punishment as is.

2940
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:12,070
Then you have to factor in the fact
that that is a for action of the actual

2941
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:12,850
punishment.

2942
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:16,300
Then you start getting an idea of
what the fuck is really going on.

2943
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:17,590
When you're training for a fight,

2944
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:22,330
you have to have a number in your
head or a feeling or a time or what.

2945
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:26,170
You got to know when to fucking get
out because the more you do that shit,

2946
01:24:26,171 --> 01:24:28,000
the more one day it's
going to catch up with you.

2947
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,520
But with a guy like Pacquiao,

2948
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:32,200
it's super hard for those
guys to just go out on top.

2949
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:33,011
You know,

2950
01:24:33,011 --> 01:24:34,930
Floyd Mayweather retired
and then he came back,

2951
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:36,190
he almost went out on top.

2952
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:37,660
You almost said fuck it went out on top.

2953
01:24:38,230 --> 01:24:42,190
But I think he's probably the
most cautious of all of them.

2954
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:42,760
Floyd.

2955
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:43,100
Yeah.

2956
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:43,330
Yeah.

2957
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,400
He's the most cautious stylistically,

2958
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:45,730
you know,

2959
01:24:45,730 --> 01:24:48,970
very rarely gets hit and he
does get hit recovers very well.

2960
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,600
Like Shane Mosley was the last one to
tag him and he goes through entire fights

2961
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:54,040
where he barely gets tagged.

2962
01:24:54,041 --> 01:24:54,500
Yeah,

2963
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:54,980
yeah.

2964
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,440
Just boxes the shit out of people,

2965
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:57,130
you know?

2966
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:57,940
And I love that.

2967
01:24:57,940 --> 01:24:59,500
I love the fact that the guy's still,

2968
01:24:59,740 --> 01:25:00,430
he's like,

2969
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,660
not only is the unbeaten,

2970
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:03,470
he's really unchallenged and he's like,

2971
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:04,780
I think he's 36 now.

2972
01:25:06,260 --> 01:25:07,540
He's gotten pretty unheard of,

2973
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:08,110
you know,

2974
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:08,980
and it looks fantastic.

2975
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:10,990
His defense is so incredible.

2976
01:25:11,410 --> 01:25:12,520
Brilliant boxer.

2977
01:25:12,521 --> 01:25:13,370
He's a brilliant,

2978
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:16,200
and he probably would have box
the shit out of Manny Pacquiao,

2979
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,920
especially seeing what he did,

2980
01:25:17,921 --> 01:25:21,280
the Martinez and what I
was able to do to Martinez.

2981
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:22,120
And then what,

2982
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,630
you know,

2983
01:25:22,630 --> 01:25:23,680
the differences,

2984
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:23,980
uh,

2985
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:26,020
Martinez in Floyd wasn't even close.

2986
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,910
Floyd just outbox the shit out of him.

2987
01:25:27,970 --> 01:25:29,480
I mean he just couldn't get to him.

2988
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,150
Floyd is just too good.

2989
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,680
He's too good at positioning.

2990
01:25:32,740 --> 01:25:34,090
Amazing punches.

2991
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:36,230
He recovers well and his,

2992
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:37,064
uh,

2993
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,840
people don't realize sometimes that like,

2994
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:41,640
I mean depending on how good
whoever he's fighting at the time,

2995
01:25:41,820 --> 01:25:46,820
that a lot of times he boxes a
gloves down because he's so quick.

2996
01:25:47,370 --> 01:25:48,060
He doesn't even,

2997
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,180
he doesn't pull up his
gloves for a lot of fights.

2998
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,700
His gloves are down and
he's dipping around dance,

2999
01:25:53,710 --> 01:25:54,543
like playing with people.

3000
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:54,811
Yeah.

3001
01:25:54,811 --> 01:25:55,270
Toy.

3002
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,550
He does that shoulder roll.

3003
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:57,423
Yeah.

3004
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:02,520
Where he walks towards guys with his left
shoulder up high in his right glove by

3005
01:26:02,521 --> 01:26:05,490
his face and they don't know
what to do with that and fight.

3006
01:26:05,530 --> 01:26:05,961
He's,

3007
01:26:05,961 --> 01:26:06,741
he's so good.

3008
01:26:06,741 --> 01:26:07,100
It's pretty,

3009
01:26:07,100 --> 01:26:08,150
flexes are so good.

3010
01:26:08,151 --> 01:26:08,390
And,

3011
01:26:08,390 --> 01:26:09,860
and now that Adrian Broner Chi,

3012
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:10,790
have you seen that kid?

3013
01:26:10,980 --> 01:26:11,960
But upcoming kid.

3014
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:12,771
Oh my God,

3015
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:13,910
this kid's a monster.

3016
01:26:14,120 --> 01:26:15,200
He's like Floyd Mayweather.

3017
01:26:15,201 --> 01:26:16,490
But with more punching power.

3018
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:17,870
Same like weight class.

3019
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:20,180
He's 47 I'm not sure.

3020
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:25,710
Or it might be 35 is either
35 and struggling to make
the weight and moving up

3021
01:26:25,791 --> 01:26:28,280
to 40 or 47 whatever it is.

3022
01:26:28,281 --> 01:26:29,570
He's he's kids.

3023
01:26:29,610 --> 01:26:32,450
Dynamind he has that same style
that's high left shoulder up.

3024
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,840
Yeah.

3025
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,673
It's incredible.

3026
01:26:34,170 --> 01:26:35,570
There's some fucking shows up there.

3027
01:26:35,660 --> 01:26:37,460
No fucking lead glove for most of your,

3028
01:26:37,490 --> 01:26:38,960
like your left glove is down.

3029
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:39,680
It's crazy.

3030
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:40,340
It is crazy.

3031
01:26:40,340 --> 01:26:41,173
But the,

3032
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:45,380
they're so good at those duck and roll
counter countywide hands and you don't

3033
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:46,520
want to get clipped by that shit.

3034
01:26:46,521 --> 01:26:47,750
And then so like guys are real,

3035
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:48,531
real cautious.

3036
01:26:48,531 --> 01:26:49,010
They don't know.

3037
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:50,990
And he's so good at like slipping jabs.

3038
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,090
So good at anticipating your movement.

3039
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:58,130
The best boxers are great at leading
guys into certain directions and

3040
01:26:58,131 --> 01:26:59,810
anticipating how they respond.

3041
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:00,531
You know?

3042
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:04,220
And so like a guy like Floyd Mayweather
is not like an impulsive guy.

3043
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:06,320
He's like a guy who's
going to set traps for you.

3044
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:07,100
Right?

3045
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,020
So like he'll lead you
in certain directions.

3046
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:12,350
And see how you respond and then lead
you in that certain direction again and

3047
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:16,130
see how you respond and then set you up
for a time where he's going to lead you

3048
01:27:16,131 --> 01:27:17,000
in that certain direction.

3049
01:27:17,010 --> 01:27:17,811
He's going to stop,

3050
01:27:17,811 --> 01:27:18,590
Bang,

3051
01:27:18,590 --> 01:27:21,530
he's going to catch you because you do
a certain thing over and over again.

3052
01:27:21,530 --> 01:27:22,780
You know you do a certain thing,

3053
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:25,670
your gloves when you move off the ropes
and he's going to catch you figure it

3054
01:27:25,671 --> 01:27:28,190
out till he's got to figure
it out and that's like,

3055
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,170
that's another thing
that Anderson Silva does.

3056
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,400
Anderson Silva,

3057
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:35,090
he moves around with the guy for like
the first minute or two kind of gets a

3058
01:27:35,091 --> 01:27:35,960
sense of how he,

3059
01:27:35,961 --> 01:27:36,920
how he operates,

3060
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:40,280
how he moves faint some a little
bit and then start setting them up.

3061
01:27:40,410 --> 01:27:41,410
I started sending them out for,

3062
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:42,283
for death,

3063
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:43,250
for death.

3064
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,780
Setting them up for a dismantling.

3065
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:45,080
Yeah.

3066
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:49,280
Floyd's even his defense is so interesting
and so developed it like when you

3067
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:50,120
watch him box,

3068
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,540
sometimes you'll see him get up
against the ropes and you're like,

3069
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:54,890
oh he's,

3070
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,030
he's up against the ropes.

3071
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:57,590
This guy might take advantage of this.

3072
01:27:57,830 --> 01:28:01,050
And then Floyd somehow pulls it into his,

3073
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:04,280
like his defense becomes
his offense and you're like,

3074
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,581
oh no,

3075
01:28:04,581 --> 01:28:04,870
he's,

3076
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:06,800
he's fucking ripping this
guy upon this too good.

3077
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,050
He's so good at straight boxing.

3078
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:09,771
I mean he's,

3079
01:28:09,771 --> 01:28:10,080
it's,

3080
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:10,913
it's amazing.

3081
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:14,000
And he's a guy that's had a lot of hand
problems too that kind of broke his

3082
01:28:14,001 --> 01:28:15,560
hands several times.

3083
01:28:16,030 --> 01:28:17,740
So he goes for like the biggest cushion.

3084
01:28:17,741 --> 01:28:18,574
He has gloves.

3085
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:19,760
And because of that,

3086
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:20,594
I think there's,

3087
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:20,841
you know,

3088
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:22,220
because of his fragile hands,

3089
01:28:22,221 --> 01:28:22,730
he'd probably,

3090
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:25,580
there's a lot of guys who doesn't knock
out because of that very reason because

3091
01:28:25,581 --> 01:28:27,740
he's had like problems with
his hands over and over again.

3092
01:28:27,741 --> 01:28:29,420
But the way he knocked out,

3093
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:30,254
um,

3094
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:31,730
a homeboy from England,

3095
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:34,910
the fuck's his name
hadn't Ricky Hatton Shit.

3096
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:36,231
That was brilliant.

3097
01:28:36,231 --> 01:28:39,980
And that was what happened was in
his prime was on the animal floods.

3098
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,720
So fast box the shit out of him.

3099
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:43,190
He just boxes the shit out of guys.

3100
01:28:43,191 --> 01:28:44,180
They just can't get to them.

3101
01:28:44,210 --> 01:28:44,811
You just remind me,

3102
01:28:44,811 --> 01:28:46,640
I'm going to be in Vegas this week.

3103
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:47,481
You'll Florida,

3104

3105
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:49,370
If you want to grab dinner,

3106
01:28:49,550 --> 01:28:53,720
please bring Roger Lloyd leave
wants to be a part of team money.

3107
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,540
Okay,

3108
01:28:54,540 --> 01:28:54,930

3111
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:57,043
big fan,

3112

Tommy buttoned that up
is all about team money.

3113
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,793
Money team.

3114
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,010
I want

3115
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:02,650
to roll with you.

3116
01:29:02,650 --> 01:29:03,090
I need to know.

3117
01:29:03,090 --> 01:29:03,721
Watch dog.

3118
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:04,291
What is going on,

3119
01:29:04,291 --> 01:29:04,471
man?

3120
01:29:04,471 --> 01:29:07,190
Tom Katt Williams hit somebody in the
head with a microphone or something and

3121
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:09,850
then he punched the dude and
target and slap that guy.

3122
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:12,361
Got in a car,

3123
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:13,820
chase with the condo hour.

3124
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:14,670
Give him a fucking break.

3125
01:29:15,180 --> 01:29:18,800
Jesus Christ so sensitive
to bring back to me.

3126
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:23,660
We watched this 24 seven but
that his uncle Roger guys,

3127
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:24,540
Black Mamba,

3128
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,280
former champion himself,

3129
01:29:26,510 --> 01:29:28,690
black Roger May with the
head of vicious right hand.

3130
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:30,210
Four,

3131
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:31,043
seven.

3132
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:32,790
Miguel Cotto is still my favorite,

3133
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:33,031
right?

3134
01:29:33,031 --> 01:29:34,200
When was like,

3135
01:29:34,230 --> 01:29:36,810
I know Floyd is a supreme athlete.

3136
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,340
Great boxer and a,

3137
01:29:38,341 --> 01:29:41,090
we have to be ready for war and
they cut to Roger Mayweather.

3138
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:41,993
He goes,

3139
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:42,590
fuck

3140
01:29:42,590 --> 01:29:47,590
about Miguel Cotto [inaudible] well,

3141
01:29:49,721 --> 01:29:50,510
the level

3142
01:29:50,510 --> 01:29:55,100
of technique that Floyd has is so
above and beyond everybody else.

3143
01:29:55,101 --> 01:29:55,791
He fights that.

3144
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:56,181
He guys,

3145
01:29:56,181 --> 01:29:58,460
that kind of confidence
it made me Miguel Cotto,

3146
01:29:58,461 --> 01:30:00,650
especially during that
fight was a prime athlete.

3147
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:04,700
Margarito was the only one that ever
really fucked up Miguel Cotto when he was

3148
01:30:04,701 --> 01:30:06,320
in his prime or that stomped him.

3149
01:30:06,321 --> 01:30:10,700
And that was when Margarita was accused
of having loaded gloves because he got

3150
01:30:10,701 --> 01:30:11,181
busted.

3151
01:30:11,181 --> 01:30:12,290
And Sherry did one of his,

3152
01:30:12,291 --> 01:30:12,680
uh,

3153
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,550
subsequent fights.

3154
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:18,650
But Miguel Cotto was a bad ass
fucking boxer boxing with Floyd.

3155
01:30:18,651 --> 01:30:19,880
It's like he just,

3156
01:30:19,970 --> 01:30:21,740
he makes everybody look goofy.

3157
01:30:21,770 --> 01:30:22,910
He makes everybody look,

3158
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:27,260
they look like they just don't
really know what he's doing there.

3159
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:28,880
Don't really belong in there with him.

3160
01:30:28,881 --> 01:30:29,330
He's,

3161
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:32,120
he figured you out early enough
and now every time you step,

3162
01:30:32,121 --> 01:30:34,940
if popping a jab in your face
and there's no retaliation,

3163
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:35,780
he's not there.

3164
01:30:35,781 --> 01:30:36,051
And then,

3165
01:30:36,051 --> 01:30:36,500
you know,

3166
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:39,770
you look stupid and he's
slowly breaks you down.

3167
01:30:40,460 --> 01:30:41,360
He's just so good.

3168
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:42,651
He's a,

3169
01:30:42,651 --> 01:30:43,730
he's superb,

3170
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:44,810
superb boxer,

3171
01:30:44,811 --> 01:30:45,040
man.

3172
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,873
It's Perv athlete.

3173
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:48,230
But if I had a choice between
watching him and Anderson Silva,

3174
01:30:48,231 --> 01:30:49,064
I'd be like,

3175
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:49,983
bitch,

3176
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,880
I would way rather watch
Anderson Silva fight.

3177
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,050
It's not even a question.

3178
01:30:54,051 --> 01:30:56,270
That's one of the reasons why
I like MMA so much better.

3179
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:58,640
I like a good fight with Floyd Mayweather.

3180
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:59,030
You know,

3181
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:00,710
like if I found out for me
what was going to fight,

3182
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:01,310
um,

3183
01:31:01,310 --> 01:31:03,080
packing out before this last thing,

3184
01:31:03,081 --> 01:31:04,070
then it would be super excited.

3185
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:04,620
Sure.

3186
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:04,790
Yeah,

3187
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:05,710
that'd be he's,

3188
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:06,673
he's fighting.

3189
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:09,830
If he's fighting somebody
that I don't give a fuck.

3190
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:10,190
Yeah.

3191
01:31:10,190 --> 01:31:10,850
It's like whatever.

3192
01:31:10,850 --> 01:31:11,031
Yeah.

3193
01:31:11,031 --> 01:31:12,410
He's just going to box this guy up.

3194
01:31:12,411 --> 01:31:13,750
It'll be interesting to watch know,

3195
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:15,350
but I can watch on HBO next week.

3196
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:15,960
Sure.

3197
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:16,520
Yeah.

3198
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:16,911
What,

3199
01:31:16,911 --> 01:31:18,410
how I've asked this before,

3200
01:31:18,411 --> 01:31:21,110
but how famous is
Anderson Silva in Brazil?

3201
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:21,621
Oh,

3202
01:31:21,621 --> 01:31:26,621
it's like Michael Jordan and Michael
Jackson had a baby that it's incredible.

3203
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:29,830
He's a super,

3204
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:30,651
super superstar.

3205
01:31:30,651 --> 01:31:31,401
They love him.

3206
01:31:31,401 --> 01:31:31,611
Man.

3207
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:32,360
That's awesome.

3208
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:36,500
The cheers when he goes on
and on into the octagon,

3209
01:31:36,501 --> 01:31:38,660
when he steps up the
stairs and walks into the,

3210
01:31:38,661 --> 01:31:39,410
close the door behind them,

3211
01:31:39,410 --> 01:31:40,550
they're fucking definitely.

3212
01:31:40,551 --> 01:31:42,680
I took my headphones off and I said,

3213
01:31:42,681 --> 01:31:44,780
I go to Mike Goldberg while I
was talking to him on the ear.

3214
01:31:44,781 --> 01:31:44,961
I go,

3215
01:31:44,961 --> 01:31:45,860
take your headphones off.

3216
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:47,550
I go take your headphones off and feel us.

3217
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,790
He texts the headphones off.

3218
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:49,100
He's like,

3219
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:50,270
we're just looking at each other like,

3220
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:51,440
Whoa,

3221
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:56,060
there's 20,000 people in Rio and
they are going fucking bananas.

3222
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:00,180
And Anderson walks in and bows and
they're going fucking ape shit.

3223
01:32:00,210 --> 01:32:05,210
That's so then he goes out there and this
man told Stephan Bonner in a way that

3224
01:32:05,461 --> 01:32:07,200
doesn't even seem human.

3225
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:07,700
Yeah,

3226
01:32:07,700 --> 01:32:07,960
he,

3227
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,960
he did it like some fucking Kung Fu
movie dude who just got bolted with some

3228
01:32:12,961 --> 01:32:14,370
secret lightening power.

3229
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:17,550
He had a superpower so it
didn't even make any sense.

3230
01:32:17,551 --> 01:32:18,510
He did movie shit.

3231
01:32:18,630 --> 01:32:21,470
He stepped with his back up
against the cage and let Steph and,

3232
01:32:21,550 --> 01:32:24,780
or throw punches at him with his hands
down and just ducked and moved in front

3233
01:32:24,781 --> 01:32:27,990
of them and then through bond or the
ground and knock them unconscious with a

3234
01:32:27,991 --> 01:32:29,820
knee to the body,

3235
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,780
blasted with a needle,

3236
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:32,730
bonding this boom.

3237
01:32:32,731 --> 01:32:34,080
It goes down in a turtle position.

3238
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:34,870
Done.

3239
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:35,461
I mean he,

3240
01:32:35,461 --> 01:32:36,870
the way he did it was like,

3241
01:32:36,871 --> 01:32:37,620
it was,

3242
01:32:37,620 --> 01:32:38,880
it was superhuman.

3243
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:40,440
It was like a guy in a movie.

3244
01:32:40,441 --> 01:32:40,621
Like,

3245
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:42,570
if you saw a guy do that
and like Bourne identity,

3246
01:32:42,571 --> 01:32:43,120
black pitch,

3247
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:44,560
nobody come on back then walk out of here,

3248
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:46,590
put your back up against the wall.

3249
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,240
Nobody puts their back
up against the cage.

3250
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:48,750
Well,

3251
01:32:48,750 --> 01:32:50,430
how about the best fighter
in the fucking world?

3252
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:54,870
Does that the best guy ever put his back
up against the case to a big giant dude

3253
01:32:54,871 --> 01:32:59,850
like Stephan Bonner and weight
down from like two 30 to fight it.

3254
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:02,220
Two Oh five and Anderson fights at one 85.

3255
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,910
He's still rag dolls the Chi.

3256
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:05,190
Yeah,

3257
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,630
it's freaky.

3258
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:08,790
He's for Wiki.

3259
01:33:09,060 --> 01:33:11,630
There's nobody that freaks
me out when you watch them,

3260
01:33:11,700 --> 01:33:16,090
when you watch like the shit that they
can do to like really high level growing

3261
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:16,470
fighters,

3262
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:17,430
no one freaks me out.

3263
01:33:17,431 --> 01:33:19,650
Like Anderson Watching,

3264
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:20,160
uh,

3265
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:22,050
a rare master.

3266
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:22,920
Like you're what?

3267
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:23,161
You're like,

3268
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:25,410
you're going to get a chance to
talk about this when you get old.

3269
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:26,371
You know,

3270
01:33:26,371 --> 01:33:28,980
like there's people that will talk
about when they saw Joe Louis fight,

3271
01:33:30,720 --> 01:33:33,240
that's all well and good Anderson
Silva would've fucked up.

3272
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:34,074
Joe Lewis.

3273
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:35,070
Okay,

3274
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:35,551
listen to me.

3275
01:33:35,551 --> 01:33:36,660
I don't care what anybody says.

3276
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:40,170
Anderson Silva in an MMA
fight with fuck Joe Louis Up.

3277
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:40,590
All right.

3278
01:33:40,590 --> 01:33:42,480
You're watching something crazy.

3279
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:45,660
You're watching the baddest fighter
that's ever walked the face of the planet.

3280
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:46,591
The shit he does.

3281
01:33:46,591 --> 01:33:48,630
The guys even like really good guys.

3282
01:33:48,990 --> 01:33:49,950
It's shocking.

3283
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:52,170
Do you think he could beat
John Claude Van Damme?

3284
01:33:53,770 --> 01:33:55,080
It depends on which movie it is.

3285
01:33:55,470 --> 01:33:56,140
No.

3286
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:57,080
If it's like one,

3287
01:33:57,081 --> 01:33:58,630
I'm John Claude van dams,

3288
01:33:59,130 --> 01:34:01,170
like one of his signature movies,

3289
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:01,620
let's sport,

3290
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:01,861
you know,

3291
01:34:01,861 --> 01:34:06,861
if it's like a blood sport to vandamme
has heart that will never be able to

3292
01:34:07,651 --> 01:34:10,020
appreciate it.

3293
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:12,150
Have you ever seen him
cry and it's reality show.

3294
01:34:12,151 --> 01:34:12,880
It's amazing.

3295
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:13,110
Yeah.

3296
01:34:13,110 --> 01:34:13,943
This

3297
01:34:16,570 --> 01:34:18,120
is awesome.

3298
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,673
He's awesome.

3299
01:34:20,490 --> 01:34:23,370
He's awesome in a totally different way
than Steven Seagal is awesome as well.

3300
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:24,150
But,

3301
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,180
but John Claude van Damme was awesome
and a completely different way.

3302
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:27,991
What was the cool,

3303
01:34:27,991 --> 01:34:30,420
the movie that he came
out a year or two ago,

3304
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:31,950
what was the movie came out with?

3305
01:34:31,951 --> 01:34:33,150
It was like about,

3306
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:33,601
what do you think?

3307
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:34,111
I'm crazy.

3308
01:34:34,111 --> 01:34:35,290
You think I know what movies he's doing?

3309
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:35,420
No,

3310
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:35,571
no,

3311
01:34:35,571 --> 01:34:36,030
no.

3312
01:34:36,030 --> 01:34:39,770
This one was actually good
where he played JC Vd.

3313
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:40,180
Yeah.

3314
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:41,013
Made himself.

3315
01:34:41,130 --> 01:34:46,130
That was good that I'm blue ray
[inaudible] I never said I wasn't a fan.

3316
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:49,170
I love John Claude van Damme,

3317
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:54,500
but he's still crazy and he has
a reality show and he plays,

3318
01:34:55,411 --> 01:34:57,090
I guess I've only seen the videos,

3319
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:57,501
the internet,

3320
01:34:57,501 --> 01:34:58,730
but you could readily
get them on the Internet,

3321
01:34:58,731 --> 01:35:00,680
but it's wonderful.

3322
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:01,260
Okay.

3323
01:35:01,260 --> 01:35:02,510
He's crazy.

3324
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:02,700
Yeah.

3325
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:03,140
Okay.

3326
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:04,660
And he keeps talking about,

3327
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:05,990
I'm going to hit this fight.

3328
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,020
I'm going to have to fight one
more time for the children.

3329
01:35:09,190 --> 01:35:11,690
Like he has like crazy ideas.

3330
01:35:11,691 --> 01:35:12,081
I did,

3331
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:12,321
you know,

3332
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:13,020
they said,

3333
01:35:13,020 --> 01:35:13,853
John,

3334
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:16,160
you did a lot of cocaine and you know,

3335
01:35:16,610 --> 01:35:18,050
you know a lot of other things.

3336
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:19,370
I'm not happy about those other things,

3337
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:23,510
but I'm going to make it up with this
fight and I'm going to win but not ouch.

3338
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:27,560
And it's like so crazy and
over the like he's acting,

3339
01:35:27,790 --> 01:35:32,790
it's like this strange hybrid
between a reality show and a movie.

3340
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:37,340
And what he's doing is really strange
because he's saying he's going to have a

3341
01:35:37,341 --> 01:35:40,850
fight and he's got this guy that he keeps
dragging around with them that these

3342
01:35:40,851 --> 01:35:41,330
things happen.

3343
01:35:41,330 --> 01:35:44,000
But the promise has been doing
this for like four years.

3344
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,970
So this guy for these four years,

3345
01:35:47,030 --> 01:35:48,850
he's been saying he's going to fight like,

3346
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,600
and they pose for stare
downs for me years,

3347
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:52,670
years man.

3348
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:54,470
I mean for fucking this weird,

3349
01:35:54,471 --> 01:35:57,260
it's still going on and he's still like,

3350
01:35:57,410 --> 01:35:57,650
well,

3351
01:35:57,650 --> 01:35:58,161
you know,

3352
01:35:58,161 --> 01:36:01,870
I'm going to have this fight and I'm
going to do it for the children to show

3353
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:06,880
them you can bounce back from out of this
bullshit and this cocaine and fucking

3354
01:36:08,580 --> 01:36:09,450
wonderful.

3355
01:36:10,110 --> 01:36:10,943
Can we do that?

3356
01:36:11,540 --> 01:36:12,040
Uh,

3357
01:36:12,040 --> 01:36:12,930
that might be it.

3358
01:36:12,931 --> 01:36:13,980
That might be one of them.

3359
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,360
I mean there's a lot of them.

3360
01:36:15,361 --> 01:36:16,350
He's got a lot of them.

3361
01:36:16,351 --> 01:36:17,184
Can I do,

3362
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,080
he seems like a really nice guy.

3363
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:21,510
It seems like real friendly and you know,

3364
01:36:21,511 --> 01:36:23,430
he doesn't seem like he's
trying to be a hard ass.

3365
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:25,530
Like even when he sang like
he's going to knock it out.

3366
01:36:25,531 --> 01:36:25,800
You're like,

3367
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:26,131
oh,

3368
01:36:26,131 --> 01:36:26,401
come on,

3369
01:36:26,401 --> 01:36:27,120
give me a hug.

3370
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:27,900
Come on.

3371
01:36:27,900 --> 01:36:29,490
Get over here and give by the way,

3372
01:36:29,850 --> 01:36:31,130
cocaine man,

3373
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:33,300
you know that you said the a,

3374
01:36:33,301 --> 01:36:37,470
it's like a weird hybrid between like
reality and like I think that's the,

3375
01:36:37,650 --> 01:36:41,940
that's the new and next steps that's
going to really develop for television is

3376
01:36:41,941 --> 01:36:44,220
like shows like a duck hunters.

3377
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:49,470
The Duck Dynasty Duck Dynasty where
it's that family and they go this is the

3378
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,430
reality show.

3379
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:55,700
But it's clearly like it's produced
to well you're like there's no way.

3380
01:36:56,220 --> 01:36:57,240
Like these are real people.

3381
01:36:57,241 --> 01:36:57,631
They're not,

3382
01:36:57,631 --> 01:36:57,840
you know,

3383
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:02,840
they're not actors but like
all the moments are to well
construct like the wife

3384
01:37:03,091 --> 01:37:06,390
comes in right at the moment when the
guys are like fucking cutting a hole in

3385
01:37:06,391 --> 01:37:07,740
the ceiling and she was like Texas.

3386
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,110
It's in Louisiana.

3387
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:10,620
Yeah.

3388
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:11,370
Louisiana.

3389
01:37:11,370 --> 01:37:13,200
You done lost your redneck.

3390
01:37:15,440 --> 01:37:16,201
Oh Man.

3391
01:37:16,201 --> 01:37:17,034
You don't love.

3392
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:17,740
Yeah.

3393
01:37:17,740 --> 01:37:18,541
It's a funny show.

3394
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:19,091
Show you.

3395
01:37:19,091 --> 01:37:20,360
I lost my redneck.

3396
01:37:21,490 --> 01:37:22,323
These

3397
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:26,010
girls frog legs.

3398
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:27,330
I love that old guy.

3399
01:37:27,331 --> 01:37:28,111
The patriarchs.

3400
01:37:28,111 --> 01:37:28,944
Great in that.

3401
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:29,161
It's,

3402
01:37:29,161 --> 01:37:30,780
sorry I'm full of shit though.

3403
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:31,420
It's full of Shit.

3404
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:32,790
Have you seen swamp people?

3405
01:37:32,850 --> 01:37:33,910
No.

3406
01:37:33,911 --> 01:37:35,460
Swamp people is just,

3407
01:37:35,461 --> 01:37:37,770
they should call that
show alligator assassins.

3408
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:38,820
Okay.

3409
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,550
Cause it's just a bunch of motherfuckers
that live in Florida and kill

3410
01:37:41,551 --> 01:37:45,870
alligators and they kill
off fuck load of alligators.

3411
01:37:45,900 --> 01:37:46,381
Okay.

3412
01:37:46,381 --> 01:37:49,110
They killed like 500 of them a season.

3413
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:50,790
I went to high school
with a few of those guys.

3414
01:37:50,791 --> 01:37:52,200
I think I remember them.

3415
01:37:52,230 --> 01:37:54,120
Do they kill a lot of alligators?

3416
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:55,980
It's really to think there's that

3417
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,650
many God damn alligator's out there
and you know it's really freaky.

3418
01:37:58,651 --> 01:37:59,970
A lot of people might not like this,

3419
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:02,070
but if they weren't
killing those alligators,

3420
01:38:02,071 --> 01:38:04,860
those alligators would fuck
and make more alligators.

3421
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:07,920
And if you think of how many
fucking alligators they're killing,

3422
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:11,130
do you know what kind of an infestation
of alligators we must have in this

3423
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:11,964
country?

3424
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,470
Jesus Christ.

3425
01:38:13,480 --> 01:38:16,500
If they're killing hundreds and
hundreds of them and in Florida,

3426
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:17,730
Holy Shit,

3427
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:21,150
they have to still in the order
when the back yards all the time,

3428
01:38:21,151 --> 01:38:21,510
man,

3429
01:38:21,510 --> 01:38:22,020
all the time.

3430
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,160
When I lived in Gainesville,

3431
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:24,630
they were protected.

3432
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:25,733
You couldn't kill them.

3433
01:38:25,990 --> 01:38:26,380
Really?

3434
01:38:26,380 --> 01:38:26,640
Yeah.

3435
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:27,390
When I was a kid,

3436
01:38:27,390 --> 01:38:28,950
I lived in Florida and you know that.

3437
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:29,161
Yeah.

3438
01:38:29,161 --> 01:38:29,670
Yeah.

3439
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:32,190
I lived in Gainesville for two years.

3440
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:35,400
My Dad was going to the
University of Florida and um,

3441
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:35,911
we,

3442
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:36,210
uh,

3443
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,470
we used to go to Lake Alice.

3444
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:41,100
There's this like little lake there
and we used to feed the alligators

3445
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,060
marshmallows.

3446
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:42,970
Yeah.

3447
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:44,600
You'd flip throw marshmallows,

3448
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:44,941
the water.

3449
01:38:44,941 --> 01:38:45,241
You'd be like,

3450
01:38:45,241 --> 01:38:45,451
wow,

3451
01:38:45,451 --> 01:38:47,640
these are crazy monsters
are feeding these monsters.

3452
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:49,740
But they didn't really
fuck with people too much.

3453
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,570
They occasionally would like get a dog.

3454
01:38:51,690 --> 01:38:52,471
Like if someone would,

3455
01:38:52,471 --> 01:38:54,240
they walk their dog
too close to the water,

3456
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:55,860
didn't see the alligator.

3457
01:38:56,070 --> 01:38:57,150
Alligator can't help themselves,

3458
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:59,340
but I guess they would
feed them or something.

3459
01:38:59,341 --> 01:38:59,700
I Dunno.

3460
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:00,900
I don't know what the fuck they did.

3461
01:39:00,901 --> 01:39:03,930
They must have done something to keep
them happy if they are around people.

3462
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:07,410
But apparently it got to a certain point
where they were just so many fucking

3463
01:39:07,411 --> 01:39:07,861
alligators.

3464
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:08,500
They had to do something.

3465
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,333
Oh yeah.

3466
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,970
Every,

3467
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:10,870
I mean I used to see,

3468
01:39:10,871 --> 01:39:12,490
I went to high school
in Florida and you know,

3469
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:14,940
you would see them all the courses.

3470
01:39:14,950 --> 01:39:16,280
You see people's backyards there.

3471
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:19,060
Let people have pools and
Florida and up till people,

3472
01:39:19,061 --> 01:39:19,690
alligators.

3473
01:39:19,690 --> 01:39:20,830
I don't think it happens that often.

3474
01:39:20,950 --> 01:39:22,090
I don't think it happens that often,

3475
01:39:22,150 --> 01:39:23,080
but I mean I'm sure it has.

3476
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:23,261
I mean,

3477
01:39:23,261 --> 01:39:24,370
I'm sure there's statistics on it,

3478
01:39:24,371 --> 01:39:27,120
but I don't remember a lot
of one a year maybe sandy,

3479
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:28,090
one of those kinds of things.

3480
01:39:28,091 --> 01:39:28,600
Yeah,

3481
01:39:28,600 --> 01:39:29,381
I know people lose,

3482
01:39:29,381 --> 01:39:29,651
you know,

3483
01:39:29,651 --> 01:39:30,340
limbs and shit.

3484
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:33,770
People go to get their golf ball
and they go into a little pond.

3485
01:39:34,810 --> 01:39:35,950
You can lose a hand.

3486
01:39:38,110 --> 01:39:38,381
Fuck,

3487
01:39:38,381 --> 01:39:39,940
fuck you let that ball go.

3488
01:39:40,270 --> 01:39:41,021
What you do man?

3489
01:39:41,021 --> 01:39:41,261
Fuck,

3490
01:39:41,261 --> 01:39:41,501
fuck,

3491
01:39:41,501 --> 01:39:41,771
fuck,

3492
01:39:41,771 --> 01:39:42,200
fuck.

3493
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:43,260
Get a new title list.

3494
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:44,133
She's,

3495
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,610
we'll leave it in the water.

3496
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:47,580
Absolutely horrifying.

3497
01:39:47,980 --> 01:39:49,570
Like human flesh.

3498
01:39:49,571 --> 01:39:51,730
That's not their first crack at it.

3499
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:52,803
Like

3500
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:54,850
he'll eat a bag of shit.

3501
01:39:54,900 --> 01:39:55,690
They will.

3502
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:56,230
They will.

3503
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:56,981
They would eat people.

3504
01:39:56,981 --> 01:39:59,890
They just haven't been to
plates and tires and the shit.

3505
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:03,700
It's not their preference one way
or on road rules in Australia.

3506
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,000
We went to a crocodile farm and like
the guy that owned it was explaining how

3507
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,950
they don't really want to eat us,

3508
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:11,230
but if they're hungry
and there's nothing else,

3509
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:12,730
that's when they'll fuck with you.

3510
01:40:12,731 --> 01:40:14,620
If you're down by the fucking
swamp and you're like,

3511
01:40:14,621 --> 01:40:15,131
Oh hey,

3512
01:40:15,131 --> 01:40:15,911
what are you doing here?

3513
01:40:15,911 --> 01:40:17,100
And then it'll grab you in depth

3514
01:40:17,170 --> 01:40:17,850
roll you.

3515
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:21,100
But I think that the only reason why
they don't do is because they don't

3516
01:40:21,101 --> 01:40:22,710
recognize us as a food source.

3517
01:40:22,711 --> 01:40:25,180
It's delicious meal because
they don't usually eat us.

3518
01:40:25,181 --> 01:40:27,370
But once they recognize
us as a food source,

3519
01:40:27,371 --> 01:40:28,720
that's when it becomes a real problem.

3520
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:30,370
Like there was one they
killed in the field,

3521
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,480
the Philippines recently,

3522
01:40:31,481 --> 01:40:33,100
and it was fucking huge,

3523
01:40:33,250 --> 01:40:35,780
huge saltwater crocodile and they,

3524
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:37,180
it had killed a bunch of villagers.

3525
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:37,590
Like they didn't,

3526
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:39,910
they knew that there was
this one giant crocodile,

3527
01:40:40,020 --> 01:40:43,890
it was more than 20 fucking feet long
and it was killing people and they'd,

3528
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:45,490
so they had to go after it and go get it.

3529
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:45,760
There was,

3530
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:46,790
and there was that one that was like,

3531
01:40:47,570 --> 01:40:50,680
it wasn't in Canada one that the
movie is based on like they made up.

3532
01:40:51,310 --> 01:40:51,581
Yeah.

3533
01:40:51,581 --> 01:40:51,930
Yeah.

3534
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:53,290
W Crocodile and Canada.

3535
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:53,980
I know some

3536
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:54,281
lake,

3537
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:55,000
it was like a norm.

3538
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,760
Some of northern sitting
leg was about not a Croc,

3539
01:40:57,761 --> 01:40:58,120
maybe,

3540
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:58,953
maybe a gator.

3541
01:40:59,170 --> 01:40:59,411
Right.

3542
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:00,400
That's what the movie's about.

3543
01:41:00,401 --> 01:41:01,250
It's like a horror movie.

3544
01:41:01,251 --> 01:41:04,060
It's not Lake Michigan.

3545
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:05,290
Remember the movie like Michigan?

3546
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:07,780
Pat Plath?

3547
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,530
Was it placid that about the movie?

3548
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:13,660
That's based on a real story.

3549
01:41:14,140 --> 01:41:14,973
I swear to God,

3550
01:41:15,550 --> 01:41:16,271
I met one of the,

3551
01:41:16,271 --> 01:41:18,250
I think I met one of the writers
on that who told me that.

3552
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:19,263
Yeah,

3553
01:41:19,720 --> 01:41:20,740
I'm pretty sure man,

3554
01:41:21,140 --> 01:41:22,210
like based on,

3555
01:41:22,211 --> 01:41:23,590
I might be wrong on the location,

3556
01:41:23,770 --> 01:41:27,670
but I know it's based on
a real murdering gator.

3557
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:31,390
I think so is that right?

3558
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,740
What's the true story of
Lake placid is alligator.

3559
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:37,720
Let's go to Wiki answers.

3560
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:40,050
How beautiful is this day then?

3561
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:41,790
It's in a just do that.

3562
01:41:42,030 --> 01:41:44,170
And I know you used to have
encyclopedia Britannica.

3563
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:48,790
That shit was wack as fuck the
stories based off the 1943 mysterious

3564
01:41:48,791 --> 01:41:53,530
disappearances of 10 teenagers while
playing one night on lake placid.

3565
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:55,451
Okay.

3566
01:41:55,451 --> 01:41:55,930
So,

3567
01:41:55,930 --> 01:41:56,091
uh,

3568
01:41:56,091 --> 01:41:56,930
it's just uh,

3569
01:41:57,210 --> 01:41:57,680
okay.

3570
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,513
Just a rumor.

3571
01:41:58,660 --> 01:41:59,130
But the mood,

3572
01:41:59,130 --> 01:41:59,320
what?

3573
01:41:59,320 --> 01:41:59,891
So the movie,

3574
01:41:59,891 --> 01:42:03,340
just the movie the gate or
concept to it or something?

3575
01:42:03,350 --> 01:42:03,820
Well,

3576
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:08,050
apparently it became a legend because
it happened in 1943 and so people would

3577
01:42:08,051 --> 01:42:08,890
talk about it.

3578
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,830
And so the movie is like based on this
actual monster and it's sort of a,

3579
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,830
it's a factual short,

3580
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,760
don't send me your tweets or
your emails about how I'm wrong.

3581
01:42:18,940 --> 01:42:19,331
I'm right.

3582
01:42:19,331 --> 01:42:20,410
We just read it on the Internet.

3583
01:42:20,411 --> 01:42:21,190
Basically.

3584
01:42:21,190 --> 01:42:23,500
It's in what you said cannot be argued.

3585
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,513
There you go.

3586
01:42:24,980 --> 01:42:25,280
Yeah.

3587
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:29,400
What does a dumb ass
movie fucking alligator,

3588
01:42:30,580 --> 01:42:32,440
but I'll get it would
be freezing as deck off

3589
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:38,440
is it weighs 30 foot long man.

3590
01:42:38,441 --> 01:42:39,910
Eating crock it off.

3591
01:42:39,970 --> 01:42:44,970
Which terrorizes the fictitional
fictitional location of Black Lake Maine.

3592
01:42:45,490 --> 01:42:45,701
Oh,

3593
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:46,900
that's even more ridiculous.

3594
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:49,390
Maine's only like thought
out for like a month,

3595
01:42:49,391 --> 01:42:50,224
a year.

3596
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:53,210
So I wasn't that far off when I,

3597
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:55,150
when I said rate's pretty close.

3598
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:56,380
That's close to Maine.

3599
01:42:56,410 --> 01:42:56,681
Sure.

3600
01:42:56,681 --> 01:42:57,160
There you go.

3601
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,110
You were in that story.

3602
01:42:58,190 --> 01:42:58,780
Yeah.

3603
01:42:58,780 --> 01:43:00,400
Let me go write it down.

3604
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:03,340
That's a winter gators.

3605
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:04,500
If you think about like,

3606
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,360
like a perfect nightmare
that's chasing after you,

3607
01:43:07,720 --> 01:43:08,860
it's a giant reptile,

3608
01:43:08,861 --> 01:43:09,450
right?

3609
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:13,300
Because there's so emotionless
and conti and just,

3610
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,190
they don't,

3611
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:15,100
they don't give a fuck.

3612
01:43:15,110 --> 01:43:15,811
That's a dinosaur.

3613
01:43:15,811 --> 01:43:15,970
Yeah.

3614
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:16,803
It's like a,

3615
01:43:16,850 --> 01:43:17,960
it's just an extension of,

3616
01:43:17,961 --> 01:43:18,700
uh,

3617
01:43:18,700 --> 01:43:20,150
the like a t rex chasing you.

3618
01:43:20,151 --> 01:43:24,850
It's an animal that has virtually
not changed for 200 million years.

3619
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:27,760
They existed in this form
200 million years ago.

3620
01:43:27,761 --> 01:43:28,650
What the fuck,

3621
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:29,493
man?

3622
01:43:29,510 --> 01:43:32,640
They're all muscle muscle in the,

3623
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:33,550
they're just like the,

3624
01:43:33,551 --> 01:43:36,880
the cleaning systems of ecosystems.

3625
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:38,410
They're like the cleaners.

3626
01:43:38,411 --> 01:43:39,940
They come in and anything that's limping,

3627
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:40,450
you'd done.

3628
01:43:40,450 --> 01:43:41,283
Song

3629
01:43:45,050 --> 01:43:47,290
goes and tries to get water
out of the wrong spot.

3630
01:43:47,291 --> 01:43:47,861
Slam,

3631
01:43:47,861 --> 01:43:49,060
keep the population down.

3632
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:50,201
Boom.

3633
01:43:50,201 --> 01:43:51,830
We're trying to cross this river and not,

3634
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:53,620
yeah.

3635
01:43:53,620 --> 01:43:56,660
You ever see those river crossings
for those ones in io crocodiles?

3636
01:43:56,661 --> 01:43:57,170
Yeah.

3637
01:43:57,170 --> 01:44:02,170
Step up and just huge dinosaur jaws
clamped down on Willdabeast and drag them

3638
01:44:02,571 --> 01:44:03,210
underwater.

3639
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:03,481
You're like,

3640
01:44:03,481 --> 01:44:03,770
well,

3641
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:05,570
what is the going on here?

3642
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:08,870
I always fix a system that's
set up totally a life system.

3643
01:44:08,871 --> 01:44:09,740
Life and death.

3644
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:12,350
There is a population
control mechanism in effect,

3645
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,660
big cats and alligators.

3646
01:44:14,860 --> 01:44:15,151
Does it,

3647
01:44:15,151 --> 01:44:15,381
I mean,

3648
01:44:15,381 --> 01:44:15,921
crocodiles,

3649
01:44:15,921 --> 01:44:18,800
is it any coincidence that's the
place where this is the most gazelles?

3650
01:44:18,910 --> 01:44:19,460
Oh yeah.

3651
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:21,250
Fucking things are
running around everywhere.

3652
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:22,730
Everything's running around everywhere.

3653
01:44:22,750 --> 01:44:24,200
Willdabeast and all these things.

3654
01:44:24,410 --> 01:44:27,830
You just giant things trying to eat
and we keep their populations down.

3655
01:44:28,190 --> 01:44:29,240
The thing at the footage,

3656
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,310
the footage of that is always the same.

3657
01:44:31,311 --> 01:44:32,120
If you watch those,

3658
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,810
those uh,

3659
01:44:32,810 --> 01:44:34,760
like a nat Geo shows,

3660
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:38,300
they'll be like these 50 gazelles
crossing the river and you're like,

3661
01:44:38,310 --> 01:44:39,143
yeah.

3662
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:43,060
And then like three seconds
go by and you're like,

3663
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:43,271
oh,

3664
01:44:43,271 --> 01:44:44,920
there's one that's not with the pack.

3665
01:44:44,930 --> 01:44:46,660
I think we should watch him for a second.

3666
01:44:47,110 --> 01:44:48,940
And then you watch him kind of limping,

3667
01:44:48,970 --> 01:44:53,960
tentatively crossed the creek and that
crop comes up is like fucking over it.

3668
01:44:54,710 --> 01:44:56,360
There's such machines,

3669
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:59,480
they're so terrified and they can
be under that water for hours.

3670
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:01,460
They don't have to breathe for hours.

3671
01:45:01,550 --> 01:45:06,200
So they sit under the water waiting for
someone to come by and then the bars all

3672
01:45:06,201 --> 01:45:07,490
fucking murky and shit.

3673
01:45:07,491 --> 01:45:11,510
You can't see that big dinosaur
waiting there to eat babies.

3674
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:12,250
Oh Man.

3675
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:13,490
That monster.

3676
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:17,520
And how perfectly designed as
where when you see you terrifying

3677
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:19,720
footage of his eyes just out of the water.

3678
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:22,390
So it's just up like just the water.

3679
01:45:22,630 --> 01:45:23,231
Horrific,

3680
01:45:23,231 --> 01:45:24,220
horrific monster.

3681
01:45:24,790 --> 01:45:25,300
I remember,

3682
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:25,481
okay,

3683
01:45:25,481 --> 01:45:26,590
this is gonna Sound really lame,

3684
01:45:26,591 --> 01:45:27,290
but unreal.

3685
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:28,123
Sros,

3686
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:29,051
I had to,

3687
01:45:29,051 --> 01:45:29,650
um,

3688
01:45:29,650 --> 01:45:32,020
we had to put a bag
over a crocodile's head.

3689
01:45:32,110 --> 01:45:32,771
Oh my God.

3690
01:45:32,771 --> 01:45:33,231
So you have to,

3691
01:45:33,231 --> 01:45:34,270
at first you have to clamp,

3692
01:45:34,271 --> 01:45:38,320
it's Josh shut and then duct tape it and
then you put a bag on his head and then

3693
01:45:38,321 --> 01:45:39,070
you step you,

3694
01:45:39,070 --> 01:45:39,851
you sit on it,

3695
01:45:39,851 --> 01:45:41,620
you have to sit on it to hold it still.

3696
01:45:41,621 --> 01:45:42,910
And that's how we would transport it.

3697
01:45:42,911 --> 01:45:45,040
Like for one of the mission I was,

3698
01:45:45,041 --> 01:45:45,551
so this guy,

3699
01:45:45,551 --> 01:45:46,630
key flaw on the show,

3700
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:51,130
you had a pole and he was trying to rope
the crocodiles neck and the crocodile

3701
01:45:51,131 --> 01:45:52,630
went into a death roll.

3702
01:45:52,690 --> 01:45:53,280
Oh Geez.

3703
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:58,250
And his shirt got caught in the poll twist
around his arm and it was cutting off

3704
01:45:58,270 --> 01:46:00,790
the circulation and everybody was like,

3705
01:46:00,791 --> 01:46:01,890
oh fuck.

3706
01:46:01,900 --> 01:46:03,790
Like when that really
happens on a reality show,

3707
01:46:03,791 --> 01:46:04,840
like you don't know what to do.

3708
01:46:04,841 --> 01:46:05,890
So he was just screaming,

3709
01:46:05,891 --> 01:46:06,724
cut the shirt,

3710
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:07,583
got the shirt,

3711
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,833
got that fuck.

3712
01:46:09,460 --> 01:46:09,851
And I'm like,

3713
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:10,180
we don't,

3714
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:11,740
there's no scissors in the outback.

3715
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:14,440
Like somebody had to rummage
through their sound kit or whatever.

3716
01:46:14,441 --> 01:46:15,690
And we were standing still spinning.

3717
01:46:15,691 --> 01:46:18,180
Spinning is when it ended up
a big as a solopreneur I was,

3718
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,480
it was medium size,

3719
01:46:19,481 --> 01:46:21,460
10 to 15 feet long.

3720
01:46:22,340 --> 01:46:23,173
Teenager,

3721
01:46:23,380 --> 01:46:26,440
it was its teeth clamped down on a shirt.

3722
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:26,710
Yeah.

3723
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:29,860
So you clamp the jaw shut
and then somebody duct tapes,

3724
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:31,223
the jaws together,

3725
01:46:31,610 --> 01:46:32,770
he got a hold of the teeth.

3726
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:33,731
So no,

3727
01:46:33,731 --> 01:46:34,180
so,

3728
01:46:34,180 --> 01:46:36,850
so the next part is you have to
just put something around its neck.

3729
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:40,350
So Keith Lowe was using a poll
with the rope at the end of it,

3730
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:41,320
like a loop road.

3731
01:46:41,560 --> 01:46:42,670
So they loop it that,

3732
01:46:42,680 --> 01:46:42,881
right,

3733
01:46:42,881 --> 01:46:43,030
right,

3734
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:43,181
right.

3735
01:46:43,181 --> 01:46:43,841
So he did it in,

3736
01:46:43,841 --> 01:46:48,190
somehow this crocodile like got
latched onto maybe in this job,

3737
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:48,790
the rope,

3738
01:46:48,790 --> 01:46:49,360
the,

3739
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,200
and he just started

3740
01:46:50,200 --> 01:46:51,033
death rolling.

3741
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:51,903
Oh Wow.

3742
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:56,800
It got the polo shirt on his
sleeve and then tighten the sleeve.

3743
01:46:57,100 --> 01:46:58,750
So we had to cut the shirt off of him.

3744
01:46:59,600 --> 01:47:00,820
Got To wear spandex.

3745
01:47:00,821 --> 01:47:01,770
When you fucking with Crocker,

3746
01:47:02,470 --> 01:47:03,191
very important.

3747
01:47:03,191 --> 01:47:04,270
It'd be all tucked up,

3748
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:06,010
tucked up and ready to sprint

3749
01:47:08,290 --> 01:47:09,130
cleats as well.

3750
01:47:09,131 --> 01:47:09,990
You don't want to be slipping.

3751
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:12,880
Jesus Christ dangerous.

3752
01:47:12,910 --> 01:47:14,560
They found Nile crocodiles in Florida.

3753
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:19,320
You heard that they have a shoot to kill
order on Nile crocodiles in Florida if

3754
01:47:19,330 --> 01:47:22,630
they spotted a couple of them so
people transport it in Nile crying.

3755
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:26,980
Jesus fucking assholes.

3756
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:29,830
That was probably some dude who's
trying to guard his cocaine.

3757
01:47:29,831 --> 01:47:30,470
I know what I'm gonna do.

3758
01:47:30,470 --> 01:47:31,303
Mine.

3759
01:47:31,480 --> 01:47:33,810
I'm going to have any fucking
more with [inaudible].

3760
01:47:33,870 --> 01:47:36,070
It was 28 foot long.

3761
01:47:36,071 --> 01:47:37,600
Edo either motherfucker,

3762
01:47:39,300 --> 01:47:42,330
Joe gonna fuck some Colombian.

3763
01:47:42,331 --> 01:47:43,164
Definitely.

3764
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,920
Well didn't those dudes back in like the
Miami vice days didn't like those dudes

3765
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:48,754
like kind of like,

3766
01:47:48,820 --> 01:47:50,980
like leopards in their backyard.

3767
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:52,891
Yeah,

3768
01:47:52,891 --> 01:47:53,530
those guys.

3769
01:47:53,530 --> 01:47:58,530
[inaudible] alligator,

3770
01:47:59,550 --> 01:47:59,910
some,

3771
01:47:59,910 --> 01:48:03,270
some sort of a that's right.

3772
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:04,800
It was chained up on his boat.

3773
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:06,750
That's what I'm talking about.

3774
01:48:06,751 --> 01:48:07,441
During that dude,

3775
01:48:07,441 --> 01:48:08,300
that was the Douchey

3776
01:48:10,940 --> 01:48:12,720
era in all of humanity.

3777
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:16,440
He's the eighties cocaine
days of Miami's Douchey.

3778
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,670
His era of all time,

3779
01:48:17,790 --> 01:48:19,530
everybody wanted to have a pet tiger.

3780
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:21,360
He'd go over to this guy's house.

3781
01:48:21,361 --> 01:48:23,680
He's got fucking peacocks
walking on his front lawn.

3782
01:48:23,870 --> 01:48:25,500
What's happening here and then,

3783
01:48:25,501 --> 01:48:25,731
you know,

3784
01:48:25,731 --> 01:48:28,120
all my shit is my python collection.

3785
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:30,600
What we do is we grow them
to about 10 feet long.

3786
01:48:30,610 --> 01:48:33,810
I just take him by the everglades mean
you can't control him after eight 10 feet

3787
01:48:33,811 --> 01:48:35,460
long but I just get a
new one and you know,

3788
01:48:35,461 --> 01:48:36,200
start from scratch,

3789
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,033
retrained

3790
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:43,830
pythons that he fucking of pythons
out there long and same dude who has

3791
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:47,430
grit and aids and I got a hundred
grenades and the living rooms.

3792
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:50,990
I got rocket launches on the Mac
couch but I don't tend to use it.

3793
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,050
Why do you have it if you
want to blow through a wall,

3794
01:48:55,051 --> 01:48:56,250
you know there's a wall in your way.

3795
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:58,290
That's why I got to Puma.

3796
01:48:59,970 --> 01:49:00,803
My weight room,

3797
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:04,030
I've got a Puma that I keep there for
inspiration sometimes I don't think him,

3798
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:04,861
he'd get real hungry.

3799
01:49:04,861 --> 01:49:05,960
I'd be lifting weights right next.

3800
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:09,270
I got some wolf color.

3801
01:49:09,740 --> 01:49:13,220
It's just the fact that he eyeballing
me knowing that I look delicious and

3802
01:49:13,221 --> 01:49:16,430
nutritious and he's starving to death
and they made me do more squats.

3803
01:49:17,180 --> 01:49:18,013
I can't make me

3804
01:49:19,060 --> 01:49:21,210
walkup paper plates with
diamonds on them and shit.

3805
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:22,021
That shit.

3806
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:22,651
In New York City,

3807
01:49:22,651 --> 01:49:26,610
I saw a reality show or someone they would
buy like baby crocodiles and shit and

3808
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:27,630
keep them in the bathtub.

3809
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:27,820
Yeah,

3810
01:49:27,820 --> 01:49:28,750
well people do that.

3811
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:30,520
There was a guy who got a cool guy,

3812
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:31,463
I think it was,

3813
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:33,930
it was either Brooklyn or the Bronx,

3814
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:37,960
but he got mauled by a tiger that
he had as a pet in and apart.

3815
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:39,481
Oh,

3816
01:49:39,481 --> 01:49:40,314
you do?

3817
01:49:40,650 --> 01:49:40,801
Well,

3818
01:49:40,801 --> 01:49:41,940
I don't want to give up your bed.

3819
01:49:41,970 --> 01:49:42,590
No ma'am.

3820
01:49:42,590 --> 01:49:42,800
No,

3821
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:43,360
it's just funny.

3822
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,193
I the old one.

3823
01:49:44,950 --> 01:49:46,610
It's an old joke that,

3824
01:49:47,070 --> 01:49:48,400
not that I mean hit it buddy.

3825
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:49,263
No,

3826
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:50,830
I'll do it if you tell me the way

3827
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:53,860
I talk about another guy.

3828
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:54,753
I uh,

3829
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:56,260
I talked about the guy,

3830
01:49:56,350 --> 01:49:57,040
um,

3831
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:57,873
what's it called?

3832
01:49:58,030 --> 01:49:58,863
Um,

3833
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:00,130
uh,

3834
01:50:00,130 --> 01:50:02,770
that had the animals at his
house and he released them,

3835
01:50:02,830 --> 01:50:03,160
you know,

3836
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:04,550
Remember Ohio?

3837
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:05,141
Yeah,

3838
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:06,090
I have a bit about that.

3839
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:08,320
That's on my plug plugging it or anything.

3840
01:50:08,321 --> 01:50:09,400
But yeah,

3841
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:09,641
he did.

3842
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:10,150
He Ke,

3843
01:50:10,150 --> 01:50:11,110
he killed him.

3844
01:50:11,140 --> 01:50:11,351
Well,

3845
01:50:11,351 --> 01:50:12,610
he cut up,

3846
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,050
he released them all right.

3847
01:50:14,051 --> 01:50:18,130
And then I believe he cut up like some
chickens and like poured the blood all

3848
01:50:18,131 --> 01:50:20,770
over himself and with dead animals on him.

3849
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:21,131
Right.

3850
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:21,850
And then like,

3851
01:50:21,850 --> 01:50:22,121
you know,

3852
01:50:22,121 --> 01:50:23,770
he had lions and shit and he released.

3853
01:50:23,771 --> 01:50:24,340
So he got,

3854
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:25,840
he got fucked up by everything.

3855
01:50:25,841 --> 01:50:28,990
I think he might've been
dead before they got to him,

3856
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:31,780
but they eventually like animals
a pull in his dead body apart.

3857
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:32,673
Oh,

3858
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:33,461
easy way to go.

3859
01:50:33,461 --> 01:50:34,820
I've never heard that before.

3860
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:35,260
Oh,

3861
01:50:35,260 --> 01:50:35,690
that's a,

3862
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:37,210
that's a dude who really loves animals.

3863
01:50:37,211 --> 01:50:37,510
Yeah.

3864
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:37,940
Right.

3865
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:38,773
Yeah.

3866
01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:40,630
Our system was silly.

3867
01:50:40,631 --> 01:50:41,410
Fuck yeah.

3868
01:50:41,410 --> 01:50:41,800
Yeah.

3869
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:42,041
Well,

3870
01:50:42,041 --> 01:50:42,631
you know the,

3871
01:50:42,631 --> 01:50:43,160
the whole

3872
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:44,920
zoo life is really a,

3873
01:50:45,680 --> 01:50:46,041
it's a,

3874
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:49,700
it's a crazy torture that we do so that
we can look at animals in real life

3875
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,600
because they don't even allow them to
live a natural life while in captivity.

3876
01:50:53,630 --> 01:50:57,380
It's one thing if we had them in an
ecosystem that was similar to their own,

3877
01:50:57,500 --> 01:50:59,470
so we put them in these containment areas,

3878
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,760
then we let loose antelope.

3879
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:03,140
So whatever the fuck it is that they
get to run and chase down and kill

3880
01:51:03,290 --> 01:51:05,460
[inaudible] that was the case.

3881
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:09,350
I think that that would at least be
like rewarding life and these cats,

3882
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:13,460
when you keep pushing that meat out to
them and they don't get any sort of chase

3883
01:51:13,461 --> 01:51:15,260
reward thing going on,

3884
01:51:15,440 --> 01:51:17,360
we see like the play with each other.

3885
01:51:17,361 --> 01:51:20,780
Like they want to chase things like it's
a part of the whole dynamics of their

3886
01:51:20,781 --> 01:51:21,614
organism,

3887
01:51:21,830 --> 01:51:24,410
like their design to chase and kill Shit.

3888
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:29,440
They're designed to kill all the shit and
so you put them in this cage just like

3889
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:33,920
jolting their brain like they never get
a chance to express what they were put

3890
01:51:33,921 --> 01:51:35,000
on earth to do.

3891
01:51:35,210 --> 01:51:38,480
It sounds fucked up but it's depressing
but you mean what are you going to do?

3892
01:51:38,510 --> 01:51:41,900
You're going to stop the gazelles from
breeding and you're going to control the

3893
01:51:41,901 --> 01:51:42,191
gazelle,

3894
01:51:42,191 --> 01:51:42,651
but I can put,

3895
01:51:42,651 --> 01:51:44,540
put a few fucking gazelles
in the cage with them.

3896
01:51:44,630 --> 01:51:45,230
Okay.

3897
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:46,063
Just let them know

3898
01:51:46,430 --> 01:51:47,810
we don't need to watch it.

3899
01:51:47,811 --> 01:51:48,770
I'll pay extra.

3900
01:51:49,610 --> 01:51:50,230
Here's the team.

3901
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:50,981
What's the difference?

3902
01:51:50,981 --> 01:51:53,890
God it between the meat that you're giving
them because you're giving them meet

3903
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:54,130
you.

3904
01:51:54,130 --> 01:51:56,890
Someone's killing an animal and
someone's giving him that mean.

3905
01:51:56,980 --> 01:51:58,240
Why can't he do that?

3906
01:51:58,390 --> 01:51:59,620
Because you know he wants to,

3907
01:51:59,800 --> 01:52:00,370
yeah,

3908
01:52:00,370 --> 01:52:01,510
well someone else is killing it.

3909
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:02,920
It's not like you're saving an animal,

3910
01:52:02,921 --> 01:52:05,860
someone else's killing a fucking
animal and you're cutting.

3911
01:52:05,861 --> 01:52:06,160
Yeah.

3912
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:07,720
I mean you're sliding under the track.

3913
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:12,960
Why not just let a cow loose and let
them that don't go out and talk about

3914
01:52:13,030 --> 01:52:15,070
driving revenue like,

3915
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,260
because they're like,

3916
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:16,860
hey,

3917
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:19,000
it's an extra 70 to watch.

3918
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:20,240
Here you go.

3919
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:20,500
You know,

3920
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,830
that's what they do in Asia,

3921
01:52:22,230 --> 01:52:23,890
in Asia and they feed tigers.

3922
01:52:23,980 --> 01:52:25,300
They released goats.

3923
01:52:25,770 --> 01:52:26,180
Brian,

3924
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:26,460
Brian,

3925
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:27,730
Paul pornos videos up.

3926
01:52:27,970 --> 01:52:29,410
You ready to freak the fuck out?

3927
01:52:29,420 --> 01:52:30,120
Yes.

3928
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:30,670
Yes.

3929
01:52:30,670 --> 01:52:31,720
This is like a common thing

3930
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:32,091
theme.

3931
01:52:32,091 --> 01:52:33,420
Apparently in Asia they,

3932
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:33,980
they,

3933
01:52:33,980 --> 01:52:35,000
when they have tigers,

3934
01:52:35,150 --> 01:52:38,630
they just have this big dump truck and
they have the dump truck with a couple of

3935
01:52:38,631 --> 01:52:39,550
fucking goats in it and yeah.

3936
01:52:42,870 --> 01:52:44,550
And the goat doesn't know
what the fuck is going on.

3937
01:52:44,551 --> 01:52:45,384
But the,

3938
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:46,523
do

3939
01:52:46,590 --> 01:52:46,891
you know why?

3940
01:52:46,891 --> 01:52:49,530
Because a new goat gets dropped
off like that every day.

3941
01:52:49,610 --> 01:52:49,741
Yeah.

3942
01:52:49,741 --> 01:52:53,550
So the Tigers like stand there and stare
while this thing backs up and beeps and

3943
01:52:53,551 --> 01:52:55,560
they just wait and they
get real close to it.

3944
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:56,910
And as soon as this thing opens,

3945
01:52:57,090 --> 01:52:58,980
the goat dumps out and boom,

3946
01:52:58,981 --> 01:53:00,000
they jump on a three,

3947
01:53:00,001 --> 01:53:00,900
four minute time,

3948
01:53:00,901 --> 01:53:04,920
rip it apart into shreds in a matter
of seconds and they run away with like,

3949
01:53:04,930 --> 01:53:05,970
one's got head,

3950
01:53:06,120 --> 01:53:07,320
one's got a leg.

3951
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:08,581
I love this.

3952
01:53:08,581 --> 01:53:09,414
You find any,

3953
01:53:09,910 --> 01:53:11,310
that's what they're supposed to do.

3954
01:53:11,430 --> 01:53:11,641
Wait,

3955
01:53:11,641 --> 01:53:12,450
do you see this shit?

3956
01:53:12,450 --> 01:53:14,190
Because this is a weird thing to see,

3957
01:53:14,370 --> 01:53:15,990
but this is what they want to do.

3958
01:53:16,220 --> 01:53:16,590
Okay.

3959
01:53:16,590 --> 01:53:17,670
I mean if you're going to kill that,

3960
01:53:17,671 --> 01:53:18,271
go to anyway.

3961
01:53:18,271 --> 01:53:18,981
If you're going to feed him,

3962
01:53:18,981 --> 01:53:19,814
go.

3963
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:20,090
Why?

3964
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:21,120
Why we need to do that.

3965
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:22,650
Because then at least,

3966
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,960
I mean it's still fucked
up that you're got them.

3967
01:53:25,020 --> 01:53:26,550
You've got them contained like that,

3968
01:53:26,580 --> 01:53:27,540
but it leaves.

3969
01:53:27,541 --> 01:53:29,880
Then they get to live a tiger's life.

3970
01:53:30,240 --> 01:53:33,690
I feel like the only reason we don't get
that it's because of like some type of

3971
01:53:33,691 --> 01:53:36,960
animal rights organizations here that
don't really exist in other parts of the

3972
01:53:36,961 --> 01:53:38,160
world about what I'm saying.

3973
01:53:38,430 --> 01:53:43,430
I think our own lives for a lot of
people are so fucking suppressive and

3974
01:53:43,501 --> 01:53:47,520
ridiculous and restrained that we don't
give a fuck about that stupid elephant.

3975
01:53:47,820 --> 01:53:48,331
Tough Shit,

3976
01:53:48,331 --> 01:53:48,810
bitch.

3977
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:49,620
Yeah.

3978
01:53:49,620 --> 01:53:50,191
Take your cage.

3979
01:53:50,191 --> 01:53:51,070
I don't like my cubicle.

3980
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:52,380
Right.

3981
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:53,213
Here's one.

3982
01:53:53,490 --> 01:53:54,100
Look at this.

3983
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:54,710
Alright.

3984
01:53:54,710 --> 01:53:56,760
They just sitting there
watching and waiting.

3985
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:58,320
These are lions.

3986
01:53:59,030 --> 01:54:00,570
This is a different lab,

3987
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:01,523
but a they do.

3988
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:02,040
Yes.

3989
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:02,331
They do.

3990
01:54:02,331 --> 01:54:03,164
It lives too,

3991
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:07,200
so they just sit around and
they lift up this dump truck.

3992
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:10,410
They're opening the door right
now and the lines are just,

3993
01:54:10,710 --> 01:54:12,410
they're just hovering
right in front of it.

3994
01:54:12,970 --> 01:54:13,803
Erica,

3995
01:54:17,320 --> 01:54:18,970
this guy's talking is that beep?

3996
01:54:18,971 --> 01:54:19,750
Is this Guy Hockey?

3997
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:20,583
His Horn?

3998
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:23,890
He's trying to control the
lines by honking his horn.

3999
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:24,211
It hasn't.

4000
01:54:24,211 --> 01:54:26,530
If we're in this and you're hogtied,

4001
01:54:26,580 --> 01:54:29,790
this horn ain't doing shit to
these lines because they know.

4002
01:54:29,791 --> 01:54:30,624
Here it comes.

4003
01:54:31,180 --> 01:54:32,013
Yup.

4004
01:54:32,420 --> 01:54:34,310
Now the guy's going to lift it up.

4005
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:36,770
It's really going high now and
the things going to drop out.

4006
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:40,360
Why is he haunting with the horns?

4007
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:41,100
Some of the best.

4008
01:54:41,100 --> 01:54:42,240
Maybe he's got his dick out.

4009
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:45,950
Hey,

4010
01:54:45,950 --> 01:54:46,441
we'll do it here.

4011
01:54:46,441 --> 01:54:47,191
He pulled it out of it.

4012
01:54:47,191 --> 01:54:48,024
There it is.

4013
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:50,521
Oh my God.

4014
01:54:50,521 --> 01:54:51,240
That's it.

4015
01:54:51,240 --> 01:54:52,680
They just latch onto it.

4016
01:54:52,730 --> 01:54:52,981
I guess.

4017
01:54:52,981 --> 01:54:54,660
Toy Rip it to shreds.

4018
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,513
Yep.

4019
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:56,431
Look at it.

4020
01:54:56,431 --> 01:54:57,480
They're all playing tug of war.

4021
01:54:57,481 --> 01:55:01,540
There's like nine lines and then another
one tries to get in this one pot at him

4022
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,060
seeing that one's pawn at them.

4023
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:03,781
I don't hear it.

4024
01:55:03,781 --> 01:55:04,730
I don't hear her crying anymore.

4025
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:05,603
What happened?

4026
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:08,203
She's like guys,

4027
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:09,081
no.

4028
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:09,470
I think,

4029
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:10,303
look at that.

4030
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:11,443
God dammit.

4031
01:55:12,750 --> 01:55:13,420
Oh,

4032
01:55:13,420 --> 01:55:14,460
people are screaming.

4033
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:16,293
That is awesome.

4034
01:55:20,190 --> 01:55:21,550
I pay a lot to see that

4035
01:55:27,770 --> 01:55:29,330
a seven year old.

4036
01:55:29,650 --> 01:55:29,940
Okay.

4037
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:31,760
You do not want to fuck that shit

4038
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:34,580
girl or a boy if that's a girl.

4039
01:55:34,581 --> 01:55:35,720
You do not want to fire ground.

4040
01:55:35,870 --> 01:55:36,561
If that's a boy,

4041
01:55:36,561 --> 01:55:37,550
he needs to be monitored.

4042
01:55:38,130 --> 01:55:39,090
It needs to be monitored.

4043
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:40,160
Like that piece that Josh,

4044
01:55:40,310 --> 01:55:41,810
Oh these are,

4045
01:55:41,811 --> 01:55:42,561
these are impressive,

4046
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:43,394
but these are lions.

4047
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:44,770
If you could find tigers,

4048
01:55:44,771 --> 01:55:45,071
Brian,

4049
01:55:45,071 --> 01:55:45,970
see if we can find tigers.

4050
01:55:45,971 --> 01:55:48,610
Cause the tiger video that
I saw is way more quick,

4051
01:55:48,790 --> 01:55:49,460
way more quicker,

4052
01:55:49,460 --> 01:55:54,460
were a kid was spying on
the Roche's see more humane.

4053
01:55:54,521 --> 01:55:55,001
Oddly,

4054
01:55:55,001 --> 01:55:56,880
when you're feeding these wild animals,

4055
01:55:56,881 --> 01:55:59,940
it's totally more than to
be in their element to be,

4056
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:00,730
that's your nature.

4057
01:56:00,730 --> 01:56:01,570
That's what they're supposed to be.

4058
01:56:01,571 --> 01:56:02,110
No,

4059
01:56:02,110 --> 01:56:02,370
we've,

4060
01:56:02,370 --> 01:56:03,203
we've already,

4061
01:56:03,730 --> 01:56:06,730
I think that weighs ridiculous
where the slow dump truck,

4062
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:10,190
but there should be a gate and you
should let a couple of them out in the

4063
01:56:10,190 --> 01:56:10,210
morning.

4064
01:56:10,210 --> 01:56:10,490
Yeah.

4065
01:56:10,490 --> 01:56:11,323
What are the fucking,

4066
01:56:12,170 --> 01:56:15,490
I think the footage I saw what time
was from the Baghdad zoo was like that

4067
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:16,390
terrible way to die.

4068
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:19,360
Someone's honking their horns and all
sudden they're playing tug of war with

4069
01:56:19,361 --> 01:56:19,901
your body.

4070
01:56:19,901 --> 01:56:23,350
Just ripping parts of your
body with these monsters,

4071
01:56:23,351 --> 01:56:28,351
jaws and teeth that penetrate flash had
just pulling you apart literally for

4072
01:56:28,451 --> 01:56:28,661
your,

4073
01:56:28,661 --> 01:56:29,710
for your sustenance,

4074
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:30,970
for your flesh.

4075
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:32,613
What else?

4076
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:34,330
Suck world.

4077
01:56:34,331 --> 01:56:36,790
The world of the jungle
is like God the world.

4078
01:56:36,791 --> 01:56:39,340
The jungle was a
motherfucker is another one.

4079
01:56:40,330 --> 01:56:41,590
This guy's had this again,

4080
01:56:41,591 --> 01:56:42,424
same st

4081
01:56:43,570 --> 01:56:47,120
ty would Saiger look how much
bigger the Tigers lions again,

4082
01:56:47,121 --> 01:56:48,100
a motherfucker would a horn.

4083
01:56:48,650 --> 01:56:49,790
This is like sport for them,

4084
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:50,901
I guess.

4085
01:56:50,901 --> 01:56:52,160
They don't want to climb inside.

4086
01:56:52,161 --> 01:56:52,994
There it is.

4087
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:54,081
Check this out.

4088
01:56:54,081 --> 01:56:54,470
It's like,

4089
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:55,303
Hey,

4090
01:56:55,310 --> 01:56:56,143
look at this.

4091
01:56:56,660 --> 01:56:57,493
Boom.

4092
01:57:01,360 --> 01:57:02,420
Oh my God,

4093
01:57:03,640 --> 01:57:04,630
listen to that thing that

4094
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:10,791
he's decided he's,

4095
01:57:10,791 --> 01:57:11,624
he's killing it now,

4096
01:57:11,630 --> 01:57:13,580
so he's just getting a
how the neck look at that.

4097
01:57:13,610 --> 01:57:14,060
That's it.

4098
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:15,200
He broke the neck and killed it.

4099
01:57:15,590 --> 01:57:17,090
Look how quick he killed that thing,

4100
01:57:17,091 --> 01:57:17,301
man.

4101
01:57:17,301 --> 01:57:18,380
That's a cow.

4102
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:20,000
He killed no,

4103
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,591
that cow.

4104
01:57:20,591 --> 01:57:22,550
Like instantly use jaws.

4105
01:57:22,640 --> 01:57:23,510
He just took it,

4106
01:57:23,511 --> 01:57:24,940
snapped it and killed it.

4107
01:57:24,941 --> 01:57:26,180
It didn't look like it
took a lot of effort,

4108
01:57:26,760 --> 01:57:29,780
was kind of looked like he was paying
up a cup to have a sip out of it.

4109
01:57:29,781 --> 01:57:30,471
That was a cow.

4110
01:57:30,471 --> 01:57:32,510
And I've seen him like the goat ones,

4111
01:57:32,511 --> 01:57:35,470
the most fucked up one because they
just tear them apart and run away with

4112
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:36,393
pieces.

4113
01:57:36,630 --> 01:57:37,440
Ooh,

4114
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:38,273
Ooh,

4115
01:57:39,650 --> 01:57:40,483
Ooh,

4116
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:41,830
wow.

4117
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:43,100
Way to go for that goat.

4118
01:57:43,690 --> 01:57:44,600
But if you're a goat,

4119
01:57:44,630 --> 01:57:46,460
you gotta realize like this
is what you're here for.

4120
01:57:46,461 --> 01:57:48,470
You're here to eat
grass and get fucked up.

4121
01:57:49,600 --> 01:57:50,210
The food chain.

4122
01:57:50,210 --> 01:57:50,961
One of these days,

4123
01:57:50,961 --> 01:57:53,550
someone's going to find you slipping
and they're going to eat your ass.

4124
01:57:54,440 --> 01:57:54,741
Yeah.

4125
01:57:54,741 --> 01:57:56,450
And you guys walk and make a lot of noise.

4126
01:57:56,451 --> 01:57:57,740
Mountain lions have eight years.

4127
01:57:58,290 --> 01:58:01,160
Just going to slowly sneak up behind
you bitches and someone's going to get

4128
01:58:01,161 --> 01:58:01,994
jacked.

4129
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:02,430
Damn,

4130
01:58:02,430 --> 01:58:02,670
that's,

4131
01:58:02,670 --> 01:58:04,220
you live in the 10 pretty small.

4132
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:04,870
You got to get out of here.

4133
01:58:04,870 --> 01:58:04,930
No.

4134
01:58:04,930 --> 01:58:05,121
I said,

4135
01:58:05,121 --> 01:58:09,110
I can't believe how little effort
that was so easy to kill a cow,

4136
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:10,183
a cow,

4137
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:13,630
cow grabbing by the next shook it snapped.

4138
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:14,473
Boom.

4139
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:17,770
Be taken down by a lion or a crocodile.

4140
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:22,700
I think you want a lion because
lions going to actually kill you.

4141
01:58:22,750 --> 01:58:23,420
Yeah.

4142
01:58:23,420 --> 01:58:25,850
The crocodile just start eating
you and they drown you too.

4143
01:58:25,870 --> 01:58:27,440
They would drown you.

4144
01:58:27,441 --> 01:58:27,711
I mean,

4145
01:58:27,711 --> 01:58:27,951
they'll,

4146
01:58:27,951 --> 01:58:29,150
they'll eat first.

4147
01:58:29,151 --> 01:58:29,331
They don't.

4148
01:58:29,331 --> 01:58:31,380
That's what the Deli,

4149
01:58:32,210 --> 01:58:33,320
that death row,

4150
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,170
those crocodiles love,

4151
01:58:35,490 --> 01:58:37,100
they'll eat your fucking delicious dick.

4152
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:40,670
I think that's the thing with bears too,

4153
01:58:40,730 --> 01:58:42,150
is a bears.

4154
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:42,570
They don't,

4155
01:58:42,570 --> 01:58:43,500
they don't kill you first.

4156
01:58:43,501 --> 01:58:44,334
They just eat you.

4157
01:58:44,490 --> 01:58:45,161
Because if you,

4158
01:58:45,161 --> 01:58:48,600
what you want to do is you want to get
killed by a Predator because predators

4159
01:58:48,630 --> 01:58:49,200
are always,

4160
01:58:49,200 --> 01:58:53,280
if you're getting killed by something
that doesn't always kill it stuff.

4161
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,830
Sometimes he eats a lot of things
that it finds laying around,

4162
01:58:55,831 --> 01:58:57,690
whether it's in or whether it's,

4163
01:58:57,691 --> 01:58:58,110
um,

4164
01:58:58,110 --> 01:59:00,840
a berries or vegetables like bears.

4165
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:02,070
They fight just,

4166
01:59:02,070 --> 01:59:02,903
they just eat you.

4167
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:05,670
They didn't know that I can certainly
killing you once they have you.

4168
01:59:05,671 --> 01:59:08,220
They have you say they
wait 1200 fucking pounds,

4169
01:59:08,440 --> 01:59:09,450
so they just start eating.

4170
01:59:09,570 --> 01:59:10,420
Why kill you first?

4171
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:10,890
So carefree,

4172
01:59:10,890 --> 01:59:11,250
scream,

4173
01:59:11,250 --> 01:59:11,491
good.

4174
01:59:11,491 --> 01:59:12,480
I'm trying to eat your Dick.

4175
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:15,480
They just just shoo chunks of you.

4176
01:59:15,750 --> 01:59:17,960
They say that the Grizzly man
documentary when that guy,

4177
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:18,840
yeah.

4178
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:19,291
Amazing.

4179
01:59:19,291 --> 01:59:20,430
Right folks,

4180
01:59:20,431 --> 01:59:22,140
if you have not watched grizzly man,

4181
01:59:22,260 --> 01:59:25,500
it's one of the best unintentional
comedies in the history of film.

4182
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:26,933
Yeah.

4183
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,070
It's kind of our love story.

4184
01:59:31,780 --> 01:59:34,180
When we were dating I was like,

4185
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:34,571
I don't know,

4186
01:59:34,571 --> 01:59:35,081
I forget,

4187
01:59:35,081 --> 01:59:35,471
but we were like,

4188
01:59:35,471 --> 01:59:37,660
we got to go see this movie.

4189
01:59:37,690 --> 01:59:40,210
But this fucking guy
that lived with bears,

4190
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:41,213
I remember that.

4191
01:59:41,230 --> 01:59:45,670
I remember the news story breaking and
that we went and we're sitting in this

4192
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:46,061
theater,

4193
01:59:46,061 --> 01:59:48,790
I think it was in Pasadena at a Lemley,

4194
01:59:48,791 --> 01:59:51,370
so it was more of like it was playing
in like the art artsy theater.

4195
01:59:51,371 --> 01:59:53,050
It wasn't in like the
major release theaters.

4196
01:59:53,080 --> 01:59:56,110
It was in the artsy theaters around
and we went and there was like,

4197
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:56,351
I don't know,

4198
01:59:56,351 --> 02:00:01,351
maybe like 50 or 60 people at it and
the whole time every like basically beat

4199
02:00:02,651 --> 02:00:05,680
over the movie were in hysterics laughing.

4200
02:00:06,040 --> 02:00:08,200
And the other 50 people are not like,

4201
02:00:08,201 --> 02:00:12,040
they're all serious movie
goers that like really feel

4202
02:00:12,210 --> 02:00:13,043
for like

4203
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:15,430
two years

4204
02:00:17,380 --> 02:00:21,180
we're getting looks from people that
were getting looks like it's not fucking

4205
02:00:21,181 --> 02:00:22,014
funny.

4206
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,223
He's dead.

4207
02:00:23,290 --> 02:00:23,920
Oh,

4208
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:24,450
that's what,

4209
02:00:24,450 --> 02:00:24,671
Oh,

4210
02:00:24,671 --> 02:00:25,570
funny though.

4211
02:00:25,571 --> 02:00:29,020
It's like it does a disservice to
his life to pretend he wasn't funny.

4212
02:00:30,240 --> 02:00:31,080
Remember the pilot,

4213
02:00:31,230 --> 02:00:33,300
the best lines that the pilot who,

4214
02:00:33,301 --> 02:00:33,600
uh,

4215
02:00:33,600 --> 02:00:34,830
would drop them off and he was like,

4216
02:00:34,831 --> 02:00:36,850
and he decided he wanted to
go live with bears in the,

4217
02:00:37,110 --> 02:00:37,410
yeah,

4218
02:00:37,410 --> 02:00:38,280
I thought it was retarded.

4219
02:00:38,310 --> 02:00:43,310
[inaudible]

4220
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:48,890
my favorite part was when

4221
02:00:49,160 --> 02:00:51,350
he was walking around with his camera,

4222
02:00:52,050 --> 02:00:54,380
talking to his camera about how
easy it would be if he was gay,

4223
02:00:54,410 --> 02:00:55,243
but he's not gay.

4224
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:56,271
He's like,

4225
02:00:56,271 --> 02:01:01,010
so obviously gang walking around with
his camera and he's like talking to it.

4226
02:01:01,490 --> 02:01:03,920
I ran into some guy who,

4227
02:01:03,950 --> 02:01:04,520
um,

4228
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,900
his roommate,

4229
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:09,350
like apparently the grizzly man was
in love with his roommate and when his

4230
02:01:09,351 --> 02:01:10,460
roommate didn't reciprocate,

4231
02:01:10,461 --> 02:01:11,690
he trashed his apartment.

4232
02:01:12,170 --> 02:01:14,030
Apparently he was a
bit of an angry fellow.

4233
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:18,560
Like if you ever saw the video and he's
screaming and yelling into the camera,

4234
02:01:19,190 --> 02:01:20,510
he does like a bunch of different takes

4235
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:24,653
pairs.

4236
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:26,590
I worked it out

4237
02:01:30,140 --> 02:01:34,670
and he's got this like really
obvious like sort of fam gay voice.

4238
02:01:35,120 --> 02:01:36,820
He's got that voice like this

4239
02:01:37,800 --> 02:01:39,800
undeniable stereotypical

4240
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:42,460
like cartoonish gay boys.

4241
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:42,730
Yeah,

4242
02:01:42,730 --> 02:01:43,100
it does.

4243
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:44,150
And so he's walking,

4244
02:01:44,240 --> 02:01:45,590
holding up the camera going,

4245
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:45,831
well,

4246
02:01:45,831 --> 02:01:47,520
if I was gay I could just go to a rest,

4247
02:01:47,521 --> 02:01:49,160
stop and meet a guy bought,

4248
02:01:49,170 --> 02:01:50,003
I'm not,

4249
02:01:50,580 --> 02:01:51,650
he Treadwell's not gay.

4250
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:53,270
And it's like the weirdest thing.

4251
02:01:53,271 --> 02:01:54,610
Like this poor fucking guy.

4252
02:01:54,611 --> 02:01:59,611
Like he was so torn up and confused and
conflicted that he just decided to go

4253
02:01:59,991 --> 02:02:00,880
live with bears.

4254
02:02:02,090 --> 02:02:02,481
He missed,

4255
02:02:02,481 --> 02:02:05,950
he misread the fucking newsletter
and when after real bears.

4256
02:02:05,951 --> 02:02:06,784
Yeah,

4257
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:08,133
guys like me.

4258
02:02:08,200 --> 02:02:12,290
[inaudible]

4259
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:15,290
it was crazy how close
he got to the animals.

4260
02:02:15,291 --> 02:02:17,190
They're like with a fox
became his little buddy.

4261
02:02:20,010 --> 02:02:20,843
Oh,

4262
02:02:24,910 --> 02:02:26,210
he's like touching her shit.

4263
02:02:26,240 --> 02:02:30,690
Wasn't the Fox called
like Foxy Fox is foxy?

4264
02:02:30,740 --> 02:02:31,573
What was the thing?

4265
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:34,310
Chocolat it also says us so gay.

4266
02:02:34,400 --> 02:02:34,821
When he got,

4267
02:02:34,821 --> 02:02:37,880
remember when the bear approached him
one time bear was approaching him and he

4268
02:02:37,881 --> 02:02:38,450
was like,

4269
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:38,691
he was like,

4270
02:02:38,691 --> 02:02:39,080
fuck you.

4271
02:02:39,080 --> 02:02:39,381
Fuck you.

4272
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:40,250
Or like you're waiting for me.

4273
02:02:41,050 --> 02:02:41,883
I love you.

4274
02:02:42,910 --> 02:02:43,743
I love you.

4275
02:02:46,410 --> 02:02:46,870
Oh,

4276
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:47,451
that's what it was.

4277
02:02:47,451 --> 02:02:48,284
The reverse.

4278
02:02:48,970 --> 02:02:50,000
He has to be in IBM.

4279
02:02:50,180 --> 02:02:51,170
Let's stern with them.

4280
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:52,430
Have to be stern with them.

4281
02:02:53,270 --> 02:02:54,020
No,

4282
02:02:54,020 --> 02:02:55,280
don't want to let him get in too close.

4283
02:02:55,580 --> 02:02:59,450
Apparently the death video where they
never got a kit lens on it so it's only

4284
02:02:59,451 --> 02:03:00,240
audio.

4285
02:03:00,240 --> 02:03:03,710
The other cap on but the camera
was running is seven minutes long.

4286
02:03:04,130 --> 02:03:06,080
It took them seven minutes
for the bear to eat them.

4287
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:08,030
It was him and his girlfriend.

4288
02:03:08,480 --> 02:03:09,313
The barrel of the bolts.

4289
02:03:09,650 --> 02:03:12,890
The girlfriend hit the bear over the head
with a frying pan apparently a couple

4290
02:03:12,891 --> 02:03:16,070
of times in the barrels like
bitch and there was a sick bear.

4291
02:03:16,071 --> 02:03:17,540
Apparently it was sick bear.

4292
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:19,820
They found out like later on.

4293
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:24,850
I remember you could look it up that I
don't remember if the bear had like some

4294
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:25,870
type of disease.

4295
02:03:25,870 --> 02:03:26,151
I don't know,

4296
02:03:26,151 --> 02:03:28,820
the rabies or something
where it was not in a,

4297
02:03:28,821 --> 02:03:33,630
it wasn't like a healthy normal
functioning bear is what that was.

4298
02:03:33,800 --> 02:03:34,340
But it was,

4299
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:35,560
I didn't know it was something else.

4300
02:03:35,630 --> 02:03:35,950
I,

4301
02:03:35,950 --> 02:03:39,830
that's what I read is that they didn't
really find much of the bear because the,

4302
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:41,450
they shot the bear when they,

4303
02:03:41,451 --> 02:03:41,571
uh,

4304
02:03:41,571 --> 02:03:44,720
they flew over and they
saw that the bear had,

4305
02:03:44,730 --> 02:03:45,110
uh,

4306
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:45,411
had,

4307
02:03:45,411 --> 02:03:50,000
had killed these people because apparently
a pilot saw the rib cage coming up.

4308
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:51,193
That's what he saw.

4309
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:53,240
And he realized that this
bears eating a person.

4310
02:03:53,610 --> 02:03:55,790
He saw close saw tent all the camp.

4311
02:03:55,880 --> 02:03:57,350
So he knew that the bear
was eating a person.

4312
02:03:57,351 --> 02:03:57,951
So the,

4313
02:03:57,951 --> 02:03:58,550
um,

4314
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:00,110
they got a guy,

4315
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:00,801
you know,

4316
02:04:00,801 --> 02:04:02,270
one of the ranges I guess shot him.

4317
02:04:02,650 --> 02:04:04,580
And then when they went back,

4318
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:06,590
I think it was like a
couple of months later,

4319
02:04:06,591 --> 02:04:07,580
there was nothing left.

4320
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,541
It was like,

4321
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:08,791
you know,

4322
02:04:08,791 --> 02:04:11,460
there was just a fucking a
couple pieces of bones I thought.

4323
02:04:12,080 --> 02:04:14,210
I thought they found
the diamond is the guy.

4324
02:04:15,150 --> 02:04:15,710
I don't know.

4325
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:16,400
They might have,

4326
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:19,520
I mean they might have processed
the bears guts once they're,

4327
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:19,940
yeah,

4328
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:20,910
they killed him as well.

4329
02:04:20,930 --> 02:04:21,440
Likely.

4330
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,400
And by no means,

4331
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:22,670
you know,

4332
02:04:22,670 --> 02:04:23,211
if you're listening,

4333
02:04:23,211 --> 02:04:25,700
do not let this deter you
from living with them.

4334
02:04:29,350 --> 02:04:30,183
Fine

4335
02:04:30,850 --> 02:04:32,580
dictated to all these Alaska shows,

4336
02:04:32,581 --> 02:04:33,020
man.

4337
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:33,120
Oh,

4338
02:04:33,120 --> 02:04:33,953
it's really cool.

4339
02:04:34,020 --> 02:04:36,630
I watch all these last
frontier shows like Alaska,

4340
02:04:36,631 --> 02:04:38,220
the last and the Yukon

4341
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,930
man and that is courageous.

4342
02:04:40,931 --> 02:04:44,790
He live in man and he just went hunting
somewhere up north than you Montana.

4343
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:45,653
But that's Marty

4344
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:48,600
Montana doesn't give a fuck.

4345
02:04:48,650 --> 02:04:49,350
Okay.

4346
02:04:49,350 --> 02:04:50,161
That place is,

4347
02:04:50,161 --> 02:04:53,370
we went down the Missouri River and to
a place called the bad lands and the

4348
02:04:53,371 --> 02:04:54,750
badlands does not give a fuck.

4349
02:04:54,751 --> 02:04:56,340
You might as well have gone to the moon.

4350
02:04:56,430 --> 02:04:56,851
Really?

4351
02:04:56,851 --> 02:04:57,121
Yeah.

4352
02:04:57,121 --> 02:04:58,200
You might as well be on the moon.

4353
02:04:58,201 --> 02:04:58,921
There's no one there.

4354
02:04:58,921 --> 02:05:00,990
There's no cell phone signal
and you ain't got shit.

4355
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:06,050
You got no radio and you are in what
is the bottom of a giant ancient ocean?

4356
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:10,620
He used to be the great western
inland sea during the Jurassic period,

4357
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:13,140
like there was dinosaurs and
Shit Roman through that area.

4358
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:14,220
So the bottom,

4359
02:05:14,221 --> 02:05:16,500
the ground everywhere is like silt.

4360
02:05:16,650 --> 02:05:19,440
It's like that same like slippery
shit on the bottom of the lake.

4361
02:05:19,560 --> 02:05:22,590
So you have mountains sort of
covered in silt and theirs.

4362
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:26,200
They had homesteads out there
where they gave people like you,

4363
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:26,491
you,

4364
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:27,390
if you live there,

4365
02:05:27,391 --> 02:05:30,540
you could claim a giant chunk of land
and as long as you lived on it for a

4366
02:05:30,541 --> 02:05:31,321
certain amount of time,

4367
02:05:31,321 --> 02:05:32,370
it would be your land.

4368
02:05:32,700 --> 02:05:32,851
Well,

4369
02:05:32,851 --> 02:05:34,500
they gave these people
land and they all left.

4370
02:05:34,650 --> 02:05:35,220
They all quit.

4371
02:05:35,220 --> 02:05:35,870
No one can,

4372
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:36,770
you can't grow anything on it.

4373
02:05:36,771 --> 02:05:37,140
Yeah.

4374
02:05:37,140 --> 02:05:38,970
It's like this crazy silty shit.

4375
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:39,900
And there's,

4376
02:05:39,900 --> 02:05:41,160
I mean there's deer round,

4377
02:05:41,161 --> 02:05:41,701
but man,

4378
02:05:41,701 --> 02:05:44,670
you've got to fucking hunt for
days sometimes to kill one.

4379
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:45,330
Wow.

4380
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:48,030
So you're out there camping and trying
to catch these deer and bringing them

4381
02:05:48,031 --> 02:05:49,500
back to your family at
a certain point in time.

4382
02:05:49,540 --> 02:05:49,651
Like,

4383
02:05:49,651 --> 02:05:49,801
look,

4384
02:05:49,801 --> 02:05:51,930
we've got to get the fuck out of here
and we're going to run out of food.

4385
02:05:52,220 --> 02:05:52,981
And so they all did.

4386
02:05:52,981 --> 02:05:53,814
They all bailed.

4387
02:05:54,140 --> 02:05:54,351
They,

4388
02:05:54,351 --> 02:05:54,641
these,

4389
02:05:54,641 --> 02:05:55,800
this just not reliable.

4390
02:05:55,800 --> 02:05:58,110
And in the wintertime it
gets way too fucking cold.

4391
02:05:58,320 --> 02:05:59,490
It gets so cold at the river.

4392
02:05:59,491 --> 02:06:01,260
Freezes the river fees a solid.

4393
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:01,960
Yeah,

4394
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:04,170
you got to cut holes in it and
try to get fish out of there.

4395
02:06:04,171 --> 02:06:05,004
Bitch.

4396
02:06:05,130 --> 02:06:06,870
Good luck trying to
feed yourself like that.

4397
02:06:06,871 --> 02:06:07,704
So they all bailed.

4398
02:06:07,710 --> 02:06:07,951
Wow.

4399
02:06:07,951 --> 02:06:08,581
So that's why we,

4400
02:06:08,581 --> 02:06:09,414
we went hunting.

4401
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:10,080
It was fast.

4402
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:10,711
That's pretty awesome.

4403
02:06:10,711 --> 02:06:11,011
It's like,

4404
02:06:11,011 --> 02:06:12,690
it was literally like
going to another planet.

4405
02:06:12,840 --> 02:06:13,800
It was so humbling,

4406
02:06:14,310 --> 02:06:14,521
you know,

4407
02:06:14,521 --> 02:06:18,570
the live outside like that for five days
and that kind of environment is really,

4408
02:06:18,571 --> 02:06:18,901
really,

4409
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:20,520
really humbling because you,

4410
02:06:20,521 --> 02:06:21,540
you start to feel it,

4411
02:06:21,541 --> 02:06:23,790
you start to see like how Frat,

4412
02:06:23,791 --> 02:06:24,091
first of all,

4413
02:06:24,091 --> 02:06:25,170
how fragile you are.

4414
02:06:25,171 --> 02:06:26,340
Even just the temperature,

4415
02:06:26,610 --> 02:06:27,930
like it was 12 degrees out.

4416
02:06:27,960 --> 02:06:29,280
When we're sleeping outside,

4417
02:06:29,281 --> 02:06:30,240
it's 12 degrees.

4418
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:33,880
So you're bundled up in this sleeping
bag and shit and zipped over your head

4419
02:06:33,881 --> 02:06:34,470
and,

4420
02:06:34,470 --> 02:06:36,470
and we're trying to
squeeze yourself to Ge,

4421
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:38,940
so make your body warm and it's 12 degrees

4422
02:06:40,890 --> 02:06:42,840
and nothing gives a fuck about you.

4423
02:06:42,841 --> 02:06:45,180
And it's just a bunch of things
out there eating other things.

4424
02:06:45,250 --> 02:06:45,991
That's all it is.

4425
02:06:45,991 --> 02:06:47,550
It's deer eating grass.

4426
02:06:47,551 --> 02:06:48,690
Mountain lions eaten deer.

4427
02:06:48,780 --> 02:06:52,950
We found mountain mine shit is big
thick rope of shit with fur in it.

4428
02:06:53,940 --> 02:06:54,241
It's like,

4429
02:06:54,241 --> 02:06:55,260
whoa son.

4430
02:06:55,800 --> 02:06:56,240
No,

4431
02:06:56,240 --> 02:06:57,073
you see him,

4432
02:06:57,300 --> 02:06:58,470
you know this is the food chain.

4433
02:06:58,500 --> 02:06:59,460
This is this one.

4434
02:06:59,461 --> 02:07:01,140
Really harsh ecosystem.

4435
02:07:01,270 --> 02:07:02,103
Yeah.

4436
02:07:02,200 --> 02:07:02,800
Yeah.

4437
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:05,230
Not Survive or guy or he goes out,

4438
02:07:05,231 --> 02:07:06,880
he went to like Scotland.

4439
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:07,130
Yeah,

4440
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:08,720
and just on the other side of the hill,

4441
02:07:08,721 --> 02:07:11,830
if there's people living right at the
Morris or whatever on the other side,

4442
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:13,240
he tries to spend the night.

4443
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:16,390
There were people do live
just out in the wild and he,

4444
02:07:16,510 --> 02:07:16,761
you know,

4445
02:07:16,761 --> 02:07:17,980
we almost spreads his dick off.

4446
02:07:17,981 --> 02:07:19,090
It's fucking cold.

4447
02:07:19,091 --> 02:07:19,900
It's an uninsured.

4448
02:07:19,900 --> 02:07:22,300
Is this the real survivor
man or that other guy?

4449
02:07:22,570 --> 02:07:24,880
I remember which one is that guy?

4450
02:07:24,881 --> 02:07:26,530
That guy who slept in hotels.

4451
02:07:27,220 --> 02:07:29,500
There was a guy slept in hotels
that made it seem like he wasn't.

4452
02:07:29,501 --> 02:07:29,711
Yeah,

4453
02:07:29,711 --> 02:07:30,400
you didn't know that.

4454
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:31,000
No.

4455
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:31,571
First of all,

4456
02:07:31,571 --> 02:07:32,291
the real guys,

4457
02:07:32,291 --> 02:07:33,040
Les Stroud,

4458
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,360
less trout is the real guy.

4459
02:07:34,390 --> 02:07:35,320
He goes out even for,

4460
02:07:35,340 --> 02:07:38,470
he goes for 10 days now
films it all himself.

4461
02:07:38,620 --> 02:07:39,101
He's,

4462
02:07:39,101 --> 02:07:40,120
he's the real deal.

4463
02:07:40,121 --> 02:07:40,751
He's legit.

4464
02:07:40,751 --> 02:07:42,310
But that bear Grylls character,

4465
02:07:42,760 --> 02:07:45,760
that dude is apparently in
the some like military guy.

4466
02:07:45,761 --> 02:07:47,500
He probably is like sort
of a survival expert.

4467
02:07:47,770 --> 02:07:49,180
But when he was doing that show,

4468
02:07:49,181 --> 02:07:50,550
he was like faking a lot of shit.

4469
02:07:50,551 --> 02:07:52,450
Like we just came upon a seal caucus.

4470
02:07:52,540 --> 02:07:53,740
Now we can use this for food.

4471
02:07:54,400 --> 02:07:54,810
Yeah,

4472
02:07:54,810 --> 02:07:55,240
that guy,

4473
02:07:55,240 --> 02:07:55,871
he's like,

4474
02:07:55,871 --> 02:07:57,600
he didn't really come
across the seal carcass.

4475
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:00,020
Like they put that thing there and they,

4476
02:08:00,130 --> 02:08:01,150
according to les,

4477
02:08:01,390 --> 02:08:06,010
Les says they made man vs wild because
they were always trying to get him to

4478
02:08:06,011 --> 02:08:06,671
fake shit,

4479
02:08:06,671 --> 02:08:07,750
but he wouldn't fake shit.

4480
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:09,970
We had him on the podcast
he was talking about.

4481
02:08:10,210 --> 02:08:10,451
He's like,

4482
02:08:10,451 --> 02:08:12,040
I wouldn't say wow.

4483
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:12,341
Yeah,

4484
02:08:12,341 --> 02:08:12,880
so the,

4485
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:13,240
that's,

4486
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:15,610
he told me that that's what they
got bear Grylls to do his show.

4487
02:08:15,611 --> 02:08:15,881
They were like,

4488
02:08:15,881 --> 02:08:16,714
we'll show you.

4489
02:08:16,870 --> 02:08:17,740
We're going to do the same show,

4490
02:08:17,741 --> 02:08:18,431
do your own show,

4491
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:19,420
but we're faking everything.

4492
02:08:19,540 --> 02:08:22,360
But meanwhile everybody found out they
fake things and nobody wants to watch it

4493
02:08:22,361 --> 02:08:22,520
now.

4494
02:08:22,520 --> 02:08:23,020
Horse.

4495
02:08:23,020 --> 02:08:23,231
Oh,

4496
02:08:23,231 --> 02:08:23,951
watch some dude.

4497
02:08:23,951 --> 02:08:28,951
Pretend any sleep in the
jungle or helicoptered into
a four star hotel and the

4498
02:08:29,170 --> 02:08:34,120
disco at night drinking Margaritas and
put it back there in the morning and he's

4499
02:08:34,121 --> 02:08:34,300
like,

4500
02:08:34,300 --> 02:08:34,511
oh,

4501
02:08:34,511 --> 02:08:38,530
what a night fi's get his feet massaged.

4502
02:08:39,150 --> 02:08:42,520
Well deal at night in a
jungle is not pleasant,

4503
02:08:43,330 --> 02:08:47,890
but thankfully I can trick
my own UPIs to stay hydrated.

4504
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:51,410
Don't drink ocean water
but drink plenty of urine.

4505
02:08:51,570 --> 02:08:52,930
Love that shit though.

4506
02:08:52,931 --> 02:08:54,220
I love all that stuff.

4507
02:08:54,250 --> 02:08:55,270
I love the real shit.

4508
02:08:55,360 --> 02:08:56,193
I don't love,

4509
02:08:56,200 --> 02:08:59,500
I can't watch the bear Grylls show
as soon as I found out that they were

4510
02:08:59,530 --> 02:09:01,530
manufacturing scenarios and no,

4511
02:09:01,580 --> 02:09:02,590
he's just showing you.

4512
02:09:02,591 --> 02:09:03,670
I understand what they're saying.

4513
02:09:03,671 --> 02:09:06,880
They're saying he's showing you how you
would survive if you came across this so

4514
02:09:06,881 --> 02:09:09,070
let's just make this happen
and have him deal with it.

4515
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:12,820
But he did a lot of shit that was like
you would never do like really dangerous

4516
02:09:12,821 --> 02:09:13,451
risky shit.

4517
02:09:13,451 --> 02:09:14,950
Like jumping off of things.

4518
02:09:14,951 --> 02:09:18,400
Like why is he jumping off of this
sliding down the sides of mountains,

4519
02:09:18,401 --> 02:09:19,900
like why are you doing why
you're doing it like this.

4520
02:09:19,901 --> 02:09:20,830
This isn't like seems dangerous.

4521
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:23,130
Go sliding into an ice cave like why?

4522
02:09:23,140 --> 02:09:23,380
What's,

4523
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:24,213
there's nothing in there for you.

4524
02:09:24,700 --> 02:09:25,580
Don't go in that Nice caring,

4525
02:09:25,710 --> 02:09:26,543
preserving.

4526
02:09:26,900 --> 02:09:27,460
That's Christ.

4527
02:09:27,460 --> 02:09:28,240
What are you doing there?

4528
02:09:28,240 --> 02:09:29,140
Avoid that cave.

4529
02:09:29,330 --> 02:09:30,450
Just a crazy asshole.

4530
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:30,880
I totally,

4531
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,700
but that's what they want you to do.

4532
02:09:32,770 --> 02:09:35,380
If you tried to like
make a atomic Christina,

4533
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:37,270
your mom's house reality show,

4534
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:40,360
do you know how much fucking
bullshit you'd have to deal with it?

4535
02:09:40,530 --> 02:09:40,910
What?

4536
02:09:40,910 --> 02:09:41,530
Oh,

4537
02:09:41,530 --> 02:09:42,130
for sure.

4538
02:09:42,130 --> 02:09:42,611
First of all,

4539
02:09:42,611 --> 02:09:44,530
because you guys don't have a
big enough name to carry it,

4540
02:09:44,560 --> 02:09:45,370
just based on that,

4541
02:09:45,370 --> 02:09:46,390
they're going to have to promote it,

4542
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:47,321
so they're going to have to say,

4543
02:09:47,321 --> 02:09:47,411
well,

4544
02:09:47,411 --> 02:09:47,951
you know Tom,

4545
02:09:47,951 --> 02:09:48,101
look,

4546
02:09:48,101 --> 02:09:50,680
I know you're a well known standup
comedian in the world of standup comedy,

4547
02:09:50,681 --> 02:09:51,790
but people don't know you as an actor.

4548
02:09:51,850 --> 02:09:52,420
Okay,

4549
02:09:52,420 --> 02:09:53,980
so we're going to need
some help with this.

4550
02:09:53,981 --> 02:09:55,120
You need to help us along with this.

4551
02:09:55,121 --> 02:09:55,430
We're going to,

4552
02:09:55,430 --> 02:09:56,890
we're going to get to get your show going.

4553
02:09:57,960 --> 02:09:58,600
It's,

4554
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:00,040
it's not all reality.

4555
02:10:00,041 --> 02:10:00,320
Okay?

4556
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,941
What is reality?

4557
02:10:00,941 --> 02:10:01,241
Okay,

4558
02:10:01,241 --> 02:10:01,600
this is it.

4559
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,700
We're going to make some things
happen and you just do your thing.

4560
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,410
When the thing is really happening,

4561
02:10:05,650 --> 02:10:07,380
we're just making it
happen and we're like,

4562
02:10:07,420 --> 02:10:07,991
oh yeah,

4563
02:10:07,991 --> 02:10:08,351
okay,

4564
02:10:08,351 --> 02:10:08,800
sure.

4565
02:10:08,800 --> 02:10:11,590
So next thing you know you guys were in
marriage counseling and have it a fake

4566
02:10:11,591 --> 02:10:12,424
argument.

4567
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:14,530
You know Walrus in the backyard and

4568
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:22,270
you lost your redneck.

4569
02:10:23,170 --> 02:10:25,450
Well I'd love to make that
show if you're proposing.

4570
02:10:25,451 --> 02:10:28,820
No telling you don't do it and
try and tell you that I'm selling,

4571
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:29,650
I'm selling.

4572
02:10:29,650 --> 02:10:30,730
If you're buying and selling,

4573
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:32,980
well that's the thing about you guys,

4574
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:33,871
this podcast,

4575
02:10:33,871 --> 02:10:36,600
your podcast is a perfect because
nobody tells you what to do.

4576
02:10:36,810 --> 02:10:37,650
Like all podcasts,

4577
02:10:38,110 --> 02:10:38,720
they really,

4578
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:40,300
they represent it.

4579
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:42,180
Really represent what
the fuck you're thinking.

4580
02:10:42,181 --> 02:10:42,510
Yeah,

4581
02:10:42,510 --> 02:10:43,343
totally.

4582
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:44,190
You don't,

4583
02:10:44,190 --> 02:10:47,210
you don't lose the message
and the producers or you know,

4584
02:10:47,240 --> 02:10:48,510
network notes or any,

4585
02:10:48,511 --> 02:10:49,344
any of that shit.

4586
02:10:49,420 --> 02:10:49,601
Yeah.

4587
02:10:49,601 --> 02:10:50,070
It's what it's what,

4588
02:10:50,070 --> 02:10:53,020
it's really what you want it to be
and that's what's cool about like the

4589
02:10:53,021 --> 02:10:54,700
different circle of podcasts.

4590
02:10:54,701 --> 02:10:54,781
Like,

4591
02:10:54,781 --> 02:10:56,560
especially like ones that feel like are,

4592
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:57,340
you know,

4593
02:10:57,340 --> 02:11:02,340
they run off from like people that you're
associated with is that it's each is

4594
02:11:02,351 --> 02:11:07,150
like a representation of each of
everybody's personality and who they are.

4595
02:11:07,151 --> 02:11:07,421
Like,

4596
02:11:07,421 --> 02:11:07,960
you know,

4597
02:11:07,960 --> 02:11:09,790
skeptic tank with Ari is,

4598
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:13,540
it's so you're getting that's who already
is and that's what he wants to show to

4599
02:11:13,541 --> 02:11:14,020
be.

4600
02:11:14,020 --> 02:11:14,680
And you know,

4601
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:14,831
uh,

4602
02:11:14,831 --> 02:11:16,360
Joey Diaz is the same way.

4603
02:11:16,600 --> 02:11:18,430
It's and then what's happening now.

4604
02:11:18,460 --> 02:11:19,030
Absolutely.

4605
02:11:19,030 --> 02:11:21,250
And then I just did Duncan
Trussell family hour.

4606
02:11:21,251 --> 02:11:22,300
So Dunkin is that,

4607
02:11:22,330 --> 02:11:25,960
that's a total Dunkin experience
and you're getting to know the guy.

4608
02:11:25,961 --> 02:11:28,270
And then Burt just came
out with a podcast.

4609
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:29,740
Burt cast,

4610
02:11:29,740 --> 02:11:31,600
I did the first episode I should say.

4611
02:11:31,601 --> 02:11:36,080
I just sat there and laughed on the
first episode because it was in Burt's at

4612
02:11:36,081 --> 02:11:36,914
first place.

4613
02:11:38,770 --> 02:11:43,770
He had Joey Diaz and his
father and me in this room.

4614
02:11:43,900 --> 02:11:45,110
And Bert is,

4615
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:45,491
is,

4616
02:11:45,491 --> 02:11:45,760
you know,

4617
02:11:45,760 --> 02:11:46,750
he's steering the ship.

4618
02:11:46,751 --> 02:11:47,830
It's what he wants it to be.

4619
02:11:47,860 --> 02:11:48,880
That same thing.

4620
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:52,300
But you just sit there listening to Diaz.

4621
02:11:52,780 --> 02:11:53,800
Mr Kreischer,

4622
02:11:54,330 --> 02:11:55,750
the fucking funniest thing of,

4623
02:11:55,751 --> 02:11:56,380
I mean,

4624
02:11:56,380 --> 02:11:57,250
I was crying.

4625
02:11:57,280 --> 02:11:57,780
I was at,

4626
02:11:57,780 --> 02:11:58,840
I was in tears.

4627
02:11:58,841 --> 02:11:59,674
It was so funny.

4628
02:12:00,010 --> 02:12:00,910
And um,

4629
02:12:01,360 --> 02:12:02,830
what we do in your mom's house,

4630
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:03,693
it's totally,

4631
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:05,470
it's exactly what we want the show.

4632
02:12:05,471 --> 02:12:06,304
To me that's the most fun

4633
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:06,890
about it.

4634
02:12:06,890 --> 02:12:08,080
Is it totally what you want it to be?

4635
02:12:08,650 --> 02:12:09,790
We're so lucky right now.

4636
02:12:09,791 --> 02:12:10,120
Right.

4637
02:12:10,120 --> 02:12:10,440
Did judge,

4638
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:14,770
you was like feel that I feel so fortunate
to be a standup comic because you

4639
02:12:14,771 --> 02:12:16,540
don't need the big networks now.

4640
02:12:16,541 --> 02:12:17,950
If you want to do your fucking hour,

4641
02:12:17,951 --> 02:12:19,840
you don't need to go
through comedy central.

4642
02:12:20,020 --> 02:12:21,310
If you want to talk to your audience,

4643
02:12:21,311 --> 02:12:23,260
you can reach them directly
through the podcast.

4644
02:12:23,290 --> 02:12:25,180
They can download at any
time of day or night.

4645
02:12:25,181 --> 02:12:25,840
It's the best thing.

4646
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:29,800
And what's really cool about this is that
people that get into a position where

4647
02:12:29,801 --> 02:12:31,060
people are paying attention to,

4648
02:12:31,061 --> 02:12:33,190
then they can tell you
about some other cool shit.

4649
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:33,500
Right?

4650
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:34,570
Sort of like retweeting.

4651
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:35,250
Yeah,

4652
02:12:35,250 --> 02:12:39,310
like I love retweeting because people
send me some really fucking cool articles

4653
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:40,720
and I'll retweet those.

4654
02:12:40,721 --> 02:12:44,380
And like a lot of it is like really
interesting shit and there's no way you're

4655
02:12:44,381 --> 02:12:45,940
going to accumulate all
that crap on your own.

4656
02:12:46,070 --> 02:12:47,010
You need some help out there.

4657
02:12:47,610 --> 02:12:52,080
And that's one of the cools things about
like having a successful podcast is

4658
02:12:52,081 --> 02:12:54,490
like your podcast now has a big following.

4659
02:12:54,670 --> 02:12:55,750
You could tell them,

4660
02:12:55,751 --> 02:12:56,320
hey,

4661
02:12:56,320 --> 02:12:57,850
watch Berg crushes podcast,

4662
02:12:57,851 --> 02:12:59,540
listen to Burke crushes podcasts a new,

4663
02:12:59,650 --> 02:13:00,370
and now everybody goes,

4664
02:13:00,370 --> 02:13:01,203
oh awesome.

4665
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:01,961
And then they go,

4666
02:13:01,961 --> 02:13:02,231
wow,

4667
02:13:02,231 --> 02:13:03,370
I liked the way Tommy thinks.

4668
02:13:03,371 --> 02:13:03,701
You know,

4669
02:13:03,701 --> 02:13:03,891
Tom,

4670
02:13:03,891 --> 02:13:04,724
he makes me laugh.

4671
02:13:04,840 --> 02:13:05,860
Christina makes me laugh.

4672
02:13:06,070 --> 02:13:08,320
They're saying that
this is a great podcast.

4673
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:09,490
I'll go check it out.

4674
02:13:09,560 --> 02:13:13,450
And then it branches off and they can
do that and the next person and Ari can

4675
02:13:13,451 --> 02:13:14,380
introduce a new one.

4676
02:13:14,381 --> 02:13:15,214
And absolutely.

4677
02:13:15,790 --> 02:13:19,810
That's the coolest thing about it is like
we know so many people that are really

4678
02:13:19,811 --> 02:13:20,531
fucking funny.

4679
02:13:20,531 --> 02:13:22,630
But in this day and age,

4680
02:13:23,410 --> 02:13:24,970
before podcasting,

4681
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:28,540
it was really hard to
get your name out there,

4682
02:13:28,630 --> 02:13:29,800
but just as a standup.

4683
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:32,160
But you had to have some TV in order

4684
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,900
to be in the club.

4685
02:13:33,930 --> 02:13:34,170
Yeah.

4686
02:13:34,170 --> 02:13:35,040
And even then,

4687
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:39,240
like it takes a long time for people to
take enough chances on you and then word

4688
02:13:39,241 --> 02:13:41,520
of mouth and returning to a
place over and over again,

4689
02:13:41,730 --> 02:13:43,080
like to build up markets.

4690
02:13:43,090 --> 02:13:44,160
It takes a long,

4691
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:45,320
hard road.

4692
02:13:45,720 --> 02:13:47,160
But now all they have to do is be funny.

4693
02:13:47,310 --> 02:13:47,910
And you know,

4694
02:13:47,910 --> 02:13:49,050
podcasting too,

4695
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:52,790
like this was kind of an
experiment for me was um,

4696
02:13:53,050 --> 02:13:53,220
I,

4697
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:54,330
I spoke to you about it,

4698
02:13:54,430 --> 02:13:55,710
Elsa spoke to like Bill Burr,

4699
02:13:55,770 --> 02:14:00,770
Al Madrigal about putting out
an album on my own and you guys,

4700
02:14:00,931 --> 02:14:05,931
I'm saying separately all encouraged
me to do that and I did it on my own,

4701
02:14:06,030 --> 02:14:06,420
you know,

4702
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:07,253
put it out.

4703
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:12,320
But podcasting is the thing that
got really an audience for it.

4704
02:14:13,230 --> 02:14:13,700
You know,

4705
02:14:13,700 --> 02:14:14,140
like the,

4706
02:14:14,140 --> 02:14:14,511
like I,

4707
02:14:14,511 --> 02:14:18,660
I put it out there and
the whole like success of,

4708
02:14:18,690 --> 02:14:19,050
you know,

4709
02:14:19,050 --> 02:14:21,570
doing this thing on my own
where you feel kinda like,

4710
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,680
like you're an entrepreneur.

4711
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:23,160
Like,

4712
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:24,030
like I'm just going to read,

4713
02:14:24,060 --> 02:14:24,891
I'm not going to go the,

4714
02:14:24,891 --> 02:14:25,740
the label route,

4715
02:14:25,741 --> 02:14:26,760
I'm just going to record it.

4716
02:14:26,850 --> 02:14:27,683
And I'm going to,

4717
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,380
you know,

4718
02:14:28,380 --> 02:14:28,711
put it it,

4719
02:14:28,711 --> 02:14:31,860
just do it on my own and putting it
out there and then seeing if it works.

4720
02:14:31,861 --> 02:14:36,420
But seeing that the success is basically
because of the audience we built from

4721
02:14:36,421 --> 02:14:37,260
doing podcasts.

4722
02:14:37,440 --> 02:14:38,040
Yes.

4723
02:14:38,040 --> 02:14:39,270
It's a crazy connection to,

4724
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:42,750
and don't you feel like kind of obligated
to be in communication with these

4725
02:14:42,751 --> 02:14:43,330
people?

4726
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:44,163
I'm like,

4727
02:14:44,520 --> 02:14:45,091
absolutely.

4728
02:14:45,091 --> 02:14:45,660
And there's,

4729
02:14:45,660 --> 02:14:47,430
and keep making it more content.

4730
02:14:47,480 --> 02:14:48,240
Absolutely.

4731
02:14:48,240 --> 02:14:51,580
And it's so cool when
the standup now like,

4732
02:14:52,450 --> 02:14:53,230
Hey,

4733
02:14:53,230 --> 02:14:54,270
my audience isn't there yet.

4734
02:14:54,480 --> 02:14:58,830
They're coming now and it makes such a
difference when I look out and I can see

4735
02:14:58,831 --> 02:15:02,790
that they know who I am and I recognize
them and I see that we have this

4736
02:15:02,791 --> 02:15:05,730
wonderful connection and a talk to
the people after changed everything.

4737
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:06,571
This is awesome.

4738
02:15:06,571 --> 02:15:08,430
Like this is what I've wanted for so long.

4739
02:15:09,260 --> 02:15:13,320
We brought Brian on stage in Austin
and they went fucking ape shit.

4740
02:15:13,350 --> 02:15:13,770
Oh yeah.

4741
02:15:13,770 --> 02:15:16,470
Brian got like a standing
ovation going on stage in Austin.

4742
02:15:16,530 --> 02:15:17,363
Oh yeah.

4743
02:15:17,450 --> 02:15:19,830
And did you ever watch that
interview Alex Jones did of us.

4744
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:20,491
That was pretty cool.

4745
02:15:20,491 --> 02:15:20,611
Yeah,

4746
02:15:20,611 --> 02:15:21,001
it was good.

4747
02:15:21,001 --> 02:15:21,481
It was really cool.

4748
02:15:21,481 --> 02:15:21,790
Really good.

4749
02:15:21,790 --> 02:15:22,201
It was cool.

4750
02:15:22,201 --> 02:15:22,950
Yeah.

4751
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:25,740
I came back and he might may or
may not have gotten the high,

4752
02:15:25,890 --> 02:15:26,723
oh,

4753
02:15:27,210 --> 02:15:28,980
I did a may or may not.

4754
02:15:29,010 --> 02:15:32,550
I did Brian's like a little desk
squad tour in Ohio couple months ago.

4755
02:15:32,551 --> 02:15:32,880
Right.

4756
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:35,250
A month ago and I'm holy Shit,

4757
02:15:35,330 --> 02:15:36,930
when when you were brought on stage,

4758
02:15:37,170 --> 02:15:38,490
the place went fucking crazy.

4759
02:15:38,491 --> 02:15:38,800
Yeah.

4760
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:39,080
It's,

4761
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:39,470
it's,

4762
02:15:39,470 --> 02:15:42,070
it's a completely different
world now because of podcasts.

4763
02:15:42,210 --> 02:15:42,600
You can,

4764
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,940
you could literally make people
famous like in the real world.

4765
02:15:44,941 --> 02:15:46,080
Like they walk around like,

4766
02:15:46,680 --> 02:15:47,230
you know,

4767
02:15:47,230 --> 02:15:47,700
yeah.

4768
02:15:47,700 --> 02:15:52,500
It's interesting but it's like everything
that comedy networks never were,

4769
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:55,230
comedy networks were never
really comedians networking.

4770
02:15:55,470 --> 02:15:56,880
This is like a real comedy network.

4771
02:15:56,940 --> 02:15:57,560
Exactly.

4772
02:15:57,560 --> 02:15:58,680
Cause all of us,

4773
02:15:58,770 --> 02:15:59,280
it's like,

4774
02:15:59,280 --> 02:15:59,551
you know,

4775
02:15:59,551 --> 02:16:04,551
if I tell you go listen to Joey Diaz a
CD and I'm crying laughing when I tell

4776
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:06,000
you that you can trust me,

4777
02:16:06,030 --> 02:16:06,930
go listen to that shit.

4778
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:07,831
You know what I mean?

4779
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:08,640
It's like we,

4780
02:16:08,640 --> 02:16:11,340
we know what Ari's tastes or like,

4781
02:16:11,341 --> 02:16:11,551
you know,

4782
02:16:11,551 --> 02:16:12,800
we know a Dunkin station.

4783
02:16:13,050 --> 02:16:13,830
Yeah.

4784
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:14,730
You get to know the rare,

4785
02:16:14,731 --> 02:16:15,301
rare time,

4786
02:16:15,301 --> 02:16:15,710
man,

4787
02:16:15,710 --> 02:16:17,970
this is never been a moment
like this for entertainers.

4788
02:16:18,060 --> 02:16:18,390
No.

4789
02:16:18,390 --> 02:16:20,850
We can just sort of do your
own connection with your,

4790
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:23,020
with the audience that
wants to be with you.

4791
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:23,560
You,

4792
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:27,240
you're connected to them before that
would take a fucking pen and a pad and a

4793
02:16:27,241 --> 02:16:28,074
letter.

4794
02:16:28,210 --> 02:16:29,043
You know what I mean?

4795
02:16:29,320 --> 02:16:30,130
I mailed this time,

4796
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:32,120
they get to know the real you,

4797
02:16:32,121 --> 02:16:34,100
which is an interesting
facet of celebrity.

4798
02:16:34,101 --> 02:16:34,821
Now I think,

4799
02:16:34,821 --> 02:16:38,750
and I don't know if it seems like in the
past celebrities had to have two lives,

4800
02:16:38,751 --> 02:16:42,650
like there's your public sphere and your
private and now those two spheres are

4801
02:16:42,651 --> 02:16:45,770
merging and they almost have
to because of this technology.

4802
02:16:46,040 --> 02:16:47,810
Like they have access to the real you.

4803
02:16:47,830 --> 02:16:48,101
Yeah.

4804
02:16:48,101 --> 02:16:48,491
Yeah.

4805
02:16:48,491 --> 02:16:49,460
It's kind of cool.

4806
02:16:49,490 --> 02:16:49,791
I mean the,

4807
02:16:49,791 --> 02:16:51,770
obviously there's
drawbacks to that as well.

4808
02:16:51,860 --> 02:16:52,670
If you're a douchebag,

4809
02:16:52,670 --> 02:16:53,510
if you're a Douche bag,

4810
02:16:53,540 --> 02:16:54,560
they're gonna know who you really are.

4811
02:16:54,580 --> 02:16:54,800
Yeah.

4812
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:55,341
Correct.

4813
02:16:55,341 --> 02:16:56,030
Yeah,

4814
02:16:56,030 --> 02:16:56,510
yeah.

4815
02:16:56,510 --> 02:16:57,200
Right.

4816
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:58,033
Yeah.

4817
02:16:58,250 --> 02:16:59,083
Um,

4818
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:02,120
but I think that's ultimately
where the whole world was headed.

4819
02:17:02,450 --> 02:17:02,900
The,

4820
02:17:02,900 --> 02:17:04,370
the no secrets world.

4821
02:17:04,430 --> 02:17:05,061
I agree.

4822
02:17:05,061 --> 02:17:06,380
And no shame world.

4823
02:17:06,410 --> 02:17:06,800
Yeah.

4824
02:17:06,800 --> 02:17:09,650
Because everything this generation
is growing up in public,

4825
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:11,030
not like we did.

4826
02:17:11,031 --> 02:17:11,210
We,

4827
02:17:11,210 --> 02:17:14,780
there's no notion anymore of like
keep that photograph in your locker.

4828
02:17:14,781 --> 02:17:16,610
Like now put the photograph on Facebook.

4829
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:18,050
Everyone's going to see your titties.

4830
02:17:18,130 --> 02:17:18,261
Yeah.

4831
02:17:18,261 --> 02:17:19,150
Everybody's going to see it,

4832
02:17:19,151 --> 02:17:19,984
right?

4833
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:23,310
Yeah,

4834
02:17:23,310 --> 02:17:24,440
I see them today.

4835
02:17:26,710 --> 02:17:27,050
Yeah.

4836
02:17:27,050 --> 02:17:27,800
It's um,

4837
02:17:27,800 --> 02:17:29,390
these kids today too.

4838
02:17:29,391 --> 02:17:32,030
If you stop and think about how
silly you were when you were 17.

4839
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:32,760
Oh my gosh.

4840
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:34,400
How many pictures of your
Dick would be online?

4841
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:36,411
There would be,

4842
02:17:36,411 --> 02:17:38,860
so there would be chapters.

4843
02:17:39,340 --> 02:17:42,110
It would be like gigabytes of my day

4844
02:17:44,970 --> 02:17:46,010
would be everywhere.

4845
02:17:46,011 --> 02:17:49,610
College course famous for
being the dumbest kid.

4846
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:51,593
Right.

4847
02:17:52,380 --> 02:17:53,030
Emails.

4848
02:17:53,030 --> 02:17:54,690
I would just upload it everywhere.

4849
02:17:54,691 --> 02:17:54,960
Yeah.

4850
02:17:54,960 --> 02:17:55,280
I would,

4851
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,410
I would dick role everybody
instead of Rick Roll,

4852
02:17:57,411 --> 02:17:58,700
I would release the videos.

4853
02:17:59,750 --> 02:18:02,930
The video would start out with some music
and then I would jump out with my Dick

4854
02:18:04,220 --> 02:18:05,210
and funny ones too though.

4855
02:18:05,211 --> 02:18:05,421
Right?

4856
02:18:05,421 --> 02:18:08,300
With like sunglasses at my deck.

4857
02:18:09,200 --> 02:18:12,140
If I had access to that when
I was 17 anonymous access,

4858
02:18:12,410 --> 02:18:13,400
you'd all be seen my deck.

4859
02:18:13,470 --> 02:18:14,390
Is this a fact?

4860
02:18:14,391 --> 02:18:15,260
I'd get it out there.

4861
02:18:16,190 --> 02:18:17,070
So great.

4862
02:18:17,210 --> 02:18:18,043
Absolutely.

4863
02:18:18,530 --> 02:18:18,831
Yeah.

4864
02:18:18,831 --> 02:18:20,630
Imagine these poor kids today.

4865
02:18:20,810 --> 02:18:21,770
Anything they do,

4866
02:18:21,830 --> 02:18:22,021
any,

4867
02:18:22,021 --> 02:18:25,600
some of them very Photoshop
makes a Photoshop of them
for hundreds of photoshops

4868
02:18:25,610 --> 02:18:29,960
and me and with a woman's body with a
dude banging me this whole bottom yet I

4869
02:18:29,961 --> 02:18:30,794
did half of them.

4870
02:18:35,580 --> 02:18:36,090
Oh red.

4871
02:18:36,090 --> 02:18:37,650
Remember the real dollars I made of you?

4872
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:40,033
Yeah.

4873
02:18:40,050 --> 02:18:40,741
That's hilarious.

4874
02:18:40,741 --> 02:18:40,980
Yeah.

4875
02:18:40,980 --> 02:18:43,170
Those Photoshop is amazing.

4876
02:18:43,171 --> 02:18:45,960
Like what you can do and not feel like
sometimes you have to look at a picture,

4877
02:18:45,961 --> 02:18:47,070
go shop.

4878
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:51,450
Like someone's being like real subtle
fucking Mitt Romney's mom jeans photo.

4879
02:18:51,451 --> 02:18:52,380
So good.

4880
02:18:52,440 --> 02:18:53,070
That one is,

4881
02:18:53,070 --> 02:18:53,850
that's Photoshop.

4882
02:18:53,850 --> 02:18:54,640
Yeah,

4883
02:18:54,640 --> 02:18:55,740
but you look at it and you're like,

4884
02:18:55,780 --> 02:18:56,920
how's genes are really high on?

4885
02:18:58,470 --> 02:18:59,980
You're not sure I remember it.

4886
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:04,110
And they raised him up just
enough to make it perfect.

4887
02:19:04,860 --> 02:19:07,200
This a political show,

4888
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:08,070
uh,

4889
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:08,940
for and for the web,

4890
02:19:08,941 --> 02:19:09,721
for comedy central,

4891
02:19:09,721 --> 02:19:13,110
I was a writer on it that Kyle
kinane hosted like earlier this year,

4892
02:19:13,111 --> 02:19:15,360
all leading up to the
election and the whole thing.

4893
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,250
One of the episodes we were like,

4894
02:19:17,610 --> 02:19:19,110
God uses photo of Mitt Romney.

4895
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:22,560
We had people like doing
research just to make sure,

4896
02:19:22,830 --> 02:19:23,830
like is this Photoshop?

4897
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:24,541
This is one of those,

4898
02:19:24,541 --> 02:19:24,751
you're like,

4899
02:19:24,751 --> 02:19:25,740
this is so well done.

4900
02:19:25,800 --> 02:19:26,390
Like now that's,

4901
02:19:26,390 --> 02:19:27,223
that's not,

4902
02:19:27,970 --> 02:19:28,220
but

4903
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:28,821
people were like,

4904
02:19:28,821 --> 02:19:29,750
like lawyers were like,

4905
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:31,070
this is this really real is it?

4906
02:19:31,610 --> 02:19:32,443
Asking

4907
02:19:33,820 --> 02:19:38,820
for photos came out of his clothes and
he had experts examine them and show

4908
02:19:39,951 --> 02:19:41,570
proof that they had been doctored.

4909
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:43,610
And then later he came out and said,

4910
02:19:43,611 --> 02:19:43,971
all right,

4911
02:19:43,971 --> 02:19:44,661
this is me.

4912
02:19:44,661 --> 02:19:47,750
I got doing coke and
dress up like a check.

4913
02:19:50,390 --> 02:19:51,950
He didn't want to come clean with that.

4914
02:19:51,970 --> 02:19:52,803
Yeah.

4915
02:19:53,420 --> 02:19:53,870
Yeah.

4916
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:54,501
Well I liked that.

4917
02:19:54,501 --> 02:19:55,850
He probably got that monkey off his back.

4918
02:19:55,851 --> 02:19:57,290
They're probably fuck
with him for a long time.

4919
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:58,850
Plus I'm sure like panties,

4920
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:00,200
that Russian check,

4921
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:01,220
if she's still alive,

4922
02:20:01,221 --> 02:20:02,510
she probably still tortures them.

4923
02:20:02,511 --> 02:20:06,800
That probably scared one day she's going
to do interviews and shit and he's not

4924
02:20:06,801 --> 02:20:08,060
gonna be able to pay her off anymore.

4925
02:20:08,120 --> 02:20:09,440
Let's see the ball kicking video.

4926
02:20:09,470 --> 02:20:10,303
Let's see that one.

4927
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:12,470
Take it back home.

4928
02:20:12,510 --> 02:20:13,760
Oh yeah.

4929
02:20:13,761 --> 02:20:14,990
What the fuck man.

4930
02:20:16,730 --> 02:20:17,510
Too much.

4931
02:20:17,510 --> 02:20:18,343
Too much.

4932
02:20:19,250 --> 02:20:20,083
Poor Oscar.

4933
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:21,080
Yeah.

4934
02:20:21,080 --> 02:20:22,520
Do you think you'd like
to get ball kicked?

4935
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:23,151
Probably.

4936
02:20:23,151 --> 02:20:23,601
Just like,

4937
02:20:23,601 --> 02:20:25,010
he's beaten so many dudes acids.

4938
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:26,480
You want to beat his ass?

4939
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:27,820
Fuck a woman.

4940
02:20:27,820 --> 02:20:31,070
You got tired of being like Super Macho
man and we just wanted to wear a dress

4941
02:20:31,071 --> 02:20:31,904
and shit.

4942
02:20:33,380 --> 02:20:38,380
Dudes that are into s and
M or being submissive or
lawyers and high power people

4943
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:42,340
who will have to be in control in
their daily lives and then they,

4944
02:20:42,390 --> 02:20:43,700
they like a good ball kicking.

4945
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:44,630
That make sense?

4946
02:20:44,630 --> 02:20:45,020
Yeah.

4947
02:20:45,020 --> 02:20:46,070
I control everything else.

4948
02:20:46,071 --> 02:20:47,330
I tell people what to do all the time.

4949
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:52,310
Baby eyes at me call me daisy.

4950
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:55,340
How can we save those people folks?

4951
02:20:55,460 --> 02:20:56,211
Is there anything we can do?

4952
02:20:56,211 --> 02:20:57,250
Do we just accept the part?

4953
02:20:57,470 --> 02:20:59,650
Is the fact that they're just
a part of the spectrum of life?

4954
02:20:59,651 --> 02:21:01,880
I think you have to
that are Alpha Britain,

4955
02:21:01,910 --> 02:21:02,743
one of the two.

4956
02:21:02,820 --> 02:21:03,370
All right,

4957
02:21:03,370 --> 02:21:05,060
well Alpha being an interim tech together,

4958
02:21:05,120 --> 02:21:05,953
maybe get

4959
02:21:08,040 --> 02:21:11,000
immediately starts hill sprints today.

4960
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:12,170
Now there definitely.

4961
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:14,300
It definitely is part of the spectrum.

4962
02:21:14,301 --> 02:21:15,950
That's the crazy thing
is knowing that like,

4963
02:21:16,100 --> 02:21:16,550
you know,

4964
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:17,383
dude,

4965
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:19,520
that's all that's all on there,

4966
02:21:19,521 --> 02:21:19,850
man.

4967
02:21:19,850 --> 02:21:21,230
Everybody what the fuck man?

4968
02:21:22,070 --> 02:21:22,903
Spectrum.

4969
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:24,620
The spectrum of human beings,

4970
02:21:24,621 --> 02:21:25,610
you know and behavior.

4971
02:21:26,060 --> 02:21:27,320
It's mind boggling.

4972
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:27,900
Yeah.

4973
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,030
It was like the eight people.

4974
02:21:29,700 --> 02:21:30,470
I'm like,

4975
02:21:30,470 --> 02:21:31,220
that's what's that?

4976
02:21:31,220 --> 02:21:31,821
That's out there.

4977
02:21:31,821 --> 02:21:36,370
That guy that killed his gay
lover recently and chopped
up his ass on the camera

4978
02:21:36,400 --> 02:21:39,350
and was chunks of his ass on camera.

4979
02:21:40,580 --> 02:21:41,413
Battle ropes.

4980
02:21:42,570 --> 02:21:43,320
The guy in the bottom,

4981
02:21:43,320 --> 02:21:44,270
hassle Jujitsu,

4982
02:21:44,300 --> 02:21:47,750
many p he funneled into
position and get to the top.

4983
02:21:47,751 --> 02:21:48,380
Don't mount.

4984
02:21:48,380 --> 02:21:49,850
Take the knife away from him.

4985
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:50,570
Okay,

4986
02:21:50,570 --> 02:21:55,570
now you're doing better known
but a shitty way to die.

4987
02:21:56,150 --> 02:21:56,931
God kills you.

4988
02:21:56,931 --> 02:21:57,471
Fucks you,

4989
02:21:57,471 --> 02:21:58,940
and then eat your ass on TV.

4990
02:21:59,650 --> 02:22:00,490
All icing it out.

4991
02:22:00,750 --> 02:22:02,510
Oh Christ.

4992
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:04,720
What the fuck is with
people wanting the people?

4993
02:22:05,070 --> 02:22:05,870
What do you pray?

4994
02:22:05,870 --> 02:22:06,060
True.

4995
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:06,650
Proven.

4996
02:22:06,650 --> 02:22:07,820
I would try it though.

4997
02:22:07,821 --> 02:22:09,110
I'd tasted you were dying.

4998
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:10,243
Starvation.

4999
02:22:10,890 --> 02:22:11,723
Okay.

5000
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,280
What race do you think
would be the most delicious?

5001
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:13,620
Okay,

5002
02:22:13,620 --> 02:22:14,640
let's talk about this.

5003
02:22:16,790 --> 02:22:17,240
Let's see.

5004
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:17,541
Okay,

5005
02:22:17,541 --> 02:22:22,220
cause I know in Sushi I like fatty
tuna the most because it's a nice fatty

5006
02:22:22,221 --> 02:22:22,521
piece.

5007
02:22:22,521 --> 02:22:24,710
So white people right
now we're pretty fatty.

5008
02:22:24,770 --> 02:22:25,603
Wow.

5009
02:22:25,930 --> 02:22:30,930
I'm going to go corn Fed Iowa woman in
the airport that looks like Sam Kinison

5010
02:22:31,690 --> 02:22:33,490
fat lady be,

5011
02:22:37,520 --> 02:22:38,650
that would be good.

5012
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:40,260
But the,

5013
02:22:40,261 --> 02:22:42,750
the like the fattiness
would be more like a pork.

5014
02:22:42,751 --> 02:22:43,080
I think

5015
02:22:43,080 --> 02:22:43,940
it's like porn belly.

5016
02:22:44,190 --> 02:22:44,521
Yeah.

5017
02:22:44,521 --> 02:22:47,250
I don't think it'd be like tonight
at all to those fatty tuna.

5018
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:50,250
Even when tunas are slightly fatty,

5019
02:22:50,251 --> 02:22:53,400
like the bottom area that's lean is fuck
compared to almost every other organism

5020
02:22:53,401 --> 02:22:55,470
on the planet and still pretty muscular.

5021
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:55,690
Yeah.

5022
02:22:55,690 --> 02:22:56,910
You want to look at a Schumann?

5023
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:58,010
Humans are gross.

5024
02:22:59,020 --> 02:23:00,720
I like pork rinds.

5025
02:23:00,770 --> 02:23:01,080
Yeah,

5026
02:23:01,080 --> 02:23:01,890
no more like a,

5027
02:23:01,890 --> 02:23:02,760
like a roast,

5028
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:07,380
like a fat sloppy pork roast where the
meat's just fallen off cause it saw me

5029
02:23:07,390 --> 02:23:11,640
that a Cheetos me nutrition is as soda.

5030
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:14,610
I kind of fat guy

5031
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:18,060
with black beans or rice.

5032
02:23:18,220 --> 02:23:19,710
I like hot sauce.

5033
02:23:19,740 --> 02:23:23,160
I think you know the black guys are
pretty naturally muscular so I'd take one.

5034
02:23:23,161 --> 02:23:24,060
This is kind of fat,

5035
02:23:24,270 --> 02:23:25,590
so I get a nice mixture of like,

5036
02:23:25,591 --> 02:23:26,424
it's like a Ribeye,

5037
02:23:27,600 --> 02:23:28,051
marble,

5038
02:23:28,051 --> 02:23:28,381
marble,

5039
02:23:28,381 --> 02:23:28,841
the marble,

5040
02:23:28,841 --> 02:23:29,611
but not crazy.

5041
02:23:29,611 --> 02:23:29,940
Right?

5042
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:30,151
Yeah.

5043
02:23:30,151 --> 02:23:31,650
And probably just the darker meat too.

5044
02:23:31,650 --> 02:23:35,190
It's probably more nutritious Indian
because it's already seasoned.

5045
02:23:36,390 --> 02:23:37,223
That's a good point.

5046
02:23:37,500 --> 02:23:38,333
That's a very good

5047
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:40,973
price.

5048
02:23:41,090 --> 02:23:42,160
All that curry,

5049
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:44,580
they say that like pineapple
flavors your loads.

5050
02:23:44,670 --> 02:23:44,930
Right?

5051
02:23:44,930 --> 02:23:46,770
I'm sure curry would flavor your rump.

5052
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:47,641
Let's do it.

5053
02:23:47,641 --> 02:23:48,690
Curry Curry.

5054
02:23:48,691 --> 02:23:49,524
And your fats.

5055
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,120
Well that's the case with bears.

5056
02:23:51,320 --> 02:23:51,510
You know,

5057
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:52,111
with bears,

5058
02:23:52,111 --> 02:23:53,400
you want to eat a bear that,

5059
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:53,730
uh,

5060
02:23:53,730 --> 02:23:54,570
gets shot after,

5061
02:23:54,571 --> 02:23:55,800
eats a lot of blueberries.

5062
02:23:56,010 --> 02:23:58,950
The bears that like if you eat bears it
apparently it's like some of the most

5063
02:23:58,951 --> 02:24:00,150
delicious meat you can have.

5064
02:24:00,180 --> 02:24:00,541
Really?

5065
02:24:00,541 --> 02:24:00,781
Yeah.

5066
02:24:00,781 --> 02:24:04,530
Because it literally changes the way
that their flesh tastes and they're fat.

5067
02:24:04,531 --> 02:24:05,011
They're fat,

5068
02:24:05,011 --> 02:24:07,020
has all this like blueberry in the fat.

5069
02:24:07,050 --> 02:24:07,883
It's crazy.

5070
02:24:08,430 --> 02:24:09,200
It's really nutty.

5071
02:24:09,200 --> 02:24:09,491
Yeah.

5072
02:24:09,491 --> 02:24:09,811
Let's do,

5073
02:24:09,811 --> 02:24:10,530
let's do a trip.

5074
02:24:10,530 --> 02:24:10,971
I'll go kill it.

5075
02:24:10,971 --> 02:24:11,250
Bear.

5076
02:24:11,250 --> 02:24:12,230
Let's go last night.

5077
02:24:13,290 --> 02:24:14,123
What's your race?

5078
02:24:16,020 --> 02:24:16,920
Probably Asians.

5079
02:24:19,710 --> 02:24:22,320
I just know just type is
either Brazilian or Asians.

5080
02:24:22,850 --> 02:24:23,683
Yeah,

5081
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:25,053
probably.

5082
02:24:25,610 --> 02:24:26,870
Probably we would have like,

5083
02:24:26,960 --> 02:24:29,580
Asians aren't known for
being the most muscular call.

5084
02:24:29,590 --> 02:24:30,423
It'd be good.

5085
02:24:30,740 --> 02:24:31,670
Get a good cut.

5086
02:24:31,730 --> 02:24:32,360
Yeah.

5087
02:24:32,360 --> 02:24:33,680
Did you ever hear about that one guy from

5088
02:24:33,880 --> 02:24:34,840
pan who uh,

5089
02:24:34,960 --> 02:24:35,793
murdered a girl,

5090
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:40,040
cooked her an aider and then got
off like on some insanity case.

5091
02:24:40,041 --> 02:24:40,571
So he's only,

5092
02:24:40,571 --> 02:24:45,010
he was only incarcerated for a small
amount of time with her for a long time,

5093
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:46,270
like in a closet or something.

5094
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:47,373
Uh,

5095
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:48,661
yeah.

5096
02:24:48,661 --> 02:24:49,650
I don't know.

5097
02:24:49,740 --> 02:24:50,760
That's a good question.

5098
02:24:50,820 --> 02:24:51,870
Something along the lines.

5099
02:24:51,900 --> 02:24:53,430
I forget the guy's name,

5100
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:54,930
but he was uh,

5101
02:24:54,960 --> 02:24:56,180
he was famous for it.

5102
02:24:58,710 --> 02:24:59,543
That's not true.

5103
02:25:00,230 --> 02:25:01,063
Um,

5104
02:25:01,500 --> 02:25:02,310
that guy,

5105
02:25:02,310 --> 02:25:03,060
I'll pull it up.

5106
02:25:03,060 --> 02:25:03,893
Japanese.

5107
02:25:04,800 --> 02:25:04,921
Well,

5108
02:25:04,921 --> 02:25:06,150
I mean give the guy a break man.

5109
02:25:06,260 --> 02:25:06,570
Like,

5110
02:25:06,570 --> 02:25:07,201
so he had a bat,

5111
02:25:07,201 --> 02:25:07,740
you know,

5112
02:25:07,740 --> 02:25:08,420
did a bad thing.

5113
02:25:08,420 --> 02:25:10,020
She probably did something wrong.

5114
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:10,510
Right.

5115
02:25:10,510 --> 02:25:11,343
Probably said some shit.

5116
02:25:11,820 --> 02:25:13,110
She's talked a lot of shit.

5117
02:25:13,410 --> 02:25:14,161
This is his name.

5118
02:25:14,161 --> 02:25:14,540
Name East

5119
02:25:14,540 --> 02:25:15,830
side Sockeye wa.

5120
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:17,353
Yeah.

5121
02:25:17,390 --> 02:25:18,980
It's pretty fucking crazy.

5122
02:25:18,981 --> 02:25:23,981
And apparently this dude like
has described like openly
in 1991 he murdered and

5123
02:25:24,481 --> 02:25:29,481
cannibalize a Dutch woman named Renee
heart to that part developed and after

5124
02:25:30,001 --> 02:25:33,720
it's released he became a minor celebrity
in Japan making a living through

5125
02:25:33,721 --> 02:25:35,550
public interest in his crime.

5126
02:25:36,450 --> 02:25:37,350
Wow.

5127
02:25:38,520 --> 02:25:40,440
He served time and a French jail.

5128
02:25:40,620 --> 02:25:40,741
Oh,

5129
02:25:40,741 --> 02:25:41,610
the French led them out.

5130
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:42,510
Huh?

5131
02:25:42,510 --> 02:25:43,161
How long did he start?

5132
02:25:43,161 --> 02:25:43,401
Like,

5133
02:25:43,401 --> 02:25:43,921
listen,

5134
02:25:43,921 --> 02:25:45,360
he has suffered enough.

5135
02:25:45,380 --> 02:25:46,213
Yeah.

5136
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:46,811
All he did,

5137
02:25:46,811 --> 02:25:49,440
he seem to want a medic and yeah,

5138
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:53,660
he is under five feet tall and
he felt like he was weakened,

5139
02:25:53,690 --> 02:25:56,190
inadequate in the ADR because
he wanted to absorb her energy.

5140
02:25:57,810 --> 02:26:00,120
He fainted at the shock of shooting her,

5141
02:26:00,121 --> 02:26:04,110
but it woke with a realization that he
had to carry out his desire to eat her.

5142
02:26:04,410 --> 02:26:07,020
He did so beginning with
her buttocks and thighs.

5143
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:10,110
After having sex with
her corpse interviews,

5144
02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:15,230
he'd noted his surprise that the corn
colored nature of human fat for two days.

5145
02:26:15,961 --> 02:26:18,210
So gawa eight various parts of her body.

5146
02:26:18,390 --> 02:26:22,080
He described to me as soft
and odorless like tuna.

5147
02:26:22,770 --> 02:26:23,603
Hmm.

5148
02:26:24,060 --> 02:26:24,893
Wow.

5149
02:26:24,920 --> 02:26:26,060
That shit's crazy.

5150
02:26:26,061 --> 02:26:27,140
You fucking nailed it.

5151
02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:31,430
That flavor on that role
cannot shape girl though.

5152
02:26:31,990 --> 02:26:32,823
This wasn't a

5153
02:26:32,930 --> 02:26:33,763
fatty,

5154
02:26:33,800 --> 02:26:36,260
I don't think he was eating
someone for their pork like,

5155
02:26:37,710 --> 02:26:38,500
yeah,

5156
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:39,840
Sam Kinison like delicious.

5157
02:26:40,770 --> 02:26:41,603
He then attempted to do

5158
02:26:41,610 --> 02:26:43,800
dumped the mutilated
body in a remote lake,

5159
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:48,030
but was seen in the act and later arrested
by the French police who found parts

5160
02:26:48,031 --> 02:26:50,130
of the deceased still in his refrigerator.

5161
02:26:50,490 --> 02:26:51,271
Oh my God.

5162
02:26:51,271 --> 02:26:52,530
Ago is wealthy.

5163
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:56,730
Father provided a top lawyer for his
defense and after being held for two years

5164
02:26:56,731 --> 02:26:58,200
without trying on the French jail,

5165
02:26:58,890 --> 02:26:59,870
the uh,

5166
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,120
blah,

5167
02:27:00,120 --> 02:27:00,491
blah blah.

5168
02:27:00,491 --> 02:27:02,400
I found him legally insane,

5169
02:27:02,580 --> 02:27:05,740
an unfit to stand trial and ordered
him to be held indefinitely,

5170
02:27:05,920 --> 02:27:07,110
an immense less tuition.

5171
02:27:07,700 --> 02:27:08,610
Good cow.

5172
02:27:09,950 --> 02:27:12,670
He spent over three months
there and then he went home.

5173
02:27:13,420 --> 02:27:13,781
Yeah.

5174
02:27:13,781 --> 02:27:14,710
How did they let them out?

5175
02:27:14,711 --> 02:27:15,610
Jesus Christ.

5176
02:27:15,640 --> 02:27:15,911
Okay.

5177
02:27:15,911 --> 02:27:19,120
The Japanese authorities found it legally
impossible to hold him because the

5178
02:27:19,121 --> 02:27:22,360
French government refuse
to release court documents,

5179
02:27:22,361 --> 02:27:25,960
which remained a secret to Japan claiming
that the case has already dropped in

5180
02:27:25,961 --> 02:27:26,680
France.

5181
02:27:26,680 --> 02:27:27,940
So as a result,

5182
02:27:28,210 --> 02:27:29,380
wow.

5183
02:27:31,180 --> 02:27:33,630
They extradited him to Japan
and when they let him in Japan,

5184
02:27:33,650 --> 02:27:33,971
Japan,

5185
02:27:33,971 --> 02:27:34,804
just let them go.

5186
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:36,160
Oh Jeez.

5187
02:27:36,190 --> 02:27:40,270
It's funny how that always happens
between like when when somebody from a

5188
02:27:40,271 --> 02:27:42,610
country gets caught for
something in another country,

5189
02:27:42,820 --> 02:27:44,410
there's always like this irrational,

5190
02:27:44,411 --> 02:27:46,500
just we just want him once.

5191
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:47,470
Don't punish him.

5192
02:27:47,550 --> 02:27:48,281
This is crazy.

5193
02:27:48,281 --> 02:27:49,090
This is

5194
02:27:49,090 --> 02:27:50,410
upon his arrival in Japan,

5195
02:27:50,411 --> 02:27:54,670
he was immediately taken to the Mat
Susanna hospital where examining

5196
02:27:54,671 --> 02:27:56,860
psychologists all found him to be sane,

5197
02:27:56,980 --> 02:28:01,030
stating that sexual perversion was
the sole motivation for the murder.

5198
02:28:01,570 --> 02:28:03,040
That sounds like a sadistic,

5199
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:04,180
evil motherfucker then.

5200
02:28:04,181 --> 02:28:04,840
Right.

5201
02:28:04,840 --> 02:28:05,321
However,

5202
02:28:05,321 --> 02:28:08,110
the Japanese authorities found that
legally impossible to hold him because the

5203
02:28:08,111 --> 02:28:10,450
French government refuse
to release the documents.

5204
02:28:10,600 --> 02:28:13,360
So they said that this
guy was just a prevo.

5205
02:28:13,390 --> 02:28:18,070
He was totally sane to prayed and just
sexual perversion was the reason why I

5206
02:28:18,071 --> 02:28:18,904
killed this check.

5207
02:28:19,030 --> 02:28:23,300
He kills one and then he
makes a living as a minor.

5208
02:28:23,301 --> 02:28:25,670
Celebrities invited
like as a guest speaker,

5209
02:28:25,671 --> 02:28:26,090
um,

5210
02:28:26,090 --> 02:28:26,980
TV shows and shit.

5211
02:28:26,981 --> 02:28:29,240
He pretends to eat people's crazy box,

5212
02:28:29,241 --> 02:28:30,440
like biting people.

5213
02:28:30,530 --> 02:28:32,420
That's like if Ted Bundy
was doing talk shows,

5214
02:28:32,421 --> 02:28:35,180
like he wrote books about the murder.

5215
02:28:35,630 --> 02:28:38,750
He wrote books about it and
describing it in great detail.

5216
02:28:39,290 --> 02:28:39,860
Wow.

5217
02:28:39,860 --> 02:28:40,700
Jesus Christ.

5218
02:28:40,701 --> 02:28:40,850
Man,

5219
02:28:40,850 --> 02:28:41,840
this is incredible.

5220
02:28:42,630 --> 02:28:43,463
Uh,

5221
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:45,250
that judge Japanese,

5222
02:28:45,320 --> 02:28:47,210
Japanese are so different.

5223
02:28:47,240 --> 02:28:48,620
I know that culture is Joe.

5224
02:28:48,860 --> 02:28:50,750
Brian had all the places
that we've ever been to.

5225
02:28:50,770 --> 02:28:53,050
D It wasn't that the one that
most felt like we were on another,

5226
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:53,520
oh yeah,

5227
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:54,080
it was great.

5228
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:54,913
I can't wait to go back.

5229
02:28:55,220 --> 02:28:56,690
But wasn't it like Taiwan?

5230
02:28:56,780 --> 02:28:58,410
It really felt highly,

5231
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:02,240
it really felt like you
were in like another planet.

5232
02:29:02,540 --> 02:29:04,940
It's like you're in blade
runner or something really,

5233
02:29:04,941 --> 02:29:05,810
like be both it then.

5234
02:29:05,811 --> 02:29:07,400
It just got to hit again
with their earthquake.

5235
02:29:07,430 --> 02:29:08,121
7.2.

5236
02:29:08,121 --> 02:29:08,954
Yeah.

5237
02:29:09,950 --> 02:29:10,783
Yeah.

5238
02:29:10,850 --> 02:29:11,683
It's like an ugly.

5239
02:29:11,780 --> 02:29:13,100
So can I be for the Japanese?

5240
02:29:13,190 --> 02:29:13,940
That sucks.

5241
02:29:13,940 --> 02:29:14,780
I'm dying to visit.

5242
02:29:14,781 --> 02:29:16,010
I really want to take a trip one day.

5243
02:29:16,040 --> 02:29:16,671
Tough spot,

5244
02:29:16,671 --> 02:29:17,504
man.

5245
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:18,320
You know,

5246
02:29:18,320 --> 02:29:19,570
being on an island that's,

5247
02:29:19,610 --> 02:29:22,410
that's got regular volcanic earthquake

5248
02:29:22,570 --> 02:29:23,470
tivity like that.

5249
02:29:23,471 --> 02:29:24,910
And after that big tsunami,

5250
02:29:24,911 --> 02:29:26,650
like the reality of that all setting in,

5251
02:29:27,000 --> 02:29:28,210
that's a tough spot to live.

5252
02:29:28,750 --> 02:29:29,830
It's not that big either.

5253
02:29:29,980 --> 02:29:30,813

Is a small,

5257
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:32,531
smaller than Texas.

5258
02:29:32,531 --> 02:29:32,860

5259
02:29:32,860 --> 02:29:33,350

It's really interesting,

5266
02:29:43,271 --> 02:29:44,680
right through their buildings.

5267
02:29:44,681 --> 02:29:45,970
And I love the writing,

5268
02:29:45,971 --> 02:29:48,130
like seeing the writing
all illuminated and shit.

5269
02:29:48,131 --> 02:29:50,320
It really does look like some alien ship.

5270
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:51,880
It's fascinating culture.
