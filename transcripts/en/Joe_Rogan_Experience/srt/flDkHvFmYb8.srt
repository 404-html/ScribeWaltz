1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,970
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience
is one of the episodes from the Phi

2
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:04,510
series.

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:05,770
Joe Rogan questions,

4
00:00:05,771 --> 00:00:06,604
everything.

5
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,860
Before we do this podcast,

6
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:13,840
I would as I always do like to thank the
Scifi network for putting on the show

7
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:18,841
and Tim and Wayne from Saifai and frank
and Michael From and Todd as well from

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,500
the production company.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,700
I had a great time with you guys.

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,620
You're all cool as fuck and uh,

11
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,760
I appreciate it very much.

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:25,840
The,

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,290
um,

14
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,880
episodes were filmed,

15
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,063
uh,

16
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:34,110
for the show and we recorded audio on
them to release as a regular podcast.

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,331
So,

18
00:00:35,331 --> 00:00:35,411
uh,

19
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:38,500
that's why I want to thank a Psi Phi
for allowing us to put these out.

20
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,150
We decided that the best way to do these
podcasts was just to kind of have them

21
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:43,601
in the show.

22
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,160
There was like busy
work that we had to do,

23
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:45,580
like,

24
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,001
Dunkin,

25
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,650
I'm going to send you to
this place and you're gonna.

26
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:48,880
There was a lot of that stuff,

27
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,840
but the bulk of the podcast was
really just like a regular podcast,

28
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:55,470
maybe with some specific
subjects that we had to cover.

29
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:56,560
But Dunkin,

30
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:59,200
as always was fucking hilarious
and it was really fun to do.

31
00:00:59,530 --> 00:00:59,771
Uh,

32
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:00,850
so I hope you enjoy it.

33
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,250
This episode is brought
to you by carbonite.

34
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,630
Carbonite is a way to back up your
files for businesses or you know,

35
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,360
you could use it for yourself to small
businesses rely on files saved for saved

36
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,040
on business computers like proposals,

37
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:15,640
contracts,

38
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,473
invoices,

39
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,290
contact lists,

40
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:18,610
all essential for running your business.

41
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:21,070
But finding the time to back
them up can be a pain in the ass.

42
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:23,620
That's why you need
carbonite online backup.

43
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:27,280
The same great backup that carbonite
provides for personal computers is

44
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:30,460
available for all the computers
in your business as well.

45
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,080
And once you have carbonite,

46
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:35,230
you will never have to worry
about losing your computer files.

47
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:39,460
No matter how many computers your
business has or where they're located,

48
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:41,350
carbonite backs your files to the Cra,

49
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,580
to the cloud securely,

50
00:01:42,581 --> 00:01:43,480
automatically,

51
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:44,350
and continually.

52
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:48,250
It's great for a person like me
that I'm just not going to do it.

53
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:49,810
I'm just,

54
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,260
I need it.

55
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,490
I need things done for me.

56
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:52,630
I need it to be automatic.

57
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,910
And so carbonite is a,

58
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:57,310
a wonderful way to accomplish that.

Enjoy The podcast,

70
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:23,320
ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,161
and a,

72
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:25,480
there are several more to come.

73
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:25,841
How many more?

74
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:26,674
We got left,

75
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,320
five or six left of these,

76
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:29,990
uh,

77
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,900
Saifai podcasts.

78
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,460
So with that said,

79
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,390
without further Ado,

80
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,553
ladies and gentlemen,

81
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,873
enjoy the podcast

82
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,380
experience.

83
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,960
MMM.

84
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,261
Yeah,

85
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,094
I,

86
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,890
it's certainly is possible.

87
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,180
When you look at the record
and you look at this,

88
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,220
a Homo Floresiensis,

89
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:05,230
this hobbit man from Indonesia,

90
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,680
when you look at the stories of
this thing called the Orang Pendek,

91
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,431
which is another,

92
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,030
um,

93
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,070
supposedly small hobbit,

94
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,050
like furry creature that's running around.

95
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,380
And then you hear the stories about
these gigantic [inaudible] creatures that

96
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:21,130
used to exist.

97
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,260
It's recently as a hundred
thousand years ago.

98
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,143
Yes.

99
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,230
You start going,

100
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:26,561
okay,

101
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:30,310
well there seems to have been a lot
of different kinds of primates then of

102
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:30,581
course,

103
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:31,840
is that Russian,

104
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,470
uh,

105
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,660
a ancestor of human beings.

106
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:39,250
It's found really recently that 41,000
years ago was a completely different type

107
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,970
of human,

108
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,200
was not a Neanderthal,

109
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,490
was not a homosapien.

110
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,870
It was something totally different.

111
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,350
Yeah,

112
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,210
and that's 40,000 years ago.

113
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,133
So you're,

114
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,270
it seems like as scientists
accumulate more and more evidence,

115
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:57,510
they're finding that there was a broad
variety of primates that branched off in

116
00:03:58,811 --> 00:04:03,550
a bunch of different chains and it very
well could have been that there's more

117
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,020
than one intelligent one.

118
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,180
And it wasn't just human beings.

119
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,260
It wasn't just human beings,

120
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,103
Indiana talls.

121
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,480
It wasn't just human beings.

122
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,450
Neanderthals in this new
one that Dave discovered,

123
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,930
there might have been many more.

124
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,090
The problem with fossils is it's really
hard to leave a fossil when something

125
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:19,900
dies.

126
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,321
They just,

127
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:21,250
it just rots.

128
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,810
It gets absorbed by the earth.

129
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:23,830
Bacteria eats it,

130
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,670
animals eat it.

131
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,040
That's what happens to
most of us when we die.

132
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,380
When you find a fossil,

133
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:34,381
it's because something fell into mud or
got caught in a lava field or does it

134
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,070
has to be something really
weird that happens twice.

135
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,000
I remember.

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,480
Yes.

137
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,710
It's very rare for something to last
on this planet very long after it dies.

138
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,161
Yeah,

139
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:50,161
so our view of like what used to
exist is so weird because it's,

140
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,410
it's based on such a small amount of data.

141
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,310
Really kind of incredible when you
stop and think about what they have

142
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,900
discovered used to exist,

143
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,550
especially when we're in
regards to dinosaurs and all
the different animals that

144
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,940
have been extinct for
millions and millions of years
based on just this one way

145
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,220
of acquiring the,

146
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,730
the,

147
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,100
you know,

148
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,090
evidence of their body.

149
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:13,750
A fossil.

150
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,021
Yeah.

151
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:14,621
It's amazing.

152
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:18,550
And that they can reconstruct what
they looked like with some accuracy.

153
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,840
It is fascinating,

154
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:20,141
man.

155
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:25,141
And all of this stuff has shown
me how I'm a lazy skeptic.

156
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,170
Like you know how there's people
who just believe anything.

157
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:29,291
Well,

158
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,700
there's also the opposite of that,

159
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:32,860
which is people who just
disbelieve anything,

160
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,090
they don't look into.

161
00:05:34,091 --> 00:05:34,270
Well,

162
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:34,750
why?

163
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,890
Why am I a skeptic?

164
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,730
Why don't I believe this.

165
00:05:36,731 --> 00:05:39,520
This is the thing with people
who roll their eyes at big foot.

166
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,271
And by the way,

167
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,740
after going squashing with you,

168
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,080
I've gotten a lot of eye
rolls when I tell people,

169
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:44,720
yeah,

170
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,553
maybe,

171
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:46,990
maybe there's a big foot,

172
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:48,040
but in silver lake,

173
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:48,551
yeah,

174
00:05:48,551 --> 00:05:50,780
and Silver Lake and all
you get is eyebrows.

175
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:51,970
It's like seizures.

176
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:53,410
If you tell somebody
you believe in big foot,

177
00:05:53,411 --> 00:05:55,080
it's like watching someone on ecstasy,

178
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,800
their eyes go so far back in their head.

179
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,883
But

180
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,743
I've,

181
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,890
the thing I've realized is that a
lot of people will instantly say,

182
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:04,790
I don't believe in that.

183
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,481
And you say,

184
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:05,601
well,

185
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:06,680
why don't you believe in that?

186
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,251
And they'll say,

187
00:06:07,251 --> 00:06:07,371
well,

188
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,540
because it doesn't exist.

189
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:08,901
And you say,

190
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:09,021
well,

191
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,830
why?

192
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:11,480
What's your evidence
that it doesn't exist?

193
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,314
And they don't know.

194
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,380
They have no evidence either way.

195
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,530
So I think that's an interesting
thing that I've discovered in myself,

196
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:21,380
which is that I'm an automatic skeptic.

197
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,930
When you would talk about
big foot in earlier,

198
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:26,150
podcasts are just on the
phone with me and my mind.

199
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:26,451
I'm like,

200
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,300
this is fucking horse shit.

201
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,490
Deep,

202
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,323
deep,

203
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,530
deep worship

204
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,410
with no reason to believe,

205
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:37,710
no reason to say that you,

206
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:40,610
he's having not an IG
investigated it at all,

207
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,150
having not even done a web search on it,

208
00:06:44,151 --> 00:06:46,160
like really just not
even thinking about it.

209
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,821
And now I think,

210
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:47,510
well,

211
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:47,991
you know what,

212
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,310
I think that there is,

213
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:56,380
I think that it takes something a
little bit more than fantasy to drive an

214
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:01,781
anthropologist or a scientist or someone
who only has their career to ruin out

215
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:07,541
in the forest to hunt for
a mystical monkey thing.

216
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,770
I think that there needs to,

217
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,420
there's some evidence out there that would
make a person risk his entire career,

218
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,020
uh,

219
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,170
to come out publicly saying
that he believes in big foot.

220
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,020
Yeah.

221
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,530
Well this Homo Floresiensis,

222
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,150
the,

223
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,230
the hobbit man of Indonesia,

224
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,750
just stop and think about that,

225
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:31,250
that that was in 2005 was when
they discovered these things.

226
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,380
Just stop and think about if,

227
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,850
if someone said,

228
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,680
did you know before that,

229
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,550
did you know that 13,000 years
ago there was a type of human,

230
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,760
a really tiny one that was Harry and
sneaky and maybe stole human babies and

231
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,410
made its own stone tools,

232
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,970
but didn't grow any higher
than three feet tall yet.

233
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:51,951
Get outta here.

234
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,270
But it's the St Lord of the Rings.

235
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:54,650
Like you're making things up.

236
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:54,991
Yeah,

237
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,610
go roll some d and d dice.

238
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,693
Dark,

239
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,210
dark.

240
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,260
But it was real.

241
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,820
That was a real animal.

242
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,860
I know for a fact.

243
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,960
This is a bonafide real animal.

244
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,621
Buried.

245
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,520
It's dead.

246
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,560
Lived in tribes,

247
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:12,290
made stone tools three feet.

248
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,771
What is that?

249
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:13,604
Is that like that?

250
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,720
Um,

251
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,080
well,

252
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,550
it's my penis times three.

253
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,323
Three feet.

254
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,050
Yes.

255
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:23,830
Three feet tall.

256
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,491
It was a tiny,

257
00:08:24,491 --> 00:08:25,330
tiny little guy.

258
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,523
I'm a little,

259
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:26,980
little,

260
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,300
little creature and

261
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,000
think about that to this
three foot creature.

262
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,620
It lived in a land of giants where people
would go lumbering through its forest.

263
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,940
This is a real thing.

264
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,010
This is people listening
to this right now.

265
00:08:40,011 --> 00:08:44,690
It should just Google search this to
know that tiny little hobbit men once

266
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:45,800
wandered the earth.

267
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,090
This existed.

268
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:47,690
Yes,

269
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,350
it really did.

270
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,870
And very recent discovery.

271
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:51,770
Less than a decade.

272
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,150
Some people say they still exist.

273
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:53,571
Yes.

274
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:55,530
That's the other thing that there's a,

275
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:56,580
there's reports of them,

276
00:08:56,581 --> 00:08:57,420
those islands,

277
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:57,750
there's,

278
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,830
there's so many islands in and around
that area and there are reports that these

279
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:06,300
things have been discovered on these
islands by people that have explored and

280
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:06,780
that the,

281
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,360
the local say they've seen
them and there's like,

282
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:09,721
again,

283
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:10,820
the Orang Pendek,

284
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,540
which is another tiny little hairy man
that has been reported being seen by

285
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,800
people for many,

286
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,634
many years.

287
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,300
So it's,

288
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,170
it's,

289
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:20,760
it's possible if you think of that,

290
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,300
the,

291
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,920
the,

292
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,920
the size of them and then us and then
think of a big foot and then think of an

293
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:27,750
elephant.

294
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,740
I mean there's a lot of big things and
there's a lot of little things on this

295
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:36,480
planet and just because we haven't
physically laid eyes on a big foot,

296
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,270
we physically haven't seen a Sasquatch.

297
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,970
We don't have a real good
photo or a video of it.

298
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,410
Doesn't mean it's not real.

299
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,370
It doesn't mean it's not real.

300
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:48,660
And just because many of the people who
believe in big foot are several cards

301
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,390
short of a full deck doesn't
mean it doesn't exist.

302
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,190
Just cause it crazy person says it.

303
00:09:53,191 --> 00:09:54,660
Thrill does not mean that.

304
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:55,920
It's not real sure.

305
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:56,131
I mean,

306
00:09:56,131 --> 00:09:59,720
how many crazy people were talking
about this hobbit man and their minds,

307
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,310
but I'm sure he shared a
lot of people in that area.

308
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:06,120
We're saying if there was a smarter
man to tiny little furry man,

309
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:06,670
yeah,

310
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,560
bow and Arrow,

311
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:07,971
he be like,

312
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:08,804
get Outta here bitch.

313
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,700
Man Stole my baby.

314
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,370
Yeah.

315
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:11,971
Ridiculous.

316
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:12,240
Right?

317
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,770
Nobody would ever possibly believe that.

318
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,590
No.

319
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:14,950
What,

320
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,120
what I thought was interesting about the,

321
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,460
uh,

322
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,900
the squashing,

323
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,290
first of all was that the guys who do it,

324
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,311
they,

325
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:23,880
I mean,

326
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,560
they take it really seriously.

327
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,610
Steve and John,

328
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,160
they set up camera traps.

329
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,230
They set up recording devices.

330
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:31,840
They,

331
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,380
they use thermal imaging.

332
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:34,960
They,

333
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,380
they really take it seriously.

334
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,190
And if one day out of all this searching,

335
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:45,990
if one day they actually do
stumble upon one of these things,

336
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,750
what a glorious moment
it will be for them.

337
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,150
And it'll be a glorious moment for me.

338
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:55,980
I'll go out in the street and scream and
joy if one of those guys finds pick fun

339
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:58,110
and I would really hope
it would be those guys.

340
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,371
I mean,

341
00:10:58,371 --> 00:10:59,550
even more than us.

342
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,580
I know it sounds like I'm being selfless,

343
00:11:02,581 --> 00:11:03,960
but we don't deserve it.

344
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,020
And compared to the amount of time
that those guys are putting in,

345
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:12,140
they have full time jobs and yet they
have vans that are set up for squatch and

346
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,190
with solar panels on them.

347
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,990
And they mean they have this,

348
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:18,840
all these different pieces of technology,

349
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:23,870
camera traps and time lapse
photography things and audio recorders.

350
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:24,990
I mean,

351
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,823
they really,

352
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,460
you know,

353
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,701
they're,

354
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:27,600
they're really trying,

355
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,530
they're dedicated.

356
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,000
And we need people like that.

357
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,660
Look,

358
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,200
you're not going to get the most sane
people going out into the woods to look

359
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:34,950
for bigfoot.

360
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,730
That's hill.

361
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,563
Some evidence,

362
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,150
and then it'll be swarmed
with real scientists.

363
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,190
But if something happens and they
actually get some concrete evidence where

364
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:44,850
people are like,

365
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,750
oh my God,

366
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,440
it's,

367
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,700
we're dealing with a real animal,

368
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,810
then you're going to have teams of real
scientists that are in the woods and

369
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:52,950
those guys will get arrested.

370
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,070
He's like,

371
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:54,440
Oh yeah,

372
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:54,881
you know what?

373
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:55,990
They'll get in the way of the thing.

374
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:59,020
They'll quarantine the whole area and
all those guys will get hauled off.

375
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,520
But I will say this,

376
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,740
you know whether or
not there's a big foot,

377
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,730
if you want to turn a boring camping
trip and do a fun camping trip,

378
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:10,210
just gotten to the woods and
pretend that you're looking for big.

379
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,580
It's,

380
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,530
it's the renaissance fair of camping.

381
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,850
It's like go out there.

382
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,830
Just believed in the possibility that
there could be a big foot and start

383
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:25,020
walking through the forest
smoke some powerful Rogan.

384
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,270
We'd,

385
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,500
we probably can't talk about that,

386
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,053
but if you go,

387
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,920
I think that there is,

388
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:34,300
I think that squashing is the
renaissance fair of camping.

389
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,360
It's an imaginary way that you can turn
a boring camping trip into a thing that

390
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,670
has the potential to transform
human history forever.

391
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,840
And conversely,

392
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,160
if you go squashing and you're
unsuccessful at the very least,

393
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,150
you went camping,

394
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,081
you went camping,

395
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:54,130
you can't lose.

396
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,160
You went camping.

397
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:56,800
And I remember when I was a kid,

398
00:12:56,801 --> 00:12:59,800
like when my parents would drag me
out in the forest to go camping,

399
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,570
I'd rather eat cyanide.

400
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:03,310
I wanted to sit in front of the TV,

401
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,301
watch TV,

402
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:04,791
be inside.

403
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06,550
I didn't want to go out into nature.

404
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,610
I didn't realize how pretty
nature was until I'd take an acid.

405
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,690
But when,

406
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,020
if my parents had told me we're
going to look for bigfoot,

407
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:17,290
that would've gotten me out
of the house in a second.

408
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,720
It's a great way to go hiking.

409
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,600
That's the bottom line.

410
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,810
Squashing turns nature into a fun house

411
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,580
and all the wood knocking and all the uh,

412
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:30,861
the,

413
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:34,300
the different Howell's that
they do that sort of like,

414
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,970
it makes it like a fun game.

415
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,020
The gifting stump,

416
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:38,950
the gifting stuff.

417
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:43,510
And also the other thing about those two
that it showed me is how easy it is to

418
00:13:43,511 --> 00:13:44,410
start a religion.

419
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,650
How easy it is to take a being that you
really have no evidence for and begin to

420
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:53,890
find evidence for it and things
that naturally occur in nature.

421
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,720
If you can't find a big foot,

422
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,790
if you can't find real
evidence of big foot,

423
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,900
you know what you can do.

424
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:04,050
You can attribute a feather in the path
to big foot having left something there.

425
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,190
If you can't find big foot,

426
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,113
you know what you can do.

427
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,320
You can say ravens are being sent by
big foot to watch you in the forest.

428
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:14,020
There's so many things
that happen naturally.

429
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,640
The sound of birds,

430
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,000
the sound of something falling out
of a tree that sounds like a knock.

431
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,360
Branches that have fallen
together in some certain way.

432
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,560
I hear it all right now.

433
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:23,851
Yeah,

434
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:24,190
it's,

435
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:27,820
it's easy and that's the exact same
thing that religious people do with God.

436
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:30,940
They've got this nonexistent being
that they have no evidence for.

437
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,620
A volcano explodes.

438
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,750
God is angry.

439
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,130
The rain doesn't come.

440
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:36,910
That's God.

441
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:37,721
The rain comes.

442
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:39,010
We've been blessed by God.

443
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:39,741
You know what?

444
00:14:39,741 --> 00:14:44,410
One of the 200 told me what
this is essentially verbatim.

445
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,513
He said,

446
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,850
I was out near this blackberry Bush
and I started hearing this bull and I

447
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,611
was like,

448
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:56,570
what is a bull frog doing
near a blackberry Bush?

449
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,950
And I thought about it.

450
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:58,490
Lane Alley.

451
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,323
You know what?

452
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,430
I bet that was a Sasquatch.

453
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,020
Exactly.

454
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:03,801
Exactly.

455
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,371
A bull frog.

456
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:05,540
He said it to my face.

457
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,610
Yeah,

458
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:06,950
like,

459
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,600
like not like he was testing me,

460
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,181
you know,

461
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:09,651
he wasn't,

462
00:15:09,651 --> 00:15:10,850
he wasn't being silly.

463
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,350
He wasn't pranking me.

464
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:12,580
No,

465
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,390
he wasn't seeing how far he could take it.

466
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,890
He actually said it to my face.

467
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,843
That's amazing.

468
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,920
And it's incredible when you realize
that priests are scratching for God.

469
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,143
Amazing.

470
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,390
They are a squash and forgot
and there's even less evidence.

471
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,140
Oh yeah.

472
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:33,490
Less evidence for God and there is for
big foot at least they have like gigantic

473
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,290
Pythagoras bones as if they had God's
big toe in a factory somewhere or in a,

474
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,320
in a museum somewhere in the Vatican.

475
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,500
A giant mystical toenail.

476
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,610
A giant God,

477
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:44,444
big toe.

478
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,520
And God for sure there was a god that
lived as recently as a hundred thousand

479
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,760
years ago.

480
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,593
Yeah.

481
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,523
Wow.

482
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,410
Big Foot is more realistic and religion.

483
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,611
Yeah.

484
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:57,600
There should be building
cathedrals to big foot.

485
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,890
I'd go to that church.

486
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,260
I go to the Church of
the squatch and a second.

487
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,250
Yeah,

488
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:07,020
it's all just would dock in and how Olin,

489
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,440
that was one thing that bobcat
Goldthwait film got right.

490
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,543
The Howells,

491
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,660
they're pretty bad ass.

492
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:16,871
Yeah,

493
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:17,050
no,

494
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,170
that was really cool man.

495
00:16:18,171 --> 00:16:19,930
And I don't want to give away the ending,

496
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:21,070
but that was really cool,

497
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:21,281
man.

498
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:21,430
Yeah,

499
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,370
that last little part,

500
00:16:22,371 --> 00:16:23,470
it was pretty bad ass.

501
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,450
I had to press pause a few times,

502
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,740
so that was so cool.

503
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,860
I love the fact that Bobcat
Goldthwait is such a big foot nut.

504
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:30,941
Look,

505
00:16:30,941 --> 00:16:31,290
that's a,

506
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,790
that's another interesting
thing about big foot man.

507
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,350
It is a black hole.

508
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,800
It's a slippery slope.

509
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,600
Big Foot has gravity because once you
open yourself up to the small potentiality

510
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,410
a big foot,

511
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,680
you'll find your mind wandering
their weird parts of the day.

512
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,190
Just like

513
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:46,790
fuck.

514
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,300
And it's also like gambling where you
go to a slot machine and you think,

515
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,020
man,

516
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,910
one more quarter could do it.

517
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,740
I know I'm down 1000 bucks,

518
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:59,420
but one more quarter and I could hit
the jackpot this next squatch and chip.

519
00:16:59,421 --> 00:16:59,571
Look,

520
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:01,910
I know I'm getting divorced
and I know I'm in debt,

521
00:17:01,911 --> 00:17:04,940
but this one last squatch and trip,

522
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:05,660
I'm gonna,

523
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,493
I'm gonna,

524
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,160
I'm gonna sell some stocks and I'm going
to go out there and I'm going to just

525
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,450
put it all on the line.

526
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,920
A two weeks squash and trip.

527
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:14,180
I'm going to get to the bottom of this,

528
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,440
change the world.

529
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:16,701
And also man,

530
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:17,510
I'll tell you,

531
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,560
there is a,

532
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:19,161
what's it called?

533
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:23,600
There's animistic religions that believe
that a spirit exists in every living

534
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:23,901
thing.

535
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,670
So trees have their own spirit,

536
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,590
leaves have their own spirit.

537
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:28,461
This is like a,

538
00:17:28,461 --> 00:17:33,080
a very old way of looking at nature
is to see the thing is a living being

539
00:17:33,081 --> 00:17:38,081
instead of just biology happening to
see it as one giant non-differentiated

540
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,100
living being.

541
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,260
And so there's always been
embodiments of the forest.

542
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,220
If you look at mythology,

543
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:44,180
you have pan,

544
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:46,520
you have the Jack and
the Jack of the woods,

545
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:50,760
which is this being that lives out in
the and as an embodiment of nature.

546
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,091
Well,

547
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,350
maybe that's what big foot is.

548
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,170
Maybe there's something built
into the human psyche that we,

549
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,430
when we get out in nature,

550
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
we project some thing out into the woods,

551
00:17:59,521 --> 00:18:03,360
some human personification
of the wildness of life,

552
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:04,650
the wildness of nature.

553
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,080
Something that maybe we
lost a long time ago,

554
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,760
and that's what big foot is.

555
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:13,140
It's just this thing that human beings
long for their reminds us of the time

556
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,910
when we did you still live in the forest?

557
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,980
We used to be big foot.

558
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,750
That's what's wild about it.

559
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:21,900
We used to be this thing
existing in nature,

560
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:25,740
depending on foraging and
finding fish in the streams.

561
00:18:25,741 --> 00:18:26,640
That was us.

562
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:30,030
So maybe that's what people see
when they're looking for bigfoot.

563
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,650
They see what we used to be.

564
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,190
That's a great point because when
you're out there in the woods,

565
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:37,080
like the Pacific northwest,

566
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:41,670
it's so just lush and rich
and filled with wildlife.

567
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:42,570
You start thinking,

568
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,610
could I exist out here?

569
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,330
If I was separate from society and
civilization and grocery stores and

570
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,100
automobiles and gas stations,

571
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,370
could I keep my body alive out here?

572
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:54,870
And I'm not sure if I could,

573
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,091
you know I've,

574
00:18:56,091 --> 00:18:59,940
I've watched that show survivor man
where he goes out into the woods and that

575
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:04,941
guy is an expert survivalists and he
scratches buy for five or six days before

576
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,800
they eventually rescue him.

577
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,220
Yep.

578
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,090
And if,

579
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,520
if it wasn't for those rescue people,

580
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,560
eventually he would starve to death
and he's an expert survivalist just,

581
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:17,640
and he's got tools.

582
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:22,370
He's got like a pocket knife usually or
something that he can find and share it

583
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,070
together.

584
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,020
If you're by yourself naked,

585
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,110
like big foot

586
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,600
or think about your French bulldog,

587
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,110
imagine taking your French bulldog and
dropping your French bulldog off in the

588
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:35,260
middle of the Adirondacks.

589
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:39,730
How long would that French bulldog
survive without its wet food and it's chew

590
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:40,660
toys maybe,

591
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,720
maybe two hours before that thing gets
sucked up like a sandwich at a carnival,

592
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,810
that thing would be dead in a second.

593
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,940
And that used to be a wolf.

594
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,660
If you trace that genie,

595
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,260
the gene line of the French
bulldog all the way back,

596
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,440
you get a wild wolf and nothing that can
exist just fine out in nature is just

597
00:20:02,141 --> 00:20:03,580
find out there on the same way.

598
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:04,630
That's what we are.

599
00:20:04,631 --> 00:20:05,710
We made a trade off,

600
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,280
you know,

601
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,540
we lost our fur,

602
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:11,770
we lost the having tough feet and tough
hands and being able to climb trees.

603
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:15,610
That's the big trade off so that we
can sit and play x box and enjoy air

604
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,151
conditioning.

605
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:16,984
We lost it.

606
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:17,883
It's true,

607
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,270
but we used to be that we used to be big
foot and I think there's a thing inside

608
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,790
everybody that longs for that time.

609
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,720
If you trace big foot,

610
00:20:26,721 --> 00:20:31,721
if you trace like the early hominids and
you go all the way forward to some fat

611
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:35,960
kid on Prozac sitting on the
couch playing call of duty.

612
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:36,530
Yeah,

613
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:36,950
that,

614
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,840
that's the same as a French bulldog.

615
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:39,201
Yeah.

616
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:40,760
If you could show a wolf,

617
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,620
this is what you're going to become

618
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,940
something they can barely breathe.

619
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:45,811
Breathe.

620
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:46,644
It's so

621
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,531
far.

622
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,840
It's all the time lies on
its belly and just fart.

623
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,660
What's a walking whoopee cushion.

624
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,810
It just farts and can't breathe.

625
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:01,600
Used to be a wolf roaming the wild.

626
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:01,811
Yeah.

627
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,580
Now it's not protecting your house.

628
00:21:03,581 --> 00:21:04,660
It's not doing anything.

629
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:07,150
Now it's barely able to stay alive,

630
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,840
barely.

631
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,430
And you have to feed it and pick it up.

632
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,290
Pick it up to put it on the couch.

633
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,370
I want one man.

634
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,330
I've been looking for,

635
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,000
I want a squatch,

636
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,441
a mini squat,

637
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:19,330
you know a big one.

638
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:19,441
I mean,

639
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,890
I just having a squash in your backyard.

640
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,950
Nobody would ever try to break
in your house except the squatch.

641
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:24,491
Yeah,

642
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:25,324
we just feed them.

643
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,770
That would be an,

644
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,371
I would not,

645
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:28,660
you would do that by the way.

646
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:29,231
You would do that.

647
00:21:29,231 --> 00:21:31,720
You've got like a pack of deadly pimples.

648
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,140
I remember when you bought all
those dogs and I ain't going to,

649
00:21:34,141 --> 00:21:37,930
your house is terrifying and
you've got to play it cool.

650
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,780
Like you're not scared of
your giant death hounds.

651
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,460
My dog is a nice,

652
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,600
I don't have those dogs anymore.

653
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,380
Well,

654
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,213
what happened?

655
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,660
Didn't they all eat each other?

656
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,583
Well,

657
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,713
she fights.

658
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:49,983
Shit went wrong.

659
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,630
They ate each other.

660
00:21:52,631 --> 00:21:53,890
One killed a couple of them

661
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,020
killed,

662
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,590
one of the other one
killed a couple of cats.

663
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,060
Man,

664
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,890
that was terrifying going to your house,

665
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:00,191
man.

666
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,001
That was scary.

667
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:02,110
When you got those dogs,

668
00:22:02,111 --> 00:22:03,020
there's mastiffs,

669
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,940
those deadly,

670
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,760
massive,

671
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,593
massive suite.

672
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:06,400
He's not worry.

673
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,610
You don't have to worry about the master.

674
00:22:07,611 --> 00:22:08,650
If it's the pit bulls,

675
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,630
no Mascara.

676
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,290
You don't have to worry about
the pit bulls or the massive,

677
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,050
but if you get two stone
dogs can tell that you're,

678
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:21,911
it's true,

679
00:22:21,911 --> 00:22:22,091
man.

680
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:26,110
I went to my friend's house recently
and I'd eaten a little piece of this

681
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:26,980
chocolate bar.

682
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,120
I went to Johnny Pemberton's house and I
was like still stone and paranoid and I

683
00:22:31,121 --> 00:22:32,860
went to his house and I walked in.

684
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,900
He's got just a puppy and I walk in.

685
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:36,520
I'm so paranoid that puppy looks at me.

686
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,354
He's like,

687
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,750
cause I'm scared as and sheer sweating.

688
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,510
You have like a layer of sweat slime,

689
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,760
losing a few like a fish.

690
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,033
It's just

691
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,940
shitting your pants and fear of a puppy.

692
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,410
I've got that southern lawyer,

693
00:22:56,411 --> 00:22:57,244
armpits

694
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,880
today deal,

695
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,650
Tia and then,

696
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:02,981
yeah,

697
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:06,070
nothing that only amplifies the paranoid.

698
00:23:06,071 --> 00:23:08,770
I have a puppy that hates
you because now you're like,

699
00:23:08,771 --> 00:23:09,970
what's it see inside of me,

700
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,480
I'm going to see that sees
the darkness that knows it,

701
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,990
knows him a piece of
shit and it starts here.

702
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,290
Your,

703
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,123
you know,

704
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,660
your self critical parts to
start analyzing your own life.

705
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:21,040
And I'm like,

706
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,311
man,

707
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,770
it's knows I gotta pay
my gates or knows I suck.

708
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,560
Knows about my tax problem

709
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:31,603
off

710
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,430
in a massage parlor.

711
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,360
The dog doesn't like it.

712
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:35,131
Hates it.

713
00:23:35,131 --> 00:23:35,710
And then dude,

714
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,690
that is fine with a puppy.

715
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,700
But when you've got a
drop in a massage parlor,

716
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,391
yeah,

717
00:23:40,391 --> 00:23:41,080
that's fine.

718
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,740
The dog sees no problem with that.

719
00:23:42,741 --> 00:23:43,574
It's a human issue,

720
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,260
right?

721
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,621
Yeah.

722
00:23:44,621 --> 00:23:46,010
Anybody can pet a dog and jerk

723
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:46,880
it off and they don't.

724
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,043
They don't care.

725
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,310
The dog would like it.

726
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:49,511
Yeah.

727
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,540
If you can pet a dog,

728
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:51,500
he'll let you jerk him off.

729
00:23:51,501 --> 00:23:53,060
Dogs are notorious sluts.

730
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:53,931
Oh,

731
00:23:53,931 --> 00:23:54,830
there's entire,

732
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:55,664
hold on a second.

733
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,063
What are you doing man?

734
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,800
Do you know what you're doing here?

735
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,000
Do you know what show you're on?

736
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,220
We just missed this shit
would have been precious,

737
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:07,461
man.

738
00:24:07,461 --> 00:24:10,060
This would have been prime
time jerking off dogs,

739
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,210
son of a bitch.

740
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:11,830
You ruined everything.

741
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,220
Talking about jerking off dogs,

742
00:24:13,221 --> 00:24:14,840
something unusable completely.

743
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,273
Okay.

744
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:16,820
Okay.

745
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,653
Um,

746
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,740
let's just wrap this up.

747
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,633
The,

748
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,010
the squashing was very fun.

749
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,341
The I,

750
00:24:22,341 --> 00:24:25,140
the idea behind it is
very interesting and uh,

751
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,420
I,

752
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,380
I remain open.

753
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:31,010
I give myself a tiny
window of possibility.

754
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:35,360
I may be a 10% possibility that there's
a Sasquatch really alive out there.

755
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,100
But as far as my hope,

756
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,180
my hopes and dreams,

757
00:24:38,181 --> 00:24:41,510
it's 100% of my hopes
have 100% hope and dreams.

758
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:41,841
I mean,

759
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,550
it's not something that I've abandoned,

760
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,630
but the reality of the situations bleak.

761
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,880
I think it's a bleak situation,

762
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:54,300
but I don't think it's as bleak as I
thought it was when I first went into it.

763
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:55,950
And that's to me,

764
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:56,850
very exciting.

765
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,570
What made you change your mind at all?

766
00:24:58,571 --> 00:25:00,100
What made you expand the possibilities?

767
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:00,530
Meldrum

768
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:00,741
yeah,

769
00:25:00,741 --> 00:25:03,650
talking to Meldrum because
when he started explaining,

770
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,520
uh,

771
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,710
the footage that you hate,

772
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,740
but he started explaining why
the thing would walk like that.

773
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:14,090
And then when he started explaining how
these footprints are very detailed and

774
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:15,020
then um,

775
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:21,310
when I put that together
with the information that we
found that there are these

776
00:25:21,891 --> 00:25:23,780
little people that used to exist.

777
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,440
And then the thing with this ground ground
parrot that just showed up out of the

778
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:31,100
blue and all the new creatures that show
up out of the blue from time to time,

779
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:36,370
I just realized that it was very
prideful of me to just bugle out there,

780
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,063
no big foot.

781
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,000
I realized that for me to say that was
as unscientific as it was for me to say

782
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:44,990
that there is a big foot.

783
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,520
So I live in the mystery.

784
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:46,870
Okay.

785
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,650
Live in the mystery Dunkin Trust.

786
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,240
Yeah.

787
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,350
Live in the ministry.

788
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,770
I think they're going to wrap it up.

789
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,833
Aliens

790
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,620
does an alien.

791
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,480
The Sky above us.

792
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,373
Yeah.

793
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,780
Is Mexican without a green card.

794
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,083
That is weird.

795
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,330
They fly over.

796
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,313
I Dunno.

797
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:11,120
Huh?

798
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,210
Why don't Mexicans Flyover?

799
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,923
Don't have plans.

800
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:14,991
No,

801
00:26:14,991 --> 00:26:17,330
but it seems like he's like,

802
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,360
you could get one is easy if you
get like one of those buses maybe.

803
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,460
But I think they monitor airspace pretty,

804
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:26,570
pretty closely.

805
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,340
All right.

806
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,600
Yeah.

807
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,080
You don't want to get shot out
of the sky by the federal A's.

808
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,151
It's weird.

809
00:26:32,151 --> 00:26:33,200
That's fucking tunnels,

810
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:33,480
man.

811
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,313
Yeah.

812
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,390
It's interesting that we call people
from other countries aliens too.

813
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,290
Yes.

814
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,000
You know they're illegal aliens.

815
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,950
There's outer space
aliens and then there's,

816
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:49,110
but everyone who's not like your
country neighbor is an alien.

817
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:50,371
Yeah,

818
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,060
that's right.

819
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,140
Canadians are aliens.

820
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:52,830
Yeah.

821
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,050
It's so stupid because they're humans.

822
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,860
Like we act as though there's
some different being all together.

823
00:26:58,861 --> 00:26:59,970
That's an old idea.

824
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,400
You know that if someone
isn't from your country,

825
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,080
they might not even be human.

826
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,880
They just look human.

827
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:06,481
Well,

828
00:27:06,481 --> 00:27:06,611
the,

829
00:27:06,611 --> 00:27:11,190
as the idea of calling them
aliens or alien to this area,

830
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:13,200
like an alien species,

831
00:27:13,201 --> 00:27:14,850
it's been dropped into a lake,

832
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,710
like the snakehead fish.

833
00:27:16,711 --> 00:27:18,210
That's been devastating.

834
00:27:18,211 --> 00:27:19,850
These freshwater lakes because yeah.

835
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:23,460
It's like so hardy and eats
everything and destroys everything.

836
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,761
Yeah.

837
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:26,160
Kind of like what the white
people did in North America.

838
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,030
We're aliens.

839
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,361
Yeah.

840
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,350
We're the aliens,

841
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,010
but the American Indians
were aliens as well.

842
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,840
Native Americans came from Asia.

843
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:34,501
Yeah.

844
00:27:34,501 --> 00:27:38,940
And the people in Asia came from Africa
and the people in Africa came from Maki

845
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:41,820
monkeys and the monkeys came
from single celled organisms.

846
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,091
Yeah.

847
00:27:42,091 --> 00:27:45,750
Which came from bacteria steroid
that smashed into the earth.

848
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:46,980
So we are aliens.

849
00:27:46,981 --> 00:27:47,814
Everyone's an alien.

850
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,330
Yeah.

851
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,070
Well if you follow that logic,

852
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:50,490
yeah.

853
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,130
Every single living thing is alien.

854
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,690
Because if that's,

855
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:59,490
if panspermia that theory of amino
acids and the building blocks of life

856
00:27:59,491 --> 00:28:03,810
existing and asteroids and then landing
and earth after they slam into another

857
00:28:03,811 --> 00:28:04,161
plan.

858
00:28:04,161 --> 00:28:04,590
Yeah,

859
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,430
it's really interesting.

860
00:28:05,431 --> 00:28:09,270
It's like a game of life leap
frog all throughout the galaxy,

861
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:10,530
all the way back to the big bang.

862
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,480
You don't even need the media or smashing.

863
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,620
I mean the earth is alien.

864
00:28:13,621 --> 00:28:18,060
The earth came from some interstellar
dust that congealed at some point.

865
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:18,870
It's,

866
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,850
it all goes back to some flash of light.

867
00:28:21,851 --> 00:28:23,550
So billions of miles away,

868
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:24,870
billions of miles away.

869
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,441
So yeah,

870
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:26,670
we are aliens now.

871
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:30,170
The way that our spaceship works might
be different from the white space.

872
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,070
Ships work on Star Trek,

873
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:35,970
the way our spaceship works as it
grows food and it grows people.

874
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,210
That's our space.

875
00:28:37,211 --> 00:28:37,860
And we,

876
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,800
the space ship itself
produces the life form.

877
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,050
But to,

878
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,051
oh,

879
00:28:43,051 --> 00:28:43,291
sorry,

880
00:28:43,291 --> 00:28:43,590
go ahead.

881
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,040
Well to,

882
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:49,040
but to look at the wild insanity of
where we came from and then to be like,

883
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:50,221
oh no,

884
00:28:50,221 --> 00:28:50,301
no,

885
00:28:50,301 --> 00:28:50,460
no,

886
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,300
there's no aliens.

887
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,460
Couldn't be not nothing out there.

888
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,050
That's madness.

889
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,080
If life emerged from the congealed
dust particulates that came from the

890
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,670
explosion of stars and the spinning,

891
00:29:05,671 --> 00:29:10,671
the centrifuge action of this ball like
thing was able to spit eventually to

892
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:15,030
spit pinkies and brownies
out of the thing,

893
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,043
then God,

894
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:16,883
people,

895
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,560
there are many colors of people.

896
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,680
But to think that just that if our
planet is able to produce life just from

897
00:29:24,781 --> 00:29:27,090
spinning really fast around a star,

898
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:31,050
to think that this isn't happening in
other parts of an infinite universe is

899
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:31,800
madness.

900
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:36,540
And then the real mind fuck is the idea
that our planet spawns this intelligent

901
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:41,541
creature that's insanely curious and
eventually starts playing with nuclear and

902
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,370
then anti

903
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,610
matter and then figures out
how to make a big bang machine.

904
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,530
And then one day one of them just goes,

905
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:47,951
fuck it.

906
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:48,730
I'll press it.

907
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,070
And he hits a button and boom,

908
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:55,210
the whole universe implodes back down
into the size of the head of a pin and

909
00:29:55,211 --> 00:30:00,211
explodes out again in a totally new big
bang every 14 15 billion years or so.

910
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:01,921
Yeah,

911
00:30:01,921 --> 00:30:03,480
and this is not that idea.

912
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:07,410
That idea is written about in the
couponing shots and the Vedas.

913
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:08,640
This is something they write about it.

914
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:09,760
They say that Brahmin,

915
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:14,430
it's a compared to an inhalation and
an exhalation that the universe is a

916
00:30:14,431 --> 00:30:19,431
breathing thing and that sometimes the
universe expands itself in this infinite

917
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,630
outward breath and in that outward breath
all created beings form which are a

918
00:30:24,631 --> 00:30:28,700
differentiation of this unit if field
of consciousness and then there's the

919
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:33,450
inbreath where everything comes back in
and forms back to that head of the pen

920
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,010
that science has.

921
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:36,330
The Big Bang is of course,

922
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,420
you know there are is
new ideas about that.

923
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,840
The whole head of the pan idea,

924
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,910
the condensed super particle that
they say created the big bang.

925
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:48,680
A lot of people wonder if
that's the case or if maybe a,

926
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,720
the big bang is the effect of one
universe brushing up against a universe.

927
00:30:54,211 --> 00:30:56,580
And poking into it and creating,

928
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,360
uh,

929
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,700
the outreach of matter.

930
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:00,990
That is the big bang.

931
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,100
We really don't know.

932
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:02,461
Yeah,

933
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,690
that's a fascinating one.

934
00:31:03,691 --> 00:31:08,000
The idea that there's parallel
universes like bubble baths that like,

935
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,311
you know,

936
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:12,240
the little circles in a bubble bath but
there infinite and each one of them is

937
00:31:12,241 --> 00:31:17,241
its own self contained universe and they
collide and they're just millimeters

938
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
from each other,

939
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,270
millimeters from the other university.

940
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,133
Then they,

941
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,623
Ooh,

942
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,740
they collide and that's
her creates all the energy.

943
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,190
Yeah.

944
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,110
That's what it is,

945
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:30,500
is just an endless transfer of
energy from universe to universe.

946
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:31,071
Yeah.

947
00:31:31,071 --> 00:31:31,700
That's,

948
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,481
that's what it is.

949
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:37,070
Just this giant living cluster of bubbles,

950
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,970
pea brains,

951
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:43,230
the idea of the universe itself
being semi infant or infinite or,

952
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:43,770
or,

953
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,730
or fractal,

954
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,660
the idea of there being infinite
amount of infinite universes.

955
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,591
It's just,

956
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:49,921
it's,

957
00:31:49,921 --> 00:31:52,980
it's too hard to wrap our heads
around the fact that well,

958
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,770
it all also might be breathing.

959
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,180
It might be going out,

960
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,850
expanding and then contracting.

961
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,210
Yeah.

962
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,043
For Infinity.

963
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,481
Yeah.

964
00:32:01,481 --> 00:32:03,280
And that thing that
you were talking about,

965
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:03,491
the,

966
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:05,500
the way that we explore,

967
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:10,360
the way that we have this desire to
understand and to investigate and examine

968
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:10,781
did.

969
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:12,550
That's the original impulse.

970
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:16,810
It's just that impulse is being channeled
through our particular neurology's,

971
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:19,480
but that impulse is in all living things.

972
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:24,481
That desire to experience and to explore
and to learn that this is this giant

973
00:32:26,021 --> 00:32:31,021
massive bubble cluster of intelligence
is God trying to understand what the fuck

974
00:32:32,981 --> 00:32:36,450
is happening because everybody acts
like God knows everything already.

975
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:36,950
Just think so.

976
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:37,571
If it's God,

977
00:32:37,571 --> 00:32:38,321
it knows everything.

978
00:32:38,321 --> 00:32:39,020
Why?

979
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,580
Maybe it's just like us only a trillion
billion to the trillion squared,

980
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:48,900
a times more aware and even
that much more confused.

981
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:49,961
Well,

982
00:32:49,961 --> 00:32:51,070
how about one grader?

983
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:56,050
How about whence intelligent life
eventually reaches a point where it can

984
00:32:56,051 --> 00:33:01,030
control all matter and has access to all
the knowledge in the universe itself.

985
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,990
Maybe it becomes God and maybe that's
what God is in the first place.

986
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:06,820
And maybe this coalescence,

987
00:33:06,821 --> 00:33:11,230
this sin synergistic thing
that's happening right now
with humans and technology

988
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,250
is because technology is the only way
we can ask you actually become God

989
00:33:15,251 --> 00:33:16,270
biologically,

990
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,320
is that we have to figure out a way to
manipulate matter to the point where we

991
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:25,270
take what we call consciousness and
put it into something that can develop

992
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,240
infinitely faster than
our simple biology can.

993
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:32,140
And that that in turn becomes
a universal consciousness.

994
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,160
And that that is the origins
of the universal consciousness
is not just that we

995
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:39,220
share space and that we
share this morphic field,

996
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,430
but in fact that all of our minds will
eventually join as one super mind.

997
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:50,230
And that super mind will
be the very creator of the
universe that has spawned us

998
00:33:50,231 --> 00:33:50,880
itself.

999
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,450
Yes.

1000
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:55,900
And that will be some 14 year old squid
alien playing a super advanced x box

1001
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,250
going off on top of a windmill.

1002
00:33:57,430 --> 00:33:58,263
Yeah.

1003
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,080
And that's all folks.

1004
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:03,430
No,

1005
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,701
man,

1006
00:34:03,701 --> 00:34:03,961
I,

1007
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:04,420
I that,

1008
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,253
that um,

1009
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,760
that idea is really cool.

1010
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,370
This is an idea Alan Watts
talks about when he says,

1011
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:14,610
imagine if you could experience everything
like imagine if you were some kind of

1012
00:34:14,771 --> 00:34:16,960
godlike being in anything
that you could think.

1013
00:34:16,961 --> 00:34:19,120
You can instantly create
anything you want to do,

1014
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:19,954
experience.

1015
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,490
You could instantly experience.

1016
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:23,920
If you wanted to know what
it was like to be everything,

1017
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:28,030
you could feel that if you wanted to know
what it was like to be an alien flying

1018
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:28,631
through space,

1019
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:29,470
exploring space,

1020
00:34:29,471 --> 00:34:30,221
you could be that,

1021
00:34:30,221 --> 00:34:31,090
but eventually,

1022
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:34,060
eventually Alan Watts says,

1023
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:37,540
you would get so bored of being able
to do anything you wanted to do,

1024
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,560
that you would be like,

1025
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,393
hm,

1026
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,550
I wonder what it's like to not
know that I can do everything.

1027
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,120
I wonder what it's like to think I'm
going to die and be completely limited.

1028
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,200
And then that's when he turned into a
human being and that's when you get it

1029
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:51,400
because of the experience.

1030
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:52,061
Human life,

1031
00:34:52,061 --> 00:34:52,331
we're like,

1032
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:52,631
Whoa,

1033
00:34:52,631 --> 00:34:52,901
fuck,

1034
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:53,740
I'm going to die.

1035
00:34:53,741 --> 00:34:54,580
You can't do anything,

1036
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:55,210
man.

1037
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,020
Oh God.

1038
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,600
And then when you die or
when this event happens,

1039
00:34:58,601 --> 00:35:01,600
where everything unifies them
becomes one consciousness,

1040
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:02,660
that's when you wake up again.

1041
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:02,891
I'm like,

1042
00:35:02,891 --> 00:35:03,724
wow,

1043
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,530
that was nuts.

1044
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,090
I thought I was going to die.

1045
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:08,440
I thought I was limited.

1046
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:10,030
I thought I was an individual.

1047
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:11,350
I thought I was singular.

1048
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,430
As it turns out,

1049
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,680
I'm everything and the whole
cycle starts over again.

1050
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,200
What I found fascinating in
researching aliens and in,

1051
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,350
in doing the show is the different
attitudes about what aliens would be

1052
00:35:23,361 --> 00:35:26,300
interested in and what aliens
wouldn't be interested in.

1053
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,570
I,

1054
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,070
the guy I talked to from Seti,

1055
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,340
he seemed to believe that they wouldn't
even care about the fact that we have

1056
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:32,240
nuclear power.

1057
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:36,560
Like why would the aliens hover over
nuclear power and other people think that

1058
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:37,980
that would the number one

1059
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,840
thing they would concentrate on
and then other people think the,

1060
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:41,300
well they had,

1061
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,010
they would have access
to stop all that stuff.

1062
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:47,580
They can control all the power and
they are essentially waiting for us.

1063
00:35:47,730 --> 00:35:49,350
This is like the most utopian concept.

1064
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:49,610
Yeah.

1065
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,750
They're waiting for us to graduate.

1066
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,960
So a our society and civilization
stops being this fear mongering warlike

1067
00:35:57,301 --> 00:36:02,301
culture and we graduate to this next
level of spiritual evolution and join the

1068
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,920
Galactic Federation that we become worthy.

1069
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:10,620
And then they're sitting there
waiting for us to graduate from

1070
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,320
high school.

1071
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,501
Oh,

1072
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:12,370
I love that.

1073
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,630
That's really cool man.

1074
00:36:13,631 --> 00:36:14,140
Like,

1075
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,130
like they're gardeners,

1076
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:15,830
you know,

1077
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,500
they're like planetary gardeners and
that human species is a form of biomass

1078
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,000
that they like to cultivate.

1079
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,860
And sometimes the garden grows,

1080
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,300
sometimes it doesn't grow,

1081
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,740
but it's some point,

1082
00:36:26,741 --> 00:36:30,580
the thing inevitably gets to a place where
it's about to blossom and that's when

1083
00:36:30,581 --> 00:36:32,830
it's at its most fragile point in time,

1084
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:37,390
that place where it's about to grow
the flowers of the singularity or the

1085
00:36:37,391 --> 00:36:40,000
flowers of some super advanced technology.

1086
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,140
And when that happens,

1087
00:36:41,141 --> 00:36:46,141
that's the joining of the Galactic
Federation that they is a new age crystal.

1088
00:36:46,151 --> 00:36:47,040
People talk about,

1089
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,610
I think that's a beautiful idea.

1090
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,910
I think it's a beautiful
idea and I think that I,

1091
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,470
I don't see why not.

1092
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:55,600
I mean we grow flowers,

1093
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,320
we,

1094
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,730
we cultivate the earth,

1095
00:36:57,731 --> 00:37:00,070
we breed animals.

1096
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:04,900
Why wouldn't some super
advanced intelligence take
the light and turning monkeys

1097
00:37:04,901 --> 00:37:09,901
into flying teleporting
super technological beings.

1098
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,220
Yeah.

1099
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:16,220
And W we also have this thing where
we want results like right away.

1100
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:16,921
You know,

1101
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:18,570
we want things to happen right now.

1102
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,520
Why don't the aliens land now?

1103
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,190
Why don't people get
it together right away?

1104
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,680
Why do we have to continue our,

1105
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:25,951
our,

1106
00:37:25,951 --> 00:37:28,680
our primitive ways and
our primitive culture?

1107
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,060
But if you thought about it from
the standpoint of an infinite being,

1108
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:37,530
the why would the infinite being want
to rush things as all the time in the

1109
00:37:37,531 --> 00:37:37,861
world?

1110
00:37:37,861 --> 00:37:40,200
Like why does it need
the results right away.

1111
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,220
Exactly.

1112
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:42,150
And isn't there.

1113
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,580
This isn't their joy in,

1114
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,760
in the the struggle and this isn't their
joy in the whole process of becoming

1115
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,670
this,

1116
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,110
this symbiotic,

1117
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,370
this God creature.

1118
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:53,651
Yeah.

1119
00:37:53,651 --> 00:37:55,410
He's in the joy in all of,

1120
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:57,030
it's slowly improving.

1121
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:00,510
Like you don't want to have
sex in a 10th of a second,

1122
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:00,820
you know,

1123
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,130
a 10th of a second Sachs,

1124
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,410
right?

1125
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,890
You want to have sex for a long
time so that you can enjoy it.

1126
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:06,450
You want your wife to feel good,

1127
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:09,960
you want to hold in your orgasm as
long as you can for it to feel good.

1128
00:38:09,961 --> 00:38:10,440
Yeah.

1129
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:13,350
And maybe that's sort of the same
idea about the universe creating

1130
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:14,184
consciousness,

1131
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,350
is that the universe wanted us to slowly
over the course of billions of years,

1132
00:38:19,351 --> 00:38:24,351
go from sludge that wiggles to people
that press buttons and rockets fly through

1133
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:30,681
the air with nuclear bombs on the end
of them that literally splice Adams and

1134
00:38:30,901 --> 00:38:35,901
destroy matter instantaneously leaving
the area impossible to occupy for

1135
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,570
hundreds of thousands of years.

1136
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,810
But to the universe,

1137
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,130
what's a hundred thousand years?

1138
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:42,964
That's nothing.

1139
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:43,950
It's a joke.

1140
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:44,331
Nothing.

1141
00:38:44,331 --> 00:38:45,020
And this isn't,

1142
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:45,291
you know,

1143
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:46,570
in Hinduism they,

1144
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,580
when they talk about the gods that they
all say like a day of Brahmin is like,

1145
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,341
you know,

1146
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:53,930
a million human years,

1147
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:58,130
like one day for this being
as a million billion years.

1148
00:38:58,131 --> 00:39:00,920
So a super advanced being,

1149
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,020
who knows how long the thing survives.

1150
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,610
It's a great way to look at it too.

1151
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:10,600
It's just interesting how humans tend to
ascribe cumin characteristics to beings

1152
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:16,751
that emerged from ostensibly different
galaxies or even other dementia.

1153
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:17,660
Okay.

1154
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,610
Or even the universe itself,

1155
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:24,470
the limitations of birth and death are
applied to the very universe itself and

1156
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:28,850
really sorta arbitrarily just because
of the fact that they have the signature

1157
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:29,840
from the big bang.

1158
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,650
That doesn't,

1159
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,320
doesn't mean it's not an infinite
number of those that have been going on

1160
00:39:33,321 --> 00:39:36,080
forever and there's no birth and death.

1161
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:38,180
It's just that breathing
in and breathing out,

1162
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:41,510
but everybody talks about one
day even our son will die.

1163
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,070
Yes.

1164
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,130
Will it really?

1165
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:43,971
You know it,

1166
00:39:43,971 --> 00:39:45,350
it will create humans,

1167
00:39:45,351 --> 00:39:45,760
man.

1168
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:45,940
Yeah.

1169
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,320
The only way you can make
a human being as a star,

1170
00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:53,321
as to explode where we are literally
made out of carbon and carbon comes from

1171
00:39:53,781 --> 00:39:55,330
stars and all the,

1172
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,450
the different matter,

1173
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:56,691
the,

1174
00:39:56,691 --> 00:40:00,080
the different elements of matter
that make up a human being.

1175
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,080
You literally have to
have a star that blows up.

1176
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,910
So the idea that our stars going to die.

1177
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:05,271
No,

1178
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:05,511
no,

1179
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:05,691
no,

1180
00:40:05,691 --> 00:40:05,931
no,

1181
00:40:05,931 --> 00:40:06,141
no,

1182
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:06,321
no.

1183
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:06,590
Yeah.

1184
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,120
Our star is going to blow out human seed.

1185
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:09,941
Yeah,

1186
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:10,571
there you go.

1187
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,171
Exactly.

1188
00:40:11,171 --> 00:40:11,530
You know,

1189
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:15,280
our star is going to radically change and
the same way that everything radically

1190
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:15,851
changes,

1191
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:18,400
which is why death itself is a silly word.

1192
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,290
You know when people say die,

1193
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,080
really what they mean is the person,

1194
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:23,621
the being,

1195
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:24,454
whatever it is,

1196
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:29,580
has transformed into something completely
different than what it was before and

1197
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:30,580
that,

1198
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:30,821
I mean,

1199
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:32,530
I know there's a biological principle,

1200
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:32,740
died,

1201
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,221
death.

1202
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:37,370
They say it's when we stop breathing or
that when we stop [inaudible] when we,

1203
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,950
when we stop breathing and your dad,

1204
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,860
but the reality is when
you start breathing,

1205
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:47,040
really what's happening is you are
transforming into energy for all the tiny

1206
00:40:49,031 --> 00:40:53,050
little microbes living inside of your
intestines that are gradually going to

1207
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:54,900
turn you into soil that's grown up,

1208
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,000
going to grow food for
other people to eat.

1209
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,230
You're not the not,

1210
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,031
we have a dual,

1211
00:41:00,031 --> 00:41:00,560
the Dunkin,

1212
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,820
we're going to formaldehyde people to
preserve them and they would code them

1213
00:41:04,821 --> 00:41:07,310
with a stick skin of makeup.

1214
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:12,500
It's very lifelike and realistic with
a tow of subtle wax like quality to

1215
00:41:12,501 --> 00:41:13,400
grandma's face.

1216
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,620
Isn't that hilarious?

1217
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:15,910
I was just thinking about that,

1218
00:41:15,911 --> 00:41:18,760
like how funny it is that
we put people in coffins,

1219
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:22,660
which are essentially supposed to
be beds so that people can like rock

1220
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,870
comfortably and some kind of
like big underground couch.

1221
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,351
You know,

1222
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:30,370
how much space we could save in graveyards
if we have the guts to chop people up

1223
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:31,780
and put them into little bags.

1224
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:32,763
We don't do that.

1225
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,200
Well how about put them into the ground
and have them do what they're supposed

1226
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,034
to do in the first place.

1227
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,420
You know why we can't do that?

1228
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,270
Because we want to be able to dig
them up and charge people with murder.

1229
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:41,781
Yeah,

1230
00:41:41,781 --> 00:41:42,471
exactly,

1231
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:42,711
man.

1232
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:43,221
That's right.

1233
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:44,390
And also if we did that,

1234
00:41:44,391 --> 00:41:49,391
there would be a swarm of goth kids
descending on every grave yard just to try

1235
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:50,920
to dig a skull outs.

1236
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:53,120
They didn't have to bother
with pop in a coffin open.

1237
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,090
But it is weird that we don't like
think of the shape of a coffin.

1238
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:56,441
Right,

1239
00:41:56,441 --> 00:41:56,810
right.

1240
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,590
We don't put,

1241
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:02,590
if you wanted to save space in a cemetery
and you could dig a hole deep where

1242
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:05,180
you could drop the coffin down,

1243
00:42:05,181 --> 00:42:07,610
like they're standing up
and you want them to relax,

1244
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,010
we want him to relax in a nice bed.

1245
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,390
I just saw this ad,

1246
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:11,931
uh,

1247
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:14,170
this old vintage ad for,

1248
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:14,750
um,

1249
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,090
uh,

1250
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,340
a type of vault.

1251
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:16,791
It's like,

1252
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:20,210
it's an old drawing of a woman who's
standing by the window looking out at the

1253
00:42:20,211 --> 00:42:21,440
rain and it's like,

1254
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,470
don't you feel comfortable knowing that
your loved one is safe from the weather

1255
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,360
and evolve that like,

1256
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:29,821
oh,

1257
00:42:29,821 --> 00:42:30,860
let water in there.

1258
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,850
But that's it.

1259
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:32,760
That's been going on forever.

1260
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,010
And that's what pyramids are there.

1261
00:42:34,011 --> 00:42:39,011
Just elaborate ridiculous mechanisms to
try to preserve the human body sort of

1262
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,140
then a mom know what the
hell pyramids are for.

1263
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:42,351
Well,

1264
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,510
they modification process.

1265
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:43,720
Yeah,

1266
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,051
sure.

1267
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:44,231
Yeah,

1268
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:44,700
that's,

1269
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,980
that's a fascinating Todd.

1270
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,171
You know,

1271
00:42:47,171 --> 00:42:47,801
you're not on camera,

1272
00:42:47,801 --> 00:42:48,634
right?

1273
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,503
How dare you.

1274
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,200
Um,

1275
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,910
this skin Walker ranch thing,

1276
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,930
we're going to go and we're going to,

1277
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:55,740
there's,

1278
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:57,370
there's a place in Utah,

1279
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,580
it's called Skin Walker
ranch and this place,

1280
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,460
it's legendary in the,

1281
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:03,790
in,

1282
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,040
in the the big foot folk.

1283
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:06,671
Yeah.

1284
00:43:06,671 --> 00:43:07,380
Talk.

1285
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:07,601
Yeah.

1286
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:07,780
The,

1287
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:12,670
the people that are fascinated with big
foot say that this is the spot where

1288
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,310
there's all these different
things being worked on,

1289
00:43:15,311 --> 00:43:19,600
that there's wormholes there and
space ships are coming from wormholes.

1290
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:20,980
So I go to their website,

1291
00:43:20,981 --> 00:43:21,400
right.

1292
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,610
I'm thinking it's probably
just a regular ranch.

1293
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,380
Everybody's just being nutty.

1294
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:27,633
It's beans.

1295
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,780
They have a link on the
website that says the entities,

1296
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,300
what says classifying creatures
at skin Walker ranch out at work.

1297
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,270
So I'm like,

1298
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:38,103
okay,

1299
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,041
now you got me.

1300
00:43:39,041 --> 00:43:39,701
What is that?

1301
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:44,701
So I click on that and it takes me to
all the various types of entities that

1302
00:43:46,631 --> 00:43:47,980
have been reported.

1303
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:48,940
Oh yeah.

1304
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:53,940
And it is simple as the
spotlight and flashed drones,

1305
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:56,050
a pulsating spherical ball of light,

1306
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,820
which could easily be ball lightning.

1307
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:02,650
Seems like these are like reasonable
sort of either a mythical explanations of

1308
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:06,460
natural phenomenon or just legend.

1309
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,890
So as we go further and further though,

1310
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,030
it gets to weird ones
like the bulletproof wolf.

1311
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,200
Ah,

1312
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:14,890
yeah.

1313
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,480
It says the dire wolf,

1314
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:20,980
like creature as long dirty mangy
gray black hair has a proud,

1315
00:44:20,981 --> 00:44:23,050
intimidating and intense like presence.

1316
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:23,831
At this time,

1317
00:44:23,831 --> 00:44:27,100
I am unsure if it is hostile or friendly.

1318
00:44:27,101 --> 00:44:31,890
My impression was neither more
majestic and to be in nature.

1319
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:33,120
Wait a minute,

1320
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:33,541
is this,

1321
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:34,740
this is on the Internet.

1322
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:34,921
Yeah.

1323
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:38,250
My impression was neither that you're
supposed to have a comma dummy.

1324
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,560
If you're gonna talk about fucking,

1325
00:44:40,561 --> 00:44:42,660
if you're talking to folks
at medical group wolves,

1326
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:44,580
you don't have to use appropriate grammar.

1327
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:49,700
May travel within the flash drones
and manifest from them as seen by two

1328
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:51,954
researchers.

1329
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,010
Oh,

1330
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:55,680
as seen by two researchers
should be legit.

1331
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,440
A bulletproof wolf that
comes out of a flash drought.

1332
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:58,741
Well,

1333
00:44:58,741 --> 00:44:59,850
two guys saw and Dunkin.

1334
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,131
Well,

1335
00:45:00,131 --> 00:45:03,100
I mean it sounds like these people are
just going around with a microphone and

1336
00:45:03,101 --> 00:45:03,581
recording.

1337
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:04,730
People snorted bass.

1338
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,673
Here's one of them.

1339
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,690
The controllers would,

1340
00:45:09,691 --> 00:45:14,691
sounds like two adult males speaking
to one another in an unknown language.

1341
00:45:14,791 --> 00:45:18,960
These two males are typically
invisible and usually overhead.

1342
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:22,800
Overheard speaking about
20 feet above one's head.

1343
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:25,980
They are speaking in a
native American like dialect.

1344
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:26,251
By the way,

1345
00:45:26,251 --> 00:45:27,810
that's also where they
attribute to big foot.

1346
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,260
Yeah.

1347
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,040
It's always like a native American
native American is the way to go.

1348
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:36,000
If you want to go spiritual
and woo woo and you know,

1349
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:36,750
you know,

1350
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:37,440
if you want to share,

1351
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,820
we want to talk to the spirits of the sky
in this space and we are in touch with

1352
00:45:41,821 --> 00:45:44,340
the spirits of the great
guardians of the universe.

1353
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,570
So it's like a native American.

1354
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:49,030
But it is funny that they're saying
that these beings talking to dialect,

1355
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:51,550
which means that they're not talking
in their native language when they're

1356
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:52,420
hovering above you,

1357
00:45:52,421 --> 00:45:53,254
they're talking and I,

1358
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,720
and a language you understand.

1359
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:55,551
Well not only that,

1360
00:45:55,551 --> 00:45:57,750
it means that there so intelligent,

1361
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:58,550
so advancing,

1362
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:59,660
get here from other planets,

1363
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:02,060
but they haven't figured out how
to talk without language yet.

1364
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:04,880
They haven't figured out how to
direct communicate mind to mind.

1365
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,081
Well,

1366
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:07,240
I don't think skin Walker
ranch is all about aliens.

1367
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:10,360
I think it's just about a lot of
paranormal activity that happens.

1368
00:46:10,361 --> 00:46:12,940
And this guy talked to you and Austin,

1369
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:16,960
Dr. Eric Davis used to
work there and this guy,

1370
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:17,351
uh,

1371
00:46:17,351 --> 00:46:19,180
though I would say that he's eccentric.

1372
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,560
He did a few things.

1373
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,251
Uh,

1374
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:22,270
when I went to visit him,

1375
00:46:22,271 --> 00:46:22,900
that made me think,

1376
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,111
oh,

1377
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:23,331
I don't,

1378
00:46:23,331 --> 00:46:24,880
I don't think that this guy's a Kook.

1379
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,450
When,

1380
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,190
and what he did specifically was,

1381
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:28,443
um,

1382
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,660
he has his laboratory where they're
doing all these various experiments.

1383
00:46:31,661 --> 00:46:35,080
This is a guy who actually
trying to create a warp drive.

1384
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:40,290
He's trying to create a way using vacuum
technology to bend space and time that

1385
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:45,340
creates kind of like a wave effect
that his ship could ride on a crest of

1386
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,880
somehow going faster
than the speed of light.

1387
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,193
Um,

1388
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:50,681
so what,

1389
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:51,880
when we went to visit this guy,

1390
00:46:51,881 --> 00:46:52,980
he did two things that made me,

1391
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:53,321
do you think,

1392
00:46:53,321 --> 00:46:53,651
wow,

1393
00:46:53,651 --> 00:46:54,484
I don't know.

1394
00:46:54,510 --> 00:46:56,950
I don't know if how skeptical
I should be about this guy,

1395
00:46:56,951 --> 00:47:00,100
which is the ad is all these
experiments running in this laboratory.

1396
00:47:00,430 --> 00:47:01,390
One of them being,

1397
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:04,210
they're trying to discover
a way to do cold fusion,

1398
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:04,781
you know,

1399
00:47:04,781 --> 00:47:06,400
which is what somehow um,

1400
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:08,320
creating an infinite energy source,

1401
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:09,154
which is a,

1402
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,630
what he calls a disruptive
technology or disrupt human society.

1403
00:47:13,631 --> 00:47:15,280
If we had an infinite energy source.

1404
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,210
But what he did was he kept pointing
to his experiments and saying,

1405
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:20,650
this isn't working.

1406
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,180
Nothing's happening here.

1407
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:23,920
This cold fusion isn't working.

1408
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,240
And all of his experiments,

1409
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:28,480
he was like saying we're all getting
no results from these experiments,

1410
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,760
which me is the opposite of what all the
other Kooks that we've encountered on

1411
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:34,121
the show.

1412
00:47:34,121 --> 00:47:37,300
Do people you like whoever
designed this website,

1413
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:37,750
you,

1414
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:41,430
you could probably call this person up
and say you saw an skin walker ranch at

1415
00:47:41,431 --> 00:47:42,700
tap dancing clown.

1416
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,300
They can shoot lightning bolts out of
his hands that turned into pineapples and

1417
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:49,030
that would show up on the website
and four minutes probably.

1418
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:49,660
Probably.

1419
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,231
Probably.

1420
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:52,400
Cause that researcher has discovered this.

1421
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:52,750
No Sir.

1422
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:53,770
We should try that.

1423
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,131
Yeah,

1424
00:47:54,131 --> 00:47:55,090
you could get it up there.

1425
00:47:55,091 --> 00:47:58,060
We should see how many we can get on
there before the guy starts catching on.

1426
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,470
It's a giant,

1427
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,230
but literal holes through the hills.

1428
00:48:02,231 --> 00:48:04,210
You have to watch for it in your face.

1429
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,601
Yeah,

1430
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:04,971
it's it.

1431
00:48:04,971 --> 00:48:05,790
Yeah.

1432
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:09,070
But it's farts have a
native American dialect,

1433
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,440
a native American quality,

1434
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:11,550
the smell like hickory,

1435
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,930
hickory wood chips.

1436
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,130
Um,

1437
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,100
but this Dr. Eric Davis,

1438
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,660
he worked on skin Walker ranch because
skin walker ranch is a place that was

1439
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:27,661
bought by this eccentric guy named Robert
Bigelow who's currently working with

1440
00:48:27,701 --> 00:48:28,420
NASA.

1441
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:29,740
He's uh,

1442
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,600
develop some kind of inflatable
technology where you can add,

1443
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:35,320
uh,

1444
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,240
add onto the space station using like
essentially like super powerful bouncy

1445
00:48:40,241 --> 00:48:41,074
houses.

1446
00:48:41,230 --> 00:48:41,771
You know what I mean?

1447
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:44,140
Like you like bill using metal and space,

1448
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:45,270
getting metal in space,

1449
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,060
getting construction material in this
space are using terrestrial construction

1450
00:48:49,061 --> 00:48:51,760
methods in space is not
only highly inefficient,

1451
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,110
it's incredibly dangerous.

1452
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,280
You have to go into,

1453
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,240
to spend whatever amount of time it
would take to actually build things using

1454
00:48:58,241 --> 00:48:59,230
aluminum or metal.

1455
00:48:59,231 --> 00:49:00,064
It's dangerous.

1456
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,050
So this guy came up with a brilliant idea
of having packaged inflatable a crafts

1457
00:49:05,051 --> 00:49:06,370
that you can bring in to space,

1458
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:06,941
uh,

1459
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:11,860
and the material that they're made
of is a much more powerful and can,

1460
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:12,610
uh,

1461
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:17,610
take the damage of micro media rights a
lot better than metal according to Dr.

1462
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,690
Eric Davis since that's what Bigelow,

1463
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,000
that's one of the things
he's working on right now.

1464
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:22,781
In other words,

1465
00:49:22,781 --> 00:49:24,970
he's not just a a Kook.

1466
00:49:24,971 --> 00:49:29,140
He's actually got satellites floating
in space right now that he got up there.

1467
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,630
So he heard about the skin walker ranch,

1468
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:34,690
heard about all the paranormal activity
that was happening there and decided

1469
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:38,050
that he would buy it since
scientists there to study it,

1470
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:43,260
to find out if he could find any proof
of this insane stuff that so many people

1471
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:44,164
are reporting.

1472
00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:49,170
And Dr. Eric Davis spent time there
studying this stuff and he said,

1473
00:49:49,511 --> 00:49:52,660
he told me to my face that he saw,

1474
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:53,320
uh,

1475
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,120
orbs floating out there,

1476
00:49:55,121 --> 00:49:57,490
that he saw orbs floating out there that,

1477
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:58,151
uh,

1478
00:49:58,151 --> 00:50:00,130
he couldn't think of any
other explanation for.

1479
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,020
I asked them about the cattle mutilations.

1480
00:50:02,021 --> 00:50:02,321
He said,

1481
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:02,591
no,

1482
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:03,280
that's,

1483
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,260
he thinks they think
that's people doing that.

1484
00:50:05,261 --> 00:50:06,430
They don't think it's aliens.

1485
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,050
He said that some of the researchers,

1486
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:13,051
they reported seeing like wormholes
opening up and I this guy,

1487
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,000
like I believed him.

1488
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:17,020
Like he,

1489
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:23,430
he actually gets contracts from the
government to work on this stuff and it

1490
00:50:23,801 --> 00:50:28,801
doesn't serve any purpose to go on a TV
and talk about wormholes opening up when

1491
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:30,561
he said like,

1492
00:50:30,561 --> 00:50:31,220
I uh,

1493
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:35,000
these researchers reported some kind of
creature emerging from this wormhole.

1494
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:35,571
I mean,

1495
00:50:35,571 --> 00:50:40,571
I don't understand what you have to gain
as a scientist by saying things that

1496
00:50:41,091 --> 00:50:45,650
sound like they're coming from
the freakout tent at burning man.

1497
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,830
It,

1498
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:47,663
you know,

1499
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,250
there's nothing to gain.

1500
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,950
What do you have to gain if
you're actually trying to get,

1501
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,900
trying to get business as a scientist.

1502
00:50:53,901 --> 00:50:54,640
So it,

1503
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:55,760
when I asked him this,

1504
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,211
uh,

1505
00:50:56,211 --> 00:50:58,940
one of the really smartest things
he said is that as a scientist,

1506
00:50:58,941 --> 00:50:59,631
that's your job.

1507
00:50:59,631 --> 00:51:00,980
You report your observations.

1508
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:02,480
You have to say what you've seen.

1509
00:51:02,481 --> 00:51:06,050
And sometimes reporting your observations
means that people are going to try to

1510
00:51:06,051 --> 00:51:06,884
discredit you.

1511
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:07,941
People are going to say,

1512
00:51:07,941 --> 00:51:08,774
you're crazy.

1513
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,771
People are going to,

1514
00:51:09,771 --> 00:51:10,460
uh,

1515
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,760
you're going to lose a lot of face and um,

1516
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:15,080
I dunno,

1517
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:15,913
I believed him.

1518
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:18,110
There's also the reality to consider the,

1519
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,100
there's a lot of people that tend
to lean towards the fantastic,

1520
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,400
they tend to lean towards fantasy and
they want there to be something magic out

1521
00:51:28,671 --> 00:51:31,370
there and their regular
life is boring man.

1522
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:32,020
They're,

1523
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:33,800
the wife doesn't want
to have sex with them.

1524
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,360
Their dog doesn't care.

1525
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:36,620
There's nothing going on.

1526
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,050
I don't really go outside if the dog,

1527
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,250
the guy is there or not,

1528
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,130
you know what I mean?

1529
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:43,220
Cause like a lot of people that
don't have anything exciting.

1530
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:43,970
That's my point.

1531
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:48,050
My point is that there's a lot of people
in this world that they have no joy.

1532
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,800
There's nothing exciting
about their occupation.

1533
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:51,220
Sure.

1534
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,090
It's nothing exciting
about their marriage.

1535
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,860
There's nothing exciting
about their neighborhood.

1536
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:57,410
They long for something special.

1537
00:51:57,411 --> 00:52:02,411
And I think a lot of that goes back to
our hunter gatherer routes where every

1538
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,310
day was filled with peril and excitement.

1539
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:09,550
And even though there was a lot of loss
of life and people didn't last as long,

1540
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:12,860
it was still a lot of thrill.

1541
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:13,371
You know,

1542
00:52:13,371 --> 00:52:14,480
people starved to death.

1543
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:14,991
But you know what,

1544
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:19,040
sometimes they didn't and you've got an
elk and everybody ate and they got by

1545
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:23,180
the fire and you found mushrooms and
everyone took them and there was joy and

1546
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,130
excitement and it was a real,

1547
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,080
it was a special existence.

1548
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:27,800
We've,

1549
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,540
in making everything so safe,

1550
00:52:29,541 --> 00:52:34,541
we've Kinda like smooth all the rough
spots that could trip you up in this life.

1551
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:37,700
We've also cut out all the fun,

1552
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:38,481
you know,

1553
00:52:38,481 --> 00:52:38,721
we've,

1554
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:40,460
we've cut out all the excitement,

1555
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:43,280
we've cut all the worry about
getting eaten by a Jaguar.

1556
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,870
The worst thing you have to worry about
as another idiot human slamming and you

1557
00:52:46,871 --> 00:52:48,320
have with their stupid car.

1558
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,970
That's what Jeff to worry about.

1559
00:52:49,971 --> 00:52:51,620
And eventually we'll figure that out too.

1560
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,780
We'll have some magnetic
field around each car.

1561
00:52:53,781 --> 00:52:57,140
So they repel each other like magnets
when you get close and they just bounce

1562
00:52:57,141 --> 00:52:57,861
off of each other.

1563
00:52:57,861 --> 00:52:58,694
That's on the way,

1564
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,410
I guarantee you that's on the way.

1565
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:00,950
Yeah,

1566
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:01,341
sure.

1567
00:53:01,341 --> 00:53:01,791
I mean,

1568
00:53:01,791 --> 00:53:05,480
I think that there are a group of people
who just get super bored and make up

1569
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:05,961
stories.

1570
00:53:05,961 --> 00:53:06,610
Kids do it.

1571
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:08,260
Why wouldn't they make up stories?

1572
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:11,860
But they lean towards the fantastic
say there's an infinite amount of

1573
00:53:11,861 --> 00:53:15,640
possibilities to explain any particular
scenario they're experiencing.

1574
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,600
They lean towards the most
fantastic of those possibilities.

1575
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:24,610
And then they nurture that and then
they also surround themselves with other

1576
00:53:24,611 --> 00:53:29,611
people who likeminded and
then they develop this sort
of hive mind of bullshit.

1577
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,070
And they all sit around
jerking each other off,

1578
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:34,050
pretending they're being
abducted by aliens.

1579
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,501
Oh,

1580
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:37,710
he's touching my bud abducting me.

1581
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:38,350
Yeah,

1582
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:38,881
that's crazy.

1583
00:53:38,881 --> 00:53:39,714
I'm touching your butt.

1584
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:40,621
I agree,

1585
00:53:40,621 --> 00:53:40,831
man.

1586
00:53:40,831 --> 00:53:41,551
I think you're right.

1587
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:45,340
I think there are clusters of psychos
out there and it's easy to find it.

1588
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,780
So many examples of that
and I think kids tend to do,

1589
00:53:48,781 --> 00:53:52,680
I can remember and I as a kid going into
the house and telling my mom that I'd

1590
00:53:52,681 --> 00:53:53,760
seen wonder woman,

1591
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,310
no reason to tell her that
I hadn't seen wonder woman.

1592
00:53:59,311 --> 00:53:59,911
I just like,

1593
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:01,380
but I started lying to my mom.

1594
00:54:01,381 --> 00:54:01,651
I'm like,

1595
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:01,771
yeah,

1596
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:04,530
I saw wonder woman by how old were you?

1597
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:05,580
I as 17

1598
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,003
no,

1599
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:13,861
no.

1600
00:54:13,861 --> 00:54:14,521
I was young,

1601
00:54:14,521 --> 00:54:14,701
man.

1602
00:54:14,701 --> 00:54:15,430
I was like,

1603
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:15,930
you know,

1604
00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:17,000
six maybe I don't,

1605
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:17,491
I don't know.

1606
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,151
I was young,

1607
00:54:18,151 --> 00:54:21,480
but I can remember telling
this blatant lie to my mom,

1608
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:22,171
my mom being like,

1609
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,750
are you sure you sound wonder woman?

1610
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,080
And then I started in my mind,

1611
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,520
I started like imagining the
encounter to help the lie.

1612
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,910
I could like kind of imagine the
wonder woman coming up to the plate,

1613
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:36,480
to the,

1614
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,880
to the swing and like saying hi.

1615
00:54:38,881 --> 00:54:40,650
I could kind of see you're
standing there and I,

1616
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:41,551
instead of being like,

1617
00:54:41,551 --> 00:54:41,731
you know,

1618
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:42,091
you're right,

1619
00:54:42,091 --> 00:54:42,271
mom,

1620
00:54:42,271 --> 00:54:42,691
I'm lying.

1621
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:46,560
I just went deeper and
deeper end of the lie.

1622
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,810
That's the problem with people.

1623
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:49,650
It happens.

1624
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:54,651
But I guess when I hear that someone has
taken the time to figure out a way to

1625
00:54:56,041 --> 00:55:00,690
construct inflatable space habitats and
has even managed to get those into orbit

1626
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:01,990
and these,

1627
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:06,990
and this is a person who has bought a
ranch where other scientists who are our

1628
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:09,900
reporting activity.

1629
00:55:09,901 --> 00:55:11,190
When I hear that stuff,

1630
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:12,210
I,

1631
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:16,800
it makes me believe it a little bit more
than when I hear somebody who's just a

1632
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:18,870
crystal gazer yapping about this stuff.

1633
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,980
When I hear that stuff and when I hear it,

1634
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:21,900
skin Walker ranch,

1635
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,980
you can't get in there.

1636
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,010
When I hear that they have
really high security and that,

1637
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:26,641
you know,

1638
00:55:26,641 --> 00:55:29,820
there's reports of like government
cars going in there and stuff.

1639
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:30,691
Then to me,

1640
00:55:30,691 --> 00:55:31,381
I start thinking,

1641
00:55:31,381 --> 00:55:31,630
well,

1642
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:33,450
something must be going on there.

1643
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,290
I don't understand why a guy is getting
million dollar contracts from NASA

1644
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:41,790
suddenly decides to buy a ranch and put
a security perimeter fence around it

1645
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:45,330
where people can't get into and then
become secretive about this stuff that's

1646
00:55:45,331 --> 00:55:46,170
happening in there.

1647
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,280
Why if you're some line Kook who just
wants people to believe in aliens,

1648
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,860
why wouldn't you just
send reports all the time?

1649
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,330
That website you're looking at,

1650
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,800
that's not Bigelow's website.

1651
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,370
That's somebody who thinks he's
an expert on skin Walker ranch.

1652
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:00,570
That's not Bigelow.

1653
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,070
That's somebody completely different.

1654
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:02,541
Oh,

1655
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:03,374
I see what you're saying.

1656
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:04,100
Well,

1657
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,320
just to play devil's
advocate about Bigelow,

1658
00:56:06,350 --> 00:56:11,270
let's just assume that he's working
on top secret spacecrafts that there.

1659
00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:11,631
Sure.

1660
00:56:11,631 --> 00:56:13,970
Why wouldn't he have high level security?

1661
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:14,391
Well,

1662
00:56:14,391 --> 00:56:16,040
you don't want people wandering up.

1663
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:16,641
Hey Man,

1664
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:17,580
what's your Weldon?

1665
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:17,920
Yeah,

1666
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,850
why you putting together a stealth bomber?

1667
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,241
Right.

1668
00:56:20,241 --> 00:56:20,391
Well,

1669
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:25,391
well it's not just that it's that he
bought a ranch that prior to his ownership

1670
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:27,640
that people who live there,

1671
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,390
we're reporting on this seven,

1672
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,790
their cattle were getting like
regularly like Moodle and mutilated.

1673
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,430
So there's some odds and not only that,

1674
00:56:36,431 --> 00:56:37,270
but he invited,

1675
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:37,691
you know,

1676
00:56:37,691 --> 00:56:39,910
scientists there to
actually study this stuff.

1677
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:44,770
I will tell you the part that makes me
skeptical about it is a every encounter

1678
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:47,140
that Dr. Eric Davis reported,

1679
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:49,240
somehow the cameras didn't work.

1680
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,690
He said that he saw these floating lights
and it was filmed on security camera

1681
00:56:52,691 --> 00:56:53,051
footage.

1682
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:54,370
I asked him where the footage was.

1683
00:56:54,371 --> 00:56:54,671
He said,

1684
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:58,240
it's in some warehouse there and
Bigelow doesn't want to release it.

1685
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,811
You know,

1686
00:56:58,811 --> 00:56:59,860
it's a classic thing,

1687
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:01,720
which is you,

1688
00:57:01,721 --> 00:57:02,141
the you,

1689
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:04,360
the person can report these experiences.

1690
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:08,650
But you would think that scientists that
were sent to a place to investigate it

1691
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:12,070
would have the wherewithal
to videotape this stuff.

1692
00:57:12,071 --> 00:57:12,904
And he said,

1693
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,870
especially with this wormhole that he
reported where some being climbed out,

1694
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,700
he said that uh,

1695
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,510
the,

1696
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:23,650
the energy that gets released from this
massive up cameras and of course the

1697
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:28,651
moment you start hearing that stuff slide
right back down into the skeptic swamp

1698
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:29,750
because it,

1699
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,290
it does seem a little curious that a,

1700
00:57:32,350 --> 00:57:34,900
they don't have any
footage that I know of.

1701
00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:35,890
There might be footage,

1702
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:37,960
there might be footage
from skin Walker ranch,

1703
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:38,920
but I'm not aware of it.

1704
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,151
Well,

1705
00:57:39,151 --> 00:57:41,880
it's sort of akin to how they
think that big foot consents,

1706
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:42,750
camera traps.

1707
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:43,613
Yes.

1708
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:45,600
And that's where we're
getting to with the show.

1709
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:49,680
Unfortunately there it's more of a show
in psychology than it is on anything

1710
00:57:49,681 --> 00:57:49,970
else.

1711
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:50,520
Yeah.

1712
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:55,520
As time goes on you realize that it's
more about how you sort of interpret what

1713
00:57:56,041 --> 00:58:00,210
you view in the world than it is
about what you're actually saying.

1714
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,700
But look at the Phoenix Lights,

1715
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:02,870
look at that.

1716
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:03,890
What is that man?

1717
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:08,960
That's some massive craft that went
flying over county after county.

1718
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:09,261
Uh,

1719
00:58:09,261 --> 00:58:11,780
governor reported seeing it.

1720
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,823
Come on man.

1721
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:13,581
What is that?

1722
00:58:13,581 --> 00:58:16,430
That's not some kid
talking about wonder woman.

1723
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,740
That's lots and lots of people
reporting the this thing.

1724
00:58:20,050 --> 00:58:20,321
Okay,

1725
00:58:20,321 --> 00:58:23,080
stop what you said there
because there is evidence,

1726
00:58:23,081 --> 00:58:24,750
video evidence in Phoenix Lights,

1727
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:25,090
right?

1728
00:58:25,090 --> 00:58:25,540
Okay.

1729
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,220
But what is the video evidence?

1730
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,600
It's just these things floating in the
sky is red lights floating in the sky.

1731
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,890
It's like very simple.

1732
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:34,270
Sean descript.

1733
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:35,740
Not that spectacular.

1734
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,860
You can wash the Phoenix lights is
that they've shown it on national news

1735
00:58:38,861 --> 00:58:41,050
broadcasts and it's kind of nothing.

1736
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,310
So all this other stuff is all stuff
that really wasn't captured on camera.

1737
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:48,040
So it all falls into the
same category when you go.

1738
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,420
What about the Phoenix Lights?

1739
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:50,530
The governor saw it.

1740
00:58:50,531 --> 00:58:52,210
Everyone that you can get
all sensational with it.

1741
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:52,841
But then when you go,

1742
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:53,440
okay,

1743
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,850
where is the evidence?

1744
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,511
And you go,

1745
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:55,701
well,

1746
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:56,531
will they have a video?

1747
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,070
And then you watched the
video of the Phoenix Lights.

1748
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,380
You go man,

1749
00:58:59,381 --> 00:58:59,801
I mean,

1750
00:58:59,801 --> 00:59:00,501
what is that?

1751
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:01,360
That ain't shit.

1752
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:02,680
Let's pull up the fee.

1753
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:03,543
Can you pull it up,

1754
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,170
pull up the video of the Phoenix Lights,

1755
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:06,970
find the video of the Phoenix Lights.

1756
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,920
Let's just look at it
because it's stock footage.

1757
00:59:08,921 --> 00:59:10,120
Anyone can can look at it.

1758
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:14,600
We'll pull it up because it's
something to behold because a,

1759
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:15,600
it's it.

1760
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:16,001
It's,

1761
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:21,001
it's a huge point of
discussion in a Ufo Lore.

1762
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:21,950
If you,

1763
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:25,340
if you talk to people about there's
Roswell and the Phoenix Lights.

1764
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:25,640
Yeah,

1765
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,440
those are the two big ones.

1766
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,310
Yeah.

1767
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:32,750
But it is amazing when you
actually watch the Phoenix lights,

1768
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:34,940
how non sensational it is,

1769
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:40,270
how almost boring and nothing and
indescript it's just these floating light

1770
00:59:42,681 --> 00:59:43,514
bulbs.

1771
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:43,741
Well,

1772
00:59:43,741 --> 00:59:44,041
yeah,

1773
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:44,730
but I mean,

1774
00:59:44,730 --> 00:59:45,563
I think it,

1775
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:46,601
to me the,

1776
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:46,861
I mean,

1777
00:59:46,861 --> 00:59:47,251
I don't know,

1778
00:59:47,251 --> 00:59:47,950
it's to me what,

1779
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:48,990
what your care is to me,

1780
00:59:48,991 --> 00:59:49,261
what,

1781
00:59:49,261 --> 00:59:50,250
but it does seem like it

1782
00:59:50,350 --> 00:59:51,400
could have been drones,

1783
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,360
could have been a lot of things.

1784
00:59:52,361 --> 00:59:53,194
Let's watch it.

1785
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,250
Okay.

1786
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:59,250
This is the actual Phoenix lights and
this is the stuff that people talk about.

1787
00:59:59,741 --> 01:00:00,010
Like,

1788
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,540
oh my goodness,

1789
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,400
the UFO is are here.

1790
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,930
We'll look at what we're actually seeing.

1791
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,910
You actually seen some lights
floating above Phoenix.

1792
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,421
Yes.

1793
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:11,620
That's kind of interesting,

1794
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:12,820
but you know,

1795
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,470
it's not that interesting man.

1796
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,800
I mean there's some lights
floating about Phoenix,

1797
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,260
but those lights are connected.

1798
01:00:18,261 --> 01:00:20,870
I mean the idea is those lights
are connected to one crack.

1799
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:21,091
No,

1800
01:00:21,091 --> 01:00:22,020
that's not the idea.

1801
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:23,180
No,

1802
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:23,681
they are.

1803
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:24,121
They see,

1804
01:00:24,121 --> 01:00:24,954
cause you see them,

1805
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:25,651
there's this,

1806
01:00:25,651 --> 01:00:26,550
there's a bunch of them.

1807
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,190
The idea is that there are
several different things going on.

1808
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:29,611
Did these,

1809
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:31,000
these things floating and it,

1810
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:34,950
there's also this triangular
thing that's floating in the air,

1811
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,940
but what you're seeing here is these
things that are floating in the sky and a

1812
01:00:38,941 --> 01:00:40,280
new one keeps lighting up.

1813
01:00:40,290 --> 01:00:40,800
My memory.

1814
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,850
That is weird.

1815
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,960
It is definitely weird,

1816
01:00:42,961 --> 01:00:47,460
but it's not something that human
couldn't do if we had drones.

1817
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,940
I mean they keep popping up
and new light keeps popping up,

1818
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:50,251
man.

1819
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:50,461
Why?

1820
01:00:50,461 --> 01:00:52,040
If somebody is doing that as a hugs,

1821
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:53,250
why didn't they keep doing it?

1822
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,930
That's something crazy up there,

1823
01:00:54,931 --> 01:00:55,220
man.

1824
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:57,220
It might not be a hoax it,

1825
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:02,310
we might be experimented
with a new technology and
it wasn't far enough away to

1826
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:04,580
be out of the view of the people.

1827
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:09,760
It might be experimenting
with a psychology study to
see what would happen if

1828
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:12,460
you have these uh,

1829
01:01:13,690 --> 01:01:18,690
non fon lights flying over a major
metropolitan city and in clear view of

1830
01:01:20,151 --> 01:01:21,470
everyone who lives there,

1831
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,700
what's the reaction?

1832
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:23,960
How do people,

1833
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,670
how do people react to this?

1834
01:01:25,671 --> 01:01:26,750
What's the fallout?

1835
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:27,170
That's it.

1836
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:31,280
But I've seen videos of drones
going up in the air and they,

1837
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:31,700
they,

1838
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,060
they,

1839
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:32,893
Bob,

1840
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,490
those things aren't bobbing right,

1841
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:35,390
but what are they doing?

1842
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:36,300
They're just sitting there.

1843
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:37,131
They're sitting there,

1844
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:38,510
which is even more bizarre.

1845
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,373
I mean it,

1846
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:39,890
yeah,

1847
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:40,710
like how do you,

1848
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:41,321
how do you do that?

1849
01:01:41,321 --> 01:01:46,321
Imagine the wind up that
high with something that
big to have stabilizers that

1850
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:48,560
make it stay completely immobile.

1851
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,210
Floating there in the sky.

1852
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:51,680
If those were drones they would,

1853
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:55,220
there were be movement that things
connected and the size of that thing is

1854
01:01:55,221 --> 01:01:56,150
tremendous.

1855
01:01:56,390 --> 01:01:58,600
Whatever that thing is is very,

1856
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,480
very,

1857
01:01:59,480 --> 01:01:59,680
yeah,

1858
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,550
it's moved up and down.

1859
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,370
Those lights have moved up and down to me.

1860
01:02:04,371 --> 01:02:05,750
Like they're individually moving.

1861
01:02:05,751 --> 01:02:07,640
It looks like they're all
connected to one craft.

1862
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,380
If you go back to the beginning though,

1863
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:10,220
the way they are,

1864
01:02:10,221 --> 01:02:11,960
that's not in like one line.

1865
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,690
In fact they're stacked on top
of each other a little bit.

1866
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,100
Jamie ticket back to the,

1867
01:02:16,101 --> 01:02:17,630
to the very beginning if you would,

1868
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:22,500
if you look at it very early on
when you start to see these lights,

1869
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,300
they're not simply,

1870
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:28,140
they're not simply all
along like a straight line.

1871
01:02:28,141 --> 01:02:30,120
Like one of them was above the other one.

1872
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:33,420
Seems like there's two
on the right hand side.

1873
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:33,960
Yeah.

1874
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,330
That's that safe.

1875
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,323
See that?

1876
01:02:36,570 --> 01:02:37,800
A bunch of them together.

1877
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,430
See all that.

1878
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:38,590
Yeah,

1879
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:39,570
that's a curve.

1880
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:40,440
Maybe,

1881
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:41,160
maybe not.

1882
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:45,720
Maybe it's like somebody released a
cluster of these drones and then they fly

1883
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:48,240
out with these lights on
them and they stabilize.

1884
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,290
Okay.

1885
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,180
I think it's,

1886
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:50,630
look,

1887
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:54,720
I just from my UN scientific perspective,

1888
01:02:54,721 --> 01:02:56,250
that is those aren't drones.

1889
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,330
I mean you can look up a video of drones
like flying at night floating and look

1890
01:03:00,331 --> 01:03:01,111
at what that looks like.

1891
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:04,730
You should compare it to that because
I've seen this video of what drones are

1892
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,520
balloons or a blimp,

1893
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:10,000
but drones can take on a
million different forms.

1894
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:11,800
I mean the idea that,

1895
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:12,490
you know,

1896
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:14,470
the word drone is like the word drug.

1897
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:15,041
I mean,

1898
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:15,820
it could be a,

1899
01:03:15,820 --> 01:03:19,090
could have a lot of different applications
to be a lot of different things.

1900
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:19,301
Well,

1901
01:03:19,301 --> 01:03:19,511
look,

1902
01:03:19,511 --> 01:03:19,960
here's the,

1903
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,860
here's the bottom line.

1904
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,470
It's more likely that
that's a terrestrial craft,

1905
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:25,600
right?

1906
01:03:25,600 --> 01:03:27,240
Then it's a non-terrestrial crap.

1907
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:27,550
Right?

1908
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,271
That's true.

1909
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:29,170
You can't argue with that.

1910
01:03:29,171 --> 01:03:34,150
It's more likely that that's something
that the government created or someone

1911
01:03:34,630 --> 01:03:35,530
doing a hoax,

1912
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:39,280
but the reports of that thing and
the distance that it traveled and the

1913
01:03:39,281 --> 01:03:42,040
consistency of the shape
and the many reports,

1914
01:03:42,220 --> 01:03:42,851
if that's a,

1915
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:43,930
if that's a hoax,

1916
01:03:44,170 --> 01:03:45,400
it's an elaborate hoax.

1917
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:48,850
Whoever's doing the hugs could probably
make a lot more money selling shit to

1918
01:03:48,851 --> 01:03:51,280
the government than freaking out rednecks.

1919
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:52,061
Forgive me.

1920
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:53,080
I don't think everyone in Phoenix,

1921
01:03:53,081 --> 01:03:55,900
Phoenix is not filled with hot.

1922
01:03:55,901 --> 01:03:56,471
There you go.

1923
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:57,100
Nuts.

1924
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:57,791
They're next door.

1925
01:03:57,791 --> 01:03:59,020
He returns to jam.

1926
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:00,380
It can,

1927
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:01,570
but they have air conditioning.

1928
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:01,751
You know,

1929
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:02,680
they're not savages.

1930
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,070
Yeah.

1931
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:05,560
But I know that if you have
to walk out to your car,

1932
01:04:05,561 --> 01:04:07,510
if you get sunstroke walking to your car,

1933
01:04:07,511 --> 01:04:08,590
you start slowly,

1934
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,180
your brain fries a little bit.

1935
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,241
Um,

1936
01:04:11,241 --> 01:04:12,560
didn't have stuff happened in September,

1937
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,730
was relatively cool.

1938
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:14,990
What's that?

1939
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,190
Didn't this happen in September?

1940
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:18,091
I don't know man.

1941
01:04:18,091 --> 01:04:19,590
For the sake of what I'm saying.

1942
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:23,100
And he's happened in the middle of
summer when there's a power shortage.

1943
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:24,243
Looking at,

1944
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:25,140
here's the,

1945
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:25,340
the,

1946
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:25,860
the,

1947
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:28,860
what I'm saying is whatever that is.

1948
01:04:28,861 --> 01:04:33,510
It was novel and special
and Super Bizarre.

1949
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,710
And what you're saying,

1950
01:04:34,711 --> 01:04:37,860
which is I think the best point is,

1951
01:04:37,861 --> 01:04:38,041
well,

1952
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:38,430
where,

1953
01:04:38,430 --> 01:04:39,750
where's the footage from?

1954
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,800
Skin Walker ranch?

1955
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:41,820
Where's the footage?

1956
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,440
Where's Bigelow's footage?

1957
01:04:43,441 --> 01:04:45,330
Where's footage of weird
things happening there?

1958
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,750
This though this Phoenix lights,

1959
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:47,700
if you keep watching this,

1960
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,870
those lights just slowly fade out.

1961
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:55,140
Which would sort of lend to the theory
that these were actually just flares.

1962
01:04:55,550 --> 01:04:55,761
No,

1963
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:55,920
no,

1964
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:56,960
that's just one shot.

1965
01:04:56,961 --> 01:04:57,141
Man,

1966
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:58,850
I think traveled several counties.

1967
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,220
There's videos of that thing all over fee.

1968
01:05:01,250 --> 01:05:01,830
That's not an

1969
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:03,570
just from one spot I think move.

1970
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:04,170
Okay.

1971
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,030
Let's see if he got an,

1972
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:05,730
uh,

1973
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:08,880
look for best version of Phoenix Lights.

1974
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:09,780
If you could find another one.

1975
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:10,590
Jamey.

1976
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:11,071
I think,

1977
01:05:11,071 --> 01:05:11,904
um,

1978
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:12,541
I think it's,

1979
01:05:12,541 --> 01:05:12,900
uh,

1980
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,790
it's something to think about.

1981
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:15,571
You know,

1982
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:15,781
the,

1983
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:16,351
the idea,

1984
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:17,184
something to think,

1985
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,790
the idea that that was some sort
of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

1986
01:05:21,791 --> 01:05:23,230
The decided to hover over Phoenix.

1987
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,750
One thing that Eric Davis said,

1988
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:25,680
which is interesting,

1989
01:05:25,681 --> 01:05:26,790
is that these beings,

1990
01:05:26,791 --> 01:05:27,511
whatever they are,

1991
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:27,761
they're,

1992
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,310
they're gathering intelligence.

1993
01:05:29,311 --> 01:05:30,210
They're trying to,

1994
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:31,380
they're observing us.

1995
01:05:31,590 --> 01:05:32,670
For some reason.

1996
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:37,230
They don't feel like necessarily
communicating with us.

1997
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,310
They're observing us.

1998
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:38,701
You know,

1999
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,220
maybe they fuck up from time to time.

2000
01:05:41,430 --> 01:05:42,930
Maybe they screw up and,

2001
01:05:43,260 --> 01:05:43,770
uh,

2002
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:47,970
something just crashes in Roswell or
something appears in the night sky and

2003
01:05:47,971 --> 01:05:52,560
nailing gets fired because he fell asleep
at the wheel or whatever they have.

2004
01:05:52,561 --> 01:05:53,230
Who knows?

2005
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,130
Do you one better,

2006
01:05:54,310 --> 01:05:58,990
maybe their idea is that if you're dealing
with an incredibly intelligent human

2007
01:05:58,991 --> 01:06:02,080
being population that has nuclear power,

2008
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,760
mass communications,

2009
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,920
the ability to send video and
photographs through the air and,

2010
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:11,680
and instantaneously
arrive across the globe.

2011
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:16,060
Maybe these beings need to be baby fucked.

2012
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:19,420
Maybe you need a slow Lee,

2013
01:06:19,421 --> 01:06:20,830
show them about Ufo,

2014
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:21,581
a gentle,

2015
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:21,971
gentle,

2016
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:22,804
gentle,

2017
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:25,150
maybe you can't just just horse fuck.

2018
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:28,370
Maybe he can't just like land on
the White House lawn and go eat,

2019
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:29,130
come on bitches.

2020
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:29,963
You're kind of with me.

2021
01:06:30,450 --> 01:06:31,630
And Start Zapping people.

2022
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:32,070
Sure.

2023
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:36,010
Maybe have to slowly
indoctrinate them into the idea

2024
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:41,000
of the world of the extraterrestrial
intelligent being coming here.

2025
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:44,090
And it's the way to do
that is to space it out.

2026
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:47,690
The way to do that is to how
something happened in Roswell,

2027
01:06:47,691 --> 01:06:48,171
New Mexico.

2028
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:48,470
And I mean,

2029
01:06:48,470 --> 01:06:48,831
again,

2030
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:52,850
if you're talking about some infinitely
intelligent being Kurzweil's already

2031
01:06:52,851 --> 01:06:54,470
talking about extending our life,

2032
01:06:54,620 --> 01:06:56,420
that if you could live to 20,

2033
01:06:56,421 --> 01:06:57,440
45,

2034
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:57,801
you know,

2035
01:06:57,801 --> 01:06:59,150
you're probably going to live forever.

2036
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:00,830
You're going to live to a thousand years,

2037
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:04,910
whatever you're dealing with a being that
has already accepted that as a reality

2038
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:10,060
and it is planting a seed and it's slowly
planting a seed here on earth and that

2039
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:14,090
allows those spacecraft to crash in a
place where it knows there's going to be a

2040
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:16,150
military that's going to
be really quiet about it.

2041
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,670
Sure.

2042
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,050
And that they allow,

2043
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:18,650
uh,

2044
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:19,130
these,

2045
01:07:19,130 --> 01:07:21,530
these lights or they Cory GAF,

2046
01:07:21,531 --> 01:07:24,680
these lights flying over
Phoenix and landing.

2047
01:07:24,810 --> 01:07:25,560
Or maybe they know,

2048
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,450
maybe they look at it like contamination.

2049
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:27,781
You know,

2050
01:07:27,781 --> 01:07:30,870
like when we send the Mars probe
up to Mars and we try to keep it,

2051
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:35,130
we try to like keep it from all earth
microbes to not contaminate Mars.

2052
01:07:35,131 --> 01:07:36,000
Maybe they look at it

2053
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,340
showing and showing themselves to us
as a form of psychic contamination.

2054
01:07:41,341 --> 01:07:42,540
Maybe they don't want,

2055
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,030
maybe they don't even
want us to know it all.

2056
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:48,180
I think it's more likely if there are
these beings that they mess up just like

2057
01:07:48,181 --> 01:07:50,070
any other being does from time to time.

2058
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,120
They just mess up.

2059
01:07:51,420 --> 01:07:53,790
There's mistakes and the
programs you workers.

2060
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:54,211
Yeah.

2061
01:07:54,211 --> 01:07:54,820
Why not

2062
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:59,240
this people they hire and they just do
a shit job of intergalactic travel to

2063
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,810
like Shitty intergalactic
Greyhound bus drivers.

2064
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:02,270
Yeah,

2065
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,010
exactly.

2066
01:08:03,010 --> 01:08:05,280
Talk and look at the turnaround.

2067
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,270
This is another video
of the Phoenix Lights.

2068
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,520
Look at how stable those lights are,

2069
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:10,750
man.

2070
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:10,961
Yeah,

2071
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:11,920
it is kind of interesting.

2072
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:12,611
You know,

2073
01:08:12,611 --> 01:08:15,040
the idea of them being
stable as interesting,

2074
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:19,970
but if we can split atoms with a bond
that would drop out of a propeller plane,

2075
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,350
I don't think it's that,

2076
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:25,370
that impossible to create something that
can hover in the sky like that and stay

2077
01:08:25,371 --> 01:08:26,690
stable in a straight line

2078
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,230
look.

2079
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:28,710
Of course,

2080
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:29,341
of course.

2081
01:08:29,341 --> 01:08:30,240
Definitely.

2082
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:33,300
There's no proof that that we
don't know where it came from.

2083
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:38,480
All we know is that a massive thing that
seems to be a connection of lights on

2084
01:08:39,421 --> 01:08:43,620
some form of craft appeared over Phoenix
and it got caught on video by a lot of

2085
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:44,454
different people.

2086
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:45,930
We do know that.

2087
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,790
So what that thing is,

2088
01:08:47,970 --> 01:08:48,803
who knows?

2089
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:53,400
Comes Razor says it's the government
or it's some kind of military test or

2090
01:08:53,401 --> 01:08:54,091
something like that.

2091
01:08:54,091 --> 01:08:56,340
But you'd think of military test,

2092
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:59,510
there's plenty of space to do that
shit where people don't see it.

2093
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:00,520
Hmm.

2094
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,170
And here's another,

2095
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:05,230
let's throw this into the hat.

2096
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:10,120
If you were an extraterrestrial
intelligent being and
you were coming here from

2097
01:09:10,121 --> 01:09:11,590
another planet to observe Earth,

2098
01:09:11,591 --> 01:09:12,371
where would you go?

2099
01:09:12,371 --> 01:09:12,641
Well,

2100
01:09:12,641 --> 01:09:15,340
I would want to go to
where this dude lives,

2101
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:19,030
where he's making inflatable
bouncy houses for space.

2102
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:19,340
Yeah.

2103
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,920
I wanna I wanna check out that cat.

2104
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:21,960
I want to go and,

2105
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:22,440
and,

2106
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:23,171
and freak out.

2107
01:09:23,171 --> 01:09:28,171
This dude who is got a billion ones and
Zeros and is spending all of it on Ufo

2108
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,720
research and space travel research.

2109
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:36,060
The problem with that is is he bought
the ranch from just cattle farmers.

2110
01:09:36,061 --> 01:09:40,200
So what sets up the activity was already
happening there before he bought the

2111
01:09:40,201 --> 01:09:40,470
ranch.

2112
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:40,880
Yeah.

2113
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,470
How much of that is horse poop?

2114
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:43,840
How much that the,

2115
01:09:43,841 --> 01:09:44,051
the,

2116
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:45,440
the activity before that?

2117
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:46,310
It's not true.

2118
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:47,030
Well I,

2119
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,781
I don't know man.

2120
01:09:47,781 --> 01:09:48,650
But you know,

2121
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,390
the difference between this and big
foot is that we already have much more

2122
01:09:53,391 --> 01:09:55,640
compelling footage than
we had for big foot.

2123
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:56,630
I'm like just that.

2124
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:58,100
It's like what is that?

2125
01:09:58,101 --> 01:09:59,930
And then of all the Ufo footage,

2126
01:09:59,931 --> 01:10:02,030
let's say that 2% of it is like that,

2127
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,650
that's still pretty compelling.

2128
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,490
Cause remembering,

2129
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:06,470
I think it was in China or Japan,

2130
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,340
I think it was China,

2131
01:10:08,090 --> 01:10:11,480
some giant craft started appearing.

2132
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:13,190
And I think there's footage of that too.

2133
01:10:13,490 --> 01:10:16,730
This all seem to be happening at the
same time where people said maybe the

2134
01:10:16,731 --> 01:10:18,980
government's experimenting
with some massive,

2135
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:20,000
uh,

2136
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,260
stealth craft.

2137
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,670
And it's also interesting that as our
technology is improving and our ability to

2138
01:10:25,671 --> 01:10:28,880
record things is improving subsequently.

2139
01:10:28,881 --> 01:10:29,331
Also,

2140
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:31,430
our ability to fake things is improving,

2141
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,030
right?

2142
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:32,601
And you could,

2143
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:34,310
you could fake it on a laptop.

2144
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:39,370
A personal laptop can make
a very convincing video of
some paranormal activity,

2145
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,890
whether it's a Ufo or a ghost,

2146
01:10:42,891 --> 01:10:43,724
or

2147
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:44,051
you know,

2148
01:10:44,051 --> 01:10:45,010
name it well,

2149
01:10:45,670 --> 01:10:46,660
and even what's,

2150
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:49,300
even if you experienced it yourself,

2151
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:54,160
even if you're standing in Phoenix and
you look up and you see this thing go by,

2152
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,560
you're still just dealing
with your optic nerve.

2153
01:10:56,561 --> 01:10:59,500
You're still dealing with
your limited human senses.

2154
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,270
The truth is you'll never know.

2155
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:05,590
You'll never know unless you got lucky
enough to get abducted and sucked into

2156
01:11:05,591 --> 01:11:07,990
one of these ships and saw for yourself.

2157
01:11:07,991 --> 01:11:12,010
There's no way that you can know
for certain what these things are.

2158
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:13,980
We just know that is phenomena

2159
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,120
that happens.

2160
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,450
This is one of the things on the website,

2161
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,110
uh,

2162
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:20,430
the describes and skin
Walker ranch website.

2163
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:21,450
The portal.

2164
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:22,380
It says,

2165
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:24,420
I have seen this firsthand,

2166
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:29,570
but I have possibly seen radiation from
it made the entire night scenery appear

2167
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,870
like daytime for 10 seconds.

2168
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,970
Very bright flash of light,

2169
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,850
which illuminated both sky and the ground.

2170
01:11:38,910 --> 01:11:39,331
First of all,

2171
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:40,320
if you write like that,

2172
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:41,820
I'm not listening to you.

2173
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,283
Okay?

2174
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,720
I have seen this firsthand,

2175
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,450
but I have possibly
seen radiation from it.

2176
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:49,530
That's a sentence.

2177
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,040
Yeah.

2178
01:11:50,040 --> 01:11:50,940
What the fuck does that mean?

2179
01:11:50,941 --> 01:11:51,774
Dude,

2180
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:52,970
I have seen this firsthand,

2181
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,990
but I have possibly seen
radiation firsthand.

2182
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:55,860
Yeah.

2183
01:11:55,860 --> 01:11:57,330
What the fuck are you saying?

2184
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:57,840
Nothing.

2185
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,190
Are you saying I haven't seen this first
hand or I have seen it says I have.

2186
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,090
Oh,

2187
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:03,361
it says,

2188
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,194
I have never seen this.

2189
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:05,813
I read it wrong.

2190
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,480
So what?

2191
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:10,231
Where's the picture?

2192
01:12:10,231 --> 01:12:11,370
Even if you did read her eye,

2193
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:12,780
where's there's no picture,

2194
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:14,940
there's no picture joking
around about the whole thing,

2195
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:17,940
but because of buzz above
that is sent to Tiant missed.

2196
01:12:18,270 --> 01:12:23,270
Oh boy described by Bigelow researchers
as a neurological electricity.

2197
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:24,091
That's unique.

2198
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:28,650
Entity is completely black and
color takes the intangible for these

2199
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:30,390
motherfuckers watched lost too many times.

2200
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,690
It takes the intangible
form of a thick smoke.

2201
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:38,840
The smoke is described like a disembodied
skin of a black electrified energy

2202
01:12:39,451 --> 01:12:44,451
that possesses and intellect theories
hold that this is a pre transitional

2203
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:50,180
embodiment of a not yet formed entity
as it emerges from a portal or flashed

2204
01:12:51,021 --> 01:12:51,840
drone.

2205
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:52,440
Oh,

2206
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,161
excellent theory.

2207
01:12:53,161 --> 01:12:54,540
I'm sure peer reviewed,

2208
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:56,430
I'm sure it's been peer reviewed.

2209
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:57,630
This shameless,

2210
01:12:57,810 --> 01:12:58,860
malleable missed.

2211
01:12:58,861 --> 01:13:03,840
We'll eventually mold itself
into a local animal or humanoid.

2212
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,830
A really does read like the
instruction guide for an Xbox game,

2213
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,200
like these are the things
you're going to fight.

2214
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:11,550
Exactly.

2215
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:13,110
That's a video game.

2216
01:13:13,111 --> 01:13:13,381
I mean,

2217
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:13,861
come on,

2218
01:13:13,861 --> 01:13:14,300
man.

2219
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:19,230
It the smoke is eventually get a
mold itself into a local animal.

2220
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:24,530
It's going to be a squirrel sylo squirrels
that you see that just like eating

2221
01:13:25,021 --> 01:13:25,801
nuts and you go,

2222
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:26,700
hey Mr Squirrel,

2223
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,470
that's an alien man.

2224
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:33,540
He's spying on you from another planet
and sending data to the NSA of outer

2225
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:34,374
space.

2226
01:13:34,950 --> 01:13:35,783
Yeah.

2227
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:40,350
It's that website does
not seem very Kratovil.

2228
01:13:40,580 --> 01:13:41,220
Aw.

2229
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,330
What we need to do,

2230
01:13:42,331 --> 01:13:42,810
man,

2231
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:46,110
is we need to go to skin
Walker ranch ourselves.

2232
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:50,730
We need to go and bring
some night vision equipment.

2233
01:13:50,790 --> 01:13:52,290
Scan the skies,

2234
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:53,970
talk to the locals,

2235
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:55,470
see if it's hooey.

2236
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:56,641
Who knows,

2237
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,001
man.

2238
01:13:57,001 --> 01:13:59,610
I mean it might be one of those
things where we get there.

2239
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,290
We see a bunch of crazy shit.

2240
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:01,770
Yes,

2241
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:02,431
exactly.

2242
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:04,560
That's the only way you
can know and never know.

2243
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:09,000
You never know and at least we'll have
the experience that we could talk about

2244
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:11,740
and everyone watching can
think that we're a too,

2245
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:13,000
cause that's what happened.

2246
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:13,210
Yeah.

2247
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,340
That's the funny thing about it is we,

2248
01:14:15,341 --> 01:14:19,030
if we go there and have some
kind of experience and report it,

2249
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,620
even if we catch it on camera,

2250
01:14:21,010 --> 01:14:22,480
there's still going to be selling me like,

2251
01:14:22,481 --> 01:14:23,314
Nah,

2252
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:24,430
we're comedians.

2253
01:14:24,490 --> 01:14:24,940
Yeah.

2254
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:25,990
What would they believe us?

2255
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:26,410
They will.

2256
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:26,591
Yeah,

2257
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:27,041
exactly.

2258
01:14:27,041 --> 01:14:30,280
If you're not going to believe
is scientists working on
a warp drive or somebody

2259
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:33,310
who's creating inflatable craft for NASA,

2260
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,850
no one's going to believe to stoner comics
when they report and seeing flashing

2261
01:14:36,851 --> 01:14:37,684
lights.

2262
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:38,200
Dude,

2263
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,190
I swear we saw it.

2264
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:39,821
By the way.

2265
01:14:39,821 --> 01:14:41,500
We have a new show coming out on PSI Phi.

2266
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:42,760
It's called Joe Rogan questions.

2267
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,570
Everything.

2268
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:44,740
Duncan Trussell in ours fear.

2269
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:47,860
What we're going to do is we're going to
try to find mysteries and we found one.

2270
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:48,963
Yeah.

2271
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,380
Yeah.

2272
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:53,380
So what does music a real man,

2273
01:14:53,381 --> 01:14:56,200
Jesus could come climbing out of a hole.

2274
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,370
It's skin Walker ranch
and give us both hand jobs

2275
01:15:01,370 --> 01:15:01,700
and,

2276
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:01,930
well,

2277
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:02,201
you know,

2278
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:06,250
it's probably just a
hippie [inaudible] hippie.

2279
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:10,150
I'm Jesus,

2280
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:15,610
a clever gay hippie that climbs
out of squirrels asshole.

2281
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,370
And he appears as missed
until he forms into Jesus.

2282
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,560
The classic Jesus Robes,

2283
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,580
hands outstretched.

2284
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:26,740
He Chan has a cock in God.

2285
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:32,140
Do you know how crazy that would be
if Jesus came back and was really gay?

2286
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:34,091
Yeah.

2287
01:15:34,091 --> 01:15:37,540
If Jesus came back and just all
he wanted to do was give him jobs,

2288
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:38,201
he didn't say,

2289
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:39,670
we're amazing.

2290
01:15:39,671 --> 01:15:40,360
Yeah,

2291
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:40,931
you would like,

2292
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:41,890
you were really skeptical.

2293
01:15:41,891 --> 01:15:42,131
You're like,

2294
01:15:42,131 --> 01:15:43,390
why would I let them jerk me off?

2295
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:44,283
Jesus.

2296
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:47,230
You're not going to say now if
Jesus wants to give you a hand job,

2297
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:48,123
you're not saying no.

2298
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:48,970
We'd be like,

2299
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:49,391
he'd be like,

2300
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:49,721
listen,

2301
01:15:49,721 --> 01:15:53,400
I'll tell you all about spirituality
and enlightenment per first want to jerk

2302
01:15:53,410 --> 01:15:53,730
you off.

2303
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,180
And when you're calm sprays out,

2304
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:57,190
it turns into babies immediately.

2305
01:15:57,520 --> 01:15:57,701
No,

2306
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:58,510
it's rainbows.

2307
01:15:58,510 --> 01:15:58,991
Oh yeah.

2308
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:00,640
Just sparkling rainbows.

2309
01:16:00,940 --> 01:16:02,470
Smells the litter hours.

2310
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:04,690
As soon as you come,

2311
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:06,790
you're instantly as gay as Jesus.

2312
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,600
Yeah.

2313
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:07,811
Well,

2314
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:08,980
I mean how do you go back?

2315
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:09,933
It's hard.

2316
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:10,211
Yeah.

2317
01:16:10,211 --> 01:16:12,430
When he jerks you off and it's
way better than sex with a woman,

2318
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:13,510
you have a choice to make.

2319
01:16:14,260 --> 01:16:15,490
It's not even a choice.

2320
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:19,733
Oh,

2321
01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:20,530
okay.

2322
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,930
We have maps of skin walker,

2323
01:16:22,931 --> 01:16:27,820
ranch.org there's maps of where the
most activity is taking place Dunkin,

2324
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,470
which is very important.

2325
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:32,620
You know what the problem with a website
like that as once they've been talking

2326
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,590
about some mess that can
congeal into an animal,

2327
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:38,980
then everything else becomes invalidated.

2328
01:16:39,010 --> 01:16:39,810
It doesn't it.

2329
01:16:39,810 --> 01:16:41,590
It feels like whatever.

2330
01:16:41,591 --> 01:16:44,200
This website is not the
right place to go to.

2331
01:16:44,380 --> 01:16:44,531
Well,

2332
01:16:44,531 --> 01:16:46,680
if you ever seen how big
skin Walker ranch know,

2333
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:47,770
it's enormous.

2334
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:48,761
It's a,

2335
01:16:48,761 --> 01:16:51,370
I believe it's more than 2000 acres.

2336
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,300
I think we should look at the Wikipedia
for skin Walker ranch before we look at

2337
01:16:55,301 --> 01:17:00,301
this freaks mushroom website because I
think Wikipedia has got a pretty accurate

2338
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:01,990
description of what's going on.

2339
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:02,860
It's going skin walk around.

2340
01:17:02,861 --> 01:17:03,520
Do they?

2341
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:03,821
Yeah,

2342
01:17:03,821 --> 01:17:04,660
cause I looked it up.

2343
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:05,141
Okay.

2344
01:17:05,141 --> 01:17:06,370
What does Wikipedia say?

2345
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:07,541
I can't remember.

2346
01:17:07,541 --> 01:17:08,020
I,

2347
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,010
my main understanding of skin

2348
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:13,520
walker ranch comes from Dr. Eric Davis.

2349
01:17:14,060 --> 01:17:14,480
Okay.

2350
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:14,751
Says,

2351
01:17:14,751 --> 01:17:17,030
according to local
legend Skin Walker ranch,

2352
01:17:17,031 --> 01:17:19,010
also known as Sherman ranch,

2353
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:24,250
is a property located approximately
480 acres south east of Bowerbird,

2354
01:17:25,491 --> 01:17:26,270
Utah.

2355
01:17:26,270 --> 01:17:31,040
That is allegedly the site of
paranormal and Ufo related activities.

2356
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:35,600
It's name is taken from the skin
Walker of native American legend.

2357
01:17:35,601 --> 01:17:36,260
Okay.

2358
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,640
Let's see what the hell the skin walker,

2359
01:17:37,641 --> 01:17:38,474
has he ever heard of that?

2360
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:39,200
Nope.

2361
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:39,501
Okay.

2362
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:41,750
Let's a skin walker,

2363
01:17:41,780 --> 01:17:42,081
boom,

2364
01:17:42,081 --> 01:17:42,321
boom,

2365
01:17:42,321 --> 01:17:43,154
boom.

2366
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:44,540
And some native American legends.

2367
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:49,541
A skin walker is a person
with the supernatural ability
to turn into any animal

2368
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:51,500
he or she desires.

2369
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:53,180
You know what that really is?

2370
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:54,610
Why Pay Aod?

2371
01:17:54,710 --> 01:17:55,041
Yeah.

2372
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:55,400
Right.

2373
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:56,233
That's what that is.

2374
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:57,500
Is their pay Odi out there?

2375
01:17:57,501 --> 01:17:58,590
Hell yeah.

2376
01:17:58,640 --> 01:17:59,000
Uh,

2377
01:17:59,000 --> 01:17:59,721
San Pedro,

2378
01:17:59,721 --> 01:18:02,000
Cactus Sun all day.

2379
01:18:02,870 --> 01:18:03,321
Okay.

2380
01:18:03,321 --> 01:18:08,060
To be able to transform legend
sometimes requires that the skin walker.

2381
01:18:08,061 --> 01:18:12,830
Where's a pelt of the animal though
this is not always considered necessary.

2382
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,060
So they get high,

2383
01:18:14,330 --> 01:18:15,500
they see guy with a fur coat.

2384
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:16,400
They think it's a bear.

2385
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:18,133
We're out.

2386
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:18,800
Sure.

2387
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,670
Solve that one.

2388
01:18:19,730 --> 01:18:20,091
Sure.

2389
01:18:20,091 --> 01:18:20,630
Thank you.

2390
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:21,463
You're welcome.

2391
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:22,221
You're welcome.

2392
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:23,360
Native Americans,

2393
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:24,800
you can drop the silliness.

2394
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:25,820
Hey man,

2395
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:28,520
back when you had no TV
and he did have payoti.

2396
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,030
This is the kind of things
he believed claims about.

2397
01:18:32,031 --> 01:18:34,520
The ranch first appeared
in the Salt Lake City,

2398
01:18:34,521 --> 01:18:36,080
Utah Desert.

2399
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,033
Deseret.

2400
01:18:37,090 --> 01:18:37,930
It says desert.

2401
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:42,140
Brett says desert rat d s e r e t news.

2402
01:18:42,141 --> 01:18:42,980
Is that sounds right.

2403
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:43,970
It is actually correct.

2404
01:18:43,971 --> 01:18:45,110
It's the Deseret news.

2405
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,063
Hmm.

2406
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,240
I wonder why they call it the

2407
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:49,041
no,

2408
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:50,600
it's the Deseret news.

2409
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:53,391
Oh,

2410
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:54,320
it's a Mormon term.

2411
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:54,971
Deseret.

2412
01:18:54,971 --> 01:18:55,804
Some Mormon term.

2413
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,050
Silly pitches.

2414
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,030
Bunch of Voodoo fuckheads.

2415
01:18:59,090 --> 01:18:59,923
Anyway,

2416
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:01,250
um,

2417
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,430
first appeared claims about the ranch,

2418
01:19:04,431 --> 01:19:05,750
first appeared in Salt Lake City,

2419
01:19:05,751 --> 01:19:06,440
Utah,

2420
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,610
Deseret news,

2421
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:12,170
and later in alternative weekly Las
Vegas Mercury as a series of articles by

2422
01:19:12,171 --> 01:19:12,651
journalists.

2423
01:19:12,651 --> 01:19:12,981
George.

2424
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:17,981
Now George snap is one of those guys
that's always involved in like Ufo stuff

2425
01:19:18,261 --> 01:19:19,490
and fringe stuff.

2426
01:19:19,491 --> 01:19:21,110
So Hey,

2427
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,460
all of a sudden I'm going,

2428
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:23,453
ah,

2429
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,201

2430
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:29,020

nap and coauthor comb Kale.

2431
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:31,730
Her subsequently authored a book.

2432
01:19:31,790 --> 01:19:32,211
Oh,

2433
01:19:32,211 --> 01:19:33,560
a book which they're selling,

2434
01:19:33,740 --> 01:19:38,740
which they described the ranch being
acquired by the National Institute for

2435
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:39,860
Discovery Science Needs.

2436
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:40,371
That's big.

2437
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:44,180
Allow yes to study
anecdotal sightings of Ufos,

2438
01:19:44,210 --> 01:19:46,130
bigfoot like creatures,

2439
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,690
crop circles,

2440
01:19:47,691 --> 01:19:48,080
ha,

2441
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,970
glowing orbs and poltergeist activity
reported by its former owners.

2442
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,310
The ranch located in.

2443
01:19:56,090 --> 01:19:57,080
Good luck with this one.

2444
01:19:57,200 --> 01:20:01,410
U.

2445
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,410
I.

2446
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,410
N.

2447
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,410
T.

2448
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,410
A.

2449
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:01,410
H.

2450
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,243
Ooh.

2451
01:20:02,980 --> 01:20:07,980
Ooh Wee wee into county to

2452
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:09,240
winter.

2453
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,073
Is that what it is?

2454
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:11,700
I see it the winter.

2455
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:12,300
Winter.

2456
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:12,840
You sure?

2457
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:13,110
Yeah.

2458
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:13,943
Okay.

2459
01:20:14,370 --> 01:20:14,870
Okay.

2460
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:19,870
The ranch located in west Uintah county
bordering on the Indian reservation was

2461
01:20:21,531 --> 01:20:26,531
popular dub the Ufo ranch due to its
ostensible 50 year history of odd events

2462
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:28,730
said to have taken place there.

2463
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,230
According to these folks,

2464
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:34,880
they saw or investigated evidence of
close to 100 incidents that include

2465
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:40,240
vanishing and mutilated cattle sightings
of unidentified flying objects or orbs,

2466
01:20:40,941 --> 01:20:43,760
large animals with piercing yellow eyes,

2467
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:49,030
paying odor that they say were not
injured when they were struck by boards.

2468
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:49,731
That's the,

2469
01:20:49,731 --> 01:20:50,060
uh,

2470
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:50,893
the bulletproof

2471
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:56,630
and invisible objects admitting
destructive magnetic fields.

2472
01:20:56,870 --> 01:21:01,870
Among those involved the retired
army colonel John Be Alexander,

2473
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:07,750
who characterize the needs effort as an
attempt to get hard data using standard

2474
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:09,710
scientific approach.

2475
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:10,401
However,

2476
01:21:10,401 --> 01:21:15,140
the investigators admitted to difficulty
obtaining evidence consistent with

2477
01:21:15,141 --> 01:21:16,640
scientific publication.

2478
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:19,411
Yeah,

2479
01:21:19,411 --> 01:21:20,640
but that right there,

2480
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:24,090
that admittance is what
lends them credibility.

2481
01:21:24,830 --> 01:21:29,010
The people who don't say stuff like that
or the people who you shouldn't trust.

2482
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:30,090
But when you have scientists saying,

2483
01:21:30,150 --> 01:21:30,331
yeah,

2484
01:21:30,331 --> 01:21:34,590
we couldn't really find the evidence for
some reason it lends a little bit more

2485
01:21:34,591 --> 01:21:36,810
credibility to the two reports,

2486
01:21:36,811 --> 01:21:38,070
especially when one,

2487
01:21:38,071 --> 01:21:39,360
I talked to one of the scientists,

2488
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,320
Dr. Eric Davis,

2489
01:21:40,321 --> 01:21:43,650
and he said that he saw something with
his own eyes and I really don't see why

2490
01:21:43,651 --> 01:21:45,240
that guy would have any
reason to lie to me.

2491
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:46,341
Well,

2492
01:21:46,341 --> 01:21:48,050
I'm just skeptic James.

2493
01:21:48,051 --> 01:21:53,051
Randy awarded Bigelow a pig assists award
for funding purchase of the property

2494
01:21:53,721 --> 01:21:58,280
for what he termed a useless
study of a haunted ranch in Utah.

2495
01:21:58,430 --> 01:21:58,821
James,

2496
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:01,100
Randy is like such a Douche.

2497
01:22:01,130 --> 01:22:01,341
Yeah,

2498
01:22:01,341 --> 01:22:02,150
I seems like it.

2499
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,710
It seems like a real party pooper.

2500
01:22:03,740 --> 01:22:04,573
Yeah.

2501
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:06,200
So what a party pooper man,

2502
01:22:06,201 --> 01:22:06,740
the guy wants.

2503
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:09,110
Guy's got $1 billion once by a UFO ranch.

2504
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:11,480
Why are you going to give him an award?

2505
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:15,110
I'm going to give you the biggest
is towards a Pegasus is a pig.

2506
01:22:15,111 --> 01:22:15,960
That flight,

2507
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:21,280
get it tongue in cheek when pigs fly
and it's awarded by noted skeptic James

2508
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:22,590
Renner.

2509
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:22,681
Well,

2510
01:22:22,681 --> 01:22:24,120
it shouldn't Randy be happy.

2511
01:22:24,121 --> 01:22:25,860
But when the scientist report that they,

2512
01:22:25,950 --> 01:22:26,280
there's,

2513
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,113
they didn't find any.

2514
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:28,080
No,

2515
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:28,671
because his,

2516
01:22:28,671 --> 01:22:31,860
his ego is wrapped up and debunking thing.

2517
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:32,340
Right.

2518
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:36,270
And if he can like glow attention
to himself by giving out an award,

2519
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:37,191
if they,

2520
01:22:37,191 --> 01:22:39,390
if you fos did exist
and he found evidence,

2521
01:22:39,391 --> 01:22:41,010
he'd probably like sweep it under the rug.

2522
01:22:41,090 --> 01:22:41,271
Right.

2523
01:22:41,271 --> 01:22:41,490
How's it?

2524
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,323
Let's see here.

2525
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:42,850
Yeah,

2526
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,100
keep the foundation going.

2527
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:44,491
Yeah.

2528
01:22:44,491 --> 01:22:44,850
Right.

2529
01:22:44,850 --> 01:22:45,301
You know,

2530
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:47,460
I mean obviously probably not.

2531
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,590
Probably be shitting his
pants and start apologizing.

2532
01:22:49,591 --> 01:22:50,040
Yeah.

2533
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:50,873
Probably be like,

2534
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,620
it would be like a psychedelic experience.

2535
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:54,720
It depends on what kind of alien it was.

2536
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:55,501
Well,

2537
01:22:55,501 --> 01:22:57,870
if it was like some close encounters
of the third contact shit,

2538
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,270
that would be a pretty
soggy dog experience.

2539
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:02,610
If a gigantic duty,

2540
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,100
if that just

2541
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:09,190
hovered over the desert floor
and these little tiny dudes,

2542
01:23:09,191 --> 01:23:12,490
giant heads and big black eyes
came out and started talking to us.

2543
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,170
What'd you get on the ship?

2544
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,183
Nope.

2545
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:16,600
I think that's the funniest thing.

2546
01:23:16,601 --> 01:23:17,700
That guy just gets onboard.

2547
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,730
That's so stupid.

2548
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:19,631
Why would you do that?

2549
01:23:19,631 --> 01:23:19,721
Then?

2550
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:21,280
You're stuck with these
little assholes forever.

2551
01:23:22,090 --> 01:23:23,080
Even at your jokes.

2552
01:23:23,890 --> 01:23:24,400
Jokes.

2553
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:25,420
That's how they go hunting.

2554
01:23:25,570 --> 01:23:26,980
Does no comedy clubs in space.

2555
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:29,830
They probably don't have
any porn and if they did,

2556
01:23:29,831 --> 01:23:30,910
it's them fucking,

2557
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:32,890
and the way they fuck is
probably with their fingers.

2558
01:23:32,891 --> 01:23:37,000
They probably handshake each other
and fall down spasm and orgasm.

2559
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,160
They're big heads.

2560
01:23:39,161 --> 01:23:40,180
The reason why they're big heads,

2561
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:43,900
the outside of it as a cushion for when
they black out and they shake hands and

2562
01:23:43,901 --> 01:23:44,734
come,

2563
01:23:44,950 --> 01:23:45,581
they fall.

2564
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:48,700
They're big heads bounce like a fucking
book below and it's to protect their

2565
01:23:48,701 --> 01:23:50,080
brains inside Donk,

2566
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:50,471
donk,

2567
01:23:50,471 --> 01:23:50,780
donk,

2568
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,613
donk.

2569
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,320
It's like a ball bouncing.

2570
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:54,370
You wouldn't get on a ship.

2571
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,510
No fucking way.

2572
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:56,530
I'd like people.

2573
01:23:56,830 --> 01:23:57,611
I'm really happy.

2574
01:23:57,611 --> 01:23:59,500
I'm a person and I like people.

2575
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:01,030
I don't need to go to space.

2576
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,410
I think it'd be cool to see it.

2577
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:02,921
I'd be,

2578
01:24:02,921 --> 01:24:04,300
it'd be cool to like look at the shit,

2579
01:24:04,301 --> 01:24:07,360
but what have you going to
take me like a monkey in a zoo?

2580
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,970
Do you think those chimps want to
be in the zoo the fuck they do?

2581
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:11,103
Of course they don't.

2582
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:16,200
And why would they differentiate between
the way we treat intelligent animals

2583
01:24:16,391 --> 01:24:18,910
like dolphins and throw him
in a fucking swimming pool?

2584
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:22,900
Why would they decide to treat us so
much better than the way we've treated

2585
01:24:22,901 --> 01:24:23,950
everything that we see?

2586
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:24,300
Right.

2587
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,650
You think when at Dolphin
ends up on a seaworld bout,

2588
01:24:26,651 --> 01:24:31,110
it thinks it's the same as being on a
Ufo and it's super intelligent name on

2589
01:24:31,111 --> 01:24:31,360
mine.

2590
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,130
It's probably like these
on wonderful beings.

2591
01:24:33,131 --> 01:24:34,480
They're taking me to paradise.

2592
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:35,411
The next thing you know,

2593
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:38,670
they spit it out in some piss out pool.

2594
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:40,720
Are they going to do flips for toddlers?

2595
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:41,650
Exactly.

2596
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:42,910
When w you know,

2597
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:43,510
we,

2598
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:48,030
we see a mountain lion eat a dog
and we shoot that mountain lion.

2599
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:51,970
We justify murdering the Sanama
because this animal murders,

2600
01:24:52,230 --> 01:24:54,670
if we see us imprisoning dolphins,

2601
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:57,100
if these aliens see us in prison dolphins,

2602
01:24:57,101 --> 01:24:58,300
why wouldn't they imprison us?

2603
01:24:58,630 --> 01:24:58,721
Oh,

2604
01:24:58,721 --> 01:24:59,554
these guys are dicks.

2605
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:04,120
Maybe aliens only should go to seaworld
and the zoo and just scoop up zookeepers

2606
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:07,270
and trainers take those finance,

2607
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:09,370
all the,

2608
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:14,370
all the kids clapping their hands as these
super intelligent beings that used to

2609
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:16,510
be able to swim through an infinite,

2610
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:20,980
practically infinite sea with their
tribe and their family are now like doing

2611
01:25:20,981 --> 01:25:22,930
embarrassing tricks for fish,

2612
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:23,920
for shitheads.

2613
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,430
It's the worst of the worst.

2614
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,500
So I,

2615
01:25:28,590 --> 01:25:29,560
I wouldn't get on board.

2616
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:31,750
That's how I'm feeling.

2617
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:35,470
There's no way I wouldn't even think
about getting on board if they landed and

2618
01:25:35,471 --> 01:25:35,831
they like,

2619
01:25:35,831 --> 01:25:37,560
would you like to come with
us to another galaxy table?

2620
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:38,403
Like a bitch?

2621
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:39,880
Get the fuck out of here.

2622
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,590
Like driving now man,

2623
01:25:41,591 --> 01:25:42,970
you've given a good marriage.

2624
01:25:45,070 --> 01:25:47,860
So do you think that's what
it was at Richard Dreyfus?

2625
01:25:47,861 --> 01:25:48,521
He didn't really,

2626
01:25:48,521 --> 01:25:49,930
wasn't really a good his family.

2627
01:25:49,931 --> 01:25:50,411
And he was like,

2628
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:51,250
fuck these kids,

2629
01:25:51,251 --> 01:25:52,084
I'm going to get on board.

2630
01:25:52,090 --> 01:25:55,350
It's the ultimate thing cause he knows
he's wanting to get a divorce and he just

2631
01:25:55,351 --> 01:25:55,721
says thinking,

2632
01:25:55,721 --> 01:25:59,170
do I want to go through
divorce proceedings or fly
to Alpha Centauri with these

2633
01:25:59,260 --> 01:26:00,280
watermelon heads.

2634
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,800
Do you know that Steven Spielberg said
that if he made them moving today after

2635
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:04,461
having children,

2636
01:26:04,461 --> 01:26:05,450
he would do it differently.

2637
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:06,110
What would he do?

2638
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:09,680
He wouldn't leave his children and that
he wouldn't have had Richard Drivers get

2639
01:26:09,681 --> 01:26:10,640
on board the space ship.

2640
01:26:10,641 --> 01:26:12,560
And that was something
that a single man would do.

2641
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:13,691
And that a,

2642
01:26:13,691 --> 01:26:15,260
a person who has children wouldn't do.

2643
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:17,870
And that to me makes all
the sense in the world.

2644
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:18,380
Sure.

2645
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:18,920
Cause that's,

2646
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:19,753
that's,

2647
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:22,100
I kind of thought that when
I watched it I was like,

2648
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:22,401
man,

2649
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:23,660
I got just leaving his kids.

2650
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:24,680
Like that's kind of fucked up.

2651
01:26:24,681 --> 01:26:25,580
Give me a break man.

2652
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:28,010
There was a lot of guys
who walk into casinos,

2653
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:28,701
like drive his,

2654
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:30,170
walked into that Ufo.

2655
01:26:30,370 --> 01:26:30,740
Yeah.

2656
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:33,660
They just go wandering in
with a smile on their face.

2657
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:34,850
Cla Or brats.

2658
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,250
I'm going to the slots.

2659
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:39,793
That's true.

2660
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:40,211
They me,

2661
01:26:40,211 --> 01:26:40,371
me,

2662
01:26:40,371 --> 01:26:40,531
me,

2663
01:26:40,531 --> 01:26:40,741
me,

2664
01:26:40,741 --> 01:26:40,930
me,

2665
01:26:40,930 --> 01:26:41,051
me,

2666
01:26:41,051 --> 01:26:41,161
me,

2667
01:26:41,161 --> 01:26:41,291
me,

2668
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:41,441
me,

2669
01:26:41,441 --> 01:26:41,591
me,

2670
01:26:41,591 --> 01:26:41,731
me,

2671
01:26:41,731 --> 01:26:41,860
me,

2672
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:42,041
me,

2673
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:42,651
meaning Ding,

2674
01:26:42,651 --> 01:26:42,891
Ding,

2675
01:26:42,891 --> 01:26:43,131
Ding,

2676
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:43,371
Ding,

2677
01:26:43,371 --> 01:26:44,090
Ding.

2678
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:45,350
And really kind of similar.

2679
01:26:45,351 --> 01:26:46,880
That's an alien environment as well.

2680
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:47,180
Yeah.

2681
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:47,421
I mean,

2682
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:49,940
where do you ever get that
many electronic noises?

2683
01:26:49,941 --> 01:26:51,220
All screaming at you,

2684
01:26:51,221 --> 01:26:52,040
man trap.

2685
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:52,550
Yeah.

2686
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,980
It's like when you lay out
traps for rats with cheese,

2687
01:26:54,981 --> 01:26:56,240
that's tourists.

2688
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:00,740
Every fucking one of them has like a
video screen above it with dancing girls

2689
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:05,060
and tight dresses and everyone's
cheering when the money flows.

2690
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:05,540
Famous

2691
01:27:05,540 --> 01:27:06,860
TV shows.

2692
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:08,510
It's very,

2693
01:27:08,511 --> 01:27:09,590
very hypnotic.

2694
01:27:09,591 --> 01:27:11,510
I've thrown money into the slots.

2695
01:27:11,511 --> 01:27:12,271
When I go to vague,

2696
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:12,501
I said,

2697
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:13,850
grabs my attention.

2698
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:14,510
Yeah,

2699
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:15,650
and it's somehow calming,

2700
01:27:15,651 --> 01:27:19,580
like it's fills up so many of your
senses that it really is like a weirdly

2701
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:21,470
calming experience to gamble.

2702
01:27:21,790 --> 01:27:21,990
Right?

2703
01:27:21,990 --> 01:27:22,531
Yeah.

2704
01:27:22,531 --> 01:27:23,460
For a lot of folks,

2705
01:27:23,461 --> 01:27:27,210
it's incredibly intoxicating too because
it goes back to that hunter gatherer

2706
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:27,790
thing,

2707
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:29,850
but we don't have any
real risk in our lives.

2708
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:32,490
We don't have any real
immediate risk reward.

2709
01:27:32,491 --> 01:27:35,550
There's a life and death
aspect to losing $1,000.

2710
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:35,790
Right?

2711
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:36,091
You're like,

2712
01:27:36,091 --> 01:27:36,751
oh my God,

2713
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:37,110
that's a,

2714
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:40,410
it's a month of my life or
that's a week of my life saving.

2715
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:41,130
You know,

2716
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:41,491
he like,

2717
01:27:41,491 --> 01:27:44,940
if you think about how much money can
you save in a month for most folks that

2718
01:27:44,941 --> 01:27:45,780
are kind of getting by,

2719
01:27:45,781 --> 01:27:47,820
if you could save $1,000 a month,

2720
01:27:47,821 --> 01:27:48,840
that's pretty damn good.

2721
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:51,690
That's put away 12 grand
a year for most folks.

2722
01:27:51,691 --> 01:27:52,524
That's pretty good.

2723
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,480
So you're really losing a month of your
life when you gamble or possibly gaining

2724
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:58,130
a month.

2725
01:27:58,130 --> 01:28:00,540
It's a month and I couldn't
be better this month.

2726
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:01,500
I got by a car.

2727
01:28:01,501 --> 01:28:02,011
Yeah.

2728
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:05,180
There's a life or death aspect
of that that plays upon that.

2729
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:06,210
The same instincts.

2730
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:06,630
Yep.

2731
01:28:06,630 --> 01:28:09,750
They're not being fueled
by this nerved out world.

2732
01:28:10,050 --> 01:28:10,381
Yeah.

2733
01:28:10,381 --> 01:28:10,681
It's,

2734
01:28:10,681 --> 01:28:11,071
yeah,

2735
01:28:11,071 --> 01:28:11,521
you're right,

2736
01:28:11,521 --> 01:28:11,970
man.

2737
01:28:11,970 --> 01:28:12,541
You're right.

2738
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:13,770
We long for something.

2739
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:14,610
Yeah,

2740
01:28:14,610 --> 01:28:15,443
it's true.

2741
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,711
But I,

2742
01:28:16,711 --> 01:28:17,101
you know,

2743
01:28:17,101 --> 01:28:17,340
man,

2744
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:18,173
I don't,

2745
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,210
after talking to Eric Davis
and when you see the footage,

2746
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:22,350
you might think I'm an idiot.

2747
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:24,370
You might just decide
that the guys and is,

2748
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:25,223
uh,

2749
01:28:25,350 --> 01:28:25,741
not,

2750
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:27,360
not on the beam so to speak.

2751
01:28:27,361 --> 01:28:28,141
But I really,

2752
01:28:28,141 --> 01:28:28,974
uh,

2753
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:29,570
I dunno,

2754
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,360
I,

2755
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:35,360
when you have somebody tell you that
they've seen lights hovering lights,

2756
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:38,370
I don't know.

2757
01:28:38,371 --> 01:28:40,640
I guess I'm just naive
because I just pulled,

2758
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,461
I believed him.

2759
01:28:41,461 --> 01:28:41,751
I get it.

2760
01:28:41,751 --> 01:28:41,910
Right.

2761
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:46,500
You didn't feel like he was lying and
it felt legitimate to me and it wasn't

2762
01:28:46,770 --> 01:28:47,280
even,

2763
01:28:47,280 --> 01:28:47,521
look,

2764
01:28:47,521 --> 01:28:49,440
if you're going to lie about a Ufo story,

2765
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:51,090
make it big.

2766
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:51,600
Right.

2767
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,171
You know why?

2768
01:28:52,171 --> 01:28:52,531
Just say,

2769
01:28:52,531 --> 01:28:52,681
yeah,

2770
01:28:52,681 --> 01:28:53,880
I saw hovering lights.

2771
01:28:53,881 --> 01:28:58,881
I don't think that those
lights could have been a hoax.

2772
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:00,690
I have no way to explain it,

2773
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:02,120
you know?

2774
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:02,640
Yeah.

2775
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,350
I just didn't feel like
I was being lied to.

2776
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:05,060
Well,

2777
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:05,410
I mean,

2778
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:08,950
that's interesting because that's the
same feeling that we had when we talked to

2779
01:29:08,951 --> 01:29:09,910
that woman Barbara,

2780
01:29:09,940 --> 01:29:13,540
in the corner store in Washington when
she was talking about Sasquatch and our

2781
01:29:13,541 --> 01:29:14,260
siding.

2782
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:16,870
It sounds completely ridiculous
if you look at it on paper.

2783
01:29:17,080 --> 01:29:18,640
When that woman was talking to us,

2784
01:29:18,641 --> 01:29:19,031
we were like,

2785
01:29:19,031 --> 01:29:19,421
wow,

2786
01:29:19,421 --> 01:29:22,870
she is believable in
a very odd way that I,

2787
01:29:22,871 --> 01:29:25,720
I didn't expect anyone to be believable.

2788
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:27,940
Everybody else told me that Ufo stories,

2789
01:29:27,941 --> 01:29:28,420
and I was like,

2790
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:28,930
Oh yeah,

2791
01:29:28,930 --> 01:29:29,580
okay.

2792
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:30,330
Does that happen?

2793
01:29:30,330 --> 01:29:30,790
Hmm.

2794
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:31,091
Okay.

2795
01:29:31,091 --> 01:29:31,960
Thank you for your story.

2796
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:32,930
But I was like,

2797
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:34,260
this is a little hole.

2798
01:29:34,690 --> 01:29:36,070
But she was talking and I was like,

2799
01:29:36,071 --> 01:29:36,904
whoa.

2800
01:29:36,940 --> 01:29:37,361
You know,

2801
01:29:37,361 --> 01:29:38,081
and I was sober.

2802
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:38,771
So that's,

2803
01:29:38,771 --> 01:29:39,604
that means a lot.

2804
01:29:39,870 --> 01:29:40,500
Yeah,

2805
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:40,801
man.

2806
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:45,060
When this Eric Davis
and a really accurate,

2807
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:50,061
precise way describe the math that
would go into creating a warp drive and

2808
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:54,990
explained wormholes and then pointed out
all these experiments that were getting

2809
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:59,991
no results and then told me that he had
seen hovering lights and made me believe

2810
01:30:00,001 --> 01:30:00,450
him,

2811
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:00,901
I believe.

2812
01:30:00,901 --> 01:30:02,190
I think he saw something out there.

2813
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:04,620
I don't think it's improbable
that something's out there.

2814
01:30:04,621 --> 01:30:06,090
Maybe it's a natural occurrence.

2815
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:06,721
Why not?

2816
01:30:06,721 --> 01:30:07,860
Maybe you know,

2817
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:12,390
certain parts of the Earth have a tendency
to create very rare phenomena that

2818
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:16,500
humans tend to ascribe
as being alien who has,

2819
01:30:16,501 --> 01:30:18,020
maybe it is ball lightning ready.

2820
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:19,770
We'll go out there and
just see ball lightning.

2821
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,431
You know what?

2822
01:30:20,431 --> 01:30:21,990
I've never seen ball lightning.

2823
01:30:21,991 --> 01:30:22,760
I'd love to.

2824
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,060
That would be very cool if we went out
there and just got ball lightning on

2825
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:26,391
film.

2826
01:30:26,391 --> 01:30:27,230
I would be psyched.

2827
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,093
Yeah.

2828
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,920
I don't even know how you
would differentiate between
that and the UFO though.

2829
01:30:30,921 --> 01:30:32,330
We would probably cry UFO first.

2830
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:35,440
We would definitely cry you if I
were going to say we saw a Ufo.

2831
01:30:35,441 --> 01:30:36,274
If a bird phone,

2832
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:40,070
let's just start lying.

2833
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:40,973
Just like they do.

2834
01:30:41,030 --> 01:30:46,030
We should start doing the convention
circuit hooking up with Ufo believers.

2835
01:30:48,290 --> 01:30:51,860
We've got to get together in the hotel
before and get our story straight and

2836
01:30:51,861 --> 01:30:52,161
you're like,

2837
01:30:52,161 --> 01:30:52,521
don't man.

2838
01:30:52,521 --> 01:30:54,010
I'm tired of being anal probed.

2839
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:55,160
Let's leave that out.

2840
01:30:55,220 --> 01:30:55,401
Yeah.

2841
01:30:55,401 --> 01:30:56,300
I don't want to talk about that,

2842
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,230
but listen,

2843
01:30:57,231 --> 01:31:01,400
today we can't do that because in Utah
we talked about anal probing and a little

2844
01:31:01,401 --> 01:31:02,240
thing called the internet.

2845
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,261
So Nevada,

2846
01:31:03,261 --> 01:31:03,551
you have to,

2847
01:31:03,551 --> 01:31:04,140
yeah.

2848
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:04,441
Wow.

2849
01:31:04,441 --> 01:31:05,850
Why did you say that now?

2850
01:31:05,851 --> 01:31:08,250
It didn't stick to that permits the Lore.

2851
01:31:08,251 --> 01:31:09,230
I went with the folk.

2852
01:31:09,240 --> 01:31:10,630
Lord didn't go with the law.

2853
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:10,831
You.

2854
01:31:10,831 --> 01:31:11,820
It's embarrassing.

2855
01:31:11,821 --> 01:31:12,001
It's,

2856
01:31:12,001 --> 01:31:13,920
it's in my mind.

2857
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:14,940
I did well.

2858
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,020
Why'd you say you liked it?

2859
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:17,400
I didn't say I liked her.

2860
01:31:17,401 --> 01:31:17,660
I saw,

2861
01:31:17,660 --> 01:31:18,493
I love that.

2862
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:25,910
Let's go to a skin walker ranch.

2863
01:31:25,911 --> 01:31:26,180
Ben.

2864
01:31:26,180 --> 01:31:26,720
Cool scope.

2865
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:27,470
We're going to go.

2866
01:31:27,470 --> 01:31:28,430
We're going to set up cameras.

2867
01:31:28,431 --> 01:31:29,480
We're going to bring technology,

2868
01:31:29,481 --> 01:31:31,580
we're going to bring our
friend Donnie who has drones,

2869
01:31:31,581 --> 01:31:35,390
are going to try to get the
drones to fly over the property.

2870
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:35,990
Cool.

2871
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:38,900
Only the legal parts where
it's legal to fly over.

2872
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:40,920
Yeah.

2873
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:41,350
Great.

2874
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:42,183
See something cool.

2875
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:42,451
Cool.

2876
01:31:42,451 --> 01:31:44,340
Cause I've never done
anything like that in my life.

2877
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:46,020
Like I've gone out and laid in a yard.

2878
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:49,260
I've gone out in the forest and looked
up in the sky for a few minutes,

2879
01:31:49,261 --> 01:31:53,340
but I've never actively
tried to have a Ufo sighting.

2880
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:56,720
Well maybe [inaudible] it if
you believe Dr. Steven Greer,

2881
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,190
he thinks you can summon them.

2882
01:31:58,910 --> 01:31:59,743
Really?

2883
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,210
How intent.

2884
01:32:01,870 --> 01:32:02,390
Oh really?

2885
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:03,820
Focusing in a tent and they just go,

2886
01:32:03,821 --> 01:32:04,654
hey,

2887
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:05,541
wow man,

2888
01:32:05,541 --> 01:32:07,840
that must be why he has all that
amazing footage of the U of m.

2889
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:09,030
So convenient.

2890
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:10,381
Yeah,

2891
01:32:10,381 --> 01:32:14,100
he does hours of it was very convincing,

2892
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:15,420
very convincing.

2893
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:16,860
That's why he changed the world.

2894
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:20,100
He's got fucking birds and night vision.

2895
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,980
There's a guy named Ryan Skinner and uh,

2896
01:32:22,981 --> 01:32:26,400
we're going to meet him there and he's
been studying skin walker ranch and he's

2897
01:32:26,401 --> 01:32:31,401
going to show us the INS and out and
sort of give us a sense of what other

2898
01:32:31,621 --> 01:32:32,790
people have seen there,

2899
01:32:32,820 --> 01:32:36,180
how much of it's hooey and what
he really believes is going on.

2900
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:37,014
Cool.

2901
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:38,370
Skin Walker ranch baby.

2902
01:32:38,460 --> 01:32:39,150
Here we come.

2903
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:39,983
Can't wait.

2904
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:41,580
Bring sunscreen.

2905
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:43,170
Does it get hot out there?

2906
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:43,860
I am.

2907
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:44,161
Well No,

2908
01:32:44,161 --> 01:32:47,190
I'm saying for the electric magnetic
radiation from the wormholes,

2909
01:32:47,191 --> 01:32:52,191
the sunscreen protects you from that
little thin film of oil and it gets zapped

2910
01:32:53,671 --> 01:32:54,280
by the,

2911
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:58,290
the glow around a magnetic field
of a flying disc and you're fine.

2912
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:59,001
Who knows?

2913
01:32:59,001 --> 01:32:59,241
Man,

2914
01:32:59,241 --> 01:32:59,421
you know,

2915
01:32:59,421 --> 01:33:03,200
there is some small chance that they're
going to find is camera equipment

2916
01:33:03,201 --> 01:33:08,201
scattered everywhere or just withered
up husks our mouth open when Anna scream

2917
01:33:09,711 --> 01:33:11,930
frozen from something that emerged.

2918
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:12,751
Yeah,

2919
01:33:12,751 --> 01:33:14,100
just like cattle mutilations.

2920
01:33:14,370 --> 01:33:15,203
Yeah.

2921
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:16,440
That would be incredible.

2922
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:16,750
Yeah.

2923
01:33:16,750 --> 01:33:17,930
If they had academy inhalation,

2924
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:20,670
but it was a person instead of a
cattle and the same things were done,

2925
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,680
there will be a real problem.

2926
01:33:22,950 --> 01:33:24,930
Have you ever looked at some
of those cattle mutilations?

2927
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,110
It's really good.

2928
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:27,640
It's really freaky stuff.

2929
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:29,950
Regarding the cattle mutilations,

2930
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:34,000
Eric Davis said that they studied this
stuff and they said it seems to be being

2931
01:33:34,001 --> 01:33:36,070
done by humans again man.

2932
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,040
When when people are
Kooks everything's aliens,

2933
01:33:39,070 --> 01:33:39,490
right?

2934
01:33:39,490 --> 01:33:40,660
When you hear somebody say no,

2935
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:41,320
that wasn't a,

2936
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:41,741
that was,

2937
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:42,730
it seems to be like a,

2938
01:33:42,740 --> 01:33:47,170
he said that the cuts were done more by
a scalpel than the lasers that people

2939
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:49,270
report and it seemed to be terrestrial,

2940
01:33:49,271 --> 01:33:49,760
whatever.

2941
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:50,051
You know,

2942
01:33:50,051 --> 01:33:50,861
it's a weird thing.

2943
01:33:50,861 --> 01:33:52,060
Who knows what people are doing it,

2944
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,240
but the fact is this guy was
willing to say that's not aliens.

2945
01:33:55,570 --> 01:34:00,570
So that to me lends credibility to his
report of having seen aliens out there.

2946
01:34:02,080 --> 01:34:02,913
Interesting.

2947
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:03,850
Great stuff.

2948
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:06,280
Do you think that if we
got roasted by aliens,

2949
01:34:06,650 --> 01:34:08,770
Psi Phi would be happy or sad?

2950
01:34:08,930 --> 01:34:09,770
They'd be happy.

2951
01:34:09,860 --> 01:34:10,693
Yeah.

2952
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,530
An alien rose will be amazing.

2953
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:13,550
Not like,

2954
01:34:13,550 --> 01:34:15,560
not like the friars club and
that's what I was thinking.

2955
01:34:17,150 --> 01:34:18,220
I was thinking it'd be like,

2956
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,113
like a roast.

2957
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,570
Like we sit on the DAS and
they'll come up and go,

2958
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,340
here's the funny thing
about Duncan Trussell.

2959
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:27,410
A lot of people don't know that.

2960
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:31,730
Under that Fedora is an
inflatable alien hat crop circle.

2961
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,560
He wants to pretend it's a bald spot.

2962
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:41,240
It's actually a fairly accurate depiction
of all his favorite crop circles

2963
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,090
carved into his head.

2964
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:46,341
All right,

2965
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:47,780
we're going to go skin walker ranch,

2966
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:48,720
boom.

2967
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:49,500
Let's see what's happening.

2968
01:34:49,500 --> 01:34:49,920
Great.

2969
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,480
What do you think going to be successful?

2970
01:34:51,481 --> 01:34:51,701
Yes,

2971
01:34:51,701 --> 01:34:52,534
ma'am.

2972
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:53,461
I think it's,

2973
01:34:53,461 --> 01:34:53,860
I think,

2974
01:34:53,860 --> 01:34:54,270
yes.

2975
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,170
I think we're going to see something.
