00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,620
So I was big on surfing and in the
first month or so that I was in Hawaii,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,820
I went to the apple
store in Honolulu and uh,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,520
I met one of my favorite
surfers of all time.

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:15,301
I got called Kalani,

6
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:16,080
rob,

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,990
and when I was playing Kelly
Slater's pro surfing game,

8
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,350
I would always pick Kalani because
he did the most radical moves,

9
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:22,591
you know,

10
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:23,670
so I'm in the apple store,

11
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,020
he's there with his boys.

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,680
I was like,

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,040
shit,

14
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,873
that's Kalani Romp.

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,230
And then he comes up to me,

16
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:28,561
he's like,

17
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:28,801
dude,

18
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,780
you're that guy in load the rings.

19
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:30,121
I was like,

20
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:30,954
Oh shit,

21
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,250
it's on now.

22
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,690
So I was like,

23
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,171
you're Kalani,

24
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:34,391
rob.

25
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:34,710
I was like,

26
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,270
I'm here for like nine months,

27
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,470
can you help me out surfing?

28
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:37,831
And he was like,

29
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:37,981
yeah,

30
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:39,030
we're going to go the no show now.

31
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:39,830
So I came with him,

32
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:40,560
whoa.

33
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,393
Hung out.

34
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,300
Uh,

35
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,290
and we became really tight.

36
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:45,990
So a huge story for a wife.

37
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:48,360
For me it was getting to know Kalani.

38
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:49,560
I mean he taught me into waves.

39
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,660
I had no business being involved in.

40
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:53,890
There's a place called go
island on the north shore,

41
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,360
which is a heavy wave and you
have to paddle out to an island,

42
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,690
walk across the island because then
you're going to miss the break and then

43
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:01,830
paddle out past the break.

44
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:05,400
There's no concept of you're paddling out
through the break because it's so big.

45
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,790
So as we Kalani and a few of his mates
and we were all getting ready and he came

46
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:10,081
up to me,

47
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:10,890
he was like,

48
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,340
okay,

49
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,650
this is the most hectic wave
I'm ever going to take you into.

50
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,790
Stay close to me.

51
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:15,930
If you need help,

52
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,763
let me know.

53
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,780
Don't fuck around because it can kill you.

54
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,060
And don't go left.

55
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:21,860
Go right.

56
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:21,991
No,

57
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:22,141
no,

58
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:22,980
don't go right.

59
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,720
Go left because going appeal left.

60
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:25,560
But if you go right,

61
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,780
you're in the braking
zone and you're fucked.

62
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:28,230
I was like,

63
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,500
alright,

64
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,333
cool.

65
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,550
So fucking terrible story coming up.

66
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,900
So we.

67
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,400
So we paddle out and I'm having fun and
I'm watching everyone in the lineup.

68
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,420
I'm about 10 feet away from the drop zone,

69
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:43,290
so I'm able to like sit there on the
wave and watch people like or the side.

70
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:43,590
I'm like,

71
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,890
alright,

72
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,610
cool.

73
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,600
I got this fast,

74
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:45,990
I'm going to,

75
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,823
I'm going to take it.

76
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,901
So I paddled out battle.

77
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:51,120
That battle wave picked
me up big like oh shit,

78
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,020
super powerful drops me and
I really try and go left.

79
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:56,460
I like cut the board and
then try and go left.

80
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:59,940
But it's so powerful because breaking
here on my left that it spits me to the

81
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:00,660
rife.

82
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,220
I'm fully aware that it's
about me to the right.

83
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:02,551
So I'm like,

84
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,384
Okay Shit,

85
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,730
I'm just going to wipe out,

86
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,980
take a big breath and paddle out.

87
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,821
So I wipe out.

88
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:13,220
I go on to come up and as is
usually the case with surfing,

89
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,220
anything above overhead when you come up
that wave's coming for you against what

90
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:18,570
you have to do is take a huge breath,

91
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,990
go under and it's the next time you come
up you can make progress because you're

92
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:22,531
out breath,

93
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:23,364
you disoriented.

94
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,280
I do that and Joe,

95
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,190
I just can't.

96
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,930
I can never catch a break,

97
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:28,920
so I go under,

98
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,360
thrown around by the washing machine,

99
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,230
come up the thing.

100
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,411
Okay,

101
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:31,921
get on your board,

102
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,431
start paddling,

103
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:33,091
look ways,

104
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:33,241
right.

105
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:33,660
They're like,

106
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,200
oh,

107
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,790
go and drink and hold my breath.

108
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,301
Come up again.

109
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:38,520
And I'm trying to time
it so that I can get it.

110
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,810
I just getting pounded,

111
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,441
pounded,

112
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:40,951
pounded,

113
00:02:40,951 --> 00:02:41,550
pounded.

114
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,100
And at one point I see
Kalani paddling over to me.

115
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:44,420
I'm like,

116
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,761
all right,

117
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:44,971
cool.

118
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,804
We're going to be okay.

119
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,420
So Kalani comes up to
me and he's like mad,

120
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,490
like I've never really heard him.

121
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:50,040
You mad before?

122
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,281
He's like,

123
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:50,580
Dude,

124
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,350
get on your board and go that way.

125
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,070
I'm like,

126
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:53,580
okay,

127
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,770
that's what I've been trying
to do for like 10 minutes.

128
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,110
But so now he's behind me.

129
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,183
He's paddling,

130
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,770
I'm paddling,

131
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,640
he's pushing me,

132
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,180
paddling,

133
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,691
pushing me,

134
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:03,250
paddling like fucking superman.

135
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,530
And we eventually get out past the break.

136
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:05,980
So he's like,

137
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,170
all right,

138
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:09,340
you're going to sit here for 20 minutes
and then when I'm done you're going to

139
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:10,300
paddle in with me safe.

140
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:10,661
And I was like,

141
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:10,961
okay,

142
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,261
fine.

143
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:11,830
I got it.

144
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,760
So when we come in,

145
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,361
he's like,

146
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,230
the reason why I came in to get you,

147
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:18,790
it was not only were you in the drop
zone but you were like completely lacking

148
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,770
of any color on your face.

149
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,611
And he was like,

150
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,271
people in the line,

151
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:22,661
it was saying,

152
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:22,990
dude,

153
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,610
go get your boy because he's in trouble.

154
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,870
And I was like,

155
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,800
I was handling it.

156
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,560
I was definitely out of
breath and a little fucked up.

157
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,480
But he's a wharton then.

158
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:30,941
So he was like,

159
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:31,750
no,

160
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,870
eight more waves on your headlight that
you wouldn't have had the strength to

161
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:38,370
fight past the wave and
get up here because you get
these little gasps in there.

162
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,240
Dude,

163
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,170
it's so heavy and it
has a really good trick.

164
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:41,981
Colone told me this one.

165
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:42,341
He's like,

166
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,850
if you're under the water and you rolling
around and you're fucked and you need

167
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,684
to take a breath,

168
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,120
drink the tiniest amount of seawater.

169
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,200
Tiny sip.

170
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,850
Just go like that.

171
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,080
Tricks your body into thinking you took
a breath and it will give you an extra

172
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,740
five seconds.

173
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,480
So because you've just taken an in will,

174
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,201
not an inhalation,

175
00:03:59,201 --> 00:03:59,590
but you've,

176
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,510
you've put something in your
body so your lungs are like,

177
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:01,991
okay,

178
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,500
we can chill.

179
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,970
The panic goes for a little bit.

180
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:04,771
Yeah.

181
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:06,900
A lot of the girls I grew up around,

182
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,410
uh,

183
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:07,640
they,

184
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,050
they had to maintain their
virginity for marriage.

185
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,730
So a lot of them took in the.

186
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:12,720
But yes.

187
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,663
Paula,

188
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,880
lot of butts I guess.

189
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,400
Did you know,

190
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,271
is that really true?

191
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,050
That's what they were doing.

192
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:19,321
Well,

193
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:19,620
the,

194
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,891
yeah,

195
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:21,780
the one girl that I was pretty close with,

196
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:23,880
she was 18 years old.

197
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:28,320
I was 13 and like we hung out a lot when
you take the bus to the beach from the

198
00:04:28,321 --> 00:04:31,110
valley and smoked cigarettes and uh,

199
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:31,441
yeah,

200
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,590
she took it in the but

201
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,990
she was five years old and new.

202
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,770
That's it's one thing if
you're 30 and she's 35,

203
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,120
that's totally normal.

204
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:42,660
Sure.

205
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,280
But 15 and 18,

206
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,110
that's a fucking 13.

207
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,963
I was 13.

208
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,150
Fifteen,

209
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,961
13 and 18.

210
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:49,081
Yeah,

211
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,220
that's a giant gap.

212
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:53,120
A Jeff five years is
a giant five years is.

213
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,310
And I think part of that
is she was so sheltered,

214
00:04:56,311 --> 00:05:01,110
she'd grown up in such a strict Persian
family that maybe mentally she was 13.

215
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,471
You know what I mean?

216
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,480
Like I taught her to smoke
cigarettes and stuff.

217
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,473
Whoa.

218
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,700
You told her?

219
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,181
Yeah.

220
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,260
She was real sheltered.

221
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,550
Jesus shed like we take the bus to the
beach and she would have to stop at a

222
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,430
payphone every hour to
call her dad and check in.

223
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,630
That's how strict they were.

224
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,640
Oh my God.

225
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,470
Yeah.

226
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:17,830
That's pretty.

227
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,663
Wow.

228
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,471
Wonder what happened?

229
00:05:19,471 --> 00:05:20,550
What was her rationale?

230
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,881
Well,

231
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:23,160
probably my buddy's buddy.

232
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,420
How many times did you take in the
ass for everything breaks down.

233
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,760
You're driving off road with a
car that's not designed for it.

234
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,270
It's like you got the wrong
direction on that vehicle.

235
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,070
Do you understand?

236
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,650
It's an.

237
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:43,981
I don't,

238
00:05:43,981 --> 00:05:44,580
I've never,

239
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:44,970
you know,

240
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,601
honestly,

241
00:05:45,601 --> 00:05:47,270
it's never been about this

242
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,220
with reasonably good reason.

243
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:50,580
It's,

244
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,740
it's chocolate.

245
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,540
There's a lot of wrong.

246
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,613
I mean she,

247
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,141
first of all,

248
00:05:56,141 --> 00:05:58,790
it be a lot of clean up pre and post.

249
00:05:59,250 --> 00:05:59,960
Yeah.

250
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,540
But second of all this girl,

251
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,400
what was her rationale to maintain purity?

252
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,270
And that's a very common thing.

253
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:06,560
And like,

254
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,970
how did she explained it though,

255
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,890
that I have to be married a virgin,

256
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:10,760
that my father,

257
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,770
they checked the bedsheets on your
wedding night and eat you out if you're a

258
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,663
person

259
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,510
and then he can tell.

260
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,863
That's right Tom.

261
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,460
Exactly how it went.

262
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:25,721
Yeah.

263
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:26,050
Yeah.

264
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:26,883
Normal.

265
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,630
He finishes up and he's like,

266
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,180
yeah,

267
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,871
you're still good.

268
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,130
So it's a little bloody

269
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,900
fucking Christ Jesus Christ.

270
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,980
It's so crazy.

271
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,880
So when she explained it
to where you like at 13,

272
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:41,301
you're probably.

273
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,240
Wait what I mean,

274
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,400
but in the book,

275
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,661
I mean,

276
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:46,520
it's like I knew about sex was.

277
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,020
I mean I was at,

278
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:50,060
I wasn't doing anything.

279
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,090
I mean I was getting my ass fingers.

280
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:53,924
I was 13.

281
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,021
I was very,

282
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:57,291
you know,

283
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,011
an experience.

284
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,330
I was just blown away.

285
00:06:59,331 --> 00:06:59,690
And uh,

286
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,523
and uh,

287
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,640
she was so funny.

288
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,530
This is so a memory I have of her.

289
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:08,450
I was wearing a tank top and it was
summertime and I remember she poked my

290
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:10,280
armpit fat and she goes,

291
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,061
Ooh girl,

292
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,930
you got to have big tvs
where you grow up arm,

293
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,593
fat,

294
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:16,701
fatty,

295
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:17,400
and I in La.

296
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,111
She was right.

297
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:18,321
Yeah,

298
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:19,400
I was armpit fat.

299
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,360
That's hilarious.

300
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:20,721
I just,

301
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:21,830
I thought that it was,

302
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,000
it was bizarre,

303
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,740
but she explained that it was a religious
thing and this was to maintain her

304
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:28,574
purity.

305
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,370
God wants her to take in the
but God wants you to do anal

306
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,690
and then you come out of it and you
slowly come out of it and you were like

307
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:38,410
noise canceling headphones.

308
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:40,840
I'm just in a doctor's
office like in a weird,

309
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,000
not even weird like those
like 19 seventies doctors'
offices that you see in la,

310
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,000
like just sort of a shitty
elevator and whatever.

311
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,930
So when I came out of
the first one I was like,

312
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,640
it was rough because I didn't know
I was going to trip like that and b,

313
00:07:57,641 --> 00:07:58,660
I had been.

314
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,920
I didn't get a ton of sleep
the night before and so I was.

315
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,980
And I'd flown that day.

316
00:08:03,981 --> 00:08:06,100
I was just kind of groggy and,

317
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,480
and I felt really shitty and
it took me like I was like,

318
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,410
after I was done,

319
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:14,560
I probably laid in the bed
there for like an hour.

320
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,340
So it was like,

321
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,840
I can't do shit right now.

322
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,620
Like I can't,

323
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,820
I could barely stand.

324
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,650
So the first day was rough and uh,

325
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,030
and that I still felt shitty that night.

326
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,260
I was like,

327
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,310
I don't think I'm going to do it again.

328
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:27,761
Like,

329
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:28,594
that was too rough.

330
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,973
And um,

331
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,330
then I woke up Tuesday morning
and felt fucking great.

332
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,110
I was like,

333
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:36,943
oh,

334
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,750
um,

335
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,710
I got to do it again,

336
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,491
felt great.

337
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,350
Like I felt clear.

338
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,251
Here's the,

339
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,090
one of the ways my

340
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,050
depression manifested itself was like,

341
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,913
I felt

342
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,100
my head felt heavy and
I felt like I had like,

343
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,490
I had like a weight on my forehead,

344
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,750
you know,

345
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,010
that's the way I felt when
I did ecstasy the day after,

346
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,150
the day after.

347
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,470
I felt it felt amazing when I did that.

348
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,830
And that's what it is because it depletes.

349
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:08,050
Yeah,

350
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:08,350
yeah.

351
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,260
All the Serotonin's gun.

352
00:09:09,261 --> 00:09:09,900
Yeah.

353
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,230
And that's basically what people with
depression a lot of times are like,

354
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,660
just everyday isn't just like a headwind.

355
00:09:15,661 --> 00:09:16,494
It's not,

356
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,760
it's just like fucking,

357
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,410
could this be a little bit easier?

358
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:23,460
Like I'm not asking for a miracle and
just like I'm just sick of having to walk

359
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,780
into the wind all the time,

360
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,990
a little bit uphill into the wind.

361
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,240
Like,

362
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,050
fuck all right.
