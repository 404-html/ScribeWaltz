1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,770
Like officey and shit like that.

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:06,771
But the being able to be in this group
of really cool people to me is one of the

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,200
greatest benefits of being a comedian.

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:13,680
And one of the greatest benefits of
doing something like a podcast and these

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:18,630
guys at Onnit, Aubrey and all of his
employees, it's pretty laid back guy.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,030
They're the nicest fucking people's
he you could ever want to meet.

7
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,150
They're approaching business.

8
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:29,151
The idea of a business where
it's something that we all enjoy,

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:33,800
whether it's supplements for
athletics, for, for a nootropics,

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,610
for the mind or fitness equipment.

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,760
It's all shit that we use all shit that
we feel like there's some real good

12
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:43,920
benefit to having in your life.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,890
A Ham force protein powders
are an excellent example.

14
00:00:46,891 --> 00:00:48,570
It's my favorite protein powder ever.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,150
And I'm not saying that because
I own a piece of the company.

16
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,190
If I didn't have anything
to do with the company,

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:57,030
I will tell you that stuff is the
shit cause it's fucking delicious.

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,370
It's very low in sugar.
It has,

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,930
it has stevia in it for a sweetener,
which is a natural sweetener. So it's,

20
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:08,520
it has less than, I believe it's
maybe one gram of sugar per serving,

21
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,450
but it tastes delicious.
It's really easy for your body to process.

22
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,690
We use the highest protein content.

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,950
Hamp available is the best hamp that
you can buy and it's difficult to get.

24
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,990
We can only buy like
50 pounds of it a day.

25
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,980
They limit it because there's so much as
a massive amount of demand because hemp

26
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:27,930
cannot be grown in the
United States legally.

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,740
So we have to buy it all from Canada. You
could sell it. Yeah, you could sell it.

28
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,560
You can eat it. You can have
it. Cause it's not psychoactive.

29
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:38,880
But the law states that you cannot grow
hemp in the United States so you can get

30
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:41,580
it from other places. Yes,
we, we buy ours from Canada.

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,140
We have to buy it from Canada.
Man.

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,900
It's crazy. So stupid. It's so dumb. And
this is not even by the way, that's study

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,790
drug issue.
It says nothing to do with drugs folks,

34
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:55,290
because hemp is not a psychoactive plan.
It's just not.

35
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:00,140
It's only by ruthless ignorance
that this still exists.

36
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,620
Really ruthless.
Yeah.

37
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,140
Woeful cooperation with
pharmaceutical companies.

38
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,180
Farmers telling flowing people like,
hey, we'd like to grow the art.

39
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,340
They aren't, they would love to. They
pass laws. They pass laws in Vermont. Uh,

40
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,480
they recently passed.

41
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:19,500
Oh, by the way, today is Washington state
legal marijuana day. Congratulations.

42
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:23,640
Everybody says Washington
state, he fucking got your
shit together. Stick with it.

43
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,800
They're the first ones to
get your shit together.

44
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,290
I was in Washington state wants,

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,720
and they guy's got me high level gravity
bong that they made out of a two liter

46
00:02:30,721 --> 00:02:33,270
bottle of soda.
They would put tape,

47
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,160
they touched off the bottom
and then we'll put tape,

48
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,820
like double sided tape and they'd fill
up this whole thing with six thick,

49
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:42,870
thick smoke. And they're like, hit
that. And I was like, yeah. I was like,

50
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,000
I couldn't take it all. They
were like, what's wrong with you?

51
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,920
They would take it all in one hit.
Wow.

52
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,840
Fuck around Seattle. You are bad
motherfuckers. Congratulations.

53
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,490
And Seattle's going to also try
to, um, make a growing hemp, uh,

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,820
legally goes well, yeah. Well, you
know, that's not, no, it's not.

55
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,040
It's all just fucking with

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,670
the federal government, man. The federal
government has these wacky positions.

57
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I heard some of them block you up because
there's a business in locking people

58
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,120
up. I heard somebody put it on a ballot
like one of the states put on about like,

59
00:03:10,121 --> 00:03:13,750
Hey, let's vote on the
federal, can't override our,

60
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,540
our state laws cause it's not
just this sort of state law,

61
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,660
federal law things to gay marriage. And
they eventually want to be like, Hey,

62
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,850
do we have any rights here?
Can we make our own shit?

63
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,980
Yeah, it gets a certain point in time.
It starts getting really ridiculous.

64
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,060
Like why are you going after these people?
It doesn't make any sense.

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,330
Like Rhode Island said that they would
use their state police to defend their

66
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:36,840
citizens with them against
up against federal troops.

67
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,030
And these medical marijuana weights
cause a lot of these federal troops,

68
00:03:39,031 --> 00:03:41,310
by the way, they're not even
federal troops. Like they, they,

69
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:44,870
they've used mercenaries before.
Yeah. They had people that were, uh,

70
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,790
they were wearing black water shirts
and they were rating these. Blackwater,

71
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,300
blackwater is the government,
um, shirts of a, yeah,

72
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,150
they were wearing shirts that said they
worked for blackwater uniform and they

73
00:03:57,151 --> 00:04:01,710
were brave. They were going through
these medical marijuana facilities.

74
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,460
What? It's crazy with machine guns on
their hips. Just some just taking the,

75
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:09,000
we'd taken the weed out. It's the only
man who are you? What are you doing?

76
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,940
They're like, I'm going, what are you,
just some people, cause they have a name,

77
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,290
the name is DEA or you know,
whatever you want to call it. CIA,

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,110
FBI. Anybody wants a string,
a couple of letters together.

79
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:22,530
Then all of a sudden who they are becomes
something different than just a person.

80
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,450
They're allowed to do ridiculous shit.

81
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:29,160
Like arrest you for having plants
yet you can do about it. No.

82
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,160
So we don't sell half a week.
We would love to sell on
it. Would love to have, um,

83
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,630
a whole farm and grow our own hemp.

84
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:38,550
We would love to hire
farmers to grow our shit.

85
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:43,140
We would love to keep the economy
moving in a good direction by providing

86
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,080
something that people want and
putting a lot of people to work.

87
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,910
It's a hemp is $1 billion tech
style just for clothes alone,

88
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,500
just for, for the nutrition that you can
get from it. It's incredibly nutritious.

89
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,543
All He,

90
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,790
I think the killer bee honey. Hey, I
like making sandwiches. Dangerous. Yeah.

91
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,310
I think that's why I
never understood that.

92
00:05:02,311 --> 00:05:05,100
That's how they have handbags and stuff
and all the hippies get like their hemp

93
00:05:05,101 --> 00:05:08,950
dresses. It all has to come from that come
from outside, from outside. All right.

94
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,090
I was always like, how did they not
get arrested? They're fuck heads.

95
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,810
We have all kinds of crazy shit at on it.
Uh,

96
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,440
I there's too much to name including
Buffalo Jerky and, and uh, yeah.

97
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,270
We also have bulletproof coffee.

98
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,450
We just started carrying
Dave Asprey's awesome coffee.

99
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:28,060
Give me some way that buffalo
jerky. Okay, I'll get you some,

100
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,700
we might have some in the back.
Do we have those boxes, Jamie?

101
00:05:30,701 --> 00:05:33,430
Those boxes of a honored
supplements in the back of, so grab,

102
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,990
grab one of those jerky.
It's really good.

103
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,820
They'll have low chairs.

104
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:46,090
We have gummy bears for kids that are
made out of fish oil. It's really weird.

105
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,020
They fucking, you would think they taste
bad. It tastes pretty fucking good. My,

106
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,510
my two year old, just not
mine them. She loves them.

107
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,350
She's asking for more and essentially
there's no, they'll a little bit, a bit,

108
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:01,220
I can taste it, but she doesn't give a
fuck. No, that is, that's, that's buffalo.

109
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,150
That's a, a traditional
buffalo bar where they, um,

110
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,530
they make it with cranberries. Cranberry.
Yeah. And the cranberries sort of,

111
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,220
yeah. It keeps it a, does that
give you a nice chewable bar,

112
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,960
pregnant crawfish and it
explodes in your mouth.

113
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,671
Do you remember?

114
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,671
We were on the road somewhere and
you go into eat the crawfish head and

115
00:06:25,681 --> 00:06:29,320
something blew up in your mouth.
Some of those things,

116
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,580
it was like a fear factor style. You
all spit it up. It was pretty nasty.

117
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,990
Like Donna Martin graduates.

118
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,410
It was pretty nasty. This
is not taste, death, fishy.

119
00:06:40,411 --> 00:06:43,890
These nautical Omega three jellies,
but your kids will eat them.

120
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:48,891
And it's been shown that fish oil
is crucial to a child's development,

121
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,730
mental development too. And
also mental function. Um,

122
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,250
and as well as a muscle recovery
like fish oil is amazing.

123
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:58,590
And it's great for joints. Uh, it's,

124
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:03,510
it's really incredible how much different
you feel taking fish oil. Like if you,

125
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,650
I urge anyone,

126
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:07,830
if you have like knee problems are
elbow issues or something like that,

127
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:13,490
try taking a lot of fish oil because
fish oil is incredible for that shit.

128
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,520
It's an, it's an antiinflammatory, but
it also, I don't know what it does,

129
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,640
whether it Lubes your, your, your
joints, it doesn't make any sense.

130
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:23,580
It doesn't make any sense
that we've loads are joining.

131
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:24,780
So that's how I like to look at it.

132
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,040
But I think about a doctor I'd make fun
of me for saying that. And it was like,

133
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,730
this isn't how it works. Dumb
ass, but whatever it does,
it's awesome. Um, so, uh,

134
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:36,310
that's uh, and that's not even something
on it sells bitch. I'm just telling you.

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,620
Go get yourself some fish oil. Wait, what
about you don't have any fish oil? Yeah,

136
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:42,450
for little kids.
Why are this is just for little kids.

137
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,270
Well you could have them too cause you're
kind of a little kid at heart and you

138
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:47,410
like candy. Like, well
I don't understand why.

139
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,790
It isn't just the idea is that it's
just to trick a little kids into taking

140
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,210
something healthy into their body. It's
a little kids. It's really difficult.

141
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,720
Other adults will take fish
oil supplements because they
know it's good for them.

142
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,130
But why don't they just make it the same?
Like it's a nice way to take it.

143
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,660
It doesn't have to be gross for us.
Um,

144
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,330
because most people are adults and
they don't. They don't. It doesn't,

145
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:09,390
wouldn't it be nicer to have the
candy as you take it instead of,

146
00:08:09,391 --> 00:08:13,140
I like a big horse pill. I guess. I
don't give a fuck. So you give a fuck.

147
00:08:13,141 --> 00:08:16,950
It doesn't bother me taking vitamins. I
just take them. But wouldn't it be better?

148
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,620
No, it wouldn't be [inaudible]
Chu woman. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

149
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,080
Swallow them. Do you want some of this?
No. Thank you. That's the only delicious.

150
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,090
Anyway,
use a code name broken.

151
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,150
This is the longest commercial for
on and never use a code name. Rogan.

152
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,630
And you will save yourself 10%
off any and all supplements.

153
00:08:33,631 --> 00:08:37,050
Stamp of approval on the beef jerky.
100 Buffalo Jerky. Yeah, it's bad ass.

154
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,290
And this is a 100% money back
guarantee on all of the supplements,

155
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,580
whether it's Alpha brain or shroom tech
or we're only selling you the best shit

156
00:08:44,581 --> 00:08:49,581
we could possibly sell you the best shit
we can find and nobody's trying to rip

157
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:51,920
you off.
So the way it works is you,

158
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,490
you bought a supplement and you have
a 90 day window to get 100% money back

159
00:08:56,491 --> 00:08:58,380
guarantee.
You don't have to send the product back.

160
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,060
You just say it didn't work for me.
Look,

161
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
the Alpha brain thing is especially
controversial because I guess it doesn't,

162
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,360
I don't know what
anyone's body experiences.

163
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,630
I have no idea what coffee does to
you. I know what it does to me. Uh,

164
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,250
I know what works for me and a,
I know it works for a lot of other people.

165
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:17,491
There's a,

166
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:21,450
there's a difference between me when I'm
taking nootropics and taking vitamins

167
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:23,220
and eating healthy and when I'm not,

168
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:27,750
and there's a difference in my ability
to form sentences for, you know,

169
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,910
for me that's, that's a pretty
important shit. You know,

170
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:33,210
whether it's doing commentary you're
doing stand up or doing this, you know,

171
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,800
so Alpha brain to me is a godsend. If
I, if I don't have that shit, I panic.

172
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,100
Um, we follow a step behind your
brand. You can feel it. Yeah.

173
00:09:41,101 --> 00:09:43,740
There's some in there. Grabbed, grabbed
that box. Give me some of that shit.

174
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,120
Nutrients,
my friend nutrients for your fucking dome.

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,220
This is the honest mini
CFCs rescue by. Yeah, let's,

176
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,780
let's get out of this commercial. Cuban
music. I've done enough of these people.

177
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,660
Use a code name, Bro.
Going to go fuck yourself.

178
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,710
Hello savages. Hello. Great people.

179
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,180
We're so sorry that we're starting
40 minutes late. But uh, this, uh,

180
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:21,560
this new studio, it has a few
bugs. That's how it works folks.

181
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:23,990
It's like when you build a car,
it's hot.

182
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,630
We're trying to get it haunted.
We're trying to get some,

183
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm an antique clock in here
cause you can get a clock.

184
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,490
You can get a clock from the 18
hundreds and shit. You know, I,

185
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,130
I've found that quite a few of them
online. I just think that would be dope.

186
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
Just have the soul. Yeah, some clock
that's been around since the 18 hundreds.

187
00:10:44,001 --> 00:10:47,790
You know, it's nice to have a thinking
after the past. Yeah, I dunno. It's uh,

188
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:51,770
just kinda creepy and haunted.
I think that's kind of bad ass.

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,270
How fast this stuff hit you.
Alpha brain. Um, it doesn't,

190
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,100
I don't know how it's going to hit
you but it doesn't really hit me.

191
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,170
It just sort of ramps me up slowly. It's
not like that in or does it just like,

192
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,400
no, the first pill you could
feel it pretty quickly.

193
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,300
I mean you could take to and
feel a difference. Your, your,

194
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,110
your brain will definitely be stimulated,

195
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
but when you take it on a regular
basis that I find if the best benefits,

196
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:21,560
it's nutrients. You
know, it's a, you know,

197
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,120
new nutrients are very controversial.

198
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:25,070
There's a lot of people that think you
should be able to get everything you can

199
00:11:25,071 --> 00:11:25,910
get with your diet.

200
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,390
And I say that's kind of silly because
you can get everything we want to get

201
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,410
with your diet,
but you know what you can also do.

202
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,940
You can get everything and then take
some extra shit and be on top of things.

203
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,190
Also, like you can get everything,
but who's going to get over there?

204
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,580
It's fucking hard. You know?
If you like yummy food,

205
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,220
if you want to eat salads, like dude,
if I was, if I was just thing as you,

206
00:11:49,221 --> 00:11:50,720
I would gorge all the time and I'm like,
no,

207
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:53,380
you stay as thin as me so
you can gorge on occasion.

208
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,440
Yeah. Our got big and
disciplined himself. Yeah,

209
00:11:56,441 --> 00:12:00,460
but then there's Jason Tebow who he can
eat a million pizzas with hamburgers

210
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:04,330
inside of them and you still won't even
get one little, it's always been him.

211
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,940
Jason Tebow. Yeah. Yeah. He's a skinny
motherfucker. Some people like that, man,

212
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,280
there's, there's dudes who just
can't gain weight. That's awesome.

213
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,880
I talked to [inaudible] about
it. I was like, yeah, it
can't just be eating habits.

214
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:19,780
I've got to have some sort of better
ability to burn fat than you do.

215
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,650
You said that to him? Well, yeah, we were
talking about like we both love candy.

216
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:26,470
It's like not like I'm living with the
straight and narrow all the time. Right,

217
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
right. It's like I should be, I should
be closer to what he looks like.

218
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,550
How often do you exercising?
Um, basketball. Once a week.

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,180
That's it. That's about it. Wow. Yeah.

220
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,420
You don't long to do anything more than
that and that you don't get driven like

221
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:42,850
you were doing. No,
that's not true. Yeah. No,

222
00:12:42,851 --> 00:12:45,680
I go up and and going up to Runyon
Canyon a lot. Oh yeah. Hiking. Yeah.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,620
That's legit.
It's just gone for the last week.

224
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:52,090
People make fun of hiking like Ooh was
fucking basically you're doing like leg

225
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:52,924
lifts,

226
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,220
a little body weight squats over and
over and over again going up hills.

227
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,770
It's fucking Rad in this, in the
winter time like this where you can,

228
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,190
you can really see like for me,

229
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,360
you get up there on the left hand one
you're going to see like all of the ocean

230
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:08,890
and stuff and the whole city
spread out before you. Yeah.
Yeah. Hiking is fun, man.

231
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,060
I think is really fun.

232
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,920
It's fun to just to get out there
and get away from buildings. Yeah.

233
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,080
There's something cool about
being in the woods now.

234
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,030
It's almost like I'm looking at it like,
man,

235
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,130
you mother fuckers aren't going
to be around here for much longer.

236
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,850
What do you mean by the
woods? Oh yeah. Like there.

237
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,300
They appreciate them while you can,

238
00:13:25,301 --> 00:13:27,190
until the whole thing
becomes like blade runner.

239
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,670
It'll all be chopped down at some point.
Right. We need what for everybody?

240
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,420
I don't know how long it takes to
grow a tree, so long. Long time. Well,

241
00:13:34,421 --> 00:13:35,680
that's another thing that hemp can do.

242
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:38,470
You can make buildings and the trees that
are stronger than building's made out

243
00:13:38,471 --> 00:13:41,600
of wood. What really? Yeah. Yeah.
It's crazy. It's a nutty plan.

244
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:47,200
It's really light, but it's super strong.
Like the stalk of hemp, like the, the, uh,

245
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,230
the actual stock of the tree gets
really thick and it's really,

246
00:13:50,231 --> 00:13:54,820
it's a bizarre plant. It's almost like
an alien. He take this fucking thing.

247
00:13:54,821 --> 00:13:55,840
It's super light,

248
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:59,650
but it's really strong fibers wrapped
around each other and stuff until it like,

249
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,840
well, it's just, it's a
stock like any other trial,

250
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:07,670
but it's just a really rare type of
fiber and that's why it's makes amazing

251
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:12,370
clothes and that's why it's
so good to make paper out of.

252
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,310
But you can make a plywood out of it
too. They take that shit and they, uh,

253
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,850
where did they get on with houses
out of it? How do they, uh,

254
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,380
do they get involved with hippies?
What did that match up?

255
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,960
The whole marijuana thing.

256
00:14:22,961 --> 00:14:27,490
Plus hippies want to be close to the
earth and it seems like earthy to be

257
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:31,180
wearing some sort of truth as opposed
to will be as opposed to wearing cotton,

258
00:14:31,181 --> 00:14:34,610
which is also pretty fucking earthy,
right? Yeah. It's a fucking dipping.

259
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,800
It's another plant.

260
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,970
It's like discriminating against certain
plans at the same shit was way more

261
00:14:39,971 --> 00:14:42,520
comfortable when it's way
better for your underwears. Yo,

262
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,890
if you weren't hamp underwear,
I've,

263
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,110
chances are you're going to get some
chafing and going to get some, uh,

264
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,230
some devaluing and you junk if
you ever have a underwear on.

265
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,750
And then it just,
your stuff hangs a little weird.

266
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:56,540
So it's just like rubs up and down
against it and you're like, yeah,

267
00:14:56,541 --> 00:15:00,450
you get that weird. Yeah, the Dick
holds and rang as fuck too, man.

268
00:15:00,451 --> 00:15:02,600
That's stupid Dick Hole.
And it rips.

269
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,190
Do you ever have one that rips
like cold dry humping and the

270
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,680
child giving birth? Do you use
it? I try not to. It hurts.

271
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,270
When PMAL do you reach in and grab your
Dick and pull it through the hole? What?

272
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,590
Yeah. No one does, right?

273
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,700
Or does it pull it through the hole?
Pull what through the hole.

274
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,670
It's in your mouth. No, no, no. So
the hole in your underwear, you know,

275
00:15:28,671 --> 00:15:32,420
there's always that pull through
that whole weird house. Oh,

276
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,670
you meant he thought through the bottom,
like where your leg is,

277
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,690
how you were saying pull some sort
of skin out of your Dick Hole.

278
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,370
This is how confusing you,
you fuck just you talking through ours,

279
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,650
your fair? He couldn't understand my quite
rational question. Yeah, totally normal.

280
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,960
Yeah. I pull out through it called
Sometimes I had to pee and stuff. Really?

281
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,780
And then it goes back at,
Yeah, just to pee at urinals.

282
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,100
I don't want to do under the whole thing.
Wow. Am The unbuttoned the fucking belt.

283
00:15:58,101 --> 00:15:59,210
And what if that hangs down?

284
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,290
Like ring around the Rosie or whatever
it's called from just staining of peeing

285
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:05,810
all night? No one around the whole, yeah.

286
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:08,990
You would think that that wouldn't be
like this is what it off afterwards but

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,833
off.

288
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:13,070
It's either go back through the middle
or let them let it come over and make it

289
00:16:13,071 --> 00:16:15,680
a fishing line.
Not back through the middle.

290
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,170
We're back to the underwear wrapped
in teaching you how to Bait your hook

291
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,820
back through the middle. I don't, I don't,

292
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,600
I don't need that whole, that
whole is not important. I want to,

293
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,020
I pull my fucking underwear
down like a real man.

294
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,610
But then here's the problem though,
and if you pull that down,

295
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,380
the elastic pushes it up against your,
you're on your ball,

296
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,430
tuck it under your belt,
but then when you pee,

297
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,330
I feel like some of it's being pinched
off. And then when you pull it back over,

298
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:50,630
but you know what I do is Kinda
rerelease these two fingers right here.

299
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,470
This one comes down and it pushes
the elastic away from my boss.

300
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:58,220
Isn't that amazing? All my Dick
with one hand and the other hand,

301
00:16:58,221 --> 00:17:01,540
I'm just holding my elastic away from
my boss. It's not that different. Okay.

302
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,440
But wait,
how do you shake hands and make friends?

303
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,660
Then I put the other people well while
I'm in the toilet at the urinals. Yeah.

304
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,610
Well I don't really miss shake hands and
make friends with the urinal, Ari Shit.

305
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,160
That's what I wasn't understanding.

306
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,470
How weird was it when that
congressman or senator,

307
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,960
whoever the fuck he was got busted. I
think about bandwidth, low problems.

308
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:22,420
So if you're using any bandwidth here
at the studio, let me shut this shit up.

309
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,140
That shit off. I'll shut
it all off. Um, the, um,

310
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:28,580
the,
what's his name?

311
00:17:28,581 --> 00:17:31,090
Larry Craig because that was his
name was the congressman and he went,

312
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,440
he went to,
yeah,

313
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,820
a truck stop while he was in
a bathroom at an airport. Oh,

314
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,540
airport bathroom was an airport bathroom
that they had been having problems and

315
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,250
complaints with like these,

316
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:48,460
these really aggressive gay guys had
set up shop and this one bathroom,

317
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,310
this one airport.

318
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,780
And they had like,

319
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,930
they had meetings there and they would
have these little like signals they would

320
00:17:56,971 --> 00:18:00,790
do to let other guys and other stalls.
No, they're ready to fuck. Okay. And,

321
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:05,610
and the word got out, the word got
out. Well this guy, uh, his name is,

322
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,390
uh, he's Larry cubs a photo. Do you
have to, how do you get up there?

323
00:18:09,391 --> 00:18:12,990
This is all post nine 11.
Yeah. Is it the outside toilets

324
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,690
like with a check? Bags are, I don't
know where it is. You know, I don't,

325
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,410
I don't know. Um, it couldn't be
through security then. No Way.

326
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:26,070
They're buy tickets somewhere. They're
just not getting on a plane. Yeah.

327
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,050
Or is it known if you've got to lay over
at lax? It might be one of those things.

328
00:18:29,051 --> 00:18:32,790
So it might be one of those things where
guys go there on purpose just to hook

329
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:34,830
up.
Like they take like fake trips.

330
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:40,440
There's no number dude. Just go in
there and, well, and then people,

331
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,820
so then what happened was cops,
I believe this is how the story works.

332
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:48,390
People are getting complaints. So cops
decided they were going to go undercover.

333
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,380
So they went under cover and this guy,
uh,

334
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:56,130
who would turn out to be a
senator got arrested for doing it,

335
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,070
trying to get his freak on. And he
claimed that, uh, he was trying to,

336
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,550
what is it that somebody tapped his shoe?
No,

337
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:08,280
he was saying he had a wide stance
or something like that. Yeah, I know.

338
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,050
And that's why he's a,

339
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,470
his legs went under the other guy's
stall because that was the sign.

340
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:18,210
You'll put your legs up, you tap the other
guy's foot. And that was a sign. What?

341
00:19:18,211 --> 00:19:21,510
It must have been so fun for them before
someone had to come in and start hating.

342
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,030
Imagine you're a senator,

343
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:27,950
you're talking about how much you hate
gay people and you're talking about gay

344
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,040
people shouldn't be allowed to get
married and then you go to a bathroom and

345
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,930
just some you smell shit.

346
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:37,390
Why some guys suck in your
cock and like Yay Dude,

347
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:40,620
you just go to this fun for
them at Chicago, not midway,

348
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:43,350
not O'Hare and you just go there
and some guy he'll fuck you.

349
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,740
It's probably some sort of form of mental
disease or disorder that someone like

350
00:19:50,011 --> 00:19:53,960
that has, well the gun but a guy
who's like an anti gay, right, right.

351
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,260
That turns out to be secretly
engaging in gay activities.

352
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,800
It's gotta be compensation.
Right.

353
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,190
Just like keeping a public eye public
persona of like going overboard to try to

354
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:08,130
defend against what you are.
Yeah. A lot of it is that,

355
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,370
and you know a lot of it is they're trying
to convince themselves that they can

356
00:20:11,371 --> 00:20:15,810
control this demon urge inside my loins.
We did it.

357
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,610
We did open mics when I
started opening my ex,

358
00:20:17,611 --> 00:20:20,220
but there was this guy who none
of us want it good, but he,

359
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:24,360
he did this like self hating gay routine,
but it was like real.

360
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,000
Was he a self hating Gig?
He was like,

361
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:30,510
do you know what it's like to know I'm
evil to know what I'm wanting is tied to

362
00:20:30,511 --> 00:20:35,250
me is wrong. It was sort of funny, but
it was like, oh my God. The older I get,

363
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:39,920
the more I think that gay people have
it. Right? What gay people seeing me?

364
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:45,000
No, not that that too, but also that
they're hanging out with other guys.

365
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,070
They get to fuck and hang out with

366
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,480
guys. You know, dude,

367
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,730
I walked down Santa Monica Boulevard
one day when it's nice out,

368
00:20:51,731 --> 00:20:54,790
I'll take a walk around my neighborhood
and you just see them on their patio

369
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:57,880
like bars, eating chicken wings and
enjoying themselves and their company.

370
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,810
They're all smiling, they're all
smiling. They're not dealing with women.

371
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,810
There's never that exasperated like what?
What are they even talking about?

372
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:10,810
By the way, cool women in the world. We're
not talking about you. All right. Relax.

373
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,820
Talking about nightmares. I had
a friend today describe me, his,

374
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:20,740
his nightmare scenario. What
was it? I can't talk about
it on the air, but it was,

375
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,800
it was so preposterous. If somebody who
was really happening to like, yeah, yeah,

376
00:21:23,801 --> 00:21:28,480
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just
nonsense fights. And I was like,

377
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,020
whew, you have to break
up with this crazy person.

378
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,480
I was in a urinal last night,

379
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,950
uh,
at the Improv and when I walked in,

380
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:41,180
the one that only a urinal that was open
was right next to the stall and there

381
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:42,710
was a guy sitting on the,
you know,

382
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:44,750
when you could just tell
somebody sitting on the toilet.

383
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,420
And I was thinking about that story about
the guy that like under the foot under

384
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,200
thing. I'm like, I'm just thinking like,

385
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,920
oh I hope he doesn't grab my foot
cause I don't want anything to do with,

386
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,670
I don't know.
I was really stoned and I'm like,

387
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:59,050
oh that's what briefcases are forced. He
could just like set it down, you know,

388
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,920
like a blocker. Keep somebody from
flip tapping you invented. I bet.

389
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,090
I mean, what a terrible place to
meet to fuck where people, Shit.

390
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,800
So the opposite of romance.
It's just public bathroom,

391
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,110
bath at an airport, be an extra
dirty. Is that what it is?

392
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:21,290
Is there something about being an extra
dirty boy or do you like it dirty,

393
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:24,540
like revving the shit out of a stranger?
Some girls like that too. Look like,

394
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,140
oh this is what we're doing right now,

395
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,730
but at least like it's a guy and a
girl are doing like vaginal penis sex.

396
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:37,750
If a guy and a guy and a shithouse like
they might be fucking each other in the

397
00:22:38,841 --> 00:22:40,490
butt.
And that's what I'm wondering.

398
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,060
I'm like how much butt fucking
is going on where people shit.

399
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,180
Oh like that is because then
the problem would be like, wait,

400
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:50,090
am I smelling your ass right now
or are you like someone else's?

401
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:54,110
If you two guys were but
fucking and there was, you know,

402
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:57,740
just shit all over the place and you
smelled the ship getting like pumped into

403
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:01,820
the air as this guy was slamming
in this guys. But I mean look,

404
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:03,260
dudes are sick fucks.
Okay.

405
00:23:03,261 --> 00:23:07,100
There's definitely some dudes who
have fucked some dudes with a shitty,

406
00:23:07,101 --> 00:23:10,400
but there's no doubt about it.
It's not like every gay guy,

407
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,120
this Evergage Nagin the button,
make the shitty smell come out more.

408
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,250
I would in my dream and my dream,

409
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:19,460
you probably start getting the
like it because it's like your,

410
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,040
your lover's smell and
then you let you start.

411
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,570
Joey Diaz used to have a bit above that
about art and in front of gay guys to

412
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,970
turn them off at the gym. He's doing
yoga. You release it to let him know.

413
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:34,070
It's like, Ooh, who's that?
Yeah, show ideas. Yeah.

414
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,140
Yeah.

415
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,700
Would have to smell like that and then
you have to smell other people's shit.

416
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,990
It just seems like a really terrible
place to try to get a hard on. Justin.

417
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,790
Justin,
can you imagine if someone gave you,

418
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,260
like if you had like a a prize,

419
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:54,261
$100 who could go into the bathroom and
do a shitty bathroom and master bay to

420
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,990
climax first?

421
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:59,960
I think it's the same species that
hangout at like men's locker rooms,

422
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,011
athletic clubs,

423
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:04,750
and they just kind of hang out there and
talk and like say should have that wish

424
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,090
somebody at some point concept.
Am I going to find someone shitting?

425
00:24:08,091 --> 00:24:10,010
Go on either side of
them and then just ready,

426
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,430
go and then just go in there
and try to jerk off. God.

427
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:16,820
Could you imagine if he did it publicly?
Liked her?

428
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:21,530
I think he got to go on a stall because
if you do it like in front of people,

429
00:24:21,531 --> 00:24:24,620
like in the bed, like if you're
in the bathroom, like the urinals,

430
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,950
like if you like having, absolutely
no, that'd be, that'd be weird to them.

431
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,370
Fucked up man. If I do just
start beating off in a urinal.

432
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:34,490
I did that once in a church.
Watts was delivering flowers.

433
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,270
You went to a church to deliver flowers
beat off in the year and I need to go to

434
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:41,840
the bathroom and I was like, this seems
like the perfect wrong place to do this.

435
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:45,740
Wow. That's hilarious. How old are you?

436
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,500
16 okay, so this was before
you got super religious? No,

437
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:55,480
I was religious center before I
went back to go to Israel. Here's,

438
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,520
were you in Israel? That was right
after I got back from Israel.

439
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,100
That was right after he got
back. I got back from Israel. Oh,

440
00:25:01,101 --> 00:25:05,480
so when you got back you probably will
like over it. I didn't start. No, not yet.

441
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,210
I was still took me like a couple months
to talk to start really realizing those

442
00:25:08,211 --> 00:25:09,690
thoughts were coming up.
Oh.

443
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,800
But obviously wanted to
left the fucking repertoire.

444
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:18,740
That's data is religious like God,
I never worked its way out.

445
00:25:18,741 --> 00:25:21,410
Was it a Christian Church? Uh, yeah.

446
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,570
Was there a little hate fucking
going on that year at all?

447
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,320
Is there a little of that?
Like a little,

448
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:27,100
a little better with the Jews are better.
Jews were not.

449
00:25:27,101 --> 00:25:30,380
Come on your Christian
Church churches urinal.

450
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,120
There's on university drive. My crazy
shit is better than your crazy shit.

451
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,620
I used to try to jerk off whenever the
planes, they don't say this anymore,

452
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,630
but they used to say that, uh,
we're now going over Arkansas.

453
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,650
If you look out your window,
they ever do that anymore. Yeah.

454
00:25:45,651 --> 00:25:48,710
Sometimes they do that still.
If it would get really chatty pilot,

455
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,320
I would get up and I would
go. I was like, oh, Arkansas.

456
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,870
I go run to the bathroom and tried
to cross Arkansas off my list.

457
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,510
That's hilarious.
As you're in the sky,

458
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:01,270
does that count of saying like you had
sex in Arkansas short the list or is it a

459
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:04,920
masturbation list? It was just like I
where I dropped off. That's probably free.

460
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,800
People think you have to be on the ground,
man.

461
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,110
I have to be real and I was never
going to get to these places.

462
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,180
International Air. Yeah. Yeah. Account.

463
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,280
You wouldn't get to Arkansas. I bet you
have a good fucking time in Arkansas.

464
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:20,240
Clinton was the Goddamn Gun,
man. I Bet Clinton just,

465
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:24,590
I have a feeling that he probably had
some good influence on little rock.

466
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,440
I bet if she went there, it's probably
a little rock schools anywhere.

467
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:30,620
This is a college pretty nice. Cool. Yeah.

468
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,100
I mean if a guy like
Clinton became the governor,

469
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,310
well he's such a bad motherfucker though.
He's such a good talker.

470
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:40,700
There are still girls that would fuck him.
Like a lot of them.

471
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,250
I hope they still do. Girls that
weren't when he was a president.

472
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,910
I hope there's girls today that
give him a little on the sneak tip.

473
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,030
That's what I hope and they just
know how to keep their mouth shut.

474
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:52,840
He's the Goddamn president
and have some respect.

475
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,820
One of the greatest presidents
of all time, let them jerk off.

476
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,280
I remember the lady,

477
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,720
I remember being so relieved
when he got caught. Why?

478
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,020
Because I didn't feel like
I was fucked up. I was like,

479
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,290
I felt like I always felt like all
throughout my life like that I was way too

480
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:20,130
horny. Like what's wrong with me?
Like why do I want sex all the time?

481
00:27:20,131 --> 00:27:23,040
Like you know what, what? And
when I was younger it was like,

482
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:26,430
why can't I stay in a relationship?
I just so fucking bored.

483
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:29,660
I would just want to go [inaudible]
whatever it is. Doing well, yeah,

484
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,150
whatever it was. But I'd
always also felt like, man,

485
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,240
I'm just like a creepy person.
Like I'm a creepy person.

486
00:27:36,241 --> 00:27:40,140
Like to have these feelings
and then Clinton, God,

487
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,180
God getting his is sacked by a 20
year old and it was all over TV.

488
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,560
And I'll never forget that. Never
forget that feeling. I was like,

489
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:54,240
I'm okay. I'm okay. We're men are crazy.

490
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:59,241
Like so whenever like anything nutty
comes up in the media about any guy doing

491
00:27:59,521 --> 00:28:04,110
some crazy shit. You're like, I know
they're out there. I know they are.

492
00:28:04,111 --> 00:28:05,080
They have to be a,

493
00:28:05,081 --> 00:28:08,590
why wouldn't it be the same percentage
of politicians when all these reverence

494
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:12,570
guys, things come out and they
see the John Travolta, you know,

495
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,190
tries to fuck on one. He
gives me massages. Of course
he does. What do you mean?

496
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:21,270
Did you hear about the lawsuit? One of
the guys is suing John Travolta now,

497
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:24,440
so like I never promised that it
wasn't going to tell anybody. Oh,

498
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,180
he's suing John Travolta.
John Travolta.

499
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,230
Because I guess for slander or something,
I don't even know.

500
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,940
Like the John Travolta
said he didn't do it.

501
00:28:32,941 --> 00:28:36,630
And I think what it was so many questions,
John Travolta guns,

502
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,100
like sick as lawyers on people.

503
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:42,930
I'm probably offered them some good deals
to shut the fuck up some money, man,

504
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:47,020
you know, and so then they dropped
the cases or the cases where,

505
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:49,960
or maybe he paid them off ahead of time.
Just so head on Tony Buddy.

506
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,000
Legally binding. I'll just tell, tell
people you tried to touch my job.

507
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,530
That would be devastating if they did
that. I think he's, he's definitely a gay,

508
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:03,170
right? Gay. Why is that
offensive? I don't know.

509
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:07,170
Someone who's PC would totally call you
on that. You know it's also bad. A black,

510
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,260
oh, that's way worse. Way Worse than
blacks. Even at this ain't a game.

511
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,430
A black. You're a black. Wow.

512
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,270
Travolta facing new lawsuit over
gay sex scandals. Slam for Rehab.

513
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,100
Rehab Desk. Does he murdering people
but not really? Loves it. Very good.

514
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,000
Rehab Desk. How is that possible?
I don't know. Let's see.

515
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,310
What can not to do as a coach.

516
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,200
How killings connected to like
something where someone got murdered?

517
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,260
Is that what it's saying? This is the
former pilot. I remember that guy.

518
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:39,510
That picture of him kissing
a pilot a long time ago.

519
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,980
It's just the former pilot
claims he carried on a six

520
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,980
year relationship with John Travolta
is towing all 62 year old dog.

521
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Go God Berta whoa claims
that he met Travolta Volta
in February of 1981 when the

522
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:56,600
actor interviewed him for a pilot job
and it didn't seem became lovers. John.

523
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,210
Well, hold on, hold on
right there. Hold on.

524
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,470
It says John Travolta often like
to eat the man's asshole. Oh,

525
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,650
Fox says silly man.
It's assholes too much.

526
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,660
You'd have to say the clinical term,
but wait.

527
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:15,220
Alleged lover reveals secrets of six year
relationship. Oh, he's not suing him.

528
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,370
Hey everybody.
I'm Stephanie Bower,

529
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,470
Holly's school pilot who claims he carried
on a six year relationship with John

530
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,470
Travolta is telling all 62 year old.

531
00:30:26,471 --> 00:30:31,471
Doug got her ball claim in February of
1981 when the actor interviewed him for a

532
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:34,420
job and they soon became lovers.

533
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,920
The man makes the wild claims in a story
to the national enquirer from their

534
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:39,610
first date.

535
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,570
Got Her boss says they became a couple
and travel to whisk him away whenever he

536
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:48,370
wanted. The last time he saw
her was in 1992 by that time,

537
00:30:48,371 --> 00:30:50,800
the Hollywood actor had
married Kelly Preston,

538
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,590
but he says to roll to told him he's
still preferred men to both his team and

539
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,300
the scandals surrounding him lately.

540
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,250
And this man's story seems pretty
sensational for more entertainment news

541
00:31:03,251 --> 00:31:06,750
checkout, Holly Scoop. Wait, why
does that even seem sensational? Oh,

542
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,050
because that's what they told him to say.
Yeah,

543
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,570
but because before he met his wife,
he had a relationship with another person.

544
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,380
Yeah, that's what they told her to say.
So she said it. Yeah, that's, that's fine.

545
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,880
That's not professional at all.
That's not news.

546
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,970
Just cause he won't say
he likes to do dude.

547
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,560
Sometimes he just doesn't want to
say because it's bad for his career.

548
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:30,000
Hit the latest updates as John Travolta.
This attorney cause this lawsuit. Right.

549
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,590
Dickie less. Wait, why is there a loss?
Why is it guys suing him? What lawsuit?

550
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:37,880
That's just the book.
He's just saying he had oh relationship.

551
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,700
You can't sue him for that.
I think that was just the wrong link.

552
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,670
If you worked for John
Travolta for like six years,

553
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:48,410
would you troll and just say that he
fucked to fuck me [inaudible] software?

554
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:50,720
He probably would fuck you though.
It depends what kind of situation I'm at.

555
00:31:50,721 --> 00:31:54,100
Probably would try to fuck you.
At least John John hear it.

556
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:56,580
They don't like you repulsive.
John Travolta is, uh,

557
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,140
is being accused of not
asking someone to keep quiet.

558
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:03,470
The savages star has been sued by a pilot
and gave an interview to the national

559
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:07,310
choir in August. Uh, he claimed he had a
romantic relationship, blah, blah, blah.

560
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,170
Doug says he filed the suit for
relief and response to what he says is

561
00:32:12,171 --> 00:32:15,860
threatening letter from your voltage
attorney reminding him that he signed a

562
00:32:15,861 --> 00:32:19,610
confidante confidentiality agreement
upon leaving triple his employee.

563
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,030
Meanwhile got the dirt [inaudible] him
to see he signed a termination agreement

564
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:27,750
but never agreed to keep quiet.
So whatever.

565
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:31,040
I mean, even if he did sign it, he
probably would want to release it anyway.

566
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,930
If he's trying to fuck
with Travolta Travolta,

567
00:32:32,931 --> 00:32:34,400
cut it off when he started getting old.

568
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,720
That's fly together that
don't do the obvious gables.

569
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,040
Hey,
do you

570
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,730
know like if you were to have gay affairs
in the sky is the best way to make

571
00:32:43,731 --> 00:32:44,650
sure no one knows?
Yeah,

572
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,820
maybe that's why I tried a pilot.

573
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,460
Maybe that's why it's your role to me,
Kayla,

574
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,850
and then it was too embarrassed about
it because like, no, I'm not gay.

575
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:58,590
They can just shove them
out the fucking window.

576
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,720
No foul feed it. Could you imagine
if that's what he was doing?

577
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:10,560
She just have a gay discos and space.
Just the inside of his thing.

578
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:15,480
It was all like one of those Dexter cut
houses have an all in one stick all over

579
00:33:15,481 --> 00:33:16,314
the walls.

580
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,200
Could have an all in one button autopilot
and disco ball or just come down.

581
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:26,160
It comes down like instead of oxygen
masks just go, ball comes down,

582
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,510
fleets starts spinning and John Travolta
comes out to stay alive and as long as

583
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,500
it were
pointing at his boner,

584
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,400
he was a bad ass dancer.
That should have been,

585
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,450
that should have been thing number one.
It was amazing. And look who's talking to.

586
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:51,230
Nah, I'm really, it wasn't
that impressive. Performance
friction was great.

587
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,580
That's when he came back.

588
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,840
Isn't it amazing that one movie just
all of a sudden you're a bad ass again?

589
00:33:56,841 --> 00:33:59,000
Cool enough movie?
Yeah. It's all it takes.

590
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:02,570
For some people you don't need a lot
of creditors or some people just one.

591
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:03,681
That's a weird thing.

592
00:34:03,681 --> 00:34:08,270
When the stars just sort of fall off
and they can't do movies anymore because

593
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:11,960
their name or their brand has
been, that's got to suck, man.

594
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:15,730
Dan has gotta be a tough
fucking slung to handle. I mean,

595
00:34:15,731 --> 00:34:19,860
it's not the worst thing in the world.
Don't get me wrong. [inaudible] Joe,

596
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,660
fuck what's going on in Syria?
He's poor attitudes, man.

597
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:25,340
They don't really work as much anymore.

598
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,440
You see that 30 for 30 and
the Brook football players,

599
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,240
not what was broke athletes,

600
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:33,490
how most football players are broke two
years after that of the league. Yeah.

601
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:38,180
I think there's domestic
was percent of NFL players.

602
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:42,470
Within two years we're bankrupt
and 60% of NBA players,

603
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:46,910
60% they need to do a better job of
actually hand those people, but whatever.

604
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:51,110
Well, there's also, there's the culture
of trying to keep up with the Joneses,

605
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:56,111
which is extremely strong with successful
athletes and successful entertainers.

606
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:00,620
Lamar Odom on the credential and
show fucking mansions. Yeah. Well,

607
00:35:00,621 --> 00:35:02,960
when you see people with a fucking
Bentley, you want to, you know,

608
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:06,500
you want to let everybody know
you arrived. Just the loopers.

609
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,760
We're just trying to get a job.

610
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:10,040
It's like you're making 400 grand
a year that that's really good,

611
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:13,890
but that's just heavy doctor money. This
is jus talk right here. This is like,

612
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,480
you know, this is how pro pro
athletes don't think like that.

613
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:22,640
That's how they became pro athletes.
They're wild, crazy. Motherfuckers don't,

614
00:35:22,641 --> 00:35:24,500
how can you make it rain
and it's strip club.

615
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:26,570
That's just such a waste
because you can only,

616
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,360
because at that moment
you can and when they can,

617
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:33,140
they feel like they're the fucking
man and it's a rush. It's a rush.

618
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,480
It's just sitting with fake money.
Ari.

619
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,100
Oh yeah. I forgot like playing
monopoly money in the middle there

620
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,530
like right here.
And it's like this all fall and weird.

621
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:44,550
You know what else is weird? The
diamonds that wearing all those diamonds.

622
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:48,920
That's kind of crazy too.
I remember some Kuleana or something like,

623
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,440
or old dirty bastard. One of those
guys once said he wants to have a,

624
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,940
or maybe snoop dog,
whatever.

625
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:56,910
You know my point is he said he wants
to have a phone made entirely out of

626
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,850
diamonds and just the insides would be,

627
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,460
the problem is those things are,
you know,

628
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,090
they fucking phone is only good for six,

629
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:09,680
seven months and then you're going to
want the newest shit and yours is going to

630
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,920
be out of diamonds completely out of date.
Like those virtue phones.

631
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:17,190
Have you ever seen those? What are
those? Um, who makes that? Brian,

632
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:20,370
do you know who makes the virtue phone?
I think the guts of it are

633
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,790
that a new voice? What was that? Oh,

634
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:29,190
there is rip torn son.
Yeah.

635
00:36:29,191 --> 00:36:33,840
It's called a [inaudible]
and they're stupid expensive
man. Things are, you know,

636
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,900
it'd be out of date and like here's
one and $9,000 for a cell phone.

637
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,140
Yes. Yes. It's ridiculous. And by the way,

638
00:36:43,141 --> 00:36:47,520
it's got a little shitty
ass stupid screen. It's got,
but, and why is it 9,000?

639
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,000
Because it's made out of like really
expensive shit. What's the name of it?

640
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,630
It's called a [inaudible] v. E. R. T. U.

641
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:59,140
It's like one of the dumbest
luxury items in quotes that,

642
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,560
that people choose to indulge in.

643
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:06,840
But it comes with like executive services
too. Like there's a virtue concierge,

644
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:10,530
so like you call and they get you a
reservations in restaurants and shit like

645
00:37:10,531 --> 00:37:13,140
that. Just sit right here. So I
guess it's like, yeah, that's it.

646
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,750
So I guess there's like probably some,
uh,

647
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,610
some benefit in that
integrated with those voices.

648
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:25,540
Son of a stuck in that voice.
Hey, where's the ball? Yeah,

649
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,000
signature zirconium.
They make them with like good,

650
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:33,450
bad gay boy fucking bad
version of a bad gay boy.

651
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,070
And you know what I'm doing anymore?

652
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,430
This episode is brought to you
by the Skywalker. Oh, Shit. Got,

653
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,850
we've got way too high before the
show folks. I'm really sorry. We're,

654
00:37:42,851 --> 00:37:47,120
we're looking up luxury phones
now. Despite all though. No,

655
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,070
no, no, no, no. Like luxury.

656
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,610
I don't own any diamonds.

657
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:01,280
Try to hear what that the diamond things
is really weird thing when he's had

658
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:03,870
those crazy chains that they were
on the neck. What do you mean?

659
00:38:03,871 --> 00:38:04,650
It's like the diamonds.

660
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,740
Hundreds of thousands of dollars on
their neck that's just showing it's

661
00:38:07,741 --> 00:38:11,670
peacocking just showing off your others
showing that you can do that. Well,

662
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,590
if you could walk around
with a house on your neck,

663
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:18,870
that dude is letting you know he's a bad
motherfucker. But a lot of those guys,

664
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:23,280
that's why they wind up going like
off the deep end really quickly.

665
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,800
It's real similar to
this. Um, um, perennial.

666
00:38:25,801 --> 00:38:28,950
A potluck comedian of my
community named house head,

667
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,170
whereas a doll's house around his head.

668
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,870
How's head? Yeah. Well he's like
carrot top. Okay. They got that.

669
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:41,640
I was thinking of going red. I could have
been carried top. What else? What else?

670
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:46,380
What else? What else? How sad this
is it. I got it. I fucking got it.

671
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,390
He's like a semi homeless. Oh
God. Where's the doll house?

672
00:38:50,391 --> 00:38:54,320
And I said I'm going to be
a pertinent face apartment.

673
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,390
That's the one up them. Eventually someone
had to say those words. Apartment face.

674
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,890
You can probably, they've been said before
but not probably the his house face.

675
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,040
We're just draws like look like Steve's
these two going to look like apartments

676
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,590
down inside.
People going around your chest hair.

677
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:21,600
You were the one who said that a
apartments in downtown La seems too scary.

678
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,540
Well yeah, I mean little
shits box. It's really sweet.

679
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:28,230
Like there's really amazing like Batman
style restaurants and you walk in and

680
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:32,430
everyone's like, really? Class
seem cool. Wow this is really cool.

681
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:36,630
But then you walk like the wrong way to
your car and it's like you're dead man.

682
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:38,280
You're like, there's
like just, it's scary.

683
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:42,270
Like fucking like so many homeless people
and sketchy people and people aren't

684
00:39:42,271 --> 00:39:42,740
drug.

685
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,590
I've never had anything happen
or heard anything happened,

686
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:49,010
but I get nervous every time I'm there.
Yeah. People screaming at you like, Hey,

687
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,693
you're like,

688
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,960
especially when you're like,
I was walking, I think I
told you this on podcast.

689
00:39:55,961 --> 00:40:00,170
So once when I was walking like Veronica
Richie and imagine walking with her

690
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:05,060
through this maze of probably maybe
30 or 40 people in one block, all just

691
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,940
you're like, wow, it's kind
of like a walking dead.

692
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,030
You have to shovel a bunch of change
down the street and run when they all go

693
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:15,400
for it. Yeah. People don't
realize we're not exaggerating.

694
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,530
It's really sounds like
you're exaggerating but

695
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,430
there's spots this it sounds like

696
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:27,960
total horse was like
the are bigger than up.

697
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,260
I'm telling you there are
spots of downtown la like
nowhere else in the world.

698
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,530
They literally are like a Zombie movie,

699
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:40,330
but daytime that places alive and fun.
They have, they have homeless villages,

700
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,940
like the entire street is nothing but
cardboard box shelters and homeless.

701
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,060
The homeless community,

702
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:50,350
like they've jelled together in a
homeless community like no place else in

703
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,840
America. There's no place
else in America like skid row,

704
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,040
you know,
street cleaning day.

705
00:40:54,041 --> 00:40:56,890
It's actually just a bath or
a shower for homeless people.

706
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,250
That's the lay down and that's
going to be taking off my clothes,

707
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,140
treats,
sweeping day shiny on one side.

708
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,130
Or if you get it wrong,
not

709
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,760
cleaning dates, just sweeping thing. And
you just get fucked up on that brush.

710
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,280
There's so many of them. It's hard to
wrap your head around when you see it all.

711
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,400
Did you ever see them, Kevin? You can't
think about it. I'll think about it.

712
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:31,390
It's too overwhelmingly horrible.
What's homeboy's name? I'm sorry. Mac.

713
00:41:31,391 --> 00:41:34,400
Lindsey [inaudible] you,
did you ever see the Mac Lindsey

714
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,660
footage where Mack went
undercover in skid row? No.

715
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,290
Oh my God. Really? He
did it for Kevin boots.

716
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,190
Movie American drug war. He
went undercover, I believe.

717
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:50,750
I believe it was for that document as a
fucking homeless person. Masterpass pass.

718
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:54,860
Well, I was a little dirtier,
I think. Uh, yeah, he, uh,

719
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:59,450
I mean he's fucking fearless for doing
that man because he was out with those

720
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,040
people. Always hug. Boom. Shaka Laka
we trade shirts with them sometimes.

721
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:08,240
He's a good dude, man. Good Dude. He's
got some love for people, but his, uh,

722
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,300
that,
that adventure was really weird to watch.

723
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:15,860
Like that he had night vision on his
camera and he's like lying in this like

724
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,570
sort of sleeping bag type thing.

725
00:42:17,870 --> 00:42:22,290
Watching all these people and filming
though and the street, it's fucking crazy.

726
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,130
I might be wrong about the sleeping
bag type thing. He was like sleeping.

727
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:27,950
It was amongst, covered up
somehow he was like, you know,

728
00:42:27,951 --> 00:42:31,580
wrapped up and he was laying amongst them.
He was like living amongst them.

729
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,223
Like Jane Goodall.

730
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:37,400
Not quite like gorillas in the mist
that did more dangerous than the chimps.

731
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,940
Oh yeah. Literally push people on fucking
subway trains. Yeah. Just see that shit.

732
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,930
That's the scariest thing about
those, those things. Whatever.

733
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:47,310
Brazil is the same thing. It's just
sort of foreign environment. Yeah.

734
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,760
Just feel like someone could
shove me into the highway. Yeah.

735
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:52,670
Or someone could shut me out of the
tracks of crazy things have happened.

736
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,280
They don't happen that
often. They happen. Yeah.

737
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:58,380
Like this guy that did this in New York.
I mean, how often is this happening?

738
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,040
There's nothing to lose once every
few years or something like that.

739
00:43:01,041 --> 00:43:03,980
Some nut ball goes crazy and if you
think about how many people are passing

740
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,370
through the subway system in New York
every day, the numbers are really,

741
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:10,370
really tiny. It's really
relatively, it's very safe.

742
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:14,110
But for that one guy wasn't fish. Yeah, I,

743
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:18,140
that picture was horrific. Horrific.
It's a terrible way to die, man.

744
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:20,720
So what happened? They catch the
homeless guy. Did they lock him up?

745
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,720
But he said somebody sent him,

746
00:43:22,721 --> 00:43:25,180
he said they passed him at the home
as he was leaving the platform.

747
00:43:25,181 --> 00:43:27,800
It's everyone's running towards the guy
and tried to help him and he said the

748
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:31,920
homeless guy, which was muttering like
God damn mother Fucker, Whoa. Like,

749
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,730
like norm wars for just like that third,
their schizophrenia.

750
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,310
They're just crazy out there.
Yeah, there's a lot of that man.

751
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,000
There's a lot of that.
Are we reclaiming homeless people?

752
00:43:41,001 --> 00:43:44,750
Are we getting them back? Nope. Normal or
do they just die out occasionally. Yeah.

753
00:43:44,751 --> 00:43:48,680
There's some stories about dudes who were
homeless who a figure figure their way

754
00:43:48,681 --> 00:43:52,790
back to a good job, or somebody hooks
him up, he should go to apartment face.

755
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:56,680
It's just hell.
They just checking out at apartment this.

756
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,980
Yeah. There's some people bounce
back from that, but man, it's hard.

757
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,170
It just can't operate with society.
They're just like,

758
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:05,870
they're going to go with the opposite
way. Some of them is that, some of them,

759
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:10,240
a lot of them is drugs. Oh yeah. Burned
them out. Well, they just get hooked to,

760
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:10,730
yeah,

761
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:13,610
and the the throw all their money and
they get crazy and they don't know what to

762
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,110
do.
They have no control anymore.

763
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:20,480
That's a lot of people that are in dire
straights. Yeah, big amount. You know,

764
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,240
I mean there's, there's homeless
people because of the economy.

765
00:44:23,241 --> 00:44:24,740
There's homeless people because of,
you know,

766
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:27,650
financial difficulty and then there's
homeless people that are just out of their

767
00:44:27,651 --> 00:44:29,990
fucking heads and this
homeless people that are just,

768
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:32,160
they just can't stop doing
drugs. There's, there's a whole

769
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:35,330
variety of reasons why
people are homeless, but the,

770
00:44:35,331 --> 00:44:38,130
the type that you see in
skid row or very specific.

771
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,990
What I mean those are the drugs zombies.

772
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:42,780
They're drugs on me cause that's
what the try so wait. So then,

773
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,460
then the drug deals
have to come down there.

774
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:48,270
We watched him smoke crack while we're
filming. Fear factor once. Really? Yeah.

775
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:53,280
It was [inaudible] me and the contestants
were in downtown La and we're in one

776
00:44:53,281 --> 00:44:54,690
of those man carriers.
You know what?

777
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:58,530
Those baskets that they put on
cranes to lift you up slowly.

778
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:01,830
The one that Travolta always uses,
he uses that in a man basket.

779
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,220
You won't let it go.
You're fucked three calls,

780
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:07,230
but you're just waiting for that
one. Good one. I know all the,

781
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:10,890
all those homeless vaginas feel the same.
Anyway,

782
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:14,500
the man basket, we're, we're up
in this thing and we're like,

783
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:17,990
we're like above like the second floor
looking down and watching people smoked

784
00:45:17,991 --> 00:45:20,880
crack realize right there on the
street in the middle of downtown La.

785
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:25,910
That's such a hard drug. Just
smoking. It has like when you get bad,

786
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:28,860
like who's nervous to smoke pot?
I don't think that's happening.

787
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:32,880
Well I guess it's just when you're around
a bunch of other people that do it,

788
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,040
so then it Buckhead was
like the normal shit.

789
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,460
I saw it in Winnipeg when we
were in Winnipeg in 2010 yeah.

790
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:42,340
I walked walking down the river because
it was summertime. Yeah, so beautiful.

791
00:45:42,341 --> 00:45:46,500
When you smell this like candy,
it smells like candy smell sweet.

792
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,470
That's a path for patch and I always say
it smells like candy when you burn it.

793
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:52,590
Whoa. Who said that?
My friend Patrick. Oh,

794
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:57,620
you did an accent has Canadian weirdly
Kaden and he did a lot of coke or alleged.

795
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:02,060
You're just around it and then it couldn't
believe what it smelled like. Yeah.

796
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:03,210
You see it and you're like,
oh my God,

797
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:06,270
that's the a bunch of homeless people
don't crack. It's a crazy thing to try.

798
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:10,100
Well it's like there's no good
reports coming back like this.

799
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,100
You got to have that.
It's real.

800
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:14,370
It works out really well for one
person is trying to convince someone.

801
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:19,110
I'm telling you, man, crack
has got a band name. I know,

802
00:46:19,111 --> 00:46:20,060
but if it was telling you,

803
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,730
I know a part of me would be the desire
if it was around other people were doing

804
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:26,760
it and go like, yeah, a lot of
successful motherfuckers on crack.

805
00:46:26,761 --> 00:46:30,750
They just keep it a secret.
I'm telling you crack is whack guys.

806
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,030
That's a lot of people say that it
didn't quit Whitney and say that crack is

807
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:37,860
whack. It's one of the things she said
that made me believe she was on crack.

808
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,080
I know, right? It's like saying we'd
wheat speed or wheat as he'd Paula Abdul.

809
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:47,730
She didn't know he needed one of
those words work. Hey, all right.

810
00:46:47,731 --> 00:46:50,010
I found out that your name means lion.
Yeah.

811
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,790
I would have just told you that you could.

812
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:53,700
You should have told me a long time ago.
I didn't know.

813
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:57,930
That's something you should tell me. Which
part? Ari Shaffir. Ari. Ari Means Lion,

814
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,980
powerful and me and Joe
and me and Jodie Leo's.

815
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,630
And I think that's why
we get together. So, aw,

816
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:09,870
you should deep. You're amazing. You
should write birthday cards for chicks.

817
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,370
Chicks with head injuries, teardrop
on each one. Hearing the water color,

818
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,263
the flower

819
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:22,950
crown that folks took
growed Grote and my mom,

820
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,280
my mom just got internet today, like
high speed Internet for the first time,

821
00:47:26,281 --> 00:47:29,890
and it was so real broad band from a,
uh,

822
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,000
I'm really scared now you're talking
to her about the McAfee thing.

823
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:35,380
And then I just stupidly said,
Oh yeah,

824
00:47:35,381 --> 00:47:39,610
we talked to him on the podcast and then
she goes, Oh, you did? I'm like, Oh fuck.

825
00:47:39,611 --> 00:47:44,020
What did I just talk to on the podcast?
You had them called in. Hell yeah, man,

826
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,850
it's good. I saw you had
that. I was like, wait,

827
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:47,680
is that the same guy while he's in hiding?

828
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:51,440
Uh, yeah, that's the same
guy. Wow. Yeah, absolutely.

829
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,400
And it's being shipped back. They're
going to ship them back. They said,

830
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,410
I'm so done with that.
You don't think so?

831
00:47:56,411 --> 00:48:00,160
You think it's the whole
aspect of the whole thing.
It's horrible. It's all right.

832
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:02,520
It's possible.
You always have the fucking fake radars.

833
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:05,230
And I feel like lonely girl,
18 or 51 attention,

834
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,560
like I'll make up a story something.
So it was like some, oh whatever.

835
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:10,800
I don't care anymore.
It's like the,

836
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:13,870
nevermind you and I was to give you
a reference. You guys would be like,

837
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:15,520
what the fuck are you talking about?
The Phantom,

838
00:48:15,521 --> 00:48:17,980
I don't know if you guys remember the
phantom that was supposed to be this video

839
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,270
game system that would,
uh,

840
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,380
you just like plug in to your TV and it
would just have every single computer

841
00:48:23,381 --> 00:48:25,730
video game. I remember
that. What happened?

842
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:29,330
It was just that one of those projects
where they raised a bunch of money and

843
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:31,090
then we took a bunch of money.
Yeah.

844
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:36,060
So it seems like that if I have that same
feeling with this whole thing. Oh yeah.

845
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,250
Plus he loves playing
pranks. Right? That guy,

846
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,470
they said he like really loves pranking.
It's just too much fucking and the,

847
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,720
and the believes again, government
with whatever he's leaving from.

848
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,690
They are on the record saying we don't
even, we're not even arresting him.

849
00:48:46,691 --> 00:48:50,080
We just want to question him. Yeah.
Like where he's not even under arrest.

850
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,870
We're not going to let me go through the
plane. We're not going to wait for him.

851
00:48:52,871 --> 00:48:54,440
We're just going to get
them eventually in question,

852
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:55,593
right?

853
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,150
Yeah. I think they're going to kill
him. Just being on say, I was like,

854
00:49:00,151 --> 00:49:03,090
we won't pay the bribes. What? Why
don't you just then pay the bribes?

855
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,130
I think they'll just think
there's too much attention to it.

856
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,310
I think they put him in jail with somebody
who beats the shit out of him. Oh Man.

857
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,990
But he's also blogging from jail.

858
00:49:09,991 --> 00:49:13,200
So the whole thing just makes me feel
now he's in holding in the other country

859
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:15,800
matter.
How many times do you get to blog or hey,

860
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,250
you're my space and this holding
cell guys. So if anyone had Wifi,

861
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,760
like a universal fucking airport in his
phone and it would be that guy. Right?

862
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:29,850
If it's, if he's telling the truth,
he's incredible. Really scary man. So,

863
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:32,580
but he ran away from America
because of what little lower taxes.

864
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:33,720
That's not running away.
That's fair.

865
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:38,680
That's not like no disgrace. No,
he didn't run away for taxes.

866
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:42,670
Really. I thought it said he ran, he like
got murder. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

867
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,590
He left America for no, no, no murder.

868
00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:46,290
No, he, he, no, not,

869
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:51,350
it wasn't that it was that he was
involved in a business that was a,

870
00:49:51,811 --> 00:49:56,370
they were trying to make a sport,
uh, these low flying aerial crafts.

871
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,980
They're like, it looks like a kite
with a motorcycle attached to it.

872
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:03,780
And these people crashed and died and uh,
he was somehow or another connected,

873
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:07,110
even though he wasn't flying
those vehicles, he was
trying to promote the sport.

874
00:50:07,111 --> 00:50:09,570
So he got sued by a family.

875
00:50:09,571 --> 00:50:13,420
So what he decided to do apparently
was to just get the fuck.

876
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,200
Doesn't that seem kind of weird though,
if you really,

877
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:19,340
because if you were in that situation,
you could probably be just like, hey, no,

878
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,530
you shouldn't be held accountable for the
murder you've helped or didn't do well.

879
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,330
I would like to, I would leave.
You would just leave the contract.

880
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,310
I'm not to kill anybody. May
have been negligent. I'm sorry,

881
00:50:28,311 --> 00:50:32,870
but I'm fucking doing 30 years for this.
If I ever went to to get rid of you.

882
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:34,510
I just like see here.
No,

883
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:37,370
I don't have the money to just fucking
them up and relocate all of a sudden.

884
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:40,700
But if I did I'd be like, let's just
call it. Other countries are cool too.

885
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,360
Yeah. I don't know if it
would've picked believes. Yeah,

886
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:49,750
I think he just figured he'd be able to
like buy a safety net to be able to live

887
00:50:50,030 --> 00:50:52,820
their army.
These people keep them working for you.

888
00:50:52,821 --> 00:50:55,040
Keep a bunch of dogs around
and just live like a pimp.

889
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,730
I think he seems to be more until
they turn their guns around.

890
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,880
He's probably more gangster than we
think he is. Yeah. And now he's after me

891
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:07,930
cause he's after you and he's like, I'm
adding Brian to the list. He was like,

892
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:10,600
I'm gonna catch you.
I'm going to get you.

893
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:13,250
He said something like that in
the interview. It freaked me.

894
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:16,840
You have a Skype in or call in patch
to throw it through a video of them?

895
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,173
No.

896
00:51:19,130 --> 00:51:22,190
While you're looking at him, I'm
looking at you. Oh, on the screen,

897
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,980
they look like you're looking at
Rogen to say like, what can you say?

898
00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:28,160
I don't know that you have that same
look that the guy behind the bar,

899
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:30,170
the Tempe Improv used to have.
When you ask her a beer,

900
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,750
they would look over your shoulder
until it left the manager. Like,

901
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,860
who the fuck are you looking at? Give
me a beer. What are you talking about?

902
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,570
Okay. Yeah. Where'd you go? I just
watched you guys spiral into it.

903
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,120
I tried to figure out what the fuck you
were going with this nonsense and just

904
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:53,040
thought about running out of the room.
Um,

905
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,920
anyway. Homeboys, uh,

906
00:51:57,220 --> 00:52:02,220
in trouble or they might bring them back
to Billy's talking about senator this

907
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,670
going for it. I hope everything
turns out to be perfectly fine,

908
00:52:06,671 --> 00:52:10,930
but there's just too much crazy shit and,
and if you pay attention to it,

909
00:52:10,931 --> 00:52:14,580
it drives you crazy and I don't
feel like they following it anymore.

910
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,310
So that's fair. Well,
the dude is like, I mean,

911
00:52:18,311 --> 00:52:23,230
he's a crazy fucking guy regardless
of whether or not he's guilty.

912
00:52:23,231 --> 00:52:26,340
He's a fascinating dude.
Just by fact that he's made,

913
00:52:26,341 --> 00:52:31,341
is willing to leave society and go down
there to believe and live on the beach.

914
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,110
And this essentially what
he calls a pirate island.

915
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,000
He said it was founded by pirates.
He was explaining it to us like the,

916
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:41,980
they've always been sort of
corrupt down there and he goes,

917
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:45,160
they rely on their tourism. That's where
he was hoping he could make a dent.

918
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,980
Oh Man. Cool. Yeah,

919
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:53,910
I think he was thinking that he would be
able to make such a big stink that they

920
00:52:54,251 --> 00:52:58,970
would realize that he has some power
with the media and you know that he has a

921
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,510
profile image or he was always talking
about moving or Columbia. Right. Um,

922
00:53:04,570 --> 00:53:06,370
he definitely thought to Costa Rica.

923
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:09,580
I think a lot of people who make money
have thought about pulling all their

924
00:53:09,581 --> 00:53:10,920
money out and going somewhere.

925
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,580
I live in like where the dollar is strong
or something where it's a lot longer

926
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,650
dollars strong and the laws are different.

927
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,830
You Fuck 16 year olds
and that kind of shit.

928
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:25,260
I mean this dude is 50 it was 67.
He's got a 20 year old girlfriend.

929
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:29,660
Mcafee. How old is Sean Penn? I
Dunno. He's dating a girlfriend.

930
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:31,560
Florence and the machine.
Who's that?

931
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,180
She's the girl from Florence and
the machine. Florence. What is,

932
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,560
what does Florence and it's a band.
It's like a really popular band.

933
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,830
It's redhead girl from England,
just like 26. She's 26.

934
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:46,890
She's taking Sean Penn. Tom Pen. So what,
I'm just wondering, I think it's amazing.

935
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,790
I think uh, Sean Penn is probably
50. [inaudible] maybe least. Right?

936
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,390
Why do you care how old he
is and how old she is though?

937
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,800
Looking at what's possible. Yeah. Is
that what it is? You look at it? Yes.

938
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,390
I can pull this off. I was
like, wow. Just an admiration.

939
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,840
I had a conversation with a friend of
ours that will remain nameless and he was

940
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,180
talking about it as he's getting older.
He's 50 now and uh,

941
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,050
he was talking about young
girls that the girls,

942
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:14,100
he dates all seem to stay around
the same age. That's a, that's um,

943
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:19,030
what's it called? That's a, what's
that movie with a paddle around? Huh?

944
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:23,250
No, the paddles. They paddle
the new graduates at 18.

945
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:27,030
What movies, Huh? Boy?
17. Oh, I didn't see that.

946
00:54:27,031 --> 00:54:28,650
I don't think there's
a confused the older,

947
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,740
the more they stay the same
age as the Matthew mcconaughey.

948
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,810
Well that is a lot of guys, man, they get
stuck in that one emotional level. No,

949
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,730
I like Hasko girls, something
like that. He was a, a dude

950
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,220
did I used to be friends
with back in the day who uh,

951
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,450
he broke it down like in a really
fucked up way. He's like, ah.

952
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,070
The problem with women that are
older is they know their value.

953
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:52,880
That's the problem. He goes when they're
young and they're like 20, 21 he goes,

954
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:55,570
they don't know like how
valuable being hottest.

955
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:58,250
So you can get like one sort of way
harder than you're supposed to be able to

956
00:54:58,251 --> 00:55:00,920
get. And I was like listening
to him say that. So I was like,

957
00:55:00,921 --> 00:55:04,330
this is a guy that's like for him it's
like the stock market. Like, you know,

958
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,810
he was, he had like figured out some
sort of a crack in the system and like,

959
00:55:08,811 --> 00:55:10,610
so he goes, when I see a
girl, he was just like 25,

960
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:11,900
26 I just don't want to have anything.

961
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:16,360
It's too late. 25, 26 it's too
much. Yeah. You heard the latest,

962
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:19,450
they're saying now that McAfee has
had a heart attack in prison today.

963
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,500
Well he didn't say you had a heart attack.

964
00:55:21,501 --> 00:55:26,501
He said he had heart pains and so they
brought him to the whatever doctor.

965
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:31,350
They have medication. Some dude
with a fucking chicken foot. No.

966
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:37,250
So wait, so roles is it, that's a
different guy than the one that's in,

967
00:55:37,251 --> 00:55:40,490
that's McAfee. Yeah. He's got a 20 year
old girlfriend. He said he did stuff,

968
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,560
suffers a heart attack.
How long ago was that?

969
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,070
Uh,

970
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,950
I got pee. You Go pee. I'll be
right back. Don't worry about it.

971
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:53,250
We're right here and taken
to the hospital. It's a,

972
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,440
it's a fascinating story. The, the, the,

973
00:55:55,500 --> 00:56:00,060
what's really fascinating about it is
that there's this guy who is this really

974
00:56:00,061 --> 00:56:04,920
wealthy man who, uh, has a wild
side to him. He's wild man.

975
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:09,950
Just from the whole idea of his
airplane sport that he was into.

976
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:12,960
That's pretty wild.
But you know,

977
00:56:12,961 --> 00:56:15,750
a lot of the people do risky
shit and take risky chances,

978
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,830
but then his drug forum
posts or the nuttiest

979
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,060
yeah, that's the shit that, man, I
think that kind of stuff throws me off.

980
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,030
Makes me to go,
I didn't want to

981
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:24,551
fall for this.

982
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:27,760
This is going to be a l l cat at the
end or we know it's going to be like,

983
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:32,080
what's that? That shit never going to
let you down. Like at the very end,

984
00:56:32,330 --> 00:56:33,550
he's kind of just be like,
guys,

985
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,550
he's going to give a statement to the
press and he's going to just play that

986
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:38,360
song and then I'll you dick,
you know.

987
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,820
Well,
McAfee said when we had them on that,

988
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:45,000
all of his talk on that blue,
you know,

989
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:49,990
blue light drug post, uh,
was all just trolling. Right?

990
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:53,820
But it's not like,
it's not much of a troll.

991
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,090
Okay.

992
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:59,650
You know, I mean, when you hear what
these, the drug's supposed to do,

993
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:03,540
the drug is supposed to tighten
this part right up here.

994
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:08,290
These things are kind of, they're funky.
They need to be tightened. Um, when you,

995
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:12,370
when you, when you read the
thread and you, you find out like,

996
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:15,700
what is it,
let me get off here.

997
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:17,580
Okay.

998
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,680
Anyway,
what he knew about it,

999
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:22,680
he knew so much about it.

1000
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:28,280
I mean he knew so much about the
different ways to cook it and separate the

1001
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,490
different elements.
And the fact that he had,

1002
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,880
he actually had a lab in his yard and
the saying that he was using it to have

1003
00:57:38,881 --> 00:57:43,500
sex with monkey sex with 17 year old
girlfriend and he actually does have a 17

1004
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,170
year old girlfriend.
I mean the,

1005
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:50,130
the fact that the drug taking would
really be the least shocking aspect of the

1006
00:57:50,131 --> 00:57:53,010
story.
The most shocking aspect of stories.

1007
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:58,040
A 67 year old dude and seven sex with
a 17 year old girl in a pirate island.

1008
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:05,150
I mean, you know, I mean there are drugs
like what? Yeah, of course there's drugs,

1009
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,010
right? What do you mean? Like
drugs got there before he did,

1010
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,530
but that stuff MDPV is legal,

1011
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,970
so it's not even like he was
doing anything illegal in,

1012
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:16,560
in believes it's totally legal there. Oh
yes. What's the problem? Well, nothing,

1013
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:20,220
there's no problem. They,
he, but he doesn't want to
admit that he does it or he,

1014
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,170
you know, or he denies it. Honestly,
I mean, I don't know. I'm completely,

1015
00:58:25,171 --> 00:58:26,970
totally speculating as to
whether or not he did it,

1016
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,370
but the story's way more fun if he did it.

1017
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:32,900
If he's out there cooking passed salts
and then bang and a 17 year old, that is,

1018
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,270
that becomes a way better story. And it
killed, you think it killed his neighbor?

1019
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:40,450
Uh, I have no idea. He says he didn't,
he didn't sound like a murderer to me.

1020
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:42,710
What do I know?
What is the merger?

1021
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:47,770
Especially if he's having
crazy delusional thoughts.

1022
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:51,090
I can see it if he lives like Scarface,

1023
00:58:51,091 --> 00:58:53,460
I could see him getting pissed at his
neighbor was complaining about a dogs.

1024
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:57,930
Yeah, there were, there definitely been
some reports of him doing nutty shit.

1025
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,960
Like one guy said he climbed
into his balcony and what sleep.

1026
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:07,200
He was a woke up, like they woke
him up and he was in his own urine.

1027
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:10,530
He was lying in a puddle and he was
asleep on this guy's balcony and he was

1028
00:59:10,531 --> 00:59:15,330
claiming that he had jumped over from
his balcony and that he was stuck there

1029
00:59:15,331 --> 00:59:18,240
for hours because the,
the federal troops,

1030
00:59:18,241 --> 00:59:21,210
the state true whenever for
the country had arrived.

1031
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,250
The Billy's police and they were waiting
for him and they didn't move and they

1032
00:59:25,251 --> 00:59:28,460
sat out there and he said, I couldn't
move cause I moved. They would kill me.

1033
00:59:28,670 --> 00:59:31,760
It was the craziest thing. It was
so weird. It was really weird.

1034
00:59:31,761 --> 00:59:36,680
It was talking about how they just stayed
there and stared at him for hours and

1035
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:39,600
hours and then you look at like
what the side effects of MDPV are.

1036
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,920
We'll make massive hallucis.

1037
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,320
Oh yeah. It sounds like
justifications. Yeah.

1038
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:47,410
Just sounds like at the end of
the night they just walked away.

1039
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:50,290
They just because the sun came up and
you realize your mind playing tricks on

1040
00:59:50,291 --> 00:59:53,710
you. The last time I did mushrooms,
we had this fucking crackly tree.

1041
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:55,300
It looks so bad ass in front of the moon,

1042
00:59:55,301 --> 00:59:58,450
but then when the sun comes up you're
like, oh, it's just a tree. Yeah.

1043
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,480
Was just having a loose their shit
and I fucking, it could see better.

1044
01:00:01,810 --> 01:00:04,300
Well that stuff apparently
what it sounds like,

1045
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,470
that stuff apparently
it's really bad for that.

1046
01:00:06,471 --> 01:00:10,040
Especially when you're
doing it over the p MDPV.

1047
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,490
Yeah,
and what's the street value of this stuff?

1048
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,770
I don't think it's that
expensive. Really. No.

1049
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:18,940
See all this stuff is pretty
easy to make. You know, that's,

1050
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,730
that's where it becomes a problem once
you know like the, the, the bath salt,

1051
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:26,060
the idea behind it is that it's not a,

1052
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,350
it's not an illegal drug because it's
an illegal drug that's mixed with

1053
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:33,500
something else, which changes
the classification. So
we're not an illegal drug.

1054
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,480
So all you have to do to be,

1055
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,860
they sell it and they just
say that they're selling it
for non human consumption.

1056
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,050
Oh, that's how, that's
how it's bath salts.

1057
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:44,870
It says do not consume
non human consumption,

1058
01:00:44,871 --> 01:00:48,500
but everybody knows they're not
really bath salts. No. Oh No, no.

1059
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:52,370
Everybody knows that it's math and then
you get it and you smoke it or whatever.

1060
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:54,920
I mean you could call whatever,
whatever classification.

1061
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,100
But it apparently out of all these sort
of bass salty drugs that they have been

1062
01:01:00,441 --> 01:01:04,340
selling and experimenting,
one of them for awhile was MDPV.

1063
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:09,020
It became illegal recently, I believe in
America, but it's still legal in beliefs.

1064
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,850
So what he was doing, if he did have a
lab and he was cooking, uh, this stuff up,

1065
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,470
although he denies it,

1066
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:20,471
he went through elaborate posts
explaining every single aspect along with

1067
01:01:21,171 --> 01:01:26,130
photographs of the extraction, the
beginning really the middle, how to,

1068
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:31,040
and the results, not just how to do it,
the results, the images of the results.

1069
01:01:31,041 --> 01:01:32,580
I mean, what do you mean like
taking pictures of the party?

1070
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:34,400
He took pictures of all that. No, no, no.

1071
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:39,220
And take it, not those
results. He took pictures of

1072
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,850
rob. The problem with the, you know him
saying that it was all a troll, was it,

1073
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:47,870
this guy is actually taking photographs
of it while it's all happening.

1074
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:52,670
So maybe he was actually
doing something else with,

1075
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
with either a drug or chemical
or something which is possible.

1076
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:02,120
And he took those photos and
was joking around saying, Hey,

1077
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:07,121
I'm in my fucking paradise cooking bass
salts banging 17 year olds but he is

1078
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:09,290
banging the 17 year old and you know,
see what I'm saying?

1079
01:02:09,291 --> 01:02:10,990
It's like it's going on.
Yeah.

1080
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:16,030
So like the bath salts part is not really
that big of an ingredient to the crazy

1081
01:02:17,481 --> 01:02:20,220
pie.
It's not like a third.

1082
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:24,690
The bath salts only like 10% it
makes it 10% more crazy. You know,

1083
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:29,720
it just the fact that he's this genius
multimillionaire character who invented

1084
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:33,120
McAfee antivirus software,
but like yeah,

1085
01:02:33,121 --> 01:02:37,020
nothing makes him different than like he
can fall prey to fucking awesome drugs.

1086
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,770
Yeah. You know? Well you
always got to wonder about it.

1087
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:42,630
Like why would I not live his life?
I have millions of dollars.

1088
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,720
Imagine how hard it'd be to date a
17 year old. Like, cause you know,

1089
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:49,110
she would flip into that like, oh my
God, she's just a child once in a while,

1090
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:50,190
like every couple of weeks.

1091
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:55,050
How was he didn't date a mega Lamont
maniac and a fucking 67 who just thinks he

1092
01:02:55,051 --> 01:02:57,580
rules the world.
You wouldn't want a day to 20 year old.

1093
01:02:57,581 --> 01:03:00,810
And he definitely wouldn't want to
date a 67 year old crazy rich dude.

1094
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,260
She thinking blush.
Oh,

1095
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:07,500
she's probably a poor girl that
lives on a very poor island.

1096
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:11,310
Maybe we should just be into older dudes.
Was probably a poor girl.

1097
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:16,140
Lived on islands. Get
somebody who's 40. Relax.

1098
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:21,120
I mean, that's one of the big things
with um, uh, the South Pacific,

1099
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:22,150
like,
uh,

1100
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:27,150
a lot of dudes like go down there and
get like young wives because those poor

1101
01:03:27,421 --> 01:03:31,680
girls like a great, they're so happy to
get an American to take care of them.

1102
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:32,670
Like you can fuck I'm,
yeah,

1103
01:03:32,671 --> 01:03:35,550
this is not really all about like finding
something you love and getting married

1104
01:03:35,551 --> 01:03:36,570
on that, right? No,

1105
01:03:36,571 --> 01:03:41,210
I know a dude who's in his sixties and
he met a girl in the Philippines at

1106
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,500
fucked her, knocked her up. Oh.

1107
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:47,530
And then he goes back and sees
his kid every, uh, you know,

1108
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:51,030
a few months or so. He flies back to
the Philippines, hangs out with her,

1109
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:55,490
calls her, his girlfriend. You know
what, when he goes, yeah, he's an,

1110
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:57,300
he's an older dude. I mean, I think he's,

1111
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,060
he's probably at least in his
sixties and he's got to like,

1112
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:04,110
have this weird feeling like he's not
going to be around, you know, in 30,

1113
01:04:04,111 --> 01:04:07,860
40 years. More than most than likely, you
know, who the fuck lives to be a hundred.

1114
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:10,890
So it's, how much is it going to
get to know his child? So, you know,

1115
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:14,010
it's kind of weird because he
had girlfriends in America.

1116
01:04:14,011 --> 01:04:16,020
I had a wife and America and
he had kids here, but the,

1117
01:04:16,021 --> 01:04:21,021
going back there to see his new kid with
his really young Filipino girlfriend,

1118
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:24,730
it's like, it's really kind of
freaky thing for him. You know, like,

1119
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:27,030
it's just new thing in this dude's life.

1120
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:30,660
He just met her and they did it once
while I think he was dating her a little.

1121
01:04:30,661 --> 01:04:35,661
It was there for a couple of weeks I
think for a 60 something year old dude.

1122
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:40,760
When you get a little hot young
chippy that just, you know these,

1123
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,230
I don't care if he barely gets to
like understand what she's saying.

1124
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,880
You know you don't carry,

1125
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:50,120
she's hugging you and kissing you and
you're like really like just the idea of a

1126
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:53,460
20 year old girl or
however old this girl is.

1127
01:04:53,461 --> 01:04:57,330
I don't know how old you can understand
that old man who married Anna Nicole

1128
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:00,660
Smith. Right. I always understand that.
That's why I'm saying that, you know,

1129
01:05:00,661 --> 01:05:03,360
he was just fucking having a party.
He knew what time it is,

1130
01:05:03,361 --> 01:05:06,870
how you should go out. When I did it,
Veronica, I started doing drugs again,

1131
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:10,820
like I hadn't done mushrooms and like
eight years and I had to relive, you know,

1132
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:15,420
her age group of like experimenting with
Mushrooms and Ecstasy. I'm like, oh,

1133
01:05:15,421 --> 01:05:19,710
not this shit again,
I'm pretty much back to where I used to.

1134
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:24,310
That's actually a really funny man.
That's a funny idea. They still enjoy it.

1135
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:28,410
It's fun. Different things. Yeah. Will
they look forward to doing shit like that?

1136
01:05:28,411 --> 01:05:30,040
Like Cara who was on yesterday,

1137
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:35,210
Cara Santa Maria who was the whatsapp
concerts and stuff and like they do

1138
01:05:35,861 --> 01:05:39,100
things. Yeah. This chick who we had
on yesterday, the Huffington Post,

1139
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:43,540
science editor, really great,
great, great gas. She was awesome.

1140
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:45,520
Really interesting,
intelligent person.

1141
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:48,280
But she was talking about her drug
history and it was all like all these

1142
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:52,900
experiments when she was young, like over
and over this when acid went through,

1143
01:05:52,901 --> 01:05:55,210
did the acid and went to my
friend's wedding. We did this,

1144
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:58,750
like all these different things
that she did, you know, on all the,

1145
01:05:58,751 --> 01:05:59,950
all these different drugs.

1146
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:03,700
But it's like that was that period of her
life and she hasn't done anything in a

1147
01:06:03,701 --> 01:06:08,100
long time now. Yeah. Like we were just
kind of grow out of it. What's that?

1148
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,450
A lot of people just kind of grow
out of it. Yeah. And I'll also,

1149
01:06:10,451 --> 01:06:13,510
a lot of people start getting stability
in their lives and the last thing they

1150
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,720
want to do is go off the fucking
rails for the night and, B,

1151
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:21,250
it's one thing when you work
in as a waiter on Monday
morning and a job that you

1152
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:24,220
don't plan on keeping them as long
as still stolen. Fucking Laos. Yeah,

1153
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:26,180
but that's fine if you are,

1154
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:30,940
if you're trying to get
ahead in this crazy world,

1155
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,410
this crazy capitalist world,

1156
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:34,990
you have to be at work on time
and you have to get there.

1157
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,330
You have to get some sleep in
you so that you can perform.

1158
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,300
You can actually have
a a good frame of mind.

1159
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:43,570
So the boss enjoys your company and wants
to keep you around you productive to

1160
01:06:43,571 --> 01:06:44,350
the company.

1161
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:48,700
That's hard to do when you get fucked
up on Payoti and go fuck a dancing naked

1162
01:06:48,701 --> 01:06:49,930
to the desert at night.

1163
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:54,580
The next day you have a fucking black
guy because your face had a law because

1164
01:06:54,581 --> 01:06:58,660
you thought you could fly and the elevator
on the way to work the next day he'd

1165
01:06:58,661 --> 01:07:02,000
be like, what am I doing here guys?
What are we actually doing here? Yeah,

1166
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:04,940
and for her, I mean she's,
like I said, she's the, um,

1167
01:07:05,050 --> 01:07:08,800
the science editor for the
Huffington post is the,

1168
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,560
or the science correspondent,
whatever her official title is.

1169
01:07:11,561 --> 01:07:13,690
It's like a big title.
It's an important position.

1170
01:07:13,691 --> 01:07:17,830
So you can't be out there and getting
fucked up every night coming to work and

1171
01:07:17,831 --> 01:07:19,960
forgetting what you're talking
about in the middle of a sentence.

1172
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:23,020
That vice magazine and thing of that
guy going to the dog show on acid.

1173
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,530
No asked for the first time and going
to the, um, the dog show in New York.

1174
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,290
It was great.
Oh,

1175
01:07:29,291 --> 01:07:32,920
that sounds like hunter s Thompson
came back to life and entered into that

1176
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:36,820
writer's mind. Big frizzy heritage.
Fucking Rad. And he's trying to like,

1177
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,480
and what's your deal? You look like your
dog. That's an, he's talking about his,

1178
01:07:40,481 --> 01:07:43,210
like the air conditioner would come on.
It would feel so good at my face.

1179
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:48,720
My favorite all time to piction of
Vegas is a hunters Thompson's fear and

1180
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:52,730
loathing talks about us being fucked
up in the casino when they were all on

1181
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:57,940
ether and calves. Amazing. All on ether.
Yeah, like he took all kinds of shit.

1182
01:07:57,941 --> 01:07:59,640
It was just taking everything I whatever,

1183
01:07:59,641 --> 01:08:04,190
whatever with filled with
acid and ether and Indian,

1184
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:07,930
they were driving to to Vegas in the
story and it was like right about and

1185
01:08:07,931 --> 01:08:11,680
Barstow, the drugs began to take
hold as a sportswriter starts.

1186
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:16,970
That's how it starts. And this,
this was all for sports illustrated.

1187
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:20,720
So sports illustrated thought they were
going to get some story on covering a

1188
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:22,850
motorcycle race and it's dead.

1189
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,560
Hunter s Thompson release like one of
the most brilliant pieces of American

1190
01:08:27,561 --> 01:08:31,970
literature. Just this crazy
little trouble. I mean it's crazy.

1191
01:08:31,971 --> 01:08:36,560
It's brilliant and it's all about drugs.
It's all about the Chi being fucked up,

1192
01:08:36,561 --> 01:08:40,490
having a good time. And it was the
first time like in, in that era,

1193
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:43,370
a lot of what drug use was,

1194
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:48,020
was like the more annoying shaded.
Yeah. That's so mainstream.

1195
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,730
A lot of people associated drugs with
like drum circles and sitting around

1196
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:55,510
holding hands and hit the shot to deep.
Yeah.

1197
01:08:55,790 --> 01:08:58,880
Lying down on Indian rugs and that music

1198
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:06,270
and Thompson instead at a red
Cadillac and fucked up on acid.

1199
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,410
Just driving around with a cigarette
holder coming out of his mouth.

1200
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:13,010
He cigarette holder. He
just, it was another one.

1201
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:17,550
It was another guy that to me. Let me
know that I'm okay. You're fine. Yeah,

1202
01:09:17,551 --> 01:09:21,250
I'm fine. Yeah, because the, the,

1203
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,280
the nuttiest fucks amongst us all get
derided before they eventually get

1204
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:29,300
accepted. How bad you think you
worked for masturbating? Yeah.

1205
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:31,550
I'll tell her at some point you're like,
I'm a horrible human.

1206
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,610
He just think this is going to be the
last time I'm going to quit. Yeah. Just,

1207
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:38,150
yeah, exactly. I'll just, I'll stop. I
can handle it next time I'm going to quit.

1208
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,030
I don't need this in my life anymore and
they just need someone out there saying

1209
01:09:41,031 --> 01:09:44,930
like when I was younger than
my masturbated. Oh. Oh, okay.

1210
01:09:45,110 --> 01:09:47,840
Nobody even brought it up to me.

1211
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:52,010
It was never even discussed. They got
to, I get to talk to your kids about it.

1212
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:55,340
Fuck yeah, I'm have your
girl do it. Absolutely.

1213
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,970
Let them know it's just normal.
And not only is it normal,

1214
01:09:58,971 --> 01:10:02,770
but you probably should do it because
it will help you make better choices.

1215
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:04,610
It was like, well, I make them
go through that horrible time.

1216
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:08,570
Just want to rely on one other person to
be like your drug dealer when it comes

1217
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:13,530
to sex. Especially when you're a young
kid and your hormones are on full blaze.

1218
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:15,020
You're just too embarrassed
to talk about it.

1219
01:10:15,021 --> 01:10:17,630
And that's why you confuse all the time.

1220
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:20,170
You're making shitty choices cause
you're always horny, you know?

1221
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:22,760
So you're hanging out with girls you
really shouldn't be hanging out with.

1222
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:25,430
You're doing things you really shouldn't
be doing just because you're so

1223
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:30,360
desperate to get this drug. That's sex.
When I was 17 years old, dude, yeah,

1224
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:33,500
when I was 17 years old, I got
hooked on posting. It was a drug.

1225
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,560
There's no question about it.
My parents showed me,

1226
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:38,540
why did you lose your virginity?
Like do they really know?

1227
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,470
What do they grab your deck? Stroke
it and that slot no slope. Brian.

1228
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,920
Don't be eager. When did you
lose your virginity, Brian?

1229
01:10:46,030 --> 01:10:49,970
1515 yeah. Why did you lose
yours? It was around then too.

1230
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:55,030
I don't think it was right before I was
16 who was in like 15 and 16 like right

1231
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:59,690
with who was it with you? But there was
a girl who I've fooled around with it.

1232
01:10:59,691 --> 01:11:00,381
I could have fucked,

1233
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:04,640
but I panicked when I was 13 she was
still the local neighborhoods slut,

1234
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:09,290
the Hoochie Mama. She was
21 and I was 13 wow. Yeah.

1235
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:11,660
And you would've, you could've
done it there. Yeah. Yeah, totally.

1236
01:11:11,661 --> 01:11:14,570
Nerve wracking panic, complete
panic. And by the way, I,

1237
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:17,450
when I was 13 I really didn't
know much about getting hard on,

1238
01:11:17,451 --> 01:11:21,540
so really had no idea what that was all
about. That really was like a completely,

1239
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,140
I me every now and then I got
one like, okay, there it is.

1240
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:28,710
But I hadn't started the
masturbation process. What
that was going to do for you.

1241
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:30,250
The harder, yeah. I
didn't start masturbating,

1242
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:34,860
believe it or not until after I
had sex. Yeah, me too. What? Yeah.

1243
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:37,740
Yeah. Well, I didn't like it at
first because that was just like,

1244
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:40,860
this is a pale comparison to sex.
Yeah, it's a pale comparison.

1245
01:11:40,861 --> 01:11:44,520
But I realized then that I was having
a hard time seeing things clearly.

1246
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,680
I was realizing like, wow, sounds
pants up waiting my whole life.

1247
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:54,681
I've always been a very reluctant to
get stuck in like some situation that I

1248
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:59,270
can't get out of any,

1249
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,060
any kind of situation that I can't get
out of anything that feels like, oh fuck,

1250
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:06,870
I'm not even commitment,
but something that I feel where I'm stuck.

1251
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:11,120
I'm in a needy position, you know,
I don't like the apartment. Listen,

1252
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:13,710
shut the fuck up.
Jesus Christ here.

1253
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,920
So when I first started
getting sex from this girl,

1254
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:19,260
I wasn't panicking cause I
need sex all the time now.

1255
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:21,480
But you need to look at it from her. I
needed to get it all the time, but I,

1256
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:25,020
and then dealing with her was craziness.
She was nuts and you know,

1257
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:26,700
she was also fucking other dudes,
you know,

1258
01:12:26,701 --> 01:12:29,870
like she would like fuck my friends and
shit. Like this girl was crazy. We tried.

1259
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,990
Anyway, you try to make her, um, get
a lot of questions there. Anyway,

1260
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:38,010
my point is once I started
jerking off, I realized, Oh,

1261
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:39,180
I could do this on my own.

1262
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:44,620
Like I don't need to only be
around this crazy girl. You know,

1263
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:48,870
you don't have to intern about
situations. Exactly. Exactly. Wow.

1264
01:12:48,871 --> 01:12:51,750
So you didn't do it before that? No, no,

1265
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:52,890
no.
My problem is I,

1266
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:55,990
I thought you were supposed
to use Vaseline because
of ice cube where somebody

1267
01:12:55,991 --> 01:12:57,700
used to always say like,
no Vaseline and shit.

1268
01:12:57,701 --> 01:12:59,260
So I thought that's
what you use the master.

1269
01:12:59,261 --> 01:13:01,360
But I didn't know there was like
lotions and stuff like that.

1270
01:13:01,470 --> 01:13:05,530
So I remember it was just really like,
this is not, you know, like it was not,

1271
01:13:05,531 --> 01:13:06,300
it did not feel good.

1272
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,660
I, I would, uh,

1273
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:11,460
I would just pull my pants
down around my ankles or my,

1274
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:16,490
my knees and I would just let my cock
rest on the bed and I would just move up

1275
01:13:16,931 --> 01:13:21,310
and down with my ankles to give slight
pressure and feel until it would just

1276
01:13:21,311 --> 01:13:23,350
come into my belly and shoots. Well. Yeah,

1277
01:13:23,351 --> 01:13:27,280
I started off pills before I did my
hand for like a good five years. Well,

1278
01:13:27,281 --> 01:13:31,570
how many people must fuck silk
sheets feel wonderful. It gives kids,

1279
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:36,940
yeah, they do. I had some silk underwear.

1280
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:39,670
I used to rub it against that
silk underwear. A fantastic,

1281
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,500
you beat off of Phil Silk Underwear.

1282
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:45,100
It's almost as good as beaten off
with like Vaseline, homeless people.

1283
01:13:45,670 --> 01:13:50,310
I never got that into lotion.
Homeless people should sell
their bodies more. Okay.

1284
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:53,120
You know, or they should like take care
of like cleaning themselves out and like

1285
01:13:53,121 --> 01:13:54,710
prostitute more like you don't really see.

1286
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:58,030
Yeah, there you go. That's a good
fucking idea. Brian. You went crazy.

1287
01:13:58,031 --> 01:13:58,900
People blowing you.

1288
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:03,640
I saw in Montreal I saw a homeless
lady and a homeless God boyfriend,

1289
01:14:03,641 --> 01:14:08,120
girlfriend. Uh, they were hanging on the
alley behind a club soda. And then, uh,

1290
01:14:08,121 --> 01:14:10,870
I was like, oh, that's nice. At least
found that somebody, you know. Right.

1291
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:14,200
But then the next day I saw that girl
was somebody else. Oh, that dirty bitch.

1292
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:16,960
Yeah. Yeah. She was just, she wasn't
cheating. She was just a prostitute,

1293
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:21,370
homeless person. Do they work
at the six bucks it takes to to,

1294
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,980
to get that wonder what a homeless
guy has to get like two cigarettes,

1295
01:14:24,981 --> 01:14:27,700
much homeless. I don't know what it
would be. I don't know. Price wise.

1296
01:14:27,701 --> 01:14:30,190
I don't know.
We had Victor Conte on the podcast.

1297
01:14:30,191 --> 01:14:34,960
He's are the the storage guy and he
was telling us that there was a certain

1298
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:39,160
security guard and the Gal that he
was at that was turning tricks. Wow.

1299
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,010
She'd make money by banging
the inmates. Really? Yeah.

1300
01:14:42,011 --> 01:14:45,610
It was like minimum security people
that like fucked up business.

1301
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:49,360
They did like creepy shit but
college they weren't dangerous. Yeah.

1302
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:54,050
Greedy bitches. So they probably had
money so she made extra money by, yeah,

1303
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:56,170
I don't have a cash back and get
you a check and I'm good for it.

1304
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,880
Blowing guards that would
make prison way better.

1305
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:03,160
That's an that really
butchy girl did an odd,

1306
01:15:03,161 --> 01:15:07,330
she would always jerk him off in the,
in the maybe a lot of yard time. Okay.

1307
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:11,040
Any activities like with Tommy
Chong described, he described it.

1308
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,010
He was at the same place.

1309
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:17,330
If they gave you a like a lot of like
freedom and you get blowjobs from hot

1310
01:15:17,831 --> 01:15:20,380
guards, that sounds like
it'd be a good place to live.

1311
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:22,690
She says he's John
Travolta was the warden.

1312
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,740
That sounds like a lot of people
would be like, let me just stay here.

1313
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:29,960
She was hot picture context one. Yeah,
she said she was, he said she was hot.

1314
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:31,270
She said she had big tits.

1315
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:34,390
Tits would be sticking out
of her dress and he was hurt.

1316
01:15:34,470 --> 01:15:37,190
He fuck is going on or Brian you
trying a little too hard too.

1317
01:15:38,050 --> 01:15:40,900
I wonder if talking about guy guards and
I think that you're talking about girl

1318
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:45,490
guards. I forgot. And he was uh, he
was saying that this, uh, this chick,

1319
01:15:45,491 --> 01:15:47,920
like he didn't know what the hell is
going on, like what's up with her?

1320
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:50,350
And he goes, Oh yeah, you want some of
that? He was like, what do you mean?

1321
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:53,320
It's like I could, I could arrange
that for, you know, she's a,

1322
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:56,280
she's x amount of dollars
and she comes and dude,

1323
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:00,160
was it a challenge over time out? What
are we talking about? No, look normal.

1324
01:16:00,190 --> 01:16:04,660
Regular hooker prices. Yeah. Yeah. I would
imagine the $500 somewhere around there,

1325
01:16:04,990 --> 01:16:08,620
maybe even a thousand for like you get
the shooting her eyes or she knows these

1326
01:16:08,621 --> 01:16:12,160
are all rich people can't make it worth
the time that I was and you shoot it up

1327
01:16:12,161 --> 01:16:15,880
her nose. Special requests. Yeah.

1328
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:18,170
I wonder if girls have things like that.
I wonder if he

1329
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:27,520
wants to do that because somebody
thing definitely this somebodies thing,

1330
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:30,760
the coming in the eyes thing in
porn is like the shooting loads,

1331
01:16:30,761 --> 01:16:33,370
all of a girls' faces and all
of their eyelashes and shit.

1332
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,540
There's something really nutty
about that man. Something really,

1333
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:41,680
if someone wants to do that for
sure they want to stick the little,

1334
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:46,740
that little penny hole right up to the
nostril and just shoot it right in there.

1335
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,380
Geesh.

1336
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,590
Make it come out the other night and
know that I'm not even saying something

1337
01:16:53,591 --> 01:16:56,080
that's original.
I'm sure someone has done,

1338
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,550
there's probably a whole website dedicated
to it. Cocks, not glocks probably.

1339
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:03,580
I wonder if you go to cox.com let's see.
Let's just go crazy and go to Cox.

1340
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:06,820
Not Cox. Not. That was a,
that was a tagline. You're
getting me for a joke once.

1341
01:17:06,910 --> 01:17:10,150
Yeah. That's a nice name
for your loads. Your

1342
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:14,150
one. Oh, look at this. [inaudible]
is one of those websites.

1343
01:17:14,151 --> 01:17:17,780
It's not really a website. When you
go there, it's like watch adult cams.

1344
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:21,320
Casual sex for gay men because
they know someone's in the Cox.

1345
01:17:21,321 --> 01:17:25,160
Not Exactly Alaskan Fire Dragon.
No, I'm not going to do it.

1346
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,520
I know what that one is. Yes.
I've been to that website.

1347
01:17:28,521 --> 01:17:31,910
You son of a bitch you would already
see with the story of the boy who cried

1348
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:36,250
wolf. Yeah. Ladies at home
or walk over to that junk.

1349
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:40,940
Go to that site. Okay. Don't need to see
that. You don't know what it is he showed.

1350
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:44,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Blame
the new guy. Cocks. Not.

1351
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,070
Maybe it'll start up now.

1352
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:50,200
If there's anybody out there
that wants to start car by Cox,

1353
01:17:50,201 --> 01:17:54,620
not.com and you consultation
and what would be the best Cox,

1354
01:17:54,621 --> 01:17:55,454
not videos.

1355
01:17:55,520 --> 01:18:00,470
I did at one time where a girl let me
tire up and then I all over her face and

1356
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:04,430
stuff. Whoa. It was really hot.
Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. What? What?

1357
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,070
What's up with this freaky bed? She's just
like, we had done it a bunch of times.

1358
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,680
She was like, she was her
idea. What a good carer.

1359
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,200
She had a ball gag. She had the
whole, Oh, she had a ball gag dude.

1360
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:17,690
It was a real used and
shit all busted down.

1361
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,610
She works at a ball gag
was like two years old. It,

1362
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:25,430
it was someone who had been
thrown into a rottweiler,

1363
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:30,830
locked up flowers,
fucking stray hairs all over it.

1364
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,440
Lipstick from a 10 different shades.

1365
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:36,230
Mother take it was dirty as fuck.

1366
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:41,610
She been getting ball gag and horse
fucked for decades already comes along.

1367
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:43,730
He's like, oh, I just
happened to have a baguette.

1368
01:18:44,330 --> 01:18:46,580
It was all brand new from a porn shop.
You got a bucket this,

1369
01:18:46,581 --> 01:18:50,790
what'd you drag this behind?
A fucking truck. They chip it.

1370
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:51,830
Chilling on that thing

1371
01:18:56,260 --> 01:19:00,560
has a ballgame. The edges. What?
A chick pulls out a ball gag.

1372
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:04,130
One of the first things you think,
is this going to be my wife?

1373
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:09,140
This is not gonna make it. This one is
not. She's not going to hit the big time.

1374
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:13,460
This is
unless you're that guy.

1375
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:16,370
I mean that's gotta be fun for a
while. Yeah. And then by the way,

1376
01:19:16,371 --> 01:19:18,830
I'm not your guy either.
You gotta find the right one.

1377
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:22,280
Just someone out there that loves that.
She's like,

1378
01:19:22,281 --> 01:19:27,281
he doesn't have his own ball gag people
that love the whole cuckold idea.

1379
01:19:28,350 --> 01:19:32,310
Kuk Holding is like big in this country.
A lot of people that are into it,

1380
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:34,930
very about it. But behind that, the
man's, why don't you explain it for,

1381
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:38,000
cause there's a lot of people are be like
hearing, it's when you, it's when you,

1382
01:19:38,001 --> 01:19:39,100
well,
there's a type of porn by it.

1383
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,960
But the real thing is when you
watched the woman you're with, um,

1384
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,860
get fucked by someone else, like watching
you say black guy, wife get fuck. Yeah.

1385
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:50,960
And the W in Brian's talking
about is fucking bookmarks. Uh,

1386
01:19:50,990 --> 01:19:53,870
because it's embarrassing. They said a
black eye is worse because it's like,

1387
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:57,560
there's Mandingo like stuff going
in with Eric too. Like my poor wife,

1388
01:19:57,561 --> 01:20:00,650
she's really good and she's taken it to
this guy and she has to watch it. Now.

1389
01:20:00,651 --> 01:20:02,840
There's these porn of it where it's,

1390
01:20:02,841 --> 01:20:07,841
you see a guy watching his wife get
fucked and that's a weird another because

1391
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,900
then you're not in bed.
You don't feel bad yourself.

1392
01:20:09,901 --> 01:20:13,860
You just feel bad on his
behalf. Yeah, we'll get you
off, man. That's a weird thing.

1393
01:20:13,861 --> 01:20:15,460
Like that's what I want.
Yeah.

1394
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:19,020
It would have to be POV to the camera.

1395
01:20:19,021 --> 01:20:21,840
A saying I never loved you.
Oh and less.

1396
01:20:21,870 --> 01:20:26,310
It's all black dudes who are downloading
that type of porn and they love the

1397
01:20:26,311 --> 01:20:30,010
idea of giant Dick and
humiliating this weeks off.

1398
01:20:30,050 --> 01:20:34,260
I know there are some dicks
online I reviewed, uh,

1399
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:39,280
I went back and look over
the Kim Kardashian sex tape
recently with open eyes

1400
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:45,160
and I forgot how big that dude's
Dick is. Holy Shit. Really?

1401
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:50,390
She's two fist in this guy's cock
with plenty of room [inaudible] room.

1402
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:55,440
He has a giant Dick. I
mean this, we're talking,

1403
01:20:55,470 --> 01:20:59,520
this dude has a 12 year olds hands.
I don't think,

1404
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:04,260
even if her hands are tiny,
this guy has a monster of a duck.

1405
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:08,850
Yeah, I mean it's like, I believe that.
I forgot how big it was. I was like, man,

1406
01:21:08,851 --> 01:21:12,720
maybe I just blacked that out because
I was blacked that out. Get it.

1407
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:16,050
No Pun intended,
because I just a,

1408
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:20,310
I was just terrified of
my own inadequacies. Yeah.
When you're watched that,

1409
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,400
because that's where that whole
thing comes from. So yeah. So pop,

1410
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:27,150
it's supposed to get you harder
because this is what the, the, the, um,

1411
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,590
I guess chemical reaction to it is whether
or not the nature of what's going on

1412
01:21:30,591 --> 01:21:35,591
in your brain really is that you have
to compete to have your sperm live on so

1413
01:21:36,451 --> 01:21:39,210
you get extra hard.
So you could fucking pummel that.

1414
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:44,570
And this head of your dick is shaped like
a plunger so you can get his sperm out

1415
01:21:45,141 --> 01:21:49,860
of there while you're fucking her and so
then your sperm will go in more. Yeah.

1416
01:21:49,861 --> 01:21:54,270
That's the whole idea of the mushroom
cap. That's what makes you hard. Yeah,

1417
01:21:54,271 --> 01:21:56,910
that's exactly what it is.
Yeah. This guy, Ray Jay,

1418
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:59,310
he really hasn't worked
much since it's video.

1419
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:04,610
And my theory is because he's been
banging 30 to 40,000 girls day.

1420
01:22:05,910 --> 01:22:08,520
Once they saw his giant
Dick and he probably said,

1421
01:22:08,521 --> 01:22:12,870
why do I even need to keep making music?
He probably is making music. I'm just,

1422
01:22:12,871 --> 01:22:16,740
he was on some a, B, I think he was
on some bt reality show. Please rage.

1423
01:22:16,741 --> 01:22:21,030
I don't slip me comedians and Dick
and stuff. You don't need a job.

1424
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:24,270
Smacked me in the face with your
giant cock. I was just joking,

1425
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:28,680
but you could still get it. It's
on these free porn sites. Do that.

1426
01:22:28,681 --> 01:22:31,620
Would you let them do that for you?
What? Slapping your face for charity? No,

1427
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:35,060
for charity. We're going to fight or
slap me in the face where he'd deck.

1428
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:38,490
We're going to war $1
million for cancer research.

1429
01:22:38,491 --> 01:22:42,060
I want to get you back when you can't
slap me in the $100 million for cancer

1430
01:22:42,061 --> 01:22:44,940
research.
I'm not really buying all that research.

1431
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:48,560
I think a lot of coastal awaken search

1432
01:22:50,370 --> 01:22:54,840
going on. I'm going to, I'm
going to pull this. I can't.

1433
01:22:54,841 --> 01:22:58,950
We can't show this on the
Internet because you stream is,

1434
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:02,910
even though it is dead. Don't censor
us. Yeah, I'm pulling it up right now.

1435
01:23:02,940 --> 01:23:07,600
Even though the stream does not us.
They're awesome, but they still,

1436
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:12,370
they can't. You can't. Someone can be at
work and then accidentally you get this.

1437
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:17,350
Oh, we're gonna know that this was
shaped like a thing can angry man.

1438
01:23:17,351 --> 01:23:21,840
It's so stupid. Why are we living
by dumb people's roles? Well,

1439
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:25,450
because Ray J's dick is safe for work.

1440
01:23:26,230 --> 01:23:29,710
It's classic. Not Safe for work
here. The thing that shit up. Oh

1441
01:23:31,330 --> 01:23:34,330
yeah, you get, did you do that? You son
of a bitch. Look at the size of this.

1442
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,040
Wow. She's really spreading
her mouth apart. Yeah. Do.

1443
01:23:39,041 --> 01:23:42,550
But look at the length on that goddamn
thing. I mean the width is pretty normal.

1444
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,890
Hey Brian can have that on camera. Yeah,
I sideways. It just looked like, no,

1445
01:23:47,891 --> 01:23:51,720
it didn't have been eating a pop shot up.
It didn't want to see it.

1446
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:55,360
Why do you ruin things for
me, Brian? Brian, you can't
have it on Ustream. Dummy.

1447
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,410
That's bad. That's bad for everyone.
That's bad for business anyway.

1448
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,210
That's pretty good.
Don't get all horny.

1449
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:04,330
Now look at you thinking about beating
off. While she was excellent form,

1450
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,010
she was going for it.

1451
01:24:06,070 --> 01:24:10,000
Amazing that that led to the
beginning of a very promising career.

1452
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:13,780
She wasn't prissy about it. Like
Nicole Tilton or Paris Hilton. Yeah.

1453
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:15,370
Paris Hilton wasn't fucking a black guy.

1454
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:18,910
Was fucking some weak white dude who
had to put up with their bullshit.

1455
01:24:18,940 --> 01:24:21,310
Rayjay doesn't put up with
bitches. Bullshit. Oh yeah.

1456
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,950
It's a big giant deck and you got to suck
it and you're going to turn your phone

1457
01:24:23,951 --> 01:24:27,120
off. Okay. No fucking text the phone.

1458
01:24:27,130 --> 01:24:30,280
That's probably the last time she had
sex without texting was when they made

1459
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:34,530
that video. I bet she's just constantly
checking our Twitter, texting.

1460
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,950
I bet you he's the only guy to keep her
in line. It was like, I'm really busy.

1461
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:39,990
Of course I gotta check my texts.

1462
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:44,050
I listened to these two chicks talk about
about her. It was really interesting.

1463
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:49,210
I don't know them. It was at an airport.
They were like, they were, I wasn't,

1464
01:24:49,211 --> 01:24:49,391
you know,

1465
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:52,280
it was like one of those situations
where like you're facing that way and

1466
01:24:52,281 --> 01:24:55,360
there's people from behind you
there sitting those rows of chairs,

1467
01:24:55,361 --> 01:24:58,870
the airport and they're right next to you,
but you're not,

1468
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:01,470
you're not even looking at each other.
How does an inch away from there?

1469
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:04,060
But you're right.
So she was talking about,

1470
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,180
I knew that she was talking about Kim
carnation and right away it's like she's

1471
01:25:07,181 --> 01:25:11,290
always dating these big athletes.
Like it's always,

1472
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:15,310
it's like most often black guys.
And then, and then just said that,

1473
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,110
I mean for real,

1474
01:25:17,111 --> 01:25:22,111
she's never going to date a regular guy
now because they're going to realize

1475
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:26,950
that, you know, she read what she really
likes is those big black athletes,

1476
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:29,050
you know? And the other girl
was like, Oh yeah, oh, I know.

1477
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:32,590
Like were like talking logic to each
other. Like she made a bad move.

1478
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:35,170
Like that's what she was saying.
She was almost saying like,

1479
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:38,080
like she ruined her
opportunities in the future.

1480
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,600
Those girls don't think they can
get those big black athletes.

1481
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:42,670
So I think the idea is,
yeah,

1482
01:25:42,671 --> 01:25:47,410
those girls get a regular guy and for
a lot of crazy bitches, men are like,

1483
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:51,340
it's like playing musical chairs. Like
they look at like what they got to marry.

1484
01:25:51,341 --> 01:25:52,390
You gotta marry well,

1485
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:57,190
you got to find a good one to get some
regular white dude from regular boring

1486
01:25:57,191 --> 01:26:00,860
guy and the fucking, well she might, she
might have to one day. That was what,

1487
01:26:00,861 --> 01:26:02,320
that's what's what these
girls are thinking.

1488
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:04,040
These girls to think
that she might have to,

1489
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:07,520
that she might get some situation which
got to marry some media mogul that

1490
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:09,360
happens to be five foot four,
which at the Mary,

1491
01:26:09,370 --> 01:26:13,790
anyone rotund because rich shit
falls apart now rich anymore.

1492
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,990
The shit hit the fan and now this poor
little tiny guys going to always know

1493
01:26:18,110 --> 01:26:22,730
that she's likes these big giant super
athletes. Fucking the shit out of her.

1494
01:26:22,731 --> 01:26:24,230
Like who is that one dude though?

1495
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:27,500
The one black football player that she
was dating for a while. Very famous guy.

1496
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,560
Reggie Bush. Reggie Bush. Reggie Bush
owns my old Barracuda. Oh really?

1497
01:26:33,561 --> 01:26:37,700
Yes. He bought it. He think he found her
in it. I hope so, but I don't think so.

1498
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:42,340
That would be an honor.
Um, but I mean that's,

1499
01:26:42,370 --> 01:26:44,450
that's a guy like you look at
the way he's built. He like,

1500
01:26:44,451 --> 01:26:47,840
he must fuck her almost a death,
you know?

1501
01:26:47,841 --> 01:26:51,890
And how do you go from that to like
a regular guy? You don't, you can't,

1502
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:52,940
she stuck.

1503
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:56,930
But now she's dating Kanye West and
Kanye has gotten to be thinking about the

1504
01:26:56,931 --> 01:27:00,230
fucking Bush put on that.
He's gotta be,

1505
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,840
but Reggie Bush, Connie, you probably
is this a thing and like that circle,

1506
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:08,990
that famous black circle of like,
they all want to date the same people.

1507
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,040
Everyone's trying to date. Riana I
want, it's their turn. Well there's a,

1508
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:15,940
there's like a benefit to
dating Kim Kardashians.

1509
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:19,430
Like a clear benefit when it comes
to get more famous. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1510
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,530
Well you guys doing over there?
Brian's everything. Okay.

1511
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,880
And Lamar Odom is terrible in
basketball now. Izzy, he's terrible.

1512
01:27:25,881 --> 01:27:30,110
And is it because he's like
a famous Kardashians now?
I mean, you always hear it.

1513
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:32,320
You ever hear those things?
I'm certainly seen UFC too,

1514
01:27:32,340 --> 01:27:35,630
where it's like his head's not in it.
He's got to focus and you're like, no,

1515
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:39,530
there are professional athletes. They
but it's like no there focus gets robbed.

1516
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:43,270
Well it's fun. Especially like
discipline is a real issue for athletes.

1517
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:48,170
So it's very, very hard to
stay disciplined and train
hard and do your, you know,

1518
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:51,320
your, your time in practice
room when you're not,

1519
01:27:51,380 --> 01:27:54,380
your focus has got to be on it during
the extra stuff you do the extra stuff

1520
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:57,080
like strength and conditioning
and the practice when you're not,

1521
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,310
it's not in season.

1522
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:01,840
And when here like jet setting all around
the world banging a car dash and man,

1523
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:05,060
I bet. Yeah, that becomes your
focus and checking your Twitter.

1524
01:28:05,110 --> 01:28:06,410
It definitely steal some focus.

1525
01:28:06,411 --> 01:28:08,690
And when you look at the highest levels
and you're starting to it hitting your

1526
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:13,310
thirties yeah, for sure man, that
fucks no fucks with people's heads.

1527
01:28:13,340 --> 01:28:15,230
And the fame you get from
everybody knowing you,

1528
01:28:15,231 --> 01:28:18,230
you're way more famous than the other
basketball players on your team. Right.

1529
01:28:18,620 --> 01:28:22,140
And you're famous for being a guy
who bangs a cardiac Shan. Yeah.

1530
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:24,230
So you're in this weird group,

1531
01:28:24,410 --> 01:28:27,890
you're the most famous non rapist on
your basketball team. And you, well,

1532
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:32,150
how dare you, and he was acquitted
wasn't here. It wasn't never trade.

1533
01:28:32,151 --> 01:28:35,470
Your spotter off does not
testify. You could do that. Yeah.

1534
01:28:35,740 --> 01:28:40,490
And then she won't testify. There's
no case. The um, the thing is like,

1535
01:28:40,491 --> 01:28:43,460
he must be like looking at Bruce
Jenner and he must be saying that's,

1536
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,790
that's what's happening. That's my
future. I'm going to just center.

1537
01:28:46,870 --> 01:28:50,510
It was a top level athlete. Fuck. Aa was
gold metal winner in the Olympics. Man.

1538
01:28:50,511 --> 01:28:55,350
Hero hero on the cover.
We some goofy ass for it.

1539
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,700
Did it help us defend
the fucking Dakota's?

1540
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:02,070
He fought off the ruskies
understand with a javelin

1541
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,260
and a good jumps more than another guy.
Yeah.

1542
01:29:04,261 --> 01:29:07,440
It's one of those weird sports and
nobody gives a fuck about decathlon or

1543
01:29:07,441 --> 01:29:11,510
something like that. Such a killer fucking
bit about that. Which normal horse.

1544
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:16,020
Oh yeah. You just whip out
only for Olympics. Yeah. Yeah.

1545
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:18,300
We're going to have it for like a single,
it's like seasonal commercials.

1546
01:29:18,301 --> 01:29:19,950
They do those,
I'll blame for like five years,

1547
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:22,560
but only for like two weeks at a time.
I could probably still do that.

1548
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,670
Probably the Olympics or Paralympics.
Especially location and it's so poignant,

1549
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:30,150
stupid ass.
Why are we looking at this?

1550
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,810
You would never watch most of the sports
during the Olympics if they were on TV

1551
01:29:33,811 --> 01:29:34,441
every weekend.

1552
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:38,940
And New Buddy caterers that comes from
a time of when you were like roof the

1553
01:29:38,941 --> 01:29:40,620
white fighter over the black fighter.

1554
01:29:40,670 --> 01:29:44,340
Cause like the drummer will always
beat the black and uh, in a battle,

1555
01:29:45,020 --> 01:29:46,800
doxing is a thinking man's sport.

1556
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,450
Well that was why I was a big deal when
Max Schmeling knocked out Joe Louis,

1557
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:54,270
it was a huge victory for the, not for
the white people. White people too.

1558
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:57,040
And that's why they get so mad at when
Moses or whatever his name is, this,

1559
01:29:57,050 --> 01:30:02,040
the printer, uh, in Munich. What'd he
do? He in front of like the Hitler,

1560
01:30:02,340 --> 01:30:05,070
he likes and won the gold medal and it
took the American flag and like waved it

1561
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:06,850
in front of Hitler. Oh really? Yeah.

1562
01:30:06,851 --> 01:30:09,750
It was like a black guy in Munich
or something like that. You know,

1563
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:12,940
maybe he fucking made Hitler
ticket to the next level. Yeah.

1564
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:15,600
I think that was the limits when all
the Palestinians killed those Israelis.

1565
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,170
Could, you know that was the
Munich Olympics wasn't it? Was it?

1566
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:22,290
But Hitler was before that. Oh yeah.
Yeah. I wouldn't have been Hitler.

1567
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:25,590
Hitler was in the forties. It might've
been during the rise of Hitler. Yeah,

1568
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:30,060
you're right. Yeah. Um, or
they got the back there again.
Yeah. The Munich Olympics,

1569
01:30:30,061 --> 01:30:31,830
when they,
the Palestinians killed those people.

1570
01:30:31,831 --> 01:30:34,610
I believe it was in told Sandra Mondays
he gave hill in the middle finger. No,

1571
01:30:34,611 --> 01:30:37,260
he did not.
Did Not.

1572
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:41,270
Jesse Owens gave Hitler Middle Finger.
I don't remember that.

1573
01:30:41,330 --> 01:30:42,870
That would have been
talked about a weird thing.

1574
01:30:42,871 --> 01:30:45,570
It must be to be a runner and hoping
that everyone was going to protect you

1575
01:30:45,571 --> 01:30:49,180
while you're running by
just a crazy dictator. Yeah.

1576
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:54,380
Just one of the great minds
of dictatorship and military,

1577
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:58,260
like,
like ruthless military campaigns.

1578
01:30:58,680 --> 01:31:00,450
Brendan Burns always says
that he didn't think,

1579
01:31:00,451 --> 01:31:02,490
he didn't think a Hitler
would have been mad about it.

1580
01:31:03,300 --> 01:31:07,900
Can you just would've thought
the Americans were cheating
by using animals. Oh,

1581
01:31:10,080 --> 01:31:13,350
he's an amazing that they were really
trying to devise a master race.

1582
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:16,200
Like that was her, that was something
that people were agreeing on. Like, Yep.

1583
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:21,000
We got to do this right. We
got to do this. Right. Yeah. S

1584
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:25,140
a part of me sort of gets that though.
Well,

1585
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:28,470
there's a lot of utility out of
things over aggression. Sure.

1586
01:31:28,471 --> 01:31:32,190
If he said we don't value as a
society, yeah, I can breathe that out.

1587
01:31:32,191 --> 01:31:36,840
I would like to, yeah. And if you could
really figure out a way to get, well,

1588
01:31:36,850 --> 01:31:38,820
we're going to have to do some work.
It's going to be ugly.

1589
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:43,140
We can get the world to a beautiful
place where there's virtually no cons.

1590
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,020
And now that we have revamped
the entire education system,

1591
01:31:46,021 --> 01:31:49,440
we can ensure that future generations,
we're also not be cons,

1592
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:53,190
but the only way we can do this as we
got to kill all the cuts because the cons

1593
01:31:53,191 --> 01:31:54,024
make more cuts.

1594
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:58,350
So we have to find all the cons and figure
out a way to not make contacts out of

1595
01:31:58,351 --> 01:32:02,050
the bay from the, uh, the sterilization
shots. It's not just that,

1596
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:06,580
because they cannot turn
the kids in the top kids.

1597
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:09,940
They turn those kids into cons. Yeah.
If you're around a family of cons,

1598
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:11,010
it's very hard to not be wanting.

1599
01:32:11,011 --> 01:32:13,600
If your next door neighbor was
fun and a bunch of like assholes,

1600
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,740
probably not going to learn from that.
Yeah. If you live in a horrible yeah.

1601
01:32:16,770 --> 01:32:17,251
Environment.

1602
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:20,430
I mean it's probably very difficult to
be a philanthropist when you were in

1603
01:32:20,431 --> 01:32:25,200
Liberia and you're struggling
for your life, you know,
my sister was told I curse.

1604
01:32:25,201 --> 01:32:30,030
I try not to, but I curse
my normal length. Try not to
try not to around her kids.

1605
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:34,820
Oh right. Or Orthodox children.
How old are they? Like

1606
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:39,690
13 or 14 and the 12 and like whatever.

1607
01:32:39,691 --> 01:32:43,440
But it's like they must be so
excited when uncle are sober. Try.

1608
01:32:43,441 --> 01:32:45,390
But at the same time it's
like, well, it's not that bad.

1609
01:32:45,391 --> 01:32:48,180
It's just a word that I think should
be part of their vocabulary. Do they?

1610
01:32:48,360 --> 01:32:52,140
It's better. It's a better word. Why
would you hide vocabulary from someone?

1611
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:54,990
It's nonsense.
Allow them to know what's right to use.

1612
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:59,460
Yeah. It's a stupid, stupid old thing
that doesn't make any sense. And you know,

1613
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:02,330
the idea, I mean, this is like
Lenny Bruce covered this shit

1614
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:05,210
in the 1960 [inaudible] going on.
It's still the same.

1615
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:10,490
The fact that it's 2012 and we still
have magic words gotta kill off the

1616
01:33:11,091 --> 01:33:14,510
Christians, man. Well, the
craziest thing about the, the,

1617
01:33:14,630 --> 01:33:16,460
the censorship of these
magic words and said,

1618
01:33:16,461 --> 01:33:19,520
now they've made it
incredibly expensive to do.

1619
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:21,560
Like if you go on,

1620
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:25,970
go on TV and you violate those for real,
nobody cares about it.

1621
01:33:25,971 --> 01:33:30,350
Only has power because we say,
[inaudible] who song doesn't curse out?

1622
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:31,490
It doesn't believe how fuck.

1623
01:33:31,590 --> 01:33:34,320
Yeah.
Well that's what a Lenny Bruce,

1624
01:33:34,321 --> 01:33:37,920
his argument was about the word
nigger in like 1960 was saying,

1625
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:41,970
you know what the problem is? You know
that that word can still hurt someone.

1626
01:33:41,971 --> 01:33:44,450
The reason why that word hurts someone
is everyone's afraid of that word.

1627
01:33:44,451 --> 01:33:47,460
You just said it enough.
It would never be able to hurt some,

1628
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:52,110
some young black boy. Yeah. You know, I'm
a young black child. It was a really, uh,

1629
01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:56,100
interesting that this guy figured that
out in the 1960s and an error where you

1630
01:33:56,110 --> 01:34:01,110
realize very few people thinking like
that in Israel. Nobody uses that word now,

1631
01:34:01,140 --> 01:34:04,290
which wasn't the derogatory word. Oh,
that's, and she could just say it.

1632
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:06,570
People were like on
whatever. So, but yeah,

1633
01:34:06,571 --> 01:34:09,360
that someone talked about that when they
get off the plane. Who was that? Brian?

1634
01:34:09,550 --> 01:34:12,780
Someone talked about on the podcast that
they got off the plane and they said it

1635
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:17,340
because you can say it there. We used
to say it in the streets to each other.

1636
01:34:17,370 --> 01:34:19,800
Maybe it was me. I don't
know. It wasn't saying,

1637
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:24,150
if someone was saying that whenever they
land they say it out loud because uh,

1638
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:27,300
in Israel doesn't mean anything.
They get off the plane.

1639
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:30,700
I got it. There might be someone
on the plane still though.

1640
01:34:31,290 --> 01:34:36,190
Even just stopping and American black
guy like check around first. Oh yeah.

1641
01:34:36,191 --> 01:34:37,024
Okay.

1642
01:34:37,790 --> 01:34:41,300
Kardashians.
No black people let it ride.

1643
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:46,970
Let's go. Let's have this. Indeed.
Indeed. How am I going announcement?

1644
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:49,160
Yeah. What's your name?
I'm recording my special

1645
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,120
now. Do that. But no, not that. Not
this right now. It seems kind of rude.

1646
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:57,800
I'm just doing it. I'm typing it
in and it's doing one those men,

1647
01:34:57,801 --> 01:35:01,720
my next blank man. Yeah. Right now,
if you were doing it right now, say,

1648
01:35:01,730 --> 01:35:04,890
I don't think you're giving it your
best effort. It seems like you're,

1649
01:35:04,891 --> 01:35:08,100
you're also having a conversation.
You do both. It's like,

1650
01:35:08,130 --> 01:35:12,050
I think our standup needs work.
It's December 28th at in Brooklyn,

1651
01:35:12,051 --> 01:35:15,920
New York at the knitting factory.
I'm doing two shows.

1652
01:35:16,630 --> 01:35:19,100
The knitting factory tickets
are on sale now and that's a,

1653
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,910
that's a short amount of time since
you've done your last one. It's, it seems,

1654
01:35:23,330 --> 01:35:25,310
well I tried doing it like in uh,

1655
01:35:25,311 --> 01:35:28,370
October of last year and then I
didn't record it again until May,

1656
01:35:28,371 --> 01:35:29,300
but I put this stuff away,

1657
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,120
put the material away when
I thought it was one in May.

1658
01:35:32,121 --> 01:35:34,340
And now you're doing another
one in December. Yeah.

1659
01:35:34,341 --> 01:35:37,130
But the main one was from
October's material. Right.

1660
01:35:37,131 --> 01:35:38,770
But that's still pretty
impressive them writing.

1661
01:35:38,870 --> 01:35:42,680
What made you decide to release
it so quickly? Like I said,

1662
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:43,730
I was going to do it a year.

1663
01:35:43,731 --> 01:35:46,280
From what I tried to start in the first
one and see if I could write an hour and

1664
01:35:46,281 --> 01:35:50,750
a year having a game. Right. You're came
around. I dropped all the old material,

1665
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:53,270
all this stuff on the album was all done.

1666
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:57,910
I only did it again for a month to get a
fresh. Now when you go and do like, um,

1667
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:03,140
if you have like an exploratory set
like okay, this is all new shit,

1668
01:36:03,141 --> 01:36:03,921
I'm going to go up there.

1669
01:36:03,921 --> 01:36:08,110
And do you do that during
regular headlines sets or
do you set aside til I get,

1670
01:36:08,270 --> 01:36:12,440
I get, well I had the luxury of of
the first album didn't come out right.

1671
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:15,710
So I was building material and I could
still do the old material if I needed to

1672
01:36:15,711 --> 01:36:19,370
for a paid gig. It's like I got to do
45 minutes to an hour. Right. I got it.

1673
01:36:19,371 --> 01:36:22,880
I got to reach into the well,
right, right, right. But
for any 15 minute set in la,

1674
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:25,160
it's like I can get there without this.

1675
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:29,030
It took me like a month to bill to do
the first like 12 minutes to when the

1676
01:36:29,031 --> 01:36:31,940
light came on and I was still
doing the material. That's cool.

1677
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:36,060
That's like well over a month,
like two months.

1678
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:37,623
But uh,

1679
01:36:38,540 --> 01:36:39,810
yeah,
I guess it was not there.

1680
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,720
It's kind of cool how
sometimes that happens though.
Like I, I once you started,

1681
01:36:44,721 --> 01:36:48,310
it just kept coming out of me that knew
strip clubs story that I talk about

1682
01:36:48,311 --> 01:36:49,240
going to Dayton,
Ohio,

1683
01:36:49,241 --> 01:36:52,540
which the owner just died the other
day of the living room in Dayton, Ohio.

1684
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:56,650
So I'm sorry if I cursed you. Uh,
but that story and the dolphin,

1685
01:36:56,680 --> 01:36:57,740
this dolphin bit I did,

1686
01:36:57,741 --> 01:37:00,940
it just added like almost 10 minutes
to my act and just one weekend.

1687
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:04,690
Yeah, that can happen, man. You can get
one idea that just really takes off. Yeah.

1688
01:37:04,890 --> 01:37:05,660
That's,

1689
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:10,510
that's my favorite time when they just
get longer and longer and stuff. Yeah.

1690
01:37:10,530 --> 01:37:13,200
You just keep adding your time. My friend
Mike's store, this comedian in Maryland,

1691
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:16,000
he was like, well, you know, I still have
new stuff I want to add to the old jokes.

1692
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:16,570
Right, right, right.

1693
01:37:16,570 --> 01:37:21,370
My theory is that same creative energy
you can just shifted to new jokes. Yeah,

1694
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:23,920
totally. The only reason
you're all writing stuff for
old jokes is cause you're,

1695
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:27,070
that's all you're focusing on.
Yeah. But then there's always like,

1696
01:37:27,670 --> 01:37:30,790
the problem is when you release a
joke and then right after you do it,

1697
01:37:30,791 --> 01:37:34,060
you gotta have a new tech line,
excuse me, new tag dot doing it.

1698
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:37,600
It's like done with it.
So once I get enough,

1699
01:37:37,601 --> 01:37:42,280
like enough to like go on the road with
and it's like, okay, we're fine. And then,

1700
01:37:42,281 --> 01:37:45,430
uh, you just weed out all the other stuff
until you don't have to do it anymore.

1701
01:37:45,460 --> 01:37:47,530
So now you got it to the point
where you're super happy with it,

1702
01:37:47,531 --> 01:37:48,364
you're ready to go.

1703
01:37:48,910 --> 01:37:51,430
I'm at the point where I'm on the road
now I'm deciding there's still bits I

1704
01:37:51,431 --> 01:37:52,810
can't do cause I don't have time for it.

1705
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:55,930
She had a lot of change a lot when you
started getting like long headlines

1706
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:58,540
and that was the first time I've ever
done that. So I consistently did it,

1707
01:37:58,541 --> 01:38:01,920
started doing an hour five times
a week instead of 15 minutes.

1708
01:38:01,921 --> 01:38:06,580
Seven or eight times a week. Yeah.
Yeah. Plus the 15 minutes in town to,

1709
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,230
to fuck around with, you
know, the Tuesday, Wednesday
sets. Those hours sets are,

1710
01:38:10,231 --> 01:38:14,030
wouldn't you really get to stretch out?
Yeah. You got that all the time. Yeah.

1711
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:19,710
Yeah. How much material you can just get
to all the stuff you're working on. Yeah.

1712
01:38:19,711 --> 01:38:23,290
I was doing that even back when I
lived in New York. I really, yeah,

1713
01:38:23,291 --> 01:38:25,140
I didn't believe in those little sets.

1714
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:29,850
I would say I would see this guys that
do the sets in town and one of the,

1715
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:33,960
one of the things that I saw that was
a pattern was that, uh, a lot of them,

1716
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:37,560
although they were great comics,
they were doing like jokes.

1717
01:38:38,370 --> 01:38:41,430
It was there basically saying a lot
of things that didn't really happen.

1718
01:38:41,700 --> 01:38:42,600
And they were,
you know,

1719
01:38:42,601 --> 01:38:45,330
writing a bunch of really funny stuff and
they were setting up and it was almost

1720
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:49,890
either impersonal or it was very
worky. The crowdy. Oh, right.

1721
01:38:49,930 --> 01:38:53,160
You know why they set it up? Yeah.
There, you know they would like bring,

1722
01:38:53,190 --> 01:38:58,190
it was like they were very tight clubs
and they're very small stages and the a

1723
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:00,840
quick,
oh yeah.

1724
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:04,440
How long would you get back down if
you were lucky you got 15 minutes.

1725
01:39:04,441 --> 01:39:06,600
I think danger fields
would give you the longest,

1726
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:08,940
I don't remember it was 20 or 30 minutes.

1727
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:11,760
Danger fields gave you like a real set
that was the only place in town that

1728
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:12,970
everything else was like the most,

1729
01:39:12,971 --> 01:39:16,980
you would get us like 15
minutes or something like
that. Sometimes it was seven,

1730
01:39:16,981 --> 01:39:20,790
sometimes it was 10 but those are
hard because it's all you get.

1731
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:23,670
It's like well I only have one or you
can total it. Like look at a towel.

1732
01:39:23,671 --> 01:39:27,090
It's hell came from that world
and it's brilliant. It's just his,

1733
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:30,440
but his act is that style of,
you know,

1734
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:33,730
a bunch of shit that's not
really happening. And then
a clown came out and bloom.

1735
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:38,580
Hey, but some guys do like
long stories that come out
of there too. Very few. Yeah.

1736
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:41,540
It doesn't seem like that. But they don't
do, they do 15 or 20 minutes. That's,

1737
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,880
and you know what those stories
out and, and doing the road. Yeah.

1738
01:39:44,881 --> 01:39:47,250
The road is where it comes out the road.

1739
01:39:47,290 --> 01:39:51,620
Like those long weekends when you're
doing four shows in a weekend, five shows,

1740
01:39:51,770 --> 01:39:55,320
we do an hour in la for years.
Yeah. Nobody really does that. Yeah.

1741
01:39:55,321 --> 01:39:57,440
That was lucky too.
And um,

1742
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,900
and then there's all the satellite rooms
around la that's always thrown to the

1743
01:40:00,901 --> 01:40:04,180
Bray Improv ice. Yeah. Yeah.

1744
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:06,580
We have a good spot right now.
This is a,

1745
01:40:06,660 --> 01:40:09,090
there's a lot of places to
work out and fuck around here,

1746
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:13,260
but that's the big leap that happens I
think as a comic when you started being a

1747
01:40:13,261 --> 01:40:16,530
headline or you get to go longer when
you get to go longer and you sort of

1748
01:40:16,531 --> 01:40:20,480
understand pacing too. Like
even instinctually, like you
do a set and you're like,

1749
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:23,670
maybe that one was a little off because
I did a little too much of this and not

1750
01:40:23,671 --> 01:40:28,671
enough of that and I need to like go high
and then bring it down a little bit in

1751
01:40:28,740 --> 01:40:31,590
two hours, two hours have to get off
of been doing this joke again. Yeah.

1752
01:40:31,591 --> 01:40:34,470
And then you start looking at your
notes and going over your shit and

1753
01:40:34,471 --> 01:40:37,560
rearranging things and then you
have a new idea pops in your head.

1754
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:41,790
It's like everything else, so as a segue
works really well. It's like, oh yeah.

1755
01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:44,160
It's like everything else.
The more focus you put on it,

1756
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:49,440
the more results the results are. That's
why Lamar Odom is fucking terrible now.

1757
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:51,980
Tomorrow it all comes back
to you and Mario. Okay.

1758
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:54,340
It all comes back to
the Kardashian family.

1759
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,880
What are you going to have your special
come out when? 18th the 18th of December.

1760
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:01,450
Nice. Yeah. The new website
is going live any day now.

1761
01:41:01,451 --> 01:41:04,600
It should be like either today or tomorrow
if you finished it. Yeah, it's done.

1762
01:41:05,110 --> 01:41:07,210
Cheesy, cheesy. I didn't
have to edit much.

1763
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:11,140
It was almost all the first
show in Atlanta, the first show.

1764
01:41:11,141 --> 01:41:14,320
I got everything the way I want it to
accept like a couple of taglines that I

1765
01:41:14,321 --> 01:41:18,310
stuck in from the second show. It
was really easy. It was easy. Yeah.

1766
01:41:18,311 --> 01:41:21,040
There was a couple, a couple of lines
that I forgot in the first show,

1767
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:23,020
but it was such a great crowd was so fun.

1768
01:41:23,780 --> 01:41:26,980
We wanted to take those lines that
you've forgotten victims fitting back in

1769
01:41:26,981 --> 01:41:29,250
there. It's just don't lose them
forever. I had to put them in there.

1770
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:33,040
There'll be gone because they forgot
library. Yeah, they would be gone forever.

1771
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:36,580
They were really good lines and a, they
don't fit anywhere else. Not Right.

1772
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:38,950
They're a joke.
It's just pertaining to that one subject.

1773
01:41:38,951 --> 01:41:41,890
I can't go back to that side of
[inaudible] would like to wear. Yeah,

1774
01:41:41,891 --> 01:41:45,310
it was easy because I did the same bid
and the second show so I just took part

1775
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:48,130
of it and I I it was only twice
on two. Uh, two different.

1776
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:50,440
You got sidetracked in your mind
sometimes when you're like talking like,

1777
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,020
oh look, a normal human. Yeah, fuck goes.

1778
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:55,630
And he dropped the next two sentences
you were going to say, yeah,

1779
01:41:55,631 --> 01:42:00,010
that and you and I have similar styles
in that we're not very structured on

1780
01:42:00,011 --> 01:42:03,310
stage. We fuck around a lot and
then leave ourselves room to ad Lib.

1781
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:06,830
And I do that even when I record special
and you forget to go back to. Yeah.

1782
01:42:07,250 --> 01:42:12,250
So I do all of a sudden he sold to like
try a little more to do just to get

1783
01:42:13,181 --> 01:42:17,470
through it. Word for word. I would
think so but no, not the last.

1784
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:21,130
That special that I did in Atlanta was
the first time that I was ever on stage

1785
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:22,840
or even though it was filming a special,

1786
01:42:22,841 --> 01:42:25,900
it was exactly like I was having
a comedy shows having a set.

1787
01:42:25,930 --> 01:42:27,970
Yeah you did everything the same.

1788
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,800
You know it wasn't like all right look
I have to do this sober because this is

1789
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:35,170
fuck that. Pass it, pass it. It's
do this. We you know had the,

1790
01:42:35,171 --> 01:42:37,240
I had a beer,
I think I had a glass of wine.

1791
01:42:37,300 --> 01:42:40,330
There was that guy who snuck into
the green room, brought his own beer,

1792
01:42:40,380 --> 01:42:41,213
remember that ship Ryan

1793
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:44,310
really weird and he just
snuck in ahead like,

1794
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:48,370
like somehow like I'm your man with a
beard for Joe Rogan. Local beer maker.

1795
01:42:48,371 --> 01:42:51,640
Wanted to just wanted to get me his beer,

1796
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:54,670
bullshitted his way into the green room.

1797
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:58,450
Cool guy with like that
seemed like a nice guy.

1798
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:01,300
I'm going to thank him on the
CD cover early for the beer.

1799
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:05,170
You can drink the beer. Drank his beer.
Nice guy. I thought it was a ballsy move.

1800
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:08,560
Not that I'm encouraging it.
You fuck stop it.

1801
01:43:08,790 --> 01:43:11,680
Enough of that bullshit my way
into places. I'm sure he did.

1802
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,730
That whole Trent Reznor thing's hilarious.
The most embarrassing thing.

1803
01:43:15,731 --> 01:43:20,680
One time I got my self like back into the
green room about Wayne Concert and uh,

1804
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:24,340
I wasn't supposed to be back there and I
was with this girl and I was just like,

1805
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:26,830
we came in and were like,
hey guys, what's up?

1806
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:28,180
And they booked all just like looked over.

1807
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:30,940
I think they were doing something bad
or something like that. They were like,

1808
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,750
okay, get out. And then I'm like, so they
left you there. I just asked you that.

1809
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:41,030
Have some cool thing they
do with the Internet. Like
you're allowed to use their,

1810
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:44,620
their songs for like pretty much
anything [inaudible] now. Yeah.

1811
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:47,540
They have all the songs on
loop nonstop from Pandora

1812
01:43:49,180 --> 01:43:51,980
before that time. But yeah,
you're allowed like use them

1813
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,060
for things too. They're like, let people
use their songs. Really. I know. I, I'd,

1814
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:58,660
I'd heard something like that.
Like they let go ahead.

1815
01:43:58,661 --> 01:44:02,060
Like it's put it in a rap song and do
whatever the fuck you want. That song.

1816
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:06,840
Hash pipe. That's a bad ass on hash.
I know that reserve version of it. Oh,

1817
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,530
pull. Pull it up Brian. See if he
could pull it out. Wean Hash Pipe.

1818
01:44:09,531 --> 01:44:14,280
It's fucking great song. Yeah, it's
my favorite Wayne Song. Really? Yeah.

1819
01:44:14,430 --> 01:44:18,490
Yeah, yeah. I can't believe you've
never heard it. I never really got that.

1820
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:22,880
You have, you're talking about
Weezer. Oh, did I say ween? Yeah.

1821
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:27,980
Weezer yeah, it's a totally different
game. Wrote that song. Yeah.

1822
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:29,450
That's a totally different band band.

1823
01:44:29,451 --> 01:44:33,970
Well they should sue because I got
confused. So shows whoever was first.

1824
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:38,000
Wayne broke up now. So it's all
these weeds are still together. Yeah.

1825
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:41,720
That's all I got for it. Do it. Well
guess what? We use better hash pipe songs.

1826
01:44:41,721 --> 01:44:46,630
The Shit I loved. Weezer
man, is this it? Yeah.

1827
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:50,890
And cleaning kit. The commercials. Oh God.
Commercials. You know what's gross man?

1828
01:44:50,891 --> 01:44:53,810
I've been reading websites lately.
I don't want to name any names,

1829
01:44:54,020 --> 01:44:56,060
but in the middle of reading,
the website,

1830
01:44:56,360 --> 01:45:00,920
commercial will pop up and you
have to click add, so disrupts you.

1831
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:05,300
Oh, how dare you. You fuck
heads. Plus when you're high,

1832
01:45:05,301 --> 01:45:08,480
if you get your concentration interrupted,
but you've got to make a whole trip.

1833
01:45:09,170 --> 01:45:12,970
Yeah. Jesus fucking Christ,
man. Why you remixed thing this?

1834
01:45:13,810 --> 01:45:16,020
Just play it. Play it. Play it right

1835
01:45:16,130 --> 01:45:16,963
little.

1836
01:45:24,630 --> 01:45:28,620
I feel the need to remix shit. That's a
great band. It's a great fucking song.

1837
01:45:29,010 --> 01:45:33,760
That's a great God damn song. It's
still, you're mixing it. The Echo,

1838
01:45:34,330 --> 01:45:38,950
the echo that stuck second
said no, I know you.

1839
01:45:38,951 --> 01:45:41,140
Are you ever go play laser tag?
Yeah.

1840
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:46,270
I miss playing laser tag tag in
Los Angeles. I want you to go,

1841
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:50,800

You would be surprised at how, uh,

1842
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:55,580
how much your stamina has dropped since
the last time you played laser tag laser.

1843
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:58,120
You'll do one role. I'd be like, you know,

1844

I went to [inaudible].

1845
01:46:03,250 --> 01:46:06,680

them ever. I hit one out of 20 shot.

1846
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:11,530
He gets 13 times. He got like six.
He's really great angel. That pig.

1847
01:46:11,531 --> 01:46:14,940
I've changed my opinion. Oh yeah.
Music was amazing. It's true, man.

1848

up. Oh, you guys on, you're talking about,

1849
01:46:19,301 --> 01:46:23,740

had roast a pig roast. It's an animal.

1850
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:28,510

that guy. Anyway, he uh, his show, um,

called a yeah. Yeah. Try it.

1852
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,480

1853
01:46:37,500 --> 01:46:40,900

was on his show the other day.

1854
01:46:40,901 --> 01:46:45,830
I just showed up at this gun range.
She called me to go really fluffy people.

1855
01:46:45,850 --> 01:46:48,130
They're like, he has, he takes
people and takes them on a tour.

1856
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:51,540
He took him on a tour, La and one of
the things they wanted to do was like,

1857
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:55,020
do some stuff with different people that
they liked. And it was so Burt said,

1858
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:57,000
do you want to shoot skeet?
Shoot with me.

1859
01:46:57,190 --> 01:47:01,020
So it was me and these people
against Burt and I think Birdie,

1860
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:04,440
they're tied us or beat us.
All of our scores together.

1861
01:47:04,441 --> 01:47:08,040
We were with three of us were putting
that. He just knows how to do it. Yeah.

1862
01:47:08,041 --> 01:47:11,610
I never shot a shotgun before at like
those moving claims you have to run with

1863
01:47:11,611 --> 01:47:13,110
it. It's just, I saw it. He did it.

1864
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:16,020
He never did it either and he was
pretty good at it really. But man,

1865
01:47:16,021 --> 01:47:19,200
how good does it feel? Warm blows up.
It's awesome. I only happened twice.

1866
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,350
It's 13 times in the fucking thing.

1867
01:47:22,351 --> 01:47:26,070
Keeps saying me go side to side or it
goes away. It goes all over the place.

1868
01:47:26,071 --> 01:47:28,920
It they just, you don't know where it's
going. You have this whole launch him.

1869
01:47:28,921 --> 01:47:32,040
Yeah, he, I'll pull and then you
try to like catch it with a shotgun.

1870
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:35,550
It's fucking hard. Wow. It's hard. Yeah.
It's fun though. Really, really, really,

1873
01:47:40,710 --> 01:47:44,280
I'm glad Burt finally put together a
podcast. I heard it. It's hilarious.

1874
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:49,030
Of course. Of course it is.
He's such a great honorable,

1875
01:47:49,900 --> 01:47:53,820

things that happened to him or dudes

1876
01:47:53,821 --> 01:47:56,910

a fucking sick game for the IPAD.

1887
01:48:34,980 --> 01:48:37,410
I pulling my iPad out of storage.

1888
01:48:37,620 --> 01:48:42,150
I stopped using my iPad because um,
uh, even though it's an awesome tool,

1889
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,830
I would read books on it mostly.

1890
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:48,420
And I went back to like just a regular
book reader because I found that if I

1891
01:48:48,510 --> 01:48:51,090
know that I can just stop
reading this book and go online.

1892
01:48:51,091 --> 01:48:54,690
I'll just go online and let us, let me
check my email real quick. And then Noah,

1894
01:48:57,410 --> 01:49:00,110

fucking, I'm not reading anymore. I'm,

1895
01:49:00,111 --> 01:49:02,910

computer veggie now. Um,

High resolution games only for the
IPAD or the computer? No, no, no.

01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:41,220
Like that's why like
Nintendos and all that shit.

the best way of interfacing. Yeah.

1908
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:52,720
Know Poland triggers is fun.
Like actually pulling the trigger,

1909
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,070
those video games where you pull out,

1910
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:58,000
you have to plug the thing in offscreen
to reload. Those were fun games.

1911
01:49:58,001 --> 01:49:59,800
Zombie Games. Yeah. I love those.

1912
01:50:03,610 --> 01:50:08,130

Will you think you're in that world and
actually shooting zombies was going to

1916
01:50:17,860 --> 01:50:20,290
go that way, right? Yeah.
They must be close to that.

1917
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,460
I think something happened and like the
visuals were stalled out for a long.

1918
01:50:24,490 --> 01:50:27,760
Dave and Buster's had something click
close but you didn't really feel like you

1919
01:50:27,761 --> 01:50:30,160
were there but you sorted it.
I don't remember that one that much,

1920
01:50:30,161 --> 01:50:32,500
but I know I remember something
about that like they had,

1921
01:50:32,501 --> 01:50:36,310
they had tried it but it sucked the
fat one. It just wasn't that good.

1922
01:50:36,370 --> 01:50:39,730
I want it to be like inception where you
just fucking go, you can kill anybody,

1923
01:50:39,731 --> 01:50:43,550
but if you get killed, boom, you're
awake, you're out, you know. Ah,

1924
01:50:44,140 --> 01:50:47,410
that's possible. Why wouldn't
it be possible? You really
feel like you're there.

1925
01:50:48,160 --> 01:50:50,680
Will you remember in inception when he
realized at the end that he was still in

1926
01:50:50,681 --> 01:50:54,880
it? Spoiler alert, Euler. He didn't
realize, he didn't realize it,

1927
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:57,790
but we realized,
we realized that there was care anymore.

1928
01:50:57,820 --> 01:51:02,820
Some fuckery afoot perhaps
locked in a alternate reality.

1929
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:05,230
The debts.

1930
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:09,520
That would be the coolest
way to experience a video
game for sure it would be,

1931
01:51:10,920 --> 01:51:12,810
but I feel like they had that
in the x files and it like,

1932
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:17,110
it would go bad of course like someone
would get killed in the virtual world.

1933
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:19,260
If you had a feel game inside,
you were like the,

1934
01:51:19,320 --> 01:51:22,350
like the scoring was inside
your body. Explain like, like,

1935
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:24,580
like you'd look up and you'd
see the score inside your,

1936
01:51:24,581 --> 01:51:28,670
your eyes feel like if you

1937
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:35,170
fucking get hit with feel
it. Yeah. Driving game.

1938
01:51:35,171 --> 01:51:37,390
We sick too and you could just see
like you're looking at the inside of a

1939
01:51:37,391 --> 01:51:41,020
windshield or have your score up there.
Virtual reality,

1940
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:44,860
airplane simulators, flight
simulations, those are big early on.

1941
01:51:44,890 --> 01:51:47,200
Airplane simulators.
Well they use them for training.

1942
01:51:47,260 --> 01:51:49,830
They still use it for training pilots.
And so is that why the nerds liked it?

1943
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:53,000
Cause I could feel like army people.
Yeah. Well also, you know it's,

1944
01:51:53,001 --> 01:51:57,310
it's how they train people to handle
like how a plane really reacts.

1945
01:51:57,520 --> 01:52:00,160
Like they can get it pretty
close. I never, I was like,

1946
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:04,300
you don't kill anybody in
these things. No, you don't
shoot anything. No, no, no, no,

1947
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:07,740
no. Check out this iPad game. All right.
This is about flying around. Look at it.

1948
01:52:07,900 --> 01:52:11,410
This is the game.
Like wow,

1949
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:15,520
the graphics are fucking
slow to avoid that guy.

1950
01:52:17,740 --> 01:52:19,330
And this is like,
you know,

1951
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:22,750
you're in an airport or something
somewhere and you want to waste some time.

1952
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:25,420
You will run out of batteries
planning this motherfucker.

1953
01:52:30,730 --> 01:52:31,920
The cool thing about it is that

1954
01:52:32,850 --> 01:52:35,490
decided to make these things,
uh,

1955
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:37,740
have you played that game and
just see the preview. Yeah.

1956
01:52:37,741 --> 01:52:41,730
I've been playing this since
Beta. It's really good. Fine.

1957
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:43,660
Okay, well I'll ask. It's like one
of those games like, I don't know.

1958
01:52:43,661 --> 01:52:46,010
Have you ever done where you
like you swipe left and right,

1959
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:49,440
like, you know, attack them? Whenever
I look at video games that yeah. Okay.

1960
01:52:49,460 --> 01:52:52,340
I feel like I'm a heroin
addict. That's like, it just,

1961
01:52:52,341 --> 01:52:56,140
I just always know there's going to be
a day when I'm gonna come back. Oh yeah.

1962
01:52:56,141 --> 01:53:00,200
You're a junkie. It's like, it's
like a heroin addict to say, listen,

1963
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:02,990
I'm going to not do heroin
for at least five years,

1964
01:53:03,410 --> 01:53:06,590
but there's going to be one day where
I'm going to put on some fucking pink

1965
01:53:06,591 --> 01:53:11,210
Floyd. That's what alcoholics do. They
still say they're alcoholics. Get back to,

1966
01:53:11,240 --> 01:53:13,090
is the new trapped in the closet,
do you know?

1967
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:16,010
No.
It's up to chapter 32

1968
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:20,020
32 it's r Kelly ended up in class.

1969
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:23,580
You don't even know their videos

1970
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:30,310
trapped in the closet.
How was the wait in the car?

1971
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:36,630
This is real damn bird.
That's what's act it out.

1972
01:53:39,450 --> 01:53:43,560
Hold that deal with this
shit on you this time.

1973
01:53:47,160 --> 01:53:51,220
Oh my God.
You keep your hands until you try it.

1974
01:53:51,221 --> 01:53:52,630
I would love to see you be our sniper.

1975
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:56,800
I was trying to turn up the volume.

1976
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:58,473
Go with the whole,

1977
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:07,270
you can't bullshit me. Don't see
him. I asked him so can't even see

1978
01:54:08,820 --> 01:54:13,820
that cop diamonds hanging around our
Achilles Nick Mario Brothers game.

1979
01:54:21,490 --> 01:54:26,200
He's got like this crazy bold some shit.

1980
01:54:29,470 --> 01:54:30,303
Yeah.

1981
01:54:32,970 --> 01:54:37,810
Wow. What is this? It's so, he's like
sort of making it a priority to himself.

1982
01:54:39,930 --> 01:54:42,860
What's he that guy? He was like a
soul. There was never a pip guy.

1983
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:47,210
Yeah,
it's a different guy.

1984
01:54:48,500 --> 01:54:49,333
Okay.

1985
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:53,710
This is don the magic wand.
The bar.

1986
01:54:53,711 --> 01:54:57,220
A few racks in a place like this
isn't even a real song though.

1987
01:54:57,980 --> 01:54:59,530
Check out all 32 GS.

1988
01:54:59,640 --> 01:55:02,900
Well it started out how many
hits they have, his holdings,

1989
01:55:02,940 --> 01:55:04,340
it's trapped in the closet.

1990
01:55:04,350 --> 01:55:09,350
Started out as a music video that became
this sort of like a musical that became

1991
01:55:10,441 --> 01:55:14,190
a DVD and I bought it and I've sat
there and wash it with mouth agape,

1992
01:55:14,191 --> 01:55:18,330
like just horrible. It's unbelievably,
but it's not just horrible,

1993
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:21,930
but it's like what's it's, it's
insanity. It's like complete insanity.

1994
01:55:21,960 --> 01:55:24,600
But it's so insane that
it becomes really good.

1995
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:26,970
It becomes entertaining
because it's so crazy.

1996
01:55:27,420 --> 01:55:27,790
Yeah,

1997
01:55:27,790 --> 01:55:29,320
man.
I like that one song.

1998
01:55:29,321 --> 01:55:31,990
What was the song that we kept
playing over and over again?

1999
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:33,090
MMM.

2000
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:39,050
Cherish should love the art Kelly Song.
You know,

2001
01:55:39,051 --> 01:55:42,980
behind the scenes. Yeah.
Uh, trapping the trap. No,

2002
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:44,220
wasn't trapped in the closet.

2003
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:47,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2004
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:50,970
It was behind the scenes.
Oh my God.

2005
01:55:50,971 --> 01:55:53,910
I can't believe I can't remember
it because we played it so much.

2006
01:55:54,530 --> 01:55:57,170
I told you we need to start
putting the Alpha brain interim.

2007
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:01,800
It was so well I picture it
wasn't trapped in the closet man.

2008
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:06,120
It wasn't, no, no, no, no,
no. It was one where he got in
a fight with his girlfriend.

2009
01:56:06,121 --> 01:56:08,920
Remember that's trapped in the closet.
Like number one you have no, no,

2010
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:11,340
no in the closet because you know,

2011
01:56:11,341 --> 01:56:16,260
like has it can get trapped in the closet
was like he was having an affair and

2012
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:19,610
she was having an affair and he was,
this guy was gay.

2013
01:56:19,640 --> 01:56:23,190
There's a lot of shit going on.
This isn't supposed to be about him.

2014
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:25,750
Well you going, are you going to go pee
again? Because the little child, go ahead.

2015
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:29,310
Go Pee coke addiction.
Someone in the on Twitter,

2016
01:56:29,311 --> 01:56:31,260
I'm sure knows if you're
listening on Twitter.

2017
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:33,300
Let me know what the fuck
video I'm talking about.

2018
01:56:33,301 --> 01:56:36,460
I can't believe I can't remember the,
um,

2019
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:40,970
it was a spectacular
video, you know, I mean,

2020
01:56:41,250 --> 01:56:42,083
I'm just going to watch it.

2021
01:56:42,150 --> 01:56:46,830
Bitch. I wish you would burn
my mother fucking clothes.

2022
01:56:47,180 --> 01:56:48,370
Maybe that we'll talk

2023
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:53,050
real talk. Real talk with
Art Kelly Dude. That,

2024
01:56:53,230 --> 01:56:58,180
that is one of the all time great
unintentional pieces of comedy. Real talk.

2025
01:56:58,230 --> 01:57:00,640
Yeah. I always thought they
were the same for some reason.

2026
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:04,870
No way we'll talk is way better.
Archives of bad mother. Yeah.

2027
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:08,560
Pull up real talk and we'll
plant when Ari comes back.

2028
01:57:08,561 --> 01:57:12,580
So I don't feel like such a fucking
fool. I could not remember it. Uh,

2029
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:14,080
it was one of my favorite things,

2030
01:57:14,290 --> 01:57:18,460
but the problem was I watched it so
many times that I actually had to like

2031
01:57:18,461 --> 01:57:22,000
promise myself I wasn't going to watch
it anymore because I was watching it like

2032
01:57:22,001 --> 01:57:26,020
once every couple of days and it was
like I was wasting big chunks of my time

2033
01:57:26,170 --> 01:57:28,930
and then I would shut it off like two
minutes in going, what am I doing?

2034
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,100
Why am I still watching this?

2035
01:57:31,730 --> 01:57:32,563
Hmm.

2036
01:57:32,570 --> 01:57:37,570
Because it's so hard to tell if he's
being serious or if it's a parody because

2037
01:57:39,201 --> 01:57:40,990
it's so good.
So

2038
01:57:41,060 --> 01:57:44,390
because I think it's a great song,
you know what I'm saying?

2039
01:57:44,391 --> 01:57:48,080
Even though it's a lot of profanity in it,
but the profanity represents,

2040
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:52,070
this is just how real real when
you argued with your girl and Shit,

2041
01:57:52,450 --> 01:57:54,830
you know what I'm saying?
So I did it on Youtube,

2042
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:58,100
but I'm going to do to see if
y'all on youtube. No, hold on.

2043
01:57:58,101 --> 01:58:00,980
I gotta get me a drink to take me a shot.

2044
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:05,980
Calls me back the stone. He's
jumping off here. So be real message.

2045
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:09,110
I'm just going to be real. We just don't
roll with them. And we're going to do it.

2046
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:14,170
I'm doing this for the fans that I know.
We'll talk.

2047
01:58:18,340 --> 01:58:19,540
Wait a minute.
Calm down.

2048
01:58:21,710 --> 01:58:22,543
I was at a club,

2049
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:27,543
man.

2050
01:58:27,640 --> 01:58:28,550
No one

2051
01:58:29,790 --> 01:58:32,690
girl. I'm not about to sit up
here and argue with you about.

2052
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:39,880
We'll talk seeker. Only thing I'm
trying to establish with Jews,

2053
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:41,730
not who's right,
right here.

2054
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:48,760
Just because your friends say she
saw me at a club with some model

2055
01:58:50,750 --> 01:58:55,730
small getting intrigue and he kick and
knee. This is my best person to say that.

2056
01:58:55,731 --> 01:59:00,140
We'll all the guys there. Did she
stay? There were other guys there.

2057
01:59:00,860 --> 01:59:04,310
Well,
the other guy's day will tell me this.

2058
01:59:05,270 --> 01:59:10,190
How the fuck she know I was with the
mother when the whole, wait a minute,

2059
01:59:10,191 --> 01:59:12,010
let me finish what I've got to say.

2060
01:59:15,410 --> 01:59:20,410
Fucking girl Kelly Kelly talk.

2061
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:23,430
I want to see this explanation.

2062
01:59:24,130 --> 01:59:27,300
That's r Kelly.
So what was his reason for being there?

2063
01:59:27,301 --> 01:59:28,350
But we're just going to say to you,
we,

2064
01:59:28,351 --> 01:59:30,520
you would have to listen to the whole
thing and I don't think we're allowed to

2065
01:59:30,521 --> 01:59:34,290
play the whole thing, but it's a, it's
fucking a work of art. That's a real talk.

2066
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,360
Thompson girl always talks about real
talk. Yeah. It's brilliant. Oh Man.

2067
01:59:38,020 --> 01:59:41,710
Our Kelly's just weird guy where it's
like, everything he does is kind of funny,

2068
01:59:42,100 --> 01:59:45,100
but I don't, I'm not sure if he's trying
to be funny, but when you watch that,

2069
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:47,320
he was definitely trying to be funny.
That trapped in the closet.

2070
01:59:47,321 --> 01:59:51,020
Like he was like, he was milking it for
everything. I mean, real talk. Yeah.

2071
01:59:51,180 --> 01:59:55,720
He had crazy glasses are pimp
outfit. Yeah. Okay. He was
trying to be funny there.

2072
01:59:55,870 --> 02:00:00,010
Yeah. So we'll, yeah, yeah.
Art To be a character. Yeah.
But so what does he doing?

2073
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,710
Sometimes he's trying to be funny.
Sometimes he's not cruise us.

2074
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:06,820
They were talking about him. Like,
what is it crazy? I think it's crazy.

2075
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,370
I think it's crazy. The, uh, access TV,

2076
02:00:09,371 --> 02:00:14,020
I think it was maybe had one
of his concerts on, yeah.
He was like, this is like,

2077
02:00:14,021 --> 02:00:18,250
he's single now. And this one is for the
ladies, you know, and you know, anything,

2078
02:00:18,530 --> 02:00:22,000
any ad this, uh, this advertisement.
I was excited. I'm like,

2079
02:00:22,001 --> 02:00:23,450
I want to see this concert.
Yeah.

2080
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:27,010
I want to see this craziness that
this guy's putting out. Lizzy Dylan,

2081
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:29,380
he might've fucked too many women.

2082
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:33,850
I might've gone crazy with it. Yeah. Well,

2083
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:39,160
could you imagine the volume
of crazy pussy that r Kelly,

2084
02:00:39,161 --> 02:00:40,690
how's going his way?
Just the volume.

2085
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:45,670
The sheer volume of if you ever seen
him in concert and seeing those girls go

2086
02:00:45,671 --> 02:00:49,780
crazy for him. No. Oh, there
we go. No significant. Yeah.

2087
02:00:50,020 --> 02:00:53,860
Oh my God. They just scream and
lose their mind. Sane. Insane.

2088
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:55,310
They're going nuts.
Wow.

2089
02:00:55,480 --> 02:01:00,480
There's thousands of them and they're
all women and they're going to bananas.

2090
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:05,320
There's like four gay guys in the crowd
and that's it.

2091
02:01:05,321 --> 02:01:10,230
The rest is women, women, men
on dates and shit. You know,

2092
02:01:10,231 --> 02:01:13,370
and some dudes you can respect real talk,
but for the most part,

2093
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:18,640
a lot of crazy bitches did that.
Is that whole sleeve more?

2094
02:01:18,790 --> 02:01:21,700
Mostly knew this one. Yeah.
That's like three years old.

2095
02:01:21,730 --> 02:01:25,490
I don't remember the flower with a stripe
down the middle of it. Oh, the, um,

2096
02:01:25,550 --> 02:01:28,440
like up a little cherry blossom.
Yeah, that's right here. Yeah. Yeah.

2097
02:01:28,450 --> 02:01:30,990
That's been there. I got to go
back to them. Thank you very much,

2098
02:01:31,050 --> 02:01:34,150
Darren Dellavedova from girl Tattoo.
It's not done yet. It's not finished.

2099
02:01:34,151 --> 02:01:38,350
I love following him on Facebook because
every like every day or so he'll post

2100
02:01:38,351 --> 02:01:40,180
like new photos of work he he's

2101
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:44,630
doing are doing right now and it's just
so cool to look at his art every day.

2102
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:49,650
Sometimes he puts a button at the insight.
Brian,

2103
02:01:52,190 --> 02:01:54,290
well he doesn't do,
but we should do clarify.

2104
02:01:54,291 --> 02:01:57,380
He doesn't do like dragons on
your Dick or anything freaky.

2105
02:01:57,710 --> 02:01:59,130
So if you're one of those markets,

2106
02:01:59,270 --> 02:02:03,170
if he's showing you it's because he like
tattooed a cheek or something like that.

2107
02:02:03,171 --> 02:02:05,350
Okay. It's not like the actual
butthole, like excellent.

2108
02:02:07,010 --> 02:02:10,880
My favorite [inaudible] I need to get my
tattoo fucking done cats and she would

2109
02:02:10,881 --> 02:02:13,550
get, she said she'd do it.
She was probably lying. Yeah,

2110
02:02:13,551 --> 02:02:16,160
she probably wasn't that long ago.
I'm sure she wasn't.

2111
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:18,420
It's probably a matter of right down,
but then it's like not through it.

2112
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:21,980
If they don't call me. Yeah,
I'd rather not spend 20 hours.

2113
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:24,290
I think she would do it.
It just,

2114
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:28,130
you might want to like see if he could
get the old one laser the little first.

2115
02:02:28,130 --> 02:02:31,790
So it's just not like, yeah, because if
he want to get something there, you know,

2116
02:02:31,791 --> 02:02:34,750
if you want to get a tattoo there right
now, you've got this big spot there.

2117
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:36,770
Where are you going to have some anchor
that you don't want the other arm?

2118
02:02:37,300 --> 02:02:39,830
Let's see. Get, have an idea of
what you want to do with that area.

2119
02:02:39,831 --> 02:02:43,520
The desk squad cat around that in the
circle could actually be where the,

2120
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:46,880
the uh thing though. Just have
that clock. The clock would be one.

2121
02:02:46,890 --> 02:02:50,240
I have the oh yeah.
The only problem is it'd be really hard.

2122
02:02:50,241 --> 02:02:53,060
It's like got to have white
ink over the uh, the red.

2123
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:57,420
It's going to be a black one with
a white mustache. No, no, no.

2124
02:02:57,421 --> 02:02:59,990
The what is the circle? They're
like, what's the Red Circle? Oh,

2125
02:02:59,991 --> 02:03:02,180
that's going to be the
clock and I'll just keep,

2126
02:03:03,100 --> 02:03:05,690
just keep that old time face
looking thing like an antique,

2127
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,830
you know what I'm saying to you?
You want to keep it,

2128
02:03:08,870 --> 02:03:11,360
you want it to be a red face.
The clock? Yeah. Why not?

2129
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:15,110
Instead of holding the class holding
the cat is holding your original tattoo.

2130
02:03:15,730 --> 02:03:18,170
Cool. That's, that'll last.

2131
02:03:18,171 --> 02:03:22,010
We'll also have like a story for her
and you'll feel good that you took this

2132
02:03:22,011 --> 02:03:26,120
thing that sucked. It made it
better. You recycled? Yeah. Yeah.

2133
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:31,150
It'll look cool if it's a little worn
down to deal when dudes from random place

2134
02:03:31,441 --> 02:03:35,630
to start getting that tattooed on my
body. That's a super hard, super hard.

2135
02:03:36,260 --> 02:03:37,530
Super hard with a finger up your butt.

2136
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:45,330
What does that even Ari soundbite.

2137
02:03:46,150 --> 02:03:49,730
That's of my album and that's the
one that's available right now.

2138
02:03:49,731 --> 02:03:52,790
That's only been for sale for like
how long? A couple of months now.

2139
02:03:52,910 --> 02:03:56,090
It was number one. The 25th yeah.
Number one. Number one iTunes.

2140
02:03:56,091 --> 02:03:58,790
And then from that you've
already got a whole new hour.

2141
02:03:58,791 --> 02:04:01,940
That's pretty fuckin industrious
young man. Yeah, but it's been like,

2142
02:04:01,941 --> 02:04:04,370
it's been like 14 months when
it would've recorded. Right.

2143
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,730
When Aubrey called you and told you
that he liked what I was doing in Texas,

2144
02:04:07,731 --> 02:04:11,390
that was like three months ago. And that's
all. It was all new. That's awesome man.

2145
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:14,840
Yeah, it feels, yeah, it feels kind
of cool. You're doing the same shit.

2146
02:04:15,500 --> 02:04:17,040
You're writing so much now.
Yeah.

2147
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:19,160
I think it's just a matter
of working out that muscle.

2148
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:22,560
It's definitely got better at
it. It's definitely that. Um,

2149
02:04:22,850 --> 02:04:27,080
I think podcasts help too, man. Work
your mind. You mean it helps everything.

2150
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,450
It helps expand your subject.
Yeah.

2151
02:04:29,550 --> 02:04:32,360
So many things that we talk about on
the podcast that they become like,

2152
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:35,180
or a new stories or whatever.
That becomes super interesting also,

2153
02:04:35,181 --> 02:04:38,280
especially on this podcast. He talked
to a lot of interesting weird people.

2154
02:04:38,520 --> 02:04:42,180
So you gain perspective. Oh yeah.
That more than you would've before.

2155
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:44,790
Getting firsthand like talk to them
where you can actually, you know,

2156
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:49,110
understand things. Yeah. And it's
a bigger well to draw from sh yeah.

2157
02:04:49,111 --> 02:04:50,930
And we're getting new
people all the time too.

2158
02:04:50,940 --> 02:04:53,730
Like this chick that we had yesterday,
Cara Santa Maria,

2159
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:57,360
she was fucking brilliant man and really,

2160
02:04:57,361 --> 02:04:59,760
really smart and but
like really interesting.

2161
02:04:59,761 --> 02:05:01,830
Take something like very hard liner.

2162
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:06,510
Hard line for science pro
GMO plants. Pro Gmo. Yeah.

2163
02:05:06,511 --> 02:05:09,270
Pro Genetically Modified Foods.
Saying there's no evidence that it's,

2164
02:05:09,330 --> 02:05:13,990
it's bad pro pharmaceutical companies
because they produce good things like

2165
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:17,790
antidepressants and anti chemical anti
alliance thing that goes a little too far

2166
02:05:17,791 --> 02:05:20,500
sometimes aren't terrible
aspirins. Awesome. She,

2167
02:05:20,550 --> 02:05:24,120
but she was a very sensitive person and
that's what would the interesting thing

2168
02:05:24,121 --> 02:05:29,121
was that she was just very sensitive
person who has this sort of hard line like

2169
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:32,730
defense when it comes to science.
But then other than that,

2170
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:33,870
she was like talking about like,

2171
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:37,320
she would never hurt a person if someone's
coming to attack or she thinks she

2172
02:05:37,321 --> 02:05:39,750
would just not defend herself.
Oh really? Yeah. Yeah.

2173
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,410
I found that really fascinating. I'm
like, that's, that's, that's really,

2174
02:05:43,450 --> 02:05:46,980
it's really interesting
that uh, people like, um,

2175
02:05:47,310 --> 02:05:51,060
that they think about things completely
alien and different than the way you

2176
02:05:51,061 --> 02:05:51,331
would,

2177
02:05:51,331 --> 02:05:56,331
or I would or I am fascinated
by different people's ways of,

2178
02:05:56,411 --> 02:06:00,360
uh, of navigating life, especially
smart people. You know, how they,

2179
02:06:00,361 --> 02:06:05,130
how they look at the whole thing. Like
there's a lot, like I make fun of Vegans,

2180
02:06:05,220 --> 02:06:08,970
but there's a lot to being a Vegan that
seems to me to represent someone is

2181
02:06:08,971 --> 02:06:13,440
trying to rise above the most ruthless
aspects of being a human being.

2182
02:06:13,770 --> 02:06:17,280
That consumption of other living
animals when they come down to like,

2183
02:06:17,320 --> 02:06:20,570
it's unlike the cruelty to animals and
looking nothing to argue with there. Yeah.

2184
02:06:20,580 --> 02:06:22,780
No way that you can't overlook.

2185
02:06:22,790 --> 02:06:27,390
So for my enjoyment for this animal
cruelty is a sign of human cruelty.

2186
02:06:27,810 --> 02:06:30,240
It's a sign of accepted depravity.

2187
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:33,780
Like you can get away with it because
you're not doing it to a person. Yeah.

2188
02:06:33,810 --> 02:06:38,250
But this is the same muscle that makes
you stab a dog over and over again with a

2189
02:06:38,251 --> 02:06:40,740
pencil that'll make you do
that to a person you're,

2190
02:06:40,750 --> 02:06:43,500
you're a sick fuck or something
wrong with you. You know?

2191
02:06:43,710 --> 02:06:47,940
And I think the idea of being a Vegan,
and I was like a really,

2192
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:52,950
I think it's a very powerful idea. Yeah.
I see where they're all coming from.

2193
02:06:52,951 --> 02:06:56,270
Is that like eventually we have
to address the fact that we're,

2194
02:06:56,300 --> 02:06:58,980
we're not going to stay
the way we are now.

2195
02:06:59,220 --> 02:07:02,910
Just like we didn't stay the way
we were when our great, great,

2196
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:06,540
great ancestors were single
celled organisms. You know,

2197
02:07:06,570 --> 02:07:10,830
the idea is that life started out as
single cell organisms and wasn't like

2198
02:07:11,070 --> 02:07:14,130
monkeys just fell out
of trees. Okay. They,

2199
02:07:14,131 --> 02:07:16,350
they'd had to develop to
get to that point. Well,

2200
02:07:16,351 --> 02:07:20,730
if that's the case and we look at
where human beings are right now,

2201
02:07:20,731 --> 02:07:24,780
we will look at this sort of new
sentiment that we want to take care of the

2202
02:07:24,781 --> 02:07:27,690
earth. We want to be green, we want to,

2203
02:07:27,720 --> 02:07:31,890
we want to not eat meat and we want to,
you know, be kind to be vegetarians.

2204
02:07:32,190 --> 02:07:37,190
Like it seems like that that is the way
that they believe that human being will

2205
02:07:38,621 --> 02:07:42,190
evolve. It will evolve. Yeah. If you
led to look at, if you had extrapolate,

2206
02:07:42,191 --> 02:07:43,400
if you are completely objective,

2207
02:07:43,401 --> 02:07:46,850
if you weren't a person at all and you had
to say, well, how do you think they're,

2208
02:07:46,860 --> 02:07:48,400
what, what? There's also,

2209
02:07:48,401 --> 02:07:51,100
there's different possibilities of how
we could fuck it up and go the wrong way,

2210
02:07:51,250 --> 02:07:55,030
but if we weren't going to move forward
and become really kind of passionate,

2211
02:07:55,060 --> 02:07:58,720
what do we look up to him? Characteristics
of person. Yeah, and if you,

2212
02:07:58,721 --> 02:08:02,380
if you did create an
entirely vegan culture,

2213
02:08:02,381 --> 02:08:07,381
you would have most likely a much
more friendly openminded kind culture.

2214
02:08:07,990 --> 02:08:09,400
If no one was killing animals,

2215
02:08:09,401 --> 02:08:11,920
it sounds fucked up because you've
got way more shit done. Yeah.

2216
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:16,030
You're just focused on
learning and producing things
and I think you would have

2217
02:08:16,031 --> 02:08:17,410
way less do shit.
I mean,

2218
02:08:17,411 --> 02:08:21,210
it sounds like a silly thing
to say because I'm not a
Vegan and I love meat and

2219
02:08:21,260 --> 02:08:25,120
I'm total hypocrite here, but I'm just
saying, I'm not looking at it as a me.

2220
02:08:25,121 --> 02:08:28,480
I'm looking at it as a PR on
the mind. Yeah. I'm, I'm a,

2221
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:30,910
I'm a mind observing an organism.

2222
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:35,770
I could see how we could go totally
the wrong way and some wacky dude in

2223
02:08:35,771 --> 02:08:40,180
Pakistan could decide to blow up some
wacky dude in India and then shit gets

2224
02:08:40,181 --> 02:08:40,600
crazy.

2225
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:43,780
I could see that happen and I could see
someone in some part of the world that

2226
02:08:43,781 --> 02:08:44,680
really needs a hug,

2227
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:48,220
just completely fucking up everything
cause no one's to prepared for.

2228
02:08:48,221 --> 02:08:52,690
Or I could see it man, if, if nine 11
could have happened and it did happen.

2229
02:08:52,720 --> 02:08:56,260
So we know it could have happened.
If something like that can happen,

2230
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,520
other crazy shit can happen.

2231
02:08:58,360 --> 02:09:01,720
And I know that people are working hard
to stop other crazy shit from happening,

2232
02:09:01,750 --> 02:09:04,660
but the people working just to
make it happen. Yeah. So you can't,

2233
02:09:04,690 --> 02:09:08,920
oh well this and this is not necessarily
the way the human race is going to go.

2234
02:09:08,921 --> 02:09:13,120
Like the human race might just fuck itself
up, but if it doesn't fuck itself up,

2235
02:09:13,450 --> 02:09:18,450
you got to think that that is one
option for elevating the consciousness.

2236
02:09:18,671 --> 02:09:21,490
Like getting to a point where we
no longer need to kill anything.

2237
02:09:21,910 --> 02:09:23,560
The problem with that as predators,

2238
02:09:23,860 --> 02:09:26,800
I mean they have Nile
crocodiles now in Florida,

2239
02:09:26,860 --> 02:09:29,920
that's a new new threat or started
killing them. They have, yeah,

2240
02:09:30,400 --> 02:09:34,420
they have a kill on site or the
Nile crocodiles. But now, I mean,

2241
02:09:34,480 --> 02:09:36,700
look at how big the
fucking everglades are.

2242
02:09:36,790 --> 02:09:39,730
So you've got to go through the everglades
and you've got to find the forest

2243
02:09:39,731 --> 02:09:43,090
rangers. Yeah. And they have to have
guns and just look for these crocodiles.

2244
02:09:43,240 --> 02:09:47,470
And so far they haven't established a
breeding population that they know off,

2245
02:09:47,471 --> 02:09:50,710
but they are fine to start breeding them.
It's fucked. It's out of control. Fucked.

2246
02:09:50,711 --> 02:09:54,190
We're fucked. If they start breeding
were there, people are going to die.

2247
02:09:54,370 --> 02:09:58,360
Dogs are going to die.
Alligators are going to die.
They go kill, kill alligators.

2248
02:09:58,540 --> 02:10:02,260
Like Nile crocodiles are enormous
and they're super aggressive.

2249
02:10:02,290 --> 02:10:06,130
They can be 20 plus feet long.
Whoa. Yeah. They're fucking huge.

2250
02:10:06,160 --> 02:10:09,430
I think the world record was more
than 20 feet long. I think there's a,

2251
02:10:09,431 --> 02:10:14,090
there's a picture of a Nile crocodile
in, um, in, uh, uh, I think it's,

2252
02:10:14,650 --> 02:10:15,910
these are from Egypt at that area.

2253
02:10:15,911 --> 02:10:19,660
It's Thailand or somewhere that they
killed one of the largest crocodiles ever.

2254
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:21,190
See if you could pull that up,
Brian.

2255
02:10:21,191 --> 02:10:25,270
It's like if you look up
largest crocodile ever, dude,

2256
02:10:25,300 --> 02:10:27,790
there are giant and they're super,

2257
02:10:27,791 --> 02:10:31,930
super aggressive and this one crocodile
is responsible for the death of many

2258
02:10:31,931 --> 02:10:33,010
villagers.
Really.

2259
02:10:33,020 --> 02:10:35,840
They were very excited when they track
this fucking thing down and killed it.

2260
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,200
There are normal, yeah. The,

2261
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:41,430
I mean we can't even ratchet
that up back underwater.

2262
02:10:41,470 --> 02:10:44,480
You can't get them no way that they
can go under water for hours. Yeah.

2263
02:10:44,540 --> 02:10:46,940
They don't even have to pop up. They
did. They don't have to breathe.

2264
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:48,890
They can just stop their hearts.
Basically.

2265
02:10:49,150 --> 02:10:51,830
They dropped their heart
rate to like almost nothing,

2266
02:10:51,831 --> 02:10:54,630
but they kind of just has their
eyes out the out the water. Yeah.

2267
02:10:54,650 --> 02:10:59,480
And there's a way to have long snouts
the difference between them and the,

2268
02:10:59,500 --> 02:11:03,830
uh, the American alligator is big and
a lot of people wanted to protect the

2269
02:11:03,831 --> 02:11:07,640
alligator because alligators to a lot
of people represented like some unique

2270
02:11:07,641 --> 02:11:10,350
species that we just were lucky to
be around and take a look at them.

2271
02:11:10,351 --> 02:11:12,790
And for the most part, they're
fairly harmless. It's good.

2272
02:11:12,830 --> 02:11:14,630
You'd see him on a golf course.
It fairly harmless,

2273
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,920
but they don't fucking kill people every
now and then too, man. They kill dogs,

2274
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:20,990
you know, they, they
fuck up. And you know,

2275
02:11:21,020 --> 02:11:24,040
one guy was running from
the cops in Florida and he,

2276
02:11:24,041 --> 02:11:28,010
he ditched his car and jumped into the
water and as he jumped in the water,

2277
02:11:28,011 --> 02:11:31,760
the alligators attack them and ate them
right in front of the cops. Whoa. Yeah.

2278
02:11:32,270 --> 02:11:34,010
They just fucking ripped him apart.
They were right there.

2279
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:38,270
I think he just jumped and where he
jumped, there was alligators right there.

2280
02:11:38,420 --> 02:11:42,280
So as he hit the ground, I mean, they
might've done it just to like for defense,

2281
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:47,750
like what's he mean? He, he just
fucking pick the wrong spot to land.

2282
02:11:48,020 --> 02:11:50,970
And the alligators took 'em out right
in front of the cops. He was like, oh,

2283
02:11:50,971 --> 02:11:54,170
like I think he stole a car
or something like that. Yeah.

2284
02:11:54,260 --> 02:11:56,450
So obliterated him right
in front of the cops.

2285
02:11:56,451 --> 02:11:59,450
Like in Indiana Jones when the
guy falls. Yeah. Wow. Well,

2286
02:11:59,451 --> 02:12:04,250
crocodiles will hunt you.
That's the difference. What
does that mean? That's one,

2287
02:12:04,251 --> 02:12:07,250
but that's not the one
largest crocodile killed.

2288
02:12:07,251 --> 02:12:11,960
It's actual live crocodile skin. Where's
that? That doesn't look like nothing.

2289
02:12:11,961 --> 02:12:16,790
Go to go to Google images and they
have less people. They captured it.

2290
02:12:17,060 --> 02:12:21,300
What does the second one look at? The
size of that fucking thing. That's real,

2291
02:12:21,630 --> 02:12:25,110
but that's an alligator, I
believe. Is there a crocodile?
How many feet is it? Oh,

2292
02:12:25,111 --> 02:12:28,950
21 point 21 foot crocodile cheese.
It's Christ,

2293
02:12:29,070 --> 02:12:31,800
but that doesn't look like nothing
compared to the one with the villagers.

2294
02:12:31,980 --> 02:12:36,980
Just look up giant crock villagers on
Google images and you'll see this insane

2295
02:12:37,381 --> 02:12:41,760
fucking picture. It's these
people have it all like tied up.

2296
02:12:41,761 --> 02:12:43,140
I don't even know if it's dead yet.

2297
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:45,713
Yeah.

2298
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:47,910
And then what? It's just
massive. I can't wait to see it.

2299
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:49,343
Okay.

2300
02:12:50,920 --> 02:12:53,590
Yeah, that's it. Look at
the size of that thing.

2301
02:12:56,760 --> 02:12:59,850
These people were all gathered around
this. There's several pictures of it.

2302
02:12:59,970 --> 02:13:03,510
That's just one that got shot. The grown
adult wing spanning it. Oh yeah, yeah,

2303
02:13:03,720 --> 02:13:06,600
yeah. Wow. They're huge
man. They're huge. Wow.

2304
02:13:06,601 --> 02:13:08,550
He's barely on a little part of his back,
by the way.

2305
02:13:08,551 --> 02:13:12,910
All the people in these pictures
are so black. Yeah, I think there.

2306
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:16,690
That's the Philippines, I
think. Oh really? Yeah. I did
a bit of exposure on that.

2307
02:13:16,691 --> 02:13:19,620
I can't,
I'm not sure that this thing is massive.

2308
02:13:19,650 --> 02:13:22,260
There's a lot of places in the
world where if you live there, man,

2309
02:13:22,261 --> 02:13:24,780
you got to worry about sure. Much
meet with that provider. Those people,

2310
02:13:24,781 --> 02:13:28,020
I don't think they eat them. What? I
think they just fucking, I don't think,

2311
02:13:28,021 --> 02:13:31,410
what do you mean that the tiles?
I don't think he crocodiles easy.

2312
02:13:31,411 --> 02:13:31,980
That one right there,

2313
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,490
Brian. Right above your cursor. Click
on that. No, no, no. The other ones.

2314
02:13:35,780 --> 02:13:36,613
Okay.

2315
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:41,490
That one. Yeah. Click on that one.
Look at the size of that thing.

2316
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:45,570
Wow. It's on a damn.
Well, look at his legs.

2317
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:48,900
His legs are bigger than those people.
Yeah. The clock and I is bigger.

2318
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:51,570
The people fight over and look
at the guy right over the middle.

2319
02:13:51,690 --> 02:13:55,290
There's a perspective issue because
we're not sure how far those people were

2320
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:59,190
from way back. They could be back a little
bit to make the photo more impressive.

2321
02:13:59,220 --> 02:14:00,690
That's most likely how it is.

2322
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:03,480
Because if you look at the left
hand side where the mouth is open,

2323
02:14:03,481 --> 02:14:05,550
those people don't look like
they're under the mouth.

2324
02:14:05,910 --> 02:14:08,040
So if they're the same
size as those other people,

2325
02:14:08,041 --> 02:14:10,620
that means they're all behind it and
it makes it look more impressive,

2326
02:14:10,621 --> 02:14:14,280
but it is fucking huge. Whatever
it is. Okay. By the way,

2327
02:14:14,281 --> 02:14:15,990
those were around when dinosaurs were,

2328
02:14:15,991 --> 02:14:20,430
those are essentially living remnants
of the Jurassic. They get out of it.

2329
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,820
They just lived there just so bad
ass. They survive, survive the plate.

2330
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:28,530
They probably ate everybody that died.
You know, alligators could eat anything.

2331
02:14:28,531 --> 02:14:31,620
Crocodiles can eat anything. They
eat license plates. So eat your foot.

2332
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:35,940
We don't give a fuck. So the, the
idea is that if they did that,

2333
02:14:35,941 --> 02:14:39,270
if they just could eat anything, we've
got no animals out here. Really? Huh?

2334
02:14:39,300 --> 02:14:42,740
Or coyotes I guess. Okay. Mountain lions,
ma'am. Oh yeah. Out here. Those are,

2335
02:14:42,741 --> 02:14:47,190
those are legit. Yeah. I've been at,
uh, fascinated by Alaska shows. Man.

2336
02:14:47,191 --> 02:14:51,000
That's all I've been. Really. Yeah. All
I've been watching lately is Alaska shows.

2337
02:14:51,001 --> 02:14:53,250
I had a meeting recently
yet a discovery channel.

2338
02:14:53,590 --> 02:14:57,720
And we were talking about this show and
one of talking about Alaska show us for

2339
02:14:57,721 --> 02:15:01,350
like 10 minutes last cause awesome.
I'm obsessed with these Alaska shows.

2340
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:03,540
What are the Alaska,
they're subsistence shows.

2341
02:15:03,750 --> 02:15:06,690
It's all punched survive in
Alaska. Yeah. Living in Alaska.

2342
02:15:06,750 --> 02:15:09,540
And most of them they uh,
they hunt,

2343
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:15,090
they catch fish and they smoke the fish.
They grow their own vegetables and uh,

2344
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:19,500
they, you know, they have to fix
their Alaska, the wilderness. Oh Dude,

2345
02:15:19,530 --> 02:15:22,260
you just showed me this creek. They're
like, look at that creek. It's beautiful.

2346
02:15:22,261 --> 02:15:25,290
Like summertime's picturesque and it's
flowing down this mountain. She goes,

2347
02:15:25,291 --> 02:15:26,070
if you drank from that,

2348
02:15:26,070 --> 02:15:29,460
you'll get immediate medical attention
and you'll die within a day and a half.

2349
02:15:29,670 --> 02:15:29,971
Wow.

2350
02:15:29,971 --> 02:15:32,710
Like Montezuma's revenge
was just everything of his
shit and you can't stop it.

2351
02:15:32,711 --> 02:15:36,540
Lie what's in it? Badger Shit.
Whoa. Something like that.

2352
02:15:36,600 --> 02:15:40,170
Badger droppings and it makes it
completely, he said it tastes the same.

2353
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:43,910
Oh my God. Probably wasn't a day and
I probably like a few days, but like,

2354
02:15:43,950 --> 02:15:48,630
oh my God. Yeah. That's
terrifying. Badger Shit. Yeah,

2355
02:15:48,690 --> 02:15:50,340
that's all.
It's just a little bag of shit in there.

2356
02:15:50,340 --> 02:15:53,700
And it makes it still tastes refreshing.
Quenches your thirst.

2357
02:15:54,580 --> 02:15:57,390
You have to know about that stuff if you
go live there, right. Fuck yeah you do.

2358
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:00,840
Yeah. Fuck yeah. You did like
water. Okay. I'll put it in a glass.

2359
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:05,220
I could see right through it. Yeah. Good
badge or shit terminated. These shows.

2360
02:16:05,221 --> 02:16:07,380
They um,
like one of them,

2361
02:16:07,490 --> 02:16:12,420
a guy died well while filming himself
while they were filming him, he died.

2362
02:16:12,421 --> 02:16:15,630
He, while they're filming his village, he
was like one of the guys in the village,

2363
02:16:15,870 --> 02:16:20,640
he fell. He uh, they take the snowmobiles
out and they try, they crossed the river.

2364
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:21,840
The river is frozen,

2365
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:25,380
but sometimes they fall through into the
river and you're fucked. Fucking that.

2366
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:30,070
Yeah, because you're, you're going with
the current, like the, when you pole, you

2367
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:33,670
don't stay put you, you start going
down river and you're under the,

2368
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:37,720
you're going to have to swim your way
back to the hole and get back up all while

2369
02:16:37,721 --> 02:16:40,530
you're freezing and your muster
shutting down. Cause they're all still,

2370
02:16:40,690 --> 02:16:42,250
everything's shutting down.
You can't breathe.

2371
02:16:42,251 --> 02:16:46,120
You can't believe how much it constricts
your body's ability to utilize oxygen.

2372
02:16:46,330 --> 02:16:49,870
It's like immediate, like the cold
water. It's like a constrictor.

2373
02:16:49,871 --> 02:16:53,320
Everything tightens up. It's very
hard to survive. Amazed by that shit.

2374
02:16:53,321 --> 02:16:56,590
When you talk about your body and in
terms of like a machine or it just,

2375
02:16:56,591 --> 02:17:00,250
it does it to this and we can't
process oxygen. If you're too cold,

2376
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:04,000
that's what it is. Your body shuts down.
This is terrible feeling. We can't your,

2377
02:17:04,001 --> 02:17:07,750
your lungs like clamp down and even
though you're holding your breath like

2378
02:17:07,751 --> 02:17:10,430
you're fucked, you're like, oh my God,
I can't do this very long. Oh yeah.

2379
02:17:10,431 --> 02:17:12,370
There's all the oxygen
that you're holding onto.

2380
02:17:12,371 --> 02:17:14,650
It's going out of your system rapidly.

2381
02:17:14,651 --> 02:17:16,810
You can break the ice because
every time you break it,

2382
02:17:16,811 --> 02:17:19,440
you're going to have to just go, you're
not going to break the ice, you know?

2383
02:17:19,510 --> 02:17:21,820
No Way. No Way. You're going to
have to get back to that whole,

2384
02:17:21,940 --> 02:17:24,370
you're going to have to get out
of your time to start spotting.

2385
02:17:24,820 --> 02:17:27,970
He's not coming back. Wow. That's
what happens to those guys. Yeah.

2386
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:32,080
Some guys on the show had told similar
stories and said that they survived.

2387
02:17:32,081 --> 02:17:35,480
It's wait who died on the show? One of
the guys that was in [inaudible]. Yeah,

2388
02:17:35,680 --> 02:17:39,770
he was on the jet ski
or Snowmobile and uh,

2389
02:17:39,910 --> 02:17:42,910
he was doing this thing they do
when the ice is starting to thaw,

2390
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,970
they take chances and they go
across the river. They have to like,

2391
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,670
if they have like traps, did they
show that to show him, show him fall?

2392
02:17:49,670 --> 02:17:51,100
They weren't there. They
had, they showed them,

2393
02:17:51,101 --> 02:17:53,920
they showed everybody looking for him and
then everybody finding out that he was

2394
02:17:53,921 --> 02:17:56,350
dead. And then they
showed a, they have this,

2395
02:17:56,710 --> 02:18:00,130
what they do is they like life and
death is like so normal out there.

2396
02:18:00,310 --> 02:18:01,091
And these people,

2397
02:18:01,091 --> 02:18:04,750
they have like things that they do as a
community when someone dies because it

2398
02:18:04,751 --> 02:18:08,540
happened in ceremony. Ritual. Yeah.
It's called a potlatch and they, uh,

2399
02:18:08,550 --> 02:18:13,180
they're allowed to shoot a moose out of
season for this, this, uh, this ceremony.

2400
02:18:13,181 --> 02:18:15,440
Yeah. So this guy goes, yeah.

2401
02:18:15,490 --> 02:18:20,050
Even though it wasn't a hunting season
for Moose, he goes out, finds a moose,

2402
02:18:20,051 --> 02:18:23,050
shoots it, and that's like the law.
You're allowed to do that if someone dies.

2403
02:18:23,290 --> 02:18:25,600
And so they're getting back
and they cook Moose head soup.

2404
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:30,070
That's like the big thing that they
do for this. How it's fascinating man.

2405
02:18:30,370 --> 02:18:33,840
And these people that live there,
I mean technically they're supposed to be,

2406
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,890
that's supposed to be America technically,

2407
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:37,870
but it's clearly not American wilderness.
It's,

2408
02:18:37,890 --> 02:18:42,040
it's absolutely cons that were there.
Yes.

2409
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:44,440
It was all settled by people that were
like ex cons or running away from a

2410
02:18:44,441 --> 02:18:47,770
jealous boyfriend, shit like that.
Like I'll relocate to Alaska.

2411
02:18:48,100 --> 02:18:49,660
No one will find me or James Your name.

2412
02:18:49,720 --> 02:18:53,860
There's small towns that are in the middle
of nowhere that our homestead towns,

2413
02:18:53,890 --> 02:18:54,450
what does that mean?

2414
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:57,280
It means that people came there and
some of them from other countries,

2415
02:18:57,460 --> 02:19:00,300
they came there and they said,
let's try to to make any,

2416
02:19:00,301 --> 02:19:02,280
you're like one of the guys,
I believe their,

2417
02:19:02,310 --> 02:19:07,000
their family was from Sweden and they
were worried about the Nazis taking over

2418
02:19:07,001 --> 02:19:10,360
the world.
So they left Europe 80 years ago,

2419
02:19:10,390 --> 02:19:14,220
went to this place in Alaska and
started this homestead and they,

2420
02:19:14,250 --> 02:19:17,020
you know when you homestead out there
they give you like a certain amount of

2421
02:19:17,021 --> 02:19:21,520
acres and like I think yeah,

2422
02:19:21,550 --> 02:19:25,510
I think they were offering like land
to people. If you could live on it.

2423
02:19:25,511 --> 02:19:28,070
And they were trying to like get
people to, to live in certain

2424
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:32,510
areas and they, they did
that in Montana where, uh,

2425
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:34,130
we're Brian Cowen,
I went hunting.

2426
02:19:34,430 --> 02:19:37,100
There's a lot of these
really old homestead sites.

2427
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:40,340
We see these old broken
down frames of a house.

2428
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:45,050
And it's so fascinating because like
you're walking around inside of this old

2429
02:19:45,051 --> 02:19:48,680
broken down house and like this is where
someone decided they were going to try

2430
02:19:48,681 --> 02:19:52,880
to live part of the wilderness. Yep.
And there's no roof on it anymore.

2431
02:19:52,910 --> 02:19:57,350
It's completely fallen apart and it's
probably 300 years old, you know? Yeah.

2432
02:19:57,580 --> 02:20:01,580
I mean it's old as fuck that
places a strange, strange place.

2433
02:20:01,610 --> 02:20:05,790
No repairs onto it. Oh No, there's
nothing there. Well, there's a difference.

2434
02:20:05,791 --> 02:20:08,180
So what happens is people died
out or they all left the left.

2435
02:20:08,210 --> 02:20:10,190
There's different states of disrespect,
disrepair.

2436
02:20:10,220 --> 02:20:13,820
There's some of them that looked like,
you know,

2437
02:20:13,821 --> 02:20:16,370
if you put a little money until you
could actually turn it into a little log

2438
02:20:16,371 --> 02:20:18,860
house. And there's other ones
that are just nothing left.

2439
02:20:18,861 --> 02:20:21,470
But you're worried they're going to
follow that up around around you? No, no.

2440
02:20:21,471 --> 02:20:24,440
The wind, the one that I stepped into,
there was nothing left on the roof.

2441
02:20:24,441 --> 02:20:28,980
There's no roof left. Oh. So it was just
like some boards and some, some, uh,

2442
02:20:28,981 --> 02:20:33,410
it was obviously made out of logs that
they had a sound Nazi house out here

2443
02:20:33,411 --> 02:20:36,760
somewhere. It's a hike to it, but
it's what these people went to.

2444
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:41,240
It was like Americans like
left [inaudible] they assume
Hillary's going to win

2445
02:20:41,390 --> 02:20:44,120
really until they just went to wait until
it happens because they thought they

2446
02:20:44,121 --> 02:20:48,350
were gonna be too many reprisals. There's
like Nazi a lovers. Whoa. Until then,

2447
02:20:48,351 --> 02:20:50,750
so those, wait until Taylor takes
over and then eventually left.

2448
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:53,780
And so where are they now?
They're all gone. I don't know.

2449
02:20:53,781 --> 02:20:56,540
They came back to America.
There's an Indian place near here.

2450
02:20:56,600 --> 02:21:00,350
It's an Indian house. I think they
use it for like weddings and shit.

2451
02:21:00,660 --> 02:21:05,030
Like it's like a big, nice,
beautiful place. It's got
swastikas all over it really?

2452
02:21:05,031 --> 02:21:09,960
Yeah. Yeah. And we talked about
this yesterday apparently.
Is that sticky? No, no, no.

2453
02:21:10,210 --> 02:21:13,820
Nothing to do with the Nazis. It used to
be, it's like an ancient Hindu symbol.

2454
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:18,260
Oh yeah. Way, way, way, way back. I read
a book about what the swastika means.

2455
02:21:18,270 --> 02:21:22,100
Different cultures of good luck
and good things. Nazi's ruined it.

2456
02:21:22,640 --> 02:21:25,220
Plus they ruined that mustache option.
They've ruined it bad.

2457
02:21:25,250 --> 02:21:26,540
It's amazing that that,

2458
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:30,920
that one shitty dude could ruin Jordan's
doing this stash option. Sort of.

2459
02:21:30,921 --> 02:21:33,370
He's got a little goatee
going on, so really? Yeah,

2460
02:21:33,380 --> 02:21:36,470
but it also shows his arrogance that
he was trying to pull off the Hitler.

2461
02:21:36,560 --> 02:21:40,180
I can't like the area cool anymore. Well,
it's like someone said to him like, man,

2462
02:21:40,181 --> 02:21:41,800
you can't pull off the Hitler.
It was like, motherfucker,

2463
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:45,740
I can pull it might hit Jordan. I'm
like, well, why else would he want to?

2464
02:21:45,800 --> 02:21:48,980
He can't think that it looks good.
Anything you can do, I can do better.

2465
02:21:49,010 --> 02:21:51,110
People only thought that
looked good before photos.

2466
02:21:51,350 --> 02:21:53,450
Once photos came along and they
saw that mustache, they're like,

2467
02:21:53,451 --> 02:21:55,640
what the fuck am I doing?
Hitler?

2468
02:21:55,641 --> 02:21:59,820
That kind of the whole growth
further when and go further, judge,

2469
02:21:59,840 --> 02:22:04,200
see this shit your websites out? Oh, it's
up. So that's what it's all for sale.

2470
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:08,450
This is all the new website. This
is my new website. Yeah, it's uh,

2471
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:13,490
I got to send some videos to them,
but the meter put up here, there,

2472
02:22:16,430 --> 02:22:19,070
it was never really that. I see a lot
of people with your tee shirts at,

2473
02:22:19,100 --> 02:22:22,670
at my comedy shows. Yeah. A lot.
Cause Death Squad tee shirts.

2474
02:22:22,700 --> 02:22:26,070
There's tire primary t shirts.
He, the primary teachers who got

2475
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:30,510
this new one, the best design ever
one that uh, Mike Maxwell did.

2476
02:22:30,511 --> 02:22:34,740
It's fucking awesome. I
had a vision inside my tank
really to be told him and he,

2477
02:22:34,870 --> 02:22:38,040
I told someone he recreated it to a t.
It's perfect.

2478
02:22:38,690 --> 02:22:42,240
It's a monkey or a chimp rather.
And he's got two open palms.

2479
02:22:42,640 --> 02:22:47,390
One Palm is a floating home on the
other palm. The word home. No, no, no.

2480
02:22:47,391 --> 02:22:49,860
I'm like an and ancient Tibetan writing.

2481
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:54,750
The symbol of you ever seen the symbol
for home and the other hand has this um,

2482
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:56,550
uh,
the atomic symbol,

2483
02:22:56,551 --> 02:23:00,570
the symbol for atomic energy and he's
got his mouth open and there's a mushroom

2484
02:23:00,571 --> 02:23:03,450
on his tongue and his third eyes got like,

2485
02:23:04,230 --> 02:23:07,200
like geometric designs coming off.
It looks dope.

2486
02:23:07,500 --> 02:23:11,880
Mike Maxwell [inaudible]
that one is a red,

2487
02:23:12,120 --> 02:23:16,250
red and black or a white and black.
But uh,

2488
02:23:16,710 --> 02:23:21,240
I like it's one of those, is that the
color of the Monitor? That's pink?

2489
02:23:22,640 --> 02:23:23,630
Is that your monitor?

2490
02:23:23,631 --> 02:23:27,480
You got your fucking no colors
all out of whack on your mind. Oh,

2491
02:23:27,490 --> 02:23:29,820
like he wasn't doing that.
But did you do that on purpose?

2492
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:33,200
That would actually look cool and pink.

2493
02:23:33,260 --> 02:23:38,260
It's funny that one color became
like bad for completely color is not,

2494
02:23:38,601 --> 02:23:40,610
it's not like dolls or anything.
You could say we're like, no,

2495
02:23:40,611 --> 02:23:43,090
men just don't want to play with
those. It's a color, but like

2496
02:23:43,250 --> 02:23:45,920
yellow is probably more weak.

2497
02:23:45,980 --> 02:23:50,000
Like bright yellow is probably more
weak than, than pink, isn't it?

2498
02:23:50,310 --> 02:23:53,750
Like at least pink looks cool when
you mix it with black. It does.

2499
02:23:55,450 --> 02:23:57,500
I have picking my shirt.
What's wrong with pink?

2500
02:23:58,070 --> 02:24:01,150
Nothing should be wrong with it. Everybody
agreed. You know that pink layer,

2501
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:04,880
we all agree that pink corvette chick that
lives around here that I see, it's uh,

2502
02:24:05,030 --> 02:24:08,690
there's this girl that lives
in Los Angeles is not a
girl or [inaudible] name is

2503
02:24:08,710 --> 02:24:11,690
Angelina superfood that you've seen
around here. Just kind of crazy.

2504
02:24:11,691 --> 02:24:16,280
And which she used to do crazy take
out billboards. Yeah. And no one knew.

2505
02:24:16,281 --> 02:24:19,060
I mean this is when I first moved here
in 94. She had been doing it for decades.

2506
02:24:19,070 --> 02:24:20,780
So when I moved I was like,
what is this? But go ahead.

2507
02:24:20,870 --> 02:24:23,570
Nobody understood what it was like when
you first come. Here you go, what is this?

2508
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:26,210
When you see these billboards
and says Angelina on it,

2509
02:24:26,211 --> 02:24:27,950
it's her and she's very voluptuous.

2510
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:31,400
She's like, uh, you know, in front of
a car or something like that, you know,

2511
02:24:31,401 --> 02:24:34,900
in her underwear. And then it
says like management call and uh,

2512
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:38,810
you'll spot her around town
because she wears, you know,

2513
02:24:39,560 --> 02:24:44,380
she has a clothing paint,
white corvette and Angelina on the back.

2514
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:48,020
And what's crazy is that I see
her all the time and it's like,

2515
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:51,850
just shows you how small la is.
Even though it's big.

2516
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:53,770
I see her all the time.
Yeah,

2517
02:24:53,771 --> 02:24:57,010
I've seen her at least 10 times over the
[inaudible] driving by the same people

2518
02:24:57,011 --> 02:25:01,450
a lot. You don't notice,
right? Yeah, no shit.

2519
02:25:02,020 --> 02:25:05,990
Cause I see her. Did you see her and
took a picture of her? Is this, you know,

2520
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:10,310
this isn't me, but this is
a, she is old now. Oh yeah.

2521
02:25:10,420 --> 02:25:12,990
And she puts a picture of, she's running
for president. Right. Let me just hit it.

2522
02:25:13,470 --> 02:25:15,710
I was married.
I still hit it.

2523
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:18,840
I mean if you weren't married
Jesus to say you hit the corvette,

2524
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:21,050
I would break and she would die.
She would die for sure.

2525
02:25:22,020 --> 02:25:23,750
Do you want to go easy on her death?
You,

2526
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:26,590
it wouldn't even know what you're
saying. The doors, the likes.

2527
02:25:26,591 --> 02:25:29,770
I really don't even know what you're
saying. All right. Would you hit that?

2528
02:25:29,800 --> 02:25:34,150
What'd you hit that? Yeah. All right.
We're looking at that picture. Yeah,

2529
02:25:34,270 --> 02:25:36,040
that's not what I know what
she looks like up close.

2530
02:25:36,840 --> 02:25:39,820
You would have to be on ketamine.
There's no way you would fuck that.

2531
02:25:40,390 --> 02:25:45,190
She be supplying the ketamine. She's
Jakey grandmother and I'm not joking.

2532
02:25:45,790 --> 02:25:48,580
I bet she's a nice lady,
but she's a,

2533
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:52,420
she was old in 1990 when,
uh, when I first came here,

2534
02:25:52,510 --> 02:25:56,410
that was like this weird thing because
the photos didn't look anything like her.

2535
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:59,650
What if she's done any video she had?
What's, how does she make her money?

2536
02:25:59,651 --> 02:26:03,450
She married a rich dude.
Yeah.

2537
02:26:04,520 --> 02:26:07,180
That's a fucking 20 years old and
she looks 90. There's her dude.

2538
02:26:07,181 --> 02:26:11,380
I bet that is her. Wow. Is that really
an old picture of her? Is that legit?

2539
02:26:12,580 --> 02:26:17,500
Maybe it's just a fucking road. I
think I was just a pink corvette. Oh,

2540
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:22,090
okay. Yeah. I don't know what the
deal with her is, but uh, how bad,

2541
02:26:22,091 --> 02:26:24,390
she's a nice lady.
Someone's taking pictures with her

2542
02:26:25,900 --> 02:26:30,510
just with your thing.
Oh,

2543
02:26:31,380 --> 02:26:34,720
I see. I would, I mean, just for boobs
alone, I'd probably, okay though.

2544
02:26:34,750 --> 02:26:37,830
Imagine if that girl imagine.
Okay, the way. Move Up. Move Up.

2545
02:26:38,820 --> 02:26:42,940
That's your vagina coming out. Brian
started leaking out vagina. No,

2546
02:26:43,330 --> 02:26:48,280
go back down to catches. That's a vagina
coming out and down. No, that's, yes.

2547
02:26:48,850 --> 02:26:52,670
That's below the skirt line where
it's too close. Where it's happening.

2548
02:26:55,590 --> 02:26:59,870
Yeah. You know what? Have some respect
for this old lady. Why Zoom in our snatch?

2549
02:26:59,871 --> 02:27:01,610
He looks pretty cute. Yeah, but

2550
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:06,520
this is not really what she looks
like. She's a nice old lady, I'm sure.

2551
02:27:06,521 --> 02:27:11,230
But you know the,
the the sexy image not aging gracefully.

2552
02:27:11,260 --> 02:27:16,120
Yeah. That's sexy. Image is, it becomes
a monstrous. That's what's weird.

2553
02:27:16,150 --> 02:27:20,260
It's amazing. Yeah. Like there she
is like look, this is like a really,

2554
02:27:20,800 --> 02:27:22,840
that's sounds like something,
he's an elderly lady.

2555
02:27:22,890 --> 02:27:25,570
That's what I was telling a joke or
were due to you make it look like that.

2556
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:29,080
I look at his legs. That's nice legs for
an old lady. When her body looks great,

2557
02:27:29,081 --> 02:27:31,780
if she would cut down on
the silicone in her breasts.

2558
02:27:31,781 --> 02:27:35,190
She's proud to be a lot better luck than
oil that turn off the lights a little

2559
02:27:35,220 --> 02:27:37,390
like a certain look that
you can only pull off.

2560
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,720
You know when you're so her rich
husband just lets her just wanting,

2561
02:27:40,721 --> 02:27:44,310
I don't pay for billboards. I'm just
making shit up husband. Why are you sad?

2562
02:27:44,320 --> 02:27:47,140
That's what I heard that tried to crash
that party. Does she make money off?

2563
02:27:47,141 --> 02:27:51,620
That was the rumor. The rumor was
that her husband had a, it was a,

2564
02:27:51,630 --> 02:27:55,060
but it's like she's like an la,
an La celebrity.

2565
02:27:55,110 --> 02:27:58,030
I can tell you where they live at.
Tito's Tacos like dentists were roof.

2566
02:27:58,540 --> 02:28:03,190
What are you talking about? Tito's
Tacos. It's another La commercial thing.

2567
02:28:03,730 --> 02:28:08,060
I have no idea what that is.
You love to hear those two key on there.

2568
02:28:08,270 --> 02:28:11,650
We're watching late night TV. You always
had cable, Huh? Yeah, I always had cable.

2569
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:15,940
Tito's Tacos. Tito's Tacos.
He has key from Van Nuys.

2570
02:28:16,030 --> 02:28:20,620
I like Tito's Tacos for folks who
don't know what Brian's talking about.

2571
02:28:20,621 --> 02:28:25,621
That's like one of the most famous
places he's auto dealership.

2572
02:28:28,270 --> 02:28:31,670
When I was a kid in New York, it was
crazy. Eddie, do you remember crazy?

2573
02:28:31,671 --> 02:28:35,890
Eddie crazy? Eddie has prices
are insane. Crazy Gideon blog.

2574
02:28:35,891 --> 02:28:38,580
There's a bunch of crazy guys,
but crazy. Eddie was really,

2575
02:28:38,750 --> 02:28:43,740
his prices are insane and crazy.
Eddie wound up having to go to, um,

2576
02:28:44,210 --> 02:28:48,470
I think he went to Israel. That was
crazy. Gideon. Crazy. Eddie did too.

2577
02:28:48,471 --> 02:28:51,500
Dude or crazy and he went to
jail. Let's see. Cause he had,

2578
02:28:51,501 --> 02:28:55,180
he didn't benefit from being part of
the Jewish people so he couldn't leave.

2579
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,630
And it was crazy Gideon from,
I thought he was in New York to here.

2580
02:28:58,700 --> 02:29:01,010
I know knowing of these crazy
guys I don't hang out with.

2581
02:29:01,110 --> 02:29:05,240
Well it was like they were the famous
guys back in the days that were selling

2582
02:29:05,241 --> 02:29:09,650
like, like TV's and shit.
That's how they got famous.

2583
02:29:09,651 --> 02:29:13,550
I always want you to pay cash.
Like there was a furniture company,

2584
02:29:13,640 --> 02:29:17,650
two brothers, um, in Boston
and they were the, uh,

2585
02:29:17,740 --> 02:29:20,030
they were like famous.
I remember somebody that,

2586
02:29:20,031 --> 02:29:23,690
one of my sister's friends because of
the commercial new one of the kids and it

2587
02:29:23,691 --> 02:29:25,070
was like a big deal. Like, Oh,

2588
02:29:25,071 --> 02:29:27,370
her dad is that guy from the
fucking furniture commercial.

2589
02:29:27,650 --> 02:29:31,280
And like everybody was all excited at
this dude from the furniture commercial

2590
02:29:31,460 --> 02:29:35,480
was a, you know, like his kid was
like in the neighborhood. Like what?

2591
02:29:35,481 --> 02:29:38,450
He's only on a commercial cause he
paid for commercial talk. Exactly.

2592
02:29:38,451 --> 02:29:42,170
But they became, yeah.
Okay. Founder of crazy.

2593
02:29:42,171 --> 02:29:47,110
Eddie gets eight years in prison
and big fine. Really? Yeah,

2594
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:48,000
he's from,
uh,

2595
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:52,260
he's actually from 1971
so it wasn't for what?

2596
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:57,770
I think 1971. It's probably, he
probably predates crazy Gideon. Oh yeah.

2597
02:29:57,780 --> 02:30:02,360
Crazy. Gideon's around now. Oh yeah.
That's crazy. Gideon is a fucking hack.

2598
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:07,700
Yeah. He probably sold everything from
crazy Yeti. He falsified the chains books.

2599
02:30:07,701 --> 02:30:08,640
He falsified the,

2600
02:30:08,641 --> 02:30:12,200
the businesses books and he fleed
the country to avoid prosecution.

2601
02:30:12,500 --> 02:30:14,180
Which one was this crazy.

2602
02:30:14,181 --> 02:30:17,510
Eddie at the prices are insane.

2603
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:21,800
In November of 1987 crazy
Eddie stockholders took over
the chain and discovered

2604
02:30:21,801 --> 02:30:25,200
a $45 million inventory shortage.
What?

2605
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:26,990
The chain never recovered.

2606
02:30:27,320 --> 02:30:32,320
That dude must have been [inaudible]
$45 million out of the company town.

2607
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:34,860
Something.
God

2608
02:30:39,320 --> 02:30:41,750
never heard of it. You know, he didn't
play the, I don't want to hear it.

2609
02:30:41,780 --> 02:30:44,710
I don't want to hear him. Stop. Look at
this commercial though. That just the, uh,

2610
02:30:45,410 --> 02:30:50,390
Tito's Tacos class. Yeah.
It's the funniest shit ever
loose. I got a hot check.

2611
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:54,930
He was that guy.
It's like Douche bags.

2612
02:30:54,990 --> 02:30:59,350
He's there just dated Culver city.
That's right.

2613
02:30:59,410 --> 02:31:02,530
They have the twin douchebag dudes.
What's that message?

2614
02:31:03,260 --> 02:31:07,190
Echo things out because it's more
relaxing now. It's so weird. Stupid stuff.

2615
02:31:07,191 --> 02:31:11,960
Doing that son of a bitch. It makes it
unique. So crazy. Gideon is like a new,

2616
02:31:12,090 --> 02:31:16,040
see what his deal was. Eddie flipped
as a where to Eddie fleet too.

2617
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:20,190
He fleed to Jerusalem and
we did know cage good.

2618
02:31:20,190 --> 02:31:23,600
The own. I wonder if the
crazy getting was, it was a,

2619
02:31:23,620 --> 02:31:28,530
just a figment of the board's imagination.
Gideon's closed in downtown La.

2620
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:34,110
Maybe just went out of business. Did he
die? I don't know. Trying to find out.

2621
02:31:34,190 --> 02:31:38,970
Does it give you on, I'll give you the
best prices. [inaudible] TV. I crazy.

2622
02:31:39,150 --> 02:31:43,050
How do you spell Gideon? Gee, I. D. E.
O. N. Yeah. That's how I spelled it.

2623
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:47,880
Just as crazy Gideon's closed. It
doesn't say anything about him. Crazy.

2624
02:31:47,881 --> 02:31:51,360
Gideon is crazy. Oh, okay. He
went to jail for tax evasion.

2625
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:56,130
That's hilarious. They always ask you
to only pay cash. That's hilarious.

2626
02:31:56,310 --> 02:31:59,970
And Gideon's a Jewish name. Yeah. He, uh,

2627
02:32:00,120 --> 02:32:04,380
he followed any of that God's footsteps
completely. Yeah, pretty much, man.

2628
02:32:05,220 --> 02:32:07,860
Wow.
Talking about blazing a trail.

2629
02:32:08,570 --> 02:32:09,403
Yeah.

2630
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:15,290
Embraces insanity and turn
it on to an advertising ploy.

2631
02:32:15,500 --> 02:32:20,150
This is a real commercial that aired on
local television and Gideon is a role

2632
02:32:20,151 --> 02:32:24,890
model for us all. Uh, okay. I don't
know what they're trying to say.

2633
02:32:25,210 --> 02:32:27,530
It was trying to talk too
much about the video is yeah,

2634
02:32:27,531 --> 02:32:29,480
I don't know what the fuck that some,

2635
02:32:30,350 --> 02:32:33,980
some takes on this are saying that it
might be actually they're talking about

2636
02:32:33,981 --> 02:32:36,410
crazy Eddie.
Oh really?

2637
02:32:36,930 --> 02:32:40,790
Crazy. Eddie went to jail for um,
that wasn't tax evasion. What was he?

2638
02:32:40,820 --> 02:32:44,140
I believe the murder or please say
murder, please say no. No, no. Crazy.

2639
02:32:44,141 --> 02:32:47,950
Eddie was the one who stole
the 43 million or so high.

2640
02:32:47,951 --> 02:32:51,250
You don't remember shit we were talking
about. That was a four minute ago.

2641
02:32:51,460 --> 02:32:52,930
That was like at least a full minute.

2642
02:32:53,320 --> 02:32:55,840
I can tell you the same story three or
four times in a row before he got mad at

2643
02:32:55,841 --> 02:32:56,920
me right now.
It's a story about,

2644
02:32:59,810 --> 02:33:03,470
uh, okay. TMZ says he's out crazy.

2645
02:33:03,471 --> 02:33:06,650
Eddie TMZ has a crazy Gideon video.

2646
02:33:07,490 --> 02:33:09,830
How crazy is crazy Gideon
as he worth listening to?

2647
02:33:09,920 --> 02:33:13,390
Maybe he's looks sort of
Weirdo. No, probably not.

2648
02:33:14,570 --> 02:33:16,700
Legendary television salesmen.

2649
02:33:16,701 --> 02:33:21,701
Crazy Gideon is back and
still packing so much crazy.

2650
02:33:22,700 --> 02:33:27,650
He inspired a brand new, poorly
dressed, loud mouth pitch, man.

2651
02:33:28,740 --> 02:33:32,700
Huh? Let's not him. I don't know. I've
got Brian to be, as I say, guy new,

2652
02:33:32,701 --> 02:33:33,534
pitch them in to do it.

2653
02:33:33,770 --> 02:33:36,230
I don't understand what the fuck they're
saying and I'm not willing to click

2654
02:33:36,231 --> 02:33:39,850
their links. Sons of bitches. You
led me on a more electronic salesman.

2655
02:33:40,100 --> 02:33:42,260
Why don't even know their names.
Unsatisfied

2656
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:45,230
buying. Why? Well,
because back in the day,

2657
02:33:45,410 --> 02:33:48,650
that was like a good way to get
someone to go to your place.

2658
02:33:48,770 --> 02:33:52,970
Can you make yourself a celebrities
on van eyes? Just that you know,

2659
02:33:52,971 --> 02:33:56,420
having something that was like a good
jingle. That shit's important. Oh yeah.

2660
02:33:56,820 --> 02:34:01,170
How many good jangles we should have a
jingle. Brian, what would our jingle be?

2661
02:34:01,700 --> 02:34:02,820
Oh God,

2662
02:34:03,540 --> 02:34:06,780
no. That's your jingle. You've
got, hold on. What's your
deal with the olive garden?

2663
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:09,020
What's, where's this all come
from and make it a hit song? No.

2664
02:34:09,090 --> 02:34:11,430
Where does the thing, with the
exception of obsession with this play,

2665
02:34:11,460 --> 02:34:13,650
are you trying to question
and what you know is broken?

2666
02:34:14,480 --> 02:34:17,560
Why are you looking at the glass and
say in class, why are you broken?

2667
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:22,870
Why are you doing that? You know,
that's just his thing, man. Yeah,

2668
02:34:23,110 --> 02:34:27,400
you got to accept to dude, Sarah came
out of nowhere. Black chicks. He's, look,

2669
02:34:27,401 --> 02:34:28,660
he's a mess obviously,

2670
02:34:29,260 --> 02:34:34,260
but that mess lends itself to
create things and that aren't funny.

2671
02:34:34,541 --> 02:34:38,380
But when you say them a million times,
they suddenly become funny. But why?

2672
02:34:38,440 --> 02:34:42,040
Why Olive Garden? Whatever.
Why not do you get,

2673
02:34:42,050 --> 02:34:46,270
it could be anything. It could be
anything. It could be converse. All stars,

2674
02:34:46,630 --> 02:34:49,840
converse, all stars could be the
number one sneaker for death squad.

2675
02:34:50,080 --> 02:34:53,740
We could all decide that converse
all stars or red talk about converse.

2676
02:34:53,741 --> 02:34:56,420
All stars constantly.
And this motherfucker will bring up Kai.

2677
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:58,810
Did you get there and your converse
all stars. That's what he would do.

2678
02:34:59,020 --> 02:35:03,430
He would do that until my wife,
my head explode because he's crazy.

2679
02:35:04,270 --> 02:35:08,500
That's just crazy. Got his crazy.
You got your crazy. I got mine.

2680
02:35:11,410 --> 02:35:15,550
I ask why? Why s why Joey Diaz
gets mad about mayonnaise. Yeah.

2681
02:35:15,930 --> 02:35:18,880
Try try to give him ranch dressing,
you know, kick you in the dig.

2682
02:35:19,450 --> 02:35:23,710
I've seen so many of those t shirts at
that shows it's blue cheese with wings or

2683
02:35:23,711 --> 02:35:24,544
go fuck your mother.

2684
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:29,230
He went and sold t shirts and said that
blue cheese like go fuck your mother

2685
02:35:29,231 --> 02:35:32,620
responsible for two of the greatest
quotes in human history. Fuck Shakespeare.

2686
02:35:33,310 --> 02:35:36,480
If you ain't high by two 8:02 PM,
go fuck yourself. I like that.

2687
02:35:36,481 --> 02:35:38,980
That where that comes from.
Just an overall feeling.

2688
02:35:39,140 --> 02:35:43,630
People looking at you negatively
and just turning around. No, fuck.

2689
02:35:43,631 --> 02:35:47,050
You die by two in the afternoon.
You're the file itself.

2690
02:35:47,750 --> 02:35:51,260
That olive garden's song is
actually a German band. Uh,

2691
02:35:51,310 --> 02:35:55,110
covered it and remade it and
sold it on a CD. All of Germany,

2692
02:35:55,870 --> 02:35:57,100
but funnel what?

2693
02:35:57,101 --> 02:36:00,880
Olive Garden's song that the Olive
Garden Song I wrote and then they read.

2694
02:36:01,030 --> 02:36:03,640
I didn't know you wrote an
olive oil. Yeah, it's huge.

2695
02:36:03,641 --> 02:36:05,220
I don't want to hear about it.
It's not huge right now.

2696
02:36:05,230 --> 02:36:06,440
Listen to the German stop it.

2697
02:36:06,630 --> 02:36:10,360
No [inaudible] little bit German
band singing about olive garden.

2698
02:36:10,810 --> 02:36:12,250
They recovered my song.

2699
02:36:14,870 --> 02:36:19,160
It's crazy. It's like all heavy
metal rock. Do you know the band?

2700
02:36:19,790 --> 02:36:22,910
Yeah, I think it. They ask permission to
sell the song and I'm like, Oh yeah, sure.

2701
02:36:23,090 --> 02:36:25,920
Totally bought us. Hilarious.
You can be like David,

2702
02:36:30,120 --> 02:36:30,953
you can hear me in it

2703
02:36:48,200 --> 02:36:49,033
when

2704
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:57,160
you can hear the garden
here. Yeah. It's too hard to

2705
02:36:57,240 --> 02:37:02,010
say when he's saying,
but funnels the name German band.

2706
02:37:02,130 --> 02:37:03,420
I'm sure that guy is not crazy.

2707
02:37:03,750 --> 02:37:08,460
It's not like he has a real doll with
your face tape to it that he fucks

2708
02:37:08,461 --> 02:37:11,220
violently every night. Here's
what they look like. Look at this.

2709
02:37:12,330 --> 02:37:16,300
This is the band red band on,
but funnel these.

2710
02:37:16,320 --> 02:37:17,760
This is the band that does not look like.

2711
02:37:17,761 --> 02:37:20,990
I look at this guy on the right it
looks like. Wow. Well listen folks,

guys to move on with your life.

2714
02:37:28,070 --> 02:37:32,870
Are Those real people? That's my funnel.
Does that thing not loose? Is that loose?

You can't figure it out. You don't
know what the fuck is this one? Yeah,

2720
02:37:52,040 --> 02:37:52,873

F I r, early ants in the background.
You know what? That is false.

2724
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:11,270
That's Ari's old CD.

2725
02:38:11,660 --> 02:38:15,080
It's new, but it's old because
he's already taping a new one.

2726
02:38:15,081 --> 02:38:18,650
You fucking freaks and you should be

2727
02:38:18,930 --> 02:38:22,840
Flat out like, Hey guys,

28th, December 28th. Where's it at again?

2729
02:38:27,770 --> 02:38:29,390
The knitting factory in
Brooklyn and Brooklyn.

2730
02:38:29,480 --> 02:38:32,900
And you get street credit for doing it
in Brooklyn. That went through my mind.

2731
02:38:32,901 --> 02:38:36,110
Street cred. I'm just looking for a
name. Yeah, that's a good way to do it.

2732
02:38:36,190 --> 02:38:41,090
You are a name now? No, no, no. I'm
looking for a name of it, what does it,

2733
02:38:41,470 --> 02:38:42,560
but on that subject,

2734
02:38:42,590 --> 02:38:46,340
it is kind of strange that you went from
being a guy who had a hard time getting

2735
02:38:46,341 --> 02:38:51,341
booked to a guy who's not just headlining
but selling out clubs all over the

2736
02:38:51,621 --> 02:38:55,700
place, all over the country and in
Canada. And it happened like of that,

2737
02:38:56,060 --> 02:38:58,850
the guy who worked with in
a, in Minnesota, it was like,
oh, it's good. You know,

2738
02:38:58,851 --> 02:39:01,860
you get booked somewhere. It's a future.
Like I hope it's not just some like, uh,

2739
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:05,120
yeah, it's nice that you can draw
people. And I'm like, Oh yeah,

2740
02:39:05,121 --> 02:39:06,620
we're going to have to come. Yeah. Like

2741
02:39:08,150 --> 02:39:11,840
instantly you went from that terrible
spot where you can't get booked and you're

2742
02:39:11,841 --> 02:39:14,840
trying to take shitty gigs because you
need to work and you know, you really,

2743
02:39:14,841 --> 02:39:17,930
it's really unsatisfying.
It's like that I couldn't even take gigs.

2744
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:20,090
There were no gigs to take tomatoes.
I was like,

2745
02:39:20,091 --> 02:39:21,970
I'll go for whatever the
little you want to pay me,

2746
02:39:22,460 --> 02:39:24,590
just let me perform at your place.
Yeah.

2747
02:39:24,591 --> 02:39:28,160
And it's all just because already really
kind of stuck to his guns with like the

2748
02:39:28,161 --> 02:39:30,530
kind of material that he likes
and that kind of material.

2749
02:39:30,531 --> 02:39:33,800
You fucking can't get on TV with
it. So it's, it's, it's hard.

2750
02:39:33,890 --> 02:39:35,180
It's hard for you to get those credits.

2751
02:39:35,370 --> 02:39:39,650
It's hard to get that my mind a while ago.
Yeah. It's almost like it's impossible.

2752
02:39:39,860 --> 02:39:40,693
It's,
it's,

2753
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:45,050
and what people don't
understand is there's a real
stigma attached in the world

2754
02:39:45,051 --> 02:39:48,410
of standup comedy to like
dirty acts and dirty jokes.

2755
02:39:48,411 --> 02:39:51,250
It's like you're thought to be
like a lesser version of it.

2756
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:53,920
Do you think it's because
you can't get onto these,

2757
02:39:53,930 --> 02:39:57,710
they have to justify why or why you
get around when it was, is that, yeah.

2758
02:39:57,711 --> 02:39:59,180
If you were trying to get on television,

2759
02:39:59,181 --> 02:40:01,340
like say if you were trying to do it
tonight, show set, but all your, yeah,

2760
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:05,040
just jokes about cut farts. You're,
you're not going to get off. You can,

2761
02:40:05,041 --> 02:40:08,200
I mean you, you might be able
to kill at the, you know, the,

2762
02:40:08,210 --> 02:40:12,470
the Framingham Howard Johnson's know
whatever the fuck has a comedy residence

2763
02:40:12,471 --> 02:40:14,010
inn. Yeah. But what you're not

2764
02:40:14,010 --> 02:40:16,140
going to do is you're not going to get
on the tonight show would can't fart

2765
02:40:16,141 --> 02:40:19,920
jokes. So those guys all wanted
to get on a tonight show.

2766
02:40:20,100 --> 02:40:24,710
Everybody wanted to do what happened to
Steven Steven right before Steven riding

2767
02:40:24,711 --> 02:40:29,340
in. There's a great documentary on it by
this guy, France Sala Meta and it's um,

2768
02:40:29,790 --> 02:40:33,870
it's about, uh, Boston comedy and
it's um, dammit. I should, uh,

2769
02:40:33,980 --> 02:40:38,220
I should Google this friend's solemn Meta.
I forget the name of it,

2770
02:40:38,221 --> 02:40:39,740
but it's all about,
uh,

2771
02:40:39,960 --> 02:40:44,580
what is it about Boston and
how it changed how the scene,

2772
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:48,840
how the scene change after Steven Wright
got on television because then the

2773
02:40:48,841 --> 02:40:52,620
value is placed on being able to do the
stuff that you'd get on TV. Yeah, exactly.

2774
02:40:52,621 --> 02:40:56,340
So they're a lot more like one
liner comics after that. Um, no,

2775
02:40:56,341 --> 02:40:59,490
it's like guys tried to clean it up a
lot because they saw that if he got on

2776
02:40:59,491 --> 02:41:03,000
some night show, he got success. Oh, I can
get on the tonight show. Yeah, success.

2777
02:41:03,330 --> 02:41:04,260
That was the,

2778
02:41:05,070 --> 02:41:10,070
that was the whatever the catalyst know
to success was you had to get on the

2779
02:41:11,311 --> 02:41:14,310
tonight show back then. So, uh, that's
what everybody was trying to do.

2780
02:41:14,311 --> 02:41:17,100
So when I started doing stand up,

2781
02:41:17,530 --> 02:41:22,170
it was already when people
had found out about the,

2782
02:41:22,200 --> 02:41:22,591
you know,

2783
02:41:22,591 --> 02:41:27,170
the possibility of becoming famous because
Steven Wright was famous like stint

2784
02:41:27,171 --> 02:41:31,650
when stand up. Sit Out. That's the name of
it. Steven Wright was, it's really good.

2785
02:41:31,770 --> 02:41:34,340
It's really good. It's
a brilliant piece. Um,

2786
02:41:34,440 --> 02:41:38,040
Steven Wright was the first guy to go
from the tonight show. Like he was huge.

2787
02:41:38,041 --> 02:41:41,910
All of a sudden, like he did, like they
saw him and they were like, Holy Shit.

2788
02:41:41,911 --> 02:41:44,440
Is this guy good?
And from being on television,

2789
02:41:44,441 --> 02:41:45,940
they're like completely
turned whatever it was.

2790
02:41:46,140 --> 02:41:48,240
It was Letterman or to the sign shop,
whatever it was.

2791
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:50,550
They completely transformed
this guy's life.

2792
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:53,250
And so all these other guys that
were in town, they saw that too.

2793
02:41:53,251 --> 02:41:57,840
And they definitely saw, started
doing comedy that leaned towards that.

2794
02:41:58,470 --> 02:42:02,130
The problem was like if you're
not doing that kind of comedy,

2795
02:42:02,160 --> 02:42:05,670
you don't have a lot of options because
that's all that's on television and

2796
02:42:05,671 --> 02:42:10,671
people think that it's clever because you
do have to think more because you have

2797
02:42:11,011 --> 02:42:14,910
to avoid certain areas and subjects,
but it's not more clever.

2798
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:17,870
It's just less funny.
You know? Oftentimes the,

2799
02:42:17,940 --> 02:42:22,940
the idea that you're only doing this
because these corporations want you to,

2800
02:42:23,100 --> 02:42:26,040
that's not the way you would naturally
tell jokes if you want it to. Yeah,

2801
02:42:26,041 --> 02:42:28,590
exactly. The rules on you and
you're not doing what you would do.

2802
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:31,620
I always loved that you did that,
man. You really never fucking,

2803
02:42:31,621 --> 02:42:33,910
and the one time you got to television,
you pulled you dick out.

2804
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:38,400
They told you don't pull your dick
out and you're like, Yup, okay.

2805
02:42:38,990 --> 02:42:40,990
You just let me know where,
where am I standing?

2806
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,050
The Andrew said it was
just don't get naked.

2807
02:42:43,051 --> 02:42:46,260
And then the light bulb went off
in my house and that was perfect.

2808
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:48,990
It's perfect because it was
fun as a lot of it dirty.

2809
02:42:48,991 --> 02:42:52,500
I went further than I was because it was
funny and it's funny and you pull your

2810
02:42:52,501 --> 02:42:55,500
Dick out. What's funny and what's Your
Dick? What do they kind of let it,

2811
02:42:55,501 --> 02:42:59,280
let it come on and we really, well,
we were little children, man. We're,

2812
02:42:59,281 --> 02:43:01,470
we're little children.
A grown man can't pull his dick out.

2813
02:43:01,530 --> 02:43:04,170
Who were you watching this with?
If you're watching it with your wife,

2814
02:43:04,171 --> 02:43:06,210
are you truly offended by
this guy pulling his dick out?

2815
02:43:06,211 --> 02:43:07,440
You can't just laugh at that.

2816
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:10,950
When it comes at midnight on a Friday
on an HBO and after Jim Norton's been

2817
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:14,290
about trainees for an hour and a half
that you really freaking out because this

2818
02:43:14,291 --> 02:43:18,730
guy pulls his dick out. Dick cyst.
But I love the fact that you,

2819
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:23,020
you stood up for logic, you
know, your entire career.

2820
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:24,340
He never really gave in.

2821
02:43:24,550 --> 02:43:25,031
I'm telling you,

2822
02:43:25,031 --> 02:43:28,060
I saw you this one time at that I
thought voting place in Rhode Island.

2823
02:43:28,900 --> 02:43:31,090
It set it, set it free a little
bit with that guy was like,

2824
02:43:31,091 --> 02:43:32,210
do you remember that we,

2825
02:43:32,250 --> 02:43:35,520
we took a trip to chicken and then to
Rhode Island chicken. It was horrible.

2826
02:43:36,390 --> 02:43:37,920
Just horrible,
horrible people.

2827
02:43:38,650 --> 02:43:41,230
Um,
but the Rhode Island that we get out,

2828
02:43:41,240 --> 02:43:44,330
we're walking to this big yachting club
and he goes, just so you know, the,

2829
02:43:44,331 --> 02:43:45,970
the crowd's a little
more conservative here,

2830
02:43:45,971 --> 02:43:48,480
so you might wanna try to keep it clean
a little bit. And he didn't even get,

2831
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:52,090
he just said like that's how far
he got. And you were just like, no.

2832
02:43:52,360 --> 02:43:56,770
And then just turn right back and kept
walking. Like, just get off me nat. Yeah.

2833
02:43:56,870 --> 02:44:00,920
No silly man. Whoever you are, I don't
know who you are, but you didn't,

2834
02:44:00,970 --> 02:44:04,160
you don't get to having creative
control over what goes on up there.

2835
02:44:04,430 --> 02:44:06,560
Those people, they don't see me.
I know what I'd do. Exactly. Yeah.

2836
02:44:06,561 --> 02:44:08,870
That's what it was. But it's like, oh,
you know what you're doing here. Yeah.

2837
02:44:09,140 --> 02:44:11,870
Silly Bitch. They, they
didn't really apply to you.

2838
02:44:12,170 --> 02:44:14,440
They didn't go to that show because they
didn't know what was going to happen.

2839
02:44:14,630 --> 02:44:18,330
They went to that show because they
knew what I was doing, getting offended.

2840
02:44:18,331 --> 02:44:21,330
So what, they live in a nice neighborhood.
I live in a nice neighborhood too.

2841
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:26,060
So a blow job when they were in high
school and by the time [inaudible] we

2842
02:44:26,061 --> 02:44:27,320
almost had a time.
So that was going on.

2843
02:44:27,590 --> 02:44:30,170
By the time Diaz went
up the all the fucking,

2844
02:44:30,200 --> 02:44:33,650
they'll taboos have been
crushed like grapes anyway.

2845
02:44:33,670 --> 02:44:37,460
Like that guy had to like hope and
pray that I wasn't as dirty as Diaz.

2846
02:44:37,970 --> 02:44:39,770
Diaz didn't.
He didn't slow down either,

2847
02:44:39,771 --> 02:44:41,450
but we were blue balls
and you're like fuck you,

2848
02:44:41,451 --> 02:44:43,790
this is one night and Rhode Island,
listen dude,

2849
02:44:43,791 --> 02:44:45,890
we're going to go over here either way.
And it was great.

2850
02:44:45,891 --> 02:44:49,460
It was one of the most fun shows ever.
It was in an outside wall tent area.

2851
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:51,230
So your um,
your,

2852
02:44:51,231 --> 02:44:54,830
your CD that people can still buy or
your comedy last comedy special that can

2853
02:44:54,831 --> 02:44:59,750
still buy it. It's on Amazon.
It's on iTunes for the Holocaust,

2854
02:45:00,050 --> 02:45:01,940
the Holocaust.
It's fucking hilarious.

2855
02:45:01,941 --> 02:45:05,900
And you could see him December 18th or
20th December 28th don't go December

2856
02:45:05,901 --> 02:45:06,051
eight.

2857
02:45:06,051 --> 02:45:08,900
So I'll go to seminary because then you'll
have to camp out for 10 days and that

2858
02:45:08,910 --> 02:45:11,210
was such a small place. Everybody
gets tickets. It's cheaper.

2859
02:45:11,211 --> 02:45:15,950
If you get them like a few, like
this pod cast is over. You Dirty Fox,

2860
02:45:16,100 --> 02:45:18,920
please.
If you're interested in brain nutrition,

2861
02:45:18,950 --> 02:45:21,230
go to [inaudible] dot com
and get your freak out.

2862
02:45:21,350 --> 02:45:24,350
Plus you can get kettlebells like those
one on the ground right in front of feet.

2863
02:45:24,590 --> 02:45:28,160
I sling those bitches, son.
Yeah, that's a manly as fuck.

2864
02:45:28,310 --> 02:45:32,360
I can't remember the battle. Ropes did
some battle rope. My man, Justin, Milos,

2865
02:45:32,361 --> 02:45:35,870
my new trainer took me through some
battle ropes workout this week.

2866
02:45:36,350 --> 02:45:39,790
I'm out of shape son. I got to get
another series shape. I'm working hard.

2867
02:45:39,830 --> 02:45:42,260
Me and are you this special
