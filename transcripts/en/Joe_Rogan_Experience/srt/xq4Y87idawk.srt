1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,200
Bor.

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,180
All right,
we'll live Brett.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,350
First of all,
thanks for doing this.

4
00:00:08,351 --> 00:00:09,130
Appreciate it,
man.

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:09,920
All right,
glad to be here.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,790
He looked great.
Despite all this pressure you're smiling

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,983
is,
uh,

8
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,873
uh,
for people that don't know what's going 

9
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,960
on,
let's lay out all of,

10
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,900
uh,
all the events that have transpired.

11
00:00:22,901 --> 00:00:23,734
Essentially,
you are being asked to step away from 

12
00:00:28,511 --> 00:00:31,630
your college for a day.
Is that what it was?

13
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,610
Is it one day?
Well,

14
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,910
this goes back farther than that.
Let's lay out the whole thing.

15
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,773
Okay.
So we couldn't possibly lay out the 

16
00:00:39,281 --> 00:00:40,360
whole thing,
but let's just,

17
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,194
for people that have no idea what's 
going on right there listening right 

18
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,010
now,
and they're like,

19
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,873
who's this Bret Weinstein guy?
So the core of it surrounds a tradition 

20
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:53,020
that we have at evergreen called day of 
absence in this tradition.

21
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,450
Stretches back long before I was ever at
the college.

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,480
I've been there 15 years.
This tradition stretches back into,

23
00:00:58,481 --> 00:01:00,700
I think the early seventies.
And it's a,

24
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:04,450
it's built around a play written by 
Douglas Turner Ward,

25
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:07,570
a black playwright and the play,
um,

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,433
portrays events in a fictional town 
where the black population decides not 

27
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:13,780
to show up one day,
um,

28
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,703
in order to emphasize their,
their roles in the town that the white 

29
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:19,480
population is unaware of.
Um,

30
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,880
and as you would imagine,
all hell breaks list.

31
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,320
So anyway,
that's a,

32
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,000
it's an excellent play.
And,

33
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:25,834
uh,
some early faculty at our college 

34
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:30,950
decided that we should have a day that 
mirror and this event and that,

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,873
uh,
originally black faculty and students 

36
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:34,264
and then later with people of color 
would leave campus for a day to 

37
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:39,760
emphasize the role that they play in our
community.

38
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,500
And then they would later the,
um,

39
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,010
the tradition was amended and had a day 
of presence,

40
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:47,020
attitude at where people would come back
to campus.

41
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,150
And this has been going on.
Uh,

42
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,103
as I said,
since the 70s and the whole time I've 

43
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,114
been there.
And then this year it was announced by 

44
00:01:55,091 --> 00:01:58,060
the organizing committee that the,
uh,

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,870
the situation would be reversed and they
asked white students,

46
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:05,260
staff and faculty not to come to campus.
And,

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,440
uh,
that did not at all sit well with me.

48
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:12,460
Um,
as I said in my letter to the,

49
00:02:12,461 --> 00:02:14,320
uh,
the person who had announced this,

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,400
uh,
Rashida,

51
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,234
who I should say a staff and I,
she has ended up at the center of this 

52
00:02:18,701 --> 00:02:19,534
controversy,
I think wrongly just because my letter 

53
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,144
and response is addressed to her.
And then it was made public by our 

54
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:25,534
school paper.
So her name has been dragged front and 

55
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:29,440
center.
But in any case,

56
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,221
uh,
my letter,

57
00:02:30,221 --> 00:02:31,054
I said that there was all the difference
in the world between a population 

58
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:38,560
deciding to absent themselves from a 
shared space in order to highlight their

59
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,590
role and a population deciding to absent
another population from a shared space,

60
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:47,020
which I find unacceptable as as a 
person,

61
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:50,980
as somebody devoted to the gains of the 
civil rights movement.

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,180
Uh,
I just,

63
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,013
I and I should also probably say as a 
Jew and when people start telling me 

64
00:02:57,671 --> 00:03:00,310
where I can and cannot,
um,

65
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,910
yet it rings alarm bells.
Um,

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,820
so that,
that's the gist of the story.

67
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,850
And the letter caused quite a stir 
amongst,

68
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,080
uh,
students,

69
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:16,150
staff and faculty who responded.
Many of them quite angrily,

70
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,043
privately.
Of course people were much more divided 

71
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,730
on the matter and there were plenty of 
people who agreed with my letter,

72
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:24,700
but publicly speaking,
there was condemnation of the letter.

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:25,961
But the,
uh,

74
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:30,460
the event itself,
they have absence was mostly uneventful.

75
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,230
I,
I did go to campus,

76
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,050
as I said I would in my letter.
And,

77
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,360
um,
I actually,

78
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,370
uh,
it's neither here nor there.

79
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:42,520
It was accidental.
But while I was on campus,

80
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:47,350
I ran into a student that I know very 
well actually student that my wife and I

81
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:51,280
were abroad in Ecuador with last year.
We were teaching abroad and,

82
00:03:51,281 --> 00:03:53,320
uh,
we had 30 students with us.

83
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,720
And so one of the students who had 
traveled with us to Ecuador,

84
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,440
happened to be on campus to,
this is a student of color.

85
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,490
I'm going to stop this

86
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,850
cause too much banging around in here.

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,220
Sorry.
That's all right.

88
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,600
That was going to go on and I was going 
to drive me crazy.

89
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,850
I understand.
Keep going.

90
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,473
So I ran into this student that I,
I know well and care about quite a bit 

91
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,410
and we had a very nice conversation.
Mostly not about day of absence.

92
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,434
As a matter of fact,
I can't even remember if we did a talk 

93
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:33,284
about day of absence,
but there was something poignant to me 

94
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:38,810
about the fact that while I was being 
condemned for,

95
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:39,983
uh,
re refusing to accept this new 

96
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:42,014
formulation,
that I was able to meet with a student 

97
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,810
who is important to me and thee neither 
of our racial backgrounds is fun,

98
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,430
is primary in our relationship.
We know each other as people.

99
00:04:55,431 --> 00:04:59,180
And that's really how I would like to 
see all of us interacting on campus.

100
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,190
We all have our backgrounds,
they matter to us,

101
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,383
but it can't,
it cannot become the primary interface 

102
00:05:05,511 --> 00:05:06,344
between us.

103
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,980
Let,
let,

104
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,220
let me stop you here and let me try to 
understand,

105
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,113
um,
what the reaction was because you 

106
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,413
rightly said that you think there's a 
huge problem with asking people to not 

107
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,940
show up simply based on their color of 
their skin.

108
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,990
Exactly.
And what was the argument against that?

109
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,670
Like when,
when you said that,

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,570
and I read your letter and your letter 
didn't sound racist at all,

111
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,880
it sounded very well thought out.
It's a,

112
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,090
it made a very good point.
But the response,

113
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:39,170
the inflammatory response to your letter
was so disturbing and shocking.

114
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,550
Was there anyone who had reasonable 
debate with you about this?

115
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,830
Was there anyone who said,
well,

116
00:05:45,831 --> 00:05:49,670
we should take into consideration why 
they're asking us to do this.

117
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:52,220
We should sit down with them.
We should talk through this.

118
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,433
Was there,
was there anything reasonable or was it 

119
00:05:54,651 --> 00:05:55,484
just dig your heels in the sand and let 
the insults and the white privilege and 

120
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,980
all these accusations fly?

121
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,060
Well.
Um,

122
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,900
like I said,
there's a huge difference that you can't

123
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:05,734
see unless you're at the center of one 
of these things between the public 

124
00:06:08,921 --> 00:06:11,860
discussion and the private discussion 
privately,

125
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,870
I had very interesting discussions with 
many people that was not absent,

126
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,050
but if you were to look in on the 
discussion at the public level,

127
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,350
it looked as if there was consensus 
united against me.

128
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,210
Now when you say public and private,
are the same people making contradictory

129
00:06:28,211 --> 00:06:29,044
statements in public that are,
that are commiserating with you in 

130
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:34,660
private or is it just different people?

131
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,480
Well,
a few of them do that.

132
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,373
The act that actually is the thing I 
find most surprising is that sometimes 

133
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:43,080
people will privately say one thing to 
you and then publicly do another.

134
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,120
Uh,
mostly it's different people.

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,860
And I should say the people who,
um,

136
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:48,803
have talked to me privately and 
expressed concerns are actually quite a 

137
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,064
diverse group.
So it's not as if white folks are 

138
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:58,320
disturbed by this and people of color 
are united.

139
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:01,740
It's not at all like that.
But the part of the,

140
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,053
the hidden story here is that in order 
to invent advanced certain policy 

141
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:07,284
proposals,
it has to appear that the community is 

142
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,573
united behind them and that anybody who 
stands against them is standing against 

143
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:15,384
them for illegitimate reasons.
So that means that the number of people 

144
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,343
who are willing to express any sort of 
nuance about what's taking place has to 

145
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,140
be small and they have to be 
dismissible.

146
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,860
So what they did is they called me a 
racist,

147
00:07:28,861 --> 00:07:33,180
which is ironic because I'm an 
antiracist.

148
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:33,990
I really,
I've,

149
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:38,990
I've gone out of my way to first of all 
study the question of why racism occurs.

150
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,070
And uh,
I've,

151
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,443
I believe been pretty courageous in 
fighting against it where I've run into 

152
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,984
it.
So to challenge me with that particular 

153
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,533
epithet was a mistake on their part.
It was a strategic mistake and I kept 

154
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:54,294
trying to tell them all this was still 
internally being discussed in the 

155
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,744
college.
I kept trying to tell them that they 

156
00:07:58,501 --> 00:08:02,130
should really check the concept that I'm
a racist.

157
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:02,964
They should ask because if they did,
they would discover that they were 

158
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:06,924
actually way off the mark and then they 
would have an interesting puzzle on 

159
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:09,894
their hands.
Then they would have to explain to 

160
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,260
themselves why they had found themselves
hurling.

161
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,094
This most poisonous a term at somebody 
who not only isn't a racist but is 

162
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,660
pretty nearly the opposite.

163
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,143
Well it's,
it's a standard maneuver when someone 

164
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:25,694
wants to silence someone,
when someone wants to put someone in a 

165
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:31,430
category that's instantly recognizable,
one of the best ones is racist.

166
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,341
Oh,
absolutely.

167
00:08:32,341 --> 00:08:34,710
And,
and what I found is that,

168
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:36,293
um,
people simply could not figure out what 

169
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:43,920
they would do if that term was applied 
to them.

170
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,840
Right.
They were able to preview in their minds

171
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:46,674
what that would be like.
And so many people could see that there 

172
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,300
was no escape for them.
Right.

173
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,260
So

174
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,460
it's like being called a rapist almost.
It's like even if you are exonerated,

175
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,890
there's still that cloud hanging hanging
above you.

176
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,473
Yes.
But this also actually points to 

177
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,274
something pretty important.
And for anybody who travels this ground 

178
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:06,870
themselves,
they're going to discover this,

179
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,460
that many of the terms that are being 
used have been redefined,

180
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,473
but they haven't been fully redefined.
So one of the things that I've seen in 

181
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:15,774
several places is that a term like 
racist has been redefined so that the 

182
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:25,431
bar for being a racist is so low that 
you couldn't possibly help but trip over

183
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:28,500
it.
But then once you've tripped over it and

184
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,363
you have accepted that you are a racist,
then the stigma goes back to the 

185
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:36,570
original definition.
So it is the dodging and weaving between

186
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:39,390
the two definitions that actually does 
the heavy lifting.

187
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,463
Well,
there's also a really disturbing idea 

188
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,474
that's being bounced around lately,
that it's impossible to be racist if 

189
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:45,900
you're anything other than white.

190
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,970
Right.
Which is ridiculous.

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
It's preposterous.
Um,

192
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,633
anybody who looks up the actual 
definition of racism will discover that 

193
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,790
that's preposterous.
Um,

194
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,913
but yes,
that does pass in certain places as 

195
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:00,110
logical.
Yeah.

196
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,013
And just,
it's parroted and this very bizarre way 

197
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:07,260
that's supposed to be on challenged.
And this is a very recent thing.

198
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,393
I mean,
this is not something that existed two 

199
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,320
decades ago.
Right.

200
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,850
I agree.
And uh,

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,470
the pace at which it's moving in the 
last few years is very surprising.

202
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,603
It is surprising,
but it kind of makes sense because you 

203
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,980
get into these roots groups of people,
they have this confirmation bias,

204
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:23,814
they lumped up together and they all 
reinforce their ideas in this echo 

205
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:29,010
chamber and they all do it inside the 
colleges.

206
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,530
And then when it gets out to the rest of
the world,

207
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,630
as we're seeing with your case at 
Evergreen,

208
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,370
it,
the,

209
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,600
the rest of the world is like,
what is going on over here?

210
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,433
Like what is happening in school and 
people who are sending their children 

211
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:41,184
off to school are very concerned with 
the indoctrination of these ideas and 

212
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,213
the,
the adopting these very rigid mindsets 

213
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:53,460
that the rest of the world just simply 
could pick apart pretty quickly.

214
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,803
Well,
this is the most shocking thing because 

215
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:57,661
I'm,
you know,

216
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:58,494
I'm,
I haven't been censured I haven't been 

217
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,374
suspended.
I'm still on the email distribution 

218
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:06,060
list.
So I'm watching the traffic inside of my

219
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:06,894
college and I'm able to compare it to 
the huge flood of stuff that I'm seeing 

220
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,560
from the outside world as they get wind 
of what's going on at Evergreen.

221
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,040
And the difference is a million miles 
inside of evergreen.

222
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,560
Actually we are descending further into 
madness.

223
00:11:22,561 --> 00:11:23,940
The,
the faculty,

224
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,840
um,
are uh,

225
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,723
blaming the fact that the campus had to 
be suddenly closed due to a threat from 

226
00:11:32,011 --> 00:11:34,100
the outside yesterday,
uh,

227
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,003
on me for having talked about this in 
the outside world specifically for 

228
00:11:38,521 --> 00:11:40,930
hilarious.
I can't see,

229
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,860
I can't use that term yet.
Hopefully some day.

230
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,800
I hope it's soon.
And you know,

231
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:47,634
I must say one thing that I don't know,
we haven't even talked about where this 

232
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:51,924
uh,
where I got thrust into the spotlight 

233
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:53,604
here,
which your

234
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,860
listeners are going to have to know in 
order to understand why I'm even sitting

235
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:57,670
here.
But,

236
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,320
um,
but the,

237
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:03,490
uh,
the intensity and the,

238
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,153
um,
out of touch nature of the discussion 

239
00:12:07,361 --> 00:12:11,470
inside the college simply reinforces 
the,

240
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,693
uh,
the impression that something is 

241
00:12:14,261 --> 00:12:15,094
desperately off that,
that what we really have is a filter 

242
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:22,471
bubble that is so,
so strong that even when the world sends

243
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:23,554
very clear evidence that you've missed 
something somewhere and it's time to 

244
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:26,824
rethink what you've been doing.
They're not waking up and I love this 

245
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:32,860
college,
this college,

246
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,873
we maybe we'll get to talk about it,
but the structuring of this college is 

247
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,840
so unusual and what one can do as a 
professor at Evergreen,

248
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,940
uh,
if you're really dedicated to teaching,

249
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:47,800
it is the place to be because you have 
unparalleled pedagogical freedom,

250
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,350
more freedom than you'd have as a 
tenured professor at Harvard.

251
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,573
And you also have room to teach 
individually to students because our 

252
00:12:55,181 --> 00:12:59,110
students take one program at a time,
they're full time in one program and the

253
00:12:59,111 --> 00:12:59,944
professors teach one program at a time 
full time and they can go on for a full 

254
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,903
year.
So imagine you've got 25 students and 

255
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:07,204
you have him for a year full time.
You really know every student in your 

256
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:13,030
class individually,
not just by name,

257
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:14,950
but you know how they think,
you know,

258
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,420
their backgrounds,
you know,

259
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:17,523
um,
their blind spots and that allows for a 

260
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,500
kind of teaching that can't be done 
anywhere else.

261
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,363
So I am quite distressed at the fact 
that evergreen is now endangered by 

262
00:13:26,471 --> 00:13:28,150
what's going on.
Um,

263
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:33,210
and I really would like to see it wake 
up and rescue itself because it is worth

264
00:13:33,611 --> 00:13:34,690
rescuing.
Okay.

265
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,743
I watched the,
is it the president of the school who 

266
00:13:37,551 --> 00:13:40,490
gave the speech addressing all these 
issues?

267
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,560
George Bridges?
Yes.

268
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,660
Looked like a hostage negotiation.
It looked like he had a gun to his head.

269
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,530
He was literally Austin.

270
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,580
It was so bizarre.
And kids are yelling things at him like,

271
00:13:53,581 --> 00:13:55,560
what the fuck are you going to do?
And,

272
00:13:55,561 --> 00:13:57,960
and,
and he just has to take it.

273
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:58,794
It's so strange.
It's such a bizarro world to view it 

274
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:07,971
from the outside and to view these 
preposterous allegations that these kids

275
00:14:08,281 --> 00:14:09,114
are throwing at him of being racist and 
everyone's being racist and no one's 

276
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:13,074
doing anything to protect them.
And everyone's acting like they're in 

277
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:17,340
danger.
And their ideas are in danger and their,

278
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,490
their minds are in danger.
It's just so,

279
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,180
there's so much grandstanding.
It's so preposterous.

280
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,103
Like what is it?

281
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,231
Well,
first of all,

282
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:27,064
did you see the video in which a Dr. 
Bridges our president is being 

283
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,953
challenged for his hand gestures and the
protesters are actually policing his 

284
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:38,480
hand gestures.
That's,

285
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,503
oh,
it's,

286
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,520
it's fun with his hand gestures.
He's not doing this as he,

287
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,720
no,
no,

288
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,660
it wasn't any friend.

289
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,733
Thank you.
Can't even go like this to a friend 

290
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,050
because they'll pause you.

291
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,600
Right.
You right there in the middle.

292
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:51,740
No,
I think he's,

293
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,633
I mean,
I don't want to caricature this because 

294
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:55,814
I really think it's very important.
As preposterous as what's going on is I 

295
00:14:59,001 --> 00:15:02,000
think it's very important that we 
understand it.

296
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,550
It's very easy to dismiss it because 
it's so strange.

297
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,913
Um,
but it's very important that we get it 

298
00:15:07,101 --> 00:15:07,934
right.
I think the complaint about the hand 

299
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,320
gestures was that they represented,
um,

300
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,300
microaggressions,
if you will.

301
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,580
I don't know for sure that that was the 
complaint,

302
00:15:16,581 --> 00:15:18,500
but I can't make heads or tails of it 
otherwise.

303
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,810
What was he doing?
I give you,

304
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:25,390
can you move your hands and you think he
was kind of gesturing like a person to,

305
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,600
that's fine to talk with emotional and 
so I do think there's a,

306
00:15:29,601 --> 00:15:30,434
there's a translation which is this can 
be portrayed as a microaggression in 

307
00:15:34,881 --> 00:15:35,370
some way.

308
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,203
You're speaking it isn't,
well we should talk about whether 

309
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,124
microaggression is even a good category,
but let's just say the protesters had 

310
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,270
enough control over him that he 
gestured.

311
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,340
They didn't like it.
They told him not to.

312
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,490
He capitulated and she's been doing the 
entire time.

313
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,420
So I would say there's a huge amount of 
what's going on at Evergreen.

314
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,690
That is what I would call a show of 
force.

315
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,733
Is he afraid of losing his job?
Is he afraid of losing the support of 

316
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,390
the students?
What is he afraid of?

317
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,950
Well,
if you had to guess.

318
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,060
I think he is afraid of,
he's old enough.

319
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,933
He doesn't need another job.
He didn't need to take the job at 

320
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,030
evergreen,
what she took two years ago.

321
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,600
I think he is afraid that this is going 
to be the capstone of his career.

322
00:16:23,961 --> 00:16:27,350
A scandal in which he is allowed the 
campus to get out of control,

323
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:28,184
which he did.
But

324
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,430
here's the crazy thing.
It's a non scandal.

325
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:33,250
You're a non-racist who's been accused 
of being a racist.

326
00:16:33,251 --> 00:16:34,810
All you did was say,
Hey,

327
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:35,644
I don't think he should be able to tell 
people they can't show up for work if 

328
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:39,370
they're white.
They can't show up for school if they're

329
00:16:39,371 --> 00:16:40,780
white.
It seems kind of crazy.

330
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,160
And now hand gestures,
this is how far we've sunk that.

331
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,393
We're not at Kent State.
This is not the national guard shooting 

332
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:51,340
students.
It's this moving your hands around while

333
00:16:51,341 --> 00:16:54,310
you're talking with emotion.
That's a micro aggression.

334
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,970
His guys afraid of losing his job 
because of his hand motions.

335
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,003
Well,
it,

336
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,720
it goes beyond that.
So when George came to the college,

337
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,300
he,
he studied us,

338
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:08,310
which I can't hold him responsible for 
that.

339
00:17:08,311 --> 00:17:10,170
That was a good move.
If he was well intentioned,

340
00:17:10,171 --> 00:17:12,000
he would have done that.
But he studied us very carefully.

341
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,780
He had a friend to interview,
uh,

342
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:16,230
hundreds of us to figure out what was 
going on at the college.

343
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,740
But then he set in motion,
um,

344
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,323
policy proposals and committees that 
were empowered in a way that was 

345
00:17:25,051 --> 00:17:27,660
completely at odds with the way the 
school has run traditionally.

346
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:28,860
How so?
Well,

347
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:34,000
so among the many unique features of 
evergreen is the fact that the co,

348
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:38,010
the college is in large measure governed
by the faculty.

349
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,010
And even the administration,
all of the deans are faculty members who

350
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:43,320
have come from the faculty.
And when they're done being deans,

351
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:44,340
they go back to the faculty.

352
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:48,930
So the faculty has control over the 
college in a way that I don't,

353
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,080
there's another college in the country 
that runs that way.

354
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:57,480
So what that means is that if you want 
to advance a policy proposal,

355
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,050
the faculty has to agree to it.
And George wanted to do some things that

356
00:18:01,051 --> 00:18:01,884
the faculty would not have agreed to.
So I've told you about these full time 

357
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:08,700
programs where students get this really 
personally tailored education and they,

358
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,100
they join a community that everybody 
knows each other.

359
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,560
He wanted to take those apart.
Why?

360
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,800
I can't imagine,
I can't imagine why you would,

361
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,760
I mean I,
I can,

362
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,020
the most generous thing to say is that 
he did not understand what,

363
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,893
uh,
an important part of the evergreen 

364
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:33,030
model.
Those programs are whatever his reason,

365
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:38,031
it was a terrible error and the only way
to do it is to advance the uh,

366
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,720
the idea as an equity enhancing idea.

367
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,210
In other words,
you can say that,

368
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:48,780
um,
that the full time programs are anti,

369
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,943
um,
they are anti equity in the sense that 

370
00:18:53,191 --> 00:18:54,024
if you are disadvantaged you are less 
likely to be able to dedicate yourself 

371
00:18:56,851 --> 00:18:57,684
full time to a program because you may 
be going to school while you have a 

372
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:02,490
family and you have a job.
And so,

373
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,260
you know,
no doubt there's some truth to that,

374
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:05,820
but it doesn't,
you know,

375
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,683
how many colleges in the country do we 
have that do for credit programs and we 

376
00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:10,434
don't need another,
we have one college in the country that 

377
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,134
does full time programs.
And even if it is inconvenient for many 

378
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,184
people,
for reasons that are beyond their 

379
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:18,744
control,
the real question is can we get enough 

380
00:19:21,151 --> 00:19:24,330
people for whom that's exactly the right
model through the door.

381
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,450
And you know,
there are a lot,

382
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,303
you know,
it's also the college is very 

383
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:30,150
inconvenient for people who live in 
Colorado by virtue of the fact that it's

384
00:19:30,151 --> 00:19:32,570
hundreds of miles away.
So anyway,

385
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,200
so if you want it to advance that 
proposal,

386
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:37,230
it had to be dressed up as equity 
enhancing.

387
00:19:37,231 --> 00:19:38,064
And once it was equity enhancing,
it became very hard to challenge it 

388
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,390
because of course if you did challenge 
it then you were anti equity.

389
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,140
Boy,
that's convoluted.

390
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,423
You're telling me.
So he wants to sorta disassemble this 

391
00:19:53,391 --> 00:19:57,200
very unique and very beneficial model 
that you guys are operating under.

392
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,020
So this is just one part of it.
Now,

393
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:05,050
how does this get to this one suggestion
that white people step down?

394
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,590
Oh,
it doesn't.

395
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,483
Um,
the two are connected in the following 

396
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:12,560
sense.
The president empowered he,

397
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,760
he chose people to be on what's called 
the Equity Council.

398
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,710
The council has changed its name several
times.

399
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:19,544
So,
I'm not even sure what the current name 

400
00:20:20,751 --> 00:20:21,584
is.
I think it's the equity and inclusion 

401
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,133
council.
But,

402
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,670
um,
but in any case,

403
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,340
he chose this council.
The council is,

404
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,373
uh,
if you count the two deans that are on 

405
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:33,190
it,
it's only a third faculty members.

406
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:38,191
So it's mostly students,
staff and less than half faculty.

407
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,213
And he empowered them to propose 
modifications to the college that would 

408
00:20:43,941 --> 00:20:45,410
be equity,
enhance it.

409
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,890
And the thing that they,
the,

410
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,753
uh,
strategic equity plan is extremely 

411
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:53,080
densely written.
So it's hard to read.

412
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:55,150
And most of the people on our campus 
have not read it.

413
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,623
Um,
most of the people in the faculty have 

414
00:20:58,241 --> 00:20:59,080
not read it.
In fact,

415
00:20:59,081 --> 00:20:59,914
when it was released,
it was pretty clear that most of the 

416
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:05,020
people on the Equity Council hadn't read
it because it was so full of errors,

417
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:05,854
spelling errors and other things that 
would have been caught if people had 

418
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:08,284
gone through it.

419
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,730
But in any case,
um,

420
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,370
my wife,
who also teaches at evergreen and I,

421
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:15,610
and several others did read it carefully
and were very alarmed at what was in it.

422
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,060
So there were,
there were features of the document that

423
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:19,990
would,
for example,

424
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:25,270
completely reorient our hiring.
So our hiring process,

425
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:28,510
I would be up to see it revised and made
better too.

426
00:21:28,511 --> 00:21:30,250
Cause I don't,
I don't think we do it very well.

427
00:21:30,251 --> 00:21:32,140
I think it's one of the things we were 
weak about.

428
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,250
But um,
but anyway,

429
00:21:33,251 --> 00:21:35,530
the proposal that they advanced was 
that,

430
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,783
for example,
every single hire would have to be 

431
00:21:38,801 --> 00:21:42,310
justified on the basis that it was 
equity enhancing,

432
00:21:42,311 --> 00:21:44,290
meaning racially equity,
equity enhancing.

433
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,010
So imagine racially equity enhance,
right?

434
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,830
So not just,
uh,

435
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,043
not just a policy of hiring all kinds of
people and not being racially 

436
00:21:57,151 --> 00:22:02,151
discriminatory but being discriminatory 
in looking for certain people,

437
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,473
people of certain colors,
like he's a little harmony aiming 

438
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,833
towards.

439
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,090
I think beyond that,
beyond that,

440
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,740
when I read that,
I thought,

441
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,383
how exactly do you hire a physical 
chemist and justify that this is 

442
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,460
racially equity enhancing.
So you would

443
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:22,940
look towards like say if you had 10 
chemists,

444
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,980
you would try to only hire the ones that
were of color.

445
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,110
Yes.
And that in the,

446
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,380
yes,
I think so.

447
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:32,320
I mean,
as I said,

448
00:22:32,321 --> 00:22:34,860
the document is so densely written that 
it's hard to know.

449
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,873
It really is set up,
I think to be dismissed so that it can 

450
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:39,960
be instituted.
And then,

451
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,000
uh,
we can find out what it really means.

452
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,163
But think about the,
the model that I described about how we 

453
00:22:47,581 --> 00:22:48,414
teach at Evergreen.
That is not a model that anybody trains 

454
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,454
to teach in.
And the people who do it well are very 

455
00:22:55,471 --> 00:22:56,304
unusual.
So there we're not looking for the same 

456
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,450
professors that are,
you know,

457
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:02,700
that would be best at Berkeley,
for example,

458
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:03,534
we're looking for unusual people who 
will take full time programs and total 

459
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,563
pedagogical autonomy.
Meaning we actually literally are free 

460
00:23:12,511 --> 00:23:14,820
to teach anything we want in any way we 
want.

461
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,223
So that freedom is a marvelous thing.
If you have a particular appetite for 

462
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:24,990
figuring out how teaching should be 
done,

463
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:25,824
that it's never been done anywhere else 
before and you're willing to try it out 

464
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,780
and learn from the experience and 
advanced that way.

465
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,613
So we're looking for very unusual people
who find that an appealing challenge 

466
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:36,984
rather than somebody who wants to get a 
textbook and deliver the right the 

467
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,613
regular stuff.
If we're now going to prioritize race 

468
00:23:43,981 --> 00:23:48,230
over everything else in hiring,
then finding those needles in a haystack

469
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,064
who are actually well built to deal with
that much pedagogical freedom and that 

470
00:23:52,911 --> 00:23:57,440
much contact with the students is going 
to be that much harder because sometimes

471
00:23:57,441 --> 00:23:58,274
the right person for the job just simply
isn't going to be dark skinned or who 

472
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,980
knows.
So anyway,

473
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:08,000
I found the proposal as did as did other
people I talked to who had read it quite

474
00:24:08,001 --> 00:24:10,760
alarming at the level of hiring in 
particular.

475
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,480
So is it meant to give the impression of
diversity just by simply like,

476
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:19,070
look,
we've got our boxes checked,

477
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:22,160
here's a brown woman,
here's an Asian man,

478
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:22,701
here is,
I mean,

479
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,620
is that what they're trying to do?
Like look,

480
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,680
we've got all our bases covered.
This school is diverse.

481
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,803
Well,
I'd like to put a place holder on Asian 

482
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:32,290
man because,
um,

483
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,860
during day of absence there was actually
a,

484
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,203
I guess you would call it a seminar held
on a how Asians might just be part of 

485
00:24:40,841 --> 00:24:42,910
the problem here.
Yes.

486
00:24:42,911 --> 00:24:45,040
Asians and,
and a problem.

487
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,903
Yes.
Did you air quote when he said the 

488
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,870
problem?
I did and I'm not even sure if I should.

489
00:24:50,871 --> 00:24:51,310
And I,
you know,

490
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,100
the,
the world has become so bizarre.

491
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,270
Surrounded Asians are part of what 
problem?

492
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:55,781
Well,
I think,

493
00:24:55,781 --> 00:24:57,640
I think the translation is that,
um,

494
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,590
because um,
Asians are a population,

495
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,990
I don't know that is succeeding in a 
particular way,

496
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:05,824
at least from the perception of those 
who are deciding what these seminars 

497
00:25:08,231 --> 00:25:10,360
look like,
that they actually,

498
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,480
I don't know,
have special obligations in this.

499
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:16,360
And I might say everything I've just 
said about Asians,

500
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,540
uh,
could be repeated for women,

501
00:25:19,541 --> 00:25:20,374
especially white women who are playing a
special role in this equity battle on 

502
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:24,790
our campus too.

503
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,323
Um,
so white women might be a part of the 

504
00:25:27,311 --> 00:25:29,830
problem as well as Asian men quite 
clearly.

505
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,510
And so,
right.

506
00:25:31,511 --> 00:25:33,490
So the idea,
I think,

507
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,610
I mean I have my own hypothesis about 
this and that's really all it is,

508
00:25:36,611 --> 00:25:37,444
but it does fit everything I've seen so 
far is that there are entities within 

509
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,030
the,
you know,

510
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:45,863
you know,
10 years ago the phrase women in 

511
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,424
minorities was a very common phrase.
And what it meant was people who had 

512
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:53,030
faced historical oppression.
Um,

513
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,360
in the current context,
that's too many people in order to,

514
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,170
uh,
to utilize these structures to um,

515
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,573
to feed a certain set of populations,
you can't very well have all women 

516
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:10,960
included.
And so what's happened is people who are

517
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,973
perceived as yes,
having been historically disadvantaged 

518
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:15,874
in some way,
but also at the moment being successful 

519
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,370
in some sense,
uh,

520
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,530
are being shoved out of the coalition.

521
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,363
And then if they feel a loss,
a sense of loss in having been shoved 

522
00:26:28,631 --> 00:26:29,464
out,
the mechanism to get back in is to take 

523
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:35,200
on the role of what is ironically called
allyship in this case,

524
00:26:35,201 --> 00:26:36,034
which is not allyship at all.
It's an abuse of the concept of 

525
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:38,854
allyship.
Allyship is really a sum symmetrical 

526
00:26:40,811 --> 00:26:41,644
concept.
And this is subordination in is 

527
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:46,290
subordination than we hear that a lot 
with a male feminist community.

528
00:26:46,291 --> 00:26:48,600
The male feminists are supposed to be 
allies to women.

529
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:51,230
And we,
I haven't read a paper that was a,

530
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,780
or an article rather that was a telling 
white people,

531
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:58,950
if you truly want to be allies,
you should not take high paying jobs and

532
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:01,890
you should only leave them to 
minorities.

533
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,061
Yes.
My,

534
00:27:03,061 --> 00:27:04,830
my brother could ally.
Yeah.

535
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:05,664
That's what a good,
a good ally subordinates and that means 

536
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:09,840
stepping away from a job,
et cetera.

537
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,700
So it's not an ally at all.
No.

538
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,440
It has nothing to do with ally.
And in fact,

539
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,274
this is the thing that is most troubling
to me about my personal situation is 

540
00:27:17,401 --> 00:27:20,040
that if they really wanted,
you know,

541
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,660
mind you,
we're going to have to fill in what they

542
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:23,910
means.
But if this coalition really wanted,

543
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,680
uh,
an ally for a quest for real equity,

544
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,720
I would be an ally.
Right?

545
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,460
I really equate reelect.
Right.

546
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,010
That's not what they want.
And so

547
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:39,520
what do you think that means then?
If they don't want real equity?

548
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:40,623
What they want is a,
a special advantage given to people of 

549
00:27:43,601 --> 00:27:44,434
color,
a special advantage giving to people 

550
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:47,530
that were historically oppressed?

551
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,550
Well,
let's put it this way.

552
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,070
Um,
I believe so.

553
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:52,904
I believe that in general at the moment,
coalitions are unholy alliances between 

554
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,143
two things.
And in this case you have the real 

555
00:28:01,341 --> 00:28:02,174
equity movement,
which are people who wish to end 

556
00:28:04,341 --> 00:28:07,790
oppression.
And then you have a nother movement that

557
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:08,624
wishes to reverse oppression and they 
don't know that they're different 

558
00:28:11,541 --> 00:28:14,870
because until you reach equity,
they're pointing in the same direction.

559
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,490
I say.
So

560
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:21,070
one is trying to balance it out by,
in some way,

561
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,503
pushing down against white people.
And people who have historically had 

562
00:28:27,131 --> 00:28:31,510
privilege to trying to,
trying to reduce their role,

563
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,160
they're trying to literally oppress.

564
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,960
Think about the,
the,

565
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,813
the story we were just talking about 
where the president of the college is 

566
00:28:38,111 --> 00:28:40,120
being told how to move his hand with his
hands.

567
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,910
That's not so unlike,
um,

568
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,130
a black person,
a black man,

569
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:48,280
let's say,
being told that he's not allowed to look

570
00:28:48,281 --> 00:28:50,200
a white woman in the eye.
Right?

571
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,570
It's that kind of thing,
having been reversed.

572
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,710
This is people of color telling the 
president of our college how to move his

573
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:57,544
hands.
So it was people of color that were 

574
00:28:58,961 --> 00:29:00,890
telling them to do this with his hands 
that,

575
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,841
uh,
again,

576
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,700
I've gotta be really careful because,
you know,

577
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,880
I've seen the video only once and I'm 
trying to remember if the people who are

578
00:29:06,881 --> 00:29:09,850
doing the asking are even on the screen.
So I don't want to,

579
00:29:09,851 --> 00:29:12,100
I don't want to project something that I
don't know for sure,

580
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,290
but it was definitely,
uh,

581
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,770
this,
the protesters which were protesting on,

582
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,790
some of them were white protesting on 
behalf of people of color.

583
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,220
And some of them,
many of them were people of color.

584
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:25,443
But even there,
we're in trouble with the complexity 

585
00:29:26,771 --> 00:29:27,604
because the people of color coalition 
that is protesting is not synonymous 

586
00:29:31,961 --> 00:29:32,794
with people of color at evergreen.
There are many people of color at 

587
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:37,060
evergreen who are,
um,

588
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,160
either just simply bewildered by what's 
going on or very troubled by it.

589
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,320
Because you can imagine,
I mean,

590
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:47,950
I've just put yourself in the shoes of a
person of color who came to evergreen to

591
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,940
get a really interesting education and 
didn't want to tell the president how to

592
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,863
move his hands,
and then you see this happening in your 

593
00:29:54,491 --> 00:29:55,324
name.
What exactly are you supposed to do 

594
00:29:57,281 --> 00:29:57,950
then?

595
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,240
Well,
there's also the problem,

596
00:29:59,241 --> 00:30:01,640
the very real problem with the mob 
mentality,

597
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:02,803
and it is a,
a common thing with human beings and 

598
00:30:06,101 --> 00:30:06,934
they get together in large groups and 
people started chanting and screaming 

599
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,890
and they feel very justified and they 
always want to escalate.

600
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,450
It's,
it's very weird.

601
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,240
It's,
it's a strange reaction that,

602
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,163
that human beings have in large groups 
acting together where they just want to 

603
00:30:21,711 --> 00:30:24,140
ramp things up.
They want to take it to the next level.

604
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:25,880
They want to shut this motherfucker 
down.

605
00:30:25,881 --> 00:30:26,500
They,
it's,

606
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,333
it's a weird thing that people do it,
but I was watching it in your videos 

607
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:33,200
where people were saying,
you should resign.

608
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,140
Like you need to resign.
Like you need to resign.

609
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,790
Like,
wow,

610
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:41,840
you need to apologize to that woman for 
communicating with her the way you did.

611
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:42,723
Right.
And very respectful and intelligent 

612
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,060
manner.
Like it's,

613
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,620
they want to bull you around,
they want to push you around.

614
00:30:48,621 --> 00:30:49,454
They want to take that professor,
that guy who has been allowed to be the 

615
00:30:51,111 --> 00:30:51,944
one who's talking and distributing all 
the information and they want to shut 

616
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:55,814
you down.

617
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:57,720
It's flat out bullying.
Yeah.

618
00:30:57,721 --> 00:30:58,554
And what I'm,
what I'm seeing is that almost nobody 

619
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:04,594
seems to know what to do about bullies,
especially when they're armed with a 

620
00:31:08,141 --> 00:31:08,974
super weapon.
Like the accusation that you're a 

621
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:11,194
racist.
Nobody understands that capitulating to 

622
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:16,450
bullies may solve your problem in the 
moment,

623
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:18,610
but it makes the problem vastly worse 
over time.

624
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,833
And so anyway,
all I've done is apply that piece of 

625
00:31:21,731 --> 00:31:24,310
knowledge that when a,
when a bully challenges you,

626
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,443
um,
not capitulating is just a prerequisite 

627
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:31,290
to getting anywhere.
Ideally you want the bullied,

628
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,030
um,
to pay enough of a price that they don't

629
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,140
continue what they're doing.

630
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:36,223
Well,
ideally you would like to have a 

631
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:41,000
rational conversation with these people 
and get them to see your perspective and

632
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,500
they should be able to consider it and 
say,

633
00:31:42,501 --> 00:31:44,030
okay,
he's not racist.

634
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:44,511
Well,
yeah,

635
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:45,344
it is kind of ridiculous that we're 
asking people who didn't have a say in 

636
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:53,870
what color they were born to step away 
from something or to we're,

637
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,890
we're literally discriminating in under 
the guise of being anti discriminatory.

638
00:31:59,090 --> 00:31:59,960
We're discriminating.

639
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,210
Right.
I mean that's,

640
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,693
and it's not even,
it wouldn't even be hard to have that 

641
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:09,010
conversation one on one even I do it 20 
on one.

642
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,780
But don't you think that that's what 
happened?

643
00:32:10,781 --> 00:32:13,270
They just start screaming and,
well,

644
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,150
I mean a,
you,

645
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,100
you have to get used to the fact that 
you don't get there all at once.

646
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:18,934
You plant a seed that's enough to cause 
them to know something about what we're 

647
00:32:21,551 --> 00:32:24,820
saying couldn't possibly be right or we 
wouldn't be seeing what we're seeing.

648
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,240
Um,
the problem here is that the,

649
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:31,060
the mob that we're talking about is so 
large that even,

650
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,913
you know,
in a couple cases on last Tuesday and 

651
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,730
not this last year,
so I guess it was two tuesdays ago now.

652
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,160
Um,
the couple of times that I was faced

653
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,490
with a group that was,
you know,

654
00:32:43,491 --> 00:32:44,324
somewhere below a hundred,
I actually do think I made some 

655
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:48,044
progress,
but I thought it was not durable at all 

656
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:50,534
because as soon as the event was over,
whatever progress was made got 

657
00:32:53,421 --> 00:32:56,090
overwritten by whatever discussion 
happened next.

658
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,583
Yeah.
So it is possible to have these 

659
00:32:58,551 --> 00:33:03,410
discussions,
but there's something about the momentum

660
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,600
that is in play here that makes it 
impossible to make any durable progress.

661
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:11,930
Durable progress is a very interesting 
description.

662
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,900
Durable progress.
Yup.

663
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,020
Yeah.
Cause you're,

664
00:33:16,021 --> 00:33:20,480
you're fighting against is this current 
movement,

665
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:21,973
uh,
of a ridiculous ideas that that's going 

666
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:26,870
on through schools.
And we saw with Yale,

667
00:33:26,871 --> 00:33:28,730
we saw it with those students screaming 
at,

668
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,890
um,
what was it?

669
00:33:30,891 --> 00:33:33,420
The professor was at a professor who was
the guy that was,

670
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:37,550
they were screaming at that was a trying
to defend his wife's.

671
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,670
Yes.
Email about Halloween costumes.

672
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,533
Yes,
maybe we should allow people to wear 

673
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:43,754
ridiculous Halloween costumes because 
that's part of like the fun of 

674
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:46,874
Halloween.
People were acting like you were saying 

675
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:51,020
that we should be lynching people.
Well,

676
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,670
so first of all he did reach out to me.
Uh,

677
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,553
and his point was what you are going 
through is eerily reminiscent he's 

678
00:33:59,751 --> 00:34:03,050
watched the videos and he was just 
pointing out how shocking it was.

679
00:34:03,051 --> 00:34:04,070
I mean,
even to the point of,

680
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,203
um,
my wife having been dragged in here 

681
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,813
oddly,
uh,

682
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,820
in this discussion where she wrote an 
email internal to our,

683
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,240
uh,
our distribution list asking the college

684
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:21,650
why they were not protecting me and my 
students who were being actively stocked

685
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:25,310
on our campus harassed doxed which 
students,

686
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,660
uh,
my current students.

687
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,523
But why,
why your current students being 

688
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,860
harassed?
My current students,

689
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,933
like almost all of my former students 
know that this charge is completely 

690
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:38,300
baseless and so they have been 
supportive.

691
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,313
So in defending you then they're being 
attacked absolute like their little 

692
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:45,590
soldiers in some sort of a strange 
ideological battle.

693
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,860
They are being penalized for not falling
in line.

694
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,770
Wow.
That's scary.

695
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,210
That's real scary.
Bullying.

696
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:54,080
When someone says,
Hey,

697
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:54,914
he's a good guy.
And then someone comes after them and 

698
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:58,940
said,
this is where this person lives,

699
00:34:58,941 --> 00:35:01,850
let's find them that that is actually 
literally happened.

700
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,013
And uh,
what has happened to the students once 

701
00:35:04,731 --> 00:35:06,890
they do find them?
Well,

702
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,340
so the students have been,
I think the idea is intimidation.

703
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:11,350
So I've,
uh,

704
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,313
I've had students followed in the woods 
and that I've had students visited at 

705
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,450
home.
Um,

706
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,313
it's very scary and I should say,
just in terms of putting the context 

707
00:35:22,791 --> 00:35:23,624
here,
as the college was pretending that 

708
00:35:25,461 --> 00:35:26,294
nothing serious was going on,
the police called me up on the 

709
00:35:29,751 --> 00:35:30,584
Wednesday,
just after the Tuesday in which I had 

710
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,660
been challenged in my class and asked 
me,

711
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:38,130
are you on campus?
And I didn't have class.

712
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:38,461
I said,
no,

713
00:35:38,461 --> 00:35:39,360
I'm not on campus.
So they said,

714
00:35:39,361 --> 00:35:41,370
don't come to campus.
And I said,

715
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:42,510
why?
And they said,

716
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,230
because,
um,

717
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,473
the protesters are searching car to car 
for what they describe as an individual 

718
00:35:50,761 --> 00:35:55,470
and we think it's you and the college 
has told us to stand down.

719
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,670
We can't protect you.
What I know,

720
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,980
college has told the police to not 
protect you.

721
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,520
The college told the police to stand 
down,

722
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:12,550
which means the police were literally 
barricaded in the police station despite

723
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:19,540
their sense that they very much needed 
to be actively protecting people outside

724
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:20,624
of the police station.
The police were left with no choice but 

725
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,444
to barricade themselves in the police 
station because they answered to the 

726
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,760
college administration,
which told them not to act,

727
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,550
I think because it wished to prevent,
um,

728
00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:32,930
a,
uh,

729
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,823
a new story.
But this meant people engage in these 

730
00:36:36,141 --> 00:36:40,220
protests were roving freely about the 
campus,

731
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,890
looking for people following them.
They,

732
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,080
you know,
that's so incredibly aggressive,

733
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:50,060
like looking for individuals in a car 
and to do what?

734
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,590
Well,
that's the question.

735
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,240
I,
my guests would be even,

736
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:54,074
they don't know,
let's say that it was me that they were 

737
00:36:55,731 --> 00:36:57,140
looking for,
which would make sense.

738
00:36:57,860 --> 00:37:02,660
I would imagine that they would have had
the idea of,

739
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:03,523
I don't know,
taking me somewhere and getting me to 

740
00:37:04,521 --> 00:37:08,030
acknowledge something that they think 
sort of a hostage situation.

741
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:11,930
Right.
But suppose I didn't want to acknowledge

742
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,930
whatever it is that they wanted me to 
acknowledge,

743
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,140
just as I didn't want to resign when 
they said I should resign.

744
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,690
I don't,
I don't know if they had a backup plan.

745
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:21,524
And it worries me that one of the things
that unfolded on the campus was that 

746
00:37:24,441 --> 00:37:25,274
people who had a very clear idea of how 
things should go were they were 

747
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:32,700
literally,
uh,

748
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:33,763
I mean there were barricaded in the 
president's office with the president 

749
00:37:35,571 --> 00:37:38,000
and a bunch of faculty members and 
staff.

750
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,103
And the story is that the president 
wanted to go to the bathroom and he was 

751
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:45,080
not even allowed to go privately to the 
bathroom.

752
00:37:45,081 --> 00:37:48,860
He had to be escorted by two people who 
president of the college.

753
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:50,780
But who are the people?
Protestors,

754
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,030
protestors had to go with him to the 
bathroom.

755
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,133
Right.
So that to me sounds like literally get 

756
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,123
an APP.

757
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,960
It's just stunning that he agreed to 
that.

758
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,340
It,
it is,

759
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,510
it is stunning.
I can't believe I'm seeing it.

760
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,540
Well,
this is pc gone a muck.

761
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,374
I mean,
this is what everybody's been worried 

762
00:38:15,101 --> 00:38:15,491
about.
This,

763
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:18,790
is that what you are right now is the 
year that tip of the spear

764
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,470
we are previewing where this goes.
Taken to its logical.

765
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,770
Yeah.
Yeah.

766
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,080
I mean,
and could have been worse.

767
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,120
Had you not been contacted by the 
police,

768
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,030
had you been in one of those cars?
Had you been pulled out?

769
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,023
Have you been pulled into some sort of a
hostage situation where they're trying 

770
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,100
tell you you can't

771
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,933
go to the bathroom without us like they 
did to the fucking president and he 

772
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:40,490
agreed to it?
Yup.

773
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,130
I mean,
this is madness.

774
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,410
I mean that's like,
people should go to jail for that.

775
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,730
Well,
so,

776
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,440
okay.
That's kidnapping,

777
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,630
kidnapping.
I do think,

778
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,513
um,
that the administration and certain 

779
00:38:53,591 --> 00:38:55,990
faculty members have a lot of 
responsibility here.

780
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,820
So I think in some sense,
yes,

781
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,310
it's literal kidnapping.
The students,

782
00:39:00,311 --> 00:39:03,820
however,
I believe have become tools of something

783
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,460
that they don't really understand tools 
of what though?

784
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:07,930
Of their own making.
I mean,

785
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:08,764
is it an ideology,
an ideology outside of the school that 

786
00:39:11,471 --> 00:39:15,520
they subscribed to or is it their own?
I mean,

787
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:17,380
what is it?
Well,

788
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,430
I believe

789
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:21,110
it is a,
um,

790
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,550
a militant belief structure.
And,

791
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:26,863
uh,
I do think based on what we've seen on 

792
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:30,674
our campus,
it is emanating from a subset of the 

793
00:39:34,401 --> 00:39:36,350
black population.
Okay.

794
00:39:36,351 --> 00:39:39,350
So I'm not saying that this is black 
people doing this,

795
00:39:39,351 --> 00:39:43,040
but I'm saying that the people who are 
at the forefront of it happened to be in

796
00:39:43,041 --> 00:39:43,874
that part of the coalition of people of 
color and that they are advancing a set 

797
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:52,340
of assumptions and beliefs that they 
seem to imagine,

798
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,943
uh,
describe some future world that they 

799
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:57,980
would like to reach.
And it's a future road.

800
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,060
I mean,
it's preposterous.

801
00:39:59,061 --> 00:39:59,894
It will never happen because what is the
future world where the 400 years of 

802
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:10,091
oppression of black people in North 
America results in a,

803
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:13,940
uh,
a reversal of roles?

804
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,990
I think,
I mean,

805
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:15,824
I can't imagine having that thought and 
following it through and not realizing 

806
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,400
that this can't possibly be anything 
like a way forward.

807
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,010
I also see something that they've 
described this reversal roles.

808
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:30,023
Well,
they would like to come to this 

809
00:40:30,691 --> 00:40:31,280
conclusion.

810
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,210
So I would imagine that your listeners 
having heard me just say what I said,

811
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,250
have to be wondering a little bit about 
me and,

812
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,290
and where,
where am I sympathies really lie.

813
00:40:39,291 --> 00:40:41,030
But what I've seen,
and if,

814
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:41,864
and if your listeners go looking at the 
videos that came out of evergreen over 

815
00:40:45,171 --> 00:40:47,570
the last 10 days posted by the 
protesters,

816
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:50,660
I should point out videos that they 
thought they had them look good.

817
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,063
Um,
they will find many instances in which 

818
00:40:54,651 --> 00:40:58,250
the official order of things says,
um,

819
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,500
well,
let's say there's a four o'clock meeting

820
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,830
on the Tuesday in which I was challenged
in the morning four o'clock meeting.

821
00:41:03,831 --> 00:41:06,440
That became very dangerous.
Um,

822
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,713
and the meeting began with an 
announcement that the chairs and the 

823
00:41:14,031 --> 00:41:16,400
food,
we're for people of color and that white

824
00:41:16,401 --> 00:41:19,680
people shouldn't use them.
Uh,

825
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,780
yes,
I know

826
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:23,810
the chairs and the food.
We're only for people of color.

827
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,880
Correct.
White people have to be hungry.

828
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,650
Right?
You can't sit down.

829
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,930
Right.
And I've also seen,

830
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,793
you know,
I don't remember where I saw it and I 

831
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,300
probably have a of it,
but I saw something where,

832
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,550
uh,
some activists,

833
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,680
uh,
put out a message,

834
00:41:39,681 --> 00:41:40,514
a broadcast message that said a person 
of color needed a power adapter for a 

835
00:41:43,881 --> 00:41:44,714
computer.
Where there any white people who could 

836
00:41:45,741 --> 00:41:48,290
fetch one or something like that.
I mean,

837
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,423
the thing is that it's preposterous,
but it is also putting in danger the 

838
00:41:54,141 --> 00:41:59,141
actual vision of a world in which race 
ceases to provide advantage.

839
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:01,750
Right?
Um,

840
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,470
so anyway,
it's jeopardizing that.

841
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:05,270
It should be reversed.
It's just so crazy.

842
00:42:05,271 --> 00:42:07,040
Like we should press now like,
no,

843
00:42:07,041 --> 00:42:08,180
does she be none?
Right?

844
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:09,770
We should get past this,
right?

845
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,410
We should be anti supremacist 100%.

846
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,540
This idea.
I mean,

847
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,403
can you imagine if there was a college 
in North America that suggested that 

848
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:17,984
white people only should eat and white 
people only should be able to take the 

849
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:21,404
seats?
Is that what's going to happen 300 

850
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:24,134
years?
So what if black people are pressed for 

851
00:42:25,161 --> 00:42:27,200
the next 300 then white people come back
and say,

852
00:42:27,201 --> 00:42:28,034
hey,
we're going to have to turn this around 

853
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:30,230
again.
I mean,

854
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,093
isn't the idea that a hundred years from
now white people are going to be a 

855
00:42:33,261 --> 00:42:34,094
minority in America because the rates of
birth is with Latinos and black folks 

856
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:39,194
that w w we'll it,
there won't be a this minority group 

857
00:42:41,931 --> 00:42:43,460
anymore that they will be.
In fact,

858
00:42:43,461 --> 00:42:44,294
a majority.
All I can say is it's so obviously a 

859
00:42:47,001 --> 00:42:51,770
wrong path just in terms of a,
it's not an honorable objective.

860
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:52,910
It's racist.
It's race.

861
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:55,250
It's absolutely racist.
I mean it's not even,

862
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,990
it's not even difficult to see that.

863
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:57,883
It just simply is racist.
But if you say that on my campus at the 

864
00:43:00,741 --> 00:43:04,070
moment you're the racist for not 
understanding why this is logic.

865
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:04,904
So how do people react when someone says
a person of color and needs a power 

866
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:09,950
adapter?
Can a white person go fetch it?

867
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,130
Are these white air quote allies?
Exactly.

868
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:18,131
Running these Beta males and just 
running to go grab a white power adapter

869
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:21,230
and give it to this person of color.
Is that what's happening?

870
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,350
That's the literal description of it.
Jesus Christ.

871
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:26,180
And then they have to,
in a few years,

872
00:43:26,181 --> 00:43:27,740
they're going to have to go out into the
workforce.

873
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,450
Well,
and that's the thing that,

874
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:31,190
well this is a whole other side of the 
puzzle.

875
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,680
What this is really about,
and not just at Evergreen,

876
00:43:33,681 --> 00:43:37,580
but this movement which has taken over 
so many campuses and shut down.

877
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:40,610
So many people who spoke with positions 
that were not,

878
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,380
um,
somehow sanctioned,

879
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:43,723
uh,
is really a battle between two 

880
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,630
incompatible worldviews,
uh,

881
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:54,110
within the academy.
So on the one hand you have the sciences

882
00:43:54,111 --> 00:43:54,944
and all of the things that function on 
the same assumptions that the sciences 

883
00:43:57,111 --> 00:43:57,944
do about how you figure out what's true.
And then you have these postmodern 

884
00:44:01,881 --> 00:44:02,714
disciplines,
which basically argue that the tools 

885
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:06,854
that the science claim are about 
figuring out what's true are actually 

886
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,560
tools of oppression themselves.
And so,

887
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:13,910
you know,
another video.

888
00:44:13,911 --> 00:44:14,744
Damn.
Rulers.

889
00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:16,183
Rulers.

890
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:19,640
Yeah,
exactly.

891
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,940
Um,
so there's this video in the middle of,

892
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,873
of the Tuesday,
the first Tuesday of these protests 

893
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,394
where the president barricaded with 
these protesters is talking to them and 

894
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:31,583
uh,

895
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,903
the protesters actually flat out say,
in referring to my email that I 

896
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,424
mentioned the word phenotype,
and that that inherently tells you that 

897
00:44:42,601 --> 00:44:43,434
I must be a racist to even be thinking 
about a scientific term in the context 

898
00:44:48,031 --> 00:44:48,864
of this,
which I find horrifying because these 

899
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,590
very students stand to gain a tremendous
amount.

900
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,580
They will be most powerful in the world 
in pursuing equity.

901
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:00,414
Among other things,
they will be most powerful in the world 

902
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:02,813
if they are armed with a scientific tool
kit with an analytical tool kit that 

903
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,454
allows them to,
to be forceful rather than to be 

904
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:12,264
preposterous.
What was the context you used the word 

905
00:45:14,281 --> 00:45:15,160
phenotype again,
I,

906
00:45:15,161 --> 00:45:16,230
I forget.
Oh,

907
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:17,580
I said,
um,

908
00:45:17,610 --> 00:45:22,610
that I would like us in my challenge to 
the new day of absence formulation.

909
00:45:22,951 --> 00:45:26,580
I said I would like us to put phenotype 
aside,

910
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,220
right?
But phenotype aside,

911
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:34,080
meaning that I did not want us 
discussing equity as teams,

912
00:45:34,081 --> 00:45:36,060
as different teams broken up by stem 
color.

913
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:37,363
Um,
and so the very fact that I said 

914
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:39,383
phenotype and that I suggested that I 
would be willing to give a lecture to 

915
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:43,674
anybody who wanted to come about what I 
understand to be the evolutionary 

916
00:45:48,001 --> 00:45:51,360
context of racism.
And they did not want the lecture.

917
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,463
They assumed that if I said evolution 
and racism that I was going to give a 

918
00:45:55,411 --> 00:45:57,910
eugenics lecture or something like that.
Um,

919
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,370
and so it's,
it's preposterous.

920
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,233
The way the way this works is they shut 
down the conversation before you can 

921
00:46:03,721 --> 00:46:04,554
have it so that they don't actually know
what you're going to say and therefore 

922
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:08,940
don't need to address it.
Oh God.

923
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:11,040
Yeah.
It's quite frightening.

924
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:11,621
Well,
it's,

925
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:12,454
it's bizarre because it's,
it's primarily occurring in 

926
00:46:15,841 --> 00:46:16,674
universities.
It's not happening really in high 

927
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:21,150
school's very much.
It's sort of bubbles up in high schools.

928
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:22,103
It appears by people that I talked to 
that have been in high school and gone 

929
00:46:24,901 --> 00:46:27,480
into universities that you see echoes of
it.

930
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:30,930
You see the beginnings.
And then when it gets to college,

931
00:46:30,931 --> 00:46:33,450
you're away from your parents.
You're in some new place.

932
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,400
They,
everyone gathers in groups,

933
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,610
they dig their heels in the sand and 
they go fucking crazy.

934
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,163
Well,
I mean there is something about college 

935
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,770
and you know,
and we all did,

936
00:46:43,771 --> 00:46:45,750
she dump stuff in college.
Um,

937
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,190
but I also think there's a hidden reason
for being colleges,

938
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,233
which is that there is real inequity in 
civilization that needs to be dealt 

939
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:55,374
with.
I would say the thing that I find most 

940
00:46:57,151 --> 00:46:57,984
troubling is the skew in policing and in
the courts that results in 

941
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:07,620
disproportionate fractions of some 
populations being incarcerated,

942
00:47:07,621 --> 00:47:11,130
which has a terrifically destabilizing 
impact on this community.

943
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:16,131
So I think that that is a very real harm
that would be hard to overstate and that

944
00:47:17,641 --> 00:47:19,840
absolutely has to be addressed,
uh,

945
00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:20,723
just,
just to even make any claim on being a 

946
00:47:21,841 --> 00:47:22,680
fair society.

947
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:28,020
That said,
it is very hard to attack the,

948
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,040
um,
the private prison complex,

949
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:31,330
for example.
Right.

950
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,520
It's a,
it's a difficult challenge.

951
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,550
On the other hand,
the universities are a soft target.

952
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:41,200
They can't defend themselves and they 
already have sympathies in the direction

953
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,310
of,
you know,

954
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,420
a view of a radically different enhanced
world.

955
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,583
So in effect,
I think we're being challenged on the 

956
00:47:50,651 --> 00:47:51,484
basis that the inequities on our 
campuses are completely intolerable and 

957
00:47:56,591 --> 00:47:57,424
that that is largely a fiction.
And that what really is happening is 

958
00:48:03,581 --> 00:48:07,480
that this is displaced anger over a 
system that is fair,

959
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,820
that's been pointed at something that 
can't defend it

960
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,330
itself.
That's fascinating.

961
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:15,590
So this is a reaction to the actual real
inequities of the outside world,

962
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:16,424
the systemic racism in places like 
Baltimore and what we're finding out 

963
00:48:18,801 --> 00:48:23,060
about places where they literally would 
not sell homes to black people,

964
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,953
communities that have just had 
generation after generation of 

965
00:48:26,001 --> 00:48:29,060
impoverished people that are fighting 
off crime ridden neighborhoods.

966
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,133
Right.
Or water you can't drink because it has 

967
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,680
red in it went right.
Exactly.

968
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:36,430
So what the universities,
what,

969
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:37,363
what's happening in the universities is 
a sort of a misguided reaction to all 

970
00:48:40,461 --> 00:48:41,510
the real inequity in the way

971
00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:44,300
world.
I would say not misguidance ms direct Mr

972
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,220
wreck.
He just pointed at the wrong thing.

973
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,054
And the reason it's pointed at the 
colleges and universities is that they 

974
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:50,930
simply can't defend themselves.

975
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,110
That's fascinating.
And so,

976
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:55,973
um,
this is occurring in universities all 

977
00:48:58,501 --> 00:48:59,334
over the country and at a rate that's 
according to people that I know that 

978
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:08,670
teach pretty unprecedented at,
this wasn't the case 20 years ago,

979
00:49:08,671 --> 00:49:10,530
that you would have dissent,
you would have debate,

980
00:49:10,531 --> 00:49:11,364
you'd have discussion,
but you wouldn't have these full blown 

981
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,900
ideological mobs.

982
00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:17,163
Yeah.
I think the thing is it hadn't been 

983
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,140
operationalized yet.
The thought process that led to this was

984
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:26,470
postmodernism has been,
um,

985
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,240
has been around for decades.
And so there were places you could go if

986
00:49:31,241 --> 00:49:33,100
you want it to have an absurd 
discussion.

987
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,020
You could go,
for example,

988
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,093
to cultural anthropology.
Cultural anthropology was captured by 

989
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:43,690
postmodernism 30 years ago.
And so if you want it to hear people say

990
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:44,524
really crazy things about what's true,
cultural anthropology was a place you 

991
00:49:47,441 --> 00:49:48,274
could do it.
If you step next door to physical 

992
00:49:49,391 --> 00:49:51,640
anthropology,
it was just fine.

993
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,530
Um,
and so anyway,

994
00:49:53,531 --> 00:49:57,520
that's been in the university and what's
happened is it has been,

995
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,810
um,
how would one put it?

996
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:02,890
It has been operationalized or activated
so that it is now,

997
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,410
um,
it is now,

998
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,273
it forms the core of a vision that 
college students are trying to bring 

999
00:50:09,491 --> 00:50:10,660
about.
Not all of them,

1000
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,793
but enough of them that you can't run a 
college without either deciding to 

1001
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,200
capitulate or figuring out how you're 
going to fight back.

1002
00:50:20,330 --> 00:50:21,163
What,
was there a way that this could have 

1003
00:50:22,581 --> 00:50:23,414
been stopped or nipped in the bud in the
years past or zero that this could have 

1004
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:32,921
been sort of planned for?
Was there a lack of lack of foresight?

1005
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:33,630
Yeah.

1006
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,850
Yeah.
Um,

1007
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:38,220
this is exactly what I was talking about
a few minutes ago.

1008
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,630
If you,
um,

1009
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:42,780
if you give in to the bully,
the bully comes back stronger.

1010
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:43,983
Um,
we've been given into the postmodern 

1011
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:45,984
bully for decades and it's now come back
in a form that nobody knows what to do 

1012
00:50:50,071 --> 00:50:51,030
with it.
Um,

1013
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:56,240
so what was the original reason to give 
in when it was a more mild argument?

1014
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,430
Well,
because it was an abstraction.

1015
00:50:58,660 --> 00:50:59,493
Hmm.
So

1016
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:03,360
originally the idea that,
um,

1017
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:08,640
that certain,
that based on their history,

1018
00:51:08,641 --> 00:51:10,920
certain people who had been,
for example,

1019
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:11,963
largely shut out of the sciences,
we're entitled to think without having 

1020
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,530
to deal with the structures that had 
been built around,

1021
00:51:19,531 --> 00:51:20,364
let's say a man and most mostly white 
men over the course of western 

1022
00:51:24,001 --> 00:51:24,834
scientific history.
So the idea that women may be needed a 

1023
00:51:28,321 --> 00:51:32,460
place to discuss what was true that was 
not structured by men.

1024
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:34,530
I get that.
And in fact,

1025
00:51:34,531 --> 00:51:35,364
there's a very good example in my own 
field where the difference between the 

1026
00:51:40,561 --> 00:51:43,380
way men and women,
I don't mean every man and every woman,

1027
00:51:43,381 --> 00:51:44,214
but the difference on average,
I think played a decisive and very 

1028
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,573
positive role when Louis Leakey 
empowered three women to go study the 

1029
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:55,230
three great apes in order to figure out 
what's going on with them.

1030
00:51:55,231 --> 00:51:59,520
And so Jane Goodall to figured out what 
was going on with the chimps because she

1031
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:00,850
was,
uh,

1032
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:01,913
because she was female and because she 
didn't subscribe to the rules that men 

1033
00:52:04,741 --> 00:52:06,570
had written down about how you study 
these creatures.

1034
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:07,403
And so it is a case where something 
about the way men look at the world had 

1035
00:52:10,381 --> 00:52:12,470
prevented people like George Shaller,
uh,

1036
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,670
who had,
uh,

1037
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,030
made his mark studying lions.
He didn't do so well with gorillas.

1038
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:19,021
Um,
so anyway,

1039
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:22,330
Jane Goodall's female approach worked 
and it,

1040
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,170
it is largely the reason that we 
understand chimps today.

1041
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:30,420
On the other hand,
Jane Goodall took the scientific toolkit

1042
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,330
and throughout the rules that had been 
biased,

1043
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:35,880
rather than rejecting the scientific 
toolkit,

1044
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:39,360
which is what the postmoderns are doing,
which I think is just tragic,

1045
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:44,160
what we should be doing is arming 
everybody who goes to college.

1046
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:44,994
And frankly,
we should be arming everybody who can't 

1047
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:51,000
go to college with a scientific toolkit 
that lets them figure out what's true,

1048
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:55,020
especially now because science is the 
ultimate bullshit detector.

1049
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,260
And you know,
this era is,

1050
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,390
you know,
hopefully this is peak bullshit,

1051
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,310
but they need the ultimate bullshit 
detector.

1052
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:02,700
It

1053
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,200
does seem like people share.
Right?

1054
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:08,580
And it seems like that that's one of the
reasons why it's so important for you to

1055
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:11,070
stand your ground is that you,
you are,

1056
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:17,180
you're being very clear in what,
what you perceive the situation to be.

1057
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:19,943
And you,
you're doing it in a very logical and a 

1058
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,000
very rational,
well thought out and,

1059
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,070
and clearly way you're

1060
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,903
showing everyone what's wrong with this.
It is a scientific approach and you are 

1061
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:31,674
literally using the very tools that 
you're trying to empower these young 

1062
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:37,710
children,
young children feel like they are.

1063
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:39,210
Yeah.
He's kid because that kid,

1064
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,460
yeah.
That works.

1065
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,630
Yeah.
Youthful exuberance.

1066
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,000
A human beings.
Millennials.

1067
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:45,960
Yeah.
Millennials.

1068
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:47,200
I hate those words.
Eight,

1069
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,020
those generational terms.
But you're,

1070
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,830
you're,
you're literally using your,

1071
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,650
you're dealing with a dilemma and you're
using the very tools that you would like

1072
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:59,580
them to learn from this university and 
take forth into the world.

1073
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:01,290
I mean,
it is a very scientific approach.

1074
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:02,160
You're,
you're,

1075
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,210
you're saying like,
well,

1076
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:03,541
the,
no,

1077
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:05,820
this is not,
that's not racism.

1078
00:54:05,821 --> 00:54:06,654
This is racism.
And what you're doing here is actually 

1079
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:09,504
racism.

1080
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:10,640
Right.
And in fact,

1081
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:12,230
you know,
the irony is,

1082
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,620
um,
so my students and really my students,

1083
00:54:15,621 --> 00:54:18,680
many of them are both my students and my
wife's students.

1084
00:54:18,681 --> 00:54:19,514
We both teach you evolutionary biology 
and students bounce back and forth 

1085
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,480
between our programs.
So,

1086
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,240
you know,
we have people in our community who are,

1087
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,373
uh,
empowered by having an understanding of 

1088
00:54:30,651 --> 00:54:31,484
how things function evolutionarily.
That gives them a window into all sorts 

1089
00:54:34,581 --> 00:54:36,650
of things including,
you know,

1090
00:54:36,651 --> 00:54:39,560
human social dynamics and other things 
that affect us all,

1091
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,970
um,
all the time.

1092
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:42,590
Uh,
so anyway,

1093
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,790
yes,
there,

1094
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:46,480
there is a way of thinking about,
um,

1095
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:47,563
virtually any of the issues that most 
people care about using scientific 

1096
00:54:51,141 --> 00:54:51,974
rationality,
which does not mean that you put aside 

1097
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:56,930
your humanity,
but it means that you give your humanity

1098
00:54:56,931 --> 00:55:01,550
a tool to understand what is going on 
before you figure out how you feel about

1099
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:02,990
it and whether something ought to be 
done.

1100
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:10,000
How does this university survive this?
How does the community survive this?

1101
00:55:10,311 --> 00:55:11,144
How do these students come out of this 
with a new understanding of what went 

1102
00:55:15,051 --> 00:55:15,884
wrong and in some way that allows them 
to save face and still be a viable part 

1103
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:22,250
of the community at is a beautiful 
question.

1104
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:24,500
Thank you for asking it.
I really hope it works.

1105
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:27,170
I got three things and I'm afraid I'm 
gonna forget one of them.

1106
00:55:27,171 --> 00:55:30,290
But first of all,
there's one clear first step.

1107
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:34,580
The president of the college has to step
down and there are two reasons he has to

1108
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,930
step down.
One,

1109
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:38,440
this is how things work.
I don't like are you moving?

1110
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:41,170
Your hands were talking to,
I'm sorry John microaggressions that

1111
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,420
um,
so he's got to step down because a,

1112
00:55:47,421 --> 00:55:48,254
when something has gone as crazy as 
we've seen things go on evergreens 

1113
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:52,503
campus,
there is an expectation that somebody 

1114
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:56,690
will take responsibility.
So he has to,

1115
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:57,703
he has to step down to signal to the 
world that somebody is taking 

1116
00:55:59,751 --> 00:56:01,880
responsibility.
But in this case,

1117
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:06,710
he also absolutely must step down 
because this is his responsibility.

1118
00:56:06,711 --> 00:56:09,080
He set this in motion and he made this 
happen.

1119
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:14,110
And so it is not an injustice at all 
that he should have to step down.

1120
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,510
And I frankly am flabbergasted that it 
hasn't happened yet.

1121
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:18,463
I do not understand how the board of 
trustees could allow him to maintain 

1122
00:56:21,141 --> 00:56:21,974
that position as long as he,
but first thing is he has to step down 

1123
00:56:27,310 --> 00:56:31,030
at the point he steps down.
That's going to flip a switch.

1124
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,860
Suddenly the question is,
okay,

1125
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:33,783
what now?

1126
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,153
The next thing that would have to happen
is the faculty of my college would have 

1127
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:39,664
to evidence that they actually got 
something out of this rather than 

1128
00:56:42,671 --> 00:56:46,810
feeling that they had been wrongly 
portrayed in the media or something like

1129
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:48,430
that.
If the faculty,

1130
00:56:48,431 --> 00:56:51,310
and there are many good faculty who do 
understand what's going on.

1131
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:52,350
So,
um,

1132
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:53,373
they have been quiet because frankly 
they're afraid of what happens to them 

1133
00:56:56,501 --> 00:56:58,090
if they're not.
But um,

1134
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,373
but George has to step down or be fired 
and the faculty have to rally and 

1135
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:08,020
evidence that they learned something.
And then the third thing,

1136
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,470
and in some ways,
this is the one that is,

1137
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:12,670
I think the toughest.

1138
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,610
They came after me.
They came after two other people,

1139
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:22,090
the chief of police of our police force,
Stacey Brown,

1140
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:24,520
who they have been attempt,
she is a,

1141
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,920
um,
utterly professional,

1142
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,413
extremely good police officer who is 
also an evergreen graduate and 

1143
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:35,280
interested in cleaning up policing.
She wants feet,

1144
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:38,410
she's aware of what bad policing is and 
what the campus police,

1145
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:42,070
campus police we,
so it's independent of the the region.

1146
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:42,963
Right.
Which is why they were stood down 

1147
00:57:43,721 --> 00:57:45,480
because they are part of the 
administration is,

1148
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:50,140
is it has control over them.
But the chief of police was demonized.

1149
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:53,860
And uh,
I mean in the most disgusting way,

1150
00:57:53,861 --> 00:57:57,940
it's posters of her wearing a kkk outfit
in some sort of,

1151
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,320
I dunno why sexed up garb was 
distributed on like,

1152
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:03,310
this is a mother of three.
Right.

1153
00:58:03,311 --> 00:58:04,180
And what,
what was,

1154
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,970
what was the logic behind it?
Well,

1155
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,410
no lie,
I hate to say it,

1156
00:58:08,411 --> 00:58:11,920
but the logic I think was this saying 
that,

1157
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,710
um,
circulates all cops are bad.

1158
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,380
So she was literally her,
uh,

1159
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,910
her,
uh,

1160
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,900
swearing in was protested.
So at the very moment she took the job,

1161
00:58:22,901 --> 00:58:25,970
she was already persona non grata.
Um,

1162
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:27,700
they want no police.
Well,

1163
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:29,320
I knew,
in fact they advocated for that.

1164
00:58:29,350 --> 00:58:31,960
There was in the middle of this protest,
there was a,

1165
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,490
uh,
something like,

1166
00:58:33,491 --> 00:58:35,320
uh,
police community review board.

1167
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,154
I'm not sure exactly what it's called,
but there was some sort of a gathering 

1168
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:38,464
where suggestions about better policing 
were advanced and the protesters 

1169
00:58:41,231 --> 00:58:44,620
actually advanced not only the idea that
the police be moved off campus,

1170
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:46,250
that they'd be disarmed.
Um,

1171
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,223
but that in fact that campus policing be
turned over to what they call community 

1172
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:53,050
policing.
So at the very same moment that you have

1173
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,880
protestors,
uh,

1174
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,033
as judge,
jury and executioner searching cars for 

1175
00:58:59,111 --> 00:58:59,944
people stalking them,
they're telling us that actually they 

1176
00:59:03,401 --> 00:59:06,250
want official control over the policing 
of the campus.

1177
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,320
It couldn't,
it couldn't be more ironic.

1178
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,143
Well,
so how do they plan to handle sexual 

1179
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:12,790
assault,
violence,

1180
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,430
anything along those lines?
Funny,

1181
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:18,010
you mentioned sexual assault because the
third,

1182
00:59:18,011 --> 00:59:22,670
which in addition to me and the chief of
police was at,

1183
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:25,510
is our grievance officer.
Um,

1184
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:28,180
our grievance officer,
Andy Siebert,

1185
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:29,163
um,
is also an excellent human being who is 

1186
00:59:31,881 --> 00:59:32,714
very dedicated to her job and very 
dedicated to evergreen and has been 

1187
00:59:35,001 --> 00:59:35,834
there for a very long time.
And one of the things that she's been 

1188
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:42,330
accused of is not being sensitive to,
um,

1189
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,990
allegations of sexual assault.
Now,

1190
00:59:44,991 --> 00:59:47,060
what she has not said in her own defense
fees.

1191
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:47,923
So I'm interested in protecting the 
college from its own worst instincts 

1192
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,833
that which she has not said in her own 
defense is that she runs a summer camp 

1193
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:01,730
for girls who have been sexually 
assaulted.

1194
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,013
This is the,
and I think she funds it out of her own 

1195
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:05,360
pocket.

1196
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,660
So in all three cases,
in my case,

1197
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:11,780
I'm accused of being a racist in Stacy 
Brown,

1198
01:00:11,781 --> 01:00:12,614
the police chiefs case,
she's accused of being a brutal biased 

1199
01:00:15,351 --> 01:00:16,184
cop and an Andy sieberts case fuse 
accused of being insensitive to people 

1200
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:22,730
who have been assaulted in all three 
cases.

1201
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:25,970
Not only are these things wrong,
they are the opposite of right.

1202
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:27,351
And so,
uh,

1203
01:00:27,351 --> 01:00:28,184
I was just going to say,
the third thing that I wanted to say 

1204
01:00:29,511 --> 01:00:32,450
was,
George has to step down.

1205
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:33,403
The faculty has to wake up and then 
everybody needs to take a look at the 

1206
01:00:37,881 --> 01:00:38,714
fact that three for three,
they've gone after people in classic 

1207
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:47,630
witch hunting style.
And the person in question was the exact

1208
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:49,700
opposite of what they were saying at the
point.

1209
01:00:49,701 --> 01:00:53,060
You discover that you've been hunting 
witches and then it turns out the people

1210
01:00:53,061 --> 01:00:53,894
in question are innocent.
You have to step back and ask yourself 

1211
01:00:56,931 --> 01:00:57,764
how you got there.
How did that happen to you that you 

1212
01:00:59,631 --> 01:01:00,464
ended up hunting innocent people?
That should be a wake up call for 

1213
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:04,550
everybody involved.

1214
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:05,633
Well,
as soon as you start talking about 

1215
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,420
searching for cars and searching for 
individuals,

1216
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:12,420
my mind immediately escalates to 
violence.

1217
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,080
That's,
that's how my mind goes when I know mobs

1218
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:18,010
and I know people and I,
and I'm,

1219
01:01:18,011 --> 01:01:20,550
I'm,
I just have far too much experience with

1220
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:22,980
violence.
And I know what happens when people ramp

1221
01:01:22,981 --> 01:01:26,670
up ideas without a real predetermined 
goal.

1222
01:01:26,671 --> 01:01:28,070
They don't have,
uh,

1223
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:32,820
like what we'd like to do is get Brett 
and talk to them one on one and,

1224
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,753
well,
it's want to invite him to have a 

1225
01:01:34,681 --> 01:01:37,770
debate,
a one on one debate with someone without

1226
01:01:37,771 --> 01:01:40,410
an audience so they could sit down and 
hash out these ideas of,

1227
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:42,060
hey,
you're working with something.

1228
01:01:42,061 --> 01:01:42,990
Well,
how do we find them?

1229
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,003
Well,
maybe he's in one of these cars like 

1230
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:47,140
that.
That's not what they're doing right now.

1231
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,390
They go,
we're going to find him,

1232
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,990
but they don't have a step after they're
going to find you.

1233
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,840
Unless they do.
And it might be fucking barbaric.

1234
01:01:54,841 --> 01:01:55,674
I mean,
it might be,

1235
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,240
you know,
we're going to kidnap him.

1236
01:01:57,241 --> 01:01:58,074
We're gonna,
we're gonna force him to read this 

1237
01:01:59,641 --> 01:02:01,060
letter.
You know what I mean?

1238
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,540
W W it's really hostage.
Shit.

1239
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,220
I,
I agree.

1240
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,020
And I do think,
you know,

1241
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,070
I don't,
I don't know.

1242
01:02:08,071 --> 01:02:13,071
I'm not an expert on what happens when 
mobs ultimately do something.

1243
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:15,870
You know,
like I think it's my shawl con,

1244
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,220
uh,
who was,

1245
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:18,930
uh,
killed by,

1246
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:20,250
by a mob over,

1247
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:22,020
suppose it blasphemy,
uh,

1248
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,450
I guess last month,
but um,

1249
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,560
was that in Turkey?
I thought it was in Pakistan,

1250
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,280
but wasn't in Turkey.
Okay.

1251
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:31,530
Um,
all right.

1252
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,251
I'm sorry.
I should,

1253
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:33,400
that's all right.
But um,

1254
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,520
that's a different,
but in any case,

1255
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:37,320
the world and different,
it's a different world.

1256
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,270
But nonetheless,
the point is a mob,

1257
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,193
a mob thinks that it's on the right 
track and it's so convinced of what it 

1258
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:44,274
believes that uh,
it ends up doing something that it 

1259
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:49,944
doesn't know it's capable of.
And there's also a diffusion of 

1260
01:02:51,691 --> 01:02:54,630
responsibility in the large group.
They're allowed to do much more horrific

1261
01:02:54,631 --> 01:02:55,464
things.
You would ever do one on one to an 

1262
01:02:56,251 --> 01:02:58,050
individual,
100%.

1263
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,940
So I don't think that anyone intends 
that,

1264
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,490
but I'm not sure that they ever do.
Well,

1265
01:03:05,491 --> 01:03:08,010
the ramping up of things is what 
terrifies me.

1266
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:09,143
I just,
I've just seen it too many times where 

1267
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:11,184
people get together in large groups of 
people and things escalate and no one 

1268
01:03:13,501 --> 01:03:14,334
knows why.

1269
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:15,293
And then all of a sudden it's chaos and 
there's an a literal feeling in the air 

1270
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:20,810
that violence could erupt.
And I don't know if there's,

1271
01:03:20,890 --> 01:03:21,723
maybe you would be able to tell me,
is there some evolutionary echo of that 

1272
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:27,990
from back in the day when we would get 
invaded by large groups of people and we

1273
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:31,710
had to switch over immediately to some 
sort of a warlike mindset.

1274
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:32,813
I don't know what it is,
but there's something really bizarre 

1275
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:35,274
that happens to people in large groups.
And if you've ever been in a concert 

1276
01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:42,890
where a riot breaks out or a stampede 
where things go crazy,

1277
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,150
it's scary,
it's terrifying.

1278
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,613
But you're absolutely right about the 
evolutionary roots that these are 

1279
01:03:48,871 --> 01:03:52,590
programs that exist in us for 
circumstances.

1280
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:55,140
And one of the things,
you know,

1281
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,013
if I had been able to give the lecture 
that I proposed in the letter that got 

1282
01:03:59,221 --> 01:04:00,660
me in so much trouble with people.

1283
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:01,993
Um,
one of the things that I would say is 

1284
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:04,044
that the most dangerous thing is that we
have these latent programs that are 

1285
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:10,830
waiting for evidence that it is the 
moment to do x,

1286
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:11,664
y,
or Z.

1287
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:17,070
And because we haven't been in those 
circumstances until the moment,

1288
01:04:17,071 --> 01:04:18,870
those programs are triggered,
we don't even,

1289
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:19,823
we're not even aware that human beings 
are capable of some of the things 

1290
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:25,110
they're capable of.
So we have to guard against these things

1291
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,500
at all costs if we really,
you know,

1292
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:31,860
never again is a very important concept.
And if never again is to mean anything,

1293
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:35,250
we have to understand why it happens in 
the first place so that we can,

1294
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,530
um,
repair the world.

1295
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:39,480
So it becomes impossible.
Yes.

1296
01:04:39,481 --> 01:04:42,390
Instead of giving into the influence of 
these ancient programs,

1297
01:04:42,391 --> 01:04:46,470
understanding that they're there and 
recognizing them when they go live.

1298
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:47,850
Exactly.
In fact,

1299
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:49,370
maybe the thing that,
um,

1300
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,423
would be worth remembering is what 
happens to a drowning person when a 

1301
01:04:54,331 --> 01:04:56,520
person drowns.
They're very dangerous,

1302
01:04:56,970 --> 01:04:58,140
right?
Because they,

1303
01:04:58,170 --> 01:04:59,003
their body switches on a drowning 
program that basically looks for 

1304
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:05,430
anything that can be pushed down so you 
can get up to where are the areas,

1305
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:08,400
which means that somebody can drown,
you know,

1306
01:05:08,401 --> 01:05:12,780
their closest kin by accident because a 
drowning program that they've never seen

1307
01:05:12,781 --> 01:05:16,530
active until the first time they face 
drowning is suddenly online.

1308
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,160
Right.
And so that's

1309
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,620
a simple one.
But there are other ones too.

1310
01:05:20,621 --> 01:05:23,050
There are ones for,
for tyranny and I,

1311
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,123
I believe things like genocide where 
populations that have successfully 

1312
01:05:29,321 --> 01:05:32,860
eliminated other populations have done 
well.

1313
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:33,933
And so knowing that human beings are 
actually wired for genocide under 

1314
01:05:36,971 --> 01:05:39,630
certain circumstances is,
um,

1315
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:41,583
well it's a sobering responsibility,
but it's also hopeful to me because if 

1316
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:45,364
you know that it's there,
you can figure out what triggers that 

1317
01:05:46,781 --> 01:05:47,614
and you can,
I think we can rule it out by raising 

1318
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,484
people in an environment where awareness
of that program allows us to teach them 

1319
01:05:55,570 --> 01:05:57,520
in such a way that that program is 
deactivated.

1320
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,490
And that might be the only way to be 
you.

1321
01:05:59,491 --> 01:06:00,324
You must be aware of the fact that there
is a potential to disassociate and 

1322
01:06:03,361 --> 01:06:04,194
decide that this is the,
that this group of people as the other 

1323
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,650
and that they are not you and you could 
do horrific things to them.

1324
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:15,810
And that this is literally a part of how
human beings evolved to 2017.

1325
01:06:15,811 --> 01:06:16,644
How we got through all the horrific 
things that have taken place in the 

1326
01:06:19,171 --> 01:06:20,004
past.

1327
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:21,500
And if you think about,
um,

1328
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:23,330
the,
uh,

1329
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,423
the religious innovations that have 
occurred in the history of most of the 

1330
01:06:29,601 --> 01:06:33,680
populations on earth today,
they involve a recognition at some point

1331
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:35,300
where,
um,

1332
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:39,140
the definition of self gets broadened to
a larger group.

1333
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:40,910
So if you think about,
for example,

1334
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:43,040
um,
the golden rule,

1335
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:45,200
the golden rule has,
uh,

1336
01:06:45,290 --> 01:06:49,820
has progenitors in the hillel tradition.
Um,

1337
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:54,590
um,
but it is basically somebody saying that

1338
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:58,850
some large entity needs to be treated as
some extension of self.

1339
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:00,560
And really,
um,

1340
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,293
this may sound funny to people,
but if we are to survive the next 

1341
01:07:05,930 --> 01:07:07,460
century as a,
as a species,

1342
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:08,533
it's going to have to be through the 
recognition that actually all human 

1343
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:16,010
beings are trapped on one tiny little 
planet and we're in severe jeopardy.

1344
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,660
And really we have to start treating 
each other not as other because we will,

1345
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:21,643
you know,
we will be fighting each other as the 

1346
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:25,500
whole experiment goes to hell.
Um,

1347
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,400
we have to recognize that we actually 
face a common enemy,

1348
01:07:28,401 --> 01:07:32,510
which is the unintended consequences of 
the system we've built.

1349
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:33,923
I never liked flipped.
Bring up Ronald Reagan as the voice of 

1350
01:07:35,361 --> 01:07:36,171
reason,
but he had a,

1351
01:07:36,171 --> 01:07:37,004
a fantastic quote way back in the day 
and one of his speeches during the cold 

1352
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:42,463
war where he was talking about how we 
would bond together if we were 

1353
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:49,100
approached by some alien life form from 
another planet that threatened us.

1354
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:52,460
How we would all realize that we are,
we are all in this together.

1355
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:53,653
I had no idea that he said that it was a
great speech cause the conspiracy 

1356
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:58,910
theorist went crazy and they're like,
there's aliens man.

1357
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:00,100
Well

1358
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,790
I think this is totally right and here's
the,

1359
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:05,790
here's the even better part I think,
which is,

1360
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:06,803
yeah,
if there was an alien race that came to 

1361
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:10,890
invade the Earth,
we'd rally,

1362
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:12,043
um,
if there was an asteroid that we had 

1363
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:14,424
enough time to know that was coming and 
that we would have to rally together to 

1364
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:18,560
do something about it,
we do something about it.

1365
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:19,813
And so it is perfectly possible for the 
mechanisms that evolution built into us 

1366
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,480
to fight each other.
That caused us to cooperate,

1367
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:27,314
to fight other groups,
to be re targeted at things that aren't 

1368
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:30,524
other groups that are problems.
And so what frustrates me more than I 

1369
01:08:34,071 --> 01:08:39,071
think anything else is right now we do 
face a common enemy.

1370
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:42,350
And that common enemy is,
you know,

1371
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,650
let's say climate change would be one 
facet of it,

1372
01:08:45,651 --> 01:08:48,260
but it's the system that's set climate 
change in motion,

1373
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:49,094
which has also given us nuclear reactors
that are unstable and difficult to 

1374
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:54,950
control.
It's given us,

1375
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:55,833
um,
economic policies that are going to 

1376
01:08:57,021 --> 01:09:01,970
cause us to destabilize as a result of 
the concentration of wellbeing and power

1377
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,700
in a small number of hands.
Those are common enemies.

1378
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:08,270
And if we allowed the circuitry that is 
in us to be triggered,

1379
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:11,900
that allows us to fight a common enemy,
actually we would be quite united at the

1380
01:09:11,901 --> 01:09:14,510
moment and for a good cause,

1381
01:09:14,820 --> 01:09:15,653
which is one of the more disturbing 
things about trump pulling out of the 

1382
01:09:17,521 --> 01:09:19,980
Paris climate agreement.
Is that what,

1383
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,170
what it says is that we're not in this 
together.

1384
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:23,453
I mean,
even more so than it says that these 

1385
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:26,580
guys are,
I mean,

1386
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:31,760
he has advisors in this Epa guy is a 
very dangerous character.

1387
01:09:32,431 --> 01:09:35,790
That's a climate change denier and 
there's so much anti science going on in

1388
01:09:35,791 --> 01:09:36,810
this administration.
You could,

1389
01:09:36,811 --> 01:09:38,310
you wouldn't even know where to begin,
right?

1390
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:39,533
But what are the real problems is that 
we're moving away from this group of 

1391
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:45,950
people that's trying to figure out what 
to do about emissions,

1392
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:47,970
what,
what do we do about all this garbage?

1393
01:09:47,971 --> 01:09:51,450
What do we do about all this ways?
And it's not even necessarily just about

1394
01:09:51,451 --> 01:09:55,110
climate change,
it's about sustainability.

1395
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:59,370
It's about what are we doing with the 
biproduct of civilization?

1396
01:09:59,890 --> 01:10:02,970
If there's one thing that should cut 
across political lines,

1397
01:10:02,971 --> 01:10:03,804
it's that question,
what do we do about the things that 

1398
01:10:05,941 --> 01:10:07,410
jeopardize us all together?

1399
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:10,060
And if it's one thing that should 
disturb us about capitalism,

1400
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:10,923
the number one thing is putting profit 
ahead of the environment that we 

1401
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:16,144
literally need to sustain life.
And that's something they're trying to 

1402
01:10:18,701 --> 01:10:22,660
do with bringing back fucking Cole Cole 
of all things.

1403
01:10:22,661 --> 01:10:25,750
And they have these coal miners on TV 
and they don't even agree with it.

1404
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:26,763
They had that,
they interviewed a bunch of coal miners 

1405
01:10:27,581 --> 01:10:30,660
today that were president trump 
supporters that were at happy.

1406
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:33,550
They voted for trump because he's going 
to bring back coal and they're like,

1407
01:10:33,551 --> 01:10:34,384
well,
I don't know about this.

1408
01:10:35,050 --> 01:10:37,600
Why is he stepping away from the climate
change thing though?

1409
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:41,470
Like even people in the coal mining 
industry or torn on this.

1410
01:10:41,471 --> 01:10:44,380
I mean this is a very dark time in that 
way.

1411
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,210
Very dark.
And you know,

1412
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:48,103
and ironic too,
because I mean we're now behind the 

1413
01:10:50,271 --> 01:10:52,760
eight ball because we've put this off 
for so long.

1414
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,700
We should have started doing this 25 or 
30 years ago,

1415
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:56,534
but even now it is actually not as hard 
as people think to figure out how the 

1416
01:11:01,851 --> 01:11:05,210
world might function that didn't create 
this jeopardy.

1417
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:08,720
As a matter of byproducts of everyday 
activity.

1418
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:12,710
It's actually not that difficult,
but the system is built to frustrated.

1419
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:13,943
So you know,
in the same sense if you step back from 

1420
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:17,153
the last presidential election and you 
think about how is it that we ended up 

1421
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:25,800
with two such lousy candidates for this 
position with such power,

1422
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:30,480
some something in the system has to be 
off that we don't end up with any viable

1423
01:11:30,481 --> 01:11:33,220
candidates for that office.
Um,

1424
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:35,730
and it's the same.
It's the same problem we are,

1425
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:39,930
we are caught in loops that prevent 
proper solution making.

1426
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:43,050
It's not that solution making isn't 
possible.

1427
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:47,880
It's that solution making is not 
someplace we can go from here because of

1428
01:11:47,881 --> 01:11:52,881
a mundane reasons in our system that are
ultimately going to kill us if we're not

1429
01:11:54,211 --> 01:11:54,770
careful.

1430
01:11:54,770 --> 01:11:55,603
Well,
it's also such a complicated structure 

1431
01:11:56,511 --> 01:11:58,220
that outside of completely radical 
change,

1432
01:11:58,221 --> 01:12:00,980
like restructuring everything from the 
bottom up,

1433
01:12:00,981 --> 01:12:04,700
like tearing it down literally to the 
foundation and rebuilding it.

1434
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:05,743
How else are you going to fix this thing
with lobbyists and special interest 

1435
01:12:08,181 --> 01:12:11,060
groups and congressmen,
a representative government.

1436
01:12:11,061 --> 01:12:11,894
It's like there's so many different 
areas that allow for the possibility of 

1437
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:20,090
corruption and an influence and just 
cronyism.

1438
01:12:20,091 --> 01:12:20,924
It's just,
it's such a dark and twisted corridor 

1439
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:26,600
that you enter into if you're 
considering any kind of reform,

1440
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:31,170
well,
it can't be reformed and it's not going.

1441
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:33,320
We can't tear it down either.
I mean,

1442
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:34,670
uh,
well what we do,

1443
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:35,983
well,
that's an interesting question and I 

1444
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,620
must say it's something that,
um,

1445
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:41,990
a number of friends of mine and I have 
been working on for some time.

1446
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,483
There are answers which five,
seven years ago I wouldn't have thought 

1447
01:12:47,091 --> 01:12:49,370
possible that I now believe actually are
possible.

1448
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,000
And so what we're really talking about,
we,

1449
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,860
we can't have revolution.
We can't afford it,

1450
01:12:54,861 --> 01:12:55,694
nor will it work.
The power arrayed against revolution is 

1451
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:01,100
so immense that it's inconceivable that 
it could,

1452
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:05,510
it could function.
We also can't afford a disruption,

1453
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:06,344
massive enough to cause the system to 
restructure on its own if for no other 

1454
01:13:10,611 --> 01:13:14,510
reason than the fact that we've got more
than 400 nuclear reactors on earth today

1455
01:13:14,511 --> 01:13:15,344
that require constant inputs of power or
they melt down and spill not only the 

1456
01:13:19,311 --> 01:13:23,690
contents of the reactors,
but the contents of the spent fuel pools

1457
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:27,020
where we've stored decades worth of 
spent material.

1458
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:28,483
So basically we have to restructure the 
system without letting it collapse and 

1459
01:13:33,141 --> 01:13:35,720
without confronting it in the 
traditional way.

1460
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:40,310
So we need effectively revolutionary 
change without revolution.

1461
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:42,920
However,
notice that,

1462
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:43,953
um,
your life today doesn't look all that 

1463
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:47,684
much like your life 30 years ago from 
the point of view of how you go about 

1464
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,790
things,
how you navigate around the world,

1465
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,790
things sweep across civilization,
um,

1466
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:59,960
in a market system based on utility.
And,

1467
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:01,243
uh,
that model can also be used to replace 

1468
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:08,240
the system that we have currently.
Um,

1469
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:09,074
so in essence,
if you think forward is what is the 

1470
01:14:11,651 --> 01:14:12,484
World gonna look like 20 years from now?
It's very hard to know because you know 

1471
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:18,040
how much change has come in the last 20 
years.

1472
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:21,070
So there will be revolutionary change at
the moment.

1473
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:21,963
It will be dictated by a market and it 
will basically give us more of what we 

1474
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:27,550
think we want rather than what we 
actually need.

1475
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:30,550
However,
the same mechanism that causes,

1476
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,753
um,
technologies to sweep across 

1477
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:33,694
civilization can be utilized to have 
meaningful change in the way we 

1478
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:41,560
interrelate with each other and the way 
we govern ourselves,

1479
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:42,543
sweep across civilization.
So that's the project that we've been 

1480
01:14:46,751 --> 01:14:50,260
working on behind the scenes.
So what is the project like?

1481
01:14:50,261 --> 01:14:52,060
How does it work?
Well,

1482
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:55,450
it involves different people with 
different expertise and,

1483
01:14:55,451 --> 01:14:56,284
uh,
there are those who are expert in the 

1484
01:14:59,291 --> 01:15:01,060
technological aspects.
In other words,

1485
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:01,923
identifying those technologies that 
actually stand a good chance of 

1486
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,340
replacing the dangerous stuff that runs 
civilization.

1487
01:15:09,341 --> 01:15:10,174
Now,
there are those of us who are involved 

1488
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:12,604
in the game theoretic aspects of what it
is that keeps the current system 

1489
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,960
stabilized as it is and what would have 
to change in order to,

1490
01:15:19,961 --> 01:15:22,060
um,
replace it.

1491
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:23,720
Uh,
so anyway,

1492
01:15:23,721 --> 01:15:26,230
it's,
it's a complicated effort,

1493
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,610
but it is not,
I am hopeful in a way that I wasn't,

1494
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:33,700
um,
Mac during occupy,

1495
01:15:33,701 --> 01:15:35,230
let's say,
uh,

1496
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,093
because I no longer think that the only 
route forward is one of the traditional 

1497
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:40,870
modes that we've seen.

1498
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,183
So do you think it's going to be a slow 
integration of technology into people's 

1499
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:45,844
lives,
to the point where it's going to affect 

1500
01:15:48,311 --> 01:15:50,620
the system itself?
To the point where the current system,

1501
01:15:50,621 --> 01:15:53,410
the way it works just won't operate?
The wid does?

1502
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:54,610
No,
not really.

1503
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:55,533
What are you saying specifically?
What I'm saying specifically is that 

1504
01:15:57,641 --> 01:16:02,641
people have been shut out of the gains 
of civilization and they have been fed a

1505
01:16:05,381 --> 01:16:10,381
small portion of the phony growth that 
our system generates to placate them.

1506
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:16,270
They've also been threatened with 
austerity,

1507
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,940
which is largely a false threat.
In other words,

1508
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:21,370
they've been told,
yes we could do something different,

1509
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:25,450
but you're going to have to give up most
of the things that you value.

1510
01:16:25,630 --> 01:16:26,463
So how about it?
And in fact the world could be a very 

1511
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:36,250
exciting place to transform.
Um,

1512
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:38,330
if we,
uh,

1513
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:39,393
work to recognize the real landscape 
that we face rather than the story that 

1514
01:16:43,301 --> 01:16:47,410
has been portrayed that has told us that
we really don't have any good options.

1515
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,810
Um,
it seems that there,

1516
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:52,750
there is still time though,
frankly the clock is ticking.

1517
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:54,303
So like what would be the steps?
It would be taken in order to make this 

1518
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,300
a reality?
Well,

1519
01:16:58,301 --> 01:16:59,680
I'm,
the question is,

1520
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,290
do I want to say that out loud here?
Um,

1521
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:07,320
where the entities that want to oppose 
it and know exactly what it is before it

1522
01:17:07,481 --> 01:17:09,680
comes.
I don't know how as that is,

1523
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:13,310
what I will say is that there are a good
number of us working on the puzzle.

1524
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,580
We're serious about it.
And um,

1525
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:18,720
we are,
uh,

1526
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,930
the things that would typically be used 
to dismiss us a ought not be,

1527
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:26,090
we're not looking to,
um,

1528
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:30,590
to be the head of some system that 
enriches us.

1529
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:35,120
We're looking to make the planet 
function in a way that serves everyone.

1530
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,520
So do you think there's some sort of 
conspiracy to stop this?

1531
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:38,353
Like if you actually bring it up,
you think that there would actually be 

1532
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:40,664
people that would make or take active 
measures in order to hold it off at the 

1533
01:17:44,091 --> 01:17:46,070
pass?
I don't think it's exactly like that.

1534
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,360
I think,
um,

1535
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,960
there is a structure that has emerged 
that exists,

1536
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:57,650
um,
administrations come and go,

1537
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:02,630
but there's a structure that doesn't,
and it seems to have a central principle

1538
01:18:02,631 --> 01:18:03,464
behind it,
which is it doesn't like change that it 

1539
01:18:06,111 --> 01:18:09,350
can't control changes.
One thing change happens,

1540
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:14,351
but it's not interested in change that 
could upend it.

1541
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,823
So anyway,
the reason that we ended up with a 

1542
01:18:18,741 --> 01:18:20,810
battle between,
um,

1543
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:21,501
you know,
uh,

1544
01:18:21,501 --> 01:18:26,501
non-viable Republican and a non-viable 
Democrat is that they have passed a test

1545
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:33,260
in which they do not threaten the 
fundamental structures underneath.

1546
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,213
In fact,
trump may actually be a violation of 

1547
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:36,044
that.
He may actually threaten those 

1548
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:38,690
structures and they may be trying to 
figure out what to do about them.

1549
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,003
Um,
but,

1550
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:41,780
uh,
but in general,

1551
01:18:41,781 --> 01:18:46,781
what we have is a system that filters on
the way towards the levers of power such

1552
01:18:47,451 --> 01:18:50,300
that anybody who gets their wouldn't use
them in a dusty,

1553
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,233
they stabilizing fashion,
which is why we saw the DNC conspiring 

1554
01:18:53,811 --> 01:18:55,730
against Bernie Sanders.
Absolutely.

1555
01:18:55,790 --> 01:18:57,830
We saw them conspire in the most direct 
terms.

1556
01:18:57,831 --> 01:18:58,664
And then we've seen them in court defend
it by saying that had every right to do 

1557
01:19:01,251 --> 01:19:03,020
it rather than denying it.
Yeah.

1558
01:19:03,540 --> 01:19:04,850
Um,
so anyway,

1559
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:05,450
I,
I'm not,

1560
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:09,170
you know,
it's too easy to say conspiracy.

1561
01:19:09,171 --> 01:19:10,004
And it is too,
it's too simplistic because it implies 

1562
01:19:12,501 --> 01:19:15,530
that people got together in a room and 
said things out loud.

1563
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:16,364
And that does happen sometimes,
but it also happens through another 

1564
01:19:18,951 --> 01:19:20,360
mechanism,
a mechanism of,

1565
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:21,383
uh,
but scientifically we would call 

1566
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,493
emergence where those structures that 
frustrate change outcompete structures 

1567
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:33,740
that allow change.
So it may be that what we have,

1568
01:19:33,741 --> 01:19:38,510
our forces that resist change 
reflexively without knowing what they're

1569
01:19:38,511 --> 01:19:40,100
doing the same way,
you know,

1570
01:19:40,101 --> 01:19:42,500
a tree grows towards the light without 
knowing what it's doing.

1571
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:44,660
Oh,
okay.

1572
01:19:44,690 --> 01:19:45,523
Don't you think though,
that there'd be some benefit to 

1573
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:48,343
discussing these potential solutions to 
these issues out loud and then people 

1574
01:19:55,071 --> 01:19:57,100
would sort of like pick it up and act on
it,

1575
01:19:57,101 --> 01:20:00,680
especially given this enormous platform?
I do.

1576
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:01,603
Um,
so it's not that I don't want to talk 

1577
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,100
about them.
I mean,

1578
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:05,870
in fact,
we've,

1579
01:20:05,870 --> 01:20:06,703
we held,
uh,

1580
01:20:07,130 --> 01:20:07,963
uh,
what's called an unconference in Palo 

1581
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:10,860
Alto.
Uh,

1582
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:11,693
several months ago.
So it's not that we don't talk about 

1583
01:20:13,561 --> 01:20:15,930
them out loud.
What I'm concerned about is that a,

1584
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:18,300
I'm only one of the people involved.
And so,

1585
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:20,760
you know,
I have my area of expertise in,

1586
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,140
in this group.
Um,

1587
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,063
but there are many others are areas of 
expertise that I can't speak to as 

1588
01:20:25,411 --> 01:20:26,940
directly.
Um,

1589
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:27,741
so anyway,
I'm,

1590
01:20:27,741 --> 01:20:28,574
I'm concerned about unearthing the thing
in a place where it will be a cartoon 

1591
01:20:33,031 --> 01:20:35,850
version of something that's actually 
more sophisticated than that.

1592
01:20:36,330 --> 01:20:37,570
I understand.
I'm not,

1593
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,810
I'm not averse to,
to answering questions.

1594
01:20:39,811 --> 01:20:41,760
If you got them.
Um,

1595
01:20:41,820 --> 01:20:44,430
what would be the first step?
Well,

1596
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:47,260
the first step would probably involve,
um,

1597
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:52,970
a blockchain currency that had strengths
connected to it that made it,

1598
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,460
um,
competitively superior to something like

1599
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,250
the dollar.
In other words,

1600
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:06,900
the dollar is a flawed entity in 
multiple regards,

1601
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:11,490
but the dollar depends on our valuing 
it.

1602
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:15,480
And the thing about blockchain 
currencies is that blockchain currencies

1603
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:20,700
can be exchanged between entities that 
have an agreement about,

1604
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,220
um,
preferring them.

1605
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,750
So,
for example,

1606
01:21:24,751 --> 01:21:28,070
a group of people could decide to pay 
each other in a,

1607
01:21:28,090 --> 01:21:30,870
in blockchain currency of some kind,
uh,

1608
01:21:30,930 --> 01:21:35,340
based on ideals that are not the same 
ones on which,

1609
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:36,361
uh,
you know,

1610
01:21:36,361 --> 01:21:37,800
our,
our nation for example,

1611
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:38,634
is founded.
So you could agree to a higher set of 

1612
01:21:41,071 --> 01:21:44,280
standards for something and agreed to 
prefer,

1613
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,400
uh,
each other in the context of business.

1614
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:50,430
So you would,
you would do business with those who had

1615
01:21:50,431 --> 01:21:51,264
also agreed to the same higher set of 
principles and that currency could 

1616
01:21:54,811 --> 01:21:56,160
therefore,
um,

1617
01:21:57,240 --> 01:21:59,430
displace something like the dollar.

1618
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:02,160
Well,
it'd be fascinating to see.

1619
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,263
I mean,
I know that bitcoin and blockchain it a 

1620
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:05,634
lot,
a lot of these different 

1621
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:08,970
cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum 
and in fact,

1622
01:22:08,971 --> 01:22:12,890
bitcoin weren't we just talking about 
this is higher now than it has been like

1623
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:14,910
literally in years.
Ever,

1624
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:15,893
ever.
Yeah.

1625
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:17,603
So there's some momentum in that regard.
It'd be nice to see them use side by 

1626
01:22:21,871 --> 01:22:22,621
side,
you know,

1627
01:22:22,621 --> 01:22:23,454
to see if it could be possible that to 
gain more momentum to get to the point 

1628
01:22:27,091 --> 01:22:29,220
where it's you right now,
you bring up,

1629
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:31,290
I'm going to buy something with bitcoin.
People think you're a freak,

1630
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:34,290
right?
I got my friend and Andreas Antonopoulos

1631
01:22:34,291 --> 01:22:35,124
who's a big in the bitcoin movement.
I've had them on the podcast a few 

1632
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:37,764
times.
He's written books on it and he does 

1633
01:22:39,061 --> 01:22:39,894
everything in bitcoins paid in bitcoin.
He buys his airline tickets and bitcoin 

1634
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,390
pays his rent in bitcoin.
I mean he's,

1635
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:46,493
he's deep,
but it's maybe blood is one of a 

1636
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,070
thousand people in the world that might 
do that.

1637
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:51,490
Right?
Um,

1638
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,353
although you know,
everything transformative starts in a 

1639
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,400
small minority of people doing it 
somewhere.

1640
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:58,533
So what I would say is that the 
cryptocurrency isn't enough in and of 

1641
01:23:01,241 --> 01:23:02,074
itself.
You have to couple it with the 

1642
01:23:03,491 --> 01:23:07,270
structures that are capable of the other
problems of civilization.

1643
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,020
So someone figuring out what to do with 
nuclear waste,

1644
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:12,970
that would be a nice one.
That's a Biggie,

1645
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:13,900
right?
That's a big,

1646
01:23:13,901 --> 01:23:18,901
and it's a high on my list of,
of let's say fears,

1647
01:23:19,660 --> 01:23:20,493
is that those nuclear reactors are so 
dangerous by virtue of what it is that 

1648
01:23:24,911 --> 01:23:25,744
keeps them stable day in and day out.
That really if people understood the 

1649
01:23:29,681 --> 01:23:33,610
danger they faced based on those 
reactors and the spent fuel that they,

1650
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,050
um,
they have,

1651
01:23:35,530 --> 01:23:37,210
uh,
people would be alarmed.

1652
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:38,650
Well,
if people just paid attention to

1653
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,680
Mishima,
I mean,

1654
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,770
just look at what's happening and know 
how many of those there are.

1655
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:44,150
And here's the other issue.
You know,

1656
01:23:44,360 --> 01:23:47,330
I've talked to people before and there's
a this,

1657
01:23:48,170 --> 01:23:49,010
I mean it's,
it's,

1658
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:52,790
it's really funny how when you 
subscribed a certain ideology,

1659
01:23:52,791 --> 01:23:56,480
whether it's a liberal ideology or 
whether it's conservative ideology,

1660
01:23:56,481 --> 01:23:57,314
you immediately immediately adopt a 
series of beliefs that go along with 

1661
01:24:00,561 --> 01:24:01,880
that.
And one of them,

1662
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:05,720
and on the right is a,
that nuclear power is clean energy.

1663
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:08,690
You know,
and my argument to that has always been,

1664
01:24:08,990 --> 01:24:09,823
we've only had it for 60 years.
And look how many places you can't even 

1665
01:24:14,901 --> 01:24:16,610
go anymore.
I mean,

1666
01:24:16,910 --> 01:24:19,250
Fukushima,
Chernobyl,

1667
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:22,040
what does it,
three mile island [inaudible] island,

1668
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,650
I don't know.
Three lounds if can you go there now?

1669
01:24:24,890 --> 01:24:26,450
Uh,
I wouldn't go there.

1670
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,673
It'd be the best of those three.
But we also have the wip project in New 

1671
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:31,341
Mexico.
Yeah.

1672
01:24:31,341 --> 01:24:32,174
They're the number of places on earth 
you can just simply no longer go is 

1673
01:24:33,951 --> 01:24:34,784
growing.
And it's places in Nevada where they 

1674
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:37,960
just bury the waste or they just bury 
the waste.

1675
01:24:37,970 --> 01:24:39,690
Hanford,
uh,

1676
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:42,240
just had a huge collapse.
Um,

1677
01:24:42,410 --> 01:24:43,243
so let's put it this way.
We now know how dangerous this 

1678
01:24:46,011 --> 01:24:50,300
technology is and we also know that what
we were told when it was invented,

1679
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,223
I mean everything we were told,
we were told electricity too cheap to 

1680
01:24:53,391 --> 01:24:54,380
meter.
For one thing,

1681
01:24:54,710 --> 01:24:55,543
we were also told we'll figure out what 
to do with the waste and know and not 

1682
01:24:58,461 --> 01:24:59,420
true,
not true.

1683
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:01,080
And here's what's really terrifying.
I mean,

1684
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:02,820
every now and then we,
you know,

1685
01:25:02,821 --> 01:25:03,654
they're digging in Mexico City and they 
find some ancient Aztec ruins and they 

1686
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:08,280
have to stop construction because they 
didn't know it was there.

1687
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,390
What the fuck happens if a hundred years
from now they dig into the Nevada desert

1688
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:13,640
and just tap,
right?

1689
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:13,770
Yeah.

1690
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:17,970
To a chamber of spent fuel rods and kill
everybody.

1691
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:18,983
In fact,
that's one of the problems that they've 

1692
01:25:19,861 --> 01:25:24,120
tried to solve is how do you,
how do you make a sign for people,

1693
01:25:24,150 --> 01:25:24,983
you know,
a thousand years in the future and a 

1694
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:27,833
hundred years.
We have no idea how you would warn them 

1695
01:25:30,631 --> 01:25:31,950
off.
Um,

1696
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:33,570
nor are these things stable.
I mean,

1697
01:25:33,571 --> 01:25:36,480
the thing about the whip project in New 
Mexico is that,

1698
01:25:36,940 --> 01:25:37,773
you know,
this was supposed to be stable for 

1699
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:43,110
thousands of years and we had this 
explosion that leaked plutonium,

1700
01:25:43,530 --> 01:25:45,300
um,
you know,

1701
01:25:45,301 --> 01:25:49,770
after decades the thing was not stable 
the way we were told it was.

1702
01:25:49,771 --> 01:25:51,360
And uh,
so anyway,

1703
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:52,553
we have this terrible problem and what 
to do with the waste we've already got 

1704
01:25:55,021 --> 01:25:55,854
is obviously a huge issue.
Not Making more of it would be a really 

1705
01:25:57,841 --> 01:25:59,310
good idea.
Yeah.

1706
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,173
And um,
there have been some solutions that 

1707
01:26:02,161 --> 01:26:03,290
someone,
uh,

1708
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,801
there,
there,

1709
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:04,220
there was

1710
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,870
a,
a really young kid,

1711
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:06,823
I believe that came out with some 
radical proposal for taking the nuclear 

1712
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:11,864
waste and converting it into energy that
could power cities for thousands of 

1713
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,270
years.
Whether or not it's viable,

1714
01:26:17,530 --> 01:26:20,780
you know,
but I mean it's totally possible.

1715
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:21,860
I mean,
look,

1716
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:22,694
if we've couldn't come,
if someone can come up with nuclear 

1717
01:26:24,531 --> 01:26:27,560
energy in the first place,
the ability to split an atom and power a

1718
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:28,394
city,
maybe it is possible that someone could 

1719
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:31,304
figure out what to do with that way.
Some new sort of radical approach to 

1720
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:37,430
looking at it but can't just leave it.
No,

1721
01:26:37,431 --> 01:26:38,264
you can't just keep doing what we're 
doing over and over again and hope that 

1722
01:26:40,131 --> 01:26:42,080
we don't make more spots where you can't
live.

1723
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,323
Well,
I mean the first thing is there is one 

1724
01:26:45,521 --> 01:26:46,354
thing we can do with it that's better 
that we already have the technology to 

1725
01:26:48,611 --> 01:26:50,710
do and there's no excuse for not doing 
it,

1726
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:54,310
which is that all of the stuff that's 
sitting in pools that has to be actively

1727
01:26:54,311 --> 01:26:58,450
cooled after something like five years.
It can be put in dry cask storage,

1728
01:26:58,720 --> 01:26:59,553
which ain't perfect,
but at least it doesn't require some 

1729
01:27:02,501 --> 01:27:03,334
system to actively keep it from boiling 
over and doesn't need electricity in 

1730
01:27:06,581 --> 01:27:07,990
order to cool it.
Exactly.

1731
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:10,840
The issue that happened in Fukushima,
and that's strictly a matter of money,

1732
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:13,030
right?
We could do that tomorrow.

1733
01:27:13,060 --> 01:27:16,300
We can just require it and we should 
because it's vastly safer.

1734
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:18,280
Um,
we could also potentially,

1735
01:27:18,281 --> 01:27:21,760
there are ways to take the spent fuel 
and to burn it down.

1736
01:27:21,761 --> 01:27:24,160
That does involve other kinds of 
reactors,

1737
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:26,290
but ultimately,
ultimately,

1738
01:27:26,291 --> 01:27:27,124
I can't understand why we have not made 
an immense investment in fusion power 

1739
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,660
where we to discover the ability to make
viable fusion power,

1740
01:27:37,661 --> 01:27:41,560
which I believe we know is possible.
Um,

1741
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:42,423
we not only would be able to power 
civilization without warming the 

1742
01:27:46,001 --> 01:27:48,700
climate,
but we would also be able to pull carbon

1743
01:27:48,701 --> 01:27:51,070
out of the atmosphere if it turns out 
that we need to do that.

1744
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,740
If you have effectively an unlimited 
source of power,

1745
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:54,723
you can take carbon out of the 
atmosphere and you could turn it into 

1746
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:00,100
building materials that were stable for 
thousands of years.

1747
01:28:00,580 --> 01:28:01,413
Um,
and the tiny amount that we spend on a 

1748
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:08,020
fusion research is inexplicably to me.
Yeah,

1749
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:08,780
we're

1750
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,720
gotten way away from the original 
subject,

1751
01:28:11,721 --> 01:28:13,700
but I think this is all very important 
stuff.

1752
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:16,430
But I wanted to talk to you about 
evolutionary biology.

1753
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:19,220
All right.
And being a,

1754
01:28:19,221 --> 01:28:24,221
someone who teaches that and being as 
that's your discipline and um,

1755
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:26,870
seeing all of these,
I mean,

1756
01:28:26,871 --> 01:28:27,704
what did,
what is it like being a professor and 

1757
01:28:29,931 --> 01:28:30,764
being someone who's studying this stuff 
and then seeing all these weird traits 

1758
01:28:35,631 --> 01:28:40,631
and all these weird personality aspects 
demonstrate themselves in these times of

1759
01:28:41,841 --> 01:28:43,940
crisis?
Like seeing these,

1760
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:44,930
these situations

1761
01:28:45,190 --> 01:28:46,660
you're talking about people?
Yes.

1762
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:48,790
Um,
well that's an interesting question.

1763
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:51,880
I have become fascinated.
I didn't start out studying people,

1764
01:28:51,881 --> 01:28:53,110
but the,
um,

1765
01:28:53,111 --> 01:28:55,210
the longer I proceed in evolutionary 
biology,

1766
01:28:55,211 --> 01:28:58,790
the more interested I am in people.
And um,

1767
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:02,940
let's put it this way.
Something is surprising,

1768
01:29:02,941 --> 01:29:03,774
but in general,
if you have the right tools to 

1769
01:29:05,731 --> 01:29:07,710
understand people at an evolutionary 
level,

1770
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:11,400
things make a certain amount of sense.
They are,

1771
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,800
I have something I say to students 
frequently,

1772
01:29:13,801 --> 01:29:17,340
which is if a situation is confusing 
with people,

1773
01:29:17,550 --> 01:29:18,383
very often it makes more sense if you 
turn the sound all the way down so you 

1774
01:29:22,021 --> 01:29:22,854
can't hear what they're actually saying.
Because very often what's being enacted 

1775
01:29:26,221 --> 01:29:30,120
between people isn't really about the 
content of what they're saying.

1776
01:29:30,121 --> 01:29:33,630
It's about something else.
And so let's take for example,

1777
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:35,203
um,
my first project when I was an 

1778
01:29:36,811 --> 01:29:38,430
undergraduate,
I was studying with,

1779
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,293
uh,
a very famous evolutionary biologist 

1780
01:29:41,131 --> 01:29:42,090
named Bob Trevor's.

1781
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:43,433
And,
uh,

1782
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:45,870
I wrote a paper for,
for his class.

1783
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:49,350
Um,
and it was about the Holocaust.

1784
01:29:49,470 --> 01:29:53,700
It was about the really,
I was testing the question at the time.

1785
01:29:53,701 --> 01:29:57,990
It was relatively commonplace to hear 
that Hitler was insane.

1786
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:01,950
And something about that didn't ring 
true to me.

1787
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:04,470
And I wanted to know,
evolutionarily speaking,

1788
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:08,040
was he insane?
And in studying that question,

1789
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:11,250
it became very clear that insane was the
wrong description,

1790
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:12,413
that he was a monster,
but he was a rational monster from the 

1791
01:30:15,511 --> 01:30:19,010
point of view of advancing,
um,

1792
01:30:19,470 --> 01:30:20,303
German jeans.
And that was a very troubling discovery 

1793
01:30:23,341 --> 01:30:24,840
to me that,
um,

1794
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:29,520
in effect what he was doing was,
uh,

1795
01:30:29,620 --> 01:30:34,620
I mean it's the worst thing imaginable,
but from the point of view of genes that

1796
01:30:36,331 --> 01:30:40,800
are attempting to spread across the 
globe and exclude alternative genes from

1797
01:30:40,801 --> 01:30:43,560
access to resources,
it was perfectly reasonable.

1798
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:44,423
Not only what he did to,
to Jews and homosexuals and Jehovah's 

1799
01:30:48,661 --> 01:30:50,040
Witnesses,
but,

1800
01:30:50,130 --> 01:30:51,900
um,
the military plan,

1801
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:54,030
the future of Germany lies in Russia.

1802
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,800
The idea was that this was actually a 
sophisticated plan that would have,

1803
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,793
um,
advanced the cause of spreading German 

1804
01:31:02,101 --> 01:31:05,340
jeans a spectacularly had,
frankly,

1805
01:31:05,341 --> 01:31:06,174
so many million Russians not been ready 
to give their lives to turn the German 

1806
01:31:09,811 --> 01:31:13,020
war machine around.
So what I'm saying this,

1807
01:31:13,021 --> 01:31:13,854
this has to be dealt with carefully 
because people hear you say that and 

1808
01:31:15,931 --> 01:31:18,330
they think that you're justifying it.
But you know,

1809
01:31:18,331 --> 01:31:19,164
I'm of course a,
do you know whose ancestors were from 

1810
01:31:22,261 --> 01:31:22,880
Europe?
I,

1811
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:23,713
there's,
there's no part of me that is an Nh 

1812
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,071
anyway,
okay.

1813
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:28,080
With what happened.
Quite the opposite.

1814
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:28,914
But understanding that even though the 
Darwinism that Hitler was deploying was 

1815
01:31:34,471 --> 01:31:38,070
deformed and not,
not accurate and defensible in a logical

1816
01:31:38,071 --> 01:31:39,490
sense,
um,

1817
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:40,523
the plan he was advancing was German 
jeans attempting to take over a larger 

1818
01:31:45,691 --> 01:31:46,524
fraction of the resources the planet 
earth has to offer then they had 

1819
01:31:50,521 --> 01:31:52,260
available to them,
uh,

1820
01:31:52,261 --> 01:31:54,840
at that point in the 30s.
So,

1821
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:56,730
um,
anyway,

1822
01:31:57,090 --> 01:31:59,320
what I'm trying to say is that

1823
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:01,833
there's something that we,
we often teach students first when we 

1824
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:05,374
get to them,
which is called the naturalistic 

1825
01:32:05,951 --> 01:32:06,784
fallacy.
It means that just because something is 

1826
01:32:08,081 --> 01:32:10,480
true doesn't mean it's good that it 
ought to be trail.

1827
01:32:10,750 --> 01:32:11,583
And so discovering the nature of 
something like the Holocaust is very 

1828
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:18,280
important in the sense that it allows 
you to grapple with it logically.

1829
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:20,560
But as you're grappling with it 
logically,

1830
01:32:20,561 --> 01:32:22,930
people want to imagine that you're 
saying it was okay.

1831
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:24,003
And that's the opposite.
There are many things that are true for 

1832
01:32:27,041 --> 01:32:27,874
evolutionary reasons that are completely
unacceptable and understanding what 

1833
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:32,150
those things are,
um,

1834
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,870
gives you a pretty good shot at 
preventing them from,

1835
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:36,610
from unfolding.
It is,

1836
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:40,300
it also really is a problem when 
something becomes taboo to even consider

1837
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,430
or two to look at.
Like you,

1838
01:32:42,431 --> 01:32:43,264
you,
you can't look at the idea that he 

1839
01:32:44,411 --> 01:32:45,244
wasn't insane and that he was in fact 
rational in rationalizing his horrific 

1840
01:32:49,631 --> 01:32:53,140
acts and that there was some sort of a 
plan to it all.

1841
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:55,990
And you would say that even by enacting 
that plan,

1842
01:32:55,991 --> 01:32:59,260
you'd be insane in terms of how you 
think of the world.

1843
01:32:59,261 --> 01:33:01,060
And I think of the world,
like if,

1844
01:33:01,090 --> 01:33:03,350
uh,
we found out that Jamie over here,

1845
01:33:03,351 --> 01:33:06,220
I was thinking about starting a master 
race and killing everybody off,

1846
01:33:06,221 --> 01:33:06,761
we would go,
oh,

1847
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:07,930
Jamie's con sane.
I mean,

1848
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:10,450
that's like the end to say no,
he's not insane.

1849
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:11,493
He has a rational plan.
Like immediately people would want to 

1850
01:33:15,521 --> 01:33:19,570
justify any horrific thing that could 
say about you.

1851
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,010
Yeah.
Just to be clear though,

1852
01:33:21,011 --> 01:33:22,940
Jamie's not doing that right,
Jamie got guy.

1853
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:26,650
Fair enough.
I like sports.

1854
01:33:28,890 --> 01:33:30,750
How to take over,
he's into um,

1855
01:33:30,850 --> 01:33:31,683
but it,
but having taboo subjects or having 

1856
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:35,014
things you cannot consider,
even if you're clearly not a racist 

1857
01:33:37,241 --> 01:33:38,890
person,
even if you're clearing not a person who

1858
01:33:38,891 --> 01:33:40,480
advocates genocide,
the,

1859
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:45,481
the idea that intellectual discussions 
cannot be pursued about specific topics.

1860
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:48,800
Well,
uh,

1861
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:49,863
the first thing,
if you're going to go into evolutionary 

1862
01:33:51,671 --> 01:33:52,504
biology,
especially if you're going to get 

1863
01:33:53,021 --> 01:33:57,640
anywhere near human beings,
you have to really put aside the idea of

1864
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:58,623
taboo in intellectual space.
You have to be able to consider 

1865
01:34:01,391 --> 01:34:04,120
everything because I'm so much of the 
story is,

1866
01:34:04,240 --> 01:34:08,110
you know,
it goes from bizarre to horrifying,

1867
01:34:08,610 --> 01:34:10,390
you know,
and there's also great beauty.

1868
01:34:10,391 --> 01:34:11,224
I mean,
one of the important things to remember 

1869
01:34:13,271 --> 01:34:16,240
is that the evolutionary,
the adaptive process,

1870
01:34:16,241 --> 01:34:21,241
the adaptive evolutionary process gave 
us not only our worst characteristics,

1871
01:34:21,491 --> 01:34:25,240
our tendency to war and to genocide and 
to oppression,

1872
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:27,880
but it gave us our best characteristics 
to our capacity,

1873
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:29,770
to love,
to empathize,

1874
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:33,460
to be compassionate,
to sacrifice for others.

1875
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:37,630
So all of those things are evolutionary 
products.

1876
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:38,980
And you know,
the,

1877
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:39,983
the message I try to convey to people 
when I talk about this is that we have 

1878
01:34:43,931 --> 01:34:44,764
to pick and choose which of the 
evolutionary prod products we want to 

1879
01:34:49,031 --> 01:34:49,864
honor and preserve,
and which of them we wish to bar from 

1880
01:34:53,561 --> 01:34:54,394
the landscape.
And this is really what civilization is 

1881
01:34:56,081 --> 01:34:58,250
about.
Civilization is about

1882
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:02,060
taking the whole spectrum of things that
we're capable of and,

1883
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:03,103
um,
providing a landscape for the ones that 

1884
01:35:04,671 --> 01:35:05,504
are honorable and good,
and making the ones that aren't 

1885
01:35:08,061 --> 01:35:08,894
honorable and good,
so expensive that nobody would consider 

1886
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:11,773
engaging in them.
Now when you're in the middle of this 

1887
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,710
crazy scenario that you find yourself 
in,

1888
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:21,420
um,
and you,

1889
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,041
what,
you know,

1890
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:24,830
what you know about evolutionary biology
and about,

1891
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:25,370
uh,
the,

1892
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:30,370
the mechanisms behind human behavior and
how do you,

1893
01:35:30,531 --> 01:35:32,030
uh,
how do you get back to work?

1894
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:33,853
Well,
I'm lucky in that the freedom than 

1895
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:38,630
evergreen offers me to teach what I 
want,

1896
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:41,180
how I want to,
you can teach outside of the school.

1897
01:35:41,690 --> 01:35:42,870
Well,
I mean,

1898
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:44,083
you'd be surprised.
My contract doesn't even mention 

1899
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:48,590
biology.
I can teach what I want.

1900
01:35:48,591 --> 01:35:52,730
So you could teach like football scores.
I could teach dance.

1901
01:35:52,731 --> 01:35:53,630
I mean,
I really,

1902
01:35:53,810 --> 01:35:55,040
I mean,
I'm not not a good dancer,

1903
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:56,210
so I can't,
but um,

1904
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,640
but I could teach pottery doesn't 
matter.

1905
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:00,013
Now what,
so what that means from my perspective 

1906
01:36:01,491 --> 01:36:02,324
is that I'm able to take the stuff I'm 
intellectually interested in and I'm 

1907
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,700
able to make it my teaching life as 
well.

1908
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:10,700
And that has worked beautifully.
I've really had a great time,

1909
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:11,833
uh,
bringing students in on what I think is 

1910
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:19,661
the cutting edge of evolutionary theory 
and many of them have rallied.

1911
01:36:20,811 --> 01:36:21,870
So,
you know,

1912
01:36:22,370 --> 01:36:23,203
it's a lot like having graduate students
who are deeply interested in the same 

1913
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:30,080
material and are able to play ball 
because you know,

1914
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:31,530
they,
they take on the toolkit,

1915
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:33,350
they learn to use it.
And so anyway,

1916
01:36:33,351 --> 01:36:36,530
but my intellectual life is quite rich 
and it,

1917
01:36:36,680 --> 01:36:39,890
um,
it involves undergraduate students,

1918
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:42,560
which is a pretty unusual,
pretty unusual thing.

1919
01:36:42,561 --> 01:36:45,710
But it does work pretty well.
Um,

1920
01:36:46,190 --> 01:36:49,130
how do you get back to work at your 
school though?

1921
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,270
Oh,
is that what you're asking?

1922
01:36:50,270 --> 01:36:51,110
Yeah,
I mean,

1923
01:36:51,111 --> 01:36:52,880
how does,
does that even happen?

1924
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,070
I,
it's a tough question.

1925
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:56,083
I have to say,
you were confronted with the very real 

1926
01:36:57,651 --> 01:36:59,990
possibility that your days at evergreen 
might be over.

1927
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:01,850
Well,
there's a practical question.

1928
01:37:01,910 --> 01:37:05,360
I don't think they can fire me because I
haven't done anything wrong.

1929
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:06,273
Right.
So that means I can go back to work in 

1930
01:37:10,161 --> 01:37:14,090
the fall and uh,
I don't have another plan.

1931
01:37:14,630 --> 01:37:17,150
I'm on the other hand.
You're saying in the fall like this,

1932
01:37:17,151 --> 01:37:17,930
your,
your,

1933
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:21,380
your school,
how much longer does this semester have?

1934
01:37:21,530 --> 01:37:25,700
Well my you had in June or July,
I unfortunately have a conference that I

1935
01:37:25,701 --> 01:37:26,211
have to,
I mean,

1936
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:27,044
it's not unfortunate that I have it,
but I have a conference that 

1937
01:37:28,851 --> 01:37:29,684
unfortunately interfaces with the end of
the quarter such that I had to wrap my 

1938
01:37:32,451 --> 01:37:33,284
program up early and I met with my 
program for the last time yesterday 

1939
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:39,050
after the campus had closed.
We met in the park again.

1940
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:41,450
Um,
and in the park,

1941
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:43,790
well,
we weren't safe to be on campus,

1942
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:45,920
so we started doing that as an 
alternative.

1943
01:37:45,921 --> 01:37:49,100
How many students?
I am supposed to have 25.

1944
01:37:49,101 --> 01:37:53,510
I have 32.
So who are the extra ones?

1945
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:54,673
Uh,
people who begged to get into the 

1946
01:37:56,041 --> 01:37:58,950
program and I couldn't turn him away.
Ah,

1947
01:37:59,060 --> 01:38:03,620
you're a sweetie.
So now you meet in the park.

1948
01:38:03,621 --> 01:38:04,454
Are you worried that someone's going to 
find out where your meeting and you 

1949
01:38:06,501 --> 01:38:07,550
won't be saved there?

1950
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:11,260
Um,
you know what I mean?

1951
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:12,094
I,
I don't go anywhere without thinking 

1952
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:14,410
about it.
So yes,

1953
01:38:14,411 --> 01:38:15,480
I'm concerned about that.

1954
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:16,413
So it's really gotten that,
that crazy and you in your mind that 

1955
01:38:20,150 --> 01:38:21,470
you,
you have to worry if you will

1956
01:38:21,530 --> 01:38:24,110
going to the supermarket or you have to 
worry if you're,

1957
01:38:25,250 --> 01:38:28,910
I never know what I'm going to encounter
and uh,

1958
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:33,200
you know,
I'm not a big worrier on that front.

1959
01:38:33,201 --> 01:38:36,200
I'm more or less feel like if I 
encounter somebody,

1960
01:38:36,201 --> 01:38:37,034
they're probably going to be upset and 
especially if there aren't a large 

1961
01:38:40,701 --> 01:38:41,534
number of them,
actually I could probably talk to them 

1962
01:38:43,711 --> 01:38:45,710
and get somewhere,
on the other hand,

1963
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:47,833
given what people think is true about me
and what they think the rules are with 

1964
01:38:51,921 --> 01:38:54,170
respect to what they are therefore 
entitled to do,

1965
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,840
I don't know.
I really don't know what could happen.

1966
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:01,160
Wow.
Well what,

1967
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:05,940
what can be done or what should be done 
about some of the,

1968
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:07,283
I don't want to use the term crazy,
but some of the more rambunctious 

1969
01:39:09,841 --> 01:39:12,330
students that are a part of this,
I mean,

1970
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:15,810
it doesn't seem like they're going to 
just change their behavior and,

1971
01:39:15,811 --> 01:39:16,644
and go back to just being a normal,
inquisitive young person trying to 

1972
01:39:21,271 --> 01:39:22,104
figure out the world.
It's like there's so embroiled in this 

1973
01:39:24,211 --> 01:39:29,100
ideology it seems,
and they've given them so much ground.

1974
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:31,320
It's like,
how do you stop this?

1975
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:32,663
And when you,
when you've held the fucking president 

1976
01:39:34,351 --> 01:39:38,970
hostage and told him he can't go to the 
bathroom without representatives of your

1977
01:39:38,971 --> 01:39:43,530
militant group watching and p where does
it go from there?

1978
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:45,540
Well,
um,

1979
01:39:47,730 --> 01:39:50,100
I should say,
I what I said,

1980
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:52,080
uh,
I don't know,

1981
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,660
five,
10 minutes ago probably sounded a little

1982
01:39:54,661 --> 01:39:56,610
utopian.
I'm not a utopian,

1983
01:39:56,611 --> 01:39:57,444
I'm quite,
I think utopia might be the worst idea 

1984
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:00,024
humans ever had.
So what I'm saying should be under 

1985
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,980
arrest or court costs.
Well,

1986
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:08,460
I mean the Holocaust was utopian.
I guess it was right.

1987
01:40:09,090 --> 01:40:11,130
That was the idea.
Uh,

1988
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:13,320
so,
so yes,

1989
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:14,080
that I think,

1990
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:18,430
but most people think of Utopian is like
some moment in time where we all sort of

1991
01:40:18,431 --> 01:40:19,001
like,
oh,

1992
01:40:19,001 --> 01:40:20,380
what are we doing?
Let's work together.

1993
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:21,460
Let's all be nice.

1994
01:40:21,460 --> 01:40:22,210
Right.
Well people,

1995
01:40:22,210 --> 01:40:22,760
I mean,
you know,

1996
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,610
utopia,
utopian ideas of utopia.

1997
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:27,070
Yes.
Well they very practical ideas.

1998
01:40:27,310 --> 01:40:28,143
They think they a,
they think they know enough about the 

1999
01:40:30,521 --> 01:40:34,830
way things work to describe a good state
for things to,

2000
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:35,723
to reach and they tend to focus on one 
thing that they want to make better and 

2001
01:40:38,441 --> 01:40:41,050
ignore all of the harms that will come 
if they engage in it.

2002
01:40:41,051 --> 01:40:42,040
So,
um,

2003
01:40:42,100 --> 01:40:42,701
anyway,
I,

2004
01:40:42,701 --> 01:40:43,534
I'm not,
I'm not a Utopian and what I'm about to 

2005
01:40:47,201 --> 01:40:51,220
say about what could happen at evergreen
is not Utopian in nature,

2006
01:40:51,400 --> 01:40:56,400
but I do think evergreen was,
as you described earlier,

2007
01:40:56,621 --> 01:41:01,621
is really the tip of something.
What happened at Evergreen is so extreme

2008
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:07,140
and the way it looks to the world is so 
preposterous that I do think,

2009
01:41:08,230 --> 01:41:11,800
I do hope that,
that the academy is hitting bottom,

2010
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:15,550
that in seeing this little preview of 
where these things go,

2011
01:41:15,551 --> 01:41:18,520
if they are allowed to,
to evolve their own accord,

2012
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,593
that people will wake up and they will 
realize actually as hard as it is to 

2013
01:41:22,481 --> 01:41:24,490
challenge the stuff,
we have to do it.

2014
01:41:24,491 --> 01:41:26,350
Because if we don't,
this is what happens.

2015
01:41:26,690 --> 01:41:31,030
Um,
now that said on our campus if,

2016
01:41:31,031 --> 01:41:34,180
um,
if we get rid of,

2017
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:35,463
um,
a few bad actors starting with the 

2018
01:41:37,661 --> 01:41:39,270
president,
uh,

2019
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:44,400
and we recognize that we have ended up 
in some new landscape where up is down,

2020
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:51,550
it is also possible that we could find,
uh,

2021
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,670
we could find a new comp kind of common 
ground.

2022
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:55,990
So,
um,

2023
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:56,913
do you think you could find a new common
ground with these students that are 

2024
01:41:58,391 --> 01:42:00,240
screaming in the streets?
Hey,

2025
01:42:00,241 --> 01:42:03,010
hey Ho Ho these racist teachers have got
to go.

2026
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:04,703
I know this is going to sound crazy and 
some people are not going to understand 

2027
01:42:08,551 --> 01:42:09,384
why when you know,
my family and students have been 

2028
01:42:12,631 --> 01:42:13,464
threatened.
I would,

2029
01:42:13,470 --> 01:42:15,210
I would even talk like this and to be 
honest,

2030
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:17,880
I understand why they would say that,
but um,

2031
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:19,373
but the difference is can you talk to 
them in a small group of people where 

2032
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,193
they could be reached because indeed 
many of them are reachable or do you 

2033
01:42:28,381 --> 01:42:30,240
have to talk to the entire mob?
In which case,

2034
01:42:30,241 --> 01:42:31,650
yes.
It's absolutely impossible,

2035
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:35,470
isn't it also a problem in that when 
people dig their heels into the sand and

2036
01:42:35,471 --> 01:42:36,304
they decided this is how things are,
and then even when confronted with the 

2037
01:42:39,581 --> 01:42:40,414
possibility that they may have been 
incorrect or wrong or acted 

2038
01:42:44,381 --> 01:42:45,214
irrationally,
it's very difficult for people to admit 

2039
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:52,261
that and reconcile and step back and 
maybe just self assess.

2040
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:57,490
Um,
somebody has to blaze the trail.

2041
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:58,683
In other words,
I find myself accidentally in the 

2042
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:04,900
position of blazing a particular trail 
of how do you stare down a,

2043
01:43:04,930 --> 01:43:06,490
an accusation of racism.

2044
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:08,980
So someone from that side has to blaze a
trail.

2045
01:43:08,981 --> 01:43:11,750
Somebody from realize,
hey brad,

2046
01:43:11,751 --> 01:43:14,590
it is the opposite of racist.
We're being silly here.

2047
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:18,070
We all have a common enemy and the 
common enemy is real racism.

2048
01:43:18,370 --> 01:43:19,270
Ah,
good.

2049
01:43:19,630 --> 01:43:20,463
And I mean,
this is why I said recognizing that you 

2050
01:43:23,771 --> 01:43:28,750
have been involved in a witch hunt,
that's the moment at which you know you,

2051
01:43:29,020 --> 01:43:29,853
you're either level up or you don't.
When you realize you've been engaged in 

2052
01:43:32,321 --> 01:43:33,154
a witch hunt,
that's the moment at which you can 

2053
01:43:34,031 --> 01:43:38,160
discover there's something fundamental 
that's wrong in my program.

2054
01:43:38,161 --> 01:43:39,700
Somewhere that allowed that to happen.

2055
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:44,120
Maybe that would be a subject someone 
could teach as a course.

2056
01:43:44,150 --> 01:43:47,600
You know,
like how campus ideology goes amuck.

2057
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,030
Absolutely.
How things go amuck.

2058
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:50,883
I mean,
in fact,

2059
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:54,380
uh,
it's not exactly that and it was planned

2060
01:43:54,381 --> 01:43:58,130
long before this protest erupted,
but I'm scheduled next spring to teach,

2061
01:43:58,460 --> 01:44:00,290
uh,
with another professor,

2062
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:05,291
a program on essentially the 
evolutionary origins of human violence.

2063
01:44:06,390 --> 01:44:08,190
Wow.
So when,

2064
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,073
when you think about everything coming,
do you have like a vision in your mind 

2065
01:44:13,891 --> 01:44:15,330
about how everything would,
sort of,

2066
01:44:15,331 --> 01:44:16,164
the dust will settle and this president,
hopefully we'll either resign or be 

2067
01:44:20,041 --> 01:44:20,874
forced out.
And then what do you do with these 

2068
01:44:22,981 --> 01:44:25,920
students that you looked at in the end 
they were screaming at you,

2069
01:44:25,921 --> 01:44:28,380
calling you a racist,
telling you to resign.

2070
01:44:28,410 --> 01:44:31,350
Like how do you deal with that when you 
go back to school?

2071
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:32,333
Well,
I mean,

2072
01:44:33,950 --> 01:44:36,950
if they were willing to listen,
I could deal with it.

2073
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,033
I,
the,

2074
01:44:38,050 --> 01:44:38,883
the thing that is I think,
hard to appreciate from the outside a 

2075
01:44:40,761 --> 01:44:43,610
little bit is that because,
uh,

2076
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:45,193
I know that there's nothing to the 
accusation and because so many students 

2077
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,070
know that there's nothing to the 
accusation,

2078
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:53,473
it doesn't hurt in the same way that it 
would if I had serious doubts about 

2079
01:44:57,771 --> 01:45:01,310
myself in this regard.
So if they were to come around,

2080
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:03,470
um,
you know,

2081
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,510
we,
we could make it happen.

2082
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:06,740
Um,
that said,

2083
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:10,130
that's not the direction things are 
going as of this morning.

2084
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,000
The,
the internal list of the,

2085
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:14,893
uh,
the faculty and staff was headed in 

2086
01:45:17,451 --> 01:45:20,630
exactly the wrong direction.
What is the list like what are they,

2087
01:45:20,650 --> 01:45:22,370
what are they trying to do?
Well,

2088
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:26,240
they imagined that this entire 
catastrophe,

2089
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:27,074
including the closing of the campus 
yesterday and today is the result of 

2090
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:32,234
the,
I think it was six minutes I spent on 

2091
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:35,300
Tucker Carlson.

2092
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:38,420
Yeah.
He got on Fox News.

2093
01:45:38,570 --> 01:45:40,070
You summon the demon.
I mean,

2094
01:45:40,071 --> 01:45:42,260
those airwaves are immoral.
Yeah.

2095
01:45:42,320 --> 01:45:44,810
Yeah.
So have they literally said that,

2096
01:45:44,811 --> 01:45:47,270
that you should not have gone on Fox 
News?

2097
01:45:47,720 --> 01:45:50,690
Oh,
that's beyond that.

2098
01:45:50,810 --> 01:45:51,920
Their point is,
what is this?

2099
01:45:51,921 --> 01:45:52,754
Here we go ever to evergreen state 
faculty demand punishment of white 

2100
01:45:56,331 --> 01:45:59,930
professor who refused to leave on anti 
white day.

2101
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:01,460
Oh,
it's anti white day.

2102
01:46:01,461 --> 01:46:02,830
That's even more interesting.
Yeah.

2103
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:04,423
Wow.
Today I might've came out since we 

2104
01:46:05,331 --> 01:46:08,030
started the podcast too.
I'm not sure when this hit.

2105
01:46:08,930 --> 01:46:09,890
What is it?
The college,

2106
01:46:09,891 --> 01:46:14,740
fixed.com this is describing what's in 
the letter at the contents of the letter

2107
01:46:14,750 --> 01:46:16,130
right here.
Uh,

2108
01:46:16,170 --> 01:46:18,650
I've been tweeted a few times to make 
that a little larger for me.

2109
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:21,360
Okay.

2110
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:24,870
We acknowledge that all of us have power
within the institution.

2111
01:46:25,430 --> 01:46:27,630
Oh.
Who have power within the institution,

2112
01:46:27,631 --> 01:46:30,450
share responsibility for the racist 
actions of others.

2113
01:46:30,690 --> 01:46:33,600
Furthermore,
there's those of us who are white bear,

2114
01:46:33,601 --> 01:46:36,330
particularly large share of that 
responsibility.

2115
01:46:36,360 --> 01:46:39,090
Oh God.
We acknowledge that we have a great deal

2116
01:46:39,091 --> 01:46:39,924
of work to do in order to honor and live
up to the demands made by the student 

2117
01:46:42,631 --> 01:46:44,820
leaders.
The all the students are leaders.

2118
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:47,430
They're leaders.
Like how in Yale,

2119
01:46:47,460 --> 01:46:50,070
the students that stare the

2120
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,900
professor and physically threatened him,
they,

2121
01:46:53,020 --> 01:46:54,420
they were,
they were actually,

2122
01:46:54,840 --> 01:46:57,210
they were given awards where they 
wasn't.

2123
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:59,460
One of them,
like given some sort of a,

2124
01:46:59,550 --> 01:47:02,070
an acknowledgement of like being a 
leader.

2125
01:47:02,330 --> 01:47:04,320
Some people will find that Jameel find 
that,

2126
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:07,950
but we acknowledge we have a great deal 
of work to do in order to honor and live

2127
01:47:07,951 --> 01:47:09,900
up to the demands made by the student 
leaders.

2128
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:10,734
During last week's protests,
we acknowledged that students of color 

2129
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:14,753
and others who are underrepresented and 
underserved had been voicing their 

2130
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:21,504
demands to us for some time through the 
students of color focus groups of 2014 

2131
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:28,343
through their participation in anchoring
the strategic equity plan for November 

2132
01:47:32,391 --> 01:47:34,320
in Cooper Point Journal and blah,
blah,

2133
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:35,154
blah.
And we have not yet truly listened and 

2134
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:37,524
acted.
We acknowledge the students' right to 

2135
01:47:39,031 --> 01:47:44,031
protest and affirm president bridges.
Recent decision not to use the misguided

2136
01:47:44,521 --> 01:47:45,354
language of the current student contact.
What does that current student conduct 

2137
01:47:49,381 --> 01:47:50,214
code to punish the the protesters?
What is the language of the current 

2138
01:47:53,371 --> 01:47:55,180
student conduct code?
Uh,

2139
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:57,940
a hell if I know,
but b,

2140
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:01,420
I believe what they're talking about as 
the president said that,

2141
01:48:01,421 --> 01:48:02,254
um,
that students would not be held 

2142
01:48:03,671 --> 01:48:07,450
accountable for disrupting my class.
And then I believe he,

2143
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:08,343
uh,
agreed to their demand for student 

2144
01:48:10,750 --> 01:48:13,840
authority over any changes to the 
conduct code.

2145
01:48:13,841 --> 01:48:15,700
So they have students who are engaged in
this.

2146
01:48:16,180 --> 01:48:17,013
I hope this is right.
I don't want to say something that's 

2147
01:48:18,371 --> 01:48:19,204
untrue,
but my understanding was that he agreed 

2148
01:48:20,291 --> 01:48:21,120
to that demand.

2149
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:21,953
We vehemently reject the claim.
The students have been violent simply 

2150
01:48:24,841 --> 01:48:27,270
because they have been loud and 
emphatic.

2151
01:48:27,370 --> 01:48:28,203
There is a difference between exercise 
and the right to freely voice and 

2152
01:48:31,111 --> 01:48:31,944
opinion and inciting violence.
And that difference has nothing to do 

2153
01:48:34,651 --> 01:48:37,320
with the volume of forcefulness.
That's not true because they were,

2154
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:39,840
they were upset that he was moving his 
hands.

2155
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,153
Right.
We're calling that aggression and now 

2156
01:48:42,661 --> 01:48:46,800
they're saying that on the other hand,
she children can scream,

2157
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:47,843
I'm calling children from now on.
We support the demands made by students 

2158
01:48:50,491 --> 01:48:51,324
and honor the positive institutional 
change they have already achieved 

2159
01:48:54,931 --> 01:48:56,400
through their protest.
That's hilarious.

2160
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:57,533
Are Most urgent demands below center on 
the safety of those individuals who are 

2161
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:02,910
currently most at risk?
At the same,

2162
01:49:02,940 --> 01:49:05,580
I mean like the professor.
At the same time,

2163
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:09,120
we acknowledge that in weeks and months 
to come our attention,

2164
01:49:09,121 --> 01:49:09,954
we'll need to turn to the larger 
structural issues students have 

2165
01:49:12,091 --> 01:49:12,924
identified in solidarity with students.
We commit ourselves to participating 

2166
01:49:16,801 --> 01:49:17,634
actively and self critically.
And the annual mandatory trainings 

2167
01:49:21,210 --> 01:49:26,210
specified in the memorandum of 
understanding recently signed by the U F

2168
01:49:26,790 --> 01:49:27,623
was UFE staff Flyer.
That's how union United Faculty of 

2169
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:30,833
Evergreen and management bargaining 
teams holding each other accountable 

2170
01:49:34,380 --> 01:49:38,760
when we act in racist ways against our 
colleagues or our students.

2171
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:39,683
Okay,
well then why don't you hold yourself 

2172
01:49:40,561 --> 01:49:41,394
accountable that you act.
We asked to a fucking anti white day 

2173
01:49:44,490 --> 01:49:45,930
that's racist,
right?

2174
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:46,530
But,

2175
01:49:46,530 --> 01:49:48,580
but what's going to happen here is 
there,

2176
01:49:48,590 --> 01:49:53,500
this is going to be intolerable 
reeducation by people who frankly,

2177
01:49:53,510 --> 01:49:55,090
I,
it pains me to say it,

2178
01:49:55,091 --> 01:49:57,610
but they're the most racist people on 
the campus.

2179
01:49:58,450 --> 01:49:59,530
I mean,
that's what this is.

2180
01:49:59,531 --> 01:50:00,364
This is racism.
It just happens to be in an unfamiliar 

2181
01:50:02,141 --> 01:50:03,940
direction,
but it's racism.

2182
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:05,830
And they also are going to be in charge 
of,

2183
01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:08,170
uh,
of sensitivity training here,

2184
01:50:08,171 --> 01:50:10,780
which to me is the height of insanity.

2185
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:13,810
So scroll up a little bit.
In solidarity with students,

2186
01:50:13,811 --> 01:50:14,644
we call for the evergreen this way,
administration to center student 

2187
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:21,514
perspectives in a persistent media 
approach was gobbly Gook to camp 

2188
01:50:26,801 --> 01:50:27,634
approach to the counter that all right.
Narratives that are demonizing 

2189
01:50:30,701 --> 01:50:31,301
evergreen.
Okay.

2190
01:50:31,301 --> 01:50:32,820
Do you have an alt right movement?
Oh,

2191
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:35,080
evergreen.
If I read that correctly,

2192
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:37,390
I am now in the alt right.
Oh,

2193
01:50:37,391 --> 01:50:38,224
you're an ot writer I guess.
So are demonizing evergreen and day of 

2194
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,800
absences specifically.
Wow.

2195
01:50:45,010 --> 01:50:45,843
Persistent media approach.
What is the process that you go in on 

2196
01:50:48,970 --> 01:50:50,710
Tucker Carlson Nets.
That must be it.

2197
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:51,544
Yeah,
so we have to break this down like it's 

2198
01:50:52,691 --> 01:50:54,220
code.
Like we're not even speaking English.

2199
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:57,730
We're reading fucking hieroglyphs here.
Persistent media approach.

2200
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,740
Persistent media pro.
Yeah.

2201
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:00,940
Am I all right?
I might be.

2202
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:02,290
You are now.
I might be.

2203
01:51:02,770 --> 01:51:07,180
People think I am because of it had 
outright people onto these to sa or,

2204
01:51:07,360 --> 01:51:10,420
but then conveniently when I have 
liberals on,

2205
01:51:10,421 --> 01:51:12,040
I'm a fucking raging liberal.

2206
01:51:12,650 --> 01:51:13,483
God dammit.
Take seriously the threats made to the 

2207
01:51:15,461 --> 01:51:17,020
individual community members.
Oh,

2208
01:51:17,021 --> 01:51:20,020
aren't you an individual community might
think you're about to get to me here.

2209
01:51:21,070 --> 01:51:24,010
Use available institutional resources to
protect them.

2210
01:51:24,220 --> 01:51:25,053
Demonstrate Accountability by pursuing a
disciplinary investigation against Bret 

2211
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:35,850
Weinstein according to guidelines and 
the social contract con contact contract

2212
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:38,980
rather,
and faculty handbook.

2213
01:51:38,981 --> 01:51:39,814
Weinstein has endangered faculty staffs 
and students making them targets of 

2214
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:47,403
white supremacists backlash by 
promulgating misinformation in public 

2215
01:51:51,731 --> 01:51:55,780
emails on national television and news 
outlets and on social media.

2216
01:51:55,930 --> 01:51:58,330
That is a very,
very broad,

2217
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:00,580
you should sue.
That's a hell of a bullet point,

2218
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:02,590
Huh?
You should sue just for that.

2219
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:03,453
Yep.
You have endangered faculty staff and 

2220
01:52:05,801 --> 01:52:06,634
students.
We see the problem with that statement 

2221
01:52:08,321 --> 01:52:09,154
is someone can just read that now and 
and and use that as a quote and just 

2222
01:52:14,141 --> 01:52:16,330
start saying that as if it's fact.
Well,

2223
01:52:16,331 --> 01:52:18,310
let,
let's just lift his deal with this for a

2224
01:52:18,311 --> 01:52:19,144
second.
Can we?

2225
01:52:19,530 --> 01:52:20,363
Okay,
so that is a very interesting bullet 

2226
01:52:23,311 --> 01:52:25,560
point.
The fact is,

2227
01:52:25,890 --> 01:52:29,010
I have gone on,
media media has come to me.

2228
01:52:29,730 --> 01:52:30,563
What I have done is I have pointed to 
videos of the protesters themselves put 

2229
01:52:35,341 --> 01:52:36,174
up that caused the world to say,
what the hell is going on in evergreen 

2230
01:52:40,560 --> 01:52:43,590
and this has resulted,
the entire thing has unfolded.

2231
01:52:43,591 --> 01:52:45,980
I've been fighting this for a year to 
point out to

2232
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:48,020
my colleagues that they were making 
terrible errors.

2233
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:53,380
This is all the result of reforms put in
motion by president bridges.

2234
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,050
So they are now blaming me and I should 
say,

2235
01:52:57,051 --> 01:52:58,940
I do think there is jeopardy on the 
campus.

2236
01:52:58,941 --> 01:53:02,450
We had a threat yesterday from somebody.
You have no idea how serious it was,

2237
01:53:02,600 --> 01:53:05,660
but I do believe that there's jeopardy 
to people on our campus.

2238
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:06,583
What specifically was a threat?
It was it a threat from a white 

2239
01:53:09,201 --> 01:53:11,970
supremacist group was a threat from uh,
uh,

2240
01:53:12,050 --> 01:53:15,830
a pro protestor group.
Like it wasn't specific,

2241
01:53:15,860 --> 01:53:18,950
but w so what I,
all I can say is that I got,

2242
01:53:18,951 --> 01:53:21,140
what I was told was a transcript of the 
call.

2243
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,770
I cannot vouch for it because I don't 
have access to,

2244
01:53:25,040 --> 01:53:27,320
you know,
somebody could be promulgating a hoax.

2245
01:53:27,321 --> 01:53:28,154
I don't know.
Right.

2246
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:30,740
What it said was that they were coming 
to campus,

2247
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,143
I think with a magnum and they were 
going to kill as many as they could is 

2248
01:53:36,291 --> 01:53:37,980
what they said.
Um,

2249
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,150
they do,
we can play the audio.

2250
01:53:41,210 --> 01:53:42,043
Yeah.
Okay.

2251
01:53:42,690 --> 01:53:44,150
Put your headphones on.
Let's listen.

2252
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:51,370
Let's hear it fast.
Hello.

2253
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:53,570
Hello.
Dispatch can help you.

2254
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:55,550
Uh,
yes,

2255
01:53:55,550 --> 01:53:59,780
I'm on my way to evergreen university 
now with a 44 magnum.

2256
01:54:00,130 --> 01:54:03,410
I am going to execute as many people on 
that campus.

2257
01:54:03,411 --> 01:54:05,480
If I can get ahold of you.
Have that.

2258
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:08,240
What's going on here?
You've communist scum bag pounds.

2259
01:54:08,540 --> 01:54:11,450
I need a murder.
As many people on our campus is like,

2260
01:54:11,451 --> 01:54:12,800
Hey sir,
just keep it,

2261
01:54:12,801 --> 01:54:15,670
just keep,
just keep your eyes open someday.

2262
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:17,750
Okay.
First of all,

2263
01:54:17,751 --> 01:54:18,860
hey,
that guy's full of shit.

2264
01:54:18,861 --> 01:54:20,150
And he's and amateur,
right?

2265
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:22,580
Because a 44 magnum only hold six 
rounds.

2266
01:54:22,581 --> 01:54:25,430
Mostly.
Maybe five might even be five rounds.

2267
01:54:25,431 --> 01:54:27,980
Or is that a desert eagle?
Is that guy's a bullshit artist,

2268
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:28,993
a 44 magnum.
You don't specify the round or you're 

2269
01:54:30,861 --> 01:54:33,230
going to use,
nor does that weapon make any sense,

2270
01:54:33,231 --> 01:54:35,210
but yeah,
but nonetheless,

2271
01:54:35,211 --> 01:54:36,740
the point is he's dirty Harry.

2272
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,450
He thinks so.
Yeah.

2273
01:54:38,490 --> 01:54:40,140
Right.
Um,

2274
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:41,353
but you know,
I don't want to belittle people's 

2275
01:54:42,861 --> 01:54:44,120
jeopardy.
I have to say,

2276
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:45,623
you might have been crazy and that he 
might have actually been really wanting 

2277
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:49,780
to do that and he could have done it 
right.

2278
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:51,350
And it could happen for sure.
Um,

2279
01:54:51,860 --> 01:54:55,330
I,
I think the jeopardy to people on campus

2280
01:54:55,331 --> 01:54:59,030
campuses real and I live right adjacent 
to campus and I must tell you,

2281
01:54:59,270 --> 01:55:00,103
uh,
I brought my family with me because I 

2282
01:55:01,971 --> 01:55:04,280
don't feel that they are safe there at 
the moment.

2283
01:55:04,580 --> 01:55:05,413
The question is how is it that we have 
reached the point of deciding that this 

2284
01:55:09,321 --> 01:55:13,910
jeopardy is from me?
The horrific,

2285
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:18,470
what they've done is so irresponsible in
releasing that and making it public.

2286
01:55:18,471 --> 01:55:20,560
It's so irresponsible and,
and,

2287
01:55:20,561 --> 01:55:22,700
and so,
so,

2288
01:55:22,760 --> 01:55:23,593
so silly that they don't realize that 
other people are going to see through 

2289
01:55:26,781 --> 01:55:28,370
that so clearly.
Well,

2290
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,910
many of the information and like what 
misinformation,

2291
01:55:32,120 --> 01:55:32,953
what specifically they should be very 
specific when they accuse you of 

2292
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:37,004
misinformation.
They should be very specific if they're 

2293
01:55:39,381 --> 01:55:43,860
going so far as to say that you are in 
somehow or another summoning outright

2294
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:49,040
and making misinformation public on mass
media.

2295
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:51,000
What is that misinformation?

2296
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,360
Well,
I know because I've been watching the,

2297
01:55:53,380 --> 01:55:54,990
the email traffic,
right?

2298
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,740
So their claim,
uh,

2299
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:02,080
is that white people were not asked to 
leave campus,

2300
01:56:02,081 --> 01:56:02,914
that there were only 200 spaces in the 
venue off campus and therefore this was 

2301
01:56:06,791 --> 01:56:09,970
just supposed to be for a small subset 
of people,

2302
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:12,110
which is nonsense.
Um,

2303
01:56:12,490 --> 01:56:15,940
there were only 200 spaces if you want 
it to go to the particular seminars that

2304
01:56:15,941 --> 01:56:17,140
they were holding.
For example,

2305
01:56:17,141 --> 01:56:19,480
the one about why Asians were part of 
the problem.

2306
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:20,713
So they had a seminar on Asians being a 
problem or a presentation of some kind 

2307
01:56:24,221 --> 01:56:26,830
that is really racist I believe.
So.

2308
01:56:27,130 --> 01:56:28,660
Um,
but in any case,

2309
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:29,553
they are conflating the 200 spaces off 
campus with what was actually expected 

2310
01:56:35,021 --> 01:56:37,540
of us.
And it was quite clear.

2311
01:56:37,541 --> 01:56:39,080
In fact,
one of my uh,

2312
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,350
staff colleagues,
uh,

2313
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:45,310
put out an email,
boy time has gone into some weird thing,

2314
01:56:45,311 --> 01:56:46,144
but I think it was last night in which 
he detailed the several emails that we 

2315
01:56:49,331 --> 01:56:52,930
had seen in which the school did ask 
white people to leave for that day.

2316
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,913
So they are,
they are promoting false hoods 

2317
01:56:56,081 --> 01:56:58,840
themselves designed to obscure what's 
going on.

2318
01:56:58,870 --> 01:56:59,703
I think because they finally understood 
that the world doesn't get what they 

2319
01:57:02,351 --> 01:57:03,140
were doing.

2320
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:03,973
Well,
do they not understand that this is a 

2321
01:57:04,731 --> 01:57:06,810
trail that's going to be released like 
that,

2322
01:57:06,820 --> 01:57:09,380
that this is actual data and that this 
data,

2323
01:57:09,381 --> 01:57:13,370
when they accuse you of misinformation 
and then you have all this data and then

2324
01:57:13,371 --> 01:57:14,960
you could just like release it to 
everybody,

2325
01:57:14,961 --> 01:57:15,561
like,
Hey,

2326
01:57:15,561 --> 01:57:16,394
this is the actual emails.
Clearly this contradicts what you're 

2327
01:57:18,711 --> 01:57:20,420
saying.
It makes you a liar.

2328
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:23,460
Right?
Several people,

2329
01:57:23,461 --> 01:57:27,780
in fact,
many people have now started to refer to

2330
01:57:28,170 --> 01:57:33,170
what's going on in the staff faculty 
zone here as a cult.

2331
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:36,230
And I think,
you know,

2332
01:57:36,270 --> 01:57:38,640
on the one hand that could be tongue and
cheek.

2333
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:39,623
On the other hand,
the mechanisms at work that have people 

2334
01:57:44,701 --> 01:57:45,534
doubling down on absurdities rather than
trying to get on the right side of 

2335
01:57:48,571 --> 01:57:51,930
history as quickly as possible.
It is very cold like,

2336
01:57:52,290 --> 01:57:54,980
and um,
again,

2337
01:57:55,020 --> 01:57:55,620
you know,
the,

2338
01:57:55,620 --> 01:57:57,900
you asked me what would have to happen 
for us to,

2339
01:57:57,990 --> 01:57:58,823
to right the ship.
The second one is that my faculty 

2340
01:58:01,141 --> 01:58:05,130
colleagues have to wake up to the fact 
that their belief structure is,

2341
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:06,363
um,
has become bizarre and unrecognizable 

2342
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:11,070
from any normal position.

2343
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:13,980
Very dangerous from the perspective of 
an educator.

2344
01:58:14,190 --> 01:58:15,023
If this is what an educated person who 
has gone through the entire system and 

2345
01:58:18,511 --> 01:58:23,430
now has a job in educating young people,
if this is how you view the world,

2346
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:24,663
this is how you view facts and this is 
how you distort them and then 

2347
01:58:27,870 --> 01:58:31,320
disseminate them to the rest of these 
likeminded folks.

2348
01:58:31,321 --> 01:58:34,230
And it's very bizarre.
Echo chamber that's being rejected.

2349
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:38,020
It was like almost universally outside 
of the,

2350
01:58:38,021 --> 01:58:40,860
the college.
I mean it's not just Fox News,

2351
01:58:40,861 --> 01:58:43,330
it's rejecting.
It's The Washington Post is the New York

2352
01:58:43,331 --> 01:58:44,081
Times,
Hey,

2353
01:58:44,081 --> 01:58:49,081
people are freaking out about your 
situation and recognize very clearly and

2354
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:52,030
very rightly that you are absolutely not
a racist.

2355
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:52,913
Right?
And this is,

2356
01:58:53,050 --> 01:58:53,883
they've been,
this is kind of a lot of what I've said 

2357
01:58:56,831 --> 01:58:57,664
to Jordan Peterson when I had him on,
like they fucked with the wrong person 

2358
01:59:01,060 --> 01:59:01,840
again.

2359
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:02,673
They fucked with the wrong person.
And this is one of the most horrific 

2360
01:59:04,571 --> 01:59:09,571
things about what I find so troubling 
about what I think of as a used to think

2361
01:59:12,011 --> 01:59:15,010
of myself as a progressive.
But what I prompt would I have a problem

2362
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:15,844
with all of this,
is that the left is attacking itself 

2363
01:59:18,791 --> 01:59:20,000
now.
It's like it's,

2364
01:59:20,060 --> 01:59:22,750
it's,
there's no one who's progressive enough.

2365
01:59:23,290 --> 01:59:24,123
No one,
like every single thing you do as a 

2366
01:59:26,351 --> 01:59:27,184
microaggression,
every single thing you do is based on 

2367
01:59:29,170 --> 01:59:31,210
white privilege and therefore you're 
racist.

2368
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,373
And in less,
you somehow or another give up all your 

2369
01:59:34,661 --> 01:59:35,494
money and give up all your jobs.
And there are people who are asking to 

2370
01:59:37,361 --> 01:59:38,440
do that too,
by the way,

2371
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:41,860
because people asking people to give 
their money and put them in black banks,

2372
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:43,450
get them to black people.
I mean,

2373
01:59:43,900 --> 01:59:44,740
we're going crazy.

2374
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:47,100
This is,
this is literally,

2375
01:59:47,310 --> 01:59:48,143
it's not an individual psychosis,
but it's a collective psychosis that 

2376
01:59:51,361 --> 01:59:54,660
we're watching.
And I believe that in literal terms,

2377
01:59:54,661 --> 01:59:57,270
we are watching a kind of group 
insanity.

2378
01:59:57,590 --> 02:00:01,430
Is this a problem with language?
Is in some ways is this,

2379
02:00:01,790 --> 02:00:06,790
is this a problem with influence and 
charisma and people's ability to sort of

2380
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:09,013
change the way others view the world 
with dramatic interpretations of events 

2381
02:00:14,571 --> 02:00:17,210
and,
and things like emails where this is not

2382
02:00:17,211 --> 02:00:18,044
a one on one debate.
There's a real problem with blogs and 

2383
02:00:19,941 --> 02:00:22,040
emails and I've,
I've talked about this several times,

2384
02:00:22,041 --> 02:00:23,930
but it's,
it's worth repeating.

2385
02:00:24,110 --> 02:00:24,943
There's a real problem when someone 
writes something like that specifically 

2386
02:00:27,711 --> 02:00:30,470
about another person like you and just 
writes it,

2387
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:31,393
but you're not there to respond.
So they can write as much stuff that's 

2388
02:00:34,011 --> 02:00:39,011
not true and they could put it all down 
and then it's there and then someone has

2389
02:00:39,021 --> 02:00:40,550
to refute it,
but it's still there.

2390
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:43,250
So you don't even get to refute the 
actual document.

2391
02:00:43,430 --> 02:00:44,263
You write your own and then someone has 
to go and read that at a different 

2392
02:00:46,911 --> 02:00:47,744
location.
It's a real weird way to distribute 

2393
02:00:50,001 --> 02:00:50,834
information and it's contrary to the way
human beings rationally discuss and 

2394
02:00:55,551 --> 02:00:56,510
debate ideas.

2395
02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:58,193
Well,
I would say there are many rules that 

2396
02:01:02,581 --> 02:01:03,414
are written into the way we interact now
that make it possible for this to 

2397
02:01:06,091 --> 02:01:07,590
happen.
Um,

2398
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:10,920
so there was an instance where a faculty
member,

2399
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:12,113
um,
accused those that were challenging any 

2400
02:01:14,071 --> 02:01:18,240
of these equity proposals as being part 
of a racist backlash.

2401
02:01:18,330 --> 02:01:21,240
And she was clearly talking about me 
because I'm the most,

2402
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:22,950
um,
the most prominent,

2403
02:01:23,090 --> 02:01:25,350
uh,
person objects as faculty member,

2404
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:27,680
a white person and no.
Um,

2405
02:01:27,990 --> 02:01:30,330
so anyway,
she says in a faculty meeting that,

2406
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:31,950
uh,
this is a racist backlash.

2407
02:01:32,010 --> 02:01:35,250
And I said to her in front of this 
faculty meeting,

2408
02:01:35,310 --> 02:01:36,143
I said,
somebody might want to check on the 

2409
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:42,050
question of whether or not I'm a racist,
because if you do check on it,

2410
02:01:42,250 --> 02:01:43,970
um,
you will discover I'm not,

2411
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:46,070
and if you don't,
this is going to blow up on you.

2412
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:48,410
And the,
um,

2413
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:50,053
chair of the faculty told me that the 
faculty meeting was not the place to 

2414
02:01:52,881 --> 02:01:55,400
defend myself against accusations of 
racism.

2415
02:01:55,610 --> 02:01:57,800
I said to her,
that's fine.

2416
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:02,170
Where is not the place to level,
to level the accusations.

2417
02:02:02,350 --> 02:02:03,730
But I said,
where is the place?

2418
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,100
And then the faculty member who had made
the accusations said,

2419
02:02:07,101 --> 02:02:10,370
you should not expect there to be a 
venue in which to defend yourself.

2420
02:02:10,371 --> 02:02:12,890
You should just get used to these 
accusations.

2421
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:13,953
In a separate case,
I was told who said that a white guy or 

2422
02:02:17,490 --> 02:02:19,270
it's the same faculty member who made 
the accusation,

2423
02:02:19,271 --> 02:02:20,104
wait a minute,
the person said that you should just 

2424
02:02:23,891 --> 02:02:27,430
accept these untrue accusations.
Yes.

2425
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:29,200
Um,
yeah.

2426
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:30,400
I mean,
was your reaction to that?

2427
02:02:30,430 --> 02:02:31,263
That this is not a place for you to 
defend yourself against racist 

2428
02:02:33,131 --> 02:02:33,964
accusations?
This is a place for you to just eat 

2429
02:02:35,531 --> 02:02:36,280
shit,
right?

2430
02:02:36,280 --> 02:02:38,830
You just have to accept these ideas on a
separate occasion.

2431
02:02:38,920 --> 02:02:40,690
We were also told that,

2432
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:43,670
um,
that to question,

2433
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:46,880
uh,
an allegation of racism is racist.

2434
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:48,590
Oh,
so convenient.

2435
02:02:48,591 --> 02:02:49,000
Yeah.

2436
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,000
We'll try to wrap your mind around that.
One question and accusation of racism is

2437
02:02:54,101 --> 02:02:54,881
racist,
right?

2438
02:02:54,881 --> 02:02:57,820
We have an obligation to believe them.
Wow.

2439
02:02:57,850 --> 02:02:59,980
I know.
I know.

2440
02:03:00,010 --> 02:03:02,590
Wait a minute.
How that is crazy.

2441
02:03:02,591 --> 02:03:03,424
That is like,
that is such stupid back afterwards 

2442
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:06,800
thinking

2443
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,850
it,
uh,

2444
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:08,780
you know,
it's,

2445
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:12,920
it's what the cult mentality sounds like
inside.

2446
02:03:12,921 --> 02:03:15,470
It doesn't understand that when you say 
that to an outsider,

2447
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:18,050
you know,
it simply doesn't add up

2448
02:03:18,140 --> 02:03:22,790
or it's creating a structure that makes 
it impossible to defend yourself because

2449
02:03:22,791 --> 02:03:25,730
these accusations is so preposterous 
that they realize that they have to have

2450
02:03:25,731 --> 02:03:29,120
some sort of a bizarro world structure.
Absolutely.

2451
02:03:29,870 --> 02:03:32,600
Oh my God.
So what does this person tea,

2452
02:03:33,390 --> 02:03:35,490
um,
they teach media.

2453
02:03:36,330 --> 02:03:38,880
So they teach how ironic,
right.

2454
02:03:39,120 --> 02:03:40,790
They teach media.
Um,

2455
02:03:40,860 --> 02:03:41,693
they are currently running a program 
where she's teaching students to make 

2456
02:03:46,081 --> 02:03:51,081
documentaries and that program,
one of the students in the program filed

2457
02:03:51,301 --> 02:03:54,900
a public records request.
Since we are a public college,

2458
02:03:55,170 --> 02:04:00,170
you can request the emails of uh,
faculty and staff,

2459
02:04:01,090 --> 02:04:02,850
um,
if you want them.

2460
02:04:02,851 --> 02:04:03,684
And so she had a student file,
a public records request from my email 

2461
02:04:07,531 --> 02:04:08,364
to make a documentary in her program.
So you've got one faculty member 

2462
02:04:13,650 --> 02:04:14,483
searching and other faculties members 
email through a student looking for 

2463
02:04:18,271 --> 02:04:19,590
evidence of,
I don't know what,

2464
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:20,880
but um,

2465
02:04:21,020 --> 02:04:22,520
evidence of racism.
Well,

2466
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:25,460
presumably God,
yes.

2467
02:04:25,490 --> 02:04:26,323
What little half of a sentence.
And she's going to cut out a contest 

2468
02:04:28,761 --> 02:04:30,890
with a few dot dogs afterwards.
I mean,

2469
02:04:30,891 --> 02:04:33,260
in fact,
if you can separate my letters from each

2470
02:04:33,261 --> 02:04:35,540
other and reorganize them,
I could have said all kinds of things.

2471
02:04:35,541 --> 02:04:36,374
Well,
I think you should have a student ask 

2472
02:04:37,711 --> 02:04:38,040
for,

2473
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,560
uh,
the emails that came from her.

2474
02:04:40,561 --> 02:04:43,260
I bet they'd be wonderful.
They could be very interesting.

2475
02:04:43,290 --> 02:04:44,123
Oh,
I bet they'd be wonderful if she's 

2476
02:04:45,121 --> 02:04:45,954
telling you that you shouldn't have a 
venue to defend yourself and you should 

2477
02:04:48,331 --> 02:04:51,690
just accept the fact that you're going 
to be called a rate,

2478
02:04:51,720 --> 02:04:55,080
that the idea that she can call you a 
racist in a meeting,

2479
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,380
but you defending yourself against 
racism is not,

2480
02:04:59,550 --> 02:05:01,570
it's not the place for that.
It's not the place for it.

2481
02:05:01,780 --> 02:05:02,780
Um,
and in fact,

2482
02:05:02,781 --> 02:05:06,650
this whole exchange took place with the 
president of the college and the provost

2483
02:05:06,680 --> 02:05:10,430
sitting there silently,
silently didn't say a word.

2484
02:05:10,431 --> 02:05:12,080
He move his hands.
That's really,

2485
02:05:12,081 --> 02:05:14,630
really good question.
Um,

2486
02:05:15,230 --> 02:05:19,400
I don't remember him moving his hands.
I do remember him not releasing an email

2487
02:05:19,401 --> 02:05:22,040
after that meeting saying that in fact,
uh,

2488
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:23,790
on,
uh,

2489
02:05:24,380 --> 02:05:27,440
accusations of racism without evidence 
will not be tolerated.

2490
02:05:27,441 --> 02:05:28,274
He never

2491
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:31,000
pretty God damn important.
It's really pretty goddamned report.

2492
02:05:31,001 --> 02:05:31,834
And then you just can't just w there's,
there are certain hot topics that you 

2493
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:38,100
just got to leave alone.
When someone levels an accusation.

2494
02:05:38,101 --> 02:05:40,590
This is the,
this is the current progressive mindset.

2495
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:44,580
The current like pc gone awry mindset.
Yeah.

2496
02:05:44,610 --> 02:05:47,820
It's fucking crazy.
We're all even,

2497
02:05:47,821 --> 02:05:49,590
we're all human.
That's it.

2498
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:50,903
I don't give a shit where you're from.
I don't care if you're from your 

2499
02:05:52,981 --> 02:05:56,220
ancestors are from one part of the 
planet or right next door.

2500
02:05:56,250 --> 02:05:57,083
It does not matter.
It's who you are and as soon as you try 

2501
02:06:00,041 --> 02:06:00,874
to gain some sort of a leverage position
because of the fact that you think that 

2502
02:06:05,761 --> 02:06:10,350
you have suffered more oppression in 
your family's ancestral history,

2503
02:06:10,410 --> 02:06:11,700
we're,
we're way off track.

2504
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:14,880
We're way off track.
The track should be equality today.

2505
02:06:15,090 --> 02:06:15,923
That should be where we're all on this 
and as soon as someone says you're a 

2506
02:06:18,481 --> 02:06:19,314
racist but you can't defend yourself,
well then we don't have a quality 

2507
02:06:21,571 --> 02:06:22,290
anymore,
man.

2508
02:06:22,290 --> 02:06:23,123
You're trying to have an anti inequality
in order to bring equality to people 

2509
02:06:27,421 --> 02:06:29,130
that have been treated unethically.

2510
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:30,920
Is that what it is?
You're absolutely right.

2511
02:06:30,921 --> 02:06:34,100
It's structural inequity,
which is the irony of the whole thing is

2512
02:06:34,101 --> 02:06:37,310
that people who were wrapped in the flag
of equity,

2513
02:06:37,820 --> 02:06:38,653
um,
I challenged them because I believe in 

2514
02:06:41,241 --> 02:06:45,650
actual equity and I was accused of being
a racist for doing it.

2515
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:48,080
But it also sounds like intellectual 
poverty too.

2516
02:06:48,380 --> 02:06:49,161
It's like the,
the,

2517
02:06:49,161 --> 02:06:49,994
the,
the actual structure of the thoughts 

2518
02:06:52,791 --> 02:06:56,540
that they're presenting are so poorly 
worded and so it's,

2519
02:06:56,690 --> 02:07:01,130
it's so poorly thought out and you're 
not allowed to defend against it.

2520
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,031
Well,
that's the,

2521
02:07:02,031 --> 02:07:04,040
that's what I was saying about the,
um,

2522
02:07:04,070 --> 02:07:04,903
the difference in assumptions and 
beliefs between the postmodern 

2523
02:07:08,751 --> 02:07:10,850
disciplines.
And uh,

2524
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:14,570
dare I say the actual disciplines in the
postmodern disciplines,

2525
02:07:14,571 --> 02:07:18,110
the illogic of those arguments doesn't 
matter because logic isn't a thing.

2526
02:07:18,111 --> 02:07:20,210
It's a tool of oppression.
The,

2527
02:07:21,530 --> 02:07:22,640
well,
that's cute way to just,

2528
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:23,220
yeah,

2529
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:25,260
throw a monkey wrench into the gears.
Could client,

2530
02:07:25,500 --> 02:07:26,333
that's exactly what it is.
And what do they want to achieve out of 

2531
02:07:28,591 --> 02:07:29,424
this?
They just want to achieve all black 

2532
02:07:30,811 --> 02:07:34,710
professors and all white people on their
knees as slaves.

2533
02:07:34,711 --> 02:07:35,351
I mean,
what the,

2534
02:07:35,351 --> 02:07:36,070
what is the ultimate

2535
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:37,000
goal?
You know,

2536
02:07:37,001 --> 02:07:39,190
just people running around fetching 
power adapters.

2537
02:07:40,570 --> 02:07:42,550
Um,
yeah.

2538
02:07:42,551 --> 02:07:43,840
I mean I have to,
again,

2539
02:07:43,841 --> 02:07:47,320
I want to be really careful of the most,
most people of color,

2540
02:07:47,321 --> 02:07:50,320
most black people hold no truck with 
this.

2541
02:07:50,390 --> 02:07:52,150
Right?
They don't want this,

2542
02:07:52,151 --> 02:07:52,984
but a tiny number who do want this or 
maybe think they wanted until they see 

2543
02:07:56,891 --> 02:07:58,480
what it looks like.
Um,

2544
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:01,720
are writing the narrative and that can't
be,

2545
02:08:01,780 --> 02:08:05,590
they're going to undo.
They were going to undo the civil rights

2546
02:08:05,591 --> 02:08:08,320
movement and that can't be allowed.
Well,

2547
02:08:08,350 --> 02:08:11,560
not only that,
the real problem with any of this really

2548
02:08:11,561 --> 02:08:12,394
crazy shit is that it gives fuel to 
actual racists and then it makes actual 

2549
02:08:16,931 --> 02:08:17,764
racist.
Think that these people that are 

2550
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:23,440
involved in these protests as a 
misguided as they are,

2551
02:08:23,590 --> 02:08:25,390
it makes them think that sleek.
Look,

2552
02:08:25,391 --> 02:08:28,240
we told you that these people are bad.

2553
02:08:28,480 --> 02:08:29,081
See,
look,

2554
02:08:29,081 --> 02:08:29,914
we told you that there's a reason why 
they're inferior and it just as soon as 

2555
02:08:34,181 --> 02:08:36,910
you,
as soon as you open the door to that,

2556
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:40,060
I give real problems.
Yeah.

2557
02:08:40,061 --> 02:08:40,894
This plays right into the cartoonish 
fantasies of the absurd left than the 

2558
02:08:45,701 --> 02:08:48,010
right believes in,
which is a tragedy.

2559
02:08:48,100 --> 02:08:49,780
It is a tragedy.
But I will say there's a,

2560
02:08:50,440 --> 02:08:52,720
there's a positive outgrowth of this I 
think,

2561
02:08:53,170 --> 02:08:54,003
which is if I look in my various inboxes
at the stuff that's coming in from 

2562
02:08:57,791 --> 02:08:58,624
people that I've never heard of before,
this wake up call is uniting people 

2563
02:09:04,990 --> 02:09:05,823
across every known fault line.
So I'm getting letters from religious 

2564
02:09:10,721 --> 02:09:12,910
people,
from very conservative people,

2565
02:09:12,911 --> 02:09:13,744
from very progressive people.
Every known fault line is cut by this 

2566
02:09:16,691 --> 02:09:19,420
and people are,
uh,

2567
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:20,583
they are galvanized by seeing something 
that doesn't fit any narrative they've 

2568
02:09:24,971 --> 02:09:25,804
seen before.
That is to say staring down an 

2569
02:09:27,221 --> 02:09:29,350
accusation like this is not common.

2570
02:09:29,740 --> 02:09:32,420
Watching it stared down and,
um,

2571
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:36,010
the world not fall apart is,
uh,

2572
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:37,510
is encouraging.
And then,

2573
02:09:37,511 --> 02:09:38,344
you know,
you mentioned it yourself to have the 

2574
02:09:41,350 --> 02:09:44,530
Wall Street Journal and the New York 
Times on the same page about this.

2575
02:09:44,830 --> 02:09:49,270
That's pretty interesting.
So I do hope that what emerges from this

2576
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:53,590
is that all of the coalitions that 
exist,

2577
02:09:53,770 --> 02:09:56,920
we'll look at themselves and will 
recognize that they have,

2578
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:58,203
you know,
maybe not every coalition has a noble 

2579
02:09:59,741 --> 02:10:00,574
park,
but all of the ones that have a Nobel 

2580
02:10:01,331 --> 02:10:04,510
part will understand that it's paired 
with something that isn't noble.

2581
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:05,613
And I'm hoping that people who find 
themselves ill served by the narrative 

2582
02:10:12,190 --> 02:10:14,930
will join together and that basically,
you know,

2583
02:10:14,950 --> 02:10:17,320
a coalition of the reasonable might 
emerge.

2584
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:19,990
Well,
that's a beautiful hope.

2585
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:22,660
And uh,
I share that hope with you.

2586
02:10:22,661 --> 02:10:23,494
I mean,
I really hope that what's happening is 

2587
02:10:24,881 --> 02:10:25,714
that in these insulated environments of 
these universities and colleges where 

2588
02:10:29,021 --> 02:10:29,854
things just get crazy,
that when word leaks out that they get 

2589
02:10:32,141 --> 02:10:34,190
crazy.
It's very much like cults.

2590
02:10:34,550 --> 02:10:36,110
When you hear about Jones town,
you're like,

2591
02:10:36,111 --> 02:10:38,030
hey man,
don't drink the fucking Koolaid.

2592
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:38,923
Something's going on down there.
But these group mindsets that people 

2593
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:44,870
fall into,
you know,

2594
02:10:44,871 --> 02:10:46,850
oftentimes when you're,
you,

2595
02:10:46,851 --> 02:10:49,490
when you're in the hive and you're in 
the middle of it,

2596
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,200
it can all be very,
very confusing.

2597
02:10:51,650 --> 02:10:52,483
My hope is that as more people find out 
about the preposterous behavior that's 

2598
02:10:57,621 --> 02:11:00,200
going on in these universities and 
colleges and how people are,

2599
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:01,633
I mean these are young people that don't
have a fully formed frontal cortex and 

2600
02:11:04,701 --> 02:11:06,960
are about to enter into the world and 
they're,

2601
02:11:06,961 --> 02:11:07,794
they're doing this with this ridiculous 
momentum of these silly ideas and 

2602
02:11:11,811 --> 02:11:14,750
there's people that want to enforce that
more and more and that these people,

2603
02:11:14,751 --> 02:11:19,751
some of them are actually professors at 
the very college where this is going on.

2604
02:11:20,240 --> 02:11:25,070
I mean that to me is one of the weirder 
aspects of it and one of the things that

2605
02:11:25,130 --> 02:11:25,963
scares people a lot is the idea that 
these people are going to live in these 

2606
02:11:29,361 --> 02:11:30,194
insulated environments and then they're 
going to go and get their graduate 

2607
02:11:32,211 --> 02:11:34,820
degree and then they're going to start 
teaching and then they're gonna go right

2608
02:11:34,821 --> 02:11:35,654
back with these same ideas in this 
insulated environment and never really 

2609
02:11:38,901 --> 02:11:39,734
go out into the world where the 
marketplace of ideas is roundly 

2610
02:11:42,711 --> 02:11:43,310
rejected.

2611
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:44,143
A lot of these notions that they're 
trying to pass off through logic and 

2612
02:11:46,731 --> 02:11:50,690
debate and actual discourse,
not through shutting people down because

2613
02:11:50,691 --> 02:11:53,060
of the color of their skin or lack of,
or,

2614
02:11:53,061 --> 02:11:54,740
you know,
excess amount of Melanin.

2615
02:11:54,770 --> 02:11:55,603
I mean,
that's not,

2616
02:11:56,090 --> 02:11:59,600
that's not how human beings should be 
behaving in 2017.

2617
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:00,434
It's just not.
So when you see it so evident and so 

2618
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:04,184
prominent and so,
so commonplace in universities and 

2619
02:12:07,611 --> 02:12:08,444
colleges,
there's so many people on the outside 

2620
02:12:10,821 --> 02:12:11,654
looking back,
looking in at this rather are baffled 

2621
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:18,590
and for the first time enraged.

2622
02:12:18,740 --> 02:12:19,740
Huh?
Well,

2623
02:12:19,741 --> 02:12:22,470
I think what you just described is 
exactly how this happened.

2624
02:12:22,890 --> 02:12:25,140
The fact that the,
um,

2625
02:12:25,141 --> 02:12:28,050
the critical race theorists and the 
postmodernist are,

2626
02:12:28,180 --> 02:12:31,320
you know,
third generation by now.

2627
02:12:31,590 --> 02:12:32,423
And so this has matured into a movement 
that wishes to reformulate the world 

2628
02:12:37,681 --> 02:12:39,510
according to what it thinks it 
understands.

2629
02:12:39,511 --> 02:12:42,630
But it's so confused about the nature of
reality that,

2630
02:12:42,930 --> 02:12:45,000
um,
that it's just,

2631
02:12:45,030 --> 02:12:46,280
uh,
it's,

2632
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:49,290
it's hard to even describe how 
preposterous it looks as it,

2633
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:51,000
as it tries to emerge

2634
02:12:51,190 --> 02:12:52,023
because they go from t being at the 
university to eventually teaching at 

2635
02:12:55,691 --> 02:12:56,590
that same university.

2636
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,170
Well,
it doesn't have to be the same one,

2637
02:12:58,171 --> 02:12:59,790
but yeah,
they come,

2638
02:12:59,791 --> 02:13:00,624
they come to maturity inside a field 
where these things sound reasonable and 

2639
02:13:04,411 --> 02:13:06,510
then they go on to teach them to 
students.

2640
02:13:06,511 --> 02:13:07,620
And so,
you know,

2641
02:13:08,040 --> 02:13:12,660
the intensity and absurdity grows with,
with each of those generations.

2642
02:13:12,690 --> 02:13:14,620
And I think,
um,

2643
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:17,273
had,
had they been exposed to the real world 

2644
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:23,970
in the context of having to make sense 
in order to make a living,

2645
02:13:23,971 --> 02:13:24,510
which,
you know,

2646
02:13:24,510 --> 02:13:27,570
I'm not,
I'm not a big fan of capitalism,

2647
02:13:28,020 --> 02:13:28,853
but nonetheless,
just even having to interface with the 

2648
02:13:31,290 --> 02:13:32,370
and make enough sense

2649
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:36,720
to get by would enforce a kind of mental
discipline that is not evident here.

2650
02:13:37,950 --> 02:13:38,783
Yeah.
Mental discipline as a good way to 

2651
02:13:39,601 --> 02:13:40,710
describe it too.
I mean,

2652
02:13:40,711 --> 02:13:42,090
it just,
it seems like,

2653
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:44,833
like the,
the idea that not only should there not 

2654
02:13:47,611 --> 02:13:48,444
be 11 level playing field but the,
you should force a playing field that's 

2655
02:13:52,801 --> 02:13:54,800
not level permanently not like,
yeah,

2656
02:13:56,110 --> 02:13:57,120
it's,
it's crazy.

2657
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:01,740
And obviously the world agrees or a good
percentage of it is not even,

2658
02:14:01,741 --> 02:14:04,740
I mean,
I'm sure there's some bias in who writes

2659
02:14:04,741 --> 02:14:05,574
and who doesn't,
but I would actually imagine there'd be 

2660
02:14:06,751 --> 02:14:10,470
some pressure if you were really angry 
with me out in the world to write to me.

2661
02:14:10,740 --> 02:14:13,140
And um,
I don't know.

2662
02:14:13,141 --> 02:14:18,141
I must have a thousand highly supportive
emails.

2663
02:14:18,960 --> 02:14:22,500
Um,
all kinds of emails from amazing,

2664
02:14:22,501 --> 02:14:24,810
interesting people all over the world 
now.

2665
02:14:25,170 --> 02:14:28,440
Um,
and a few angry emails and I think,

2666
02:14:28,980 --> 02:14:32,130
uh,
I don't know if it's three or four angry

2667
02:14:32,131 --> 02:14:35,100
emails and two of them come from inside 
the college.

2668
02:14:35,130 --> 02:14:38,370
Yeah,
I'm sure some of them must be.

2669
02:14:38,371 --> 02:14:41,850
Some of the professors that realize that
this is a fucking sinking ship that's on

2670
02:14:41,851 --> 02:14:44,700
fire.
Like you can't keep doing it.

2671
02:14:44,701 --> 02:14:47,250
Like this is not going to end well.
You can't double down.

2672
02:14:47,251 --> 02:14:48,570
That's what they keep doing.
Well,

2673
02:14:48,571 --> 02:14:50,460
they keep doubledown what,
what,

2674
02:14:50,461 --> 02:14:52,130
so what happens now?
Like what,

2675
02:14:52,131 --> 02:14:52,964
what,
how do you just wait for the dust to 

2676
02:14:54,061 --> 02:14:54,930
settle?
Do you,

2677
02:14:55,860 --> 02:14:58,680
um,
I don't know.

2678
02:14:59,040 --> 02:14:59,873
Uh,
I'm,

2679
02:15:00,710 --> 02:15:01,543
this has never happened to you before.
So this is a very unique moment in your 

2680
02:15:03,421 --> 02:15:04,860
life completely.
I mean,

2681
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:08,190
I'm 48.
So your whole life,

2682
02:15:08,370 --> 02:15:10,560
well,
essentially we should be careful there.

2683
02:15:10,561 --> 02:15:13,920
They've actually been a number.
Nothing like this has ever happened.

2684
02:15:13,921 --> 02:15:14,754
This is the intensity of this.
The national nature of it is all 

2685
02:15:17,281 --> 02:15:18,114
completely unprecedented and uh,
it's pushing both me and my wife to our 

2686
02:15:21,841 --> 02:15:23,220
absolute limit of what we can do.

2687
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:26,820
Just even fielding all of the stuff that
is coming across our desks.

2688
02:15:26,821 --> 02:15:29,430
And all that said,
there is a,

2689
02:15:29,490 --> 02:15:31,530
um,
a precedent,

2690
02:15:31,720 --> 02:15:32,553
uh,
when I was in a freshman and a in 

2691
02:15:34,321 --> 02:15:35,780
college.
Um,

2692
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:36,840
and I've,
you know,

2693
02:15:36,841 --> 02:15:37,674
I've,
I've had battles inside of my field and 

2694
02:15:41,401 --> 02:15:44,820
so at what I would say is that when,
um,

2695
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:51,020
when one has deep principles and one act
based on those principles,

2696
02:15:52,110 --> 02:15:56,580
irrespective of the,
I guess what would be called optics,

2697
02:15:57,060 --> 02:15:59,210
you find yourself,
um,

2698
02:15:59,310 --> 02:16:04,310
the one against the many repeatedly just
by virtue of the way the world works.

2699
02:16:04,590 --> 02:16:08,160
And so this is without precedent in 
terms of the magnitude of it,

2700
02:16:08,161 --> 02:16:08,994
but it's not the first time that I've 
found that just simply proceeding from 

2701
02:16:11,551 --> 02:16:16,551
principals that I'm pretty sure are 
right based on careful work has resulted

2702
02:16:16,681 --> 02:16:17,730
in,
um,

2703
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:20,400
something boiling over in some amazing 
fashion.

2704
02:16:22,350 --> 02:16:23,183
Have you explored the possibility of 
teaching outside of a university or 

2705
02:16:29,621 --> 02:16:29,980
college

2706
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:30,813
structure?
Have you explored the possibility of 

2707
02:16:32,651 --> 02:16:36,910
using new media,
whether it's a online video,

2708
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:37,744
audio text,
and in terms of like publishing things 

2709
02:16:42,311 --> 02:16:45,310
and maybe having a patrion page or 
something along those lines?

2710
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:46,890
Well,
I would love to do it actually,

2711
02:16:46,891 --> 02:16:48,000
because at the moment,
you know,

2712
02:16:48,001 --> 02:16:50,850
the,
the college has been a great place to do

2713
02:16:50,851 --> 02:16:52,580
this because of the,
um,

2714
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:57,620
the unusual teaching model.
But it's becoming less fun.

2715
02:16:58,681 --> 02:16:59,514
I mean,
even if I wasn't at the center of this 

2716
02:17:00,871 --> 02:17:02,050
firestorm,
um,

2717
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:02,933
the,
the rules that are being instituted and 

2718
02:17:04,321 --> 02:17:04,800
the,
you know,

2719
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:06,270
diversity,
uh,

2720
02:17:06,300 --> 02:17:08,760
sensitivity training that's coming and 
all of those lives that,

2721
02:17:08,761 --> 02:17:10,860
what did they make you do buy?
They haven't done it yet.

2722
02:17:10,861 --> 02:17:12,920
We need to learn how to not be racist.
Right?

2723
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:16,210
So they have to assume that you have 
these issues in the first place.

2724
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:17,140
Right?
So they,

2725
02:17:17,440 --> 02:17:18,273
first of all,
why would they ever hire you if they 

2726
02:17:19,631 --> 02:17:22,120
thought that you were discriminatory?
And then second,

2727
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,073
what is going to be done?
Has it ever been proven ever that you 

2728
02:17:25,601 --> 02:17:26,434
can change people through compulsive 
Tori or compulsory re mapping of their 

2729
02:17:32,501 --> 02:17:34,430
brain and antiracist

2730
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:36,583
some sort of a,
what is it like it's like a two day 

2731
02:17:39,141 --> 02:17:40,970
seminar thing.
Like what do they like that?

2732
02:17:41,150 --> 02:17:41,983
Well,
the thing is,

2733
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:44,960
none of this makes any sense because 
let's say this,

2734
02:17:45,440 --> 02:17:46,273
let's say that all white people pick up 
racism from their environment 

2735
02:17:49,611 --> 02:17:51,200
developmentally.
The can't help it.

2736
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:53,390
Um,
so we know you're a racist.

2737
02:17:53,420 --> 02:17:54,253
Wow.
Okay.

2738
02:17:54,260 --> 02:17:56,000
Well,
if we know you're a racist,

2739
02:17:56,180 --> 02:17:57,680
then what's the remedy?
Okay.

2740
02:17:57,681 --> 02:18:02,210
The remedy is going to be some sort of a
sensitivity training.

2741
02:18:02,570 --> 02:18:05,240
Well,
but if sensitivity training works,

2742
02:18:05,270 --> 02:18:06,103
then how do you know,
I haven't already had experiences that 

2743
02:18:07,851 --> 02:18:09,590
have done this for me.
How do you know?

2744
02:18:09,940 --> 02:18:10,760
Right,
right.

2745
02:18:10,760 --> 02:18:11,710
Um,
so the,

2746
02:18:11,750 --> 02:18:15,380
the whole thing is illogical and frankly
I think it's punitive.

2747
02:18:15,410 --> 02:18:16,243
I think,
I think the real purpose is we would 

2748
02:18:17,601 --> 02:18:19,970
like to lecture you and,
um,

2749
02:18:20,810 --> 02:18:21,643
so like that,
in answer to your question about have I 

2750
02:18:23,631 --> 02:18:25,230
considered working,
uh,

2751
02:18:25,250 --> 02:18:26,083
outside the college system,
I've considered it the real question is 

2752
02:18:29,841 --> 02:18:34,841
how to operationalize it so that I don't
strand my family because Evergreen,

2753
02:18:36,200 --> 02:18:39,590
um,
provides a very high quality of life.

2754
02:18:39,591 --> 02:18:43,610
We live well in a beautiful setting,
but it doesn't pay well.

2755
02:18:43,611 --> 02:18:44,444
So we haven't accumulated the resources 
where I can just cut the umbilical cord 

2756
02:18:48,321 --> 02:18:51,350
and go take this stuff to a different 
audience.

2757
02:18:51,620 --> 02:18:52,700
So,
um,

2758
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:54,380
I would love to find a different way to 
do it.

2759
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:56,570
I think are way to do it in the 
meanwhile.

2760
02:18:56,930 --> 02:18:59,510
Like you don't have to leave one to do 
the other.

2761
02:18:59,840 --> 02:19:01,640
Well that's certainly true and I 
wouldn't,

2762
02:19:01,670 --> 02:19:02,503
I wouldn't be averse to starting 
something like that a while teaching at 

2763
02:19:05,571 --> 02:19:07,100
Evergreen.
Um,

2764
02:19:07,460 --> 02:19:08,600
I really hope you do

2765
02:19:09,200 --> 02:19:10,033
cause I think you have some really 
interesting ideas and you're a very 

2766
02:19:11,691 --> 02:19:15,110
smart guy and obviously your heart and 
your mind is in the right place.

2767
02:19:15,111 --> 02:19:18,920
And it seems like before all this boiled
over with this new president,

2768
02:19:19,580 --> 02:19:20,413
things were going the way you would 
enjoy them going this individualized 

2769
02:19:23,931 --> 02:19:24,740
attention,
the,

2770
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:25,573
the freedom to teach anything you,
I mean it sounds wonderful in the hands 

2771
02:19:29,631 --> 02:19:32,240
of the right person and you seem to be 
the right person is beautiful.

2772
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:34,820
No,
I just feel like the whole idea of going

2773
02:19:34,821 --> 02:19:37,190
to a place and learning,
I mean it's,

2774
02:19:37,191 --> 02:19:38,024
it,
it sounds like a great idea back when 

2775
02:19:38,991 --> 02:19:39,824
that was how it had to be done,
but it doesn't take into account the 

2776
02:19:42,321 --> 02:19:45,460
wonderful Internet that we all have.
I mean the,

2777
02:19:45,490 --> 02:19:48,140
the ability that you have now with this 
platform,

2778
02:19:48,141 --> 02:19:48,974
with the amount of attention that's on 
you right now to launch something is 

2779
02:19:51,651 --> 02:19:53,180
really,
you're never going to have anything like

2780
02:19:53,181 --> 02:19:54,440
this ever again in your life.

2781
02:19:54,640 --> 02:19:55,840
Hopefully.
Yeah.

2782
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:59,440
From your mouth to God's ear,
you know?

2783
02:19:59,500 --> 02:20:00,580
Um,
yeah.

2784
02:20:00,581 --> 02:20:01,361
Okay.
Well,

2785
02:20:01,361 --> 02:20:03,100
uh,
I will take that as a piece of advice.

2786
02:20:03,101 --> 02:20:04,720
This is the moment to launch such a 
thing.

2787
02:20:04,750 --> 02:20:05,210
Listen,

2788
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:06,230
do it.
I'll help you.

2789
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:07,220
I'll,
I'll promote it.

2790
02:20:07,221 --> 02:20:08,150
I'll,
I'll tweet it.

2791
02:20:08,151 --> 02:20:09,620
I'll,
I'll put it on instagram.

2792
02:20:09,621 --> 02:20:11,450
I'll put it on facebook.
I'll let people know.

2793
02:20:11,540 --> 02:20:12,440
Wow.
Thank you.

2794
02:20:12,500 --> 02:20:13,400
Yeah.
It's just,

2795
02:20:13,940 --> 02:20:14,773
I think that's the future.
I think the future is people educating 

2796
02:20:18,321 --> 02:20:21,440
anybody.
Like anybody who wants it,

2797
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:22,990
whether you're,
you know,

2798
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:23,893
here or there or do,
you don't have to be in a specific 

2799
02:20:26,001 --> 02:20:26,900
location.
And,

2800
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:32,280
and I think that maybe a lot of this can
be overcome if we don't have these,

2801
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:34,963
these groups of people that like live in
these echo chambers and constantly 

2802
02:20:38,871 --> 02:20:42,920
circulating these same groups that 
reinforce these opinions and,

2803
02:20:42,970 --> 02:20:43,803
and,
and experience all this confirmation 

2804
02:20:44,991 --> 02:20:48,560
bias that makes them believe that this 
is,

2805
02:20:48,620 --> 02:20:49,790
this is all correct.
And the,

2806
02:20:49,791 --> 02:20:50,624
the,
the rest of the world is just 

2807
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:55,190
misinformed and don't understand,
but clearly by that email,

2808
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:59,090
I think that's a big problem is the 
staff itself.

2809
02:20:59,550 --> 02:20:59,820
Okay.

2810
02:20:59,820 --> 02:21:01,020
Yeah.
I don't want to say the staff.

2811
02:21:01,021 --> 02:21:01,854
It's the whoever,
the administrator and a and then some 

2812
02:21:04,321 --> 02:21:05,760
faculty,
they're crazy.

2813
02:21:05,790 --> 02:21:06,623
They're crazy

2814
02:21:06,740 --> 02:21:07,573
calling you.
All right are saying this is all right 

2815
02:21:09,291 --> 02:21:12,590
and that you're racist and 
misinformation.

2816
02:21:12,591 --> 02:21:13,424
I mean,
that is,

2817
02:21:13,940 --> 02:21:15,290
that's slander.
I mean,

2818
02:21:15,291 --> 02:21:16,124
it really is.

2819
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:17,630
Yeah.
Well it's slander.

2820
02:21:17,631 --> 02:21:18,530
It's,
it's also,

2821
02:21:18,531 --> 02:21:20,720
I think it's just worth pointing out 
kind of funny.

2822
02:21:20,810 --> 02:21:21,230
Yeah.
I mean,

2823
02:21:21,230 --> 02:21:23,930
they should have something to back those
claims up.

2824
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:27,740
Those are just empty claims.
They're beyond empty claims.

2825
02:21:27,741 --> 02:21:28,640
I mean,
you know.

2826
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:30,280
Yeah.

2827
02:21:30,280 --> 02:21:32,000
I'm a,
I'm a Bernie Sanders voter.

2828
02:21:32,760 --> 02:21:33,350
Okay.

2829
02:21:33,350 --> 02:21:34,580
If I'm all right.

2830
02:21:35,110 --> 02:21:35,860
Okay.

2831
02:21:35,860 --> 02:21:37,090
Where are they?
Yeah.

2832
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,250
Talk across and tried to say you were a 
hillary supporter.

2833
02:21:39,251 --> 02:21:40,200
You like growing.
I was like,

2834
02:21:40,220 --> 02:21:40,520
no,
no,

2835
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:40,991
no,
no,

2836
02:21:40,991 --> 02:21:41,441
no,
no,

2837
02:21:41,441 --> 02:21:41,921
no,
no,

2838
02:21:41,921 --> 02:21:45,070
no.
What did you just say about me man?

2839
02:21:45,490 --> 02:21:46,323
It just,
have you thought about contacting an 

2840
02:21:47,681 --> 02:21:49,240
attorney?
Uh,

2841
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:53,770
I am getting offers and people are 
contacting me saying I should,

2842
02:21:53,771 --> 02:21:54,604
you should.

2843
02:21:54,620 --> 02:21:56,390
As long as they keep that guy as 
president,

2844
02:21:56,391 --> 02:21:57,224
you should definitely contact an 
attorney and if they're going to put 

2845
02:21:59,301 --> 02:22:00,134
shit like that on the Internet,
because for every person like me who 

2846
02:22:02,211 --> 02:22:03,740
reads it and goes,
this is nonsense,

2847
02:22:04,010 --> 02:22:06,500
there's going to be a possibility of 
someone reading it and go,

2848
02:22:06,501 --> 02:22:08,540
oh,
that Bret Weinstein guy's a racist.

2849
02:22:08,541 --> 02:22:10,350
Oh,
that Bret Weinstein guys all outright,

2850
02:22:10,580 --> 02:22:11,413
oh,
he uses misinformation and in the media 

2851
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:15,013
and he's actively sought out this 
attention and he's doing this to damage 

2852
02:22:18,111 --> 02:22:18,944
the relationship with the schools.
He's doing this out of spite because he 

2853
02:22:20,691 --> 02:22:24,020
was called out for being a racist.
And we have this professor who says he's

2854
02:22:24,021 --> 02:22:26,100
a racist,
and she said it to his face and

2855
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,630
he didn't defend himself.
I mean,

2856
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:29,790
all that kind of shit.
That's how it boils over.

2857
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:30,750
Yup.
No,

2858
02:22:30,751 --> 02:22:31,584
I mean it's clearly,
it's clearly justified and they won't 

2859
02:22:34,651 --> 02:22:37,500
listen to anything else.
I've tried everything else,

2860
02:22:37,501 --> 02:22:38,334
so maybe that's just simply the answer.
I really hope you do something 

2861
02:22:42,181 --> 02:22:43,650
alternative.
I really do.

2862
02:22:43,651 --> 02:22:44,484
Because I think if someone like you who 
has this unprecedented platform where 

2863
02:22:49,321 --> 02:22:50,154
you,
you have been launched into the public 

2864
02:22:51,121 --> 02:22:53,010
eye because so many people are outraged 
about this.

2865
02:22:53,011 --> 02:22:55,900
And I know you were on my friend Dave 
Ruben show and uh,

2866
02:22:55,930 --> 02:22:56,763
you know,
I'm sure there's going to be a thousand 

2867
02:22:57,961 --> 02:22:59,940
other request after people hear this as 
well.

2868
02:23:00,270 --> 02:23:01,103
People,
people don't want this to be the case 

2869
02:23:03,571 --> 02:23:05,580
anymore and they want to do whatever 
they can to stop that.

2870
02:23:05,581 --> 02:23:06,414
And they also want to support people 
that are brilliant people like yourself 

2871
02:23:09,871 --> 02:23:10,704
that have wonderful ideas that we would 
like our kids to learn if they do go to 

2872
02:23:13,561 --> 02:23:14,430
college somewhere.

2873
02:23:14,580 --> 02:23:18,710
We'd like people to be educated in these
unique facets of the world and,

2874
02:23:18,970 --> 02:23:19,803
and,
and to have a platform where you could 

2875
02:23:20,761 --> 02:23:25,761
teach evolutionary biology and uninjured
unshackled by this fucking nonsense that

2876
02:23:27,721 --> 02:23:29,510
you're dealing with our bridge.
Um,

2877
02:23:29,730 --> 02:23:31,680
yeah,
well it's a great idea and uh,

2878
02:23:32,220 --> 02:23:32,881
you know,
I don't know,

2879
02:23:32,881 --> 02:23:33,714
it may be that the unity university 
system is so in crusted with this stuff 

2880
02:23:38,641 --> 02:23:42,030
at this point that it can't be freed.
That's what Jordan Peterson,

2881
02:23:42,031 --> 02:23:44,670
thanks.
I talked to quite a few other professors

2882
02:23:44,671 --> 02:23:45,840
to think that as well.
Um,

2883
02:23:45,860 --> 02:23:47,790
Gad Saad,
he believes that as well.

2884
02:23:47,791 --> 02:23:48,624
I believe it's like there's just a 
certain amount of time left in this 

2885
02:23:50,101 --> 02:23:53,400
system where it's just,
it's so caked up.

2886
02:23:53,580 --> 02:23:56,400
Then maybe the only way to deal with it 
is to abandon it.

2887
02:23:57,200 --> 02:23:58,140
Well then,
and then,

2888
02:23:58,141 --> 02:24:00,260
then we would have to reformulate it.
Yeah.

2889
02:24:00,330 --> 02:24:01,610
Which would be,
you know,

2890
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:02,513
unlike civilization,
the university system could be 

2891
02:24:04,561 --> 02:24:05,394
reformulated.
We could start with a fresh sheet of 

2892
02:24:06,601 --> 02:24:10,010
paper and it's probably very dangerous 
to not have a university system.

2893
02:24:10,030 --> 02:24:11,760
Can't not have it right after.
It's the,

2894
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:14,010
it's the way we figure out what's true.
Right.

2895
02:24:14,011 --> 02:24:19,011
And there's gotta be a way to save it 
while cutting out all these cancers,

2896
02:24:19,201 --> 02:24:20,040
aspects of it,

2897
02:24:20,470 --> 02:24:22,300
or started a fresh,
you know,

2898
02:24:22,301 --> 02:24:23,134
we could,
uh,

2899
02:24:23,200 --> 02:24:24,033
leave the carcass to the postmodernist 
and build something that works outside 

2900
02:24:27,221 --> 02:24:28,330
where we don't have to let them in.

2901
02:24:28,480 --> 02:24:31,360
Then there'll be a whole group of people
just talk about what a piece of shit you

2902
02:24:31,361 --> 02:24:32,194
are.
The locked in some classroom somewhere 

2903
02:24:34,180 --> 02:24:36,760
demonstrating all the different terrible
things that you've done.

2904
02:24:37,210 --> 02:24:39,500
Bring horrible things upon the college.
It's just,

2905
02:24:40,570 --> 02:24:41,403
boy,
it's such a strange world you're in 

2906
02:24:43,751 --> 02:24:44,660
right now.
Uh,

2907
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:46,730
it is really,
it's,

2908
02:24:46,810 --> 02:24:50,110
it's almost more dreamlike than dreams.
Are you sleeping?

2909
02:24:50,490 --> 02:24:52,150
And that's a good question.
I usually,

2910
02:24:52,151 --> 02:24:53,860
I sleep pretty well.
This one,

2911
02:24:53,861 --> 02:24:54,694
uh,

2912
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:57,253
I mean,
partly it's just the number of hours 

2913
02:24:58,791 --> 02:25:03,170
trying to field everything means I go to
bed late and then,

2914
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:06,890
you know,
by the time the sun comes up,

2915
02:25:06,891 --> 02:25:08,780
the question is how much more stuff is 
accumulated.

2916
02:25:08,781 --> 02:25:10,460
So less than I might.
I don't.

2917
02:25:11,670 --> 02:25:12,503
MMM.

2918
02:25:13,560 --> 02:25:17,100
I guess the thing is I'm worried about 
what's going on.

2919
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:20,580
I'm worried about the danger to my 
family that gets in the road of sleep.

2920
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:24,220
I,
I know that what I'm makes sense,

2921
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:27,940
even if my colleagues don't understand 
that.

2922
02:25:28,320 --> 02:25:31,480
Um,
so I'm not getting enough sleep,

2923
02:25:31,481 --> 02:25:35,640
that's for sure.
But I'm also not ripped apart by doubt.

2924
02:25:35,810 --> 02:25:37,490
It's what you've done.
Nothing wrong.

2925
02:25:37,491 --> 02:25:40,460
So you don't have that blanket of guilt.
Like,

2926
02:25:40,461 --> 02:25:43,400
why did I do that?
What could I have done differently?

2927
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:44,271
Right.
You know,

2928
02:25:44,271 --> 02:25:45,104
you're not,

2929
02:25:46,110 --> 02:25:47,580
you're not Kathy Griffin right now.
No.

2930
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:51,390
You know what I mean?
It's so I just,

2931
02:25:51,420 --> 02:25:53,520
I really hope this works out well for 
you.

2932
02:25:53,521 --> 02:25:54,354
And A,
I'll be paying attention every step of 

2933
02:25:55,711 --> 02:25:59,610
the way and if my offer is real,
if you need some help,

2934
02:25:59,611 --> 02:26:02,790
if you decided to put something together
and you need some help promoting it,

2935
02:26:02,791 --> 02:26:03,624
I'd be more than happy to.
And I'm sure there's been a lot of 

2936
02:26:05,221 --> 02:26:07,590
people listening to this and would love 
to hear your ideas on things.

2937
02:26:07,860 --> 02:26:08,371
Great.
Well,

2938
02:26:08,371 --> 02:26:09,660
thank you so much.
Thanks,

2939
02:26:09,661 --> 02:26:10,830
man.
Thanks for coming in here.

2940
02:26:10,831 --> 02:26:11,910
All right.
Really appreciate it.

2941
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:12,773
Yeah,
me too.

2942
02:26:13,680 --> 02:26:14,730
That's it,
folks.

2943
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:16,800
We're done for today.
We'll see you next week.

2944
02:26:16,920 --> 02:26:17,753
Bye.

2945
02:26:26,730 --> 02:26:27,563
Hmm.

2946
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:32,083
Okay.
