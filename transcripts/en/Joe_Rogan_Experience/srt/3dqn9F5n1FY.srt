1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,610
Low Freak bitches and then there was
another time when I had to get permission

2
00:00:05,611 --> 00:00:06,291
to discern bad.

3
00:00:06,291 --> 00:00:07,980
One of my cameramen from the US army,

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,923
Jake,

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,950
camera guy from Australia that I hired
who lives there and I had a decent bet

6
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:16,950
him from the US army because he was
going on a mission with the Afghans.

7
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:17,790
When you say he lives there,

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,920
he lives in Afghanistan.

9
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:19,560
In Kabul.

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,340
Whoa.

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,870
He's a war is a war journalist.

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,490
She lives there all year round.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:23,820
Yeah,

14
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,540
and now he's moving to places
where he can cover isis.

15
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:31,020
He's an interesting guy and so and so.

16
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,440
Jake had to embed with the Afghans and
I had to go meet with a general to get

17
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:37,230
permission to get him in bed
with the Afghans [inaudible].

18
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,190
There was no US forces on the ground
where he was going and it was a place

19
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,090
called the Tangi Valley.

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,260
Very Dangerous Valley.

21
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,290
The site of the law,

22
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,930
single largest loss of life
of US service members at 38,

23
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
died in a Chinook that was shot down by
RPG in that valley and it was a really

24
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:57,360
important mission because the
Tango Valley is just outside Kabul,

25
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,970
but it's a Taliban stronghold so they can,

26
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,590
they can plan their operations and
attack cool very quickly from the tiny

27
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,424
valley.

28
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,460
And so it was important that we told
the story and so I went to talk with the

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,480
General Townsend and he said,

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,261
okay,

31
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:14,500
so you know,

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,590
are you prepared to see your camera guy?

33
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,510
Um,

34
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,060
you know,

35
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,700
in an orange jumpsuit on his knees,

36
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,370
on the Internet because the
place you're putting in,

37
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,220
that's the kind of thing that happens
and nobody's going to go get him.

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:26,730
No,

39
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,270
no US allies or us,

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,153
we'll go get him.

41
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:30,120
And I said,

42
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,050
I hadn't said yes.

43
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:34,230
And that was probably the hardest
moment because I had to make a conscious

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,430
conscious decision.

45
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,391
Right?

46
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:38,220
Then just say yes.

47
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,840
Did you express this to him?

48
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:41,370
Yeah,

49
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:41,611
I mean,

50
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:41,851
Jake,

51
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,110
Jake knows jake.

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,510
Jake knew Jake's.

53
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,230
Jake's.

54
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,160
Did you tell him that?

55
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,660
That that was the sentence.

56
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,250
That was the way it was described to you.

57
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,940
Yeah,

58
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,240
I did.

59
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,073
What did he say?

60
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,831
No problem.

61
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:55,280
Ricky and his cheerful
Australian attitudes.

62
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,230
No problem.

63
00:01:58,790 --> 00:01:59,800
Fucking Australians.

64
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,350
They're crazy,

65
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,020
crazy,

66
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,853
crazy

67
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,580
bull.

68
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:04,950
This guy,

69
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,460
he's a boy.

70
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,293
Wow.

71
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,740
Sounds like a nutty dude.

72
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,251
What,

73
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,510
what motivates that guy?

74
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,750
Jake?

75
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,583
Um,

76
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,940
was in the Australian army and I
think he was involved with some,

77
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,270
some event that was really
traumatizing involving,

78
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,050
you know,

79
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,610
some kids getting hurt and killed.

80
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,810
And so it was somewhere in Indonesia
where the Australians were I think.

81
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,950
And so he ever since has been
involved ever since that event.

82
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,330
And then a left the army,

83
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,000
he's been trying to tell the story of
how war affects kids and so he's got a

84
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,620
special focus on kids and so that's,

85
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,680
that's what motivates jake,

86
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:40,514
I think.

87
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,260
And he,

88
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,810
he does this three 65.

89
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:43,890
He's over there all the time.

90
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:47,430
All the time to some
yearn for a normal life.

91
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,480
No,

92
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,190
he actually learns for the next gunfight.

93
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,980
He yearns for the next gunfight.

94
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,320
He,

95
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:56,550
he's one of those guys that chase has
gunfights around the world who looked just

96
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,160
all sorts of sexual appetites and
I know there's guys I know guys

97
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,200
don't like to be smacked
around and tied up.

98
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:02,970
I really,

99
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,130
I have a friend who likes
doing that fucking weird shit.

100
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:06,881
Oh yeah.

101
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,290
I used to work for a dominatrix.

102
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,450
I wasn't working for her as a Dominatrix,

103
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:10,981
but she,

104
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:14,530
I worked in her clothing store and she
was also a dominatrix this German woman

105
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,750
and she would go piss on people.

106
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,850
She would just like,

107
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,680
it was so funny and she had this
crazy accent and she'd answer,

108
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:21,970
you know,

109
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,140
one line she was ordering,

110
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,621
you know,

111
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:25,120
fabric and then the other line she's like,

112
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,954
what are you into?

113
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:27,310
Do you want me to jog around the block?

114
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,091
You on my feet smell.

115
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:28,924
He actually,

116
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,400
she always like.

117
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,000
And then she had a guy
who had like his thing,

118
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,770
she would tell me about it all.

119
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:37,960
She had a guy who all he wanted to do,

120
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:41,140
she had to wear white underwear and he
just wanted to use a flashlight and look

121
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,760
up her skirt for like an hour.

122
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,110
She would get paid so much.

123
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,590
At one time I went over to her house to
get paid and she had a man blind folded

124
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,580
on the floor crawling and he was just
smelling her boots while she was writing

125
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:52,414
me a check.

126
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,191
I mean,

127
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:54,640
it was,

128
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,570
it never ended.

129
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:56,620
It was so funny.

130
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,520
Did you ever hear the Central Park Story?

131
00:03:58,521 --> 00:03:59,354
It wouldn't be annoying.

132
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:00,323
No,

133
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,940
this is a class three.

134
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,470
Here we go.

135
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,190
Tell this story.

136
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,023
Crack my fingers.

137
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,350
Okay.

138
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,561
We,

139
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,394
uh,

140
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,460
we're coming out of somewhere,

141
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,440
maybe a 12 step meeting or whatever,

142
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,550
you know,

143
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,550
and there's a hot hot black chick
walks by and recognizes me from.

144
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,410
And I wasn't even maybe from a club.

145
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:23,980
I didn't.

146
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,090
Maybe I did one TV show her two when
my life should I show it to her?

147
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,370
Do you want to go out for,

148
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,131
for bagels?

149
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:30,990
Were going for bagels.

150
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,391
She said,

151
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:31,601
okay.

152
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,680
So we went and had bagels.

153
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,851
Then we said,

154
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:34,001
hey,

155
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:36,190
we're going to go uptown to the people's,

156
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,293
you know,

157
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:38,111
on like 50,

158
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,500
fourth,

159
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
whatever abroad.

160
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,260
Like,

161
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,970
look,

162
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,720
I'm not trying to prostitute,

163
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm not fucking judge.

164
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:44,351
And people,

165
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,400
we're not here to judge.

166
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,760
But I mean,

167
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,020
did you know she was a prostitute?

168
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,430
She wasn't a prostitute.

169
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,050
But you invite her to a Pete booth?

170
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,531
Yeah,

171
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:50,861
we are.

172
00:04:50,861 --> 00:04:51,790
She's already likes her.

173
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,624
So

174
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,350
she got up.

175
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,183
She already got her.

176
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,340
She already got a fucking free Bagel.

177
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,170
Not Thinking this is going to
be your girlfriend someday.

178
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,563
No,

179
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,080
no,

180
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,570
no.

181
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,030
Uh,

182
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,870
but you've got to sell it to Larry.

183
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:05,801
So we go,

184
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:05,921
hey,

185
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:06,620
we're going.

186
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,120
We were planning on them in order to.

187
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,263
Anyhow,

188
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,330
so we go up to the quarter,

189
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:16,750
moved to people and she comes
into a booth when Mayo and,

190
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:19,780
but we get kicked out the
fucking Indian fucking get out,

191
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,171
you know?

192
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,004
No couple.

193
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:21,820
No,

194
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,490
no couples in the booth
in those quarter boots.

195
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,660
You can't bring somebody in.

196
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,570
So now she's no fucking lie.

197
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,670
I'm not lying or standing

198
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,970
right across from the Ed Sullivan Theater.

199
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,703
Right.

200
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,070
And there's like a newspaper Kiosk and
we're leaning on a car and I'm making out

201
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,900
with her and,

202
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,240
and,

203
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,570
and,

204
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,880
and um,

205
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,490
fingering her on Broadway shows.

206
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,030
She fucking and nortons just grabbing
her ass like a little fucking like he's

207
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,271
like,

208
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,950
it's a toy,

209
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,480
right?

210
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,040
So I think.

211
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,540
And she comes in,

212
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,740
she has an orgasm standing
on Broadway from leaving.

213
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,030
So then we get in the car.

214
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:02,241
We go,

215
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:02,460
hey,

216
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,560
Julie has an orgasm.

217
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,460
Who Does?

218
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,293
Allegedly.

219
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,670
No,

220
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,310
I had no idea to tell.

221
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,173
You could feel it.

222
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,250
Well she didn't piss on my finger,

223
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:10,980
but you can.

224
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,320
But you can tell when a girl is asking.

225
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,420
She wasn't faking it.

226
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:15,610
She wasn't in a rush.

227
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,540
Okay.

228
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:16,870
Sell.

229
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,390
It was a way,

230
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,223
you know.

231
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,240
I'm not saying that was the best one
that has been tired of your finger.

232
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,900
There might still be a little fingers.

233
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,734
Know what they're doing.

234
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:25,191
Okay,

235
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,510
but you're being Nikki negative.

236
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,344
This is

237
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,490
just trying to get a real clear
picture of what actually happened.

238
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,400
It couldn't be any clearer.

239
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,270
Your finger.

240
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,830
That must have looked like a site also,

241
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:37,341
by the way,

242
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:40,130
just like when you went back and they
heard in the middle and then Norton

243
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,964
grabbing the butt.

244
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:41,560
But yeah,

245
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,260
no worries.

246
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,120
We'll confirm all of it.

247
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,510
Okay,

248
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,091
so then we go,

249
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:47,180
let's take a ride up to central park
and we were walking through central park

250
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,140
and then she's blowing me,

251
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,453
right.

252
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,110
She's blowing me and
then I looked down and I,

253
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:02,111
she'd Norton eating her ass for
the sake of little kid in candy.

254
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,700
Right.

255
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,730
And I'm trying not to crack
up because I'm fucking blown.

256
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,070
You don't want to fucking
laugh as you didn't block,

257
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:11,061
you know.

258
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:12,620
But this has got to feel good for her.

259
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:14,630
She's getting her ass eaten and,

260
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,790
and now I'm getting blown.

261
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,490
So I shoot a load,

262
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,500
we get back in the car and we're driving
and I go to norte and you have a good

263
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,334
time.

264
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,323
He goes,

265
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,620
it was a little uncomfortable.

266
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,360
I got my,

267
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,600
my,

268
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,900
my pants dirty.

269
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,010
I go,

270
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,390
you'll fucking eat out.

271
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,130
A strange girl say yes,

272
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,610
but you're worried about
getting your fucking pants.

273
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,760
What are you going to get home?

274
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,650
Your mom was going to say,

275
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,800
look at these grass stains.

276
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,080
Were you eating out as to get annoyed?

277
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Like he was upset that he got grass
stains on this pants as he was eating

278
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,930
fucking strange girl to this.

279
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,900
So hilarious.

280
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,150
That's so sounds like norton to.

281
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:54,170
It's so ridiculous.

282
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:57,350
I mean this is obviously single and young.

283
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,190
Weakest so fucked.

284
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,940
You know,

285
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,940
he was dating this girl that was so
fucking hot and we're in a car and she was

286
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,290
blown Norton's walking by and go,

287
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:06,441
hey,

288
00:08:06,441 --> 00:08:07,274
you want to watch?

289
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:07,780
And He.

290
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,121
He goes,

291
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:08,600
yeah.

292
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,610
He comes in and he's
in the back of the car.

293
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,840
She just fucking,

294
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,710
you know,

295
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,630
we picked up this fucking jerking off.

296
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:15,921
She's blowing.

297
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,131
Yeah.

298
00:08:16,131 --> 00:08:17,030
But I come so quick.

299
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:17,271
He goes,

300
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:17,871
fuck man,

301
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:18,704
hold off.

302
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,590
One time we pick up this hot.

303
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,160
I pick up.

304
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
It's always made,

305
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,330
period.

306
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:26,901
I picked up this.

307
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:28,610
Go up under the economy of fucking.

308
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,100
So we're going back to Norton's house

309
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,090
and she's blowing me and whatever.

310
00:08:35,091 --> 00:08:37,550
And nortons jerking off
and next thing you know,

311
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:42,551
I see a load fly and hit norton
in the fucking head from you.

312
00:08:42,771 --> 00:08:43,820
Like he fucking,

313
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,550
she's blown me Jersey and a fucking.

314
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,513
I don't know why.

315
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,110
Yeah.

316
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,760
He hit himself in the head and I was so
fucking impressed that as soon as that

317
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,110
high and hit herself and then I was like,

318
00:08:54,111 --> 00:08:55,680
it was fucking very impressive.

319
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,773
Okay.

320
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,570
God,

321
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,410
he's a creep.

322
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,710
What about you?

323
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,301
Just getting blown.

324
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:07,050
I live TV and I didn't do anything wrong.
