1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,830
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:04,091
This is everything.

3
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:04,930
I own it as well.

4
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:05,853
That's insane.

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,060
Right in my bag back.

6
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,613
He has A.

7
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,310
I mean that's not even
a really large backpack.

8
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:13,690
Like if you brought that elk hunting,

9
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,370
people would be upset with you.

10
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,030
A little man purse.

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,913
Yeah.

12
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,040
So a man purse backpack.

13
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:23,900
My chords and my ipad stuff by that

14
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,040
and I travel all over the world.

15
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,293
Wow.

16
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,030
Pack really carefully as you can imagine.

17
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,710
Very petite shirts,

18
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:33,550
three pair of pants,

19
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:34,540
three pairs of shorts,

20
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,820
a rain jacket too.

21
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,810
Lightweight hoodies,

22
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:38,770
long sleeve tee shirt.

23
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,120
I could pretty much recite.

24
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,770
I never felt more liberated than when
I got rid of all my stuff and I'm in a

25
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:47,501
different country.

26
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:48,334
I have a couple of weeks.

27
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,211
A lot of people say,

28
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:49,511
hey,

29
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:50,700
why not the roller bags,

30
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:51,534
Dave,

31
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:56,500
if you travel in any kind of third
world country down cobblestones.

32
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:57,290
Uh,

33
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,780
I actually had a roller bag,

34
00:00:58,781 --> 00:01:00,760
but I ditched it my first trip to London,

35
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,080
a change trains four times going up and
down these damn stairs where the clunk,

36
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:05,321
clunk,

37
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,300
clunk her back.

38
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:06,660
I said,

39
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,390
you know what?

40
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:08,290
This really sucks.

41
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,240
I'm going to carry it on my body.

42
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,074
So that's um,

43
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,340
I don't get any money from these guys,

44
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:13,121
but as a Tom,

45
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:13,421
Ben,

46
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:13,901
Bi,

47
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:14,211
h,

48
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:16,240
n fantastic travel bags,

49
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,410
uh,

50
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,460
so well configured,

51
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:19,780
you wouldn't believe the
stuff I get in there.

52
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:22,840
I even had my whole workout
gym and that thing man really

53
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,550
kind of stuff's in there that you
carry around with you everywhere.

54
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,500
Now this Tom Ben,

55
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:29,900
is this for hiking or is
it just primarily a trap?

56
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,973
The travel ban.

57
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,530
I want to take a serious hike with it,

58
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,401
but,

59
00:01:33,401 --> 00:01:34,090
uh,

60
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,200
it looks like it's pretty sturdy,

61
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,123
very sturdy.

62
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,260
I use packing cubes.

63
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,400
There's different packing ways.

64
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,810
A good resource for your
listeners that travel full time.

65
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,370
Go to one bag.com.

66
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,240
He has many recommendations
for various bags and uh,

67
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,860
where you can just basically one carry
on bag and travel anywhere in the world

68
00:01:53,861 --> 00:01:58,160
for several weeks at a time
if you want to smell one bag.

69
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,780
A lot of this stuff is high tech.

70
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:03,760
I just washed my tee
shirts out in the sink.

71
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:05,601
Well,

72
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:06,230
if it was,

73
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,011
if you were,

74
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:07,331
um,

75
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:10,820
one of the things that I've found from
hiking and camping for long periods of

76
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,250
times,

77
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,970
wool was great.

78
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,480
There's a great company
called first light,

79
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,500
first Lit II that I'm a buddy minds,

80
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,070
part of my friend Ryan Callahan.

81
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,940
I'm out of Montana and
actually catch them.

82
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,630
I met them in Montana,

83
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,810
but they make look will outer gear and
inner gear like long johns stuff along

84
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:31,760
those lines.

85
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,450
Fantastic.

86
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,720
A lot of hunting gear and you
can wear that stuff for days,

87
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:36,290
days,

88
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:36,711
days,

89
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:37,490
and it doesn't smell

90
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,500
well because a lot of this stuff
is this stretch polya mine.

91
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,490
It's like a little of that Hashtag,

92
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,450
a nylon type material,

93
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,470
which real stretchy.

94
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,850
It's a silver impregnated silver.

95
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,700
Uh,

96
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,560
help stop the bacteria from.

97
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,370
Okay,

98
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,050
so you can get like three or
four days out of this t shirt.

99
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,850
Really?

100
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,200
Yeah.

101
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,930
It doesn't stink.

102
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:58,740
Maybe you could.

103
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,310
Well,

104
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,143
I stink.

105
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm a stinky person.

106
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,043
Check this out.

107
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,840
I can train a rubber band and
I used to metrics I can do.

108
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,511
Good morning.

109
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,340
What is the amount of
tension on that rubber?

110
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:14,110
They just say heavy duty.

111
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:14,771
But remember,

112
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,970
the further you stretch it,

113
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,230
the smarter it gets.

114
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,910
It gets this old man.

115
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:20,530
Plenty of a stretch.

116
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:21,370
Maybe not you,

117
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,170
but Milton Berle,

118
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,430
Sid Caesar,

119
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:24,750
they.

120
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:24,970
I mean,

121
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:26,580
it was still guys plan,

122
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:26,950
you know?

123
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,780
Wow.

124
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:27,980
Yeah,

125
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,301
yeah.

126
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:31,480
There was a lot of stuff came to us and
he got to see all those people should

127
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,700
not show night after night if tonight.

128
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,080
And I just,

129
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,100
if I was done work,

130
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:37,540
I'll go shit in the back of the room,

131
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:37,751
you know,

132
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,280
sometimes my wife would come,

133
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,240
you know.

134
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,170
Wow.

135
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,700
And there it was no big deal after awhile,

136
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,001
you know,

137
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:44,831
it's crazy.

138
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,060
I got a tape of him.

139
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,430
I got a tape of him on New Year's Eve,

140
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,530
I think it's New Year's Eve.

141
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,580
[inaudible]

142
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,000
89 or 90.

143
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,060
The guys did the soundman took it.

144
00:03:55,061 --> 00:04:00,061
It was closed circuit the circuit in the
room and just in the room and they put

And he's drunk.

148
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,130
His toupees Kinda crooked.

149
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:10,870
And Joey,

150
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,190
Remember Joey Villa?

151
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,360
He was a comic,

152
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:14,230

153
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,064

154
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,851

155
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:16,780

156
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:18,580
He was in splash that show.

157
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,300

I still have it somewhere and he played.

162
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,461
He says,

00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,930

00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:39,671
If they pay me,

168

173
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,270
He just turned to hundred night.

174
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,600
It was like 1990.

175
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:51,820
So that was probably the
beginning of the end.

176
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:53,920
Right before he started losing a little.

177
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:55,450
He had a teleprompter onstage,

178
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:55,901
you know,

179
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,040
he was reading though,

180
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:57,490
you know,

181
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:57,760
you know,

182
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,080
he wasn't completely out of it,

183
00:04:59,081 --> 00:04:59,620
but you know,

184
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,000
did he died in [inaudible] 99,

185
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,960
if I'm not mistaken.

186
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:02,401
So,

187
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:02,650
uh,

188
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:03,880
he would forget his lyrics.

189
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,301
Yeah.

190
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:04,930
Oh yeah.

191
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,621
Oh Wow.

192
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:05,801
Yeah,

193
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:06,540
absolutely.

194
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,600
Because it was so hammered.

195
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:07,991
It was just.

196
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:08,401
No,

197
00:05:08,401 --> 00:05:08,770
no.

198
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,170
I just think he was getting
older and I think to be honest,

199
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,420
my opinion that kept
them out there too long,

200
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,313
you know,

201
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,410
I think whoever the powers may be,

202
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,250
I don't know who that was.

203
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,020
I think he stayed a little too long there,

204
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:20,291
you know,

205
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,610
but I hate to see him.

206
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,560
I saw him in [inaudible] 82 when I first.

207
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:24,720
I got to town and 80.

208
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:25,960
I saw him.

209
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,370
Nineteen 81.

210
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:27,881
Eighty two,

211
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:28,900
83 in those days.

212
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,471
It's Jesus.

213
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,360
I mean that was something
I saw Sammy Davis,

214
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:31,840
you know.

215
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,673
Wow.

216
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,100
Yeah,

217
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,240
I saw all those,

218
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:34,491
you know,

219
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,400
Johnny told those guys that were there.

220
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,830
I saw a lot of stuff that
people were gone and you know.

221
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:39,021
Yeah.

222
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:41,280
You like caught the bridge
for the last of the.

223
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,143
Exactly.

224
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:42,850
Absolutely.

225
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:45,280
When I moved in it was 350,000 people.

226
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,380
Well the,

227
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,040
I was friendly with the,

228
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:48,874
uh,

229
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,991
casino,

230
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,310
the Joe Pesci character,

231
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,750
Tony Spilotro,

232
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,711
that character.

233
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,730
I was friendly with that guy.

234
00:05:54,731 --> 00:05:55,564
I was a bouncer.

235
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,040
He would come into the club,

236
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,940
the time on the club,

237
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,080
you'll just give me a 20,

238
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,420
you know me.

239
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,900
He was giving me 20 house for years.

240
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,360
If I was a bartender,

241
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,510
you send up a 20.

242
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,070
He was always a good guy to me.

243
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:08,750
Now I didn't know what he did,

244
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,471
but he didn't do.

245
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,250
He was good to me.

246
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,180
I didn't know the,

247
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,014
the uh,

248
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,540
I didn't know that Deniro character him.

249
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,800
I never knew he was around,

250
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,401
but I didn't know him.

251
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,900
But the Pegi character,

252
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,131
uh,

253
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:22,900
Tony splotch show and he had a
guy fat Herbie and I was there.

254
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
His son got married.

255
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,920
I was the bouncer at the wedding to
make sure FBI didn't get into the,

256
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,070
into the wedding.

257
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:34,070
I swear to God they had a balance
here at the wedding bouncers Tuxedo.

258
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,880
I was about to do it and make sure nobody
that's not on that list doesn't come

259
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:39,000
in,

260
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,190
but they're worried about the FBI.

261
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,220
They were worried because at
the time there was a lot of,

262
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:43,640
you know,

263
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
it was a small town.

264
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:45,550
It was easy.

265
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:45,830
I mean,

266
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,041
you know,

267
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:47,540
they were doing whatever they were doing.

268
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:47,841
I mean,

269
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,400
I don't know,

270
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:48,920
you know,

271
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,131
I mean,

272
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,960
I was never privy to any of that.

273
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,120
Well,

274
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,860
you're putting out a
certain type of frequency,

275
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:54,161
right?

276
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:54,401
I mean,

277
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,330
that's what you're putting out.

278
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,590
If you're putting out a frequency,

279
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,820
look what you're saying is you
want to own all the react videos.

280
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,030
That's the greedy can
frequency you throughout the
greedy combat bat signal and

281
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,870
you're letting everybody
know you're a piece of shit.

282
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,180
You're a piece of shit and
you want to steal money.

283
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,541
Well,

284
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:10,691
you know,

285
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,160
the best part is that stealing money,

286
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:12,461
right?

287
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:12,711
I mean,

288
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:13,421
that's stealing money.

289
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:14,740
If you make a reaction video,

290
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,610
you want to watch two girls,

291
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,190
one cup or guy getting
run over by a buffalo,

292
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,520
they want money from
you watching that video,

293
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,653
that stealing.

294
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,960
What they've done is they've used
lawyers to circumvent the system.

295
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,720
They've jacked the system and
they're going to try to steal.

296
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:30,670
Have they actually
copyrighted the word react.

297
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,170
So is this valid?

298
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,093
So they,

299
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:33,521
they,

300
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,030
uh,

301
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,260
they retracted.

302
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,590
What happened was the Internet
lost its shit as you would expect.

303
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,790
And these guys,

304
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,980
there were videos on youtube
which were live streams.

305
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,330
These were so funny
when this was going on.

306
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:51,220
Essentially what they were is the
subscriber count of their channel shortly

307
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,880
after the controversy had hit and
it will just like fell off a cliff,

308
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,740
like it should go to zero.

309
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,390
He never went to 100 percent.

310
00:07:58,391 --> 00:07:58,931
Go to zero.

311
00:07:58,931 --> 00:07:59,740
It should go to zero.

312
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,710
It never went to zero.

313
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,140
Don't deserve anything.

314
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:02,411
Yeah,

315
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,490
that's what they want to do.

316
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,760
You really want to reach out to everyone
using the word react in a video and you

317
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,540
want money from them.

318
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,373
Fuck you.

319
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,641
Fuck you.

320
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:12,940
You're everything that's wrong with
distributing content over the internet.

321
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:14,240
That's everything that's wrong with it.

322
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:19,300
You've taken one of the sneakiest most
diabolical fucking tricks and all the

323
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:24,010
legal system and you've applied it to
this open free world of the Internet and

324
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:24,850
you're a piece of shit.

325
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,500
That's a parasitic behavior.

326
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,460
Let me ask you something.

327
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,323
That's cancer.

328
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,020
I agree.

329
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,100
They came back,

330
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,660
retracted it.

331
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,950
Apologize.

332
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,900
Fuck them.

333
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,910
Fuck them for even
thinking that showed the,

334
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,360
okay,

335
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,920
now you're going to give
him a second chance.

336
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,850
Fucking chances.

337
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,530
You can't think like that.

338
00:08:41,531 --> 00:08:42,430
You can't do that.

339
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:42,881
You can't.

340
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:43,840
You can't do that.

341
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:45,100
You can't go after people.

342
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:47,710
For some it's not like
it has anything to do.

343
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:48,580
Anything you create.

344
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah,

345
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,360
you're just stealing their wares.

346
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,250
There were some stories going around
that they had effectively shut down like

347
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:55,084
these small time,

348
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,950
Walmart completely like people
who had the hots for who they.

349
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,670
Again,

350
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,370
the fine brothers.
