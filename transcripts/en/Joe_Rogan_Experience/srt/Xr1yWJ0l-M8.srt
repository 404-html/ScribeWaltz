00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:03,610
There's a,

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:06,510
the guy who was the doctor
behind that movie concussion,

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,780
he was recently talking about Oj Simpson
because Oj Simpson was released and

5
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:10,021
he's like,

6
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:12,420
this is 100% chance that guy has CTE.

7
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,330
And they've even said that Oj,

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,130
if the trial was today,

9
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:20,780
his doctor said that he would
introduce CTE as a defense,

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,470
which is crazy because then you have to
say he's guilty because the defense was

11
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:25,771
always,

12
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:26,604
I didn't do it,

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:27,721
you know?

14
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:29,280
And he wrote a book how I did it.

15
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:29,790
Yeah.

16
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:30,623
If I did it,

17
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:31,410
that was the book.

18
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:31,801
I know.

19
00:00:31,801 --> 00:00:33,820
But anF is in tiny little red mark.

20
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,370
And I did it.

21
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,713
I watched the CH,

22
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,670
the Cuba Gooding show last night,

23
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,690
the FX show.

24
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:40,430
I'd never seen it.

25
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,090
Never seen people versus Oj Simpson.

26
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,880
It was a great record.

27
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,370
Yeah.

28
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:45,203
Great show.

29
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,020
You know,

30
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:46,860
it's Weird Watch,

31
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,130
man.

32
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,170
Just to revisit everything like woof,

33
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,300
the night when the Oj got out,

34
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:51,751
it's like,

35
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,584
just go away.

36
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,320
Yeah.

37
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,570
Just go quiet.

38
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,640
Don't say anything.

39
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,160
Play Golf and keep your mouth shut.

40
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,143
He can do,

41
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,680
he's not going to and you can't.

42
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,311
He's,

43
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:02,580
uh,

44
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,780
he's addicted to love.

45
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,730
He's addicted to people liking them.

46
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,170
And there's going to always,

47
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,250
if he goes to Florida,

48
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,230
there's plenty of fucking stupid people
in forest go and make them right there

49
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,080
or he's going back to jail.

50
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:16,530
He's gonna do something
stupid and violate his parole.

51
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,550
Do you think you'll do that though?

52
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,260
It's seven years old or whatever he is.

53
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,680
Well,

54
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,870
if he does anything other than shut up,

55
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,390
he's either going to
die or go back to jail.

56
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,351
You know what I mean?

57
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,370
Like there's no,

58
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,190
there's no positive that's going to come
out of him making public appearances,

59
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,301
you know,

60
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:34,081
writing a book,

61
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,450
going on a talk show circuit.

62
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:35,701
Like,

63
00:01:35,701 --> 00:01:35,971
no,

64
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,980
like you're 78 years old,

65
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,320
live out the last 10,

66
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,281
15,

67
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:41,881
20 years,

68
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,560
whatever he got with just live it.

69
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:43,921
There isn't,

70
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,180
there's money somewhere,

71
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:45,451
right.

72
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,111
Cause Florida,

73
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,230
they couldn't take his money there.

74
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,110
So yeah,

75
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,370
he's gotten money somewhere.

76
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,213
Just,

77
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,250
just quietly fade away.

78
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:53,581
You know,

79
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,390
let people,

80
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,630
people might recognize you when you
go down to play Bingo at the home.

81
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,250
Just wave banks Marlboro.

82
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,520
And,

83
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,040
uh,

84
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,401
you know,

85
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:02,730
but,

86
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,810
but yeah,

87
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,531
there's no,

88
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:05,910
I don't think there's any way.

89
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,520
There's no positive public appearance.

90
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,210
No.

91
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,390
That Oj could make make.

92
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,680
It was,

93
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,390
it was a really,

94
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,470
really intense,

95
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,120
and during that time,

96
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,480
two of his friends die within two weeks
of each other of heart attacks at age 52

97
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,870
and 59.

98
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,700
And Nikita Kemiah,

99
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,010
of WHO's 52 years old and he's running,

100
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,730
he had resigned from running
the Russian antidoping agency.

101
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:31,360
So,

102
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,900
so technically the Russian anti-doping
agencies shouldn't be working with

103
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:36,040
Gregory's lab.

104
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,630
The Wada,

105
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:40,840
the world antidoping agency lab low
should be two independent things.

106
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:46,120
But these two were working together
because there was never any anti-doping.

107
00:02:46,121 --> 00:02:50,920
Russia was the anti anti doping
system posing as anti-doping.

108
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,370
So Nikita is still in Russia.

109
00:02:54,371 --> 00:02:58,060
He's been forced to resign and
Gregory and him are still talking via,

110
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,380
uh,

111
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,213
via Skype.

112
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,113
Um,

113
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,781
and,

114
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,530
uh,

115
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,230
Nikita tells Gregory
that he's going to go,

116
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,590
uh,

117
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,430
but he's writing a book and that he's
been in contact with David Walsh.

118
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:14,020
And David Walsh is the Sunday Times
journalists that chased Armstrong for 10

119
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:14,320
years.

120
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,310
He's probably one of the most renowned
famous sports journalists in the world.

121
00:03:19,311 --> 00:03:19,810
The,

122
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,070
that Stephen Frears film,

123
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,980
the programs based on
David Walsh and send,

124
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:27,160
Nikita had reached out to David
Walsh and him and David Walsh,

125
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:28,390
we're making a plan to meet.

126
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,120
And Nikita had told Gregory that,

127
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:31,511
you know,

128
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,070
he was going to meet with David Walsh.

129
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:33,881
Gregory was like,

130
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:34,301
this is,

131
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,170
you can't do this.

132
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,140
You're still in Russian.

133
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:36,460
Nikita,

134
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,390
you're still in Russia.

135
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,224
What are you doing?

136
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,421
And a,

137
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:40,190
a day later,

138
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,640
Nikita dies of a heart attack.

139
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,890
And this was a guy who was healthy,

140
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,250
uh,

141
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,560
had never had a heart problem in his life,

142
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,070
was a,

143
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,510
it was a lifelong athlete.

144
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:49,911
Never end.

145
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:54,911
He was 52 52 and apparently he died
over about three and a half hours while,

146
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,710
uh,

147
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,650
Nikita's wife was on the
phone to Gregory crying.

148
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,203
Uh,

149
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,720
so this is a really have any
suspicion of how they did it.

150
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,333
Um,

151
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:06,940
you know,

152
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,350
Gregory goes out and they just,

153
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,520
you just die of a heart attack,

154
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,690
that poison yo,

155
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:11,021
whatever.

156
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,231
That,

157
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:11,620
you know,

158
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:11,981
I don't,

159
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:13,840
I don't know how they do it,

160
00:04:13,841 --> 00:04:14,141
but you know,

161
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,310
Russia isn't like Isis.

162
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,130
They don't do something and then
take responsibility and obviously,

163
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:18,610
you know,

164
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,320
there's been so many stories I can buzz
feed last year then of the 14 deaths in

165
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:24,670
London all tied to,

166
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,533
you know,

167
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,370
various had the series of Russia.

168
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,450
There's been multiple books,

169
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:29,284
written audit,

170
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,513
um,

171
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,300
even,

172
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,811
uh,

173
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:32,230
you know,

174
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,970
which was not widely reported.

175
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,870
Um,

176
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,920
the Russian agent,

177
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:37,570
the Co offered a,

178
00:04:37,571 --> 00:04:41,050
apparently the Trump dossier with the
mic [inaudible] the former have my six

179
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:41,884
agent.

180
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,281
Uh,

181
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:46,810
he was found dead in the back of Alexis
about five months ago outside of Moscow.

182
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,813
Um,

183
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,020
so,

184
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:50,500
you know,

185
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:50,950
uh,

186
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,870
clearly they,

187
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,390
they,

188
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,701
they,

189
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,340
they play by a different set of rules.

190
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,420
If you look at how men and
women evolved to get partners,

191
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,520
women just have to look hot.

192
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,960
You have to look like you're fertile
and young and have good genes,

193
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,820
which is what we consider beauty.

194
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:09,490
These what feminists say are
arbitrary standards of beauty.

195
00:05:09,491 --> 00:05:10,960
Aren't anything like that.

196
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,790
They're very across cultures.

197
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:17,791
Men like women with this hourglass figure
and who have long shiny hair and who

198
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:19,300
are not 72,

199
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,600
because if you had sex with a 72 year old,

200
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,980
your genes died out.

201
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:24,821
Yeah.

202
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:29,680
This the feminist thing about arbitrary
standards of beauty as a person who is

203
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,990
deeply entrenched in science,

204
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,460
like that's gotta be frustrating,

205
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:33,701
right?

206
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,190
Because you're looking at
something that's not accurate.

207
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,550
It's,

208
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,971
it's a,

209
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,520
you're pushing a narrative
that's just not accurate.

210
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:42,640
There's this very takeaway
called Jered takeaway.

211
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:42,941
You know,

212
00:05:42,941 --> 00:05:43,331
all the,

213
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:46,060
all your personal feelings
about human beings.

214
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,920
And you look at the mammal,

215
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:49,000
the human mammal,

216
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:49,631
and it's,

217
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:54,631
it's very clear why the certain males
are gravitating towards certain females

218
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,800
and contrary or,

219
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:57,200
uh,

220
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,801
conversely,

221
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:00,620
why certain females are
gravitating towards certain males.

222
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,640
It's biological,

223
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,200
right?

224
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,591
And this,

225
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:03,940
it's so unhelpful.

226
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:04,990
It's really awful.

227
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,540
This idea that people
should like you for Watson.

228
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,590
Now on the inside,

229
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,630
we don't see that people,

230
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:11,140
um,

231
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,040
if you look at porn,

232
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,620
it's not the woman who buys
a homeless man a sandwich.

233
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,790
You know who in the porn,

234
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,820
it's the woman with those features that
are just cross culturally appreciated by

235
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:22,010
men.

236
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:22,181
Well,

237
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:22,961
what's also too,

238
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,970
we're talking only about sexual,

239
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,421
right?

240
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:28,060
Because people do like you
for who you are on the inside.

241
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,310
Like Melissa McCarthy
is a perfect example.

242
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,660
She's as vibrant,

243
00:06:31,661 --> 00:06:33,580
hilarious woman and no one's,

244
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,030
no one's holding her up as the standard
of beauty or sexual attractiveness.

245
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:39,851
You know,

246
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:40,061
you're,

247
00:06:40,061 --> 00:06:44,020
you're looking at her as this fun person
and that's why millions of people go

248
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:48,400
see her in movies and her TV shows as
giant hit mean it's literally what's on

249
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:51,460
the inside and how she carries herself.

250
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,020
Right.

251
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,370
And she is very vibrant.

252
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,650
And if you look at that
cross cultural research,

253
00:06:55,651 --> 00:06:58,160
David Buss who is an
evolutionary psychologist,

254
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,400
did the big,

255
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:03,720
big cross cultural study and kindness
was what both men and women wanted.

256
00:07:03,721 --> 00:07:04,800
I think that was the top,

257
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,360
the top of each list.

258
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:08,880
But if you prioritize,

259
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:09,121
well,

260
00:07:09,121 --> 00:07:09,451
okay,

261
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:10,290
well what do I,

262
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,000
what are my must haves in a partner?

263
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:14,640
A guy is not going to want a very old,

264
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,830
unattractive woman as his partner.

265
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,120
If he can do better.

266
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:21,300
And a woman is not going to but want
to have the guy who was sleeping in

267
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:23,640
grandma's basement playing Atari,

268
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,410
Atari or whatever.

269
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,071
I'm a girl,

270
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,890
so I don't know anything
about football or video games.

271
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:29,481
You know?

272
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,370
I'm sure when you're,

273
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,080
you were a sex addict and
you're in this hedonistic,

274
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,381
you know,

275
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:35,570
whirlwind experience,

276
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,740
you're still,

277
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,110
you're taking in all this data
and you're taking all this in,

278
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,500
in the hollow feeling that
you had that you didn't like.

279
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:47,420
It is what propelled you to your new stage
of consciousness once you emerge from

280
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:47,810
it.

281
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:47,961
Yeah,

282
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:48,560
that's right.

283
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,550
Every so often,

284
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,550
like because he's like
pleasure laden an orgy.

285
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:52,761
I mean,

286
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:53,571
that's the point of it.

287
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:53,871
I mean,

288
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,710
there's flesh everywhere.

289
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,371
It's this bits of it.

290
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:56,204
They're brilliant.

291
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,280
I was no in,

292
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,101
hold on a minute.

293
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:59,120
This isn't working.

294
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,620
And this is a thing of what would really,

295
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:01,520
really work.

296
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,001
You know,

297
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,310
like sometimes the,

298
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:07,310
the great gift of promiscuity is you get
to experience the intimacy with all of

299
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,020
these strangers and it seemed exciting.

300
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:13,130
And the type of sexuality that I've
always had is more about worship then any

301
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:15,050
kind of domination I adore.

302
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:15,920
I adore,

303
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,341
you know,

304
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,930
so it's not about like
I want to control you.

305
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,890
So like by like the answer to all these
wonderful experiences and encounters,

306
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,130
but within this kind of ongoing seam of
loneliness on ignorable and also this is

307
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:29,870
the thing,

308
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,200
when you get the things your culture
tells you you should be doing and you

309
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,120
experience them now you know,

310
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:38,450
now you know you can stop chasing the
carrot because you've had a bite out of it

311
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:38,780
and he's like,

312
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:38,910
oh,

313
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,100
mini bullshit.

314
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,720
Like you know,

315
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,151
not an,

316
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:44,330
it's a hard one to learn because anything
that's got an orgasm at the end of it,

317
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,750
you know,

318
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,250
there's a degree of pleasure to be had,

319
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,180
but it takes,

320
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,480
it takes a while to recognize or what
they see the emotional cost and made a

321
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,040
spiritual cost on other people.

322
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:52,831
The fact faculty,

323
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:54,530
it's preventing me from becoming a father,

324
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:55,590
from becoming husband,

325
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,620
from set lien,

326
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,690
from becoming rooted,

327
00:08:57,691 --> 00:08:59,340
from becoming actually whole,

328
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,330
from becoming a man,

329
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,500
from becoming connected.

330
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,360
And it takes a while to spot that.

331
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,480
I think a lot of people don't get the
opportunity to break out that pattern.

332
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,830
I would never have spotted it.

333
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,990
Had a not first being a
heroin addict and going,

334
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:10,501
hold on a minute.

335
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:11,640
You're doing that thing again.

336
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,770
Same with fame and celebrity.

337
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,371
Well,

338
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,180
toxic,

339
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,080
well toxic,

340
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,300
excited and brilliant and loads
of lovely people in there.

341
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:19,111
And I still like,

342
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:19,321
you know,

343
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:20,250
I might make another film,

344
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,240
I don't know what happened,

345
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:25,530
but like it's because I'd had the
template and the experiences of awe,

346
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,430
this is addiction.

347
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:28,470
You're expecting this thing
to make you feel better.

348
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,060
Now what's happening is I am as a
baseline disabused of the idea that the

349
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,050
material world,

350
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,080
we'll give me anything that
it will ever fulfill me,

351
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,230
that I am responsible for
my own connection and that
my role here is to serve

352
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,330
other people and help them.

353
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,430
Yeah.
