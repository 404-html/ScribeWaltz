1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,990
The Joe Rogan experience
and [inaudible] was the guy,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,200
Rick Ross was the fucking guy who is in
charge of all that shit in Los Angeles

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,950
and well, it's your audience.
So they already know. I
don't have to qualify that.

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:14,970
It's not the rapper who stole his
identity. Isn't that crazy? It's crazy.

5
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:19,390
Dog 50 cent did the same thing just
in his drug dealer's dead. Yeah.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:24,120
50 cent is a famous famous drug dealer
in New York. No, yes, absolutely.

7
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,990
Yes. Yes. No Shit. Well,

8
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:31,960
Jay Z is a guy named Jasso
Wright who was a hood jazz. Oh,

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,710
I think that would be coming from him.
His partner,

10
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:38,760
like there used to be a rapper Jasso and
Jay z was his DJ way back in the day.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,120
Oh, see, I had thought it
was that jazzed about this.

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,470
They were healing and whatnot back then.
Now W I'm not hip to that part,

13
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:49,710
but they had a hit like jazz. Oh, had
a song way back call Hawaii, Hawaiian,

14
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:54,210
Sophie Hawaiian big. At the time it was
like for the era, it was a hit for sure.

15
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,210
He was supposed to be a really good
rapper. He wasn't, he's still probably is.

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,060
There's a lot of guys that have
slipped through the cracks at people.

17
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:02,190
I mean Kool g rap.

18
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,550
I'm sure Jay even at this point
would acknowledge that, you know,

19
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,690
some of his beginnings come from
Jazz. Those styles of, of rap. Well,

20
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:13,230
everybody gets influenced by somebody
else. Absolutely. Everybody. I mean,

21
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:16,980
I always give up the, uh, my influences,

22
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,510
Boston comedians Kennison like without
all those people that I was [inaudible]

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,321
is actually,
you know,

24
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:26,430
that song ain't no Nigga like the one
I got Yazzie he's things I believe he's

25
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:27,510
the guy singing in the hook.

26
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,530
No one can do it better if he's not the
guy actually singing it in the video.

27
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,000
That's him really big. Daddy
Kane, he's still around, man.

28
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,330
He's doing yo big daddy Kane ain't making
records. But I'll tell you like this,

29
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:40,470
as far as rap shows go,

30
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,910
I guarantee you he's still putting on
one of the best rap shows around the old

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,060
classic. So as long as classic, right.
It's like he still has his dancers.

32
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:49,590
They have,
they do like a classic,

33
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:54,440
like I would call it like almost like a
Vegas if there was a hip hop Vegas act

34
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:56,850
kind of thing. It's kind of
that, but not cheesy in any way.

35
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,840
But like there's a classic classic
cavity and then a word to it,

36
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:02,580
like the two dancers.
It's like an era.

37
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,430
He represents it and it's a
great show too. How about EPMD?

38
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,480
That's another band you don't
hear about anymore. Yeah,

39
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,940
well they had a lot of internal problems
and broke up and got back together and

40
00:02:11,941 --> 00:02:12,980
broke up.
Yeah.

41
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,050
I liked EPMD first of all because whenever
the do amazing out ass rapper and all

42
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,110
sides of speech impediment and
as a bad [inaudible]. Yeah,

43
00:02:22,111 --> 00:02:27,111
he's got a lisp and just spitting dope
rhymes with no apologies for his list.

44
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,290
No, you know and, and it's good dude. Well
the first one to do that was Kool g rap.

45
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,590
Kool g rap is great. Kool
g rap. He had the craziest,

46
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,140
the craziest lists of all his,
he had a crazy list man.

47
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,430
Michael Blue plays lists. That's the
best because it's every single song.

48
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:52,170
He talks like this and open the Anthony
[inaudible] does all the standards and

49
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:56,890
stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Pull up a Kool g rap,

50
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:01,630
pull up, talk like sex, pull up, cock
blocking. That's one of my favorite ones.

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,940
Pull up Kool g rap,
cock blocking.

52
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,780
He's got a great song about trying
to bang this chicken, her son,

53
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:08,670
his cock blocking.

54
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,080
I'll also to remember that.
I remember dude,

55
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:17,920
Kool g rap was one of my favorites.
Something. He just fell off.

56
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,330
I don't know what happened. You know,
it's like one of them things. It's just,

57
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:24,810
it was an error in it, you know? Yeah.
But he was hot. It's like one of the,

58
00:03:24,811 --> 00:03:27,190
it's a youth sport, you know what I
mean? That's what I try to tell me.

59
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,670
Why did you, why you ain't rapping
like you? So I still run my,

60
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:32,000
put it into my songs. I'm
working into what I do. My,

61
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,280
my version of hip hop and stuff.
It's like, but to chase the,

62
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:38,230
the adoration of the youth
that buys hip hop right now.

63
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:41,730
Is it a ridiculous for me, cause
I'm a 44 year old man. It's cool.

64
00:03:41,731 --> 00:03:44,970
G rap and Dj Polo got operations to song.

65
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,960
It's called operations cost.
The USA operation,

66
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:54,960
CB cock blocking this action
usually results in broken friends

67
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,910
is this is where the SS

68
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:16,000
brings back memories.
This is great.

69
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:28,000
This is Debbie. Debbie, great song man.

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,090
This dude is like one
of the revolutionaries

71
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,510
style in rap,
like Kool g rap care,

72
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,560
one in big daddy Kane really
changed rep and Chuck d those folks.

73
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:44,300
Cause before that it was like the run
DMC thought that a pop pop, pop, pop.

74
00:04:44,301 --> 00:04:47,570
My boss kind of just straight cadences
and these guys all had different,

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,270
these different styles that they started
working in and that's where a lot of

76
00:04:50,271 --> 00:04:53,780
how everybody else started branching out
and realizing like there was more than

77
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:58,160
one way to rhyme and one way to rap
like Kool g rap, big Daddy Kane,

78
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,280
krs one and Chuck d that they,
they're the ones,

79
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:05,050
they're the forefathers of everything
that goes on lyrically. Now I,

80
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:07,110
I agree and I feel like there's,

81
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:11,950
there's something missing on a lot of
people want to do this sort of, uh, this,

82
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,420
this hip hop hip hop has changed and a
lot of ways today where there's a lot of

83
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,240
stuff that they're calling hip hop that
almost seems like dance music to me.

84
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,390
What it is, it's hip hop has been,

85
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,900
you know, it's been co opted man
by the money. You know what I mean?

86
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:28,800
The money there was,

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,260
there was money around back when
these songs were being made,

88
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:36,090
but it wasn't ridiculous money that could,
it wasn't millions and billions.

89
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:37,640
It was thousands.
You know what I mean?

90
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:40,170
Is like we were getting thousands of
dollars back in the day thinking like

91
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,070
bawling, man, I got a Nissan Sentra and a
gold rope. Melissa, worst shit you bought.

92
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,170
What's the first shit you bought
when you started getting paid?

93
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,520
Like a gold chain from the
Sloss and swap meet four techs.

94
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:56,230
Bong for ticks bomb. What's that? Remember
the bongs, the vortex bongs with that,

95
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,100
you had that, a tattoo of the vortex
clown or the graphics, I'm sorry,

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,210
graphics, graphics clown. It's
just a, I still have that.

97
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:10,190
I drew that when I was like 21 yeah,
reminded me of it. It looks like Eddie.

98
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,150
It's so old now. It's fleeting. Like
Eddie's face. While I'm on hat on,

99
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,810
I'm going to get Aaron Dellavedova to
think, finish the Musashi and fit it.

100
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,430
Figure out what to put at the top of that.

101
00:06:19,431 --> 00:06:21,260
He's the same guy has
done both of my arms.

102
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,290
I just got to get this bitch lasered off.
It's dice. You can go over that. She,

103
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,560
I don't want it though. He prefers not
to. Aaron likes to have a clean slate.

104
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,760
He's a perfectionist.

105
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:34,730
He doesn't like to have to draw some
shit that he doesn't want to draw just

106
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:37,220
because there's some old ink
there. He's like, it's no big deal.

107
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,350
Just get it lasered a couple of
times. He's like, it's pretty old.

108
00:06:39,351 --> 00:06:42,650
It'll get off pretty quick. Then you
wait three months and then get to work.

109
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,220
I just have to design or rather come
up with the idea and sent it to him.

110
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,580
Whatever my idea is and he'll design
with the top is you've got to figure out

111
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:52,610
what to do. Check out this, this, this is
what opie and Anthony was talking about.

112
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,510
The Michael Pupil a list.

113
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,320
You can keep that fucking song going on
in the background and make bublé sound

114
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:01,250
tolerable, but it's, it's ridiculous.
This is Jake's Dukes is a Debbie my man.

115
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,800
So I got this,
listen

116
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:11,500
[inaudible] I got that
string around [inaudible]

117
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,670
beautiful love youtube for this. You know
what I think probably are we going to,

118
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:36,640
because we have that
clip on there. No. Um,

119
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,300
it doesn't seem like, no, it does.
You know what I, I'm just thinking,

120
00:07:39,301 --> 00:07:43,440
I think opie and Anthony got sent a
fake audio file cause they like broke it

121
00:07:43,441 --> 00:07:47,780
down and they have an always on the
replays. It's Kinda se, but yeah, no,

122
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,910
the one that Kool g rap
says say puck like thick.

123
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,910
I don't hear that. That's weird.
You got to hear more of a song.

124
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,370
I'll tell you the PMD,
but he made correctly.

125
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:03,390
You got to understand he made him and Eric
sermon or comparable. Really? Wow. Yeah.

126
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,303
That's interesting.

127
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:07,610
I think Eric sermon put it on a little
bit more though because Kool g rap,

128
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,390
like I think there was Kool g rap was
before that really? You know shit.

129
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,280
I'm not saying he made up,
that's the thing.

130
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,900
I just think he let it
go a little bit more.

131
00:08:14,901 --> 00:08:18,860
Whereas Kool g rap might've worked to
like try to not have it as bad when he was

132
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,340
recording. Kool g rap is one of my all
time favorite sermon. Just let it go.

133
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:26,930
You said I got a lift and if what's
going to be, I'm a big fan of axiom.

134
00:08:26,931 --> 00:08:30,550
Maya, let your conscience be free
and get Dan to the fans of the p.

135
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:34,190
Let me hear it. Hear it. See Land,

136
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,450
go take a nap and watch the
show. Why? Because right now

137
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,000
the ICPA is my name.

138
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,930
It's got too much tongue
until next lips struggling.

139
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,800
I just get dad and I go check
one, two. That was the jam.

140
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,950
No there at the terminal.
[inaudible] was one of the best.

141
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,030
He's another one that these young
kids don't, they don't respect enough.

142
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,150
Rakim follow the leader.
Oh he was the gun goes off my list.

143
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,720
You know I actually passed it.
That's one that was missing off that list.

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,850
He was fifth. Yes. He should have
been on that, that's for sure.

145
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:14,370
I totally spaced on him.
We just did three hours.

146
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:19,470
He is like there is no Nas without rock
camp here and nods would definitely

147
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,940
agree to that.
He,

148
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,810
he is definitely one of the
fathers of remodeled lyricists.

149
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:28,200
You got me turned on and nods and rewind
and that's one of my favorite songs.

150
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,660
It's brilliant. Right.
The way he set it up,

151
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,850
going from the bullet back into the gun,

152
00:09:32,851 --> 00:09:36,800
the whole thing taking the the events
and re plan one rank record, right? Yeah.

153
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,420
Mike and all that. It's like, Oh
man, you got some good shit man.

154
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:42,820
He knows has some good shit. Stillmatic
was that the name of that album?

155
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,690
It's still magic. The first
album, his album is universally,

156
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,950
the first album is universally recognized
as one of the great albums. Nomadic.

157
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,200
Yeah. He went through a period where
stuff wasn't nearly as good for a while.

158
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,620
It was interesting, but what
happened with him? I think the,

159
00:09:55,621 --> 00:10:00,621
the feud with him and Jay z like sort
of inspired him to get better because JC

160
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,470
called some of his shit garbage and
like, you know, Nas was like, Whoa, wait,

161
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:06,631
you know,

162
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:09,490
they have this thing back and forth and
then they got together and they were

163
00:10:09,491 --> 00:10:13,010
selling was ridiculous. Yeah. The
ether was but uh, he went after,

164
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,020
I just think nas was doing things and
got, you know, he made some money.

165
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:19,620
You got to remember he made that first
album when he was like 17 or something

166
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:20,150
man.

167
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:25,150
Like oh classic all time for ages
album at 17 or 18 years old tops.

168
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,200
When he was on his first record,
main source,

169
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:32,340
I think he was like 16 or 15 and
he like destroyed everybody on it.

170
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,350
Yeah. Live at the barbeque.
Huh? When I was 12,

171
00:10:37,351 --> 00:10:39,450
I went to hell for snuffin Jesus.

172
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,460
Yeah. He has some of the greatest lyrics
of all time. Some of the greatest,

173
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,550
most thought provoking lyrics of all time.

174
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:52,080
That whole first album and many
albums of his sentence were great,

175
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:56,490
but that first one was just dumb.
It's like when you capture it in the can,

176
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:58,840
that lightening and you got,
you know, all of it's perfect.

177
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,620
Now that Alpha is damn near.
Perfect. Did you ever seen the one,

178
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:04,650
there's one album that is not universally
thought of as being one of his best,

179
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:08,780
but the one with him, with the,
uh, the Sphinx face. What does it,

180
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,040
what does it like some sort of
Egyptian motor, another one with a,

181
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:14,250
you could hate me know and all that on
there. I don't remember. I don't know.

182
00:11:14,251 --> 00:11:18,190
Album names is wills. I know the song.
He's got a song on it called, um, there's,

183
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:22,200
there's welcome to the new world is one
of my favorite nas songs that nobody

184
00:11:22,201 --> 00:11:26,940
ever talks about. And it's him talking
about, let me see. Let me find his,

185
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:29,760
um, his Wikipedia here. It's,

186
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:33,930
it's a song you never hear people talk
about, but it's him talking about the vet.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,580
It was written. It might be, it might
be that. I think you might be right.

188
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,890
Let me see here. I am, see if you
can find Brian. See we'll, we'll,

189
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:46,410
we'll end with this. How much time we
got left. Seven minutes. Seven minutes.

190
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,010
You're on a time. There's now
three hours return to a pumpkin.

191
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,620
We only have three hours. Three hours.
The recordings over play a place.

192
00:11:54,621 --> 00:11:58,360
Some of I can remember we went
longer than three hours. Dude,

193
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:02,290
we've crushed it today. Today we
went with, we've accelerated time.

194
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:05,320
We made three hours. Seemed like
two hours. I thought he was wrong.

195
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,660
I like road the road. Is that
song? No, no, no, no, no.

196
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:11,590
It's called a welcome to the new world.
Welcome to the new world.

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,000
Welcome to the new road. Do you
find it go out on some nausea? Yeah.

198
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,770
Listen to this shit cause this is like
back when Roy Jones Jr was the baddest

199
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,260
motherfucker on earth.
This is like some,

200
00:12:23,261 --> 00:12:27,640
I think it was like the nineties I
want to say nineties does this nineties

201
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,580
90

202
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:34,940
but it's about technology in the future
and like where, where were the way that,

203
00:12:34,941 --> 00:12:37,540
I think I know the song you're talking
about but I have to hear to be refreshed.

204
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,750
It's really interesting because,
um,

205
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:45,810
it's on Sanford [inaudible] is in the era
when like he was going with production

206
00:12:45,811 --> 00:12:49,290
that I think more the labels and stuff
we're looking for that pop appeal.

207
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,530
I think he wasn't picking his beats
wisely in this little era that he got.

208
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,650
I think that's when only time
he got slowed down as well.

209
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,940
I think some long choices were made,

210
00:12:56,941 --> 00:13:01,710
I don't think had anything to do
with his stuff or his lyricism. Yeah.

211
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,790
See this is like, I've never been a fan
of outright ripping old songs like this.

212
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,780
Right. I've never been a fan of it. I mean
if you do it collaboratively and like,

213
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,600
like there's, there's producers
like guy like DJ premier,

214
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,390
they would take something like that and
chop it up into smaller pieces and turn

215
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:20,730
it into something new.
I'm a fan of that.

216
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,350
But when you just take an entire riff
and like recreate it and kind of almost

217
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:27,540
copy the song,
but just make it into a wrap,

218
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,620
like versus with like even
steal their hooks. Right.

219
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,850
Did I think pocketed it with like Bruce
Hornsby's just the way it is? Yeah.

220
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,410
I've never been a fan of those things.
That's been not,

221
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,490
that's probably why that song wasn't
so prevalent in my mind. I, yeah,

222
00:13:41,491 --> 00:13:44,290
I'm a real big fan of what he's
saying in it. It's fantastic,

223
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,520
but I agree with you. It's not the best
B. It's kind of annoying. Listened to,

224
00:13:47,521 --> 00:13:49,140
there was a little era
his where we got to,

225
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:53,640
the production got to clean for me like
I'm not, I should be on a grimy ass.

226
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,850
Yeah.
I mean once he came back,

227
00:13:56,851 --> 00:13:59,970
we eat there and then he came back with
the where he chopped up Apache for that

228
00:13:59,971 --> 00:14:03,660
made you look at your dad's where he
should be saying, you know what I mean?

229
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:07,260
Like I think the record labels and people
got to them and radio and the success

230
00:14:07,261 --> 00:14:10,170
you want when you're young and you
first get success, you want to,

231
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:13,260
you're listening to the people around you
and they're telling you you got a copy

232
00:14:13,261 --> 00:14:16,680
of that to keep getting your success
and you become either one or two things.

233
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:17,041
You know,

234
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:20,910
a guy that Oban that just makes that
formulaic album every time and you'll have

235
00:14:20,911 --> 00:14:23,640
some success for awhile or you
fall off the face of the planet,

236
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,600
you know what I mean?

237
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
Or you go back to what you know and be
the genius you are and don't trust what

238
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,450
everybody else was saying
and trust your guts. And Nas,

239
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,890
I'm sure even knew he
needed to be on to be,

240
00:14:32,891 --> 00:14:36,930
he's backway CHIBE he's been there for a
minute now. Yeah, he's back completely.

241
00:14:36,931 --> 00:14:41,580
His last few cds were fantastic.
Solutely yeah, he's, it's ether.

242
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:44,160
I think I've been enjoying ever since.
I think you're right about,

243
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,210
I think Jay z definitely sparked some
fire under his ass for sure. Yeah.

244
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,260
I think when someone calls you garbage,
just go,

245
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,600
well there's a lot more sad than that.

246
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,490
I don't know how close you
could pay attention you paid,

247
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,370
but there's a lot of things about people's
babies. Mom was getting fucked up,

248
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,970
like, you know, like Jay even
apologized on radio in New York.

249
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:00,260
There's a lot of like hip hop,

250
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:04,400
little folklore around that is his Jay's
mom supposedly made him go on the air

251
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,710
and apologize for some of these.
Oh,

252
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,330
there's a lot of that going around and
there was a lot more than just a wraps

253
00:15:11,331 --> 00:15:11,751
going on.

254
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:14,330
But it kind of goes back to what we
were talking about earlier that you said

255
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,111
that you need to produce.

256
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:17,980
So you need someone to argue with
sometimes the guy as good as Nas,

257
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:22,100
she challenges me. Yeah. Like Yo, it'd
be that's not as good as it could be.

258
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:24,380
Or maybe that's not the right
choice for that song. And,

259
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,550
and the way I've always looked at it as
if I was passionate enough about it and

260
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,800
it was opposed to be in there,
I would fight for it. Right.

261
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,400
But if you brought it up and I even
questioned him for a thing second,

262
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:36,120
take it in and say maybe then May,

263
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:39,260
than it deserves to be
mold over and thought about

264
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,910
[inaudible].
