1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:06,710
Start Broadcast and then update to 
update to twitter and then I always 

2
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:19,491
liked to watch my own channel,
so let's go to your own channel so you 

3
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,601
can see that the chat is your shows when
I press pause on that unit.

4
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,820
On this.
No,

5
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,890
no.
On the right.

6
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,660
And then a date year.
Internet tonight.

7
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,320
Update my married go faster.
One.

8
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,390
You're going to get addicted to those 
nice colors pretty before 21 minutes 

9
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,120
ago.
Oh,

10
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,130
that's twitter.
See now people are going to ask 

11
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,200
questions.
It's just twitter.

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,640
All right,
let me go to my website.

13
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,740
What does my ustream?
Yeah,

14
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,640
just click or go back to that other 
page.

15
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,650
You know,
but that's not.

16
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:39,480
I think this one is it one?
Is it?

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,140
Yeah,
you don't,

18
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:45,141
you don't want to have too many windows 
open because we're going to be killing 

19
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:47,331
your internet is killing it right now.
So I would except that one.

20
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:52,521
And now and maybe even close your tweet 
deck.

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,050
Really?
Well,

22
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,180
not tweet deck.
I guess it.

23
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:01,190
Let me give states everyone's going on.
Um,

24
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,330
she already say you're already getting 
it.

25
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,920
I think that's huge.
Yeah,

26
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,730
totally.
Oh yeah.

27
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:30,050
Screen Vernon.
Huh?

28
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,010
You got screen Bernan Hill you're 
talking about.

29
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,580
Go back to your message board for say 
that Tyler on the way.

30
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,600
Right?
See that?

31
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,600
Yeah.
What is that?

32
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,840
Looks like.
Screen burning.

33
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,560
Right?
But it's only the image that's.

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,560
But I think there's a transparency 
issue.

35
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,490
Okay.
What is the channel though?

36
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,540
This isn't the channel.
Is rates

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,840
try upstream upstream.
That TV backslash channel.

38
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,070
Joe Rogan life was like.
Yeah,

39
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,960
right there.
Try.

40
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,930
You can try it out.
Yeah.

41
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,940
Yeah.
Just killed it.

42
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,240
Damn.
This is slow as fuck,

43
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:36,160
right?
Yeah.

44
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,770
And then when we get fancy we can put 
your website address and we put graphics

45
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:03,640
and all that stuff.

46
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:09,660
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo 
Doo Doo Doo.

47
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,690
This is slow as fuck.
Pause that one screen.

48
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,510
You know where we're watching yourself 
live?

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:16,900
Yeah.

50
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,630
Okay.

51
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,090
Hi.

56
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:41,950
You know?

57
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,390
That's good.
We are broadcasting live.

58
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:05,770
This is my office says Brian,

59
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,190
Red Band.
Hello world.

60
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,930
Fuck is going on.
Uh,

61
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,200
the questions are coming in now.

62
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,130
How are you guys doing?
We,

63
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,900
we're doing swell.

64
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,340
I can't think of quite high enough for 
this.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I forgot we even started off camera.
Marijuana use bullet into the camera.

66
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,800
The fuck is that for fire in this room

67
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,660
as.
How is the quality of sound and video 

68
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:09,660
wise?

69
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,460
Yeah.
How's the quality sound video wise?

70
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,870
Does it sound right?
Can you see us?

71
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:16,871
All right?
When someone says they're already hard,

72
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,720
that's amazing.
We've got somebody's heart.

73
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,740
Dude.
This is not this.

74
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,180
See this right here.
This guy is above that.

75
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:38,410
But those guys.
And on this.

76
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,840
What's that all about?
See?

77
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:46,000
Yeah.
So we'd

78
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,950
dead air bad brogan.
Whereas going.

79
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:53,800
Yeah,
we just started this.

80
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,720
It's not very good.
I apologize.

81
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,800
It's that person probably.
No,

82
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,110
it's not.
See this guy right here?

83
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,840
More red.
See good sound quality.

84
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,670
Yeah.
The video.

85
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Oh,
let's see.

86
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,090
Different Guy,
his twitter,

87
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,750
his twitter tweets not coming through.
Oh,

88
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,450
that might be a.
and maybe something weird fight.

89
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,740
I was talking about that where they sit,
the sound and video.

90
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,470
Snowflakes falling or a bit annoying.
Oh,

91
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,660
come on.
It's Christmas.

92
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,920
Wouldn't make video and sound are okay.
But the snowflakes are annoying.

93
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,230
Does everybody feel like they're 
snowflakes are annoying?

94
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:30,880
Is just one dude that's kind of anal 
about what he looks at the screen.

95
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,740
Come on man.
It's beautiful snowflakes.

96
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,410
Merry Christmas.
You Fox.

97
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,210
Are you doing everybody?
Merry Christmas,

98
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:42,340
my friend.
You got to change it.

99
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,670
Now we'll just add something else called
bubbles to have bubbles.

100
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,880
Bubbles.
Bubbles will add levels.

101
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,910
And here it's just for 98 o two.
Cool.

102
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,940
And then we'll add a clock

103
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,720
for that guy.
This is for 2000.

104
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,690
No,
we don't need to kill the clock.

105
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,340
Clocks.
Ridiculous.

106
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,490
Anyways,
you can go through it and then if you 

107
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,490
want to,
an exit will take him off.

108
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,560
Oh,
this is good.

109
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,660
Comic Book.
What's coming next comic.

110
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,120
Oh,
that's okay.

111
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,970
Yeah.
So then you can see.

112
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,600
Scroll down.

113
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:29,650
Bubbles and snowflakes.
Let's see what flame on does that far.

114
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,780
That's good.
That either.

115
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:35,460
Hmm.

116
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,700
Glow.
Shall we go?

117
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:38,730
No,
Michelle.

118
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,040
Not.

119
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,650
And you could change like sometimes they
have options,

120
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:47,330
so if you wanted to glow less drag.
Oh let's go to the Matrix.

121
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,110
Black helicopters started acre.
Maybe it's just the matrix.

122
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,010
So where did I go see if you know.
This

123
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,770
is terrible.
Terrible idea.

124
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,010
NASA.
That's an asset.

125
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,710
Just don't pixelate pop art always 
looked gross.

126
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,930
Thermal thought bubble here again.
And then you could type in what you want

127
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,590
right there.
Oh,

128
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,150
I love it.
Okay,

129
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:22,580
that's good.

130
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,810
How much does this shit is annoying?
Probably the bubbles.

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,840
The bubbles are annoying and me just 
sitting in front of the fucking 

132
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:36,840
computer.
Just go on.

133
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,430
How about this?
How does an orange.

134
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,530
Because people watching this,
like why don't you show them this 

135
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:43,530
awesome box if somebody needed it?
Yeah.

136
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,610
This is an awesome boss.
That some wonderful couple hearings to 

137
00:09:48,281 --> 00:09:53,281
me.
I'm not sure of the dude made it or the 

138
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:53,281
girl made it.
But this is like a,

139
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:57,070
a killer stash box that this is to cool 
people gave me.

140
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,650
Well actually the guy made it 
[inaudible] the girl made the pipe.

141
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,130
Now remember the girls,
uh,

142
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:06,131
a glass blower.
But is this wild box would like this 

143
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:07,950
cool Alex Grey Art on it,
you know,

144
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,050
it's like really trippy stash box and 
some guy made it to me and gave it to me

145
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:16,660
after one of his shows.

146
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,420
I wish I knew the dude's name because 
it's very cool.

147
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,110
And the box has like little place where 
you would keep your tobacco.

148
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,630
She made this killer a little pipe and 
he may get it away from the snowflakes,

149
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,870
but uh,
whoever they are,

150
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,670
if they're watching this,
highly unlikely.

151
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,010
But if nobody's watching this,
don't do what?

152
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,300
We have 10 people in here now.
Is this Channel One hundred 13 already?

153
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,430
Wow.
Okay.

154
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,670
This is like a 13 people's,
like a show at a comedy club.

155
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,720
Now I feel pressure.
He's got a weird hundred 30 peoples.

156
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,070
Like we have to be a,
we have to be entertaining.

157
00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,690
So let's read the twitter feed and see 
what the fuck is up.

158
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,220
Bitches.
Let's see.

159
00:11:03,221 --> 00:11:04,360
To stash,
how dare you.

160
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,510
It's not a stash.
This is Madison.

161
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,740
It's called train wreck.
And you see her right there.

162
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:13,540
And you see right there,
this,

163
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,640
if you don't know if you're from out of 
town,

164
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,970
that Red Cross and the marijuana leaf,
this is medical marijuana,

165
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,130
so this is totally legal in the state of
California.

166
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,580
It's pretty trippy because you drive 
down the street and I was driving those 

167
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,300
street yesterday and we were looking for
places where we could,

168
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:32,430
uh,
you know,

169
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,660
we could see how many places are near my
house.

170
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,780
There's like fucking 20 places within a 
couple miles of my house that I can go.

171
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,210
And a lot of them they just say collike 
collective on it.

172
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:44,340
It'll say like,
you know,

173
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,460
West hills collective or you know,
fucking Dick Street collective,

174
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,290
whatever.
And it'll have a red cross.

175
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,630
And that's all you need to know.
And everybody knows that it's weed.

176
00:11:52,631 --> 00:11:55,830
They have letters,
everybody uses green letters and they're

177
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,220
everywhere.
And you go.

178
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:00,370
And if you have one of these right here,
this is Brian,

179
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,560
you see this,
this is a real legitimate recommendation

180
00:12:05,561 --> 00:12:09,730
from a doctor and this,
all you do is you go to a doctor,

181
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:11,500
you say,
marijuana helps me sleep,

182
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:11,950
whatever.

183
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,400
And the doctor will give you one of 
these legitimate recommendations up 

184
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
upper a legal prescription state of 
California for marijuana.

185
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,040
And then you go to these places and some
of them you can pay with a credit card.

186
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:29,041
So trippiest thing ever.
You buy weed with a credit card and 

187
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:29,200
you're like,
what year is this?

188
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,570
Two thousand and nine.
But the rest of the country still living

189
00:12:31,571 --> 00:12:34,240
in the dark ages.
Colorado is catching up.

190
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:37,610
Colorado has a bunch of places now 
Colorado actually is going to open up a,

191
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:42,611
um,
a medical marijuana restaurant and 

192
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,241
they're gonna open up some 30,000
square foot weeds superstore and 

193
00:12:45,241 --> 00:12:46,360
boulders fucking gigantic.
It's like three stories.

194
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:51,361
Isn't Texas even doing like a vote soon 
or a lot of people are trying in a lot 

195
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:55,960
of states are trying to chat.
A Massachusetts recently made it,

196
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,370
uh,
they decriminalized it.

197
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,700
It was a,
they don't have any medical law yet 

198
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,850
there,
but now it's completely not legal,

199
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,290
but it's not illegal.

200
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,540
It's a weird thing.
Like you're not allowed to sell it.

201
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,540
Like possession is one thing,
but selling it as a different thing,

202
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,460
you're still not allowed to sell it,
which is fine.

203
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:13,850
Like people fucking grow it,
you know?

204
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,100
Really fucking hunter.
S Thompson had it,

205
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:19,360
right?
Hunter s Thompson.

206
00:13:19,361 --> 00:13:24,361
When he was running for sheriff,
he was saying that no drug good enough 

207
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:24,970
to be taken,
should be allowed to be sold.

208
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,420
That was like a law that he's going to 
pass in Aspen and he was to call aspen 

209
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,841
fat city.
It's going to change the name of Aspen 

210
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:34,150
to fat city who's going to tear up all 
the roads and saw the streets.

211
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,160
So it was all dirt roads everywhere and 
fucking lost by 400 votes.

212
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,350
It's only 400 votes.
He can't.

213
00:13:41,351 --> 00:13:42,100
He,
if he won,

214
00:13:42,101 --> 00:13:42,850
if he was the,
the,

215
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,410
the,
the sheriff of Aspen,

216
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:45,670
that would've been fucking bad ass.

217
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:50,710
But one of the things that he wanted to 
have was that any drug that you can take

218
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:53,140
that was good enough to be taken,
should it be legal?

219
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,090
And he's fucking totally right.
You know,

220
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,860
if people want weed,
it should be.

221
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,330
People should trade things where we,
oh,

222
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,230
you know what,
fuck it,

223
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,060
you should be able to buy it if you want
to,

224
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,160
but the problem with that is,
you know,

225
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,190
then you're going to get some really 
unscrupulous people that just want to 

226
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,190
sell pot,
you know,

227
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,900
they just want sell it and they didn't 
want to make profit off of it.

228
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:12,970
And then it becomes like anything else,
the,

229
00:14:12,971 --> 00:14:14,950
they try to cut out the competition.
Like,

230
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,750
like one of the weed stores that I go 
to,

231
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:20,800
there's a guy right next door to them,
the that opened up like I'm talking like

232
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:21,610
right next door.

233
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,610
Like there's maybe like one storefront 
between two weeds doors and the guy's 

234
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,200
pissed off and he's,
fuck,

235
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:32,230
this guy's a dick.
That's totally not in the spirit of you 

236
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:32,290
know what marijuana is supposed to be.
I mean,

237
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:37,291
you're not supposed to be opening up 
right next store to a dude until his 

238
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:37,960
competition,
but he shouldn't be like,

239
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,410
fuck that dude.
That dude,

240
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,170
dude,
he's just another dude selling weed.

241
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:46,410
Yeah.
I shouldn't be doing it right next to 

242
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,410
you.
Yes,

243
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:46,410
correct.
But don't be an asshole.

244
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,970
You're fucking selling wheat.
Hell no,

245
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,720
you ain't fixing the hunter.
S Thompson is my hero and I'm planning 

246
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:58,100
full sleeves of Ralph steadman.
Art.

247
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,090
Are you really?
Wow.

248
00:14:59,091 --> 00:15:02,360
That's a fucking good idea.
Stedman,

249
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,350
Stedman or Steedman.
I forget.

250
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:06,500
I say his name is Steven fucking.
I love his art.

251
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,660
His art.
It's perfectly.

252
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,110
Goes like a.
what's the word I'm looking for?

253
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,510
Compliments.
Hunter s Thompson's writing.

254
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,480
You know,
that guy just fucking nailed it from the

255
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,940
very first time they work together.
When they did that.

256
00:15:19,941 --> 00:15:24,941
Um,
the Kentucky Derby is decadent and 

257
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:27,010
depraved from that story all the way on 
to fear and loathing in Las Vegas stuff.

258
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,030
Ralph Guy,
he fucking nailed it.

259
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:29,840
He,
he was here.

260
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,640
He's hanging with hunter.
He totally got the vibe that,

261
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,330
that hunter was writing.
He totally got where hunter was.

262
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:36,860
Seeing things,
you know,

263
00:15:36,861 --> 00:15:39,710
I've just started getting into hunter s 
Thompson really recently.

264
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,380
I was a,
I guess maybe a year and a half ago.

265
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:47,300
I was staying in a hotel room in Seattle
and I ordered up a Gonzo on the,

266
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:52,301
uh,
the paper view and the hotel just 

267
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:52,301
because nothing else look good.
Said,

268
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:56,831
fuck it,
I'll just check this out and I'm 

269
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:56,831
immediately became a hunter.
S Thompson fan started reading his books

270
00:15:56,831 --> 00:16:01,601
and I'm reading the One,
I'm reading what I'm reading now.

271
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,670
It's this one great shark.
It's great.

272
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:15,671
It's got everything in there.
So a bunch of different shifts here and 

273
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:16,460
load things in there.
The Kentucky Derby's a lot.

274
00:16:16,461 --> 00:16:18,560
A lot of great stores like a collection 
of his works,

275
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the quintessential well need to open 
grow homes with retail fronts.

276
00:16:25,731 --> 00:16:27,290
Yeah man,
keep it easy.

277
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:32,291
That's what I'm talking about.
If you've never been to a grow room 

278
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:32,291
before,
I've only been to one grow room.

279
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,290
It was pretty interesting.
There was a um,

280
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,590
a place in la where they,
uh,

281
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,920
they,
it was a full service place.

282
00:16:36,921 --> 00:16:41,430
You can get a prescription there,
you could get weed there and you could a

283
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:43,340
picture with me.

284
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,790
The Kid,
uh,

285
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,850
get weed there and they grew it.
So there was like this back room where 

286
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,790
they had all these lights set up and it 
was pretty fucking tripping man.

287
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,850
Like it was a,
a big ass room and it was filled with 

288
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,160
these plants and they were all lit up 
and you walked through the plants and if

289
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,540
like,
yeah they were alive,

290
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,980
you know,
they're living plants,

291
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,740
but it felt like,
like they were conscious.

292
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,790
Maybe it was because I was really high.
That might be,

293
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,000
but maybe because I was really high I 
was able to tune into it.

294
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:16,490
But it was,
it was a very weird sensation.

295
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:20,540
It felt like I was around like living 
entities.

296
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,550
Like it didn't just feel like they were 
plants.

297
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,750
It felt like they were alive,
you know?

298
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,210
It was very strange.
It was cool.

299
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,200
I thought about,
I was like,

300
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:28,850
that'd be cool to have something like 
that in my house,

301
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,360
but that's pretty illegal federally.
At least,

302
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,770
you know,
if they caught you with a bunch of 

303
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:37,770
plants in your house,
you know,

304
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:37,770
and they'd be like,
hey bitch,

305
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,560
what are you doing with those?
You're allowed to have.

306
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,430
Yeah.
Are we allowed to have a bunch?

307
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,890
You can have up to six plants.
I did actually,

308
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,020
because you have that x.
Oh that's right.

309
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:50,021
I haven't exemption because I'm a 
fucking real stoner is to have these 

310
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,550
fucking with us here.

311
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,560
No,
but you can.

312
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,360
You can totally turn off that second 
one.

313
00:17:57,361 --> 00:17:58,050
Just one.
Yeah.

314
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,820
Sorry folks.
Getting organized.

315
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,990
This is the first time I've.
I,

316
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,050
I'm always threatening to do some shit 
like this and I never followed through.

317
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,740
Why were the UFC ring?
Girls fired?

318
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,810
I do not know.
They were very nice.

319
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,260
All of them were two girls were fired.
They left Mariani.

320
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,230
Who?
A very nice person as well.

321
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,570
I've been friends with her for years.
She's super cool.

322
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:23,350
Chick and I very hot.
Probably classically beautiful,

323
00:18:23,351 --> 00:18:25,300
like it doesn't get anymore.
Beautiful face.

324
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,300
Very nice person too.
You can follow her on twitter.

325
00:18:28,301 --> 00:18:29,570
She's on twitter.
She wants.

326
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,150
It's the one with the fake wigs.
Still working.

327
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,010
What are you talking about?
Fake Wig.

328
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,690
Dare you.
First of all,

329
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:39,070
how dare you?
How dare you fuck with her whole career.

330
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,970
One with the fake wig.
She has a.

331
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,220
are you talking about

332
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,690
the one with the big hair then?
Seventies hair.

333
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,340
She looks like she has seventies.
Harold Hamm.

334
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,110
She just started like maybe.
Oh the.

335
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:48,840
Yeah.

336
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,040
Her name was logan.
She did not have fake here.

337
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,360
That was her hair was real.
Yeah.

338
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,180
Should we just have some curly hair and 
that social workers.

339
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,970
Very recognized girl.

340
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,470
The Atlanta housewives thing you need to
have that wakes are back,

341
00:19:00,471 --> 00:19:01,460
so I thought that was all of those.

342
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,400
You might be right.
It might be right.

343
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,020
Unless you're watching housewives of 
Atlanta show.

344
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,490
There's nothing like.
First of all,

345
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:14,491
there's nothing like white girls around 
black girls when they start talking 

346
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:14,491
black.
I read that Shit.

347
00:19:14,491 --> 00:19:16,000
I love when white guys do it.
I love them.

348
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:17,260
White girls do it.
To me,

349
00:19:17,261 --> 00:19:20,620
it's just like watching chimps.
If the zoo,

350
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,330
when they fuck each other and they go 
crazy,

351
00:19:22,331 --> 00:19:22,790
it's like,
wow,

352
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:23,570
look at.
This is weird.

353
00:19:23,571 --> 00:19:25,750
This is interesting.
But white people around black people,

354
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:30,751
they start acting black.
There's no better example than the 

355
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:30,751
Steven Seagal show.
Holy Shit.

356
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:32,900
Have you seen what he does that he pulls
up to a group of black people.

357
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:34,480
It's like,
what up Cuz what's going up?

358
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,490
Oh Dude.
Much love,

359
00:19:36,491 --> 00:19:38,530
much love.
He talks black,

360
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,070
like really condescendingly and then you
know when he's in the car.

361
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,900
When the cameras aren't,
he'll talk like Buddhist,

362
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,820
he says,
he says stupid shit,

363
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:50,821
you know,
the one monk was walking with the 

364
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:53,760
younger monk and the younger monk says,
what is the way of Buddha that way?

365
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,590
And so the older monk throws him in the 
water deep.

366
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,700
He talks like he's two totally different
dudes.

367
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:05,701
He talks like the Steven Seagal,
who's like the mystical man and the 

368
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:09,091
Steven Seagal who is this fucking 
strange cop in Louisiana.

369
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,340
He has a southern accent that he uses 
part of the time,

370
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,460
part of the time and then occasionally 
he drops a southern accent and he goes 

371
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,550
with a full on black accent like waves 
in the hood,

372
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,460
but Steven Seagal is a fucking cop,
like for real.

373
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,580
Like he puts on a bulletproof vest.
He gets in his fucking car and they go 

374
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,390
fight crime and it's like,
who is letting him do this?

375
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,530
Like how crazy is that?
All you have to have is a cup of fucking

376
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,390
movies.
You've seen his website.

377
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,320
Oh,
genius.

378
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,490
Yeah,
it's awesome.

379
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,170
Is it Steven Seagal Dot com?

380
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,520
I think so.
I've seen Jim.

381
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:44,521
Can you seen Jim Carey's website?
Has the most amazing website and the 

382
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:46,210
whole entire room.
It's a pretty cool.

383
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,220
I've never seen better website.
Yeah,

384
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,540
it's very,
very unique,

385
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,930
but when I see websites like that,
I wish I still tripped on shrooms all 

386
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:55,910
the time because I would just sit at his
website.

387
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,790
Yeah,
no shit.

388
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,970
Oh,
beyond the mind.

389
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,060
Xy is fucking.
What the fuck.

390
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:10,030
He's going to attack this behind me.
The sign is a point of controversy from 

391
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:13,930
dementia.
When I hosted the.

392
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:14,830
I know.
It's terrible.

393
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,440
Listen,
we thought it was terrible too.

394
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,370
We got.
We got fucked when we.

395
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:20,200
When Doug Stam hope,
but I want to do that show.

396
00:21:20,201 --> 00:21:22,360
They lie to us.
They told us you can do nudity.

397
00:21:22,361 --> 00:21:24,070
We'll blur it out.
You can swear.

398
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:25,690
We'll beep it out.
We want you to go crazy.

399
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:27,730
We want to get sued.
It's going to be great publicity.

400
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,100
And then when we started doing it,
first of all,

401
00:21:30,101 --> 00:21:35,101
Janet Jackson,
polar nipple out and everybody went 

402
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:35,680
fucking crazy.
Crazy feeling the effects from that.

403
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,330
So amazing.
Like literally,

404
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,360
television got set back a decade because
of Janet Jackson's nipple and the big 

405
00:21:43,361 --> 00:21:48,361
thing was that they were showing it 
during the dinner hour and children are 

406
00:21:48,361 --> 00:21:49,150
watching.
Well isn't a woman's nipple,

407
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,270
are we that fucking crazy.
It's not like she had a rifle up her 

408
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:54,490
pussy.
It's a fucking nipple,

409
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,370
you know?
That's where babies feet.

410
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,140
It's.
Is it that offensive babies?

411
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,000
It is,
man.

412
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,210
That's the first one.
We're talking about it during the,

413
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,350
during the dinner hour.
Somebody had a really good point when 

414
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:07,350
this happened.
Like he said,

415
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,430
isn't that like the first meal?
That's like the dinner breasts.

416
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,290
Yeah.
You see that when you.

417
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,550
Since you were a kid.
Well,

418
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,720
you know,
especially having kids on my own now 

419
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,880
when I see Mrs Rogan make fucking milk 
with their tents and the tents are dead 

420
00:22:21,721 --> 00:22:22,930
to me.
I don't suck on them anymore.

421
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,810
But what's more important is that you 
look at them and you say,

422
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:30,020
that's like those are.
That's like where food comes from.

423
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:33,250
Like it's not offensive.
But anyway,

424
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,280
this thing behind us make me hard.
This is how fucking stupid they were 

425
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,640
when we were doing the show.
There was an argument and we hit,

426
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:44,641
we came up with a game show called you 
make me hard and what it was is the guy 

427
00:22:44,641 --> 00:22:47,980
would be strapped into a chair and he to
have this box on his dick and with a 

428
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,330
light would go off on the box and you 
know,

429
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,450
the light would indicate that he has a 
boner and so we'd have like midgets 

430
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:54,450
eating bananas and Shit.
No.

431
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:54,610
Oh,
he's getting hard.

432
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,290
You know,
we,

433
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,250
it was Kinda Corny,
but what we really.

434
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:02,251
The reason why we did it is one of the 
gags was we had this really hot chick 

435
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,640
and she climbs all over him.

436
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,490
The audience is going fucking crazy.
They're going nuts.

437
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,300
And this really hot chick at the end of 
this,

438
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,090
he pulls her tits out.
He's sucking on a tense whipped cream,

439
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:18,091
the whole deal.
And then she pulls her panties off and 

440
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,360
she's got a dick and the audience goes 
crazy.

441
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:24,361
She was a tranny and I mean I've never 
heard a bigger wave of disappointment 

442
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:29,490
that when this,
this tranny pulls out this Dick and she 

443
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,060
was taking all kinds of hormones,
so it was like addicted,

444
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:32,350
had been poisoned.
It looked like dead.

445
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:37,351
It was like dark.
It was dark and shriveled up like it 

446
00:23:37,351 --> 00:23:37,900
burned,
like chemically burned.

447
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,300
Like it was like a little little dead 
monkey dick and smell it.

448
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,370
And she pulled it out and she starts 
like swinging it around in the fucking 

449
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,650
audience went crazy and the guy sitting 
in the chair just had this look on his 

450
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:50,650
face of horror.

451
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,190
Well,
they approved all that,

452
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:56,240
but what they wouldn't approve is that 
the name of the show make me hard.

453
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,810
They said that we had a name is show,
make me stiff.

454
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:03,650
I guess like an argument like for real,
like there's a difference.

455
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,200
Like they,
they mean the same thing just to make me

456
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:09,410
stiff doesn't sound,
it doesn't sound quite as funny.

457
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,090
Really doesn't matter.
I mean what's the difference?

458
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,370
But the point was that they were willing
to argue this.

459
00:24:13,371 --> 00:24:16,580
That was a big deal for them.
And that shows you how these shows work,

460
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,410
the best shows like,
like standup Comedians,

461
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,420
like if you take a guy like Dave 
Chappelle or you know Kat Williams or 

462
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,640
anybody,
any good comic that you like,

463
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,490
they write all their own shit.
They write it,

464
00:24:28,491 --> 00:24:33,491
they perform it,
they're saying shit that they think is 

465
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:33,491
funny.
They're the producer,

466
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:33,491
they are the performer there.

467
00:24:33,491 --> 00:24:34,760
The whole ball of wax or the writer 
there,

468
00:24:34,761 --> 00:24:39,761
everything.
And that's why you get a pure product 

469
00:24:39,761 --> 00:24:39,830
because you get a product that's from 
this dudes mind.

470
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,090
Well what happens is when you like start
working on a television show,

471
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,850
these people that are working for the 
network,

472
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,870
somebody has to work for the network and
you would assume that the people at the 

473
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,960
very top of the food chain are the 
perfect people for the job.

474
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,110
But that's not true.
They're just people that somehow or 

475
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:56,110
another got that fucking job and a lot 
of them,

476
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:57,710
they like to think that they know what's
good.

477
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,860
They like to think they have an iphone 
and they always want to put their 

478
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,200
footprint on it.
They want to put their hand print on it.

479
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:06,290
They want to change something and 
anything that we,

480
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,550
I think the background should be blue.

481
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,190
We're going to ruin the whole show with 
this red background and they'll go crazy

482
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,870
and they'll fucking fight over this.
Why?

483
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,580
Because they want to be the ones say,
well,

484
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,590
it wasn't me that decided for the blue 
background.

485
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:16,910
If they didn't go with that blue 
background,

486
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:21,911
the was shit and my right,
and then the wife will agree with them 

487
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:24,281
and they all get fucking pilled up 
together that this is what they argued 

488
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:24,281
over.
Make me hard.

489
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:28,811
So this is the.
I got to keep this sign because it was 

490
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:29,030
useless because we had to change the 
sign to make me stiff.

491
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,430
Like it's okay to pull out your fucking 
Dick.

492
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,480
It's okay to have a guy strapped to a 
chair thinking a chick is on top of them

493
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:38,840
and this chick pulls out this wrinkled,
poisoned black Dick.

494
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,660
That's okay,
but you can't call it hard.

495
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,700
You have to call it stiff.
It's really that dumb.

496
00:25:43,701 --> 00:25:48,701
It seems like I would be exaggerating,
but that's why Dave Chappelle walked 

497
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:49,150
away from the Chappelle show.
It's just because having.

498
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:54,160
When you're a comic,
having somebody else tell you what's 

499
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,441
good and what's bad.
Like there was one of the things we did 

500
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:56,441
in the man show where we want to.
Joey ideas.

501
00:25:56,441 --> 00:25:58,100
If you don't know what Joey Diaz is,
his,

502
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,630
uh,
twitter is mad flavor.

503
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:04,631
One word at mad flavor.
And Joey Diaz is one of the funniest 

504
00:26:04,631 --> 00:26:06,920
dudes I've ever met in my life.
He's one of the funniest human beings to

505
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:09,500
ever live.
And Joey was like 350 pounds.

506
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,990
He's down to 300,
but back then it was like 3:50

507
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,690
and he would always get naked.
We get naked all the time,

508
00:26:14,691 --> 00:26:19,691
getting naked onstage.
And his balls literally look like 

509
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:19,880
grapefruit.
And an old ladies pantyhose.

510
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,250
I mean they're fucking ridiculous and he
doesn't shave them,

511
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,710
but they have no hair on him.
Like he has no hair on his arms,

512
00:26:24,711 --> 00:26:27,230
no hair on his chest.
And he's fat as fuck.

513
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,290
And we wanted to have him introduce us 
at the beginning of every show.

514
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,560
He kicks open this door and comes out,
yell,

515
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:35,310
and let's get this party started.
And his balls and Jangling.

516
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,160
It's fucking hilarious.
First of all,

517
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,380
it's hilarious because Joey's hilarious,
no matter what he could read,

518
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:44,620
Doug Stanhope said Jody is could read 
the phone book and it'd be fired than 

519
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:44,620
most of the shit you see late night tv 
and that's totally true,

520
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,560
but they were like,
that's not funny.

521
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,360
What's funny about this,
this is not funny.

522
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,790
No one's going to lie.
It was like a big argument and I said,

523
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:52,230
listen,
let's do two openings.

524
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,470
Will do one regular opening and then 
we'll do one opening with joey.

525
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Well,
we did the opening with joey and they 

526
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,451
went fucking crazy.
Of course everybody was screaming and 

527
00:27:02,451 --> 00:27:05,871
laughing and it set the tone.
The tone that we wanted to have like 

528
00:27:05,871 --> 00:27:06,600
this is we're just trying to have fun.
We're not,

529
00:27:06,601 --> 00:27:08,560
you know,
we're not trying to be relevant or what.

530
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:11,190
We're just trying to have something that
people enjoy.

531
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,830
Let's have fun.
Let's have a fucking good time.

532
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,800
But it was almost impossible to try to 
have that good time.

533
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,880
When you have,
you know,

534
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:22,881
other people like that aren't 
necessarily funny at all and they're 

535
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:25,230
like putting their input into what's 
what should be in this comedy show.

536
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,620
So Doug and I got fucked,
but the most important thing is that we 

537
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:30,620
had a good time and we came.
Well,

538
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,680
we were always good friends,
but we became great friends.

539
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:37,320
All right.
What else was going on here?

540
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,300
The snowflakes.
What?

541
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:41,990
You don't like the snowflakes to 
dragging the video stream down.

542
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:42,660
Oh,
you know what?

543
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:47,310
You might be right dude.
The snowflakes might be fucking us.

544
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
No more snow flakes.
Is that better everybody?

545
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,010
I'm sure it's bad.
My fucking.

546
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,240
My Internet's gay.
You need to upgrade that.

547
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,660
I can't believe you have.
You haven't done that.

548
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,870
I live used to be on top of the game I 
live in.

549
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,000
I know you.
He.

550
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,870
He used to have the fastest Internet 
back when the Internet was,

551
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,000
you know,
28 k,

552
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,940
56.
K used to have one back.

553
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,900
When did not.
I asked the ice isdn first.

554
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:17,901
Then I got a t one line installed in my 
house where I'm 56 k modem for business.

555
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,640
Those lines,
I mean they only had of their businesses

556
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:25,641
and uh,
I live a way the fuck outside of La and 

557
00:28:25,641 --> 00:28:29,810
um,
it took a long time for us to get like 

558
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,060
Dsl and shit out here.
Like I couldn't get cable.

559
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,580
I used to have to get a satellite 
DIRECTV.

560
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,170
So,
so they,

561
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:35,310
um,
they,

562
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,840
the only thing they have that was really
fast,

563
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,950
this thing called a t one line,
but it was a thousand bucks a month that

564
00:28:40,951 --> 00:28:42,630
goes on news radio.
I was like,

565
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,880
I was totally new rich,
you know,

566
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,110
I was like,
okay.

567
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
So when that happened,
when I was like,

568
00:28:51,001 --> 00:28:51,630
okay,
let's do it,

569
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,490
thousand bucks a month,
come on.

570
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,280
And so I got this crazy super fast 
internet pipe installed in my house,

571
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:03,130
but now I got this gay dsl that's just 
not very powerful.

572
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,990
I need to upgrade.
I'm going to get some of that at.

573
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,140
And t uverse loving what else we got 
here.

574
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,210
Much better.
So much better.

575
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,140
Thank you.
Good.

576
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,490
Awesome.
Because once you get that,

577
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:20,491
then that's why I asked you get a Wifi 
check the dude in the background for a 

578
00:29:20,491 --> 00:29:24,220
pulse.
It might be a vampire

579
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:29,700
team.
Jacob fuck is going on with America.

580
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:32,940
We have rock stars that don't fuck the 
Jonas brothers.

581
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,410
We've got vampires.
Don't buy it.

582
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:34,560
Anyway.

583
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,200
We have pop stars that can't go to 
sleep,

584
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:41,820
so they,
they,

585
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:46,150
they get literally said dated every 
night we have Golfer's getting fucked.

586
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,350
We got to America.
That's freaking out because an ugly rich

587
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:54,100
guy is getting a lot of pussy,
a cheat on his wife.

588
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:56,980
He's his wife.
He's a black athlete.

589
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,580
Like,
is that really a big shot?

590
00:29:59,581 --> 00:30:02,530
I didn't say ugly.
It's amazing that a guy like that,

591
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:07,560
all he has to do is be good at something
and acquire a bunch of numbers and he 

592
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:09,280
could fuck all these girls.
Like he's sending the pain.

593
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,530
These girls.
It's incredible because one of the girls

594
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:14,200
was like asking for money and he's like,
I can't help you.

595
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:17,830
It's like she's not even paying them.
So he's just like billionaire dude,

596
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,920
and he's banging these cocktail 
waitresses and they're struggling with 

597
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:22,920
their bills and he wanted to go over any
cash.

598
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,370
Like how hard would it be for tiger 
woods?

599
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:26,550
It just slipper 10 grand.
You know what,

600
00:30:26,551 --> 00:30:27,520
what's the big deal?
She,

601
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,400
she lets you fucker like,
do you have a mirror in your house?

602
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,260
Like you're getting something out of 
this man.

603
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,320
You get to fuck her.
And all he wanted was to just give them 

604
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:37,450
Dick like that's all you get.
You get Dick,

605
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:42,960
you don't get no money.
On one hand I got to say the dude had a 

606
00:30:43,181 --> 00:30:45,160
very strong pimp pant,
you know,

607
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:45,540
the,
I,

608
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:50,610
I of respect that.
But on the other hand I would feel like 

609
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:53,760
maybe you should give her some money.
Maybe she wouldn't be making a tell all 

610
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,140
book if you were like really nice to her
and she gave you.

611
00:30:55,141 --> 00:30:56,320
Gave her the money that she needed.

612
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,630
Yeah.
Tiger is handsome.

613
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,580
So it says gay man Cintas is tigers 
handsome?

614
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,840
Okay.
You know what?

615
00:31:05,841 --> 00:31:07,790
He's not ugly,
but he's not like,

616
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,760
it's not.
Jacob Looks Kinda like a bug.

617
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,060
He's not a handsome man.
He's unfortunate looking,

618
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:14,990
you know?
I mean

619
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,100
he's very well built.
He's very athletic.

620
00:31:17,101 --> 00:31:19,860
He's obviously very driven.
He's got a lot of attractive qualities.

621
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:23,370
Uber successful.
But you can't say that he's,

622
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,380
you know,
I mean like whose class?

623
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,480
They don't like your guys.
You don't like your guy's black.

624
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:31,300
Sure I do.
Was like that Tyrese Dude,

625
00:31:31,301 --> 00:31:33,370
that actor dude,
that's a very handsome man.

626
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:38,640
That's a handsome motherfucker.
If you found out that he was banging 16 

627
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:38,640
checks across the country,
you'd be like,

628
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,601
that's it.
I'm going to figure you out fucking 10 

629
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:43,330
in each talent he was plowing.
That guy's a stud,

630
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,100
you know?
But Tiger doesn't look like that.

631
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,130
Tiger doesn't agree on male model.
He looks like an unfortunate mix of 

632
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:50,130
ethnicities.
Hey,

633
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,100
but you know,
whatever,

634
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,990
whatever.
Hey,

635
00:31:54,991 --> 00:31:56,660
look,
band out.

636
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:01,360
Please look on that dude from Kroll.
Oh No.

637
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,440
The movie crawl.
You know,

638
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,970
where's the fucking shit that a

639
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,730
pan's labyrinth thing that had the eyes 
and it scans that were mode del Toro.

640
00:32:10,731 --> 00:32:11,930
Dude,
it's pretty bad ass.

641
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:15,200
But I got to say his book sucks.
The strain.

642
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,360
A really good book for like the first 
100 pages and then either tired of 

643
00:32:21,741 --> 00:32:26,741
writing.
It just fucking just finished it like 

644
00:32:26,741 --> 00:32:27,080
real sloppy,
like really bad action scenes.

645
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,060
Really killing the vampires like so 
easy.

646
00:32:29,061 --> 00:32:31,260
It was really stupid.
It was really good.

647
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:33,050
At the beginning I was like,
what a great premise.

648
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,510
The fucking airplane lands.
Everybody in the plane is dead.

649
00:32:35,511 --> 00:32:40,511
They can't figure out what's going on.
And the alternative vampires that takes 

650
00:32:40,511 --> 00:32:42,971
over the whole city,
it's pretty bad ass is one vampire like 

651
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,840
infected the whole plane.
But then it just turns into dog shit.

652
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,740
Most of the 16 holes aren't that 
attractive.

653
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,410
This man is saying that,
that,

654
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:55,230
that guy was not being pretty girls.
He had a few stragglers in there,

655
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:58,650
but overall those chips are pretty God 
damn hot.

656
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,720
You know better than what that person's 
getting.

657
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,420
This guy right here,
he might be getting,

658
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:08,930
but I mean some of them like that.
Rachel Uchitel check that shakes hot as 

659
00:33:08,941 --> 00:33:13,941
fuck.
And then the other one that was on the 

660
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:13,941
reality TV,
she's pretty God damn hot too.

661
00:33:13,941 --> 00:33:16,920
He had some pretty,
pretty attractive women in a stable.

662
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,280
What's jody is twitter game?
Mad Flavor.

663
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:21,990
Good.
See,

664
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:23,260
this is one of the things that we can 
do.

665
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,990
You can hit this text,
add any texts,

666
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,320
and so if anyone ever asks you,
you can just take the info.

667
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:29,390
Here we go.
I'll tell you.

668
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:34,430
Follow and red band.
I know you have a thousand yet.

669
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:42,860
You don't know her?
I never on my twitter.

670
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:46,560
Oh yeah.
You guys got to follow red band and then

671
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,580
you could shrink the size and font size.
Yeah.

672
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,920
If you just drag the thing left and 
right.

673
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,630
There we go.
Then you can move the box.

674
00:33:58,631 --> 00:34:00,290
They may made it to the top or 
something.

675
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,110
That's wherever their location is or the
bottom

676
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,160
doesn't want to move.

677
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,150
You just click on the box and then drag 
it.

678
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,900
Okay.
Do the other way.

679
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,030
You wouldn't do it.
Rarely.

680
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,200
Hip position and then just dry.
Won't let me do that black box.

681
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:19,900
I.
No,

682
00:34:19,901 --> 00:34:20,860
it won't let me grab.
Oh,

683
00:34:20,861 --> 00:34:24,700
there we go.
You fucking pitch

684
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:32,830
golden news radio or a factor.
Which show was more disgusting to work 

685
00:34:33,781 --> 00:34:36,330
on.
Fear factor for sure.

686
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
But fear factor paid more money,
but newsradio was way more fun.

687
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,500
News radio was a news.
Radio was like a privilege,

688
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,220
you know?
I was like,

689
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:45,800
what?
The whole time I was doing his art,

690
00:34:45,801 --> 00:34:47,190
Kenny believe,
first of all,

691
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:49,320
I couldn't believe that I was on a TV 
show that was just like.

692
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,760
Because I didn't,
I didn't really do much acting before 

693
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,821
that.
I acted on one other sitcom that I got 

694
00:34:58,821 --> 00:35:01,431
from doing standup comedy and in 
Nineteen Ninety four I've only been 

695
00:35:01,431 --> 00:35:03,990
doing comedy six years,
so it's like I was still pretty raw as a

696
00:35:03,991 --> 00:35:07,560
comedian and then all of a sudden I'm on
this fucking TV shows like,

697
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:09,090
Whoa,
now I'm on the show.

698
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,610
Not only am I not a TV show,
I'm on a TV show with Phil Hartman,

699
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:13,920
and I was like,
this is fucking nuts,

700
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:14,840
you know?
And,

701
00:35:14,841 --> 00:35:19,830
and Dave Foley and Andy Dekoman,
it's pretty incredible job.

702
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,460
But a fear factor was just about getting
clean,

703
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,960
getting there.
You know what I'm saying?

704
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:29,790
She ain't gonna just like King Mo says,
get that pipe.

705
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:34,870
Brittany Murphy.
Thoughts you don't want me to.

706
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,930
I don't have any thoughts until I find 
out what children,

707
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,880
you know.
I mean everybody says that it's drugs.

708
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:43,881
I don't know if it was drugs.
I don't think the husband doesn't want 

709
00:35:43,881 --> 00:35:43,920
to have an autopsy.
Kinda strange.

710
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,470
Really strange.
You know,

711
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:52,600
obviously they were going to do one 
anyways because it's kind of like wide 

712
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:52,600
sheet.

713
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Hi.
Yeah.

714
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,380
Unless you killed her.
I mean why isn't she?

715
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,970
Why doesn't that guy wanted an autopsy.
If it was a murder case,

716
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,070
then of course he would want an autopsy.
Right.

717
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:00,030
You'd be like,
how do you dive natural?

718
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,050
The only time where you die of natural 
causes when you're 32 years old is if 

719
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,950
you have like a serious health condition
or if you take something that kills you,

720
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:08,000
which is pretty natural.

721
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,260
Right.
I've read that,

722
00:36:09,261 --> 00:36:14,261
that a lot of her close friends stopped 
hanging out with her when she got 

723
00:36:14,261 --> 00:36:15,960
married to that guy because of him.
So there's something with this guy.

724
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,680
I've had some friends that have had some
serious drug problems in the past.

725
00:36:19,681 --> 00:36:24,681
I had a friend that died from drugs.
My best friend when I lived in New York 

726
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:25,620
and he used to do heroin when he used to
do crack,

727
00:36:25,621 --> 00:36:30,621
but mostly heroin and he had like 
manageable problems with coke and stuff 

728
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:35,331
like that.
Until he got on heroin and heroin just 

729
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:35,850
fucking sealed his fate.
That shit,

730
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,570
that shit just gets in your blood.
It becomes a part of you.

731
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,470
I mean,
I've seen people,

732
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:45,471
Jones and fur coat.
I've seen people Jones for a lot of 

733
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:45,471
shit,
but there's something really weird about

734
00:36:45,471 --> 00:36:47,590
watching people Jones for heroin 
immediately.

735
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,600
It's like they need water like during 
the desert and they need water and when 

736
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,411
people get involved in this,
and apparently that's what a lot of the 

737
00:36:57,411 --> 00:36:57,411
Hollywood kids are doing.
A lot of them are doing fucking heroin,

738
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,320
you know,
I don't,

739
00:36:58,321 --> 00:37:00,780
I don't know what it's all about,
but it's pretty spooky,

740
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:01,080
man.

741
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,760
Real alcoholics are pretty tricky to 
like when you wake up and you're 90,

742
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,710
the first thing you drink isn't beer.
Yeah.

743
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:14,790
I've,
I've met a lot of alcoholics.

744
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,940
I know a lot of alcoholics.
I know a lot of functioning alcoholics 

745
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:19,940
and I know a lot of people that are 
just,

746
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,850
you know,
just flat out drunks,

747
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,170
especially comics,
you know,

748
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:30,171
I've done a lot of comics that have had 
real alcohol problems because they get 

749
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:30,630
free booze and they're out in clubs 
every night and you know,

750
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:33,600
alcohol gives you liquid courage and if 
you're performing every night,

751
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,150
you might be drinking every night or 
you're drinking every night.

752
00:37:36,151 --> 00:37:38,190
You're gonna have a fucking problem.
Eventually.

753
00:37:38,191 --> 00:37:39,270
That shit's going to grab you.

754
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:44,870
Conspiracy theories are only theories 
until proven fact.

755
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,040
Yeah,
all the.

756
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:51,090
There are real conspiracies.
Most conspiracy theories are stupid 

757
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:51,980
because people want to find the mystery 
shit.

758
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,470
They want to find big foot.
You know when.

759
00:37:54,471 --> 00:37:59,471
Meanwhile there's a bunch of real live 
animals that are way more interesting 

760
00:37:59,471 --> 00:37:59,710
than bigfoot.
If big foot,

761
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:04,720
if we found big foot,
big foot would be in a fucking cage 

762
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,170
right next to the monkeys at the zoo.
If we found them,

763
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,830
if we really caught them,
they be like,

764
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,990
look,
there's a big ape.

765
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,550
You know,
we've got the short eight.

766
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,560
There's a big,
there's a big 10 foot tall ape.

767
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,920
Nobody would give a shit,
but like killer whales,

768
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,160
killer whales didn't exist and there was
some animal that people talked about in 

769
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,230
legend that was as smart as people lived
in the ocean,

770
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,950
but breathed air and had to come up for 
air and doesn't eat.

771
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:30,620
Human being saves human beings,
but kills everything else,

772
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:35,621
including great white sharks.
A superintelligent being it's gigantic 

773
00:38:35,621 --> 00:38:37,840
and murderous and runs the ocean.
People would say,

774
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,220
fuck that.
That's crazy.

775
00:38:39,221 --> 00:38:40,360
That's not,
that's not real.

776
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:42,130
That can't be real,
but it is real.

777
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,010
We just know it's real and because of 
the fact that we know it's real,

778
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,740
it's not as interesting to people.
People love mysteries.

779
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:51,190
We love discovering new shit.
Like the loch ness monster,

780
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,680
loch ness monster doesn't do shit.
It doesn't kill anybody.

781
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:58,681
It doesn't do anything every now and it 
pokes his head out of the water numbers 

782
00:38:58,681 --> 00:38:58,681
like,
Whoa,

783
00:38:58,681 --> 00:38:58,800
I saw it and everybody gets crazy.
You know?

784
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:03,810
Meanwhile,
there's fucking crocodiles that are 

785
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:03,810
real.
They're alive.

786
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,500
They're gigantic to like fucking 30 feet
long.

787
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,500
They can hold their breath underwater 
for like hours at a time.

788
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,420
You don't have to eat for a year.

789
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,060
I mean,
crocodiles are fucking crazy.

790
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,880
They're literally dinosaurs that are 
still alive today.

791
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:21,030
They will be exactly the same way as 
they are now hundreds of millions of 

792
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,030
years ago.
Nobody gives a fuck.

793
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,450
Everybody's looking for the loch ness 
monster.

794
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,900
You know,
there's something that people really,

795
00:39:25,901 --> 00:39:28,360
really get into when it comes to 
conspiracies,

796
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,160
you know,
and I've been guilty of it myself,

797
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:35,161
you know,
like I used to really be into Ufos and 

798
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:38,550
all kinds of stuff like that until I 
kind of realized like what I'm into is 

799
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,610
the unknown.
What I'm into is like somehow or another

800
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:43,600
is if there's something that's unknown 
and I figured it out and I find it and I

801
00:39:43,601 --> 00:39:48,601
know it's proven and true.
Then somehow or another you gained 

802
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:51,361
something from that.
I guess you do to a certain extent if 

803
00:39:51,361 --> 00:39:51,730
you can really prove it,
but mostly what it is,

804
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:55,610
this weird desire that human beings have
for things to be to,

805
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,560
to prove things.

806
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,930
So it's a very weird thing.
Conspiracy theories,

807
00:39:58,931 --> 00:40:03,931
like everybody's always looking like for
all sorts of conspiracies that aren't 

808
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,650
real.
I know this also from working where I've

809
00:40:05,651 --> 00:40:09,550
had people like working with the UFC,
like people are always talking about the

810
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:14,551
UFC wants this,
and Joe Rogan said that because of the 

811
00:40:14,551 --> 00:40:15,280
UFC told them saying the UFC never tells
me to say shit.

812
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,460
They don't.
They literally never tell me what to 

813
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:20,980
say.
My John's the craziest job ever.

814
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,660
I'm literally the guy who speaks for 
this multi hundred million dollar sports

815
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:30,661
company and nobody tells me what to do.
I show up and they tell me what the 

816
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:32,650
fights are and I just do it.
I try to be professional as possible.

817
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,640
I try not to swear.
Occasionally I'll slip up with that,

818
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:41,641
but I'm trying not to swear,
but all I'm trying to do is do 

819
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:41,641
commentary on the fights.

820
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:45,000
The only thing they've ever told me what
to do is when they were trying to by 

821
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,151
pride and pride,
fuck them over and there's this big 

822
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:48,151
thing going on back and forth.
They said,

823
00:40:48,151 --> 00:40:50,260
don't please don't mention pride by 
name.

824
00:40:50,261 --> 00:40:55,261
You can mention all the fighters,
but don't mention pride by name because 

825
00:40:55,261 --> 00:40:55,360
they didn't want to give advertisement 
to that organization,

826
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:58,570
which totally is totally legitimate.
Totally makes sense to me,

827
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:01,060
you know,
but they don't tell me like,

828
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:03,310
height this guy up.
Talk about that guy.

829
00:41:03,311 --> 00:41:08,311
Don't,
don't mention this guy's name and make 

830
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:08,311
sure you tell everybody that this guy,
this is the guy we want to win.

831
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:10,060
There's none of that.
There's no zero.

832
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:12,790
So I know that's a conspiracy that 
people think is real.

833
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,080
That's not real.
I know,

834
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:19,110
I know there's,
there's a lot of other ones that people 

835
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,110
think it's real,
but there's ones that are real.

836
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,220
You know,
I came to.

837
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,400
I are the ones that I've recently turned
on.

838
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,450
Yes.
The whole thing.

839
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:24,480
You talked about the.
Yeah,

840
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,820
the hair.
There's a lot of people that would look 

841
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,820
at those things in the sky and go,
what is that?

842
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:29,930
What are they doing?
Well,

843
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,950
well I talked to a pilot and I asked to 
pilot about it and he gave me a very 

844
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,801
simple explanation about how water going
through those jets,

845
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,370
those jet engines at a certain altitude 
with certain,

846
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:43,350
you know,
weather conditions,

847
00:41:43,351 --> 00:41:45,170
certain moisture,
humidity,

848
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,780
made any barometric pressure.
There's all sorts of factors,

849
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:52,350
but if it's the right factors is enough,
enough water in it,

850
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,200
it'll create clouds.
Like literally jets create cloud.

851
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,370
So all these people like,
man,

852
00:41:56,371 --> 00:42:01,371
they're making clouds.
Well that's what happens when jets fly 

853
00:42:01,371 --> 00:42:04,971
through the fucking air.
Like the idea that they won't be grain 

854
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:05,790
cities poisoning people.
So I don't,

855
00:42:05,791 --> 00:42:08,670
they live on the ground to.
They're spraying themselves,

856
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,580
their families and stuff.
They have shots.

857
00:42:11,581 --> 00:42:13,380
I've taken shots that they don't get 
that

858
00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:15,240
say that they don't experiment with 
weather,

859
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:18,110
but the majority of the lines you see in
the air,

860
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,690
definitely.
Yeah,

861
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,970
there's legitimate concerns about like 
that heart program,

862
00:42:21,971 --> 00:42:26,971
whether they're fucking doing things to 
the ionosphere and there's for sure 

863
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:30,901
they're experimenting with whether.
Because we know that China has 

864
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:30,901
successfully created rain,
you know,

865
00:42:30,901 --> 00:42:35,581
they,
they've done successful whether 

866
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:35,581
operations.
So there's,

867
00:42:35,581 --> 00:42:37,630
there are absolutely real conspiracies,
but there's a lot of goofy ones man.

868
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:41,410
And the problem is it's very difficult 
for people to,

869
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,400
once they have made a decision about 
something like jfk,

870
00:42:45,401 --> 00:42:50,401
you know,
Oswald acted alone and people just get 

871
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:50,401
that in their head,
Oswald acted alone.

872
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:54,360
It's very difficult for them to look at 
contrary evidence and take it into 

873
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,360
consideration.
Like they,

874
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,881
they,
it's almost like there's a competition 

875
00:42:58,881 --> 00:43:00,601
going on.
They want their side to be right and 

876
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:03,001
people have a real hard time in our 
friend that we were talking about with 

877
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:03,001
the country.
I was,

878
00:43:03,001 --> 00:43:03,880
didn't want to be like we're having an 
argument with him while saying,

879
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:08,881
listen man,
you don't know the research that I've 

880
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:08,881
done.
I'm like,

881
00:43:08,881 --> 00:43:11,980
you're watching youtube clips is that 
constitutes research these days,

882
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,620
you know?
And he was convinced the chem trails are

883
00:43:14,621 --> 00:43:17,050
real and I'm like,
they make no sense.

884
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:20,230
And the other thing that pilot had,
that was a good point,

885
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:21,610
it was like he's a pilot and he was 
like,

886
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:23,710
believe me man,
pilots would be talking about it.

887
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,140
It wouldn't be like something that's 
that easy.

888
00:43:26,141 --> 00:43:31,141
You can just hire a guy to fucking spray
every city in the world everyday of the 

889
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:32,650
week and they're gonna keep their mouths
shut,

890
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:33,460
class.

891
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,760
All these recorders that are like 
getting pissed off at like oil 

892
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,701
businesses for ripping off customers.
What if you were getting sprayed with 

893
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:44,460
poison when that reporter be crazy?
It researched reporter

894
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,860
this silly.
That's I think chem trails or a silly 

895
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,081
one.
Not not to say they haven't sprayed 

896
00:43:53,081 --> 00:43:55,121
people before.
Not to say that there haven't been some 

897
00:43:55,121 --> 00:43:59,110
experiments where they've sprayed a 
certain bacteria or certain colds,

898
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:04,290
you know,
over an area to see if they can get 

899
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:04,290
people sick.
What,

900
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:04,550
why not?
We know there's a thing called operation

901
00:44:04,551 --> 00:44:07,220
midnight climax.
Then in the 19 fifties,

902
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:12,310
the CIA ran fucking brothels.
They ran whorehouses in New York and San

903
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,480
Francisco and they ran these things and 
what they did was they ran a whore house

904
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:22,481
so they can do lsd experiments on people
and so they unknowingly gave these 

905
00:44:22,481 --> 00:44:26,030
John's acid so these poor guys would go 
in there just to try to give their,

906
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,350
you know,
their hard earned money.

907
00:44:27,351 --> 00:44:32,351
You know,
they probably didn't even have much 

908
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:34,910
pages,
whatever they had to get their dick 

909
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:34,910
sucked and they're getting dosed with 
acid,

910
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,750
freaking the fuck out,
probably already feeling super guilty.

911
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,960
Probably half of them were married and 
they just cheat and otherwise and they 

912
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,931
felt guilty about that and then they're 
dosed up with acid and deal with the 

913
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:46,920
reality of the situation mean we know 
the CIA did that.

914
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:49,770
This is information that was released to
the freedom of Information Act.

915
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,210
You look it up,
Google it.

916
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:56,211
It's pretty interesting.
It's called operation midnight climax 

917
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:59,360
and it's just one of many experiments 
that the CIA did unknowingly on American

918
00:44:59,941 --> 00:45:04,941
citizens taxpayers or they've done it 
forever and that's how they do business 

919
00:45:04,941 --> 00:45:08,250
and guaranteed that if they did this 
back in 1950,

920
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,250
they're doing something like it now.
It's not like they changed.

921
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,190
It's not like these.
All these conspiracies,

922
00:45:14,191 --> 00:45:19,191
all these things that the government's 
done like operation northwoods 

923
00:45:19,191 --> 00:45:22,820
operation.
Northwoods was the thing that they 

924
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:22,820
propose the 19 sixties,
1962,

925
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:27,171
and this was signed by the Joint Chiefs 
of staff and then vetoed by Kennedy and 

926
00:45:27,171 --> 00:45:31,520
what it was was they were trying to get 
people enthusiastic about a war against 

927
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:35,391
Cuba,
so they were planning on blowing up 

928
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:38,481
American ships like real ships that 
we're going to have mock mock plane 

929
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:42,000
crashes where they're going to blow up 
drones in the air and they were going to

930
00:45:42,001 --> 00:45:43,140
blame it on the Cubans.

931
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:48,250
They were going to say that all these 
people died and they were going to take 

932
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,051
the passengers and put them under false 
aliases and have pilots under false 

933
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:53,080
aliases and that pilot was going to give
may days and say,

934
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,600
you got shot down.
Look that up too.

935
00:45:54,601 --> 00:45:59,601
It's really interesting.
It's called operation northwoods and 

936
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:02,211
this was a real plan that they had 
drafted in the 19 sixties that the 

937
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,760
Department of defense drafted up and the
the joint chiefs of staff signed and 

938
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,700
Kennedy vetoed it.
And Kenny was like,

939
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:10,140
you guys are fucking crazy.
Like,

940
00:46:10,141 --> 00:46:15,141
what are you doing?
Like you're going to fake attacks in 

941
00:46:15,141 --> 00:46:15,270
order to get people to want to go to war
with Cuba,

942
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,790
and that's probably one of the reasons 
why they joke Kennedy,

943
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,230
you know,
one of those.

944
00:46:19,231 --> 00:46:21,930
But this is,
these are real conspiracies.

945
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:26,960
They're real.
We know that their things are conspired 

946
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:26,960
on.

947
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,590
The real problem with conspiracies is 
nobody wants to look stupid.

948
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:33,770
And when you say that you believe 
something like you believe in alien 

949
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:36,801
abduction,
or you believe the government killed 

950
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:36,801
Kennedy or you believe you know 
anything,

951
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:37,350
nobody.
We didn't land on the moon.

952
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,270
When you say you don't believe nutty 
things,

953
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,420
people just automatically label you a 
kook and instead of looking at it and 

954
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:46,290
going,
okay,

955
00:46:46,291 --> 00:46:51,291
what has the government done?
They really have dosed people with lsd 

956
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:55,431
without their knowledge.
They really set up whorehouses the 

957
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:55,431
government.
The CIA did this really.

958
00:46:55,431 --> 00:47:00,230
They really were faking attack.
They were planning a fake knee attacks 

959
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,560
on American civilians and blowing up 
American ships and blaming on the 

960
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:04,020
Cubans.
They really were going to attack,

961
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:08,490
wanted them obey attack soldiers.
They were going to fucking shoot mortars

962
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:13,610
into Guantanamo Bay.
They're going to kill American soldiers 

963
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,730
and blame it on the Cubans and get us to
attack them.

964
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:18,450
That's all real.
So you gotTa Keep Your Eyes Open.

965
00:47:18,451 --> 00:47:21,390
You got to keep your mind open.
And the problem with conspiracy theories

966
00:47:21,391 --> 00:47:24,710
is people choose one side or the other.
Either there's a conspiracy,

967
00:47:24,711 --> 00:47:27,000
theories are ridiculous and I'm not 
believing this.

968
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,620
Or they go,
well,

969
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,820
the conspiracies are real and it's 
usually not that black or white.

970
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,360
It usually takes a lot of looking at 
before you get to the real truth.

971
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,560
And the real truth is fucking sketchy.
I mean it's,

972
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:43,870
it's real hard to have information about
a lot of things in this world,

973
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,910
as much information as we have on the 
Internet.

974
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:48,250
There's still a lot of shit that you 
don't get.

975
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,340
Like Bill Maher,
twittered something today that I was 

976
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:53,340
like,
this guy doesn't even he,

977
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,300
he's incorrectly.
This is all been disproven.

978
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:00,630
He twitted something,
an anti Christian thing about a Mithra 

979
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:03,580
and you know,
I was like,

980
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:04,780
how funny it says,
Bill Maher's it.

981
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:09,780
Even doing this research,
like he's twittering something that 

982
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,860
everybody says about Mithra,
but it was disproven.

983
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,990
It gets his knees by the paper.
Here it is.

984
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:18,250
Mithra born 12 slash 25.
12 disciples died,

985
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,740
rose on May,
on the third day,

986
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:23,170
perform miracles.
No one has a lamb.

987
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,060
The way,
the truth,

988
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:28,840
the light 600 years before Jesus Christ.
I see what this point is.

989
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:30,620
His point is,
what he's trying to say is like,

990
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,990
Hey,
there was no,

991
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,590
you know,
there wasn't.

992
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,710
There was no Jesus Christ.
Now this,

993
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,860
this fable,
this myth has existed in many different 

994
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,541
forms,
but the Mithra thing is totally wrong 

995
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:47,080
because the myth or thing,
if you just google a Zeitgeists,

996
00:48:47,110 --> 00:48:52,110
the movie debunked.
This guy gets really into the mythology 

997
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,160
behind,
um,

998
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,510
you know,
in Zike guys,

999
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,660
they talk about how Jesus really is the,
basically the same story as all these 

1000
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,450
different stores before.

1001
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,910
And one of them was Mithra and you know,
so,

1002
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:09,390
so bill Maher,
quoting on his thing that Mithra was 

1003
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,480
born 12 slash 25,
he had 12 disciples.

1004
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,320
Well,
if you go to this other site that,

1005
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:15,340
that this guys seems like a really 
intelligent guy.

1006
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:20,341
I don't know if he's right,
but he's talking about anybody's 

1007
00:49:20,341 --> 00:49:21,250
researched at at least talking about the
missing alleged of Mithra are numerous,

1008
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,400
numerous in account and span several 
different cultures.

1009
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:26,860
I ran,
he says I ran into a brick wall of sorts

1010
00:49:26,861 --> 00:49:29,080
trying to track down any of this 
information.

1011
00:49:29,081 --> 00:49:32,980
I cannot find any evidence of his 
birthday being December 25th.

1012
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:38,010
The only dates that correspond to him or
his festival on October eighth and 

1013
00:49:38,010 --> 00:49:39,250
another on September twelfth through 
16th.

1014
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,580
A cattle pairing festival October 
twelfth through 16th.

1015
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:46,300
There is absolutely is important part.
There is absolutely no evidence anywhere

1016
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:49,600
that he had 12 disciples or 12 of 
anything for that matter.

1017
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,900
No,
Mithras scholars seem to know about it.

1018
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,770
He was not born to a virgin but rather 
out of solid rock.

1019
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,210
So I mean it's really,
really interesting.

1020
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,680
People like,
you know,

1021
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:07,730
there's not,
there's not enough research of 

1022
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,751
information.
People don't really look these things 

1023
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:09,751
up.
They,

1024
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:12,160
they quote a little bit of something 
they saw on the Internet and that's the 

1025
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,571
problem is there's no.
There's no way you can have access to 

1026
00:50:15,571 --> 00:50:19,291
everything.
There's no way you can know about 

1027
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:19,291
everything.
It's impossible,

1028
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:19,291
so there's gonna be a lot of shit that 
you're,

1029
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:24,150
you're talking about,
you form an opinion on when you're 

1030
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:26,041
really just talking out of your ass and 
that's where most people are when it 

1031
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,060
comes to conspiracy theories.
You know,

1032
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:31,190
everything with everything.
People talk out of their ass and because

1033
00:50:31,191 --> 00:50:35,450
people have a huge vested interest in 
being correct about things.

1034
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:37,700
You know,
people hate being foolish.

1035
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,130
They hate being the dumb one.
They hate being uninformed.

1036
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,490
You know,
people love correcting people they love 

1037
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,701
like your is u Apostrophe r,
e as in you are okay.

1038
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,530
You're a fucking awesome dude because 
you spotted that guy.

1039
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:52,700
Meanwhile I'll do that all the time.

1040
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:54,530
That's Kinda fun.
Being an asshole.

1041
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,780
That's kind of why I like the iphone,
how it.

1042
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,880
I've always fucks up my texting and 
stuff like that because then people are 

1043
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,560
starting to slowly less do it to me now 
because everyone's doing it.

1044
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,700
A conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura.
I haven't seen it.

1045
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,230
I haven't even.
Brian didn't like it.

1046
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,290
It was all right.
I don't know.

1047
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:16,490
Jesse Ventura is one of them.

1048
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:21,500
Student thinks just because he's a navy 
seal or he's a former navy seal that he 

1049
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,950
has inside information.
I'm a former neighbors,

1050
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,430
so you'll

1051
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:29,550
that opie and anthony.
Things just really got to me on both 

1052
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:29,550
sides.
Yeah.

1053
00:51:29,550 --> 00:51:30,970
You were upset at Jim Norton when you 
think of that was on both sides.

1054
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,820
That got me upset.
I thought they both handled.

1055
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,520
It's hard having a fucking intelligent 
conversation.

1056
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,090
Seven o'clock

1057
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:37,150
in the morning.
God Damn it.

1058
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:39,310
You know,
whenever I do those morning radio shows,

1059
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,980
like what am I even talking about?
Like most half out of it,

1060
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:45,920
mumbling and shit.
It's hard to wake the fuck up.

1061
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:50,950
It's like you have to drink coffee.
If you're going to do one of those 

1062
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
morning radio shows,
you really can't go and sober.

1063
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,700
You gotta have a little bit of that.
And a cup of coffee.

1064
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,750
Mothra or Rodin.
I was more of a Rodin Fan.

1065
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,920
I thought Mothra was kind of a faggy 
monster.

1066
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:05,070
Big stupid moth.
That's a dumb.

1067
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:10,210
Here's why I have a giant Roche people.
Ain't roaches.

1068
00:52:10,651 --> 00:52:15,651
Roaches are scary as fuck.
Why do you want to have a big stupid 

1069
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:15,651
mouth?
You don't.

1070
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:17,460
The Japanese had a bunch of crazy ass 
monsters.

1071
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,230
They still,
they still do those guys,

1072
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:20,230
you know,
they still draw.

1073
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:21,450
Remember that turtle?
God says,

1074
00:52:21,451 --> 00:52:23,780
I wrote and wrote down the turtle.
Turtle.

1075
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:25,750
We won't come on man.
Fucking Pearl.

1076
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,900
Do the Godzilla movies with the people 
in the classroom.

1077
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,180
I heard they still make them in Japan.
We have no confirmation.

1078
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:33,930
See,
this is another,

1079
00:52:33,931 --> 00:52:35,970
another thing that I would talk him out 
of our ass.

1080
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,090
We don't really have.
We've done no research.

1081
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,900
No

1082
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:43,220
sick.
So now what that means,

1083
00:52:43,221 --> 00:52:45,010
what does sick,
what happens to the iceman?

1084
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,880
Now you know,
I don't know man.

1085
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:50,330
I don't know if I.
If I type on this,

1086
00:52:50,331 --> 00:52:51,830
is this going to go to my twitter 
account?

1087
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:52,820
It's going to quit.
Okay,

1088
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:54,600
so how do I tell people to follow us on 
this thing?

1089
00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:00,140
You can add new.
You can add new chat boxes or even on 

1090
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,140
twitter.
Yeah,

1091
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:04,090
I'm going to post this on twitter.
You get people to follow up when you 

1092
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:04,490
post on here.
It automatically makes the link.

1093
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:05,330
It does,
yeah.

1094
00:53:05,331 --> 00:53:07,280
See?
See how everyone has this link.

1095
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,010
Your link underneath it.
Is that cool?

1096
00:53:10,011 --> 00:53:11,900
Okay,
what is this?

1097
00:53:11,901 --> 00:53:12,980
Hey,
Joe Rogan.net.

1098
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,290
What does that,
uh,

1099
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,060
that's just what you don't have to quit.
Hey,

1100
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:18,380
Joe Rogan.net.
Okay.

1101
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:25,010
You can erase all that.
That's for other people.

1102
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:30,170
So they don't get nervous when you put 
sick and like commas are referring.

1103
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,680
Does that mean kind of or like 
approximate later?

1104
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:42,720
Excuse me.
When people write sic sic.

1105
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:44,910
Oh,
spelling and correct.

1106
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,520
Oh,
it's when someone uses poor grammar or 

1107
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,460
spelling.
All this time I've had it mixed.

1108
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:56,960
How high am I right now?
Once 10 for probably before the end of 

1109
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,140
the.
Not Very High

1110
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,730
Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo.

1111
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,530
There's 230.
You motherfuckers in here right now.

1112
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,950
We're rolling strong bitches.
Two hundred 30.

1113
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,810
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to all of you.

1114
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:20,040
Right.
What else might have a friend of Jeet 

1115
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:20,040
Kune Doe.
I'm a fan of Bruce Lee.

1116
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:22,270
I'm a fan of his idea,
his idea to add all the martin.

1117
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:27,271
I mean he was really the original mixed 
martial artists when I started out as a 

1118
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:27,271
kid.
I was,

1119
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:31,531
I did karate and then I started doing 
taekwondo and each one of those 

1120
00:54:31,531 --> 00:54:32,230
disciplines,
karate and taekwondo,

1121
00:54:32,231 --> 00:54:36,130
they wanted you to think that their 
style was the best style,

1122
00:54:36,131 --> 00:54:41,131
the end all be all style karate.
They didn't want you training with 

1123
00:54:41,131 --> 00:54:41,470
taekwondo people,
taekwondo people.

1124
00:54:41,471 --> 00:54:43,480
They didn't want you to train training 
with karate people,

1125
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,590
you know,
judo people didn't want you to training 

1126
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:50,701
with Kung food people.
It was like everybody was like really 

1127
00:54:50,701 --> 00:54:51,850
attached to their style.
So really Bruce Lee and she couldn't go.

1128
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:55,660
That's the original mixed martial art.
That's the original guy to look at,

1129
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,900
you know,
all the different systems and take 

1130
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:00,900
what's useful about from each one.
I mean,

1131
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,770
Bruce Lee was a.
He was a genius when it came to martial 

1132
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:04,770
arts.
Way,

1133
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:04,770
way,
way,

1134
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:04,770
way ahead of his time.

1135
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,120
I like this because the questions are 
slower.

1136
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,820
Twitters and yeah,
this is pretty cool.

1137
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,820
This is the first time I've done this.
Like I said,

1138
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:17,170
I'm,
I'm always threatening to do this,

1139
00:55:17,171 --> 00:55:21,500
but we're doing it now.
You mother fuckers sub diverter.

1140
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:23,510
Talk more about hunter s Thompson.

1141
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,710
I love that feeling.
Where the truth just hits,

1142
00:55:27,711 --> 00:55:30,380
you know,
honors Thompson was a fucking genius.

1143
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:35,840
He was a,
he was one of the very few dudes that 

1144
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,460
really captured the angst of the sixties
and the seventies,

1145
00:55:37,461 --> 00:55:39,580
that Nixon era and you know,
the,

1146
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:42,020
the,
he was a part of the acid culture of the

1147
00:55:42,021 --> 00:55:43,910
sixties.
He was a part of the culture,

1148
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:48,911
like the San Francisco Haight Ashbury 
movement where it's like everybody was 

1149
00:55:48,911 --> 00:55:52,751
doing acid.
All these people were like and good 

1150
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:55,211
acid.
So all these people were like really 

1151
00:55:55,211 --> 00:55:56,560
coming together and they really like 
releasing their egos and their cell,

1152
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:01,100
their identity and kind of like losing 
themselves in a movement.

1153
00:56:01,101 --> 00:56:03,380
And then this,
this hippie movement of the sixties,

1154
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,460
which seems like really stupid.
Now we look at it,

1155
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:10,490
it's like God,
look at these idiots with her long hand 

1156
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:10,610
or stupid clothes.
But what they were doing was they were,

1157
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,790
they were radically departing from the 
previous culture.

1158
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:18,940
I mean the difference between the 
fifties and the sixties is fucking 

1159
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:22,031
gigantic.
The difference between like buddy holly 

1160
00:56:22,031 --> 00:56:24,010
and Jimi Hendrix is like,
you know,

1161
00:56:24,011 --> 00:56:26,170
I mean that's,
that's another world.

1162
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,200
I mean that's not like a 10 year 
evolution.

1163
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,690
That's an evolution that would have 
taken hundreds or not.

1164
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:35,000
Maybe not even gotten there at all.
It's almost like you.

1165
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:40,080
They needed the drugs.
They needed acid and mushrooms and pot 

1166
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,460
pot and they needed all that shit and 
heroin to to launch themselves like from

1167
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:49,741
one,
one frequency to the next one and the 

1168
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:52,570
sixties were a totally different 
frequency when it came to music,

1169
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:57,630
when it came to culture and that set the
stage for what happened in the seventies

1170
00:56:58,871 --> 00:57:03,160
and the eighties and we were the really 
crappy music that came from the eighties

1171
00:57:03,161 --> 00:57:05,650
and some of them in the seventies,
but definitely the eighties.

1172
00:57:05,651 --> 00:57:08,320
Like what that is is like this 
consciousness,

1173
00:57:08,321 --> 00:57:13,321
this incredible music where these,
these people were like really like 

1174
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:16,210
tuning into the art of it in the sixties
more sixties.

1175
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,700
Music is like classic fucking Shit.
You know that you,

1176
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,520
you here today and you go,
God damn,

1177
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,230
that's a good song.
It's like they,

1178
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,160
they really figured out how to tap into 
the real shit.

1179
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:29,710
You know,
the real energy that makes.

1180
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,920
That makes art interesting.
That makes art resonate and I think they

1181
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:38,910
did it with drugs and I think that the,
the,

1182
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:43,930
the decline in the seventies and 
certainly in the eighties was because 

1183
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:44,980
there was like a void left where the,
this,

1184
00:57:44,981 --> 00:57:48,040
this,
this tuning in,

1185
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:50,950
this connection to the real pure source 
was gone.

1186
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,470
You know,
it's like whatever they had hit whatever

1187
00:57:53,530 --> 00:57:56,410
frequency they had nailed in the 
sixties,

1188
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,500
the echoes of it had died down by the 
time the eighties head,

1189
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:04,950
you know,
I think hunter s Thompson had a fucking 

1190
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,370
brilliant story that he wrote,
a brilliant piece that he wrote,

1191
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,360
um,
the wave,

1192
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:12,900
the talking about how the sixties,
it's like,

1193
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:18,210
was like,
like a wave and that when the sixties 

1194
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,420
ended you could see where the wave broke
back,

1195
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:22,570
like where they thought that people 
could be like,

1196
00:58:22,571 --> 00:58:25,330
where they saw the true potential of,
of humanity,

1197
00:58:25,331 --> 00:58:27,970
of the United States,
of the human race in general.

1198
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:30,700
And saw just roll back and go back to 
where it was.

1199
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,400
And that's what it was between the 
sixties and seventies,

1200
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:38,420
you know.
And he nailed that shit better than 

1201
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,381
anybody.
Hunter s Thompson's words today still 

1202
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:43,111
when you look at like especially what 
was going on with the Bush 

1203
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:44,911
administration and it was just like the 
clearest evidence ever have of massive 

1204
00:58:45,101 --> 00:58:47,140
amounts of corruption in government 
where you know,

1205
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,140
it's been,
they,

1206
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,590
they got us into a war that made no 
fucking sense.

1207
00:58:50,591 --> 00:58:55,591
I mean,
and it was obvious like across the 

1208
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:55,591
board,
the Internet was up,

1209
00:58:55,591 --> 00:58:56,830
the information was being,
you know,

1210
00:58:56,831 --> 00:59:01,831
very easily transferred back and forth 
and yet it still managed to go through 

1211
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:04,150
and do the way he felt about the Nixon 
administration.

1212
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,460
I mean,
you literally could substitute Nixon for

1213
00:59:06,461 --> 00:59:11,461
Bush and then insert most of the shit 
that he said and to the early two 

1214
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:15,310
thousands raw sound as it sounds shitty.

1215
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:22,740
What do,
what do you think about doing a radio 

1216
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:22,740
show of my own?
I would love to do radio show.

1217
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,741
The only problem is I don't think 
anybody wants to pay me to do a radio 

1218
00:59:26,741 --> 00:59:29,651
show.
I might have to do a radio show like 

1219
00:59:29,651 --> 00:59:31,421
this because right now,
I mean Adam Corolla has a sweet setup 

1220
00:59:31,421 --> 00:59:36,030
where he does a podcast and he gets a 
lot of people to listen to it and that 

1221
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:40,511
might be the way to go because satellite
radio is struggling financially and you 

1222
00:59:40,511 --> 00:59:41,870
know,
some people make money from it,

1223
00:59:41,871 --> 00:59:42,740
like,
you know,

1224
00:59:42,741 --> 00:59:47,741
obviously Howard stern makes a lot of 
money from it and I think opie and 

1225
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:48,440
anthony make good money from it,
but they don't want to pay anybody else.

1226
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:50,660
They're not making money so they don't 
have the money to give out.

1227
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,080
So I think,
um,

1228
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,450
if I'm going to do any sort of a turn 
that up was at work.

1229
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:59,030
Is that any better?
Is that lauder anybody?

1230
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,690
If I'm going to do any sort of a,
um,

1231
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,060
a podcast or something like that,
it's going to be this,

1232
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:10,390
it's gonna be like this.
And I saw soldier boy do it.

1233
01:00:10,391 --> 01:00:10,940
So I'll say it again.

1234
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,770
Yeah.
Maybe that video through a department.

1235
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,680
The guy in the background with this gold
necklace.

1236
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:15,110
Yeah.

1237
01:00:16,130 --> 01:00:20,150
Yeah.
Soldier boy is fascinating to me.

1238
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,660
If you don't know soldier boy,
he's a rapper,

1239
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,560
a very young fellow who's wildly 
successful,

1240
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:32,770
made millions and millions of dollars 
and he's tattooed his entire body and 

1241
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:36,341
liked the course of a few months,
like all the way up his neck and his 

1242
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,210
face is tattooed and his sleeves and his
chest and everything.

1243
01:00:38,211 --> 01:00:40,490
I mean he just tattooed the fuck out of 
himself,

1244
01:00:40,491 --> 01:00:42,880
but like writing and shit,
like really bad artwork.

1245
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:44,300
Really,
really interesting.

1246
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:45,620
Just I guess he likes it

1247
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:50,930
crazy.
How many times a day do you think he 

1248
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:50,930
makes it rain?

1249
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:50,930
Makes it rain,
does it all day.

1250
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,870
Smalltime multine,
multimillionaire,

1251
01:00:52,871 --> 01:00:55,840
and he's only like 19 years old and when
they became rich and famous,

1252
01:00:55,841 --> 01:01:00,841
he was only like 17.
He's an interesting little study right 

1253
01:01:00,841 --> 01:01:02,290
there.
When Kimbo sits all day,

1254
01:01:02,291 --> 01:01:03,610
what does it mean?
All debt.

1255
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:05,410
That's what it means.
Making it rain all day.

1256
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,390
No,
it doesn't mean making.

1257
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:12,030
When Kimbo says,
all Kimbo says all dates means he's 

1258
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:13,960
fucking dudes up all day.
This is how we do it,

1259
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:18,990
and he holds up the dukes.
I got some pretty fucking sweet Kimbo 

1260
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:19,300
slice t shirts that I just got from my 
buddies.

1261
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:22,390
A tap out.
They're upstairs though.

1262
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:25,240
Show me your drunk.
My drawings.

1263
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,830
I'm going to actually put those online 
too.

1264
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,980
It's pretty bash.
Have put those.

1265
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:33,830
He just found his old drawings from when
he was younger and they're amazing.

1266
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:35,670
It's some shit that I,
uh,

1267
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,670
I made when I was a little kid when I 
was,

1268
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:38,560
well,
not a little kid.

1269
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:41,920
I was like 18.
See twit pic.

1270
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,410
Do,
do,

1271
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:45,280
do.
Oh,

1272
01:01:45,281 --> 01:01:47,040
I can choose a picture from here.
Yeah.

1273
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,520
Yeah.
Put it up.

1274
01:01:48,670 --> 01:01:51,700
I'll put it up in my twitter word.

1275
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:05,350
I was pretty blown away.
He's really good at drawing and he has 

1276
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,760
these two drawings.
He did are just amazing.

1277
01:02:07,761 --> 01:02:09,680
I mean,
I thought I was good back in the day,

1278
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:12,260
but he blows me out of the water back in
the day.

1279
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,260
Whereas I never used a technical 
candidates part.

1280
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:15,840
He's checking the pens are awesome.
Yeah,

1281
01:02:15,841 --> 01:02:16,860
that's pretty.
You would

1282
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,030
love it.
When I,

1283
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:18,900
I,
um,

1284
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,340
first started

1285
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:25,050
out when I was a kid,
I was really into comic books.

1286
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:28,800
I wanted to be a comic book artist.
Big Bad wolf three.

1287
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,500
Oh,
cool.

1288
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:35,501
You already scanned it.
Was scanned it uploaded.

1289
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:37,670
Tweet float.
It's uploading.

1290
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,730
Um,
when I was a fuck.

1291
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:45,200
Everything up my gay service.
It's so slow.

1292
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,320
Look how slow this is because there's a 
big ass picture.

1293
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:53,321
It's like three megs.
Two megs.

1294
01:02:54,220 --> 01:02:56,450
A second charter.
Yeah.

1295
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,480
I gotta I gotta switch.
You tweet stuff to you or use the chat.

1296
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,400
Oh,
tweet stuff to me,

1297
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:07,480
man.
Don't many people to chats that shit.

1298
01:03:07,481 --> 01:03:09,580
Ain't that shit?
Ain't gonna work.

1299
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:17,700
Tracy Lee just sent me a text message.
You guys know Tracy Lee from Dana was in

1300
01:03:19,631 --> 01:03:20,740
the chat.
You missed it.

1301
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:22,780
Oh,
Dana was in the house.

1302
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:24,760
Dana.
Dana.

1303
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,480
She thinks it's a real.
No.

1304
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,600
Why do you think it's a real?
Dana?

1305
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:29,550
How dare you?

1306
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,580
The Internet.
Can you.

1307
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:39,700
Can I ask?
Cheeseburger got no fucking deal to be 

1308
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:39,700
in my goddamn chat.
Quit say you're a bomber.

1309
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,290
This,
this time.

1310
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:42,180
All right,
tracy.

1311
01:03:42,181 --> 01:03:43,320
I got two right here.
And Tracy,

1312
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:44,740
I'm in the shower

1313
01:03:44,810 --> 01:03:49,810
to the chat too.
And that wasn't Dana.

1314
01:03:50,751 --> 01:03:55,440
You done?
Is Tracy Lee.

1315
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:58,500
She's the combat lifestyle photographer.
Yeah,

1316
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,680
this is the best font of all time.
The iphone,

1317
01:04:09,681 --> 01:04:12,410
ladies and gentlemen,
you really can't fuck with it.

1318
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,640
We've tried every other phone.
I'm A.

1319
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:17,810
I'm a technical fucking Geek.
I'm a nerd.

1320
01:04:17,811 --> 01:04:22,811
I love phones,
but there's no phone that can fuck with 

1321
01:04:22,811 --> 01:04:26,771
the iphone.
There's no network that could fuck with 

1322
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:28,010
verizon now and that's the real God damn
problem.

1323
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,710
So I don't use the iphone as my main 
phone.

1324
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:34,880
I mostly use the iphone these days as 
like an internet device.

1325
01:04:34,881 --> 01:04:37,640
I use it as like a little tin,
mini laptop and shit,

1326
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:41,780
but from my phone I use one of these 
blackberry storm twos,

1327
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:45,470
which as a phone is not nearly as good.
It's kind of funky.

1328
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:46,760
The typing on.
It's not bad.

1329
01:04:46,761 --> 01:04:48,710
The storm too is definitely better than 
the storm one,

1330
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:54,450
but man,
fucking the network is 100 times better.

1331
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,330
The,
the,

1332
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:02,510
the verizon network.
When I had 18 t like when I would drive 

1333
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,970
to Jujitsu at night,
I drive the same way and it got to go to

1334
01:05:04,971 --> 01:05:09,971
Hollywood and my shit would drop out 
three times on the way to Hollywood.

1335
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,700
Three fucking times in 25,
30 miles,

1336
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:16,490
whatever it is,
three times the shit would drop out with

1337
01:05:16,491 --> 01:05:18,010
verizon.
Straight through

1338
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,030
never drops out.
It doesn't.

1339
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:22,180
They're about anywhere and I get better 
reception inside buildings.

1340
01:05:22,181 --> 01:05:27,181
It's just like better.
It's just better reception period and 

1341
01:05:27,181 --> 01:05:28,930
it's not like a little bit better.
It's like several times better,

1342
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,140
you know,
it's like the amount of dropbox that I 

1343
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,271
get with verizon are so tiny in 
comparison to the ata and t eight t and 

1344
01:05:36,510 --> 01:05:39,250
t just,
they just got fucked by that iphone.

1345
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:41,980
That iphone is overloaded,
their network overload,

1346
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:42,700
that shit out of it

1347
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:47,940
and the things that they just dropped 
something that 18 has been pushing 

1348
01:05:48,341 --> 01:05:53,341
lately,
but I and I agree is not being able to 

1349
01:05:53,341 --> 01:05:54,880
use your data network while you're on 
the phone.

1350
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,320
Verizon,
you can't.

1351
01:05:56,590 --> 01:06:01,590
When you're on the phone,
you can't check your email and get new 

1352
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:02,200
email or go on twitter and get new 
twitter's while you're on the phone.

1353
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,500
You can't use your data and your phone 
together at the same time.

1354
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:06,430
Did you know that?

1355
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:07,710
No,
I didn't know that.

1356
01:06:07,770 --> 01:06:12,770
That's huge.
That's bigger than a dropped call once 

1357
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:13,930
in a while I think.
Yeah,

1358
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:18,950
that is bigger.
You'd have no idea what I'm talking 

1359
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,950
about.

1360
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:22,790
No data and not being able to use data.
And if you're on the phone you can't 

1361
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:26,991
get,
you can't get a emails while you're on 

1362
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:26,991
the phone.
Good.

1363
01:06:26,991 --> 01:06:28,570
And Verizon can't fix that with your 
current network.

1364
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:30,970
Yeah,
that's great.

1365
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:37,470
That's why they had that thing where 
they show that you can get on the phone 

1366
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:38,500
and go into the apps.
The but that sucks.

1367
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:43,530
It does suck,
but I'll take being able to use the 

1368
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,050
phone over that.
I like using the phone.

1369
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:48,130
I like what I'm driving.
I get my business done,

1370
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,360
you know what I'm saying?
A dry.

1371
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:54,380
I have to get shit done and I have to 
talk to people and sometimes I have 

1372
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,901
conference calls.
Sometimes they'll do interviews while 

1373
01:06:57,901 --> 01:06:57,901
I'm driving my car,
you know,

1374
01:06:57,901 --> 01:06:58,360
you know like you will call me up and 
you'll say something like,

1375
01:06:58,361 --> 01:06:59,350
what's that?
How do you do this?

1376
01:06:59,351 --> 01:07:01,360
Or something like come on,
they'd be gone.

1377
01:07:01,470 --> 01:07:02,850
I can't go.
You can't do any.

1378
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:04,900
That's what it is.
Weak.

1379
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:07,630
But I'll take it,
I'll take that and have a signal.

1380
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:11,050
I'll take not being able to do both at 
the same time and have a strong signal.

1381
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:11,890
Right.
I'll take that.

1382
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:15,100
And that's because the cdma can't handle
two streams at the same time.

1383
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:15,710
It is,
right?

1384
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,250
Well,
verizon actually uses older technology.

1385
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:21,130
The TDX is a newer technology,
which is verizon.

1386
01:07:21,131 --> 01:07:24,190
It's kind of an avenger in trouble.
They have a slower network.

1387
01:07:24,191 --> 01:07:24,790
It's,
it's,

1388
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,430
uh,
can't handle those two things at once.

1389
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,870
Yeah.
But it still works better.

1390
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,210
We'll take it right.
Forgy a isn't out yet here.

1391
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,950
Somebody wrote.
Soldier boy is a fucking Douche.

1392
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:42,250
Listen,
do you think you would be any better if 

1393
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:42,910
you were 19 years old and he's worth 
like millions?

1394
01:07:42,911 --> 01:07:42,980
Yeah.

1395
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:44,670
Yes.
It's huge on the Internet though.

1396
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,740
He's showing you some money and send a 
19 year old kid that's worth millions of

1397
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:50,510
dollars.
Like literally.

1398
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:50,970
Yeah,
you can't.

1399
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:56,090
We would both be.
I would be retarded was when I was 19 

1400
01:07:56,090 --> 01:07:58,260
because the Jonas brothers are 
hypnotized by Walt Disney.

1401
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:02,150
Yes.
They drank the Disney koolaid.

1402
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,210
Yep.
Didn't even get pussy.

1403
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:09,630
What's the point in being rich and 
famous if you're not even getting laid 

1404
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:09,630
right?
It's ridiculous.

1405
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,770
We got rock stars.
Don't fuck they.

1406
01:08:11,830 --> 01:08:14,740
Fuck they fucked.
Now when they get married,

1407
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:17,570
Ms Dot Tracy leads in here.
She says the sound is fine.

1408
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:22,780
Everybody that's in that chat.
Get the fuck out of there because I'm 

1409
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:22,780
not paying attention.
That shit.

1410
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,170
Tweet it.
Tweet it.

1411
01:08:24,171 --> 01:08:26,150
You dirty bitches.
How come the tweet isn't updating?

1412
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:31,960
You're getting too many tweets per hour 
and really probably you probably have to

1413
01:08:31,961 --> 01:08:36,961
go because this thing's open.
You see to two programs are taking your 

1414
01:08:36,961 --> 01:08:37,200
apis.

1415
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:38,070
Okay.
All right.

1416
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:39,810
I'm going to shut shut.
Shut this one off.

1417
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,450
I would shut that one.
All right.

1418
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:43,380
I'm shutting tweet deck off by tweet 
deck.

1419
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:46,040
All right,
let's.

1420
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,250
I'm just trying to optimize here because
like I told you guys,

1421
01:08:48,251 --> 01:08:53,251
I've got a terrible Internet connection,
but I'm not getting my goddamn 

1422
01:08:53,251 --> 01:08:56,030
twitter's.
So let me update this bitch right here.

1423
01:08:57,540 --> 01:08:58,650
I've done.
Oh,

1424
01:08:58,660 --> 01:08:59,230
here we go.

1425
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,610
All right.
You know what?

1426
01:09:01,611 --> 01:09:03,740
What?
What'd you get your updated internet?

1427
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,560
We'll get you into an hd camera too.

1428
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:10,830
The pope got laid out by a crazy woman.
I didn't think it was a pope.

1429
01:09:10,831 --> 01:09:12,780
I think it was some,
some,

1430
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,730
some crazy chick try to attack the pope,
but some other dude who is in government

1431
01:09:17,731 --> 01:09:19,620
got hit in the face with a statue in 
Italy.

1432
01:09:19,950 --> 01:09:24,950
What does this.
They put an ad in front of us and they 

1433
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:25,620
put advertising what?
The newest thing they put some.

1434
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:28,050
Some are,
what are we advertising?

1435
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,140
This is because I was talking about 
soulja boy.

1436
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:32,430
Is that really a soldier?
Boy?

1437
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:33,840
No.
Soulja boy's home leaves.

1438
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:38,860
They're just chilling.
Shit out my money.

1439
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,810
Look at all my new sneakers.
Even the bottom of my sneakers is clean.

1440
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:44,370
That's bullshit.
It's bullshit.

1441
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,810
They're advertising.
Please.

1442
01:09:45,811 --> 01:09:48,810
Everybody Click close on that 
advertisement.

1443
01:09:48,811 --> 01:09:52,410
Fucking it.
Don't God damn heat and the close button

1444
01:09:52,411 --> 01:09:54,420
is.
It's raised the upper lower,

1445
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,270
upper left corner.
If you see that.

1446
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,090
That's right.

1447
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,500
Close that close.
That shit.

1448
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,800
Fucking advertisement.
That's one bad thing about use string 

1449
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:10,690
because I don't remember Justin TV 
having that do that.

1450
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:16,800
Justin TV.
It's about to get in trouble with a 

1451
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,570
Justin TV is getting in trouble or 
something.

1452
01:10:17,571 --> 01:10:20,420
They were mentioning that UFC or they're
in trouble.

1453
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:26,010
Well there it's obvious if you have a 
thousand like Justin TV supposedly 

1454
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:29,240
working with the people that are owning 
the copyright material,

1455
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:34,490
why wouldn't it be easy if you noticed 
that one of your chat rooms went from 

1456
01:10:34,490 --> 01:10:35,820
zero to 2002nd,
you know,

1457
01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:37,870
delete,
delete.

1458
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,340
Well,
like I said,

1459
01:10:42,341 --> 01:10:47,341
you can't fly the Internet.
People gonna figure out a way to put 

1460
01:10:47,341 --> 01:10:47,870
things online.
They're just going to.

1461
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:52,980
I thought that was the real problem was 
that people were taking a copy of it 

1462
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:56,490
after the event and then uploading it,
but that's not what the problem is.

1463
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:56,860
Problem,
promise,

1464
01:10:56,861 --> 01:10:58,210
streaming,
promise.

1465
01:10:58,211 --> 01:10:59,920
If you have any streaming,
you're going to have power.

1466
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:00,900
Does dreaming.
Yeah.

1467
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:04,300
We can't stop that.
I don't think you can stop it.

1468
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,940
Maybe you can.
Maybe you can stop it by cutting back on

1469
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:08,980
those sites would probably stop and 
substantially,

1470
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:12,300
but that's going to kill those sites.
You know it's going to kill you.

1471
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,040
Streams.
Gonna Kill Justin TV is going

1472
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,410
to kill the sites like this where you 
can just stream anything.

1473
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,430
You mother fuckers.
Wow.

1474
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,540
Three hundred 64 people.
This is like a comedy club,

1475
01:11:21,541 --> 01:11:23,220
Ladies and gentlemen.
It's nuts.

1476
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,770
All right,
let's take some questions here and dirty

1477
01:11:25,771 --> 01:11:28,710
bitches.
Wow.

1478
01:11:28,711 --> 01:11:33,711
There's a lot of God damn what have this
marijuana and it increasing brain cells,

1479
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,920
you know,
I don't know if it increases brain 

1480
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:39,920
cells.
There's been some research that suggests

1481
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:42,120
that and suggested it also slows down 
the progression of Alzheimer's.

1482
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,130
I don't know.
It does.

1483
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:46,950
It does a lot of good for you though.
That's what people need to understand.

1484
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:48,630
There's a lot of drugs that are terrible
for you.

1485
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:53,660
Marijuana is not one of them.
Marijuana does a lot of good things for 

1486
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:53,820
you.
It calms you down.

1487
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,910
It relaxes you.
It makes you take things.

1488
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,710
I just got a text from Bruce.
Buffer.

1489
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:59,550
Powerful.

1490
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:01,920
It makes you,
um,

1491
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:05,970
makes you consider other options.
It makes you consider the possibilities.

1492
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,130
It makes you think about yourself more.
It makes you think about,

1493
01:12:08,131 --> 01:12:13,131
you know,
whether or not you're being a Douche 

1494
01:12:13,131 --> 01:12:14,331
bag.
You know whether or not you're behaving 

1495
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:14,331
the right way.
Marijuana is good for you.

1496
01:12:14,331 --> 01:12:16,410
Does it give you extra brain cells?
I Dunno,

1497
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:21,710
I was gonna write the copy of the cover 
of my shiny happy jihad.

1498
01:12:23,490 --> 01:12:27,360
The first name for that CD was going to 
be weed made me smarter.

1499
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:32,510
I was going to call it that,
but I decided that was kinda like that 

1500
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:33,780
sentence doesn't sound smart.
Made Smarter.

1501
01:12:33,810 --> 01:12:38,810
Yeah.
It's not supposed to be sent to be 

1502
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:38,810
funny.
Silly supposed to.

1503
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:41,220
I think that I'm going to do a book 
though called weed made me smarter.

1504
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:45,450
I think that's kind of the name of it,
but you know,

1505
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,400
because that's like a good name for a 
book,

1506
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:50,070
you know,
that's like a grabbed you.

1507
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:55,850
That's something that would grab you.
You'd want to check it out here about 

1508
01:12:56,611 --> 01:12:57,790
Rick Simpson oil.
Yeah.

1509
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,200
It's like how it cures cancer or 
assumption.

1510
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,360
She not Dan Quann play video games with 
my favorite of all time.

1511
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,560
Quite A.
I used to have a huge problem.

1512
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:11,400
That's why I got a t one line.
It's called to my house.

1513
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,590
I should play quake everyday,
eight hours a day.

1514
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:18,650
Did you watch that video I posted where 
they go into the airport and just start 

1515
01:13:18,650 --> 01:13:20,420
spraying people and intimate what game 
is called duty raw,

1516
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:22,520
wherever the new one and then one.
Yeah.

1517
01:13:22,710 --> 01:13:24,540
I've never played call of duty.
I don't want to get addicted,

1518
01:13:24,541 --> 01:13:25,650
man.
I got problems.

1519
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,890
I get addicted to everything.
I get addicted to pool.

1520
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,760
I used to play pool eight hours a day 
more.

1521
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:34,740
Even sometimes I used to get addicted to
video games.

1522
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:35,820
That's why I'm scared of golf.

1523
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:40,820
I've never played golf.
I'm terrified of that shit because I 

1524
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:40,820
know dudes who play golf.
They can't,

1525
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,810
they sit around all day and practice 
fake swinging.

1526
01:13:43,050 --> 01:13:45,200
It's they get addicted,
you know,

1527
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:50,240
and I get very badly addicted to games.
So I try to leave my addictions to 

1528
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,680
things that benefit me now.
Like so like pool.

1529
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,830
I like pool don't play as much as I used
to.

1530
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,280
I just fuck around with it.
But like Jujitsu and stand up comedy,

1531
01:13:59,281 --> 01:14:04,281
I tried to be more.
I try to be addicted to things that are 

1532
01:14:04,281 --> 01:14:08,001
um,
beneficial to me instead of things that 

1533
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:08,001
are just going to like eat up all my 
day,

1534
01:14:08,001 --> 01:14:11,680
which is what pool used to be for me.
And what video games used to be for me.

1535
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:13,360
I used to have real fucking problems.

1536
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,160
Thank you.
I'm glad you enjoyed the drawing.

1537
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,290
I twittered a drawing that I made when I
was,

1538
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:22,960
I think I was like 18 or 19 years old.

1539
01:14:24,980 --> 01:14:27,150
Are you still want to be a comic book 
artists?

1540
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,310
Red Dragons.
Indeed.

1541
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:34,430
Red Dragons.
Have you seen any pre prefer the new 

1542
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:34,430
karate kid movie?
No,

1543
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:34,860
I have not.
It's black karate kid.

1544
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:39,920
They're redoing the karate kid,
but the kid is black and I think it's 

1545
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:39,920
will Smith's kid.
Kid.

1546
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:40,980
That's awesome.
Were easy.

1547
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:42,930
Karate is making a comeback,
man.

1548
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:43,810
Leo Machida.
Yeah,

1549
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,830
but don't fuck with the karate kid 
rounds.

1550
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,480
Marijuana would bring California out of 
bankruptcy.

1551
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:50,580
Do you really think so?
Don't fuck with the karate kid.

1552
01:14:50,581 --> 01:14:52,520
You say that like the karate kid was 
like some awesome movie.

1553
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:53,970
Dude.
It's a childhood memory.

1554
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,220
They fucked up Gig.
Oh,

1555
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:59,480
they fucked up transformers.
Childhood was she joe,

1556
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,010
and it was the worst movie ever known,
but in a main.

1557
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,080
Before that movie.
What was it before?

1558
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:06,390
It was a cartoon series.
Cartoons,

1559
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:07,980
right.

1560
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,850
They didn't really fuck it up though.
They just made a bad move.

1561
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:12,900
It was horrible.
It was awful.

1562
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,920
How fast can Bj Penn,
Bj.

1563
01:15:17,921 --> 01:15:19,040
Okay,
man.

1564
01:15:19,041 --> 01:15:22,310
I don't know if there's anybody at 1:55.
They can fuck a Bj Penn now.

1565
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:27,610
Now the BJ's taken everything like super
serious and training like a dedicated 

1566
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,330
athlete.
He's a destroyer at 1:55.

1567
01:15:29,331 --> 01:15:31,550
Just nobody that's even close to him.
I mean,

1568
01:15:31,551 --> 01:15:33,620
no one's even in his.
His frequency.

1569
01:15:33,650 --> 01:15:35,360
He's.
He's in the matrix right now.

1570
01:15:35,720 --> 01:15:40,720
You know,
there's certain dudes they get to a 

1571
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:40,720
certain point with confidence,
with experience,

1572
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:44,210
with skill technique and then you add 
discipline and conditioning to that.

1573
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:49,480
They get to this crazy place that very 
few people can reach this crazy high air

1574
01:15:50,270 --> 01:15:53,360
and that's where Bj Penn's at right now.
Right Anderson Silva too.

1575
01:15:53,390 --> 01:15:58,390
He's another one.
He's just in this air that nobody can 

1576
01:15:58,390 --> 01:16:01,301
fuck with that.
That's what's good about the ultimate 

1577
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:01,301
fighter that because it's kind of 
bringing new people in,

1578
01:16:01,301 --> 01:16:03,410
unknown people you know,
but you know,

1579
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:08,440
there's such a gigantic gap between 
these guys that have fought in these 

1580
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,701
smaller organizations and the guys at 
the top of the food chain and you see 

1581
01:16:11,701 --> 01:16:13,490
like with fate or million inco,
like it takes so many years for a guy to

1582
01:16:13,491 --> 01:16:17,270
become like the fader of today and 
Anderson Silva is a perfect example that

1583
01:16:17,271 --> 01:16:19,400
I like Anderson Silva when he's fighting
in pride.

1584
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:23,670
I mean he got submitted by Rio,
shown in a to Z.

1585
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:26,040
got them in a mounted triangle.
There's dudes.

1586
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,640
Dudes were beating him.
Dudes are submitting him,

1587
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:29,610
you know,
I mean he,

1588
01:16:29,611 --> 01:16:30,680
he knocked out,
Carlos didn't,

1589
01:16:30,681 --> 01:16:33,080
but he just didn't look like the 
Anderson Silva of today.

1590
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:36,350
And he had to have those fights.
You had to have those losses.

1591
01:16:36,351 --> 01:16:38,780
You had to get better.
He had to rise,

1592
01:16:38,781 --> 01:16:40,760
you know,
he had to really get his shit together,

1593
01:16:40,761 --> 01:16:45,761
really focused on his Jujitsu and,
and really become black belts on the 

1594
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:49,691
ground.
So he had this full package so that he 

1595
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:51,851
was totally confident in throwing 
strikes because you didn't worry at all 

1596
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:51,851
about being on the ground and that's the
Anderson Silva,

1597
01:16:51,851 --> 01:16:53,810
the Ab now just like fully complete 
fighter.

1598
01:16:53,811 --> 01:16:58,811
But we had to see him evolve.
It took a long time for him to become 

1599
01:16:58,811 --> 01:16:58,811
the guy that he is today.

1600
01:16:59,060 --> 01:16:59,880
And that's what,
you know,

1601
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:03,290
it takes a long time to make a full,
complete mixed martial artist.

1602
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:06,980
And these guys today,
I mean the competition is staggering.

1603
01:17:06,981 --> 01:17:11,981
There's so many fighters now.
There's mean there's so many different 

1604
01:17:11,981 --> 01:17:15,191
organizations,
so many fighters and so many guys are 

1605
01:17:15,191 --> 01:17:15,650
good.
It's so hard to,

1606
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:17,660
to advance and to,
you know,

1607
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:22,661
to,
to make it to the very top of the food 

1608
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:22,661
chain in today's mixed martial arts 
world.

1609
01:17:22,661 --> 01:17:24,530
I mean it's so much fucking 
competitions.

1610
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:29,770
It's amazing.
I mean when I first started doing the 

1611
01:17:29,770 --> 01:17:30,350
UFC,
I first started working for them in 1997

1612
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:35,590
and it was tiny.
We did the first show and dose in 

1613
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:36,590
Alabama.
There was nobody there.

1614
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:38,550
I mean there was like a thousand people 
or something like that.

1615
01:17:38,551 --> 01:17:43,551
And it's because the tickets were really
cheap and because people came to see a 

1616
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,601
fucking freak show,
there was nobody there that knew when 

1617
01:17:46,601 --> 01:17:47,030
someone was passing the guard and nobody
passed the guard back then either.

1618
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,860
You know,
nobody knew what the fuck was going on.

1619
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:50,360
Nobody knew,
you know,

1620
01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:53,330
the that leg kicks were really bad for 
you.

1621
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:58,331
The fuck your legs up.
People would see a guy kicking somebody 

1622
01:17:58,331 --> 01:17:58,331
in the legs like,
what was he doing that you know,

1623
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:00,980
like back then you were allowed to punch
people in the balls.

1624
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:02,300
You know,
you're able to pull hair.

1625
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:05,060
You had to pull him close.
Was crazy.

1626
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:08,450
The early days to what it is now.
So really fucking amazing.

1627
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,380
Your face is amazing.
Your fucking face.

1628
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:16,230
Amazing.
Don Fry retired from MMA.

1629
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:19,290
Don Frye is a fucking real man that 
belongs in a movie.

1630
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:23,130
They should make a movie.
And a dom fry is fucking mustache alone.

1631
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:23,850
Is epic.

1632
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,230
John Fry's a real man.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1633
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,860
a real goddamn man.
Three hundred and 72 viewers.

1634
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:33,950
Okay,
this shit's fun.

1635
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:39,600
They're saying that sounds good,
but I think this sounds better when 

1636
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:40,810
we've got close needs to point towards 
your face.

1637
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,510
Oh really?
Have towards your fucking face.

1638
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:47,610
Face is pointing towards your face were 
to float.com.

1639
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:53,020
Is that a website where to float.com.
If you google where to float,

1640
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:58,110
I know you can.
If you want to know about flotation 

1641
01:18:58,110 --> 01:19:00,451
tanks,
these are what this guy's asking about 

1642
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:00,451
is a thing called a sensory deprivation 
tank.

1643
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:01,290
And what that is,
is um,

1644
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:03,070
there's a,
a tank filled with water.

1645
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:05,590
If you haven't heard about this before,
you could google it and there's,

1646
01:19:05,591 --> 01:19:09,280
there's videos of the we made that you 
could find online and Brian made,

1647
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:11,770
if you see any of my videos for my 
website and you go,

1648
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:16,771
wow,
those are really cool and creative 

1649
01:19:16,771 --> 01:19:16,771
describing.

1650
01:19:16,771 --> 01:19:17,860
So that's Brian Russell.
He's a fucking video genius.

1651
01:19:17,861 --> 01:19:20,020
Bitches recognized.
And uh,

1652
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,780
we made a really cool,
one of the explains the isolation tank,

1653
01:19:22,781 --> 01:19:27,781
but what it is is a tank of water that 
has a 800 pounds of salt in it and the 

1654
01:19:27,781 --> 01:19:29,620
water is heated to the same temperature 
of your skin.

1655
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:33,940
And the salt makes you very buoyant,
so you lie in the water and you float.

1656
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,730
And the um,
the fact that the water is heated to the

1657
01:19:36,731 --> 01:19:38,950
same temperature as your skin,
you don't feel it.

1658
01:19:39,130 --> 01:19:44,130
So you're floating in this water.
You don't really feel the water anymore 

1659
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:44,130
because the water in the air and 
everything,

1660
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:49,021
it all feels like one thing.
It feels like you're weightless and 

1661
01:19:49,021 --> 01:19:51,541
you're flying through space.
And when he closed the door in this 

1662
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:51,541
thing,
you're in total darkness.

1663
01:19:51,541 --> 01:19:52,600
You're in total silence.
Your ears are underwater,

1664
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:53,440
you don't hear anything.

1665
01:19:53,770 --> 01:19:56,980
And in the absence of any sensory input,
you don't hear anything.

1666
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,680
You don't feel anything.
You don't see anything.

1667
01:19:59,681 --> 01:20:03,340
In the absence of all that,
your mind has no distractions.

1668
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:08,341
And your brain becomes supercharged and 
you start having vivid hallucinations 

1669
01:20:08,341 --> 01:20:12,651
and you start like,
it's really like a psychedelic 

1670
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:12,651
experience.
You really start,

1671
01:20:12,651 --> 01:20:13,320
you,
you start like really like,

1672
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,440
uh,
like researching your,

1673
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:20,130
your thoughts and getting to the heart 
of who you are separate from culture,

1674
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:23,880
separate from language,
separate from your experiences.

1675
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:27,630
You get down to who you are.
And then when you get to that,

1676
01:20:27,750 --> 01:20:32,750
once you get past that as one of the 
hallucination start because you kind of 

1677
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:34,810
ceased to exist.
As you define yourself as who you are by

1678
01:20:34,811 --> 01:20:36,570
your job,
the car you drive,

1679
01:20:36,571 --> 01:20:39,090
the house you live in,
the family you have the friends,

1680
01:20:39,091 --> 01:20:44,091
you keep,
you define yourself by all these 

1681
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:44,091
different things.

1682
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:44,091
But when,
when you're in that tank,

1683
01:20:44,091 --> 01:20:45,300
all those things are gone.
There's no,

1684
01:20:45,301 --> 01:20:48,000
there's no outside world that is just 
the mind,

1685
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:53,001
it's the mind untethered from the body.
And when you're in that state you,

1686
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:58,310
you kinda transverse.
You kind of travel between this 

1687
01:20:58,471 --> 01:21:01,380
consciousness and this reality to 
another one.

1688
01:21:01,381 --> 01:21:01,760
You,
you,

1689
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:05,880
you travel outside of this world and you
traveled to this,

1690
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:08,820
the world of the deep inner thoughts,
you know,

1691
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:12,600
the deep inner connection between 
whatever the fuck this life is.

1692
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:17,900
You know,
the connection between your 

1693
01:21:17,900 --> 01:21:17,910
consciousness and the universe and it 
gets pretty fucking crazy.

1694
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:20,220
I have one of those bitches in my 
basement.

1695
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,090
I do it all the time.

1696
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,800
Is it like a really great power nap?
No,

1697
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:29,160
it's not like a really great power nap.
It's like a really great mushroom trip,

1698
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,160
but the best thing about it is you can 
end it at any second.

1699
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:37,190
Anytime you want to end it.
You just open up the door and you're 

1700
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:37,500
stone cold sober so you can be in this 
deep trance where you're,

1701
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,400
you know,
your.

1702
01:21:38,490 --> 01:21:43,490
I've had really vivid,
vivid hallucinations in there where I 

1703
01:21:43,490 --> 01:21:48,051
felt like I was like I had traveled down
to the very atomic structure of human 

1704
01:21:49,081 --> 01:21:53,730
beings and gotten through the lowest 
point and at that lowest point,

1705
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,670
as you get lower and lower and deeper 
and deeper,

1706
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:01,880
it became like another universe.
And the idea in my head was that all of 

1707
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:04,440
this life that we see,
you know,

1708
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:07,610
subatomic particles to Adams to all 
these things like this,

1709
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:12,090
this progression of things getting 
bigger and bigger and bigger to humans,

1710
01:22:12,091 --> 01:22:14,530
to countries to continence the planets,
to planets,

1711
01:22:14,531 --> 01:22:17,190
to galaxies,
galaxies to you know,

1712
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:20,880
to universities and that all this idea 
that things just keep getting bigger and

1713
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:21,600
bigger and bigger.

1714
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,570
Well that it's,
it works infinitely in both directions.

1715
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:29,960
And it was like I was taken on a trip 
through the whole experience from 

1716
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:34,850
Subatomic to atomic to planets to flying
through space to face space,

1717
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:38,400
being subatomic to the,
you know,

1718
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:43,401
this new Adam that exists and it's a 
part of new organisms that exist that 

1719
01:22:43,681 --> 01:22:48,681
are part of a new ecosystem that exists 
that's a part of a new planet that's a 

1720
01:22:48,681 --> 01:22:49,320
part of a new galaxy that's part of a 
new universe.

1721
01:22:49,321 --> 01:22:52,480
And it goes on and on and on.
And I went through this whole thing like

1722
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,050
over and over again,
like multiple times.

1723
01:22:55,051 --> 01:22:58,110
And it was really fucking crazy.
It was a very,

1724
01:22:58,111 --> 01:23:00,950
very vivid and very realistic and very,
you know,

1725
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,410
very life changing.
The whole thing is like doing it a lot.

1726
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:09,440
You got to do the isolation tank a lot 
and you've got to learn to relax and 

1727
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:13,051
you've got to learn to give in to the 
experience because so many times when 

1728
01:23:13,051 --> 01:23:15,811
you're in there,
you're thinking about things and you're 

1729
01:23:15,811 --> 01:23:17,731
worrying about things and you think 
about your bills and your bullshit and 

1730
01:23:17,731 --> 01:23:18,060
you know,
I'm gonna Lose Weight and Oh,

1731
01:23:18,070 --> 01:23:18,790
I've got to do this.

1732
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:23,940
And all those thoughts distract you.
It's like the state of mind that you can

1733
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:30,001
achieve in this isolation tank.
It's very similar to the state of mind 

1734
01:23:30,001 --> 01:23:30,160
that you can achieve from,
you know,

1735
01:23:30,190 --> 01:23:32,190
when monks go through,
you know,

1736
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:35,350
decades and decades of intense 
meditation,

1737
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:37,990
like they achieve the same type of state
of mind,

1738
01:23:37,991 --> 01:23:40,090
but you're achieving it like no 
discipline.

1739
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:44,110
So it's hard to manage sometimes,
but if you can learn to manage it and if

1740
01:23:44,111 --> 01:23:49,111
you learn to go in with the correct 
thought process and to approach it the 

1741
01:23:49,111 --> 01:23:51,970
right way and maybe meditate before you 
go in and calm yourself and put yourself

1742
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:56,971
in a good state of mind and know how to 
navigate the waters of these 

1743
01:23:56,971 --> 01:23:58,060
experiences,
then you can get to the crazy part,

1744
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:59,680
the crazy part.
It's hard to get to it,

1745
01:23:59,681 --> 01:24:04,681
but it's there.
We should ask them what sounds better 

1746
01:24:04,681 --> 01:24:04,960
and switch between the three.
Okay.

1747
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,960
Okay.
What sounds better when there's three 

1748
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:10,960
settings to this microphone.
This is what sounds better.

1749
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,020
This is setting one.
Ready?

1750
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:13,970
Hi,
my name is Joe Rogan.

1751
01:24:14,330 --> 01:24:15,330
Okay.
Two.

1752
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,550
This is setting to this setting to.
Hi,

1753
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,500
my name is Joe Rogan.
Is this better?

1754
01:24:21,530 --> 01:24:24,470
Does this sound better to you or setting
three.

1755
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:27,980
Hi,
my name is Joe Rogan.

1756
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:29,420
Does this sound better to you?

1757
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,140
Which,
which one?

1758
01:24:31,141 --> 01:24:32,280
Sounds better.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1759
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:35,590
please tweet.
Now you're going

1760
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:41,600
no the fuck out of people.
People that have like get your phone 

1761
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:45,771
messages.
Like sometimes I'll tweet like I'll get 

1762
01:24:45,771 --> 01:24:48,531
baked and I watched the Steven Seagal 
shell and I'll tweet way too much and I 

1763
01:24:48,531 --> 01:24:50,230
get a lot of angry tweets from moon.
It's annoying.

1764
01:24:50,231 --> 01:24:54,180
It gets annoying if you only fall like 
below 100 people or something.

1765
01:24:54,210 --> 01:24:59,210
That's why I started falling more and 
make it more just like a chat room on 

1766
01:24:59,210 --> 01:24:59,400
your.
Yeah.

1767
01:24:59,401 --> 01:25:01,560
I have thousands of people following 
them.

1768
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:06,770
I just hate when people replied,
like every single person that's ever 

1769
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:06,840
written him ever wrote them ever.
You know,

1770
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,990
replies.
That's a problem

1771
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:17,350
to twitter right now.
Do,

1772
01:25:17,380 --> 01:25:17,860
do,
do,

1773
01:25:18,100 --> 01:25:18,560
do

1774
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,180
one sounds best three.
You Dick.

1775
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,070
Three D.
I'm a dick.

1776
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:28,730
One in three are close to Sachs.
One and three.

1777
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:33,780
Close.
Let's do three is louder but one seems 

1778
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:36,230
better quality.
So it seems one three than to.

1779
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,910
Okay.
It seems like one is the one,

1780
01:25:38,030 --> 01:25:39,020
one,
one,

1781
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:40,430
one,
three,

1782
01:25:40,431 --> 01:25:42,530
someone yelled out.
One,

1783
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:43,250
one,
one,

1784
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:46,790
one.
Most people are saying it's time between

1785
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:48,800
one three.
So let's go with one.

1786
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,130
Alright.
Alright.

1787
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,000
We're gonna at one.
Fuck you and your threes.

1788
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:54,720
Whoa.
Strong.

1789
01:25:57,260 --> 01:26:02,260
All right.
How's your Melrose Shogun?

1790
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,400
Oh,
a.

1791
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:07,730
I'm going to be at the Melrose Improv.
If anybody's in La,

1792
01:26:08,690 --> 01:26:13,130
the Improv on Melrose,
I'm going to be there on New Year's Eve.

1793
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:18,670
Two shows.
I think it's eight and 10 for sure 

1794
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:23,350
because I heard one show and then just 
on hip hop website they have like an 

1795
01:26:23,350 --> 01:26:24,930
early time that you can go to eat dinner
ruin.

1796
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:27,760
It looks like a second show,
but it's not really two shows.

1797
01:26:27,940 --> 01:26:30,770
Oh,
that's a problem because that's quick.

1798
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:35,990
Yeah.
In Vegas the following day at the House 

1799
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:35,990
of Blues?
Yes.

1800
01:26:35,990 --> 01:26:37,760
The following day,
January,

1801
01:26:37,761 --> 01:26:40,430
First House of Blues,
Vegas,

1802
01:26:41,170 --> 01:26:46,080
just pitches and then after that,
Washington DC,

1803
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,170
January I think seventh or something 
like that.

1804
01:26:48,530 --> 01:26:50,190
We know because that's what's up.

1805
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:55,610
Oh no upcoming shows.
This fucking thing sucks.

1806
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,300
The improv's website is dog shit.

1807
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:01,990
Joe Rogan dinner.
Ten PM 10.

1808
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,750
Oh,
one Joe Rogan show.

1809
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:05,210
Huh?

1810
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:10,580
Say you did it.
It's just saying that it says there's 

1811
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:10,580
only one show.
Yeah,

1812
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:13,150
I think they're always only one shot.
I only have it on your website is 1:10

1813
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:13,380
PM.
Ooh,

1814
01:27:13,381 --> 01:27:14,860
this is going to be a disaster.
Yeah.

1815
01:27:14,910 --> 01:27:16,270
Oh,
it's going to be crazy.

1816
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:18,760
If you want to go to the Improv,
you got to go.

1817
01:27:18,761 --> 01:27:23,761
Now it looks like it's already sold out.
There's this whole trying to buy a 

1818
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:23,761
ticket right now.
Oh wait,

1819
01:27:23,761 --> 01:27:24,160
we tried to buy a ticket right there.

1820
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:28,590
You're still taking.
Okay.

1821
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:31,520
You can still buy tickets,
but get them quick because that pitch is

1822
01:27:31,521 --> 01:27:33,870
going to sell out.
Maybe we'll add an 8:00

1823
01:27:33,871 --> 01:27:38,070
show.
I don't want anybody to get shut out and

1824
01:27:38,071 --> 01:27:39,780
sometimes 8:00
is the move.

1825
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:42,240
You go there,
have a show,

1826
01:27:42,330 --> 01:27:44,030
have a good time.
Get your freak on.

1827
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:44,740
Have A,
you know,

1828
01:27:44,741 --> 01:27:49,741
have a couple of laps and then go hide 
when it comes to midnight so you don't 

1829
01:27:49,741 --> 01:27:50,490
get bullets drop.
But on your fucking head.

1830
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:55,520
Mullah Douche bags out here,
like the fire guns in the air and get 

1831
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:55,520
crazy.

1832
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:59,970
I can handle it.
And they drank and drive and it's very 

1833
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:03,251
dangerous.
I got some hilarious video of last new 

1834
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:04,160
years there of these old ladies dancing 
and stuff.

1835
01:28:04,190 --> 01:28:05,320
Oh yeah,
that's right.

1836
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,320
I wish we had that right now.
We'll get streaming,

1837
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:08,480
right?
Yeah.

1838
01:28:09,010 --> 01:28:14,010
I'm,
I'm going to upgrade this internet this 

1839
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:16,540
week as Internet I got here because then
once I'll bring my laptop and then I'll 

1840
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,670
start to be able to just send you a 
video.

1841
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,310
We're going to set it up like a Goddamn 
fucking TV studio in here.

1842
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:23,570
Bitch is 358.

1843
01:28:24,130 --> 01:28:25,660
I'm losing viewers.
Must be boring.

1844
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:33,970
Answer some questions here.
Adelaide show in Vegas.

1845
01:28:34,210 --> 01:28:35,740
Um,
I don't think so.

1846
01:28:35,741 --> 01:28:37,660
Man.
Late chosen vegas or a nightmare.

1847
01:28:37,870 --> 01:28:39,280
How's it gloves?
Pretty big already.

1848
01:28:39,340 --> 01:28:44,340
Yeah.
The House of blues is a good size 

1849
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,901
anyway.
I want the one thing that I won't do 

1850
01:28:45,901 --> 01:28:48,361
anymore as I used to do the house of 
Blues and I had most of the people were 

1851
01:28:48,361 --> 01:28:49,540
seated but then there was all standing 
room in the back.

1852
01:28:49,810 --> 01:28:54,810
But the problem is that standing room by
the bar just becomes a bar and people 

1853
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:55,660
just started talking and it becomes a 
fucking nightmare.

1854
01:28:55,810 --> 01:29:00,810
So no more shows.
I'm not doing any more shows ever 

1855
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:01,500
anywhere where people have to stand up 
while they're watching show.

1856
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:02,100
And

1857
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:07,010
the reason being is because I went to 
see Doug Stan hope when he was in la and

1858
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:12,050
we went to see him and we're standing in
the back of the room because he did a 

1859
01:29:12,050 --> 01:29:14,991
standing room only show and it was like 
after like an hour like your fucking 

1860
01:29:14,991 --> 01:29:17,000
back hurts.
He starts bothering you and you're,

1861
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:20,220
it's not comfortable to stand up and 
watch a show.

1862
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:23,160
I always figured because I'm on stage 
standing for an hour,

1863
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:24,420
like it's no big deal,
you know,

1864
01:29:24,421 --> 01:29:29,421
you can stand for an hour and a half and
talk on stage and it doesn't feel it's 

1865
01:29:29,421 --> 01:29:31,650
not a problem,
but standing still watching someone is a

1866
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:32,380
big difference between

1867
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:33,610
worse.
It's terrible.

1868
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,620
Do you even remember like the last half 
of that show?

1869
01:29:35,621 --> 01:29:37,540
Because I was focused on my feet the 
whole time.

1870
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:42,070
It's a terrible feeling.
And what's weird is I talked to somebody

1871
01:29:42,071 --> 01:29:47,071
in Texas,
they walked out of this show because 

1872
01:29:47,071 --> 01:29:49,121
they couldn't because it was awkward 
standing room only and Doug's show and 

1873
01:29:49,121 --> 01:29:49,520
they just walked out here like we 
couldn't take anymore.

1874
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:50,430
Yeah,
I hate it.

1875
01:29:50,460 --> 01:29:55,460
So I'm not doing it anymore.
And I'm having problems with this 

1876
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:56,640
because I had a show booked in March at 
the fillmore,

1877
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:01,940
the fillmore in New York City.
And they said that the whole balcony he 

1878
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:01,940
had to be standing.
I'm like,

1879
01:30:01,940 --> 01:30:04,230
fuck,
that man gave me less money.

1880
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:06,270
Let's see what we can.
And.

1881
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:07,260
But they were like,
you know,

1882
01:30:07,261 --> 01:30:09,120
we can make more money if people stand.
And I was like,

1883
01:30:09,121 --> 01:30:09,810
all right,
you're done.

1884
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:15,070
And so I canceled that Gig.
And then the same thing happened in 

1885
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:17,841
Houston.
I was supposed to do the house of Blues 

1886
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:17,841
and the same thing.
They were like,

1887
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:17,841
well,
you know,

1888
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:21,981
we can't,
we need to have people standing in the 

1889
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:22,080
back.
And I'd had it booked or I don't know.

1890
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:27,590
My agents are not communicating this to 
the people or they're not paying 

1891
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:30,711
attention.
It's going through too many people 

1892
01:30:30,711 --> 01:30:30,711
before it gets to the person that makes 
the decision,

1893
01:30:30,711 --> 01:30:34,461
but they didn't want.
They wanted to have people stand and I 

1894
01:30:34,461 --> 01:30:37,401
said fuck that.
So now I'm going to have to find a new 

1895
01:30:37,401 --> 01:30:39,861
gig in New York and new Gig in Houston 
and I'm probably going to wind up doing 

1896
01:30:39,861 --> 01:30:40,170
the Improv in Houston.
I don't know.

1897
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:44,910
Thinking about that and some maybe one 
of the clubs in New York City.

1898
01:30:45,890 --> 01:30:48,760
You go to Joe's twitter or a website 
that has this calendar on it.

1899
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,880
You just gained for people.
Those people like talking about 

1900
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:53,880
standing.
Yes.

1901
01:30:54,510 --> 01:30:55,900
Do you remember standing,
waiting,

1902
01:30:55,920 --> 01:31:00,920
like wave for a roller coaster.
Understanding like three hours for a 

1903
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:01,000
roller coaster.
Like last minute.

1904
01:31:01,750 --> 01:31:02,890
Yeah.
It's fucking terrible.

1905
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,060
Yeah.

1906
01:31:06,170 --> 01:31:07,850
Why don't like Tom Green?
Yeah.

1907
01:31:07,851 --> 01:31:12,851
Tom Green's got an awesome set up.
I went to Tom Green's house where I 

1908
01:31:12,851 --> 01:31:16,690
filmed a his talk show there and he's 
got a fucking crazy setup man,

1909
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:20,300
like giant servers and he's got wires 
big,

1910
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:25,330
you know,
wires all throughout his living room 

1911
01:31:25,330 --> 01:31:27,320
because like he's doing it like serious 
hardcore style and he's doing it or at 

1912
01:31:27,651 --> 01:31:28,400
least back to anyone.

1913
01:31:28,730 --> 01:31:30,270
He's still doing it,
isn't he or is he?

1914
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:33,390
Is he straight paper view now that you 
can't watch it for free at all now?

1915
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:35,400
I think.
I think

1916
01:31:36,050 --> 01:31:38,660
Tom Green live and see that.
Is that the case ladies and gentlemen?

1917
01:31:38,890 --> 01:31:40,730
If it is,
I think that's a fucking mistake.

1918
01:31:40,940 --> 01:31:43,050
I think it is too.
That's great.

1919
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,230
Maybe.
Maybe it's the archives.

1920
01:31:45,231 --> 01:31:47,270
You have to be a member to watch.
That makes sense.

1921
01:31:51,160 --> 01:31:53,140
Maybe we'll see.
We're going into the channel.

1922
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,900
He calls it the channel.
I don't know what that's all about.

1923
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:58,300
Ready to receive stream.
Oh.

1924
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:00,260
Oh,
he's doing comedy episode.

1925
01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:05,330
Isn't that crazy?

Welcome to questions about support side 
membership.

1930
01:32:16,671 --> 01:32:20,420
Full access to a collection of videos.
That's what it is behind the scenes.

1931
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,490
Can I cancel it anytime?
Yes.

1932
01:32:23,340 --> 01:32:25,550
Five slash $95 a month.
Not a bad price.

1933
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:30,760
Good price.
I wonder if he's making money during 

1934
01:32:30,760 --> 01:32:32,381
that four.
90 five would have been better than 

1935
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:32,381
before.
90 five.

1936
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:35,120
How about just five bucks?
Which would this fucking five shit for 

1937
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:36,320
95.
That's stupid man.

1938
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:39,850
That tries to be crazy.
$5.

1939
01:32:39,870 --> 01:32:42,020
Ninety nine.
Just tell me it's $6.

1940
01:32:42,021 --> 01:32:47,021
You fuck.
So do you open your presents on 

1941
01:32:47,021 --> 01:32:47,330
Christmas Eve tonight?
We're going to.

1942
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:52,580
Why do you do that?
Does that mean you grew up doing or can 

1943
01:32:52,580 --> 01:32:52,580
impulsive?
I don't know.

1944
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:54,200
What should I wait?
I'm grown up.

1945
01:32:54,290 --> 01:32:57,950
You do it at midnight.
An hour or something?

1946
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,640
I better get some good shit too.
That's what I'm saying

1947
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:08,770
is that my parents sent me money and 
then I took that money to buy them 

1948
01:33:09,141 --> 01:33:11,120
presents and actually spent more than 
that.

1949
01:33:11,121 --> 01:33:16,121
They sent me if I would have waited and 
sent them presents first and then they 

1950
01:33:16,121 --> 01:33:17,450
got me money.
I would have felt like I got something,

1951
01:33:17,451 --> 01:33:19,400
but I felt like I just bought them 
presence.

1952
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:21,320
It's all about timing,
timing.

1953
01:33:21,321 --> 01:33:26,321
You know,
if I sent you money to buy them things 

1954
01:33:26,321 --> 01:33:28,880
or your personal shopper,
but if I would have stepped in something

1955
01:33:28,881 --> 01:33:30,230
first and then got money,
I would've felt like,

1956
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,190
oh,
I've got some cash.

1957
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:36,310
Interesting.
Alright.

1958
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:38,430
Thanks for spending Christmas Eve with 
us.

1959
01:33:38,431 --> 01:33:39,880
You're welcome.
Molly.

1960
01:33:41,990 --> 01:33:45,680
I'm going to say people's names when I.
When I read your question.

1961
01:33:45,681 --> 01:33:47,990
So you feel like I'm talking to you 
because I am.

1962
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:53,140
Were you pissed when he found out there 
was no Santa or did you find out there 

1963
01:33:53,140 --> 01:33:56,470
was no Santa Claus?
I stumbled into my parents' rapping 

1964
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:56,470
shit.
Oh really?

1965
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:58,010
I was like,
and then we opened it the next day.

1966
01:33:58,011 --> 01:34:01,130
I like what the fuck,
like I hid and I saw them.

1967
01:34:01,131 --> 01:34:06,131
Right.
And then I just put two and two 

1968
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:06,131
together.
My friend has this video of her daughter

1969
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:07,850
last year and her daughters,
like I saw Santa Claus last night.

1970
01:34:07,851 --> 01:34:08,900
He had a beard

1971
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:12,380
and he had a big stomach and had the 
belt and the mom's like,

1972
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:13,670
Oh really?
Really?

1973
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,760
Can you imagine fucking lie?
I know as you're watching them load 

1974
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:18,890
after I would have to correct the kid.
I was like,

1975
01:34:18,891 --> 01:34:19,680
listen,
don't lie.

1976
01:34:19,710 --> 01:34:20,530
Don't lie.
Stopped.

1977
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,840
He would have said that you can't see 
sandy's invisible.

1978
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:25,370
Oh,
you can't lie to me.

1979
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:26,420
It makes sense.
She was like,

1980
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:28,760
for three.
She's a liar.

1981
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:33,500
Fucking video though.
I think it's very important to call kids

1982
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,510
on being I was a or when I was a little 
kid as well.

1983
01:34:35,511 --> 01:34:40,511
I'm saying this.
I had a very vivid imagination and not 

1984
01:34:40,511 --> 01:34:43,121
such a good life,
so it always make up stories and I wish 

1985
01:34:43,121 --> 01:34:46,461
someone had called me on my bullshit.
Then so when it taken so long for me to 

1986
01:34:46,461 --> 01:34:47,310
figure it out on my own,
the people knew I was right.

1987
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:48,950
I didn't figure it out.
There was like 10.

1988
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:52,580
Pinocchio would have worked out.
When you're a kid watching Nokia,

1989
01:34:52,581 --> 01:34:55,260
I don't want to know some big moves.
He's made a wood wooden.

1990
01:34:55,261 --> 01:34:56,550
People can't fucking talk,
right?

1991
01:34:56,551 --> 01:35:01,551
It's stupid.
Why did they make about a way upstate 

1992
01:35:01,551 --> 01:35:03,290
says,
I steal your jokes and I used them as my

1993
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:06,500
facebook messages.
I hope.

1994
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,870
I hope it gets you laid.
Does it get you laid?

1995
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,320
If it gets you laid,
I approve or give you thumbs up,

1996
01:35:12,321 --> 01:35:15,050
sir,
show us your breasts.

1997
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:20,080
How dare you de la Roche.
How dare you may have to keep up with 

1998
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:20,380
these twitters.
She fucking.

1999
01:35:21,160 --> 01:35:24,080
It's twitter's.
Let's go to those coming in now.

2000
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:26,850
Well,
UFC ever had a 1:35

2001
01:35:26,851 --> 01:35:28,950
division.
I think the UFC in the WEC.

2002
01:35:28,980 --> 01:35:33,060
The idea is eventually that is going to 
be one thing when I don't know,

2003
01:35:33,330 --> 01:35:38,330
but I think it should be because I think
guys like Jose Aldo and Uriah Faber and 

2004
01:35:38,330 --> 01:35:41,130
Mike Brown and Miguel Torres,
those guys are fucking awesome.

2005
01:35:41,131 --> 01:35:43,410
They deserve all the attention that the 
UFC gets.

2006
01:35:43,411 --> 01:35:45,210
They deserve people to,
you know,

2007
01:35:45,211 --> 01:35:49,370
to be clamoring for super fights and to 
see big paper view bouts in,

2008
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:54,410
you know,
matter in Madison Square Garden and 

2009
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:54,410
fucking,
you know,

2010
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:54,410
the,
the,

2011
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:55,300
the mgm grand,
they,

2012
01:35:55,330 --> 01:36:00,330
they,
those guys deserve to be at those kind 

2013
01:36:00,330 --> 01:36:01,200
of shows.
The level of talent in the WEC right now

2014
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:03,630
is staggering.
One hundred and 3,545

2015
01:36:03,631 --> 01:36:05,970
pound division mean.
This guys are fucking animals man.

2016
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:08,400
And even 1:55,
they have some awesome fighters.

2017
01:36:08,610 --> 01:36:13,610
I think it would be beneficial to 
everybody if it was all the UFC was all 

2018
01:36:13,610 --> 01:36:14,210
one thing,
you know,

2019
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:19,220
especially since they owned the WEC.
I think it would help everybody if they 

2020
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:19,290
could make that happen.
If it's possible.

2021
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:30,870
Rigorous Sachs says use that little kid 
liar in the act.

2022
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:33,400
I don't know if that's really funny for 
sure.

2023
01:36:34,430 --> 01:36:39,430
I think that's funny white now because 
we're talking about right now,

2024
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,770
but I don't know if you could recreate 
the.

2025
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:46,250
It's not funny enough to recreate that.
Say It on stage.

2026
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:49,430
Might be.
Might be when you're talking about if my

2027
01:36:49,431 --> 01:36:52,230
daughter gets to the age where my,
uh,

2028
01:36:52,730 --> 01:36:57,070
have you wrote any new conspiracy theory
kind of comedy lately?

2029
01:36:57,140 --> 01:37:00,460
Because I remember you used to be really
big into writing like Noah's Ark.

2030
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,110
A mystery.

2031
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:08,900
Yeah.
I've been writing a lot of that shit 

2032
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:08,900
lately.
My favorite,

2033
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:08,900
favorite.
She's my favorite shit.

2034
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:09,900
Yeah.
I'm writing more of that shit.

2035
01:37:10,170 --> 01:37:15,170
It's like comedy.
My comedy comes in big waves of 

2036
01:37:15,170 --> 01:37:15,680
creativity.
Williams of inspiration is clay quita.

2037
01:37:15,681 --> 01:37:16,380
Okay.
Yeah,

2038
01:37:16,381 --> 01:37:17,820
he's okay.
Yeah.

2039
01:37:17,821 --> 01:37:20,070
You got cut up Kenny Florian.
Cut Them Up,

2040
01:37:20,071 --> 01:37:22,410
put some elbows.
Web beastie.

2041
01:37:23,250 --> 01:37:23,940
All right,

2042
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:29,780
what's my take short fuse on Jesse 
Ventura's new show.

2043
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:33,710
We already talked about that earlier,
but I think people look for conspiracy.

2044
01:37:33,711 --> 01:37:35,780
There's a lot of conspiracies that are 
real,

2045
01:37:35,930 --> 01:37:38,360
but there's a lot of shit that people 
are just looking for.

2046
01:37:38,361 --> 01:37:39,230
Conspiracies.

2047
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,060
No

2048
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:43,150
good.

2049
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:46,520
Let's see

2050
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,180
on a questions about that.
Jesse Ventura.

2051
01:37:51,620 --> 01:37:53,230
You know why?
Because I,

2052
01:37:54,130 --> 01:37:59,130
I believe a of weird shit so people 
always come to me when it comes to 

2053
01:37:59,130 --> 01:38:01,170
conspiracy theories,
but like we were talking about earlier,

2054
01:38:01,171 --> 01:38:03,960
like Google operation,
northwoods,

2055
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:06,360
Google operation,
midnight,

2056
01:38:06,361 --> 01:38:07,690
climax.
Those are.

2057
01:38:07,870 --> 01:38:10,200
Those are some conspiracies are fucking 
real,

2058
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,770
real and proven.
Man,

2059
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:16,290
I can't keep up with these twitters.
Christopher Columbus.

2060
01:38:16,910 --> 01:38:21,910
What?
Christopher Columbus did not discover 

2061
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:21,910
America.
It's true.

2062
01:38:21,910 --> 01:38:22,780
He landed in the Bahamas,
right?

2063
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:26,100
But yet we are.
Celebrate that dude.

2064
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:28,950
Fucking crazy.

2065
01:38:35,820 --> 01:38:37,380
What am I coming to Atlanta?
I don't know.

2066
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,730
I think the last offer I got from the 
comic club wasn't good,

2067
01:38:41,731 --> 01:38:44,310
so I might come to Atlanta and do like a
theater or something.

2068
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,220
I like comedy clubs.
I liked the idea behind them.

2069
01:38:47,221 --> 01:38:52,221
I like supporting these local clubs.
You know that they're keep local 

2070
01:38:52,221 --> 01:38:56,631
comedians in business and stuff,
but sometimes sometimes I'll give you 

2071
01:38:57,271 --> 01:38:57,990
the best deal.

2072
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:02,300
Is Brock going to live?
Yes.

2073
01:39:02,301 --> 01:39:05,390
I believe Brock Lesnar's going to live.
You're going back to Columbus,

2074
01:39:05,391 --> 01:39:06,980
Ohio?
I'm going back to Columbus,

2075
01:39:06,981 --> 01:39:08,750
Ohio.
We're trying to go back in March,

2076
01:39:08,751 --> 01:39:12,380
but it didn't work out.
I'm going to get a.

2077
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,660
When do I get my tattoos done?
I got them a few years ago.

2078
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:16,790
I'm going to do my right arm soon.
Are you really?

2079
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:19,790
Yeah.
I'm going to do a Aaron Dellavedova.

2080
01:39:19,791 --> 01:39:24,000
The guy who did disarm.
You going to do that?

2081
01:39:24,300 --> 01:39:25,880
Don't do the new one.
Yeah.

2082
01:39:26,840 --> 01:39:29,090
What do you think is going to be glad 
I'm going to do?

2083
01:39:29,340 --> 01:39:34,340
I'm Samurai versus a tiger.
One of those classic Samurai versus a 

2084
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:38,020
tiger.
Japanese style tattoos should make the 

2085
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:38,020
background bs.
Circuit Board.

2086
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:42,170
Now a circuit board.
Maybe.

2087
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:44,240
I think about adding something weird to 
it.

2088
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:47,820
We're still talking about right now.
He hasn't drawn anything.

2089
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:48,290
Everything yet

2090
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:51,850
to Amazon of fucking questions.

2091
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:55,990
Damn you.
Only five minutes deep.

2092
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:59,590
Three hundred 70 players.
Motherfucker.

2093
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:01,240
What am I coming to?
Indianapolis.

2094
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:02,560
Annapolis.
I don't know.

2095
01:40:02,660 --> 01:40:04,540
Never been.
Is it good?

2096
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:05,460
No,
don't lie to me.

2097
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:06,650
No,
I've been there.

2098
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:10,330
I went to Pittsburgh once and it smells 
like suicide.

2099
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:14,470
Didn't like Indiana is not bad.
It's so boring.

2100
01:40:14,530 --> 01:40:17,560
I like to come to places where it's 
socks and give people a good time,

2101
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:19,900
but it's going to.
Columbia is make them drive.

2102
01:40:22,660 --> 01:40:24,340
Not Too many comments.
Clubs in Atlanta anymore.

2103
01:40:24,341 --> 01:40:29,341
They've got a couple.
They've got a lot of good comments to 

2104
01:40:29,341 --> 01:40:29,341
come out of Atlanta.
I just punch line Atlanta.

2105
01:40:29,341 --> 01:40:33,231
Law to good comics come out one.
There's a new comedy clubs I just heard 

2106
01:40:33,231 --> 01:40:33,231
the other day.
That's really good.

2107
01:40:33,231 --> 01:40:35,270
In Atlanta.
No.

2108
01:40:35,950 --> 01:40:37,180
Damn.
I lost three people.

2109
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,460
I was up to three 78.
Atlanta.

2110
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:41,970
I'm not getting any good questions here.
Bitches.

2111
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:46,540
She questions terrible.
Killer whales.

2112
01:40:46,541 --> 01:40:51,541
We were talking about killer whales.
The other problem is a lot of these 

2113
01:40:51,541 --> 01:40:54,091
people are coming at the end of this and
we've broadcast and for how long now?

2114
01:40:54,671 --> 01:40:55,230
Is it still running?

2115
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:56,040
Recording.
Okay,

2116
01:40:56,150 --> 01:40:58,930
so what if I look at.
Wow,

2117
01:40:59,860 --> 01:41:00,970
that's cool.
Recording for.

2118
01:41:02,370 --> 01:41:04,350
We've been talking for an hour and 40 
minutes.

2119
01:41:06,140 --> 01:41:08,010
That's cool.
It records all of it though.

2120
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:11,670
You can also get a premium channel or 40
minutes.

2121
01:41:11,671 --> 01:41:16,671
You know what that means?
I think you can get a premium channel 

2122
01:41:16,671 --> 01:41:16,671
and ustream ad stuff.

2123
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:22,460
Time to refuel.

2124
01:41:28,990 --> 01:41:31,990
What am I in Chicago?
I do not have a Gig in Chicago.

2125
01:41:32,180 --> 01:41:37,180
Dino Jitsu.
I don't have anything lined up but I'll 

2126
01:41:37,180 --> 01:41:38,080
be back there again.
One of my plan to come back to Edmonton,

2127
01:41:38,081 --> 01:41:43,081
Alberta.
I was just there a couple of months ago 

2128
01:41:43,081 --> 01:41:44,521
and the problem is I gotta I gotTa have 
new material for you guys and I like to 

2129
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:48,490
come no more than once a year so that I 
have enough time to write a bunch of new

2130
01:41:48,491 --> 01:41:53,491
shit and so I don't.
I don't want you seeing the same act 

2131
01:41:53,491 --> 01:41:54,220
every time I come.
I want to have a bunch new shit.

2132
01:41:54,221 --> 01:41:59,221
I this is the worst feeling in the world
when you're performing for people and 

2133
01:41:59,221 --> 01:41:59,221
you know,
they're like,

2134
01:41:59,221 --> 01:41:59,221
oh,
I've heard this before.

2135
01:41:59,350 --> 01:42:01,900
You want them to like some bits.
It's cool.

2136
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:06,901
Like if you want to hear some bits that 
you like classics and you want to hear 

2137
01:42:06,901 --> 01:42:06,901
him live.

2138
01:42:06,901 --> 01:42:11,370
I totally understand that,
but I know you want to see mostly new 

2139
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:11,370
shit,
so I come to places.

2140
01:42:11,370 --> 01:42:16,351
I tried to come no more than once a year
and ideally I like to come every year 

2141
01:42:16,351 --> 01:42:20,041
and a half.
I like to make sure that you got plenty 

2142
01:42:20,041 --> 01:42:21,160
of new shit.
Rewrite CD.

2143
01:42:22,110 --> 01:42:27,110
Ha.
Brian thinks I need to put my first cd 

2144
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:27,450
on DVD,
rewrite it and Redo it.

2145
01:42:28,090 --> 01:42:31,570
Rewrite all the jokes and like master 
every single jokes.

2146
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:35,290
I think it's better to just leave it 
alone and just come up with new shit.

2147
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:37,450
Anything in Philly?
I'll be back in philly again too.

2148
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:39,340
I love that place.
Helium is the shit.

2149
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:43,030
That place is awesome,
but if you go to Joe Rogan.net,

2150
01:42:43,031 --> 01:42:48,031
my website,
there's my whole schedule up and it'll 

2151
01:42:48,031 --> 01:42:49,210
tell you exactly where I'm going to be.
Chattanooga,

2152
01:42:49,211 --> 01:42:52,780
Tennessee has a great comedy club.
How dare you just fucking lie to me like

2153
01:42:52,781 --> 01:42:56,020
that.
How dare you,

2154
01:42:56,021 --> 01:42:58,490
dude?
Trying to Chattanooga,

2155
01:42:58,930 --> 01:43:00,490
Tennessee.
I was just in Memphis.

2156
01:43:00,491 --> 01:43:03,400
We had a good time in Memphis.
Memphis was fun.

2157
01:43:03,450 --> 01:43:06,640
You know what?
I know West Virginia and West Virginia,

2158
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Virginia is awesome.
If you ever been at Virginia and West 

2159
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Virginia,
West Virginia have sex,

2160
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:12,150
but Virginia is kind of cool.

2161
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:15,730
Pittsburgh's smell crud by the funny 
bird right there.

2162
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:16,690
We're not all poor.

2163
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:18,390
Hmm,
okay.

2164
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:25,070
Did you know that there's a show called 
campus pd and it's cops only on college 

2165
01:43:25,951 --> 01:43:27,480
campuses.
That's hilarious.

2166
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:31,890
And it's just girls puking get naked.
Just bar fights.

2167
01:43:31,891 --> 01:43:33,960
When's the show?
It's on g four.

2168
01:43:34,020 --> 01:43:36,750
It's like on every day I think,
and it's called campus.

2169
01:43:36,751 --> 01:43:39,150
I think campus pd and it's this cops on 
campus

2170
01:43:39,230 --> 01:43:41,120
that doesn't seem like it should be 
fair.

2171
01:43:41,290 --> 01:43:42,800
You shouldn't.
If you're a kid,

2172
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:43,600
first of all,
if you're.

2173
01:43:43,610 --> 01:43:48,610
If you're in college,
you're going to want to be on that 

2174
01:43:48,610 --> 01:43:50,531
stupid show because you're dumb and 
you're going to want to be on TV and 

2175
01:43:50,531 --> 01:43:52,370
it's not fair for them to explain to you
like that your vulnerability,

2176
01:43:52,370 --> 01:43:54,260
they have this,
this incredible access.

2177
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:57,770
They can put you on fucking television 
like the Jersey shore for sure.

2178
01:43:57,771 --> 01:44:02,771
Those guys get mixed.
Some of the people in the show are 

2179
01:44:02,771 --> 01:44:04,250
blurred out and regular cops and this 
show,

2180
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:09,370
but most of the time they're not blurred
because if they're not blurred it means 

2181
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:09,370
they signed a release yet.
But did they get.

2182
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:10,370
What did they get?
Did they get off?

2183
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:13,490
Did it get anything like charges off?
Like what is the deal?

2184
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:14,570
That's a good question.
You know,

2185
01:44:14,571 --> 01:44:17,570
do they get $500 credit towards bail?
Well,

2186
01:44:17,571 --> 01:44:21,470
how bad are there crimes?
Maybe the attempted murder all the way.

2187
01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:22,910
I mean,
you've watched cops.

2188
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:24,070
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2189
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:25,760
I think a lot of those guys that do it 
for money,

2190
01:44:25,860 --> 01:44:27,650
they're 50 bucks.
100 bucks,

2191
01:44:27,651 --> 01:44:30,560
two bucks on this and a lot of them are 
probably so fucking dumb.

2192
01:44:30,770 --> 01:44:31,760
You know,
they just sign it.

2193
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,630
They just want to be on TV to watch the 
Steven Seagal show.

2194
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:38,000
Steven Seagal has got this guy's fucking
arrested.

2195
01:44:38,001 --> 01:44:43,001
He's.
They pull them out of the fucking 

2196
01:44:43,001 --> 01:44:43,001
throwing this guy down in the ground.
You know,

2197
01:44:43,001 --> 01:44:46,511
the guy said he had a gun and he got 
pulled over in his car and he told them 

2198
01:44:46,511 --> 01:44:47,210
he had a gun and there you grab on the 
yank him out,

2199
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:49,300
you reach into your car and you said you
had a gun.

2200
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:50,350
Oh Man,
I'm just,

2201
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:53,560
I'm just trying to park the car.
You know there is that Steven Seagal,

2202
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:58,420
that Steven's brother,
they got this guy handcuffed.

2203
01:44:58,630 --> 01:45:03,630
I mean this guy is going to jail.
He's got a fucking gun in his car 

2204
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:07,441
illegally.
They pull him over and all he wants to 

2205
01:45:07,441 --> 01:45:07,530
do two shakes.
He was wanting to shake.

2206
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:11,440
It's not a Annie Annie.
Fucking brilliant.

2207
01:45:11,470 --> 01:45:16,470
It's brilliant.
Nothing more brilliant in the way he 

2208
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,470
talks to black people though.

2209
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,470
He goes into the black boys.
What up?

2210
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:18,370
Because what's going on?
Much love.

2211
01:45:18,430 --> 01:45:19,420
Much love.
Yeah.

2212
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:20,220
Yeah.
He talked to it's black.

2213
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:22,710
It's awesome.
It's awesome.

2214
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:26,310
You think cheaters is real or fake?
Cheaters is fake.

2215
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,050
Do you think?
All of it or just some of them.

2216
01:45:28,051 --> 01:45:29,400
Some of it.
Whatever they need to do.

2217
01:45:29,450 --> 01:45:30,440
Yeah.
Some of them.

2218
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:31,940
It's really.
Yeah,

2219
01:45:32,010 --> 01:45:34,470
and he got stabbed.
That shit was real fucking stabbed him.

2220
01:45:34,530 --> 01:45:37,620
I was watching an episode last night and
this boyfriend tack,

2221
01:45:37,621 --> 01:45:39,200
the other boyfriend hasn't been a handle
off.

2222
01:45:39,230 --> 01:45:40,360
He's.
I'm like,

2223
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:45,500
wait,
he's just doing this is not going like 

2224
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:45,540
you would be just punching his head.
Right?

2225
01:45:45,541 --> 01:45:48,210
You wouldn't just be going like,
a lot of it is staged.

2226
01:45:48,570 --> 01:45:49,950
They give them some money.
You know?

2227
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,440
Jersey shore needs to die.
Rob Fitz.

2228
01:45:52,470 --> 01:45:55,520
I hadn't seen it.
He says I disagree.

2229
01:45:55,540 --> 01:45:56,670
Rob Fitz.
Oh seven.

2230
01:45:56,671 --> 01:45:57,600
Why does it need to die?

2231
01:45:57,720 --> 01:45:59,610
I haven't seen there.
They're definitely getting exploited,

2232
01:45:59,611 --> 01:46:01,380
but you know what?
Fuck them.

2233
01:46:02,490 --> 01:46:03,570
Fuck them.
Exploited.

2234
01:46:03,810 --> 01:46:06,390
Exploit the shit out of him.
Let me see it.

2235
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:09,450
Let me see the whole thing.
I grew up with people like that.

2236
01:46:09,540 --> 01:46:12,420
Guido's don't just exist in,
in New Jersey.

2237
01:46:12,630 --> 01:46:14,600
I grew up at Guido's in Boston and 
others.

2238
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:16,710
I know a lot of them from east Boston 
especially.

2239
01:46:16,711 --> 01:46:21,711
I know a lot of Guido's revere.
I used to teach taekwondo at a place 

2240
01:46:21,711 --> 01:46:22,660
called Nautilus plus and revere revere 
Massachusetts.

2241
01:46:22,661 --> 01:46:26,100
Did Guido capital of the world.
It was all Iraq's and big hair.

2242
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:29,510
It was like some of my earliest jokes 
when I started out doing comedy,

2243
01:46:29,511 --> 01:46:34,511
we're all about revere was all about how
growing up in that Shit,

2244
01:46:36,151 --> 01:46:41,151
man,
that a good thing is you appreciate 

2245
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:41,151
nice,
relaxed,

2246
01:46:41,151 --> 01:46:42,360
cool people after you'd been in 
environment like that.

2247
01:46:42,361 --> 01:46:47,361
You appreciate people that are on a 
different frequency instead of always 

2248
01:46:47,430 --> 01:46:49,980
trying to get pumped up.
You don't try to get swole,

2249
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:55,150
you know,
everybody's trying to wear the right 

2250
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:55,150
clothes or wearing cologne pitches like 
the smell.

2251
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:57,840
Like I knew so many guys like that.
When I watched Jersey shore,

2252
01:46:57,841 --> 01:47:02,010
it's almost a little too painful to me.
Like I knew too many dudes like that.

2253
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:07,870
Rob Fitz.
Oh,

2254
01:47:07,871 --> 01:47:10,380
I can't keep going to you buddy.
Bad Bobby.

2255
01:47:10,410 --> 01:47:11,280
Hey,
bad bobby.

2256
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:16,460
He says,
I've been smoking weed and watching 

2257
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:17,190
Jersey shore all day laughing folks.
You should fall bad.

2258
01:47:17,191 --> 01:47:18,550
Bobby.
He's a very fun guy.

2259
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:19,910
Nice guy.
Bobby.

2260
01:47:20,460 --> 01:47:25,460
You don't think so because there's two 
unknowns and I know one's real and I 

2261
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:25,940
know one's not.
Yeah,

2262
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:28,140
the spelling is a little too good,
right?

2263
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:30,420
Might be a fake bad bobby.
Yeah,

2264
01:47:30,580 --> 01:47:35,580
that bobby is an internet legend and I 
think some people might want to fake 

2265
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:37,870
being bad.
Bobby bobby is a real dude.

2266
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,420
He owns a strip club.
He was a.

2267
01:47:39,421 --> 01:47:44,421
it's a very interesting character.
He was a stockbroker and made a ton of 

2268
01:47:44,421 --> 01:47:46,210
money and then retired to open up a 
strip club in Vancouver.

2269
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:51,390
I just just bangs chicks all day just 
because he's just a bad motherfucker.

2270
01:47:52,571 --> 01:47:54,080
You just eat steaks,
shoots human,

2271
01:47:54,110 --> 01:47:59,110
grows always telling him coffee to just 
drink so much coffee.

2272
01:48:00,370 --> 01:48:01,960
He's a,
he's a funny dude.

2273
01:48:01,961 --> 01:48:04,680
He says really funny shit.
And He um,

2274
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:08,610
he lives in Vancouver.
I can't wait to see them again.

2275
01:48:08,611 --> 01:48:13,611
We're going to see them again in June 
when we go up there for the UFC 

2276
01:48:13,611 --> 01:48:13,680
hollaback.
That's the rumor.

2277
01:48:13,740 --> 01:48:14,580
UFC in June.

2278
01:48:18,430 --> 01:48:19,730
Okay.
The UFC,

2279
01:48:19,731 --> 01:48:21,740
Japan.
I want to see that.

2280
01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:24,050
I don't know.
I don't know.

2281
01:48:24,310 --> 01:48:29,310
It's hard to go over there.
I think so you get some questions here,

2282
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:31,680
man.
The streams coming in too fast.

2283
01:48:31,681 --> 01:48:33,120
I can't read these bitches.
That's cool.

2284
01:48:33,121 --> 01:48:34,560
[inaudible].
That's the twitter stream.

2285
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,150
Did I see the bid on snl about Jersey 
shore?

2286
01:48:38,151 --> 01:48:40,310
Man,
I haven't watched snl in a long time.

2287
01:48:40,730 --> 01:48:44,030
I find it really hard to trust them.
You know,

2288
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:46,490
it's like so many of those sketches are 
just not funny.

2289
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,410
It's too hard to trust,
you know,

2290
01:48:48,411 --> 01:48:51,650
to like commit to sitting there and it's
one of those things.

2291
01:48:51,651 --> 01:48:54,530
I'll give you a few.
I'll watch the clips when there's things

2292
01:48:54,550 --> 01:48:56,180
in,
on the Internet that really funny.

2293
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,800
Like Dick in a box.
Remember that.

2294
01:48:57,801 --> 01:48:59,690
That was an snl gag,
wasn't it?

2295
01:48:59,710 --> 01:49:04,710
Yeah.
I watched them when they get to the 

2296
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:04,710
Internet,
but I can't.

2297
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:04,710
I'm,
I need somebody else to edit it,

2298
01:49:04,710 --> 01:49:06,590
find the funny ones and make a big deal 
out of it.

2299
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:11,240
I can't commit to watching that show.
I seen avatar yet.

2300
01:49:11,241 --> 01:49:12,110
No,
I have not.

2301
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:17,320
We're going to.
Brian and I are going to go see it 

2302
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:17,320
probably the day after Christmas.

2303
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:17,810
We're going to get fucking trimmed up 
and go to this.

2304
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:20,480
I guess one way that we could go to the 
D.

2305
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:25,760
Yeah.
I think we're already going to have 

2306
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:25,760
heart attacks and that's the way to do 
it.

2307
01:49:25,820 --> 01:49:28,310
I'm not crazy.
Not what turns per.

2308
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:30,040
No.
I took a little and I was,

2309
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:32,730
well,
let's just go with pot cookies.

2310
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:33,890
Popcorn.
That's fine.

2311
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:35,830
I got some pot cookies and it just like 
shrooms.

2312
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:37,610
Yeah.
It might as well be drums.

2313
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:41,750
Yeah.
I can talk about ancient alien theories.

2314
01:49:41,751 --> 01:49:45,350
He says in all capsj,
g one slash 29.

2315
01:49:45,710 --> 01:49:48,080
Please talk about ancient alien 
theories.

2316
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:53,400
The big theory of the ancient alien 
theories is that human beings were 

2317
01:49:53,400 --> 01:49:57,421
manufactured and that they use genetic 
manipulation to take monkeys and add 

2318
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:01,840
alien DNA to the monkeys to make people.
When you think about that,

2319
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:04,120
Brian,
I think Asians are aliens.

2320
01:50:04,180 --> 01:50:05,720
They could be right.
And maybe that's why they saw.

2321
01:50:06,960 --> 01:50:09,060
Fuck is calling me while I'm on my 
podcast.

2322
01:50:09,090 --> 01:50:11,180
Goddammit.
Um,

2323
01:50:11,240 --> 01:50:11,430
let's

2324
01:50:13,880 --> 01:50:16,010
excuse me.
I'm in the middle of a podcast.

2325
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:20,470
Oh,
how much longer should I be?

2326
01:50:23,240 --> 01:50:24,470
Okay.
You want me to end soon?

2327
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:28,040
Hi,
I'm often daddy's.

2328
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:30,970
Daddy's on the Internet.
Okay.

2329
01:50:31,670 --> 01:50:32,540
Ten minutes.
Okay.

2330
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:35,110
Okay.
Gentlemen,

2331
01:50:35,330 --> 01:50:36,770
that's,
that's the reality.

2332
01:50:36,980 --> 01:50:40,790
See you see me fucking standup comedian 
slash cage fighter.

2333
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,160
No Pussy,
whipped husband and daddy.

2334
01:50:43,580 --> 01:50:48,410
Daddy has to stop smoking weed and doing
his little webcam show because everybody

2335
01:50:48,411 --> 01:50:53,411
wants to eat.
And they want to open up Christmas 

2336
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:53,411
presents.
Merry Christmas.

2337
01:50:53,411 --> 01:50:57,251
You'd already pitches.
What was I talking about before that 

2338
01:50:57,251 --> 01:50:57,251
happened?

2339
01:50:57,251 --> 01:50:57,950
Oh,
we're talking about ancient aliens.

2340
01:50:58,130 --> 01:50:58,820
Yeah.
You were saying what is,

2341
01:50:58,850 --> 01:51:01,530
what's your theories are?
Asians were like,

2342
01:51:01,640 --> 01:51:06,640
aliens landed and had Asians and then 
like did not like the Asians nowadays 

2343
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:08,030
aren't aliens,
but there are a breed of aliens.

2344
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:11,090
Like maybe they're more alien than we 
are.

2345
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:13,670
Maybe there was like different 
formulations.

2346
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:16,850
Maybe that's what all the different 
breeds of human beings are,

2347
01:51:16,851 --> 01:51:17,900
you know,
you know,

2348
01:51:18,530 --> 01:51:21,620
different,
like Italians were just much.

2349
01:51:21,621 --> 01:51:26,621
And they're pure.
They're more pure to the actual human 

2350
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:26,621
race,
you know,

2351
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:27,410
they're,
well definitely Asians are more pure.

2352
01:51:27,411 --> 01:51:32,411
I mean there's,
there's billions of them and they look 

2353
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:32,411
very similar.
That's incredible.

2354
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:33,670
They managed to do that.
Yeah.

2355
01:51:33,770 --> 01:51:36,830
I mean I guess they'd probably look at 
Europeans and a similar way,

2356
01:51:37,100 --> 01:51:39,090
but the difference is with the blonde 
hair,

2357
01:51:39,140 --> 01:51:44,140
red hair and brown hair,
Europeans come in all different colors 

2358
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:46,550
and sizes,
but even like you go Korean to Japanese,

2359
01:51:46,551 --> 01:51:49,010
to Chinese,
it's all black hair.

2360
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:51,950
It's all real similar skin tones.
I mean,

2361
01:51:51,951 --> 01:51:53,580
God damn,
there's some similarities.

2362
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:55,170
I would love to be Asian,
I think.

2363
01:51:55,410 --> 01:51:56,220
Really?
Yeah.

2364
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:59,260
Do you have an excuse for having such a 
little Dick?

2365
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:02,060
Oh No.
I mean seriously.

2366
01:52:02,061 --> 01:52:04,400
You don't have to shave.
Most of them don't have to shave.

2367
01:52:04,430 --> 01:52:05,330
I hate shaving,
dude.

2368
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:07,940
I fucking hate it.
Well,

2369
01:52:07,950 --> 01:52:11,510
you save everything.
You make it an adventure.

2370
01:52:11,510 --> 01:52:16,510
I'll keep my ball,
my lower ball hair or shave off because 

2371
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:16,510
there's some great ones in there I'm 
trying to avoid.

2372
01:52:16,510 --> 01:52:18,090
But my upper pillars,
I leave those pitches alone.

2373
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:19,790
I trim them a little bit

2374
01:52:19,900 --> 01:52:21,220
when I was,
when I lived alone,

2375
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:26,240
I would take it and put it on a trash 
bag and roll around like a pig just so 

2376
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:29,110
to get it all over my back and then you 
can really get the,

2377
01:52:29,490 --> 01:52:34,490
the scraper scraper.
So then you'd have to get like a towel 

2378
01:52:34,490 --> 01:52:36,990
on the towel and you just rub hard.
Really work.

2379
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:38,140
Yeah.
Wow.

2380
01:52:38,141 --> 01:52:38,210
Wow.

2381
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:43,940
Brian,
innovative hair loss methods by Brian 

2382
01:52:43,940 --> 01:52:46,370
and Michael had a nice thick mountain 
man.

2383
01:52:46,371 --> 01:52:48,400
Beard for a while back when I was,
uh,

2384
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:49,790
doing that.
Uh,

2385
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:51,080
Evan Tanner.
Attribute beard.

2386
01:52:51,081 --> 01:52:53,240
I have a good one going,
but I haven't shaved for something.

2387
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:58,241
I had to do.
Rejoined the human rejoin society.

2388
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:02,090
Well,
back when I came back from Colorado too.

2389
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:04,010
I was really thinking about growing one 
in Colorado,

2390
01:53:04,011 --> 01:53:08,510
but that might push me over the edge 
when I was living in Colorado on the top

2391
01:53:08,511 --> 01:53:10,310
of a mountain.
If I had a beard up there too,

2392
01:53:10,311 --> 01:53:12,140
I probably would have got way close to 
an animal,

2393
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:13,570
you know,
if I let my cell phone.

2394
01:53:13,571 --> 01:53:14,540
It's crazy.
Harry,

2395
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:16,600
was there any point of living there like
that?

2396
01:53:16,601 --> 01:53:17,990
You were just outside and you're just 
like,

2397
01:53:17,991 --> 01:53:19,340
Holy Shit,
this is scary.

2398
01:53:19,370 --> 01:53:20,660
You know,
what am I doing here?

2399
01:53:21,620 --> 01:53:22,790
Definitely.
It was definitely scary,

2400
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:26,780
but that was part of the appeal of it to
me is that it was so off the grid.

2401
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:32,200
It was show outside of the way a normal 
person every day gets to experience 

2402
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,250
life.
I was living in the fucking woods,

2403
01:53:34,430 --> 01:53:39,430
not just kind of in the woods.
I was living on 150 acres on the top of 

2404
01:53:39,430 --> 01:53:41,480
a mountain in Boulder,
Colorado outside of boulder.

2405
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:43,720
I mean,
it was like nine miles above boulder.

2406
01:53:43,721 --> 01:53:45,230
It was pretty trippy,
8,500

2407
01:53:45,231 --> 01:53:48,260
feet above sea level and all sorts of 
wildlife.

2408
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,930
Deer every day.
Dear.

2409
01:53:49,940 --> 01:53:52,640
I was on a dirt road for eight miles 
dear everyday.

2410
01:53:52,670 --> 01:53:55,670
I would see deer every day.
I would see foxes occasionally.

2411
01:53:55,671 --> 01:53:57,650
I'd see porcupines people,
Peoplesoft bear.

2412
01:53:57,651 --> 01:54:00,070
I never saw bear something outline in my
backyard.

2413
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,490
I mean,
you saw a lot of shit,

2414
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,020
eagles all the time.
I mean,

2415
01:54:03,021 --> 01:54:06,470
it was really intense.
It was so real,

2416
01:54:06,520 --> 01:54:07,360
you know,
it was just,

2417
01:54:07,361 --> 01:54:08,540
it was so like,
you know,

2418
01:54:08,541 --> 01:54:10,760
you're driving,
you're seeing wild animals.

2419
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:12,230
Like we'll wild animals.

2420
01:54:12,230 --> 01:54:15,530
Big fucking 10 point bucks walking down 
the street,

2421
01:54:15,830 --> 01:54:17,930
you know,
and it's very,

2422
01:54:17,931 --> 01:54:22,931
very interesting.
It's just the fact that you can live 

2423
01:54:22,931 --> 01:54:22,931
somewhere like that.
It's such A.

2424
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:27,970
I think people get stuck in patterns and
I think it's real easy to get stuck in 

2425
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:29,540
the same way of thinking,
the same way of looking at the world and

2426
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:34,541
nothing changes that like moving to a 
new place for awhile and moving to a 

2427
01:54:34,541 --> 01:54:36,500
place that's as stunning as the 
mountains of Colorado.

2428
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,800
I would love to go back,
but it's just not practical to have a 

2429
01:54:41,800 --> 01:54:45,700
wife and kids and you know,
and have little vulnerable babies and 

2430
01:54:45,700 --> 01:54:49,121
being around fucking wild monsters.
I mean my dog had eaten by a mountain 

2431
01:54:49,121 --> 01:54:50,270
lion when we were up there.
That's for real.

2432
01:54:50,630 --> 01:54:53,900
Like we saw a mountain lion.
I let the little dog out by himself.

2433
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:54,920
Dog Disappears.

2434
01:54:55,100 --> 01:54:57,350
I mean that's all got eaten by a fucking
mountain lion,

2435
01:54:57,770 --> 01:55:02,770
you know,
which is very likely and those animals 

2436
01:55:02,770 --> 01:55:03,260
died of predation up there all the time.
It's very common.

2437
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:05,600
They even pray on animals.
They get used to them.

2438
01:55:05,601 --> 01:55:09,050
They get used to recognizing and 
associating the barks,

2439
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:14,170
barks of these animals with like pray 
and so they go towards where they hear 

2440
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:17,891
barks.
So it's actually kind of dangerous when 

2441
01:55:17,891 --> 01:55:18,290
you have a fucking house with dogs 
barking because sometimes these mountain

2442
01:55:18,291 --> 01:55:19,860
lions,
like if they're hungry it,

2443
01:55:19,861 --> 01:55:22,490
especially if they're old and they can't
catch dear anymore,

2444
01:55:22,640 --> 01:55:27,170
they know these dogs are like in a cage 
over their fence.

2445
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,240
Like it ain't shit.
Jack Dogs,

2446
01:55:29,241 --> 01:55:31,310
they do it all the time.
They're scary as fuck.

2447
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:34,310
Do you think people that sleep with guns
underneath their pills,

2448
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:37,280
if that's just fake.
Somebody said it once to impress a girl.

2449
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:37,910
No,
I know I've got.

2450
01:55:37,911 --> 01:55:40,970
It does.
It really is just seeing them as like,

2451
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:42,140
that's dumb.
Well,

2452
01:55:42,200 --> 01:55:44,540
if you want it,
if you want it to have it right there.

2453
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:46,410
If you live in a place where you think 
you're going to need it,

2454
01:55:46,411 --> 01:55:47,730
right?
I mean,

2455
01:55:47,850 --> 01:55:49,560
look,
it doesn't seem like it's a good idea,

2456
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:54,561
but what if someone breaks in your house
and you need the gun and you just go 

2457
01:55:54,561 --> 01:55:56,100
like that and you got the gun and then 
that keeps you alive.

2458
01:55:56,770 --> 01:55:58,290
There's that way of looking at it.
You know?

2459
01:55:58,291 --> 01:56:00,240
There's the way of looking at it like,
hey man,

2460
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:01,950
if you think that way,
man,

2461
01:56:02,100 --> 01:56:05,100
fucking nothing can happen to you,
man.

2462
01:56:05,101 --> 01:56:07,770
As long as you think positive,
you can sing that way.

2463
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:12,420
It be one of those dudes that goes 
through life convinced that nothing ever

2464
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:14,490
bad is gonna happen to you.
You know?

2465
01:56:14,530 --> 01:56:17,160
I mean that that is possible.
You might sneak through,

2466
01:56:17,520 --> 01:56:21,180
but shit might get ugly.
Shit gets ugly.

2467
01:56:22,050 --> 01:56:24,720
You want one of these bitches,
this shit's important.

2468
01:56:25,590 --> 01:56:26,580
Guns,
ladies and gentlemen.

2469
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:28,590
I believe in the second amendment.

2470
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:33,510
I believe.
Go shooting Santana.

2471
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:36,360
Haven't been shooting it.
Let's go.

2472
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:39,500
Let's go.
Uh,

2473
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:41,420
let's go on Monday.
Cool.

2474
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,260
I think I'm definitely.
Gun Control's important.

2475
01:56:46,261 --> 01:56:51,261
You gotta definitely screen people.
You got to definitely make sure that 

2476
01:56:51,261 --> 01:56:51,390
people don't,
you know,

2477
01:56:51,420 --> 01:56:52,000
the,
the,

2478
01:56:52,010 --> 01:56:53,820
the,
the people can't get access to guns that

2479
01:56:53,821 --> 01:56:55,650
are fucking crazy and that,
you know,

2480
01:56:55,651 --> 01:57:00,651
and that's the problem with a lot of gun
shows is there's a lot of people that 

2481
01:57:00,651 --> 01:57:01,140
sell guns at gun shows that don't give a
fuck if you're licensed or not.

2482
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:06,320
They're just trying to make some money.
And there's been expos there on that 

2483
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,961
where they've shown that people in gun 
shows will sell guns to people that 

2484
01:57:08,961 --> 01:57:08,970
don't know.
Not really supposed to have guns,

2485
01:57:09,330 --> 01:57:09,750
but

2486
01:57:10,920 --> 01:57:13,140
the guns are out there.
They're fucking out there,

2487
01:57:13,141 --> 01:57:14,270
there's millions of them.
You're not going.

2488
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,000
You usually have one,
you know,

2489
01:57:16,010 --> 01:57:21,010
if there's millions of guns out there,
better to have it and did not need it 

2490
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:21,870
than to need it and not have it.
That's,

2491
01:57:22,110 --> 01:57:23,550
you know,
I'm,

2492
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:26,430
I'm an optimist.
I'm not a pessimist.

2493
01:57:26,431 --> 01:57:27,360
I'm not,
you know,

2494
01:57:27,370 --> 01:57:32,370
I,
I believe that most human beings are 

2495
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:33,270
good,
but I've come across way too many fucked

2496
01:57:33,271 --> 01:57:37,440
up people to have complete and total 
blind trust in the human race.

2497
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:38,810
I just don't.
I've,

2498
01:57:38,970 --> 01:57:42,570
I've seen way too many fucked up violent
things happen.

2499
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:47,750
I've seen way too many crazy people I've
come in contact with and had to deal 

2500
01:57:47,750 --> 01:57:51,141
with way too many fucking crazy people.
There's a lot of people out there that 

2501
01:57:51,141 --> 01:57:54,471
you can't reason with.
There's a lot of people out there that 

2502
01:57:54,471 --> 01:57:54,471
are just broken and nuts and that's 
real.

2503
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:56,770
Okay.

2504
01:57:56,920 --> 01:58:01,920
Oh,
is that sanas bells since bells was 

2505
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:01,920
living in Los Angeles?
Bells?

2506
01:58:01,920 --> 01:58:01,920
No.
No.

2507
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:07,170
I mean,
is that Santa is you're saying we have 

2508
01:58:07,170 --> 01:58:07,300
to end this.
Wouldn't have to end this real soon.

2509
01:58:08,320 --> 01:58:10,570
Do you do to do what?
UFC superfight what?

2510
01:58:10,571 --> 01:58:13,660
I'd like to see brock lesnar versus 
door.

2511
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:18,720
That's what I would like to say.
That's what everybody would should want 

2512
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:18,720
to say.
Oh,

2513
01:58:18,720 --> 01:58:20,470
that's a diaper diaper.
This is my reality.

2514
01:58:20,471 --> 01:58:22,930
Ladies and gentleman,
good diapers in my office,

2515
01:58:22,931 --> 01:58:26,200
my boss' office with my make me hard 
poster.

2516
01:58:26,201 --> 01:58:31,201
I got to fucking Oakley split.

2517
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:34,160
Nope.

2518
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:36,760
I don't know.
We'll talk later.

2519
01:58:36,940 --> 01:58:41,940
Oh,
that's those eyeglasses that are empty 

2520
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:41,940
MP.
Three players.

2521
01:58:41,940 --> 01:58:42,760
That's the kind that dog.
The bounty hunter.

2522
01:58:42,761 --> 01:58:44,530
Whereas Hollaback.
It's hilarious.

2523
01:58:46,040 --> 01:58:49,060
All Right Ladies and gentlemen,
this has been very interesting.

2524
01:58:49,061 --> 01:58:53,260
We were up to 379 motherfuckers.
I want to thank you for tuning in.

2525
01:58:53,830 --> 01:58:54,580
This is,
um,

2526
01:58:54,810 --> 01:58:57,320
we're going to do this much more often 
now that I have this set up.

2527
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:00,850
And I finally installed this Webcam that
I bought like five.

2528
01:59:01,290 --> 01:59:03,550
Yeah.
You got to get your internet faded.

2529
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:08,580
You get new HD.
I'm going to get my internet updated it 

2530
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:09,470
hd cameras now.
Fifty nine bucks on Amazon.

2531
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,940
Look for the.
Yeah.

2532
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:13,100
Well no you don't.
That's actually an old camera now.

2533
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:15,380
Does that sound good now?
But it looks okay.

2534
01:59:15,440 --> 01:59:15,980
Yeah,
that's okay.

2535
01:59:15,981 --> 01:59:17,270
But see,
it's an hd.

2536
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:18,370
You can,
you can be.

2537
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:23,380
Bragg has nate steering it.
But isn't that like more bandwidth for 

2538
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:25,721
Beulah download.
You have a net when you have 20 

2539
01:59:25,721 --> 01:59:25,721
megabytes,
you know,

2540
01:59:25,721 --> 01:59:27,290
but crazy doesn't affect them.
It affects them downloading it.

2541
01:59:27,291 --> 01:59:31,420
It only affects up upload once.
Once I get the Internet,

2542
01:59:31,440 --> 01:59:32,510
do it,
I'll make it.

2543
01:59:33,350 --> 01:59:36,260
I'll make it hd so you can see the ugly,
ugly.

2544
01:59:36,950 --> 01:59:39,050
All right.
What else we got here?

2545
01:59:40,930 --> 01:59:44,280
One of the next time I'm going to be 
used streaming Johnny Bananas.

2546
01:59:44,370 --> 01:59:46,400
That's a very good question.
Um,

2547
01:59:46,830 --> 01:59:49,470
I think we're good.
What I'm going to try to do is,

2548
01:59:49,471 --> 01:59:50,310
uh,
my,

2549
01:59:50,340 --> 01:59:55,340
my ultimate goal in 2010 is I'm trying 
to write a book right now and I've been 

2550
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:59,901
spending a lot of time writing that,
writing standup comedy and not so much 

2551
01:59:59,901 --> 02:00:03,021
time updating my website,
but I do go on twitter because twitter 

2552
02:00:03,021 --> 02:00:04,410
is fun for me and it's like a little 
exercise in writing to make things short

2553
02:00:04,411 --> 02:00:07,080
and make them 140 characters.
I think that's fun.

2554
02:00:07,290 --> 02:00:10,420
So it is,
it teaches you to like,

2555
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,290
you know,
edit your shit with comedy.

2556
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:15,390
That's very important.
Economy of words.

2557
02:00:15,391 --> 02:00:17,250
It's what it's called.
And in stand up comedy,

2558
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:19,890
it's very important that the less words 
you could use to make a point,

2559
02:00:20,010 --> 02:00:21,810
the funnier it's going to be when it 
hits people,

2560
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:24,780
the more you,
the more verbose it is,

2561
02:00:24,810 --> 02:00:27,300
the more it's not funny when it gets 
there.

2562
02:00:27,750 --> 02:00:28,560
So,
uh,

2563
02:00:28,561 --> 02:00:31,950
I think twitter's real good for that.
But my point is in 2010,

2564
02:00:31,951 --> 02:00:34,800
what I'm.
My main goal is more on the Internet.

2565
02:00:34,950 --> 02:00:37,410
More shit like this,
more ustream shit.

2566
02:00:37,620 --> 02:00:42,620
More twitter and definitely more blogs.
But I'm going to start doing more video 

2567
02:00:42,620 --> 02:00:46,770
shit and I'm carrying A.
I got a cool flip thing from the UFC for

2568
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:48,210
Christmas,
which is perfect.

2569
02:00:48,390 --> 02:00:49,880
I'm going to bring that bitch with me 
everywhere.

2570
02:00:49,881 --> 02:00:54,240
I'm going to start putting shit online 
on youtube on a really regular basis.

2571
02:00:54,360 --> 02:00:58,050
And I know there's a little ustream,
a streaming thing for the iphone.

2572
02:00:58,170 --> 02:01:00,300
We're going to try that shit out.
But it's probably gay.

2573
02:01:00,740 --> 02:01:01,820
Yeah.
Everyone Wifi,

2574
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:06,821
it's not bad.
You actually see the chat on the screen 

2575
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:06,821
too.
Oh really?

2576
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:06,821
Yeah.
If you're on Wifi,

2577
02:01:06,821 --> 02:01:07,070
it's good.
It's good.

2578
02:01:07,071 --> 02:01:08,840
Yeah.
I mean I've tried on three g Wifi.

2579
02:01:08,841 --> 02:01:10,490
That means I'm on a fucking computer.
Why?

2580
02:01:10,491 --> 02:01:13,330
Fuck around unless you were at Denny's.
Denny's.

2581
02:01:13,880 --> 02:01:14,750
Yeah.
Amazing.

2582
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,390
Welcome to 2009 people.
Shit is getting crazy.

2583
02:01:19,990 --> 02:01:20,470
Well,
listen,

2584
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:23,260
I gotta go.
I gotta go eat dinner with my family.

2585
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:28,320
I don't want to leave people hungry.
We've got exchange presidents and all 

2586
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:28,780
that good shit.
I love you motherfuckers.

2587
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:31,130
Thank you very much for tuning in.
And uh,

2588
02:01:31,210 --> 02:01:33,610
we are going to do this again.
Don't know when,

2589
02:01:33,820 --> 02:01:35,340
but within a week,
right?

2590
02:01:35,350 --> 02:01:40,350
Yeah.
We'll come in and just do it once a 

2591
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:40,350
week.
Once a week.

2592
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:40,350
Two hours once

2593
02:01:40,350 --> 02:01:40,900
a week.
I didn't have to go.

2594
02:01:40,930 --> 02:01:42,440
All right.
I love you guys.

2595
02:01:42,470 --> 02:01:43,610
Thank you very much.
Bye.

2596
02:01:43,611 --> 02:01:45,590
Bye.
Two hours once a week.

2597
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:50,330
I'm movie is two hours.
You could do a movie once a week.

2598
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:51,610
Yeah.
Yeah.

2599
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:56,770
You.
So bios thinking is how gay is this all 

2600
02:01:56,770 --> 02:01:57,470
going to look?
Looking back at it in 50 years.

2601
02:01:58,930 --> 02:02:00,860
Do we save this recording?
I know.

2602
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:03,590
I think it stays it to your page so 
people can go to your page,

2603
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:06,290
hit stop and see what it says.
I think stopped it.

2604
02:02:06,500 --> 02:02:07,840
Oh,
see,

2605
02:02:08,140 --> 02:02:09,410
this is stopped.
Wait,

2606
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:10,340
no,
you said it started.

2607
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,440
Stopped broadcast.
Hit Stop Record.

2608
02:02:13,610 --> 02:02:13,950
So yeah.
