00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,730
Hello,
freak bitches

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,090
call this patternicity the tendency to
find meaningful patterns in both

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:09,210
meaningful and meaningless noise,
and my thought experiment is imagine

4
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:10,800
you're a hominid on the plains of
Africa,

5
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:14,100
three and a half million years ago,
small brain Australopithecine and your

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,980
name is Lucy and you hear a rustle in
the grass.

7
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:19,500
Is that a dangerous Predator or is it
just the wind?

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,070
So if you assume that the rustle in the
grass is a dangerous Predator and it

9
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:25,080
turns out it's just the wind,
that's a type one error,

10
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,750
a false positive,
you thought a was connected to be but

11
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:30,750
but no harm you,
you just become skittish and conscious

12
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:32,700
or whatever.
But if you assume that the rustle in the

13
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:36,390
grass is just the wind and it turns out
it's a dangerous Predator,

14
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,060
your lunch,
you've just been given a Darwin award

15
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:41,730
for taking yourself out of the gene pool
early before reproducing.

16
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,780
So in other words,
it's better to just assume that all

17
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:49,170
things you think are connected,
all rustle in the grass are dangerous

18
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:52,350
predators and not the wind just in case.
And there's not.

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,080
There's not a big cost to pay for making
a type one error,

20
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:58,050
a false positive.
There is a higher cost for making a type

21
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,770
two error or false negative.
So we assume that this is the basis of

22
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:05,610
superstition and magical thinking.
We just assume that this is connected to

23
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:07,920
that you pull the slot and you do this,
you pull the slot machine,

24
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:11,550
you win or whatever,
and this is what skinner show back in

25
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:15,150
the fifties where you just randomly give
reinforcements to rats and pigeons and

26
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,640
whatever they were doing just before
they got rewarded.

27
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,670
They'll just repeat that behavior,
even if it's like twirling

28
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,360
counterclockwise twice or,
and that's the basis of superstition is

29
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,850
nothing wrong with their brains.

30
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:30,690
They're just trying to find causal
connections between events in the

31
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,780
environment and that's the basis of
survival.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,870
So all of us are subject to making those
connections,

33
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:40,020
um,
are more gullible than others.

34
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,130
Say,
are more skeptical,

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,120
but for the most part,
all of us can easily be fooled if it's

36
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,020
done right.
That's,

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:50,100
that's the beauty of good cons,
good scams is that anybody could fall

38
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:51,420
for them.
Even smart people.

39
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,660
And if anything,
smart people are more likely to believe

40
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:57,900
weird things in this sense that once
they believe it,

41
00:01:57,901 --> 00:02:01,170
they think they've drawn a connection.
They're better at rationalizing the

42
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,170
reasons why they believe,
then say less educated or less

43
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,290
intelligent people.
And so was people like Panacek will tell

44
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:10,260
you there's nothing better than an
audience of scientists at Mit.

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,990
Oh boy.
I can really fool them.

46
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,910
Uh,
because they think they're so smart.

47
00:02:14,911 --> 00:02:17,220
I can't be full to wow.
Okay.

48
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,900
He must be doing something really,
really super psychic because I'm super

49
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:22,734
smart.
But.

50
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:25,890
Well no,
because all of our sensory apparatus

51
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,200
works the same.
And magicians know how to manipulate

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,440
your gaze,
your attention,

53
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,770
whatever,
and had a fool.

54
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:32,120
You.

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,430
What made him think it was big foot
shit?

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,010
Because they
smell it.

57
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,160
Smell it.
Maybe the bear had fucking a bad fish or

58
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:48,020
something.
They can't even agree on what it eats.

59
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,840
There were so sure as shit.
They can't agree.

60
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,850
They can agree on what bigfoot eats.
I'm good.

61
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,790
Who the fuck discovered that big foot
shit?

62
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,550
We gotta find that dude.
I met that I met.

63
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:01,670
That dude found the shit.
I had a conversation with him too.

64
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,590
It's a nice guy.
He's a teacher in a school.

65
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,400
Where did he find school teacher in
Oregon?

66
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,430
Funding out in the woods.
He's like,

67
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,360
this got to be big bullshit.
I'm going to take it with me.

68
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,680
I would think big food with lay logs
like this big as my thigh.

69
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:22,000
Just giant.
Ever see an elephant?

70
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,310
Take Shit and you see his ass hole open
up and he'd go,

71
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,450
good Lord.

72
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,790
Just flopping out of there.
There's a giant asshole.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,530
That's what I imagined for pig foot.
Do you believe that there?

74
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,380
You know,
some people believe in bigfoot,

75
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,690
but they also believe in a different
kind of big foot.

76
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,890
It's like a different kind of like a
Christian church,

77
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,440
like a Lutheran.
They believe.

78
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,440
Yes.
We believe in bigfoot,

79
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:44,410
but we believe it's an interdimensional
beings.

80
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,130
I've heard that one.
What do you think the chances of that

81
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,930
being around?
Probably 100 percent.

82
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:58,250
Not just big flood.
I don't believe.

83
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,220
I believe it's real.
Okay.

84
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,300
I got to stop right here,
Bro.

85
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:02,620
I'm one eighth,
native American,

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,970
my grandmother's side,
and those are our people.

87
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,310
Our people have long known of the
existence of what we call the old Ma

88
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,610
with a bunch of different names for it.
The new name.

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,750
Every time I go up to Oregon or
Washington or do a seminar,

90
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:24,751
I asked the guys by show of hands who
believes in bigfoot and most of them do.

91
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,663
Yeah,
well,

92
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,670
most of them have heard stories,
you know,

93
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:33,670
I believed in it for the longest time
and I don't disbelieve in it today.

94
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,450
I don't disbelieve it,
but that's one you can make fun of.

95
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,920
But I found big foot.
I wouldn't be like,

96
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,480
oh,
I'd be like,

97
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,130
Oh shit,
that's real.

98
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,440
I definitely don't just believe in it
and you know what?

99
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,640
And I'll.
I'll just say it.

100
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,790
I think maybe he isn't or dimensional.
You know what I mean?

101
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,560
That's how.
That's my gut feeling.

102
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,530
It's ridiculous.
The things that are going on that are

103
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:59,320
getting covered up and nobody's talking
about like in the film,

104
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,330
I don't know if you saw that drug that
was made in the United States.

105
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:06,040
It was tainted with AIDS.
She was tainted with the Aids virus and

106
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:06,850
they said,
you know what,

107
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,650
well we can't lose this big batch of
drugs.

108
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,610
Let's send it to France.
What is.

109
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,690
How does.
I don't understand that though.

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,710
How does the AIDS virus get into that?
Sorry,

111
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,690
what is the AIDS virus?
You're talking about?

112
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:21,520
HIV.
I have no idea.

113
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,100
I have no idea,
but that's where the news report says

114
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:26,210
and say this.
Say that news report was all greening.

115
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:29,190
It was from 1985.
They might not know what the fuck they

116
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:32,070
were talking about now.
It would definitely was something that I

117
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,180
wanted was a head scratcher.
I actually have a guy,

118
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,990
there's a guy that works at it.
Marks Jim just got his phd and he was

119
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:41,320
going to go work for the company bear.
That was a company that sold.

120
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,610
They bear aspirin.
Everything.

121
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,100
That's a company that did it and I was.
One of the things he was.

122
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,020
He was talking about this like,
I don't know if I want to work for a

123
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:48,250
company like that.
Yeah.

124
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:51,490
We need to snopes that though.
Snopes that before you put it in the

125
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,480
documentary.
Actually,

126
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:53,260
actually,
yes,

127
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,930
we have a big team,
tastes tasted a few of those.

128
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,320
When we do these documentaries,
we have.

129
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,750
Look at this,
we have to fact check everything.

130
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,010
Make that a little larger please.
Here it goes.

131
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,610
Recently,
unearth documents show that the drug

132
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:11,120
company beer sold millions of dollars'
worth of injectable blood clotting

133
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,670
medicine.
Factor eight,

134
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:18,020
concentrate intended for haemophiliacs
to Asian Latin American in some European

135
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:21,740
countries in the mid 19 eighties,
although they knew it was tainted with

136
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,920
aids.
So yeah,

137
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,400
that's what I understand.
Like how something and aids go together.

138
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:28,620
That makes sense
for you.

139
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,080
This article is 10 years ago,
the company stopped selling the drug in

140
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,860
the United States in 1984,
but continue to sell it overseas for an

141
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,740
additional year.
The medicine was made using a combined.

142
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,603
Oh,
okay.

143
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:45,350
Plasma from large numbers of donors and
at the time there was no screening test

144
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:49,010
for eight for the aids virus,
so a tiny number of donors with AIDS

145
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:52,220
could inadvertently contaminate a large
batch.

146
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:56,450
Well,
they continue to sell the medicine

147
00:06:56,451 --> 00:07:00,710
overseas in an attempt to avoid being
left with a large stock of a drug that

148
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,510
was no longer marketable in the United
States.

149
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,880
I have been so obsessed with this lately
like this,

150
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:09,370
and I know that I have like probably
we've talked about this before,

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,730
I talk to people probably get sick of me
talking about it,

152
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:16,731
but this concept of stressing your body
stressing exercise,

153
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,870
most people think exercise is good
because the exercise itself is good.

154
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,160
No,
the exercise of this exact exercise

155
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:25,470
itself is not good.
It's actually very stressful on your

156
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:26,720
body.
Um,

157
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,090
what's good is the stress response.
The body.

158
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:35,330
We've got a hard wired genetic program
that is conserved in plants,

159
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,060
insects,
bacteria,

160
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,140
um,
you know,

161
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,640
primates,
humans,

162
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,520
you know,
we're,

163
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,840
we're all,
we all have this response to stress.

164
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,580
And that response is to try to survive.
I need know I need to stay alive,

165
00:07:50,581 --> 00:07:53,340
pass on my genes.
Obviously the stress response is much

166
00:07:53,341 --> 00:07:58,341
stronger younger when you're younger or
the earlier in life because your body

167
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,390
knows you're not old enough to reproduce
for whatever,

168
00:08:03,391 --> 00:08:04,560
you know,
hormones and things like that.

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,170
They're not being produced.
But um,

170
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:11,970
so the stress response,
which is like exercise causes stress,

171
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,680
thermal stress,
like heat cold,

172
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,660
and then there's all these compounds in
plants that are stressful to us that can

173
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:21,600
induce this,
but it's almost like the brain is

174
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,110
preparing for the next time it's going
to encounter stress.

175
00:08:25,111 --> 00:08:25,651
It's like,
okay,

176
00:08:25,651 --> 00:08:28,230
this is war.
I got to gather up the troops,

177
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,690
I gotta get this army.
We got to assemble this army because

178
00:08:30,691 --> 00:08:32,940
that stress is going to happen again.
I got to be ready for war.

179
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,590
So it Kinda makes sense that you're in,
you're going to have a very profound and

180
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,710
positive effect in your brain.
And also in other parts of the body.

181
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,110
I'm,
you know,

182
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,940
the exercise itself.
Um,

183
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,140
it's funny because a lot of people do it
to lose weight or to mostly to lose

184
00:08:49,141 --> 00:08:53,310
weight or you know,
become sexually attractive muscle mass,

185
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,340
which has other very important effects.

186
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,650
But people do it because they want to
look good,

187
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,610
and honestly a lot of.
There are a lot of people that say,

188
00:09:02,611 --> 00:09:04,410
well,
exercise doesn't really play an

189
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,170
important role in losing weight.
It's nutrition.

190
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,270
You know what the right,
but exercise has a very important role

191
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:14,271
and that role is to to cause your body
stress so that you activate all these

192
00:09:15,631 --> 00:09:19,110
really good and awesome jeans that are
helping you deal with stress.

193
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,840
And guess what?
Stress is happening right now.

194
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,110
Every time you breathe in oxygen,
your making stress,

195
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,290
you're,
you're generating byproducts that are

196
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:29,360
very dangerous.
So,

197
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:30,820
so exercise is good.
