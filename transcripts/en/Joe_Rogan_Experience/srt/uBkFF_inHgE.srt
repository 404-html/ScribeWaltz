1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,000
And it would go four,

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,103
three,

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:05,943
two,

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:06,813
one.

5
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,290
And we're alive.

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,710
You fucking handsome bastard.

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,420
Look at you.

8
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,400
Oh Shit.

9
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,430
What's going on man?

10
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,540
What's going on?

11
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,620
Um,

12
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,220
every,

13
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,461
well,

14
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:23,461
I've done this once before and
I've watched you throughout
the years and when I

15
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:27,760
come in here,

16
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,020
I get a little,

17
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:29,854
um,

18
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,700
nervous.

19
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,193
Why?

20
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,940
You're a guy who knows a lot about
everything and I don't know a lot of,

21
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,490
I don't know a lot about everything.

22
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,700
I know enough to make it seem like
I know a lot about everything.

23
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,250
Whatever you're doing,

24
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:48,870
it's,

25
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:50,920
you know more than I do.

26
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,660
Right?

27
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,000
Like,

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,550
like we were on your treadmill out

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:53,970
there.

30
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:54,450
Right?

31
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,410
And you go,

32
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:58,770
it's 13% that,

33
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,540
what did you say?

34
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,440
13% more difficult than regular running.

35
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,303
Okay.

36
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,470
I forgot the fact.

37
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,280
What you just said from
the time we walk in,

38
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,230
I lost it.

39
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:10,680
So I don't,

40
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,410
I don't have the retention

41
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,390
that I wish I had.

42
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,050
So you some Alpha brain it,

43
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,090
I need something.

44
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:18,983
Do we have any here?

45
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,850
Is that what I'm missing in my,

46
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,420
that and my Diet Alpha?

47
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,543
Uh,

48
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,810
what's interesting though is that
people will come up to me with shit that

49
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:29,310
happened just a few years ago.

50
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:29,671
And I'm like,

51
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,080
I don't remember that at all.

52
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,840
Like I think you have a certain
amount of room in your brain.

53
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,220
And a,

54
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,210
my brain is always deleting stuff that
it doesn't think it needs anymore.

55
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,740
And then shoving in new things.

56
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:42,270
Like sometimes someone will
tell me about something,

57
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:42,511
I'm like,

58
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,470
what are you talking about?

59
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,131
And they're like,

60
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:47,550
you don't remember there was the guy
with no arms who drove us around.

61
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:47,821
I went,

62
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:48,654
what?

63
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,340
And then I have to go.

64
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,070
Oh yeah.

65
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:54,060
It's like I find the
folder in my head and like,

66
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:54,211
oh,

67
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:54,630
there it is.

68
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,760
Yeah,

69
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:54,961
yeah,

70
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,500
yeah.

71
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,960
And then we went to the pool hall and Dah,

72
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:57,051
Dah,

73
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:57,180
Dah,

74
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,301
Dah,

75
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:57,900
Dah.

76
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,740
And then I'll remember.

77
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,700
Gotcha.

78
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,533
But if,

79
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,523
yeah,

80
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,980
it's just for whatever reason this,

81
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:05,814
uh,

82
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,050
I can only,

83
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,330
I only keep things that I'm interested in.

84
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,223
Gotcha.

85
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,920
Yeah.

86
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,900
I just wish I could retain a lot of
the things I either see or hear to then

87
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:17,760
recall it in a conversation.

88
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,451
You can,

89
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:21,540
but you got to write things down and
you got to like want to recall things.

90
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,320
Yeah,

91
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,101
that's a problem.

92
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:26,670
I don't do a lot of writing as far as
like a notepad or anything to just take

93
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,504
notes.

94
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,630
When you write your act,

95
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,760
you write it in your head or do you
write it on paper or it's all audio?

96
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,491
Just audio.

97
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:34,650
I'll go to the comedy store.

98
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:38,990
I record it and I listened to it
on the way home and then I'll go,

99
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,171
oh,

100
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:40,650
maybe I'll do this next time.

101
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:41,484
Maybe I'll do that.

102
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,930
I'll take that out and this out.

103
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,560
And then,

104
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:43,820
uh,

105
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,630
so there's no writing.

106
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:50,390
My Act is more recalling stories
than sitting in a room going on.

107
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:51,480
I think this is funny.

108
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,580
So that's kind of how I work.

109
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:54,414
But uh,

110
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:54,991
yeah,

111
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:57,210
the reason I say that to
start off is just like I,

112
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:02,220
I see you go down a lot of different
paths on the podcast and I often the gold

113
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:03,161
man,

114
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:04,600
if I was sitting in that chair,

115
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,550
could I add to the conversation?

116
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,800
And a lot of times it's,

117
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,490
no,

118
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,490
I can't kid just because
for whatever the reason I,

119
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:15,670
uh,

120
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,100
I just feel like I need
to be a little bit more,

121
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,610
um,

122
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,510
well-read.

123
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,273
How often you read?

124
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,500
Uh,

125
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,540
like I read the Goggins
Book and that fucking book.

126
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:25,960
Yeah.

127
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,490
And that dude had,

128
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:28,150
huh,

129
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,901
it's sad life.

130
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:30,640
But then on the flip side,

131
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,870
inspiring to,

132
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,450
you know,

133
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,440
a guy like myself were,

134
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:34,810
you know,

135
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm running,

136
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
I'm running say,

137
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,950
or I'm working out and I,

138
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,370
I thought of this guy,

139
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:39,670
go,

140
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,001
you know what,

141
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,270
let's,

142
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,650
let's put another mile into this.

143
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,791
So,

144
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,361
uh,

145
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:43,721
yeah,

146
00:03:43,721 --> 00:03:44,380
I mean,

147
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,750
I'm just now starting to get into a
little bit more books than I have in the

148
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,020
past because in the past,

149
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,341
to be honest with you,

150
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:52,270
I haven't really,

151
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,680
I haven't really read much.

152
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,740
I try to read a one new thing a week.

153
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,690
And the way I try to do it is,

154
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,110
uh,

155
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,531
I have,

156
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,364
uh,

157
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,000
uh,

158
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,590
I use a lot of audio books,

159
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,030
but I also read books.

160
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:07,510
So I go back and forth in between them
in between reading and audio books.

161
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:11,560
But I find for whatever reason I retained
more with audio books than I do with

162
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:12,040
reading.

163
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,700
I,

164
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,440
maybe it's my add or something like that.

165
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:17,230
Cause when I'm reading I kind
of have to back up sometimes.

166
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,890
Like I'll go through a whole paragraph
or I'm thinking about some other shit

167
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,290
while I'm reading and then I've got to go,

168
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,820
okay asshole backup,

169
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:25,870
reread that,

170
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
go over it again.

171
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:27,800
You know,

172
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,581
that's what I find.

173
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:28,691
I,

174
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:33,200
I my mind wanders like you're saying the
audio book definitely is better option

175
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,480
Austin up comedians have
scatter brains at least in some,

176
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,380
in some way.

177
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,090
All of us are a little fucked up.

178
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,120
I think we have to be,

179
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:42,900
I think,

180
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,890
I think that the mind works in a
weird way in a comedians had a,

181
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:50,130
I think it has to be a
little bit fragmented and uh,

182
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,280
thinking a lot of different things
at once in order to operate.

183
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,183
Uh,

184
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,320
I mean you're doing it on stage.

185
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:55,681
I think,

186
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:55,891
you know,

187
00:04:55,891 --> 00:04:56,610
you're doing,

188
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,970
you're doing your comedy and
I'm self evaluating going,

189
00:04:59,971 --> 00:05:01,470
is this working right now?

190
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,480
Should I go off into another bitch?

191
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:05,220
And I talk about my family.

192
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,110
I see they're liking family stuff.

193
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:07,760
So I think,

194
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,593
yeah,

195
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,060
that's what we're doing a,

196
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,710
when we're performing and then sometimes
I think that bleeds to everyday life.

197
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,311
Yeah,

198
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:15,144
for sure.

199
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,481
Yeah.

200
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,770
When you're doing a bit,

201
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,710
are you thinking about what you're like,

202
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,621
are you like,

203
00:05:19,621 --> 00:05:21,000
do you have a bid on deck?

204
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,520
Like while you were in
the middle of the bit,

205
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,490
do you let go from there?

206
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:26,290
I'm going to talk about the gym or the,

207
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,670
you know,

208
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,690
this or that.

209
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:28,730
Uh,

210
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,430
it's funny.

211
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,601
Uh,

212
00:05:29,601 --> 00:05:31,010
and I don't know if you go through this.

213
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,420
Do you ever go through,

214
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:33,351
well,

215
00:05:33,351 --> 00:05:33,891
first of all,

216
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:34,940
when you're doing comedy,

217
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,010
do you have a beginning,

218
00:05:37,011 --> 00:05:42,011
middle and end and you know where you're
going throughout that whole set or do

219
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:43,670
you in the moment going,

220
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:44,031
you know what,

221
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm going to do the bet amount that,

222
00:05:45,681 --> 00:05:45,921
that,

223
00:05:45,921 --> 00:05:46,160
uh,

224
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,060
or is it set?

225
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,580
It's both.

226
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,810
It depends when,

227
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,190
like right now,

228
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,581
uh,

229
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,010
I don't have a lot of material because,

230
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:54,280
uh,

231
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,560
my Netflix special came out in October,

232
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,480
so November,

233
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,480
December,

234
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,481
January,

235
00:05:59,481 --> 00:06:02,270
I've basically three
months worth of new shit,

236
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,150
which is about 40 minutes
of all told material.

237
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,280
And then I have 20 other
minutes that are in the,

238
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,320
they're in like the baking stage.

239
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:14,570
Like I'm not ready to take
them out of the oven there.

240
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,620
I fuck around with them.

241
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:18,320
I'll shove them in the
middle a bit some sometimes,

242
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,363
but they're not,

243
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,020
they're not 100% legit.

244
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,970
They need to be fleshed out.

245
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,300
But one of those became
like one of my best bits.

246
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,040
Now it's weird how that works.

247
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:32,150
Like sometimes you'll just find this one
part of it that makes it work and boom,

248
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,950
all of a sudden the bits turbocharged.

249
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:34,911
Um,

250
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,920
so because of that,

251
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,783
I usually,

252
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,150
I decide that day usually
what I'm going to open with.

253
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,430
And then,

254
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,263
um,

255
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:48,310
I leave the middle part up
to my imagination and then
I'll decide what I'm going

256
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:49,244
to close with.

257
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,680
But when I'm ready to
do a Netflix special,

258
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:53,330
I basically have it all mapped out.

259
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,090
I basically have a starting
point and I have an end point.

260
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,780
Yeah.

261
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,280
But even like when I'm filming,

262
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,490
I still fuck around and ad Lib cause
I don't think because every show I do,

263
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,010
I don't,

264
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:05,030
I don't have like,

265
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,750
I'm going to say it verbatim this way
every time I always fuck around because I

266
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:12,590
always feel like I could find a new
way that's better if I just stay loose.

267
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,390
And so even when I'm filming,

268
00:07:14,391 --> 00:07:17,630
I do it that way because I feel I
want this to be like a real show.

269
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,930
If it's a real show and
I always film for shows,

270
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,411
so I'm like,

271
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:22,460
if it's a real show,

272
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,900
I'll fuck around.

273
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,720
And I've,

274
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,850
I've been filming before,

275
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:28,280
I fuck around and I go down a dark
road and there's no one there.

276
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:28,491
I'm like,

277
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:28,800
all right,

278
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,633
turn around.

279
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,001
Thank God for that.

280
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:31,834
Yeah.

281
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,310
Yeah.

282
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:33,761
I think,

283
00:07:33,761 --> 00:07:35,320
I think that's the way to do it though,

284
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:40,120
to be kind of in the moment and go with
how you're feeling when you're filming

285
00:07:40,121 --> 00:07:43,330
something just because that's
the way you would be anyway.

286
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,420
But sometimes I've,

287
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,730
I've,

288
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,920
I've learned in the past
when I'm filming something,

289
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:48,671
I feel like,

290
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:48,971
man,

291
00:07:48,971 --> 00:07:53,260
I'd like to get everything that I want
out on this special and I don't want to

292
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:57,320
forget anything because there'd be
nights where I'm performing and I,

293
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,030
I,

294
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,960
I forgot a bit.

295
00:07:58,961 --> 00:07:59,740
I'm like,

296
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,320
I'll be searching in my head
for the bit and I'm like,

297
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,250
I know there's another
something that goes along this,

298
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:08,980
but then I just jump off it and go into,

299
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,670
uh,

300
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,900
another routine.

301
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:12,610
So for me,

302
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,060
I dunno,

303
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,040
I like to keep it different every night,

304
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,110
just try and play around.

305
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:17,381
And,

306
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:17,810
uh,

307
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:19,990
it's weird now that a Netflix special,

308
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,590
uh,

309
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,070
I just,

310
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,490
uh,

311
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,490
one came out and I don't
really subscribe to.

312
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,940
Um,

313
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,270
if,

314
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,290
if I have a Netflix special out
and you come to a live show,

315
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,730
you're going to see some of those bits
that I did in the Netflix special.

316
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,320
I don't like retire the,

317
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,333
the act.

318
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,870
I know some guys go,

319
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,141
okay,

320
00:08:41,141 --> 00:08:41,974
it's out there.

321
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,460
I'm not doing this on my live show myself.

322
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,840
I still like to do some of that
material cause I enjoy doing it.

323
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,680
And,

324
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,191
uh,

325
00:08:51,191 --> 00:08:52,600
I also have some new stuff,

326
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,090
so I kind of,

327
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:57,660
and I don't know how long that lasts.

328
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,620
I don't know.

329
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:58,990
Like,

330
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,150
I,

331
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,000
I know some,

332
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,930
some people were like,

333
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,381
oh,

334
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:03,270
I saw that on the Netflix.

335
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:07,380
Why am I going to pay to see it
live if I could see it at home?

336
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:12,381
But there's something about going out I
believe to a live show and seeing a live

337
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:13,861
performance.

338
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,550
There's different nuances that you
might see in a bit or an add on.

339
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:22,551
Like sometimes I add onto the joke that
my jokes are sometimes never finished,

340
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:24,750
so we keep adding on.

341
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:25,191
So,

342
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:25,920
um,

343
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,110
that's the way I've kind of
worked at my entire career.

344
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,011
Yeah.

345
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,520
Um,

346
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,110
Gaffigan does it that way.

347
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,850
Um,

348
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,683
uh,

349
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Brian Regan does it that way where guys
will call out bits like the w like if

350
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:40,140
you go to see gafcon and
he doesn't do hot pockets,

351
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:41,160
you're going to get fucking Matt.

352
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:42,300
That's this.

353
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,030
A lot of people like that
I retire my material,

354
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,541
but,

355
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:45,691
uh,

356
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:47,560
I have brought stuff out before.

357
00:09:47,561 --> 00:09:48,450
If people ask,

358
00:09:48,451 --> 00:09:48,661
like,

359
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:50,080
someone asked me to bring up,

360
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:50,790
uh,

361
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,340
explaining Kim Kardashians to
the aliens the other night.

362
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:55,410
And I was amazed that I could remember it,

363
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:56,810
but I remembered it a,

364
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,870
but for the most part,

365
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:01,380
I retire shit because
I feel like in my mind,

366
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,410
if I don't retire things I'm not going
to work on new things as much in the new

367
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,470
limit myself.

368
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,120
And then I always feel like my newest
bits are better than my older bits because

369
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,830
even though I've been
doing standup for 30 years,

370
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,020
I still think I get better at it.

371
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:21,760
I think it's a constant state of self
evaluation and self analysis and going

372
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,160
over the material and then realize,

373
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:25,321
you know,

374
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:29,820
you have enough good sets
and bad sets and great sets.

375
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:33,120
You have enough the kind of recognize the
characteristics of each one where they

376
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:33,954
go wrong,

377
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,160
and then you get better at having
less bad sets and even less good sets,

378
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,060
a more great sets.

379
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:39,870
And,

380
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,501
you know,

381
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:42,420
and I think that for me,

382
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:46,410
one big part of that
is constantly writing.

383
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,071
I write,

384
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:47,670
write,

385
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,331
I sit down at a,

386
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:48,571
right,

387
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:49,404
right.

388
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:49,801
And,

389
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,310
uh,

390
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:50,800
I write,

391
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,490
I have one hour every night after shows.

392
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,840
That's one big one.

393
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,920
I went during the day,

394
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,810
but the big one for me seems to be at
night when I come home from the store and

395
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:01,830
I'm jazzed up.

396
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,500
And also it's great too
because everyone's asleep.

397
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:09,150
It's just me and the dog
and I just fucking sit at
that desk and I'll just work

398
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:12,420
until my eyes start blinking and
I start getting really tired.

399
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,420
And some of my best shit ever come up
with is that way after shows cause I'm

400
00:11:17,731 --> 00:11:17,971
all,

401
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:21,930
I'm juiced up and then also have a
process of listening to the show.

402
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,370
I'm in the car.

403
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,503
Cause you know,

404
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,390
that's one of the coolest things about um,

405
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,310
Bluetooth audio that you get your phone,

406
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,470
you recorded on your phone and then in
the car home you can listen and you can

407
00:11:33,471 --> 00:11:33,710
go,

408
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,920
oh I fucked that up.

409
00:11:34,921 --> 00:11:36,510
Or Oh I should have done it this way.

410
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:38,580
Or maybe if I do that or you have an idea,

411
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,450
like I'll pause it.

412
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,710
Oh I got another idea and then I'll make
a new voice note and then I'll go home.

413
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,270
And I'll listen to it again.

414
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,200
I'll listen to my set again and I'll
pause it and start working on stuff.

415
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:53,220
And that's how I've been able to
expand all these bits pretty quickly.

416
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:53,820
Hmm.

417
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,631
That's interesting.

418
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:54,841
I,

419
00:11:54,841 --> 00:11:55,674
uh,

420
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:00,510
high find my best bits come out
of just living my life and um,

421
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:00,960
you know,

422
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,580
I have a daughter and we went to the
zoo and the nuances at the zoo that I

423
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:09,500
picked up on and I just go on either Tom,

424
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,160
I'll call my mother and I'll tell her a
story and that's Kinda my barometer of

425
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:16,710
whether or not this thing is going to
work on stage and then I'll go to the

426
00:12:16,711 --> 00:12:18,720
comedy store and kind
of flush it out there.

427
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,890
But uh,

428
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,521
yeah,

429
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:20,911
I mean,

430
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,420
I just never been the guy who writes.

431
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,140
Um,

432
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:25,973
I just,

433
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,630
I dunno.

434
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,740
Well you don't have to.

435
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,031
No,

436
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,211
I,

437
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:28,591
yeah,

438
00:12:28,591 --> 00:12:29,361
it works for you.

439
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:30,860
There's a lot of guys
don't do it that way.

440
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,060
Bill Bird doesn't do it that way.

441
00:12:32,061 --> 00:12:32,990
He's one of the best ever.

442
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,680
Yeah.

443
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,880
A lot of guys who just don't,

444
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:35,650
right.

445
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,080
Um,

446
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,501
for me,

447
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:40,280
I feel like it's all about how much
time and energy I put on things.

448
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,200
And if I put more time and energy,

449
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:42,870
you know,

450
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:45,140
just working on my act
because I'm writing,

451
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,220
then it's going to be better.

452
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,570
That's just how I look at it.

453
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,780
Yeah.

454
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,410
Um,

455
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:49,591
yeah,

456
00:12:49,591 --> 00:12:54,480
everybody's got their own process and
I'm fascinated to hear like guys like

457
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:55,051
yourself,

458
00:12:55,051 --> 00:12:56,800
if Seinfeld's and other guy that a,

459
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,620
every word is planned out

460
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,850
and you could hear it with him too.

461
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,763
You really hear it.

462
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,570
His Act is like a scalpel,

463
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:03,841
you know,

464
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:04,440
it was just,

465
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,590
he's slicing the perfect slice and he's,

466
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,100
he's,

467
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,200
he knows exactly how does that,

468
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,610
he's got perfect timing.

469
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,070
He's got his use of words is,

470
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:14,521
you know,

471
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:15,600
whether or not you,

472
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:16,913
you know,

473
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,500
any comic can appreciate that any comic
can appreciate the way he does that.

474
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,071
You know,

475
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,230
there's a lot of guys who are
like that who just have that.

476
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,730
Did you ever watch Jenny at all?

477
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,330
I have and uh,

478
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:28,840
you know,

479
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,250
his timing I think was,

480
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,570
I think timing in comedy is something,

481
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,490
a bit of a lost art.

482
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:41,610
I don't think a lot of comedians are
really taking to timing like they have in

483
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:47,830
the past and I don't know if there
are scared of the silence because,

484
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,110
because a lot of timing is silent and a
lot of guys and women tend to not relish

485
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:57,580
in those moments of silence
where sometimes it's,

486
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,960
it's comedy gold.

487
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,260
A lot of people run through the material
and for me as an audience member,

488
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:08,800
I like someone who kind of gives
you as an audience member a little,

489
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,570
a little beat or maybe maybe some time
to kind of marinate in the joke a little

490
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:16,060
bit opposed to kind of
blowing through the material.

491
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,090
Don't you feel that like when you're
in a large audience that's even more

492
00:14:20,091 --> 00:14:25,091
critical because you have like there's
thousands of people and it seems like a

493
00:14:25,881 --> 00:14:30,110
big pause like in between punchlines
or you give a person a chance,

494
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,140
give this whole group of people a chance
to think about how ridiculous what you

495
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:33,880
just said was,

496
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,330
yeah,

497
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,630
it enhances it.

498
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,791
Oh absolutely.

499
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,031
I mean,

500
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:39,130
especially like you said
in a large audience,

501
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,400
which is even more fearful for a comedian
to let the joke breathe has God knows,

502
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,541
you know,

503
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:50,380
if you got a thousand people
and then you got 20,000 people,

504
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:53,480
I mean know 19 more thousand people

505
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,800
could yell or scream or say something.

506
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:59,090
So anything can go wrong.

507
00:14:59,091 --> 00:14:59,390
Yeah.

508
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,740
But man to stop and just let that
joke breathe a little bit and just,

509
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,260
and then maybe have it perculate there's
times where I'm on stage in and out

510
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:13,270
goal a little bit longer than I thought
I was going to go without talking,

511
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:16,080
but maybe give it like a
facial expression or whatnot,

512
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,100
just to see if I could eat out
another crescendo of laughter and um,

513
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,360
those are the moments I really relish
in because sometimes the silence is even

514
00:15:26,361 --> 00:15:27,500
better than saying anything.

515
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,401
Yeah.

516
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:31,670
And you also realize that you're
not like rushing anything.

517
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,680
You got Ahold of it.

518
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,341
Yeah.

519
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:35,510
At least for my self,

520
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,280
my act is more like a,

521
00:15:37,281 --> 00:15:38,114
um,

522
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,380
it needs to,

523
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,540
it needs to kind of sit.

524
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:46,190
I don't really do well on like
five minute talk shows doing like,

525
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,053
you know,

526
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,700
doing a four and a half
minutes set on Fallon.

527
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,100
I need to like go out there.

528
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:52,320
I did,

529
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,390
it takes me two minutes to t to get warm.

530
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,171
You know what I'm saying?

531
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:57,501
Like,

532
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:58,260
uh,

533
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,760
I to get into a joke right
away and it had to me,

534
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,061
I just,

535
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:02,930
I need time.

536
00:16:02,931 --> 00:16:03,231
I need,

537
00:16:03,231 --> 00:16:04,610
I need to let it breathe.

538
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,061
Yeah,

539
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:05,271
no,

540
00:16:05,271 --> 00:16:06,081
I feel the same way.

541
00:16:06,081 --> 00:16:06,380
I,

542
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,010
I've always felt those late night
talk show sets are so strange.

543
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,061
Not only that,

544
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:13,490
but you're basically opening for yourself.

545
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:13,910
I mean,

546
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,090
cause there's no one has done
standup yet except a monologue.

547
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,570
Just kind of stand up a kind of knob
because it's all like what's happening

548
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:23,720
today and everybody knows
that it's been written.

549
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:24,031
It's,

550
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:24,864
it's weird.

551
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,220
Yeah.

552
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,490
And then you go out and do a standup set
and oftentimes you see guys go out and

553
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:30,380
they'll do a stand up set and
they don't even have a microphone.

554
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,161
You know,

555
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,630
they're doing a standup
set and they don't know

556
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,890
fuck to do with their hands.

557
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,970
You know,

558
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,750
it's hard.

559
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,390
The first time I did a standup set on,

560
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:38,961
uh,

561
00:16:38,961 --> 00:16:39,794
on TV.

562
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:40,401
I said,

563
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:41,840
I need the microphone.

564
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,290
Yeah.

565
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,700
I can't go out there.

566
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,200
I've been doing comedy for what,

567
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,330
12 years it had been,

568
00:16:47,331 --> 00:16:48,680
and then I got like a Leno.

569
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,200
I need a physical microphone.

570
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,131
I'm used to this.

571
00:16:52,131 --> 00:16:52,340
I don't,

572
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,050
I'm not going to go out
there all of a sudden now.

573
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:54,860
And uh,

574
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,311
like you said,

575
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:56,360
what am I going to with my hands?

576
00:16:56,361 --> 00:16:56,930
Yeah.

577
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,471
So,

578
00:16:57,471 --> 00:16:58,010
uh,

579
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,560
every time I do a late night
said I need a microphone.

580
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,090
How well do you still do those?

581
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,381
Um,

582
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:04,011
no,

583
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:04,840
not any more.

584
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,040
I,

585
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,140
I like to do,

586
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:07,910
it's a comedy on the couch now.

587
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,481
You know,

588
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:08,701
it's,

589
00:17:08,701 --> 00:17:12,790
it's like you go on Fallon or what have
you and it's all premeditated burrs.

590
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,700
The master at that,

591
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,410
the master,

592
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:19,220
he's the best at sitting down there and
saying something fucked up and they just

593
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:19,401
like,

594
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:20,234
you know,

595
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:21,763
he's good.

596
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:25,100
He's just got a great way
of handling the couch.

597
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,640
Yeah.

598
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:30,140
He makes it sound like just two guys
talking and then there's cameras filming

599
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:30,290
it.

600
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,123
Yeah.

601
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,290
Sometimes it could look like,

602
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,741
oh,

603
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:34,281
okay.

604
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,570
You ask the question.

605
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:36,440
I give the answer,

606
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:37,400
but for whatever the reason,

607
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:38,600
it's so natural for him.

608
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,670
It's like this guy looks
like he's talking in a,

609
00:17:40,671 --> 00:17:41,840
at a diner.

610
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:43,070
Exactly.

611
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,460
Yeah.

612
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:43,731
No,

613
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:44,091
he's,

614
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:44,360
uh,

615
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,730
he's mastered the art
of not giving a fuck.

616
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,620
He's very comfortable.

617
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:49,201
And if you,

618
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:49,511
you know,

619
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:49,740
like,

620
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,190
but that's

621
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,200
who we is all day.

622
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,780
You know,

623
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,490
he just ramps it up a couple of
extra clicks when he goes on stage.

624
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,230
That's when you're hanging out with them.

625
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:58,950
That's bird.

626
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,161
Yeah.

627
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,930
It's not a far departure from now,

628
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,800
from what we're seeing.

629
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:02,831
Scott,

630
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,410
one thing down to that guy does
not fuck with social media.

631
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:06,340
He's not doing nothing.

632
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:06,791
Oh,

633
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:07,630
he's not even on it.

634
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:07,901
I mean,

635
00:18:07,901 --> 00:18:08,290
he,

636
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,011
he like Kinda,

637
00:18:09,011 --> 00:18:10,270
I guess he posts stuff.

638
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:10,811
Well,

639
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:11,340
you know,

640
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,010
I follow them on Instagram and every
once in a while I'll see something.

641
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:15,280
Yeah.

642
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,000
Um,

643
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,833
which,

644
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:17,741
you know,

645
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:18,521
for me,

646
00:18:18,521 --> 00:18:21,640
I've kind of weaned off the
social media a little bit.

647
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,300
Um,

648
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,380
I know a lot of guys live on it
and they take you into their lives.

649
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:26,921
And here's,

650
00:18:26,921 --> 00:18:27,480
you know,

651
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,020
here I follow Bert Kreischer.

652
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,550
So every,

653
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm wondering if the people
around Bert Kreischer are,

654
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,840
are going to him.

655
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,300
All right,

656
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:38,550
Burt,

657
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,610
you want to lose the phone?

658
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:39,941
You know,

659
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:40,541
like we're all,

660
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,620
we're having dinner here.

661
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,040
Oh yeah.

662
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,640
Um,

663
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,780
because man,

664
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:47,950
he really gives you a bird's eye
view into not only his family life,

665
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,830
but he's on a ski lift and he's got the,

666
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:51,041
you know,

667
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,480
skis and this and that.

668
00:18:52,481 --> 00:18:53,314
So,

669
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,880
which I appreciate.

670
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,020
It's just for me.

671
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,161
I don't know.

672
00:18:57,161 --> 00:19:00,400
Is there some little sense of privacy?

673
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:00,880
Uh,

674
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,280
every once in a while births defense.

675
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,430
What Bert did was he had a legit TV gig.

676
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,090
He was doing birth the conqueror
and what was the other one?

677
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,880
The other one where he's
traveling around chip flip,

678
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,743
chip flip.

679
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,710
And uh,

680
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:15,981
you know,

681
00:19:15,981 --> 00:19:17,060
he's doing really well,

682
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,210
but he was gone for
long stretches of time.

683
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,640
Oh,

684
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,890
away from his family.

685
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:23,500
And he wasn't getting to do much stand up.

686
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,150
And he and I had a conversation
about it and I said,

687
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:26,660
Stu,

688
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:26,931
I go,

689
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:30,680
you're too funny to be just
working for a television show.

690
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,510
Anybody can do a television show,

691
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,730
but not everybody could do stand
up the way you did stand up.

692
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,193
And um,

693
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,500
he somewhere along the line decided,

694
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:39,861
all right,

695
00:19:39,861 --> 00:19:41,000
fuck this TV shit.

696
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:41,661
And uh,

697
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm just gonna just gonna
concentrate on standup.

698
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,170
And a big part of that with social media,

699
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,780
so big part of it for him was,

700
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,291
you know,

701
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:53,291
every year we have this a sober October
crew where it's already Thompson for me

702
00:19:53,451 --> 00:19:56,570
and Bert and we do a one month challenge.

703
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,040
Like it was last year was
a fitness challenge and
before that it was a hot yoga

704
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,360
challenge and before that,

705
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,110
um,

706
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,220
they had to lose weight.

707
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,090
So that's when we,

708
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,350
we've only done it twice,

709
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,570
but it's a big thing.

710
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
Social Media Wise,

711
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,330
a bunch of people hop on board with it,

712
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,530
a bunch of people join in and they
take a month off booze and to,

713
00:20:15,531 --> 00:20:16,130
and,

714
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,850
and for Bert,

715
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:18,500
that's fucking hard.

716
00:20:18,501 --> 00:20:21,050
That guy goes hard in
the paint with the booze.

717
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,610
So for him that,

718
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,140
that the sober October stuff and the
weight loss stuff propelled his career.

719
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,320
I mean everything started taking off the
Netflix special started taking off it.

720
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,360
Standup shows are sold out everywhere.

721
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,541
He,

722
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:33,374
people know him,

723
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,510
they know he takes off his
shirt when he goes on stage.

724
00:20:35,511 --> 00:20:36,900
Now it's a totally different thing.

725
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:41,210
So I get it with him because that's what
brought him to the dance social media.

726
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,021
Absolutely.

727
00:20:42,021 --> 00:20:43,460
And that guys figured it out.

728
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,580
I'm just using Burt as an example of a
guy who's social media a ton and it's

729
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:54,091
figured out a way to weave that into
his kind of aura and what he does

730
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,220
professionally.

731
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,720
But for me,

732
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,770
I feel,

733
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,210
I get a little,

734
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,190
I feel like everything I do on
social media has to be funny.

735
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,780
Like if I do a post,

736
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:09,370
I feel like it has to be funny.

737
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:09,550
I,

738
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,550
I feel a little bit intimidated to put
something out that's just me doing x,

739
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:16,841
y,

740
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,674
and Z.

741
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,560
And that's where I feel
I fail at social media.

742
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,570
And I feel like I've
kind of weaned off it.

743
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,270
And sometimes I look at my
Instagram or my Twitter,

744
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:26,140
it looks like a,

745
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:26,974
um,

746
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm going to be here,

747
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:29,050
I'm going to be here.

748
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:30,040
Here's my shows.

749
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:33,220
There's no real kind of
substance to it at all.

750
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,541
Yeah,

751
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,520
that bothers some people,

752
00:21:34,521 --> 00:21:36,050
but the good thing is,

753
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,460
I mean I get what people go,

754
00:21:37,461 --> 00:21:37,641
Oh,

755
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:38,900
you do is promote your shows.

756
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,501
Yeah,

757
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:40,850
but I'm promoted my shows,

758
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,061
you know,

759
00:21:41,061 --> 00:21:41,790
this is where I am.

760
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,800
She liked my shows.

761
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:43,700
That's where I'm going to be.

762
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,563
I get it,

763
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,340
but I see what you're saying as a comic
because our reach should fear said that

764
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:49,521
too,

765
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,160
like he doesn't want to put anything on
Instagram or Twitter unless it's funny

766
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,410
now that that's what he
concentrates on and he tries,

767
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,800
he was off even saying that he was going
to mock people that are comedians that

768
00:21:57,801 --> 00:21:58,790
say things that aren't funny.

769
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,601
I'm like,

770
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:01,100
well then you're going to be mocking me.

771
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:02,420
I say a lot of shit that's not funny.

772
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:02,661
He's like,

773
00:22:02,661 --> 00:22:02,811
yeah,

774
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:03,740
but you do other things.

775
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,710
Which is weird because
I do do other things,

776
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:11,060
whether it's podcasting all the
time or doing the UFC commentary,

777
00:22:11,061 --> 00:22:11,660
like,

778
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:11,841
you know,

779
00:22:11,841 --> 00:22:12,200
if I'm,

780
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,420
if I watch some fights and
I started posting about MMA,

781
00:22:14,421 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm not trying to be funny and
it's just this is what it is.

782
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,041
Well,

783
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:18,270
yeah,

784
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,581
you're,

785
00:22:18,581 --> 00:22:20,020
you're living in a lot
of different worlds,

786
00:22:20,021 --> 00:22:20,400
but,

787
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,820
and,

788
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,780
and I look at your Instagram,

789
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:23,740
you're cooking meat,

790
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,160
right?

791
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,993
Yeah.

792
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,441
But for me,

793
00:22:26,441 --> 00:22:27,011
I'm thinking,

794
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,590
how the hell does he get the meat?

795
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,340
Uh,

796
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,061
like from,

797
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:32,440
from top to bottom,

798
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,940
like medium rare throughout,

799
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,221
you know,

800
00:22:34,221 --> 00:22:35,530
like that's for me,

801
00:22:35,531 --> 00:22:36,364
that's more of a

802
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:38,281
shoe.

803
00:22:38,281 --> 00:22:39,320
Sebastian,

804
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,430
I could teach you,

805
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,690
you know what the key is?

806
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,520
Cooking it slowly.

807
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:44,680
Okay.

808
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,370
So you got like this grill or whatever.

809
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,550
Yeah,

810
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,510
it's a pellet grill.

811
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,820
Pellet grill is a little bit,

812
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,120
if it gets my meat the way Jimmy,

813
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,720
well,

814
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,620
I'll have them send you 100%.

815
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,280
Perfect.

816
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,113
Um,

817
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,103
but yeah,

818
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,280
he's the only one of those are,

819
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,270
do you know how they work?

820
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:01,710
No.

821
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:01,821
Oh,

822
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:02,950
it's fucking fantastic.

823
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:03,161
It's,

824
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:03,960
it's uh,

825
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,490
the like say if someone wants
to make a desk like this,

826
00:23:06,491 --> 00:23:07,780
I had a hardwood like this oak,

827
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,190
the saw dust,

828
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,510
they take the saw dust from,

829
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,340
from saw mills and they compress it and
they make these little tiny pellets.

830
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,350
And so there's no chemicals,

831
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:17,861
no nothing.

832
00:23:17,861 --> 00:23:18,694
It's just wood.

833
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:19,681
And then the,

834
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:22,960
the way a pellet grill works is a bunch
of really good companies that make,

835
00:23:22,961 --> 00:23:23,160
um,

836
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:23,620
uh,

837
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,490
I use a trigger,

838
00:23:24,491 --> 00:23:26,380
but I've used a Yoder
that's a great one too.

839
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:27,430
And Green Mountain grills,

840
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:28,264
that's a great one.

841
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,021
This,

842
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:29,201
uh,

843
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:29,801
they have,

844
00:23:29,801 --> 00:23:30,760
they all work the same way.

845
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,920
They have a heating
element and a worm drive.

846
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:37,510
So you have this big bucket of these
pellets and then the worm drive feeds the

847
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:41,380
pellets into this heating element and
the heating element makes the pellets

848
00:23:41,381 --> 00:23:42,214
catch fire.

849
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,510
So once they catch fire,

850
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:48,530
it's a matter of how much pellets
and how much fan to keep the tea.

851
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,610
That's what it looks like up there.

852
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,570
So then let's see,

853
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,480
look at this job.

854
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:52,730
Yeah,

855
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,040
no,

856
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,980
I'm looking at this and I'm like,

857
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,210
that looks like a,

858
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,720
that looks like a lot of work.

859
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,501
First of all,

860
00:23:58,501 --> 00:23:59,370
you've got to get a pet,

861
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,870
a side pellet,

862
00:24:00,871 --> 00:24:02,310
the catchall,

863
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,821
but it's there.

864
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:03,660
It comes with the whole thing,

865
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,550
but then you've got to go by the pellets.

866
00:24:05,551 --> 00:24:06,384
It sees,

867
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,860
I'll have it delivered to you.

868
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,121
I'll have it delivered.

869
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:12,570
I'm trying to get more people to cook
like this because it's just wood and fire.

870
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,560
It's the best.

871
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:14,550
There's no chemicals,

872
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:15,291
there's no bullshit,

873
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:16,290
no lighter fluid,

874
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,310
no gas,

875
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,001
no nothing.

876
00:24:18,001 --> 00:24:19,500
So your NDA or me fire,

877
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,530
your entire meet process is on this
grill except the end at the end.

878
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,940
This is a different grill than I have
because this one has a thing on the side.

879
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:28,691
If you see the thing on the,

880
00:24:28,691 --> 00:24:32,200
on the right hand side is
like a like that looks like a,

881
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,370
like a direct flame thing.

882
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:35,680
It looks like it's got gas as well.

883
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:36,430
Right.

884
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,990
The one that I have doesn't have that,

885
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:39,490
but at the end I,

886
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,640
I sear it at the very end
on a cast iron frying pan.

887
00:24:42,641 --> 00:24:46,420
So I cook it from between
225 to 275 degrees,

888
00:24:46,421 --> 00:24:50,530
which is pretty low and I'll kick it
until it hits an internal temperature,

889
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,880
depending on what I'm cooking.

890
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,700
Some are around one 22 the maximum,

891
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,600
like one 30 ish.

892
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,530
Then I take it out and then I have
a cast iron frying pan is hot as a

893
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:04,531
motherfucker and I use either a beef
tallow or grass fed butter and then I see

894
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:09,660
her that shit out of that with some
garlic and I throw some time in there and

895
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:14,440
fork and flip it over and get that good
seer and then I let it sit for a minimum

896
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:15,820
of 10 minutes and think,

897
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,900
just realized that model.

898
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,350
Oh,

899
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:21,160
okay.

900
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:21,631
So you're,

901
00:25:21,631 --> 00:25:23,380
you're me is unbelievable.

902
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:26,730
I've seen it on the care
when you say that Instagram.

903
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,420
So I do something similar,

904
00:25:28,421 --> 00:25:29,740
but I do it in the oven.

905
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,603
I don't do it.

906
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,180
That'll work.

907
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,620
I do a slow cook in the
oven and then I take it out.

908
00:25:33,621 --> 00:25:36,500
I let it rest for I think 15
minutes and then I do a sear job,

909
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,310
but I'm always looking for better ways to,

910
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,233
to cook meat.

911
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,220
And uh,

912
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:42,550
if,

913
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,740
if you're saying that this Palette thing,

914
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:45,730
uh,

915
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,170
does it add any flavor?

916
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:50,920
And that's what's good about it
because it's smokey hardwood.

917
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,460
Gotcha.

918
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:51,851
So you're,

919
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:52,631
it's all smoke.

920
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:53,470
You lift the thing up,

921
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:54,850
smokes coming out of it and everything.

922
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:57,100
It's a nice aromatic,

923
00:25:57,101 --> 00:25:57,820
smart,

924
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,480
that's what I know.

925
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,590
It's like cherry smoke or oak or you know,

926
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,370
Hickory or maple,

927
00:26:03,371 --> 00:26:04,840
all these different hardwoods.

928
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,250
You could choose a bunch of different.

929
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:06,821
Perfect.

930
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:07,001
Okay.

931
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:08,000
So you're not getting that in the,

932
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,450
in the oven I need,

933
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,060
no,

934
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,893
it's different.

935
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,330
So a setting on a trigger called
super smoke where you hit it,

936
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:15,080
it goes to,

937
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,610
it can't be over 225,

938
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:17,630
but that's what I like anyway.

939
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,250
And you put it on two 25 and it just
constantly fans hard and pushes all this

940
00:26:22,251 --> 00:26:22,641
smoke.

941
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:26,240
So it just gets his deep rich
smoky flavor in the meat.

942
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:29,510
Molly's nice.

943
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,270
But a,

944
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,711
I like,

945
00:26:30,711 --> 00:26:31,760
if you're not into that too.

946
00:26:31,761 --> 00:26:33,710
I like irregular Weber Grill.

947
00:26:33,711 --> 00:26:36,730
Like one of those little
fucking Weber a that you know,

948
00:26:36,731 --> 00:26:38,150
the little Hibachi.

949
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,510
Yeah.

950
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,370
What are those things called that you get?

951
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,630
What would you call them?

952
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:42,680
They'll like a drum.

953
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:43,770
Looks like a half a drum.

954
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,040
Like

955
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,690
a barrel fucking thing.

956
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:46,620
Yeah.

957
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,020
But what are the,

958
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,440
those,

959
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,990
those way it looks like it looks like a,

960
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,260
like a black uh,

961
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:50,520
yeah,

962
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,210
the black ones.

963
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:51,630
Yeah.

964
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,550
Nothing like steal those.

965
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:55,350
What I like those with,

966
00:26:55,351 --> 00:26:55,680
uh,

967
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,910
just lump charcoal.

968
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,710
That puts a nice flavor on it too.

969
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:01,800
The key is don't fuck
around with the chemicals.

970
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,230
When you started using
lighter fluid and shit,

971
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:04,840
that,

972
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,161
that,

973
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:07,810
that adds weird tastes to your food.

974
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah.

975
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,070
And even if you buy that lump charcoal,

976
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:14,770
those charcoal briquettes rather
the charcoal briquettes there's,

977
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,370
there's something in them
that makes them that shape.

978
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,361
They have to,

979
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:19,051
and then they,

980
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:19,870
they know they,

981
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,060
they lay light fast.

982
00:27:21,061 --> 00:27:21,181
Yeah.

983
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,040
Cause there's fucking gasoline in them.

984
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:23,910
Like,

985
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:28,080
but lump charcoal meaning they just take
hardwood and then they burn that shit

986
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:29,010
down to,

987
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:29,940
you know,

988
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,190
that clunky looking lump charcoal.

989
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,420
Just get that stuff and then take some
newspaper and rolled a newspaper up.

990
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,670
And one of those you ever
used one of those little uh,

991
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,773
um,

992
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,130
those chimneys?

993
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,090
Do you know what those things are?

994
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,953
Yeah,

995
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
it's a barbecue chimney.

996
00:27:44,401 --> 00:27:45,234
It's like a,

997
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,950
you pour the charcoal in this tube and
at the bottom of the tube you take like

998
00:27:49,951 --> 00:27:53,730
pieces of paper and your crump alarm
up balls and then you like the balls on

999
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:57,960
fire and the fire rises up from the
paper to the charcoal and it likes to

1000
00:27:57,961 --> 00:27:58,860
charcoal on fire.

1001
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,770
Then you dump the charcoal
out into the grill and that,

1002
00:28:01,771 --> 00:28:03,390
that puts a nice flavor on it too.

1003
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:03,960
That's just a,

1004
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,600
but it's again,

1005
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,150
same kind of feeling.

1006
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,500
It's like would just,

1007
00:28:07,501 --> 00:28:09,690
this would flavor on the meat.

1008
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,613
It's nice.

1009
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,713
Yeah.

1010
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:13,523
Yeah,

1011
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:13,921
yeah.

1012
00:28:13,921 --> 00:28:14,041
I'm,

1013
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:14,191
I'm,

1014
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,390
I'm a big fan of cooking.

1015
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:16,224
I love it.

1016
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,390
I went to this restaurant
the other night to

1017
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,620
pls on it.

1018
00:28:19,621 --> 00:28:20,341
On Your Instagram.

1019
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:21,174
Good meat.

1020
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:26,630
I ate a 380 day dry age steak cheese.

1021
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,571
This guy,

1022
00:28:27,571 --> 00:28:28,710
I'm going to get him on here.

1023
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,641
He's a chef.

1024
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:33,190
His name is Adam Perry Lang and he's
the guy who runs the place and uh,

1025
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:35,430
I've never even heard of someone
doing something like that.

1026
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:39,540
Like you hear like dry
age steak is like 30 days,

1027
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,583
right?

1028
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:41,340
He's,

1029
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,180
he's taken it.

1030
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,140
It's in some weird,

1031
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,960
crazy place where he's got these,

1032
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,560
these stakes in his gigantic like walk
in freezer era where everything is dry

1033
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:53,190
aging.

1034
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,090
They have certain microbes they put
in the air and then they have fans.

1035
00:28:57,150 --> 00:28:57,781
So it's like,

1036
00:28:57,781 --> 00:29:02,340
it's a certain type of bacteria that
they want that covers over the meet a

1037
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,660
certain type of mold.

1038
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:04,320
Oh Wow.

1039
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,450
So delivers this very strange taste.

1040
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:09,060
It's not like any steak that
I've ever had in my life.

1041
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:10,260
It's very weird.

1042
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,520
It's delicious.

1043
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,533
That's what it looks like.

1044
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,810
Wow.

1045
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,051
Yeah.

1046
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:17,620
That's 380 day dry age steak.

1047
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,720
It's,

1048
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:18,900
see,

1049
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,220
it's,

1050
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,160
he says it smells like fall gras.

1051
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,941
It does.

1052
00:29:21,941 --> 00:29:22,111
It's,

1053
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:23,410
it smells very strange.

1054
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,340
It's very different.

1055
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,170
And I've heard about this place,

1056
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:26,700
um,

1057
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,640
so phenomenal.

1058
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,960
And I haven't been there yet.

1059
00:29:28,961 --> 00:29:29,830
Is this in Hollywood?

1060
00:29:29,831 --> 00:29:30,011
Right.

1061
00:29:30,011 --> 00:29:30,490
Thank you.

1062
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,730
We'll go together after the show.

1063
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:34,630
I'm ready to go home.

1064
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,321
It's a,

1065
00:29:35,321 --> 00:29:36,910
it's on vine in Hollywood,

1066
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,171
right?

1067
00:29:37,171 --> 00:29:37,840
Yeah.

1068
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,680
It's phenomenal.

1069
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:39,570
But it's,

1070
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,690
it's not for everybody,

1071
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:41,591
like flipped.

1072
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,970
Like my wife is not into it.

1073
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,620
She likes regular steak.

1074
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,221
She's not,

1075
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:45,701
it's like,

1076
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:46,090
she's like,

1077
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:46,420
ah,

1078
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,253
yeah.

1079
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,010
It's,

1080
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:48,310
it's,

1081
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,600
it's strong flavor.

1082
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,950
It's a different flavor.

1083
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:53,260
Like it doesn't taste like
anything you've ever had before.

1084
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:55,750
Like it doesn't taste like
venison doesn't taste like bison.

1085
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,290
It doesn't take place like a robot that
you'd get from Fleming's or something

1086
00:29:59,291 --> 00:29:59,680
like that.

1087
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,251
It tastes very,

1088
00:30:00,251 --> 00:30:00,970
very different.

1089
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,091
Oh,

1090
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:01,900
I love full graph.

1091
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,621
It tastes like that.

1092
00:30:02,621 --> 00:30:04,090
Then I'm to sort of does,

1093
00:30:04,091 --> 00:30:04,661
but not really.

1094
00:30:04,661 --> 00:30:06,200
It smells like fall gras.

1095
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,640
It's,

1096
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,260
it tastes like itself.

1097
00:30:08,261 --> 00:30:09,910
It doesn't taste like
anything I've ever had,

1098
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,923
but it's uh,

1099
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,381
you know,

1100
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:12,214
that's when you're,

1101
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,350
you're fucking geeking out hard.

1102
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,020
There's a shell that I
binge watch on Youtube.

1103
00:30:17,021 --> 00:30:18,010
It's called the meat show.

1104
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,563
Um,

1105
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:19,830
uh,

1106
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,920
I think the youtube channels called eater
and then the show is called the meat

1107
00:30:23,921 --> 00:30:24,311
show.

1108
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:29,311
And this guy just travels around going
to all these different super high end

1109
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:33,580
restaurants that serve steak and trying
to see what their preparation is and

1110
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,750
what they do differently.

1111
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,960
And you could fucking
lose your mind with that.

1112
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:38,431
Yeah.

1113
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:39,860
You could go down a deep dark hole,

1114
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,783
man.

1115
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,671
Hey Man,

1116
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:41,791
I'm,

1117
00:30:41,791 --> 00:30:42,041
I'm,

1118
00:30:42,041 --> 00:30:43,110
I'm willing to try anything.

1119
00:30:43,111 --> 00:30:43,191
I'm,

1120
00:30:43,191 --> 00:30:46,440
I'm more like a experimental as
far as when it comes to food.

1121
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:46,891
My wife,

1122
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:47,540
not so much.

1123
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,590
He's very picky.

1124
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,970
Do you use recipes,

1125
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,870
use cookbooks?

1126
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,960
Um,

1127
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,990
I have used cookbooks in the past,

1128
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,620
um,

1129
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,470
but I do a majority of
the cooking in my house.

1130
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,890
Uh,

1131
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,000
I come from,

1132
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:00,510
you know,

1133
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,760
my mom used to cook a lot and uh,

1134
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:05,160
and my father used to do a lot of fish,

1135
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,350
so I don't do a lot of recipes.

1136
00:31:07,351 --> 00:31:08,280
It's more like dad,

1137
00:31:08,281 --> 00:31:09,330
how do you make the,

1138
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:09,660
um,

1139
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,590
the muscle,

1140
00:31:10,591 --> 00:31:11,100
uh,

1141
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,840
for the mussel sauce and then he'll,

1142
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,560
you know,

1143
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,460
take me through it.

1144
00:31:14,461 --> 00:31:16,020
So nothing's written down.

1145
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:16,863
It's

1146
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,050
a lot.

1147
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,883
Yeah,

1148
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,430
yeah,

1149
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:22,120
yeah,

1150
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,430
yeah.

1151
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:23,061
What do you do?

1152
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:23,431
Like what,

1153
00:31:23,431 --> 00:31:23,981
what do you end,

1154
00:31:23,981 --> 00:31:25,910
do you like look linguine with clams?

1155
00:31:25,911 --> 00:31:26,031
Like,

1156
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:26,864
what kinds of stuff do you cook?

1157
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:29,240
You know what I like?

1158
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,710
I like a lot of pasta.

1159
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,370
Um,

1160
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,170
I like a nice bowl NEA sauce.

1161
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,980
However,

1162
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,980
I'm trying to stay away from those
types of meals because in the past I

1163
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:41,330
ballooned up to two oh five,

1164
00:31:41,331 --> 00:31:42,320
two oh seven,

1165
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:45,430
not giving a crap about my,

1166
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,350
my health or,

1167
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,690
or anything.

1168
00:31:47,691 --> 00:31:52,691
And recently I've lost some weight due
to the fact that I'm been watching my

1169
00:31:53,631 --> 00:31:54,380
diet.

1170
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:54,921
Cause you know,

1171
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:55,221
I mean,

1172
00:31:55,221 --> 00:31:55,611
I don't know.

1173
00:31:55,611 --> 00:31:56,091
I mean you're,

1174
00:31:56,091 --> 00:31:56,781
you're in shape,

1175
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:57,320
so you,

1176
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,300
you seem a lot more disciplined than a
lot of comedians when it comes to health.

1177
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,141
But,

1178
00:32:03,141 --> 00:32:03,500
uh,

1179
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,430
for myself,

1180
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,600
I have,

1181
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,020
you know,

1182
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:10,810
taken on a regimen of
I'm not drinking a wine.

1183
00:32:10,811 --> 00:32:14,210
I used to having like a little wine
after the meal or during the meal.

1184
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,620
So I've eliminated that.

1185
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,401
And,

1186
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:16,940
uh,

1187
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,960
I've been doing some,

1188
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:18,560
uh,

1189
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,860
polities polite.

1190
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:20,300
Yeah.

1191
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:20,871
Nice.

1192
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:21,890
Which has helped my,

1193
00:32:21,891 --> 00:32:22,724
uh,

1194
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,351
my,

1195
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:23,820
um,

1196
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:28,340
balance and my core and
underrated exercise.

1197
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,450
Very inelegant,

1198
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,293
Italia Joe.

1199
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,350
This polities is really changed
the way I look at the physical fit,

1200
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:35,801
you know,

1201
00:32:35,801 --> 00:32:38,500
who's really into
[inaudible] Sergei Kovalev.

1202
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,320
Really?

1203
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:39,591
Yeah.

1204
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:40,340
He just read,

1205
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,460
regained the you the WBC or WB,

1206
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,210
I forget which,

1207
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,910
which light heavyweight
championship on a Saturday night.

1208
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,121
He's,

1209
00:32:47,121 --> 00:32:49,610
the crusher is bad ass
Russian mother fucker.

1210
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,720
And uh,

1211
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,680
he just,

1212
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,550
um,

1213
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,150
just,

1214
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,451
I mean,

1215
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:54,380
at 35,

1216
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:58,790
I think he has just regained his
title and his routines very unusual.

1217
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,930
And one of the things that he does for
his exercise is policies and you know,

1218
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:03,860
people make fun of it,

1219
00:33:03,861 --> 00:33:08,750
but the guy has got strength in all these
weird places and full range of motion

1220
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:10,070
and flexibility and

1221
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,071
well,

1222
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:11,904
that's what I have.

1223
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:13,140
I'm 45,

1224
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:15,060
so my range of motion,

1225
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:15,450
my,

1226
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,220
my shoulders screwed up,

1227
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,630
my legs,

1228
00:33:18,631 --> 00:33:19,411
my knee.

1229
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:22,200
And this has given me an
exercise where I could,

1230
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,950
uh,

1231
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,690
not only improve my flexibility,

1232
00:33:24,691 --> 00:33:25,201
but man,

1233
00:33:25,201 --> 00:33:25,381
I mean,

1234
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:25,960
you walk out,

1235
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,731
I'm drenched.

1236
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:27,240
Yeah.

1237
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,110
And uh,

1238
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:28,651
so yeah,

1239
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:31,590
I'm getting back on the physical fitness
thing because I've been on the road

1240
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:36,591
soul so much that I kind
of let that slip a little,

1241
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,890
but I want to get the,

1242
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:38,570
I want to get,

1243
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:38,871
yeah.

1244
00:33:38,871 --> 00:33:39,141
You know,

1245
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:41,180
some guys are real good about
working out on the road.

1246
00:33:41,181 --> 00:33:42,950
Like Brian Cowen goes everywhere.

1247
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:43,371
He goes,

1248
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,710
he'll go to a gym and
he's real good at that.

1249
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,730
Like he'll go and,

1250
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,120
uh,

1251
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,510
go workout with kickboxers
workout with Jujitsu guys.

1252
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,890
Brian does a lot of boxing,

1253
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,701
so he'll find a,

1254
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:55,510
like a local boxing gym and have
a guy hold the pads for him,

1255
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:55,881
maybe dual,

1256
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:59,330
even a little light sparring and
he gets really into it on the road.

1257
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:03,650
But I think that's the key is like to
force yourself to not stay in your hotel

1258
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,880
and wait until the show goes.

1259
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:07,250
You just gotta Force yourself
to get out and go do something.

1260
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,121
Yeah.

1261
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,910
I wish I was a self motivated guy,

1262
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,320
but I need help.

1263
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,590
So I've taken a,

1264
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,710
my buddy John Petrolia
is a personal trainer,

1265
00:34:15,711 --> 00:34:18,470
so he comes on the road with me and uh,

1266
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,393
you know,

1267
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,840
motivates me to,

1268
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:21,121
oh,

1269
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:21,770
that's great.

1270
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,670
To get up and go.

1271
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:24,050
We do swimming.

1272
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:25,310
We do a lot of different things.

1273
00:34:25,311 --> 00:34:26,144
This guys,

1274
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:30,380
I liken them to you because
he's into a mixed martial arts.

1275
00:34:30,381 --> 00:34:31,520
He's into hunting.

1276
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,170
He's one of these guys that is a
great motivator and really helped me,

1277
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,680
uh,

1278
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,380
get my life back together when
it comes to physical fitness.

1279
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:40,214
Because again,

1280
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,710
I was lifting weights,

1281
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,080
my everything was falling apart.

1282
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:47,180
And now with the swimming and Palantir is,

1283
00:34:47,181 --> 00:34:48,500
I feel like a,

1284
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,660
I have something to look
forward to when it comes to,

1285
00:34:50,661 --> 00:34:51,430
uh,

1286
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,770
to,

1287
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,050
to working out because I to go to the gym.

1288
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:54,321
For me,

1289
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,700
it wasn't fun anymore.

1290
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,001
I was like,

1291
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:58,250
what am I going do biceps and chest?

1292
00:34:59,030 --> 00:34:59,863
It's over.

1293
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,753
I ain't,

1294
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,880
I ain't do it to 25 ever again.

1295
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:05,570
That's,

1296
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,880
that was my workout since I was like 18.

1297
00:35:07,881 --> 00:35:08,640
I'd go in,

1298
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,080
nothing.

1299
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,070
Nothing changed.

1300
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:14,960
It was two 25 and then
let's do some curls and a,

1301
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:15,291
you know,

1302
00:35:15,291 --> 00:35:17,690
neglect the abs and go home.

1303
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:19,483
The legs,

1304
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,013
no legs.

1305
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:22,660
Although I did have a,

1306
00:35:22,661 --> 00:35:23,930
I played soccer growing up,

1307
00:35:23,931 --> 00:35:24,950
so I did have those,

1308
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:25,190
uh,

1309
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:25,570
you know,

1310
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,170
the soccer lakes,

1311
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:29,300
I've got like Earl Campbell thighs.

1312
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,031
Yeah,

1313
00:35:30,031 --> 00:35:32,070
soccer is one of the best exercises ever.

1314
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,491
I mean,

1315
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,410
it's also a great way
to blow your ACL out.

1316
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,303
Totally.

1317
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:35,851
Everybody's,

1318
00:35:35,851 --> 00:35:36,091
you know,

1319
00:35:36,091 --> 00:35:36,990
it's shifting left,

1320
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,381
right.

1321
00:35:37,381 --> 00:35:38,214
And all that.

1322
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,420
There's a fucking picture,

1323
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:39,631
you know,

1324
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:40,464

1325
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,281

1326
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:41,731
the a,

1327
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:42,564
the DJ,

1328
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,610
his fucking son,

1329
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,541
there's a video,

1330
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:46,680
he retweeted it.

1331
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,970
His son is a football
player and there's a,

1332
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:53,160
there's a video of his son where you know,

1333
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,870
someone's trying to tackle him
and he moves like a fucking ghost.

1334
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,951
It's incredible.

1335
00:35:58,951 --> 00:35:59,401
You watch them.

1336
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:00,234
Do I like it was one,

1337
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,780
one of those rare things where you see
something and you're like legitimately

1338
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:04,231
impressed.

1339
00:36:04,231 --> 00:36:05,160
Like Holy Shit,

1340
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,960
I watched it like five times in a row.

1341
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:08,640
This kid's foot work is incredible.

1342
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:09,410
Yeah.

1343
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:12,340
But footwork like that kind of like,

1344
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,520
like who's in better
shape than soccer players?

1345
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,320
They're constantly sprinting games
like you and you have to maintain that

1346
00:36:19,321 --> 00:36:20,130
stamina.

1347
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:21,480
You're constantly sprinting.

1348
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:21,861
Yeah.

1349
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:25,100
There's a lot of mileage you're
putting on in us in a soccer game.

1350
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,020
Although you know what gives me,

1351
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:31,250
and you are probably going to
laugh as well as your listeners,

1352
00:36:31,251 --> 00:36:32,084
believe me,

1353
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,370
pickleball,

1354
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,170
you ever played pickle ball?

1355
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,390
What does that pickle pickle ball.

1356
00:36:38,391 --> 00:36:43,391
It's like pennys and pink Pong
and you played in a gymnasium.

1357
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,381
So it's like a,

1358
00:36:45,381 --> 00:36:46,214
it's a net.

1359
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:46,810
Okay.

1360
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,121
And it's,

1361
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:50,900
you got paddles and talk
about moving side to side.

1362
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,430
It's,

1363
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:56,150
it's fun and you burn a ton of
calories and you do it in a gym.

1364
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,680
You didn't have an gym and like a,

1365
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,850
like a basketball court.

1366
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,350
So it's like racquetball,

1367
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:01,184
but there's a net,

1368
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,050
there's a net.

1369
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,620
So it's a bouncing off the wall.

1370
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:05,030
You playing like tennis.

1371
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,580
Yeah.

1372
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,140
So court,

1373
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:06,973
small net.

1374
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:07,550
Okay.

1375
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,990
And you have uh,

1376
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,153
like in Venice,

1377
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,470
those little small course it.

1378
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,243
Why the old,

1379
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,480
hello,

1380
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,380
my name is Fred.

1381
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,253
This is,

1382
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,000
listen,

1383
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,840
you're going to laugh.

1384
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,321
All right.

1385
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,630
There's a lot of old
people that play this,

1386
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,820
but I'm telling you it's,

1387
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,740
this is embarrassing.

1388
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:29,720
So you each have your use for people.

1389
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,291
Yeah,

1390
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:31,220
you could do doubles,

1391
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:36,170
but me and my buddy played just one
on one and I'm telling you it's not,

1392
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,870
it looks like it's not only fun,

1393
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:43,640
but you burn a lot of calories and you
don't even know you're doing it because

1394
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,730
I'm diving and it's uh,

1395
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,590
it's one of the exercises that we,

1396
00:37:48,591 --> 00:37:49,424
uh,

1397
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,473
we really enjoy.

1398
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,710
Got You doing,

1399
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,530
he's got you doing
polities and pickle ball.

1400
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,173
What's next?

1401
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,440
I have no idea what he's working his way.

1402
00:38:00,441 --> 00:38:01,550
You know what he's working towards.

1403
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:03,470
I don't have to tell you.

1404
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,690
I'm calling you.

1405
00:38:05,691 --> 00:38:08,510
I know a lot of 68 year
old people play this,

1406
00:38:08,511 --> 00:38:09,080
but uh,

1407
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,460
if you're looking for a low,

1408
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:10,750
uh,

1409
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,690
kind of impact,

1410
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:13,430
fun activity,

1411
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,863
uh,

1412
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:17,490
it looks good if you're
looking at it and go,

1413
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,333
oh it does.

1414
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,390
Tennis is fucking hard,

1415
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:20,970
man.

1416
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,590
It's another thing.

1417
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,180
This is like,

1418
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,650
this is like tennis
reduced to a smaller court,

1419
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,430
basically.

1420
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:28,870
Probably Healthier for you and had it
not as hard on the ankles and the needs.

1421
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,020
It's not as hard.

1422
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,370
But uh,

1423
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:35,690
I will have to go after we
have our steak over again.

1424
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,970
Where would one go to and
of course in Venice beach,

1425
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:40,810
that's what I thought it was.

1426
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,990
I've always seen these small tennis
courts there and I didn't know really what

1427
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:44,850
people were playing on.

1428
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,330
They're calling it paddle tennis.

1429
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,351
Yeah.

1430
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:47,621
Maybe,

1431
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:48,221
maybe this,

1432
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,090
but this is what,

1433
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:49,810
this is what it is.

1434
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,980
These guys look ridiculous.

1435
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:51,850
They should just go home.

1436
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,230
This is outrageous.

1437
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:54,760
What are you doing sir?

1438
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:56,291
I'm telling you.

1439
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:57,070
Put a little English.

1440
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:57,371
Listen,

1441
00:38:57,371 --> 00:38:59,170
I grew up ping pong.

1442
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,850
I'm really good at Ping Pong.

1443
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,870
Yeah.

1444
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,360
So this is like

1445
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,820
a larger version of ping pong.

1446
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,020
Yeah.

1447
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:08,920
It looks like it's fun.

1448
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,960
All bullshit aside.

1449
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,950
That looks like a good time.

1450
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,820
It's fun.

1451
00:39:12,821 --> 00:39:13,480
Believe me,

1452
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,970
I know your listeners at
nigh and left and right now,

1453
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,370
but I'm telling you it's,

1454
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:19,204
it's uh,

1455
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:19,880
it's,

1456
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,713
it's good.

1457
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,160
So that's what I'm doing show.

1458
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:25,570
So you take your trainer with
you on your row on the road.

1459
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,433
That's the move.

1460
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,221
Where's this?

1461
00:39:27,221 --> 00:39:28,054
Where'd you meet this guy?

1462
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,290
I've known him for 20 years.

1463
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:29,531
I met,

1464
00:39:29,531 --> 00:39:32,670
I'm on the set of days of
our lives doing extra work,

1465
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,960
shit days of our lives.

1466
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:38,020
When I first came out to la in 1998,

1467
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:44,970
I was the type of guy I would do
these weird like mailings to get work,

1468
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,551
right.

1469
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,930
So for days of our lives,

1470
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,370
it was general hospital,

1471
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,630
General Hospital,

1472
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,920
take a headshot and then
take a post it note.

1473
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:57,280
And I would write on a post
it note ready to operate,

1474
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,081
stuck.

1475
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:01,710
It could have had shot and I sat it out.

1476
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,130
So I would do these like
weird little mailing.

1477
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:04,861
We are only,

1478
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:05,011
you know,

1479
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,780
maybe the person opening
the mail would go,

1480
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:07,021
oh,

1481
00:40:07,021 --> 00:40:08,460
I get a little chuckle and whatnot.

1482
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:10,830
So I met him doing extra work.

1483
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:11,910
This is what I used to do,

1484
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,360
uh,

1485
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,960
for,

1486
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,250
for some extra cash.

1487
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:14,971
And,

1488
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:15,270
uh,

1489
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,590
we became fast friends.

1490
00:40:16,591 --> 00:40:20,520
He's an Italian kid and
a w w similar upbringing,

1491
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,571
middle class.

1492
00:40:21,571 --> 00:40:22,291
He's from New York.

1493
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:23,310
I'm from Chicago.

1494
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,150
And uh,

1495
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,721
just a great,

1496
00:40:24,721 --> 00:40:25,370
great guy.

1497
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:26,203
I,

1498
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,960
he set me up with my wife.

1499
00:40:27,961 --> 00:40:28,321
I mean,

1500
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,270
that's how I know my
wife threw him and uh,

1501
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,561
he's been a huge,

1502
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:32,394
huge help for me.

1503
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,470
That's awesome man.

1504
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:36,590
If you could find a guy who actually
knows what he's doing and that,

1505
00:40:36,591 --> 00:40:39,440
that is so huge because they
also know what you need,

1506
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,011
you know,

1507
00:40:40,011 --> 00:40:40,341
they're like,

1508
00:40:40,341 --> 00:40:40,611
hey,

1509
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:40,881
you know,

1510
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:44,630
we need to concentrate more on your rear
delts and the issues you have with your

1511
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:45,920
shoulders or your mobility.

1512
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:47,690
So we're going to work
on some band work first,

1513
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,130
warm you up and you could fuck
yourself up just doing it by yourself.

1514
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,080
Really could.

1515
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,501
I did,

1516
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,370
and you're right,

1517
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,550
he knows what to work on,

1518
00:40:57,551 --> 00:40:58,600
what to loosen up.

1519
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,970
Let's not jump right into the exercise.

1520
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,140
Let's warm it up a little bit.

1521
00:41:02,141 --> 00:41:03,190
So yeah,

1522
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:06,010
I credit him to kind
of get me back on the,

1523
00:41:06,011 --> 00:41:06,491
on the,

1524
00:41:06,491 --> 00:41:09,850
on the health and fitness and
plus we were taking our own meals.

1525
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:10,590
That's another thing.

1526
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:10,780
Uh,

1527
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,290
we were,

1528
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,700
we pack our own meals,

1529
00:41:12,701 --> 00:41:16,210
we get like a service
and we bring a breakfast,

1530
00:41:16,211 --> 00:41:17,830
lunch and dinner on the road.

1531
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,690
And that's our meals.

1532
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,391
Oh,

1533
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:21,500
you're taking it to another level.

1534
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:21,710
Yeah.

1535
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,340
Well,

1536
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,121
well listen,

1537
00:41:23,121 --> 00:41:24,670
I was going out having a,

1538
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:26,690
a dry aged at midnight.

1539
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,020
I was eating a full blown steak,

1540
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,390
asparagus and baked potato,

1541
00:41:32,391 --> 00:41:33,090
and then I,

1542
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,040
then I would go to bed.

1543
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,540
It sounds good.

1544
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,560
It's delicious,

1545
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,690
but you ain't got to in that,

1546
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,640
you're bloody right.

1547
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,871
That is true.

1548
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:42,171
You know,

1549
00:41:42,171 --> 00:41:46,160
sometimes I will come home from the store
and I'm hungry and I'll eat late night

1550
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,330
and then I'll wake up,

1551
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,500
almost hung over.

1552
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:50,900
I don't like what I didn't even try.

1553
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:51,770
I ate,

1554
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:55,160
I ate like a thousand calories
at two 30 in the morning.

1555
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,130
Yeah.

1556
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,400
Well last night my wife and I had Sushi.

1557
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,100
I woke up and I don't,

1558
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,990
the sodium was unbelievable.

1559
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:06,860
I was like cheese from one thing as Sushi.

1560
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,330
I look like a,

1561
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,590
I need to go sweat.

1562
00:42:09,591 --> 00:42:10,424
And your son,

1563
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,140
is it sodium and Sushi?

1564
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,130
Like what's it's the soul.

1565
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,681
It's this,

1566
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:16,540
I'm the soy sauce and uh,

1567
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,680
that's where at least
I'm picking it up from.

1568
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,550
Who are all these guys
showing up at our door?

1569
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,483
Hmm.

1570
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,893
Okay.

1571
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,533
Um,

1572
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,071
does,

1573
00:42:29,071 --> 00:42:30,070
but sodium is,

1574
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,000
what would it be in the soy sauce?

1575
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,820
Right.

1576
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,660
Green soy sauce.

1577
00:42:33,661 --> 00:42:34,494
That's like the low,

1578
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:34,931
you know,

1579
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:36,900
those have the low one and the high,

1580
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:40,650
one of the two different kinds
of low sodium and high sodium.

1581
00:42:40,651 --> 00:42:43,700
I think last night I had the
high sodium and I woke up and uh,

1582
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,353
it wasn't good.

1583
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,740
How much soy sauce are you using?

1584
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,300
You know what I like?

1585
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,480
What do you like to soy sauce
and then I like the a Wasabi,

1586
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,160
I put a clump it at,

1587
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,800
in the soy sauce and then you mix it.

1588
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:57,480
I mix it and make like a slurry.

1589
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:58,200
Yeah,

1590
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,010
it gets,

1591
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,330
it gets a thick,

1592
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,190
so when I eat the Sushi,

1593
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:02,720
it just,

1594
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,320
it burns my nose.

1595
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,410
That's how I like,

1596
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,600
I like it that way too.

1597
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,300
Sometimes a Sushi chefs don't like it.

1598
00:43:09,301 --> 00:43:09,950
When you do that.

1599
00:43:09,950 --> 00:43:11,050
They get offended.

1600
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:11,401
It's like what?

1601
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:14,460
Disrespect and the fish
it should stand alone.

1602
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,160
Did you ever see that
movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi?

1603
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:17,911
Oh,

1604
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:21,510
is that the guy that's got the
Sushi joint at the train station?

1605
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,051
Yeah.

1606
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:22,730
In Japan?

1607
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,070
Yeah.

1608
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:23,903
Yeah.

1609
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,780
Have you seen that?

1610
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,910
I've seen half of it.

1611
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,490
It's really weird because it
changed my idea of what Sushi is.

1612
00:43:30,491 --> 00:43:31,020
I used to think,

1613
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,171
oh,

1614
00:43:31,171 --> 00:43:32,050
they're cutting fish up.

1615
00:43:32,051 --> 00:43:33,340
They slap it on a piece of rice.

1616
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:34,150
It's great.

1617
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:34,570
It's good.

1618
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,140
Tastes good,

1619
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:35,770
clean,

1620
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:36,603
easy for you.

1621
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,010
Now I realize like this guy,

1622
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:39,610
it's his,

1623
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,330
like his lives dedication to
putting together the perfect tastes.

1624
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,240
Yeah.

1625
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,160
Like there was one guy that's been
working on this egg plate for a year,

1626
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,570
trying to perfect it,

1627
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:50,830
trying to get it right.

1628
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,760
Similar to like a joke,

1629
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:53,220
you know,

1630
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,640
trying to make the joke so perfect.

1631
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,620
I was trying to get the dish so perfect.

1632
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,220
Um,

1633
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:58,421
yeah,

1634
00:43:58,421 --> 00:43:59,870
and I would never thought that with Sushi.

1635
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,201
With sue.

1636
00:44:00,201 --> 00:44:01,050
I thought like if you,

1637
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,893
someone said a Sushi

1638
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,823
chef,

1639
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:03,490
I'd be like,

1640
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:03,941
ah,

1641
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:04,361
yeah.

1642
00:44:04,361 --> 00:44:04,720
Right.

1643
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,310
Okay.

1644
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:05,561
You're like,

1645
00:44:05,561 --> 00:44:06,970
he's not really a chef.

1646
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,440
It's just cutting up fish.

1647
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:09,461
Yeah,

1648
00:44:09,461 --> 00:44:12,640
but there's something about the
way they're preparing these.

1649
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,420
I mean,

1650
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,811
yeah,

1651
00:44:13,811 --> 00:44:16,300
it's one thing if you're
getting like a Sashimi,

1652
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:17,260
it's just salmon,

1653
00:44:17,261 --> 00:44:20,680
but if they're putting it together
with rice and you know it's,

1654
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:21,940
it's like a science.

1655
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:22,541
Yeah,

1656
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:22,781
no,

1657
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:23,920
it's definitely a science.

1658
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,320
It's also a science
because they age the fish,

1659
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,400
which I didn't know.

1660
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,060
I didn't know that.

1661
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,271
Yeah.

1662
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:29,740
I was watching this youtube thing.

1663
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:29,921
Oh,

1664
00:44:29,921 --> 00:44:31,980
where are these guys were going
to Sushi place and they were

1665
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,880
saying that tuna,

1666
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:37,560
they will have their tuna in the
frigerator for as long as two weeks in

1667
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:41,010
preparation for Sushi and
just like dry age steak.

1668
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,300
The aging of the tuna breaks down the,

1669
00:44:44,301 --> 00:44:44,540
the,

1670
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:49,540
the bacteria break down some of the tissue
and make it softer and more delicate

1671
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,300
and change the flavor profile.

1672
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:52,550
Yeah.

1673
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:52,800
No,

1674
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,631
I have no idea.

1675
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,590
I thought that caught it.

1676
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,540
They don't,

1677
00:44:55,610 --> 00:45:00,260
don't you freeze fish for
it to be Sashimi grade is,

1678
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:01,340
is that the deal?

1679
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,263
I don't know.

1680
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,613
Was that the case?

1681
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:04,041
I don't know.

1682
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:05,040
Let's find out what makes something,

1683
00:45:05,041 --> 00:45:05,874
it's just seemed great.

1684
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:11,020
I saw there was a guy who caught a big
ass fucking tuna and they sold it for $3

1685
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:11,720
million.

1686
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,620
I had queued up and say,

1687
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:13,400
yeah,

1688
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,630
we'll go back to that.

1689
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,570
Why in the fuck is that $5,000 a pound?

1690
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,370
Japan's King of tuna.

1691
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,080
Is that racist?

1692
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,033
Is that racist?

1693
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,903
Uh,

1694
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,551
the way I said it,

1695
00:45:25,551 --> 00:45:26,384
it seemed racist.

1696
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:26,811
Uh,

1697
00:45:26,811 --> 00:45:27,540
the first tune,

1698
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,490
the auction of the year,

1699
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:33,140
a Tokyo's new fish market set a record
price more than 3 million for a giant

1700
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:33,951
Bluefin tuna.

1701
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:35,780
A critically endangered species.

1702
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:36,531
Yeah.

1703
00:45:36,531 --> 00:45:38,450
See that's where you gotta go man.

1704
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,310
Cause it critically endangered.

1705
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:40,820
And if it's,

1706
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:41,361
if it is,

1707
00:45:41,361 --> 00:45:44,540
so should you really be
cutting that fucker up?

1708
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,340
I don't know about that.

1709
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,530
When I was in Hawaii,

1710
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:49,161
uh,

1711
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:50,120
we caught some,

1712
00:45:50,121 --> 00:45:50,470
uh,

1713
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,303
yellow tail.

1714
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,700
My youngest daughter loves fishing,

1715
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,250
so went out with her and we,

1716
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:54,650
uh,

1717
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:56,870
went on this boat and we
were actually jigging.

1718
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,100
There's like this shelf in this
big dropoff in these yellow tails.

1719
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,083
Hang out there.

1720
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:07,100
We caught a gang of them and one of the
things they were saying was that the big

1721
00:46:07,251 --> 00:46:12,251
island had a farm where they were farming
yellowtail like they had this gigantic

1722
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,540
like sort of netted in area where the
fish couldn't leave and they were,

1723
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,370
they were trapped in this area.

1724
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,490
But then the storm came and broke down
all the nets and the fish escaped and now

1725
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,770
they're everywhere and
you're catching them.

1726
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:28,900
We caught like I don't,

1727
00:46:28,901 --> 00:46:32,390
I'm like six or seven of them and they're
fucking pick like 10 pounds and you're

1728
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:34,970
fighting them on like
a light spinning rods,

1729
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,520
like really awesome,

1730
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:38,383
awesome time.

1731
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:42,080
But they were unbelievably
delicious but these are non native.

1732
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,720
They brought him over there and released
him and like they'd been to start doing

1733
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:45,650
that with other fish.

1734
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:49,370
Like they really should set up these
fish farms and just released these

1735
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:53,000
motherfuckers out into the ocean because
they're just taking nets and pulling

1736
00:46:53,001 --> 00:46:54,010
them across the bottom of [inaudible].

1737
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,080
I don't even,

1738
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:56,580
it's like such a,

1739
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:00,000
there's something to be said about
going out and catching the fish,

1740
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:00,834
like you're saying,

1741
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:05,250
rather than taking a a net and just
scooping everything up in its path,

1742
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:05,940
everything you think,

1743
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:06,691
turtles,

1744
00:47:06,691 --> 00:47:07,381
dolphins,

1745
00:47:07,381 --> 00:47:08,280
whatever the fuck is there.

1746
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:10,440
Everything gets jacked and the problem is,

1747
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,131
you know,

1748
00:47:11,131 --> 00:47:11,964
there's,

1749
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,560
who knows how many countries have boats
that are doing that and they're all

1750
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:20,220
operating in international water and I
don't know what the fucking laws are,

1751
00:47:20,221 --> 00:47:21,930
but they're just pulling what and they,

1752
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:22,321
you know,

1753
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,840
the other thing they do that's
fucked up when they're done,

1754
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,150
a lot of times they cut that,

1755
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:28,710
the net loose and they
just leave it in the ocean.

1756
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,330
They just dropped the net
to the bottom of the ocean.

1757
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,630
It's funny they have the
regulations for like hunting.

1758
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:35,160
Yeah.

1759
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,130
They don't have it like in the
ocean because nobody owns it.

1760
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:39,590
Yeah.

1761
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,090
You only own like a certain
amount of your shore,

1762
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:43,983
like ow off,

1763
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:46,600
like say from Malibu out.

1764
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,280
I don't know how much they,

1765
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,720
the United States owns,

1766
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:53,440
but we only own a certain amount and
then it becomes international waters,

1767
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,820
international waters.

1768
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,410
It's like kind of
anybody can be out there.

1769
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:58,083
It's weird.

1770
00:47:58,510 --> 00:47:59,740
I mean it makes sense,

1771
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,450
but there's no,

1772
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,250
I don't think there's any,

1773
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:07,630
I think if you have a boat you can just
kind of go anywhere that's international

1774
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:09,400
water and just no regulations here.

1775
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:09,850
What is,

1776
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:12,220
what parts of the ocean are
considered international water,

1777
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:14,200
territorial waters or territorial seas?

1778
00:48:14,201 --> 00:48:19,201
Defined by a 1982 United Nations
convention on the Law of the sea.

1779
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:24,660
It's a belt of coastal waters extending
at most 12 nautical miles from the

1780
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:25,421
baseline.

1781
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:29,140
Usually the mean low water
mark of the coastal state,

1782
00:48:29,141 --> 00:48:34,141
so 12 miles or 12 miles out or
a 13.8 miles nautical miles.

1783
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,940
Nautical Miles is different,

1784
00:48:36,941 --> 00:48:37,330
Huh?

1785
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:37,840
Hmm.

1786
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,530
Interesting.

1787
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,300
Why is it different and how weird is that?

1788
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,400
Nautical miles is different
than regular miles.

1789
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:42,911
The fuck.

1790
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:43,780
Get it together.

1791
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:44,651
Don't call it a mile.

1792
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:45,484
Then he fucks.

1793
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:46,390
Imagine,

1794
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,871
hey buddy,

1795
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:48,100
I'll meet you at 12 miles.

1796
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:48,371
All right.

1797
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:52,330
12 nautical miles and the guys
at Mylon 0.8 away from you.

1798
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,960
All those stores use the
label Sushi grade fish.

1799
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:58,270
There was no official
standards for using this label.

1800
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:02,650
The only regulation is that parasitic
fish such as salmon should be frozen to

1801
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:04,780
kill any parasites for being consumed raw.

1802
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:07,060
The best ones are assigned grade one,

1803
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:09,160
which is usually what would
be sold as Sushi grade.

1804
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:11,740
But what about Sashimi
grade is what he said.

1805
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,574
It's the same thing.

1806
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,020
So I looked up and that's what popped up.

1807
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:15,910
You're not supposed to eat salmon raw.

1808
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,880
Apparently salmon is a
freshwater fish and salmon.

1809
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:20,140
It can fuck you up,

1810
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,140
but you could pull a tuna out
of the right out of the ocean.

1811
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:23,711
Yeah.

1812
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,500
I have a buddy of mine who when
a tuna fishing off of San Diego,

1813
00:49:26,501 --> 00:49:29,890
they call it a tuna and they sliced it
up and ate it right there on the boat,

1814
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:30,610
like right as they,

1815
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:33,790
right after they pulled it out of the
water that I haven't done but the that

1816
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,000
that to me would be the bus eating.

1817
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,690
It's just out of the water.

1818
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,350
I mean,

1819
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,130
I just hope they don't wait until there's
nothing left before they start doing

1820
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:43,060
something to save them.

1821
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,223
It just doesn't,

1822
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,490
it doesn't seem like the,

1823
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:45,940
I mean,

1824
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:49,480
if you're taking us fish and
you're buying it for $3 million,

1825
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,130
that's almost like a scene in the movie,

1826
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:51,401
right?

1827
00:49:51,401 --> 00:49:52,330
That's like the end.

1828
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,340
This was one of the last tune I looked.

1829
00:49:54,341 --> 00:49:55,360
They bought it for 3 million.

1830
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:57,370
Everybody's smiling and
they're cutting it up.

1831
00:49:57,371 --> 00:49:57,730
It's like,

1832
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:58,563
Ooh,

1833
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,000
hunting regulations are critical,

1834
00:50:01,001 --> 00:50:01,780
but you could,

1835
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,400
you know what the population is.

1836
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:03,930
It's very,

1837
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:04,600
they do.

1838
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,140
The fish and wildlife departments have
all these different methods they use,

1839
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:08,981
whether it's,

1840
00:50:08,981 --> 00:50:11,440
I'm using reports from Hunter's,

1841
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,400
whether it's a,

1842
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:16,720
they fly over with airplanes and
helicopters and things along those lines.

1843
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:18,220
Whatever they use,

1844
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,040
they have a bunch of different ways that
they can determine what the population

1845
00:50:21,041 --> 00:50:23,440
is and then they determine
the population of predators,

1846
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:25,090
how many animals are lost,

1847
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:28,130
how many animals are shot
during hunting season.

1848
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:30,770
And then the determine how
many tags can be divvied out.

1849
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:33,080
So like say if you live in an area,

1850
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,430
um,

1851
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:37,190
there might be a 500 tags available,

1852
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,340
but there might be like 2000 hunters
that are applying for those tags.

1853
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:42,020
So most people are not going to get it.

1854
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,490
It's a,

1855
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:43,950
it's a,

1856
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:45,470
a very smart way.

1857
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,140
They've really got it down
to a science because of that.

1858
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,630
There's more whitetail
deer in this country than,

1859
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,100
than even when Columbus land.

1860
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:53,070
It's a,

1861
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:54,650
they've got a really good system.

1862
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,110
If they could figure
something out for the ocean,

1863
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,680
the problem is you'd have to get everybody
to cooperate and some like they can't

1864
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:02,570
even get Japan to stop killing whales.

1865
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,141
Like there's,

1866
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:06,290
there's certain Japanese folks who,

1867
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:06,710
uh,

1868
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:09,020
they have this really sneaky
thing they do and there's this,

1869
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:09,651
there's this,

1870
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:10,484
um,

1871
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,330
um,

1872
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,780
conservation group called
the sea shepherds and they
catch these fucking people

1873
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:15,614
all the time.

1874
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,060
But what they basically do is they say
we're a research boat and they use a

1875
00:51:20,061 --> 00:51:23,660
research boat and go slaughter
whales and then sell the whales.

1876
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:26,180
But they pretend it's that it's research,

1877
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:27,890
but if they kill a whale,

1878
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:31,520
certain countries still
value parts of Wales.

1879
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:33,020
They make things with it.

1880
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,090
What the fuck do they make with whales?

1881
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,100
I think they make some perfumes.

1882
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,313
Like what?

1883
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,420
But people are still killing whales.

1884
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:42,710
He hits,

1885
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,180
it gets weird when things are smart.

1886
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,470
That's when it gets weird.

1887
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:46,370
You know,

1888
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,870
something as smart as a fucking whale.

1889
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:49,001
Yeah.

1890
00:51:49,001 --> 00:51:49,421
I mean,

1891
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:50,254
uh,

1892
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:52,331
the end,

1893
00:51:52,331 --> 00:51:53,500
these in these countries,

1894
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:54,730
they're using,

1895
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,330
like you said,

1896
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:57,760
parts of the fish for,

1897
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:58,640
you know,

1898
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,310
they put it on their mantle.

1899
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:01,360
They got like a,

1900
00:52:01,361 --> 00:52:01,780
a,

1901
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,260
I dunno,

1902
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:03,150
a tooth.

1903
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:03,930
Yeah.

1904
00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:04,130
Or,

1905
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,260
or,

1906
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,093
or what have you.

1907
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,210
From a whale or a shark or whatever.

1908
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:07,960
It was.

1909
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,960
The big thing with rhinos guys,

1910
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,860
the rhino horns off and they drink it
like in a tea and supposed to make your

1911
00:52:14,861 --> 00:52:15,620
dick hard.

1912
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,030
Oh,

1913
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:16,863
is,

1914
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:17,901
see,

1915
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:18,860
this is what I'm talking about.

1916
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:19,431
You know,

1917
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:20,270
these things.

1918
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:21,501
I mean,

1919
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:25,640
I don't know how to hell you
remember all this stuff I'm going to,

1920
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,510
I've just forgot the
mileage off the coast.

1921
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:31,443
Miles,

1922
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,850
13.8 models.

1923
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,650
Miles 12 nautical miles.

1924
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,300
One point difference.

1925
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,280
1.8 difference at 12 miles,

1926
00:52:40,281 --> 00:52:40,760
which is,

1927
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,420
who knows how long.

1928
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,860
When you get to 500 miles out,

1929
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:43,943
you got to do the math.

1930
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,351
It's crazy.

1931
00:52:45,351 --> 00:52:46,184
It's stupid.

1932
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:46,700
Yeah.

1933
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:47,533
Um,

1934
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:47,871
yeah.

1935
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:48,111
I don't,

1936
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,310
I don't know how I remember these things.

1937
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:53,630
It's a fucking screwy brain.

1938
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,730
I wish I had your memory,

1939
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:56,240
Joe.

1940
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:56,990
That's what I'm saying.

1941
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,771
It's not the best.

1942
00:52:57,771 --> 00:52:58,604
I'm telling you.

1943
00:52:58,720 --> 00:52:59,970
It's like they're so,

1944
00:52:59,971 --> 00:53:01,460
a lot of shit that I don't remember.

1945
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,680
I just remember things
that are interesting.

1946
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:05,173
You know,

1947
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:05,811
I have,

1948
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:06,644
uh,

1949
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:07,220
it's,

1950
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,053
it's an odd,

1951
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,560
it's an odd sense of memory,

1952
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:10,401
but the,

1953
00:53:10,401 --> 00:53:10,521
uh,

1954
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:14,300
the Rhino Horn thing is kind of
sad because it doesn't even work,

1955
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,901
you know,

1956
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:17,870
especially in this day and age
where people can get Viagra.

1957
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:18,580
That works.

1958
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,160
Yeah.

1959
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,570
But there's something about it,

1960
00:53:20,571 --> 00:53:25,160
I think in some Asian cultures where
it's considered like a sign of wealth,

1961
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,000
you drive a Rolls Royce,

1962
00:53:27,001 --> 00:53:29,610
you drink rhino t this guy's a baller.

1963
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:30,241
You know,

1964
00:53:30,241 --> 00:53:31,380
he doesn't give a fuck.

1965
00:53:31,381 --> 00:53:32,220
He drinks wine,

1966
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:33,073
Ot,

1967
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:33,451
you know,

1968
00:53:33,451 --> 00:53:33,690
like,

1969
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:34,523
Oh man,

1970
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,170
guys drinking rhino t what a guy.

1971
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:37,860
Yeah.

1972
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:38,040
This.

1973
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,390
But there's something about that,

1974
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:39,631
like,

1975
00:53:39,631 --> 00:53:39,930
you know,

1976
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:40,231
yeah,

1977
00:53:40,231 --> 00:53:41,880
I want to eat an extinct animal.

1978
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,520
I want to bring a woolly mammoth back
to life and shoot it in the head.

1979
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,200
Like there's some people
that are like that.

1980
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:46,680
Like they,

1981
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,540
they want to be the ultimate conqueror.

1982
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:49,591
And you know,

1983
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:50,760
I want to eat a whale dick.

1984
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:51,623
You know what I mean?

1985
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,190
There's people that are like that.

1986
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:56,060
I'm just looking for a nice steak.

1987
00:53:56,061 --> 00:53:59,450
Joanie stake are good
linguine with clams sauce.

1988
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,580
That place that I saw you
at when I was with my kids.

1989
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:05,090
A modality that's a
sensational Italian restaurant.

1990
00:54:05,091 --> 00:54:06,650
That place is legit.

1991
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,220
Well that place moved.

1992
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:08,960
Yes.

1993
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,580
If you've been to the new habit.

1994
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,480
So that place is excellent.

1995
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:17,600
What's in the old spot there re where
you're doing the whole building.

1996
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,800
I think that's one of the last times I,

1997
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:23,780
I've eaten there when I
saw you and your kids,

1998
00:54:23,781 --> 00:54:24,270
uh,

1999
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:24,560
uh,

2000
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:25,820
having a meal there.

2001
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:26,511
Uh,

2002
00:54:26,511 --> 00:54:26,810
yeah,

2003
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:27,650
that place is good.

2004
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:28,970
The pastas are fantastic.

2005
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:30,110
As good as it gets.

2006
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:31,070
It's delicious.

2007
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:33,290
They make the perfect linguine with clams.

2008
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,640
It's like perfect.

2009
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,900
Not Too soupy.

2010
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:38,501
You know,

2011
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,040
some people get crazy with the,

2012
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:41,770
the liquid and you get it and it's like,

2013
00:54:41,771 --> 00:54:42,050
it's,

2014
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,400
it's almost like bathing in a,

2015
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,860
in a soup and,

2016
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:45,380
but they have,

2017
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:46,270
it's nice.

2018
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,410
It's Al Dente Day.

2019
00:54:47,411 --> 00:54:48,850
It's got some chew to it

2020
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,160
and the place is authentic to,

2021
00:54:52,161 --> 00:54:52,351
I mean,

2022
00:54:52,351 --> 00:54:56,780
they got like guys walking around there
from like Sicily and Italy and the

2023
00:54:56,781 --> 00:54:57,410
owners,

2024
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:02,150
a little old man that kind of walks
around and makes sure everything's okay.

2025
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:04,580
And He's speaking Italian a yeah.

2026
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:05,540
You feel like you're in a,

2027
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:06,680
you're in Italy when her style,

2028
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:07,451
but you know they're so,

2029
00:55:07,451 --> 00:55:08,284
you know.

2030
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:09,470
Yes I did.

2031
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:10,873
Yes I did.

2032
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,133
That's crazy.

2033
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:12,501
You know,

2034
00:55:12,501 --> 00:55:14,450
I also saw their Shannen Doherty.

2035
00:55:14,451 --> 00:55:15,284
You remember her?

2036
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:19,980
She was like two one on the original bad
girl that there's a lot of celebrities

2037
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:20,570
at pop in.

2038
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,320
I saw Jay Z and Beyonce come in on,

2039
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,920
so Yay.

2040
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:28,310
Come to the back door.

2041
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,680
And he was looking at like a trap.

2042
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,750
There was a battery
tunnel under the ground.

2043
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:37,020
It's put the celebrities
and pop them up through now.

2044
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,270
Oh Man.

2045
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:39,410
So,

2046
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,190
um,

2047
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,290
what was it like doing
Madison Square Garden?

2048
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:44,930
You did four shows in
Madison Square Garden.

2049
00:55:44,931 --> 00:55:46,040
He did it in the round.

2050
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:46,850
Yeah.

2051
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:47,571
So,

2052
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:48,170
um,

2053
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,590
how many shows you've done the
round before leading up to then?

2054
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:54,020
I'd say probably 15.

2055
00:55:54,021 --> 00:55:54,620
16.

2056
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:54,720
Oh,

2057
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,870
so you've done quite a few in the rounds.

2058
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,093
Do you like it?

2059
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,400
Um,

2060
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:03,320
it's a different animal and my act
is very physical and expressive,

2061
00:56:03,321 --> 00:56:05,360
so it kind of works for
that type of environment.

2062
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:06,201
Uh,

2063
00:56:06,201 --> 00:56:08,690
although you have to listen,

2064
00:56:08,691 --> 00:56:09,860
there's a screen above you,

2065
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:13,940
so people are watching screens
when they go to shows anyway.

2066
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:14,841
Uh,

2067
00:56:14,841 --> 00:56:19,520
but the challenge to do it in the round
is to hit those people within the first

2068
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:23,500
five rows that maybe can't see this
screen because once you go to the side of

2069
00:56:23,501 --> 00:56:24,334
the stage,

2070
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,450
you got your back to them and it's,

2071
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:28,150
it's kind of difficult to you there.

2072
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,100
Yeah.

2073
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,240
Wow,

2074
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,390
that's so crazy.

2075
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,220
That's 18,000 people.

2076
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,440
That's fucking bananas,

2077
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:36,190
Dude.

2078
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:36,641
So yeah,

2079
00:56:36,641 --> 00:56:37,990
it's been for New York.

2080
00:56:38,470 --> 00:56:40,060
New York for me has been really,

2081
00:56:40,061 --> 00:56:41,830
really good to me over the years.

2082
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,340
Um,

2083
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,480
obviously I'm Italian and there's a lot
of Italians in the New York City area.

2084
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:51,900
But what I think has happened is I'm
talking about like family and I'm talking

2085
00:56:52,151 --> 00:56:52,661
about late,

2086
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:54,040
the immigrant experience.

2087
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,340
Uh,

2088
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,260
my father being an immigrant from Sicily.

2089
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:01,800
And what I'm seeing at my shows is
not only an 88 year old grandmother,

2090
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:05,200
but a 12 year old kid and
kind of everybody in between.

2091
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,290
So it's very broad.

2092
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:11,020
It's comedy and I'm not
tooting my own horn here.

2093
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:15,880
I'm just saying it's comedy that you
could come and not cringe because the

2094
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:19,590
material might be a little blue
or what have you and ideas.

2095
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:24,220
Imagine if you had Julie Diaz.

2096
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:24,361
Oh,

2097
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,940
before you amass soccer.

2098
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:30,403
Yeah,

2099
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,740
there'll be a little shocked.

2100
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,670
Oh my God.

2101
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:34,661
So yeah,

2102
00:57:34,661 --> 00:57:38,980
I mean that's why I think I was able to
do four shows at Madison Square Garden

2103
00:57:38,981 --> 00:57:43,981
just because my audience is a
large swath of multigenerational.

2104
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:45,010
Uh,

2105
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:45,880
it's multi generational,

2106
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:49,450
it's just a lot of different
people at the shows and um,

2107
00:57:49,810 --> 00:57:51,430
to do Madison Square Garden for me,

2108
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,770
as we were talking prior
to getting on here,

2109
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:58,390
I was saying that I think I took
a little too much on my plate.

2110
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,530
And what I mean by that is

2111
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:02,800
coming up in comedy,

2112
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:04,930
I used to say yes to everything.

2113
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,380
The phone used to ring and it
was my agent you want to do,

2114
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:08,980
yeah,

2115
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:09,813
put me down.

2116
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,290
I'm in when you're trying to work,

2117
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:15,760
trying to work and what has
happened once you get too busy,

2118
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:16,540
I think,

2119
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:16,751
uh,

2120
00:58:16,751 --> 00:58:19,780
you need to learn to press
the brakes a little bit.

2121
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,591
So,

2122
00:58:20,591 --> 00:58:20,801
uh,

2123
00:58:20,801 --> 00:58:25,801
I did a ton of press when I was in
New York and I had family there,

2124
00:58:25,841 --> 00:58:30,460
I had friends there and I think I
spread myself a little too thin.

2125
00:58:30,461 --> 00:58:32,680
So when the shows came,

2126
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:37,740
I don't feel like I was
operating at an optimal level to,

2127
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:39,370
to perform.

2128
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:39,860
Yeah,

2129
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,020
it was fun.

2130
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,400
I still had a good time.

2131
00:58:42,401 --> 00:58:44,220
But you know,

2132
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,210
the more and more I do
stand up to more and more,

2133
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:51,211
I feel like you really got to be
clearheaded in the moment and you can't,

2134
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,360
you can't overwork yourself.

2135
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,890
It's just who I am.

2136
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,630
I've always been a worker.

2137
00:58:58,631 --> 00:58:59,230
I mean,

2138
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:03,580
when I wasn't going to college
and I had time off in the summer,

2139
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:04,690
I was working,

2140
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:05,591
uh,

2141
00:59:05,591 --> 00:59:06,910
when I,

2142
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:10,300
I used to work summers as a
janitor during high school,

2143
00:59:10,301 --> 00:59:13,990
so all the time was
always occupied with work.

2144
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,030
And I feel if I'm not working,

2145
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:17,050
I feel like,

2146
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:19,390
or I'm not doing press or I'm not doing,

2147
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,593
uh,

2148
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,380
anything,

2149
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:23,630
I feel like I'm slacking.

2150
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:24,410
Yeah.

2151
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:25,243
I feel like,

2152
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:28,100
because my father has
always put it in my head,

2153
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:28,491
you know,

2154
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:28,791
what do you,

2155
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:29,624
what do you,

2156
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:30,591
what are you doing?

2157
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:31,460
Like he'd come home and go,

2158
00:59:31,461 --> 00:59:32,294
what'd you do today?

2159
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,173
And I'm like,

2160
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:37,190
yeah.

2161
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:37,701
It was like,

2162
00:59:37,701 --> 00:59:38,001
all right,

2163
00:59:38,001 --> 00:59:38,241
you know,

2164
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,620
you're going to paint the fence this,

2165
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,454
this weekend,

2166
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:41,463
I'm going to paint the fence.

2167
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:46,610
So there was always something to do and
that work ethic has bled into my career

2168
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:50,630
and now that I've had
some success in my career,

2169
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:55,631
I think I have to kind of pull it back
a little bit and not say yes to an

2170
00:59:56,151 --> 00:59:58,040
interview that maybe,

2171
00:59:58,290 --> 00:59:58,440
you know,

2172
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,191
he's not going to help,

2173
00:59:59,191 --> 01:00:00,570
but he's going to take
up a lot of your time.

2174
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:01,404
Yes,

2175
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,250
exactly.

2176
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:02,481
Yeah.

2177
01:00:02,481 --> 01:00:02,820
No,

2178
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:03,780
I'm in the same boat.

2179
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,261
And,

2180
01:00:04,261 --> 01:00:04,561
uh,

2181
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:04,831
I mean,

2182
01:00:04,831 --> 01:00:07,350
I think sometimes even
I do too many podcasts,

2183
01:00:07,351 --> 01:00:07,801
I think.

2184
01:00:07,801 --> 01:00:08,634
Um,

2185
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,650
but there's a lot of fucking
people I want to talk to,

2186
01:00:10,651 --> 01:00:11,484
so it's hard.

2187
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,241
But I think,

2188
01:00:12,241 --> 01:00:12,710
um,

2189
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,010
I've,

2190
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:16,680
I've definitely stopped doing interviews
and all those different things for that

2191
01:00:16,681 --> 01:00:17,071
reason.

2192
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:20,980
It's just there's only certain
amount of time you have and you know,

2193
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:21,841
like you,

2194
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:22,920
I have a family,

2195
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,521
like you,

2196
01:00:23,521 --> 01:00:26,160
I exercise and I have a lot of hobbies,

2197
01:00:26,161 --> 01:00:26,581
man,

2198
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,730
between archery and martial arts and,

2199
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:34,110
and reading and just watching
documentaries and you know,

2200
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:34,770
it's,

2201
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:35,680
is it going to help?

2202
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,740
Like I don't want to be any more famous,

2203
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:38,280
you know,

2204
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,420
we were talking about this earlier.

2205
01:00:39,421 --> 01:00:40,190
I don't,

2206
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:40,890
it's good.

2207
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:41,723
I'm working.

2208
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:42,683
It's all I want to do.

2209
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,730
What I want to do now is do my best work.

2210
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah.

2211
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,670
That's my number one objective.

2212
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:49,710
Whether it's stand up,

2213
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,690
whether it's UFC commentary,

2214
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,010
whether it's doing a podcast.

2215
01:00:53,011 --> 01:00:57,510
I want to do my best work and I don't
think that I can do my best work if I'm

2216
01:00:57,511 --> 01:00:58,344
scattered.

2217
01:00:58,470 --> 01:00:59,340
And I often am.

2218
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,580
I think you put the,

2219
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:03,060
hit the nail on the head
doing your best work,

2220
01:01:03,061 --> 01:01:04,020
whatever you're doing.

2221
01:01:04,021 --> 01:01:07,620
So if you're kind of come in
here today and do a podcast,

2222
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:12,270
whatever you did prior to this cannot
really take away from the energy that you

2223
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:13,560
need to do this.

2224
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,930
Same thing with the MMA
and then the announcing.

2225
01:01:15,931 --> 01:01:17,580
And the same thing with
the standup comedy.

2226
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:22,610
I feel that sometimes I jeopardize
myself and I take on too much and I've

2227
01:01:24,631 --> 01:01:26,730
realized that and I'm going to kind of,

2228
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,760
cause now I got to fuck
another baby coming.

2229
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:31,290
So thank you.

2230
01:01:31,291 --> 01:01:32,550
Family's growing.

2231
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:33,421
And you know,

2232
01:01:33,421 --> 01:01:35,160
I come home and I'm
looking at my daughter,

2233
01:01:35,161 --> 01:01:36,720
she's 20 months and I mean,

2234
01:01:36,721 --> 01:01:38,430
those moments for me are like,

2235
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:38,820
do I,

2236
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:43,590
do I want to like take my daughter out
for lunch or do I want to do an interview

2237
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,230
in a,

2238
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:46,800
I had a whole know,

2239
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:48,240
I know you've got to sell tickets.

2240
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:49,320
That's part of the game.

2241
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,810
But I think I need to kind of,

2242
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:52,644
uh,

2243
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,570
just choose my,

2244
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,433
my,

2245
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,000
my roads a little careful.

2246
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:57,161
Well,

2247
01:01:57,161 --> 01:02:00,370
that's one of the good things about
social media is that it allows you these

2248
01:02:00,371 --> 01:02:01,160
paths,

2249
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:01,560
uh,

2250
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,800
to distribute,

2251
01:02:02,830 --> 01:02:03,610
you know,

2252
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:07,810
like flyers and you'd put a little posters
of where you're going to be and stuff

2253
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:08,291
like that.

2254
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:12,460
And it can reach your actual
fans as opposed to just,

2255
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,210
you know,

2256
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:15,040
random person who's
listening to the radio.

2257
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,630
A random person picks up the newspaper.

2258
01:02:17,980 --> 01:02:18,910
That's what I think that,

2259
01:02:18,990 --> 01:02:19,280
but,

2260
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:24,280
but I like to reach the person
that doesn't know who I am.

2261
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,790
It's fun to go to your fan base,

2262
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:27,810
but you know,

2263
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:32,280
I'm sure a lot of the people that listen
to your podcast maybe not know who I

2264
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:32,910
am.

2265
01:02:32,910 --> 01:02:37,460
And it's a joy for me to
get someone who is this guy,

2266
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:42,480
maybe check them out and to get a new fan
opposed to maybe feeding the fan base.

2267
01:02:42,571 --> 01:02:43,620
I currently have.

2268
01:02:43,621 --> 01:02:45,120
I'm always looking for new people,

2269
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,640
uh,

2270
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:46,000
to,

2271
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,760
to come on board with what I'm doing.

2272
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:48,241
So,

2273
01:02:48,241 --> 01:02:49,050
uh,

2274
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:49,321
you know,

2275
01:02:49,321 --> 01:02:54,300
when I do a radio show in Peoria
at seven o'clock in the morning,

2276
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,600
I'm hoping someone's in their
car going check 'em out.

2277
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:00,630
Yeah.

2278
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,901
Yeah.

2279
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:03,960
And even if it was two people
that bought the ticket for me,

2280
01:03:03,961 --> 01:03:08,480
I would think that it was worth
it getting up to get to more fans.

2281
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,300
Sometimes though it's it,

2282
01:03:11,301 --> 01:03:11,580
it's,

2283
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,530
it hurts the end product.

2284
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:17,070
And the reason why I'm
here is the standup comedy.

2285
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:20,310
If that starts to slack then
everything else falls apart.

2286
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:21,300
Yeah.

2287
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,210
I feel the same way and I've,

2288
01:03:22,211 --> 01:03:23,870
I've learned over the years what the,

2289
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:26,600
what the mistakes are like
where I can screw it up.

2290
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:28,310
Like podcast for instance.

2291
01:03:28,311 --> 01:03:29,990
I don't do like a,

2292
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,080
I used to do like a hot
yoga class at 10 30.

2293
01:03:33,081 --> 01:03:33,861
It gets out at noon.

2294
01:03:33,861 --> 01:03:35,090
I do a podcast at one.

2295
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:36,051
I can't,

2296
01:03:36,051 --> 01:03:39,770
I don't do that anymore because I found
I was just too fucking worn out cause I

2297
01:03:39,771 --> 01:03:41,570
do a 90 minute yoga class and um,

2298
01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:43,250
I come in here and I'm still like,

2299
01:03:43,251 --> 01:03:43,850
oh yeah,

2300
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:44,250
what,

2301
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:44,630
what do you,

2302
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:45,463
what are we talking about?

2303
01:03:45,470 --> 01:03:46,730
Like I'm still spacey.

2304
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:48,260
I need two hours,

2305
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:51,410
I need two hours and I need to drink a
shit load of water and then I'm good to

2306
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:51,800
go.

2307
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,210
But I need that extra hour.

2308
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,730
So now I'll do like an eight 30
class or something like that,

2309
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:57,470
or maybe even a six in the morning class.

2310
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,840
And so when I have a 1:00 PM podcast,

2311
01:03:59,841 --> 01:04:01,670
I'm fucking completely acclimated.

2312
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:03,180
But I had to do that by trial.

2313
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:04,121
Absolutely.

2314
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:05,080
And that's where I'm at.

2315
01:04:05,081 --> 01:04:06,820
I think I'm trying to figure out what,

2316
01:04:06,850 --> 01:04:08,700
what the balances of,

2317
01:04:08,701 --> 01:04:09,160
of,

2318
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:14,160
of creating a life outside of stand up
and then giving all I can to stand up.

2319
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:17,320
And even I do a podcast,

2320
01:04:17,490 --> 01:04:18,130
uh,

2321
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:20,260
with Pete Cory Alley that,

2322
01:04:20,261 --> 01:04:20,620
uh,

2323
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:23,050
we did a live podcast for the first time.

2324
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:25,180
And I don't know if you've seen this,

2325
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,240
the podcast listener is
a different audience than
what's arriving at my shows to

2326
01:04:32,111 --> 01:04:33,130
different audiences.

2327
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:33,461
There's a,

2328
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:33,940
there's a,

2329
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,960
there's a definite podcast
listener out there.

2330
01:04:37,961 --> 01:04:38,201
I mean,

2331
01:04:38,201 --> 01:04:41,620
people that listen and consume
podcasts and it crosses over,

2332
01:04:41,621 --> 01:04:42,460
don't get me wrong,

2333
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:43,443
but I,

2334
01:04:43,470 --> 01:04:48,100
I went to do the podcast in
Orlando and totally different,

2335
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,390
totally different vibe.

2336
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:53,770
It's nice to see who the hell
is listening to this stuff.

2337
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:54,940
And we did it.

2338
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:57,190
And I don't know if you've
ever done a live cast,

2339
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,150
but I'm sure you're,

2340
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,720
you're,

2341
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:00,850
you're like an anomaly.

2342
01:05:00,851 --> 01:05:01,031
I,

2343
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:04,360
you got like fans from all
different walks of life.

2344
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:04,631
I mean,

2345
01:05:04,631 --> 01:05:06,100
you're in the standup world,

2346
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:06,611
you're in the,

2347
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:06,790
uh,

2348
01:05:06,790 --> 01:05:09,640
mixed martial arts world
here in the podcast world.

2349
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:12,760
So it must be a lot of different
people coming to your shows.

2350
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,320
It was a lot of Weirdos.

2351
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,080
If you see a dude,

2352
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,100
a shaved head

2353
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,890
and tattoos and he's kind of jacked,

2354
01:05:20,530 --> 01:05:21,460
he probably knows who I am.

2355
01:05:23,110 --> 01:05:26,860
But it's like a lot of people that are
into the science podcasts or the F,

2356
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,640
you know,

2357
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,780
podcasts with a interesting intellectual.

2358
01:05:30,781 --> 01:05:31,510
So there's just like,

2359
01:05:31,510 --> 01:05:32,343
there's a lot of,

2360
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:33,303
yeah,

2361
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,940
but there's people that don't like
the mixed martial arts stuff and they,

2362
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:39,040
they like me for other things.

2363
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:39,700
You know,

2364
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:40,031
it's,

2365
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:40,620
it's hard.

2366
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,400
You can't please everybody,

2367
01:05:42,490 --> 01:05:43,270
you know,

2368
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:44,410
it's not really possible.

2369
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,371
And then along the way,

2370
01:05:45,371 --> 01:05:47,560
you find that out and you
piss a bunch of people off.

2371
01:05:48,130 --> 01:05:48,420
You know,

2372
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:48,821
they're like,

2373
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:49,091
you know,

2374
01:05:49,091 --> 01:05:50,410
I don't like that part of you.

2375
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:50,651
Like,

2376
01:05:50,651 --> 01:05:51,484
okay,

2377
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,533
I don't know what to tell you.

2378
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,180
You can't make everybody here know what,

2379
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,600
especially if you do a lot of shit,

2380
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:57,033
you know.

2381
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:57,801
But,

2382
01:05:57,801 --> 01:05:58,360
um,

2383
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,380
I'm lucky with the job with the UFC that
they don't really care about the other

2384
01:06:02,381 --> 01:06:06,550
things that I do because if I was working
for a more sensitive organization,

2385
01:06:06,870 --> 01:06:07,171
you know,

2386
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:09,950
obviously it's a fucking
cage fighting promotion.

2387
01:06:10,260 --> 01:06:12,100
It's like how sensitive can you get,

2388
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:13,930
but with some social issues,

2389
01:06:13,931 --> 01:06:14,200
you know,

2390
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:15,880
it's like if I was working for the NBA,

2391
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:18,130
I probably have been fired a decade ago.

2392
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:19,520
Yeah.

2393
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:20,150
It easily,

2394
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:25,150
the NMA is definitely a or that UFC
is definitely an animal in itself.

2395
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:26,540
How did,

2396
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:29,780
how did you get into that position?

2397
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:34,800
Did you know the Dana White
and you started for you,

2398
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,460
I always wanted to ask you this
and that at the comedy store,

2399
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:40,310
how did you become kind of the voice of,

2400
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:41,273
of the UFC?

2401
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:41,801
Well,

2402
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,820
I started a,

2403
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:45,730
in 1997 I was the post fight interviewer.

2404
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:46,511
That was,

2405
01:06:46,511 --> 01:06:46,840
uh,

2406
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:50,680
it was just a position that was available
in the UFC was very small back then.

2407
01:06:50,681 --> 01:06:52,750
Very few people knew what it was.

2408
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,280
It was off a cable.

2409
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:55,360
You couldn't get it on cable,

2410
01:06:55,361 --> 01:06:56,590
you could only get it on satellite.

2411
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,110
And uh,

2412
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:00,370
they needed someone to
do post fight interviews.

2413
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:02,560
So you were in that world to begin with.

2414
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,000
I was in the martial arts world.

2415
01:07:04,030 --> 01:07:04,530
You know,

2416
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:07,600
I used to teach martial arts for a
living before I became a comedian.

2417
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:09,650
I used to fight a fight in Atlanta,

2418
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:13,540
taekwondo tournaments and had some
kickboxing fights and I'd always been a

2419
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,100
martial artist since I was a kid.

2420
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:16,241
And so,

2421
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:16,630
um,

2422
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:20,920
I just was interested in watching the UFC
and then I started training in Jujitsu

2423
01:07:20,950 --> 01:07:22,210
and when I was training in Jiu Jitsu,

2424
01:07:22,211 --> 01:07:23,044
I was just a white belt,

2425
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:23,883
was just starting out.

2426
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,550
That's when I got hired by the UFC
to be a post fight interviewer.

2427
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,310
But I only did that for
two years and then I quit.

2428
01:07:30,311 --> 01:07:32,830
It was just too much and
it was actually like,

2429
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:33,664
it was,

2430
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:35,050
I was losing money.

2431
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:36,760
I would make more money,

2432
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:37,270
uh,

2433
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:38,740
doing a weekend at a comedy club,

2434
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:40,930
then I would doing it doing the UFC.

2435
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,760
And it just got to a
point where it's just,

2436
01:07:42,761 --> 01:07:43,960
it was too much of a pain in the ass.

2437
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:44,531
And so,

2438
01:07:44,531 --> 01:07:44,711
uh,

2439
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:45,940
I still remained a fan,

2440
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:46,774
but I backed away.

2441
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,680
And then the UFC was purchased by this
company called Zoo Fhfa in 2001 and when

2442
01:07:52,991 --> 01:07:53,950
that happened,

2443
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:54,750
um,

2444
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:56,440
they started putting on shows in Vegas.

2445
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:58,960
I would go there with my friends.

2446
01:07:58,990 --> 01:07:59,950
They got me free tickets,

2447
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:03,520
they reached out and they would try to
get celebrities to go sit there so that

2448
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:04,310
it would,

2449
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,280
cause they were very small at
the time and they were trying,

2450
01:08:06,281 --> 01:08:08,170
they were hemorrhaging money and
they're trying to build it up.

2451
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:11,730
And in talking to Dana White one day he,

2452
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:12,101
you know,

2453
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,380
I was talking to him about fights
going on in Japan and like,

2454
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:15,830
have you ever seen Sato fight?

2455
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:16,711
Do you know what,

2456
01:08:16,711 --> 01:08:17,241
what do you do?

2457
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:17,451
You know,

2458
01:08:17,451 --> 01:08:18,111
soccer rod,

2459
01:08:18,111 --> 01:08:18,321
you know,

2460
01:08:18,321 --> 01:08:19,220
this guy at night.

2461
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,560
And it was bringing all
these names and he was like,

2462
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:22,700
do you want to do commentary?

2463
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:23,001
I'm like,

2464
01:08:23,001 --> 01:08:24,050
I don't want to do commentary,

2465
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:24,231
man.

2466
01:08:24,231 --> 01:08:24,650
I'm,

2467
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:27,280
I'm here to get drunk and watched
people kick the shit out of each other.

2468
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:28,370
I'm not here to work.

2469
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:30,860
And he talked me into it for one show,

2470
01:08:31,130 --> 01:08:33,170
UFC 37 and a half.

2471
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,000
It was a show that was on,

2472
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,620
I'm one of those,

2473
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:36,860
uh,

2474
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:39,290
Fox sports networks,

2475
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:40,430
smaller networks.

2476
01:08:40,430 --> 01:08:41,263
And um,

2477
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:45,140
I think it was the best damn sports
show period was a part of it.

2478
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,120
I did that and the rest is history.

2479
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,820
And then I did like 12 of them for free.

2480
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,590
Like the UFC didn't have any money.

2481
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:52,040
Well,

2482
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,630
they were hemorrhaging money and they had,

2483
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,740
they were rich people that owned it,

2484
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:56,270
but it was not a profitable venture.

2485
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:57,111
And I said,

2486
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:57,560
look,

2487
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,610
just get me there.

2488
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,770
Get me and my friends
tickets and I'll do it.

2489
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:02,810
And so that's how I operated for like,

2490
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:03,321
oh,

2491
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:04,280
like over a year.

2492
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,250
And then I just became the commentator.

2493
01:09:07,630 --> 01:09:08,463
It's just weird.

2494
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,261
That's crazy.

2495
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:10,130
It's just Dana White,

2496
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:10,671
he's,

2497
01:09:10,671 --> 01:09:12,590
he's a crazy man and he's a,

2498
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,100
he's got a weird way of
looking at things that,

2499
01:09:15,101 --> 01:09:16,100
that's very effective.

2500
01:09:16,101 --> 01:09:18,140
And in his crazy mind,

2501
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:18,681
he's like,

2502
01:09:18,681 --> 01:09:22,550
let's take this guy who's never even
thought about being a commentator and make

2503
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:23,360
them our commentator.

2504
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:23,571
I mean,

2505
01:09:23,571 --> 01:09:25,280
I didn't know what the fuck I was doing.

2506
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:25,911
I mean,

2507
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:26,570
I really didn't,

2508
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:29,960
I didn't have any training
at all in sports commentary.

2509
01:09:30,230 --> 01:09:33,290
I just would see what was happening
and start talking about it,

2510
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,041
you know,

2511
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:35,990
which is really like the wrong,

2512
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:39,380
I was more even play by play and color.

2513
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:41,090
It was like doing both
of them at the same time.

2514
01:09:41,091 --> 01:09:41,924
It was really weird.

2515
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,940
And as far as you doing that,

2516
01:09:43,941 --> 01:09:48,410
do you get any notes from anybody going,

2517
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:49,161
hey Joe,

2518
01:09:49,161 --> 01:09:50,030
a try this,

2519
01:09:50,031 --> 01:09:51,980
try to add or you just develop that whole,

2520
01:09:51,981 --> 01:09:53,510
that voice all on your own?

2521
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:54,620
100% of my own.

2522
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:57,350
So the only thing that I had was,

2523
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,070
uh,

2524
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:59,700
there's like mark della grotto,

2525
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:00,620
who's a good friend of mine.

2526
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:01,161
He is,

2527
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:01,790
um,

2528
01:10:01,790 --> 01:10:02,091
he's,

2529
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:02,800
uh,

2530
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,400
one of the top trainers in the world.

2531
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:06,340
He's in the truck and uh,

2532
01:10:06,341 --> 01:10:07,520
I can communicate with him.

2533
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:11,060
There's a button where I can communicate
with him and we talk about stuff like I

2534
01:10:11,061 --> 01:10:11,720
can say,

2535
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:11,970
uh,

2536
01:10:11,970 --> 01:10:13,370
does he look like he's limping to you?

2537
01:10:13,371 --> 01:10:13,761
And he's like,

2538
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:13,911
yeah,

2539
01:10:13,911 --> 01:10:14,780
there's something wrong with his leg.

2540
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:15,531
I go to the left leg,

2541
01:10:15,531 --> 01:10:15,741
right?

2542
01:10:15,741 --> 01:10:15,951
He's like,

2543
01:10:15,951 --> 01:10:16,231
yeah,

2544
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:16,610
yeah.

2545
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,780
And then I'll start talking about it.

2546
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:18,001
Like I'll,

2547
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:19,670
I'll be able to bounce it
back and forth with him.

2548
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,230
Or sometimes I just,

2549
01:10:21,231 --> 01:10:22,760
it's obvious and I'll say it myself,

2550
01:10:22,761 --> 01:10:23,150
then I'll,

2551
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:24,860
I'll ask him like it,

2552
01:10:24,861 --> 01:10:25,531
am I wrong?

2553
01:10:25,531 --> 01:10:27,830
Is he dropped in his hand or is this like,

2554
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,061
is a nice,

2555
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:31,280
it's a nice thing to have
someone to bounce things off.

2556
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,390
It used to be Eddie Bravo,

2557
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:33,680
Eddie Bravo used to do it as well,

2558
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:34,723
where I would uh,

2559
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,820
be able to talk to him about certain
positions because he would be in the truck

2560
01:10:38,210 --> 01:10:40,040
and I'd be able to ask him like,

2561
01:10:40,100 --> 01:10:40,640
uh,

2562
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,500
which his left leg is
in jeopardy right now.

2563
01:10:42,501 --> 01:10:42,741
Right.

2564
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:44,510
Or He needs to step
over with his right leg.

2565
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:48,680
We'd be able to go over because it's
like there's some aspects of martial arts

2566
01:10:48,681 --> 01:10:50,210
that are extremely technical,

2567
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:51,410
especially Jujitsu.

2568
01:10:51,590 --> 01:10:55,160
When things go to the ground and you're
trying to commentary do commentary.

2569
01:10:55,161 --> 01:10:57,530
And I have to decipher
which is his left leg,

2570
01:10:57,531 --> 01:10:58,430
which is his right leg,

2571
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,511
where is he tied up?

2572
01:10:59,511 --> 01:11:00,344
Where's he tangled?

2573
01:11:00,380 --> 01:11:03,560
And I'm doing it in real time while I'm
trying to be entertaining and talking.

2574
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:04,490
It's very complicated,

2575
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:05,120
you know,

2576
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,470
but nobody taught me how to do it.

2577
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:07,550
I just figured out how to do it.

2578
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,880
And you're not looking at it like,

2579
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:09,360
uh,

2580
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:09,510
uh,

2581
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:14,510
Jim Lampley or anybody in the
broadcasting world when it comes to of it.

2582
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,100
This is something that
you developed on your own.

2583
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:18,990
Like sometimes you look
at it as a comedian,

2584
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:20,430
you look at other Comedians,

2585
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,100
say the priors are Carlin's or whatnot.

2586
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:24,480
Do you didn't have the kind of like a,

2587
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:25,553
a mentor?

2588
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:26,401
No,

2589
01:11:26,401 --> 01:11:29,580
not necessarily because there wasn't one.

2590
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:30,360
Um,

2591
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:33,520
there wasn't a lot of guys that did it in,

2592
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:36,120
in for martial arts commentary.

2593
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:37,261
There was,

2594
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:37,890
um,

2595
01:11:37,890 --> 01:11:39,780
John Perretti who was excellent.

2596
01:11:39,781 --> 01:11:43,770
He was one of the very best who was
actually the UFC matchmaker and a

2597
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:45,510
commentator when I first started.

2598
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:46,710
He was very good.

2599
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:47,431
Uh,

2600
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:48,720
there's a guy named Jeff Armstrong.

2601
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:49,710
He was very good too.

2602
01:11:49,711 --> 01:11:51,060
He was there when I first started to,

2603
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,310
he actually ran a promotion
called Hook and shoot.

2604
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:54,210
He's excellent.

2605
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:55,560
He really knows what he's doing.

2606
01:11:55,890 --> 01:11:57,240
And then there's a few other guys,

2607
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,571
you know,

2608
01:11:57,571 --> 01:11:57,661
the,

2609
01:11:57,661 --> 01:11:58,770
that also did it,

2610
01:11:58,771 --> 01:12:03,390
but there's like what I do
as far as like Stan doing,

2611
01:12:03,391 --> 01:12:03,870
um,

2612
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:04,230
uh,

2613
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,430
commentary for MMA.

2614
01:12:05,431 --> 01:12:07,680
There's might maybe 10
guys in the world to do it.

2615
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:08,010
Yeah.

2616
01:12:08,010 --> 01:12:08,281
You know,

2617
01:12:08,281 --> 01:12:10,140
that really do it on a high level.

2618
01:12:10,230 --> 01:12:11,190
Maybe 10 guys.

2619
01:12:11,250 --> 01:12:11,880
Whoa.

2620
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:12,121
I mean,

2621
01:12:12,121 --> 01:12:13,410
between one FC,

2622
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:14,161
uh,

2623
01:12:14,161 --> 01:12:14,850
between,

2624
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:15,510
um,

2625
01:12:15,510 --> 01:12:16,290
you know,

2626
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:16,680
uh,

2627
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:21,680
brave and then the UFC Bella
tour PFL there's maybe,

2628
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,750
maybe 10 guys on the
planet that are doing it.

2629
01:12:25,320 --> 01:12:28,350
She's not a lot of people and
there's a lot in the UFC now.

2630
01:12:28,351 --> 01:12:32,220
We're fighters are now transitioning
to become commentators and oftentimes

2631
01:12:32,221 --> 01:12:33,054
they're the best at it.

2632
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:35,190
Like Michael Bisping just
did this past weekend.

2633
01:12:35,191 --> 01:12:37,860
He was the UFC middleweight champion
and he's awesome at it already did.

2634
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:39,150
One one show,

2635
01:12:39,570 --> 01:12:41,820
they know more obviously
because they've been in there,

2636
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:42,370
you know,

2637
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:42,750
they've,

2638
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:46,140
they have that added element of
actually having fought in the UFC,

2639
01:12:46,141 --> 01:12:47,490
which is gigantic.

2640
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:48,661
Yeah.

2641
01:12:48,661 --> 01:12:49,321
I could see,

2642
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:49,860
uh,

2643
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:52,530
I think Pauline [inaudible]
Mala noche he can,

2644
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,030
he seems to be very,

2645
01:12:54,031 --> 01:12:54,864
very noticeable.

2646
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:55,130
Yeah.

2647
01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:56,030
He's very good.

2648
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:56,691
He's very good,

2649
01:12:56,691 --> 01:12:57,830
very technical,

2650
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:02,600
but also very aware and fighters can
see things that maybe the average person

2651
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:03,231
can't see.

2652
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,150
Like they see when someone's slowing down,

2653
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:06,620
they see when someone's laying back,

2654
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:08,510
they see when someone
got hurt to the body,

2655
01:13:08,511 --> 01:13:11,630
they see like little things that may
be a person who's never fought before.

2656
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:12,464
It doesn't say,

2657
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,011
yeah,

2658
01:13:13,011 --> 01:13:13,940
the knowledge is key.

2659
01:13:13,941 --> 01:13:14,691
And plus the,

2660
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:14,781
uh,

2661
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:15,980
the excitement level too.

2662
01:13:15,981 --> 01:13:16,430
I mean,

2663
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:16,731
when,

2664
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:21,110
when someone gets hit for the announcer
to like react to that and in a real way

2665
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:22,551
for,

2666
01:13:22,551 --> 01:13:23,630
for an audience member,

2667
01:13:23,631 --> 01:13:23,991
it's like,

2668
01:13:23,991 --> 01:13:24,520
you know,

2669
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:24,810
it's,

2670
01:13:24,810 --> 01:13:25,570
it's exciting.

2671
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:26,160
Yeah.

2672
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:26,260
No,

2673
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:27,093
that's what's up.

2674
01:13:27,220 --> 01:13:27,580
Yeah.

2675
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:28,061
Like when,

2676
01:13:28,061 --> 01:13:31,370
so if someone's boring and bland and
they don't really care what's going on in

2677
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,810
the audience feels it and they
feel it when you're faking it too.

2678
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:34,150
Yeah.

2679
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:36,070
If you try to pump it up and fake it.

2680
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:39,700
Do you have any other hobbies
outside of a comedy and,

2681
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:40,920
um,

2682
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:42,180
I'm not a big hobby guy.

2683
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:43,201
Growing up,

2684
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:44,610
my parents always used to say,

2685
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:45,170
d did,

2686
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,410
what are you interested in?

2687
01:13:46,411 --> 01:13:47,660
Do you do anything?

2688
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,520
So I gotta be happy now.

2689
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:51,410
Yeah,

2690
01:13:51,410 --> 01:13:52,370
no shit.

2691
01:13:52,410 --> 01:13:52,620
Look,

2692
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,453
it worked out.

2693
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:56,340
My hobby is a standup comedy really.

2694
01:13:56,341 --> 01:13:56,761
I mean,

2695
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:57,360
um,

2696
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:58,141
I like to cook,

2697
01:13:58,141 --> 01:13:58,974
don't get me wrong.

2698
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:00,270
I like to travel.

2699
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:01,351
Um,

2700
01:14:01,351 --> 01:14:02,220
my wife and I really,

2701
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:04,320
really enjoy going to different places.

2702
01:14:04,321 --> 01:14:04,591
And,

2703
01:14:04,591 --> 01:14:04,950
uh,

2704
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,330
I love hotels.

2705
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:07,150
It's a,

2706
01:14:07,150 --> 01:14:07,550
I mean,

2707
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:08,610
these aren't really hobbies.

2708
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:09,444
It's just a,

2709
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:12,220
I like hospitality.

2710
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,200
So that's my,

2711
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,880
that's my passion.

2712
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:16,960
Uh,

2713
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:21,960
I like having people over at the
house and I'm making them feel good.

2714
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:22,980
That's,

2715
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:23,920
that's what I like to do.

2716
01:14:23,950 --> 01:14:25,060
I like to entertain.

2717
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:25,983
Um,

2718
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:29,890
if I find out you like a specific
drink or you like something that's,

2719
01:14:29,891 --> 01:14:30,724
uh,

2720
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:31,241
you know,

2721
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:31,321
I,

2722
01:14:31,321 --> 01:14:31,901
I take,

2723
01:14:31,901 --> 01:14:33,730
I take notice of what people like.

2724
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,440
So when you come to my house,

2725
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:36,880
I got what you like there.

2726
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,930
That's very talented,

2727
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:39,053
very,

2728
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:40,240
very Italian.

2729
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:41,681
And,

2730
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:42,514
um,

2731
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,540
I've always had,

2732
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:43,721
you know,

2733
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:46,300
I worked for the Four Seasons Hotel and a,

2734
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:49,900
that chain taught me to
anticipate people's needs.

2735
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:53,140
So anytime I have anything at my house,

2736
01:14:53,141 --> 01:14:54,610
whether it be a birthday party,

2737
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:55,540
get together,

2738
01:14:55,541 --> 01:14:56,800
if it's going to be a fight,

2739
01:14:56,830 --> 01:15:01,830
I make sure when you come over you are
taking care of not only with your alcohol

2740
01:15:03,341 --> 01:15:03,970
needs.

2741
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:04,750
Here's one.

2742
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:05,890
I ain't a punt gay.

2743
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:06,610
Right?

2744
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:06,911
I don't,

2745
01:15:06,911 --> 01:15:07,780
I don't smoke pot.

2746
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:09,683
We want to start,

2747
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:10,563
listen,

2748
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:18,000
but I ain't got pot at the house
just in case you want some really?

2749
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:19,990
So I thought,

2750
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:20,500
you know,

2751
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,520
you have alcohol,

2752
01:15:21,521 --> 01:15:22,390
you have beer,

2753
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,560
you have scotch,

2754
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,394
you have wine.

2755
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:25,720
So what if,

2756
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:30,130
what if someone doesn't have a taste
for alcohol and they want a joint?

2757
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:31,901
Wow.

2758
01:15:31,901 --> 01:15:33,250
I've got a couple of joints.

2759
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:34,480
We get it from PDC,

2760
01:15:34,481 --> 01:15:35,231
from the comedy store.

2761
01:15:35,231 --> 01:15:36,430
I think I got it from,

2762
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:37,111
you know,

2763
01:15:37,111 --> 01:15:37,944
from

2764
01:15:38,930 --> 01:15:39,250
though,

2765
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,083
I think it's the,

2766
01:15:40,090 --> 01:15:42,010
what's the Med med men.

2767
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:42,700
Yeah.

2768
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:43,540
I went in there.

2769
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:46,120
We went in there specifically
just for hospitality.

2770
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:47,350
Hospitality.

2771
01:15:49,300 --> 01:15:51,580
If you came over and I go,

2772
01:15:51,581 --> 01:15:51,851
Joe,

2773
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:53,080
you want to join and be like,

2774
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:53,291
hey,

2775
01:15:53,291 --> 01:15:53,840
you want to smoke?

2776
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:53,971
No,

2777
01:15:53,971 --> 01:15:54,540
I don't smoke.

2778
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:55,300
But you know,

2779
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:59,020
there have an edit just to have,

2780
01:15:59,080 --> 01:15:59,913
uh,

2781
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,630
even as the guy got cigars.

2782
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:02,890
I don't smoke cigars.

2783
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:03,724
You want one?

2784
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:05,943
I,

2785
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:08,771
I dunno.

2786
01:16:08,771 --> 01:16:09,550
I get,

2787
01:16:09,550 --> 01:16:13,330
I get joy in making others happy.

2788
01:16:13,430 --> 01:16:14,810
So when you looked at your house,

2789
01:16:14,811 --> 01:16:16,040
did you look at your house and go,

2790
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:17,690
this is a good house to entertain in?

2791
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,060
Ah,

2792
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:19,580
yeah,

2793
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:20,413
we see that.

2794
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:23,370
Like when you see like a youtube video
and a home and they're showing the home.

2795
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:25,370
So a wonderful entertainers home,

2796
01:16:25,371 --> 01:16:26,400
like an entertainer's home.

2797
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:27,561
What does that mean?

2798
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:28,394
A Sanger

2799
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:30,140
guys playing the piano.

2800
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:30,950
It was,

2801
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:31,310
I mean,

2802
01:16:31,310 --> 01:16:31,790
I like,

2803
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:34,670
I like a living room that
bleeds into the kitchen.

2804
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:35,331
All right.

2805
01:16:35,331 --> 01:16:35,751
That's,

2806
01:16:35,751 --> 01:16:36,290
that's,

2807
01:16:36,290 --> 01:16:37,123
I like that,

2808
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:38,300
right?

2809
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,170
There's not really a,

2810
01:16:39,171 --> 01:16:39,431
a,

2811
01:16:39,431 --> 01:16:41,000
a wall in between the two.

2812
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:41,661
It's got to be,

2813
01:16:41,661 --> 01:16:43,250
and then I like indoor outdoor.

2814
01:16:43,251 --> 01:16:44,300
He live in California.

2815
01:16:44,301 --> 01:16:46,670
I liked it outside.

2816
01:16:46,671 --> 01:16:49,910
Maybe you want to have a drink
outside and bring it back in.

2817
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:52,100
Just like the different,

2818
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:52,880
that's what they want.

2819
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,460
That's what they're talking
about when it's there.

2820
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:56,130
I like a fire outside.

2821
01:16:56,180 --> 01:16:56,511
Oh,

2822
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:57,090
fire,

2823
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:57,381
fire,

2824
01:16:57,381 --> 01:16:57,990
pit,

2825
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,823
fire pit.

2826
01:16:59,290 --> 01:17:01,090
Do you try to bring people,

2827
01:17:01,091 --> 01:17:01,990
like if you have a party,

2828
01:17:01,991 --> 01:17:03,910
do you try to bring people over that
you think would have interesting

2829
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:04,744
conversations?

2830
01:17:05,250 --> 01:17:06,083
Yes.

2831
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:06,750
Um,

2832
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:10,430
although we have a problem
at this particular point,

2833
01:17:10,431 --> 01:17:12,020
we're in a transition period.

2834
01:17:12,070 --> 01:17:12,903
Um,

2835
01:17:13,190 --> 01:17:14,480
we have a child,

2836
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,550
so I don't know if you went through this,

2837
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:18,200
but a lot of,

2838
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:18,560
uh,

2839
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,000
sometimes when you're coming from s on a
single couple but a couple with no kids

2840
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,080
and now you have kids,

2841
01:17:24,081 --> 01:17:24,650
now you're,

2842
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,650
you're finding other people who have kids.

2843
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:28,520
Right?

2844
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:29,480
So that's what we're in.

2845
01:17:29,481 --> 01:17:30,314
We're a,

2846
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,600
we're not yet into the preschool.

2847
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:33,471
Uh,

2848
01:17:33,471 --> 01:17:34,940
so we're kind of in limbo.

2849
01:17:34,941 --> 01:17:39,290
We're looking for new friends
that are old friends are,

2850
01:17:39,650 --> 01:17:40,310
are bad.

2851
01:17:40,310 --> 01:17:43,310
It's just now we have other obligations.

2852
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:44,150
We have a child,

2853
01:17:44,151 --> 01:17:44,690
we can't,

2854
01:17:44,690 --> 01:17:49,130
we maybe can't go out at the dinner at
eight o'clock at night like we used to

2855
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:49,460
now.

2856
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,070
Now we're looking to
bring it to the house.

2857
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:52,561
Yeah,

2858
01:17:52,561 --> 01:17:52,741
no,

2859
01:17:52,741 --> 01:17:53,820
I know exactly what you're saying.

2860
01:17:53,821 --> 01:17:57,180
We went through that exact same transition
and a lot of times you pick up some

2861
01:17:57,181 --> 01:17:57,930
dead weight along.

2862
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:58,763
No Way.

2863
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,370
You run into these people and the only
thing they have in common is the kids are

2864
01:18:02,371 --> 01:18:05,250
the same age and then you have
to talk to some fucking guy.

2865
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:06,421
Oh.

2866
01:18:06,421 --> 01:18:09,960
And they give you ear beatings about
their job and just like [inaudible] just

2867
01:18:10,230 --> 01:18:11,460
some people just not interesting.

2868
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,353
It's unfortunate.

2869
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:12,921
Yeah.

2870
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:16,100
I mean you do run into
that where you meet a guy,

2871
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:17,660
like I went to a toddler group,

2872
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,080
uh,

2873
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:18,913
last week.

2874
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:19,520
Now some,

2875
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,790
sometimes I do this obviously because
I want to hang out with my daughter.

2876
01:18:22,791 --> 01:18:27,791
But sometimes the material that comes on
at going to something like that is gold

2877
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:34,210
now lets me 15 women and a
gay guy at this toddler group.

2878
01:18:36,441 --> 01:18:37,010
Right.

2879
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:39,710
So I mean it's just like,

2880
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:40,880
it's almost writing.

2881
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:42,470
It's like writes itself.

2882
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:43,680
Although I'm in a,

2883
01:18:43,681 --> 01:18:48,320
in a circle sitting Indian style,

2884
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:48,740
hell,

2885
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,200
I,

2886
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:49,850
it's,

2887
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:51,410
it's strange,

2888
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:52,191
but man,

2889
01:18:52,191 --> 01:18:53,024
it's,

2890
01:18:54,030 --> 01:18:59,030
that's the things I want to do because
I feel if I live more of my life,

2891
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,600
I could draw so much more humor from it.

2892
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:03,750
It's,

2893
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,221
it's a,

2894
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:04,611
it's,

2895
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:04,991
it's,

2896
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:05,870
it's two pronged.

2897
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:06,290
It's,

2898
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,660
I want to hang out with
my family and I want to,

2899
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:12,260
I don't want to talk to people who are
living these life experiences because

2900
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:17,261
what I've noticed is I want to keep the
same kind of lifestyle I've had when I

2901
01:19:18,531 --> 01:19:21,050
wasn't successful because I feel the one,

2902
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:25,070
you start detaching yourself
from the daily routine,

2903
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,630
let's say even going to target.

2904
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,450
If you have somebody go to target for you,

2905
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:29,901
you don't,

2906
01:19:29,901 --> 01:19:34,901
you miss out on like what happens on a
day to day and I want to still keep that

2907
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:35,751
rich and,

2908
01:19:35,751 --> 01:19:36,584
and,

2909
01:19:36,770 --> 01:19:37,551
and uh,

2910
01:19:37,551 --> 01:19:38,384
available to me.

2911
01:19:38,450 --> 01:19:39,680
That's very wise of you.

2912
01:19:39,710 --> 01:19:40,610
That's very true.

2913
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,330
That is something that happens when
people become more and more famous,

2914
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:47,990
especially they become more
reluctant to go places.

2915
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:48,940
Like they just,

2916
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:50,540
they don't want to just go to the mall,

2917
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:51,140
you know,

2918
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:52,910
like sometimes you just
got to go to the mall.

2919
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:53,660
Yeah.

2920
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,171
It's good.

2921
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:54,471
It's good.

2922
01:19:54,471 --> 01:19:55,640
It's good around Weirdos.

2923
01:19:55,641 --> 01:19:55,860
It's

2924
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,693
good.

2925
01:19:58,220 --> 01:19:58,371
Well,

2926
01:19:58,371 --> 01:19:59,151
I think it was you.

2927
01:19:59,151 --> 01:19:59,391
Yeah,

2928
01:19:59,391 --> 01:20:03,050
it was you saying that like if you were
out at a restaurant and somebody comes

2929
01:20:03,051 --> 01:20:07,290
up to you and asked for a picture because
everybody wants a picture nowadays the

2930
01:20:07,380 --> 01:20:07,891
to approve,

2931
01:20:07,891 --> 01:20:09,190
they met Joe Rogan and,

2932
01:20:09,191 --> 01:20:10,680
and what have you.

2933
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:13,650
And sometimes it's a little intrusive
when you're having dinner with your

2934
01:20:13,651 --> 01:20:15,090
daughters or your family.

2935
01:20:15,091 --> 01:20:15,930
And then it's like,

2936
01:20:15,950 --> 01:20:16,350
you know,

2937
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:20,820
I've had people ask me for pictures when
my daughter's on my lap and I'm feeding

2938
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:21,100
her.

2939
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:21,933
Yeah,

2940
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:22,950
look man,

2941
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:23,783
you can't,

2942
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,140
you gotta get the fuck out of here.

2943
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,450
The problem is you take that picture
with that guy and then someone says,

2944
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:30,721
oh,

2945
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:31,410
I want a picture too.

2946
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:34,260
And then you get 10 people to
get up and it sounds braggy,

2947
01:20:34,261 --> 01:20:35,041
but it's not,

2948
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:35,401
it's just,

2949
01:20:35,401 --> 01:20:37,440
it's a weird thing that happens
with people with phones.

2950
01:20:37,710 --> 01:20:39,540
Half those people don't
even give a fuck about you.

2951
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,510
They really just want to take a
picture with someone that they saw,

2952
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:42,961
you know,

2953
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:44,790
on fear factor whenever and they just,

2954
01:20:44,820 --> 01:20:45,031
Oh,

2955
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:45,511
there he is.

2956
01:20:45,511 --> 01:20:46,380
Let me take a picture with them.

2957
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:50,490
And they'd come over to your table and
they seem to think that it's part of the

2958
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:52,290
job that you have to be,

2959
01:20:52,291 --> 01:20:53,220
every time you're in public,

2960
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:54,540
you have to be available to them.

2961
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:57,390
It's very weird like brule
that people have decided,

2962
01:20:57,391 --> 01:21:00,300
some fairly ignorant people have decided.

2963
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,050
So that's why they would think that
even with my daughter on my lap,

2964
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:05,030
and I'm literally,

2965
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,431
but this was,

2966
01:21:05,431 --> 01:21:08,610
I was literally putting food into
her mouth and a guy was like,

2967
01:21:08,611 --> 01:21:08,941
hey man,

2968
01:21:08,941 --> 01:21:09,774
can I get a picture?

2969
01:21:10,630 --> 01:21:11,430
Like this is,

2970
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:12,690
this is not a good time.

2971
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,470
It's not a good,

2972
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,180
this is not a smart thing to ask.

2973
01:21:15,181 --> 01:21:16,800
And it's why people,

2974
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:19,380
certain people are reluctant
to go out in the first place,

2975
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,300
why they're reluctant to go on public.

2976
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,790
But do you feel an obligation to at
all to your fan base to make yourself

2977
01:21:28,061 --> 01:21:29,140
available to them?

2978
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:30,003
If,

2979
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:31,540
if I'm not with my kids?

2980
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:31,910
Yeah.

2981
01:21:31,910 --> 01:21:32,200
Yeah.

2982
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,460
So do you do generally turn
down any photos or autographs?

2983
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:37,150
It has to

2984
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,400
be an extenuating
circumstance for me to say no,

2985
01:21:39,530 --> 01:21:40,720
but there has to be something wrong.

2986
01:21:40,721 --> 01:21:40,900
Like,

2987
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:41,733
if someone,

2988
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:42,940
you know,

2989
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:45,760
if someone is somewhere where
they're not supposed to be,

2990
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:46,211
you know,

2991
01:21:46,211 --> 01:21:46,540
like,

2992
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:49,780
like I had a guy come
backstage at the comedy store,

2993
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:50,290
what made,

2994
01:21:50,290 --> 01:21:52,270
made it backstage all the way to the back.

2995
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,230
And uh,

2996
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:53,531
he's,

2997
01:21:53,531 --> 01:21:55,240
he's talking and I'm like,

2998
01:21:55,241 --> 01:21:55,510
dude,

2999
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:56,400
I was asked the other times,

3000
01:21:56,420 --> 01:21:56,681
you know,

3001
01:21:56,681 --> 01:21:57,020
this guy,

3002
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,210
do you know if the guy who is guy,

3003
01:21:58,600 --> 01:21:58,841
I go,

3004
01:21:58,841 --> 01:21:59,674
who are you man?

3005
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:01,480
And he's like,

3006
01:22:01,481 --> 01:22:01,661
Oh,

3007
01:22:01,661 --> 01:22:03,130
I'm friends with this guy.

3008
01:22:03,310 --> 01:22:03,730
I go see,

3009
01:22:03,730 --> 01:22:04,810
just walked back here.

3010
01:22:05,140 --> 01:22:05,411
I'm like,

3011
01:22:05,411 --> 01:22:06,490
you gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

3012
01:22:06,730 --> 01:22:07,160
Like,

3013
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:07,993
get Outta here man.

3014
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:09,930
And then the security
comes and kicks the guy.

3015
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:10,241
I'm like,

3016
01:22:10,241 --> 01:22:11,290
what is happening here?

3017
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:11,701
Like this,

3018
01:22:11,701 --> 01:22:12,790
there's no security here.

3019
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,950
Like that guy didn't ask for a photo,

3020
01:22:14,951 --> 01:22:15,461
but if he did,

3021
01:22:15,461 --> 01:22:16,294
I probably,

3022
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,580
I probably take a picture
with that motherfucker,

3023
01:22:18,581 --> 01:22:20,680
but I'd probably take a
picture with them out there.

3024
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:22,301
You know,

3025
01:22:22,301 --> 01:22:23,134
it's,

3026
01:22:23,410 --> 01:22:26,440
if you're in a rush for trying to go
somewhere and you're literally running and

3027
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:28,030
someone wants to pull their phone out,

3028
01:22:28,031 --> 01:22:28,930
like sometimes you can't.

3029
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:30,280
But most of the time,

3030
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:31,330
if I'm by myself,

3031
01:22:31,331 --> 01:22:32,200
I'm very approachable.

3032
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:32,740
Yeah,

3033
01:22:32,740 --> 01:22:34,270
it's just family stuff.

3034
01:22:34,271 --> 01:22:36,280
It's just like my kids don't like it.

3035
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:37,750
Like especially my youngest daughter.

3036
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:38,770
She does not like it.

3037
01:22:38,771 --> 01:22:39,604
She gets angry.

3038
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:43,450
She squeezes my hand because people ignore
her and they just start talking to me

3039
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:46,330
and she just standing there and
eight year olds have zero patients.

3040
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:47,680
She sitting there going,

3041
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:48,514
boom,

3042
01:22:49,570 --> 01:22:50,620
she doesn't give a fuck.

3043
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,150
If they know me like to her,

3044
01:22:52,151 --> 01:22:54,910
I'm just dad and know like it
doesn't matter if I'm famous,

3045
01:22:54,911 --> 01:22:56,050
it doesn't mean anything to her.

3046
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,300
What it means to her is
like when she's with me,

3047
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,710
she likes attention.

3048
01:22:59,711 --> 01:23:01,240
She wants me to talk to her about stuff.

3049
01:23:01,241 --> 01:23:02,860
We have a nice little relationship.

3050
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:03,490
Yeah.

3051
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:05,110
I love having little people.

3052
01:23:05,470 --> 01:23:06,280
It's fun.

3053
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:07,030
It's like it's,

3054
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:07,863
it's a,

3055
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:12,640
it's a for people that are single and I
think it all depends on where you are in

3056
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:15,210
life and you know how
reflective you are about it.

3057
01:23:15,230 --> 01:23:16,300
For people that are single,

3058
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:16,950
they look at at,

3059
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,040
and I know I did,

3060
01:23:18,340 --> 01:23:20,380
they look at it as a potential burden.

3061
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:23,110
Cause when I was a kid I
thought of myself as a burden.

3062
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:26,080
So I think of other children as a burden,

3063
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:27,780
but then you have them yourself.

3064
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:28,240
And this,

3065
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:31,120
the love that you have
with them is indescribable.

3066
01:23:31,121 --> 01:23:34,210
It's just crazy feeling that you didn't,

3067
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,420
didn't even know was in the,

3068
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:38,020
the menu before.

3069
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:41,200
And then all of a sudden you have this
crazy feeling to this little person.

3070
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:42,610
It's your favorite thing to do.

3071
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:43,571
Yeah,

3072
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:44,410
it is amazing.

3073
01:23:44,411 --> 01:23:46,480
And then to echo those thoughts,

3074
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:47,020
uh,

3075
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:48,400
I wasn't a big kid guy.

3076
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:48,971
I was like,

3077
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:51,430
I don't really need
kids and this and that.

3078
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:53,530
But then you have them and you're like,

3079
01:23:53,531 --> 01:23:54,190
man,

3080
01:23:54,190 --> 01:23:59,190
what a missing this would be if you go
through life and you don't have a child.

3081
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:00,061
And,

3082
01:24:00,061 --> 01:24:00,910
and I'm just,

3083
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,880
I'm not saying you need to
have a child to be complete,

3084
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:04,720
but for me,

3085
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:05,553
man,

3086
01:24:06,100 --> 01:24:06,640
it's been,

3087
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:07,930
it's been fantastic.

3088
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,411
Uh,

3089
01:24:08,411 --> 01:24:09,041
and uh,

3090
01:24:09,041 --> 01:24:09,251
you know,

3091
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:12,460
having a baby boy and I'll
come in on the way is a,

3092
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:13,303
you know,

3093
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,441
it's great.

3094
01:24:14,441 --> 01:24:14,711
I mean,

3095
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:15,580
it's not a burden.

3096
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:16,141
It's,

3097
01:24:16,141 --> 01:24:17,230
it just adds to your life.

3098
01:24:17,231 --> 01:24:17,531
Yeah.

3099
01:24:17,531 --> 01:24:17,861
It's,

3100
01:24:17,861 --> 01:24:18,280
it's,

3101
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,780
it's responsibility.

3102
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,910
It's so overwhelming responsibility.

3103
01:24:22,180 --> 01:24:22,631
I mean,

3104
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:23,830
it's not about you,

3105
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:24,760
it's about them.

3106
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:25,511
And,

3107
01:24:25,511 --> 01:24:26,344
uh,

3108
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:27,060
you know,

3109
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:28,690
you have to have a sense of,

3110
01:24:28,691 --> 01:24:29,524
um,

3111
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:35,160
I don't know why you got to give them
the time they need in order for them to

3112
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:37,420
succeed in life.

3113
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:37,901
And,

3114
01:24:37,901 --> 01:24:38,734
uh,

3115
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:39,131
you know,

3116
01:24:39,131 --> 01:24:40,230
my parents gave me,

3117
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:41,590
gave me a lot of attention.

3118
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:41,890
I mean,

3119
01:24:41,890 --> 01:24:43,270
my dad was the type of guy that,

3120
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:43,720
uh,

3121
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:47,740
was not really around because
he was working and my mom
was kind of managing the

3122
01:24:47,741 --> 01:24:48,300
house.

3123
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:49,133
Um,

3124
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,290
but over the course of,

3125
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:50,951
of time,

3126
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:52,720
my father and I become best friends.

3127
01:24:52,721 --> 01:24:53,291
I mean,

3128
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:53,710
uh,

3129
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:54,510
you know,

3130
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:55,030
he's,

3131
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:57,700
he's a huge critic of
what I do for a living.

3132
01:24:57,730 --> 01:25:00,490
I don't know if you have parents that
are heavily involved in your career,

3133
01:25:00,491 --> 01:25:01,001
but man,

3134
01:25:01,001 --> 01:25:01,834
my father,

3135
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:03,761
he's,

3136
01:25:03,761 --> 01:25:03,940
you know,

3137
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:04,630
he comes to,

3138
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:05,970
he comes to the,

3139
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:06,391
to the,

3140
01:25:06,391 --> 01:25:07,570
it's taking notes at the shelf.

3141
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:10,450
So he's one of these guys.

3142
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:11,980
He'll tell me if I suck.

3143
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,130
I mean,

3144
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:15,641
it's good.

3145
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:16,750
It keeps me level headed.

3146
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:17,000
You know,

3147
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,360
I have a family that is a very,

3148
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:20,230
very honest,

3149
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:22,360
and they don't pull any punches and

3150
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:25,780
people confuse that with being cruel.

3151
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:27,300
Honesty.

3152
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,133
Yeah.

3153
01:25:28,170 --> 01:25:28,870
Yeah.

3154
01:25:28,870 --> 01:25:29,703
Listen,

3155
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:30,830
my father,

3156
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:31,260
uh,

3157
01:25:31,260 --> 01:25:34,010
and my relationship
with my father has been,

3158
01:25:34,690 --> 01:25:35,690
and I had to tell him,

3159
01:25:35,691 --> 01:25:35,991
I said,

3160
01:25:35,991 --> 01:25:36,231
dad,

3161
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:36,450
you know,

3162
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:41,090
just could you come to just be
a fan and not like a father?

3163
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:42,740
Just enjoy the show.

3164
01:25:42,741 --> 01:25:43,574
You don't have to,

3165
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:44,120
you know,

3166
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:45,050
critique it.

3167
01:25:45,380 --> 01:25:45,921
Uh,

3168
01:25:45,921 --> 01:25:46,550
which,

3169
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,383
you know,

3170
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:49,010
he has backed off,

3171
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:52,080
but I know deep down
he's dying to tell me.

3172
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:55,130
I mean,

3173
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:55,520
uh,

3174
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,600
I know when I do something
on TV and if you don't like,

3175
01:25:58,610 --> 01:25:59,720
say nothing about it,

3176
01:25:59,721 --> 01:26:00,554
he don't like it.

3177
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:00,830
You know,

3178
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:01,490
let's say if,

3179
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,890
let's say if you listen
to this interview and,

3180
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:03,590
and,

3181
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:04,220
and then,

3182
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,000
uh,

3183
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,770
we talk and he owns some bring it up.

3184
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:07,790
I know he's going to say,

3185
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:08,840
you sucked.

3186
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:10,520
It was no good,

3187
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,781
boring,

3188
01:26:11,781 --> 01:26:12,950
boring was shut it off.

3189
01:26:12,951 --> 01:26:13,101
Why?

3190
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:14,270
People want to listen to you.

3191
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:16,093
He'll,

3192
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:17,930
he'll give it to me.

3193
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:20,930
But that's also why you're so funny
because you grew up with that.

3194
01:26:20,990 --> 01:26:22,550
That's part of the whole program.

3195
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:23,240
Totally,

3196
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:23,631
totally.

3197
01:26:23,631 --> 01:26:23,931
I mean,

3198
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:27,650
I think that's a huge reason
why I am the way I am,

3199
01:26:27,651 --> 01:26:29,180
because I'm kind of honest.

3200
01:26:29,270 --> 01:26:29,691
Uh,

3201
01:26:29,691 --> 01:26:32,060
when I'm talking about comedy on stage,

3202
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:33,840
the honesty is to me the,

3203
01:26:33,841 --> 01:26:34,210
the,

3204
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:35,060
the funny,

3205
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:36,290
the funniest stuff I got,

3206
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:37,330
is this the truth?

3207
01:26:37,331 --> 01:26:41,630
And if you don't speak the truth then
I don't think it's particularly funny,

3208
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:42,530
at least in my life.

3209
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:43,130
But uh,

3210
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:43,760
yeah.

3211
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:43,941
To,

3212
01:26:43,941 --> 01:26:44,930
to come from that.

3213
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:45,770
Um,

3214
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:46,050
yeah,

3215
01:26:46,050 --> 01:26:47,020
my sister,

3216
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,863
my,

3217
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,490
my wife,

3218
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:49,881
you know,

3219
01:26:49,881 --> 01:26:50,714
they'll tell me.

3220
01:26:50,720 --> 01:26:51,553
Yeah.

3221
01:26:51,830 --> 01:26:51,981
Yeah.

3222
01:26:51,981 --> 01:26:53,000
My wife will tell me to,

3223
01:26:53,210 --> 01:26:54,350
my wife's fucking funny.

3224
01:26:54,620 --> 01:26:55,401
She's hilarious.

3225
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:58,790
She says ridiculous shit all the
time and she's getting good at it.

3226
01:26:58,820 --> 01:26:59,211
Like she,

3227
01:26:59,211 --> 01:27:00,680
she likes to make me laugh,

3228
01:27:00,860 --> 01:27:03,780
so like she'll point it something to
look at this mother fucker and like,

3229
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,300
then we'll both start cracking up.

3230
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,560
That's huge too.

3231
01:27:06,561 --> 01:27:08,810
And she'll tell me like if he
seemed a little off tonight.

3232
01:27:09,770 --> 01:27:10,100
Yes.

3233
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:10,933
New Shits.

3234
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,770
Especially when I have new material,

3235
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:13,810
man's slippery,

3236
01:27:14,350 --> 01:27:14,601
you know,

3237
01:27:14,601 --> 01:27:15,291
new materials,

3238
01:27:15,291 --> 01:27:18,950
like I can't quite grab ahold of it.

3239
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:20,300
It's like I know something's there,

3240
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:20,950
but,

3241
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:23,840
and the only thing that makes
it better is trial and error.

3242
01:27:23,841 --> 01:27:25,310
That's the only thing
that makes it better.

3243
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:29,770
It's the only thing just
fucking constantly doing sets,

3244
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,380
you know.

3245
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,900
I know you're at the store all the time
and you work in other clubs as well

3246
01:27:32,901 --> 01:27:33,734
around town.

3247
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:38,800
I'd just like to see the motherland dis
that stage in the original original room

3248
01:27:39,231 --> 01:27:43,100
for whatever reason I feel the most
comfortable and the most creative.

3249
01:27:43,370 --> 01:27:46,040
I'm not saying I won't do the ice house,

3250
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:46,821
so stuff like that.

3251
01:27:46,821 --> 01:27:47,211
But it's,

3252
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:47,960
it's,

3253
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:48,681
it's easy.

3254
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:48,851
It's,

3255
01:27:48,851 --> 01:27:50,930
it's kind of near where I live.

3256
01:27:50,931 --> 01:27:51,860
I bounce in,

3257
01:27:51,861 --> 01:27:53,540
I bounce out and uh,

3258
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:54,620
I like,

3259
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,050
I like doing it there
and I used to bring my,

3260
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,750
my wife there when we didn't
have a baby and my wife I think,

3261
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:01,520
and I don't know if your wife has,

3262
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,060
uh,

3263
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:05,450
did you think your humor
has like bled into your,

3264
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:10,040
your wife's cause my wife's looking
at the world completely different.

3265
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:10,874
Like a comic.

3266
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:12,680
Yeah.

3267
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:13,640
My wife's like a comment.

3268
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:14,300
Yeah,

3269
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,470
she thinks like a comic.

3270
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:15,861
Yeah.

3271
01:28:15,861 --> 01:28:18,590
So definitely not true if you're
around comics all the time.

3272
01:28:18,591 --> 01:28:19,640
You think like comics,

3273
01:28:20,120 --> 01:28:21,710
like when comics come over the house,

3274
01:28:21,711 --> 01:28:22,850
she's always fucking with them.

3275
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,110
It's hilarious.

3276
01:28:24,140 --> 01:28:26,900
She'll start poking fun and numb
and j she gets a kick out of it.

3277
01:28:26,900 --> 01:28:28,010
And when she's with her friends,

3278
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,800
she's absolutely the one who's
always talking shit and making,

3279
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:31,760
making people laugh.

3280
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:32,390
That's funny.

3281
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:32,990
Yeah.

3282
01:28:32,990 --> 01:28:33,291
It's,

3283
01:28:33,291 --> 01:28:33,590
uh,

3284
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:38,590
it's the most fun group of people to
be around when we're all at the store,

3285
01:28:39,620 --> 01:28:40,730
when we all see each other.

3286
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:41,001
I mean,

3287
01:28:41,001 --> 01:28:41,151
it's,

3288
01:28:41,151 --> 01:28:45,980
one of the things that makes me feel so
fortunate is that I have so many friends

3289
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:47,270
that are hilarious.

3290
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:48,321
Like when I go there,

3291
01:28:48,321 --> 01:28:50,510
I see these guys and I
know that we're going to,

3292
01:28:50,570 --> 01:28:51,710
we're going to have some fun.

3293
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:52,390
We're going to,

3294
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:53,750
we're going to do sets,

3295
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:58,010
but we're also going to hang out in that
back bar and talk shit and laugh a lot.

3296
01:28:58,011 --> 01:28:58,341
It just,

3297
01:28:58,341 --> 01:28:58,660
it's,

3298
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:01,770
that's a great friendly environment,

3299
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:02,633
you know?

3300
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:04,530
And I like to laugh.

3301
01:29:04,650 --> 01:29:05,700
I love to ask.

3302
01:29:05,701 --> 01:29:07,260
So when I go to the comedy store,

3303
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:08,250
I don't really,

3304
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:10,740
if I'm around Comedians,

3305
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,700
I don't say much because I,

3306
01:29:12,701 --> 01:29:13,080
I'd,

3307
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:17,340
I'd rather sit back and enjoy
what's happening in front
of me that actually be a

3308
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:17,910
part of it.

3309
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:19,500
Because for me,

3310
01:29:19,501 --> 01:29:20,334
you know,

3311
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:24,790
I make people laugh all the time and to
be around five or six comedians in the,

3312
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:28,770
in the parking lot of the comedy store
and watch whatever you go off on a

3313
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:29,760
tangent or cat,

3314
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:31,140
Callan start,

3315
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:31,591
you know,

3316
01:29:31,591 --> 01:29:32,490
doing his thing.

3317
01:29:32,520 --> 01:29:34,590
I just sit back and enjoy it.

3318
01:29:34,591 --> 01:29:34,811
I,

3319
01:29:34,811 --> 01:29:35,130
I,

3320
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:36,900
I don't like to speak around.

3321
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:38,820
I like to go when I'm in the main room,

3322
01:29:38,821 --> 01:29:39,960
I like to go into the,

3323
01:29:39,961 --> 01:29:40,350
uh,

3324
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:43,950
to the or and sit in the back
and watch the show sometimes too,

3325
01:29:43,951 --> 01:29:46,650
when I know I'm not going up
at all that night in that room.

3326
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:47,161
I'd like to,

3327
01:29:47,161 --> 01:29:47,731
I like to do that.

3328
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:48,870
I like to be an audience member.

3329
01:29:48,871 --> 01:29:50,040
I still really enjoy that.

3330
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,820
It's still really enjoy just sitting in
the back with a drink and just laughing.

3331
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:54,601
It's great.

3332
01:29:54,601 --> 01:29:56,210
It's a great thing to be a part of the,

3333
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:56,430
you know,

3334
01:29:56,430 --> 01:29:58,020
he's fucking murder in it these days.

3335
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,123
Neil Brennan,

3336
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,470
Neal Brennan's on fire right now.

3337
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:02,490
He's on fire.

3338
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,390
He's doing really,

3339
01:30:03,391 --> 01:30:03,910
really well.

3340
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:05,500
I think that special on Netflix,

3341
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,930
the three mikes has really opened himself
up to performing in front of large

3342
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:12,540
audiences and he's always
been a real funny cat,

3343
01:30:12,570 --> 01:30:13,070
you know?

3344
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:13,481
I mean,

3345
01:30:13,481 --> 01:30:14,190
uh,

3346
01:30:14,190 --> 01:30:15,090
always been real funny,

3347
01:30:15,091 --> 01:30:16,790
but he's in a new zone right now.

3348
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:17,070
We were,

3349
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:18,650
I was watching him the
other night in the AOR.

3350
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:19,650
I was sitting in the back of my,

3351
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,341
God damn,

3352
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:22,830
this new stuff is good to hear.

3353
01:30:23,040 --> 01:30:24,450
That's just such a fucking,

3354
01:30:24,630 --> 01:30:26,880
it's such a great hot spot.

3355
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:30,210
There's so much good comedy
going on in that place,

3356
01:30:30,211 --> 01:30:33,180
whether it's Santino Santina
has been murdering lately.

3357
01:30:33,390 --> 01:30:34,830
Hinchcliffe cliff's been killing it.

3358
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:37,560
There's just so many good comics there.

3359
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:38,720
It's like a,

3360
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:39,121
it's just,

3361
01:30:39,121 --> 01:30:40,530
you feel like it's,

3362
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:41,550
it's fuel.

3363
01:30:41,551 --> 01:30:42,420
It's inspirational.

3364
01:30:42,421 --> 01:30:43,030
Yeah.

3365
01:30:43,030 --> 01:30:46,290
You walk in and see some guy
and going up and you're like,

3366
01:30:46,291 --> 01:30:46,591
man,

3367
01:30:46,591 --> 01:30:47,071
that's,

3368
01:30:47,071 --> 01:30:48,050
that's some funny stuff.

3369
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:50,440
And you feel inspired to go and go,

3370
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:51,390
I'm,

3371
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:53,790
I'm going to write something
new or what have you.

3372
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:54,331
It's nice.

3373
01:30:54,331 --> 01:30:56,340
It's a nice community to be
a part of that comedy store.

3374
01:30:56,341 --> 01:30:57,870
It's really helped me
over the last 20 years.

3375
01:30:58,110 --> 01:30:58,711
Yeah.

3376
01:30:58,711 --> 01:30:59,071
It's,

3377
01:30:59,071 --> 01:30:59,330
uh,

3378
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:00,480
it's very unique,

3379
01:31:00,481 --> 01:31:01,020
you know,

3380
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:01,853
and uh,

3381
01:31:01,860 --> 01:31:06,120
I showed you that a painting that a
Taylormade that I posted up on Instagram.

3382
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:07,470
That's the painting of Mitzi.

3383
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:09,450
I think I'm going to put that
motherfucker right there.

3384
01:31:09,480 --> 01:31:10,313
That's nice.

3385
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,520
Mitzi watch over us.

3386
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,151
Yeah.

3387
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:12,460
This,

3388
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,130
this whole thing you've got going on here.

3389
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:15,630
And I don't know if
he'd talk about it much.

3390
01:31:15,631 --> 01:31:16,860
I don't know if you're private about it,

3391
01:31:16,861 --> 01:31:20,880
but even being here in
this studio is inspiring.

3392
01:31:20,881 --> 01:31:21,180
When I,

3393
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:23,130
when you were showing me
what you have and whatnot,

3394
01:31:23,131 --> 01:31:23,401
I'm like,

3395
01:31:23,401 --> 01:31:24,060
man,

3396
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:24,271
see,

3397
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:24,600
I don't,

3398
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:25,050
I don't,

3399
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:29,820
I've always looked at people who
have things or whether it be,

3400
01:31:29,910 --> 01:31:31,950
if you have a nice home or a nice car,

3401
01:31:32,470 --> 01:31:32,911
whatever,

3402
01:31:32,911 --> 01:31:34,860
it is a nice family.

3403
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:38,160
I always inspire to do that.

3404
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:41,100
I don't begrudge anybody that has a lot.

3405
01:31:41,101 --> 01:31:46,101
I've always looked at it as I want to
be where that person is approach to,

3406
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:48,330
you know,

3407
01:31:48,330 --> 01:31:49,680
being a bitter,

3408
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,240
bitter.

3409
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:50,501
Yeah.

3410
01:31:50,501 --> 01:31:51,360
That's very healthy.

3411
01:31:51,361 --> 01:31:51,780
Yeah.

3412
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:52,740
I mean,

3413
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:53,530
man,

3414
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:54,361
it just,

3415
01:31:54,361 --> 01:31:55,230
just having,

3416
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,700
having a treadmill,

3417
01:31:56,730 --> 01:31:57,061
whatever,

3418
01:31:57,061 --> 01:31:57,811
whatever it is,

3419
01:31:57,811 --> 01:31:58,980
the treadmill you showed me on,

3420
01:31:58,990 --> 01:31:59,231
man,

3421
01:31:59,231 --> 01:31:59,520
that's,

3422
01:31:59,520 --> 01:31:59,981
that's not,

3423
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:01,300
I want to get something like that.

3424
01:32:01,301 --> 01:32:02,134
I mean,

3425
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:02,973
I just,

3426
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,480
I just always looked.

3427
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,610
I want to be around people who,

3428
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:07,090
you know,

3429
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:07,923
are inspiring.

3430
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:08,551
Yeah,

3431
01:32:08,551 --> 01:32:09,090
me too.

3432
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:09,420
Yeah.

3433
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:09,631
I mean,

3434
01:32:09,631 --> 01:32:11,280
that's one of the best
things about this podcast.

3435
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:15,210
So I get a chance to talk to really
interesting people and uncle all walks of

3436
01:32:15,211 --> 01:32:16,620
life and you know,

3437
01:32:16,850 --> 01:32:17,431
it's weird,

3438
01:32:17,431 --> 01:32:18,930
all the worlds mixed together,

3439
01:32:18,931 --> 01:32:22,080
but all those interesting
inspirational people,

3440
01:32:22,081 --> 01:32:25,390
it's definitely made me
more aware and smarter 100%.

3441
01:32:25,391 --> 01:32:26,610
It made me more aware of things,

3442
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,100
made me reconsider my positions on things,

3443
01:32:29,101 --> 01:32:29,761
made me,

3444
01:32:29,761 --> 01:32:30,210
uh,

3445
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:30,630
like,

3446
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:32,160
like we're talking about David Goggins.

3447
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:32,701
I mean,

3448
01:32:32,701 --> 01:32:33,680
I just think about that kind.

3449
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:34,620
I want to work out harder.

3450
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:36,853
I do,

3451
01:32:37,250 --> 01:32:38,250
there's a part in the book,

3452
01:32:38,251 --> 01:32:43,251
I think he went to support his either
mother's sister and a race and then in Las

3453
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:44,071
Vegas.

3454
01:32:44,071 --> 01:32:47,130
And then I think he just took
off and left like he was,

3455
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,330
he was there for them.

3456
01:32:48,331 --> 01:32:48,671
Isn't the,

3457
01:32:48,671 --> 01:32:49,860
isn't there a part where he just like,

3458
01:32:49,861 --> 01:32:51,210
he was in dress shoes and he,

3459
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:53,190
he's just started running.

3460
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:54,880
That's,

3461
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:55,441
that's him.

3462
01:32:55,441 --> 01:32:56,221
Then I was like,

3463
01:32:56,221 --> 01:32:57,450
he's a fucking savage.

3464
01:32:57,480 --> 01:32:58,110
He's a legit,

3465
01:32:58,110 --> 01:32:59,610
and what's great about him,

3466
01:32:59,670 --> 01:33:03,660
one of my favorite parts about David
Goggins is that he's real honest about who

3467
01:33:03,661 --> 01:33:07,590
used to be that he was like 300 pounds
of fat and lazy and he's drinking

3468
01:33:07,591 --> 01:33:11,430
milkshakes and he just was depressed
and couldn't get his shit together.

3469
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:16,670
And then he hardened himself up through
some strange force of will and became

3470
01:33:17,191 --> 01:33:17,731
that guy,

3471
01:33:17,731 --> 01:33:20,160
decided he wanted to
become that guy who was,

3472
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:23,640
as he puts it uncommon
amongst uncommon men.

3473
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:24,361
You know,

3474
01:33:24,361 --> 01:33:26,760
that he just decided I'm
going to be the motherfucker,

3475
01:33:26,761 --> 01:33:30,390
have motherfuckers and then he's so
much light that when people around them,

3476
01:33:30,391 --> 01:33:30,631
they're like,

3477
01:33:30,631 --> 01:33:31,464
oh Jesus.

3478
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:34,100
Because he's so fucking intense.

3479
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,520
Like you got to ramp it up to like,

3480
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,080
I'm not ready for Coggins right now.

3481
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,070
I was going to do 20 sit ups and 20 Chin
ups and 20 pushups and I was going to

3482
01:33:41,071 --> 01:33:41,550
go home.

3483
01:33:41,550 --> 01:33:43,290
This motherfucker wants
to run till we die,

3484
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:44,101
you know?

3485
01:33:44,101 --> 01:33:45,840
But that's those people.

3486
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:50,130
I don't know how many people Goggins is
inspired that listen to this podcast and

3487
01:33:50,131 --> 01:33:54,000
all of a sudden they're out there hustling
and they're out there doing things on

3488
01:33:54,001 --> 01:33:55,530
a level that they never did before.

3489
01:33:55,531 --> 01:33:59,420
And they're putting in that work
and exerting themselves in that way,

3490
01:33:59,470 --> 01:33:59,700
you know?

3491
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,590
And he rubbed some people the
wrong way because of that,

3492
01:34:01,591 --> 01:34:03,060
because he's so aggressive and intense.

3493
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,420
Some people are just reluctant to,

3494
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:07,440
to be inspired by a guy like that.

3495
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:08,251
They're almost like,

3496
01:34:08,251 --> 01:34:09,030
it's too much.

3497
01:34:09,030 --> 01:34:09,181
Well,

3498
01:34:09,181 --> 01:34:09,661
he's been there.

3499
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:10,140
He's been,

3500
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:10,973
he's been there,

3501
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:12,210
he's been in the,

3502
01:34:12,810 --> 01:34:14,070
in the basement of life.

3503
01:34:14,071 --> 01:34:14,904
You know what I mean?

3504
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,100
300 pounds didn't really come from a,

3505
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,310
you know,

3506
01:34:17,310 --> 01:34:18,670
the father was a,

3507
01:34:19,130 --> 01:34:19,870
and he,

3508
01:34:19,870 --> 01:34:22,650
and he willed himself out of it.

3509
01:34:22,651 --> 01:34:23,221
So I mean,

3510
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:24,060
if he could do it,

3511
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:24,840
you know,

3512
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:26,610
why can't I run another mile and a half?

3513
01:34:26,611 --> 01:34:29,020
And there's a video that I listened and

3514
01:34:29,030 --> 01:34:29,800
two from,

3515
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:30,170
uh,

3516
01:34:30,170 --> 01:34:31,100
my friend Jocko,

3517
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:31,911
Jocko Willink,

3518
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:35,930
who's a navy seal commander and he's
got this video and it's just says it's

3519
01:34:35,931 --> 01:34:36,590
just,

3520
01:34:36,590 --> 01:34:37,250
it's,

3521
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:37,700
it's,

3522
01:34:37,700 --> 01:34:41,030
I think it's called good because
it's how he looks at everything.

3523
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:41,181
Oh,

3524
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:41,930
you hurt your ankle.

3525
01:34:41,930 --> 01:34:43,760
Good more time to work on other things.

3526
01:34:44,030 --> 01:34:44,241
You know,

3527
01:34:44,241 --> 01:34:45,290
you didn't get to promotion.

3528
01:34:45,350 --> 01:34:46,100
Good,

3529
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:46,810
good.

3530
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:47,643
Everything's good.

3531
01:34:47,930 --> 01:34:48,711
Everything good.

3532
01:34:48,711 --> 01:34:49,820
That's like how he looks at things.

3533
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:53,120
And I've been like running hills halfway,

3534
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:53,990
fucking dead,

3535
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:55,850
exhausted camp reads like,

3536
01:34:55,880 --> 01:34:56,870
oh your lungs were on fire.

3537
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:58,070
You've got an opportunity

3538
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,940
to get better shape.

3539
01:34:59,330 --> 01:34:59,870
I good.

3540
01:34:59,870 --> 01:35:00,680
Keep pushing.

3541
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:01,610
This is what it's all about.

3542
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:01,911
Good.

3543
01:35:01,911 --> 01:35:02,990
This is an opportunity to,

3544
01:35:03,190 --> 01:35:05,990
to face the intensity of this moment.

3545
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,153
You got to play that,

3546
01:35:07,190 --> 01:35:07,940
play that video,

3547
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:11,810
play that video just to just a freak
Sebastian now cause this is something I

3548
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:12,011
will,

3549
01:35:12,011 --> 01:35:13,510
I'll listen to this like where my guys

3550
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:15,200
work for me every three or four months.

3551
01:35:15,201 --> 01:35:17,400
Call me up or pull me aside with John.

3552
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:18,320
Major problem,

3553
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:22,310
some issue that was going on and he'd
say possibly we got this and that and the

3554
01:35:22,311 --> 01:35:23,060
other thing.

3555
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:24,140
And I looked at him and I'd say,

3556
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:25,393
good.

3557
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:30,230
And finally one day he was telling me
about some issue that he was having some

3558
01:35:30,231 --> 01:35:32,270
problem and he said,

3559
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:33,590
I already know what you're going to say.

3560
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:35,201
I said,

3561
01:35:35,201 --> 01:35:35,321
well,

3562
01:35:35,321 --> 01:35:36,011
what am I going to say?

3563
01:35:36,011 --> 01:35:37,120
You said you're going to say good.

3564
01:35:37,270 --> 01:35:38,680
Uh,

3565
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:40,191
he said,

3566
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:44,210
that's what you always say when
something is wrong in going bad.

3567
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:45,940
You always just look at me and say good.

3568
01:35:48,310 --> 01:35:48,791
And I said,

3569
01:35:48,791 --> 01:35:48,941
well,

3570
01:35:48,941 --> 01:35:49,774
yeah,

3571
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:52,810
when things are going bad,

3572
01:35:53,650 --> 01:35:56,530
there's going to be some good
that's going to come from it.

3573
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:00,300
Didn't get the new high
speed gear we wanted.

3574
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:01,763
Good.

3575
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:02,663
Didn't get promoted.

3576
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:05,233
What time you get back?

3577
01:36:07,860 --> 01:36:08,020
Oh,

3578
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:08,890
mission got canceled.

3579
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,030
Good.

3580
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,050
We can focus on the older one.

3581
01:36:11,380 --> 01:36:12,280
Didn't get funded,

3582
01:36:12,710 --> 01:36:14,080
didn't get the job you wanted.

3583
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:16,143
Got Injured.

3584
01:36:16,510 --> 01:36:17,343
Sprained my ankle,

3585
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:18,333
got tapped out.

3586
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:19,293
Good.

3587
01:36:19,690 --> 01:36:20,523
Got Beat.

3588
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:26,290
Unexpected problems.

3589
01:36:27,290 --> 01:36:28,123
Good

3590
01:36:29,110 --> 01:36:31,990
opportunity to figure out a solution.

3591
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,593
That's it.

3592
01:36:34,850 --> 01:36:35,930
When things are going bad,

3593
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:38,590
don't get all bummed out.

3594
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:39,080
Don't

3595
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:39,440
Darbell.

3596
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,610
Don't get frustrated.

3597
01:36:45,230 --> 01:36:47,630
If you can say the word good,

3598
01:36:49,260 --> 01:36:51,390
guess what you need.

3599
01:36:51,391 --> 01:36:52,470
You're still alive.

3600
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:53,661
It meets,

3601
01:36:53,661 --> 01:36:54,494
you're still bleeding.

3602
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:56,540
And if you're still breathing,

3603
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:02,360
you still got some fight left in you.

3604
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:04,603
Get up,

3605
01:37:05,570 --> 01:37:06,403
dust off,

3606
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,330
reload,

3607
01:37:09,440 --> 01:37:10,273
recalibrate,

3608
01:37:11,630 --> 01:37:13,160
reengage.

3609
01:37:15,010 --> 01:37:16,390
Go out on the attack.

3610
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:21,863
Come on.

3611
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:24,810
Don't you want to just go run
through a fucking wall right now,

3612
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,633
Joe?

3613
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:29,723
Good.

3614
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:30,330
Good.

3615
01:37:30,330 --> 01:37:31,860
I think of that all the time.

3616
01:37:31,861 --> 01:37:35,070
That's a legit thing that bounces
around in my head when I'm tired.

3617
01:37:35,310 --> 01:37:36,540
When something's wrong in my life.

3618
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:37,021
I think,

3619
01:37:37,021 --> 01:37:37,430
good,

3620
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,680
good.

3621
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:38,640
Don't be a bitch.

3622
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:39,990
Look at this the right way.

3623
01:37:40,290 --> 01:37:41,310
Look at this the right way.

3624
01:37:41,820 --> 01:37:42,421
He's going to have,

3625
01:37:42,421 --> 01:37:43,800
the things are going to go wrong.

3626
01:37:43,830 --> 01:37:44,280
Yeah,

3627
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:45,750
they always do.

3628
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:46,771
If they don't,

3629
01:37:46,771 --> 01:37:49,020
you're not trying anything unusual,

3630
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:49,551
you know,

3631
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:51,120
doing anything difficult.

3632
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,920
You're not stretching yourself out.

3633
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:54,031
Yeah.

3634
01:37:54,031 --> 01:37:56,190
I like looking at videos
that and being introduced

3635
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:57,390
to guys like that.

3636
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,980
Man.

3637
01:37:57,980 --> 01:37:59,730
That's how I got introduced to Goggins.

3638
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,800
Someone played a video of him.

3639
01:38:01,801 --> 01:38:02,550
Um,

3640
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:03,480
the doctor,

3641
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:06,510
Eric Thomas is a motivational speaker who,

3642
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,410
uh,

3643
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,250
love listening to,

3644
01:38:08,251 --> 01:38:11,460
I love listening to
people who get me mode of,

3645
01:38:11,461 --> 01:38:12,294
I need.

3646
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,880
Yeah.

3647
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,280
Jocko has got a great podcast to you guys.

3648
01:38:15,281 --> 01:38:16,114
A navy seal.

3649
01:38:16,510 --> 01:38:17,620
He's a motherfucker.

3650
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:18,693
He's a,

3651
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:20,770
he's a very interesting cat.

3652
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,480
Extremely intelligent but
just as manly as they come,

3653
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:26,261
you know,

3654
01:38:26,261 --> 01:38:28,390
and just fucking owns it.

3655
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:29,910
And you,

3656
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:30,430
you know,

3657
01:38:30,430 --> 01:38:31,390
you see that guy talk.

3658
01:38:31,391 --> 01:38:35,020
One of the reason why
that's so inspirational is
because that's really him.

3659
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:37,390
You go to his Instagram every day.

3660
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:40,780
There's a photograph of his watch at four
30 in the morning cause that's when he

3661
01:38:40,781 --> 01:38:43,300
gets up to train the trains by himself.

3662
01:38:43,301 --> 01:38:46,450
And then we'll take a photo of the puddle
that's on the ground after he's done.

3663
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,100
And then he earns the sunrise.

3664
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:52,120
So he gets up and he goes to the fucking
beach and he sees the sun come up after

3665
01:38:52,121 --> 01:38:52,954
he's done training.

3666
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,210
He's a savage.

3667
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:56,860
That's a real savage

3668
01:38:57,510 --> 01:38:57,931
guys.

3669
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:01,380
I get up at four four 30 in
the morning and I'm like,

3670
01:39:01,381 --> 01:39:03,240
what happened at taking a nap?

3671
01:39:03,430 --> 01:39:04,630
Well he'll take a nap later,

3672
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:08,560
but the point is he makes him sound like
it's nothing wrong with taking a nap.

3673
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:09,250
Probably.

3674
01:39:09,250 --> 01:39:09,520
No,

3675
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:11,040
but this is that occasion.

3676
01:39:11,041 --> 01:39:14,200
He'll get his whole fucking
Instagram is pictures of his watch.

3677
01:39:14,830 --> 01:39:17,650
He so fuck and I'm all,

3678
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:19,360
but he's really doing it too.

3679
01:39:19,361 --> 01:39:21,220
He's a Brazilian jujitsu black belt,

3680
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,870
like a very high level black belt.

3681
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:27,820
He's tapped some worldclass competitors
and a fucking great guy too.

3682
01:39:28,090 --> 01:39:28,560
Cool.

3683
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:28,811
Yeah,

3684
01:39:28,811 --> 01:39:29,291
I'll definitely,

3685
01:39:29,291 --> 01:39:30,700
she was a guest on Tim Ferriss,

3686
01:39:30,701 --> 01:39:31,301
his podcast.

3687
01:39:31,301 --> 01:39:32,230
That's how I heard about him.

3688
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:34,320
Then I had them on mine and uh,

3689
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:36,940
me and Tim both convinced
him to do his own podcast.

3690
01:39:36,941 --> 01:39:38,200
Now it's hugely popular.

3691
01:39:38,240 --> 01:39:39,250
It's got a great book out.

3692
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:40,000
Uh,

3693
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:40,960
what is it,

3694
01:39:40,961 --> 01:39:42,190
a extreme ownership.

3695
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,751
Yeah,

3696
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:44,051
he's,

3697
01:39:44,051 --> 01:39:44,950
he's fantastic.

3698
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,360
He'll definitely look at them.

3699
01:39:46,420 --> 01:39:46,900
Yeah.

3700
01:39:46,900 --> 01:39:49,690
People like that are so important
because they give you this step.

3701
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:50,860
Just that little push,

3702
01:39:50,861 --> 01:39:54,310
they change the frequency
of your brain and make you,

3703
01:39:54,550 --> 01:39:55,600
gets you fired up.

3704
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:58,330
But you can even accomplish a lot of
things because of people like that.

3705
01:39:58,680 --> 01:39:58,811
You know,

3706
01:39:58,811 --> 01:39:59,140
there's,

3707
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,370
there's extra gears to be had extra
horsepower to be put to things.

3708
01:40:03,430 --> 01:40:04,263
Totally

3709
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:06,160
good,

3710
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:06,640
good,

3711
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,420
good.

3712
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:08,253
Yeah.

3713
01:40:08,530 --> 01:40:09,940
So now that you've done,

3714
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:10,301
you know,

3715
01:40:10,301 --> 01:40:12,640
four sold out shows in
Madison Square Garden,

3716
01:40:12,641 --> 01:40:15,580
I mean this is the fucking pinnacle
of any standup comics career.

3717
01:40:15,820 --> 01:40:18,910
There's only a handful of comics
that have ever been able to do that.

3718
01:40:18,911 --> 01:40:21,070
This is like dice Louis,

3719
01:40:21,071 --> 01:40:23,050
c k there's a few others.

3720
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:23,591
I mean,

3721
01:40:23,591 --> 01:40:23,910
this is a,

3722
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:25,540
you're in a rare place.

3723
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:28,330
Do you have other goals or are you just,

3724
01:40:28,480 --> 01:40:33,480
just working on maintaining and continuing
to put on good shows for your fans?

3725
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,340
That's been the goal.

3726
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:35,450
I,

3727
01:40:35,450 --> 01:40:35,600
I,

3728
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,780
I'm not a goal guy.

3729
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:37,070
I,

3730
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:37,591
I don't,

3731
01:40:37,591 --> 01:40:38,161
I don't say,

3732
01:40:38,161 --> 01:40:38,431
Hey,

3733
01:40:38,431 --> 01:40:40,320
this is my goals this year.

3734
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:40,910
Uh,

3735
01:40:40,910 --> 01:40:43,080
I never planned on doing
Madison Square Garden.

3736
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:46,560
My only goal when I got into this
business was to do it for a living.

3737
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:48,480
I want to do standup comedy for a living.

3738
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,640
And now wherever it takes me,

3739
01:40:50,641 --> 01:40:51,474
it takes me,

3740
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:52,740
it took me to the garden.

3741
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:57,010
I'm not looking at my
vision board and going,

3742
01:40:57,070 --> 01:40:58,780
doing Nevada can next.

3743
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,860
It's a believe in the secret.

3744
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:06,010
Wherever this takes me,

3745
01:41:06,290 --> 01:41:07,123
it takes me.

3746
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:07,630
Um,

3747
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:07,991
I,

3748
01:41:07,991 --> 01:41:08,350
you know,

3749
01:41:08,350 --> 01:41:10,320
to do the Madison Square Garden was,

3750
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:11,171
was fabulous.

3751
01:41:11,171 --> 01:41:12,550
It was a great experience.

3752
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:13,001
Nothing,

3753
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:18,001
nothing quite like the rush of going out
in front of 18,000 people in the round.

3754
01:41:19,511 --> 01:41:19,791
And,

3755
01:41:19,791 --> 01:41:20,171
and,

3756
01:41:20,171 --> 01:41:20,411
you know,

3757
01:41:20,411 --> 01:41:21,880
having your family witnessed it.

3758
01:41:21,881 --> 01:41:22,301
My mother,

3759
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:23,470
when she walked into the arena,

3760
01:41:23,471 --> 01:41:24,550
started crying.

3761
01:41:24,551 --> 01:41:24,821
You know,

3762
01:41:24,821 --> 01:41:27,490
she was there when I was being her.

3763
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:32,740
You gave birth to this little tiny baby
and this little tiny baby is got four

3764
01:41:32,741 --> 01:41:34,720
sold out shows at Madison Square Garden.

3765
01:41:34,810 --> 01:41:35,410
It hit her,

3766
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:36,340
it hit her hard.

3767
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:37,263
And uh,

3768
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:37,570
you know,

3769
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:38,410
she was you too.

3770
01:41:38,411 --> 01:41:39,220
To see it hit her.

3771
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:39,761
Oh Man.

3772
01:41:39,761 --> 01:41:40,210
I was,

3773
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:40,601
listen,

3774
01:41:40,601 --> 01:41:41,560
I'm an emotional guy.

3775
01:41:41,561 --> 01:41:42,820
So to see my,

3776
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:48,310
I brought my little baby and Ilana on
stage for a photo at the end of it,

3777
01:41:48,370 --> 01:41:48,821
uh,

3778
01:41:48,821 --> 01:41:50,140
I brought my father on stage.

3779
01:41:50,141 --> 01:41:54,220
I brought my mother and my sister on stage
to kind of like share in that moment.

3780
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:54,881
Uh,

3781
01:41:54,881 --> 01:41:55,331
so yeah,

3782
01:41:55,331 --> 01:41:59,440
when my mother walked in
and empty arena and saw it,

3783
01:41:59,560 --> 01:41:59,921
uh,

3784
01:41:59,921 --> 01:42:00,191
you know,

3785
01:42:00,191 --> 01:42:05,191
she had flashbacks to in 1998 when I did
xannies and we had to get friends and

3786
01:42:06,821 --> 01:42:08,800
family there to fill the audience.

3787
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:12,340
And then now she walks
in and her son's doing,

3788
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:12,970
uh,

3789
01:42:12,970 --> 01:42:13,900
for these,

3790
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:14,620
uh,

3791
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:15,220
you know,

3792
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:15,760
it was,

3793
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:16,630
it was a great,

3794
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:21,700
I'm so glad my parents were alive to
see that it would have been a shame if,

3795
01:42:22,850 --> 01:42:27,760
if they weren't there because they'd
been on this journey from the beginning.

3796
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:29,020
These are parents who,

3797
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:34,090
when I told them in 1996 that I was going
to go out to Los Angeles to pursue a

3798
01:42:34,091 --> 01:42:35,170
standup career,

3799
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:38,140
didn't look at me and go goatee
and not still looked at me and go,

3800
01:42:38,141 --> 01:42:38,381
hey,

3801
01:42:38,381 --> 01:42:38,890
you know what,

3802
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:40,270
if you think you've got what it takes,

3803
01:42:40,540 --> 01:42:41,590
get the hell out there.

3804
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:43,300
They'll put yourself a time limit.

3805
01:42:43,301 --> 01:42:43,421
No.

3806
01:42:43,421 --> 01:42:44,254
Some people say,

3807
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:44,570
Eh,

3808
01:42:44,570 --> 01:42:46,300
if I don't do it in five years,

3809
01:42:46,301 --> 01:42:47,590
I'm going to quit or whatever.

3810
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:49,000
So when I came out here,

3811
01:42:49,001 --> 01:42:49,900
it was all in,

3812
01:42:49,930 --> 01:42:50,261
you know,

3813
01:42:50,261 --> 01:42:51,910
if I said five years,

3814
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:53,140
I wouldn't have been here.

3815
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:56,530
I would've been back a in
Chicago working at Motorola,

3816
01:42:56,531 --> 01:42:57,364
who knows.

3817
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:58,240
Uh,

3818
01:42:58,240 --> 01:43:00,460
so family's always been really,

3819
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:02,950
really key to my success.

3820
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:03,790
Uh,

3821
01:43:03,790 --> 01:43:06,970
having people were very
supportive and my wife,

3822
01:43:06,971 --> 01:43:07,661
who's a huge,

3823
01:43:07,661 --> 01:43:10,120
huge reason I am doing what I'm doing.

3824
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:10,720
I mean,

3825
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:11,800
you know,

3826
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:17,100
to have a wife to deal with the life of
a comedian on the road away from home a

3827
01:43:19,121 --> 01:43:19,720
lot,

3828
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:19,931
I mean,

3829
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:21,130
you've got to have like a strong,

3830
01:43:21,131 --> 01:43:24,760
strong woman to be in your
corner to put up with that.

3831
01:43:24,850 --> 01:43:28,600
Also just to deal with the
Weirdo of fucking comics.

3832
01:43:28,601 --> 01:43:29,440
A weird person.

3833
01:43:29,460 --> 01:43:29,920
Yeah.

3834
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:30,191
I mean,

3835
01:43:30,191 --> 01:43:30,530
just the,

3836
01:43:30,530 --> 01:43:33,250
just the mentality of a comedian is,

3837
01:43:33,251 --> 01:43:33,541
is,

3838
01:43:33,541 --> 01:43:33,801
is,

3839
01:43:33,801 --> 01:43:35,740
is tough to be around.

3840
01:43:35,741 --> 01:43:36,281
Not Tough.

3841
01:43:36,281 --> 01:43:36,731
It's just,

3842
01:43:36,731 --> 01:43:36,971
you know,

3843
01:43:36,971 --> 01:43:37,601
we're always,

3844
01:43:37,601 --> 01:43:38,500
we're always,

3845
01:43:38,501 --> 01:43:38,831
you know,

3846
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:39,970
in our own heads sometime.

3847
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:41,111
So yeah.

3848
01:43:41,111 --> 01:43:43,210
So to answer your question,

3849
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,560
where do I go from here?

3850
01:43:45,610 --> 01:43:46,090
I don't know.

3851
01:43:46,090 --> 01:43:46,781
Uh,

3852
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:46,960
I'm,

3853
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,850
I'm enjoying doing some movies.

3854
01:43:48,851 --> 01:43:52,040
I just started dipping
my toe to some of these

3855
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:53,450
movies at the green book,

3856
01:43:53,451 --> 01:43:54,261
which is out now,

3857
01:43:54,261 --> 01:43:57,410
and a nominated for some
awards for the Oscars.

3858
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:58,730
Happy to be a part of that.

3859
01:43:58,731 --> 01:43:59,331
And then,

3860
01:43:59,331 --> 01:44:00,164
uh,

3861
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:02,000
I like it.

3862
01:44:02,030 --> 01:44:04,190
I exercising a different muscle,

3863
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:04,790
um,

3864
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:06,080
when it comes to acting,

3865
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,640
but not comedic acting.

3866
01:44:07,670 --> 01:44:09,050
I liked the dramas.

3867
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,731
Uh,

3868
01:44:09,731 --> 01:44:10,564
I like,

3869
01:44:10,610 --> 01:44:11,080
uh,

3870
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:11,390
I,

3871
01:44:11,390 --> 01:44:12,830
I'm a serious guy.

3872
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:13,370
Uh,

3873
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:14,420
generally speaking,

3874
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:15,560
I'm not a goof ball.

3875
01:44:15,620 --> 01:44:19,580
I'm not the guy always the center of
attention and it's just not who I am.

3876
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:21,980
So I like kind of being serious and,

3877
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:22,301
and,

3878
01:44:22,301 --> 01:44:22,720
and,

3879
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:26,600
and acting in a drama kind
of place to kind of who I am.

3880
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,400
It's kind of a serious guy.

3881
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:29,623
Uh,

3882
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:31,550
and I like it.

3883
01:44:31,551 --> 01:44:31,680
I,

3884
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:34,310
I get my fix from doing
the stand up on stage.

3885
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:36,320
I don't need to do it in a movie.

3886
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,570
So I liked the challenge number one.

3887
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,640
And number two,

3888
01:44:40,670 --> 01:44:41,503
um,

3889
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:42,500
uh,

3890
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,940
I just liked to do different,

3891
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:46,700
different things a little
bit outside the box.

3892
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:47,510
Um,

3893
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:48,261
so I liked,

3894
01:44:48,261 --> 01:44:49,031
I liked doing it.

3895
01:44:49,031 --> 01:44:49,251
I mean,

3896
01:44:49,251 --> 01:44:51,950
did this gangster movie
coming out with Scorsese and,

3897
01:44:52,030 --> 01:44:52,790
oh shit.

3898
01:44:52,790 --> 01:44:52,970
Yeah,

3899
01:44:52,970 --> 01:44:53,611
that's what it is.

3900
01:44:53,611 --> 01:44:56,870
That it's called the work with Scorsese.

3901
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:57,211
Yeah.

3902
01:44:57,211 --> 01:44:59,940
So it's called the I Shit Irishman.

3903
01:45:00,110 --> 01:45:00,770
What is it about?

3904
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:05,770
It's about basically Jimmy Hoffa
and how they killed him to this guy.

3905
01:45:06,181 --> 01:45:08,100
I de Niro plays the Irishman.

3906
01:45:08,150 --> 01:45:10,250
Jimmy Hoffa is played by Pachino Pat.

3907
01:45:10,251 --> 01:45:11,270
She's in the movie,

3908
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:12,681
so,

3909
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,390
and I played crazy Joe Gallo.

3910
01:45:14,420 --> 01:45:15,230
Um,

3911
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:16,150
and uh,

3912
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:20,390
my first day on the set was
with a de Niro and Peshy.

3913
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:21,011
So,

3914
01:45:21,011 --> 01:45:21,470
uh,

3915
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:23,570
the fuck was that lie?

3916
01:45:23,630 --> 01:45:24,463
Uh,

3917
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:25,400
yeah.

3918
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:26,091
So,

3919
01:45:26,091 --> 01:45:26,924
um,

3920
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:28,033
I was shitting.

3921
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:28,873
I mean there's no,

3922
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:30,230
who is that on the left?

3923
01:45:30,410 --> 01:45:32,420
Pachino get the fuck Outta here.

3924
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:33,560
Wow.

3925
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:36,350
That's incredible.

3926
01:45:37,010 --> 01:45:37,251
I mean,

3927
01:45:37,251 --> 01:45:38,450
maybe it's just that photograph,

3928
01:45:38,451 --> 01:45:40,100
but it barely looks like,

3929
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:40,934
you know,

3930
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:42,210
I know that the,

3931
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:44,450
this is coming out on Netflix.

3932
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:46,190
That's crazy.

3933
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:48,170
How different he looks.

3934
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:51,020
Wow.

3935
01:45:51,020 --> 01:45:52,220
That's a Netflix movie,

3936
01:45:52,221 --> 01:45:52,510
Huh?

3937
01:45:52,510 --> 01:45:52,940
Yeah.

3938
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,110
Fucking Netflix,

3939
01:45:54,111 --> 01:45:54,830
Huh?

3940
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:55,041
Yeah,

3941
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:55,250
it's a,

3942
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:59,750
it's like $145 million project and they,

3943
01:45:59,751 --> 01:46:00,584
uh,

3944
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:02,480
it's coming out on October two.

3945
01:46:02,481 --> 01:46:06,140
What is it like to just being around
Scorsese on a movie set and realize you're

3946
01:46:06,141 --> 01:46:08,390
a fucking actor in a Scorsese movie?

3947
01:46:08,660 --> 01:46:09,493
That's got to be,

3948
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:12,620
I mean that is about as high level as is,

3949
01:46:12,621 --> 01:46:14,570
but it's like either Francis Ford Coppola,

3950
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:15,830
Scorsese,

3951
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:18,620
there's like a few people that
if you're on a set with them,

3952
01:46:19,120 --> 01:46:19,370
you know,

3953
01:46:19,370 --> 01:46:19,761
Kubrick,

3954
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:21,650
when he was alive like Holy Shit,

3955
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:23,570
that was a holy shit moment for me.

3956
01:46:23,571 --> 01:46:24,404
I was,

3957
01:46:24,770 --> 01:46:25,130
listen,

3958
01:46:25,130 --> 01:46:28,520
I am by no stretch of the imagination,

3959
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:33,080
a seasoned actor and then to get
thrown into this group of people,

3960
01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:33,740
uh,

3961
01:46:33,740 --> 01:46:33,971
and,

3962
01:46:33,971 --> 01:46:35,300
and working with them.

3963
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,400
I mean I gotta tell Ya,

3964
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:38,990
there was a sense of doubt.

3965
01:46:38,991 --> 01:46:39,770
Like,

3966
01:46:39,770 --> 01:46:40,011
you know,

3967
01:46:40,011 --> 01:46:40,844
sometimes they're like,

3968
01:46:40,910 --> 01:46:42,470
should I be here?

3969
01:46:43,140 --> 01:46:43,730
You know,

3970
01:46:43,730 --> 01:46:44,040
is,

3971
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:44,601
is this,

3972
01:46:44,601 --> 01:46:45,440
is this happening?

3973
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:46,610
And then you know,

3974
01:46:46,670 --> 01:46:48,740
to do the scene with the neuro and Peshy.

3975
01:46:49,500 --> 01:46:50,070
It was almost

3976
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,140
like after the first scene,

3977
01:46:52,141 --> 01:46:52,740
I'm like,

3978
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,450
Oh yeah,

3979
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:55,800
I should be here.

3980
01:46:55,830 --> 01:46:57,570
It's all the anticipation,

3981
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:02,550
a leading up to the moment
that is unfamiliar to you.

3982
01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:04,560
Then once you do it,

3983
01:47:04,561 --> 01:47:05,371
you feel like,

3984
01:47:05,371 --> 01:47:05,821
man,

3985
01:47:05,821 --> 01:47:06,310
I,

3986
01:47:06,310 --> 01:47:10,830
that was all in my head and I made
it sound like it was going to be,

3987
01:47:11,450 --> 01:47:13,050
cause I was just thinking
the negative too.

3988
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:13,591
I always think,

3989
01:47:13,591 --> 01:47:13,711
oh,

3990
01:47:13,711 --> 01:47:15,180
I'm going to screw this up and this.

3991
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:15,690
And that's the way,

3992
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:16,770
that's what motivates me.

3993
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:17,940
I never looked in the positive,

3994
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:19,530
always come from a negative place.

3995
01:47:20,130 --> 01:47:20,551
But,

3996
01:47:20,551 --> 01:47:21,061
uh,

3997
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:21,691
once,

3998
01:47:21,691 --> 01:47:23,580
once I did that first scene
with them and they were,

3999
01:47:23,850 --> 01:47:26,490
these guys were more than uh,

4000
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:27,353
helpful,

4001
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:27,721
uh,

4002
01:47:27,721 --> 01:47:28,710
working with them.

4003
01:47:28,711 --> 01:47:28,950
I mean,

4004
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:29,671
Scorsese,

4005
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:30,331
when he came out,

4006
01:47:30,331 --> 01:47:31,350
it was friendly.

4007
01:47:31,351 --> 01:47:32,041
Nice.

4008
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:32,550
You know,

4009
01:47:32,550 --> 01:47:33,480
it was,

4010
01:47:33,481 --> 01:47:37,020
it was encouraging to be around
that kind of positive energy.

4011
01:47:37,170 --> 01:47:38,880
Did you have a hard time
sleeping the night before?

4012
01:47:38,940 --> 01:47:39,773
Oh yeah.

4013
01:47:40,190 --> 01:47:40,771
I didn't sleep,

4014
01:47:40,771 --> 01:47:43,860
I don't think for the first
week leading up to the scene.

4015
01:47:44,010 --> 01:47:44,820
Um,

4016
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:48,900
because I knew it was going to be with
De Niro and Peshy when they did was they

4017
01:47:48,901 --> 01:47:52,530
took Gotham comedy club in New York
City and they made it the Copa Cabana,

4018
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:57,000
which I thought was fitting because
Gotham comedy club is kind of where I did

4019
01:47:57,001 --> 01:47:58,650
all my standup in New York.

4020
01:47:58,651 --> 01:47:59,930
I didn't really do any other club,

4021
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,350
but Gotham and then here,

4022
01:48:01,351 --> 01:48:01,920
Great Club,

4023
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,720
Great Club,

4024
01:48:02,720 --> 01:48:05,430
[inaudible] brothers who
run it are fantastic guys.

4025
01:48:06,030 --> 01:48:06,601
And,

4026
01:48:06,601 --> 01:48:07,110
uh,

4027
01:48:07,110 --> 01:48:07,411
they,

4028
01:48:07,411 --> 01:48:12,411
they stayed transformed the Gotham
comedy club into the Copa Cabana.

4029
01:48:13,500 --> 01:48:14,161
And,

4030
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:14,970
uh,

4031
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:17,370
Don Rickles is played by Jim Norton.

4032
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:18,390
Uh,

4033
01:48:18,390 --> 01:48:19,590
no shit,

4034
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:20,903
I'm watching.

4035
01:48:20,910 --> 01:48:24,780
I'm watching him on stage with,

4036
01:48:24,781 --> 01:48:25,614
um,

4037
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,900
it's just crazy.

4038
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:28,211
And he's like,

4039
01:48:28,211 --> 01:48:28,310
yeah,

4040
01:48:28,310 --> 01:48:28,541
no,

4041
01:48:28,541 --> 01:48:29,390
it's perfect.

4042
01:48:29,391 --> 01:48:30,224
Rickles.

4043
01:48:30,350 --> 01:48:31,430
I'm just thinking about that.

4044
01:48:31,431 --> 01:48:32,720
He's perfect for that.

4045
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:35,090
He really did a fantastic job.

4046
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:35,811
Really,

4047
01:48:35,811 --> 01:48:37,190
really did a great smile.

4048
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:37,731
Smiles.

4049
01:48:37,731 --> 01:48:39,340
Almost like Rickles ask.

4050
01:48:39,710 --> 01:48:39,981
Yeah,

4051
01:48:39,981 --> 01:48:40,814
they gave him a little bit.

4052
01:48:42,820 --> 01:48:43,653
Ah,

4053
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:44,431
oh,

4054
01:48:44,431 --> 01:48:45,600
that's fantastic.

4055
01:48:45,601 --> 01:48:46,400
Cast and great.

4056
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,191
Wow.

4057
01:48:47,191 --> 01:48:47,491
I mean,

4058
01:48:47,491 --> 01:48:48,220
come on.

4059
01:48:48,220 --> 01:48:48,740
Slow.

4060
01:48:48,740 --> 01:48:50,040
The fuck else would be better.

4061
01:48:50,041 --> 01:48:51,640
You got to get them fat
that they fattened him off.

4062
01:48:52,650 --> 01:48:54,060
Did he give him makeup to fatten up?

4063
01:48:54,061 --> 01:48:54,840
But they make him eat.

4064
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:55,201
Uh,

4065
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:55,681
they made them,

4066
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:59,070
I think they made them bald
and they gave him a fat suit.

4067
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:00,270
No Shit.

4068
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:01,620
Wow.

4069
01:49:01,710 --> 01:49:03,690
So that's amazing.

4070
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,261
I mean,

4071
01:49:04,261 --> 01:49:08,250
the Jim Norton's a guy known for what
the 20 years and now I'm sitting there

4072
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:10,920
watching him as Don Rickles in a movie.

4073
01:49:10,921 --> 01:49:12,240
It was just blowing my mind,

4074
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:13,290
just blowing my mind.

4075
01:49:13,320 --> 01:49:15,510
But this thing is going to be,

4076
01:49:15,930 --> 01:49:16,561
I can't wait to see it.

4077
01:49:16,561 --> 01:49:18,180
I didn't see any of the movie,

4078
01:49:18,181 --> 01:49:19,230
even when I was doing it.

4079
01:49:19,231 --> 01:49:20,910
I even look at what I was doing.

4080
01:49:20,970 --> 01:49:21,631
So,

4081
01:49:21,631 --> 01:49:22,560
uh,

4082
01:49:22,710 --> 01:49:22,921
yeah,

4083
01:49:22,921 --> 01:49:24,930
I'm really excited to see
what this thing looks like.

4084
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:25,770
God Damn,

4085
01:49:25,770 --> 01:49:26,700
that's phenomenal.

4086
01:49:26,701 --> 01:49:27,810
What a milestone.

4087
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:32,160
A movie with Deniro output Chino,

4088
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:33,680
Joe Judge has,

4089
01:49:33,690 --> 01:49:37,570
she a fucking Scorsese
film Harvie cartels.

4090
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:38,970
Holy Shit.

4091
01:49:39,240 --> 01:49:40,940
By Bobby kind of allies in it.

4092
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:42,110
Harvey cartel.

4093
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:43,890
A lot of people never
saw the bad lieutenant.

4094
01:49:44,450 --> 01:49:45,610
Did you ever see the middle of the 10?

4095
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:46,161
I've never seen it.

4096
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:47,040
Oh my God,

4097
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,130
the Carby Kai tell has

4098
01:49:48,130 --> 01:49:50,440
been amazing and virtually
everything he's ever done.

4099
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:55,030
But the bad lieutenant is one of those
movies that's so fucked up and so crazy.

4100
01:49:55,290 --> 01:49:57,340
And it was a about a bad cop,

4101
01:49:57,400 --> 01:50:00,700
like all fucking really bad co and uh,

4102
01:50:00,730 --> 01:50:01,810
like completely,

4103
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:03,370
totally out of control.

4104
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:05,590
But it is one of those
movies where after it's over,

4105
01:50:05,770 --> 01:50:08,260
you know the credits roll and you just
sitting there trying to catch your breath

4106
01:50:08,261 --> 01:50:08,680
just going,

4107
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:09,461
Jesus Christ,

4108
01:50:09,461 --> 01:50:10,840
what the fuck did I just watch?

4109
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:13,720
There's a AH,

4110
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:18,430
without Jackie was it says 93 but they
remade it with Nicholas cage a couple of

4111
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:20,470
years ago to get the fuck
out of here was not bad.

4112
01:50:21,720 --> 01:50:22,330
It's not the same.

4113
01:50:22,330 --> 01:50:23,163
No,

4114
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:24,543
no.

4115
01:50:25,270 --> 01:50:26,200
I love Nicolas Cage,

4116
01:50:26,201 --> 01:50:27,034
but no,

4117
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,730
you stick to driving that Eleanor
Mustang and gone in 60 seconds.

4118
01:50:30,731 --> 01:50:32,770
You can't be bad lieutenant
you son of a bitch.

4119
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:33,821
Nothing.

4120
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,660
You're not a great actor,

4121
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:35,800
but look,

4122
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:36,220
it's just,

4123
01:50:36,220 --> 01:50:40,870
there's certain guys that take
over a role and to do that again,

4124
01:50:40,871 --> 01:50:41,890
like here's one,

4125
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,230
like say if they offered you taxi driver,

4126
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:44,711
they say,

4127
01:50:44,711 --> 01:50:45,250
hey,

4128
01:50:45,250 --> 01:50:46,810
we're going to do taxi driver again.

4129
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:47,621
You'd have to be like,

4130
01:50:47,621 --> 01:50:47,771
yeah,

4131
01:50:47,771 --> 01:50:50,500
good luck cast and somebody else
get the fuck away from me with that.

4132
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:52,540
You can't be,

4133
01:50:52,870 --> 01:50:55,870
you can't be Dinero in taxi
driver unless you're deniro.

4134
01:50:55,871 --> 01:50:57,940
Like that movie Cape Fear.

4135
01:50:57,941 --> 01:50:59,800
Another one he nailed.

4136
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:00,130
It's by,

4137
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:00,581
by the way,

4138
01:51:00,581 --> 01:51:01,990
Kate fear was,

4139
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:06,610
I think someone else was
that character before.

4140
01:51:06,611 --> 01:51:11,230
I think Robert Mitchum I think played
the same role that Deniro played,

4141
01:51:12,520 --> 01:51:13,900
but I didn't know that when I saw it,

4142
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:14,591
when I saw it.

4143
01:51:14,591 --> 01:51:16,230
I just thought it's fucking denier.

4144
01:51:16,231 --> 01:51:17,710
I can 62 there it is.

4145
01:51:17,740 --> 01:51:18,370
Yeah,

4146
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:19,780
but if they tried to do it today,

4147
01:51:19,781 --> 01:51:21,130
like get the fuck out of here.

4148
01:51:21,310 --> 01:51:21,551
No,

4149
01:51:21,551 --> 01:51:21,761
no,

4150
01:51:21,761 --> 01:51:22,001
no,

4151
01:51:22,001 --> 01:51:22,211
no,

4152
01:51:22,211 --> 01:51:22,421
no,

4153
01:51:22,421 --> 01:51:22,691
no,

4154
01:51:22,691 --> 01:51:22,990
no.

4155
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:23,740
You can't.

4156
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:24,790
Especially taxi drivers,

4157
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:26,790
you can't recreate that
role with another actor.

4158
01:51:27,340 --> 01:51:28,570
No bad lieutenant.

4159
01:51:28,600 --> 01:51:29,321
Nobody's seen that.

4160
01:51:29,321 --> 01:51:30,690
Nicolas cage bad lieutenant.

4161
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:32,170
Even Nicolas Cage
probably didn't watch it.

4162
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:35,530
It might've been like a sequel.

4163
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:37,940
I don't know if it was a remake
cause it's called port of call.

4164
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,630
Like it's got an extension on the
end of the port of call New Orleans.

4165
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:42,310
It's called bad lieutenant
port of call New Orleans.

4166
01:51:42,460 --> 01:51:42,701
Yeah,

4167
01:51:42,701 --> 01:51:43,540
I heard about that.

4168
01:51:43,780 --> 01:51:44,110
Yeah.

4169
01:51:44,110 --> 01:51:44,800
Yeah.

4170
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:45,970
That's the Nicholas cage one.

4171
01:51:45,971 --> 01:51:46,190
Yeah.

4172
01:51:46,190 --> 01:51:46,900
Okay.

4173
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:49,390
So they tried to piggy back
on her or some shit like that.

4174
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:50,380
Yeah,

4175
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:53,500
but whenever that Harvey
Keitel version is holy Shit,

4176
01:51:53,530 --> 01:51:54,670
but he's creating everything.

4177
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:56,950
He was great and pulp fiction
and he's great and everything.

4178
01:51:57,280 --> 01:51:57,650
Yeah.

4179
01:51:57,650 --> 01:51:58,070
Nice.

4180
01:51:58,070 --> 01:51:59,170
A fantastic actor.

4181
01:51:59,171 --> 01:51:59,950
And they really,

4182
01:51:59,950 --> 01:52:01,600
I mean the people in this movie are,

4183
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:03,130
what's it like hanging
out with those guys?

4184
01:52:03,340 --> 01:52:03,791
I listen,

4185
01:52:03,791 --> 01:52:04,450
Joe,

4186
01:52:04,450 --> 01:52:05,410
when I went in there,

4187
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:06,730
I told myself,

4188
01:52:06,760 --> 01:52:08,440
I ain't talking to nobody,

4189
01:52:09,970 --> 01:52:13,540
I'm going to speak when spoken to,

4190
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:17,380
there was a part when they were
kind of lighting Deniro and I,

4191
01:52:17,710 --> 01:52:21,490
and were standing face to face and he's
looking at me and I'm looking right at

4192
01:52:21,491 --> 01:52:21,970
him and um,

4193
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:23,320
I wasn't gonna say nothing.

4194
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,620
And then he comes in on my tiny,

4195
01:52:27,070 --> 01:52:30,520
tiny needs to be tight and a
little bit and he sensed my thigh.

4196
01:52:34,170 --> 01:52:35,690
He straightened out.

4197
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:37,990
So yeah,

4198
01:52:37,991 --> 01:52:38,950
I had a wig.

4199
01:52:39,490 --> 01:52:40,750
They put me in a wig.

4200
01:52:40,780 --> 01:52:42,190
And what kind of wig would it look like?

4201
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:43,241
Actually,

4202
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:43,631
there's there,

4203
01:52:43,631 --> 01:52:44,530
there that if you,

4204
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:46,490
if you type up Sebastian Maniscalco

4205
01:52:46,490 --> 01:52:47,470
Irishman that it,

4206
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:48,650
it should pop up.

4207
01:52:49,180 --> 01:52:49,750
Like,

4208
01:52:49,750 --> 01:52:50,001
yeah,

4209
01:52:50,001 --> 01:52:50,720
there it is.

4210
01:52:50,720 --> 01:52:51,553
What is the difference?

4211
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:54,590
I'm so confused.

4212
01:52:54,650 --> 01:52:55,730
Why did they give you a wig?

4213
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:56,551
It,

4214
01:52:56,551 --> 01:52:58,070
Scott's side burns.

4215
01:52:58,071 --> 01:52:58,311
I mean,

4216
01:52:58,311 --> 01:52:58,611
if you,

4217
01:52:58,611 --> 01:53:00,050
if you see it in person,

4218
01:53:00,051 --> 01:53:01,630
you'll understand maybe why I have,

4219
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:02,673
but uh,

4220
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:03,111
yeah,

4221
01:53:03,111 --> 01:53:03,281
it's,

4222
01:53:03,281 --> 01:53:05,600
it's not that much of a departure from,

4223
01:53:05,630 --> 01:53:06,310
from my,

4224
01:53:06,310 --> 01:53:07,011
my real hair.

4225
01:53:07,011 --> 01:53:07,361
But,

4226
01:53:07,361 --> 01:53:08,194
uh,

4227
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:11,240
did they give you the option to grow
inside burns and you like get the fuck out

4228
01:53:11,241 --> 01:53:11,310
of,

4229
01:53:11,310 --> 01:53:12,143
you know,

4230
01:53:12,410 --> 01:53:13,243
again,

4231
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:14,540
I didn't say nothing.

4232
01:53:14,541 --> 01:53:14,841
They said,

4233
01:53:14,841 --> 01:53:15,680
you're going to wear a wig,

4234
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:16,880
no problem.

4235
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:17,720
Whatever you want me to do.

4236
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:19,400
Scorsese was like,

4237
01:53:19,401 --> 01:53:19,880
um,

4238
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:20,331
okay.

4239
01:53:20,331 --> 01:53:20,780
Um,

4240
01:53:20,780 --> 01:53:24,620
there's a part where I'm going to
go through a window and he's like,

4241
01:53:24,621 --> 01:53:24,831
okay,

4242
01:53:24,831 --> 01:53:25,850
when you go through the window,

4243
01:53:25,851 --> 01:53:26,181
and I'm like,

4244
01:53:26,181 --> 01:53:27,014
Oh,

4245
01:53:27,050 --> 01:53:28,010
I'm going to a window.

4246
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:29,780
Because I knew there was
a stunt guy involved.

4247
01:53:29,781 --> 01:53:30,614
Right.

4248
01:53:30,740 --> 01:53:34,160
But he's telling me that I'm going to
go to the window and I wasn't going to

4249
01:53:34,161 --> 01:53:34,880
say,

4250
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:36,170
I don't do windows.

4251
01:53:37,180 --> 01:53:40,010
You want me to go to window to a window?

4252
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,090
I'm not gonna tell Martin Scorsese op,

4253
01:53:42,091 --> 01:53:42,501
sorry.

4254
01:53:42,501 --> 01:53:42,681
I,

4255
01:53:42,681 --> 01:53:43,040
uh,

4256
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:43,873
need a stunt guy.

4257
01:53:44,810 --> 01:53:45,381
But then they said,

4258
01:53:45,381 --> 01:53:46,240
hey Marty,

4259
01:53:46,241 --> 01:53:47,300
there is a stunt guy here.

4260
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:47,780
He goes,

4261
01:53:47,780 --> 01:53:48,251
oh,

4262
01:53:48,251 --> 01:53:48,620
okay.

4263
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:49,131
So,

4264
01:53:49,131 --> 01:53:49,520
uh,

4265
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,930
I was ready to go through the window.

4266
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,790
I went through a window on news radio.

4267
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,410
Nick Dipaolo threw me through a window.

4268
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:54,921
Is that right?

4269
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:55,754
Yeah,

4270
01:53:57,730 --> 01:53:58,120
it's,

4271
01:53:58,120 --> 01:53:58,940
it's easy.

4272
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:00,410
They're made out of sugar glass.

4273
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:02,150
You just go right through it.

4274
01:54:02,750 --> 01:54:03,320
It's weird.

4275
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,720
It feels like nothing like
a tissue paper or something.

4276
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:06,554
It's very strange.

4277
01:54:07,580 --> 01:54:08,390
I was like,

4278
01:54:08,390 --> 01:54:08,930
whatever,

4279
01:54:08,930 --> 01:54:09,763
whatever it,

4280
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:11,060
whatever it takes.

4281
01:54:11,061 --> 01:54:12,530
Scorsese wants me to go through it.

4282
01:54:12,531 --> 01:54:15,380
I mean the guy went through the stunt
double one through and he cut his hand.

4283
01:54:15,530 --> 01:54:15,651
Oh,

4284
01:54:15,651 --> 01:54:16,310
did he really?

4285
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:17,170
So I dunno what,

4286
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,133
what it was.

4287
01:54:18,170 --> 01:54:19,003
Oh,

4288
01:54:20,120 --> 01:54:21,230
if I would've went through to win though,

4289
01:54:21,231 --> 01:54:21,560
Jo,

4290
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:22,370
I would've been dead.

4291
01:54:22,370 --> 01:54:23,990
So he's such a cycle.

4292
01:54:23,991 --> 01:54:25,520
He might've made the guy
go through real glass,

4293
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:27,341
you know,

4294
01:54:27,341 --> 01:54:28,031
he might've been like,

4295
01:54:28,031 --> 01:54:30,010
this is just not realistic enough.

4296
01:54:30,040 --> 01:54:32,710
This 500 extra dollars,

4297
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:33,910
the sugar glass,

4298
01:54:33,911 --> 01:54:34,601
whatever it is,

4299
01:54:34,601 --> 01:54:35,470
it's not going to work.

4300
01:54:35,500 --> 01:54:35,880
But,

4301
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:36,051
uh,

4302
01:54:36,051 --> 01:54:39,430
I guess you could probably cut yourself
on that sugar glass shit if you landed

4303
01:54:39,431 --> 01:54:40,030
wrong.

4304
01:54:40,030 --> 01:54:40,361
I mean,

4305
01:54:40,361 --> 01:54:41,980
if it was sticking up wrong,

4306
01:54:41,981 --> 01:54:43,360
you placed your hand funny.

4307
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:44,863
Makes Sense.

4308
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:48,130
That's what it could cut
yourself a little bit.

4309
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:49,001
But yeah,

4310
01:54:49,001 --> 01:54:49,300
the,

4311
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:49,580
the,

4312
01:54:49,580 --> 01:54:50,470
those exciting,

4313
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:53,770
it's been really exciting for
me to last three or four years,

4314
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:54,240
um,

4315
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:54,640
to,

4316
01:54:54,640 --> 01:54:56,830
to have these opportunities
to do these things.

4317
01:54:56,831 --> 01:54:57,664
And um,

4318
01:54:58,630 --> 01:54:59,021
yeah,

4319
01:54:59,021 --> 01:54:59,400
it's,

4320
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:00,100
uh,

4321
01:55:00,100 --> 01:55:00,933
that's great.

4322
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:01,471
Listen man,

4323
01:55:01,471 --> 01:55:06,150
it's been awesome to see
because I remember you first
starting out at the comedy

4324
01:55:06,151 --> 01:55:06,480
store.

4325
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:07,261
I really do.

4326
01:55:07,261 --> 01:55:10,590
I remember you from the late nineties
just trying to get your shit together.

4327
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:12,900
And we did a lot of shows together,

4328
01:55:12,901 --> 01:55:13,530
man.

4329
01:55:13,530 --> 01:55:13,891
You know,

4330
01:55:13,891 --> 01:55:18,270
and then you really came into your own
and that during the time that I was away

4331
01:55:18,630 --> 01:55:19,260
and uh,

4332
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:20,290
I was hearing from some,

4333
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:20,461
you know,

4334
01:55:20,461 --> 01:55:21,330
comics always talk,

4335
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,820
I was hearing from so many
people how hard you were killing,

4336
01:55:24,120 --> 01:55:24,481
you know,

4337
01:55:24,481 --> 01:55:28,170
so many people were saying you were
doing great and you've always been like a

4338
01:55:28,171 --> 01:55:29,340
real easy guy,

4339
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:31,200
real easy guy to hang out with,

4340
01:55:31,201 --> 01:55:32,370
real easy guy to talk to.

4341
01:55:32,380 --> 01:55:34,560
So to see you blow up like this
has been just fucking good.

4342
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:34,920
Awesome.

4343
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,480
Well I think I appreciate that Joe.

4344
01:55:36,481 --> 01:55:40,230
And we've known each other for a while
and you're right at the time that you

4345
01:55:40,231 --> 01:55:41,880
were away from the comedy store,

4346
01:55:42,660 --> 01:55:43,710
I think kind of,

4347
01:55:43,940 --> 01:55:44,060
you

4348
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:44,220
know,

4349
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:46,140
found my voice in the beginning there.

4350
01:55:46,210 --> 01:55:47,940
It was really tough for me to,

4351
01:55:48,090 --> 01:55:48,570
you know,

4352
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:49,260
to,

4353
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:49,560
you know,

4354
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:50,310
find a war.

4355
01:55:50,310 --> 01:55:51,143
I mean,

4356
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:52,280
I think I talked to,

4357
01:55:52,340 --> 01:55:54,240
talked about this the last
time I was on the cast,

4358
01:55:54,241 --> 01:55:58,440
I was trying to like different shirts
that come through to come would it's my

4359
01:55:58,441 --> 01:56:02,310
nipples hanging out and
like a leopard shirt.

4360
01:56:02,311 --> 01:56:03,091
I thought it was cool.

4361
01:56:03,091 --> 01:56:03,251
I,

4362
01:56:03,251 --> 01:56:03,510
yeah,

4363
01:56:03,510 --> 01:56:04,270
it was one of those things.

4364
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:05,370
You as a young comedian,

4365
01:56:05,371 --> 01:56:07,520
you train all these different
things out who you are

4366
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,140
it out in the lion's den too.

4367
01:56:10,410 --> 01:56:11,243
You know,

4368
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:15,120
I mean you are in the fucking
belly of the beast trying out.

4369
01:56:15,121 --> 01:56:15,730
Stand up.

4370
01:56:15,730 --> 01:56:16,630
It's very hard to do.

4371
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:17,340
Yeah.

4372
01:56:17,340 --> 01:56:17,671
But,

4373
01:56:17,671 --> 01:56:18,480
um,

4374
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:18,840
no,

4375
01:56:18,840 --> 01:56:19,080

4376
01:56:19,080 --> 01:56:20,160

the years and having me on the,

4383
01:56:25,120 --> 01:56:27,000

4384
01:56:27,060 --> 01:56:27,893

Well I don't take you if we're
going to need the brother.
