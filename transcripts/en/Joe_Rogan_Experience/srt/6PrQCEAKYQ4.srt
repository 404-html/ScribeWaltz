00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:02,850
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:05,130
I know a dude who thought
he was buying a stereo,

3
00:00:05,131 --> 00:00:06,480
but he's actually buying bricks.

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:09,250
He got one of those stereotypes.

5
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,580
He's a fucking half a month ago.

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,350
He stopped at the street and
bought from a guy named Jamal.

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,100
I had a guy,

8
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,360
I was buying pet food.

9
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:16,590
I pulled into this parking spot.

10
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:19,800
I got out and this dude literally opened
the van like he was going to take me in

11
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,400
and fuck me.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,600
Like I was like some little kid.

13
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:25,560
He was about to scoop up out of the woods
like it was a molester and I'm like,

14
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,040
what?

15
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,790
Like what do you,

16
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,361
what do you got?

17
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:27,960
And he's like,

18
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,560
stereotypes,

19
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,580
you want buy stereo.

20
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,630
I was like,

21
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,560
this is the weirdest.

22
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,100
He's.

23
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,750
He opened up the door like as people
parked the car and it was literally like,

24
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:36,900
go,

25
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,560
hey man,

26
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,393
you want some of this?

27
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,420
Like what?

28
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,420
You're asking for trouble if you
do business one of those guys,

29
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,580
most obvious shit ever.

30
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:45,361
You know,

31
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,600
he's just randomly trying to sell
a stereo to the back of a van.

32
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:48,991
Now.

33
00:00:48,991 --> 00:00:51,600
What are these things
that they do in whatever?

34
00:00:51,601 --> 00:00:53,340
Like the people go when they have,

35
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:54,620
what do they junk junkets.

36
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,310
Junkets.

37
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,541
No,

38
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:56,640
no,

39
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:56,761
no.

40
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,230
I'm sorry.

41
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:59,070
The thing off the fucking five,

42
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,580
the you always see in the movies and
all the fucking Friday they all go to a

43
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,421
place and they,

44
00:01:05,421 --> 00:01:05,581
they,

45
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:07,590
they buy stereos and raider hats.

46
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,110
Swap swap me.

47
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,033
Oh yeah.

48
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,880
Well in that way it's a swap
meet in Jersey that called,

49
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:16,951
what do they call you?

50
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,640
Market?

51
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,473
Something like that.

52
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,490
When I was a kid I used to go to
where they used to do the bicycles,

53
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:28,491
whatever those street car races and next
door to it they had what was called and

54
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,460
you'd go there and they had
pretty much shit that was stolen.

55
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,830
It was just a festival and they tries
to a table fee because everything was 50

56
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,664
percent off.

57
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,930
Even the sneakers I remember and then we
found that that the guy would go to the

58
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:46,680
fucking factory and jump
over the fence and take over

59
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:48,841
the sneakers.

60
00:01:48,841 --> 00:01:49,740
No mistakes.

61
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,340
Irregulars he,

62
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,980
they would take those and just
sell them at those swap swap meets.

63
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,590
And then we found that
we cut into his action.

64
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:02,390
I just want it gone.

65
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:02,770
We,

66
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,070
we,

67
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:06,890
we cut into that action
and the action limit,

68
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,890
those tubes are blocked.

69
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,330
Best Prank,

70
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,120
they would throw thousands of amount
with little things like the chemical was

71
00:02:12,121 --> 00:02:12,390
off.

72
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,620
You start blinking too much,

73
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,670
like the chemical.

74
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,170
Then it was pepper spray,

75
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,671
pepper spray,

76
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:22,950
like people would spray it
and you can see what happened.

77
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,851
It's not regular,

78
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,361
but Naka.

79
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,530
What does that tear gas.

80
00:02:25,531 --> 00:02:26,940
It was like the tickets.

81
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,250
This band is good.

82
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:35,280
That was afterthought and we make them
jump the fence and we'd have thousands of

83
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:39,870
tubes and we'd sell them for fifty cents
a piece on Monday the sixth and seventh

84
00:02:39,871 --> 00:02:40,710
grade I virus,

85
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,960
but there wasn't always
three kids that complain.

86
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:44,800
There was a little like
the chemical imbalances

87
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,450
I've been saying for awhile,

88
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,630
but I think Caitlyn Jenner
created Donald Trump.

89
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,530
Not really,

90
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:54,480
but it created this thing.

91
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:54,711
I mean,

92
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,100
I think there was a thing,

93
00:02:56,101 --> 00:03:01,101
there was a tipping point and for me it
was when they gave her a woman of the

94
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:05,950
year and Glamour magazine and then Espn
gave her as an athlete of the year and

95
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,170
when we're that ridiculous thing that
they did where they circled her house,

96
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:12,510
so the helicopter and she was hiding
behind the curtains and it was all

97
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,370
mysterious like why in
the fuck are you selling?

98
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,780
Like what is this?

99
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,380
And for people at home that are like in
Indiana and they're drinking beer and

100
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:24,250
they like football and they went to
watch the sbs to see who won best

101
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,470
quarterback of the year and
they're seeing that kind of shit.

102
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:26,771
They're like,

103
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:30,610
what the fuck is as we need
to make America great again.

104
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,200
You know,

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,800
I never linked it that specifically,

106
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:33,910
but I think you're totally right.

107
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:36,940
Even right now when I've been watching
the NBA season just started and I love

108
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:37,774
basketball.

109
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,760
Every time I turn on TNT now it's Barkley
and Kenny Smith and Shaq and Ernie

110
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,660
Johnson talking about race.

111
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,130
They're not talking about basketball.

112
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,061
They're talking about race.

113
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:47,080
They're talking about policing,

114
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,930
those are all important
issues to talk about,

115
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,350
but people go to sports for the release,

116
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:55,810
they go to sports because they care about
that leads and what's happening on the

117
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:56,644
field and in the,

118
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,670
in the box and imagine whatever it
is and now everything is becoming

119
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,510
politicized.

120
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:05,140
So espn is giving their athlete
of the year to Caitlyn Jenner.

121
00:04:05,141 --> 00:04:06,280
It makes no freaking sense.

122
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:06,461
Well,

123
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,290
that was a white nfl ratings down.

124
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:08,501
You know,

125
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:13,210
it's because people are talking about
Kaepernick and politics instead of sports.

126
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,290
Does that make the ratings go down?

127
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,133
Really is the ratings.

128
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,160
The ratings are hugely down in the NFL
this year and a lot of people are linking

129
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:18,340
that.

130
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,810
I don't know it empirically.

131
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,980
I wouldn't be shocked.

132
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,010
There's a lot of people in this
country just have zero tolerance.

133
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,050
I mean it's almost like
separation of church and state.

134
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,290
They would like their sports to
just be sports and about sports.

135
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:29,830
Yeah.

136
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,161
You know,

137
00:04:30,161 --> 00:04:30,531
and I,

138
00:04:30,531 --> 00:04:33,010
I kind of appreciate that in a certain
way because it's like if you were

139
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,860
watching a comedy show and all of a sudden
during that comedy show they started

140
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:40,861
deeply discussing religion and like
really like discussing deep intricacies of

141
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,610
different faith based cultures.

142
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:44,951
You'd be like,

143
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,200
what the fuck am I want?

144
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,960
This is not comedy do is funny.

145
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,670
But once you heard in that thing and
now you're doing something else right,

146
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:52,690
you're doing a different thing.

147
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,770
You're not doing sports,

148
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:54,370
you're doing,

149
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,690
you're doing race relations,

150
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,543
are you doing?

151
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,670
But I don't understand that.

152
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:01,210
It's also they look at it as a platform
for our culture and that's what

153
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:02,050
Kaepernick did.

154
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,561
He said,

155
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:02,741
look,

156
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,700
I have this platform.

157
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,150
And in some ways I think what he did
kind of worked because a lot of kids in

158
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:10,390
high school now are doing that.

159
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:12,070
They're taking knees and the national,

160
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,431
you know,

161
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,720
when they do the national anthem,

162
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,043
it's strange,

163
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,630
but it's also like the black,

164
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,460
uh,

165
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,990
like when people have the
black fist at the Olympics,

166
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:20,141
who,

167
00:05:20,141 --> 00:05:22,160
those dudes that did that in the 19 seven,

168
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,650
I think it was 71.

169
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,920
Maybe something like that.

170
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,530
Whatever that was.

171
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:31,090
I mean that got people talk and this gets
people talking to and maybe sometimes

172
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:36,091
you need to kind of inject some sort of
something to think about during sporting

173
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:37,160
events.

174
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,770
I'm not telling them not to do it.

175
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,360
Of course I would.

176
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
Net cabernet wants to do that.

177
00:05:40,961 --> 00:05:41,410
Go ahead.

178
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:41,861
These guys,

179
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,160
if,

180
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,250
if Barkley and all that one,

181
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,010
if they're tnt bosses are
okay with it and they go,

182
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:46,310
well,

183
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,550
you know,

184
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,141
you can do that.

185
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:49,090
Instead of talking about how
many points Duran had been,

186
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:49,924
so be it,

187
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,190
but I'm just saying what I think most
people want from sports is an escape.

188
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,070
And I can tell you for sure in the two
or three at the NBA season has been

189
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,340
gone.

190
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,070
Every time I flipped by
TNT and they're doing that,

191
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,173
I change it.

192
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,680
When those homeless people
were breaking in my house,

193
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:04,700
joy drove by every night.

194
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,860
How many homeless people
broke into your house?

195
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:07,650
A couple.

196
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,620
Really because we were under construction.

197
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,300
We're renovating.

198
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,540
Oh No.

199
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,590
First one broke in a Brumby's.

200
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,640
Very similar.

201
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,133
You can't scare them.

202
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,460
Really?

203
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:24,730
Yeah.

204
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,563
I was sitting.

205
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,160
I.

206
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,640
We had dinner at my sister's house.

207
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,900
The girls went inside.

208
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,400
Everything's under construction.

209
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,440
We've got like a big dumpster out front.

210
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,340
It looks like it's under construction
and I'm sitting off to the side smoking a

211
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:40,060
cigar in the darkness and this
girl just starts walking in,

212
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,440
walking up the driveway,

213
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,840
starts to go into our backyard
and I see her and I'm like,

214
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,111
wait,

215
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:44,590
do I know?

216
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:45,190
I must know her.

217
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,440
It's a weird thing when you
get robbed that you're like,

218
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,630
it's like a such a
confrontation that you're like,

219
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,020
like if you ever been like been in
conversation and someone's like,

220
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:53,351
hey man.

221
00:06:53,351 --> 00:06:53,950
And you're like,

222
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,101
oh,

223
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:55,030
I must have this person high.

224
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,020
And then they attack you and you're like,

225
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:56,740
oh fuck.

226
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,760
This is how it starts.

227
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,190
That that was what happened in this girl
was just going back here and I go and

228
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,310
we must know her and I go,

229
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:03,730
Hey,

230
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,420
can I help you?

231
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,253
And then she was like,

232
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,281
oh hey.

233
00:07:06,281 --> 00:07:11,281
And she like said something like I work
for the dwp or some child's organization

234
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:12,760
something.

235
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,151
And I was like,

236
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,391
no,

237
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:13,871
this is,

238
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:14,530
this is,

239
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:19,530
you're breaking into my backyard and I
start fucking shouting at her and she

240
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:21,610
just keeps walking towards me.

241
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,720
She's not fucking scared at all.

242
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,900
Priscilla is 130 pound bull mastiff obese.

243
00:07:25,901 --> 00:07:28,750
Have a fucking dog is going at her,

244
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,640
like leaping at her and all this.

245
00:07:30,641 --> 00:07:33,660
Keeping up as a little tiny like dog
fence that we had in our front yard at the

246
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,503
time.

247
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,610
Fearless this woman was.

248
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,650
You couldn't shake her hair.

249
00:07:38,651 --> 00:07:39,940
I think a heroin addict probably.

250
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,050
Yeah.

251
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:41,420
And,

252
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,000
and I was like,

253
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:43,601
motherfuckers,

254
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:44,280
we call the cops.

255
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,160
Then the cops show up.

256
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:46,510
I don't remember when Shit's on cops.

257
00:07:46,511 --> 00:07:47,170
I love them.

258
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,280
They showed up in three minutes.

259
00:07:48,281 --> 00:07:49,360
They were there three minutes.

260
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,680
The woman had already taken off.

261
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,770
I told them where they were at.

262
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,230
She went and the guy was like,

263
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:53,570
yeah,

264
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:53,940
it's,

265
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,251
you know,

266
00:07:54,251 --> 00:07:55,630
there's a new heroin dealer in town,

267
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,210
a lot of junkies and homeless people.

268
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,640
We're going to be loitering
around here until we stopped that.

269
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,331
But he's like,

270
00:08:01,331 --> 00:08:01,811
I'm sorry.

271
00:08:01,811 --> 00:08:03,940
And I look and what both
my daughters are in the,

272
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:04,900
um,

273
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,910
in the doorway and they're
looking out and I'm like,

274
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,540
hey man,

275
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,180
I told the cops are good.

276
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,770
Do you mind if the girls come down for
like two seconds and just let them know

277
00:08:11,771 --> 00:08:13,060
that they'll be like,

278
00:08:13,061 --> 00:08:13,830
you're going to do,

279
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,830
there's nothing to worry about.

280
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,540
And he's like getting
all your girls gone down.

281
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,010
So Georgia highly come down and they'd
had lollipops and they put notes on it

282
00:08:21,011 --> 00:08:21,281
that said,

283
00:08:21,281 --> 00:08:22,240
you are our heroes.

284
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,730
And they gave him to the cops.

285
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,630
I'm me talking about a
heart breaking moment.

286
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,740
These costs were like,

287
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,843
ladies.

288
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,670
Well first of all we will be
circling this bark all night long.

289
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,750
Nothing's happened to his house.

290
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,130
We will keep an extra good.

291
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:34,720
I out in this house in Georgia,

292
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:35,680
starts pulling on my shirt.

293
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:35,951
She's like,

294
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:36,220
Dad,

295
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:36,971
let's go dad,

296
00:08:36,971 --> 00:08:37,804
let's go.

297
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,111
I was like,

298
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:38,591
hold on George,

299
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:39,310
he's not done.

300
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,731
He's just like,

301
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:40,120
Dad,

302
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,690
dad,

303
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,320
I think we can.

304
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,153
We should go to the house.

305
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:42,940
And I was like,

306
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,301
Georgia,

307
00:08:43,301 --> 00:08:47,080
it's fine by the guy gives a speech and
we walked back to the house and I was

308
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,130
wearing this shirt and she goes,

309
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,290
you are wearing a marijuana shirt.

310
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,313
Ah.

311
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,850
Was like,

312
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,750
oh,

313
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:54,800
that's hilarious.

314
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,120
Cops don't give a fuck.

315
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:56,990
No.
