1
00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:01,863
Hello

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:02,973
bitches,

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:03,641
you,

4
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:03,971
you,

5
00:00:03,971 --> 00:00:04,390
um,

6
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,390
we were talking about what I think we
say Kratom I think we can call Kratom and

7
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:10,450
um,

8
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,980
this is something that is in the news
right now because it's helped a lot of

9
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:19,981
people overcome opioid addiction and
they're about to make it schedule one

10
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,360
meaning that it has no
medical use whatsoever.

11
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,670
No highly addictive.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:27,970
You know,

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,781
medical use.

14
00:00:28,781 --> 00:00:29,740
We are going to take it right now,

15
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:31,420
like on this podcast right now.

16
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:33,220
It's legal to do and boy,

17
00:00:33,221 --> 00:00:34,810
they're going to get you
record right retroactive.

18
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,000
Come on.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,670
I know the statue of limitations
on the illegal drugs.

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,830
It takes like an hour to kick in.

21
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,670
And so,

22
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,560
and this is a very mild dose.

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,970
It is 1223,

24
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,021
one 23.

25
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:48,550
Emma started asking you weird questions.

26
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:49,990
I'm already on some,

27
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,531
oh,

28
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:53,140
you already handsome before you
just taking this shit all day long.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,601
Uh,

30
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:54,430
no.

31
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,030
Um,

32
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,900
let's take it in the more I do podcasts.

33
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,620
Well,

34
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:58,910
um,

35
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,470
I still have some pain management issues
from an injury and the injury cause

36
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:03,951
it's crazy.

37
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:04,784
It's crazy story.

38
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:05,510
Uh,

39
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,740
so I was,

40
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,120
this is a couple of years ago.

41
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,283
I,

42
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,580
I was in the best shape of my life
and I was rock climbing like three,

43
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:16,700
four times a week and doing
crossfit and all this.

44
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,534
And I was like,

45
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:18,140
I,

46
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,060
I've always been lanky
like this my whole life.

47
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,420
And I actually had muscles for the first
time in my life and just like felt like

48
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:24,220
superman.

49
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:24,710
And,

50
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,980
and I was supposed to be rock
climbing is on my birthday.

51
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,090
And,

52
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,690
um,

53
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:32,750
and there's some fires in Sedona where
the rock climbing was supposed to be.

54
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,584
And so,

55
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,640
so we went for a hike instead just to
see a little bit of Sedona as my first

56
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:38,474
time there.

57
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,190
And I was out with my friend,

58
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:40,760
um,

59
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,170
Mikey and he,

60
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,280
so he,

61
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,350
he was like this,

62
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,570
he was like three,

63
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:48,500
400 pounds,

64
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:50,330
I think he was like 400 pounds.

65
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,350
Um,

66
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,550
like his whole life,

67
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:54,770
he's been a hugely obese.

68
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,040
And then he went on this diet that he
just drank coffee with butter in it for

69
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,950
like 40 days.

70
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,521
That's it.

71
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:05,354
That's all he ate.

72
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,310
He cracked himself out.

73
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,260
And then he,

74
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:08,730
uh,

75
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,030
how much did he lose in 40 days?

76
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:11,360
So like a thousand pounds,

77
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,710
200 pounds.

78
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,140
He lost all of his weight.

79
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:17,660
And then he was like a normal person.

80
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,040
That sounds crazy.

81
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,620
I know it's 200 pounds in 40 days.

82
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,030
I don't know if it was that much.

83
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,350
It was significant.

84
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:26,660
It was like well over a hundred pounds.

85
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,690
And He,

86
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,500
um,

87
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,931
and then he,

88
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,950
so then he started doing like Jujitsu.

89
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,340
It started like becoming active for like
the first time in his life and was like

90
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,390
all excited about this.

91
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,320
And so he was like,

92
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:39,801
oh,

93
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:40,634
I have this,

94
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,590
there's this one shortcut
that I want to take.

95
00:02:42,591 --> 00:02:42,860
My,

96
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,870
my wife will never let me and so let's,

97
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,090
let's go and do that now.

98
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:50,780
And I liked that it let me take a shortcut
because it was too high of a jump.

99
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,470
And then I,

100
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:53,990
and we got to this and um,

101
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,150
and I looked and I was like,

102
00:02:56,151 --> 00:02:56,271
yeah,

103
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,104
that's too high.

104
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,400
And he was like,

105
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,790
so because he's been
so huge his whole life,

106
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:04,750
he has no idea of how high
you can jump from like this,

107
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:05,591
you know,

108
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:06,280
he's,

109
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,860
he's never been able to play before.

110
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,780
And I know,

111
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:12,250
cause I'm an adrenaline junkie.

112
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,210
I love heights.

113
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,270
I've been climbing trees and
jumping off shit my whole life.

114
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,040
And um,

115
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,480
and I was like,

116
00:03:19,481 --> 00:03:20,350
this is too high.

117
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:20,920
And he's like,

118
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,750
I think if we like climb down a little,

119
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:23,620
it would be okay on like,

120
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,454
I don't know,

121
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,930
I was wearing barefoot running shoes at
the time and then he was like determined

122
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:30,350
he was going to do it and high psych.

123
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,550
So it was jumping from a
cliff onto another cliff.

124
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And so if you couldn't roll and if you
landed it wrong and you rolled off,

125
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:41,220
it was like death,

126
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:41,950
death,

127
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,783
hundreds of feet.

128
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:43,823
And um,

129
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,090
and uh,

130
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,270
and so now I'm like,

131
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:50,950
I'm going to watch this guy roll off
this cliff because he's new to like

132
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:52,350
physical activity.

133
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,980
It doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

134
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,250
And he's about to jump off this thing
that's to lie on the other side.

135
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,000
He's been carrying around an extra
hundred plus pounds on his legs his whole

136
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:01,271
life.

137
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,380
His legs would probably strong as hell.

138
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:02,730
Yeah.

139
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,041
Yeah,

140
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,874
I imagine.

141
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,820
And it was weird because
he had like weird skin,

142
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:08,590
like hanging off everywhere.

143
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:12,100
It's tough from all from and
like stretch marks and stuff.

144
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,971
But he,

145
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:13,804
um,

146
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,890
so he was,

147
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,300
he was determined and I was like,

148
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,500
I was looking at it and I was like,

149
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,334
you know what?

150
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,990
I think that I could make it.

151
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,560
Oh,

152
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,430
and then I can,

153
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,200
I can like at least be there.

154
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,500
So he makes sure he doesn't roll
off this fucking cliff front of me.

155
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,220
God.

156
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,390
And um,

157
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,141
yeah.

158
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:29,561
I mean,

159
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:29,891
you know,

160
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:30,551
it's one of those things,

161
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:31,990
you feel like a fool in hindsight.

162
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,540
And I,

163
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,061
I was like,

164
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:34,431
you know,

165
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:34,630
I've,

166
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,280
I've jumped off stuff higher than this.

167
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:39,130
It's just that I'm wearing
bad shoes and I can't roll.

168
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,570
I'm going to have to take it with my feet.

169
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,651
And I even told them,

170
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:42,484
I was like,

171
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,840
I'm going to be risking breaking a heel
because I broke a heel once before when

172
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:47,740
I was like a teenager.

173
00:04:47,741 --> 00:04:48,820
I love jumping off shit.

174
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,690
Um,

175
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,280
and so,

176
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,650
but it wasn't like the end of the world.

177
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:54,011
I was like,

178
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:54,291
you know,

179
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:54,690
if that,

180
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,040
if I break a heel it won't,

181
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,230
I'll still be able to get around.

182
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,880
It's just like a couple month thing.

183
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:01,121
And I,

184
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,790
in my mind this is the worst
of what's going to happen.

185
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,570
And so I went for it and I,

186
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,170
and I jumped and I landed and um,

187
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,820
and then,

188
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,460
and I,

189
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,480
as soon as I landed,

190
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:15,430
I heard both of my heels break.

191
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:16,480
Um,

192
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,313
it just,

193
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,230
the sound shot through my
body and I heard it like,

194
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,400
it sounded like a branch,

195
00:05:21,401 --> 00:05:22,720
like snapping underwater.

196
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,183
And,

197
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:25,960
and I,

198
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,040
I was,

199
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,230
I think I was in shock or something
cause I just kind of turned and looked at

200
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:30,350
him.

201
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,731
I was like,

202
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,790
I just broke both my heels
and I said it just like that.

203
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,140
And so he thought I was like joking.

204
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:36,200
So he was just about to do,

205
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,491
I'm like,

206
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:36,641
no,

207
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:36,791
no,

208
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:37,240
no.

209
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,650
I really broke both my heels.

210
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,620
You're going to have to go
around and try to help me down.

211
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,720
And I started making my way down.

212
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,800
It took them like a half hour,

213
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:46,240
45 minutes to get to me.

214
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,140
And I had to kind of,

215
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,003
uh,

216
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,530
do you remember when you were
in school in gym class to be,

217
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:54,040
you have to do that crab walk thing
where like your bellies facing the air?

218
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,120
Um,

219
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,800
so I had my left foot just was,

220
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,400
was already like five times that
size within like 30 seconds.

221
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,800
And so I couldn't use that at all.

222
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,650
And then my,

223
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,483
my right foot,

224
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,320
it's just a,

225
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,560
I couldn't even tell if it was totally
broken and for if I just bruised it real

226
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:09,801
bad,

227
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,470
but I was able to use my toes thankfully.

228
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,670
And so I had to kind of
like a w one foot crab walk,

229
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,060
uh,

230
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,511
down.

231
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:21,260
And then he got around to me and was like,

232
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,180
a couple of people were trying
to help me for a little bit,

233
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:25,400
but it's too steep for anyone to help me.

234
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,880
So I just kinda had to make it down on
my own once we were at level ground,

235
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:30,290
which took like three hours,

236
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,330
um,

237
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,540
of just like,

238
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,530
it,

239
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,420
it was an exceptionally annoying,

240
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,313
uh,

241
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,250
Eh,

242
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,330
I mean it was painful.

243
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:38,560
I,

244
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,930
I'd scoot down for a little bit and
then I'd have to take a break for a few

245
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:42,763
minutes and just like,

246
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,750
and then just like roll around in
the fetal position and pain and,

247
00:06:47,751 --> 00:06:48,584
um,

248
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,870
and then,

249
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,853
um,

250
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,510
and he was like,

251
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,153
he was like,

252
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,840
so this was his dumb idea.

253
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:00,860
And on the way down he's just like
standing there like next to me waiting for

254
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,160
me,

255
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,940
like trying to lighten the mood
by telling me jokes and stuff.

256
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:05,301
I'm like,

257
00:07:05,301 --> 00:07:05,631
dude,

258
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:08,810
this is not the time for jokes.

259
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,580
I am fucking pissed right now.

260
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,900
And um,

261
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,321
I was like,

262
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:12,620
it's okay.

263
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,371
It's fine.

264
00:07:13,371 --> 00:07:14,240
It's going to be fine.

265
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,770
I just fucking need to focus and
get through this and got down,

266
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,030
went to the hospital.

267
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:20,990
I still,

268
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:25,970
I mean it hurt real bad and we had to
go to a second hospital because the one

269
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:26,721
was too full.

270
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:27,554
And,

271
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,970
and then,

272
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,110
I mean,

273
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,520
I thought it was bad,

274
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,640
but I thought I was like,

275
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:36,380
this is more than just a little break.

276
00:07:36,381 --> 00:07:37,160
This is like,

277
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,390
this is a pretty big break.

278
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,280
And another doctor came in and he's like,

279
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:40,820
this is,

280
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,160
this is really serious and uh,

281
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,240
and your,

282
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,830
your heels and like 20 pieces.

283
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,040
Jesus give him extra so I could freak out.

284
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,491
Yeah.

285
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:49,761
It's,

286
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:50,210
um,

287
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,280
it's actually the,

288
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,110
the,

289
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,430
I I made an album about
it called my belt break.

290
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,680
And that's ball,

291
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,640
that's the cover art as this the x ray of,

292
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,513
of my heel.

293
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,860
So what's these big just re post surgery?

294
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,450
It's got all the screws and plates in it.

295
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,021
Yeah.

296
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,560
Yeah.

297
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,100
Um,

298
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,670
I don't know.

299
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,830
I imagine I have the
originals around somewhere.

300
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,933
Um,

301
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,730
and I'm maybe somewhere
way back in my Facebook,

302
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:17,810
you could see some of the
scars and stuff like that.

303
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,710
It's real grill,

304
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,510
so I'm not sure if you'd
be able to find it or not.

305
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,823
Um,

306
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,491
but,

307
00:08:22,491 --> 00:08:22,731
uh,

308
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:23,061
so,

309
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:27,860
so they put these metal plates in it and
kind of screwed in the pieces of the,

310
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,380
the bigger pieces of the
bone that were still there,

311
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,170
like where they wanted
them to be eventually.

312
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:33,800
Cause it's,

313
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,970
you can't just put the bone,

314
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,780
it's like if you,

315
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,870
if you snap like a candy bar
and try to put it together,

316
00:08:38,871 --> 00:08:41,030
there's all these crumbs
and stuff like that missing.

317
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,930
And so they just kind of put it in
place where it was supposed to be and,

318
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:45,591
and,

319
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,130
um,

320
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,240
and they were like,

321
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:47,391
well,

322
00:08:47,391 --> 00:08:51,140
hopefully it just kinda grows
back and comes together.

323
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,040
Right.

324
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,581
And,

325
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:53,180
um,

326
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,740
and it did really,

327
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:57,930
the issue was so they,

328
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:58,764
um,

329
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
the way they did the surgery,

330
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:01,920
they told me I had a time,

331
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,640
ladies and gentlemen,

332
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,151
it's a first,

333
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:03,900
you see that?

334
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,430
What am I looking at right here?

335
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:05,851
Yeah.

336
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:06,570
What is that?

337
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,170
That's the,

338
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:09,000
from where they went in with the surgery.

339
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,570
Okay.

340
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,380
So,

341
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:10,950
um,

342
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,710
they,

343
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,110
they,

344
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,030
they said that they didn't want to do
the surgery at first cause they're like

345
00:09:15,031 --> 00:09:16,830
this is really complicated surgery,

346
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:18,120
but if we don't do it,

347
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,910
I don't think you're ever
going to walk right again.

348
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,340
And why did they not want to do it?

349
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,480
They weren't qualified to do it.

350
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,050
Is that the idea?

351
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:25,440
No,

352
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,550
this guy was like,

353
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,150
Eh,

354
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,050
this guy I got referrals and this
guy was like as good of theirs.

355
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,790
Theirs go further back than that.

356
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,380
There's some real disgusting stuff.

357
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:35,543
Um,

358
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,850
so um,

359
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,300
they just,

360
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,790
just the area that it's in and,

361
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,691
and so there's,

362
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:43,770
this is,

363
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,590
it's like a 90 degree angle
that they have to cut in,

364
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,760
in the corner of it.

365
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,930
Oh there we go.

366
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:50,730
That doesn't look good.

367
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,211
That,

368
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:52,230
and that was like,

369
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,510
that was like months and months later
too that this is a post surgery.

370
00:09:57,511 --> 00:10:00,890
This is like four months after the fact
that it looks like what it looked like.

371
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,733
Tissue.

372
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,551
Yeah,

373
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,690
a lot of scar tissue and stuff.

374
00:10:03,691 --> 00:10:06,750
So see where it's open there and
in that that corner ripped open.

375
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,170
They're like,

376
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,850
I hope this corner doesn't rip open cause
as sometimes happens with this surgery

377
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,901
and if it does,

378
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:14,970
you're going to be really
susceptible to infection.

379
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,250
And so I had,

380
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:18,030
I couldn't,

381
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:18,863
when I,

382
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:23,280
I at the time I lived in Malibu and my
place had like 50 steps and there's no

383
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:26,760
way I could like get up with groceries
and everything with two broken feet.

384
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,370
I could get around on
crutches a little bit.

385
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,181
But,

386
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:30,301
uh,

387
00:10:30,301 --> 00:10:34,830
I ended up having to spend like three
months in my parents' basement cause I

388
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:36,480
couldn't care for myself or anything.

389
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,480
So like on top of having to cancel
three months of work and not have,

390
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,780
you know,

391
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:47,220
we don't have a safety net and
having no income and you know,

392
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:47,750
it's,

393
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,240
it,

394
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,750
it was,

395
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,650
it was actually like,

396
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,410
I'm very grateful for my parents and,

397
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,110
but it's,

398
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:52,381
you know,

399
00:10:52,381 --> 00:10:54,220
it's just embarrassing and you're like,

400
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,640
I had to move him in my parents' basement.

401
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm sure they understand though.

402
00:10:58,081 --> 00:10:58,231
I mean,

403
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,520
it's not like you just,

404
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,480
you know,

405
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,400
we were a loser and
couldn't wake up on time,

406
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,590
lost your apartment.

407
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:05,400
You know,

408
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,050
this is just fuck man.

409
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,220
Got worst part of it,

410
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,960
come to start walking again.

411
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,290
So after three months I got
back on the road and um,

412
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,930
and there was still this,

413
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:20,400
this little kind of
wound that it opened up,

414
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,570
wasn't healing.

415
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,800
And then I started,

416
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,050
it was just taking the,

417
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,210
they told me it was going to take like
at least six months to like start walking

418
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,430
and it ended up taking much longer
than that because so about four or five

419
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:35,821
months in,

420
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:38,220
I got on the road and then um,

421
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,230
and then a,

422
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,940
a doctor thought that maybe I was getting
a like just a topical infection and

423
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:49,560
gave me some stuff that wasn't
good enough for the infection.

424
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,210
And then I started,

425
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,620
so about four or five months later I
started having fevers and then I went into

426
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:58,270
the hospital and then they're like,

427
00:11:58,271 --> 00:11:59,530
you have a bone infection.

428
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,460
And I was like,

429
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,750
Oh God.

430
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:05,650
Cause they are like this is really serious
because that's when you can lose your

431
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,341
foot and stuff.

432
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,840
If they can't stop the infection,

433
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:09,070
they just have to cut it off.

434
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,380
Oh Jesus came back,

435
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,371
canceled every,

436
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,570
all my work again.

437
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,220
Came back to La,

438
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,400
they did a surgery and um,

439
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,110
and I was really thankful that I had
happened to sign up for the health care.

440
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:25,840
This was right when the universal
health care just came out.

441
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,370
Otherwise I'd be bankrupt from it,

442
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,240
but it was still,

443
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,871
certainly,

444
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,210
it was not perfect at all.

445
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:31,420
Uh,

446
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,220
they wouldn't let me
do stuff out of state.

447
00:12:33,221 --> 00:12:35,650
I had to get myself
back to California and,

448
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,690
and uh,

449
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,900
what do you mean by stuff out of state?

450
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,780
You mean surgical procedure?

451
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,930
Surgery and hospital checkups.

452
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:41,764
I had to pay,

453
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,380
they had to do with me in California
because of your insurance?

454
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,831
Yeah.

455
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,150
And so when I was in Wisconsin,

456
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,740
I had to pay out of pocket for that and,

457
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,730
and it's like kind of not
supposed to be that way either.

458
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,230
But there was the,

459
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:53,951
I mean,

460
00:12:53,951 --> 00:12:54,340
I would,

461
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,630
I would call and try to,

462
00:12:55,631 --> 00:12:57,190
in the insurance company would be like,

463
00:12:57,191 --> 00:12:58,270
you need this one form.

464
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:58,691
Okay,

465
00:12:58,691 --> 00:12:59,530
I call this company.

466
00:12:59,531 --> 00:13:00,364
And they'd be like,

467
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,000
yeah,

468
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,620
only doctors can get that form.

469
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,360
And so I'd tell my
doctor and he'd be like,

470
00:13:04,361 --> 00:13:04,601
no,

471
00:13:04,601 --> 00:13:05,201
you can get that.

472
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,130
You have to go here.

473
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,810
And then it was like around and around.

474
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:11,680
Sometimes I'd have to like pretend I was
a doctor when I was on the phone with

475
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:14,140
people just to get this
fucking form that I need.

476
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,390
And so I paid out of pocket size,

477
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:16,650
like,

478
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:16,930
you know,

479
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:19,420
getting medical bills were piling up.

480
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,670
And so the second surgery,

481
00:13:21,671 --> 00:13:23,500
what they did was they just cut out,

482
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,000
they took out the hardware,

483
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,750
that's what,

484
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,920
that's what got infected.

485
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,090
And then they kind of,

486
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,213
um,

487
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,600
we're where the holes
were from the screws.

488
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:31,930
They,

489
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:36,760
they kind of drill those out a little
bit and then they just cut off it cut as

490
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,050
big of a hole as they possibly could
in my foot to suck out as much of the

491
00:13:41,051 --> 00:13:42,190
infection as possible.

492
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,760
And so I thought I was going
to be in a hospital for,

493
00:13:45,761 --> 00:13:47,320
and I still hadn't walked at this point.

494
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:48,730
And then I thought I
was going to be there,

495
00:13:48,731 --> 00:13:52,510
like you'll be in a hospital for
like a week and a half or so,

496
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,380
two weeks.

497
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,311
And I was like,

498
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:54,701
okay,

499
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,180
fine.

500
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,451
I like,

501
00:13:55,451 --> 00:13:56,110
I'm in,

502
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,310
I finally,

503
00:13:57,311 --> 00:13:58,990
someone's going to be
like taking care of me.

504
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:00,190
We're just going to get this done.

505
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,670
Right.

506
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,750
I have my computer,

507
00:14:01,751 --> 00:14:03,420
I was in good spirits and,

508
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,590
and getting a lot of work done and stuff.

509
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,030
And um,

510
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,100
and then like two days
later they were like,

511
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:13,270
your insurance is saying that they think
you're better and you need to go home

512
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,330
and now we need to show you
how to like care for yourself.

513
00:14:16,331 --> 00:14:19,300
So I had to train me on how to,

514
00:14:19,301 --> 00:14:23,110
I had to give Myself Ivy
antibiotics three times a day.

515
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,340
But yeah,

516
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:24,970
they had,

517
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,510
they,

518
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,343
they put,

519
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,420
they put lines in my arm and I had to
like make sure that their sanitary all the

520
00:14:31,421 --> 00:14:33,210
time and I'd have to get him in,

521
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:33,361
in,

522
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:34,194
hold on a second.

523
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,580
That's a complex medical procedure.

524
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:37,990
Giving yourself an ivy dude,

525
00:14:37,991 --> 00:14:39,040
I had to Google it.

526
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,700
I like fucking Google.

527
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,850
What's the name of your insurance company?

528
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,103
Um,

529
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,851
I don't know.

530
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:46,750
Do I have the,

531
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,570
that's insane.

532
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:50,320
Um,

533
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,153
the fact and try,

534
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,370
so that's the other thing is I have
like two different insurance companies.

535
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:59,120
So this is like health net and then
there's like this lake side and medical,

536
00:14:59,121 --> 00:14:59,954
which one?

537
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,040
And I can never know which one is like
the I call one and they'd be like,

538
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:04,281
no,

539
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:04,880
that's your,

540
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,720
your other company.

541
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:06,501
I call the other one.

542
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:07,380
No that's this kind of,

543
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,070
it was just a year of dealing with this.

544
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,590
So because of the fact
that this was so expensive,

545
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,450
they just decided to say fuck this guy.

546
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,820
Let's make him do all the
medical stuff himself.

547
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:17,181
Yeah.

548
00:15:17,181 --> 00:15:17,990
They were like,

549
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,040
have you ever heard of that before?

550
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,611
And they're like,

551
00:15:19,611 --> 00:15:20,840
well he's a young guy.

552
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,750
He seems like he's in
good spirits and healthy.

553
00:15:23,751 --> 00:15:24,980
Seems like a bright guy.

554
00:15:24,981 --> 00:15:26,660
Like he could take care of himself.

555
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,090
I think it was the logic behind it.

556
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:29,924
And so let's,

557
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,010
let's get them Outta here.

558
00:15:31,011 --> 00:15:31,844
Cause he's the clients.

559
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,260
What's that?

560
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,040
Could you fight it?

561
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,850
I tried.

562
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,361
I was like,

563
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:35,661
what?

564
00:15:35,661 --> 00:15:36,494
You're I,

565
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,790
I can't do this on my own.

566
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,470
When they showed me what I had to do,

567
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,760
it was so once I get the IBS hooked up
and I'd have to figure out how to like

568
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,980
get bubbles out of the
lines and stuff like that.

569
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:46,880
Like I was googling,

570
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:48,680
how do you get bubbles out of the lines?

571
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:50,600
And that's literally what I say.

572
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,160
Then I had to,

573
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,860
the first time they showed
me what I had to do,

574
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,510
I couldn't believe it.

575
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:57,111
They're like,

576
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,261
no,

577
00:15:57,261 --> 00:15:59,570
watch this because you're going
to have to do this yourself.

578
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,530
And then,

579
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:04,610
so this huge hole in my foot was packed
full of gauze and they started pulling

580
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:05,450
out this gauze.

581
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,580
I didn't know how big
the hole was at first,

582
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:10,280
but then it was like one
of those magic scarves,

583
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,300
like wound on calming.

584
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,070
Yeah.

585
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:13,620
And,

586
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,451
and then they're like,

587
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,330
so you're gonna need to take
this out and then look in here,

588
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,440
look in your hole.

589
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,340
You're going to need to clean it out
and like clean off your bone and stuff

590
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,773
every day.

591
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,613
See your bone.

592
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,291
Oh yeah.

593
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,160
I had to like scrub it off and then,

594
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,320
and then I had to pack it full of Shit
again and all of this with like wearing

595
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,490
gloves in a fee,

596
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,220
a a mask and everything like that.

597
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,473
And,

598
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,320
and then I,

599
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,870
and then I'd have to like
put a rubber thing on to,

600
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,400
to take a shower.

601
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:47,000
I had to do this three times a day and
then I couldn't sleep either because I

602
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:51,110
needed the IB antibiotics had to be every
eight hours and it took two hours to

603
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,944
do them.

604
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,270
And so I could never get
like a full eight hour rest.

605
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,710
So I was like mad it up.

606
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
It took two hours for the
IB fluids to go and okay.

607
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,100
Yeah.

608
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,933
So you have to do,

609
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,430
oh so I'd hang up these bags and stuff.

610
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,720
I'd hook up the IBS,

611
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,010
then I'd spend 20 minutes
with my foot hole and then,

612
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,080
and then after,

613
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,820
after like a few weeks of that,

614
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,890
see they would always be like okay
we can get you another home visit or

615
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:22,880
something like that.

616
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,420
It would be like a week
after I actually needed it.

617
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,673
Cause then I got,

618
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,330
I got this vacuum Suction Cup thing
that they put on my feet and um,

619
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:33,650
and they,

620
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:34,820
uh,

621
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,780
and it just kind of sucks all
the infection stuff out and,

622
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,703
and uh,

623
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:40,530
uh,

624
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,060
gets,

625
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,310
gets rid of it and closes up in,

626
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,010
creates like blood flow into that area.

627
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,860
So it generates the things
actually work amazingly.

628
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:49,740
But,

629
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,740
but so then I had this device and like
a vacuum and I started performing again.

630
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,991
I'd have to like take this vacuum off
myself and I close up my fucking foot hole

631
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:04,650
and then go on stage and perform and
then get off and put this back Hume back

632
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:05,011
on.

633
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:05,640
And,

634
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,473
and uh,

635
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,260
uh,

636
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,340
I remember,

637
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,560
cause I had before I,

638
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,120
before I,

639
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,043
um,

640
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,570
I went through a big breakup,

641
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,613
um,

642
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,260
before I broke my feet and when I,

643
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,840
and I had been in like 12
years of relationships.

644
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,710
And so I was like,

645
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,900
I'm not dating for a year.

646
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,890
I'm not going to have sex.

647
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:28,350
I'm not going to think
about women for a year.

648
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,880
I'm just going to get my head straight.

649
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,260
And I did that.

650
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,250
It was great.

651
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,360
Got Tons of work done.

652
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,090
And then,

653
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,300
then when I started
getting back into things,

654
00:18:36,301 --> 00:18:37,110
you broke a fee.

655
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,170
It was uh,

656
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:38,521
no,

657
00:18:38,521 --> 00:18:39,354
I had already,

658
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,130
I broke my feet during this time,

659
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:45,360
which helped when like QC spell have
a sex drive with both of your feet are

660
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,194
broken.

661
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,520
And um,

662
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,031
and then,

663
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:50,460
but when I started getting
back into it and I'm like,

664
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,020
I remember I brought a girl back back to
my hotel when I still had this fucking

665
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:55,854
vacuum,

666
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,730
uh,

667
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:59,100
on my foot and I was just like,

668
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,330
it was fucking awkward and I hadn't
had sex in like a year or two.

669
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,520
So I'm like trying to figure
out how to have sex again.

670
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,690
I got a fucking vacuum
attached to my foot hole.

671
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,110
Who is your health like,

672
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,651
I mean,

673
00:19:10,651 --> 00:19:12,480
what kind of like energy
levels did you have?

674
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,040
It would seem like if
you're going through,

675
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,130
your body's trying to repair itself for
such a long period of time it has to

676
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:17,701
wear on you,

677
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:18,090
right?

678
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:18,690
Yeah.

679
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,890
I mean,

680
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,640
it was,

681
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,490
it was more just the depression of it all.

682
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,720
And the stress was,

683
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,810
was harder than I was getting
plenty of sleep and stuff.

684
00:19:27,811 --> 00:19:28,441
But it was,

685
00:19:28,441 --> 00:19:29,640
it was a depressing time,

686
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:31,290
but ultimately it was kind of,

687
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,450
it was kind of good in a way,

688
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,373
um,

689
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,670
in building and some,

690
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:36,983
a little bit,

691
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:37,823
I mean,

692
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:38,220
I mean,

693
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,160
I got a good of,

694
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:40,200
um,

695
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,033
I,

696
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,120
so,

697
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,391
I mean,

698
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,380
when I started in,

699
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:45,360
in Boston and I started doing comedy,

700
00:19:45,361 --> 00:19:46,680
I was like fearless.

701
00:19:46,681 --> 00:19:48,390
I would do like the ballsiest stuff,

702
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,960
always trying new material and
I just did not give a shit.

703
00:19:51,961 --> 00:19:53,700
And I got a lot of attention for it.

704
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,220
And I caught some breaks early on.

705
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
And once I started making
money and doing the road,

706
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,360
it was like,

707
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,700
then you're worried about like getting
negative comment cards and all this shit.

708
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:07,170
And that's like my livelihood.

709
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,003
And it was,

710
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,000
it was just watering down what I was
doing and I wasn't fearless on stage

711
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:12,834
anymore.

712
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,703
Um,

713
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,370
Eh,

714
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,203
and,

715
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,990
and so after breaking my feet and having
three months of my parents' house,

716
00:20:18,991 --> 00:20:19,980
it kind of was just like,

717
00:20:19,981 --> 00:20:21,450
I don't give a fuck anymore.

718
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,670
I'm just doing exactly what I want to do.

719
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,803
And it was,

720
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,680
it was,

721
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:26,310
uh,

722
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:28,620
it really created a change in my career.

723
00:20:28,621 --> 00:20:32,520
I thought that album and like the new
act that I'm doing now or the best that

724
00:20:32,521 --> 00:20:33,330
I've ever been.

725
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,020
How long ago was the incident and the
accident and how long did it take you to

726
00:20:37,021 --> 00:20:37,854
recover?

727
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,610
Um,

728
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,360
so it was,

729
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,680
it was two years ago,

730
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,813
um,

731
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:42,683
in May.

732
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,100
And then I,

733
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,480
about one year in I started using
a cane and then that's when I,

734
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,300
that was really hard when I started
using a cane because I was like,

735
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:55,691
yes,

736
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:57,070
the light at the end of the tunnel.

737
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,090
And then I realized,

738
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:58,450
oh,

739
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,380
every other stuff that I
take for the rest of my life,

740
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,810
I think it's going to hurt
just every other step.

741
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,000
And so it's like always on.

742
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,910
That's why,

743
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:10,180
that's why I take kratom before podcasts
because there's always like a part of

744
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:12,160
my brain that can't stop talking.

745
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,340
That's can't stop thinking
about my stupid fucking foot.

746
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,330
Is it,

747
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,470
is it hurting you right now?

748
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,040
Um,

749
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:18,400
no.

750
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,330
Right now it feels fine,

751
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,320
but when you walk here,

752
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,363
um,

753
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,750
well the cardamom helps,

754
00:21:22,751 --> 00:21:23,710
but if I,

755
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:24,730
if I'm not on that,

756
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,390
most days it's just like
having a pretty sore foot.

757
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,400
And then some days,

758
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,980
like probably now it's,

759
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,620
it's coming along better than
I thought it would actually,

760
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:34,850
well,

761
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,740
three days out of a month I have like
this streak and I don't know what causes

762
00:21:38,741 --> 00:21:38,861
it.

763
00:21:38,861 --> 00:21:40,120
I don't know if it's inactivity,

764
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:40,571
the weather,

765
00:21:40,571 --> 00:21:41,350
whatever.

766
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,780
I have a streak of like
three days where I can just,

767
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,260
Eh,

768
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,000
where I should be using a cane again,

769
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,410
where if you saw me,

770
00:21:47,411 --> 00:21:47,801
you'd be like,

771
00:21:47,801 --> 00:21:48,850
what's wrong with that guy?

772
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,953
Years later.

773
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,470
Yeah.

774
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,160
Yeah.

775
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:51,760
Um,

776
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,031
yeah.

777
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:52,450
Oh,

778
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,090
about a year and a half
after I started using a cane,

779
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,710
so both eyes on a cane for
about six months and then
I started going without the

780
00:21:59,711 --> 00:22:01,570
cane and just using it sometimes.

781
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,100
And uh,

782
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:03,401
yeah,

783
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:04,660
so it's been quite an ordeal.

784
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,203
Okay.

785
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,893
Okay.

786
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:14,560
Yeah.
