Recording

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,100
gone like no.

3
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:04,820

Oh righty.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,460
Buck a lot.

11
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:19,851
Bitches.

12
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,560
Here we go out and girls in the house,

13
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,810
the Joe Rogan experience,

14
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,020
black gay man.

15
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,913
What the fuck?

16
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,980
[inaudible]

17
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,630
she's still not safe.

18
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,441
Black guy on me,

19
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:37,860
man.

20
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,693
That's not cool.

21
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,523
Ladies and Gentlemen,

22
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,290
the Godfather of the podcast is here.

23
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,970
The man has started at all the man who
without him I probably might not have

24
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:48,930
done this fucking thing.

25
00:00:48,931 --> 00:00:49,651
I might not have been,

26
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,100
uh,

27
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,600
so enthusiastic about doing it,

28
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,750
but doing his was so much
fun and he was so smart to,

29
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:57,720
to jump right into that right
after his radio station.

30
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,820
Adam Carolla ways and Joe,

31
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,120
great to be here.

32
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,020
Great to have you buddy.

33
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,101
It's real man.

34
00:01:02,101 --> 00:01:03,510
If it wasn't for you and you know,

35
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:06,090
and doing your podcast and
realizing how like you had it.

36
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:06,361
So,

37
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:06,750
I mean,

38
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,370
now you've got it really professional.

39
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,420
Like the last time I was there I was like,

40
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:09,961
Holy Shit.

41
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:12,630
He's like stacks of
compressors and all this,

42
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:12,961
you know,

43
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:15,600
and monitors and people hidden
video switches and everything.

44
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:15,781
I mean,

45
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,840
you've got it like a,

46
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,560
it's a goddamn studio.

47
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:18,900
You,

48
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,361
you know,

49
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:19,660
uh,

50
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,160
everyone is at that studio is still
making fun of me because Joe did that

51
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,530
podcast couple of weeks ago and uh,

52
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,270
Joe took a tour around the back part of
the warehouse and we're up at the front

53
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,410
part where the studio is.

54
00:01:32,411 --> 00:01:34,690
And then Joe came back and he said to me,

55
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,531
man,

56
00:01:35,531 --> 00:01:37,570
you got all these compressors.

57
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:38,200
And I said,

58
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,920
really?

59
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,720
You haven't seen shit yet buddy?

60
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,561
And I said,

61
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:42,251
follow me.

62
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:47,251
And we walked to a closet and I opened
it up and I turned that turn the light on

63
00:01:47,801 --> 00:01:50,410
and there was a 40 gallon
air compressor there.

64
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,160
And I said,

65
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,900
that's the granddaddy of them all.

66
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:53,734
And he went,

67
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,461
no,

68
00:01:54,461 --> 00:01:55,900
I didn't mean air compressors.

69
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,531
And I was like,

70
00:01:56,531 --> 00:01:59,020
what other kind of compressor
would you be talking about?

71
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,530
And then my,

72
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,190
my buddy started laughing at me.

73
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:03,900
And now,

74
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,160
uh,

75
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,440
I'm ridiculed soundly.

76
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,560
I stand by my compressor
means a compressor.

77
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,150
Well,

78
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,983
Jimmy,

79
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,780
you were correct and that is
the original use of compressor.

80
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:13,110
Yeah.

81
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,520
Especially considering that
you have an auto garage.

82
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,840
That's a rare situation.

83
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:18,130
Where was a good looking compressor?

84
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:19,900
I showed you can be sure.

85
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,200
Right?

86
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,651
Well listen,

87
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:20,891
I'm,

88
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,380
I'm as a into gadgets as
the next fella and I'm,

89
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm very impressed by
that large compressor.

90
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:25,481
I mean,

91
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:27,460
that was something you expect
to see at a gas station.

92
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,210
Thank you.

93
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:29,043
Very nice.

94
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,630
Even though now they charge
you a fucking quarter,

95
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,450
75 cents up to street or whatever.

96
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,313
I mean,

97
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,490
just the whole idea.

98
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,360
I would love to,

99
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:37,631
you know,

100
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:38,860
they do that stuff where they go,

101
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:43,140
if our founding fathers could
see this fuck founding fathers,

102
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,220
let me get a couple of
guys from the fifties yeah.

103
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,780
And just drag them in and go,

104
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,270
they make you pay for air.

105
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,250
I should black in their eye.

106
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,411
You know what I mean?

107
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:55,570
I mean like a guy of the
bow tie and it's like,

108
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,080
oh,

109
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,470
you know,

110
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,780
just just take a guy from
the 50s and show him a gas,

111
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,940
serve yourself,

112
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:01,690
uh,

113
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,370
you clean your own windshield,

114
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:03,971
uh,

115
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:05,620
you need to pay in advance.

116
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,431
That'd be another thing.

117
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,020
Like they don't trust you,

118
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,160
uh,

119
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,840
air they'll charge for,

120
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:12,790
for the option to pump my own gas.

121
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,260
It's one thing that creeps me out about,

122
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:14,831
about like,

123
00:03:14,831 --> 00:03:15,040
um,

124
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,550
I think Oregon has and I know New
Jersey has it or they don't let you,

125
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,380
they don't vet you pumped your gas.

126
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,250
Yeah.

127
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,960
For Real.

128
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,320
They don't allow you to,

129
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,610
that is a weird one,

130
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:25,061
isn't it?

131
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,900
Very strange.

132
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,291
I have,

133
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,710
uh,

134
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,100
I've,

135
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,030
I've done some,

136
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,511
some,

137
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:28,750
uh,

138
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,790
I don't know if we were
talking about this before,

139
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,191
but I,

140
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:34,000
I was thinking about
this sort of gas station.

141
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,680
Like I tell people,

142
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,371
you know,

143
00:03:36,371 --> 00:03:38,800
you can decide where to live.

144
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,020
A lot of people base that on like,

145
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:41,231
well,

146
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,630
how are the school systems or how well,

147
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:43,961
you know,

148
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:46,510
what's going on with the economy
or the roads or something.

149
00:03:46,511 --> 00:03:51,511
But I would say you can base
your neighborhood on the
gas station cause there's

150
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:53,770
sort of three levels.

151
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:59,070
There are the ones like the ones in my
neighborhood where you swipe your credit

152
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:04,081
card and then you have to punch in your
zip code because of credit card fraud.

153
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,170
Then there's the slightly
nicer neighborhood where
you just swipe your credit

154
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:13,171
card but you don't have to punch in your
zip code and then there's the greatest

155
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:17,740
neighborhoods of all where you just pump
your gas and when you're done you pay

156
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,150
somebody but you don't.

157
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,770
They don't need cash up front.

158
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:25,300
I mean that's when you travel and you
get outside of La and you realize,

159
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,510
oh there's just some guy's going to let
you pump your gas and then you can pay

160
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:31,030
him like not everyone's
fucking Bonnie and Clyde.

161
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,511
I was like,

162
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:35,590
all of us are going to jump off spray
sliding across our hoods laughing and

163
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,480
peeling out that is,

164
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:40,420
that means you're in a good God damn
neighborhood and they trust you.

165
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,650
That's absolutely true.

166
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,860
You know I got credit card fraud
fraud to do get to the other day.

167
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,783
Just a couple.

168
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,110
Just a week or so ago.

169
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,190
I'm super paranoid now.

170
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,180
I'm always at the gas station,

171
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,940
like trying to pull off the
standard and make sure it's real.

172
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,900
Know how they do it.

173
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,681
Those scanners,

174
00:04:53,681 --> 00:04:55,290
when you scan your card
at the gas station,

175
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
they put a scanner over that.

176
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,980
So as you're scanning it's getting there,

177
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:01,360
getting your numbers as well.

178
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:04,460
And they also have a little
camera that looks like like a,

179
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,550
a an advertisement for a credit card.

180
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,020
Uh,

181
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,710
the facade,

182
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,080
the application has a little camera
in here that reads you typing in your

183
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,914
number.

184
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,530
So as you type in your area
code or your Zip Code Zip code,

185
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:15,900
right.

186
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,910
You got to do that weird back hunch thing.

187
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,190
Yeah.

188
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,790
You gotta put your hand like
this street and food in prison.

189
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,550
I wonder if there's going to
be some sort of syndrome that,

190
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,473
um,

191
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,310
that doctors are going to run into and
chiropractors are going to run into

192
00:05:30,311 --> 00:05:35,311
called block ATM back where
like in the next hundred years,

193
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:39,010
our kids are going to have weird
Scully and spines from doing that weird

194
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:40,150
shoulder hunch.

195
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:40,811
Talk,

196
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:41,371
punching it.

197
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:41,801
It's really,

198
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:42,600
you get it from,

199
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:42,851
it's,

200
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,940
it's sorta what carpal tunnel tunnel list.

201
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:46,630
The guys who were keyboard jobs all day.

202
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:50,680
This is a weird back hunch to all the
people that go to the ATM three times a

203
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,820
week and dial in their zip code
when they're at the gas station.

204
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:58,550
Do the cell phone thing where they're
like texting is going to be a weird cause

205
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,080
it is this weird,

206
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,521
oh this is heavy.

207
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:03,140
This may be the weed talking but

208
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,710
we may be dig this,

209
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:07,610
just dig this.

210
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:12,611
We may be getting taller as a species
but we're evening it out by hunching over

211
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:17,960
all the time and rolling our shoulders
and protecting whatever cereal called

212
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,520
codes

213
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:18,920
punch in.

214
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,160
Yes.

215
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,360
It's weird to me that we still sign
things that freaks me out when I scribble

216
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,490
something on a piece of
paper and it makes it valid.

217
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,473
Right.

218
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,730
The really that real dumbest thing.

219
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,910
We've talked about the how like I just
type in Brad Pitt or Tom Selleck cause

220
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:36,110
that doesn't write it cause I used to be
kind of meticulous about my autograph,

221
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,300
you know and restart right.

222
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,180
My name out.

223
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,650
I should say my signature.

224
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,603
Right.

225
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,600
If I autograph something,

226
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,421
I'm much more in particular.

227
00:06:42,421 --> 00:06:44,000
Then if I signed
something I signs on that.

228
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,710
I'm just writing some fucking motion.

229
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,790
You can't tell me that's not right.

230
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:47,624
I'm changing it.

231
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,380
Mark and a,

232
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,110
you know,

233
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,470
you,

234
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,310
you do shows,

235
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:52,150
you stay afterward,

236
00:06:52,151 --> 00:06:53,320
you sign a bunch of Shit,

237
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,731
right?

238
00:06:53,731 --> 00:06:54,940
I'm sure.

239
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,180
Yeah,

240
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,311
yeah,

241
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:55,510
yeah,

242
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:55,661
yeah.

243
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:57,460
I do the same thing and it's just,

244
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:01,660
it becomes your mark and I
realized it doesn't have to read.

245
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,100
I always tell people this,

246
00:07:03,101 --> 00:07:04,420
like if people aren't,

247
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,150
if you are going to go out
and get a fake autograph,

248
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,430
it would be Brad Pitt's
Mata graft wouldn't be made.

249
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,000
But it,

250
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,200
so,

251
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,490
I mean,

252
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,540
who's going to question it?

253
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:13,650
Well,

254
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,750
I've seen fake ones of mine sold online.

255
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,440
We have,

256
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:16,930
yeah,

257
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,440
a bunch of them from newsradio
member autographed memorabilia.

258
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,550
There's a fake,

259
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:21,911
everyone,

260
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:22,750
everyone's name was fake.

261
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,410
I like those guys who once in
a while when you fly into JFK,

262
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:29,770
there'll be some fat guy in cargo
shorts who sweating profusely.

263
00:07:29,771 --> 00:07:30,521
He's waiting for you.

264
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:31,720
And he's like big fan,

265
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:32,200
big fan.

266
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,860
Big Fan.

267
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,340
As you saying,

268
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,731
big fan.

269
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:37,740
He's just keep swiping just 119
pictures of me as death on the fan.

270
00:07:37,741 --> 00:07:38,230
Like I said,

271
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,950
big fan,

272
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,783
big fan.

273
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,073
Really.

274
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:41,800
I mean,

275
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,110
it's a big part.

276
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:45,190
We definitely the 322 pounds.

277
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,090
Do you sign all those though?

278
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,710
I usually,

279
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,940
I'll tell you what happened.

280
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:53,650
I ran into the same dude on the
way out as I did on the way in,

281
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:56,080
and I signed about 20
of them on the way out.

282
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:00,610
And then when I was coming in at like
6:00 AM he was waiting for me again and I

283
00:08:00,611 --> 00:08:00,990
was like,

284
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:01,360
all right,

285
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,190
I'll give you a 10 this time.

286
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:03,840
That's nice you,

287
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,000
I,

288
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,720
you know my fee.

289
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,380
I don't,

290
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,071
I don't know why,

291
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:06,750
but I'm a,

292
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,530
I feel sorry for these guys.

293
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:08,830
Right?

294
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,360
I mean,

295
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:09,870
come on.

296
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,330
Yeah.

297
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,400
When's the last time
they got a good blow job,

298
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:13,653
number one.

299
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,860
Number two.

300
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,521
All right.

301
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,600
So that's their job.

302
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,610
Like they get up at five,

303
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,170
they drive down to JFK,

304
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:21,790
they pay 20 bucks for parking,

305
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:24,520
and they wait for Adam Carolla
to come walking up terminal.

306
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,840
Whatever I look at it is,

307
00:08:25,841 --> 00:08:26,674
fuck it.

308
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,543
It's their job.

309
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:27,911
Right.

310
00:08:27,911 --> 00:08:28,570
I don't really,

311
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,403
I don't give a shit.

312
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,700
How much money can you make off of
you make some pretty decent money.

313
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:34,440
I it definitely depends.

314
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:37,230
But like I think I saw your
ship going for like $25.

315
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:38,820
I know it was just some 25 bucks,

316
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:39,530
something like that.

317
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,340
I always suspect that just hope on the
off chance the plane will crash then

318
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:46,770
they'll have a stack of the
last shit you ever sign.

319
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,310
I don't,

320
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,460
I couldn't see him make it much,

321
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,680
much after that.

322
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,370
Yeah.

323
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,203
That could work.

324
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,433
Very Glover.

325
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,860
Yeah.

326
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,840
I used to actually do that.

327
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,410
Um,

328
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,130
like when

329
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,010
I was a kid I would like I,

330
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,380
it was a huge Steve Martin Fan,

331
00:08:58,381 --> 00:09:00,900
so I actually wanted his autograph.

332
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:03,300
So I would like always go to those uh,

333
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
movie shops where they have like the
signed autographs and like the minimum

334
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,390
memorabilia and stuff like
that and always looking for a,

335
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:10,500
Steve Martin never got one.

336
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:12,960
And then I found out that
he doesn't give autographs.

337
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:15,540
He gives out a little business
card and it just says,

338
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,570
this is business card says that you have
met Steve Martin or something like that

339
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,740
and just carries a pocket,

340
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,730
a pocket of them.

341
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,420
I like it when guys are clever but not
that clever that's bordering on cue.

342
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,160
I,

343
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:26,470
I,

344
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,470
one of the most uncomfortable moments
in my life was me sitting next to Kareem

345
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:33,550
Abdul Jabbar.

346
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:33,851
Actually,

347
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:38,350
I had to wildly uncomfortable moments
that involved Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

348
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,340
One is,

349
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:42,040
he just sat down on my
radio show and I was like,

350
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,233
you know,

351
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,980
you never see any,

352
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,800
any guys in their seventies that are,

353
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:48,101
you know,

354
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:48,851
over six,

355
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:49,990
seven or six,

356
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:50,410
eight.

357
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,230
And I,

358
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,320
I mean I,

359
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:52,720
you know,

360
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:52,830
I,

361
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,310
I'm not trying to bring you down,

362
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,391
you literally,

363
00:09:55,391 --> 00:09:59,680
but is there some syndrome or have you
talked to somebody or how does it work?

364
00:09:59,681 --> 00:10:02,620
Cause you just don't see seven
footers that are 80 years old,

365
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:05,890
but yet you seem like you're in perfect
health and I don't know how it works and

366
00:10:05,891 --> 00:10:07,450
if there's something
that I'm not aware of it.

367
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:08,140
And he's like,

368
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,040
what are you talking about?

369
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,353
And I was like,

370
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,680
you know how you don't see a lot
of old guys who like over six,

371
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:15,160
five,

372
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,420
they seem to go a little earlier in life.

373
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:17,891
So my fact,

374
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:19,180
the little short Jewish guys,

375
00:10:19,181 --> 00:10:20,380
the ones that go on forever,

376
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,770
is there some connection
correlation between the height
and the short longevity.

377
00:10:26,471 --> 00:10:27,304
And he was like,

378
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,690
I never thought about it.

379
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,500
And I was like,

380
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,670
Oh shit.

381
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,241
Really?

382
00:10:31,241 --> 00:10:31,930
And was like,

383
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,231
yeah,

384
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:35,110
now I am this kind of uncomfortable.

385
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,830
Like I was like,

386
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:36,491
but no,

387
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:39,070
but how do you bring this up?

388
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,750
So he,

389
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:40,961
uh,

390
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:45,340
he did that to me and then we're this
like dodger all star game or something,

391
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:49,480
celebrity game and we're sitting next to
each other waiting for the real dodger

392
00:10:49,481 --> 00:10:51,190
game to end in like the,

393
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,671
you know,

394
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:52,810
the timing of the Sorta,

395
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,490
you know,

396
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,580
dug out eating hot wings or something
like this up on the Lowe's level.

397
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,740
And some kid came by and said,

398
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,300
could you sign my baseball?

399
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,680
And I signed this baseball.

400
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,770
And then he handed it to Kareem
Abdul Jabbar and he said,

401
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,240
could you sign my baseball?

402
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:07,880
And he's like,

403
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,500
uh,

404
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,333
no.

405
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,180
And,

406
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,380
and the kid was like,

407
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,191
really?

408
00:11:12,191 --> 00:11:13,340
Cause it just take a second.

409
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:13,860
And he's like,

410
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,100
I,

411
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,650
I'm not,

412
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,730
I'm not doing that right now.

413
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:19,660
And I'm seeing like right next to him
and the kid comes back for a third like

414
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,081
round.

415
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:20,770
He's like,

416
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:21,101
you know,

417
00:11:21,101 --> 00:11:21,940
just real quick.

418
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,810
And he was like,

419
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,350
no,

420
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry.

421
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,370
Wow.

422
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:24,881
And I'm like,

423
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:25,840
just fucking sign it.

424
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:26,381
Just sign it.

425
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:31,381
And then he walks away and then his mom
shows up like 10 minutes later and she

426
00:11:32,351 --> 00:11:33,040
was like,

427
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,100
I'm so sorry to disturb you,

428
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,240
Mr Abdul Jabbar.

429
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,350
But um,

430
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,030
the ball for my son,

431
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:41,170
he's such a huge fan.

432
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,610
Do you think you could just take a moment?

433
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,443
It's like,

434
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,021
sorry.

435
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:44,854
No,

436
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,020
and she's like,

437
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:46,270
just,

438
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,170
just a moment and,

439
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,004
and she's like,

440
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,281
no,

441
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:49,030
thank you.

442
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,863
And I'm just like,

443
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:54,250
I'm sitting next to him wanting to crawl
out of my urethra and just go under the

444
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:54,821
carpet.

445
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:55,654
You know that thing,

446
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,740
having to pretend like,

447
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:57,220
you know,

448
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,590
that body language that
says I'm not listening.

449
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,510
Like we can all know
the fake body language.

450
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,530
I am listening,

451
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,630
but I'm trying to discover the,

452
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm not really listening.

453
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,520
You start leaning a little in God and she
really asked like three or four times.

454
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,370
He's like,

455
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,203
sorry.

456
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:13,961
No.

457
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:14,730
And she's like,

458
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:15,371
I'm really,

459
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:17,500
because we could have
signed it in this time.

460
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:17,860
It took,

461
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,460
no,

462
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,293
I'm sorry.

463
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,183
No,

464
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:20,810
she's like,

465
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:21,580
Holly,

466
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,050
I would've got all fucking sign it.

467
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:23,861
I'll eat your pussy.

468
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:24,694
Whatever.

469
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,890
Please go lay with tape.

470
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:30,250
Thank your son somewhere
and then it's fucked up.

471
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,270
Yeah,

472
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,103
I guess.

473
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,033
I mean,

474
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,003
no,

475
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,440
no,

476
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:35,651
no,

477
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,484
he's around.

478
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:37,000
No,

479
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,470
the point is the midpoint.

480
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,730
We'll Chamberlain's done.

481
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,390
Yeah,

482
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,200
we'll instead.

483
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:41,711
The point,

484
00:12:41,711 --> 00:12:42,544
the point is,

485
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,573
um,

486
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:44,290
he,

487
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,000
I realized the guy seven four,

488
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,470
there's not a place.

489
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:47,960
It's,

490
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,150
it's about height.

491
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:49,940
I mean,

492
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,380
your spotted your stop.

493
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,600
He gets stopped everywhere.

494
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:52,991
He goes.

495
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,160
I'm not defending the guy,

496
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,850
but that guy has probably
been bugged for autographs.

497
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,910
None stop for 50 years.

498
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,880
And I bet he's just fucking
head unimpacted asphalt of it.

499
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,321
Betty has.

500
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:08,260
But he should reconsider
the way that in that case,

501
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,580
especially little kids,

502
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:10,241
some kid,

503
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:11,410
and you can make their day,

504
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,790
it's so easy to make their day.

505
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,150
You're going to have to communicate with
them and he's right there and you're

506
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,530
sure it,

507
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,080
I'm listening to the choir talking to you.

508
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:18,941
You sure it was him,

509
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:19,181
right?

510
00:13:19,181 --> 00:13:20,920
It wasn't a guy who just looked like yes.

511
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,160
A six [inaudible] four black guy changed
his name from Lew Alcindor Doula.

512
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,110
Who was Lew Alcindor.

513
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,531
Yeah,

514
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:27,970
I was thinking like I was,

515
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,970
I was joking about this
once where I was saying,

516
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,200
you know,

517
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,700
Cat Stevens,

518
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,300
uh,

519
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,440
Cassius clay,

520
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,560
Lew Alcindor all really bitch and names
like no reason to take the muzzle.

521
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,923
It's true.

522
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Trickle should take the Muslim name
but not maybe even Dick Butkus but not

523
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,260
Cassius clay.

524
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,530
Like cat Steve's like
you guys already are.

525
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,030
We're blessed with some of the
coolest names on the planet.

526
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,511
You know,

527
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,650
much less pussy.

528
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:54,520
You're going to get cat.

529
00:13:54,521 --> 00:13:58,870
Steven's going to ease left
Muslim or whatever the fuck it is.

530
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:03,871
I mean that you're going to cut
the putsy spicket off imagining.

531
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,800
Imagine his agent.

532
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,460
How does that,

533
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,090
oh,

534
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,010
how'd the phone call go with his agent?

535
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,210
Hey Marty.

536
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:10,930
Yeah,

537
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:11,411
no,

538
00:14:11,411 --> 00:14:13,330
I'm not going by cat anymore.

539
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,193
That's uh,

540
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,510
that's my slave name now.

541
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,130
Non Cat Stevens now I'm going to,

542
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,630
now I'm going to be shelling my next
album is going to be the best of Yousef

543
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,463
Islam.

544
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:25,240
Cause agent must have just been like,

545
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,680
oh you fucking kidding me.

546
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,310
I was fascinated by his whole situation
is transformation up until I read the

547
00:14:30,311 --> 00:14:34,270
fact that he actually supported the
flat trois as it were or whatever.

548
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:36,580
Against the guy who rode 'em.

549
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:37,960
What the fuck is his name?

550
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,860
The Guy who wrote the book,

551
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,000
the one they went after him.

552
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:40,863
The first guy.

553
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,820
The Muslim guy.

554
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,400
Yeah.

555
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,600
Satanic Verses.

556
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,800
And uh,

557
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,840
that guy was named Gary Keller.

558
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,610
Well you should have gotten me,

559
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,920
I'll spit it out in a second.

560
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:51,861
Hold on.

561
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:55,490
So tannic versus just comes
out with Duncan Trussell.

562
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,170
It's so beautiful how you can do that.

563
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,243
Yeah,

564
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,061
yeah.

565
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:01,040
Well that's a problem and
rushed Salman Rushdie.

566
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,820
These guys are like all these guys there.

567
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,270
There's,

568
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,511
yeah,

569
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:09,740
there's the Cat Stevens version and then
there's the tea bag or version and it's

570
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,990
always like they,

571
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,270
they,

572
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,200
they explain,

573
00:15:12,201 --> 00:15:13,400
they're like general look,

574
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,360
it's about peace.

575
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:17,540
It's about a pilgrimage of
spirituality or whatever.

576
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:17,991
And you go like,

577
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:18,381
okay,

578
00:15:18,381 --> 00:15:19,070
I'm down,

579
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:19,761
I'm down,

580
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:20,390
I'm down.

581
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,560
And then then they,

582
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,360
then they always do something and you go,

583
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:23,841
all right,

584
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:24,470
now I get it.

585
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,140
You're an asshole.

586
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,990
He's fucking crazy.

587
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:26,360
I mean,

588
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,180
look,

589
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:29,070
Islam is a strange one to convert to.

590
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,170
It's like when Glenn Beck became a Mormon.

591
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah.

592
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,610
You know,

593
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:32,881
like,

594
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:33,391
wait a minute,

595
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:33,751
wait a minute,

596
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:34,100
wait a minute.

597
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,230
You're,

598
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,820
you're like a fucking grown man.

599
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,110
You're a grown man.

600
00:15:37,111 --> 00:15:38,160
He become a Mormon.

601
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,290
It's one thing if you're
like born a Mormon,

602
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:41,160
raised a Mormon.

603
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,570
I had a joke that I was doing in my act
where the reason why Mormons are so anti

604
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:48,180
gay marriage is because
they're afraid of gay people.

605
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:48,691
Rightly so.

606
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:50,430
Because if someone could
talk into being a Mormon,

607
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,310
they can probably talk
in a sock in her to,

608
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,460
as a matter of how much alone
time they spend with you.

609
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,130
What,

610
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:57,380
what?

611
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,770
Why don't you believe you pluck?

612
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,491
It is weird.

613
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:04,491
When people discover stuff at
age 37 I feel like my brain,

614
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:10,050
like the cement in the sidewalk and my
brain was dry to almost any other ideas

615
00:16:10,051 --> 00:16:10,771
at that point.

616
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,690
We could break that cement
open with some mushrooms.

617
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,710
Oh my God.

618
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:14,221
Oh,

619
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:14,850
I have,

620
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,990
I'm sure you have.

621
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,131
Oh,

622
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:18,540
I had this idea to though,

623
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,560
speaking of the gays,

624
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,150
you'll big this idea again.

625
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,650
This is more just stone talk,

626
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,430
but there's this race that's really fun.

627
00:16:29,431 --> 00:16:34,431
It's called the 24 hours of Lemons
and it's not 24 hours of Le Mall.

628
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,730
It's lemons.

629
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:40,731
You take a piece of shit car and you're
up against a bunch of other $500 cars

630
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:43,260
and it's a 24 hour race of piece of shit.

631
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,580
It sounds fun.

632
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,260
So someone says,

633
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:46,980
well,

634
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:51,060
how do you know that some guys not going
to spend 10 grand on a car putting like

635
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:52,950
a souped up engine in it and all that?

636
00:16:52,951 --> 00:16:53,280
How,

637
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,970
how,

638
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,970
how can you confirm that everyone here
hasn't spent more than $500 on their

639
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:01,554
entry?

640
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,693
It's tough.

641
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,990
And the guy said,

642
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,950
here's how we do it.

643
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,050
We have a giant,

644
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,560
uh,

645
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,550
like bulldozer,

646
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:09,810
just like a rock crusher,

647
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,290
just like a backhoe things.

648
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:12,123
She's a cruncher.

649
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,400
And we will go up and down the line
to everyone who enters the race,

650
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:18,234
every race.

651
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,740
And we'll pick one car and we'll put it
in the crunch here and that sends the

652
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:23,574
message.

653
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:27,690
Don't get slick because you look
too slick or we think you're,

654
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,150
you don't want to be the
nicest car at that thing.

655
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,190
You don't want to spend 10 grand
because they'll crunch you.

656
00:17:32,191 --> 00:17:35,220
And then I thought this is how
they should do the gay games,

657
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,383
because I thought,

658
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,820
how do you know everyone
in this game is gay?

659
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:43,220
Maybe there's some straight guy
who wants to just gave ash legal,

660
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,720
so,

661
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,280
so how do they know?

662
00:17:47,281 --> 00:17:50,490
Like Brock Lesnar when
enter boxing competition

663
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:50,641
go,

664
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:50,850
yeah,

665
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:54,690
Chicago bears beat the shit
out of a bunch of gay guys,

666
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,190
so be the greatest.

667
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,880
I said they should do it the same
way they do the 24 hours and lemons.

668
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:03,540
It's just they line up all the guys for
the gay games and one guy just walks in

669
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,021
front of them.

670
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:06,600
It stops in front of one
dune goes suck my cock.

671
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,740
That would keep this
one straight dude away.

672
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,630
Just the 1% chance.

673
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,300
Maybe there'd be a few dudes at risk.

674
00:18:15,301 --> 00:18:16,134
It

675
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,660
just fucking sweat out shows,

676
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:19,051
right?

677
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:19,920
Lottery goes right?

678
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,200
They've got an emergency
ecstasy in your pocket.

679
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:22,690
No,

680
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:22,890
no.

681
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:23,310
When the guy,

682
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,143
yeah,

683
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,490
he probably would do it too.

684
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,490
No,

685
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,560
because then you'd read about cognitive.

686
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:29,290
You realize people are going,

687
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,080
see this,

688
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,440
this is going to make it on youtube.

689
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,340
Yeah.

690
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,031
1980.

691
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:33,840
You could pull that off.

692
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,860
What was your first car?

693
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,700
I thought you were gonna say cock,

694
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,600
but it was your first car.

695
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,500
My first car was a Mazda pickup truck.

696
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,550
Got 79 Mazda long bed with a,

697
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:46,683
it didn't have,

698
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,250
you used to have a bench seat in it,

699
00:18:48,251 --> 00:18:52,060
but someone took out the bench
seat and put dinette seats in it.

700
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:54,040
So it was like theoretically bucket seats,

701
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,780
but they came from someone's living room.

702
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,920
So it wasn't,

703
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,790
it wasn't awesome.

704
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,270
How'd you get,

705
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,090
I like wrapped up in loving cars.

706
00:19:01,091 --> 00:19:01,511
Did you,

707
00:19:01,511 --> 00:19:02,344
uh,

708
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,180
hanging out with Jay Leno too much or,

709
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:06,040
I was deprived,

710
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,490
uh,

711
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,260
early on of all things mechanical
and I had a ranching gene.

712
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,360
So,

713
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,820
uh,

714
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,080
the wrenching gene,

715
00:19:14,081 --> 00:19:15,010
the wrench or gene,

716
00:19:15,011 --> 00:19:16,180
that mechanical gene,

717
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,750
it's no different than the musical one.

718
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:20,651
You know,

719
00:19:20,651 --> 00:19:21,370
you always,

720
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,860
whenever they say they
talk about a drummer,

721
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,191
look,

722
00:19:24,191 --> 00:19:24,581
oh,

723
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:28,750
Tommy Lee was banging on pots and pans
and the in the kitchen when he was three.

724
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,830
So he eventually broke down and got him
a drum kit and he's never left it since,

725
00:19:32,831 --> 00:19:33,370
you know,

726
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,650
so whatever he had that gene,

727
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,710
you know,

728
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,580
and some people haven't musical gene and
some people have it for math and some

729
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:43,030
people have it for conversation or
socializing or whatever science,

730
00:19:43,031 --> 00:19:43,780
whatever.

731
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,250
There is a mechanical gene.

732
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:50,251
And if you have it and let somebody
gets you that equivalent of a drum kit,

733
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,940
you'll just fucking go nuts.

734
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,361
And,

735
00:19:52,361 --> 00:19:52,720
uh,

736
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,590
I always lived in the valley and had
shitty parents with no money and lived in

737
00:19:56,591 --> 00:19:57,401
crappy apartments.

738
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:59,770
So I was just going nuts.

739
00:19:59,771 --> 00:20:03,700
I would go to other kid's houses and use
their garages and use their tools and I

740
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:04,990
never had a garage.

741
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,360
So when I got older,

742
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,890
I then went nuts with it,

743
00:20:08,891 --> 00:20:10,660
but I realized I didn't have any money,

744
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,900
so I had to sort of shut that part of
my brain off sorta like being really,

745
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,140
really into like,

746
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:17,590
you know,

747
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:17,950
uh,

748
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,371
high,

749
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:19,660
high end strippers,

750
00:20:19,661 --> 00:20:20,930
but working at an Rv.

751
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,211
So,

752
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:21,521
you know,

753
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,840
like he has certain point,

754
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:24,160
you go just go home and beat off,

755
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,710
like stop banging your
head against the wall here.

756
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:27,580
It ain't gonna happen.

757
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,440
So I'm working as a carpenter.

758
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,490
I don't have any money,

759
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,290
so I have to drive a pickup truck.

760
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:32,880
So I'm like,

761
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,011
ah,

762
00:20:33,011 --> 00:20:33,844
just screw it.

763
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,600
And then a certain point I made
money and then once I made money,

764
00:20:37,601 --> 00:20:38,290
I said,

765
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,730
it's time to overcompensate.

766
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,990
And that's where I'm at now.

767
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,550
And you have an addiction,

768
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:42,930
is it?

769
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,350
I think I'd say it is.

770
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:44,861
I mean,

771
00:20:44,861 --> 00:20:45,760
in the sense it's,

772
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,190
I think about it more than
think about other things.

773
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:50,380
You were going to do the
American version of top gear,

774
00:20:50,381 --> 00:20:50,860
right?

775
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:50,981
Yeah,

776
00:20:50,981 --> 00:20:51,670
I did apply.

777
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,503
I did the pilot.

778
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,633
And what happened?

779
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:54,970
Uh,

780
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,110
what happened is,

781
00:20:56,111 --> 00:20:56,944
uh,

782
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,970
about the worst sort of combination
that can happen when you're trying to,

783
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:01,870
uh,

784
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,070
be gainfully employed.

785
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,240
Um,

786
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,760
did the top gear pilot
with all the British guys.

787
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,250
I was sort of the lead
guy came out really,

788
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,113
really good,

789
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:10,871
really strong.

790
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:15,790
Everyone I could tell it was good
because all the hardcore blogger guys or

791
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:18,670
really deep into this world,

792
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,290
the top gear world,

793
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,980
they're international and they're just
a bunch of bunch of car tech nerd guys

794
00:21:23,981 --> 00:21:25,720
who love to get on the computer and say,

795
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,950
Talk Shit about,

796
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,590
you know,

797
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:27,930
not,

798
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,850
not the,

799
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,150
they'd love to say not as
good as the one in the UK,

800
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,130
but they all showed up at the taping.

801
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,140
It did secret taping somewhere.

802
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:35,281
Some,

803
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:39,070
it was like 700 people showed up and
they all got back to the computers and

804
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:39,280
went,

805
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:39,461
oh,

806
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:41,830
it's every bit as good as the UK one.

807
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:42,490
Uh,

808
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:47,490
it was for NBC and it was right at the
time that a GM and Chrysler and a w two

809
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:53,530
of the big three I may
was Chrysler and GM.

810
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,520
Uh,

811
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,240
we're heading to Congress trying to get
money from Congress to stay afloat and

812
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:01,630
they're making a big deal about them
taking private jets to ask Congress for

813
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,440
money.

814
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,251
And the show,

815
00:22:03,251 --> 00:22:04,750
Knight Rider Point,

816
00:22:04,751 --> 00:22:07,960
0.2 0.0 was tanking completely,

817
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:09,700
and the writings on NBC,

818
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:10,534
so they're like,

819
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:11,763
no car,

820
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,200
no car talk and no car shows.

821
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:15,190
And they shelved it.

822
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,410
How fucking stupid.

823
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:19,300
Then I got another Sitcom,

824
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,430
a development deal with NBC.

825
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,710
And right at the time that happened,

826
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,220
it got picked up by the
history channel or discovery,

827
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:27,911
whatever it's on.

828
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,410
It got picked up for 13 episodes.

829
00:22:29,411 --> 00:22:30,080
So they called me.

830
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,341
They're like,

831
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:30,521
Oh,

832
00:22:30,521 --> 00:22:30,941
good news.

833
00:22:30,941 --> 00:22:31,751
We got picked up.

834
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,584
And then I'm like,

835
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,010
no,

836
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,620
I'm actually doing another pilot for NBC.

837
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,590
That's a sitcom,

838
00:22:36,591 --> 00:22:37,630
so I can't do it.

839
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,940
So they went ahead and did that.

840
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,520
And guess who Sitcom pilot
didn't get picked up?

841
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:43,511
So,

842
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:43,780
oh,

843
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,613
for two,

844
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,091
essentially.

845
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:49,210
So it's like you couldn't
fuck it up anymore than that.

846
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,511
See,

847
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:52,990
that's one of the beautiful things about
the podcast is that it's so difficult

848
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:54,760
to fucking develop a show.

849
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:55,840
It's so difficult.

850
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,250
I've tried developing sitcoms.

851
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,900
I'm a development deals event,

852
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,360
you know,

853
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,030
I've been from the ground floor,

854
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,700
I've been brought in during
pilots to try to make it better.

855
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,320
It's fucking just,

856
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,610
there's so many people involved in so
many opinions and producers and network

857
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,100
executives and it's so difficult.

858
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,730
One of the beautiful things about
the podcast is there's no one,

859
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,421
I mean for you,

860
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:19,420
you have a few people that you've hired
that figured out your audio stuff and

861
00:23:19,421 --> 00:23:20,201
your video stuff,

862
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,630
but there's no one to tell you anything.

863
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,673
It's just you.

864
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,520
Yeah,

865
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,001
I know.

866
00:23:25,001 --> 00:23:25,834
Beautiful.

867
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,160
Well thing like this.

868
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,800
It is.

869
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,620
It at least it is the
vision of the artists.

870
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,930
A handset,

871
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,460
as I've always said,

872
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,870
what piece of art,

873
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,150
whether it was a painting or symphony,

874
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:43,380
got better be because 14
people try to cluster fuck it.

875
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:43,950
You know?

876
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:44,850
And by the way,

877
00:23:44,851 --> 00:23:47,600
whether talking about NBC or CBS,

878
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,870
five post-menopausal broads who never
made a human being laugh in their life,

879
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:55,100
get involved creatively.

880
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,670
I mean,

881
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,210
can you,

882
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,370
what goes on during the height?

883
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,450
I mean most of the executives in,

884
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:01,550
in the world of,

885
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:01,681
and,

886
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:02,514
and listen,

887
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,630
I'm not speaking as a bidder,

888
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,340
whoever they paid me my money,

889
00:24:07,341 --> 00:24:08,121
I did my thing.

890
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:08,690
I have no,

891
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,050
nope,

892
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,340
no qualms with them.

893
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,540
And I'm not coming from an angle of,

894
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:14,961
Oh man,

895
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:18,050
I'd love to kiss their ass and get another
bite of the apple and the not coming

896
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:19,100
from an angle of,

897
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:19,520
um,

898
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:19,800
uh,

899
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,780
bitter jilted Sitcom pilot star
that didn't get on the air.

900
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,240
I'm just coming from
the angle of the truth.

901
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:31,280
And these people are not funny now at all.

902
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,150
Not at all.

903
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,250
Now the thing is is that's okay.

904
00:24:34,251 --> 00:24:35,660
Most people aren't funny.

905
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,200
That's don't try to direct fund,

906
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:38,390
but,

907
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,000
but my mom doesn't tell me what set to do,

908
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:41,601
but you know,

909
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:46,601
before I go out on stage and so not
being funny and being heavily Merced in

910
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:50,360
comedy and funny and explaining
to people how to be funny,

911
00:24:50,361 --> 00:24:53,240
what is funny is not going
to create a better product.

912
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:54,980
And my fantasy and,

913
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,880
and most of these,

914
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,200
a lot of them are women.

915
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,640
A lot of them are dudes who don't talk
and even have a little bit of a sour dour

916
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:06,670
look to themselves when they go back to
their high school reunion in the in like

917
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,690
Michigan or wherever they're from
and they say to their buddies,

918
00:25:10,691 --> 00:25:13,100
so they haven't seen in 30 years what?

919
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,240
Where are you up to?

920
00:25:14,241 --> 00:25:15,800
What will you live in in California?

921
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:16,491
What's going on?

922
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:17,630
What are you doing for a living?

923
00:25:17,631 --> 00:25:18,440
And they go,

924
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm the head of comedy programming on NBC,

925
00:25:21,801 --> 00:25:25,760
or I'm the head of comedy
programming on a major network.

926
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:31,130
The people that went to high school
with Muscow kicked the fuck out of here.

927
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,440
You've never said a fucking
funny thing in your life.

928
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,760
Are you nuts?

929
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:35,863
You've never,

930
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,320
I never heard you fucking say thing
that made another human being smile.

931
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,741
What'd you do?

932
00:25:39,741 --> 00:25:40,970
Stand up all through college.

933
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:45,971
I can you imagine how fucking confusing
it would be because to a lay person and

934
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,070
remember when you were a lay person,

935
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,180
you thought,

936
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:50,421
well,

937
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,700
if somebody is the head of comedy,

938
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,720
whatever,

939
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,780
this dude must be the
funniest cat in the land.

940
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:57,530
Right?

941
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,580
I must know funny,

942
00:25:58,581 --> 00:25:59,600
at least at least.

943
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:03,640
And he's going to be student fat
guy named Marty and his officers,

944
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:05,960
Groucho Marx photos from the
[inaudible] going to love it.

945
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,711
Gotta love it.

946
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:10,490
He's going to be able to
do a bill Cosby bits and,

947
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,390
and uh,

948
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,620
and uh,

949
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:12,801
you know,

950
00:26:12,801 --> 00:26:17,470
Bob hope bits in everybody's bit just for
Beetham just back to you like a savant

951
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,910
and said instead of
looking at you and going,

952
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,680
I never heard of Mr Show.

953
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:23,280
Is that one guy or is that,

954
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,380
I've said that to you.

955
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:26,450
I uh,

956
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,070
I pitched,

957
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,040
I pitched a,

958
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,251
well,

959
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:31,820
first off,

960
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,880
sometimes you're talking to like 29 year
old chicks who fucking haven't heard of

961
00:26:35,881 --> 00:26:36,350
all of,

962
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,183
all in the family.

963
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,401
Yeah.

964
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:37,591
With,

965
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:40,020
with a clipboard and a confused
look on their face and you're like,

966
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,000
right,

967
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,010
I'm selling something to,

968
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:42,560
for real.

969
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,393
Ah,

970
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,280
it is just,

971
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,181
again,

972
00:26:45,181 --> 00:26:47,280
it's the death of all art,

973
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:50,970
which is a bunch of
opinions that that's it.

974
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,331
I mean,

975
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:56,331
even if even if someone's stood next to
Michelangelo and had a decent opinion,

976
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,070
it still would have fucked
it up to some degree.

977
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:00,870
Even a helpful opinion.

978
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:01,141
Well,

979
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:05,820
especially comedy because comedy
is all about one unique opinion.

980
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,130
It's all about one person's point of view.

981
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:12,060
When you start getting a bunch of other
people intersecting their points of view

982
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:13,230
into your point of view,

983
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,760
then it's not yours anymore.

984
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,280
Then it becomes some way,

985
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,090
like what makes someone funny?

986
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:19,650
Like talking about top gear,

987
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,120
like Jeremy Clarkson's my favorite,

988
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:21,954
I love that guy.

989
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,063
And uh,

990
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,300
his point of view is always
crass and slightly afraid.

991
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,920
It's uniquely his,

992
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:30,360
whether he has writers are not,

993
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:30,840
you know,

994
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,673
hey does he,

995
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,790
I'm sure I may not be a dick,

996
00:27:32,791 --> 00:27:33,720
but I met him,

997
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:35,850
he came out when I did
the podcast and he was,

998
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,450
I'm sorry,

999
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,450
did the car never thinks of podcasts now
when I did top gear and he came was the

1000
00:27:41,561 --> 00:27:45,660
nicest guy in the world and I was just
improvising up a storm and he came here,

1001
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,990
came right up to him and he said,

1002
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,820
I could not do what you do.

1003
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,500
I do not do that.

1004
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,340
And I said,

1005
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:51,521
oh,

1006
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:52,480
thanks for the compliment.

1007
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:52,900
And he said,

1008
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,141
no,

1009
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:53,800
I mean it,

1010
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,270
I have my stuff figured out.

1011
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,580
I don't know if he has writers.

1012
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,851
Well,

1013
00:27:56,851 --> 00:27:57,241
he writes,

1014
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,074
he

1015
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:03,570
figures his stuff out and then
does it in such a matter of fact,

1016
00:28:03,571 --> 00:28:05,970
sort of way that it feels so organic.

1017
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,200
It doesn't necessarily,

1018
00:28:07,201 --> 00:28:09,000
to me it feels like it's well written,

1019
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,500
but it feels like it's his,

1020
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:11,334
you know what I mean?

1021
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:11,730
Well,

1022
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:14,370
coming from your trained eye and ear,

1023
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,320
but I'll vet to the average bloke.

1024
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,380
It feels very off the cuff really,

1025
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,351
man.

1026
00:28:19,351 --> 00:28:19,980
I Dunno,

1027
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,910
it doesn't seem off the cuff.

1028
00:28:20,911 --> 00:28:21,360
It all in me.

1029
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,710
We'll see.

1030
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:26,710
Because when he's driving and he's having
this visceral experience and he starts

1031
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,810
into sliding in a corner and he yells,

1032
00:28:30,811 --> 00:28:31,440
you know,

1033
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,660
this thing smoother
than the Queen Mother's,

1034
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,081
you know,

1035
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:37,620
rear end feels like he's
having this experience,

1036
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:38,454
you know?

1037
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,293
Right.

1038
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:41,160
That's why it feels like it to me.

1039
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:41,580
And I'm,

1040
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,840
I'm sure it's all canned,

1041
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:43,980
but you know,

1042
00:28:43,981 --> 00:28:44,310
he's,

1043
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,890
there's no teleprompter and
it feels like this again,

1044
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,581
this experience,

1045
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:49,530
it's transcending just the voice.

1046
00:28:49,531 --> 00:28:50,700
You can tell the doc,

1047
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:52,320
I really fucking loves cars.

1048
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,160
There's a,

1049
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,350
when he reviewed the corvette Zr one,

1050
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:55,861
and,

1051
00:28:55,861 --> 00:28:56,011
uh,

1052
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:59,820
he's a sliding sideways down
this road and he's screaming,

1053
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:04,970
well done fat man from Kentucky
and this is a masterpiece.

1054
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,850
It's sideways blowing
smoke out of the tire,

1055
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:12,510
stomp on that 648 horsepower engine.

1056
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:13,440
You're hearing the roar.

1057
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,590
You could tell that guys really loving it

1058
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,890
in one of those that I think was a,

1059
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,100
a Callaway or something and you know,

1060
00:29:20,101 --> 00:29:23,850
had the turbo on it and probably
at 900 horsepower when I met him,

1061
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:24,690
uh,

1062
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,171
down at,

1063
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:25,470
uh,

1064
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:26,460
like El Toro,

1065
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,230
he just comes burning out.

1066
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:29,641
I mean,

1067
00:29:29,641 --> 00:29:29,821
yeah,

1068
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:30,061
I mean,

1069
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,340
not on camera or anything.

1070
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,370
I was yelling at Steve Coogan,

1071
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,400
who's English comedian who was criticized,

1072
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,330
uh,

1073
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:39,640
Jeremy Clarkson said
something about Mexico.

1074
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:42,100
So that the reason why I'm
Mexico doesn't have good

1075
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,580
people in the Olympics is because
all of their people who can run,

1076
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:46,001
swim,

1077
00:29:46,001 --> 00:29:47,860
or jump have already
gotten over the fence,

1078
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,640
you know?

1079
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:48,971
And,

1080
00:29:48,971 --> 00:29:49,750
um,

1081
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,770
people were shitting on him calling.

1082
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,600
Apparently Steve Coogan was just joking.

1083
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,930
Apparently he's like a joker and
their friends or something like that.

1084
00:29:55,931 --> 00:29:56,410
So,

1085
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,040
sorry,

1086
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,873
Mr Cogan.

1087
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:58,780
Oh,

1088
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,613
he wasn't really,

1089
00:29:59,710 --> 00:29:59,891
yeah,

1090
00:29:59,891 --> 00:30:00,800
it wasn't really shitting.

1091
00:30:00,801 --> 00:30:01,240
And he was like,

1092
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,440
I guess it was his sense of humor.

1093
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:07,441
I just missed the comedians
are making jokes is that,

1094
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,140
you know,

1095
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,240
in,

1096
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,370
in terms of society,

1097
00:30:09,371 --> 00:30:14,140
in terms of fixing the ills of society
and looking for someone to point a finger

1098
00:30:14,141 --> 00:30:18,670
at and create some sort of social change
comedians telling jokes and has this,

1099
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:20,620
why is it the top of everyone's list?

1100
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:22,960
I mean a news caster,

1101
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:23,291
you know,

1102
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:26,280
politician clergymen there,

1103
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:26,580
there's,

1104
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:26,950
there's,

1105
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,060
there's enough to the bankers,

1106
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,410
chief of police.

1107
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,600
When those guys make an off color remark,

1108
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:32,410
uh,

1109
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,060
then maybe you should
say something about it.

1110
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,300
But when a comedian said something in him,

1111
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,090
don't you already know
inherently by his title,

1112
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,020
right.

1113
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:41,800
That it's a job.

1114
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:46,690
I was having this exact conversation last
night with Daniel tosh about comedians

1115
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,460
going after comedians cause you know,

1116
00:30:48,461 --> 00:30:50,830
Coogan going after Jeremy Clarkson and he,

1117
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:54,040
we were talking about David Cross
going after Larry the cable guy,

1118
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,560
which was one of the
most confusing things.

1119
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,740
I liked David Cross and I
like Larry the cable guy.

1120
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:00,461
I think Larry,

1121
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:01,600
the cable guy is funny.

1122
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,230
He's,

1123
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,670
is he the greatest comic in the world?

1124
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:05,560
Well that's up to you
for some people he is,

1125
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,730
he's a good joke writer.

1126
00:31:06,731 --> 00:31:07,241
He's a good,

1127
00:31:07,241 --> 00:31:07,660
he's,

1128
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,860
he's got a good character.

1129
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:09,790
I think it's good.

1130
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,810
There's nothing wrong with it.

1131
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,100
I absolutely not.

1132
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:12,611
And I,

1133
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:16,630
I would never go after one of those guys
cause it always just seems like sour

1134
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:17,050
grapes.

1135
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,883
It's like all right,

1136
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:23,100
you're not selling out exactly ultra
domes and thus you're pissed off about it.

1137
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,890
And this is what I got accused
of when we were attacking men,

1138
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:27,910
you know?

1139
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:28,361
But I'm just like,

1140
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:28,841
look man,

1141
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:29,150
there's,

1142
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,920
there's a lot greater than him that is
way more successful and I'm not going

1143
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:33,640
after them.

1144
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,091
Like it's,

1145
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:35,560
it's not a sour grapes issue.

1146
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:35,740
It's a,

1147
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,710
it's an artistic issue
when you go after someone,

1148
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,271
when you go out,

1149
00:31:39,271 --> 00:31:40,540
you're someone who's doing something.

1150
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:40,930
You don't,

1151
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:41,800
you don't agree with you,

1152
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:45,580
you don't like as material
fucking obviously someone does.

1153
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:46,600
Are you saying that your,

1154
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:49,480
your sense of humor is
the only one that's valid?

1155
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:49,811
You know,

1156
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:52,720
like you can't enjoy Larry the
cable guy and no one can enjoy it.

1157
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,260
Will,

1158
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:53,720
there's,

1159
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,770
he's a racist and he says
racist things and no,

1160
00:31:56,771 --> 00:32:00,760
he says a lot of things that a guy that
was Larry the cable guy would fucking

1161
00:32:00,761 --> 00:32:01,790
say dry.

1162
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:06,130
And it would be funny having a guy in
a flannel tee shirt with cutoff sleeves

1163
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,930
talking about a ray blam angering.

1164
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,100
I'm damn towel aids.

1165
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,420
That's what he would say,

1166
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:10,960
you know,

1167
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,190
should fucking character.

1168
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,360
Well listen,

1169
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,080
you know,

1170
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,080
Andrew dice clay did the same except
Andrew Cain kind of became that guy.

1171
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,740
Andrew,

1172
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,880
you know the dice clay Andrew was Angelo
Civic Silverstein and the dice man was

1173
00:32:24,881 --> 00:32:26,230
one of his many characters,

1174
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:26,530
right?

1175
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,240
He would go up and do John Travolta.

1176
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:30,520
His fucking John Travolta is deadly.

1177
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,550
He would go up and do all these different
characters and the dice man just

1178
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:34,360
killed so much.

1179
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,650
It eventually became him.

1180
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,131
And then,

1181
00:32:36,131 --> 00:32:36,281
you know,

1182
00:32:36,281 --> 00:32:36,881
everywhere he goes,

1183
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:39,380
he's wearing weightlifting gloves
and leather jackets and shit.

1184
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:39,710
Well,

1185
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,010
I a

1186
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:40,820
guy,

1187
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,340
I think he's had to re,

1188
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,570
what happens is,

1189
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,180
is that with these careers is um,

1190
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,950
Gail again,

1191
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,640
you know,

1192
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,850
a year after Gilligan's
island goes off the air goes,

1193
00:32:52,851 --> 00:32:53,450
uh,

1194
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,560
Bob Denver goes,

1195
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:54,860
ah,

1196
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,491
fuck this,

1197
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:57,320
I'm not wearing that stupid white hat.

1198
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:59,180
And the red crew neck sweater thing,

1199
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,560
the white pants,

1200
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,640
like I bull shit.

1201
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,170
And then he does about 10
years of this is bullshit.

1202
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,780
And then he does about five
years of soul searching.

1203
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,740
And then at some point he opens
the closet and grabs that hat

1204
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,871
going down,

1205
00:33:14,871 --> 00:33:18,290
open that fucking boat show in Long Beach
and walk out of here with nine grand.

1206
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,250
And then it starts and then it starts
to wax the stouts trick about it.

1207
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,210
So I think,

1208
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:23,361
uh,

1209
00:33:23,361 --> 00:33:27,170
the dice man put down the pack of
cigarettes in the leather vest and said,

1210
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:27,470
ah,

1211
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:29,000
I'm going to do some other things.

1212
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:31,700
And then a certain point realize
ain't paying the bills doing it.

1213
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,370
Do you remember when he had a sitcom?

1214
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:33,880
He went,

1215
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,750
he went clean for,

1216
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,070
right.

1217
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,990
He had a sick on CBS and it was called
blessed this house or something like

1218
00:33:37,991 --> 00:33:38,071
that.

1219
00:33:38,071 --> 00:33:38,861
That wasn't it called.

1220
00:33:38,861 --> 00:33:42,880
That was like when kiss went on mass and
it was with the woman from raging bull.

1221
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,350
Yeah.

1222
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:44,831
Yeah.

1223
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:49,730
What the fuck is Hellman Roche Rossby Aye.

1224
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:51,933
I mean salad.

1225
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,840
The fuck was her name because she was
super hot and then she got Chubby as fuck.

1226
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,490
Yeah,

1227
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,360
she's a and o d deann.

1228
00:33:59,390 --> 00:33:59,631
No,

1229
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:00,590
not the Angelo.

1230
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,460
Um,

1231
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,450
fuck is her name.

1232
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,461
Cathy Moriarty.

1233
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:03,970
Moriarty.

1234
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:04,040
Yeah.

1235
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,660
Machine or a hot as fuck.

1236
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,290
Yeah.

1237
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,220
And then you know,

1238
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,180
much like all of us,

1239
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:08,901
she fell apart.

1240
00:34:08,901 --> 00:34:10,070
So the daisy Duke girl.

1241
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,910
Oh and tattered box.

1242
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,210
Sorry to comic book convention.

1243
00:34:14,211 --> 00:34:17,960
It was the saddest thing you will ever
see her sitting there with her little

1244
00:34:17,961 --> 00:34:18,441
short,

1245
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:20,390
but they weren't as
short as they used to be.

1246
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,010
Just sitting there.

1247
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,940
No one talking to her.

1248
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:24,530
No one even knowing that
she's sitting there,

1249
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:25,520
I just walk up and I'm like,

1250
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,650
this is daisy Duke right here.

1251
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:28,550
She goes and I'm like,

1252
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:28,761
Oh,

1253
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:29,750
you're signing autographs.

1254
00:34:29,751 --> 00:34:30,800
He's you guys $25.

1255
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:31,070
I'm like,

1256
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:31,840
oh no,

1257
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,360
that's right.

1258
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:32,751
And I was like,

1259
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,411
can I take a picture?

1260
00:34:33,411 --> 00:34:33,801
And she goes,

1261
00:34:33,801 --> 00:34:33,951
yeah,

1262
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:34,710
that's $10.

1263
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,911
I'm like,

1264
00:34:34,911 --> 00:34:35,001
no,

1265
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:35,930
it's the no with my camera.

1266
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,230
And she goes,

1267
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,460
yeah,

1268
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:36,650
yeah,

1269
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,483
it's $10.

1270
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,930
But it was the saddest thing ever.

1271
00:34:38,931 --> 00:34:39,141
I'm like,

1272
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:39,820
no thank you.

1273
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,611
And I just walked away.

1274
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,120
And this little daisy Duke just sit
in the corner by herself sitting at a

1275
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:44,870
folding chair.

1276
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,651
Can I tell you something?

1277
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:46,484
That's Saturn,

1278
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,690
uh,

1279
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,370
moments ago when Joe was like,

1280
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,141
you know,

1281
00:34:50,141 --> 00:34:51,580
what's the name of that author?

1282
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,640
And they put the fatwa on the guy,

1283
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,560
remember and,

1284
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:55,090
uh,

1285
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,560
wrote satanic verses.

1286
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:56,951
Remember that?

1287
00:34:56,951 --> 00:34:58,060
What was the name of that guy?

1288
00:34:58,061 --> 00:34:58,480
And I'm like,

1289
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,260
yeah,

1290
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,471
you know,

1291
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:00,400
that author member,

1292
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:00,801
he had to,

1293
00:35:00,801 --> 00:35:02,410
he had to hide because they'd put it,

1294
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,660
put a hit on him and Cat Stevens,

1295
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:05,080
uh,

1296
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:05,320
you know,

1297
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,660
gave a two thumbs up and
what's the name of that author?

1298
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:08,110
And I'm like,

1299
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:08,530
uh,

1300
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:08,791
yeah,

1301
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:09,130
I,

1302
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,540
I damn couldn't tell you,

1303
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:11,374
but when you're like,

1304
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,280
um,

1305
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
I saw daisy Duke,

1306
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,343
Catherine Bach,

1307
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,890
fucking sad.

1308
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,101
Well,

1309
00:35:18,101 --> 00:35:18,731
when we were kids,

1310
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:19,480
she was hot.

1311
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:19,990
I know.

1312
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:22,440
Fuck sad that that's
where my knowledge base,

1313
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:23,261
that old though.

1314
00:35:23,261 --> 00:35:24,120
How old is she?

1315
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:27,130
She looks probably about 50.

1316
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,540
So it's just the booze.

1317
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,500
Is it?

1318
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,030
Look just like sadness,

1319
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,013
sadness,

1320
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,911
booze or drugs.

1321
00:35:33,911 --> 00:35:34,101
It's a,

1322
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:36,340
it's amazing how the booze really jacks.

1323
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:36,610
Yeah,

1324
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:37,443
there's a little,

1325
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,070
weren't there as

1326
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,903
much anymore?

1327
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,690
She's done.

1328
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,830
But then you look at like,

1329
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:41,250
um,

1330
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:43,110
Christie Brinkley's still hot as fuck.

1331
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,700
Well somehow or another
she's keeping it together.

1332
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,600
She's like 53.

1333
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,700
I have this fun imaginary game.

1334
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,150
No,

1335
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,980
I like to play when it gets stone,

1336
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,430
which is a sort of the acts,

1337
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,131
it's like it's,

1338
00:35:54,131 --> 00:35:55,200
it's a cross.

1339
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,063
Okay.

1340
00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:01,100
And let's say when you
were in junior high,

1341
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,910
let's say you're,

1342
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:07,380
let's say you're in the seventh
grade for the sake argument and uh,

1343
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,630
Duke's a hazardous hitting its prime,

1344
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,940
the good old boy and a blown up down
house with a crossbow and whatnot.

1345
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,990
And you're,

1346
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,650
you're just sitting there and you're
seeing an episode that has Catherine Bach

1347
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,630
tight daisy dukes.

1348
00:36:21,631 --> 00:36:24,750
And she does that thing where she leans
over the open hood and the steam comes

1349
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:25,584
out and everything.

1350
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,850
And now there you are,

1351
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,120
little Pecker Wood in New Jersey
in seventh grade and you're fine.

1352
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,010
Now you're at the bottom of each acts.

1353
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,260
You couldn't get further away.

1354
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:34,600
There's,

1355
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,860
it's not like you stole
a bus ticket to La.

1356
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,700
You could fuck Catherine Bach.

1357
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,480
No Way.

1358
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,740
You're a million miles away.

1359
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,490
So true.

1360
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:41,970
Okay.

1361
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:42,803
But now,

1362
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,220
now you start heading up the
legs of the ax just to Google.

1363
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,720
Now we move on 10 years.

1364
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,310
Joseph,

1365
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:50,691
Joseph,

1366
00:36:50,691 --> 00:36:51,690
standup comedian,

1367
00:36:51,691 --> 00:36:52,590
getting started,

1368
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,360
having a little success,

1369
00:36:54,361 --> 00:36:55,440
making a little money,

1370
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:00,650
grown into his body and it's just
become sexual sexually charged.

1371
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,310
He's 23,

1372
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,640
2123 years of age now.

1373
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,070
A dukes of hazards been off the air,

1374
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:08,560
you know,

1375
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,210
uh,

1376
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:09,931
15 years.

1377
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:10,470
Yeah,

1378
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,100
they've been off.

1379
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,311
Well,

1380
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:11,581
no,

1381
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:12,330
I'm saying at this point,

1382
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:12,511
yeah.

1383
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:12,781
Okay.

1384
00:37:12,781 --> 00:37:14,040
Let's say it's been off 10 years,

1385
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,821
10 years,

1386
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:15,630
but she's still,

1387
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:16,590
she's 36.

1388
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:17,670
They're looking pretty tight,

1389
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,330
you know,

1390
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,163
whatever.

1391
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,970
But Joe's not looking too bad either.

1392
00:37:20,971 --> 00:37:22,650
And Joe starting to do a little standup,

1393
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,460
whatever.

1394
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,630
At what point,

1395
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:25,464
Joe,

1396
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,040
at what point do you cross her?

1397
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,440
Like at a certain point,

1398
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,161
I mean,

1399
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,600
when you're in the seventh grade,

1400
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,370
you were sold your fucking soul and killed
your step mom to get one liquor that

1401
00:37:38,371 --> 00:37:38,761
pussy.

1402
00:37:38,761 --> 00:37:38,991
Right,

1403
00:37:38,991 --> 00:37:39,570
right.

1404
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:40,530
But now,

1405
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,550
but now,

1406
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,080
but if I asked you right pulsive
if I asked you this second.

1407
00:37:44,081 --> 00:37:44,280
Yeah.

1408
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,440
Well then obviously you guys crossed.

1409
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,010
Yes.

1410
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,390
What Year did you cross?

1411
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,260
That's,

1412
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,280
that's my game.

1413
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,060
And then,

1414
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:51,270
but,

1415
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,170
and then there's something like,

1416
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,401
Ooh,

1417
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,000
you haven't crossed Christie Brinkley yet,

1418
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,640
or maybe you're meeting maybe
about nine months away from,

1419
00:37:56,910 --> 00:37:58,260
from just hitting right in the middle.

1420
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,690
If Chritton and Christie
Brinkley's still above me.

1421
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,933
She's got me.

1422
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,211
Yeah,

1423
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:03,811
she's shy,

1424
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:06,700
but maybe she's still hot
and she's 53 you know,

1425
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,110
she's like 57 Oh,

1426
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,003
Jesus.

1427
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,781
That's my point.

1428
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:13,860
She's going to be 60 maybe I crossed
her at 57 but she looks great.

1429
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,490
Yeah.

1430
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:14,971
Maybe.

1431
00:38:14,971 --> 00:38:16,470
Maybe she does it with TV.

1432
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:17,400
You can never really tell.

1433
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,840
I'll have to ask Christine.

1434
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:19,110
We'll,

1435
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,490
we'll see what we can agree to.

1436
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,270
An awesome,

1437
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:22,430
yeah.

1438
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:22,601
The,

1439
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:23,850
the Catherine Bach thing,

1440
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,220
it all depends on how much
Catherine Bach took care of herself.

1441
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,140
Whether or not she was still in movies.

1442
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:28,621
You know what I mean?

1443
00:38:28,621 --> 00:38:29,454
Yeah.

1444
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,031
There's,

1445
00:38:30,031 --> 00:38:31,490
there's some women that
even though they've,

1446
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,010
they've kind of deteriorated there,

1447
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,330
still have a level of respect.

1448
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,770
News radio.

1449
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,100
She's

1450
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,410
been off TV for 14 years.

1451
00:38:38,411 --> 00:38:39,101
You know what I'm saying?

1452
00:38:39,101 --> 00:38:40,330
Once fear factor happened,

1453
00:38:40,331 --> 00:38:41,590
I had her mine,

1454
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,390
she was mine when I was hosting.

1455
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,350
If I want him to get Katherine,

1456
00:38:44,351 --> 00:38:46,320
I don't work out some
sort of bracket list,

1457
00:38:46,321 --> 00:38:46,871
you know what I mean?

1458
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:47,681
We're just really,

1459
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:51,160
you could find all the chicks you wanted
to fuck when you were in the eighth

1460
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:53,560
grade and see when you cross them,

1461
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,640
there is nothing stranger than watching
a woman go from being beautiful and

1462
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,710
having ultimate power.

1463
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,300
A really super hot chick,

1464
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,051
super hot.

1465
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:05,940
21 year old chick has almost,

1466
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,350
it's almost voodoo.

1467
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,470
You know like their body and
the way they move and like toy,

1468
00:39:10,471 --> 00:39:14,850
they smell and if they like you and if
they're smart too and if you're not sure

1469
00:39:14,851 --> 00:39:15,684
if you can get them,

1470
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:16,890
God damn,

1471
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,780
it's almost fucking vote.

1472
00:39:18,781 --> 00:39:19,710
Its ultimate power.

1473
00:39:19,711 --> 00:39:21,360
It's super celebrity power.

1474
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,840
The reason why celebrities gets so
ridiculously fucked up trumps everything.

1475
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,140
The reason why celebrities get so
ridiculously big headed and she goes,

1476
00:39:28,141 --> 00:39:28,921
everywhere you go,

1477
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:30,180
people are kissing your ass.

1478
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,021
Everywhere you go,

1479
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:31,500
people are,

1480
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,280
here's you know,

1481
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,300
free bottle service.

1482
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:34,800
Here's a limousine for free,

1483
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:36,420
please eat at my restaurant.

1484
00:39:36,421 --> 00:39:37,410
You're amazing.

1485
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,770
You've changed my life and you
start thinking about the shot.

1486
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,030
That's an awesome thought,

1487
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:42,540
Mr. Rowe.

1488
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,260
But girls from the moment
they're little from the moment.

1489
00:39:46,261 --> 00:39:47,250
They literally are so cute.

1490
00:39:47,251 --> 00:39:48,330
You're so beautiful.

1491
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,910
And then they're in high school
and then it becomes currency.

1492
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,060
It becomes the thing that defines them
and then it goes away and it goes away

1493
00:39:56,521 --> 00:39:57,354
slowly.

1494
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,141
It goes away.

1495
00:39:58,141 --> 00:40:00,750
Weird when they start looking
like that rough bar girl,

1496
00:40:00,751 --> 00:40:01,081
you know,

1497
00:40:01,081 --> 00:40:01,891
like still hot,

1498
00:40:01,891 --> 00:40:03,440
but in our thirties but you know,

1499
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,330
he could see her at a cigarette and maybe
I'd get a couple of shots of Jack and

1500
00:40:06,331 --> 00:40:08,070
you and let's just go fuck in the woods.

1501
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:08,610
You know,

1502
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:09,810
just some crazy bitch.

1503
00:40:09,811 --> 00:40:10,170
It's just,

1504
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,690
she's not the 21 year old
grows that cheerleader who you,

1505
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:13,830
it was impossible to get.

1506
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,180
Now she's just wild bitch.

1507
00:40:15,181 --> 00:40:15,660
He's just,

1508
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:15,811
yeah,

1509
00:40:15,811 --> 00:40:16,501
you feel forced.

1510
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,520
You're trying to pay our bills.

1511
00:40:17,521 --> 00:40:18,720
You know she's been divorced,

1512
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,231
you know,

1513
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:21,600
and then eventually they become monsters.

1514
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,850
They become this weird thing,

1515
00:40:23,851 --> 00:40:24,870
especially if they get,

1516
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,460
they go down the surgery route,

1517
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,170
please ladies,

1518
00:40:28,171 --> 00:40:30,060
please just get old.

1519
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,770
Don't go crazy.

1520
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,640
Don't fuck with your lips and your
neck and all that nerdy shit does,

1521
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,080
does not make you look better.

1522
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,930
It makes you look different and that
different is not a good different,

1523
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:41,100
it's a weird monster.

1524
00:40:41,101 --> 00:40:41,700
Different,

1525
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,320
well,

1526
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,320
you guys are going through historically
a bad phase because your mother didn't

1527
00:40:48,981 --> 00:40:53,390
have to worry about plastic surgery
because it didn't really exist and your

1528
00:40:53,391 --> 00:40:57,500
daughter won't really have to worry about
it because they'll have perfected it.

1529
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,850
You even are,

1530
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,170
you are in network engineering.

1531
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:00,351
Yeah.

1532
00:41:00,351 --> 00:41:03,110
You're in the experimental
phase and it ain't working out.

1533
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:08,111
It's Sorta like CGI that it's a bad
generation because our folks were watching

1534
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,490
movies that every stunt
was an actual stunt,

1535
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:14,600
just done by duty,

1536
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:15,500
didn't give a shit.

1537
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,440
And our kids enjoy CGI.

1538
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:19,790
That works so effectively.

1539
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:20,750
You can't tell.

1540
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:24,560
We went through a whole phase where we
had to watch shitty movies with really

1541
00:41:24,561 --> 00:41:25,740
bad effects.

1542
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:25,930
Yeah.

1543
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:30,170
Because they were perfecting it on our
watch and we were sitting in the theater,

1544
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,100
well now we're in the
theater of plastic and all

1545
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,933
you women,

1546
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:35,780
it's accent.

1547
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,591
You're essentially,

1548
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:40,670
it's the 50 year experimental phase
while they're working on it and you're

1549
00:41:40,671 --> 00:41:41,181
looking like,

1550
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:42,014
shit,

1551
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:42,943
you know,

1552
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,420
I have to compliment you because
Brian Cowen said this about you and is

1553
00:41:45,421 --> 00:41:46,340
absolutely the truth.

1554
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,550
You are the best at taking one scenario,

1555
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,450
whatever it is,

1556
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,360
and just going on this fucking rant.

1557
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:53,901
Amazing.

1558
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,390
Coming to these awesome conclusions.

1559
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,110
You know,

1560
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:57,440
it's,

1561
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:57,791
you're,

1562
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:58,970
you're dead on about it.

1563
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,141
I love that.

1564
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:00,990
Bryan Callen,

1565
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,833
by the way,

1566
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,920
I ran into that guy and,

1567
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,700
uh,

1568
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,680
we're shooting a movie and

1569
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,060
just doing a little bit
part and a little bit movie.

1570
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,540
And Brian came up to me and he said,

1571
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:14,374
uh,

1572
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:14,721
you know,

1573
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:17,540
you may be the best at
doing this improv stuff.

1574
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:18,301
And I said,

1575
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:18,650
uh,

1576
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,700
I don't know,

1577
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,910
and there's probably other
guys to do it better than me.

1578
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:23,540
And he said,

1579
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,320
who?

1580
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:24,930
And I said,

1581
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:25,790
I don't know.

1582
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,480
And he said,

1583
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:26,661
well,

1584
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:28,130
someone's gotta be the best.

1585
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,053
And I said,

1586
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,470
I guess they do.

1587
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:30,980
And he said,

1588
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,970
well then that's you.

1589
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:32,893
And I was like,

1590
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:34,520
all right,

1591
00:42:34,521 --> 00:42:35,160
exactly.

1592
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,950
Story in those exact words,

1593
00:42:36,951 --> 00:42:37,611
I've walked away,

1594
00:42:37,611 --> 00:42:39,060
I've never fucking felt better in my life.

1595
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,391
It's true,

1596
00:42:41,391 --> 00:42:41,661
man,

1597
00:42:41,661 --> 00:42:43,040
you go on these wild rants,

1598
00:42:43,041 --> 00:42:44,600
but they come to conclusions,

1599
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:44,961
they're like,

1600
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:46,250
they'd come to great conclusions.

1601
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:47,330
Like I don't know,

1602
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:47,630
uh,

1603
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:50,740
how you generate material or if any of
this stuff you've already talked about on

1604
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:51,111
stage,

1605
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:54,860
but seriously go back and listen to
this podcast with a fucking notebook.

1606
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,840
And there's like three good bits in there.

1607
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:57,680
At least.

1608
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,300
I never listened to anything
or go back and read anything.

1609
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:04,591
That's how I,

1610
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:05,720
that's how I wrote the book.

1611
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,340
I swear to God just said,

1612
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,490
you have to listen to all
this stuff and find the stuff,

1613
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,180
the stuff out.

1614
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:15,380
But it's always sad because I've tried
it a few times and a few times the guys

1615
00:43:15,381 --> 00:43:18,800
were gone and listened to a couple of
shows and then I go find anything good.

1616
00:43:18,801 --> 00:43:20,480
And they're like not so much.

1617
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,470
And it's like,

1618
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:21,921
oh,

1619
00:43:21,921 --> 00:43:23,420
you mean I didn't say
anything fucking good.

1620
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,480
You got to get them better
guy should get a better dad,

1621
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:27,590
a better guy that going a
little bit of crap comb.

1622
00:43:27,591 --> 00:43:30,200
Get a guy and make them get
high before he watches you.

1623
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:31,460
That's very important.

1624
00:43:31,461 --> 00:43:32,300
We were talking about this,

1625
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:33,710
you know there's a lot of people say,

1626
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:33,891
Oh,

1627
00:43:33,891 --> 00:43:37,010
you're always talking about pod while
he was talking about pot because it's

1628
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:38,360
fucking awesome.

1629
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:38,930
Alright,

1630
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,870
and it's awesome and it has
this terrible reputation,

1631
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,920
this wrong,

1632
00:43:42,921 --> 00:43:47,310
incorrect reputation because of fucking
Nancy Reagan and just say no and Nixon

1633
00:43:47,311 --> 00:43:50,510
and all the nonsense and
propaganda that they force fed you.

1634
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,050
It is a plant that is
here and it has benefits.

1635
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,300
A great benefits for your mind.

1636
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,780
I to pretend that it
doesn't to me is ridiculous.

1637
00:43:59,781 --> 00:44:00,710
We did a few things.

1638
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:04,640
We started lumping drugs
in under one umbrella.

1639
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,540
Absolutely true.

1640
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:08,000
Just like you would no sooner do it with,

1641
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,710
you were just talking about women.

1642
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:10,573
Hey Joe,

1643
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,560
I would like to shut you up with woman.

1644
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,170
You'd be like,

1645
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:14,870
what colors her hair?

1646
00:44:14,871 --> 00:44:15,651
How tall is she?

1647
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:16,550
How old is he?

1648
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:17,320
What's a color size?

1649
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,520
Someone says you hate women because women,

1650
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:20,210
some women,

1651
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:20,601
one woman.

1652
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:25,601
So it all just became drugs and some how
methamphetamine and marijuana just sort

1653
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:28,730
of got lumped in under the same umbrella,

1654
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,310
which is drugs and such a huge mistake.

1655
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,070
And then the other

1656
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,070
thing that drives me insane about our
legal system when they pull those guys

1657
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:43,461
over who went on to rob the
north Hollywood bank over
there and Laurel Canyon,

1658
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:44,780
that's crazy.

1659
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,470
Motherfuckers who were like,

1660
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:46,981
and by the way,

1661
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:51,750
they were beaked out of their mind on
uppers and that's why the steroids,

1662
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,860
the steroids and everything else.

1663
00:44:52,861 --> 00:44:53,694
But all right,

1664
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:58,560
they pulled those dudes over in like
Eagle Rock and they popped the trunk of

1665
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:02,430
their car and they found a ski masks,

1666
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,260
police scanners,

1667
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,723
um,

1668
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,790
body armor maps,

1669
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,500
um,

1670
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,333
uh,

1671
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:13,920
automatic weapons that
were modified illegally,

1672
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,760
I mean semiautomatic weapons and were
modified to go full automatic with armor

1673
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:21,360
piercing rounds and extended
banana clips and stuff.

1674
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:25,980
They found everything and the trunk
of their car that basically said,

1675
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:26,221
oh,

1676
00:45:26,221 --> 00:45:28,080
these guys are on their way to rob a bank.

1677
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,280
Um,

1678
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,990
when they arrested them,

1679
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:35,910
they could not get them for attempted
bank robbery because the law says,

1680
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:36,833
Hey man,

1681
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,240
we've got to catch you robbing a bank.

1682
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:42,870
Just because you're driving around police
scanners and armor piercing bullets

1683
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,080
and ski masks doesn't mean
you're going to rob a bank.

1684
00:45:46,081 --> 00:45:49,320
We know practically it means
you're going to rob a bank,

1685
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:50,970
but the way our law system,

1686
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
the system works is you have to rob a
bank and then we will prosecute you for

1687
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:57,174
robbing a bank.

1688
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:58,111
And we all agree,

1689
00:45:58,111 --> 00:45:58,501
all right,

1690
00:45:58,501 --> 00:45:59,221
that's how it works.

1691
00:45:59,221 --> 00:46:01,410
And these guys got locked up for
a little something something.

1692
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,490
And when they got out,

1693
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,880
they gave them back a lot of their
police scanners and a lot of their shit.

1694
00:46:05,881 --> 00:46:07,950
That was their property fine.

1695
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,430
Then they robbed the bank and then
they had the north Hollywood shootout,

1696
00:46:11,431 --> 00:46:13,200
which was completely and utterly insane.

1697
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,760
But the point is this,

1698
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,560
we could not prosecute them for robbing
a bank before they robbed the bank.

1699
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,740
And how come when you get busted for
more than a shoe box full of marijuana or

1700
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:27,510
even a coffee can full of marijuana,

1701
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,490
you get intent to distribute.

1702
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:31,770
They don't have to catch you distributing.

1703
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,350
Maybe I just like to stock up on weed.

1704
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:35,760
That's insane.

1705
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:36,780
That's an insane part.

1706
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:41,781
A lot to me because every other thing
works is we need a body for murder and we

1707
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:43,980
need a witness for attempted murder.

1708
00:46:43,981 --> 00:46:45,300
This is the only thing where they go,

1709
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:50,630
you were going to do with this pot
even though they never caught you doing

1710
00:46:50,881 --> 00:46:51,900
anything with it.

1711
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:52,621
And again,

1712
00:46:52,621 --> 00:46:56,280
maybe you like to shop like you
shop at smart and final or Costco.

1713
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:59,460
We just want a 55 gallon drum
of garbanzo beans and you,

1714
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,780
that's your fucking business.

1715
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:03,710
That's how I used to do it before
the [inaudible] stores came around.

1716
00:47:03,711 --> 00:47:06,350
I used to buy in bulk because I
didn't want to deal with these guys.

1717
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:06,920
You know,

1718
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,720
there was a dude named Jake the snake,

1719
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,750
then Eddie Bravo's friend that we used
to have to fucking deal with and used to

1720
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:12,511
buy weed from him.

1721
00:47:12,511 --> 00:47:13,400
And he was this,

1722
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:14,610
he was so stupid.

1723
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:15,321
And Eddie Bravo.

1724
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:15,980
So you know,

1725
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,100
black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu choked
out one of the first guys to ever choke

1726
00:47:19,101 --> 00:47:20,360
out a great team competition.

1727
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:21,830
And this fucking idiot was like,

1728
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:22,161
man,

1729
00:47:22,161 --> 00:47:23,360
you could do that shit to me.

1730
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,850
Eddie had strangled his kid three
times on it's fucking front law.

1731
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:27,830
Do you kid do that again?

1732
00:47:27,831 --> 00:47:28,580
You got lucky.

1733
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,290
You had to do it.

1734
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:29,541
And again,

1735
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:29,710
and yet,

1736
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:32,680
and this kid was so stupid and
we were buying weed from him.

1737
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,491
And so,

1738
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:33,731
you know,

1739
00:47:33,731 --> 00:47:36,320
I would just buy a big pile of
us interact to deal with this.

1740
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,730
God,

1741
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:37,630
please shut the fuck up.

1742
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:38,111
Here's the money.

1743
00:47:38,111 --> 00:47:38,944
Please shut the fuck up.

1744
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,770
It's so sad that you can't,

1745
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:45,130
as a homeowner and a
taxpayer just plant a pot,

1746
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:46,410
plant your backyard.

1747
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,101
You can row,

1748
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:47,861
you can now,

1749
00:47:47,861 --> 00:47:49,840
but the problem is federally you can't,

1750
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,640
you can't statewise you know,

1751
00:47:51,641 --> 00:47:52,940
as far as the state's concerned,

1752
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:53,381
you know,

1753
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:53,891
it depends on,

1754
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:55,240
each county has a different law,

1755
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:58,000
but you can have a certain amount of
clients and a certain amount of pot,

1756
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:01,510
you can have up to like a half a pound
of pot and up to x amount of plants.

1757
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:04,270
As long as you have a medical
recommendation or if you have a waiver,

1758
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,590
you can get even more plants,

1759
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,960
which I do have a waiver
because I need extra,

1760
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,750
I could waiver.

1761
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,300
And my dad gave me that fucking waiver.

1762
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:18,080
My mom had a pot plant in her backyard
when I was like in the sixth grade.

1763
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:20,440
Really?

1764
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,190
Yeah.

1765
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:21,820
Yeah.

1766
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,930
And I told my buddy,

1767
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:23,740
uh,

1768
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:26,950
Hameed and the next day it was gone.

1769
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:27,784
He stolen.

1770
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,270
Wow.

1771
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,450
I'm just doing the Hamid math on that one.

1772
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:31,120
Wow.

1773
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,730
What a Douche bag Amit is.

1774
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:32,870
Yeah.

1775
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,000
I never told my mom.

1776
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:34,930
Wow,

1777
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,390
she's a big Joe Rogan podcast
or she's going to hear it.

1778
00:48:37,391 --> 00:48:37,691
Sorry,

1779
00:48:37,691 --> 00:48:38,500
mom.

1780
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,333
Yeah.

1781
00:48:39,370 --> 00:48:40,280
And the uh,

1782
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:40,601
yeah,

1783
00:48:40,601 --> 00:48:42,250
the weed thing is that I,

1784
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:44,770
I've said this many times
and I think I said it,

1785
00:48:44,771 --> 00:48:45,604
my book,

1786
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,120
here's,

1787
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,490
here's the difference
between weed and other drugs.

1788
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,910
I would rather have 1000 guys that smoked
weed live in my neighborhood rather

1789
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:57,790
than one tweaker oh yeah.

1790
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,980
Just one fucking meth head.

1791
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,001
One method.

1792
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:01,601
And you see them,

1793
00:49:01,601 --> 00:49:01,901
you like,

1794
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:02,734
I think I,

1795
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,330
we need to get rid of that guy.

1796
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,650
Think about killing them.

1797
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,130
Right.

1798
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:06,360
You know,

1799
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,520
like there's a disease person.

1800
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:10,690
It's like I'm watching the show walking
dead that I just bought the DVD,

1801
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,580
the set pretty fucking bad ass.

1802
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:14,590
Good Zombie show.

1803
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,341
But you know,

1804
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:15,701
there's a,

1805
00:49:15,701 --> 00:49:19,030
there comes a point in the show where
people get bit and they're all sitting

1806
00:49:19,031 --> 00:49:20,200
around in front of figure how,

1807
00:49:20,201 --> 00:49:21,070
what are we going to do?

1808
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:23,320
And some people want to kill
the guy and some people don't.

1809
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:24,131
But you know,

1810
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,720
a method is just like a Zombie.

1811
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:27,200
It's like this guy's infected.

1812
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:28,780
I mean this guy is fucked up.

1813
00:49:28,781 --> 00:49:29,471
He could do anything.

1814
00:49:29,471 --> 00:49:30,304
He can kill you.

1815
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,930
He could do anything to
try to get this shit.

1816
00:49:31,931 --> 00:49:34,180
They have terrible decision
making capabilities.

1817
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,300
They're almost like just
a high functioning Zombie.

1818
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:37,661
I mean,

1819
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:38,494
it really is.

1820
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:38,831
Yeah.

1821
00:49:38,831 --> 00:49:39,850
And idea that,

1822
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,100
I haven't checked recent statistics,

1823
00:49:42,101 --> 00:49:43,630
but about five years ago,

1824
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:48,220
this country spent more on pot
eradication than it did on math.

1825
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:50,680
And that's utterly insane.

1826
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:51,580
It's just insane.

1827
00:49:51,581 --> 00:49:52,930
It's just a financial thing.

1828
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,370
It's 100% of financial thing.

1829
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,900
And there's a huge industry and
keeping marijuana illegal as far as law

1830
00:49:58,901 --> 00:49:59,621
enforcement,

1831
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,610
as far as you know,

1832
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:00,990
the,

1833
00:50:00,990 --> 00:50:01,151
the,

1834
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:02,740
the people in pharmaceutical companies,

1835
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,870
they want marijuana to stay illegal.

1836
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:08,980
There's a lot of bad fucking cops
out there when it comes to drugs.

1837
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,330
And one of the things they do,

1838
00:50:10,331 --> 00:50:12,640
and this is a common thing
in the grower community,

1839
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,680
they rob pot dealers,

1840
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:15,514
cops do,

1841
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,900
and they did it to a friend of mine.

1842
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:19,060
A friend of mine was growing and his,

1843
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,760
his neighbor turned him in
when he was growing legally.

1844
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:23,350
So the cops came and you know,

1845
00:50:23,351 --> 00:50:23,621
they,

1846
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:26,920
they ask them questions and they go
over all of his shit and he goes,

1847
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:27,990
you're alright,

1848
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,670
you're legal.

1849
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,580
And then a couple of weeks
later he gets home invaded.

1850
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,420
Okay.

1851
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,780
Yeah.

1852
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:33,710
By Cop.

1853
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:34,960
Wow.

1854
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,580
By fucking cops.

1855
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:41,020
The guy says freeze pulls a gun on him
and it goes freeze and my friend goes,

1856
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,100
freeze,

1857
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,270
what the fuck are you saying?

1858
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,620
What are you a fucking cop?

1859
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:47,230
And the guy panics and shuts out in.

1860
00:50:47,231 --> 00:50:52,140
It became this crazy fucking situation
where he even is pretty short,

1861
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,500
knows who the cops are but can't say
anything because he doesn't want the cops

1862
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:57,101
coming after him.

1863
00:50:57,101 --> 00:50:58,180
He had a fucking move.

1864
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,290
He hit a move cause he got

1865
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,210
rob by cops.

1866
00:51:00,211 --> 00:51:01,770
What's up with the neighbors?

1867
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:01,990
I,

1868
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:03,390
that's my big question.

1869
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,130
Up to the fucking neighbors.

1870
00:51:05,131 --> 00:51:10,131
I've had so many shit ball
douchebag neighbors called
the cops over nothing like

1871
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,260
building departments involved with things.

1872
00:51:13,261 --> 00:51:15,390
Like I've never had a cool neighbor.

1873
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,810
I had no idea that there
would be this many ass wipes.

1874
00:51:18,811 --> 00:51:19,080
Like,

1875
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:19,950
I mean I've had,

1876
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:25,310
I had a New Year's Eve party where the
cops showed up at nine 45 on a Saturday

1877
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:28,680
night on New Year's Eve,

1878
00:51:28,681 --> 00:51:32,190
which meant the guy called
him at nine or you know,

1879
00:51:32,191 --> 00:51:35,670
it takes cops a good hour to
fucking roll on one of those calls.

1880
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:41,030
Somebody called on new years eve at
like eight 45 to come to my house.

1881
00:51:41,671 --> 00:51:42,850
It wasn't raging or,

1882
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,450
and it was just a bunch of people
sitting around having a beer.

1883
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:46,220
Uh,

1884
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,570
and the fucking cops showed up at nine 45.

1885
00:51:48,571 --> 00:51:49,380
And the cops,

1886
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,820
the cops walked in and I said,

1887
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,530
you want me to turn the stereo down?

1888
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:52,891
And they said,

1889
00:51:52,891 --> 00:51:54,030
not if you don't want to.

1890
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,380
And I said,

1891
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,360
even the cops knew eight luck.

1892
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,370
If it's 4:00 AM and you guys are just
fucking cranking a helter skelter,

1893
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:03,563
uh,

1894
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:04,800
is loud as you can,

1895
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:06,360
well then there's going to be a problem.

1896
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:07,081
But he,

1897
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:07,940
the cop walked in,

1898
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:09,270
looked around and just went,

1899
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:09,471
oh,

1900
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:10,304
this is bullshit.

1901
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:14,610
And I released this one person who was
sitting home alone would wanted the

1902
00:52:14,611 --> 00:52:18,690
hundred and 50 people to all go home
because he wanted to fucking finish

1903
00:52:18,691 --> 00:52:23,691
watching his Hannity and Colmes or
wherever the fight is on at 10 o'clock.

1904
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:24,901
And it's like,

1905
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:25,740
what the fuck?

1906
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:27,780
I've never called the cops and my life,

1907
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:28,140
I,

1908
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,670
I'll put earplugs in,

1909
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,920
I'll put a shade all knock on the door or

1910
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:32,181
and,

1911
00:52:32,181 --> 00:52:32,711
and go,

1912
00:52:32,711 --> 00:52:33,460
hey man,

1913
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:34,570
this shit's really loud.

1914
00:52:34,571 --> 00:52:36,070
Is there any way we can
just lower it a little?

1915
00:52:36,071 --> 00:52:36,221
I mean,

1916
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:37,300
if it's really crazy,

1917
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,590
when I lived in apartments,

1918
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:39,251
you know,

1919
00:52:39,251 --> 00:52:41,140
but I had good neighbors in the mountains,

1920
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:43,180
the mountains when I
was living in Colorado.

1921
00:52:43,181 --> 00:52:46,240
It was kind of interesting because you
kind of have to help each other out up

1922
00:52:46,241 --> 00:52:46,720
there.

1923
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,360
You're all alone with mountain
lions and bears and Shit,

1924
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:49,601
you know.

1925
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,760
And they'd give like good
advice about like what to do,

1926
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:53,530
have a pair of tax you and shit like that.

1927
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:54,431
But they were,

1928
00:52:54,431 --> 00:52:55,720
they were there different up there,

1929
00:52:55,721 --> 00:52:55,900
man.

1930
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:58,000
But there were really far
apart from each other.

1931
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,391
You know,

1932
00:52:58,391 --> 00:53:00,040
everybody was a drive,

1933
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:00,461
you know,

1934
00:53:00,461 --> 00:53:03,520
everybody was a quarter mile
walking distance from each other.

1935
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:03,840
Yeah.

1936
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:05,500
That Helms fuck yet helps,

1937
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:05,741
man.

1938
00:53:05,741 --> 00:53:06,910
That's the worst thing about La.

1939
00:53:06,911 --> 00:53:07,630
And I'll tell you what,

1940
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:12,630
you being on your podcast the other day
completely reignited my escape from La,

1941
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:14,440
a scenario.

1942
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:18,070
And I been talking to Mrs Rogan about
it and we fucking started looking at

1943
00:53:18,071 --> 00:53:19,270
houses in boulder again.

1944
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:22,930
We started talking to real estate guys
about the move I think is we're going to

1945
00:53:22,931 --> 00:53:26,790
probably look to get a summer place and
then eventually try to move into the

1946
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,050
summer place and then know,

1947
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:28,401
you know,

1948
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:29,520
and you get the fuck Outta here.

1949
00:53:29,521 --> 00:53:30,180
But,

1950
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,010
but the problem is that number,

1951
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,820
the number of people when you've got so
many people and they're stacked on top

1952
00:53:35,821 --> 00:53:36,900
of each other and uh,

1953
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:37,261
you know,

1954
00:53:37,261 --> 00:53:40,430
there's one guy next to her door
and it's fucking dog is barking.

1955
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:43,170
I was over a friend's house the other
day and right next door to her house,

1956
00:53:43,171 --> 00:53:43,950
her dogs,

1957
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,990
these dogs are barking like fucking crazy.

1958
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,050
And then behind her there's some other
dogs and they hear these dogs barking.

1959
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,500
So they come and triangulate the parking.

1960
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:55,050
There's parking from here and parking
from there and everybody's jammed on top

1961
00:53:55,051 --> 00:53:58,040
of each other and you're fucking TV's
too loud to hear your songs on it.

1962
00:53:58,041 --> 00:53:59,970
And everybody's laughing by the pool.

1963
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:01,080
There's too much input,

1964
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:01,980
there's too much.

1965
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:02,250
Nah,

1966
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:02,620
listen,

1967
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,480
I agree.

1968
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,150
Even on a personal level,

1969
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:11,230
I ever share a bachelor apartment with
a chick or just like a single with a

1970
00:54:11,821 --> 00:54:14,420
chick is fucking almost impossible.

1971
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:15,810
Hard to get along.

1972
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,240
It's just literal square footage.

1973
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,490
When you're on top of each other,

1974
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:21,810
you're fuck,

1975
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:25,080
you have to be so fucking
compatible and so cool.

1976
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:25,681
You know,

1977
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:26,281
when I tried it,

1978
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:31,230
I was 21 and the girl was 20 and we
were both poor and we're both working,

1979
00:54:31,231 --> 00:54:31,441
you know,

1980
00:54:31,441 --> 00:54:34,770
I was trying to be a comedian and she
was trying to manage restaurants and we

1981
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,330
never lived with anybody before.

1982
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:39,060
We'd live with their fucking parents and
all of a sudden we're living together.

1983
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:40,230
It was ridiculous.

1984
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:41,730
It was a terrible idea for me.

1985
00:54:41,731 --> 00:54:46,731
And Catherine Bach were shit
up in [inaudible] 79 but
the girl was great before

1986
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:48,540
that and I was great before that,

1987
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:48,900
you know,

1988
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,100
I'm sure she probably thought,

1989
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:50,551
yeah,

1990
00:54:50,551 --> 00:54:51,384
like,

1991
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,750
you know,

1992
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:53,990
he's so fun and it was
so much fun to hand.

1993
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,380
I tell everybody,

1994
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:57,090
like whenever they ask about like,

1995
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:57,600
uh,

1996
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:57,841
you know,

1997
00:54:57,841 --> 00:54:59,130
relationship stuff,

1998
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,990
I just go square footage.

1999
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:01,741
Like when I go,

2000
00:55:01,741 --> 00:55:03,630
what's your marital advice?

2001
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,620
Square footage.

2002
00:55:04,621 --> 00:55:08,400
And to Tiva us the LDF spread it out.

2003
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:12,210
Don't hate anyone you
have to live on top of.

2004
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:15,290
Do you appreciate when you go on the road
when you read on the road and then you

2005
00:55:15,291 --> 00:55:16,050
come home?

2006
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:16,530
Yeah,

2007
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,341
that makes man,

2008
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:18,510
you know when you're around,

2009
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:19,920
you know everybody all the time.

2010
00:55:19,921 --> 00:55:21,300
He feels around you and burn anybody.

2011
00:55:21,301 --> 00:55:22,950
When you're around them all the time.

2012
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:23,620
You know,

2013
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,260
you just get sick of them.

2014
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:29,070
It's boring and it's the same input is
coming in over and over and over again.

2015
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:30,960
And you start analyzing that input.

2016
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:31,920
That's why people started going,

2017
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:33,840
why do you fucking do that
thing with your fingernails?

2018
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:35,730
What do you give a shit what
I do with my fingernails?

2019
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:37,950
Because they see you
doing this all the time.

2020
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,010
If they just met you and I
saw you biting your nails,

2021
00:55:40,011 --> 00:55:40,101
like,

2022
00:55:40,101 --> 00:55:40,201
oh,

2023
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:41,670
he's biting his nail
wouldn't be a big deal.

2024
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,520
But you live with someone and you see
him biting their fucking nail every day.

2025
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:45,750
You want to break their fingers off.

2026
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:46,411
What are you doing?

2027
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:47,330
You crazy ass hole.

2028
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,030
I,

2029
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:50,010
when I go on the road and I come back,

2030
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,360
I'm so thankful.

2031
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:52,021
Like Risa.

2032
00:55:52,021 --> 00:55:52,351
Yeah.

2033
00:55:52,351 --> 00:55:52,860
It's like,

2034
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,590
it makes me so much more
enthusiastic about everybody.

2035
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,910
Plus sleeping on a shitty mattress
with a just pentagram drawn in her.

2036
00:56:01,111 --> 00:56:02,880
It just make you miss your pill.

2037
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:05,280
It's just a little bit of talking
to captain just over here.

2038
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:08,250
If I left this motherfucker
throws loads on the walls.

2039
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:11,910
He calls it Spiderman hotels because
that can cause you can't do it at home.

2040
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:13,500
It's like Vic case and
say throw it everywhere.

2041
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,530
That's roommates but well the only asked
the question is cause cause really on

2042
00:56:20,371 --> 00:56:21,060
the walls.

2043
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,100
This is one of the reasons why when
I go to hotels every time I can I get

2044
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,933
a sweet.

2045
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:25,390
Yeah.

2046
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:27,430
Cause I know guys like you
and not going to get sweets.

2047
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,410
And so I'd have to look at
what Oh loads everywhere.

2048
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:30,490
Literally throw it,

2049
00:56:30,491 --> 00:56:30,761
you know,

2050
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:33,720
blow shoots it in his hand and
then throws it like Spiderman.

2051
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:38,150
Oh cause it's turned the
corner on this activity.

2052
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,443
Know.

2053
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,120
But now he's starting to like it.

2054
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,110
It's great that you're just
beating off into a wall.

2055
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:48,790
Some poor lady from Guatemala has
got to clean your loads of photos.

2056
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,840
This is a picture of a man in a canoe
fly fishing and it's got a load on it.

2057
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:56,050
She's got a scrape it off at a nice
hotel that where they have like black

2058
00:56:56,051 --> 00:56:56,591
wallpaper.

2059
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,060
I wouldn't do it on it against the wall.

2060
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,810
It's like these crappy hotel walls that,

2061
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,170
can you see anything?

2062
00:57:02,171 --> 00:57:03,040
That would be sweet.

2063
00:57:03,041 --> 00:57:04,810
Retribution as if it was,

2064
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,200
let's say it was a hot hot August night
and you're staying in a bad motor lodge

2065
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,560
and the air conditioning.

2066
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,680
So on the Fritz and you're in like you're,

2067
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,210
you're in the south,

2068
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:21,000
you're in the deep south and you blow
your load and he'd go to do your Spiderman

2069
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:25,750
fling with it and it hits the
ceiling fan back in your eye,

2070
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:31,120
get pink eye and then you have to explain
to the doctor that's your own load

2071
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:32,890
that gave you the pink eye.

2072
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,120
I don't think that's enough.

2073
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:39,150
I think he deserves more what more
of a well deserved to get pregnant.

2074
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:41,050
I had payback the other day.

2075
00:57:41,051 --> 00:57:41,890
So yeah,

2076
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:42,820
I don't even want to talk about,

2077
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:43,750
it's fucking disgusting.

2078
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,760
Let's just say that I came and then
somehow it ended all my lip snowball.

2079
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:51,550
It's kind of snow.

2080
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,180
The joke,

2081
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,020
she thought it was funny.

2082
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:54,040
What?

2083
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,873
Nothing.

2084
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,750
You came,

2085
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:56,440
I can't just,

2086
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:58,270
I was getting a blow
job came in her mouth.

2087
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:02,240
Then like she later she
was kissing me on my lip.

2088
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:03,803
She thought it was funny.

2089
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:05,733
Oh,

2090
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,030
that's rude.

2091
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:08,380
I can't even watch the,

2092
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,373
uh,

2093
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:10,610
when the guy,

2094
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,170
you know,

2095
00:58:11,170 --> 00:58:12,850
are going at the same time.

2096
00:58:12,851 --> 00:58:13,684
Like I,

2097
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:15,190
I mean I can watch it,

2098
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:15,731
don't get me wrong,

2099
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:16,001
but what,

2100
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:16,361
I mean,

2101
00:58:16,361 --> 00:58:19,990
this is the other dude's Jizz on you.

2102
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,853
I,

2103
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,220
I feel like not enough is made
of that in the porn world.

2104
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:27,760
Like the boat just bust the load on
her tits and then they'll both be like

2105
00:58:27,761 --> 00:58:29,070
slapping their dick on it.

2106
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:29,440
It's like,

2107
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:29,621
Whoa,

2108
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:29,801
Whoa,

2109
00:58:29,801 --> 00:58:30,011
Whoa,

2110
00:58:30,011 --> 00:58:32,500
buddy makes it lower loads here.

2111
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:33,731
That's bad.

2112
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:37,060
But how about when they're doing the
double vagina thing and they've got to

2113
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:39,130
Dick's inside the pussy at the same time?

2114
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:39,511
I'm like,

2115
00:58:39,511 --> 00:58:40,271
at that point in time,

2116
00:58:40,271 --> 00:58:41,620
you're not even fucking a woman anymore.

2117
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:44,860
You using her vagina as a container
so that you can rub dicks.

2118
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:45,380
Right.

2119
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:46,020
What you're doing.

2120
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:46,570
Yeah,

2121
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:49,090
you might as well just to get a
tennis ball can and leave it up.

2122
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:51,410
Get your buddy and stuff is cocking it.

2123
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:52,930
Fucking pussy feels awesome,

2124
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:53,081
bro.

2125
00:58:53,081 --> 00:58:54,700
I don't even feel your
balls against my balls.

2126
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,770
It's just as pussy that
feel so awesome man.

2127
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,131
You know,

2128
00:58:57,131 --> 00:58:59,200
I think it takes a lot
to be a male porn star.

2129
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:00,130
I think that's the whole thing.

2130
00:59:00,131 --> 00:59:00,380
Like,

2131
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:00,880
I'm sorry,

2132
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,601
it takes a lot.

2133
00:59:01,601 --> 00:59:02,321
It takes math,

2134
00:59:02,321 --> 00:59:03,154
it takes abuse.

2135
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,330
Takes a stepfather.

2136
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,130
I was talking to one guy and I was like,

2137
00:59:06,190 --> 00:59:07,180
I don't want to say these names,

2138
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:08,620
but I was talking to
this one guy and he goes,

2139
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:09,820
I was asking,

2140
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,040
have you ever met this other porn star?

2141
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:12,370
And he goes,

2142
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:12,791
yeah,

2143
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:14,660
but you know something's
weird about him on the boy.

2144
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:14,980
He goes,

2145
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,310
he has his own sewing machine
and he always so lucid his
own clothes and I don't

2146
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:18,461
know,

2147
00:59:18,461 --> 00:59:19,750
it's something weird and I'm like,

2148
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:20,584
wait a second,

2149
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:21,603
what's on here?

2150
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,620
It's weird,

2151
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,380
but that's what's weird is
that he has a sewing machine.

2152
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,431
You asshole.

2153
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:29,750
You like making clothes,

2154
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:30,470
you know,

2155
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:30,741
like,

2156
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:31,041
you know,

2157
00:59:31,041 --> 00:59:32,480
I hear about Adam Kroll all the time.

2158
00:59:32,481 --> 00:59:33,860
I don't is a fucking carpenter.

2159
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:37,220
You Know Adam Carolla does like his own
extensions on his house and Shit and you

2160
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:38,300
do all kinds of crazy work,

2161
00:59:38,301 --> 00:59:39,134
right?

2162
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,360
Nobody ever says the
fuck is wrong with him,

2163
00:59:41,361 --> 00:59:41,930
man.

2164
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:42,920
What does he saw an shit?

2165
00:59:42,921 --> 00:59:43,101
No.

2166
00:59:43,101 --> 00:59:43,491
People go,

2167
00:59:43,491 --> 00:59:43,761
wow,

2168
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:44,511
that's pretty bad.

2169
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:46,340
Ass Guy makes his own cabinets.

2170
00:59:46,430 --> 00:59:47,450
That's pretty fucking cool.

2171
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,680
But you hear a guy makes his own clothes
like fuck you fucking queer you making

2172
00:59:51,681 --> 00:59:52,191
your own clothes.

2173
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,720
We got rhinestones all over to,

2174
00:59:53,721 --> 00:59:57,020
we got shiny shit on your clothes
so you're going to track some cock,

2175
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,390
you know like what is that?

2176
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,140
We all wear clothes.

2177
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,030
What is wrong with making clothes?

2178
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:02,301
I know.

2179
01:00:02,301 --> 01:00:03,650
The weird part was like having to be like,

2180
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:03,951
yeah,

2181
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:04,610
that is weird.

2182
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:05,900
I kind of come close.

2183
01:00:05,901 --> 01:00:06,950
You have clothes from,

2184
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,210
have a clothing line.

2185
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:09,080
Then you're cool again,

2186
01:00:11,270 --> 01:00:13,310
11 year old Asians to make it for you.

2187
01:00:13,311 --> 01:00:14,180
Then it's hip again.

2188
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:14,571
By the way,

2189
01:00:14,571 --> 01:00:17,390
the higher primary Joey Diaz
shows a shirts are sold out.

2190
01:00:17,391 --> 01:00:18,590
They sold out instantly,

2191
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,910
literally within an hour.

2192
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:22,070
All of them sold out except for small.

2193
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,540
We don't have small fans,

2194
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:25,850
so we need more Guido's.

2195
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,510
More guys were in small shirts.

2196
01:00:27,511 --> 01:00:28,344
I don't really,

2197
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:31,010
I got completely obsessed
world or new ones immediately.

2198
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,650
I got completely obsessed with
this guy named Louis Wayne.

2199
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:35,630
Have you guys heard of who this is?

2200
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:39,860
An artist from the late 18 hundreds early
19 hundreds and the reason why I got

2201
01:00:39,861 --> 01:00:43,110
obsessed with him is that he's
just spit is cheers at the Camden.

2202
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,580
He started getting
schizophrenia and so he,

2203
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:48,021
he he,

2204
01:00:48,021 --> 01:00:48,651
his whole thing is,

2205
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:52,760
he used to draw cats and he's your classic
cats for like the New York Post or I

2206
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:53,480
don't know why,

2207
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:54,313
some news famous Sainsbury,

2208
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:58,460
but he starts to draw cats
in and he started getting
really sick and all his cat

2209
01:00:58,461 --> 01:01:03,461
pictures started turning into psychedelics
DMT art like you know that I've seen

2210
01:01:04,101 --> 01:01:05,060
that Alex Gray.

2211
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,830
Yeah.

2212
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,061
Yeah,

2213
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:06,800
I've seen those.

2214
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:07,130
Yeah.

2215
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,090
It's so interesting.

2216
01:01:08,091 --> 01:01:09,650
So I just got obsessed with this guy.

2217
01:01:09,651 --> 01:01:10,700
It's very interesting to,

2218
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,030
if you go online and look at
it and there's a book also,

2219
01:01:13,230 --> 01:01:14,560
it's interesting you talk about that.

2220
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,870
The neurochemistry of the brain is
some fascinating shit and I've been

2221
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:21,470
experimenting recently with Nootropics,

2222
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:21,871
you know,

2223
01:01:21,871 --> 01:01:22,060
uh,

2224
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,620
different things that
stimulate the mind like oh,

2225
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,540
different supplements for the mind.

2226
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:29,990
And we just started creating what
we've talked about this on the show

2227
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,160
information on it.

2228
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,470
You want me to tell another
Kareem Abdul Jabbar?

2229
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,120
It doesn't matter.

2230
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:39,320
Uh,

2231
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:39,621
we'll,

2232
01:01:39,621 --> 01:01:41,000
I'll have all the information available,

2233
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:41,990
but I started taking it,

2234
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:43,240
but all the people that are taking wheat,

2235
01:01:43,490 --> 01:01:45,840
we've compounded all the best nootropics,

2236
01:01:45,890 --> 01:01:48,350
put it together and we're going to
release it because nobody has like a,

2237
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,290
a brain formula go really
solid brain formula.

2238
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,910
But all these people that are taking it,

2239
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:54,350
they're saying their memories incredible.

2240
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:57,260
The remembering all this weird shit from
childhood and apparently if you take it

2241
01:01:57,261 --> 01:01:58,100
right before you go to bed,

2242
01:01:58,101 --> 01:02:00,590
you have fucking insane dreams.

2243
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,880
I started taking it two days ago.

2244
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:02,570
You started hanging?

2245
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:03,200
Yeah,

2246
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,980
I should do it.

2247
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:05,030
I do it when I wake up.

2248
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:05,211
I should,

2249
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:06,490
I guess I should do it when I got to go,

2250
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,120
wait a minute.

2251
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,920
It's not a really a selling
point because I feel like,

2252
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,001
yeah,

2253
01:02:11,001 --> 01:02:14,660
cause like when I wake up at the best
night's sleep I get is when people got

2254
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:14,811
like,

2255
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:15,630
what'd you dream about it?

2256
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:15,920
I'm like,

2257
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,753
Eh,

2258
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,673
I don't like this.

2259
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,200
I

2260
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,240
crazy dreams always.

2261
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,590
My dreams are never,

2262
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,840
my dreams are rarely good.

2263
01:02:25,230 --> 01:02:28,830
I have no dreams of grand chair there.

2264
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:30,360
And they're not even horror.

2265
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:33,000
They're not even horror
stories or just sort of boring.

2266
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:37,920
Like I have these super
mundane boring dreams.

2267
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:40,800
About half of them are
about high school football.

2268
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:42,900
I can't find my,

2269
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:44,820
my equipment and I never,

2270
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:45,900
I never get in the game.

2271
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:48,420
And the other ones are
just sort of Shitty,

2272
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:48,990
you know,

2273
01:02:48,990 --> 01:02:50,370
jobs where it's like,

2274
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:51,870
one of my dreams will be like,

2275
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,230
oh you have this really shitty job
and it sucks and your board and then,

2276
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:59,160
oh there's this hot chick who works at
the law firm that you're working at.

2277
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,210
And then,

2278
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:01,430
but you never fucked her.

2279
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,090
And it's like nothing ever happens.

2280
01:03:03,270 --> 01:03:05,460
And then I actually wake up and I go,

2281
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,121
Oh man,

2282
01:03:06,121 --> 01:03:06,954
I'm glad.

2283
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:08,340
Like I'm glad to be awake.

2284
01:03:08,341 --> 01:03:09,630
Like whereas a lot of people,

2285
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,260
well they wake up and they're not the
habit won the Heisman trophy and you know,

2286
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:20,130
they're not fucking Lindsay
Lohan and they're disappointed.

2287
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,450
I wake up and go,

2288
01:03:21,451 --> 01:03:25,950
I'm not working at a circle k and
driving my old Mazda pickup truck.

2289
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:27,330
I'm actually relieved.

2290
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:30,270
So I have these dreams
that don't set me up.

2291
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,760
We are never had a dream
where I feel good like a,

2292
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,161
I'm a,

2293
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:36,390
I'm better in my dream
that I am in real life,

2294
01:03:36,391 --> 01:03:37,201
that I've done things.

2295
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:38,250
You guys need to rent.

2296
01:03:38,251 --> 01:03:39,720
The action movie of dreams.

2297
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:42,030
It's a nicotine patches,

2298
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:42,301
you know,

2299
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:44,430
for to cue you rent the action movie.

2300
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,530
This is like renting an
action movie for dreams.

2301
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,600
Take I take a nicotine patch,

2302
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:50,070
put it on right before you go to bed.

2303
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,250
You'll have fuckings Arnold
Schwarzenegger style dreams.

2304
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:57,300
I mean just fucking insane mysteries
and action and helicopters.

2305
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,583
Nicotine Patch,

2306
01:03:58,860 --> 01:03:59,580
the nicotine that ah,

2307
01:03:59,580 --> 01:03:59,910
your,

2308
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:01,560
your nicotine receptors in your head.

2309
01:04:01,590 --> 01:04:03,420
Stay awake to suck in the nicotine.

2310
01:04:03,421 --> 01:04:07,140
So your brains a little bit more awake
than normal when you're dreaming.

2311
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,130
That's why it says on the box,

2312
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:08,821
don't take it,

2313
01:04:08,821 --> 01:04:09,640
but it's,

2314
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,520
it's don't take it at
night because of that.

2315
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,620
Because of that nightmares or dreams.

2316
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:14,430
It's not nightmares.

2317
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,870
It's fucking awesome shit.

2318
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:20,760
Like fucking elevator dean is a confidence
inspiring sort of nicotine is a,

2319
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:21,660
is a good drug.

2320
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,193
Be A,

2321
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:27,040
I would lobby the FDA to put two types of,

2322
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,380
don't take this stickers,

2323
01:04:29,381 --> 01:04:29,710
right?

2324
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:34,710
There's the one where it says do not
take this with alcohol cause your liver

2325
01:04:35,141 --> 01:04:38,770
will explode and then there's don't
take it with alcohol because you'll

2326
01:04:38,771 --> 01:04:39,760
supersize it.

2327
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:42,070
Like essentially put it into sixth gear.

2328
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:46,390
Now the ones where I can wash it down
with a couple of beers and feel that much

2329
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:47,530
better about myself.

2330
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,880
I'm all for that.

2331
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:50,700
But I don't want my liver to explode.

2332
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:51,020
Right.

2333
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:55,480
Did you guys just have one sticker that
says no alcohol and I want to know which

2334
01:04:55,481 --> 01:04:57,130
one because all decide,

2335
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:01,090
once I get that information I feel the
same way with the don't take at night.

2336
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:01,590
Right?

2337
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,080
Yeah.

2338
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,500
It highly recommend it though.

2339
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:03,780
Okay.

2340
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,040
So what level do you take?

2341
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:07,230
Like I always go with
level one and what it does.

2342
01:05:07,231 --> 01:05:08,880
I don't do level one level.

2343
01:05:08,881 --> 01:05:12,330
Once you're f your first week of
quitting smoking is the most strong.

2344
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:12,750
Yeah.

2345
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:14,280
I mean if you just want to have it good,

2346
01:05:14,281 --> 01:05:16,640
but I don't smoke so
what would I go with it?

2347
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:17,920
Just level one really?

2348
01:05:17,921 --> 01:05:18,130
Yeah,

2349
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,630
fucking that's eating like
a quarter of mushrooms,

2350
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:24,330
really strong and dreams of drinks,

2351
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:24,840
man.

2352
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,340
Six hours of feeling like
a Xan Claude van Damme.

2353
01:05:28,370 --> 01:05:29,500
It's tobacco.

2354
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:33,520
People don't understand tobacco in
itself or nicotine in itself is not a bad

2355
01:05:33,521 --> 01:05:37,240
drug and in fact it's shown to have some
benefits as far as like people's hearts

2356
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,250
and actually it was like
good for your heart,

2357
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:42,670
but the real problem comes with smoking
it and the real problem comes with the

2358
01:05:42,671 --> 01:05:47,671
599 these government comments that have
allowed these people to put 599 fucking

2359
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,790
different additives inside cigarettes.

2360
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,670
Most of them designed just
to make it more addictive.

2361
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:56,470
If you look at that movie inside job,

2362
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:57,310
that Russell Crowe movie,

2363
01:05:57,311 --> 01:06:00,890
which was based on a true story or what
does the inside man and when it's close,

2364
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:01,540
yeah,

2365
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:02,373
whatever it was.

2366
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:04,680
That's what Jack those.

2367
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:05,680
Yeah,

2368
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,710
that was a great movie with
Jack [inaudible] Chemicals.

2369
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:12,610
I'm flashing forward here
at Joe and flashing forward

2370
01:06:13,690 --> 01:06:15,010
about 30 years.

2371
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:17,590
I'm seeing the kids
grown out of the house.

2372
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:18,581
Wife's long.

2373
01:06:18,581 --> 01:06:19,300
God,

2374
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:19,690
you're,

2375
01:06:19,690 --> 01:06:20,620
you're up now.

2376
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:24,520
You're in the hills like year and the
year in the hills of Colorado at this

2377
01:06:24,521 --> 01:06:24,910
point.

2378
01:06:24,910 --> 01:06:26,920
Podcast still going strong,

2379
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:27,940
strong this time.

2380
01:06:27,970 --> 01:06:28,630
Art Bell,

2381
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,730
several million listeners,

2382
01:06:30,731 --> 01:06:31,780
mostly in China,

2383
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:34,120
but all over the place
and now you're sitting,

2384
01:06:35,460 --> 01:06:37,600
you're sitting there with a full beard,

2385
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,470
like a full gray beard
and some sort of bizarre,

2386
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,553
um,

2387
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:44,230
marijuana trips.

2388
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:45,251
Sabaah story,

2389
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:47,140
like all day slow drip thing,

2390
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:49,540
constant buzz.

2391
01:06:49,990 --> 01:06:54,220
And you're going off about
precedent beaver and it just,

2392
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:57,250
it just up there on your pulpit
with the crazy beers you're wearing.

2393
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,840
You're wearing like three sets of glasses.

2394
01:06:58,841 --> 01:07:02,980
Like you have to buy focal painting
down the sunglasses up on your head,

2395
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:04,330
your cats on your lap,

2396
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:07,030
and you're just waxing
crazy poetic old man.

2397
01:07:07,210 --> 01:07:07,661
Talk,

2398
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:09,250
lashing out against the government.

2399
01:07:09,251 --> 01:07:10,120
You're right next to me,

2400
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:11,670
mother fucker sitting right.

2401
01:07:11,671 --> 01:07:13,720
And you're sitting right across
the aisle and you're like,

2402
01:07:13,721 --> 01:07:16,360
I'm so glad I got out of California.

2403
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:16,900
Oh,

2404
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,733
now building.

2405
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:21,160
That's hilarious.

2406
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:21,580
Yeah.

2407
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:24,550
You ever wonder what the fuck are you
going to be like when you be 60 or 70

2408
01:07:24,551 --> 01:07:24,881
years old?

2409
01:07:24,881 --> 01:07:25,720
Do you ever look ahead?

2410
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:27,540
Did you try to live in the moment?

2411
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,513
Uh,

2412
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:29,850
I don't look ahead,

2413
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:31,890
nor do I like live in the moment.

2414
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:33,450
I just sorta am.

2415
01:07:33,451 --> 01:07:35,250
I'm just an atheist who is,

2416
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,020
you know,

2417
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,940
I have the things that I enjoy.

2418
01:07:37,941 --> 01:07:39,390
I have the people that I enjoy.

2419
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,920
I do what I do just
because that's what I do.

2420
01:07:43,921 --> 01:07:44,311
Like I,

2421
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:44,641
you know,

2422
01:07:44,641 --> 01:07:47,610
I don't really think
about things too much.

2423
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:48,000
Uh,

2424
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:48,770
I just,

2425
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,100
I just think about things a lot though.

2426
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:50,550
When you mean,

2427
01:07:50,550 --> 01:07:50,940
well,

2428
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:51,451
what I mean,

2429
01:07:51,451 --> 01:07:51,750
this is,

2430
01:07:51,750 --> 01:07:52,230
I don't,

2431
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:56,640
I don't plot the future per se.

2432
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,250
I just essentially move through it and,

2433
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:00,691
and I,

2434
01:08:00,691 --> 01:08:05,691
I tried to do it as efficiently
as possible and I try to
maximize whatever I can

2435
01:08:06,121 --> 01:08:10,200
maximize and what are my interests are
and financially and that sort of thing.

2436
01:08:10,201 --> 01:08:11,760
But in general,

2437
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:12,823
uh,

2438
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:14,760
I'm not a plotter.

2439
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:16,280
I'm like not a down the road

2440
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:16,431
or,

2441
01:08:16,431 --> 01:08:16,791
you know,

2442
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:17,740
I have kids,

2443
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:18,201
you know,

2444
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:20,060
as far as college goes,

2445
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,571
screw him.

2446
01:08:20,571 --> 01:08:21,231
They're on their own.

2447
01:08:21,231 --> 01:08:21,460
Like,

2448
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,790
like they'll be fine.

2449
01:08:22,791 --> 01:08:25,370
They'll either want to go to
college or they won't go to college.

2450
01:08:25,610 --> 01:08:28,100
They'll either be curious
so they won't be curious.

2451
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:32,300
Hopefully there'll be curious and I'll
figure out a way to pay for some of it,

2452
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:33,740
but they can pay for some of it too.

2453
01:08:33,741 --> 01:08:34,790
Like I'm not one of those,

2454
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,601
Oh my God,

2455
01:08:35,601 --> 01:08:38,480
what's going on next year guys?

2456
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:39,190
And uh,

2457
01:08:39,190 --> 01:08:40,220
I never have been.

2458
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:41,480
And you know,

2459
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:43,340
I've been willing to walk away from,

2460
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:43,641
you know,

2461
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,130
many endeavors just because I figured,

2462
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:46,341
well,

2463
01:08:46,341 --> 01:08:48,560
there's a new adventure around the corner.

2464
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:49,131
I don't,

2465
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:50,330
I don't look forward to it,

2466
01:08:50,331 --> 01:08:51,800
but I don't fear it either.

2467
01:08:51,801 --> 01:08:53,240
It's just there as a,

2468
01:08:53,241 --> 01:08:57,320
as it was for millions of other
people and it is for millions today.

2469
01:08:57,370 --> 01:08:57,521
Well,

2470
01:08:57,521 --> 01:08:57,761
you,

2471
01:08:57,761 --> 01:08:58,361
like I said,

2472
01:08:58,361 --> 01:09:01,540
you were the first guy to jump into
this whole podcast thing and you,

2473
01:09:01,541 --> 01:09:01,841
you know,

2474
01:09:01,841 --> 01:09:03,730
you went right at it right away.

2475
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,640
What was your thinking like
after your radio show was done?

2476
01:09:06,641 --> 01:09:10,150
I know you were real frustrated by your
whole experience doing that radio show

2477
01:09:10,530 --> 01:09:11,740
and then after it was done,

2478
01:09:11,741 --> 01:09:12,574
did you just say,

2479
01:09:12,610 --> 01:09:13,870
let's see where this goes?

2480
01:09:13,871 --> 01:09:16,270
Because the podcast
scene was not anything.

2481
01:09:16,271 --> 01:09:16,450
What do,

2482
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:16,631
I mean,

2483
01:09:16,631 --> 01:09:18,010
how long have you been
doing your podcast now?

2484
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:18,963
Oh,

2485
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:20,590
almost two and a half years.

2486
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:20,921
Yeah.

2487
01:09:20,921 --> 01:09:22,840
Coming up on two and a half
years and a half years ago.

2488
01:09:22,841 --> 01:09:23,051
Man,

2489
01:09:23,051 --> 01:09:24,460
who the fuck out of podcast?

2490
01:09:24,480 --> 01:09:25,250
You know?

2491
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:25,780
Well you were,

2492
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,860
I did yours.

2493
01:09:27,010 --> 01:09:27,371
Shit,

2494
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:27,851
I don't remember.

2495
01:09:27,851 --> 01:09:28,690
It was right after your,

2496
01:09:28,691 --> 01:09:28,961
your,

2497
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:31,030
your show would close
and I remember thinking,

2498
01:09:31,031 --> 01:09:31,570
wow,

2499
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,710
maybe I could do this.

2500
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,610
Maybe this is something.

2501
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,350
I was doing too many
different things at the time,

2502
01:09:35,351 --> 01:09:35,741
but I was like,

2503
01:09:35,741 --> 01:09:35,981
wow,

2504
01:09:35,981 --> 01:09:37,210
this was so much fun.

2505
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:38,251
Like how cool would it be?

2506
01:09:38,251 --> 01:09:40,960
They just have a place where you can just
sit down and shoot the shit with your

2507
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:42,220
friends and put that out.

2508
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,350
Like is it going to be real well,

2509
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:44,711
but you know,

2510
01:09:44,711 --> 01:09:46,230
what was your thinking after your show?

2511
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:46,661
Tell us,

2512
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:47,490
what was it like?

2513
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:50,500
Like what was the radio show like
when it was canceled and you know,

2514
01:09:50,501 --> 01:09:50,761
when the,

2515
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:53,230
the whole station we went to become
a Mexican station or something.

2516
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:53,830
What happened?

2517
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:54,341
No.

2518
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:57,050
Became a like brought me 40 assumption.

2519
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:01,360
You Lady Gaga Top 40 or 97.1
became a Mexican station.

2520
01:10:01,361 --> 01:10:01,930
Right.

2521
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:02,790
Um,

2522
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,730
the head have him talk.

2523
01:10:03,731 --> 01:10:04,564
I don't know.

2524
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:05,050
I still,

2525
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:05,890
I still think there,

2526
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:06,760
I don't,

2527
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:07,391
I don't know.

2528
01:10:07,391 --> 01:10:10,000
I know I still think they're
playing top 40 [inaudible] stuff.

2529
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:11,020
But who you know,

2530
01:10:11,021 --> 01:10:11,531
who cares?

2531
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:12,181
One or the other.

2532
01:10:12,181 --> 01:10:15,260
Both mind numbing when
one is mind numbing tip.

2533
01:10:15,261 --> 01:10:16,410
People speak Spanish.

2534
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:19,930
Know Mind numbing to people that speak
English but their mind fucking numbing

2535
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:20,350
music.

2536
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:20,711
Both,

2537
01:10:20,711 --> 01:10:21,544
both sides.

2538
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:22,010
The,

2539
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:22,870
the point is,

2540
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:23,710
um,

2541
01:10:23,710 --> 01:10:27,290
well what happened is they said to me in,

2542
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:29,350
in this sort of weird mind,

2543
01:10:29,351 --> 01:10:30,160
fuck,

2544
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,030
they said,

2545
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:32,441
hey,

2546
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:33,274
listen,

2547
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:34,570
we're going to fold the station now.

2548
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:36,130
Now for those who who,

2549
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,053
you know,

2550
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,110
don't know.

2551
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:39,010
Uh,

2552
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:41,410
I replaced Howard stern on the west coast.

2553
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:41,790
Uh,

2554
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:44,590
a guy named rover did it
in the Midwest and then,

2555
01:10:44,900 --> 01:10:45,270
uh,

2556
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:49,240
David Lee Roth did it in New
York when the change came about.

2557
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:49,790
Uh,

2558
01:10:49,790 --> 01:10:52,720
the David Lee Roth experiment
ended super frankness,

2559
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:56,770
super fast and the rover
thing and it fairly quickly.

2560
01:10:57,040 --> 01:11:00,610
And then I was around
and I was doing well.

2561
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:01,930
We were getting,

2562
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:06,990
I got bonuses in La toward the end and
I would always get bonuses and Vegas and

2563
01:11:08,201 --> 01:11:10,270
Seattle and Portland and stuff like that.

2564
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:11,080
We were,

2565
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:11,321
you know,

2566
01:11:11,321 --> 01:11:12,970
we had our ups and downs for sure,

2567
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:13,471
but it,

2568
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:15,630
it smoothed out and we're doing well.

2569
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,100
And they,

2570
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,731
and when I say,

2571
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:18,181
well,

2572
01:11:18,181 --> 01:11:20,370
I don't mean conquering the world,

2573
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:22,320
I just mean holding our own,

2574
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:24,330
getting good solid ratings and getting,

2575
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,520
getting occasional bonus
for being number one.

2576
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:28,920
And they flipped the format.

2577
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:29,641
They just figured out,

2578
01:11:29,641 --> 01:11:29,821
look,

2579
01:11:29,821 --> 01:11:33,240
why are we paying all these guys millions
of dollars to talk when we can just

2580
01:11:33,241 --> 01:11:36,780
play the four mentioned lady Gaga and
just make the same revenue and it's a

2581
01:11:36,781 --> 01:11:37,561
business decision.

2582
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:38,910
Like I'm completely cool with it.

2583
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,340
I understand like people are always like,

2584
01:11:41,341 --> 01:11:42,240
aren't you pissed off?

2585
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:42,481
Fuck.

2586
01:11:42,481 --> 01:11:43,590
Now it's third.

2587
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:44,281
It's their job.

2588
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:45,540
They paid and I had a contract.

2589
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:50,280
They paid me out the rest of the year for
not doing anything and it's completely

2590
01:11:50,281 --> 01:11:51,030
their prerogative.

2591
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:53,010
I get pissed off at personal stuff.

2592
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,160
I get pissed off when somebody
does something intentionally.

2593
01:11:56,161 --> 01:11:59,820
When the super selfish old
neighbor next door says,

2594
01:11:59,821 --> 01:12:02,010
I would rather watch jeopardy and peace.

2595
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:06,060
Then have a 150 people celebrate
the ringing of the new year.

2596
01:12:06,240 --> 01:12:07,950
That's a personal bullshit thing.

2597
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,300
When it's business,

2598
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:10,590
it's just business.

2599
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:11,603
I understand it.

2600
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:13,830
So they were going to flip it,

2601
01:12:13,831 --> 01:12:18,540
but they said to me two months before
they were going to blow up the whole

2602
01:12:18,541 --> 01:12:19,374
station.

2603
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:20,550
They said,

2604
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:20,970
uh,

2605
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:22,470
we're going to send you to New York.

2606
01:12:22,471 --> 01:12:26,460
You're going to the number one market
and we want you to take over in New York.

2607
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,593
So,

2608
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,620
but Shh,

2609
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:29,760
don't tell anybody.

2610
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:33,090
You cannot tell anyone
because nobody hears here,

2611
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:35,130
knows the radio stations being blown up.

2612
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:40,460
And the way radio works is they
don't give you two weeks notice.

2613
01:12:40,710 --> 01:12:41,220
They,

2614
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:42,510
you finish your shift,

2615
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,100
you walk off the air and the guy says,

2616
01:12:44,101 --> 01:12:47,040
go get that box with the weird
cardboard handles carved into it.

2617
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:48,000
You're leaving.

2618
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,870
And they do it for a reason.

2619
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:51,930
They don't want you going
back on the air going,

2620
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,520
fuck this station.

2621
01:12:53,521 --> 01:12:54,690
Fuck Jack Silver.

2622
01:12:54,691 --> 01:12:57,180
Fuck these cocksuckers these fucking guys,

2623
01:12:57,330 --> 01:12:58,163
you know,

2624
01:12:58,320 --> 01:12:59,153
they know it.

2625
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,130
And most djs are nuts and that's
what half of them will do.

2626
01:13:02,131 --> 01:13:04,710
So they told me two months in advance,

2627
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:05,753
we're flipping,

2628
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,400
you're going to New
York and we're flipping,

2629
01:13:08,490 --> 01:13:09,390
don't say anything.

2630
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:12,060
So it was this horrible two months for me,

2631
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:13,080
or it'd be like,

2632
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,400
it'd be like January.

2633
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,121
And,

2634
01:13:15,121 --> 01:13:15,390
uh,

2635
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:17,340
my producer would come up to me and go,

2636
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:17,971
oh,

2637
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:18,291
the,

2638
01:13:18,291 --> 01:13:22,740
the Wynn hotel wants us to come back
for March madness and do a special live

2639
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:24,060
show at the casino.

2640
01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:24,893
And I'd be like,

2641
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:25,750
Eh,

2642
01:13:25,750 --> 01:13:26,583
all right.

2643
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:27,151
And she'd go,

2644
01:13:27,151 --> 01:13:28,290
so you want to set that up?

2645
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:28,740
And I'd be like,

2646
01:13:28,740 --> 01:13:30,240
ah Nah,

2647
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,030
just hold off on that.

2648
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:33,211
Well,

2649
01:13:33,211 --> 01:13:34,110
they want an answer.

2650
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:34,561
All right,

2651
01:13:34,561 --> 01:13:35,251
well then fuck.

2652
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:36,120
I'd go ahead and do it.

2653
01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:37,200
Like what it was like,

2654
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,290
I knew everything was coming to an end
and we were talking about shit to do over

2655
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:42,510
the summer and stuff like that.

2656
01:13:42,511 --> 01:13:45,120
And so it was really weird
having these conversations.

2657
01:13:45,510 --> 01:13:49,200
It's like knowing you're going to get
divorced and your wife's making vacation

2658
01:13:49,201 --> 01:13:52,980
plans for the end of the summer and
you're going to serve her papers and two

2659
01:13:52,981 --> 01:13:55,170
weeks and that's tray and you're like,

2660
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:56,011
she's gone.

2661
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:58,830
You think ACO POCO would be awesome or
should we go to Honolulu and you're like,

2662
01:13:58,880 --> 01:13:59,713
whatever.

2663
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,730
It doesn't matter to me.

2664
01:14:03,330 --> 01:14:07,890
And so at the very end they said to me,

2665
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:08,640
uh,

2666
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:09,473
by the way,

2667
01:14:09,510 --> 01:14:14,340
you're not going to New York and we
are still blowing up the station.

2668
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:15,580
And I was like,

2669
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:15,911
oh,

2670
01:14:15,911 --> 01:14:16,450
all right.

2671
01:14:16,450 --> 01:14:18,220
So that was the end of that.

2672
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,300
You were going to go to New York?

2673
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,583
I didn't know.

2674
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:23,050
I had no idea at that point.

2675
01:14:23,051 --> 01:14:24,670
There are no jobs in radio.

2676
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:27,940
There's no way to monetize a podcast.

2677
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,380
I don't know what a podcast is.

2678
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:30,011
I'm not,

2679
01:14:30,011 --> 01:14:30,430
I don't,

2680
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,340
I'm not doing live shows
at that stage of my career,

2681
01:14:33,341 --> 01:14:38,320
I got nothing going on in a pretty big
monthly nut and not as big as the one you

2682
01:14:38,321 --> 01:14:39,310
toss at the wall.

2683
01:14:39,311 --> 01:14:43,120
For the folks who come in to the motel
six to enjoy shortly after you vacate

2684
01:14:43,121 --> 01:14:43,511
your room,

2685
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:44,344
you sick fuck,

2686
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,540
but still a pretty good size not right.

2687
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,720
So I'm sitting there wondering what to
do and my buddy goes podcasts and I was

2688
01:14:52,241 --> 01:14:52,421
like,

2689
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:56,190
well how the fuck is that
butter Donny at the warehouse?

2690
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,100
This is podcast.

2691
01:14:57,101 --> 01:14:57,401
And I said,

2692
01:14:57,401 --> 01:14:57,860
how's it work?

2693
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:58,240
He said,

2694
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,700
you speak your opinion and
you and I are the same way.

2695
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:01,623
We like,

2696
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:04,540
we like to hear ourselves
talk and we have opinions.

2697
01:15:04,541 --> 01:15:05,081
And so I said,

2698
01:15:05,081 --> 01:15:05,261
yeah,

2699
01:15:05,261 --> 01:15:06,094
fuck it.

2700
01:15:06,190 --> 01:15:06,880
And I,

2701
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,080
and I found out,

2702
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:09,041
I said,

2703
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:10,690
well how much you think
this is going to cost?

2704
01:15:10,691 --> 01:15:15,691
They said to you by two microphones and
a laptop and a Oh and then a little bit

2705
01:15:15,941 --> 01:15:17,680
for a bandwidth.

2706
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:18,251
And I said,

2707
01:15:18,251 --> 01:15:18,371
well,

2708
01:15:18,371 --> 01:15:19,000
how much?

2709
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:19,121
Oh,

2710
01:15:19,121 --> 01:15:19,481
it's like,

2711
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:19,841
I dunno,

2712
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:21,640
500 bucks a month or something.

2713
01:15:21,641 --> 01:15:22,210
And I was like,

2714
01:15:22,210 --> 01:15:23,043
oh,

2715
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:24,250
I guess I could afford that.

2716
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:24,940
Let's try it.

2717
01:15:24,940 --> 01:15:25,773
And then,

2718
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:29,350
then it was like nine grand for
the first month of a bandwidth.

2719
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:30,010
And I was like,

2720
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:30,910
Holy Shit.

2721
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:35,380
And so it got down to me spending like a
hundred grand out of my own pocket just

2722
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:40,381
to do it pro bono with the notion that
one day it might turn into a business.

2723
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:45,250
And that's really the
process we're in right now.

2724
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:45,950
Wow.

2725
01:15:45,950 --> 01:15:46,880
So how did you go about,

2726
01:15:46,881 --> 01:15:49,810
I mean you have like this giant employee,

2727
01:15:49,811 --> 01:15:50,720
his staff,

2728
01:15:50,721 --> 01:15:51,554
this huge,

2729
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,300
like a big room and all these employees
work in and people work in video

2730
01:15:56,301 --> 01:15:56,811
switches.

2731
01:15:56,811 --> 01:15:59,660
And how'd you go about finding all of
these people and putting everything

2732
01:15:59,661 --> 01:16:00,494
together?

2733
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:00,920
Uh,

2734
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,950
most of the people would hear
the podcast and just so like,

2735
01:16:03,951 --> 01:16:04,521
hey man,

2736
01:16:04,521 --> 01:16:07,940
I'm digging what you're doing and
I'm a whatever student and you know,

2737
01:16:07,941 --> 01:16:11,930
work for seven bucks an hour and could
I come down there and they just want to

2738
01:16:11,931 --> 01:16:12,980
be a part of something,

2739
01:16:12,981 --> 01:16:13,221
you know,

2740
01:16:13,221 --> 01:16:15,020
just in a sort of organic kind of way.

2741
01:16:15,021 --> 01:16:15,480
I'm sure

2742
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:16,380
got in your offers.

2743
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:20,070
If I didn't have a podcast in my house
that would be much more compelling put

2744
01:16:20,071 --> 01:16:22,860
the problem is it's in my house and on
some fucking weird off the internet.

2745
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:23,790
That's how I met this guy.

2746
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:27,860
Just saying you need to
others linger in there.

2747
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:28,694
Fuck it.

2748
01:16:29,230 --> 01:16:29,670
Yeah.

2749
01:16:29,670 --> 01:16:30,121
So,

2750
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:30,450
um,

2751
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:33,750
do you had no idea when you first started
doing it that it would ever become

2752
01:16:33,751 --> 01:16:34,411
what it is now?

2753
01:16:34,411 --> 01:16:38,580
You were just trying to figure it out
and just do it and see what it became.

2754
01:16:38,980 --> 01:16:42,910
I never have any ideas about
anything before they are,

2755
01:16:42,911 --> 01:16:43,840
what they are,

2756
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:44,640
you know,

2757
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:44,871
I,

2758
01:16:44,871 --> 01:16:48,250
I just set and I just
embark upon the journey.

2759
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,010
I know I don't really look
that far down the road.

2760
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:51,971
I mean,

2761
01:16:51,971 --> 01:16:53,800
I understand I'm not
going to walk off a cliff.

2762
01:16:53,830 --> 01:16:56,200
I trust that I'm moving
in the right direction,

2763
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:59,320
but I never have expectations.

2764
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:00,340
And you know,

2765
01:17:00,341 --> 01:17:01,480
I have no shins.

2766
01:17:01,481 --> 01:17:02,350
Well you know,

2767
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:02,950
let's,

2768
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:03,970
it's sort of like this,

2769
01:17:03,971 --> 01:17:04,641
it's sort of a,

2770
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:04,941
you know,

2771
01:17:04,941 --> 01:17:05,261
you know,

2772
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:07,660
I probably got it a lot from,

2773
01:17:07,680 --> 01:17:09,260
from building cars.

2774
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:12,680
Building is a process that
goes from shitty to good,

2775
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:15,560
which is to say the first
part of building is,

2776
01:17:15,561 --> 01:17:15,920
you know,

2777
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,920
permits and applications and you cut
and checks to the city for nothing and

2778
01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:24,590
inspectors and plan and Spec,

2779
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:25,160
you know,

2780
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:27,320
planned inspection and
all that kind of stuff.

2781
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,480
And it's nothing.

2782
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,220
It's just a bunch of money
and a bunch of papers.

2783
01:17:31,221 --> 01:17:32,054
You have nothing.

2784
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:35,420
And then you start demoing and
digging stuff up and you know,

2785
01:17:35,421 --> 01:17:37,730
digging footings and grade beams and blah,

2786
01:17:37,731 --> 01:17:41,510
blah blah and putting in rebar and
waiting for concrete and all that.

2787
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:42,351
But it's still,

2788
01:17:42,351 --> 01:17:42,920
it's nothing.

2789
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:43,940
There's no shape to it.

2790
01:17:43,941 --> 01:17:44,360
It's just,

2791
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,220
it's just a hole in the ground and you're
literally dumping money into this hole

2792
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:49,054
in the ground.

2793
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,330
But then at a certain point,

2794
01:17:50,331 --> 01:17:51,200
the cement drives,

2795
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:54,830
you strip away the forms and you
start to frame and we start to frame.

2796
01:17:54,831 --> 01:17:59,831
You get to actually see the shape of the
structure start to unfold before your

2797
01:18:00,381 --> 01:18:01,040
eyes,

2798
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,230
but it's still like it's wide open.

2799
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:06,020
It doesn't keep the cold out
or the heat in or anything,

2800
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,990
but you can start to
imagine about what it might,

2801
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:13,850
what it be like to put down that hardwood
flooring and to see all the cool top

2802
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:18,800
notch viking stoves and sub zero's
going into the kitchen and all that.

2803
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:20,390
Well that's the part you look forward to.

2804
01:18:20,391 --> 01:18:25,391
But if you're closing your eyes and
picturing your new Viking stove arriving

2805
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:29,690
when you're forming your slab,

2806
01:18:29,720 --> 01:18:31,340
you're going to fuck up your slab.

2807
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:37,180
Just focus on the form and know that
you'll get to the Viking one day,

2808
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,790
but for now you're just forming heavy.

2809
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,023
That is heavy.

2810
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,470
That's a heavy and correct.

2811
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:44,131
I mean that's a,

2812
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:44,641
you got it.

2813
01:18:44,641 --> 01:18:45,660
That's being in the moment.

2814
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:50,100
You sort of have an idea that it's
eventually going to come together,

2815
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,170
but right now you're just framing it.

2816
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,200
If it doesn't,

2817
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,063
it doesn't.

2818
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:57,190
But let me just form the
best whack and form today.

2819
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:57,630
Yeah.

2820
01:18:57,630 --> 01:18:59,490
I don't really plan things
out that much either.

2821
01:18:59,580 --> 01:18:59,791
I mean,

2822
01:18:59,791 --> 01:19:00,690
this plant did,

2823
01:19:00,691 --> 01:19:01,381
we didn't plan this.

2824
01:19:01,381 --> 01:19:03,060
Now we started this out on a laptop,

2825
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:05,730
literally was sitting right in front
of one of these and we had fucking

2826
01:19:05,731 --> 01:19:09,750
snowflakes coming down the
Ustream broadcast and we
fucked around with music and

2827
01:19:09,751 --> 01:19:10,800
all kinds of different things.

2828
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:11,731
And then,

2829
01:19:11,731 --> 01:19:11,910
uh,

2830
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:14,220
eventually we figured out how to
do it the way we're doing it now.

2831
01:19:14,221 --> 01:19:14,491
But it's,

2832
01:19:14,491 --> 01:19:15,390
it's still evolving.

2833
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:15,811
It's still,

2834
01:19:15,811 --> 01:19:15,991
it's,

2835
01:19:15,991 --> 01:19:17,210
it's a con,

2836
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:21,510
but for us it's been the best tool ever
for getting people to come into the

2837
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:22,020
clubs.

2838
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:24,210
And that's one of the things that
you've done to sort of monetize it.

2839
01:19:24,211 --> 01:19:27,120
You start doing live
podcasts and then live,

2840
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:27,954
stand up.

2841
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:30,030
And I remember when we
did the Improv together,

2842
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,170
the Irvine Improv,

2843
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,160
it was one of the first times,

2844
01:19:32,161 --> 01:19:36,690
I think we're the first time you had
ever done standup in like fucking 10 plus

2845
01:19:36,691 --> 01:19:38,700
years and killed.

2846
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:42,300
You went out there and killed and you did
it like you'd been doing it all along.

2847
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:43,890
It was thought that was pretty fun.

2848
01:19:43,891 --> 01:19:45,030
It was pretty fun to watch.

2849
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:46,050
Yeah.

2850
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,730
It always sort of maybe had it in me,

2851
01:19:47,731 --> 01:19:48,511
but I never,

2852
01:19:48,511 --> 01:19:49,620
I never pursued it.

2853
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:52,100
I remember talking to you when
we did Loveline fucking many,

2854
01:19:52,101 --> 01:19:52,761
many years ago,

2855
01:19:52,761 --> 01:19:53,580
and you were telling me,

2856
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:53,940
ahh,

2857
01:19:53,940 --> 01:19:55,490
stand up the audience.

2858
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:56,840
I didn't like the audience is,

2859
01:19:56,841 --> 01:19:57,381
I didn't like,

2860
01:19:57,381 --> 01:19:57,890
you know,

2861
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,540
you know,

2862
01:19:58,540 --> 01:19:59,331
I didn't like it.

2863
01:19:59,331 --> 01:19:59,961
I didn't like it.

2864
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:00,380
And I was like,

2865
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:00,680
wow,

2866
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,500
that doesn't make any sense to me because
you're funny and you like to rant on

2867
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:06,260
things like you just condense
that we should package it,

2868
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:06,921
put it on stands.

2869
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:07,920
I mean that it is what it is.

2870
01:20:07,921 --> 01:20:08,040
Like

2871
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:11,070
the rush of making 300 people plus,

2872
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:11,700
you know,

2873
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:12,241
laugh.

2874
01:20:12,241 --> 01:20:13,790
And when you're killing
in front of a large Carly,

2875
01:20:13,791 --> 01:20:15,150
like how could you not enjoy that?

2876
01:20:15,450 --> 01:20:20,370
It's weird because I get less out of
that then I get out of what we're doing

2877
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:21,330
right now.

2878
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:22,080
Really?

2879
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:22,441
Yeah.

2880
01:20:22,441 --> 01:20:26,390
Because that's an environment and,

2881
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,530
and you get the energy of the environment.

2882
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:33,810
But right now there's somebody with
ear buds in each ear and they're either

2883
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:37,140
walking their dog or they're walking on
a treadmill or they're walking their dog

2884
01:20:37,141 --> 01:20:38,070
on a treadmill.

2885
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,473
Fun.

2886
01:20:39,570 --> 01:20:41,760
And what we're saying is penetrating deep,

2887
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:42,600
you know,

2888
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,380
and that's more of a party where you
just kind of getting caught up into it

2889
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,860
versus a serious deep penetration.

2890
01:20:50,130 --> 01:20:55,130
And I'm really interested in just sort
of taken my ideas and inserting them into

2891
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:58,680
you more than I am sort
of entertaining you,

2892
01:20:58,710 --> 01:20:59,640
so to speak.

2893
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:00,570
You know what I mean?

2894
01:21:00,570 --> 01:21:01,260
That's interesting.

2895
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,000
So why did you start doing standup then?

2896
01:21:03,001 --> 01:21:03,834
Just to monetize?

2897
01:21:03,870 --> 01:21:04,620
I just did it for,

2898
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,120
I just did it for the money and I,

2899
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:06,990
and I did it.

2900
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:07,831
And you know,

2901
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:10,080
it's funny cause people do
that thing where they go,

2902
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:10,441
hey,

2903
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:11,490
why'd you do this?

2904
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:12,720
Or why did you do that?

2905
01:21:12,721 --> 01:21:14,070
And the answers for the money.

2906
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:17,700
But it doesn't mean I don't dig it.

2907
01:21:17,701 --> 01:21:19,830
And it doesn't mean especially,

2908
01:21:20,070 --> 01:21:20,760
you know,

2909
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,630
cause I've had this,

2910
01:21:21,631 --> 01:21:23,190
this problem in the past,

2911
01:21:23,191 --> 01:21:23,331
right?

2912
01:21:23,331 --> 01:21:23,611
I said,

2913
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:24,444
look,

2914
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:26,730
I'm going out to,

2915
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:27,061
you know,

2916
01:21:27,061 --> 01:21:28,110
Kansas City,

2917
01:21:28,111 --> 01:21:30,000
Milwaukee and,

2918
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:30,834
uh,

2919
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,370
one more place turn theater.

2920
01:21:32,430 --> 01:21:33,760
Oh Wiltern theater,

2921
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:34,710
uh,

2922
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:38,310
in May and so and so forth
and Portland and wherever.

2923
01:21:38,311 --> 01:21:39,061
And if someone said,

2924
01:21:39,061 --> 01:21:39,271
hey,

2925
01:21:39,271 --> 01:21:41,160
you want to come out
and do a show for free,

2926
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,540
the answer would be no.

2927
01:21:42,541 --> 01:21:43,350
So the US,

2928
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:46,020
the answer is I'm doing it for the money.

2929
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,153
I mean,

2930
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,121
sad,

2931
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,200
but it's true.

2932
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:49,800
It's not sad.

2933
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:50,910
Now here's the deal.

2934
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:55,200
It doesn't mean I'm not going
to fucking show up and kick ass.

2935
01:21:55,650 --> 01:21:56,481
As a matter of fact,

2936
01:21:56,481 --> 01:21:57,600
if I was doing it for free,

2937
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:00,360
I just pull up a stool and go,

2938
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:01,710
Charlie Sheen on your ass.

2939
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,970
I don't do that.

2940
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,590
I realize that everyone is,

2941
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:05,371
they're paid 40,

2942
01:22:05,371 --> 01:22:05,731
50,

2943
01:22:05,731 --> 01:22:09,210
60 bucks for a ticket and we're in a
theater and I'm going to fucking burn some

2944
01:22:09,211 --> 01:22:09,721
calories.

2945
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:14,460
I sweat through a t shirt for you guys
telling jokes and trying to amuse you for

2946
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:15,091
90 minutes.

2947
01:22:15,091 --> 01:22:15,924
So,

2948
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:16,980
um,

2949
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:19,200
would I rather be home watching my Tivo?

2950
01:22:19,201 --> 01:22:19,890
Hi.

2951
01:22:19,890 --> 01:22:20,723
Yes.

2952
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:22,500
Uh,

2953
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:23,940
am I doing it for the money?

2954
01:22:23,941 --> 01:22:24,774
Yes.

2955
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:27,720
Am I also doing it because I
just have the ability to do it?

2956
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:28,500
I mean,

2957
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,790
it comes easily to me.

2958
01:22:29,791 --> 01:22:30,421
It's not,

2959
01:22:30,421 --> 01:22:31,980
I'm not trying to sound like a Douche bag,

2960
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:33,210
but it's like a sport.

2961
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:33,630
You know,

2962
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:33,780
I,

2963
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,613
it's not a,

2964
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,760
it's not a grinder for me.

2965
01:22:35,761 --> 01:22:36,220
It's not a tool.

2966
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:37,350
It's polar opposite of what you,

2967
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,280
you do on the podcast and be,

2968
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:39,480
I mean,

2969
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,550
you can't say it comes easy to you.

2970
01:22:41,700 --> 01:22:42,780
What I mean you can,

2971
01:22:42,781 --> 01:22:45,990
but I mean the reason why it comes
easy to is because you're doing,

2972
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:46,620
it's like,

2973
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:47,670
it's like someone who,

2974
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:48,090
uh,

2975
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:53,090
does all this power lifting and
plyometrics and throw those medicine balls

2976
01:22:53,341 --> 01:22:54,480
around and then,

2977
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:54,961
you know,

2978
01:22:54,961 --> 01:22:56,880
and then someone teaches
you how to choke somebody.

2979
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:57,430
Right?

2980
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,660
Well,

2981
01:22:57,660 --> 01:22:58,950
Jujitsu came pretty easy to me.

2982
01:22:59,010 --> 01:23:01,440
Well that's cause you're a
fucking crazy physical specimen.

2983
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:02,110
You fight.

2984
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:02,911
And like with you,

2985
01:23:02,911 --> 01:23:06,340
when you're doing is you're
constantly and constantly piecing

2986
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,400
together ideas and constantly
pointing out things that don't,

2987
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:10,293
that stand up.

2988
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:11,840
You're right.

2989
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,470
And,

2990
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:14,430
and it is a muscle that gets exercise.

2991
01:23:14,431 --> 01:23:15,540
But either way,

2992
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,280
when we go do a show,

2993
01:23:17,281 --> 01:23:19,800
I'm not pacing around in my hotel room,

2994
01:23:19,890 --> 01:23:20,221
you know,

2995
01:23:20,221 --> 01:23:22,020
nervous ducking,

2996
01:23:22,021 --> 01:23:24,150
salvos of cheers at Brian throws.

2997
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:24,984
Like I,

2998
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:25,843
I'm Aye.

2999
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:26,743
It,

3000
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,890
it's easy for me when I do it.

3001
01:23:29,160 --> 01:23:31,080
And so you get paid well,

3002
01:23:31,470 --> 01:23:33,000
it comes easily.

3003
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,800
And why the fuck not,

3004
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:39,830
I've actually been enjoying it in
this weird sort of a curious k case of

3005
01:23:42,691 --> 01:23:46,740
Benjamin Benjamin buttons where
I've been going backwards.

3006
01:23:46,741 --> 01:23:46,981
You know,

3007
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:51,981
like I started off on TV
and I'm discovering my stand
up in my forties which is

3008
01:23:53,221 --> 01:23:56,150
insane because everyone else starts
off and stand up and get some

3009
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:56,750
away from it.

3010
01:23:56,750 --> 01:23:58,840
You've only been doing
standup for about a year now,

3011
01:23:58,841 --> 01:23:59,380
right?

3012
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,940
Yeah.

3013
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:00,630
Look about it.

3014
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:01,300
It's about a year.

3015
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:03,190
But you've already put
together a full hour,

3016
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:03,581
you know,

3017
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:04,480
and you're 90 minutes,

3018
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:06,940
90 minutes and you're out there crashing.

3019
01:24:06,990 --> 01:24:07,750
That's amazing.

3020
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:10,030
Well you writing this
stuff down or are you just,

3021
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:11,650
these are just rants and you'd categorize

3022
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,340
kind of the rants that
or categorize and a,

3023
01:24:14,370 --> 01:24:18,420
and I sort of have cues that helped me
figure out what it is I want to say.

3024
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:21,810
And then it doesn't come out
exactly the same every night either.

3025
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,060
But yeah,

3026
01:24:24,061 --> 01:24:24,541
it's,

3027
01:24:24,541 --> 01:24:25,200
it's,

3028
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:25,800
it's,

3029
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,510
I and I sort of mix and match.

3030
01:24:27,511 --> 01:24:32,511
I guess it'd be like a a jam band that
had a bunch of songs and change the set

3031
01:24:33,391 --> 01:24:38,391
list up on a nightly basis and maybe
they'd never get that good on one song,

3032
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:43,290
but yet they could free form if they had
to and they would never get boring for

3033
01:24:43,291 --> 01:24:47,010
them cause they're constantly mixing
the set up sort of sort of that.

3034
01:24:47,770 --> 01:24:49,030
I never do my,

3035
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:50,830
I said the exact same
way every time either.

3036
01:24:50,831 --> 01:24:50,921
I,

3037
01:24:50,921 --> 01:24:52,420
I mixed things up all the time.

3038
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:56,830
I know pretty much before I go on stage
what I'm going to get into right away,

3039
01:24:57,070 --> 01:24:59,230
but I always leave the door
open for something else.

3040
01:24:59,231 --> 01:25:00,280
I always leave the door open.

3041
01:25:00,281 --> 01:25:03,730
If I get on stage and for whatever
reason this thought pops in my head,

3042
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:07,690
I'll run with that and then eventually
get to the planned opening and then once

3043
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:09,190
I get the first bit out of the way,

3044
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:13,300
it's most more important to me
is to get that one solid chunk.

3045
01:25:13,301 --> 01:25:16,390
Just get that out tight and smash it.

3046
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:18,520
And then once that's out
and everyone's laughing,

3047
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:21,880
then we're going to go
wherever the ball's moving,

3048
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:23,020
the momentum's going.

3049
01:25:23,260 --> 01:25:24,490
Let's go wherever the fuck we want to go.

3050
01:25:24,500 --> 01:25:29,400
I'm the say way and it's like that first
20 minutes it just went to be solid.

3051
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:34,420
You want to get everyone on your side
and just get that first like 2025 minutes

3052
01:25:35,291 --> 01:25:35,860
and then it's like,

3053
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:36,221
all right,

3054
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:37,270
we've established this.

3055
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,360
Now we have some room for lateral move.

3056
01:25:40,450 --> 01:25:41,283
I,

3057
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,340
I'm really big on that
with the opening acts too.

3058
01:25:45,341 --> 01:25:46,240
I always tell them,

3059
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:47,260
when guys open up for me,

3060
01:25:47,261 --> 01:25:47,531
I say,

3061
01:25:47,531 --> 01:25:51,100
the best thing you can do out there
is don't fuck around the beginning.

3062
01:25:51,101 --> 01:25:51,461
Don't,

3063
01:25:51,461 --> 01:25:54,910
don't just don't try a new bid
out when you first get on stage.

3064
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:56,740
This is a cold audience.

3065
01:25:56,770 --> 01:25:57,340
Okay?

3066
01:25:57,340 --> 01:25:57,731
This is,

3067
01:25:57,731 --> 01:25:57,971
you know,

3068
01:25:57,971 --> 01:25:59,200
a lot of guys that are on the road,

3069
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:00,370
like I take guys on the road of me,

3070
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:03,410
they're used to doing sets in Hollywood
and they're used to going up and doing

3071
01:26:03,411 --> 01:26:04,340
10 15 minutes.

3072
01:26:04,341 --> 01:26:05,174
That's when there's a,

3073
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:05,541
you know,

3074
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,310
a host and a bunch of
other people on the show.

3075
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:07,630
Mike,

3076
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:08,690
this is a different experience,

3077
01:26:08,691 --> 01:26:08,870
man.

3078
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:11,330
These are people who don't know
who you are coming to see me,

3079
01:26:11,420 --> 01:26:11,770
so they're,

3080
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:13,760
they're willing to let you be funny,

3081
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:17,000
but you've got to go out
there and go tight right away.

3082
01:26:17,001 --> 01:26:18,380
You've got to gain their confidence.

3083
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:19,460
So most important thing,

3084
01:26:19,461 --> 01:26:20,780
if people don't know who you are,

3085
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:22,610
gain their confidence right away.

3086
01:26:22,611 --> 01:26:25,880
You got to do solid type
material right up front.

3087
01:26:25,970 --> 01:26:26,781
Get them laughing and go,

3088
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:26,961
all right,

3089
01:26:26,961 --> 01:26:28,070
this guy's a fucking pro.

3090
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:29,900
And then they relax and they settle in.

3091
01:26:29,901 --> 01:26:32,420
They have a smile on their
face and they're looking
forward to hearing and then

3092
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:32,731
you're,

3093
01:26:32,731 --> 01:26:34,450
you're smooth then smooth
sailing and everything.

3094
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:38,750
But if you start off chunky and fucked
up and then you got to Dell like this

3095
01:26:38,751 --> 01:26:39,231
fucking guy,

3096
01:26:39,231 --> 01:26:42,500
then you've got to constantly re
earn their respect through your,

3097
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,510
your struggle struggle
through your entire set.

3098
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,580
It's like going out on a first date by
shoving your copy through the mail slot.

3099
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:53,930
Save it for the third day.

3100
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:56,300
That's get the save it
for when she loves you.

3101
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,160
She knows your confidence level up.

3102
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:59,570
There's a video or a,

3103
01:26:59,571 --> 01:27:01,820
I watched it online but it's
apparently pulled from youtube.

3104
01:27:01,821 --> 01:27:02,690
But I saw it the other night.

3105
01:27:02,691 --> 01:27:05,210
It's a HBS talking funny.

3106
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:06,380
It's a Louis C,

3107
01:27:06,381 --> 01:27:07,730
k Ricky Gervais',

3108
01:27:07,940 --> 01:27:09,450
Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld.

3109
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,480
It's fucking great man.

3110
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:12,610
And it's one of the,

3111
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,461
and I'm going to,

3112
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:14,540
I'm pursuing this now.

3113
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,870
That's one of the reasons why I've always
thought that this podcast in and of

3114
01:27:17,871 --> 01:27:19,430
itself could be a television show.

3115
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:23,030
I was trying to pitch a show
based around the podcast,

3116
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:24,470
but the show that I was pitching,

3117
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:24,861
it was like,

3118
01:27:24,861 --> 01:27:28,670
it was like really produced and there
was all these little segments that we

3119
01:27:28,671 --> 01:27:29,241
would do every week.

3120
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:30,350
And then I thought about it and I'm like,

3121
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:31,340
I don't like that.

3122
01:27:31,341 --> 01:27:31,790
I'm like,

3123
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:36,410
I liked the idea of a podcast because I
liked the idea of people sitting around

3124
01:27:36,411 --> 01:27:39,050
and talking about
interesting shit and it's,

3125
01:27:39,051 --> 01:27:40,400
it's fun and amusing to watch.

3126
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,190
And it was proof positive
to me watching that talking.

3127
01:27:43,191 --> 01:27:47,210
Funny thing because it was just for comics
sitting around talking about standup

3128
01:27:47,211 --> 01:27:48,770
and it was fucking great man.

3129
01:27:48,950 --> 01:27:50,720
Especially Louis C K man,

3130
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:51,171
he,

3131
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:52,100
him and Chris Rock.

3132
01:27:52,130 --> 01:27:53,390
But Louis C K especially,

3133
01:27:53,391 --> 01:27:54,224
he's my,

3134
01:27:54,330 --> 01:27:54,800
um,

3135
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,570
my number one inspiration right now.

3136
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:57,321
That guy is,

3137
01:27:57,321 --> 01:27:57,590
uh,

3138
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,000
I love what he does.

3139
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,530
It mean the standup wise,

3140
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:01,610
material wise.

3141
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:03,110
My favorite guy is Stan hope.

3142
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,080
I think Stan hope is to me he's,

3143
01:28:06,440 --> 01:28:08,870
he's fucking fully out there.

3144
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:09,171
You know,

3145
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:09,471
he's,

3146
01:28:09,471 --> 01:28:12,920
he really is a wild fucking drunk
every night and he lives in Bisbee,

3147
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:17,360
Arizona and Doug Stanhope
when you first said Stan Hope,

3148
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,220
I thought there's a dude named Stan.

3149
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:19,850
Oh,

3150
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:20,260
um,

3151
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,260
hopes Branson.

3152
01:28:21,261 --> 01:28:22,580
It's doing stand up now.

3153
01:28:22,581 --> 01:28:22,911
Sorry,

3154
01:28:22,911 --> 01:28:25,520
I'm preaching to the converted
Stan hope to the choir.

3155
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:25,741
Uh,

3156
01:28:25,741 --> 01:28:26,031
yeah,

3157
01:28:26,031 --> 01:28:26,301
Doug.

3158
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:30,590
Stan hope cause you know Stan hope has
a fucking house and the window sills and

3159
01:28:30,591 --> 01:28:32,670
the outside of the house
are painted the Lop side.

3160
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:37,070
These fucking craziest houses like
bright yellow with green and shit.

3161
01:28:37,071 --> 01:28:37,780
And he said no,

3162
01:28:37,780 --> 01:28:37,950
he's,

3163
01:28:37,950 --> 01:28:38,420
he's,

3164
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:40,010
he literally is that guy.

3165
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:40,341
He's not,

3166
01:28:40,341 --> 01:28:40,731
it's not,

3167
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:41,720
it's not an act.

3168
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:42,554
He's now Fagan.

3169
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:44,480
He does all his shows and rock clubs.

3170
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:45,430
He sells all his,

3171
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:47,060
all of his tickets on Brown paper,

3172
01:28:47,061 --> 01:28:48,950
bag.com or whatever the fuck it is.

3173
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:50,030
Brown paper tickets.

3174
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:52,970
So everything is like
all produced in house.

3175
01:28:52,971 --> 01:28:54,410
Everything he does is all him.

3176
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,810
He doesn't go through any
other normal channels.

3177
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:58,160
He has all of his fans.

3178
01:28:58,161 --> 01:29:01,980
They show up and see him all over the
world and he goes on these fucking drunk

3179
01:29:01,981 --> 01:29:05,130
and Jaeger bomb rants and
they're fucking awesome.

3180
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,470
I mean his standup to me like Stan,

3181
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:11,190
his material to me as a fan
is my favorite to watch,

3182
01:29:11,191 --> 01:29:13,200
I think is Joey Diaz is stilled.

3183
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,160
I think the funniest guy and if I'm going
to watch a 10 minute set of anybody on

3184
01:29:17,161 --> 01:29:17,611
the planet,

3185
01:29:17,611 --> 01:29:20,910
I would watch Joey Diaz Cause
Joey Diaz when Joey Diaz crushes,

3186
01:29:20,911 --> 01:29:22,710
when he really fucking slams it home.

3187
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:23,000
Nobody,

3188
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:24,030
nobody's funnier than him,

3189
01:29:24,150 --> 01:29:25,890
but as far as like a long set,

3190
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,590
Stan hope is demand from eight to me.

3191
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:28,890
I enjoy his material,

3192
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:30,580
but I really enjoyed,

3193
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:30,890
yeah,

3194
01:29:30,890 --> 01:29:31,350
sorry,

3195
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,651
I'm sorry.

3196
01:29:31,651 --> 01:29:34,800
But I really enjoy Louis
C K I enjoy his materials.

3197
01:29:34,801 --> 01:29:34,981
Wow.

3198
01:29:34,981 --> 01:29:36,720
I really think he's a brilliant comedian,

3199
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,640
but I really enjoy his work ethic.

3200
01:29:38,641 --> 01:29:41,940
I really enjoy his philosophy on
stand up and how he breaks it down.

3201
01:29:41,970 --> 01:29:43,020
I find it as a comic.

3202
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:46,530
I find it so inspiring because he
throws away his whole act every year.

3203
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:47,820
He writes a whole act.

3204
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:49,380
He writes a full hour,

3205
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,690
hour and whatever the minutes
films it for whatever,

3206
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,770
showtime or Hbo,

3207
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:56,490
who the fuck wants to buy it and then
he throws it out and start from scratch.

3208
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:57,570
And because of that,

3209
01:29:57,571 --> 01:29:58,860
because everybody knows that he does,

3210
01:29:58,861 --> 01:30:02,130
then he's got this
massively loyal following.

3211
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:04,320
People can't wait to come and
see him because they know,

3212
01:30:04,321 --> 01:30:04,501
hey,

3213
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:05,700
we saw Louis last year.

3214
01:30:05,700 --> 01:30:07,050
You think he's going to be
doing the same material?

3215
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,831
Fuck no,

3216
01:30:07,831 --> 01:30:09,030
he's not going to be
doing the same material.

3217
01:30:09,031 --> 01:30:10,020
It's going to be all new.

3218
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:10,621
You know?

3219
01:30:10,621 --> 01:30:13,020
And maybe if you yell out bag of Dicks,

3220
01:30:13,110 --> 01:30:13,730
he'll do,

3221
01:30:13,730 --> 01:30:15,150
you know his bag of Dicks joke.

3222
01:30:15,151 --> 01:30:19,290
But for the most part this guy has got
90 new fucking minutes every 12 months,

3223
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:19,830
you know?

3224
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:20,341
And to me,

3225
01:30:20,341 --> 01:30:20,611
man,

3226
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:21,240
that's just,

3227
01:30:21,240 --> 01:30:23,160
I hear shit like that and I get fired up.

3228
01:30:23,161 --> 01:30:23,260
I,

3229
01:30:23,260 --> 01:30:23,581
I want to,

3230
01:30:23,581 --> 01:30:24,750
I want to sit in front of the keyboard,

3231
01:30:24,751 --> 01:30:25,531
I want to start writing.

3232
01:30:25,531 --> 01:30:25,801
You know,

3233
01:30:25,801 --> 01:30:26,430
it makes me like,

3234
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:27,750
it gets me jazzed up.

3235
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:28,710
I get tired.

3236
01:30:28,711 --> 01:30:31,140
Actually I never,

3237
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,240
I don't know anyone stand up act.

3238
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:34,920
I've never seen anyone stand up,

3239
01:30:34,921 --> 01:30:35,401
act like,

3240
01:30:35,401 --> 01:30:37,110
I don't know what the fuck's going on.

3241
01:30:37,111 --> 01:30:38,970
I to watch stand up.

3242
01:30:39,510 --> 01:30:40,550
I have no interest.

3243
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:41,830
Oh you're so it's,

3244
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:42,751
that's so funny.

3245
01:30:42,751 --> 01:30:43,110
Idiot.

3246
01:30:43,110 --> 01:30:43,943
I just watch,

3247
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:49,200
just watch like a Hitler and color and
then I just watch a ultimate factories.

3248
01:30:49,220 --> 01:30:49,440
I,

3249
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,630
I'm such a gearhead.

3250
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,580
I had no interest in comedy.

3251
01:30:54,460 --> 01:30:55,540
Well why don't top gear,

3252
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:56,950
why don't they fucking snatch you up?

3253
01:30:57,220 --> 01:30:58,053
Fire one of those.

3254
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:02,650
I'm working on a show for everyone
who was not Adam Ferrara as as we're

3255
01:31:02,651 --> 01:31:03,281
speaking,

3256
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:04,930
but it's weird.

3257
01:31:04,931 --> 01:31:09,070
I have such a gearhead brain that
the second I'm done doing any comedy,

3258
01:31:09,071 --> 01:31:12,400
my mind shifts to vintage
race cars and I don't,

3259
01:31:12,430 --> 01:31:13,570
I never think about comedy.

3260
01:31:13,571 --> 01:31:14,470
That's hilarious.

3261
01:31:14,471 --> 01:31:15,170
Wow.

3262
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:17,110
I don't dislike comedy or anything.

3263
01:31:17,111 --> 01:31:18,760
I just have no idea what's going on.

3264
01:31:18,761 --> 01:31:20,050
I don't know any of the comedians.

3265
01:31:20,051 --> 01:31:21,280
I've never seen their act.

3266
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:22,173
I crazy

3267
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:24,700
about like parallel thinking
though because of that.

3268
01:31:24,701 --> 01:31:27,400
I'd be worried about like going on
this long rant and then you find out,

3269
01:31:27,401 --> 01:31:27,551
oh,

3270
01:31:27,551 --> 01:31:29,530
that's on patent Oswald second CD.

3271
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:29,851
Oh,

3272
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:30,770
and it happens.

3273
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:31,160
I mean,

3274
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,150
it's got to happen.

3275
01:31:32,151 --> 01:31:32,331
Like,

3276
01:31:32,331 --> 01:31:32,571
I mean,

3277
01:31:32,571 --> 01:31:37,571
I was just watching SNL a couple of weeks
ago and Zach Galifianakis got up there

3278
01:31:37,851 --> 01:31:42,590
and he said something that I said on
the stern show and on my radio show,

3279
01:31:42,591 --> 01:31:43,100
you know,

3280
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:44,210
10 years ago.

3281
01:31:44,870 --> 01:31:48,200
And it was an almost
exact joke that I said,

3282
01:31:48,201 --> 01:31:50,480
I don't think he ripped
me off that motherfucker.

3283
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:51,680
Brody Stevens,

3284
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,990
you're gonna if you're gonna name him,

3285
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:55,520
I body spray,

3286
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:55,970
uh,

3287
01:31:55,970 --> 01:31:56,900
call the acts.

3288
01:31:56,901 --> 01:31:57,530
You're gonna,

3289
01:31:57,530 --> 01:31:58,130
you're gonna.

3290
01:31:58,130 --> 01:32:02,110
There's gonna be a joke about it
involves the black community and,

3291
01:32:04,270 --> 01:32:07,060
and I just happened to say
it on stern and you know,

3292
01:32:07,061 --> 01:32:08,440
when the ax came out,

3293
01:32:08,860 --> 01:32:12,430
but I don't think that Zach
Galifianakis Acus was listening.

3294
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:16,440
You could have very easily been this
SNL did it that those writers did it.

3295
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:17,560
There's a huge issue now.

3296
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:19,630
That was definitely his act.

3297
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:20,464
I could tell it was,

3298
01:32:20,740 --> 01:32:24,430
I could tell he was doing
his stand up really well.

3299
01:32:24,430 --> 01:32:24,641
Like,

3300
01:32:24,641 --> 01:32:26,020
you know that thing where you go,

3301
01:32:26,380 --> 01:32:26,711
look,

3302
01:32:26,711 --> 01:32:27,910
you want to host SNL.

3303
01:32:27,911 --> 01:32:29,110
I've never hosted SNL,

3304
01:32:29,111 --> 01:32:29,530
but you know,

3305
01:32:29,530 --> 01:32:33,940
host SNL and he say to a comedian and
instead of collecting a bunch of jokes

3306
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:35,590
from guys who don't
really know your voice,

3307
01:32:35,591 --> 01:32:36,071
you just go,

3308
01:32:36,071 --> 01:32:36,461
fuck it.

3309
01:32:36,461 --> 01:32:37,294
I'll do my,

3310
01:32:37,690 --> 01:32:41,320
I'll do a real familiar five
minutes of my act at the top.

3311
01:32:41,321 --> 01:32:42,154
I know it,

3312
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:44,890
I'm confident with it and then
we'll get into the rest of the show.

3313
01:32:44,891 --> 01:32:45,700
That's what it felt like.

3314
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,380
You have any desire to host SNL?

3315
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:48,341
No,

3316
01:32:48,341 --> 01:32:48,971
I don't.

3317
01:32:48,971 --> 01:32:49,930
I wish I did,

3318
01:32:50,350 --> 01:32:51,210
but uh,

3319
01:32:51,310 --> 01:32:55,390
I don't just say it seems like something
that doesn't have to do with cars or

3320
01:32:55,391 --> 01:32:56,500
building to me.

3321
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:56,921
Wow.

3322
01:32:56,921 --> 01:32:57,970
That's hilarious.

3323
01:32:57,971 --> 01:32:59,260
You're that much into it.

3324
01:32:59,290 --> 01:32:59,770
Did I?

3325
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:00,720
That's all I think about.

3326
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,990
I don't have any desire to,

3327
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:06,280
ost has an s and l to me is like
you got to eat 99 pounds of shit.

3328
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:08,590
Define that one juicy
steak at the bottom of it.

3329
01:33:08,680 --> 01:33:08,951
Right.

3330
01:33:08,951 --> 01:33:09,190
You know,

3331
01:33:09,190 --> 01:33:09,401
Oh,

3332
01:33:09,401 --> 01:33:11,550
this a juicy 16 ounce
t bone at the bottom.

3333
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:12,790
All the shit that I had to eat.

3334
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:14,170
I think it's more of a jelly belly,

3335
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:15,080
but his doctor,

3336
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:18,670
juror ever talk to you about addiction
of cars because that is an addiction and

3337
01:33:18,671 --> 01:33:19,181
it probably,

3338
01:33:19,181 --> 01:33:20,380
he's probably spending a lot of money on,

3339
01:33:20,490 --> 01:33:21,323
yeah.

3340
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:24,760
Diction and the interest that
you get enjoyment out of.

3341
01:33:24,761 --> 01:33:25,720
That's positive.

3342
01:33:25,870 --> 01:33:26,890
I think when people,

3343
01:33:26,891 --> 01:33:29,080
people throw around that
word addiction all the time,

3344
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:30,160
go ahead.

3345
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:30,993
Uh,

3346
01:33:31,500 --> 01:33:36,500
it's continuing in that activity in,

3347
01:33:36,571 --> 01:33:37,200
in the,

3348
01:33:37,200 --> 01:33:38,940
in the face of adversity.

3349
01:33:39,390 --> 01:33:40,530
And it's like,

3350
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,780
essentially if your wife says,

3351
01:33:42,781 --> 01:33:43,620
I'm going to leave you,

3352
01:33:43,621 --> 01:33:45,750
if you keep up with fill in the blank,

3353
01:33:46,110 --> 01:33:46,590
uh,

3354
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:46,980
you know,

3355
01:33:46,980 --> 01:33:48,930
if your boss says he's got to fire you,

3356
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:53,931
if you keep up with the booze drinking
or the pill pop under the is Dawson or

3357
01:33:54,001 --> 01:33:54,451
whatever,

3358
01:33:54,451 --> 01:33:55,500
whatever you're doing,

3359
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:56,360
uh,

3360
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:56,620
and,

3361
01:33:56,620 --> 01:34:00,510
and you keep doing it and then you lose
your job and then you get divorced and

3362
01:34:00,511 --> 01:34:01,410
then you lose your home.

3363
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:01,860
You know,

3364
01:34:01,860 --> 01:34:02,760
that's addiction.

3365
01:34:03,090 --> 01:34:03,690
Uh,

3366
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:04,980
if you can be,

3367
01:34:04,981 --> 01:34:07,290
and there's such things as
functional addicts as well,

3368
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:07,740
but the,

3369
01:34:07,740 --> 01:34:09,740
the real sort of definition is,

3370
01:34:09,741 --> 01:34:10,574
is,

3371
01:34:10,590 --> 01:34:12,330
is it ruining your quality of life?

3372
01:34:12,331 --> 01:34:12,511
Like,

3373
01:34:12,511 --> 01:34:13,870
are you for having trouble?

3374
01:34:13,900 --> 01:34:15,450
Do you like cars more than you,

3375
01:34:15,451 --> 01:34:17,250
like your job or your wife?

3376
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,750
That's a possible idea as well.

3377
01:34:18,810 --> 01:34:20,820
I do think about them more,

3378
01:34:21,210 --> 01:34:24,900
but I also understand
that it makes me work,

3379
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:25,440
right.

3380
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:29,850
Because need to carb and I went to
the garage and I went to whatever.

3381
01:34:29,851 --> 01:34:33,210
So I have to fund the habits just
like a junkie has to steel stairs.

3382
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:36,700
So whenever I was dating a girl in New
York is the first person that ever told

3383
01:34:36,701 --> 01:34:38,390
him that I had an addiction
and that was pool.

3384
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,280
I was playing pool
eight to 10 hours a day.

3385
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:40,721
Oh really?

3386
01:34:40,721 --> 01:34:41,290
Although me,

3387
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:41,470
yeah,

3388
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:42,480
I was playing in tournaments.

3389
01:34:42,490 --> 01:34:43,323
I've got a blouse.

3390
01:34:43,370 --> 01:34:46,340
I tore my ACL ligament and
I couldn't do taekwondo.

3391
01:34:46,341 --> 01:34:47,630
I couldn't kick box for a while.

3392
01:34:47,631 --> 01:34:49,370
How to get reconstructive
surgery the whole deal.

3393
01:34:49,550 --> 01:34:50,291
And uh,

3394
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:51,280
a buddy of mine,

3395
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:51,860
uh,

3396
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:55,340
and I started playing pool and it
started out just knocking balls around to

3397
01:34:55,341 --> 01:34:56,930
retards had played in a bar.

3398
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:57,801
No,

3399
01:34:57,801 --> 01:34:58,670
I didn't know how to play.

3400
01:34:58,910 --> 01:35:01,130
And then I met guys
that really could play.

3401
01:35:01,310 --> 01:35:02,810
And when you watch like real pool place,

3402
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:03,650
you watch them and he's like,

3403
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:03,801
oh,

3404
01:35:03,801 --> 01:35:04,910
it's about gambling,

3405
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,970
they're gambling and there's money on
the line and then it's about tournament.

3406
01:35:07,971 --> 01:35:08,361
And then you know,

3407
01:35:08,361 --> 01:35:13,361
you get to see pros play and I just
became obsessed with these balls moving

3408
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:15,150
around on this cloth and the,

3409
01:35:15,790 --> 01:35:20,420
the fact that you have to
figure out exactly how hard
to hit the ball to make it

3410
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:21,680
collide with this other bond.

3411
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:24,620
You've got to judge the angle and
it became a massive obsession.

3412
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:26,210
And the girl I was dating said,

3413
01:35:26,211 --> 01:35:27,390
you have to choose that.

3414
01:35:27,391 --> 01:35:28,970
You have to choose between me or pool.

3415
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:30,500
And I said rack them up.

3416
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,080
I had the same thing with foosball but

3417
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:35,691
it wasn't as bad.

3418
01:35:35,691 --> 01:35:36,460
But it was,

3419
01:35:36,460 --> 01:35:37,240
it was seven,

3420
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:38,073
eight.

3421
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:39,620
I love fucking food.

3422
01:35:39,621 --> 01:35:41,580
Do you have your own foosball table play?

3423
01:35:44,590 --> 01:35:48,130
Cause that's really all you're really
battling in life is your shell.

3424
01:35:48,290 --> 01:35:49,123
You know what I mean?

3425
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:49,951
I love food.

3426
01:35:49,951 --> 01:35:51,770
It's about foosball alone.

3427
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,040
What a concept.

3428
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,350
That's the only addiction that I've
ever had were somewhat well and pool.

3429
01:35:57,351 --> 01:35:57,621
Again.

3430
01:35:57,621 --> 01:35:58,431
When I was in Hollywood,

3431
01:35:58,431 --> 01:35:59,450
when I first came to la,

3432
01:35:59,451 --> 01:36:00,380
I didn't have any friends,

3433
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,080
so the first thing I started doing
is just entering pool tournaments.

3434
01:36:03,410 --> 01:36:03,681
I was like,

3435
01:36:03,681 --> 01:36:03,921
well,

3436
01:36:03,921 --> 01:36:05,650
now I know what I'm going
to do on Friday night.

3437
01:36:05,690 --> 01:36:05,931
You know,

3438
01:36:05,931 --> 01:36:07,160
if I don't have a set somewhere,

3439
01:36:07,161 --> 01:36:08,660
I'm going to go into a pool tournament.

3440
01:36:08,661 --> 01:36:11,900
We find a pool hall to play and then a
assessment and pulled me aside and said,

3441
01:36:11,901 --> 01:36:14,630
I think you're concentrating on
pool more than your own career.

3442
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:15,441
And it was true.

3443
01:36:15,441 --> 01:36:16,460
I wasn't writing any jokes.

3444
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,800
It was just fucking
practicing running out,

3445
01:36:18,920 --> 01:36:19,181
you know?

3446
01:36:19,181 --> 01:36:22,790
It was just going over patterns in my
head and watch an accu stats tapes of

3447
01:36:23,140 --> 01:36:26,900
classic Johnny Archer Versus Earl
Strickland matches from the early nineties

3448
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:32,000
dissecting his runout and plus it was
affecting his comic because I caught him

3449
01:36:32,001 --> 01:36:33,260
back in the day and he'd be like,

3450
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,740
all right,

3451
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:34,020
show,

3452
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:34,431
hey wait,

3453
01:36:34,431 --> 01:36:38,390
this dude's playing a Brunswick
with a pretty fast felt and it,

3454
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:40,790
and he goes for the
bridge and everyone else,

3455
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:41,953
I don't know.

3456
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:44,090
It felt it felt,

3457
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:44,571
felt,

3458
01:36:44,571 --> 01:36:45,650
revealed yourself.

3459
01:36:45,680 --> 01:36:46,221
Oh Man.

3460
01:36:46,221 --> 01:36:46,940
I gotta eat.

3461
01:36:46,940 --> 01:36:47,211
Yo,

3462
01:36:47,211 --> 01:36:47,690
what the hell?

3463
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:49,760
There's bathroom right there man.

3464
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:50,750
Go in there and take a left.

3465
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,130
It is a four 48.

3466
01:36:52,131 --> 01:36:52,964
You have to bolt.

3467
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:53,870
Yeah,

3468
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:54,231
I do.

3469
01:36:54,231 --> 01:36:57,440
I got to go try to beat my
warehouse and like the next,

3470
01:36:57,441 --> 01:36:58,130
uh,

3471
01:36:58,130 --> 01:36:59,120
25 minutes.

3472
01:36:59,420 --> 01:36:59,870
Okay,

3473
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:01,090
well you know what we're going to do,

3474
01:37:01,130 --> 01:37:02,990
we're going to pause it and
Brian and I will come out.

3475
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:05,660
We'll close it out because we were going
to do another half an hour because we

3476
01:37:05,661 --> 01:37:06,770
usually do about two hours.

3477
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:07,670
But uh,

3478
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,300
thank you very much for
doing the podcast here.

3479
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:10,143
And like I said,

3480
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:12,950
if it wasn't for you and
during your doing your podcast,

3481
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,210
we,

3482
01:37:13,210 --> 01:37:15,200
I probably never would have started
this thing in the first place.

3483
01:37:15,410 --> 01:37:16,940
You're one of my favorite
dudes to talk to you,

3484
01:37:16,941 --> 01:37:18,130
one of my favorite guys to,

3485
01:37:18,131 --> 01:37:19,730
to go on your show because you're,

3486
01:37:19,770 --> 01:37:23,600
you've always got a unique and interesting
perspective that I might not have

3487
01:37:23,601 --> 01:37:24,380
ever considered.

3488
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:24,750
You know,

3489
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:27,260
and there's not a lot of
guys like that out there,

3490
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:28,094
man.

3491
01:37:28,310 --> 01:37:30,200
Brian counts said about
you really is true.

3492
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:30,711
You,

3493
01:37:30,711 --> 01:37:35,711
you truly are the best at going on these
crazy rants that lead to conclusions.

3494
01:37:36,200 --> 01:37:37,580
Like I'll start rants off,

3495
01:37:37,640 --> 01:37:39,080
but then 10 minutes into
my rant I'd be like,

3496
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:40,790
what the fuck are we
even talking about man,

3497
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,020
fire up that vaporizer.

3498
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:42,883
You know,

3499
01:37:43,110 --> 01:37:43,521
you'll,

3500
01:37:43,521 --> 01:37:45,690
you'll actually come to
conclusions on them and uh,

3501
01:37:46,490 --> 01:37:47,720
you're very unique cat man.

3502
01:37:47,721 --> 01:37:50,240
The whole thing that you're doing with
standup and thing that you're doing with

3503
01:37:50,241 --> 01:37:50,961

3504
01:37:50,961 --> 01:37:51,440

3505
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:52,400

01:37:54,500 --> 01:37:55,110

01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:16,950
So Elle is a bitch.

It's tough to sell tickets and
al lights not fall or Portland.

3528
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,880
Find out cause there's so

I'll give you the numbers.

3537
01:38:29,290 --> 01:38:29,830
Like,

3538
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:30,191
you know,

3539
01:38:30,191 --> 01:38:31,180
the more theater,

3540
01:38:31,181 --> 01:38:31,631
you know,

3541
01:38:31,631 --> 01:38:34,240
you played the Moore Theater
in Seattle that holds,

3542
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:34,690
you know,

3543
01:38:34,690 --> 01:38:35,380
1800,

3544
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:36,640
1800 people.

3545
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:37,170
Uh,

3546
01:38:37,170 --> 01:38:40,270
the Wiltern holds 1800 people or so.

3547
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:45,720
And it's like the more sell out on a
Sunday night without really burning too

3548
01:38:46,061 --> 01:38:46,661
many calories.

3549
01:38:46,661 --> 01:38:46,811
You know,

3550
01:38:46,811 --> 01:38:47,644
I was like,

3551
01:38:47,710 --> 01:38:48,580
two weeks out,

3552
01:38:48,581 --> 01:38:50,350
we're 1400 tickets sold,

3553
01:38:50,351 --> 01:38:50,651
you know,

3554
01:38:50,651 --> 01:38:51,730
it's going to go clean.

3555
01:38:51,731 --> 01:38:52,564
As they say,

3556
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:53,460
it's good.

3557
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,293
We'll turn,

3558
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,671

3559
01:38:54,671 --> 01:38:56,860
850 tickets sold.

3560
01:38:56,980 --> 01:38:57,160
Yeah,

3561
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,240
we've got a month ago.

3562
01:38:58,241 --> 01:38:59,530
So probably be okay.

3563
01:38:59,531 --> 01:38:59,980
But it's,

3564
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:00,311
it's,

3565
01:39:00,311 --> 01:39:01,300
it's tough sledding.

3566
01:39:01,330 --> 01:39:05,590
Like you got to fucking get on
it and hit it and work it and go,

3567
01:39:05,591 --> 01:39:06,610
come on people.

3568
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:07,990
It's going to be a fun night.

3569
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:10,510

I grew up in La.

3626
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,310
