1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,140
This was just saying how big our recipes
here,

2
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,480
each other.
Hello.

3
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,720
Welcome to my weekly podcast.
I'm solo will shut the door so nobody 

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,001
interrupts Shazamm.
I'm back riding totally.

5
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:49,660
One hundred percent.
So while there to answer your questions,

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,930
talk to you.
See what the fuck's going on out there 

7
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:58,021
in the wild world of twitter.
Thank you everybody that tuned into the 

8
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:59,470
show we did yesterday and serious.
Uh,

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,480
I did a show for an hour yesterday on 
raw dog and I'm going to try to do that 

10
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,550
more often because it's fun and uh,
it's just,

11
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:10,120
uh,
it's fun just to do even for a goof,

12
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:13,620
but it's a great way to promote gigs and
uh,

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,550
you know,
get things cracking.

14
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,570
Not this weekend as in tomorrow and 
Saturday and Sunday,

15
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:21,880
but next weekend,
next Friday.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,970
I'm not exactly sure the date I'll be at
Gotham.

17
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:28,000
I think it's the 26th.
What's Today's date?

18
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,630
Seven days?
Yeah,

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,900
the 26th,
the 26th.

20
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,230
I'll be at Gotham for two shows in New 
York City.

21
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:39,880
I don't get to New York City very often.
I only go there like once every year and

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,680
a half,
two years and uh,

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,860
it's already almost sold out.
So if you want to get tickets,

24
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:46,210
you got to hop on that shit.
Now,

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:51,700
a Gotham comedy club in New York City,
you know how to use the Google son.

26
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,490
I would throw up links,
but if you really want to go,

27
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:55,450
you'll figure it out,
right?

28
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:56,730
So,
uh,

29
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:59,260
get any on my podcast.
I will definitely.

30
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,270
Um,
Brian was supposed to beat my lips.

31
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:06,271
Are very shy today.
Brian was supposed to be here today for 

32
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:07,120
this one,
but he got held in traffic and getting,

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,750
getting boned by the irs.
Back taxes.

34
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,720
Pay Your taxes,
bitches.

35
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,920
That's uncle Joe's advice for the day.
Pay Your fucking taxes.

36
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,520
The worst thing is when the irs like 
signals you out,

37
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,940
singles you out as a guy who's not 
paying taxes,

38
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:27,430
and then they just crawl up your ass 
hole and look around.

39
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,060
The tax laws are so gross.
The whole thing is so gross.

40
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,270
The idea that you have to pay such a 
giant percentage of what you make to do 

41
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:39,370
what?
To keep more people arresting people for

42
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,830
buying pot to do what?
To fix the streets.

43
00:02:41,831 --> 00:02:43,390
Is that where the fuck is the money 
going?

44
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,110
God Damn it.
Our machine is just too God damn big.

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,120
You know when you get to a certain 
amount of money,

46
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:54,121
you get into a 48 percent tax bracket.
You know you have to pay half of what 

47
00:02:54,431 --> 00:02:57,070
you make half literally.
That's crazy.

48
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,090
And the crazy thing is the people who 
make them more money,

49
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,570
the more money you make,
rather the higher percentage you have to

50
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:09,571
pay.
So not only do you pay more money just 

51
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:09,571
because you make more money,
which seems,

52
00:03:09,571 --> 00:03:13,740
that seems rational to me,
but the fact that you pay a higher 

53
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:13,840
percent,
that's just like saying,

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,610
listen,
we know you got it.

55
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,960
Fuck you.
Give us the money.

56
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,350
I mean it's really that simple.
It doesn't make any sense that someone 

57
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:25,711
who makes more money somehow or another 
uses a higher percentage of resources.

58
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,050
That's completely unfair.
It makes no sense,

59
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:34,051
but people just accept it but just 
accept it and they just take it in the 

60
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:37,510
ass and the machine keeps rolling on 
there.

61
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:42,511
Will be no end or will there will go to 
a first the twitter to check it out of 

62
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,340
the twitter feed that is on the same 
page,

63
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,640
which is a ustream.tv
channels slash Joe Rogan Dash live,

64
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,180
which will.
That's where you're at,

65
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,020
and then also go to forums dot Joe 
Rogan.net.

66
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:02,080
That's my website and there's a a forum 
up.

67
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:07,081
They're dedicated to this particular or 
rather a thread dedicated to this 

68
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:12,571
particular broadcast and so answer some 
questions from there to you mother 

69
00:04:12,571 --> 00:04:15,450
fucker.
Pull out of Iran Afghan and you'd save a

70
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:15,900
fortune.

71
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,930
Yeah.
What is that?

72
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,120
Well,
that's A.

73
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,280
I mean that's a simple way of looking at
it,

74
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,010
right?
CMC dermo 73.

75
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,230
It's a simple way of looking at.
Everybody says pull out,

76
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,510
but why the fuck are we there in the 
first place?

77
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:30,880
Like what is going on?
You know what I mean?

78
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:33,130
Is it as simple as,
you know,

79
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:38,131
we're over there because we need to keep
these terrorists from becoming strong.

80
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,660
We need to go and attack them at their 
base.

81
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,130
Okay.
If,

82
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,460
if that was what was agreed that that's 
the reason why we're there,

83
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,370
but there's a lot of people that say 
that doesn't make any sense.

84
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,520
There's a lot of people that say there's
very few Taliban that are actually left 

85
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,251
in Afghanistan that we have other 
motives and that these motives might be 

86
00:04:56,251 --> 00:04:57,040
the natural gas pipeline that runs 
through Afghanistan,

87
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,270
which are bloody apparently has been 
trying to control for years or they also

88
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:04,060
very overlooked in a subject that people
like.

89
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,240
They kind of poo poo it and they make it
seem like it's not that big a deal is 

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,331
the opium market.
Afghanistan produces some 90 something 

91
00:05:12,331 --> 00:05:16,420
percent of the entire world's opium.
The entire world's poppy seeds.

92
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,590
The entire world.
Heroin,

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,340
more than 90 percent of it is produced 
in Afghanistan.

94
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,170
That's fucking crazy,
right?

95
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,380
You hear about that.
You like there's a lot of goddamn money 

96
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:28,510
and heroin.
There's a lot of goddamn money in opium.

97
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I mean if all of it is being produced,
literally almost all of it in this one 

98
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,830
place,
like someone's making some fucking money

99
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,710
off that it's not.
The US got in there and they stopped.

100
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:39,490
Making heroin?
No,

101
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:41,350
there's more heroin now.
Heroin,

102
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,050
apparently you talked to people.
No.

103
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:48,290
You know,
I know people will do heroin and they 

104
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,290
say there's more heroin and it's easier 
to get now.

105
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,830
You know what the fuck man,
what?

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,100
What is really going on?
Then you find out that the president of 

107
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,650
Afghanistan,
this is absolute fact,

108
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,340
president

109
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,340
of Afghanistan,
his brother was being paid by the CIA 

110
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,870
for years,
like our government dollars.

111
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,020
We're going to pay the brother of the 
president of Afghanistan whose in the 

112
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:16,310
poppy business.
This guy is involved in the opium trade.

113
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,490
This guy is involved in the heroin trade
and he's an employee of the CIA.

114
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,670
Like really?
Is it that blatant?

115
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,730
Is that obvious?
There's for sure there's a ton of 

116
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,470
fucking corruption when it comes to the 
higher levels of government,

117
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,820
but I think really selling drugs or 
they're really doing it that openly.

118
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,620
It seems ridiculous,
right?

119
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,690
It seems like there's no way that could 
be possible.

120
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,090
There's no way it could be that corrupt.
If it was,

121
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:49,091
we would have heard about it,
but when you start researching the 

122
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:52,391
history of the CIA,
like they've been accused of doing this 

123
00:06:52,391 --> 00:06:52,970
for ever,
not just accused of doing this,

124
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:56,650
but people who don't make any sense like
crazy people and you know,

125
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,940
Internet conspiracy theorists,
but no,

126
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:02,450
they've been accused of doing it by 
people who used to work for the CIA.

127
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,600
They've been accused of doing it by 
people who have actually flown in the 

128
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,151
drugs.
There's a great case about a guy named 

129
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:12,551
barry seal's from MENA,
Arkansas escapes to driving flying to 

130
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:16,390
Mena,
Arkansas and dropoff big packages of 

131
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,581
cocaine.
I think we've talked about this before 

132
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:18,581
or I've talked about this before.
And anyway,

133
00:07:18,581 --> 00:07:18,800
these two kids,
uh,

134
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:21,740
inadvertently were there when the 
cocaine got dropped.

135
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,950
They were,
they witnessed what had happened.

136
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,370
So they took these kids and they 
murdered them and they left their bodies

137
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:30,590
on the train tracks.
And the excuse,

138
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:35,591
the official excuse at the police used 
was that these kids had gotten high and 

139
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:36,770
that they had fallen asleep on the 
plane.

140
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:39,080
Sharks because they were on drugs.
Well,

141
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:42,520
the mothers of the kids forced 
autopsies,

142
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:45,620
the parents forced ops autopsies,
they didn't want to do autopsies,

143
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:46,740
but they forced them,
they,

144
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,770
they got them done,
and it turns out that these kids had 

145
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:51,770
been murdered.

146
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,700
They had been stabbed multiple times 
before they had been put on these train 

147
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,511
tracks.
So then the investigation goes further 

148
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:01,610
and it turns out this guy named Barry 
Seal's who is a CIA employee and there's

149
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:05,780
no documented.
This guy's got a great long history with

150
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,030
the CIA.
There's tons of pictures,

151
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:10,490
there's tons of documentation on this 
guy.

152
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,840
And this guy was flying in drugs from 
South America and that's what he did.

153
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,350
He did it for the CIA and right when he 
was about to go testify,

154
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,600
the guy gets murdered that gets 
assassinated,

155
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,700
uh,
with George Bush's phone number in his 

156
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:25,700
pocket.
Um,

157
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,560
so there's that guy,
there's a,

158
00:08:27,561 --> 00:08:29,400
there's another guy named Michael Rupert
and Michael.

159
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Rupert has a website now and he's got a 
bunch of books on the whole situation,

160
00:08:34,941 --> 00:08:39,200
but his story is that he was working for
the lapd.

161
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:42,260
Uh,
I'm not sure if he worked in narcotics,

162
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:47,261
but he's involved somehow or another and
some narcotics case and it turns out 

163
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:51,420
that the CIA was involved and the CIA 
was protecting these people in the CIA.

164
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,960
He was selling drugs and he,
uh,

165
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,530
went to try to report it.
They squashed everything and he just 

166
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,510
went public with everything and it's,
you know,

167
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,010
he gets very little attention.
I mean,

168
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:04,050
it's really shocking how little 
attention to yet.

169
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,130
But uh,
he's a,

170
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,100
he's a fascinating dude.
This Michael Rupert Guy,

171
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,460
he's got a couple of really fascinating 
books.

172
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,330
Uh,
I think,

173
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,540
uh,
the end of the Rubicon is one and that's

174
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:18,460
the one I've read and there's a,
he's got it,

175
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:23,461
he's got a few other ones,
but basically like going into great 

176
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:24,990
depth and detail,
all of his research on the CIA and their

177
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,850
involvement in drugs.
Why,

178
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,680
why would they do that?
Why would our government do that?

179
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,470
Fucking,
there's a lot of goddamn money on it.

180
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:36,740
I think they could justify that either.
So much money involved in drugs and 

181
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:37,950
someone's going to make that money.

182
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,770
People are addicted to drugs,
like why don't we make that money in the

183
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,540
least that money's being made by the 
good guys.

184
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,970
I mean,
that's like the most idealistic point of

185
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:46,680
view.
Make sure your kids don't do drugs.

186
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,930
Make sure no one that he loves,
Dude does drugs,

187
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:53,931
but let's be honest,
there are people out there that are 

188
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:53,931
going to do drugs and if anybody should 
make the money,

189
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:56,010
it should be the good guys.
I can see people falling for that,

190
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,940
but the bottom line is it's all greed.
It's all this nasty,

191
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,910
evil,
greed,

192
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,930
the.
That's the whole reason why some drugs 

193
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,221
are legal and some drugs are illegal.
It's because when they make them 

194
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:10,770
illegal,
they can control what you do.

195
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,050
They can.
You can't control things that are really

196
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,110
easy to grow like marijuana.
So one of the main reasons why marijuana

197
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:18,810
is illegal is because it's so god damn 
easy to grow.

198
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,820
He could just plant seeds out in the 
field.

199
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,040
It'll grow on its own.
You know,

200
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,700
you don't even need to help it.
I mean,

201
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:28,701
it's a really hardy plant and I know a 
lot of morons that grow pot and when you

202
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,310
know it's an easy thing to do like that 
you can't control that,

203
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:32,870
you know,
they're,

204
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:34,140
they're not going to be able to control 
it.

205
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:35,850
There's going to be people selling it 
left and right.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
They're not going to get taxes from that
because people would just get to 

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
exchange cash or whatever the fuck they 
going to do with it.

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,780
You're not going to be able to wrap 
something up the way they get wrap up 

209
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,590
oxycontin's or something like that.
You know,

210
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,630
it's very difficult to produce an 
Oxycontin,

211
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:49,800
you know,
they liked that.

212
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,540
They don't like heroin.
Heroin is just like,

213
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:51,950
what are you doing?

214
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,960
You're growing a plant and then you're 
scraping some shit off the plan and 

215
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,150
you're selling never stopped.
That's illegal.

216
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:01,770
We will let you do that,
but we will let you buy these pills that

217
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:06,771
are basically the same goddamn thing 
that just made by a pharmaceutical 

218
00:11:06,771 --> 00:11:09,741
company and they process it and they 
make this orally adjustable heroin and 

219
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,440
that's what Oxycontin is.
I mean,

220
00:11:10,441 --> 00:11:12,360
it literally,
they call it hillbilly heroin.

221
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,700
It's fucking heroin.
It really is heroin.

222
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,420
You're just eating it,
you know,

223
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:21,300
you're eating it in a pill form,
just like Marinol is thc in a pill form,

224
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:26,630
but that stuff's supposed to suck.
I've talked to people that say that 

225
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,480
principle thc is link one active element
and marijuana,

226
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:30,960
there's a whole bunch of two way better 
to get the actual stuff from the plant.

227
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,060
You know,
I don't know if that's true with heroin.

228
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,640
I've never done heroin.
I've never done marinol either.

229
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,610
I wouldn't do heroin.
I'm scared of anything that's addictive.

230
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,690
But if I was a musician I might consider
it.

231
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,900
I might,
I might just start a little every now 

232
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:47,900
and then,
you know,

233
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,410
write down and wants today and never 
again or something.

234
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,990
Try to convince myself that somehow or 
another it wouldn't be addicted.

235
00:11:51,991 --> 00:11:54,130
I don't know how it really is

236
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,110
a.
I hear varying reports.

237
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:01,500
You know,
the problem I have with toe whenever 

238
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,200
someone talks about things being 
addictive and not being addicted is that

239
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:04,540
alcohol is addictive.
You know,

240
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:09,541
people get addicted to alcohol,
but I'm not addicted to it so I don't 

241
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:09,541
get that.
I mean,

242
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:10,320
I can,
I could,

243
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,330
if,
if someone told me right now I could 

244
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:15,370
never have another beer or another glass
of wine for the rest of my life,

245
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,690
I'd be like,
okay.

246
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,510
I mean I enjoy it.
I like a habit,

247
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:24,511
a shot every now and then with my 
friends just to get fucking crazy or 

248
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,881
shot before shows from.
But realistically it's not that 

249
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:26,881
important,
you know,

250
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:28,900
I don't need it.
It's not really addictive to me,

251
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,300
but to some people it is.
Okay.

252
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:35,020
Is that the case with heroin?
Is that the case with cigarettes seem to

253
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:40,021
be the one they've got the most wired 
cigarettes seem to be the one they can 

254
00:12:40,021 --> 00:12:41,280
addict the most people to,
you know,

255
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,130
because there's a lot of people that 
don't get addicted to the normal stuff.

256
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,370
Like there's a lot of people that drink 
coffee and they drink it all the time,

257
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:50,740
but they can just quit and it doesn't 
bother them at all.

258
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,700
And there's some people that they,
if they don't have coffee everyday,

259
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,990
they're fucked.
Those people are addicted to caffeine.

260
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,440
When I was writing my blog,
I was writing a monthly blog right 

261
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,160
before I recorded my,
um,

262
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,690
my comedy,
uh,

263
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,500
my m spike TV,
comedy special.

264
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,990
I wanted to make sure I kept my brain 
like real sharp.

265
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,710
And I said,
well,

266
00:13:08,711 --> 00:13:10,720
the best way to do that is to perform as
much as I can,

267
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:15,721
but also write as much as I can.
So I forced myself into writing a blog 

268
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,880
every day for a whole month.
And um,

269
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:19,570
when I did that,
you know,

270
00:13:19,571 --> 00:13:24,571
I was drinking a lot of coffee and I was
drinking French press coffee where it's 

271
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:25,870
like,
it's really fucking strong,

272
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,910
you know,
and I make it strong too.

273
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,040
I like it.
I like a strong cup of coffee,

274
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,350
but the problem is I was drinking this 
shit like two,

275
00:13:32,351 --> 00:13:37,351
three cups a day and then I did it like 
30 days in a row and there's one point 

276
00:13:37,351 --> 00:13:42,061
in time where I didn't drink it for a 
day and I had a headache and it was 

277
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:42,061
like,
uh,

278
00:13:42,061 --> 00:13:46,180
oh.
Like my brain was getting accustom to 

279
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:48,580
having all these stimulants in it.
And I realized,

280
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,450
okay,
this is not good.

281
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,790
I got to stop that shit lately.
I've been drinking tea.

282
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,550
Brian turned me onto this thing.
This is like this.

283
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,600
You put the tea leaves in there and then
you put the water in there and you can 

284
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,040
like,
you don't have to like have a tea bag.

285
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,810
You get like fresh tea leaves,
taste good.

286
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:10,110
It's just like,
sometimes I need something warm to 

287
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,110
drink.
It's like,

288
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,940
it's just like,
like my friend tate,

289
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,630
he says it best.

290
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,570
I said coffee,
coffee's like a warm hug.

291
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,770
But I got addicted to coffee.
But uh,

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,850
I mean it was only for like a couple of 
days,

293
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,890
a couple days.
I'm not drinking and just drinking water

294
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:22,840
and everything was back to normal again 
luckily.

295
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,930
But this was 30 days in a row,
not 30 years in a row,

296
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,190
you know,
I couldn't imagine that.

297
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,380
But cigarettes seem to be the one that 
they've got the most nailed as to how to

298
00:14:32,381 --> 00:14:35,350
just get you fucking hooked,
you know.

299
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,910
Um,
there's a,

300
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:42,060
an article that I read recently where 
they were discussing all the different 

301
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,911
additives that the government allows 
them to put into cigarettes and there's 

302
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:47,440
599 of them.
How fucking nuts is that?

303
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,650
There's 599 different chemicals and look
at them,

304
00:14:51,651 --> 00:14:54,830
unless you're some sort of a Pharma 
chemists sort of a character,

305
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,831
you're not going to have any idea what 
the fuck they are and there's 599 of 

306
00:14:59,831 --> 00:14:59,831
them in cigarettes.

307
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,660
I'd say it was just supposed to be 
fucking tobacco.

308
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,820
Like what the fuck is going on?
What is that?

309
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,220
I mean is it a procedure or are they 
preservatives?

310
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,280
Is it,
is it like that Russell Crowe movie,

311
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:14,180
the insider is all that shit actually 
designed to make it more addictive.

312
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,410
It's one of the most damaging things I 
think about politicians is that they 

313
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:20,410
never talked about cigarettes.
You know,

314
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,110
they're always wanted.
They always want to talk about the ill,

315
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,890
no bad drugs out there.
And you know,

316
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,310
this terrible thing that can happen if 
your kids get involved in drugs,

317
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:32,810
but nobody wants a banned cigarettes 
like nobody ever says that.

318
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:37,400
And it's because those fucking tobacco 
company spent a bankroll.

319
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,990
I spent a fuck load of money.

320
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,350
What else?
Let me go to the questions here.

321
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,720
Is there a lot of questions and they 
keep moving fast.

322
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,260
And I'm a rambling motherfucker.
Joe were a different color shirt in the 

323
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,730
UFC broadcast.
Next time.

324
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,060
No knit.
I like wearing black shirts and I get 

325
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:04,220
them for free.
I get clothes from affliction for free,

326
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,970
send me some cool shit so that I don't 
make fun of them anymore.

327
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,790
I like their stuff.
I like some other stuff.

328
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:15,800
There's some scully stuff that was just 
a little too scully and Flemmi for me.

329
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,980
But uh,
I got a pair that dragon jeans,

330
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,770
they got dope leather jackets too.
And I liked their,

331
00:16:21,771 --> 00:16:24,050
uh,
the Japanese style stuff.

332
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,070
They had all that.
Uh,

333
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,460
I forget the man's name.
A tattoo artist design a bunch of t 

334
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,070
shirts for them that were really fucking
cool.

335
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:34,490
Like right up my alley,
like Tiger Versus Samurai type stuff.

336
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,170
I've got a bunch of those,
I love those.

337
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,910
But apparently that,
that guy,

338
00:16:37,911 --> 00:16:42,911
uh,
he was selling his same designs to a 

339
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:45,050
couple different tee shirt companies.
They had to get rid of them because it's

340
00:16:45,051 --> 00:16:50,051
a,
some sort of a copyright lawsuit and go 

341
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,280
on affliction crows are fucking brutal.
Um,

342
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,620
ed hardy is the most brutal to me.
Ed Hardy Shit.

343
00:16:54,621 --> 00:16:59,621
Assassinate John from John and kate plus
eight because that guy single handedly 

344
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,800
made ed hardy shirts.
Like dad is just like,

345
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:06,900
that's the gold stamp bank Douche bag.
Like when that guy started wearing it 

346
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,721
everywhere,
like I think ed hardy was probably 

347
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:10,760
paying him a little.
Did they know that,

348
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:15,761
uh,
that just put the fucking the Douche 

349
00:17:15,761 --> 00:17:15,761
label on the Ed Hardy.
Um,

350
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,010
there's a,
a chick that's a one in the morning djs 

351
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,010
in Denver,
missy,

352
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,440
and she calls them Douche Capes,
which is the perfect way to describe 

353
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,570
them.
Do capes.

354
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,320
Okay.
Glad you guys liked the raw dog show.

355
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,010
That was fun.
That was real fun.

356
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,200
And my coming to Australia anytime soon,
I'll be in Australia next time the UFC 

357
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,820
is going to be there.
I really can't over there for

358
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,960
just to,
just to fly over there.

359
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,690
I don't have the time.
It's too long.

360
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:58,350
Sixteen fucking hours in the air.
I enjoyed the shit out of it though.

361
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,010
I had a great God damn time that's 
drawn.

362
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:02,550
This man,
dude that's going to fight.

363
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,940
Tim Silvia,
Aaron Davis aspect question.

364
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,270
There's this guy who's like one of the,
uh,

365
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,130
he one strong man competition like many 
times and he's scheduled to fight.

366
00:18:14,131 --> 00:18:19,131
Tim Sylvia,
who is a former UFC heavyweight 

367
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,991
champion.
I'm looking at flight and everybody's 

368
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:20,991
going,
oh,

369
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:21,340
what's he?
This is a great fight.

370
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,150
Fight like Tim Sylvia can fight like 
just kids.

371
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Ray Mercer knocked him out just because 
like he's lost to a couple of different 

372
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,981
guys like fate or there's a big goddamn 
difference between losing the fader and 

373
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:35,910
losing to a guys had one fight and it's 
really good at lifting shit.

374
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,660
That guy's gonna get his ass handed to 
him if tense it.

375
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,070
Tim Silvia loses that fight.
There's something wrong.

376
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,350
He's got something wrong with him and he
probably shouldn't fight anymore.

377
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,730
I think tim,
Sylvia,

378
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,130
she'll be able to keep that at bay.
I mean,

379
00:18:47,131 --> 00:18:48,810
it all is,
is big and strong.

380
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:54,230
I mean,
I just cannot see a world where Tim 

381
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,600
Silvia doesn't bomb on that guy as is 
coming in,

382
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,980
you know?
I mean,

383
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:59,370
I could be wrong.
He could just get completely overwhelmed

384
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,580
by the power.
But technique is more important than 

385
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:04,580
power and fighting.
And if one guy,

386
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:07,170
I mean you can hate on Tim Silvia,
all you want.

387
00:19:07,171 --> 00:19:10,350
The guy was the UFC heavyweight champion
and he wasn't because he sucked.

388
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,640
Go Watch his fight with Rigo Rodriguez,
you know,

389
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,370
watch,
watch some of his fights.

390
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,350
Watched when he had kicked trey 
tellerman.

391
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,590
He's fucking dangerous man.
Tim Silvia is one of the most underrated

392
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:22,830
and under look guys.
Yeah,

393
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,360
he got knocked out by Ray Mercer.

394
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:29,690
But guess what,
Ray Mercer connects on your head like 

395
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:29,690
that.
Everyone's going out.

396
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,140
He definitely fucked up and he 
definitely didn't fight smart in that 

397
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,631
fight without a doubt,
but you can't write them off just 

398
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:38,961
because of one performance.
He's still accomplished a lot of 

399
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:41,511
dangerous shit.
He's always been a sucker for that 

400
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:41,511
overhand right.
That's what I shouldn't say a soccer,

401
00:19:41,511 --> 00:19:45,951
but he's getting hit and gotten hit with
it before Randy coture dropped him with 

402
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:48,801
it.
That's where Lawsky hit them with and 

403
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:48,801
that's also obviously what ray mercer 
had him with.

404
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:49,980
You know,
he's got a lazy job.

405
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,360
They said it,
but I think that puts an Ascii guy.

406
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,360
It's like,
wow,

407
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:59,380
you're.
You're jumping into the deep end of the 

408
00:19:59,380 --> 00:19:59,380
pool.
So you know,

409
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,450
Tim Silva is not that old.
Tim Silvia has had some tough fights,

410
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,490
but not that much.
No,

411
00:20:02,491 --> 00:20:04,570
I think that's going to be a real tough 
fight for that push guy.

412
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,210
I could be wrong.
I could be wrong.

413
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,690
He might do those running fucking leg 
kicks like it did to that other dude.

414
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,700
We're just basically ran out on like a 
bowl,

415
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:15,660
but that other guy comparing him to Tim 
Silvia is just ridiculous.

416
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,680
He's smaller.
He's not as nearly as experienced.

417
00:20:18,681 --> 00:20:20,220
He's just a boxer is.
I mean,

418
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:25,221
there's so many differences between the 
first guy who fought and fighting the 

419
00:20:25,221 --> 00:20:26,160
UFC heavyweight champ.
That's fucking,

420
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,550
that's pretty crazy.
He might not even get to him because 

421
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:31,550
he's got to fight in between that and 
he's got a fight.

422
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,400
Um,
before that.

423
00:20:32,401 --> 00:20:37,401
I think in April he's fighting someone 
else and he's going to fight him silly 

424
00:20:37,401 --> 00:20:41,510
right after that.
He might not beat that guy that he's 

425
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,510
fighting in April.
I mean,

426
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:41,530
if a guy knows how to fight,
it's a,

427
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:46,570
just a big goddamn difference between a 
guy who's just strong and he's gonna 

428
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:46,570
leave openings.
Man,

429
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,950
you know,
if he leaves open,

430
00:20:47,951 --> 00:20:48,220
someone's

431
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,290
going to catch on and as soon as you got
to catch them,

432
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,050
you can't put muscles in your face.
And you know,

433
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,080
I mean,
I don't know exactly what kind of a 

434
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,080
background he has and fighting other 
than being super strong,

435
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,220
but it didn't look like much.
He lived real stiff.

436
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,570
You know what I mean?
Once he hits you,

437
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:02,860
if he gets a hold of you,
starts hitting you,

438
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:08,010
you're fucked.
But it's all that before he gets a hold 

439
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:08,010
of you.
Stuff that's like,

440
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,160
it's all Herky Jerky,
you know,

441
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,750
all muscle,
no technique,

442
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,160
you know,
it's uh,

443
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,190
I think it's going to be interesting,
but when you're guys that strong last 

444
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:17,190
year,
we'll learn a few techniques,

445
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,640
get them really good.
Fuck.

446
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:24,010
I mean,
you're talking about a guy that 

447
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:24,010
literally is one of the strongest men to
walk the planet.

448
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:29,180
You know,
if you could teach that guy to start 

449
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,180
guys,
some,

450
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,860
some solid wrestling,
teach that guy like it's just a good 

451
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:31,860
amount,
you know,

452
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,820
just a few moves.
Just teach them how to keep his hands 

453
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:35,820
up,
close the distance,

454
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,901
teach them some take downs and teach 
them to get on top of dudes and just 

455
00:21:39,901 --> 00:21:40,930
smash their fucking head.
You know,

456
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,880
a guy like that.
If you taught them some shit,

457
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,180
he would only need a few things just 
because he's so God damn strong.

458
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,190
A few things.
You'd be able to beat a lot of guys.

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,930
But Tim,
Sylvia,

460
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,310
I don't know,
but that's on.

461
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,900
I don't know about that sign.

462
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,780
Let's see what else we got here.

463
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,250
Um,
I watched a video today of a dude who 

464
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:09,120
cut his fucking balls off the dude.
Somebody posted it on my message board 

465
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,520
and this guy says something crazy.
Ozzy man or deranged ozzy man,

466
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,180
the thread cut his balls off.
This guy tied a rubber band around his 

467
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,550
balls until his balls,
like literally died.

468
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,400
Like they turned like,
like dead and gray.

469
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,620
And then he hacked his balls off with a 
knife.

470
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,990
Really?

471
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,790
Um,
do you want to see it?

472
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:36,850
If you want to see it.
You know what?

473
00:22:36,851 --> 00:22:41,851
I'll throw the link.
I'll just let everybody know that it's 

474
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:45,081
fucking completely disgusting.
There's no way you should really be 

475
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:45,870
watching this,
but if you want to,

476
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,870
I will copy the link posted on twitter 
and I'm gonna say do not watch this.

477
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,540
Okay?

478
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,010
I just posted it on twitter.
Don't watch it.

479
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,700
You don't need to unless,
unless someone has done you wrong and 

480
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,770
less and less.

481
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,590
Maybe Sandra bullock is out there.
Sandra,

482
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:54,410
I know that you've had some tough times 
recently and I saw recently a online the

483
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:59,411
photos of this young lady that Jesse 
James allegedly has had an affair with.

484
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:02,810
And,
uh,

485
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:08,320
you might want to watch the video of the
guy cut his balls off the rest of you 

486
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,650
though.
But this is a message to Sandra bullock.

487
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,150
You need to know,
sweetie,

488
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,590
that there's a broad spectrum to human 
beings and human behavior.

489
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,490
And it's,
you know,

490
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:21,491
life isn't what you see at the craft 
service table when everyone's kissing 

491
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:22,310
your ass on the set.
There's a lot of crazy shit out there.

492
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,540
And,
uh,

493
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:29,350
this crazy fucking skank with a tattoo 
on her forehead fucked her husband too.

494
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,180
Mad World,
so fucking mad world.

495
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,930
If you look at Sandra bullock and you 
looked at Jesse James,

496
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,280
you know,
you'd say,

497
00:24:40,281 --> 00:24:41,030
well,
you know,

498
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,060
he's a rough fucking handsome character 
and she's a beautiful woman and they 

499
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,860
make a great couple.
Uh,

500
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,200
and then I showed you this freak with 
the tattooed on her head,

501
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:56,750
this,
this crazy place that he's apparently 

502
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:56,750
been banned.
And I said,

503
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:56,750
well,
we would.

504
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,800
Do you think that he would cheat on her 
for her to be like,

505
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,590
what the fuck is that?
Now he's Jesse James,

506
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:02,210
right?
This guy's a fucking TV star.

507
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:07,211
He's married to Sandra bullock.
He's not going to fuck this crazy bitch 

508
00:25:07,211 --> 00:25:07,340
with a tattoo on her head,
but yeah I did.

509
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,250
And why did he do it?
Because people I fucking deranged people

510
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:15,980
are crazy.
They can't help themselves.

511
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:20,780
They,
they're looking for something to fucking

512
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,840
just to blow energy out somehow to what 
are they going to do to some drugs,

513
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,740
cheating on their wife,
drive too fast,

514
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,900
get a motorcycle.
What the fuck are they going to do?

515
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,310
You know,
if you read tiger woods,

516
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:36,311
his stuff and I can't fucking help it.
Some new scan came out with all his 

517
00:25:36,311 --> 00:25:38,090
twitters or not.
Not as twitter as his text messages that

518
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:38,870
he sent to her.
I'm like,

519
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,260
first of all,
what kind of relationship did he have 

520
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,260
with these girls that they would want to
put is like,

521
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,130
didn't even.
I was even friends with them.

522
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,070
It seems like these girls like don't 
even,

523
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,030
like they didn't even talk to him.
It seems like,

524
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,170
you know,
like it was this,

525
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,060
this thing was just all fucking.

526
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,060
And because of that I think they were 
like,

527
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,090
they felt slighted and that's what I'm 
getting out of this.

528
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:03,650
I'm getting that.
They felt slighted,

529
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:08,850
you know,
that here's this guy with the most 

530
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,310
squeaky clean image in the world and 
this image is what he used to make a ton

531
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:15,311
of money and you know,
he's like a super successful guy at the 

532
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:20,460
most lucrative sport in the world and 
the sport,

533
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,260
the most connected to money to big 
businesses to mean so many.

534
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,570
Like it's so important to be like the 
best golfer ever.

535
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:28,160
I'm like,
God,

536
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,780
it's just such a huge thing like to 
market and sell that.

537
00:26:31,781 --> 00:26:36,781
And so here's this guy.
And meanwhile he's just a dirty bitch 

538
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:38,220
just talking about taking it out of 
their ass,

539
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,240
stuffing in their mouth.
I'll add those in as texts like this 

540
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,190
motherfucker was crazy.
You know,

541
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,790
it's,
it's pretty clear that it's,

542
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,380
it's more than just,
Oh,

543
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,880
you know,
he thought he could get away with it.

544
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,370
Oh,
well,

545
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,250
you know,
he's just a man and men are,

546
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:53,730
you know,
after.

547
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,130
No,
no,

548
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:54,480
no,
no.

549
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,510
He was deranged.
Alright,

550
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:01,580
people are crazy.
He was getting a wild thrill from doing 

551
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,150
this thing that he wasn't supposed to be
doing.

552
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:04,290
It was all like naughty,
shitty.

553
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:07,620
Want to Piss on girls to saying I want 
to give you a golden shower,

554
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,850
but the crazy thing is tiger woods or 
sending tax.

555
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,680
I want to stuff my cock and your ass.
Now put it in your mouth like,

556
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:15,070
whoa.
Tiger.

557
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,140
Like,
man,

558
00:27:19,141 --> 00:27:21,120
if you're going to send a text like that
to someone,

559
00:27:21,121 --> 00:27:25,610
you've got to make sure that that person
is your friend saying you can just.

560
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:30,710
If you're fucking tiger woods,
you can't just go send in text like 

561
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:30,710
that.
The people you know,

562
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,170
you got to go,
Hey,

563
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:36,171
I'm.
If I sent you a text and it's really 

564
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,601
crazy,
will you promise me that you won't sell 

565
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:39,150
this later?
You gotta say something you get just,

566
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,910
just fucking free ball like that.
Tiger,

567
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,180
tiger woods.
Have any fucking friends because I feel 

568
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,180
like if he had any friends they were 
going to.

569
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,690
What are you doing?
Like you're banging waitresses and 

570
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:51,690
people are watching,
you know,

571
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,520
like you're gonna.
You can take it down a notch,

572
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,380
you know,
get,

573
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,170
you know,
get a hooker who has something to lose.

574
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,650
But who has something to lose in 
comparison to him though?

575
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:03,300
Nobody.
If you're a guy like that,

576
00:28:03,301 --> 00:28:05,670
you can never trust anybody,
you know,

577
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:06,850
if that's what you're doing.
If you're a,

578
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,100
a wild guy that likes to cheat on your 
wife and you're a fucking billionaire,

579
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,880
super squeaky clean character,
who the fuck can you trust?

580
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,310
Like that guy?
Man,

581
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:22,311
I want to predict that he would have to 
go somewhere where they didn't know who 

582
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:25,021
he was.
He'd have to go to like Malaysia to 

583
00:28:25,021 --> 00:28:25,021
cheap.
Poor Fella.

584
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,870
Poor Fella.
All right.

585
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,940
What do I think at James?
Tony.

586
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,440
I'm disturbed by James.
Tony is his recent speeches,

587
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,760
you know?
Um.

588
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Oh.
I don't know what's going on with him 

589
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,100
physically.
You know?

590
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,200
I don't know.
I guess he wants to fight heavyweight.

591
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,700
I've heard that.
He says he wants to fight Brock Lesnar.

592
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:50,180
If that's the case,
I think maybe the best thing to do to 

593
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:50,190
get this over with and just give him 
brock lesnar.

594
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,760
I mean if Dave James,
Tony Loses to somebody.

595
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,470
The way I look at it as like James,
Tony,

596
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,280
obviously all the respect in the world 
as a boxer of all time,

597
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,420
you know,
really one of the craftiest guys to come

598
00:29:03,421 --> 00:29:07,230
along in decades and a guy who really 
utilize that old,

599
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:11,400
like Archie Moore shoulders,
shoulder roll style,

600
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,600
like had a real classic old timers 
boxing style,

601
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,810
like real good at like,
like rolling with punches.

602
00:29:18,811 --> 00:29:21,180
Then coming back,
let's just counter right hand is against

603
00:29:21,181 --> 00:29:23,910
John Ruiz.
There's like a youtube clip of him.

604
00:29:23,911 --> 00:29:28,911
Like you see how beautiful his timing 
was and like when he just destroyed 

605
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:29,910
evander holyfield in their fight.
Man,

606
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:33,270
he's a so he's so skillful as a boxer,
very,

607
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:38,271
very skillful,
but there's so much more to mma than 

608
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:43,221
just boxing.
And I'm not hearing about him going to 

609
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:45,990
American top team.
I'm not hearing about him going to team 

610
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:45,990
quest.

611
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm not hearing about him going to,
you know,

612
00:29:47,561 --> 00:29:51,070
to like high level camps to work with 
big wrestlers to get.

613
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:56,071
I tried to take him down because 
otherwise I'm hearing him say he's gonna

614
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,190
fight.
Brock Lesnar,

615
00:29:57,191 --> 00:30:02,191
I'm hearing one of two things.
I'm either here and he doesn't give a 

616
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:05,131
fuck,
he's just here to get paid or I'm 

617
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:07,051
hearing he is crazy and he thinks that 
he's going to be able to stop brock 

618
00:30:07,051 --> 00:30:09,040
lesnar from taking them down by hitting 
him with a punch.

619
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,340
The either one is not good because one 
of them means he's delusional.

620
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:17,370
That he doesn't really understand what 
this is all about and the other one 

621
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,670
means that he's just a guy who was 
looking for money.

622
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:21,370
Either one is not that good.
I don't know.

623
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,810
You know,
I don't know.

624
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:25,620
Boxing is a tough Goddamn game and when 
you've been in it,

625
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:30,621
as long as James Tony as a,
even though he doesn't take that much 

626
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:30,621
punishment,
you know,

627
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:34,381
you gotTa,
you gotta realize these guys at a 

628
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:34,381
certain point in time,
you know,

629
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:37,060
they only have the only have a certain 
amount more punches you can take,

630
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,650
you know,
at a certain.

631
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,840
There's a finite number after that 
number,

632
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,370
you're fucked.
You know,

633
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:47,400
and I think that the thing with James 
Tony is he has this incredible 

634
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:51,841
confidence in his hands and he really 
truly believes that if a guy like brock 

635
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:53,410
was,
tries to take him down,

636
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,930
that he's going to be able to connect in
with those little gloves,

637
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,020
he's going to put them to sleep.
I think it's looks a lot easier than it 

638
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,810
is.
That's what I think.

639
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:04,660
I think if he starts training with high 
level guys,

640
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,400
he goes and you know,
work out with,

641
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:11,420
you know,
a chemo workout with some of my high 

642
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:11,470
level wrestlers and see how easy it is 
for those guys that take you down.

643
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:16,700
You know,
you think you're just going to catch up 

644
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,871
with an upper cut.
You can't throw punches the same way 

645
00:31:17,871 --> 00:31:17,920
when you're worried about a guy taking 
you down.

646
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,600
You don't know.
The timing is not the same.

647
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,240
You can't stand the same way.
If you stand the same way,

648
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:25,150
they're going to kick your legs out and 
they're going to take you down easy.

649
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:28,600
So you have to change your stance.
So now I have to change your stance as a

650
00:31:28,601 --> 00:31:31,000
boxer.
You have to constantly be thinking about

651
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:36,001
sprawling,
constantly be thinking about getting 

652
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:36,001
your under hook set.
It's not.

653
00:31:36,001 --> 00:31:39,631
It's not the same sport.
It's not the punching ability that he 

654
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,440
asks is a huge plus and it'll 
definitely,

655
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,340
if anybody is stupid enough to not try 
to take them down and just box with him,

656
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:50,490
you're going to get your clock cleaned.
You know for sure he's going to hit you 

657
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:53,581
with some precise counter punches.
He's going to take advantage of little 

658
00:31:53,581 --> 00:31:57,421
tiny minute openings because really he's
such a high level box or we don't see 

659
00:31:57,911 --> 00:32:00,430
that high level striker in the octagon.

660
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,690
He can make God look foolish if somebody
chose some crazy boxer,

661
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,800
you know in the UFC,
a guy who's got good hands chose to try 

662
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:09,850
to stand up,
just stand up with James,

663
00:32:09,851 --> 00:32:11,800
Tony.
He would make them look like a fool.

664
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,880
He really would really demoralized that.
He would talk shit to them.

665
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,100
He was bitch,
bitch,

666
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:23,790
bitch,
and he would keep just land and punches 

667
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:23,790
on you.
He will fuck your world up,

668
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,910
but I don't think they're going to do 
that.

669
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,680
I think guys are going to do one or two 
things.

670
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:30,850
They're going to kick the living fuck 
out of his legs or they're just going to

671
00:32:30,851 --> 00:32:33,550
take them now and I don't think he's 
going to mail stop that.

672
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,010
I don't think he's going to stop though.
I don't think,

673
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,370
you know,
if he got like a,

674
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,820
a big Jujitsu guy gets all the women 
like,

675
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,540
uh,
like,

676
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,610
like Nepal,
Gabriel,

677
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:44,990
Gonzaga,
Gabriel,

678
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:47,420
Gonzaga got a hold of Jesus Christ.

679
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,820
He might just start breaking pieces of 
them off,

680
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,770
you know?
And if God help him,

681
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:54,680
if Brock Lesnar wants to take them down,
you can't,

682
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,570
we can't just catch that guy with a 
punch.

683
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:58,940
That's not enough.
Okay.

684
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,970
That's,
that's enough for your average regular 

685
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:03,970
human brock lesnar.
That's,

686
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,280
that's a freak of a man that's like the 
high end of the genetic spectrum or you 

687
00:33:09,981 --> 00:33:10,490
like,
you know,

688
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:13,250
you can have a dude who looks like a 
kabod crane.

689
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,590
You know,
you could have a dude who looks like,

690
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,500
you know,
like who is olive oil?

691
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:22,010
And that Popeye movie was that bitches.
No pictures.

692
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,510
I'm so mean shelly.
Something,

693
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:28,511
another,
whatever her name is real stink of 

694
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:29,000
Lindsay Lohan.
You can have a Lindsay Lohan frame,

695
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,260
you know,
a Paris Hilton,

696
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:33,800
the frame low skinny body or you have 
the high end.

697
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,850
You have brock or some weird instance 
where,

698
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:38,900
you know,
Vikings,

699
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,240
Vikings for generation after generation 
and their warrior bloodlines were passed

700
00:33:44,241 --> 00:33:47,390
on and this motherfucker living in the 
woods in Minnesota,

701
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,760
you know,
he got the best of the best fucking head

702
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,510
is that big.

703
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,020
You know,
I mean that guy for sure has good 

704
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,331
wrestling for short works very hard and 
his technique and all that's well and 

705
00:33:58,331 --> 00:33:58,430
good,
but at the end of the day,

706
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:03,431
that motherfucker is a barbarian.
The reason why he so fucking good he is 

707
00:34:03,801 --> 00:34:08,801
at direct descendants from ancient giant
warriors from thousands of years ago.

708
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,940
That's that in a regular dude,
man.

709
00:34:10,941 --> 00:34:15,941
You ain't going to just be able to punch
that guy and send him home pack and now 

710
00:34:15,941 --> 00:34:19,421
he's going to eat your punch and he's 
going to pick you up in the air like 

711
00:34:19,421 --> 00:34:21,020
you're a pillow and you're going to feel
so bad.

712
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,560
You're going to feel terrible.
The feeling that you're going to have of

713
00:34:24,561 --> 00:34:29,561
helplessness and hopelessness when that 
fucking gorilla grabs a hold of you and 

714
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:35,681
yanks you up in the air and smashes you 
and it gets on top of you and starts 

715
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,860
those big fucking lunchbox fists.

716
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,600
That's a wrap,
son.

717
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,070
You're done.
Okay.

718
00:34:43,071 --> 00:34:45,030
You're not.
You're not going to jab and shoulder.

719
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,200
Roll your way away from Brock Lesner.
He's gonna.

720
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Fuck you.
He's going to do whatever he wants to 

721
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:52,360
you.
He's going to have you work for him.

722
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,400
You're going to own him.
He's gonna.

723
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,090
Be He's gonna.
Be Your master.

724
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,120
He's going to put a dog collar on you.
He's going to do whatever the fuck you 

725
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,120
want.
Do you not understand that?

726
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,720
Like that guy can do whatever he wants 
to you.

727
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,010
If we didn't live in this civilized 
culture thousands years ago,

728
00:35:07,011 --> 00:35:10,190
everyone that brock lesnar fought would 
be chained up in his yard.

729
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:15,220
They would work for him and they would 
just hope and pray that brock doesn't 

730
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:15,540
get angry and decided to fuck you up 
today.

731
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:16,880
You know?
That's,

732
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,290
that's a scary dude,
man.

733
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,300
You know?
Is he the best guy in the world?

734
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,460
I don't know,
he's got to fight door.

735
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,840
He's got to fight chain car.
When you know these guys,

736
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:28,841
we've got to see what happens.
We got to see what happens with fucking 

737
00:35:28,841 --> 00:35:29,050
Cain Velasquez.
Cain Velasquez,

738
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:30,500
a motherfucker.
Whoa.

739
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:33,890
That guy's a frighteningly talented.
Frighteningly talented,

740
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:35,390
and frighteningly dedicated,
you know,

741
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:38,670
incredible technique to and everything.
He is his punches,

742
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,470
his take downs,
his kicks,

743
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:43,740
everything is perfect technique.
There's no fluff in his,

744
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,960
in his technique is no fat.
You know,

745
00:35:45,961 --> 00:35:50,961
there's no like,
excess movement like the way he throws 

746
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:50,961
leg kicks,
Goddamn beautiful.

747
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:53,130
Just perfect technique.
The way throws punches.

748
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:55,560
Same thing.
Everything is perfect technique.

749
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:58,770
His endurance is second to none.
You know,

750
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:01,140
I'm super,
super impressed with Cain Velasquez.

751
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:02,940
I think he's just,
he's amazing.

752
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,560
You know,
the big question is,

753
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,470
does all that amazing cardio and 
technique and,

754
00:36:07,471 --> 00:36:07,820
and,
and,

755
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:12,830
and the discipline,
does that make up for the great white 

756
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:12,830
warrior?

757
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,700
You know,
does it make up for that big fucking 

758
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:16,700
freak of a monster?
Like Brock Lesnar?

759
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,780
You know,
that's an angry mother fucker dude.

760
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:23,930
When a dude beat your ass like you did 
to Frank Mir and then still get to the 

761
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,390
fucking cameras,
start screaming,

762
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:30,900
he's screaming and spits,
coming out of his mouth and his 

763
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:30,900
mouthpiece has fallen out and you're 
like,

764
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,570
what the fuck did you just beat his ass?
And you're still mad.

765
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,190
And then it gets in Frank Mir phase 
fucking talking shit.

766
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,850
And like,
whoa.

767
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,700
Like that's.
That is a guy who's got a lot of pent up

768
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:42,830
shit.
I mean,

769
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:47,870
when you're 290 fucking plus pounds of 
muscle and your bodies covered with 

770
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
swords,
he's got like swords and skulls and 

771
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,690
death.
It's all like axes and swords and 

772
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,121
destruction.
It actually says kill them all and his 

773
00:36:59,121 --> 00:36:59,760
lower back.
He's got a like a tramp stamp that says,

774
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:00,840
kill 'em.

775
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,810
All Eem all.
Whoa,

776
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,890
whoa.
Who's that?

777
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:09,290
Therefore it's a scary fucking dude,
man.

778
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,440
That's a real angry motherfucker.
And it's real interesting to see,

779
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,060
you know,
I would love to.

780
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:18,600
I really want to see him versus fate or 
that is a very,

781
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:23,601
very intriguing fight to me because they
represent such polar opposites in fate 

782
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:25,800
or you have a guidance,
you know,

783
00:37:25,801 --> 00:37:29,310
relatively small heavyweight.
He's just about six feet tall.

784
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,400
He weighs about 2:30
and he's got a considerable amount of 

785
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:34,400
fat on them.
I mean,

786
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,380
I would say like probably at least 20 
pounds of fat.

787
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,710
Like he's got a lot of jiggly fat.
He doesn't try to lose weight at all.

788
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:41,850
You know,
he just says,

789
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,140
I'm a heavy weight.
This is it.

790
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:44,790
This is what I weigh.
I'm going to fight as a heavyweight.

791
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,760
You know,
there's a broad contrast between him,

792
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:50,550
his personality,
he's very stoic.

793
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,770
You,
you never see any expression out of him.

794
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,950
I mean everybody like comments on the 
fact that the dude like never seemed 

795
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:58,350
angry,
never makes a mean face.

796
00:37:58,351 --> 00:38:03,351
Never seen it her,
no matter if he's cut or no matter if 

797
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:03,351
he's got the guy hurt and he's finishing
them off,

798
00:38:03,351 --> 00:38:07,950
he's just got this dead expression.
Whereas Brock Lesner is giant.

799
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,750
Dantic has to cut weight to make to 65.
He's a guy who,

800
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:17,870
you know,
is at the very top of the weight class 

801
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,870
and he's a guy who is just flooded with 
emotion,

802
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,570
flooded with anger,
flooded with expression.

803
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:26,571
I mean he wears,
he is one of those no nonsense 

804
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,450
motherfuckers.
He wears who he is out on his sleeve,

805
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,730
you know,
and he likes to talk a little shit and 

806
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,230
he gets angry at people and he likes to 
swear and you know,

807
00:38:34,231 --> 00:38:39,231
I mean he's,
he likes to stick the bird out the 

808
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:39,231
audience and you know,
when they bloom,

809
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:40,390
fuck you,
you know,

810
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,040
and he's,
he's a totally different dude.

811
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,370
I'd be very curious to see those two 
approaches and see which one would 

812
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,090
ultimately prevail because it's really 
not.

813
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,270
I mean it is fair,
but it's not fair because brock is so 

814
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,661
much goddamn bigger.
Brock is a lean to 65 and when he's 65,

815
00:38:59,081 --> 00:39:00,880
he's cutting a little weight to get down
there.

816
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,370
You know,
he'll drop some waterway,

817
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,120
like maybe 10,
15 pounds,

818
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,320
you know,
to get down.

819
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:06,670
So He's inflated,
you know,

820
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:09,520
well up to like to 80 by the time he 
actually gets into the octagon.

821
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,700
You know,
just solid as a fucking house at two 80,

822
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,560
whereas fader,
you know,

823
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:19,561
at 2:30,
that's 50 pounds less is not nearly as 

824
00:39:19,561 --> 00:39:20,130
solid fader at 2:30
is,

825
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,620
you know,
he's jiggly w,

826
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,010
you know,
it doesn't matter if you connect to your

827
00:39:24,011 --> 00:39:26,320
face,
you know he's a bad ass puncher.

828
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,140
His jujitsu is fantastic.
His grappling is fantastic.

829
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,730
He's great off of his back,
but there's a.

830
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,330
that's a big difference man.
You know,

831
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:39,331
when all things are equal,
and I'm not saying they are skill wise 

832
00:39:39,331 --> 00:39:40,870
because I do not believe they are.
I think Faye doors more skillful and has

833
00:39:40,871 --> 00:39:44,710
more options to win the fight,
but progress so fucking big.

834
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:50,160
He's so much bigger when you're talking 
about 50 pounds of bone and muscle 50 

835
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:54,160
fucking pounds.
That's a significant advantage.

836
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:57,070
And then on top of that you're dealing 
with a guy who's this freak athlete,

837
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,680
you know,
it's not just that he's big like big and

838
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:04,681
lumbering.
Like they've had guys that were big and 

839
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:04,681
lumbering dudes that have fought in mma 
before.

840
00:40:04,681 --> 00:40:06,520
They just,
they were never like this motherfucker.

841
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:09,130
The way brock moves,
he moves like a light guy,

842
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:12,220
even though he's a giant guy.
He's a freak athlete,

843
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,270
you know,
I mean,

844
00:40:13,271 --> 00:40:17,350
he really is the descendants of some 
fucking crazy warrior tribe.

845
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,980
That's why he's got all this,
you know,

846
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,160
angry energy to them.
That's shit's genetic.

847
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:26,670
A lot of it got to be.
So that's my answer to that question.

848
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,140
Alright.
That was the going off of

849
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:37,180
the Ustream Shit.
So I don't want to go to the Joe Rogan 

850
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,430
Dot net forum.
Yeah.

851
00:40:41,431 --> 00:40:45,570
We'll see what kind of questions we got 
up in that bitch.

852
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Got Two pages of questions and a lot of 
them were joke questions.

853
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,110
Jokey,
jokey joke.

854
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,460
Bb.
John says,

855
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,780
Hey Joe,
what do you know?

856
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:03,880
Wow.

857
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:07,670
Is that a rhetorical question?
I know.

858
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:08,870
Uh,
I know.

859
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,790
I know.
Not enough my friend.

860
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,230
No,
not enough.

861
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:16,880
Nor do any of us.
That is the great unfortunate truth.

862
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:25,420
Let's see.
How do you feel about the pope knowing 

863
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,820
that child sex abuse was going on and he
didn't say anything about it when he was

864
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:33,200
a priest in Germany?
I think they're all fucking freaks.

865
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,250
I think there's

866
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,280
only one way you can be a guy who 
dedicates her entire life to not having 

867
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:42,650
sex.
The only way is you're a sexual deviant.

868
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,920
There's something wrong with you.
I don't believe there's any priest that 

869
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,051
aren't really completely fucked up.
I think it's one of the craziest ways 

870
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:53,420
that anyone could ever make,
make a living,

871
00:41:53,421 --> 00:41:55,850
get through life.
It doesn't make any sense to me.

872
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,100
You're a,
you're a fucking priest,

873
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,520
so wait a minute.
Do you get to a different heaven than 

874
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:03,520
the people that get posted and get to 
have a good time?

875
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,670
No,
you get to the same heaven,

876
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:10,090
so by doing what you do,
what everybody has to listen to you and 

877
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:10,310
give you money and you get to fuck the 
kids.

878
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:15,430
Like what is that about?
It doesn't make any sense because it 

879
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,830
totally goes against what the idea of 
religion should be all about.

880
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:23,830
Religion should be all about.
It's like God's word to everyone on how 

881
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,360
to live your life.
Why did.

882
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:26,720
How come these guys that spread God's 
word,

883
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,000
they don't get to have sex.
What's that about?

884
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,140
Why?
Why do they?

885
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,640
Why?
Why are they so fucked up?

886
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:36,790
I'll tell you why.
Because initially preset too much 

887
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,790
goddamn power.
You know,

888
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,480
a long time ago,
priests were allowed to have sex,

889
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,870
but the problem was they were fucking 
everyone because those are the guys that

890
00:42:41,871 --> 00:42:44,840
were in charge of God.
Those were the guys that were talking to

891
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:46,970
God.
Those were the guys that were.

892
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:50,830
They were at the front of the fucking 
God line.

893
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,960
They had the Willy Wonka golden ticket 
and they were reading the word of God 

894
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,580
and in a village,
you know of several hundred people,

895
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:03,581
the guy who's the fucking priest who 
speaks the word of God and has to 

896
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,570
console all these women and you know 
maybe these women there with husbands 

897
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:10,930
that are tired of fucking him and this 
priest would love to take step in and 

898
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:10,930
take some of that.

899
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,070
What's up?
I'll give you some God knowledge.

900
00:43:13,071 --> 00:43:16,580
Now you give me some head and that shit 
was going on left and right.

901
00:43:16,581 --> 00:43:18,380
And that's why priest camp.
Fuck.

902
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:23,650
The reason why priests aren't a lot of 
fuck is because they were fucking 

903
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:23,650
everybody.
So then,

904
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:24,570
well,
who the hell wants to be present?

905
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,970
You can't fuck.
You know?

906
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,510
Once they told him they couldn't fuck 
anymore,

907
00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:32,530
what did they do while they probably 
some of them probably kept fucking and 

908
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:32,530
said,
yeah,

909
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:32,530
yeah,
I'll stop.

910
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,060
And they kept banging people.
Then they got caught and they probably 

911
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:37,060
got flogged or something terrible like 
that.

912
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,830
And so then they really cracked down and
made sure that the priests are not 

913
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:41,830
allowed to have sex anymore.
Well,

914
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:46,061
once they started doing that,
then the only people that want to be 

915
00:43:46,061 --> 00:43:48,911
priests were either gays who could be 
with other priests and they just keep it

916
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:54,251
on the sneak,
sneak and bag each other or pedophiles 

917
00:43:54,251 --> 00:43:54,350
because they had access to all these 
children.

918
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:59,030
These children had listened to them.
The overwhelming amount,

919
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:04,390
I mean just,
it hurts your head to think about how 

920
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:06,830
many fucking kids had been sexually 
abused by the Catholic Church.

921
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,800
I mean,
it really hurts your head.

922
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:15,190
It really hurts to think that all these 
people are so blinded by a fucking fairy

923
00:44:15,711 --> 00:44:20,711
tale,
that they're willing to let some 

924
00:44:20,711 --> 00:44:22,361
criminal,
some monster fuck their kids after all 

925
00:44:22,361 --> 00:44:26,711
these years.
The fact that that is still going on 

926
00:44:26,711 --> 00:44:30,160
that is mind boggling.
It is mind boggling that we pay any 

927
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,540
attention to this silly caught and no 
one can save this.

928
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:38,541
No politician can say this because for 
sure no one's going to vote for you if 

929
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:41,460
you come out and say this is nonsense 
and if there is a god for sure.

930
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:44,160
These are not his words.
This is the word of man.

931
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,190
How the.
I mean if you just analyze religion.

932
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,250
I mean just as.
I mean let's let's say that once upon a 

933
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:53,340
time it was word of the word of God.
Who the fuck knows?

934
00:44:53,341 --> 00:44:54,450
I don't know.
You don't know.

935
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:55,920
I mean,
if there really is a god,

936
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,950
I always say that I've done things that 
were so much crazier than the stories 

937
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,971
that people tell about heaven.
When you smoke DMT and you've 

938
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:08,540
communicated and another dimension with 
beings that are made out of love and 

939
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,110
understanding and they're.
They're super knowledgeable.

940
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:12,180
They know everything about life and 
everything about you.

941
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:17,300
When you've seen something like that and
someone wants to talk to you and tell 

942
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:17,300
you that they've seen,
you know,

943
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:21,410
a guy in the cloud with a harp and who 
are you to tell him that he's full of 

944
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:24,471
shit.
You're talking about something that 

945
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:24,471
you've actually experienced that I've 
actually experienced.

946
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,990
It's way more fucking crazy than angels 
with wings and a dude in the clouds with

947
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:29,970
a big book of who gets in and who 
doesn't.

948
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:35,330
That's way less crazy than the things 
that I've actually experienced and this 

949
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:37,680
thing that you actually experienced when
you die.

950
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:42,681
This dmt to stuff that when you die,
this is what your brain produces when 

951
00:45:42,681 --> 00:45:47,451
you're in heavy rem sleep.
This is what your brain produces a 

952
00:45:47,451 --> 00:45:49,911
natural part of human neurochemistry and
it lets you see something way crazier 

953
00:45:49,911 --> 00:45:50,910
than what these religious people are 
talking about.

954
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,640
So who am I to say that there's no god.
There may be.

955
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,350
Maybe there is a fucking village and the
clouds.

956
00:45:55,351 --> 00:46:00,240
Maybe it's all true,
but just studying the actual words.

957
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,630
If you know the the history of how the 
Bible was made,

958
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:07,740
that the ancient ancient Hebrew,
which will be the original Old Testament

959
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,440
was written in the original Bible,
written ancient Hebrew,

960
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:12,240
was there.
To this day,

961
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,050
they only know three out of four of 
those words for this day,

962
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:21,200
like today,
25 percent of the words in ancient 

963
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Hebrew.

964
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:21,200
They're like,
who the fuck knows?

965
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:26,690
Not only that there was no numbers in 
ancient Hebrew letters doubled as 

966
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,160
numbers,
so like the letter a was also the number

967
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:34,161
one and there was numerical value to 
words that is completely lost in the 

968
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:39,951
translation to Greek and Latin.
Like the word law of the word love and 

969
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:44,550
the word of God have the same numerical 
value and this numerical value,

970
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:49,551
the value of these words.
It's like it was very important to the 

971
00:46:49,551 --> 00:46:49,860
translation of what you know,
what,

972
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,060
what it was,
what was meant.

973
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:56,550
All that is missing.
When they translated that and then 

974
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,210
eventually to English.
All that's missing,

975
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:01,650
and then you got the New Testament,
which is just complete wackiness because

976
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,520
constantine who wasn't even a fucking 
Christian created this,

977
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:08,490
and this is just clearly a ploy to try 
to control people.

978
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:13,610
Constantine got together with a bunch of
bishops and they wrote it all out and 

979
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:14,490
there's stuff that they left in and 
stuff they stick out.

980
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:19,550
So the New Testament,
which is literally made hundreds of 

981
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,550
years after Christ was supposed to be 
dead.

982
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,150
Who the fuck knows what that's all 
about?

983
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:26,450
Who knows?
But only you need to know is the guy 

984
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:26,450
even wrote.
It wasn't even a Christian.

985
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,820
Like right before he died.
He converted unbelieve and you know it 

986
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,261
was.
It was very constantine won and he was 

987
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:33,850
an emperor or you want to control people
and that's what it's best at.

988
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:38,851
It's so good at controlling people that 
you'll let pedophiles fuck your kids 

989
00:47:38,851 --> 00:47:41,140
because they have the fucking,
the magic fairytale golden ticket.

990
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:46,380
It's mind boggling.
It's mind boggling that this goofy fuck 

991
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:49,570
in a crazy outfit.
This cult leader gets special treatment.

992
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,780
They'll make fun of the moonies.
They'll make fun of scientologists,

993
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:57,870
but the fucking pope on TV,
somehow another gets to be national 

994
00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:01,441
news,
this crazy fuck who's not allowed to 

995
00:48:01,441 --> 00:48:04,171
have sex,
who hangs out with a bunch of crazy Fox 

996
00:48:04,171 --> 00:48:05,410
who aren't allowed to have sex and every
rock you fucking pick up.

997
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:07,450
There's a priest fucking a kid 
underneath it.

998
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,720
I mean,
it's just throughout their entire 

999
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,421
organization.
There are thousands and thousands and 

1000
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:18,541
thousands of cases every fucking year.
New ones pop up every fucking year.

1001
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:24,121
Some new scandal about how they knew 
this guy was fucking kids and so they 

1002
00:48:24,121 --> 00:48:25,540
moved him to New Mexico or some shit.
I mean,

1003
00:48:25,541 --> 00:48:30,541
it's really shocking that Catholic 
people are even going to church anymore.

1004
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:35,310
It's completely shocking that there's 
still people that they trick.

1005
00:48:35,530 --> 00:48:40,530
Just the sheer weight of its own 
bullshit should have collapsed the 

1006
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:44,880
Catholic religion a long fucking time 
ago and this is coming from someone who 

1007
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:48,211
was raised a Catholic.
I went to Catholic school when I was in 

1008
00:48:48,211 --> 00:48:51,631
first grade one year I went to Catholic 
school and it was such a fucking 

1009
00:48:51,631 --> 00:48:53,980
horrendous nightmare.
I don't remember second grade,

1010
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:56,650
I don't remember it.
I remember first grade though,

1011
00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:01,770
like a motherfucker,
because first grade was the only year 

1012
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:01,770
that I was in Catholic school.

1013
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,570
I remember this fucking cunt sister Mary
Josephine's is evil,

1014
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:08,200
evil woman who used to tell you that if 
you didn't get your homework done,

1015
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:11,320
you have to sit on a nail in the closet 
overnight.

1016
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,480
She would smack you in the head.
I mean,

1017
00:49:13,481 --> 00:49:15,430
it was real shit.
If you cried,

1018
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:17,620
if you were upset about something,
she would make fun of you.

1019
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,210
You know,
look at it.

1020
00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,940
That's why I'm crying.
She was just no compassion,

1021
00:49:21,941 --> 00:49:24,760
no love,
no friendship,

1022
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:27,700
no warmth.
It was all evil.

1023
00:49:27,701 --> 00:49:31,840
It was all anger and evil and that is 
what that relationship is.

1024
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:34,630
It is unnatural.
It's not real.

1025
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:39,690
This relationship to life where you're a
person who's in charge of some nonsense 

1026
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:44,071
fairytale and because of that you get to
shit on people and yell at their kids 

1027
00:49:44,071 --> 00:49:47,730
and hit their fucking kids and treat 
them like shit because you somehow or 

1028
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:52,591
another are special because you're one 
of those people that doesn't fuck and 

1029
00:49:52,591 --> 00:49:52,790
you have what?

1030
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:55,720
You have more access to God and I know 
you don't even have more access.

1031
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:56,530
You're not.
If anything,

1032
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:01,480
it's the craziest,
most ridiculous cult ever and it's still

1033
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:06,481
going on and if that's not a a damning 
condemnation of human beings and human 

1034
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:10,870
culture today in 2010 with the age of 
information with the Internet,

1035
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:12,850
with all this,
that we still have the Catholic religion

1036
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:15,880
that that stupid shit is still around.
It's mind boggling.

1037
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,540
Without a doubt.
If there is a god that's not what he 

1038
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:21,540
wants.
If there is a god,

1039
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:23,570
what God is is the energy that creates 
everything you know.

1040
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:28,650
It might not be a conscious thing or it 
might be all conscious things together 

1041
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,101
as one thing in some sort of a framework
that we can't even recognize because 

1042
00:50:33,101 --> 00:50:34,580
it's so big.
It's so great that literally,

1043
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:36,080
you know when someone,
some hippie says,

1044
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:38,050
hey,
you are God and God's you would.

1045
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,370
If that's true.
What if that really is true?

1046
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:45,490
What if our purpose on this life has 
shielded us from that recognition 

1047
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:48,140
because we have to go through whatever.
We have to go through it like we're here

1048
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:53,141
for a reason that we're pushing humanity
and human culture and human innovation 

1049
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:54,220
forward for reason,
you know,

1050
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:59,260
probably some sort of fucking,
some sort of a technological thing that 

1051
00:50:59,260 --> 00:50:59,990
we're going to create that's going to 
enter us into the new age.

1052
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:03,770
But if that's the case,
he said that we just lacked a perception

1053
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:05,960
to really understand that we're in tune 
with anything,

1054
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,340
with everything,
with the whole world.

1055
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:12,570
Then that makes sense that everything is
God and that's the feeling that you get 

1056
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,120
when you do mushrooms.
When you do mushrooms,

1057
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:19,300
you get this feeling of connectedness 
that you are attached when you do dmt as

1058
00:51:19,551 --> 00:51:21,930
well,
which is very similar to,

1059
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:24,560
to mushrooms in what it is.

1060
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:29,620
Chemically,
what dmt is his dime methyl tryptamine 

1061
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:33,730
what mushrooms are cubensis mushrooms is
for Fox for a boxy and,

1062
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:37,280
and dimethyltryptamine.
So they're very closely,

1063
00:51:37,281 --> 00:51:39,400
chemically related.
And um,

1064
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,970
you have this intense feeling of 
connection with everything,

1065
00:51:43,971 --> 00:51:46,850
with people you know,
with the friends in your life,

1066
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,050
with animals,
with,

1067
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,500
with wilderness,
with.

1068
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,520
I mean,
that's why they say do mushrooms and go 

1069
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:54,520
into nature.
Because when you do,

1070
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,210
when you have some mushrooms and you're 
laying in a in a,

1071
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:58,010
you know,
I'm in the woods,

1072
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,570
you know,
in a plot of trees you'll,

1073
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,110
you'll like,
you feel like the energy of the trees.

1074
00:52:03,111 --> 00:52:08,111
It's like some Avatar type shit like you
really feel like the fucking tree of is 

1075
00:52:08,111 --> 00:52:11,070
communicating with you.
I think that our,

1076
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:16,120
our main problem as human beings is that
we are in a stage of evolution and we're

1077
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:23,321
in an adolescent stage and we are 
certainly passing where we used to be 

1078
00:52:23,321 --> 00:52:27,851
and our just our potential for evolving 
above the basic fight or flight 

1079
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:32,741
instincts and our potential for evolving
above just just animal brutality and 

1080
00:52:32,871 --> 00:52:37,871
anger and jealousy and all these things 
that we think that we need in order to 

1081
00:52:37,871 --> 00:52:37,871
compete and survive.

1082
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,940
We have potential to rise above that and
that's what yoga is all about and that's

1083
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:48,131
what meditation is all about in 
isolation tanks and people who are a 

1084
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:48,710
psychedelic enthusiasts.
What,

1085
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:53,711
that's what that's all about is this,
this struggle up this slippery slope to 

1086
00:52:55,281 --> 00:53:00,281
get to the top to have just a little 
better view of what the world could be.

1087
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:05,360
And I think that that's what,
that's the potential that we have inside

1088
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:07,700
of us.
It's all moving towards that,

1089
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:10,310
you know,
human understanding,

1090
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,200
human,
the idea of human enlightenment,

1091
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:12,950
you know,
this,

1092
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:17,951
this quest to get your shit together.
It's all moving away from these 

1093
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:22,930
nonsensical animal instincts to 
something higher and more evolved and I 

1094
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:28,020
think that potential is the only good 
thing that human beings have.

1095
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,830
It's like we have this potential for one
side or the other.

1096
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:33,890
We have this potential to be like,
you know,

1097
00:53:33,891 --> 00:53:38,550
like an evil government that corrupts 
citizens or we have this potential to be

1098
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,300
a brother.

1099
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:44,420
We have this potential to be a sister.
We have to potentially be someone who 

1100
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,170
loves you.
Like they love family life.

1101
00:53:45,171 --> 00:53:46,950
They love themselves,
you know?

1102
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:48,930
I mean,
I have a buddy that as a kid,

1103
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:52,620
and we were talking about babies 
recently and we were just joking around.

1104
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:57,621
He's a comic as well.
Gene Pompa last night at the Improv and 

1105
00:53:57,621 --> 00:54:02,211
we're just talking about,
and I've had this conversation with 

1106
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:02,280
other people too about how it makes you 
like so much nicer person.

1107
00:54:02,580 --> 00:54:03,750
And I said that like,
man,

1108
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:08,751
if everybody treated everybody the way I
treat my daughter would have fucking 

1109
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:12,800
beautiful world we would live in,
would just be a world of warmth and 

1110
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,220
friendship.
And you know,

1111
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,850
if we just had a pill that made you love
everybody the way I love my daughter and

1112
00:54:17,851 --> 00:54:19,620
we do have a pill like that.
It's called ecstasy.

1113
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,240
But that's,
it's terrible for you.

1114
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,910
And the next day you feel like shit and 
it hurts your head.

1115
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,260
But,
um,

1116
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:29,340
if we figured out a way and maybe we're 
going to do that,

1117
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,430
I mean maybe that's what the next stage 
of evolution really is all about.

1118
00:54:32,431 --> 00:54:34,530
Maybe it's an evolution pill,
you know,

1119
00:54:34,531 --> 00:54:35,260
maybe,
uh,

1120
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:40,290
you know,
some people will take the evolution 

1121
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:41,841
vaccine and some people won't and 
they'll shoot your arm with some shit 

1122
00:54:41,841 --> 00:54:45,471
that lasts six months and it's some 
vaccination against stupidity.

1123
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,130
Some vaccination against against 
nonsense,

1124
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:54,180
against a lack of understanding and 
appreciation of the fact that we're here

1125
00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:57,780
in this temporary situation as one 
gigantic hive,

1126
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:00,480
one super organism,
one super organism,

1127
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:02,520
and that the more love you spread out 
in,

1128
00:55:02,521 --> 00:55:05,370
the more positive energy you spread out,
the more you get back,

1129
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,190
you know,
the more it comes back to affect you and

1130
00:55:08,191 --> 00:55:10,680
it goes out and ripples because the 
people that you affect,

1131
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:15,681
they affect other people as well and the
more positive you spread out of 

1132
00:55:15,681 --> 00:55:16,380
literally you can change your world.

1133
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,440
You can change the world of the people 
that you come in contact with.

1134
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:25,100
You know,
I think that is what human beings are 

1135
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:25,980
slowly starting to realize and that may 
be what God really is,

1136
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,780
what God might be,
is everything.

1137
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:32,100
What it's not is a bunch of dudes in 
fucking robes that want to have sex with

1138
00:55:32,101 --> 00:55:33,300
your kids.
Okay,

1139
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,550
that's not God.
That's nonsense.

1140
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:40,670
And the fact that these fucking 
presidential candidates and all these 

1141
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,810
knuckleheads that want to be world 
leaders and they want to guide us 

1142
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:44,810
towards,
you know,

1143
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,380
the.
They're not guiding us towards anything.

1144
00:55:46,381 --> 00:55:51,381
It's business as usual.
There's no evolution whatsoever in the 

1145
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,681
political process.
There's no evolution whatsoever amongst 

1146
00:55:54,681 --> 00:55:57,591
these fuckheads that talk.
They are decades and decades behind the 

1147
00:55:57,591 --> 00:56:00,990
Progressive American culture that the 
people that are at the front of the line

1148
00:56:00,991 --> 00:56:03,840
of thinking,
these motherfuckers are decades behind.

1149
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,880
You know,
this idea of religious freedom.

1150
00:56:05,881 --> 00:56:07,050
Yes,
I agree.

1151
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:12,200
Yes,
you should have the freedom to study 

1152
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,001
religiously.
You should have the freedom to do 

1153
00:56:14,001 --> 00:56:16,101
whatever you want.
You don't feed the flying Spaghetti 

1154
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:16,101
Monster.
That's your thing.

1155
00:56:16,101 --> 00:56:16,490
That's fine.
You know,

1156
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,320
but you can't take it seriously like 
you,

1157
00:56:21,321 --> 00:56:24,370
you,
you can't expect someone who is.

1158
00:56:24,371 --> 00:56:26,470
I mean that.
That is the whole idea of the separation

1159
00:56:26,471 --> 00:56:31,471
of church and state.
The whole idea is like some sort of a 

1160
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,190
concede conceding somehow that,
okay,

1161
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:35,410
you're allowed to believe really 
ridiculous shit.

1162
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,190
How about this?
How about we just leave all the religion

1163
00:56:38,191 --> 00:56:41,560
now and all we concentrate on is how 
things are run business,

1164
00:56:41,561 --> 00:56:43,930
how we treat each other,
what laws we enforce,

1165
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,240
how you make sure that people aren't 
being victimized.

1166
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,820
These fucking politicians and these 
newspapers and all these people that,

1167
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:53,170
that really follow all this pope 
bullshit.

1168
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,320
They just add credence to it because 
knuckleheads read about in the news.

1169
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:01,380
So they think it's legitimate.
I had a conversation with someone where 

1170
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:01,380
they were saying that,
you know,

1171
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:01,380
that um,
uh,

1172
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,460
we were talking about cults and I said,
well,

1173
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,580
I was watching a documentary and it's 
really fascinating.

1174
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:10,590
Was a documentary on Christianity and 
they kept referring it to the cult of 

1175
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:15,301
Christianity.
That's how they're referring it to in 

1176
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:15,301
this,
you know,

1177
00:57:15,301 --> 00:57:16,120
the very scientific documentary.
And this woman was very upset.

1178
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,500
She was like,
Christianity is not called.

1179
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,730
And I'm like,
why?

1180
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,650
How can you say it's not cool?
And she's like,

1181
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:21,820
well,
because first of all,

1182
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,130
you don't have a cult that has billions 
of people in it.

1183
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,720
Yes you do.
But it's just a bigger call.

1184
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,520
Like if you ever caught that as three 
people,

1185
00:57:30,521 --> 00:57:33,160
if you can trick three people,
you can trick 3 million.

1186
00:57:33,161 --> 00:57:35,500
Okay?
If you can find three people dumb enough

1187
00:57:35,501 --> 00:57:37,960
to believe your wackiness and they let 
you fuck them.

1188
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:41,080
And they were purple Nike's because you 
tell them that's the sacred color.

1189
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:44,710
If you get three people to do that and 
they really believe it,

1190
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,090
they're going to get more people to 
believe it.

1191
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,750
We are all going through this life 
completely clueless.

1192
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:54,780
These we are like people in a spaceship 
that woke up from hyper sleep and we're 

1193
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,630
going through the manuals and no one 
knows how to run the ship.

1194
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,690
That's what we are alike and there's a 
few of us that are older that are 

1195
00:58:03,690 --> 00:58:04,420
pretending to the younger people.
Listen,

1196
00:58:04,421 --> 00:58:05,680
don't worry,
we've got this.

1197
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:06,970
Everything's going to be fine.

1198
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:09,790
We're going to have a meeting with 
Congress to work on this house and these

1199
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:14,791
people are trying to placate the rest of
us who are just like them and no one 

1200
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,040
knows what the fuck is going on.
So anybody that steps up and tells you 

1201
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:24,331
that they have all the answers,
that God wants this for you and God 

1202
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:24,331
wants that.
No,

1203
00:58:24,331 --> 00:58:25,600
you don't know.
Those are the enemy.

1204
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:28,570
Anybody that says they have the answers,
they're your enemy.

1205
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,990
And anybody who wants your money,
they're your enemy to you.

1206
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:33,970
You know,
give me a fucking show.

1207
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:38,971
All right,
don't just stand there and recite some 

1208
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:41,371
stupid Latin Shit and pass around a 
basket because you're too lazy to work 

1209
00:58:41,371 --> 00:58:41,830
for a living.
You Fuck No.

1210
00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:44,080
If you,
if you want to be the real messenger,

1211
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:46,090
the word of God,
you wouldn't be asking for money.

1212
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,990
Okay?
Stop it.

1213
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:48,940
People would be giving my new because 
they love you.

1214
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:54,030
You wouldn't have a fucking basket.
You pass around and make everybody feel 

1215
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,030
guilty.
Fuck you.

1216
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,360
That's,
that's nonsense.

1217
00:58:55,361 --> 00:58:57,130
That's silly,
goddamn nonsense.

1218
00:58:57,131 --> 00:59:02,131
And until we acknowledge that,
until we acknowledge that that is our 

1219
00:59:02,131 --> 00:59:03,760
own insecurities that are asking us to 
search for an answer to something that's

1220
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:06,190
impossible to answer,
to acknowledge that we're fucked,

1221
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:08,410
we're just spinning.
Our wheels were in the same spot.

1222
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:09,640
We've always been,
you know,

1223
00:59:09,641 --> 00:59:14,641
and that that is the problem.
The real problem is everybody wants to 

1224
00:59:14,641 --> 00:59:16,090
pretend that there's an answer to 
something that you cannot answer.

1225
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,700
There is no answer.
It is absolutely impossible.

1226
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:21,440
And if,
if there is a god,

1227
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:26,800
it's probably so much more complex than 
you could ever possibly wrap your 

1228
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:28,070
fucking head around.
And I'll tell you what,

1229
00:59:28,071 --> 00:59:29,390
it's not,
it's not,

1230
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,860
uh,
Adam and eve,

1231
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:31,340
okay.

1232
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:34,100
It's not God made to people and you 
know,

1233
00:59:34,101 --> 00:59:39,101
they fucked and they had kids and the 
kids started fucking each other because 

1234
00:59:39,101 --> 00:59:39,230
that's what Adam and eve is.
There's only two people.

1235
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:44,470
He just one of the.
That's like any child with a simple 

1236
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:46,700
grasp of mathematics and five minutes to
think about it,

1237
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:47,510
you'd say,
okay,

1238
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:49,160
I'm going to tell you the story of Adam 
and eve.

1239
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,020
You tell me what you think is wrong with
that.

1240
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,550
They would go,
okay,

1241
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:55,250
if Adam and eve made people,
everybody came from Adam and eve,

1242
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,640
everybody the whole world.
Okay.

1243
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,080
If Adam and eve made people.
So they had kids and the kids were like,

1244
01:00:00,081 --> 01:00:03,410
they were brothers and sisters.
How did they make more people?

1245
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:06,800
There we go.
No,

1246
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:09,350
they fucked each other.
They fucked each other.

1247
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:14,630
The Adam fuck the kids.
And he fucked the kids and the kids 

1248
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:15,200
fucked each other.
And that's where people came from.

1249
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,260
What?
It's 2010.

1250
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,560
No one has any fucking answer.
No one got damaged except maybe 

1251
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:33,161
Gangstarr gangstarr has got the answer.
So that's my long answer to a short 

1252
01:00:47,961 --> 01:00:49,760
question.
Fuck the pope.

1253
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:55,090
Fuck all those dummies.
Fuck anybody that tells you they've got 

1254
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:55,090
it wired.
No,

1255
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:55,460
no,
no,

1256
01:00:55,461 --> 01:00:56,480
stupid.
No.

1257
01:00:56,481 --> 01:00:59,420
You don't have it wired and you got to 
get a real job now.

1258
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:01,160
Okay.
It's 2010.

1259
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:04,130
If the whole world got on mushrooms,
the Catholic religion would implode.

1260
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:09,190
Okay.
They would have to go out and start 

1261
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:09,190
kidnapping kids to fuck because nobody 
would bring their kids to him anymore.

1262
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:10,030
You know,
it's,

1263
01:01:10,031 --> 01:01:13,490
it's a corrupt criminal organization of 
kid fuckers.

1264
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:14,810
That's what it is.

1265
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,350
Do I have any idea how last dance?
No,

1266
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:21,610
those fucks I.
I been trying to not tune in.

1267
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:25,790
I'm going to be on Adam Carolla's 
podcast real soon,

1268
01:01:25,791 --> 01:01:26,600
I think next week.

1269
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:32,850
Actually.
I'll tell you right now because I'm on 

1270
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:32,850
the fucking Internet.
Harlow.

1271
01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,040
I liked them apples.
I love the Internet.

1272
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:41,070
It's easily my favorite human creation.
I'm so addicted and it's killing my 

1273
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:45,481
vision.
I have a hard time reading things when 

1274
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:45,490
they're up close now.
Okay.

1275
01:01:45,491 --> 01:01:50,490
Let's say had a corolla.
Yes.

1276
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,250
Next week.
The 23rd.

1277
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,530
So next Tuesday,
the 23rd,

1278
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:59,790
I'll be doing the Adam Carolla podcast.
However,

1279
01:01:59,791 --> 01:02:04,200
I don't know exactly what time the 
podcast.

1280
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,170
I'm a one time,
he puts it up.

1281
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:13,550
So that's my answer to that,
but I'll be doing it next Tuesday,

1282
01:02:13,951 --> 01:02:14,860
the 23rd.
All right.

1283
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,110
More questions

1284
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,700
bad.
Bobby says,

1285
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,930
Joe,
I once read,

1286
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:30,000
if they legalized all drugs it could 
cost the USA 150,000

1287
01:02:30,001 --> 01:02:33,120
good jobs and cops,
lawyers and so forth.

1288
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:38,360
I don't know if it's true,
but I believed the war on drugs is a 

1289
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:41,241
makeup make work project.
Forget about if they're getting some 

1290
01:02:41,241 --> 01:02:41,880
profits and selling them.
I don't know if it's true,

1291
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:42,520
but it sounded right.
Yeah,

1292
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:47,570
there's definitely though.
The war on drugs is definitely look the 

1293
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:52,250
between the private prisons and between 
a law enforcement.

1294
01:02:52,531 --> 01:02:57,531
There's an industry and keeping drugs 
illegal and it's not about protecting 

1295
01:02:57,531 --> 01:02:58,770
you.
You know some drugs.

1296
01:02:58,771 --> 01:02:59,430
Yes,
it is.

1297
01:02:59,431 --> 01:03:01,650
You know when,
when they go and close down crystal meth

1298
01:03:01,651 --> 01:03:02,820
labs.
Yeah.

1299
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,970
That's a fucking danger because crystal 
meth makes people.

1300
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,940
It completely fucks with their judgment.
Makes them insane.

1301
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:14,150
Liquid did the Jesse James.
He fucked that bitch with a tattoo on 

1302
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,150
her head.

1303
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,150
I guarantee that dude was doing meth 
when he fucked her.

1304
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:19,220
There's no way he was sober.
You don't fuck chicks with tattoos on 

1305
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:22,731
their head when you're sober.
When you see ambition has pray for 

1306
01:03:22,731 --> 01:03:22,830
sinners tattooed on her fucking 
forehead.

1307
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:24,540
You Go,
what?

1308
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:26,790
And she's ugly.
Oh yeah.

1309
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:29,160
Let me stick my Ra Dick Inside.
You know,

1310
01:03:29,161 --> 01:03:31,410
that guy was doing drugs and there's 
drugs that are bad for you.

1311
01:03:31,411 --> 01:03:33,390
Okay.
And Crystal Meth is one of them and said

1312
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:34,530
terrible,
terrible drug,

1313
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,240
you know,
is another one.

1314
01:03:36,241 --> 01:03:41,241
I mean,
I've seen cocaine turn people into 

1315
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:41,241
their,
like they become like,

1316
01:03:41,241 --> 01:03:42,450
like roaches.
They become like bugs,

1317
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,570
you know that like they don't,
they don't thinking about human and just

1318
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:47,580
trying to get that shit.
I don't like get that shit.

1319
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,160
You know?
They literally get black sharp guys.

1320
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:51,900
They turn dead on the inside.
Man.

1321
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:55,830
There's drugs that are terrible for you 
and those drugs.

1322
01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:00,830
Yeah.
I could see an argument for them being 

1323
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:02,841
illegal.
I could see an argument for us doing 

1324
01:04:02,841 --> 01:04:03,440
something about the people that sell 
them because they're,

1325
01:04:03,441 --> 01:04:05,670
they're damaging people.
It's dangerous,

1326
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:09,540
but there's other drugs like mushrooms 
and pot.

1327
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,100
If you get caught with those things,
man,

1328
01:04:11,101 --> 01:04:13,560
it doesn't matter.
Those are still illegal drugs.

1329
01:04:13,830 --> 01:04:16,110
As a matter of fact,
they're more illegal than heroin.

1330
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,230
Do you know that?
Schedule One drugs for the most part are

1331
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:23,760
the drugs that really have like use 
schedule one is the most illegal.

1332
01:04:23,761 --> 01:04:26,610
Okay?
Schedule One is DMT,

1333
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,520
which your own brain produces.
So as Terence Mckenna,

1334
01:04:29,521 --> 01:04:30,720
he said,
he said,

1335
01:04:30,721 --> 01:04:31,950
uh,
everyone's holding.

1336
01:04:32,310 --> 01:04:33,330
I mean,
that's really,

1337
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:35,420
really what it is.
You are in production,

1338
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:40,640
in production and in you.
You are in possession of a really 

1339
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:44,610
illegal substance.
The number one to schedule one,

1340
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:47,610
dmt a marijuana schedule.
One.

1341
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,050
No one's ever died.

1342
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:50,710
Pot ever.
Do you know what?

1343
01:04:50,711 --> 01:04:52,790
It can't.
The only way pot is going to kill you is

1344
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,590
if you're standing on the wrong side of 
the fence.

1345
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,870
When one of those Mexican drug 
helicopters comes over and pushes a bail

1346
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:02,260
out at clubs you on the fucking head,
that's how you die for pot.

1347
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,320
Other than that,
you're not going to die for pot.

1348
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:06,690
You might think you're dying,
but you're just gonna fall asleep.

1349
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,850
And you're going to be fine.
No one's fucking died of it ever,

1350
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,880
but yet still pot is scheduled.
One mushrooms,

1351
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:16,910
same thing.
I've never heard of anybody dying for 

1352
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:16,910
mushrooms.
You can definitely dive.

1353
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:20,331
You eat poison mushrooms,
but poison buffered by the way are 

1354
01:05:20,331 --> 01:05:22,801
illegal and you could have poisoned 
mushrooms all around your backyard and 

1355
01:05:22,801 --> 01:05:23,800
you can munch on them all day and 
fucking die of a heart attack and nobody

1356
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:24,370
gives a shit.

1357
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:27,270
No one's going to have a.
it's not going to be a big inquest.

1358
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,260
No one's going to go crazy.
But if you,

1359
01:05:29,261 --> 01:05:34,261
if you put psilocybin mushrooms in your 
yard and the cops come and find them 

1360
01:05:34,261 --> 01:05:36,790
growing in your yard,
they will lock you in a fucking cage.

1361
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:40,210
Even though psilocybin mushrooms,
they can make you go crazy if you do too

1362
01:05:40,211 --> 01:05:45,211
many of them.
And if you have a weak mental 

1363
01:05:45,211 --> 01:05:47,431
constitution,
I could see you going crazy for 

1364
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:47,431
mushrooms.
Just too much information,

1365
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:50,650
too much realization.
But you could go crazy from anything.

1366
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,010
You can go crazy from paint.
You know you could,

1367
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:54,710
you could have pain,
you know,

1368
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,840
sniff pain,
blow your fucking brains out.

1369
01:05:56,870 --> 01:05:58,990
You can go crazy for anything and 
there's a lot,

1370
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,410
some people are weak and fragile and 
there's uh,

1371
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,030
any really extreme experience can fuck 
them up.

1372
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:05,850
There's an ant that,
uh,

1373
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:07,950
I think it's called an iron and I forget
the name of the amt,

1374
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,960
but this ant bites you and the venom is 
so intense and horrify that it's been 

1375
01:06:13,841 --> 01:06:18,841
described as slamming your arm into a 
car door for an hour.

1376
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,410
That's what it feels like.
Just slamming your arm.

1377
01:06:23,590 --> 01:06:27,040
Imagine what that would feel like.
And it lasts for 24 hours.

1378
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,400
What?
So this intense,

1379
01:06:30,401 --> 01:06:31,450
insane,
throbbing.

1380
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:33,550
Like literally you're getting ripped 
apart,

1381
01:06:33,551 --> 01:06:38,551
like someone slamming a door on your arm
and it lasts a whole day and the 

1382
01:06:38,551 --> 01:06:42,040
experience is so traumatic that some 
people when they come out of it,

1383
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:47,041
they are never the same again.
They're just a shell there just so 

1384
01:06:47,041 --> 01:06:50,371
fucked up.
They could not get through the pain of 

1385
01:06:50,371 --> 01:06:53,551
one full 24 hour period.
The like there's some shit in the world 

1386
01:06:53,551 --> 01:06:54,220
that could fuck you up.
Okay.

1387
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:58,450
That's not why marijuana is illegal.
That's not what mushrooms are illegal.

1388
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:01,840
They're illegal because they're trying 
to keep you from them.

1389
01:07:01,841 --> 01:07:06,841
They don't want,
they don't want a society that is 

1390
01:07:06,841 --> 01:07:08,140
questioning leadership.
They don't want a society.

1391
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,540
And that's the other problem.
The people that are in power,

1392
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,080
they're not using these things 
throughout human history.

1393
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:19,290
Shamans have been the leaders of tribes 
and Shamans have been the ones that the 

1394
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:23,320
tribe will go to when the tribe has 
troubles and what the Shamans are,

1395
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,440
where people who had a lot of experience
and navigating psychedelic dimensions 

1396
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:32,600
and in the Amazon,
when you know,

1397
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:35,200
they would all sit around and drink 
IOWASCA.

1398
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:37,060
Iowasca is a,
uh,

1399
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:40,180
an herb,
a like a tea that they brew with that,

1400
01:07:40,210 --> 01:07:42,880
that produces dmt.
And it's uh,

1401
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:43,410
the,
uh,

1402
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:48,420
ordinarily DMT is not.
You can't drink it because it gets 

1403
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:49,930
broken down when you take it in orally.
When you eat it,

1404
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:55,270
it gets broken down by something in your
stomach called monell aiming oxidase and

1405
01:07:55,271 --> 01:08:00,271
it's produced in your gut.
And this Iowasca was a way that they 

1406
01:08:00,271 --> 01:08:05,191
figured out how to extract DMT and Amano
aiming oxidase inhibitor from another 

1407
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:08,260
planet.
It's really fucking crazy.

1408
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,940
I mean,
they've been doing this for 10,000

1409
01:08:09,941 --> 01:08:14,941
years and a place where there's 250,000
plus different species of plants.

1410
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,200
They figured out a way to combine two to
make this incredible brew that lets you 

1411
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,671
communicate with,
with the afterlife and which by the way 

1412
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:25,310
is totally illegal.
You know?

1413
01:08:25,311 --> 01:08:28,250
I mean,
it's a mess.

1414
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,410
You know,
it's,

1415
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:31,880
it's,
it's a real fucking mess.

1416
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,430
When,
when you start think about what would it

1417
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:39,431
really is because what it really is is 
people keeping other people from having 

1418
01:08:39,431 --> 01:08:42,890
an experience and the reasoning for it.
The reason why is not because they think

1419
01:08:42,891 --> 01:08:47,891
that this person,
if they have that experience going to 

1420
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:47,891
make life difficult for me,
they're going to come after me.

1421
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:49,310
They're going to hurt my family.
No,

1422
01:08:49,430 --> 01:08:54,430
they're doing it because they can profit
off this person not having that 

1423
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,850
experience.
If I say that something is illegal and I

1424
01:08:55,851 --> 01:09:00,851
set forth laws and I say,
if you cross this boundary and you do 

1425
01:09:00,851 --> 01:09:00,920
this behavior and you,
you know,

1426
01:09:01,130 --> 01:09:04,220
you violate my law,
I get to lock you in a cage.

1427
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:07,850
I get to make money from locking you in.
Occasionally that I get to employ people

1428
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:11,840
that will now they have a job and their 
job is to go after people that are doing

1429
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:16,841
what I said they couldn't do and get 
them and kidnap them and put them in a 

1430
01:09:16,841 --> 01:09:18,500
cage.
That's what you're having with marijuana

1431
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:20,700
and mushroom bust and stuff like that.
You're.

1432
01:09:20,930 --> 01:09:23,990
You're telling someone that you buy your
judgment,

1433
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,690
they shouldn't have that experience,
and so you say,

1434
01:09:26,691 --> 01:09:31,691
well,
if you're going to make such an extreme 

1435
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:31,691
judgment,
that judgment has to be based on facts,

1436
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:31,691
right?
No,

1437
01:09:31,691 --> 01:09:32,720
no.
It doesn't have to be based on facts.

1438
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:37,750
Of course it doesn't because of it was 
then marijuana would have been legal in 

1439
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:41,741
the 19 fifties.
I mean it would've been legal in the 

1440
01:09:41,741 --> 01:09:44,320
when when they passed the sweeping 
schedule One psychedelics act of 1970,

1441
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:45,290
I believe it was.

1442
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:47,540
When they made everything illegal,
they would have.

1443
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,140
They would have had to provide some 
reasoning for making mushrooms illegal.

1444
01:09:51,141 --> 01:09:56,141
Some reasoning for making marijuana 
illegal and it would've been scientific 

1445
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:59,471
and it would have been medical,
but the problem is every single fucking 

1446
01:09:59,471 --> 01:10:01,781
medical study that's ever been done 
about marijuana shows that it's 

1447
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:01,781
relatively harmless.
I mean,

1448
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:06,341
you can ruin your life with anything.
You can ruin your life with 

1449
01:10:06,341 --> 01:10:08,110
cheeseburgers if you want to.
Like I was talking about like bottles,

1450
01:10:08,130 --> 01:10:13,130
you could take a bottle and bottles can 
hold a nice delicious drink or you can 

1451
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,311
take a bottle and you can stuff it up 
your ass and throw yourself down a 

1452
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:19,031
flight of stairs and bleed to death.
It doesn't mean that bottle should be 

1453
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:21,491
illegal.
The real fucking problem is that we are 

1454
01:10:21,491 --> 01:10:24,761
allowing people to victimize other 
people for profit and that's what the 

1455
01:10:24,761 --> 01:10:29,051
war on drugs is all about and the reason
why the war on drugs works at all is 

1456
01:10:29,051 --> 01:10:31,100
because the people responsible to cops 
and the lawyers,

1457
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:32,090
they're not doing drugs.

1458
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,340
If they were doing drugs,
if they were doing the right drugs,

1459
01:10:34,341 --> 01:10:36,110
they are doing mushrooms and they were 
smoking pot.

1460
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,090
There would be nothing.
It would all stop.

1461
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:40,790
They would have to stop.
If you do the correct amount of mushroom

1462
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:45,791
dose,
you would realize that in victimizing 

1463
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:45,791
people,
you are victimizing yourself.

1464
01:10:45,791 --> 01:10:47,660
You are creating a terrible stream of 
Karma.

1465
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:50,180
You are,
you are ruining lives for nothing.

1466
01:10:50,210 --> 01:10:55,210
You were ruining lives for something 
that doesn't have anything to do with 

1467
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:58,031
you and something that's been around in 
terms of for marijuana and mushrooms and

1468
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:01,670
Iowasca tens of thousands of years of 
human use.

1469
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,740
And as I said,
in those indigenous cultures,

1470
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:06,380
the Shaman was the one who made the 
decisions.

1471
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,230
That's because this is the guy that had 
the most experience and these,

1472
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:12,530
these matters of the spirit world.
We don't have that anymore.

1473
01:11:12,531 --> 01:11:17,531
Now we have opposite.
We have leaders that if we find out 

1474
01:11:17,531 --> 01:11:17,760
they're doing mushrooms,
would be shocked.

1475
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,920
We would,
we would want them removed from office.

1476
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,800
If Obama had a press conference on 
Monday and said,

1477
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,250
I got together with my wife the other 
day.

1478
01:11:26,251 --> 01:11:28,280
We did five grams of mushrooms and,
uh,

1479
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:31,290
we went to the mountains and I really 
started thinking about our country.

1480
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,650
Everybody be like,
what the fuck are you talking about?

1481
01:11:35,100 --> 01:11:38,670
That would be the most beautiful thing 
that he could ever say if he could say,

1482
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:43,671
I just took something that allowed me to
literally tune into the stream of love.

1483
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:48,150
That is God,
that is the energy of the universe,

1484
01:11:48,151 --> 01:11:53,151
that is mother Gaia.
I connected myself to all of that is 

1485
01:11:53,151 --> 01:11:55,920
loving in the world and I came back with
some revelations and some thoughts about

1486
01:11:55,921 --> 01:12:00,921
how we can lead our culture better,
how we can be kinder to the rest of the 

1487
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:01,260
world,
how instead of going all these places to

1488
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:04,470
to control the resources and to to to 
ruin them.

1489
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:07,110
How about we introduce them to the 
spiritual realm?

1490
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:09,420
How about we introduced the whole world 
to mushrooms.

1491
01:12:09,510 --> 01:12:14,510
How about we approved them in mass 
quantities and slowly start to open 

1492
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:18,201
people's eyes up to the fact that it's 
not a lack of resources that we have in 

1493
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:20,640
this country.
It's a gluttonous fucking gigantic group

1494
01:12:20,641 --> 01:12:23,400
at the top that are fucking in raping 
the world.

1495
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,640
It's not that we have not enough 
resource to run the life that we we 

1496
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:28,820
need.
It's.

1497
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:31,920
We don't have enough resources to run 
the life we're living.

1498
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,500
We don't have to live like this,
this is all nonsense.

1499
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:37,380
We wrote,
we live a non agriculturally based life.

1500
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:40,830
We live a life where we rely on fossil 
fuels and you know,

1501
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,650
we rely on petroleum or we don't have 
to.

1502
01:12:43,950 --> 01:12:46,320
There's many,
many things that can be done with plants

1503
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:47,520
that we're doing right now.

1504
01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:49,620
If marijuana was legal,
first of all,

1505
01:12:49,621 --> 01:12:54,621
just hemp as for use for oil and use for
textiles and use for,

1506
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,320
for you can make houses out of it and 
you can,

1507
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:00,820
you can fucking fuel cars with it.
You could build cars with it.

1508
01:13:00,830 --> 01:13:03,450
Load is actually made a fucking car with
a um,

1509
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:05,970
uh,
instead of carbon fiber or fiberglass,

1510
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,890
they made the fucking shallow out of 
hemp.

1511
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,200
I mean,
it's all possible.

1512
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:15,950
We just can't live the way we're living 
right now and there's no way to 

1513
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:19,440
effectively reset civilization better 
than psychedelics.

1514
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:24,090
But meanwhile saying that makes you 
sound like a retard.

1515
01:13:24,091 --> 01:13:25,530
Like I'm listening to my own self and 
I'm like,

1516
01:13:25,531 --> 01:13:30,531
if I didn't do drugs,
if I had never done mushrooms or 

1517
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:30,531
anything like that,
I heard a guy talking like this.

1518
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:31,650
I'm like,
who the fuck is this idiot?

1519
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,820
Like what could you pop?

1520
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,030
How could you possibly say that you 
think you have all the answers?

1521
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:41,240
I don't have the answers,
but I do have a possible door to the 

1522
01:13:41,341 --> 01:13:46,341
answers and that's what I think.
I think psychedelic experiences are and 

1523
01:13:46,381 --> 01:13:47,880
these guys that are running for 
president,

1524
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:49,800
they will deny that to the end.
They will.

1525
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:50,910
They will.
You know,

1526
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:56,570
Obama had this fucking thing recently,
whereas a town hall meeting and he got 

1527
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:58,980
all these questions from the Internet 
and the number one question,

1528
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:04,400
the number one question was marijuana 
legalization and every other issue that 

1529
01:14:04,471 --> 01:14:09,471
was being discussed that day,
whether it was healthcare or anything 

1530
01:14:09,471 --> 01:14:09,630
else.
He gave these really well thought out in

1531
01:14:09,631 --> 01:14:11,870
depth answers,
but it came to the marijuana question.

1532
01:14:11,871 --> 01:14:12,520
It was like,
Whoa,

1533
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:13,400
Whoa,
whoa.

1534
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:14,920
I don't know what that says about this 
group here.

1535
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:16,240
They said,
no,

1536
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:18,720
I don't think that's a good idea.
Really.

1537
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:21,310
You don't think that's a good idea?
You don't think it's a good idea to stop

1538
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:26,311
suppressing people.
You don't think it's a good idea to not 

1539
01:14:26,311 --> 01:14:27,040
jail people for having a fucking 
experience,

1540
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,500
to not jail people,
for selling a plant,

1541
01:14:29,501 --> 01:14:32,020
a naturally growing thing that's never 
killed anyone.

1542
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:37,200
You don't think that it's a good idea to
reverse and evil fuck up corrupt law 

1543
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:43,060
that is helping people with the worst 
Karma ever imprison people for nothing.

1544
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:49,310
Well,
you need some fucking mushrooms and 

1545
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,631
that's the problem.
We have a whole group of people running 

1546
01:14:51,631 --> 01:14:52,840
this fucking country and none of them 
are doing mushrooms.

1547
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:57,190
I would like to have a talk show.
I.

1548
01:14:57,590 --> 01:15:02,590
I've talked about this on stage.
I want to have a talk show where I make 

1549
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:03,840
people do mushrooms with me and it 
would.

1550
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,660
It would be called a do mushrooms with 
Joe Rogan and we have on,

1551
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:11,770
you know like people that like me.
You want to know a real truth.

1552
01:15:11,771 --> 01:15:14,140
Serum Mushrooms is the best truth serum 
you,

1553
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,840
you.
Once that fucking wave hits you,

1554
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:22,020
that wave of,
of alien information and the wave of 

1555
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:26,971
love and connectivity and when you see 
the fiber of the universe all around 

1556
01:15:26,971 --> 01:15:27,580
you,
you're going to start talking.

1557
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,130
And if I could get,
you know,

1558
01:15:30,550 --> 01:15:35,410
like Ken Starr and Dick Cheney,
and could you imagine,

1559
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:40,390
could you imagine if those guys like if 
people sued them and people,

1560
01:15:40,430 --> 01:15:40,900
you know,
uh,

1561
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:41,980
you know,
because like,

1562
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:46,981
look,
there's a lot of people that want to 

1563
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:46,981
take them to trial for war crimes.

1564
01:15:46,981 --> 01:15:50,520
Especially Dick Cheney.
When you think about the fact that Dick 

1565
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:52,920
Cheney was the ceo of Halliburton and 
then he becomes a vice president of the 

1566
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:54,640
United States.
We go to some crazy fucking wars,

1567
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:59,730
or Halliburton gets the contracts and 
the wars are all based on totally false 

1568
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,090
information about weapons of mass 
destruction.

1569
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:03,310
There's people that say that Dick Cheney
was at the helm of it.

1570
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:05,530
He was lying.
You could try that motherfucker for wars

1571
01:16:05,531 --> 01:16:07,270
against your current crimes against 
humanity.

1572
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:10,840
You could try him for that.
And if he was convicted and they said,

1573
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:13,300
here's one thing you can do to get out 
of it.

1574
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:16,420
You gotTa,
you gotTa do the let's get,

1575
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:21,340
let's do mushrooms with Joe Rogan show 
and you have a guy like that,

1576
01:16:21,341 --> 01:16:21,850
like,
uh,

1577
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:28,140
any,
any really fucked up politician George 

1578
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,020
Bush,
senior George Bush Junior,

1579
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,610
you know,
anyone like that.

1580
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:32,950
Sit them down and make them,
do mushrooms.

1581
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,200
Make them realize that just because 
you've been living this life the same 

1582
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:42,151
way as everyone before you,
as your father and all these other 

1583
01:16:42,151 --> 01:16:46,321
corrupt politicians,
it doesn't mean as justifiable just 

1584
01:16:46,321 --> 01:16:46,810
because you could find examples all 
around you.

1585
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,420
People who have done worse and people 
were doing the same things.

1586
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:52,960
It doesn't mean that it's supposed to 
continue and it's got to this gotta be a

1587
01:16:52,961 --> 01:16:56,290
way to stop it.
It doesn't seem to be stopping with the,

1588
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:58,960
the evolution of culture,
it seems to be the same.

1589
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:01,210
You know,
it seems to be the corruption.

1590
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:06,440
It's being exposed more,
but it doesn't seem like it's put a 

1591
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:06,760
monkey wrench in it.
Like they're just stopping,

1592
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:07,470
you know,
the,

1593
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:10,400
the,
the financial corruption in this bailout

1594
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:15,401
is staggering.
And if you really want to hurt your 

1595
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:15,401
head,
you go and read some of them.

1596
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:15,500
Mike,
Matt,

1597
01:17:15,501 --> 01:17:18,860
tie ebs articles about it.
It fucking hurts,

1598
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:23,950
like when you look at the billions and 
trillions of dollars and where it's 

1599
01:17:23,950 --> 01:17:27,371
going and how it's being funded and 
these guys are getting bonuses and 

1600
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:31,661
they're getting bonuses,
but they don't have any money from the 

1601
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:31,661
money came from tax payers,
but they were old.

1602
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:32,860
The bonuses or else they'll quit or 
wild.

1603
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,150
They fire them.
They're the ones that fuck this thing up

1604
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:37,370
and at first,
but it's staggering.

1605
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:42,670
I mean it's literally our entire 
civilization is built on a foundation of

1606
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:51,760
unfixable bullshit.
It's the only way I think to restructure

1607
01:17:52,341 --> 01:17:57,341
our society correctly with literally it 
would have to be done by someone other 

1608
01:17:57,341 --> 01:18:02,081
than us because once.
I mean that's what the constitution was 

1609
01:18:02,081 --> 01:18:03,080
all about.
When there was the birth of America,

1610
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:07,520
the idea of America was that we were 
going to have a separation of church and

1611
01:18:07,521 --> 01:18:12,521
state that we were going to have people 
that could only run it for a few years 

1612
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,151
and then they would have to leave.
We were going to have the will of the 

1613
01:18:16,151 --> 01:18:19,361
people and then it was going to be.
We're going to be free from all the 

1614
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,570
imperialism bullshit that we haven't 
deal with in England and in Europe,

1615
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:23,750
but after awhile it just fell into the 
same thing.

1616
01:18:24,260 --> 01:18:26,660
You know,
people inherently,

1617
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:29,750
if we're left alone and we're just 
people the way we are right now,

1618
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:35,050
our evolution,
our cultural and social evolution is so 

1619
01:18:35,050 --> 01:18:36,380
much lower than the evolution of 
technology.

1620
01:18:36,381 --> 01:18:41,381
What we're able to do,
we were able to communicate with people 

1621
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:44,111
all around the world.
We're flying fucking tubes through the 

1622
01:18:44,111 --> 01:18:47,141
sky.
We're able to send video through the 

1623
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:47,141
air.
You know,

1624
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:50,870
we're able to watch television programs 
that are being broadcast from the other 

1625
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:54,521
side of the planet.
I mean we have this incredible 

1626
01:18:54,521 --> 01:18:57,311
technological capabilities,
but socially we're just a bump ahead of 

1627
01:18:57,311 --> 01:18:58,640
where we were in the fifties.
Just a little,

1628
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:00,800
just a little.
I mean,

1629
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:05,830
it could be argued that were like 
slightly behind where we were in the 

1630
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:06,210
seventies in comparison to like,
you know,

1631
01:19:06,211 --> 01:19:11,211
if you think about it,
like as far as like what kind of access 

1632
01:19:11,211 --> 01:19:11,840
to information they had back then.

1633
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:16,950
You know,
everybody was all about love and peace 

1634
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:16,950
and love.
What?

1635
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:16,950
Why,
why is that?

1636
01:19:16,950 --> 01:19:17,990
Why was the sixties the late sixties?
What,

1637
01:19:17,991 --> 01:19:22,991
why,
what was the drop off between then in 

1638
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:22,991
here,
you know,

1639
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:25,220
strokes to what it is.
When you know all that summer of love,

1640
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:27,350
all that woodstock ship,
they were all on acid.

1641
01:19:27,380 --> 01:19:28,490
Okay.
They're all in mushrooms.

1642
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:30,320
They're all in pod.
There were highest fuck.

1643
01:19:30,321 --> 01:19:34,870
And they were realizing that this way of
living the life that you know,

1644
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,140
leads you to be your dad is not where 
it's at when you want.

1645
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:44,141
Your Dad dropped out of a fucking heart 
attack at 55 and you scarcely can 

1646
01:19:44,141 --> 01:19:45,800
remember him laughing three times ever,
you know,

1647
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:46,400
and you go,
what?

1648
01:19:46,401 --> 01:19:48,650
I'm supposed to be that guy.
What the fuck is that?

1649
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:54,100
You know?
And then the Vietnam War and all the 

1650
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,510
disenchantment with our government.
I mean that's what forced people to more

1651
01:19:56,511 --> 01:19:56,900
drugs.

1652
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,090
That's what forced the culture to change
more.

1653
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:05,200
We need something like that.
We need something like that right now 

1654
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:05,990
because the way we're doing it,
we're just spinning our wheels.

1655
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:10,620
When the president wins the Nobel Peace 
Prize and then like a week later,

1656
01:20:10,621 --> 01:20:14,100
since 30,000
people more into Afghanistan,

1657
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:16,080
you've got to go,
what the fuck?

1658
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:18,690
Really?
You know what the fuck you think this is

1659
01:20:18,691 --> 01:20:20,700
a good idea?
Nobody.

1660
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:24,450
After the Vietnam War,
the Vietnam war was a good idea.

1661
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:29,840
Less people are going to think the 
Afghanistan war is a good idea because 

1662
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,140
Afghanistan isn't even really the 
fucking country.

1663
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:36,120
I mean it's like it's like one city and 
a hundred tribes.

1664
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:41,360
You know,
the way John Mccain describes 

1665
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,071
Afghanistan,
he said that it's run the same way it 

1666
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:43,071
was run when Alexander the Great was 
around.

1667
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:47,270
I mean literally you have war and and 
they run tribes and in between these 

1668
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,550
warlords,
you know,

1669
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,550
there's a few Taliban like sprinkled in 
the hills and you know,

1670
01:20:50,551 --> 01:20:52,920
how we find out about these Taliban.
This is where it gets really funny.

1671
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:58,100
We give the warlords Viagara because the
warlords can get it up anymore and you 

1672
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,180
know,
they want to still be the warlord,

1673
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:05,210
but you know,
they got like there's six wives and 

1674
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:05,210
these chicks are like,
sit around.

1675
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:06,780
When are you gonna fuck me and they 
can't fuck up.

1676
01:21:06,810 --> 01:21:11,810
So they take Viagra now and the soldiers
give them Viagra and they in turn in 

1677
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,590
turn give them information about the 
Taliban.

1678
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:14,760
It's pretty funny.
Shit.

1679
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:24,260
Okay,
let's do it.

1680
01:21:31,250 --> 01:21:33,280
How long would the world ignore the 
people that are

1681
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,140
dying of starvation?
I think Sam Kennison and the best answer

1682
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:41,141
to that,
why don't you people live with the food 

1683
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:41,141
is

1684
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,620
okay.
Let me see.

1685
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:46,860
Tiger Woods is.
Golly,

1686
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,710
I don't know what that means.
Fuck Champs Tony.

1687
01:21:51,410 --> 01:21:53,370
Big l recipes.
Oh,

1688
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:56,790
big Al was a rapper that was shot and 
killed in Harlem in 1999.

1689
01:21:59,010 --> 01:21:59,970
Thank you.
Eternal.

1690
01:22:01,170 --> 01:22:06,170
A damaged already almost 7:00.
We've been doing this for an hour and a 

1691
01:22:06,170 --> 01:22:06,170
half.

1692
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:17,530
Alright.
People don't see anything more 

1693
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:19,921
interesting here.
So I'm going to go to back to the 

1694
01:22:19,921 --> 01:22:20,050
twitter.
I'm going to stay.

1695
01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:22,090
Stay with you guys for another half an 
hour.

1696
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,340
Or someone thinks I can't recognize two 
dudes.

1697
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,420
Dicks.
I claim early.

1698
01:22:27,421 --> 01:22:30,430
I proficient and identifying poor stars 
by their dicks.

1699
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:33,940
Some fans might wonder if you're truly 
being us because it seems Kinda Gay.

1700
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:37,060
Who's this?
Who's Peter Noise?

1701
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,220
Ron.
Jeremy Rocco's.

1702
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:40,960
For Freddy.
I would say the bottom one.

1703
01:22:40,990 --> 01:22:42,580
It looks a little like Ron,
Jeremy,

1704
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:45,820
and the top one looks a little like 
Rocco.

1705
01:22:45,821 --> 01:22:48,310
So Freddie.
But the top one could be the same guy.

1706
01:22:48,311 --> 01:22:50,140
In which case I say Bolter Ron.
Jeremy.

1707
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:55,070
My right side.
So sad that I know twitter.

1708
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,830
She was on twitter.
God Damn,

1709
01:22:56,860 --> 01:23:00,040
I love you too.
Rs for Andrew.

1710
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:05,280
You motherfucker infiltrate the White 
House kitchen and mix psychedelics in 

1711
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:11,560
the food.
That might not be such a good idea.

1712
01:23:11,561 --> 01:23:12,940
Did you hear about what happened in 
France?

1713
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,930
I'll find the article for you in the 
CIA.

1714
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:24,420
The CIA put a LSD in.
They spiked.

1715
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,420
I'll put the um,
it's,

1716
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:33,020
it's all over the Internet.
I'm not just one.

1717
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:35,670
I'll put,
uh,

1718
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:37,610
I'll put,
I'll put one up on,

1719
01:23:37,611 --> 01:23:41,390
but if you just look up CIA,
France,

1720
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:46,100
lsd in Google,
you will find a many,

1721
01:23:46,101 --> 01:23:48,110
many,
many articles about it.

1722
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,700
I'll put it up on twitter right now.

1723
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,670
Just throw it up on twitter.
Right?

1724
01:24:12,671 --> 01:24:17,230
There is some fascinating shit man.
So I don't think that dosing people with

1725
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:20,590
a acid is the answer.
I think,

1726
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,690
um,
that's definitely not the way to go.

1727
01:24:22,750 --> 01:24:27,750
Um,
I think any psychedelic drugs should be 

1728
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:30,991
done if you've got to do it at all with 
an understanding of what you're doing 

1729
01:24:30,991 --> 01:24:31,930
and you're doing it with someone who 
knows what they're doing,

1730
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:36,960
who's done it many times before,
and that's what the role of a shaman is 

1731
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:36,960
supposed to be.
You know,

1732
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,400
what a shaman is supposed to be is 
someone who can give you a experience 

1733
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,200
and help you and guide you through the 
experience of,

1734
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:49,390
of literally leaving this world.
I mean,

1735
01:24:49,391 --> 01:24:51,280
that's,
that's what psychedelics are all about.

1736
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:52,510
You know what I mean?
Everybody wants,

1737
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:54,190
everybody thinks that,
you know,

1738
01:24:54,191 --> 01:24:59,191
to really leave this world,
you're going to get a spaceship and 

1739
01:24:59,191 --> 01:24:59,191
you've got to go to another planet.

1740
01:24:59,191 --> 01:25:00,610
You can leave this world from right 
here.

1741
01:25:00,820 --> 01:25:05,820
You can leave this world in your own 
mind and it's much more possible to me 

1742
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,460
that the real aliens,
that real alien life,

1743
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:14,730
it's probably way weirder and way more 
complicated than we've got it broken 

1744
01:25:14,730 --> 01:25:16,450
down in the movies with metal ships and 
shit like that.

1745
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,720
I think it's,
I think it's more of a dimensional 

1746
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,480
thing.
I think there's,

1747
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:23,390
there's a,
you know,

1748
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:28,410
I mean if you talk to people that know 
anything about quantum physics and I 

1749
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:28,410
don't understand it,
I don't get it,

1750
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:31,660
but from their claims and supposedly 
this is mathematically provable,

1751
01:25:31,661 --> 01:25:34,170
there's at least 11 dimensions,
you know,

1752
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:36,670
that's just what we know about.
What does that even mean?

1753
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,620
Do you even know what that means?
I'm not sure I do,

1754
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:44,330
but I think that the way I think about 
it is that it's,

1755
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:49,680
it's very likely that just this reality 
is just the reality that we're tuned 

1756
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,701
into,
but there's probably an infinite number 

1757
01:25:53,701 --> 01:25:55,990
of different realities going on at the 
same time all around us.

1758
01:25:56,140 --> 01:26:01,140
We just can't tune into it.
We just don't literally don't have the 

1759
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:04,081
senses for it.
So it might be the alien life is here 

1760
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:08,140
right now all the time.
It's just operating on like a different 

1761
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:08,540
frequency on the dial.
You know,

1762
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:11,930
like the world is a radio and that we're
97 point one,

1763
01:26:11,931 --> 01:26:14,250
but that the aliens are one of nine 
point eight and you know,

1764
01:26:14,270 --> 01:26:16,520
we just can't do an event.
You know,

1765
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:19,130
who the fuck knows?
But you know,

1766
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:23,110
when you start talking to aliens,
people going to think you're crazy.

1767
01:26:25,370 --> 01:26:29,230
If we ever did we ever did fucking find 
is God damn.

1768
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:32,690
Would that be a crazy day if they ever 
did come down?

1769
01:26:32,691 --> 01:26:37,691
But I don't think there would be too 
nice to us because we're not so nice to 

1770
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:37,691
chimps.
You know,

1771
01:26:37,691 --> 01:26:38,450
look at what we do to killer whales.
Man.

1772
01:26:38,780 --> 01:26:43,780
You know,
we take fucking killer whales when we 

1773
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:43,780
know they're super smart and we don't 
care.

1774
01:26:44,510 --> 01:26:49,510
We don't give a fuck.
Get the fish texted with getting the 

1775
01:26:49,510 --> 01:26:50,570
tank do tricks.
You know,

1776
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:53,810
what makes us think that aliens are 
going to treat us any differently.

1777
01:26:54,050 --> 01:26:59,050
Maybe that maybe that's what all these 
alien abduction experience are all 

1778
01:26:59,050 --> 01:26:59,140
about.
Maybe they're real.

1779
01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:02,000
They don't take it seriously at all.
They just think we're crazy pink monkeys

1780
01:27:02,001 --> 01:27:05,570
with nuclear weapons and they come down 
and they fuck with us and there's a joke

1781
01:27:05,571 --> 01:27:08,630
that I do in my act about how if there 
are really are aliens,

1782
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:12,700
I believe the earth is the Tiawana of 
outer space and I really,

1783
01:27:12,701 --> 01:27:13,910
I think that might be accurate.

1784
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:18,910
I might,
this might be just a place to come to 

1785
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:18,910
fuck around,
you know,

1786
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,790
why would you want to fix us?
So why,

1787
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,930
so we can make more is already 6 billion
of us.

1788
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:25,510
You know,
what,

1789
01:27:25,610 --> 01:27:28,070
why would you want to make more and you 
know,

1790
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:30,280
the last hundred years,
I mean,

1791
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:35,290
how many more people have been born 
something like four or five fucking 

1792
01:27:35,290 --> 01:27:35,410
billion.
I mean it's Ken,

1793
01:27:35,411 --> 01:27:40,411
pretty naughty man.
This is motherfuckers gonna get 

1794
01:27:40,411 --> 01:27:41,420
overcrowded soon.
And why?

1795
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:43,280
Why would they mean if you've got to fix
us?

1796
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:48,281
It would have to be a radical changing.
It would have to be really radical 

1797
01:27:48,281 --> 01:27:51,940
because socially we're not catching up 
to where we are technologically.

1798
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:55,730
Our awareness is not up to what we're 
capable of,

1799
01:27:55,940 --> 01:27:58,730
what we're capable of blowing up the 
whole plan for in.

1800
01:27:58,750 --> 01:28:03,110
We're capable of creating black holes 
and we're capable of all kinds of shit.

1801
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:08,140
I mean just the.
The nuclear arsenal that North Korea 

1802
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:08,140
possesses,
those dummies.

1803
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:10,790
They got one fucking stupid little dude 
with glasses.

1804
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,010
Makes them shut the lights out at night 
to save energy.

1805
01:28:13,011 --> 01:28:15,320
Nobody's got any money.
This motherfucker's got to Ghana nuclear

1806
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:20,321
weapons just quarter to launch on people
11.

1807
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:22,740
Oh,
at this guy.

1808
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:27,740
11 dimensions explained.
Says as Y Z ge,

1809
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:28,720
one,
one,

1810
01:28:28,730 --> 01:28:32,240
one,
one a watch that and I still won't learn

1811
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:33,680
anymore.
I'll watch it,

1812
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:36,460
but I'll still be like,
I'm not sure really what their science.

1813
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,730
Okay.
Couple more questions here and I hear my

1814
01:28:48,630 --> 01:28:49,260
daughter's crying.

1815
01:28:54,910 --> 01:28:59,910
If aliens didn't exist that says that 
everyone who was abducted or saw a Ufo 

1816
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:00,280
is crazy.
No,

1817
01:29:00,281 --> 01:29:02,070
it doesn't.
Because first of all,

1818
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:04,710
what you have found means unidentified.
Let me tell you something,

1819
01:29:04,711 --> 01:29:06,450
man.
People are full of Shit.

1820
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:09,270
You know,
we did a thing.

1821
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:11,550
I used to do a show called game show in 
my head.

1822
01:29:11,551 --> 01:29:16,551
I did it for CBS and it was a hidden 
camera game show and what the show was 

1823
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:17,730
was we would,
um,

1824
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:18,700
we would,
uh,

1825
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:23,720
have a contestant and the contestant 
would have to convince people to do a 

1826
01:29:23,720 --> 01:29:24,270
bunch of shit and it would be under a 
hidden camera.

1827
01:29:24,810 --> 01:29:27,420
And we set up in Hollywood and this 
dude,

1828
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:29,940
we had a contestant dress up like a 
newscaster,

1829
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:34,970
like a guy worked for channel four news 
and he stood there on the street corner 

1830
01:29:34,970 --> 01:29:37,560
and we had all these cameras pointed on 
him when the cameras right on the people

1831
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:40,560
and he would go up to people and say,
can you do me a favor?

1832
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:45,560
I'm in a terrible situation.
We had a situation here earlier and uh,

1833
01:29:46,570 --> 01:29:51,570
a Ufo landed.
They had to tell the people on camera 

1834
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:54,980
that a Ufo landed and that all these 
witnesses had seen it.

1835
01:29:55,140 --> 01:30:00,140
But then the witnesses took off.
So I need you to pretend that you 

1836
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:03,580
sought.
And every fucking person we asked to do 

1837
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:04,860
that did it.
I thought no one was going to do it.

1838
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,560
They just stepped right up.
And so tell us about the experience.

1839
01:30:07,630 --> 01:30:08,340
And the guy was like,
well,

1840
01:30:08,341 --> 01:30:13,341
you know,
I saw the UFO and it was silver lights 

1841
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:13,341
were on the edge.
They describe it in detail.

1842
01:30:13,341 --> 01:30:18,080
I'm sitting there like,
why people love to be on camera and 

1843
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,671
people are just generally full shit.
And even if they did see something by 

1844
01:30:22,671 --> 01:30:25,110
the time that story comes around and 
there's cameras on them or they're being

1845
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:26,850
interviewed and they're talking to 
reporters,

1846
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:28,830
that story is going to morph in their 
memory.

1847
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:31,140
It's going to change.
Who knows what the fuck it was.

1848
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:33,480
It could have been an experimental 
government jet.

1849
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:35,520
It could have been a flock of birds at 
night.

1850
01:30:35,521 --> 01:30:40,521
It could have been a Ufo.
Who the fuck knows who knows what it 

1851
01:30:40,521 --> 01:30:44,121
really was?
But the people that are talking about 

1852
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:45,090
are almost all nuts,
man.

1853
01:30:45,210 --> 01:30:50,210
They're almost all looney.
So I think that people see things and 

1854
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:51,270
then they blow those things up in their 
head.

1855
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:56,390
And as far as the abduction experiences,
all Ufo duction experiences occur while 

1856
01:30:56,390 --> 01:31:01,311
people are sleeping there,
that they're all a curling like late at 

1857
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:01,311
night.
If you look at them,

1858
01:31:01,311 --> 01:31:05,211
the bulk of them,
except that people are just completely 

1859
01:31:05,211 --> 01:31:06,500
insane to think they come and take them,
you know,

1860
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:11,600
during the middle of the day and bring 
them back and it seems like there were 

1861
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:11,600
only gone for a second,
but really they're gone for days.

1862
01:31:11,950 --> 01:31:14,550
There's some loons that will tell you 
some stories like that,

1863
01:31:14,551 --> 01:31:19,551
but I think that what's going on is it's
dmt related because we know that the 

1864
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:25,161
brain produces dmt while a person is in 
heavy rem sleep and if you smoked dmt,

1865
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:30,450
the experience that you have is very 
much alien.

1866
01:31:30,690 --> 01:31:35,690
It's very much like what you would 
expect someone to be talking about if 

1867
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:36,510
they were brought to another world or 
brought a border spaceship.

1868
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:41,750
I mean,
it feels like you're going on to 

1869
01:31:41,750 --> 01:31:42,470
something you know and who knows what 
kind of a,

1870
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:47,530
you know,
a response you would give these Ufo 

1871
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:50,481
people if,
if you took them and gave them dmt and 

1872
01:31:50,481 --> 01:31:50,481
made them smoke dmt and go,
okay,

1873
01:31:50,481 --> 01:31:52,290
was that what you saw?
And if they're like,

1874
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:53,790
yeah,
it was back on the ship and go,

1875
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,110
okay,
settle down.

1876
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:57,090
Then you know.
Then you know what's going on,

1877
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:58,260
you know what,
what is that?

1878
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,400
Are they,
are they really making contact

1879
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:03,790
with entities?
Is it really their brain and their,

1880
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:08,791
their imagination that becomes 
supercharged because of this chemical 

1881
01:32:08,791 --> 01:32:09,580
that floods through it?
And what is imagination exactly?

1882
01:32:09,581 --> 01:32:10,690
I mean there's,
you know,

1883
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:12,370
people can poo poo that and say,
oh,

1884
01:32:12,371 --> 01:32:13,510
it's just,
you're making things up.

1885
01:32:13,511 --> 01:32:16,280
It's hallucinations,
isn't it?

1886
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:21,480
You know,
how do you know that that world is not 

1887
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:21,480
just as real as this world just because 
this world,

1888
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,440
you can bang on it,
make noise.

1889
01:32:23,441 --> 01:32:24,430
You know,
you could feel it.

1890
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:28,900
It doesn't mean it's more real.
That just means it's solid.

1891
01:32:29,190 --> 01:32:29,700
You know?
It's,

1892
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,140
it's very possible that the world of the
imagination,

1893
01:32:32,141 --> 01:32:36,400
the world of your mind,
the world of dreams is really a world is

1894
01:32:36,401 --> 01:32:37,690
really another dimension.

1895
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,770
Do I believe in ghosts?
I'm not scared of him.

1896
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:47,820
I fucking watched those.
Ghost stories are,

1897
01:32:47,870 --> 01:32:49,970
what are they scared of?
Fucking ghosts never killed anybody.

1898
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:55,540
You see it or some shit.
It's amazing how many of those goddamn 

1899
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:58,300
shows there are there.
Everybody wants to like watch the 

1900
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,551
paranoia level.
Everybody's obsessed with UFO and 

1901
01:33:01,430 --> 01:33:03,110
everybody's obsessed with,
you know,

1902
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:08,230
shit that's not necessarily real big 
foot like I've always had the killer 

1903
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:09,670
whales are way more interesting than 
bigfoot.

1904
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:14,990
These super intelligent animals and 
asked to actually rescue people that 

1905
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,610
kill or they killed great white sharks.
They killed dolphins.

1906
01:33:16,611 --> 01:33:17,810
They like.
They're ruthless,

1907
01:33:17,811 --> 01:33:19,460
crazy,
super intelligent animals.

1908
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:22,730
They play with their dead like seals.
You ever see killer whales,

1909
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:27,940
like throw a clf merits,
Swat them on their tail and send them 

1910
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:27,940
flying.
Their fucking ruthless.

1911
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:29,720
And they were super smart.
It's fascinating.

1912
01:33:29,721 --> 01:33:32,130
Shit.
All right.

1913
01:33:32,131 --> 01:33:35,160
I think a chat roulette,
if you've been on chat with that,

1914
01:33:35,161 --> 01:33:36,680
you've probably seen my deck.
Sorry.

1915
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:38,770
No,
I never put my Dick Archer.

1916
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:40,170
That's just roots.

1917
01:33:42,270 --> 01:33:43,510
Um,
I think it's funny though.

1918
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:44,980
Um,
I haven't done it yet.

1919
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:47,980
I did the other roulette or you just 
type.

1920
01:33:48,010 --> 01:33:53,010
Just like a,
it's like a one on one personal 

1921
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:54,190
messaging like in Brazil was dudes 
trying to get laid or you would do.

1922
01:33:54,450 --> 01:33:56,770
I would say yes.
And then they would just fucking hang up

1923
01:33:56,771 --> 01:34:01,771
on me.
So I started saying I was a chick and I 

1924
01:34:01,771 --> 01:34:01,870
did a few of those and I put them up on 
the,

1925
01:34:02,590 --> 01:34:05,320
on the forums and Joe Rogan.net
and it's kind of fun.

1926
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:12,060
Alright.
Did Dan Hardee get to leapfrog top 10 

1927
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,220
welterweights and get a title shot?
You know,

1928
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:14,650
I don't know.
I mean it's hard to say.

1929
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:20,230
Uh,
I think Dan Hardy's exciting dude talks 

1930
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:23,160
a lot of shitty saying all the right 
things because he had serious power in 

1931
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:26,341
his hands.
It's just whether or not he's going to 

1932
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:26,341
be able to deal with that fucking 
wrestling game of GSP.

1933
01:34:26,341 --> 01:34:27,940
GSP can take you down,
man.

1934
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:31,370
He's such an athlete.
Managed so explosive and it's,

1935
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:36,450
I think it's just really hard for dudes 
to avoid that take down and he gets on 

1936
01:34:36,450 --> 01:34:36,880
top of you and stays on top.
It got to beat your ass.

1937
01:34:37,180 --> 01:34:42,180
You know,
the thing is about GSP is will it be a 

1938
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,200
fight like the Tiago Alvarez fight where
he neutralized elvis but he never really

1939
01:34:44,201 --> 01:34:49,201
came close to stopping them?
Or will it be a fight like the Fitch 

1940
01:34:49,201 --> 01:34:52,300
fighter,
the Bj fight where he just gets on top 

1941
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:52,300
of them,
beat the fucking shit out of them,

1942
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:53,440
or will hardy have something up his 
sleeve,

1943
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:58,470
you know,
maybe a hardee's takedown defense is 

1944
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,470
better than we thought it is,
you know,

1945
01:34:58,470 --> 01:34:58,470
maybe hardy,
um,

1946
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:03,730
has a strategy for how to counter the 
double and how to stop him when he's 

1947
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:04,460
coming in or how to,
you know,

1948
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,470
take it to him or maybe he's going to 
pull guard.

1949
01:35:06,470 --> 01:35:11,470
I mean,
where the fuck knows what hard he's 

1950
01:35:11,470 --> 01:35:11,470
going to do.
I'm,

1951
01:35:11,470 --> 01:35:13,800
he's a very,
very smart guy and he's very confident 

1952
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:13,800
and it's real confidence.
It's not bullshit.

1953
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:17,120
He really believes that he's going to 
clip GSP and he's going to rock them and

1954
01:35:17,121 --> 01:35:20,620
he's going to go home with the title.
Who the fuck knows sun?

1955
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:25,940
It's going to be interesting.
Spice bag of ice.

1956
01:35:25,941 --> 01:35:30,941
I'll spilled bag of ice.
Says that the 11th dimension is in his 

1957
01:35:30,941 --> 01:35:30,941
pants.
Wow.

1958
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,200
That's built bag of ice was still 
around.

1959
01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:35,120
I thought it would have abandoned that 
twitter by now.

1960
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,480
You've got a lot of sticktuitiveness on.
Good for you.

1961
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:40,160
Alright.
Um,

1962
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:41,750
I think that's enough,
right?

1963
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:45,470
So I can 37 slash 11.
That's a perfect time to end.

1964
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:49,340
We are proof that aliens exist.
Perspective.

1965
01:35:49,740 --> 01:35:54,740
Okay.
I don't know what you're talking about 

1966
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:54,740
now.
You've done too much drugs.

1967
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:54,740
You're,
you're,

1968
01:35:54,740 --> 01:35:54,740
you're ruining.
The whole call is done.

1969
01:35:55,660 --> 01:36:00,660
Um,
I will look one more time for a good 

1970
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:00,660
question on the forums dot Joe 
Rogan.net.

1971
01:36:00,730 --> 01:36:03,080
And if we cannot find one,
we'll wrap it up.

1972
01:36:03,150 --> 01:36:03,620
Bitches.

1973
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:16,990
Did anyone ever wonder why we'll lose 
all the grid rappers that have a 

1974
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:17,990
significant place in hip hop history?
Rappers,

1975
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,070
Tupac,
Biggie,

1976
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,380
big l easy.
He one on a big alice.

1977
01:36:21,620 --> 01:36:22,460
Easy.
Yeah.

1978
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:25,490
Yet we're stuck with garbage like Nelly 
and fucking soldier boy.

1979
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:27,890
Well yeah,
that's interesting.

1980
01:36:28,010 --> 01:36:29,960
Um,
I think rappers,

1981
01:36:29,961 --> 01:36:30,920
man,
that life,

1982
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:36,310
you know,
the life is all guns and meanwhile 

1983
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:36,310
you're Tupac and you got fucking machine
guns tattooed on your body.

1984
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:38,690
It says thug life on your stomach.
You know,

1985
01:36:38,691 --> 01:36:41,900
those aren't signs of a,
a long and healthy career.

1986
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:44,180
He was like the first dude to like cover
his body,

1987
01:36:44,181 --> 01:36:47,120
his whole body with tattoos too.
They're all doing that now.

1988
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:48,640
It's really crazy.
You know,

1989
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:51,050
little wayne.
I think it's hilarious that little Wayne

1990
01:36:51,110 --> 01:36:53,180
said that he's a gangster,
like told Katie Kirk,

1991
01:36:53,181 --> 01:36:54,350
I'm a gangsta.
Ms Dot Katie.

1992
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,820
Meanwhile he put him in jail.

1993
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:57,520
He immediately put them in protective 
custody.

1994
01:36:59,510 --> 01:37:04,510
You're a gangster,
made me you and you've got all your 

1995
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:04,510
money and your outside,
but the inside world.

1996
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:04,830
No,
you're,

1997
01:37:04,980 --> 01:37:07,520
you're a singer,
you're an entertainer.

1998
01:37:07,521 --> 01:37:10,250
And it would be awesome with one of 
those guys have fucked your face.

1999
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:11,900
Not for everybody.
For them,

2000
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:14,180
for that guy to fuck your face.
He'd be.

2001
01:37:14,181 --> 01:37:19,181
I'm not saying that.
I'm looking forward to you getting your 

2002
01:37:19,181 --> 01:37:19,181
facebook's,
but let's be realistic.

2003
01:37:19,181 --> 01:37:19,900
It would happen.
God dammit.

2004
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:23,690
Yeah,
motherfuckers alright when.

2005
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:25,580
Alright.
I think that's it.

2006
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,130
There's no more.
I could say I'm a,

2007
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:33,160
like I said,
I'm going to be an Gotham at Gotham 

2008
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:33,320

2013
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:47,480
