1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:08,050
Da da,
and we're live and you have come 

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,380
bringing the future.
This is what we've all hoped for.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,850
We had all heard about this when we were
kids.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,930
Do,
they're going to sell.

5
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:17,931
We'd like cigarettes in a carton.
It'll going to be pre rolled and you're 

6
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:20,260
going to be buying it just like you buy 
a Marlboro and you've,

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,810
you've come bringing this.
This is real sure.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,730
Yeah.
It's a real thing though.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,140
Where'd you get those?
Um,

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,520
I got them into the Seattle when we just
played there.

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,710
The company brought us a whole gift bag 
and it hasn't worked with transport,

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,740
with things like that.
Well,

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,260
I guess if I told you,
screw up our transport.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Definitely I'm not a traveler with.
I'm acquire when you get there kind of a

15
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,480
guy.
Sure.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,830
I think it's usually the best move.
It's just,

17
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,790
it is the best move.

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,790
But uh,
do they even bother checking people in 

19
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:55,910
the Seattle airport anymore?
You know,

20
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,640
we're on a bus.
It's totally different.

21
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,730
Yeah,
of course.

22
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,260
So except if you go to Texas,
I would never,

23
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,600
I would never take it on a plane.
No,

24
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,190
not a good move.
Not a good move,

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,710
but when they arrested Willie Nelson in 
Texas and like,

26
00:01:07,711 --> 00:01:08,820
wow,
that's how much.

27
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:10,350
They don't make exceptions.
Yeah.

28
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:12,400
That was weird.
That was stupid.

29
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,040
It's ridiculous.
I mean,

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,740
it hurts my feelings.
It's like,

31
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,000
really,
this is what you're doing.

32
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,200
You're trying to solve crime arrests in.
What does he eat now?

33
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,910
Will.
He's got to be close to 80.

34
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,330
I mean,
he's got to be in the top 10 of people 

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:29,330
who have done more for the state of 
Texas than anyone.

36
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:29,330
Right?
Yeah.

37
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,320
I mean,
come on now.

38
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,170
He died.
He's undeniably awesome.

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,370
I mean,
enough.

40
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,630
I was a great guy.
Yeah.

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,310
Like,
why would you want to arrest that guy?

42
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:38,720
That's,
you know,

43
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
can you imagine willie?
He was probably like really serious and 

44
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,240
sad.
It's sad.

45
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,400
It's someone must've felt kind of 
embarrassed.

46
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:48,270
I bet.
Yeah.

47
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,810
And we were talking today because today 
this is good.

48
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,210
This is a historic day for music because
of Prince.

49
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:54,960
I mean,
this is,

50
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:59,070
um,
it's very strange when a guy that's that

51
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,190
powerful,
especially when I was a kid during my 

52
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:04,190
teen years.
I mean,

53
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,820
there was,
when he was,

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
you know,
really emerging and that's when people 

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,000
were really finding out about him.
I remember thinking like,

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,080
wow,
this guy is so interesting.

57
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:14,620
It's such a combination of different 
things like that.

58
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,820
He was,
there was no one that was like him 

59
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,950
before.
I mean David Bowie was sort of 

60
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,940
androgynous before,
but he took it into a different new 

61
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,990
place and it was mysterious and had some
with David Bowie.

62
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:31,010
For me,
it always felt more like theater with 

63
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,010
prince.
It felt more like prince,

64
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,040
you know,
that's really him,

65
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,830
you know?
Yeah.

66
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,380
Purple Rain and then did the movie 
because he just started that way,

67
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,110
but we kind of transformed into that 
androgyny.

68
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,660
Prince was like that to begin with.
Right?

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Yeah.
I remember the first time pat and I 

70
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,630
played the first avenue in Minneapolis.
That's where they shot,

71
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,170
I think some parts from maybe the live.
Is that right?

72
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,050
The live segments from,
from that movie.

73
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:57,660
And uh,
that was the big thing,

74
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,480
you know?
Yeah.

75
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,740
Just to be as well.
He kind of owned Minneapolis,

76
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:07,741
right?
He put Minneapolis on the map and he 

77
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:07,741
stayed there.
Yeah,

78
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:08,770
and you thought of many.
I like thought of Prince.

79
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:13,771
You thought of Minneapolis.
That was part of the thing is that he 

80
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:14,170
was,
as this wizard that lived in this frozen

81
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:19,171
land and produced all this crazy music,
they never would have arrested prints 

82
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:21,940
for we'd know in Minneapolis.
No.

83
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,140
Now he gets a hall pass.

84
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:25,810
No.
Yeah,

85
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:28,090
he was the man in Minneapolis.
I mean every he was,

86
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,390
he's a god there.
I wonder what it was that got them,

87
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,760
you know,
it's 57 years old.

88
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,420
I mean,
he's a thin guy.

89
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,140
Looks like he's healthy.
He looked very healthy.

90
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,200
He looked like he could have been 
mistaken for Ferrell.

91
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,040
I mean,
he was like,

92
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:44,290
yeah,
those two guys are like ageless,

93
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,320
you know,
and he did a show just a couple of 

94
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,320
nights ago.
Yeah,

95
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,690
he was on tour.
Um,

96
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,060
I dunno,
it's just so wild.

97
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,420
Well,
it's so hard when something like that 

98
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,420
happens,
you can only speculate.

99
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:57,430
You don't.
No one really knows until you hear.

100
00:03:57,431 --> 00:04:02,431
It's just,
it just reinforces this idea that we're 

101
00:04:02,431 --> 00:04:03,610
so fragile.
This all could go away.

102
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,720
And yeah,
like,

103
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,200
like I said,
it's like it doesn't matter how much 

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:10,240
money you have can have the best doctors
in the world and it's just,

105
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:16,290
you have to be thankful for what you 
have got to be a good human because it 

106
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:19,450
can just all go away so quickly and 
eventually it's all going to go away for

107
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,080
all of us.

108
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,210
Yeah,
very soon.

109
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,160
One hundred percent.
Life is very short.

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,400
It's 100 percent not going to last.
Hondo says nobody gets out alive.

111
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,600
Right?
No one instill.

112
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,040
It's a people run through life 
accumulating shit.

113
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,090
Yeah.
And,

114
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,160
and missing missing opportunities to 
just take it all in and enjoy it.

115
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,070
And when a guy like prince,
one of the undeniable things that he 

116
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:49,070
left was a,
I mean,

117
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,780
you will always have his catalog of work
to make people happy.

118
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,110
Like he left a,
an undeniable impact on people.

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,400
You know,
to this day,

120
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,720
uh,
I will pull out,

121
00:04:58,721 --> 00:05:01,660
I wanna be your lover because that was 
the first big hit.

122
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,770
And like that still to this day,
a fucking bad ass song.

123
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,860
Absolutely.
You know what,

124
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,900
what really kills me though is when you 
get an artist who people just weren't 

125
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,450
ready for and they're only,
they're only shown love after they die.

126
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,750
Do you know what I mean?
That kind of kills me.

127
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,090
That's going to be the case here.
You know,

128
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:24,030
for sure he's going to get when he was 
always showing love,

129
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:29,040
but he'll be showing a lot more love.
People appreciate them now that they 

130
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,220
know it's ended.
What do,

131
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,900
I mean?
That's what happened to Michael Jackson.

132
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Michael Jackson before he died,
people weren't nearly as interested in 

133
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,680
him because he was like,
once he died,

134
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,681
like once he died,
then his catalog went through the roof 

135
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:46,471
and everybody wanted to buy the old 
stuff up and all the prince stuff is 

136
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:46,471
like charting now.
You know,

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,960
man,
I was thinking about Bill Hicks the 

138
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,341
other day and how he died at his mom's 
and Arkansas.

139
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,310
He will.
He knew it was going down for awhile.

140
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,340
He had pancreatic cancer and it was.
It's a particularly brutal kind of 

141
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,811
cancer apparently,
especially in the nineties when bill 

142
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:10,070
died of it and he knew and just went to 
his mom's place to die,

143
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,150
but just thinking about that,
like you just sort of never made it,

144
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,980
made it.
He know what I mean.

145
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,990
Yeah.
And then he dies and then all of a 

146
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:20,990
sudden everybody says,
oh,

147
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,041
he was the best.
He was one of the best comics all the 

148
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,041
time.
You know,

149
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,041
he was certainly one of the most 
influential,

150
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:24,680
no doubt about it.
He,

151
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,430
he changed so many people's perception 
of what comedy could be.

152
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,530
He like opened up a whole new way.
He's like,

153
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,970
well,
comedy could do that too.

154
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,160
And everybody was like,
Ooh,

155
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,020
nobody did that before,
you know,

156
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,090
he had a,
like a consciousness to his comedy or 

157
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,330
like an elevation sorta thing to his 
comedy where he's trying to change your 

158
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,650
thought process along with make you 
laugh.

159
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,390
Yeah,
very different thing.

160
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:50,030
It's hard.
It's hard to get to that place.

161
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,740
That's the place you always want to get 
to.

162
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:54,950
Some people are just born there,
you know what I mean?

163
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,050
Like,
like we're talking about prince,

164
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:01,400
he was prince when he started,
he had the third eye when he started.

165
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,460
You know what I mean?
I think it takes some people some time 

166
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,591
on stage to figure themselves out.
It takes a few years of like making 

167
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:10,760
mistakes,
listening to too many people.

168
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,080
Yeah,
yeah.

169
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,770
You could definitely get off on bad pass
and you've got to recorrect come back.

170
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,800
You have to.
I mean there's a learning process to 

171
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,641
everything.
That's what's so difficult with cell 

172
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:24,641
phones nowadays.
It's like you can't learn in private,

173
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:28,990
you know,
you used to be able to go on stage and 

174
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:28,990
like practice kind of in front of 
people,

175
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,750
which is the best practice,
you know,

176
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,970
but now everything's filmed.

177
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,310
Even your shit that you're trying to 
work out,

178
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,780
you can't just be so free.
Do you know what I mean?

179
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,880
Big with big deal with standup.
That's a big deal with standup because 

180
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,110
the bits,
if you hear them and then you hear the 

181
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,110
finished product,
it will.

182
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,000
If you hear the like the starting,
like you should ideally he'll hear it 

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,750
for the first time in full form and 
completed for him,

184
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,850
but a lot of people along the way,
what people enjoy that process,

185
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:03,851
they'll like coming to the comedy store 
and watching people stumble through an 

186
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,700
idea that they're not exactly sure.
And then they'll see that bit,

187
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:06,800
maybe six months later on a television 
specialist.

188
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,430
I'm sure he figured it out.
But um,

189
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,120
yeah,
it's.

190
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,300
But he could also choose as a fan to not
seek that stuff out.

191
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,090
I think people do.
Yeah.

192
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,760
You know,
it,

193
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,800
it stops me from wanting to play songs.

194
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,210
I don't really know.
Wow.

195
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,580
Absolutely.
Because you're worried that like a video

196
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:27,581
of it getting out there,
being kind of in the halfway hacking my 

197
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:29,330
way down new song,
you know,

198
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,090
I wouldn't do it.
Fuck.

199
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,490
Absolutely.
Well if you think it's really stifled,

200
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,520
stifled some modern performing.
Have you seen some of those things that 

201
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,540
Chappelle's done and um,
I'm Hannibal burress has done.

202
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:46,541
They take these bags and you put your 
cell phone in and we to go in and it's 

203
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:46,760
sealed.
And when you're in the room,

204
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:51,761
you literally can open the bag and then 
if you leave the room somehow there's 

205
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:52,220
some sensor and allows you to open the 
bag.

206
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,500
It seems like a ridiculous idea.
But the more I about it,

207
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:56,190
it seems like

208
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,300
it's the kind of thing that people may 
fight.

209
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,820
But then thank you for afterwards.
Yes.

210
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,050
Yeah,
yeah.

211
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,650
Right.
Yeah.

212
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,870
For the experience themselves,
you're like,

213
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:08,850
Holy Shit,
I haven't really paid attention anything

214
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:10,230
for an hour and a half,
two hours,

215
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,190
uh,
for years.

216
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,450
Right.
You know what I mean?

217
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,340
Well,
if you go to a concert now,

218
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,630
all you see is phones up and people 
watching the concert through phones.

219
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,250
Yeah.
I mean you see this,

220
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,740
you see people doing this all the time.
You're like,

221
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:25,500
you'll,
you'll see a sea of cell phones at these

222
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,180
arenas.
And it's weird.

223
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,010
They used to reach out and try to touch 
me.

224
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,270
Now they either reach out to,
to,

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,610
to take a picture.
Did you notice a shift or it's slowly,

226
00:09:35,611 --> 00:09:38,280
like almost like people were infected by
phones,

227
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,510
like the tin man.
I mean,

228
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:42,490
when we started,
I was a flip phone generation.

229
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,350
I know those are two problematic,
so hard.

230
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,780
Take a picture with some people were 
into it,

231
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,430
but most people left them in their 
pockets.

232
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,230
Yeah.
No,

233
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:54,370
because the picture's sucked.
I mean,

234
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,100
it's not something you want to brag 
about now.

235
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,240
Everybody's like the best photographer 
ever with the iphone.

236
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,470
Yeah.
They're so good now and they're getting 

237
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:05,470
better all the time and they're also 
putting those little lenses on them.

238
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,370
They're making them even better.
They slide a little lens over the top of

239
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:09,330
it.
You see a lot of that,

240
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,270
but people aren't experiencing it in a 
pure way.

241
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,930
You know you're not going to it and just
sitting there and taking in the show.

242
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,320
Instead you're going into it and you're 
aware that you were recording it and you

243
00:10:19,321 --> 00:10:22,080
want to make sure you get it in frame 
and you make sure you've got a good part

244
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:27,081
that's going to look good on your 
facebook or wherever the fuck you're 

245
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:27,081
going to put it.

246
00:10:27,081 --> 00:10:29,160
You missing your.
You're not giving into the experience of

247
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:32,100
the music or the show or whatever.
You're going to 100 percent.

248
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,550
Life is not as good with cell phones.
I think,

249
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,470
but I have it in my hand all day long.
I don't.

250
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,550
I wouldn't say that life is not as good.
It's more challenging because it doesn't

251
00:10:44,551 --> 00:10:48,060
prevent you from putting it away,
but it makes it very addictive.

252
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,490
It's very hard to put it away,
but you could.

253
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,850
I think it's the kind of I think is the 
kind of thing where like your life would

254
00:10:56,011 --> 00:11:01,011
be better if you didn't have it.
You would be able to experience life 

255
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:03,111
more.
You'd paid more attention to your kids 

256
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:03,111
and you'd have more real,
true love.

257
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:07,040
You know,
you wouldn't be taking fucking selfies 

258
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,961
to post.
You'd actually be hugging them 

259
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:08,961
genuinely.
Do you know what I mean?

260
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,500
I think a can't do both.
I don't think so.

261
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,130
I've not met that person.
I don't know man.

262
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,950
I love the data though.
I love all the information.

263
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,960
I love the light.
Come on to it.

264
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,910
Yeah.
Well it's interesting.

265
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:24,090
I mean there's always something new.
There's always some new story that's out

266
00:11:24,091 --> 00:11:25,890
there.
Some new revelation,

267
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:29,220
scientific invention experiment that was
done that some.

268
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,590
There's some new shit always.
Constantly.

269
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,890
It's like the amount of data that we're 
getting now is,

270
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,150
but is it making us.
Hasn't made us better.

271
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Do you think you would question.
You think you're happier since you've 

272
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:42,600
had google in your pocket?
Twenty four slash seven.

273
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,600
I'm happy if someone starts talking shit
and I know they're wrong.

274
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:48,000
Whip out my phone.
Wrong son.

275
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,320
Just Google.
That's nice.

276
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,040
You're the Google data [inaudible] you 
would have left that party.

277
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,680
Like,
fuck,

278
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:53,980
I got to

279
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,520
learn more about something.
You know what I mean?

280
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,310
Maybe I would have left that fully.
Shit.

281
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:02,920
I know he's full of Shit.
I just wish I had my phone.

282
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,930
Yeah.
Oh well wait.

283
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,940
Leave parties thinking people are full 
of Shit.

284
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,020
That's weird.
No,

285
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,910
I'm in la somewhere.
If I didn't have a phone.

286
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,420
Yeah.
If you,

287
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:16,360
if you leave a party in La and you don't
think someone was full of Shit,

288
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:21,361
you're in the wrong party.
There's definitely a lot of that out 

289
00:12:21,361 --> 00:12:24,241
here.
Or maybe you're just where you need to 

290
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:24,241
be.
I can't say I really go to parties.

291
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,950
Um,
I might've been a dozen parties out here

292
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,330
in my entire life.
Yeah.

293
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,860
Yeah.
Probably worked,

294
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,530
nobody inviting.
You just go busy working nights.

295
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,620
First of all,
I don't have a lot of friends that put 

296
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,620
on parties.
That's not normal.

297
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,050
I made me be like a pool party or 
something like that.

298
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,970
You go over a buddy's house,
your barbecue,

299
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:43,960
but that,
you know,

300
00:12:43,961 --> 00:12:48,961
like a party party.
I've been to a few of those like 

301
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:48,961
Hollywood parties where you're walking 
around and go,

302
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:49,600
oh,
there's drew barrymore.

303
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,490
How fucking weird.
And you go into another room.

304
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:53,020
This Ben Stiller,
I'll fucking weird.

305
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:58,260
And you feel totally out of place and 
you got to get out of there as quick as 

306
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,020
you can.
I've been to a couple of those but never

307
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:00,490
sought them out.
They always seemed odd.

308
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,660
Yeah.
I don't love him so much.

309
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:04,580
We,
uh,

310
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,170
we stay at the um,
the chateau,

311
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,920
of course you do.
It's bad.

312
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,810
It has to be.
I mean that's the spot and Hollywood,

313
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,180
that's the authentic spot.
It's so cliche,

314
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:17,040
but I mean,
I've just been there.

315
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,960
Yeah.
Sleeping in the bed where,

316
00:13:18,961 --> 00:13:20,700
you know,
Belushi died,

317
00:13:20,701 --> 00:13:25,190
just like raging,
you know what I mean?

318
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,150
Learning nothing from his mistakes.
You know what I mean?

319
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,390
Yeah.

320
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,860
Jesus Christ.
I've woken up at that in that,

321
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,310
in that a place like blood on the walls,
just like what happened?

322
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,860
Have we learned nothing from this guy's 
dead.

323
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Do you think that places like that 
contain memory is that there's a real 

324
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,680
thought and we've brought it up before 
comics at the comedy store because the 

325
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,650
comedy store used to be Ciro's 
nightclub.

326
00:13:51,651 --> 00:13:54,290
It was owned by Bugsy Siegel,
the mobster,

327
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,640
and so there's murders that were there.
There's weed,

328
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,660
there's definitely murdered.
It was a murder that was there just a 

329
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:01,660
year ago.
Somebody got murdered on the front patio

330
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,490
at the comedy store were like the rich 
history of weirdness and of comedy.

331
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,670
It seems to be in the walls.
Do you feel like that about the Chateau 

332
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,120
Marmont because if you go to that place,
I mean,

333
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:15,190
is there one place more synonymous with 
Hollywood debacle than that place?

334
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:20,191
I mean,
not only that might be the hotel in 

335
00:14:20,191 --> 00:14:23,531
Hollywood where you think of like Johnny
Depp's doing blow and Jack Nicholson is 

336
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,930
banging these fuckers and ah,
it's just,

337
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,860
that's the place,
right?

338
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,110
Yeah.
Uh,

339
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,820
I think that that plays just caters.
I mean,

340
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:35,280
as soon as you walk in,
it's like this and it's dark,

341
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,610
thick curtains.
No cops.

342
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:41,640
Do you want know what I mean?
We'll watch the old guard the door.

343
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,270
Yeah.
Uh,

344
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:47,970
but I think there are places that have 
magic in them.

345
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,880
I think that there are places that you 
can't,

346
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,720
you just can't explain like muscle 
shoals,

347
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,250
you know,
we cut a record in muscle shoals.

348
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:56,510
Right.
It's magic.

349
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,950
Really.
They say that,

350
00:14:57,951 --> 00:14:59,250
you know,
why no,

351
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,320
the Americans lived there and that 
there's like,

352
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,520
you know,
it was spiritual land and.

353
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,520
But I mean it was,
it's special.

354
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:12,550
There's something there that you're able
to get in touch with yourself easier.

355
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:19,150
I don't know what it is.
Is this something in the recording 

356
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:19,460
studio itself or is there something in 
the town?

357
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:22,670
I don't think so because there were 
multiple studios there and they all,

358
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,020
they all produce great stuff.
There's still great musicians coming out

359
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:28,340
of muscle shoals and you know,
it's just,

360
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,080
there are certain places that are just,

361
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,060
I don't know what it is,
but is it possible that those buildings,

362
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,100
those recording studios have memory that
there's like a something and intangible,

363
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,270
something you can't put on a scale,
you can't measure it because the comedy 

364
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,451
store feels like a place with memory.
That's why I always ask because I 

365
00:15:49,451 --> 00:15:52,861
didn't.
I took seven years off that place and I 

366
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,070
went back about a year and a half ago 
and I still to this day I remember going

367
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,090
back again and going,
oh,

368
00:15:56,091 --> 00:15:57,470
there's that feeling again.
Like with this,

369
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:58,270
you know,
the history.

370
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,410
You knew the history for.
You went into the place though.

371
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,110
So it was before you even got there is 
magic to you?

372
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,420
Yes.
It was for me and most mostly shows and 

373
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,420
I went into the studio.
It was like,

374
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:08,560
Oh man,
yeah,

375
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,300
that's where Eddie Hinton,
you know,

376
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,990
took a shit in that bathroom right 
there.

377
00:16:11,991 --> 00:16:14,150
And it's like,
it's like A.

378
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:14,900
I think that,

379
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,830
I don't know if,
if you didn't,

380
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,930
if somebody didn't know ahead of time 
and they went in there,

381
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:22,640
they would think it was just as magic as
you do.

382
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,080
Yeah.
Maybe you're right.

383
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,230
It's one of those things that you don't 
know because you have these preconceived

384
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:29,280
ideas about it that are on.
Can't see it.

385
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,810
That was Mecca for comedians.
So muscle shoals.

386
00:16:32,811 --> 00:16:35,090
What did,
did skinner record there as well?

387
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,750
Um,
I think skinner skinner.

388
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I think so.
I'm pretty sure they recorded their 

389
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,680
rolling stones.
Recorded so many fantastic aretha 

390
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,970
recorded there.
And uh,

391
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,340
I mean they cut so many tracks there.
Yeah,

392
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,260
I like this one spot.
Research,

393
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,170
like a waffle house there.
There's nothing there.

394
00:16:54,171 --> 00:16:56,330
There's no reason anybody would go to 
muscle shoals.

395
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:59,180
And it was the recording Mecca.
Why?

396
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,890
Wow.
You know what I mean?

397
00:17:00,891 --> 00:17:03,020
That's not close to any major 
metropolis.

398
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,910
It's like a,

399
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,650
you know.
How else,

400
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,240
how else do you explain that?
Well,

401
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:14,270
this guy named Rupert Sheldrake,
I think his official title of these 

402
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:18,140
evolutionary biologist,
and he thinks that there's memory and 

403
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,140
everything.
He thinks he can't.

404
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,790
You can't extract it,
but he thinks that there's memory in 

405
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:22,790
wood,
there's a memory in stones,

406
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:26,220
there's memory and it's just like,
that's why people don't like the idea of

407
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:31,221
a haunted house.
Like we kind of inherently know that 

408
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:31,221
someone,
if someone died in a house,

409
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,000
some some horrific tragedy took place in
the house.

410
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,750
That house actually has that sadness and
that feeling in it.

411
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,910
[inaudible].
It's a part of the house now.

412
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,350
Ooh.
Yeah.

413
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,030
I don't know.
I don't know if I believe it.

414
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,790
I don't either,
but I think we,

415
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,000
we create the history in our mind before
we even before we even get there.

416
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,920
You know what I mean?
That's possible.

417
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,030
Yeah.
I mean,

418
00:17:51,031 --> 00:17:53,520
my dad,
I just got a new guitar and it was,

419
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,850
it was a guitar that was owned by one of
my favorite musicians of all time and 

420
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,670
this guy named Mississippi Fred 
Mcdowell,

421
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,930
and I swear that it's magic,
but you know,

422
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,620
it's just a good time.
You know what?

423
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,890
I can feel it.
It might be magic though.

424
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:11,940
I mean it might have something in it,
but also it might have just something in

425
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:12,660
it just because,
you know,

426
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:14,480
it was his,
so that's what I'm saying is,

427
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,710
I mean it's saying but if it's still,
it's still real,

428
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:21,711
right?
Like that data amount of magic because 

429
00:18:21,711 --> 00:18:23,850
it proved to me that someone felt it who
didn't know ahead of time but not really

430
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,700
because it works on you.
Like magic doesn't have to work in end.

431
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Everybody will.
Then I would explain it that I already 

432
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:31,940
thought of is magic.
Right.

433
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,510
So you know what I mean?
You already thought it was magic,

434
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:35,280
but because you did it is.

435
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,760
I don't know.
Maybe.

436
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,950
I don't know if I would describe that as
magic.

437
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,250
I don't know man.
I feel like if I had a notebook that 

438
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,720
Richard Pryor road in where you would 
never write in it,

439
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,840
you would save it.
That's not a good example.

440
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,650
But like if somebody gave me like 
Richard,

441
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:58,651
if rich had a laptop and he wrote some 
great shit on his laptop and then 

442
00:18:58,651 --> 00:18:58,770
someone sold it and I had that laptop,
I'd be like,

443
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,470
Holy Shit.
And magic laptop.

444
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:04,050
All of a sudden they would be matched.
Jokes are just all fire,

445
00:19:04,051 --> 00:19:06,180
everything you right.
You would think like,

446
00:19:06,181 --> 00:19:10,560
I have to do this laptop justice.
This is the laptop of the great one.

447
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,880
You know,
I have to.

448
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,790
This is no bullshit around with this 
thing.

449
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,440
Yeah.
You would think about it that way.

450
00:19:16,441 --> 00:19:19,110
It would be.
That's the idea behind like things being

451
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:21,060
sacred.
Is it like if things,

452
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,420
if you decide things are sacred than 
they are sacred.

453
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,210
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

454
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,340
It's,
it's up to you to believe and if you 

455
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:32,340
treat them as sacred,
then there's and,

456
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,390
and life is short and if you want to 
believe in magic,

457
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,990
then it's real.
Do you know I'm going to go run a 

458
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:41,990
mountain right now.
God Damn it,

459
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,800
Dan.
I mean all I do everyday is go into the 

460
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:46,800
studio and like

461
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,940
make something out of nothing.
Like,

462
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,730
yeah,
it feels like magic to me still.

463
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,850
I wake up in the morning so excited.
Do you know what I mean?

464
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:59,150
It's like,
it feels like Christmas every morning.

465
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,800
That's.
And that's magic to me.

466
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:01,510
I was like,
that's,

467
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,500
that's what,
that's what I live for.

468
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,460
You know,
I don't even like,

469
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,030
but I don't know anything else,
like I've never really had a real job,

470
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,740
you know,
I worked at my uncle's restaurant,

471
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,450
but that,
you know,

472
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,300
that's it.
It's all I've ever done.

473
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,620
Perfect.
You don't need to do.

474
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:23,790
I mean everybody's got a different path.
You don't have to do other shit.

475
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,160
Why do anything else?
If you still enjoy it,

476
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,290
he's still appreciate it.
And the music is amazing.

477
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,110
Why fucking times it makes it hard to 
relate to other people.

478
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,420
Right?
You know what I mean?

479
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:37,020
Just hanging around musicians.
Only state closed all musicians.

480
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,040
Other ones that are fighting to find the
ones that are,

481
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:42,450
I don't know,
man.

482
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:45,000
Just me and sturgill staring at each 
other in Nashville.

483
00:20:45,001 --> 00:20:45,880
It's it.
Yeah.

484
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,620
I've been a huge fan of the black keys 
for a long time,

485
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,470
man.
So for me to have you on is a real honor

486
00:20:53,471 --> 00:20:58,471
and a real treat so that you guys are so
interesting because the music is so hard

487
00:20:59,381 --> 00:21:04,381
to define like there's different styles 
in different albums and it seems like 

488
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:10,861
you guys go off in these really eclectic
ways and paths and there's so much 

489
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,980
content,
like you've guys have put out so many 

490
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:16,980
sought.
You're so prolific.

491
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,730
Yeah.
I again,

492
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,790
like I don't know how else to do it,
you know,

493
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,820
I don't know what.
I don't understand how people go into 

494
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:25,820
the studio and take some fucking week to
do one song.

495
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,840
They don't smoke weed.
I always smoke weed,

496
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:34,020
you know.
But I've done records with no we plenty 

497
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,020
of them,
you know.

498
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,850
But I still do two songs a day.
Well I think you just love it and I 

499
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:42,931
think if you love something and you just
give it that energy and it's obviously 

500
00:21:42,931 --> 00:21:42,931
given you a lot of positive results.

501
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,210
The thing is I think that people get so 
caught up with worrying about what other

502
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:51,211
people think.
They just like over analyze and it's so 

503
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,841
hard to get really in touch with 
something special when you're worrying 

504
00:21:54,841 --> 00:21:55,270
so much about everybody else.
You know what I mean?

505
00:21:55,510 --> 00:22:00,510
That's a real aspect of social media 
that I think some people struggle with 

506
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:00,900
totally.
But it's a real thing too,

507
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,550
you know,
there are a lot of very opinionated,

508
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:07,420
you know,
places that review music that are very,

509
00:22:07,421 --> 00:22:09,970
like into the trends,
you know what I mean?

510
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:14,971
And I can see how that can be crippling 
to a kid who's just trying to like make 

511
00:22:14,971 --> 00:22:15,550
music.
Yeah.

512
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:19,180
Well any form criticism where people 
didn't like a performance,

513
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:24,070
even if it's correct stills painful for 
people to hear and if you're hearing,

514
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:29,071
if you like put together something and 
then it gets reviewed by a magazine or 

515
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:29,590
something and it gets poorly reviewed.

516
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,750
Yeah.
But not being able to take criticism as 

517
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:34,750
a sign of weakness,
you know,

518
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,700
you have to know that you have to grow 
into that.

519
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,030
And also music is so ridiculously 
subjective and there's stuff that people

520
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:45,120
love that I can't listen to.
Sure.

521
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,960
And there's stuff that I love that 
people like,

522
00:22:46,961 --> 00:22:49,990
what the fuck is wrong with you?
I mean it's just always going to be that

523
00:22:49,991 --> 00:22:50,770
way.
Sure.

524
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,430
And you have one person's take on it and
it's the best thing ever.

525
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:56,850
And another person's take on it there.
They fell asleep halfway through.

526
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,010
It's weird,
you know,

527
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,200
there are records like that where.
But then again at the saint on on the 

528
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,240
same hand,
it's like there are records that people 

529
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:09,240
played me.
I'm like,

530
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,630
what the fuck is this?
I hate this.

531
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,570
And then five years later it's my 
favorite thing.

532
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,100
It wasn't ready for it.

533
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,660
I didn't quite understand that.
I didn't,

534
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,180
I didn't hear it in the right setting.
Do you know what I mean?

535
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:24,570
Set.
And also what's beautiful about music 

536
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,680
and art is that it grows with you.
It can be the best of it can really grow

537
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:27,640
with you.
Yeah.

538
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,440
You know?
Yeah.

539
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:34,441
The hearing,
the right song at the right time can 

540
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:35,080
leave like a psychic imprint on.
You have that song.

541
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,390
You always will associate that song with
that moment.

542
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,520
Sure.
Powerful moments.

543
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,970
Things that changed forever.
How old were you when you started doing 

544
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,950
music?
I was always around music.

545
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:48,470
My Dad had a great record collection,
always playing music.

546
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:51,950
My mom played piano and her whole family
play bluegrass.

547
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,230
Oh Wow.
So that's what made me want to play

548
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,730
music was I wanted to play music with my
uncles.

549
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,060
They sat around in circles and my aunt 
and they would play Stanley brothers 

550
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,200
songs and you know,
my grandma died.

551
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,090
We all sang around her,
her,

552
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:09,280
um,
a grave,

553
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:14,281
you know what I mean?
It's just like music is a real part of 

554
00:24:14,281 --> 00:24:15,220
my family.
So it's just always been there.

555
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,810
That must have been crazy.
You all sat around her grave and sang.

556
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,080
We sang her favorite songs.
Whoa.

557
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:25,960
It was really nice.
That is really nice.

558
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,330
Angel Band by this,
by the Stanley brothers.

559
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,130
It's one of my favorite songs ever.
How many people were saying six?

560
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,290
Wow.
Six people.

561
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:36,280
And we brought her instruments.

562
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,220
[inaudible] lot of crying and I'm crying
just thinking about it.

563
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,630
No,
no.

564
00:24:44,631 --> 00:24:46,190
I mean it was,
it was her favorite thing,

565
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,150
you know,
it was her.

566
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:50,030
She loved to sit in the living room and 
listened to her kids play music.

567
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:53,750
It's like a and it's the reason I'm here
now.

568
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,930
Wow.
It really is.

569
00:24:54,931 --> 00:24:58,250
I mean,
because music is just really been such a

570
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:00,440
part of my life.
Well,

571
00:25:00,441 --> 00:25:05,441
that's awesome.
When someone finds something that they 

572
00:25:05,441 --> 00:25:07,871
really just tune into like that,
then you see him just pursuing it with 

573
00:25:07,871 --> 00:25:09,920
such wild abandon.
I mean,

574
00:25:09,921 --> 00:25:12,560
that's,
that's what everybody as a fan,

575
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:17,620
that's what someone hopes for the most,
that the person who puts out the sound 

576
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,420
that you love is really into it and does
it all the time.

577
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,250
Yeah.
No,

578
00:25:22,251 --> 00:25:26,270
it's been the only thing I can really 
focus on since I was about 15.

579
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,800
Wow.
Yeah.

580
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,860
I mean girls,
girls and music was pretty much it.

581
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,800
I stopped messing around with sports.
Really?

582
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:36,370
Yeah.
That was it.

583
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,690
Well,
you guys figured it out,

584
00:25:37,691 --> 00:25:42,691
man.
He get that step five records before we 

585
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:44,710
even had song on the radio,
so.

586
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,080
Yeah.
But people were already talking about it

587
00:25:47,081 --> 00:25:51,180
before you guys had songs on the radio.
You had such an authentic sound that you

588
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:53,140
had already had a lot of momentum,
but it was.

589
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,780
It was the cool thing too,
like that no one knew about yet.

590
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,560
It was.
We had a great fan base before we had a 

591
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:01,560
radio success.
Yeah,

592
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,070
we.
We've been really blessed like every,

593
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,410
every year.
It was better than the one before.

594
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,800
What is your take on what's going on now
with radio?

595
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,630
Because it,
it's.

596
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:15,510
It must be strange to watch this 
business go from being something where 

597
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,341
you buy an actual physical thing to 
digital downloads and mean what has it 

598
00:26:21,641 --> 00:26:23,590
been like to watch us all moving to the 
Internet?

599
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,500
It's pretty depressing.
It's really depressing.

600
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,010
I don't think people can make 
connections with music like they used 

601
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:32,010
to.
You know,

602
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,400
when you used,
when you own something and you sit with 

603
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:35,400
it and listened,
you know,

604
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,630
you're like sad.
I had uncles to disposable.

605
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,220
Yeah.
You know,

606
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,740
like sitting down with an album and 
opening the album,

607
00:26:41,741 --> 00:26:44,070
putting the headphones on and not even 
talk about how,

608
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:49,100
you know,
how the artists are treated with 

609
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,100
streaming.
I mean,

610
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,311
it's just,
it's totally criminal with a streaming 

611
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:52,311
things weird,
right?

612
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,640
It's criminal to explain it.
I mean,

613
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,880
I don't know,
like I couldn't tell you numbers,

614
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,650
but you know,
I mean just like youtube,

615
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:03,651
you know,
they just paid ours fractions of what 

616
00:27:03,651 --> 00:27:05,961
they should be paying and it's just,
it's not treated like a real um,

617
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,490
valued thing anymore.
You know what I mean?

618
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,220
Well,
we were discussing this the other day 

619
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,721
about streaming services that one of the
weirdest things about it is all they're 

620
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:19,960
selling is artists work,
right?

621
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,100
Mean,
that's all you have.

622
00:27:21,101 --> 00:27:23,410
You can't stream anything if someone 
creates it,

623
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:27,960
that's all you have.
So that is what you're selling so well,

624
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,090
who's making all the money and why and 
what's,

625
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,920
you know,
what is,

626
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,560
how has that worked out?
And right now there's a lot of 

627
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,380
opportunism going on and a lot of people
are jockeying for a better slice of the 

628
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:44,551
pie in a better position.
But we were talking about spotify and 

629
00:27:44,551 --> 00:27:48,901
all those different things and how 
little money the artists actually get 

630
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:48,901
out of it.
It's weird.

631
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,770
It is weird.
It is weird,

632
00:27:50,771 --> 00:27:51,100
isn't it?

633
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,010
I mean,
can you imagine like going playing gigs 

634
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,010
at the Moore Theater and then saying,
oh,

635
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,280
we're just going to pay you a streaming 
money,

636
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,590
not the real gig money.
You know what I mean?

637
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:03,170
It would be like,
that would make no sense.

638
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:05,150
Right?
I mean it's Kinda the same thing.

639
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:05,560
I mean,
you,

640
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:10,561
you,
you have a product that you invested 

641
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,560
your time and money into.
It should be no different really.

642
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:13,430
Right.

643
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,280
I think there should be some sort of 
established number.

644
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,840
You should be able to figure out how 
much money are they making from it,

645
00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:24,220
like how much money they make and if 
they play your one of your albums.

646
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:24,750
True.

647
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,750
Do you know streaming.
Streaming?

648
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,420
Yeah.
Zero,

649
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,910
zero,
five cents per click

650
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,170
point zero,
zero,

651
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,460
five cents for a click for them.
And if you buy the album,

652
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,740
how much is it per song?
How much are they paying for?

653
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:38,980
So

654
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,230
sure.

655
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,940
For,
for a physical copy,

656
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,060
if you buy the album like on itunes or 
on

657
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,900
CD,
cd or Itunes,

658
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:49,540
what is the difference?
What's the comparison to those?

659
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,200
You have a song is ninety nine cents.
You're looking at 30,

660
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:56,660
40 seconds,

661
00:28:56,930 --> 00:29:01,930
no one can hear you,
but he said if the song is ninety nine 

662
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:01,930
cents,
you're looking at 30 or forty cents.

663
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,220
[inaudible] think as compared to 
streaming,

664
00:29:04,221 --> 00:29:05,480
which is.
What'd you say at one?

665
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:06,080
Zero,
zero,

666
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:06,860
zero five.

667
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,700
Is that what you said?
Per time songs clicked.

668
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:12,940
Oh,
per time.

669
00:29:12,941 --> 00:29:14,860
Songs clicks or every time someone 
clicks on it,

670
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,330
it has to play for like 10 seconds.
Oh God.

671
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,920
It's just mass consumption.
It's weird.

672
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,110
Yeah.
Yeah.

673
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,600
Well,
it all started with being able to put it

674
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:28,950
on a server somewhere.
Right?

675
00:29:28,951 --> 00:29:33,951
It all started from being digital.
That's where things got odd where you 

676
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:38,001
could take someone stuff and you don't 
need any special recording equipment to 

677
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:42,501
make copies.
You make copy on your computer 

678
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:42,501
instantaneously.
You upload the copy and then

679
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:47,010
that copy shared by x amount of people 
who just continually download it and 

680
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:49,030
share it.
Things gets weird.

681
00:29:49,031 --> 00:29:52,060
They get real weird when it becomes a 
digital entity,

682
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,880
something that's out there in space and 
then figuring out how you make money off

683
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:59,881
of it,
but I would feel like a streaming 

684
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,210
platform.
All they have is someone's work.

685
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,850
If,
if no one lets them put their stuff up,

686
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,040
then they don't have anything.
Right?

687
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,280
Yeah.
Like the only benefit for you guys,

688
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,710
it'd be more exposure,
which would help like ticket sales,

689
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:12,120
you know,
the,

690
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,640
the major record labels own portions of 
these streaming services to.

691
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,310
Oh,
it gets pretty deep.

692
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,570
I mean it's,
it's uh,

693
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:25,050
it's just intertwined.
Nastiness and the artist pretty much 

694
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:29,581
falls at the bottom of the barrel.
So the record labels have done the same 

695
00:30:29,581 --> 00:30:32,950
thing that they used to do with physical
records and now they've done it with the

696
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:33,790
streaming thing.

697
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:38,260
They just hamstrings everybody.
Wow,

698
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:41,200
that's great.
So should people not use those streaming

699
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:42,610
services?
Is that the way to go?

700
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,810
I mean ultimately probably artists 
probably shouldn't allow it,

701
00:30:46,811 --> 00:30:49,100
but it's like,
um,

702
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,910
you can't.
Yeah.

703
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,160
You know,
you have to put it on there.

704
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,580
I Dunno.
So I should've,

705
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,700
I should've come with a spreadsheet and 
it's like,

706
00:31:00,701 --> 00:31:01,750
do you have the option?
Yeah.

707
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,310
So like when they come to you and they 
say,

708
00:31:03,311 --> 00:31:08,311
Hey dan,
we would want to put all your lily and 

709
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:08,311
you can say no,
thank you.

710
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:08,311
Yeah,
I see that.

711
00:31:08,311 --> 00:31:09,370
What you say or do you let them put it 
up there?

712
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,140
We don't have anything on title,
you know,

713
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,100
but we,
uh,

714
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,880
we have it on itunes.
They still pay it.

715
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,610
Then they pay the highest royalty rate,
right?

716
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,410
A itunes.

717
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,090
Yeah.
Yeah.

718
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,850
How's Google play?
Because they're doing that.

719
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,860
I don't have no idea.
That's the newest one.

720
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:27,520
I have no idea.
You know,

721
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:31,240
Google kind of they call own youtube so 
they get all that youtube money.

722
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,330
Right.
But don't they have to pay for like 

723
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:36,330
bandwidth and shit too?
Is,

724
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:36,330
isn't all that expensive?
I don't know.

725
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,860
I don't know.
Yeah,

726
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,140
but it's weird.
It's weird how the world has changed.

727
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:46,170
It's like I'm a musician now,
I have to worry about fucking this 

728
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:49,561
business side of shit now and we all 
have to like know about who owns all 

729
00:31:49,561 --> 00:31:53,020
these little portions of this shit.
I mean it's like that's why we get taken

730
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:56,230
advantage of because we're just trying 
to be artists and trying to make music.

731
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,310
We have to come become college 
professors to even figure out our record

732
00:32:00,311 --> 00:32:01,810
deals.
Do you know what I mean?

733
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,720
It's really unfair and when you sign a 
kid to a record deal,

734
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:09,721
it's like they,
they pretty much are signing their life 

735
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:09,721
on the line,
you know,

736
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:13,270
I'm sure you've read that piece that 
Courtney love wrote years back.

737
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:18,810
I don't think I've ever read anything.
It was pretty famous because a lot of 

738
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,710
people accused or using a ghost writer 
because it was so well done,

739
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:24,250
but it was a piece breaking down.
Like if you didn't know that she was the

740
00:32:24,251 --> 00:32:25,900
one who wrote it,
you would go,

741
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:30,901
Whoa,
this is a scathing review of how the 

742
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:30,901
money is distributed in the record 
business.

743
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:35,760
And uh,
it was pretty shocking when you look at 

744
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,120
it from terms of actual revenue to what 
actually trickles down to the artist was

745
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,480
the only thing that they're selling.
The artists work and how these,

746
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,360
these contracts are set up to fuck 
people over.

747
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,710
But they've been around forever.
And there's these giant machines,

748
00:32:48,711 --> 00:32:53,711
right?
They have so many employees and they 

749
00:32:53,711 --> 00:32:55,331
kind of have to justify keeping all 
these buildings and having all these 

750
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:57,710
employees and there's a lot of money 
that needs to be earned.

751
00:32:57,711 --> 00:32:59,270
Just to keep this thing floating.
Right?

752
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,430
Well,
it got so engorged.

753
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Yeah.
It's a tech at the height of physical 

754
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:06,700
sales,
right?

755
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,250
Yeah.
It's,

756
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:10,490
it's hard to like get used to a certain 
lifestyle.

757
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,630
Right.
I mean,

758
00:33:11,631 --> 00:33:14,910
you're going to move back into apartment
next week and yeah,

759
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,640
it would suck you.
Wouldn't you try to figure out how to.

760
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,800
You might cut his pay a little bit.
Maybe the officers that you know,

761
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,080
that's what they did.
Yeah.

762
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:25,100
They just wanted to.
Well,

763
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:29,180
they had to downsize quite a bit.
I used to love record stores.

764
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:32,480
I mean the last real job I had was in a 
record store.

765
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,630
Really last time I was ever really taxed
before being a musician.

766
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,000
I worked at quonset hut records in 
Akron,

767
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:42,110
Ohio and it was awesome.
I learned so much there.

768
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:47,810
I learned so much cool shit.
People hit me with so much great music 

769
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,340
that I never would have heard of.
Well back then.

770
00:33:49,341 --> 00:33:51,170
That was the way you could find out 
about it.

771
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,530
You go to the record stores and 
efficient autos would let you know about

772
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:57,290
dedicated their lives to learning about 
this stuff.

773
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,320
You know what I mean,
like essentially college professors of 

774
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,320
music.
Yeah.

775
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,130
The guys that I worked with were pretty 
much geniuses.

776
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:08,140
They were all like 45,
55 year old guys with like other living 

777
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,710
room is just all records,
you know what I mean?

778
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,010
And they would teach me things every 
time I would go in there like,

779
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,090
oh,
so you've never heard this?

780
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,010
Well then you got to hear this and you 
got to hear this.

781
00:34:16,011 --> 00:34:17,750
And it changed me.
You know,

782
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,840
isn't it funny that that is not like a 
respected quality in the mainstream 

783
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
world,
but being a Somalia is,

784
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:31,210
you know what I mean?
Being a guy who can like swish wine 

785
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,740
around and tell you what part of France 
it was grown like that's,

786
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,220
that's something that we look at it and 
go,

787
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,980
oh he's a sophisticated Somalia.
But like,

788
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,770
oh that dude,
he knows a lot about sixties jazz.

789
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:43,540
Nobody gives a shit.
Nobody gives a shit you loser.

790
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,310
I don't give a shit about Somalia and 
stuff.

791
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,290
So I mean,
I don't know,

792
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,830
you got to come up with a different 
comparison,

793
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:53,831
but you know what I mean,
like for a lot of people it's sure it's 

794
00:34:53,831 --> 00:34:55,010
a,
it's a big fancy schmancy type.

795
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:55,880
Well,
you know,

796
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,850
I mean it's all,
it's all a bunch of horse shit.

797
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,270
I mean it's like just because you don't 
have a college degree in it.

798
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,190
Yeah,
it's not taken seriously.

799
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,370
But what really is a college degree at 
the end of the day?

800
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,020
Well,
when it comes to music,

801
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:14,380
I mean imagine if the only good 
musicians were musicians who had phds 

802
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,520
and in music theory,
no,

803
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:20,180
it would be like North Korea.
I mean,

804
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,480
could you even put together the kind of 
music that you guys made?

805
00:35:23,481 --> 00:35:28,481
If,
if you really like thought about it in 

806
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:28,481
that way,
like your,

807
00:35:28,481 --> 00:35:31,410
your stuff is so uniquely creative,
you know what like you have,

808
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:35,970
you guys had a sound for a lot of your 
songs so it's like you would,

809
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,800
you would hear it and even though it was

810
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,620
interesting and unique and different 
from the previous song,

811
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:42,890
you could tell us a black key song.
It was,

812
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,930
it was coming from two guys,
you know,

813
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:51,200
clearly coming from two guys.
I think as soon as you add a lot of 

814
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:56,120
theory and overproduction and different 
people overseeing things and looking for

815
00:35:57,331 --> 00:35:59,880
the right amount of beats per minute and
all that jazz.

816
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,210
Listen man,
it's like the greatest people are just 

817
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,000
the greatest people.
When you,

818
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,390
if you could be around Richard Pryor,
watch him.

819
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,130
You would feel the magic.
You would see the way he walks,

820
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,590
the way he touches his lips,
the way he,

821
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,990
you know,
like when I'm hanging out with Dr John,

822
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,760
I see it.
I'm like,

823
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:24,750
Holy Shit,
this guy is like from another planet.

824
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,010
You know what I mean?
He just,

825
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,620
you can't teach that.
It's just,

826
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,050
it's total magic.
You know?

827
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,550
I can't even imagine like an la Dr John 
used to be here,

828
00:36:35,551 --> 00:36:37,830
so doing session work fit well.

829
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,800
That's like when Phil Spector was making
records and stuff like that,

830
00:36:40,801 --> 00:36:45,801
you know,
it would be a studio full of Dr Johns.

831
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:50,490
People that just had their own,
their own thing about him.

832
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,680
You know what I mean?
Total self confidence,

833
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,260
their own style.
No theory,

834
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,330
no bullshit.
It was just like,

835
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:02,380
this is,
this is what he does and we're going to 

836
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,480
incorporate this and this with 12 other 
guys who have their own thing.

837
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:06,030
It's like magic.
You know what I mean?

838
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:11,031
And that's a cool thing that studios 
would kind of lose now because people 

839
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:12,870
can't afford to have studios and things 
had changed so much.

840
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:15,990
Over time it gets depressing the more I 
work with these older,

841
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,000
older guys who are just insane.
It's just so hard to describe.

842
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:23,070
It really is.
It feels like magic.

843
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,460
Was it because everything they were 
doing was completely analog?

844
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:32,390
No,
because it was a performance and you 

845
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,450
need to like not only did you have to 
come up with the part on the spot,

846
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:34,830
it had to kind of improvise.

847
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:37,710
You had to play perfectly behind the 
beat.

848
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,040
You had to like,
you had to just like,

849
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,040
I don't.
It's just hard to explain.

850
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,610
You had to just kind of be able to 
understand the nuance of everything 

851
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:53,190
going on around you and there's less of 
that now.

852
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:58,490
I think that it's harder when people 
don't get to record together and make 

853
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:58,620
music together,
which is the case,

854
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,760
you know what I mean?
Because it's.

855
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You don't really make money make playing
music unless you reach a certain level 

856
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,060
and it's so much harder to now than it 
ever was before.

857
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,750
It's harder to reach a certain level.
Yeah.

858
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,040
It's just.
But doesn't youtube and things along 

859
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,201
those lines don't.
Doesn't it help some people reach a 

860
00:38:15,201 --> 00:38:15,330
higher level quicker without the need 
for mainstream media?

861
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,590
I don't know.
You don't know?

862
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,000
I don't know.
Beats me.

863
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:22,170
I don't know anybody who like got their 
start on youtube,

864
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,480
didn't honey honey band.

865
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:29,310
Then they become famous from youtube.
I think that's what started all about.

866
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,620
It's a combination of things.
It's hard to nail down on one.

867
00:38:32,430 --> 00:38:37,430
Yeah.
I mean we didn't do that but I mean we 

868
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:39,220
were like hit the road and we like 
playing shows and we just kept hitting 

869
00:38:39,521 --> 00:38:42,490
up city so I just,
I wouldn't know because I don't know.

870
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,670
I don't have experience with that.
So tell me about the arcs.

871
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:52,490
Will the arts is just a group of Friends
of mine who I made records with for 

872
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,911
years,
guys who make some of my favorite 

873
00:38:56,911 --> 00:38:56,911
records,
Leon Michaels,

874
00:38:56,911 --> 00:39:00,780
Richard Swift.
I'm Hammerstein Weisen and nick motion.

875
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:03,040
They're just great musicians,
you know,

876
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:08,070
and uh,
we've made different records together 

877
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:08,830
in,
in various forms for different people.

878
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,700
And then when we had free time we would 
record for ourselves just for fun,

879
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:18,180
just making stuff up.
And I'm Leon and I about a year and a 

880
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,880
half ago got together just to like 
categorize them,

881
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,910
put them in a folder to see what we had 
and we had like 70 songs while we're 

882
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,160
just sitting there.

883
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:30,290
So we're like,
what are we doing you now,

884
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,260
let's,
let's,

885
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:37,261
uh,
figure out a way to like share this 

886
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:37,261
music.
And um,

887
00:39:37,261 --> 00:39:40,140
so we just kind of came up with the rx 
and that was our platform that's 

888
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,620
insanely had 70 songs,
70 songs.

889
00:39:41,621 --> 00:39:42,850
Yeah.
I mean,

890
00:39:42,851 --> 00:39:46,390
every time we get in the studio together
with two or three songs,

891
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:48,310
we'll just,
we can just make them up,

892
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,840
you know?
Wow.

893
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:53,920
When you go into the studio,
do you have any idea?

894
00:39:53,921 --> 00:39:58,921
If you are,
if you're in a session where you might 

895
00:39:58,921 --> 00:40:01,320
improvise and come up with new stuff,
do you have any idea of what direction 

896
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,200
you're going to go in or do you have a 
concept or do you just go free ball?

897
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:10,710
You kind of.
I had just always a free freewill I 

898
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,930
guess.
Have you always done it that way?

899
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,850
Yeah,
so for the most part.

900
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,620
I mean I,
I don't,

901
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,990
I have had some songs written ahead of 
time,

902
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,840
but that's more recently when I started 
it,

903
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:22,140
we were just making shit up.
I mean black,

904
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:25,820
he's out there just totally improvised.
And so when you improvise,

905
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:28,750
would you have someone recording it as 
you're doing it or would you write it?

906
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,010
We did it all ourselves.
So in the basement it was just the two 

907
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,010
of us and we had a four track cassette 
recording them.

908
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,070
Yeah,
like a digital recorder.

909
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,190
Um,
yeah.

910
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,080
No,
I mean we didn't have anybody helping us

911
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,010
while.
Well that's why I was so cool.

912
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,830
I mean that's why it was such a,
you know,

913
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,860
there's hubs,
the I'll do big sessions now and 

914
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:52,860
there'll be like an assistant running 
around like taking notes,

915
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,280
like what guitar I'm using and Shit,
and I'm like,

916
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:58,120
oh this track.
So interesting now,

917
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,460
but it's just,
I just never had that growing up.

918
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,720
It just feel so weird.
So would you guys,

919
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:09,900
would you guys recorded initially as you
were improvising error or did you 

920
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,290
improvise it and get it down and then 
record it and improvise it?

921
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,640
Usually.
Usually like,

922
00:41:12,641 --> 00:41:15,160
uh,
the first or second take is,

923
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,920
is the one that's best.
Even with the mistakes,

924
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:23,280
it has the best feeling for me.
The more that you focus on stuff to 

925
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,640
them,
I guess the more boring it gets.

926
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:30,110
You lose that like initial spark to what
a fucking cool life you have.

927
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,240
You make cool and then you release them.
I'm not complaining.

928
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:42,940
Fuck man.
It's so cool the way you describe it to 

929
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,210
you just kind of go in there and fall 
into the trance and make the sounds.

930
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:51,020
And for me it's only gotten better.
The feeling.

931
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,030
I mean,
I,

932
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,780
you know,
I work harder than anybody I know.

933
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,660
I get up in the morning,
I started working and I don't work until

934
00:41:56,661 --> 00:41:58,310
I'm asleep.
I don't stop falling asleep,

935
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,780
you know,
everyday.

936
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,910
So I think if it is work or do you think
of it is like when I get paid,

937
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:06,530
I think if it is work,
but one of them doing it,

938
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:11,531
I never think of it as work.
So when the checks come it's worked 

939
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:11,531
well.
It was,

940
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:12,640
must have done some work while you're 
doing work.

941
00:42:12,641 --> 00:42:14,920
It's just passion.
Like how would you describe it?

942
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:16,120
Yeah,
it's pet.

943
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,830
I feel so lucky being able to go into 
the studio.

944
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,460
I love hearing shit like this man go and
living in Nashville too,

945
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:25,190
which is a place that is music city USA,
you know,

946
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,000
I mean,
you know,

947
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,740
you could argue that rock and roll 
started there with,

948
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,330
you know,
pretty woman.

949
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:32,900
Aaron,
Aaron,

950
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:33,380
Aaron,
Aaron,

951
00:42:33,381 --> 00:42:34,490
Aaron Room,
right.

952
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:39,760
That riff was done.
Wayne Moss did that riff right down the 

953
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:39,760
street.
Um,

954
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,300
uh,
you know,

955
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:44,720
it's just like,
I just love that stuff.

956
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:47,030
I love learning from those guys.
I love being around that.

957
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,670
It's just so much fun for me.
You know,

958
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,060
I had um,
wheeler Walker Jr in here the other day 

959
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,780
and uh,
we were talking about Nashville and he 

960
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,391
was talking about the money machine 
being behind Nashville now and how 

961
00:43:01,391 --> 00:43:03,200
strange it is that you have some real 
music in that town,

962
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:08,380
but then you also have this stuff that 
is just concocted because it looks like 

963
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,340
it would do numbers and Walmart.
Yeah.

964
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:12,100
But you know,
we're,

965
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:14,660
we're,
doesn't that happen on some,

966
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,790
at some level it's a music business.
Yeah.

967
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,860
You're always going to have that,
right?

968
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:19,790
Yeah.
It's a business.

969
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,040
I mean,
you're always going to have douche holes

970
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,200
making a lot of money,
a lot more money than you.

971
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:26,960
You know what I mean?
But the thing that,

972
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,220
that's so great about that,
I don't fucking ever see that.

973
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:34,250
I'm never around that.
I don't fuck with that at all.

974
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:37,010
You know what I mean?
And I've been in Nashville six years,

975
00:43:37,011 --> 00:43:37,910
seven years,
something like that.

976
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,240
But the thing that's so cool about that 
is they really do a hold up that 

977
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:46,100
infrastructure and like if I run out of 
tape,

978
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:51,520
I make a phone call and somebody 
delivers me reel to reel tape and like 

979
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:51,520
10 minutes.
Really?

980
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,460
Where else can you do that happened?
You know what I mean?

981
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:56,900
If that big business wasn't going on,
it wouldn't make it so easy for me to be

982
00:43:56,901 --> 00:44:01,901
around so many great musicians.
A lot of these country guys that I work 

983
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:01,901
with,
um,

984
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:07,120
you know,
they're embarrassed with some of the 

985
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,400
shit that they play on.
They won't tell me how bad it is,

986
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:14,200
but,
but it's the reason they're there and 

987
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,020
healthy and able to come in and work 
with me,

988
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:20,180
you know what I mean?
So you can't complain about it and then 

989
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:21,310
reap all the benefits,
you know what I mean?

990
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,810
So I understand that.
Just like positive negatives,

991
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:26,660
that's very honest of you.
That's a good way of looking at it too.

992
00:44:26,661 --> 00:44:29,120
That's a very good perspective because 
it's not like it hurts you.

993
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,100
You know,
if you drive down the street,

994
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:31,980
a burger

995
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,880
king,
it doesn't hurt you.

996
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:34,240
If you don't go in there and eat,
I,

997
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,250
I'm,
I make a living playing music and 

998
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:39,300
Nashville and I never see it.
That's interesting.

999
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,430
Well you just surround yourself with a 
tight knit group.

1000
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,480
I guess.
I never leave home,

1001
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:46,770
so that's.
I never see it.

1002
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,800
Yeah.
Nashville is for,

1003
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,070
for a lot of musicians.
Like that is the,

1004
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,660
that's the remaining Mecca,
right.

1005
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:57,150
Um,
well for,

1006
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,840
for certain musicians,
people who love country and Bluegrass,

1007
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,790
it's definitely the place to be,
you know,

1008
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:06,870
bluegrass still lives in Nashville more 
than anywhere else I'd say.

1009
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,510
It seems like this is a really good time
for country.

1010
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,020
It seems our country is experiencing a 
resurgence right now.

1011
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,350
Like real country.
Yeah.

1012
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:21,390
I think that um,
I have no idea really.

1013
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,970
I don't know what to say about that.
No,

1014
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,600
you're in the mix though.
He's going to say something stupid about

1015
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:27,390
people buying records.

1016
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,420
Walmart behind them or whatever.
That's very nice of you to pull back 

1017
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,720
out.
It wouldn't look at me getting smart 

1018
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:37,720
with age.
It's also,

1019
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:37,880
uh,
we'd,

1020
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,500
we'd have to be double,
triple thinking stuff.

1021
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:42,480
I pull it back,
son.

1022
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,400
No need for conflict.
No,

1023
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:45,060
I mean,
uh,

1024
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,760
I mean it's,
you know,

1025
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,680
country,
country fans buy more out,

1026
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,750
more physical copies than anyone.
Oh really?

1027
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:52,920
By far.
Yeah.

1028
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,540
No kidding.
Yeah,

1029
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,980
absolutely.
Really?

1030
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,150
They probably still use CD things.
Probably have those.

1031
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:05,151
Walkmans was mega big hip ones with the 
big bellies yelling the neat things.

1032
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:06,620
Always yellow.
Yeah,

1033
00:46:06,621 --> 00:46:07,980
that's good question.
And they just like,

1034
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,740
yeah,
that could never be black fellows.

1035
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,980
Yellow.
I was true.

1036
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:16,120
It's like hazard.
There was always like a hazard to them 

1037
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:18,441
or something like there were big.
All I wanted was that big yellow disc 

1038
00:46:18,441 --> 00:46:19,710
and the Tony Hawk skateboard.
It's like all I ever wanted.

1039
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:25,190
Well I remember when they figured out a 
way to have some sort of buffering so 

1040
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,821
that when you were playing the cd you 
could actually jump around a little bit 

1041
00:46:28,821 --> 00:46:30,360
and move and it wouldn't skip.
It was crazy.

1042
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,140
What did that feel when that happened 
to,

1043
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:32,710
for that?
Yes.

1044
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,690
P Esp ten second esp if that's right.
Yeah.

1045
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:40,140
It was a buffering that they had seen.
There was a magical thing.

1046
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,180
Skip protection,
something,

1047
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,850
something electronic.
Skip protection is what it is.

1048
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,800
It is.
And then once they figured out how to go

1049
00:46:46,801 --> 00:46:48,210
digital,
all that shit tied.

1050
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,910
Can you imagine these have record 
players in cars?

1051
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,210
Did it for real?
Some early cars.

1052
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:55,920
Used to have the option.
Wow.

1053
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:01,250
My friend Javier,
his mom had an eight track and never 

1054
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:01,920
forgot who listened to Pablo Cruz.
While my baby smiles at me,

1055
00:47:01,921 --> 00:47:05,420
I go to Rio and it was in those eight 
track things like this is a.

1056
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,280
What is crazy space age contraption.
This lady has an.

1057
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:11,820
Her car is pushed this box in there and 
it plays music.

1058
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:13,050
It was amazing.
You know.

1059
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,840
Oh look at this.
This is crazy.

1060
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:20,841
Here you go.
We're looking at a woman playing 40 

1061
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:20,841
fives in her car.
What kind of car is it?

1062
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,920
That was a record player.
This is nuts.

1063
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:29,030
That is nuts.
It's a record player where the ashtray 

1064
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:30,760
sort of would be in a conventional car.
Wow,

1065
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,060
that's crazy.
Every two and a half minutes you have to

1066
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:37,750
like look down and flip a record.
Can you imagine those old cars?

1067
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:40,030
Man?
There was something about those old cars

1068
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,230
too.
There were.

1069
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,990
There were a rolling piece of artwork as
well.

1070
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:49,050
There was some design and art to them 
that just you can't once you started 

1071
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,340
going with aerodynamics and miles per 
gallon and airbags and shit happening on

1072
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:55,300
the dash.

1073
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,280
Yeah.
There's something with those cars.

1074
00:47:57,281 --> 00:48:02,281
It's just so extraordinary.
I got to see the car the other day with 

1075
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:03,700
this digital touchscreen thing.
It was like Tesla was a tesla.

1076
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,250
No,
I've never been in a tesla.

1077
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,730
I don't remember what it was,
but it was just so weird.

1078
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:13,060
Yet a lot of the electric cars have real
crazy setups now.

1079
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,680
Very strange.
Yeah.

1080
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:18,460
The Tesla is a giant screen,
like an enormous laptop screen,

1081
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,700
like a big computer screen.
Like that's what a tesla screen looks 

1082
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:23,700
like.
I mean,

1083
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,830
it's like a crazy laptop though.
That's not a distraction,

1084
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,520
isn't by the way you can get email on 
that and websites.

1085
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,350
It's like,
show me my flight path.

1086
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,270
You can,
you can do all that kind of stuff.

1087
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:38,950
You can do spotify on that to where you 
can press a little button and ask it to,

1088
00:48:38,951 --> 00:48:40,270
uh,
you know,

1089
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,670
play Michael Jackson and it'll play 
Michael Jackson songs.

1090
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,970
It's so stupid.
It's so big.

1091
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:50,320
It's a totally flat screen and you can 
judge man.

1092
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,330
Is that a youtube video?
That guy's in the right hand side.

1093
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:53,920
You can play youtube videos where you 
drive.

1094
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:55,390
Oh,
that's so dangerous.

1095
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,000
Did you see that guy that got killed in 
Detroit?

1096
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,750
He was jacking off in his car.
He crashed his car with his pants down.

1097
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:07,020
Died in the accident.
He was watching porn Jackin off as he 

1098
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,450
was driving.
And the state troopers,

1099
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:09,700
when they got to the wreck due to his 
pants down.

1100
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:10,890
Porn playing?

1101
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,690
No.

1102
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,750
Oh Man.
His kids in the eyes in rec watching 

1103
00:49:20,331 --> 00:49:22,910
porn.
Did they make their user's name?

1104
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:29,680
Clifford Ray Jones partially ejected 
through the sun roof when his 19,

1105
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:34,880
96 Toyota rolled and he was thrown from 
the vehicle and died.

1106
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:37,970
He wasn't wearing pants.
Police told the Detroit News.

1107
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:44,940
Oh,
well,

1108
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,500
driver inattention is leading factor in 
most crashes and near crashes.

1109
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,730
Okay,
wait a second.

1110
00:49:50,731 --> 00:49:52,440
What was he doing?
Was He watching a movie?

1111
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,050
Who's jacking off?
He was watching porn was pants off.

1112
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:56,700
This said it was in [inaudible] 96 
Corolla.

1113
00:49:56,701 --> 00:49:58,200
Where the fuck did you get that screen 
in there?

1114
00:49:58,380 --> 00:49:59,280
Well,
he had it in his phone.

1115
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,130
He was watching porn on his phone and 
jerking off.

1116
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,640
Oh God.
Kids an animal.

1117
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,390
He was 58.
Oh my God.

1118
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:14,430
You Retard.
Well,

1119
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,100
he should have known better old people 
in electronics,

1120
00:50:17,101 --> 00:50:17,970
man.
Yeah.

1121
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:20,580
That wasn't figured.
It wasn't because he was choking up.

1122
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:22,320
It was just because he was old.
May Be.

1123
00:50:22,321 --> 00:50:24,390
You never know.
You never know.

1124
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,580
Are you a car guy you into cars?
No,

1125
00:50:26,581 --> 00:50:27,740
not really.
No.

1126
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,290
I mean I've got a couple of cars,
but now a couple of old cars.

1127
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,060
I just.
What I figured you for,

1128
00:50:32,061 --> 00:50:33,800
I figured you feel like an mg or 
something.

1129
00:50:33,801 --> 00:50:37,970
Like I've got an old Ford panel van that
I drive around town.

1130
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,520
You know?
Panel van?

1131
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,900
Yeah.
Nineteen 60.

1132
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,780
Were you talking about like wood panels 
on the side?

1133
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:46,340
No,
just agreeing work truck.

1134
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,460
You know,
with the barn doors that opened in the 

1135
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:51,460
back.
Really?

1136
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:55,510
Yeah.
I used to deliver newspapers in one of 

1137
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:55,510
those.
I had a dodge just like A.

1138
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,630
I love it man.
What do you drive a van for?

1139
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:58,990
It's not like a van,
it looks like a,

1140
00:50:58,991 --> 00:51:00,590
it looks pretty cool.
Yeah.

1141
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,690
Yeah.
I mean it's kind of beat up.

1142
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:04,580
I don't have to worry about it.
Does that,

1143
00:51:04,581 --> 00:51:07,720
why you like it or b,
you could score stuff here.

1144
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:09,060
All my equipment in it,
you know,

1145
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:12,700
it's really easy to holds five people 
and if people want to sit in the back of

1146
00:51:12,701 --> 00:51:13,750
hold is 10,
you know,

1147
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:15,960
I don't know.
So Dude,

1148
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,750
you're just all about getting your music
done.

1149
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:23,070
You don't give a fuck.
You driving around a panel van getting 

1150
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:25,910
all beat up.
I bought a new BMW like uh,

1151
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,880
four years ago.
I still have it.

1152
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,340
It's starting to fall apart already.
Really?

1153
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:31,840
I,
yeah.

1154
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:36,890
All these things keep flashing and like,
do you take it and get the notices in 

1155
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:37,190
the mail?

1156
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,080
You know,
notice is like really?

1157
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,690
Meg May shoot shrapnel and you know,
it's like,

1158
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,160
what model bmw did you get?
Um,

1159
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,110
it's a uh,
uh,

1160
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,990
what's it called?
Thex x five x five.

1161
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:52,460
It's a diesel.
Okay.

1162
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:53,900
That's,
that's your problem.

1163
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,090
Which is a total pain in the ass trying 
to find diesel gas.

1164
00:51:56,091 --> 00:51:58,100
So that's gross to me.
Well,

1165
00:51:58,101 --> 00:52:03,101
the only thing about diesel,
that's cool as you could grow your own 

1166
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:03,101
like um.
Oh,

1167
00:52:03,101 --> 00:52:03,330
I grew up my own.
Do you make your own needs?

1168
00:52:03,331 --> 00:52:03,910
Oh No,
no,

1169
00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:06,710
no.
Nobody goes,

1170
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:08,800
does nobody grows around?
Do you know Neil young does?

1171
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,440
No,
he doesn't.

1172
00:52:09,441 --> 00:52:12,650
He makes his own biodiesel.
He pays somebody to grow his own diesel.

1173
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:13,940
He makes money off it.
Okay.

1174
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,230
Um,
you might be right,

1175
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:17,510
but I think he was trying to be self 
sustaining though.

1176
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,280
So he might not be selling maybe is.

1177
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:19,910
That's cool.
He,

1178
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,010
he's got some amazing cars.
Yeah.

1179
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:25,680
He has a gigantic ranch in northern 
California and uh,

1180
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:29,680
he does grow his own bio diesel and he 
has his car is converted to,

1181
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,310
to use it.
Yeah,

1182
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,260
right.
I've heard about that ranch.

1183
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,860
Like he,
he bought it early on the farmer.

1184
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:41,920
Yeah.
And he has some crazy sound system set 

1185
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:41,920
up on his lake where you can get in a 
boat.

1186
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:43,850
Allegedly.
Someone told us this,

1187
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,680
I believe on the podcast and he gets out
on this boat and he has the sound system

1188
00:52:48,681 --> 00:52:53,681
set up where the acoustics are perfect.
When he's in the middle of this pond 

1189
00:52:53,681 --> 00:52:58,151
that he has,
and so he has he speakers set up on the 

1190
00:52:58,151 --> 00:53:00,671
side and around the pond and it just 
blast the perfect sound that echoes off 

1191
00:53:00,671 --> 00:53:01,760
the water epic.
Yeah,

1192
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:06,970
he's a bad motherfucker.
He's the reason why I had to quit work 

1193
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:07,850
at security at a great woods in 
Mansfield,

1194
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:12,851
Massachusetts when I was 19,
cause a riot broke out during a neil 

1195
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:14,270
young concert because people were 
lighting fires.

1196
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:19,570
If you ever been a great woods,
do you know the great woods performance 

1197
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:20,220
center is?
Maybe it's an outdoor amphitheater.

1198
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:21,170
Yeah,
it's an amphitheater.

1199
00:53:21,171 --> 00:53:26,171
It's covered up into the back area,
which is called the lawn in the back 

1200
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:26,171
area

1201
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:29,190
was literally like a sweeping law in,
in those cheap proceeds.

1202
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,470
Sure.
And when Neil young was there,

1203
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,680
people started fires there.
They just started lighting garbage on 

1204
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,810
fire and then fights broke out and then 
it was just chaos and I had a jacket.

1205
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:42,090
I put a Hoodie on over my security guard
jacket.

1206
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,890
I fucking put my hoodie on.
I was like,

1207
00:53:43,891 --> 00:53:47,610
I quit.
Walked out of there like fuck this place

1208
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:52,880
and I'll never forget the last hour 
worked with during the Neil Young 

1209
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,020
concert and as I was leaving people were
punching people and there was fire and I

1210
00:53:55,021 --> 00:53:56,790
was like,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.

1211
00:53:56,791 --> 00:54:01,791
Yeah.
I've worked at one of those 

1212
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:01,791
amphitheaters blossom music center.
Oh yeah.

1213
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:02,520
Where's that?
Outside of Cleveland.

1214
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:04,980
Richfield.
Another Ohio boy right there.

1215
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:06,300
You know,
blossom music center.

1216
00:54:06,301 --> 00:54:07,080
Yeah.
Columbus.

1217
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:09,090
I used to.
Me and my buddies used to be the guys in

1218
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:14,091
the parking lot with flags.
Why are so many bad motherfuckers from 

1219
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:14,091
Ohio?
What's going on?

1220
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:14,670
Why is that state so bad ass?

1221
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,150
I don't know.
I think that it had a,

1222
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,530
I think that had a lot of money,
uh,

1223
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,460
with all the industry,
so it had a lot of art.

1224
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:26,710
But now that now that the industry is 
gone,

1225
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,160
it's kind of,
it's a struggle a bit,

1226
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:31,080
but the art still there,
right?

1227
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:33,090
The NFL,
the culture,

1228
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:38,160
right.
Understanding that there's respect for 

1229
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,160
art,
I think.

1230
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,760
I Dunno,
I just totally made that up.

1231
00:54:38,761 --> 00:54:41,490
But you might be right.
That might make sense that,

1232
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,180
that sounds.
There's something,

1233
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:48,590
there's something,
there's a bunch of astronauts are from 

1234
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:48,590
Ohio,
tons of famous,

1235
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,920
a lot of people I've met just here since
I've lived here from Ohio.

1236
00:54:49,950 --> 00:54:52,760
Just hanging around and whatnot is a bad
ass place.

1237
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,870
Do standup too.
It's one of my favorite places.

1238
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,780
One of the,
um,

1239
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:02,120
one of the female astronauts who died in
the challenger explosion was from,

1240
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,730
with my high school.
Where was that?

1241
00:55:04,790 --> 00:55:09,790
Female astronauts from that war.
The diaper that went to the guy's house 

1242
00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:12,941
to kill him.
She wore the diaper to drive all the way

1243
00:55:13,491 --> 00:55:15,710
across the country.
So she didn't have to stop the PPI.

1244
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:23,730
Some girl or something.
I remember that girl is willing to 

1245
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,140
fucking wear astronaut charged with 
attempted murder anytime.

1246
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,500
A chick as willing to wear a diaper.
You fucked her up so bad.

1247
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:32,600
She wants to wear a diaper

1248
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:35,110
to come and get you.
I mean,

1249
00:55:35,111 --> 00:55:37,570
would you think that a female astronaut 
would like,

1250
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,460
she doesn't play games.
She wants to win.

1251
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,910
Not plugins.
You've got the right stuff,

1252
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:42,930
dude.
Absolutely.

1253
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,270
Arrival for another astronauts.
Affection.

1254
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:51,050
Yeah.
She attacked a rival for another 

1255
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,971
astronauts affection the Orlando 
International Airport on Monday after 

1256
00:55:52,971 --> 00:55:55,200
driving more than 900 miles from Houston
to meet her flight.

1257
00:55:55,410 --> 00:55:56,970
Whoa.
Okay.

1258
00:55:56,971 --> 00:55:59,340
So this girl was flying and this crazy 
bitch said,

1259
00:55:59,341 --> 00:56:04,341
I'm on a fucking meet you.
They're wearing a diaper shitting 

1260
00:56:04,981 --> 00:56:09,981
herself.
She only had a four inch blade and a bb 

1261
00:56:09,981 --> 00:56:09,981
gun though.
She's an astronauts.

1262
00:56:09,981 --> 00:56:11,220
All she needs,
she kill that bitch with a pop.

1263
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,110
Know that astronauts knew how to kill 
people.

1264
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,510
They teach you that.
They're Americans.

1265
00:56:15,511 --> 00:56:16,920
Goddammit.
They learn.

1266
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,380
Um,
I wonder,

1267
00:56:19,381 --> 00:56:21,210
man,
I wonder what she knew.

1268
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,630
Maybe she just wanted to close our eyes 
or something.

1269
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,000
Just bite her in the face or something.
Yikes.

1270
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:27,640
Maybe she didn't really want to kill 
her.

1271
00:56:28,030 --> 00:56:29,110
She had a bb gun though.

1272
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,900
And a map to the house.
Well,

1273
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:36,901
listen,
anybody who's wearing a diaper ain't 

1274
00:56:36,901 --> 00:56:38,491
thinking that straight.
Maybe she knows the BB gun when she 

1275
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:38,491
picked it up.
It's awesome.

1276
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:42,120
She had a map to the house x.
well,

1277
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,470
do you know the story about the guy who 
broke into the White House?

1278
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,090
Only one guy ever broken the White House
during the Obama Administration and I've

1279
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:54,091
been researching.
Is he the only one who's ever broken 

1280
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:54,370
that one ever during the Obama?
Yeah.

1281
00:56:55,030 --> 00:57:00,030
He had in his car two,
two rifles for hand guns.

1282
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:07,080
800 rounds of ammunition to hatchets and
a machete and he broke into the White 

1283
00:57:08,770 --> 00:57:11,950
House with a knife on him and he only 
got 18 months.

1284
00:57:12,310 --> 00:57:13,320
That's what's really crazy.
They said,

1285
00:57:13,321 --> 00:57:14,410
well,
he had ptsd.

1286
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:15,230
Oh,
okay.

1287
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:20,660
It's called the roof like plead deal.
We bars to the door and there was a 

1288
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,120
woman security guard and she couldn't 
stop him.

1289
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,820
He was too big and he ran past her and 
he got deep in.

1290
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:29,880
You got deep in the White House,
like deeper than they had originally 

1291
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:29,880
admitted.
Did he?

1292
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,941
Uh,
did he have a map like with x at the 

1293
00:57:32,941 --> 00:57:32,941
end?
That's what it was going to say.

1294
00:57:32,941 --> 00:57:37,030
He had a map like White House x is dumb.
Fuck,

1295
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:42,090
this guy was completely out of his mind.
But the crazy thing is the only got 18 

1296
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:45,421
months.
Like I know a guy was in jail for 10 

1297
00:57:45,421 --> 00:57:48,541
years for growing weed.
He's in federal penitentiary for 10 

1298
00:57:48,541 --> 00:57:51,961
years for growing weed and this guy got 
18 months for having an arsenal in his 

1299
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:54,040
car and breaking into the White House 
with a knife.

1300
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:59,130
Idiocracy man.
You see that cop in New York just got a 

1301
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,090
convicted of manslaughter but didn't get
any jail time.

1302
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,750
Which comp.
Which story just just happened the other

1303
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:06,190
day.
I forget.

1304
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:12,060
Do you know what the case was?
I think it was at one of those cases 

1305
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,750
where he had the duty where he was in 
like consorted patrolling the stairwells

1306
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:15,970
and projects,
which sounds horrifying.

1307
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,450
No jail time for x and y PD officer 
after manslaughter conviction reduced to

1308
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,460
criminally negligent homicide.
Huh?

1309
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,070
What does it say?
And he did Jamie.

1310
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,380
I'm just saying it's like seems like 
everyday there's just something that 

1311
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:36,430
doesn't make any sense.
Well,

1312
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:39,940
there's definitely a lot of stuff that 
doesn't make any sense and also a lot of

1313
00:58:39,941 --> 00:58:42,070
stuff you have to deal with if you're a 
fucking cop.

1314
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:45,520
I think this is a subject that requires 
balance.

1315
00:58:45,521 --> 00:58:48,880
I think there's a lot of terrible things
at cops had done and it's obvious you've

1316
00:58:48,881 --> 00:58:53,881
seen videos of it.
We saw that cop shoot that guy in the 

1317
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:53,881
back running away and then throw the 
Taser on them.

1318
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:58,120
We've all seen horrible shift seeing it.
I think these guys are shellshocked.

1319
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:03,240
I think there's a vast majority of the 
people out there that are operating as 

1320
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,390
police officers that are barely keeping 
it together.

1321
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:09,780
I think it's a hard job and I think 
those guys are under stress all the 

1322
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,171
time.
Every day might be the end of their 

1323
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:13,171
life.

1324
00:59:13,171 --> 00:59:13,210
Every car they pull over might be 
someone who shoots him.

1325
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,490
You walk into places and you're hated 
instantly,

1326
00:59:15,491 --> 00:59:17,560
instantly everybody's line.
It shouldn't be the opposite.

1327
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,440
Yeah,
everybody's lying to and on top of that,

1328
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:25,590
they've set up as the enemy and as the 
enemy by making them glorified revenue 

1329
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:29,501
collector's pulling people over for 
having a fucking traffic ticker.

1330
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:30,760
You know your,
your,

1331
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:34,940
your blinkers not working or you were 
licensed plates expired all shit.

1332
00:59:34,941 --> 00:59:36,980
That has nothing to do with crime.
You know?

1333
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:42,610
I think there's a lot of that going on 
where they give them quotas on speeding 

1334
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:42,610
tickets and they turned them into the 
enemy.

1335
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:44,810
You're taking money from people,
you're stealing from people.

1336
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,840
They're being used,
they're being used and.

1337
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,940
Yeah,
and it's not right.

1338
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:55,460
I just always hope that with when people
talk about stuff like this and all these

1339
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:57,800
videos that are getting out and people 
the awareness of it,

1340
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:03,250
that it'll bounce back the other way.
Then people will realize it and the 

1341
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,210
people somehow or another,
it'll be a self correcting thing.

1342
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,960
You think that's going to happen?
I don't know.

1343
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,720
I don't think so.
They don't think it's in time.

1344
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:17,200
The things that are self correcting A.
I think it's some famous white person 

1345
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:19,310
has to die and then maybe it'll get 
corrected.

1346
01:00:19,430 --> 01:00:20,330
Oh,
white people.

1347
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:21,360
I see.
Hmm.

1348
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:23,990
Might be.
It might be right.

1349
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,750
Yeah.
It seems to be when people take notice.

1350
01:00:28,170 --> 01:00:30,800
I saw that interview that you did with 
that ex Baltimore cop.

1351
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:32,000
Yeah.
He's coming back in.

1352
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,220
Boy that that was like,
that should be,

1353
01:00:34,221 --> 01:00:35,930
um,
required viewing.

1354
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:37,160
Yeah.
He's running for.

1355
01:00:37,161 --> 01:00:40,840
I'm chief of police of Chicago.
He wants to take over Chicago.

1356
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:45,860
He thinks he can make some leeway.
He's going to come in and talk about 

1357
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:49,601
that.
That's what an uphill battle that would 

1358
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:49,601
be.
Well,

1359
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:49,601
if anybody's going to do it,
it's going to be a guy like him.

1360
01:00:49,601 --> 01:00:52,520
A radical thinker.
I don't mean fighting the crime.

1361
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,230
I mean,
I mean changing the politics.

1362
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,700
Yeah,
that would be the uphill battle,

1363
01:00:55,730 --> 01:00:57,650
but both would be a problem.
You know,

1364
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,680
Chicago became a blood bath after they 
started arresting key gang members that 

1365
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,911
were in control of a drug distribution.
So they created a power vacuum and you 

1366
01:01:07,461 --> 01:01:08,990
know,
much like hats happened.

1367
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:11,120
Isn't that why they call it rec?
What's that?

1368
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:13,160
Isn't that why they call it Cerec?
Is that what they call it?

1369
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,780
Yeah,
well they call it rec.

1370
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,580
You knew that Jamie is on black twitter 
on a regular basis.

1371
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:21,350
We just came out.
He called it that too.

1372
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,730
That was in the SPEC.
That's what they call it.

1373
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,990
That's what locals call it.
I'm so white because it was a little war

1374
01:01:25,991 --> 01:01:27,140
zone.
Yeah.

1375
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,670
It isn't more zone,
but it's essentially.

1376
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:31,910
I didn't know that,
but it seems like kind of the same thing

1377
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:35,750
where you take out people in power and 
then it's just chaos.

1378
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,130
Well,
we were there,

1379
01:01:37,131 --> 01:01:42,131
um,
about a year and a half ago and there 

1380
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:42,131
was a guy who,
uh,

1381
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,720
I was talking with down there that used 
to be a cop and now he was a limo driver

1382
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:49,990
and uh,
he was telling me what it was like and 

1383
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:49,990
that it's always been a problem.
He's like,

1384
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:52,820
but then when they decided to go in and 
make some key arrests,

1385
01:01:53,030 --> 01:01:58,030
they had created a bit of a power vacuum
and then it all ramped up where people 

1386
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:00,290
were trying to.
And then there was also like,

1387
01:02:00,291 --> 01:02:05,291
once the violence has wrapped up,
then people want to respond to that 

1388
01:02:05,291 --> 01:02:06,470
violence and it ramps it up even more.
And how do you stop that,

1389
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:07,300
you know,
I mean,

1390
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:10,530
but if anybody knows it's going to be a 
guy like Michael Wood.

1391
01:02:10,531 --> 01:02:12,040
It's going to be a guy who was a former 
cop,

1392
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:17,080
worked in Baltimore who understood.
Is he thinking about drugs as you think 

1393
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,080
they're going to need to be legalized?

1394
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:17,450
Yeah,
I think so.

1395
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,500
Yeah.
I don't think he's in locking up for 

1396
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:23,760
anything that they want to do.
I think everybody agrees to that.

1397
01:02:23,761 --> 01:02:26,730
I mean this,
there's those nonviolent crimes.

1398
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,470
To have these prisons filled up with 
nonviolent crimes is very bizarre,

1399
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,390
especially when it's not violent.
It's embarrassing.

1400
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,550
It's embarrassing to be embarrassed.
We should be.

1401
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:39,930
We fucking run so many people's lives 
and it doesn't look good.

1402
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,240
They're going to do anything about it.
People make too much money.

1403
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,000
Well,
people with political influence,

1404
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:46,770
well,
private prisons just.

1405
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:51,860
And then when that judge got caught in 
Pennsylvania for taking young kids and 

1406
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:56,361
locking them up in jail for money and 
that he was getting some sort of a 

1407
01:02:56,361 --> 01:03:00,050
kickback from these detention institutes
where they would send young juvenile 

1408
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:00,750
detention.
Man,

1409
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,080
I'm just to know that there's people out
there that are working in justice that 

1410
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:06,490
would be willing to take money and 
sacrifice.

1411
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:07,950
I'm young kids future.
Yeah.

1412
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,510
I mean,
that's really,

1413
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:12,210
really scary that these are the people 
that we made justice to.

1414
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,970
That's heinous.
I mean,

1415
01:03:14,971 --> 01:03:18,240
I,
I get so scared thinking about my kids.

1416
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,140
Uh,
you know,

1417
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,700
I mean,
every single day you see crazy shit.

1418
01:03:23,810 --> 01:03:25,010
You know,
you see something like,

1419
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,770
you know,
black kid killed by a cop.

1420
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,740
You know,
it's like Jesus Christ.

1421
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:37,040
It's like never ending.
It does make me kind of want to not 

1422
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,040
leave my house.
Sometimes it's awful,

1423
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,360
but it's also off of black kids,
killed by black kids,

1424
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:42,720
white kids killed by white violence in 
and of itself.

1425
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,860
It's such a it at this point,
not not realize I'm only ever,

1426
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,420
I only ever going to Worldstar or you 
should get off.

1427
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:54,690
My favorite video worldstar was this 
week to the one with the little cub 

1428
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:55,380
wrestling a dog.
Jesus Christ.

1429
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,240
I didn't see this little baby bear.

1430
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,460
Fuck this dog up.
Who was a grown dog man.

1431
01:04:00,490 --> 01:04:05,490
It's a little tiny bear and it looked 
like the dog was fucking with the bear 

1432
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:09,110
and then the bears like Fitch just 
grabbed it by his head and just ragdoll 

1433
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:09,690
at them.
It's on my instagram.

1434
01:04:10,110 --> 01:04:15,110
It is crazy.
Like you can't believe how strong this 

1435
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:17,370
little tiny bear is in comparison to a 
full grown dog that's twice the size.

1436
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,020
He's throws them around like,
look at this,

1437
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,420
look at this dog is fucking.
Was like bitch,

1438
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:24,870
yikes.
Like he just,

1439
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:27,060
he's.
He ragdoll says dog wash.

1440
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:28,680
The dog gets out,
watch his hip toss.

1441
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,330
Watch this ad right here.
Boom,

1442
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:31,680
dude.
That's technique.

1443
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:33,600
Look like,
take control.

1444
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,090
That dog knows what the fuck is going on
or that bear rather.

1445
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,300
Wait a second.
Play that again and do the commentary.

1446
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:44,510
That was cool.
I'll show you exactly what's going on 

1447
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,510
here.

1448
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,510
See the dogs fuck with.
He's like,

1449
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:44,640
no bitch.
He got the Thai clinch.

1450
01:04:44,641 --> 01:04:46,590
First of all,
it gets the plum around the neck.

1451
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:48,540
Ragdoll them to the ground.
Dogs.

1452
01:04:48,541 --> 01:04:53,541
Try to reach around behind him.
He had just flips a dog on his back and 

1453
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,110
they looked at hip toss.
The hip toss at the end is huge.

1454
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,640
He's got the scarf hold.
Hold it on that thing.

1455
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,810
It's huge.
It's huge because that's.

1456
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:06,060
He established his position.
He did and he gave it up very quickly,

1457
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:08,340
but well because he's smart.
He knew it was going to get reversed.

1458
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,340
Well,
I apparently the doug has jujitsu and he

1459
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,860
wanted to stay so big.
He's a goon.

1460
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:15,750
They wanted to keep it up.
The dogs are goon.

1461
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,230
The bear's going to win.
Eventually it's going to.

1462
01:05:17,260 --> 01:05:18,010
He's going to have to cook

1463
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,030
them.
It's going to take some time,

1464
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,360
but trust me,
the bad I got my dog is a goon.

1465
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,760
Yeah,
he's a good good.

1466
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:29,060
How dare you.
Goon is when you roll with someone and 

1467
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:31,891
they're not good.
They're just strong and they throw you 

1468
01:05:31,891 --> 01:05:31,900
off of them.
You just got to ride the boat.

1469
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:37,140
You've got to figure out a way to ride.
Isn't it like most people with big 

1470
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:37,140
muscles though?
A lot of people who have big muscles.

1471
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:41,970
I mean I'm a boxing fan and like when 
somebody walks in to the ring and they 

1472
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:43,930
bet a lot of muscles,
I pretty much automatically know they're

1473
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:45,100
going to lose.
I got two words for you,

1474
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:50,130
Mike Tyson.
That's what you get when you get big 

1475
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:50,130
muscles and intelligence and a 
knowledge,

1476
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:53,380
a deep knowledge of boxing.
You totally both things,

1477
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:55,690
but most of the time you don't.
Most of the time you don't,

1478
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,810
but when you did like when Mike Tyson 
was in its prime,

1479
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:02,410
it was so terrifying because there 
wasn't a guy like that before.

1480
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,020
Him is super fast.
Ridiculously powerful.

1481
01:06:05,021 --> 01:06:07,960
Guy Just came in with perfect technique,
bobbing and weaving,

1482
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,470
throwing bombs at you.
Ooo,

1483
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,840
yeah,
his side to side movement was just so 

1484
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:17,050
terrifying.
That little bear with fuck him up.

1485
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:20,770
Grab a hold of his dick from the ground.
Flip him over on his back.

1486
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,440
I don't know man.
You seen him with his tigers?

1487
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,270
Yeah,
he's crazy.

1488
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,760
Charlie Murphy had one of the funniest 
stories ever.

1489
01:06:27,761 --> 01:06:32,761
Told them this podcast we told about how
he pulled up to Mike Tyson's house with 

1490
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,020
a bunch of his friends and they're all 
in limos and nobody wanted to get out of

1491
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:38,120
the car because Mike Tyson was on the 
front lawn with a fucking lion.

1492
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,000
He's kept thinking line and he's.
He's got a lot of actual real life.

1493
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:46,540
Nobody wanted to get it out of the car.
Where was the tiger?

1494
01:06:46,541 --> 01:06:47,200
Was it a lion?

1495
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,630
One of those things,
but it's an animated thing.

1496
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,590
Oh,
he's got a tiger there.

1497
01:06:50,591 --> 01:06:55,591
He had a gang of cats.
How rich do you have to get before you 

1498
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:55,591
start clicking the zoo?
Animals,

1499
01:06:55,591 --> 01:06:57,460
but he was insane.
Wealthy living in Vegas,

1500
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,610
I mean at the test seems to be the thing
like you got lucky.

1501
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:05,740
You get a lot of fighters wind up 
getting very dangerous animals.

1502
01:07:05,741 --> 01:07:10,741
I was a.
That was a big thing with a lot of 

1503
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:10,741
fighters.
I was just wondering what did he do with

1504
01:07:10,741 --> 01:07:11,390
these things once he couldn't handle it 
and find it.

1505
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:13,150
Like who?
What kind of animals?

1506
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:16,210
A lot of boxers get a pit bulls.
That's real common.

1507
01:07:16,211 --> 01:07:20,380
A lot of uh,
kickboxers MMA fighters get bulls.

1508
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,970
Yeah.
Real comment.

1509
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,520
They just want to be around something 
that's as bad asses them.

1510
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,330
Sure.
You know,

1511
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,930
or makes them feel and insist they're 
safe.

1512
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,200
Yeah.
Well you'll be safe to other people that

1513
01:07:32,201 --> 01:07:35,050
you have to worry about if you have a 
pit bull most of the time you're safe.

1514
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:40,740
If it's your dog.
It's very rare that a pit bull attacks 

1515
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:40,740
it's owner.
It's very rare.

1516
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:45,470
They pleased they want to please people 
and it's not even normal for them to go 

1517
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:49,471
after people.
Usually the only times that those dogs 

1518
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:49,471
go after people's.
When they're abused or totally.

1519
01:07:49,471 --> 01:07:54,180
I totally believe you,
but I wouldn't let my kids know that's 

1520
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,730
the children is different because 
children are small and they think 

1521
01:07:56,730 --> 01:07:56,880
children are like in my life.
So I came around.

1522
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,590
I totally understand.
I totally understand.

1523
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:01,210
But you're saying part of everybody's 
life,

1524
01:08:01,211 --> 01:08:03,600
so it's like when you get a pit bull,
you're basically saying I'm,

1525
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,580
you know,
half the population can't be around me.

1526
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:08,980
You could say that,
but there are,

1527
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:14,210
you know,
the problem is it's not worth the risk 

1528
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,471
to make the exception,
but there are some people's dogs that 

1529
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:16,471
are amazing.
A Guy,

1530
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:16,471
I used

1531
01:08:16,471 --> 01:08:21,040
to have this pit bull named Lucy.
She was the sweetest dog ever to 

1532
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:21,960
everybody.
She's killed babies.

1533
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:24,380
It didn't match.
She loved everybody,

1534
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,030
but you know,
when people would see her,

1535
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:27,320
they'd be like,
is that a pit bull?

1536
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,660
And they'd freak out.
She was the nicest dog ever.

1537
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:33,050
But then you'll have other dogs that are
just not like that at all.

1538
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,010
You know,
they're dangerous.

1539
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:34,820
They're,
they're tricky.

1540
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,620
And you never know because they all look
the same.

1541
01:08:36,621 --> 01:08:41,621
Like you'd have to get the know the dog 
and you have to know the history of the 

1542
01:08:41,621 --> 01:08:43,480
dog and the dog's parent's history and 
you know,

1543
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:47,010
I have this dog that's a massive and 
he's a smaller massive.

1544
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:52,020
It's called a regency mastermind.
He is the sweetest dog I've ever had in 

1545
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:56,411
my life and the reason why is because 
the guy who raised them like he 

1546
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:56,411
wouldn't.

1547
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:56,960
He described it to me.
He's like,

1548
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:02,140
it's all about the parents and it's all 
about not letting parents that exhibit 

1549
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,800
any weird behavior breed.
He's like,

1550
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:06,110
if you're going to breed like a really 
nice dog,

1551
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:11,290
he just makes sure that the dogs are 
always friendly and only friendly dogs 

1552
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:11,850
breed and if they're not friendly,
don't allow them to breathe.

1553
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:12,650
I was like,
damn,

1554
01:09:12,651 --> 01:09:17,651
that's crazy.
He's got to completely organized that 

1555
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:17,651
way.
Like genetically,

1556
01:09:17,651 --> 01:09:22,210
no.
He makes sure that these dogs are never 

1557
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:23,750
any dog that growls at somebody.
Any dog that barks for no reason,

1558
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:25,610
they don't breed.
Those are the ones they put in the other

1559
01:09:25,611 --> 01:09:27,740
barn where they secretly breed and fix 
him.

1560
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:28,570
He just fit.
No,

1561
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:31,340
they're different dogs or daryl.
It's a large dog.

1562
01:09:32,330 --> 01:09:34,270
One of my friends,
his mom bread,

1563
01:09:34,271 --> 01:09:37,730
a bull mastiffs oh yeah.
So I was always freaked out.

1564
01:09:37,730 --> 01:09:42,730
Every time I went over they would like 
be in the yard playing with bowling 

1565
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:42,730
balls,
you know,

1566
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:43,220
and I'd be like,
I'm not getting out of the car.

1567
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:43,800
Yeah,
they,

1568
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:48,290
there are some enormous dogs.
They were originally made like they make

1569
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:50,750
them,
I think for some sort of guard dog.

1570
01:09:50,751 --> 01:09:55,751
Right.
That was the idea behind them to make 

1571
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:55,751
them as big as possible.
Like those English mastiffs.

1572
01:09:55,751 --> 01:09:57,470
So 200 pound dogs.
They're enormous.

1573
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

1574
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,460
I'll get those.
I like labs.

1575
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,700
I think labs are my favorite.
They're like the most predictable,

1576
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:06,170
you know,
they're predictable.

1577
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,500
Who's got a good month,
a good month or good man.

1578
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,240
Is there any downside to living in 
Nashville?

1579
01:10:15,241 --> 01:10:20,241
Like what is it?
Is it all good living down there or is 

1580
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:20,241
it,
you know,

1581
01:10:20,241 --> 01:10:24,821
there's,
there's been such an influx of people 

1582
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:24,821
that it's,
it's a bit congested now.

1583
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:26,330
It's sort of like Austin in that regard.

1584
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,850
Right.
Where it's,

1585
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:31,990
I guess that's the hotspot.
I've heard that if you're young and you 

1586
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:32,900
have aspirations and you want to live in
a cool place,

1587
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:38,830
it seems to take longer and longer each 
year to get across town ski guys keep 

1588
01:10:38,830 --> 01:10:40,880
talking about it,
telling people how awesome it is.

1589
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,550
You know,
you hear me talking about me.

1590
01:10:43,610 --> 01:10:45,500
I just did.
I worked there all the time.

1591
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:50,860
I do.
I used to do a Zany comedy club is down 

1592
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:50,860
there.
Should have been there a lot.

1593
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:55,660
I'm there next month.
I'm doing the Ryman is just played the 

1594
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:55,820
ryman.
Awesome.

1595
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:57,720
We had John Prine come out and sing with
us.

1596
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:02,800
Now.
Are you doing the arcs in conjunction 

1597
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:02,800
with the black keys?
Like how do you know?

1598
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,330
Just sort of pat and I sort of just 
finished,

1599
01:11:05,331 --> 01:11:09,170
uh,
like the term blue tour which ended like

1600
01:11:09,171 --> 01:11:14,171
four years straight of touring road.
So we're just kind of taking a little 

1601
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:14,171
break.
I'm doing this arc,

1602
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:14,171
the

1603
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:16,110
arc thing now.
And when you guys do things like this,

1604
01:11:16,111 --> 01:11:21,111
do you do things legally or do you just 
shake hands and say we're in a band and 

1605
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:21,330
do things legally?
Yeah,

1606
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:25,980
yeah,
I do with these guys.

1607
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:27,270
I love them.
They're my friends,

1608
01:11:27,271 --> 01:11:28,050
but they're,
you know,

1609
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:29,800
they're pros.
Yeah.

1610
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:30,720
You kind of have to.
Huh?

1611
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,740
They all have their own lawyers,
you know,

1612
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,800
because they have been ripped off,
you know,

1613
01:11:35,820 --> 01:11:38,940
they've been referred the past that 
happens to really good musicians.

1614
01:11:38,941 --> 01:11:40,800
And what an amazing relationship you 
could have though,

1615
01:11:40,801 --> 01:11:44,520
if you had a bunch of heavy duty 
musicians that went in on a handshake.

1616
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:47,890
We don't talk about money really ahead 
of time,

1617
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:52,891
you know,
they'll buy plane tickets and flying to 

1618
01:11:52,891 --> 01:11:54,921
Nashville and spend a week recording,
will never wants to talk about contrast 

1619
01:11:54,921 --> 01:11:57,711
or anything like that.
So it's all done at advanced on 

1620
01:11:57,711 --> 01:11:57,711
afterwards.

1621
01:11:57,711 --> 01:11:57,711
It's,
you know,

1622
01:11:57,711 --> 01:11:57,711
hey,
we finished the record.

1623
01:11:57,711 --> 01:11:58,410
Let's,
we'll work it out now.

1624
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:00,120
Right.
That's how it should be done.

1625
01:12:00,121 --> 01:12:05,121
Right?
Until you get screwed and then you're 

1626
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:05,121
like,
shit,

1627
01:12:05,121 --> 01:12:07,080
I should've done this ahead of time.
I don't know.

1628
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:12,590
I think that's how it should be done,
but at least there's a level of trust 

1629
01:12:12,590 --> 01:12:12,840
that you guys do the recording in 
advance.

1630
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:13,500
I mean,
that's a,

1631
01:12:13,501 --> 01:12:16,170
that's a high level of trust and then 
figure it out afterwards.

1632
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:21,240
That's a very high level of trust 
because what if you guys catch 

1633
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:21,240
lightening in a bottle when he bitched?
Gets greedy?

1634
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:22,550
Yeah.
Someone gets those.

1635
01:12:22,551 --> 01:12:24,060
Scrooge mcduck Ching,
Ching,

1636
01:12:24,061 --> 01:12:26,130
those dollar bills in his eyes and next 
thing you know.

1637
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,400
Have you guys ever had your songs ripped
off before?

1638
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:31,290
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

1639
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,360
What does that feel like?
I'm strange,

1640
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:37,800
you know,
I mean for,

1641
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,920
for pat and I was like,
we spent so many years just trying to 

1642
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,100
get noticed to like have people copying 
us.

1643
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:46,200
It was just so bizarre.
We had this,

1644
01:12:46,201 --> 01:12:47,610
we had this one case where,
um,

1645
01:12:47,870 --> 01:12:49,230
I mean it's happened multiple times 
does,

1646
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:54,740
but we had this one case where a,
some casino did an advertisement and the

1647
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:01,290
owner of the casino posted something on 
fit on like twitter or something like,

1648
01:13:01,410 --> 01:13:02,340
hey,
check it out.

1649
01:13:02,341 --> 01:13:07,341
We just,
we just ripped off this black keys song 

1650
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:07,341
for a new ad.
You guys like it.

1651
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:13,950
We just used that in the case and it was
insane.

1652
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:21,690
Did they just not know?
I don't think he knew how the Internet 

1653
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:21,690
works.
I don't know.

1654
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:26,080
I thought maybe he was.
Maybe he just thought posting to his 

1655
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:26,080
buddies.
That's hilarious.

1656
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,020
Was it like a native American casino 
where they thought they had different 

1657
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:31,070
laws?
I don't know because they know,

1658
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:36,080
man.
Do they have different laws when it 

1659
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:36,080
comes to that kind of stuff?
Uh,

1660
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,420
I don't know either.
I mean that was like the whole thing.

1661
01:13:38,421 --> 01:13:43,421
It's like the native American casinos 
they were allowed to have because he 

1662
01:13:43,421 --> 01:13:43,421
knows some places that you can never 
have casinos.

1663
01:13:43,421 --> 01:13:44,490
Right.
Because they had their own rules.

1664
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,750
That's where a lot of other early mma 
fights were done because it was illegal.

1665
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:52,680
It was illegal to have mma.
So it was illegal have mma competitions,

1666
01:13:52,681 --> 01:13:55,200
but it was legal to have them at the 
native American places.

1667
01:13:55,201 --> 01:13:58,200
So they must have different malls in 
some ways.

1668
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:58,890
Yeah.
Yeah.

1669
01:13:59,010 --> 01:14:00,660
That's how they have casinos.
Yeah.

1670
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:07,310
So what do you guys do and now you're 
just touring across the country with 

1671
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:07,310
this new music?
Yeah.

1672
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,480
They were just on tour playing some 
shows when you hear for Coachella.

1673
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,440
Yeah.
What is that experience like?

1674
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,260
You know,
it's,

1675
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:16,980
it's like most kind of festivals.
It's it,

1676
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:21,250
it can be fun if you're,
if you're into that type of thing.

1677
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:22,870
I guess.
I don't know.

1678
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:28,590
Well,
it seems like it's got to be good for 

1679
01:14:28,590 --> 01:14:31,270
like the young up and coming guys and 
gals to be included in these lineups and

1680
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:34,060
people to be able to experience maybe 
some bands.

1681
01:14:34,061 --> 01:14:34,810
I know for honey,
honey,

1682
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:39,811
it was a big deal to be able to 
experience some bands that maybe you 

1683
01:14:39,811 --> 01:14:40,120
weren't aware of before and say,
Oh,

1684
01:14:40,121 --> 01:14:40,950
let me.
Yeah.

1685
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:45,550
For me it's kind of weird like watching 
music in the sun.

1686
01:14:45,670 --> 01:14:47,770
It just feels weird to me.
And then.

1687
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:49,760
And you don't,
you don't get sound check,

1688
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:50,400
you know,
so you.

1689
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,980
So you kind of go up there blind and 
then all you know,

1690
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:56,800
and then you have a very short set.
Normally most bands played,

1691
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,680
you know,
a band is playing like the more theaters

1692
01:14:59,681 --> 01:15:00,850
on this plane,
like our half,

1693
01:15:00,851 --> 01:15:03,160
at least when you played a festival,
you have 45 minutes.

1694
01:15:03,161 --> 01:15:03,860
That's it,
you know.

1695
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,100
So it's like,
you know,

1696
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:11,101
it's a very,
it's a lot of effort to not be at your 

1697
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:12,230
best.
You know what I mean?

1698
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:14,090
Yeah.
It's sort of,

1699
01:15:14,091 --> 01:15:15,970
um,
that,

1700
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:20,980
that can be a little difficult,
but when you play a great festival and 

1701
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:21,530
you get a great crowd,
it can change your mind.

1702
01:15:21,531 --> 01:15:25,040
I guess we just played last week and it 
was awesome.

1703
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:27,050
We had a really nice crowd.
It was great.

1704
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:28,910
What is it like being there?
I mean,

1705
01:15:28,911 --> 01:15:30,650
how many people go to that God damn 
thing.

1706
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:32,450
It's got to be enormous now.
Yeah,

1707
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:34,330
I mean it's huge.
I mean,

1708
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:34,640
yeah,

1709
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:41,740
it,
it's become this whole big thing out 

1710
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:41,740
there too.
They do two weekends now.

1711
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:41,740
Yeah.
That one.

1712
01:15:41,790 --> 01:15:46,110
And then the weekend after that they do 
essentially the same thing.

1713
01:15:46,111 --> 01:15:47,880
But with country music,
what's it called?

1714
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:49,320
Stagecoach.
Stagecoach,

1715
01:15:49,321 --> 01:15:50,290
festival.
Ge.

1716
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:52,020
So it was like three week.
The whole town,

1717
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:56,340
like is,
is for three weeks at least,

1718
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,350
is just completely inundated with 
people.

1719
01:15:58,890 --> 01:16:01,350
How strange and how do they choose that 
spot?

1720
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:02,820
Uh,
I don't know.

1721
01:16:02,821 --> 01:16:06,900
They do it on the polo grounds there.
Do they use those polo grounds when it's

1722
01:16:06,901 --> 01:16:08,450
not in season?
Yeah.

1723
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,590
I don't even know.
I don't know.

1724
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:12,270
They just decided to put it on down 
there,

1725
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:14,700
but it's become this gigantic thing that
everybody has to go.

1726
01:16:14,701 --> 01:16:19,701
A lot of guys who do those festivals 
will be the same ones who do festivals 

1727
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:19,701
all over the place,
you know,

1728
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:19,860
they'll,
they'll,

1729
01:16:20,370 --> 01:16:25,370
you know,
like those Lollapalooza guys to 

1730
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:25,370
different festivals.

1731
01:16:25,370 --> 01:16:26,880
They've started different ones.
And the benefit of doing those things is

1732
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:29,100
really essentially just first exposure.
Right.

1733
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:30,900
I mean,
there's money in it,

1734
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,220
but it's not like you guys doing on your
own.

1735
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:34,530
It's good.
Money is good.

1736
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:35,580
Money.
It's better money than,

1737
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,900
than playing shows.
You get more money.

1738
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,660
Really?
Yeah.

1739
01:16:37,670 --> 01:16:38,790
Yeah.
Wow.

1740
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:44,360
It's good money.
So it's nice to route a tour around 

1741
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:44,360
festivals.
No Shit.

1742
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:44,360
Yeah.
Wow.

1743
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:46,800
That's interesting,
Huh?

1744
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:51,520
Because comedians always think of it as 
like south by southwest has,

1745
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:54,270
is when you think about festivals 
festival and what is that?

1746
01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:58,300
That's a more an industry thing and 
it's,

1747
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,030
it's everybody's kind of playing for 
free.

1748
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:01,890
Yeah.
What the fuck is ours?

1749
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:05,820
That's really weird when you're starting
that,

1750
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:07,530
you know,
it's a place to be seen.

1751
01:17:08,610 --> 01:17:10,640
Yeah.
It's more for up and comers I think,

1752
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,560
or when you have a brand new record 
coming out,

1753
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,170
you can go down there and you know that 
all the media is going to be there.

1754
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:18,410
Is Coachella the big festival?
I think so,

1755
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:20,000
yeah.
Coachella is one of the biggest.

1756
01:17:20,370 --> 01:17:22,430
Lollapalooza is the other.
Yeah,

1757
01:17:22,431 --> 01:17:23,070
there.
There.

1758
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:25,400
There are a few that are our mainstays 
now.

1759
01:17:25,490 --> 01:17:26,480
Coachella is definitely one of them.

1760
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:32,200
Do you find that in the age of the 
Internet that you are getting better 

1761
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:35,921
crowds in different places,
that you're getting people that 

1762
01:17:35,921 --> 01:17:37,960
understand what you're doing and are big
fans and they're.

1763
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,510
They're all over the place now instead 
of like in an urban pockets.

1764
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:48,070
I don't know.
We don't go outside of urban pockets 

1765
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,070
really be honest.
Really.

1766
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,350
I mean we stay in major cities.
We don't.

1767
01:17:48,351 --> 01:17:53,351
We don't often hit the small towns.
No,

1768
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:57,830
because we can hit major markets in 
Australia,

1769
01:17:57,860 --> 01:18:00,050
western Europe,
North America.

1770
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:05,051
We can do it in South America and then 
like by the time we finished that you 

1771
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:09,960
can kind of do those again.
It's like a.

1772
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:13,760
You really have to want to go there and 
make a lot less money.

1773
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,360
I get it.
Makes Sense.

1774
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:17,970
Yeah.

1775
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:20,510
Why would you think that maybe that 
would,

1776
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:25,750
especially for fucking around and 
creating new stuff sometimes getting a 

1777
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:26,140
new look,
you know,

1778
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:28,880
and then being in a new place and 
performing for a new counterpart,

1779
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,590
it gives you a new feel for what you're 
doing.

1780
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:32,920
Yeah,
I mean I think if,

1781
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:37,980
if you're,
if you're that kind of band that does a 

1782
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,070
lot of improvising and fly by the seat 
of your pants,

1783
01:18:39,071 --> 01:18:41,200
but for me,
I'd rather be creating in the studio.

1784
01:18:41,610 --> 01:18:44,520
Do you enjoy travel?
Do you enjoy like international gigs?

1785
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,420
Uh,
less and less.

1786
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:49,460
Yeah.
Less and less.

1787
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,240
The more,
the more productive I am at home,

1788
01:18:53,241 --> 01:18:55,160
the less I want to leave,
you know?

1789
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,710
And I love being around my kids.
It's been a lot of fun.

1790
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,240
So it's definitely become less and less 
a thing I want to do.

1791
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:03,850
I got to tell you,
dude,

1792
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:07,630
you're your dedication and the way you 
described wanting to do music,

1793
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:10,750
it's very infectious.
I love hearing shit like this because it

1794
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,550
really does make me want to go do 
something,

1795
01:19:12,910 --> 01:19:17,910
you know?
I think that that effect is one of the 

1796
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:21,481
reasons why people really enjoy 
conversations with people like you 

1797
01:19:21,481 --> 01:19:23,770
because when we're remodeling done,
I've never done this really.

1798
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,240
I've never really done an interview like
this.

1799
01:19:25,540 --> 01:19:26,500
No Shit.
Never.

1800
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,710
He's so comfortable though.
Hi.

1801
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,870
So comfortable.
I don't know.

1802
01:19:30,910 --> 01:19:32,740
I guess just,
I just feel comfortable around you.

1803
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,020
You definitely say I feel like you're 
going to keep me safe.

1804
01:19:37,021 --> 01:19:39,780
I 100 percent of my stock here with the 
map things.

1805
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:42,370
Barges didn't the door.
Everything's fine.

1806
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:47,580
You're going to be fine,
but it's like when a person hears 

1807
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:51,870
someone like you that is just in love 
with what they do and produces amazing 

1808
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:53,020
stuff and just has a passionate about 
it,

1809
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,020
it makes it.
There's like a bubbly thing.

1810
01:19:56,110 --> 01:19:57,940
It starts boiling inside it.
You want to,

1811
01:19:57,950 --> 01:19:59,410
you want to get going.
You want to get moving,

1812
01:19:59,411 --> 01:20:02,170
man.
That is the fuel of inspiration.

1813
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,330
It's so important for people.
I mean,

1814
01:20:04,331 --> 01:20:06,440
I think for all of us,
um,

1815
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:11,520
I think everybody who was in the certain
artists growing up knows that music 

1816
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:17,780
especially,
I think it's probably one of the most 

1817
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:17,780
inspirational things as far as like the 
way it hits you,

1818
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:19,740
the way emotionally way it hits you.

1819
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:24,740
Like as far as art forms.
You can listen to a three minute song 

1820
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:28,160
and it can hit you in a way that three 
minutes in a movie has no hope of like 

1821
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,781
in,
like from start to go to three first 

1822
01:20:31,781 --> 01:20:32,580
minutes of a movie never hit you like 
some songs do.

1823
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:37,760
They just tell a story and this intense 
moving way with music and sound and,

1824
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:43,890
and the,
the soul behind the way a person sings 

1825
01:20:43,890 --> 01:20:46,230
the words and that to hear from a guy 
like you,

1826
01:20:46,231 --> 01:20:51,231
that that process is so intoxicating and
you love it so much and that you still 

1827
01:20:51,231 --> 01:20:55,820
after all these years do it and love it 
and can't wait to get back in there and 

1828
01:20:55,820 --> 01:20:59,151
you want to be productive and that you 
work all the time and that you work at 

1829
01:20:59,151 --> 01:20:59,151
it.
You don't even consider it.

1830
01:20:59,151 --> 01:21:00,520
That's like,
that's what everybody wants to hear,

1831
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:05,560
man,
because that when you hear a guy like 

1832
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:05,590
you talk about that,
I guarantee you this,

1833
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:10,610
this podcast to be heard by over a 
million people and out of those million 

1834
01:21:10,610 --> 01:21:11,550
people,
thousands of them are going to start new

1835
01:21:11,551 --> 01:21:15,090
projects and get inspired to do things 
just by hearing you do this.

1836
01:21:15,220 --> 01:21:16,830
I think it's going to fuck him,
man.

1837
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:22,010
They gonna want some of that man.
So people what they hear that and they 

1838
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:22,200
go,
that sounds like bliss.

1839
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:27,350
That sounds like career bliss.
Someone who loves what they do and for 

1840
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,350
two years

1841
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:29,220
the business side is hard.
There's a lot of bullshit.

1842
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,990
You know what I mean?
And most people don't make it.

1843
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:35,040
You know,
we started over 10 years ago and we used

1844
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:37,290
to tour with a bunch of bands that just 
don't even exist anymore.

1845
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:38,640
You know what I mean?
We've,

1846
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,980
we know that we're lucky,
you know what I mean?

1847
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:45,981
But at the same time,
I've always felt something more from 

1848
01:21:47,061 --> 01:21:48,000
music.
You know,

1849
01:21:48,001 --> 01:21:53,001
it's always meant more to me than it did
to all my friends just because I don't 

1850
01:21:53,001 --> 01:21:53,430
know why,
you know,

1851
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:56,250
it's like part of my family,
but even still,

1852
01:21:57,230 --> 01:21:58,920
you know,
my dad had a great record collection but

1853
01:21:58,921 --> 01:22:03,000
I am pretty quickly like surpassed his 
knowledge and just delve deeper,

1854
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:08,090
you know what I mean?
But I always felt really in tune with 

1855
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:08,090
music.
Like I,

1856
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,920
I can remember being like 14 and hearing
Sam Cooke and the soul stirrers and like

1857
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:15,270
it making me cry,
you know what I mean?

1858
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:18,660
It was able to reach some place inside 
me that,

1859
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,660
that nothing else ever was able to,
you know,

1860
01:22:22,710 --> 01:22:26,250
I don't know that everybody gets that 
thing right.

1861
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:30,390
But I definitely have that and it's like
it's really controlled the way that I've

1862
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,860
made all the decisions for my life.

1863
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:34,490
Well,
I've got to think as a young man in such

1864
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:39,491
a music rich environment that you 
described your childhood growing up like

1865
01:22:39,711 --> 01:22:44,711
that.
I mean that had to have sparked and 

1866
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:46,811
fueled some,
some areas of your creativity that just 

1867
01:22:46,811 --> 01:22:49,250
led you to embrace it the way you have.
I mean,

1868
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:50,180
it's,
I mean,

1869
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:53,600
it seems like a really fortunate 
situation that you grew up in.

1870
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:55,220
Yeah,
absolutely.

1871
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:59,540
With that story of you guys around your 
grandmother's grave singing that song,

1872
01:22:59,710 --> 01:23:02,120
that's an amazing story matter.
Yeah.

1873
01:23:02,150 --> 01:23:04,070
I kind of wish I had that in my family,
you know?

1874
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:06,010
Yeah.
I mean,

1875
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,940
and I,
and I know it,

1876
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:08,860
I know it,
you know,

1877
01:23:08,861 --> 01:23:12,880
and not only were my uncle's a great 
musicians,

1878
01:23:13,300 --> 01:23:15,460
but they think great tastes like 
Michael.

1879
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:20,470
Jim taught me how to sing.
He's still got one of the best voices 

1880
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:20,470
I've ever heard in my life,
you know what I mean?

1881
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:22,450
And uh,
you know,

1882
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:24,280
I was uh,
I was in a blues music,

1883
01:23:24,281 --> 01:23:29,281
but I was a real snob about it.
I liked certain things and I really 

1884
01:23:29,281 --> 01:23:29,281
didn't like other things,
you know what I mean?

1885
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:34,650
And I had my uncle Tim,
he just had an amazing blues albums and 

1886
01:23:34,661 --> 01:23:37,150
he hit me to the cool shit,
you know what I mean early on.

1887
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:42,720
And I knew the difference between like a
Kinda corny barb blue shit and like the 

1888
01:23:42,941 --> 01:23:43,960
deep stuff,
you know?

1889
01:23:44,020 --> 01:23:46,750
And so I really had a headstart.
I can't,

1890
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:49,180
I can't say that it was assault,
like I just got it,

1891
01:23:49,181 --> 01:23:49,840
you know,
I like,

1892
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:52,300
I had great teachers and I was around 
some,

1893
01:23:52,390 --> 01:23:53,590
some cool stuff growing up.

1894
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:55,480
Yeah,
that's what it seems like,

1895
01:23:55,690 --> 01:24:00,690
you know,
and I think that have it being around a 

1896
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:01,210
bunch of people that are not,
are not just have great taste,

1897
01:24:01,211 --> 01:24:06,000
but also express themselves like freely 
and openly like that they can sing at a,

1898
01:24:06,001 --> 01:24:07,300
at a funeral.
No,

1899
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:10,780
that's not a lot of families where there
is so musical that they'll,

1900
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:15,810
they'll sit around and sing your 
grandmother's favorite song when she 

1901
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:15,810
died.
Well,

1902
01:24:15,810 --> 01:24:16,210
yeah,
I mean it,

1903
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,340
it became,
it,

1904
01:24:17,370 --> 01:24:17,910
it,
it,

1905
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:21,610
it ceased to be music.
For me it was just who I was.

1906
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:24,730
It was,
it was my life as a human is music.

1907
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:28,480
It's just,
it's like eating music,

1908
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,090
showering.
I mean it's like a part of thing.

1909
01:24:31,091 --> 01:24:32,980
I do.
You know what I mean?

1910
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,560
And without thinking about it and no 
matter what you did,

1911
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:37,060
even if you didn't pursue it as a 
career,

1912
01:24:37,061 --> 01:24:39,880
you would still be involved in theater,
but you can.

1913
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,700
I think so,
yeah.

1914
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,320
I don't.
I wouldn't know,

1915
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:48,040
I don't really.
I knew that I felt totally out of place,

1916
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,490
like working in a kitchen and like 
working anywhere else.

1917
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:54,420
Is that a boxing glove or on your neck?
Yeah.

1918
01:24:54,610 --> 01:24:56,280
What's that from?
That's,

1919
01:24:56,390 --> 01:25:01,390
you know,
they used to give these out to golden 

1920
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:01,390
glove winters.
Local regional golden glove.

1921
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:02,020
What did you win?
A golden gloves.

1922
01:25:02,110 --> 01:25:04,030
None and I,
I found it in a junk shop.

1923
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:10,970
It does look cool.
I like how you're rocking it underneath 

1924
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:12,640
the collar.
Old School style.

1925
01:25:13,330 --> 01:25:18,330
Catholic school.
Like an Italian horn I suppose where I 

1926
01:25:18,330 --> 01:25:20,720
can remember Italian horns.
No.

1927
01:25:20,770 --> 01:25:24,580
People used to wear those stupid little 
gold horns like a horn,

1928
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:25,840
like a,
like a bull horn.

1929
01:25:25,841 --> 01:25:26,660
That was like,
Hey,

1930
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,110
do you know what I'm talking about?
Not at all.

1931
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:31,750
It's this thing.
They would call them Italian horns.

1932
01:25:31,751 --> 01:25:33,790
There were a big east coast.
Guido,

1933
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,260
where'd you grow?
That's what they look like.

1934
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:40,310
A,
I was born in New Jersey and I grew up 

1935
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:40,310
in Boston.
That kind of looks like sperm.

1936
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:42,520
Stupid charm.
It does the greatest farm.

1937
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:44,770
That's probably what it really is.
Gold sperm.

1938
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:47,080
There you fuck with the bull?
You get the horns.

1939
01:25:47,081 --> 01:25:49,420
I don't,
I don't know why it was a horn.

1940
01:25:49,450 --> 01:25:53,070
I have no idea what it meant,
but when I was explaining you have sperm

1941
01:25:53,071 --> 01:25:55,600
in your chest,
like sperm,

1942
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,460
like liberace came in your chest.

1943
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:04,010
I don't know why I brought that up.
I don't even know where they came from.

1944
01:26:04,011 --> 01:26:06,230
I was just curious about.
I just wanted to know if you boxed.

1945
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:07,410
Yeah,
yeah.

1946
01:26:07,430 --> 01:26:09,590
Blocks do you.
What do you do?

1947
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,960
Do you do it for like just for fun?
For Fun?

1948
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:13,160
For,
for working out.

1949
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:17,120
Do you spar or do you hit a little bit.
When my cousins in town,

1950
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:20,030
he taught me how to box.
He has been boxing since he was 14.

1951
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,670
He got me into it three or four years 
ago.

1952
01:26:23,300 --> 01:26:24,980
I have some friends who still spar and 
I'm like,

1953
01:26:24,981 --> 01:26:26,690
dude,
be careful.

1954
01:26:26,930 --> 01:26:27,800
Yeah.
Yeah.

1955
01:26:27,801 --> 01:26:29,960
Even though you had those things,
the big helmets on it,

1956
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:32,030
shit hurts.
Those helmets don't really help.

1957
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:33,560
You know the,
the,

1958
01:26:33,570 --> 01:26:37,490
the problem is the brain smushing around
inside the head and those helmets.

1959
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,920
Nobody's hitting me like that.
No,

1960
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,210
no,
but just a little jolt.

1961
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:45,500
Even jolts like that real bad for the 
brain sloshing around inside the head.

1962
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:47,420
Yeah,
absolutely.

1963
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:52,870
I was talking to a doctor.
He said that jet skiing can give you 

1964
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,870
brain damage.
Jet Skiing,

1965
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:54,950
jet skiing,
just being on a jet ski.

1966
01:26:54,951 --> 01:26:57,430
He said the bounce of a jet ski,
no bullshit.

1967
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,750
Gives people concussions.
Wow.

1968
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,350
Yeah.
He goes,

1969
01:27:00,351 --> 01:27:03,260
you don't realize what a concussion is 
is you're concussed.

1970
01:27:03,261 --> 01:27:05,090
Like the impact doesn't have to hit you 
in the head.

1971
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:09,110
You get a lot of concussions have from 
people getting hit in the chest and then

1972
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,780
all of a sudden there'll be depressed 
and their mood swings be.

1973
01:27:11,781 --> 01:27:15,410
Their cortisol levels are all fucked up.
They'll find out that there's from the,

1974
01:27:15,490 --> 01:27:18,260
from the sort of like whiplash from the 
movement of the impact.

1975
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:19,790
Yeah,
I always heard that.

1976
01:27:20,090 --> 01:27:22,310
Yeah.
That's what I am and I know it's true in

1977
01:27:22,311 --> 01:27:23,870
boxing gloves.

1978
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:25,970
I know they cause more brain damage than
the small gloves.

1979
01:27:26,330 --> 01:27:30,470
I know MMA is technically safer than 
boxing is in the longterm.

1980
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,280
Yeah.
Believe it or not,

1981
01:27:31,281 --> 01:27:33,140
I'd actually be safer if they weren't.
No gloves.

1982
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,030
Yeah,
absolutely.

1983
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:36,350
No gloves,
no risk tape.

1984
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:37,060
You,
your,

1985
01:27:37,061 --> 01:27:42,061
your wrist would band easier,
it'd be harder to hit people hard and 

1986
01:27:42,061 --> 01:27:42,590
also your hands would break because he'd
have to pick your shots better.

1987
01:27:42,650 --> 01:27:45,110
Absolutely.
Safety,

1988
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:46,460
safety first.
Safety first.

1989
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:50,240
Even in extreme sports.
Well that's the thing,

1990
01:27:50,241 --> 01:27:55,241
right?
Like how safe can you make it while 

1991
01:27:55,241 --> 01:27:55,241
still have it be so exciting?
I don't know.

1992
01:27:55,241 --> 01:27:55,940
Right.
Do you watch boxing now though?

1993
01:27:55,941 --> 01:27:56,690
You follow?
Yeah.

1994
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:58,400
You're a big boxing fan.
Oh yeah.

1995
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:01,490
Chocolate Tito's does in this Santa 
Monica right now.

1996
01:28:01,491 --> 01:28:02,840
Training.
Have you watched him?

1997
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,000
Uh,
I mean I'm a big fan of his.

1998
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:10,001
I've never seen him live,
but I want to go there and watch them 

1999
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:10,001
train.
Yeah,

2000
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:10,001
man,
I watched Manny Pacquiao.

2001
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:11,210
Train was,
it was a real pleasure.

2002
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:16,720
It was um,
I went and trained at wildcard and they 

2003
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:16,720
let me go down and train in the room.
The manny room.

2004
01:28:16,790 --> 01:28:17,570
Oh yeah.
And you know,

2005
01:28:17,571 --> 01:28:20,660
the double end bag was like so fucking 
tight.

2006
01:28:20,720 --> 01:28:22,920
Yeah.
I could barely hit the thing.

2007
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:26,470
I felt so stupid because I was like,
alright,

2008
01:28:26,540 --> 01:28:31,540
I'm at a place where I feel comfortable.
I can go to wildcard and maybe work out 

2009
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:32,390
and not feel like a total shit had and I
was like,

2010
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,770
I gotta get Outta here.

2011
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:37,880
I was like,
give me a couple of wildcard t shirts.

2012
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:41,390
You never see me again.
Watching manny hit the pads.

2013
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:44,480
A man who was hitting the pads wasn't 
with him.

2014
01:28:44,550 --> 01:28:46,620
Was it with Freddie Roach?
It might've been with Freddy.

2015
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:47,430
Yeah,
it was with Freddy,

2016
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:49,330
Freddy and another guy.
Um,

2017
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:52,920
and he goes through all this warm up 
routines and goes through all this stuff

2018
01:28:52,921 --> 01:28:57,921
and then he starts hitting the pads 
kinda slow and loosens up and then 

2019
01:28:57,921 --> 01:28:59,300
eventually he starts firing off these 
combinations.

2020
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,120
My mom

2021
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:07,430
and he's just firing off these ungodly 
quick combinations and you just realize 

2022
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:08,370
like,
yeah,

2023
01:29:08,371 --> 01:29:10,740
there's a difference.
There's a difference in certain people.

2024
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,310
Yeah.
There's a big difference.

2025
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:13,580
See Calves?
Yeah.

2026
01:29:13,581 --> 01:29:14,160
Yeah.
Yeah.

2027
01:29:14,161 --> 01:29:16,290
You said what the hell is going on over 
there?

2028
01:29:16,350 --> 01:29:17,490
Well,
that's where his power comes from.

2029
01:29:17,491 --> 01:29:18,840
Ms Dot Perez,
all from his legs.

2030
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:24,050
The pushing off of the legs and 
delivering these lightening fast 

2031
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:24,050
combinations.
Yeah.

2032
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:25,910
Did you see his last fight was an 
absolute bust?

2033
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,390
They lost money.
Yeah,

2034
01:29:27,391 --> 01:29:32,391
nobody wants to see him fight if it's 
not floyd mayweather and people were 

2035
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:32,391
really disappointed to.
Well,

2036
01:29:32,391 --> 01:29:33,240
that's not totally true.
I mean,

2037
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:36,150
he just fought Tim Bradley.
We've this just like third fight.

2038
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:39,090
I don't think anybody really cared to.
Bradley's a fun guy.

2039
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,580
Tim Bradley's awesome.
It's this third fight.

2040
01:29:41,581 --> 01:29:42,150
Let's.
Let's.

2041
01:29:42,300 --> 01:29:44,430
But it was interesting to have great 
welterweights out there.

2042
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:47,790
I agree.
Terence Crawford the best.

2043
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:48,720
Yeah,
he's awesome.

2044
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:49,680
I want,
I don't want to see that.

2045
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,330
He just,
he's,

2046
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,520
he's just inked a deal with the fight.
Victor postle.

2047
01:29:53,730 --> 01:29:55,730
Oh really?
It's going to be a great fight too.

2048
01:29:55,810 --> 01:29:57,790
I think a terrence was going to win it,
but that's a.

2049
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:02,930
that's a really good fight and I'd love 
to see the terrence Crawford isn't 

2050
01:30:02,930 --> 01:30:05,481
scared to,
to fight anybody that even the best 

2051
01:30:05,481 --> 01:30:05,820
terrence is something special and also 
that he,

2052
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:10,080
he fights from the Orthodox stance but 
just as good if not better for the south

2053
01:30:10,081 --> 01:30:12,660
southpaw and they'll switch up on guys.
He'll like,

2054
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:14,730
I hate when I see guys do that.
I'm like,

2055
01:30:14,731 --> 01:30:15,630
oh,
this fucking guy.

2056
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:18,840
But he's awesome.
It's almost like he's feeling you out as

2057
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:21,000
an Orthodox and then when he knows he 
can fuck you up,

2058
01:30:21,001 --> 01:30:22,770
he switches over and start to lighten 
you up.

2059
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,390
[inaudible] he's something special.

2060
01:30:24,420 --> 01:30:27,000
He's awesome and I love to watch.
Is his brain work to cause?

2061
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,330
He does.
He.

2062
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,300
He won't just go out for the knockout or
whatever.

2063
01:30:30,301 --> 01:30:31,380
He's.
He plays with.

2064
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:33,480
He plays with it for a few rounds while 
smart.

2065
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:34,730
Gently.
Yes.

2066
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,800
He always plays with the person for a 
few rounds and then starts destroying 

2067
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:39,800
them.
Well,

2068
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:44,070
I think he values and appreciates the 
skill and art of boxing,

2069
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:49,071
the actual art of it.
I mean there's no way he can be as good 

2070
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:49,071
as he is.
If you get to that level,

2071
01:30:49,071 --> 01:30:52,251
you have to.
You have to reach that point where you 

2072
01:30:52,251 --> 01:30:52,260
understand that it's a total art to it.
Yeah.

2073
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:57,261
So what he's doing is he's setting traps
and slowly dragging guys into his game 

2074
01:30:57,261 --> 01:30:57,820
and then fucking them up.
Yeah.

2075
01:30:57,830 --> 01:31:00,330
And for a guy who really appreciates 
that,

2076
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:03,150
the skill and the subtleties of,
of what he's doing,

2077
01:31:03,151 --> 01:31:03,750
it's amazing.

2078
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,760
Absolutely.
I love watching that guy said traps 

2079
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:08,760
chocolates.
He does.

2080
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:12,171
Awesome too,
because he's just watching his side to 

2081
01:31:12,171 --> 01:31:12,171
side movement while.
Yeah,

2082
01:31:12,171 --> 01:31:15,000
watching.
It's just like second nature for him.

2083
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,220
Yeah.
More more so than anybody.

2084
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:22,320
[inaudible] he's just a boxer.
Know the fluidity of those combinations 

2085
01:31:22,321 --> 01:31:27,321
would step off to the left and crank off
these Lopez in that way where it's just 

2086
01:31:27,931 --> 01:31:32,580
like perfect form and the movement is 
insane.

2087
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:34,410
This is a good time for boxing right 
now.

2088
01:31:34,470 --> 01:31:39,470
Gennady Golovkin and another one.
I want to see what happens with Canelo 

2089
01:31:39,470 --> 01:31:42,690
Alvarez and I'm gon Ca Amir Khan,
which is coming up.

2090
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,890
I worry about con,
you know,

2091
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:48,891
we're talking about muscles and con 
keeps saying I feel stronger and he 

2092
01:31:48,891 --> 01:31:48,891
looks huge.
It looks ripped.

2093
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,720
I worry that he just will have no 
stamina in the fight.

2094
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:52,950
Yeah.
I wonder,

2095
01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:54,390
um,
is this the first time,

2096
01:31:54,540 --> 01:31:57,770
what are they finding at one 60,
1:54

2097
01:31:57,771 --> 01:31:58,170
member.

2098
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:02,290
So when mayweather and him fought,
they fought at 1:50.

2099
01:32:02,291 --> 01:32:03,570
Was it a catch weight fight?
Yeah,

2100
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:04,530
I think so.
Yeah.

2101
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:06,520
You want me whether I wanted them a 
little small,

2102
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:11,580
right.
Maybe with they get you ever drank them 

2103
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:11,980
down a little bit.
Get that big bruiser down,

2104
01:32:12,190 --> 01:32:16,540
but a Gennady Golovkin is a,
he's an interesting guy because a lot of

2105
01:32:16,541 --> 01:32:20,320
people don't want to,
like his paper view got 150,000

2106
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:21,610
buys,
which is a huge bust.

2107
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:26,611
It's a disaster for them.
But for boxing fans like you or me or 

2108
01:32:26,611 --> 01:32:27,250
like best,
he's the guy to walk.

2109
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:30,310
Can't wait to watch it.
We still haven't seen him tested though.

2110
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:31,810
I don't think.
I don't think so either.

2111
01:32:31,870 --> 01:32:33,850
But he's going to fight,
you know,

2112
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,620
everybody wants to see him fight.
Wade.

2113
01:32:36,720 --> 01:32:40,300
I mean,
I'm Canelo for sure,

2114
01:32:40,770 --> 01:32:42,180
but it's fighting.
Who is he?

2115
01:32:42,280 --> 01:32:43,510
Uh,
yeah.

2116
01:32:43,630 --> 01:32:45,190
It's Wade.
Wade is the guy's name.

2117
01:32:45,220 --> 01:32:47,230
The mandatory challenge.
Always fighting weight right now.

2118
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:48,940
But Andre Ward.
Oh,

2119
01:32:49,990 --> 01:32:51,910
it's going to go up and fight Cova love 
though.

2120
01:32:52,570 --> 01:32:55,150
You know that Andrea was now fighting 
75.

2121
01:32:55,151 --> 01:32:57,220
He had his first light heavyweight fight
at 75.

2122
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,170
Look Great.
And now he's going to fight Koval.

2123
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:00,450
Koval lives a beast.
Oh,

2124
01:33:00,460 --> 01:33:02,070
he's another terrifying guy.
Yeah,

2125
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:04,600
it's a great time.
Bernard Hopkins,

2126
01:33:04,601 --> 01:33:05,320
uh,
you know,

2127
01:33:06,040 --> 01:33:08,860
as old as he is and kind of as slowly as
he is with respect.

2128
01:33:09,220 --> 01:33:11,440
He popped a few times.
He did.

2129
01:33:11,530 --> 01:33:13,690
I mean,
it was the Bernard Hopkins have 10 years

2130
01:33:13,691 --> 01:33:14,920
ago.
It could have been completely different.

2131
01:33:14,921 --> 01:33:15,330
Fun.
Yeah,

2132
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:16,760
that's what I'm saying.
Like I think if,

2133
01:33:16,761 --> 01:33:18,320
uh,
again it's,

2134
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:23,520
it's,
that's the other thing about boxing is 

2135
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:25,450
like with the thing that's so great 
about mma is they pick the best against 

2136
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:27,400
the best.
And in boxing there's so much bullshit.

2137
01:33:28,090 --> 01:33:29,920
You know,
you got to see these dumb fucking fights

2138
01:33:29,921 --> 01:33:31,900
with guys fighting people that,
you know,

2139
01:33:31,901 --> 01:33:33,940
they can just be so easily.

2140
01:33:33,940 --> 01:33:35,740
Definitely too many different world 
titles.

2141
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:38,100
Like you have three different guys are 
called themselves the world champion and

2142
01:33:38,101 --> 01:33:39,850
they're in the same weight class.
That's crazy.

2143
01:33:40,330 --> 01:33:41,800
You know,
there's a lot of that.

2144
01:33:41,801 --> 01:33:42,940
That doesn't make any sense.
Like,

2145
01:33:42,970 --> 01:33:47,970
yeah,
deciding what a world champion is and 

2146
01:33:47,970 --> 01:33:50,140
who owns the right to say world champion
that their guy is or this guy is and not

2147
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:52,900
have them fight against each other.
Rival promotions.

2148
01:33:52,930 --> 01:33:57,930
They don't want to get together and make
deals that don't wanna lose our 

2149
01:33:57,930 --> 01:33:57,930
superstar.
What if,

2150
01:33:57,930 --> 01:34:02,610
what if the USC had a company that was 
just as big as USC because that's kind 

2151
01:34:02,610 --> 01:34:03,340
of essentially what happens in boxing,
you know what I mean?

2152
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:08,370
You don't,
you don't talk about it and use it 

2153
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:08,370
because there's no one else really can 
compete,

2154
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:08,370
you know,
if you want to do mma,

2155
01:34:08,370 --> 01:34:08,770
you do them.
You guys see,

2156
01:34:08,771 --> 01:34:09,130
right.

2157
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,320
You know,
Bell Torch is not quite as big,

2158
01:34:11,321 --> 01:34:14,710
but like with boxing,
there are just all these promoters,

2159
01:34:15,190 --> 01:34:19,960
top ranking and Aram and that they never
crossed promote.

2160
01:34:20,020 --> 01:34:20,880
You know what I mean?
It's just,

2161
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:25,960
it,
it really does a disservice to the 

2162
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:25,960
sport.
I think.

2163
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:28,590
Oh,
it certainly can because they know that 

2164
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:30,331
they,
they have a guy who can make a lot of 

2165
01:34:30,331 --> 01:34:32,191
money and if that guy loses to somebody,
then they're fucked and they lose their 

2166
01:34:32,191 --> 01:34:35,341
big guy.
And that's the other thing I kind of 

2167
01:34:35,341 --> 01:34:35,341
hate about boxing is that if you lose 
one fight,

2168
01:34:35,341 --> 01:34:38,230
somehow you're tainted beyond belief.
Do you know what I mean?

2169
01:34:38,231 --> 01:34:40,300
I don't quite understand that.
Yeah.

2170
01:34:40,570 --> 01:34:45,570
Well,
it's an old school way of thinking 

2171
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:45,610
because they used to build a fighter up 
and get them 49 and oh,

2172
01:34:45,611 --> 01:34:46,820
and then they would fight,
you know?

2173
01:34:47,070 --> 01:34:49,510
Right.
And it would be a big thing.

2174
01:34:49,510 --> 01:34:51,880
He's undefeated.
He's going for the title.

2175
01:34:51,910 --> 01:34:56,910
You know,
if a guy had 10 losses and he was gone 

2176
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:56,910
for the title,
everybody will like,

2177
01:34:56,910 --> 01:34:59,450
why am I even watching this?
That's why it's so cool to see con fight

2178
01:34:59,451 --> 01:35:01,100
Canelo and to see,
uh,

2179
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:06,850
you know,
to see who did we just say Miguel cotto 

2180
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:07,630
who's another post dol laws?
Zoning.

2181
01:35:07,650 --> 01:35:08,300
Postal.
Oh,

2182
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:10,530
Gennady Golovkin.
No postal.

2183
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:15,880
Terrence Crawford is calling me.
It's so great when you actually see a 

2184
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:15,880
real fight.
It's like,

2185
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:15,880
Oh shit,
this is awesome.

2186
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:16,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

2187
01:35:16,341 --> 01:35:21,341
Well,
there's just too much talent right now 

2188
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:21,341
in a few divisions.
Like it's,

2189
01:35:21,341 --> 01:35:25,211
there's some unavoidable like chaotic 
matchups and I think Canelo and Amir 

2190
01:35:25,211 --> 01:35:26,810
Khan for as long as it lasts,
she'd be very interesting.

2191
01:35:27,130 --> 01:35:30,890
Canal is just such a bruiser man.
He's a scary puncher,

2192
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:36,580
but he's slow.
He's a little slow and pretty fast when 

2193
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:38,810
you see him against mayweather.

2194
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:43,280
When he fought mayweather,
he couldn't even catch him.

2195
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:44,450
Yeah,
that's true.

2196
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:49,570
But maybe whether it's a mother fucker,
he's such a good box on is is you could 

2197
01:35:49,570 --> 01:35:53,471
argue is as fast maybe.
Well he won't be losing as much weight 

2198
01:35:53,471 --> 01:35:55,070
so maybe he'll be better and maybe we'd 
be better because he fought that fight,

2199
01:35:55,400 --> 01:36:00,400
you know?
I mean a fighter doesn't stay at the 

2200
01:36:00,400 --> 01:36:01,871
same level of skill year after year.
Ideally if they keep training and keep 

2201
01:36:01,871 --> 01:36:05,801
learning and he's completely dedicated,
he's going to be getting better and 

2202
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,490
better all the time.
Confident as champion.

2203
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:12,570
You mean that one lost to mayweather?
I think you probably learned more about 

2204
01:36:12,570 --> 01:36:16,451
what can happen to him in a fight.
Then all those fights were beat guys 

2205
01:36:16,451 --> 01:36:17,150
down.
Yeah.

2206
01:36:17,151 --> 01:36:17,590
I don't.
I,

2207
01:36:17,591 --> 01:36:20,390
I can't imagine the pressure that 
Canelo's under.

2208
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,970
I want to see Canelo and Gennady.
Golovkin.

2209
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:24,530
That's the fight that I want to say.

2210
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,420
Yeah.
I want to see what happens.

2211
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:29,630
That's this two guys that don't like to 
take backward steps.

2212
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:31,850
Both have ruthless power and great 
Chen's.

2213
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:33,890
Yeah.
I think he's a better boxer.

2214
01:36:33,891 --> 01:36:36,260
He's so technical.
He's so technical.

2215
01:36:36,261 --> 01:36:38,650
I love watching him train to video him 
training,

2216
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:42,650
just like just working the head movement
in the clinch for like an hour,

2217
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,540
you know what I mean?
Just like.

2218
01:36:45,110 --> 01:36:48,680
And then he's like teaching some kid 
also stopped to teach somebody.

2219
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,260
It's like he loves the sport.
You can tell.

2220
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,190
Yeah,
he certainly does,

2221
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:54,710
but I think Canelo does too.
I think Canelo is,

2222
01:36:54,711 --> 01:36:59,711
like you said,
is a little slower and he's just such a 

2223
01:36:59,711 --> 01:37:01,961
bruiser that he's got that sort of style
to them that he just loads up and bangs 

2224
01:37:01,961 --> 01:37:02,990
it guys,
but I think he's getting better too.

2225
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:05,480
I think he's slicker now that he's ever 
been before.

2226
01:37:05,480 --> 01:37:10,480
I think also a fight like mayweather,
just such a wake up call and you could 

2227
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,510
fight a guy like me with her or hate 
him.

2228
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:13,700
He's arguably one of the greatest boxers
ever.

2229
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,020
The guy retires and I know they're 
tired.

2230
01:37:17,380 --> 01:37:19,010
It's not an argument.
No argument.

2231
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:20,210
Yeah.
He's one of the greatest,

2232
01:37:20,540 --> 01:37:23,600
if not the greatest.
I mean he has this uncanny ability.

2233
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:26,210
He has the uncanny ability to make every
fight.

2234
01:37:26,211 --> 01:37:28,730
He fights the most boring fight you've 
ever seen your life.

2235
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:30,620
Incredible,
and it,

2236
01:37:30,660 --> 01:37:35,660
you know,
it kinda sucks because it's hard to get 

2237
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:35,840
your friends into boxing when it's like 
check it out.

2238
01:37:35,841 --> 01:37:40,841
This is supposed to be the best fight of
the Millennium Pacquiao versus 

2239
01:37:40,841 --> 01:37:44,321
mayweather and it's everybody's like,
what the fuck can we want something 

2240
01:37:44,321 --> 01:37:44,321
else?
You know what?

2241
01:37:44,321 --> 01:37:47,060
He just fights so safe and so smart and 
he's better.

2242
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,190
He's better at fighting that style.

2243
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:52,790
Then you are dealing with that style and
so when guys fight them,

2244
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:57,820
they just can't get to them and they 
fall into this sort of defensive shell 

2245
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:00,390
like eight or nine rounds in where they 
ended up making it look foolish.

2246
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:05,510
Yeah.
You start with swinging wildly and like 

2247
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,670
you play right into this trap.
Yeah.

2248
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:10,671
It's almost,
it almost sucks that I want to know 

2249
01:38:10,671 --> 01:38:10,671
who's going to fight next.
You think he's gonna fight again?

2250
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:11,840
Yeah.
Really?

2251
01:38:12,090 --> 01:38:12,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

2252
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:16,230
I don't think at one point in time you 
don't think he's going to retire.

2253
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:18,720
Maybe.
I haven't heard any real rumbling.

2254
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:23,721
So have you.
He just started flamboyantly saying he 

2255
01:38:23,721 --> 01:38:25,020
was retiring too much for me to believe 
it's a real retirement.

2256
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,270
It just feels like more of his 
promotion,

2257
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,610
you know what I mean?
And it's not like a stop training.

2258
01:38:30,090 --> 01:38:31,410
He hasn't.
I don't think so.

2259
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:32,630
No.
He's in the gym still.

2260
01:38:33,420 --> 01:38:38,420
Well you're probably right.
Then maybe he was waiting for the manny 

2261
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:40,971
Pacquiao fight,
like maybe waiting to see if it 

2262
01:38:40,971 --> 01:38:43,550
generated a lot of income and if manny 
was back and people loved them because 

2263
01:38:43,550 --> 01:38:45,740
you got to kind of give manny a chance 
to rebound like after the one man,

2264
01:38:45,741 --> 01:38:49,650
Walmart as fight we get knocked out.
He had to give him a chance to take some

2265
01:38:49,651 --> 01:38:53,190
time off.
Fight Against Chris Algieri look good.

2266
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:56,340
And then you could mark the fight.
Yeah.

2267
01:38:57,170 --> 01:39:00,810
I don't know that,
that was just such a bust for me,

2268
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,580
that fight.
It was just so,

2269
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,470
so goddamn boring,
you know,

2270
01:39:04,471 --> 01:39:05,370
and I,
you know,

2271
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,950
I was such a manny Pacquiao fan and to 
see him,

2272
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:12,720
to see him come up with nothing and then
have it,

2273
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:17,730
have the shoulder thing afterwards,
after the fact got it sucked.

2274
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:20,250
While the word was before the fight that
the shoulder was fucked up.

2275
01:39:20,400 --> 01:39:21,840
Yeah.
People had heard about that.

2276
01:39:21,841 --> 01:39:26,841
It was bookies were talking about it.
So some people didn't know that her 

2277
01:39:26,841 --> 01:39:27,600
shoulder was fucked up.
Yeah,

2278
01:39:27,601 --> 01:39:29,340
they should've.
They should've postpone the fight.

2279
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:31,200
Yeah.
But the problem is that in the,

2280
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:33,750
like some association sue them or 
something like that.

2281
01:39:33,810 --> 01:39:35,610
Well,
I mean he threw punches with it.

2282
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,640
I mean there was a class action lawsuit.
So the question is,

2283
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:43,641
was was it the injury bad back?
But I don't know what he did for a shop.

2284
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:46,200
Cortisone shot before the fight.
And they said no.

2285
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:49,350
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2286
01:39:49,490 --> 01:39:50,190
I should've just done it.

2287
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,000
Can't ask shit like that.
Just do it.

2288
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,330
Get a bunch of buddies to do it.
I mean I just love them and pack.

2289
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:03,390
He's like mini Elvis flying around his 
own jumbo jet with like a jumbo jet full

2290
01:40:03,781 --> 01:40:06,150
of his entourage.
Yeah,

2291
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:11,240
he's got a,
he's got a whole whole giant posy and 

2292
01:40:11,240 --> 01:40:14,340
none of them like gay people.
That was such a bummer.

2293
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:16,040
It was weird.
Yeah.

2294
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,490
But that's all that religious stuff 
though,

2295
01:40:17,491 --> 01:40:18,990
man.
It's just heavy Catholic.

2296
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:20,770
Yeah.
But Catholic or not,

2297
01:40:20,830 --> 01:40:23,460
you hate to see somebody who's so 
fucking blessed.

2298
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,910
A tear people down and over.
Nothing,

2299
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:27,400
I mean,
I,

2300
01:40:27,401 --> 01:40:30,120
I'd never paid for a manny Pacquiao 
fight again because of that.

2301
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:30,990
Yeah.
Really?

2302
01:40:31,050 --> 01:40:32,550
Yeah.
Wow.

2303
01:40:32,610 --> 01:40:34,140
Fuck that.
Wow.

2304
01:40:34,230 --> 01:40:35,400
That's interesting.
One hundred percent.

2305
01:40:35,880 --> 01:40:37,740
When you get to that level and you have 
that much money,

2306
01:40:37,741 --> 01:40:39,660
you should know fucking better.
Yeah.

2307
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:41,790
You know what I mean?
That's disgusting what he said.

2308
01:40:41,820 --> 01:40:44,290
And then he said it twice.
Yeah.

2309
01:40:44,310 --> 01:40:47,280
We tried to justify with the Bible God's
word.

2310
01:40:49,650 --> 01:40:50,280
Well,
I mean,

2311
01:40:50,460 --> 01:40:52,770
he probably didn't know the reaction 
that he was going to get,

2312
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,800
you know,
I bet in his culture he said gays are 

2313
01:40:57,800 --> 01:40:57,800
less than dogs,
less than animals.

2314
01:40:57,880 --> 01:41:00,180
Was that the exact word?
Yeah.

2315
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,180
Um,
I think he might've been misquoted,

2316
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:09,450
I think.
I think they tried to explain what he 

2317
01:41:09,450 --> 01:41:10,990
said based on what it says in the Bible 
that aisle after the fact.

2318
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:12,460
Yeah.
I don't remember,

2319
01:41:12,461 --> 01:41:14,170
but yeah,
whatever it was was not good.

2320
01:41:14,380 --> 01:41:15,100
I don't know,
man.

2321
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:20,580
It just,
it's just he's too rich and too too 

2322
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:22,720
blessed to be bringing people down,
persecute people down.

2323
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:24,700
There's just no good.
I took costume,

2324
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:25,690
a lot of fucking money,
man.

2325
01:41:25,691 --> 01:41:28,880
He lost his nike sponsorship because 
I'll never get my $99.

2326
01:41:28,890 --> 01:41:31,120
Ninety five,
that's for sure.

2327
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:33,580
Yeah.
You're not the only one.

2328
01:41:33,581 --> 01:41:38,581
I'm sure it is a farmer.
I don't know that that many boxing fans 

2329
01:41:38,581 --> 01:41:38,581
who actually care.

2330
01:41:38,581 --> 01:41:40,300
You don't think so.
I don't know.

2331
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:44,320
There's gotta be some boxing fans like 
you that are boxing fans,

2332
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:48,670
but our apes maybe for sure.
Yeah.

2333
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:51,270
All those people watching or.
No,

2334
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:52,730
I mean my friends,
my friend bought,

2335
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:56,950
bought the last fight and I kinda gave 
him a little shit and he just.

2336
01:41:56,951 --> 01:41:58,600
Because of the gay stuff.
Yeah,

2337
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:04,230
you do that,
you know it's going to be shitty blood 

2338
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:04,230
anyway.
It's like,

2339
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:04,230
why would you.
Well,

2340
01:42:04,230 --> 01:42:05,230
the poor guy,
he's all ate up with Jesus.

2341
01:42:06,030 --> 01:42:07,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

2342
01:42:07,810 --> 01:42:08,590
I just,
I dunno,

2343
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:13,650
I dunno.
I'm not that familiar with his culture 

2344
01:42:13,650 --> 01:42:17,821
and exactly how,
but I know for a fact a lot of 

2345
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:17,821
Catholics.
Yeah.

2346
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:20,740
All the Philippines is just overwhelmed 
with Christianity and Catholicism,

2347
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:25,150
so he probably thought he was actually 
trying to save people some strange way,

2348
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,100
you know,
in his brainwashed mind.

2349
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:32,160
Yeah.
I wonder how much of the negative 

2350
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:32,160
feedback actually gets to him though,
you know,

2351
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:32,160
none.

2352
01:42:32,160 --> 01:42:32,350
You don't think so?
No.

2353
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,510
You don't think I'm saying it's like 
mini Elvis.

2354
01:42:34,540 --> 01:42:37,600
He doesn't hear anything.
He's got shades on.

2355
01:42:38,350 --> 01:42:43,350
50 people and his own jumbo jet.
Who's going to tell him that he's an 

2356
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:44,610
asshole?
I want to know.

2357
01:42:44,620 --> 01:42:47,950
But money can last if he keeps rolling 
in the Philippines.

2358
01:42:48,010 --> 01:42:53,010
Yeah.
Well honestly you'd probably say his 

2359
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:53,800
money with his own check because they 
need to have to buy 50 plane tickets.

2360
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:55,440
Cab,
right.

2361
01:42:55,450 --> 01:42:57,970
If it's cost effective for him to have 
his own jet,

2362
01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:00,610
that's an interesting way to look at.
But he's so beloved in this country.

2363
01:43:00,611 --> 01:43:02,560
They probably just give him a jet.
You know,

2364
01:43:02,561 --> 01:43:05,820
he just held representative country.
That guy's a hell of a pool player.

2365
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:06,480
He.
Yeah.

2366
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:09,400
And he's a lefty too.
He plays really good.

2367
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:12,160
He plays like at a professional level.
Does he?

2368
01:43:12,190 --> 01:43:17,190
Yeah.
Well the Philippines or it's a giant 

2369
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:17,190
place for pool.

2370
01:43:17,190 --> 01:43:21,040
Uh,
the Gis brought it over there in the 

2371
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,071
fifties and uh,
some of the best pool players in the 

2372
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:23,071
world to come out of the Philippines,
matter of fact,

2373
01:43:23,071 --> 01:43:24,220
the consensus,
greatest player of all time,

2374
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:26,440
effort,
and Reyes came out of the Philippines.

2375
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:28,590
A logician yeah.
Yeah.

2376
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:32,110
They have some of the best players and 
really interesting to watch them because

2377
01:43:32,111 --> 01:43:33,970
they play like they're playing a musical
instrument,

2378
01:43:34,180 --> 01:43:36,880
like a very gentle game for them.
It's very different.

2379
01:43:37,150 --> 01:43:41,260
It's not like stiff or hard.
It's a very gentle flowing.

2380
01:43:41,261 --> 01:43:42,190
Yeah.
Their stroke,

2381
01:43:42,220 --> 01:43:46,930
they have a very particular type of 
stroke that other players worldwide have

2382
01:43:46,931 --> 01:43:49,750
emulated the Filipino style of play 
pool.

2383
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:50,950
Wow.
Interesting.

2384
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:51,970
I didn't know that.
You

2385
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:53,500
know,
what,

2386
01:43:53,540 --> 01:43:58,540
what other countries are like embracing 
American rock and Blues Music and doing 

2387
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:02,090
a good job with it today.
I mean,

2388
01:44:02,091 --> 01:44:04,760
UK is always been a huge supporter.
France,

2389
01:44:05,450 --> 01:44:07,730
Australia,
they've always,

2390
01:44:08,090 --> 01:44:09,050
you know,
Australia,

2391
01:44:09,051 --> 01:44:09,590
I mean,
shit,

2392
01:44:09,650 --> 01:44:11,480
they live in live and die for rock and 
roll.

2393
01:44:11,690 --> 01:44:14,210
Do they get good artists that are coming
out of there today?

2394
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:14,930
Like do you,
what do you,

2395
01:44:14,931 --> 01:44:16,580
where do you see?
Yeah.

2396
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,360
Uh,
Australia,

2397
01:44:17,361 --> 01:44:18,230
there's,
there's great,

2398
01:44:18,530 --> 01:44:23,530
great music coming out of there and 
maybe do you ever listened to tame 

2399
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:23,530
impala?
No,

2400
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:23,830
they're from,
they're from Australia.

2401
01:44:23,831 --> 01:44:27,380
How do you spell it?
T ime and then impala.

2402
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:30,620
Tame Impala.
They make really cool records.

2403
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:32,710
They're pretty famous now.
I,

2404
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:37,720
I would say they,
they might even be like a festival 

2405
01:44:37,720 --> 01:44:38,630
headliner at this point.
Really the other big band and uh,

2406
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:40,520
and they're from Australia.
There's a whole scene.

2407
01:44:40,521 --> 01:44:44,540
They're kind of around that in the 
absence of radio,

2408
01:44:44,630 --> 01:44:49,160
like what is the traditional method that
bands get noticed now?

2409
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:53,150
Like is it just hustling and Torrin and 
spread?

2410
01:44:53,151 --> 01:44:55,160
I don't know.
I have no idea.

2411
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:57,410
You just do your shit.
I have no fucking idea.

2412
01:44:58,310 --> 01:45:02,090
I just had an 85 year old gospel singer 
from Mississippi and my studio last week

2413
01:45:02,091 --> 01:45:04,160
and that's all I was thinking about.
You know what I mean?

2414
01:45:04,161 --> 01:45:04,760
It's like,
wow,

2415
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:06,710
I have no idea with what goes on in the 
music business.

2416
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:10,280
I really don't.
What was the gospel singers name?

2417
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:11,690
His name is Leo.
Bud Welch.

2418
01:45:12,110 --> 01:45:13,400
Wow.
Oh yeah.

2419
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:15,710
So cool.
What'd you have to do?

2420
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:17,270
Play music man.
But what,

2421
01:45:17,300 --> 01:45:18,990
like what we did a record with them,
uh,

2422
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:20,660
I had some,
some of my friends in and we,

2423
01:45:20,661 --> 01:45:23,300
uh,
we just sorta like would let him start a

2424
01:45:23,301 --> 01:45:25,430
song and try to try to,
you know,

2425
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:27,770
get him where he fit in.
Wow.

2426
01:45:28,730 --> 01:45:33,730
Yeah.
And we did a whole record in three days 

2427
01:45:33,730 --> 01:45:33,730
with them and then,
you know,

2428
01:45:34,150 --> 01:45:36,230
it's just like,
that's incredible.

2429
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

2430
01:45:38,211 --> 01:45:39,230
He was,
he's incredible.

2431
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:44,420
He plays guitar and sings and he's very 
frail and kind of hunched over.

2432
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:49,760
But he keeps perfect time.
Like we could record them by himself and

2433
01:45:49,761 --> 01:45:54,650
then you could just watch him on a,
like with the bpm hedges right on it,

2434
01:45:54,651 --> 01:45:56,240
man.
That's wild.

2435
01:45:58,170 --> 01:45:59,870
A lifetime of doing it.
You know,

2436
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:04,340
there's something about Old Gospel and 
old blues.

2437
01:46:04,341 --> 01:46:05,040
There's like a,
there's,

2438
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:09,020
there's a sound to like a lot of the old
south that uh,

2439
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:12,590
the inescapable soulful sound.
You know,

2440
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:15,830
there's some,
there's some old blues like to this day,

2441
01:46:15,831 --> 01:46:18,440
like some John Lee Hooker,
like boom,

2442
01:46:18,441 --> 01:46:19,160
boom,
boom.

2443
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,720
Like you listen to like wow,
like this is just such a special kind of

2444
01:46:23,721 --> 01:46:28,721
sound and it's instantaneous and you 
don't have to know anything about it to 

2445
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:28,721
love it.
Yeah.

2446
01:46:28,721 --> 01:46:31,100
Which is so cool.
And it took the world by storm.

2447
01:46:31,101 --> 01:46:33,500
I mean John Lee Hooker was really 
influential in Africa.

2448
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:38,860
Like his record.
He went over there and people like Ali 

2449
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:42,590
Farka Toure.
He was like one of the greatest African 

2450
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:42,590
guitar players heard his records and 
inspired him.

2451
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:44,090
You know?
I mean,

2452
01:46:44,120 --> 01:46:49,120
yeah,
it's just that there's something about 

2453
01:46:49,120 --> 01:46:51,101
it that's like some of those guys.
It's just undeniably awesome and you 

2454
01:46:51,101 --> 01:46:55,341
don't really know how to describe it.
There's like the ingredients are so 

2455
01:46:55,341 --> 01:46:55,341
minimal.
Yeah.

2456
01:46:55,341 --> 01:46:58,790
Everybody else had a guitar.
Why didn't they make it sound like that 

2457
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,790
too?
You know what I mean?

2458
01:46:58,790 --> 01:47:03,230
Well,
it seems like there was a bunch of 

2459
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:03,230
different things going on.
It was the,

2460
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:06,740
the audience that had been exposed to a 
lot of other great music and they 

2461
01:47:07,081 --> 01:47:12,081
appreciated it.
There was like the experience of the 

2462
01:47:12,081 --> 01:47:14,190
people that were performing it,
the life experience that they had behind

2463
01:47:14,191 --> 01:47:19,191
the words they had lived like sorrowful 
times and expressed it legitimately and,

2464
01:47:19,650 --> 01:47:20,140
and,
and,

2465
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,110
and truly in the music.

2466
01:47:22,230 --> 01:47:24,930
Right.
But it was also just where they're from.

2467
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:25,680
Who they.
Yeah.

2468
01:47:25,690 --> 01:47:30,690
So that's who they are.
It's not even like that there maybe 

2469
01:47:30,690 --> 01:47:31,080
their lives were so bad.
It's just like,

2470
01:47:32,460 --> 01:47:37,460
again,
it's like it's just such a part of who 

2471
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:37,460
they were.
They,

2472
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:37,460
they would never be able to explain it.
Right.

2473
01:47:37,470 --> 01:47:42,470
You know what I mean?
And they could never teach a course on 

2474
01:47:42,470 --> 01:47:42,510
blues and a,
at Harvard,

2475
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,190
you know,
you have to live it right.

2476
01:47:44,191 --> 01:47:49,191
And you'd have to experience that vibe 
from another musician to know that it's 

2477
01:47:49,191 --> 01:47:49,680
possible for someone to do it.
Right.

2478
01:47:50,970 --> 01:47:51,740
I don't know.
I mean,

2479
01:47:51,741 --> 01:47:51,980
I,
I,

2480
01:47:53,050 --> 01:47:55,830
there's only so much you can learn from 
people.

2481
01:47:56,100 --> 01:48:01,100
You know,
at a certain point you have to 

2482
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:01,100
understand that what makes them special 
is because it's stem,

2483
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:02,790
it comes out of them.
You can't learn that.

2484
01:48:02,791 --> 01:48:07,791
You can't really take it,
but what you can take is the feeling of 

2485
01:48:07,791 --> 01:48:09,840
they had their own identity and you've 
got to find that in yourself.

2486
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:11,820
That's the thing that you want to 
ultimately get,

2487
01:48:12,210 --> 01:48:17,210
you know what I mean?
You want to be influenced by all these 

2488
01:48:17,210 --> 01:48:18,831
people.
But the main influence that I think you 

2489
01:48:18,831 --> 01:48:18,831
should learn from the greats are that 
you,

2490
01:48:18,831 --> 01:48:20,670
you have to find it in yourself.
You know,

2491
01:48:20,671 --> 01:48:22,620
you can't rely on anybody else.
Right.

2492
01:48:22,780 --> 01:48:27,780
And I think to see it in someone else 
gives you that inspiration to try to 

2493
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:28,380
find it in yourself.
So I used to search for it.

2494
01:48:28,410 --> 01:48:30,330
Just constant.
I mean it'd be at the library,

2495
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:32,810
getting up vhs,
you know,

2496
01:48:33,330 --> 01:48:37,230
videos and just watching,
rewinding,

2497
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:42,350
watching,
and then I would drive 19 hours from 

2498
01:48:42,350 --> 01:48:45,681
Akron to Mississippi just to like maybe 
find a musician who I heard lived in 

2499
01:48:45,681 --> 01:48:47,220
some town,
you know what I mean?

2500
01:48:47,221 --> 01:48:50,610
Just because I wanted to see it and 
know.

2501
01:48:50,611 --> 01:48:51,870
And,
and when I find,

2502
01:48:51,900 --> 01:48:54,900
when I found it,
shit is life changing man.

2503
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:58,350
I mean,
I was like 17 and I went to Greenville,

2504
01:48:58,351 --> 01:49:01,110
Mississippi and I just started asking 
around for this musician named,

2505
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:05,430
his name was t model Ford and he made 
some really cool t model Ford.

2506
01:49:05,460 --> 01:49:06,930
Yeah.
He was a total bad ass.

2507
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:09,720
He played a death metal guitar.
Like really the PV.

2508
01:49:10,110 --> 01:49:15,110
Yeah.
And it said with the letters you put on 

2509
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:15,110
a mailbox,
it's like said t model Ford.

2510
01:49:15,110 --> 01:49:19,731
The tail dragger had it spray painted on
his trailer that he pulled her out with 

2511
01:49:19,731 --> 01:49:23,871
his Lincoln and I just go in there.
I would never want to just like become 

2512
01:49:24,691 --> 01:49:25,760
that person.
Right.

2513
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:31,250
But whether they're from Mississippi or 
they're like a classical composer from 

2514
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:37,250
Germany,
there's a thing that these all these 

2515
01:49:37,250 --> 01:49:37,860
guys have in common and it's like a 
sense of self,

2516
01:49:38,250 --> 01:49:41,070
you know what I mean?
Anybody I've ever met has a real.

2517
01:49:42,240 --> 01:49:44,490
Just a confidence that,
you know,

2518
01:49:44,700 --> 01:49:46,560
even though they may not be the best at 
certain things,

2519
01:49:46,561 --> 01:49:48,820
they can like bring out the best in 
themselves,

2520
01:49:48,910 --> 01:49:49,390
you know,
and that.

2521
01:49:49,450 --> 01:49:51,550
And that's like enough.
Do you know what I mean?

2522
01:49:51,670 --> 01:49:54,010
I definitely know what you mean.
I know what you mean.

2523
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,480
Yeah,
I know exactly what you mean.

2524
01:49:55,481 --> 01:49:58,930
You described it very well.
That's a great way of putting it.

2525
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:04,680
Is it like to seeing it and other people
recognizing it in other people and 

2526
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:09,420
trying to find it in yourself and that.
So seeing it in other people me and know

2527
01:50:09,641 --> 01:50:12,210
that it's real thing that inspires.
Yes,

2528
01:50:12,730 --> 01:50:14,000
absolutely.
Yes.

2529
01:50:14,020 --> 01:50:17,260
And you see somebody like t model or any
of those guys,

2530
01:50:17,261 --> 01:50:21,520
you know,
they didn't have any extra thing.

2531
01:50:22,420 --> 01:50:27,100
They didn't have anything like any like 
advantage really.

2532
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:32,510
Do you know what I mean?
It was a struggle just like it is for 

2533
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:32,510
anybody,
you know,

2534
01:50:32,510 --> 01:50:33,010
but they found it in themselves I guess.

2535
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:36,670
Well that's all.
Any artists you'd ever hope for them.

2536
01:50:36,850 --> 01:50:41,850
That's the number one aspiration.
Find out whatever is the best part of 

2537
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:41,850
you.
Right.

2538
01:50:41,850 --> 01:50:43,510
How do you get your best stuff out 
there?

2539
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:45,700
I mean,
I'm still trying.

2540
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:46,960
Well,
you know,

2541
01:50:46,990 --> 01:50:49,360
I mean I think that uh,
I,

2542
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:51,580
for me,
I just don't want ever be too critical.

2543
01:50:52,090 --> 01:50:53,560
Self critical.
I want it to be.

2544
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:58,090
I want to try to like have it on,
on the record,

2545
01:50:58,930 --> 01:51:02,230
like in it for the first couple takes.
So it feels for me,

2546
01:51:02,231 --> 01:51:04,630
I'll feel a little bit more real,
a bit more genuine.

2547
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:10,120
Do you know what I mean?
I think that was really helpful to a 

2548
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:10,120
record.
Some of my favorite records,

2549
01:51:10,120 --> 01:51:13,540
whether they're hip hop or whether the 
rock and roll or whatever.

2550
01:51:13,610 --> 01:51:18,610
There may generally made pretty quickly 
big grand master pieces that were 

2551
01:51:18,761 --> 01:51:23,500
labored over.
I don't tend to listen to that much.

2552
01:51:24,310 --> 01:51:28,180
I'll listen to it and it'll be.
Maybe I'll hear something sonically that

2553
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:29,440
little.
That's cool that they did that.

2554
01:51:29,441 --> 01:51:34,441
But then like at the end of the day,
I always go and put on that one record 

2555
01:51:34,441 --> 01:51:35,440
that that one guy did in a day.
You know,

2556
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,910
that's the one I always want to live 
with.

2557
01:51:36,911 --> 01:51:38,280
That's my desert island shit,
you know,

2558
01:51:40,360 --> 01:51:41,710
my desert island.
Shit.

2559
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:44,420
Well listen man,
thank you very much for doing this.

2560
01:51:44,421 --> 01:51:46,780
I really appreciate you coming in here.
And um,

2561
01:51:46,900 --> 01:51:48,410
I,
I appreciate what you do too.

2562
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:50,210
I really do.
And so for me,

2563
01:51:50,211 --> 01:51:53,810
I'm geeked out fan.
I'm super psyched and to get you to talk

2564
01:51:53,811 --> 01:51:56,720
about your creative process like that,
it's just giant for me.

2565
01:51:56,850 --> 01:52:00,320
So if people want to get your music,
the Arcs,

2566
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:01,490

uh,

2567
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:06,700

2569
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:06,700
We have a record called years dreamily

2570
01:52:06,700 --> 01:52:08,680
