1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,520
Five four,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:03,563
three,

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,180
dos uno,

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:10,431
come on.

5
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:11,270
Tri caster

6
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:13,503
live.

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,560
Well,

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,780
live plays and gentlemen to my left,

9
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,350
uh,

10
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:18,550
Tim Timple,

11
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,840
everybody knows and loves him.

12
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,710
Viga,

13
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:21,040
what is it?

14
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,310
How do you,

15
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,580
how do I pronounce your last name again?

16
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:24,211
Not Visa.

17
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:29,211
Vigia Vigia Gadi Gadi and your position
at Twitter is I lead trust and safety.

18
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,380
Legal and public policy.

19
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,273
That's a lot.

20
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,323
That's a lot.

21
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,440
And Jack Dorsey,

22
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:35,910
ladies,

23
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,743
gentlemen.

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,690
Um,

25
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,141
first of all,

26
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,400
thank you everybody for doing this.

27
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,600
Appreciate it.

28
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,270
Thank you.

29
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:43,450
Feels the feels all of a sudden
there's tension in the room.

30
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,633
We're all,

31
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:45,880
we're all loosey Goosey.

32
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:46,900
Just a few minutes ago,

33
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:47,860
attention never wins.

34
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:48,011
Like,

35
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:48,371
oh,

36
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:49,360
this is really happening.

37
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,194
Here we go.

38
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:50,980
Um,

39
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,510
before we get started we should say,

40
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:56,070
because there were some
things that people wanted to,

41
00:00:56,071 --> 00:00:56,590
uh,

42
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,670
have us talk about.

43
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,750
One that the cash APP is one
of the sponsors of the podcast.

44
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:05,770
It's been a sponsor for a long time and
also a giant supporter of my good friend

45
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:07,750
Justin is fight for the forgotten charity,

46
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:09,430
building wells for the
pygmies in the Congo.

47
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,360
This is very important to me and I'm very
happy that you guys are a part of that

48
00:01:13,361 --> 00:01:15,040
and you are connected to that.

49
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,233
I don't,

50
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,600
uh,

51
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,080
that's,

52
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,860
I mean it's easy for someone to say that
doesn't have an influence on the way we

53
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:21,611
discuss things,

54
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:22,444
but it doesn't,

55
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,650
so if it does,

56
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,083
I don't know what to tell you.

57
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,470
I'm going to mention too,

58
00:01:26,471 --> 00:01:28,750
just cause I don't want people
to come out and freak out later.

59
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:30,610
I actually have like 80 shares in square,

60
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,470
which isn't really that much,

61
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,070
you know,

62
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,610
but,

63
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,300
but it's something,

64
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:34,661
it is,

65
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:35,020
it is.

66
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,070
So I don't want people to think,

67
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:36,760
you know,

68
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,340
whatever you,

69
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,350
you're the CEO of square,

70
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:38,591
I think,

71
00:01:38,591 --> 00:01:38,920
right?

72
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,250
Yup.

73
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:39,401
Yeah.

74
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:39,920
There you go.

75
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,080
Well,

76
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,391
there you go.

77
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:40,760
We on,

78
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,620
we on the cash up out.

79
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,590
And the reason why we
decided to come together is,

80
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,100
um,

81
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,670
we had,

82
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,270
I thought,

83
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,740
a great conversation last time,

84
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,470
but there was a lot of people that were
upset that there were some issues that

85
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:53,950
we didn't discuss or didn't discuss in
depth enough or they felt that I didn't

86
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:54,784
press you enough.

87
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,220
I talked to Tim because,

88
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:57,571
uh,

89
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:57,711
you know,

90
00:01:57,711 --> 00:02:02,110
Tim and I have talked before and he made
a video about it and I felt like his

91
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,460
criticism was very valid.

92
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,710
So we got on the phone,

93
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,531
we talked about it,

94
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:08,740
and I knew immediately within the first
few minutes of the conversation that he

95
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:10,690
was far more educated
about this than I was.

96
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,711
So I said,

97
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:15,700
would you be willing to do a podcast
and perhaps do a podcast with Jack?

98
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:16,901
And he said,

99
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:17,381
absolutely.

100
00:02:17,381 --> 00:02:19,120
So we did a podcast together.

101
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,200
It was really well received.

102
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,240
People felt like we covered
a lot of the issues that,

103
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:22,810
um,

104
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,700
they felt like I didn't bring up.

105
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,250
And so then Jack and I had
discussed it and we said,

106
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:27,401
well,

107
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:31,390
let's bring Tim on and
then have Vigia on as well.

108
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,100
I say that right?

109
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,510
Yeah,

110
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:33,200
that's a hard one.

111
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,521
Sorry.

112
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,120
I'll get it right.

113
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,953
I promise.

114
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:35,411
Uh,

115
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:36,170
but,

116
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,003
so we're here,

117
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:37,790
we're here,

118
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,623
um,

119
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,640
today.

120
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,030
Uh,

121
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,481
you know,

122
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,740
do you know who Sean Baker is?

123
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:45,700
He's a doctor who's a prominent
proponent of the carnivore diet.

124
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,980
His post was,

125
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,410
his account was frozen today.

126
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,210
I just sent it to Jamie.

127
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,913
Yeah,

128
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,080
his count was frozen today
because of an image that he had,

129
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:58,870
because he's a proponent of the carnivore.

130
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,960
There's a lot of people that believe that
this elimination diet is very healthy

131
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,460
for you and it's known to cure a lot of
autoimmune issues with certain people,

132
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:10,270
but some people ideologically opposed
it because they think it's bad for the

133
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,570
environment or you shouldn't eat
meat or whatever the reasons are.

134
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,321
This is huge.

135
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,640
And the bitcoin community,

136
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,360
yes.

137
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah.

138
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,433
Well it's the,

139
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,190
for a lot of people that have autoimmune
issues with particularly psoriasis and

140
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,600
arthritis is,

141
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:23,650
is a lifesaver.

142
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,580
It's crazy.

143
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:25,990
It's essentially,

144
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,850
it's an autoimmune issue,

145
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,940
so because he has a photo of a lion in
a header eating a looks like a wheel to

146
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:34,360
peace or something like that,

147
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,840
his account was locked
for violating these rules,

148
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:42,130
rules against graphic violence or
adult content in profile images.

149
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:45,720
That seems a little silly and I,

150
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,040
I wanted to just mention
that right away now,

151
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,740
whose decision is something like that,

152
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,850
like who decides to lock a guy's account
out because it has a nature image?

153
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:56,920
If you know natural predatory behavior

154
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,740
on this particular case,

155
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,820
it's probably an algorithm that detected
it and made some sort of an assessment.

156
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,050
But as a general rule,

157
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,310
how we operate as a company as we rely
on people to report information to us.

158
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,700
So if you look at any tweet and you can
kind of pull down on the carrot on the

159
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:14,490
right and you can say report the tweet
and then you have a bunch of categories

160
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,560
you can choose from
what you want to report.

161
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:17,640
Um,

162
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,060
I think this one in particular though,

163
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:20,010
it was probably an algorithm.

164
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,980
So how does does,

165
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,890
does he have the option to protest
that or to ask someone to review it?

166
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,651
Absolutely.

167
00:04:27,651 --> 00:04:27,920
And I,

168
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,101
I,

169
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,320
I'm guessing that people
are already reviewing it,

170
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:34,430
but there's a choice to appeal any action
and that would go to a human to make

171
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,480
sure that it is actually a violation
of the roles or in this case,

172
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:39,051
if it's not,

173
00:04:39,051 --> 00:04:40,040
then it would be removed.

174
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,510
Is that a violation of the rules?

175
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,513
I image?

176
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,880
I don't think so.

177
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,550
I don't think that that would be what
we're trying to capture in terms of

178
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:48,140
graphic images and an avatar.

179
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:49,670
It's more about violence towards,

180
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:50,270
uh,

181
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,110
humans unless it was some sort of cruelty
depicting or walls or something like

182
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:54,381
that.

183
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:56,870
But this seems not the
intention of the role.

184
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,590
Does this ha this one of the reason why
I wanted to bring this up immediately,

185
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:04,591
does this highlight a flaw in the system
in that people can target an individual

186
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,304
cause with him,

187
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,533
he's uh,

188
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,021
he,

189
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:08,411
like I said,

190
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,560
he's a doctor and a proponent
of this carnivore die,

191
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,500
but he's also,

192
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:16,300
he ruthless in his condemnation
and mocking of vegans.

193
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:20,920
He does it all the time and so then they
get upset at him and they can target

194
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:23,650
posts and just report them and mass.

195
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,850
And when they do that,

196
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,960
then this becomes an issue.

197
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,890
I think this does reveal part of,

198
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,730
um,

199
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,151
you know,

200
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:35,000
the challenges that we face as a
global platform at scale and this PR,

201
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,460
I don't,

202
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,480
I don't know what happened in this case,

203
00:05:36,481 --> 00:05:36,750
sorry.

204
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,890
It's hard for me to talk about it.

205
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:42,030
But what I would say is that it doesn't
really matter if one person reports it

206
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:43,560
or 10,000 people report it.

207
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:47,160
Like we're going to review the reports
and we're going to make an assessment and

208
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:48,000
we're never going to,

209
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,133
you know,

210
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,220
kick someone off the platform finally and
forever without a person taking a look

211
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,980
and making sure that
it's an actual violation.

212
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,930
Right.

213
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,440
Okay.

214
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,010
So,

215
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,430
but the,

216
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,010
but the mob

217
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,910
reporting behavior,

218
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,480
it does happen.

219
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,931
Yeah,

220
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:00,440
it does.

221
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,210
It happens across the spectrum.

222
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,370
I'd have to assume it's
going to be one direction.

223
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:04,441
I,

224
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,260
I can't imagine he would target vegans,

225
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:07,250
but vegans would talk at him.

226
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,150
Right?

227
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,541
Well,

228
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,021
he might,

229
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,261
I mean,

230
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:09,780
he doesn't,

231
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,620
but is he the kind of guy is going to
want to report to vegans and get them

232
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,454
banned from Twitter.

233
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,750
Of course you're gonna
wanna make fun of them.

234
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,680
He's going to make fun of them.

235
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,650
They're going to target him to try and
get them removed by exploiting the system

236
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:19,480
that you guys have.

237
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,470
It may not be him though.

238
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,670
It can also be his followers.

239
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,410
It's a really complicated world out there.

240
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:23,940
So yeah,

241
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,450
you don't want the motivations of why
people mob report are different and it's

242
00:06:28,451 --> 00:06:30,040
not always something
under someone's control.

243
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,910
We could ease and even be other carnivore
diet proponents who are just jerks

244
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,940
that don't like him because he's
getting all the love people are weird.

245
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,450
Yeah.

246
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,283
But it's history.

247
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,390
The idea though is that it does kind of
highlight a bit of a flaw in that it's

248
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:45,530
good that someone can like,

249
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:47,210
cause you might see something awful,

250
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,840
someone doxing someone or something
like that and then you can take that and

251
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:55,250
report it and then people can see it and
get rid of it and minimize the damage

252
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,370
that there's another big problem
here and that is the Carnivore Diet

253
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,360
legitimately healthy?

254
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,620
Is it a threat to your health?

255
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,980
And if it is is what is Twitter's
responsibility in controlling that

256
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:07,500
information?

257
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:07,741
Right.

258
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,770
So just to clarify my,

259
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,140
my,

260
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,030
my opinion is if he wants to be a
proponent for the carnivore diet,

261
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,780
let them,

262
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,320
but you've got people on Youtube who
are being d ranked for certain beliefs

263
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:18,210
about certain health issues
that I don't agree with.

264
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,820
And so one of the risks then is,

265
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,361
you know,

266
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,690
we're coming towards a position where
people think some ideas are better than

267
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:24,961
others.

268
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:25,351
Therefore,

269
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,630
as a company we're going to restrict
access to certain information.

270
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,180
You mean like anti-vaxxer.

271
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,870
Exactly.

272
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,270
Right.

273
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,980
So I guess I'm trying to say is at what
point would you guys restrict someone

274
00:07:34,981 --> 00:07:35,880
from sharing info,

275
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,260
like false information about vaccines?

276
00:07:37,261 --> 00:07:38,094
I could get someone hurt

277
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,760
that is not a violation
of Twitter was roles.

278
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,700
No,

279
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,110
I,

280
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,943
I think,

281
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,180
I mean that'd be interesting to hear
your ideas around this book or our

282
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,380
perspective right now is,

283
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,010
um,

284
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,900
around this concept of
variety of perspective.

285
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,311
Like are we,

286
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:58,110
are we encouraging more echo chambers
and filter bubbles or we at least showing

287
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,710
people other information that
might be counter to what they see.

288
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,544
And there's,

289
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,790
there's a bunch of research that would
suggest that further emboldens reviews.

290
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,400
There's also research that were suggested.

291
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,010
It at least gives him a
consideration about what their,

292
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:11,940
what they currently believe.

293
00:08:11,941 --> 00:08:13,050
So w you guys,

294
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,651
oh,

295
00:08:13,651 --> 00:08:13,861
go ahead.

296
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,130
Sorry.

297
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,160
Given the dynamics of our
network being completely public,

298
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,780
we're not organized around communities.

299
00:08:18,781 --> 00:08:20,190
We're not organized around topics.

300
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,593
Um,

301
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:26,780
we have a little bit more freedom to
show more of the spectrum of any one

302
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:27,660
particular issue.

303
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,880
And I think that's how we would,

304
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,840
we would approach it
from the start that said,

305
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,870
we haven't really dealt much
with misinformation more
broadly across like these

306
00:08:39,601 --> 00:08:40,351
sorts of topics.

307
00:08:40,351 --> 00:08:40,651
We've,

308
00:08:40,651 --> 00:08:45,370
we've focused our efforts
on elections and uh,

309
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,830
well mainly elections right now.

310
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah.

311
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,550
Youtube is a different animal.

312
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:49,300
You know,

313
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,730
someone can really convince
you that the earth is flat.

314
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:55,650
If you're gullible and you watch a 45
minute youtube video right now it's kind

315
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,100
of a different

316
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,640
thing.

317
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,051
But I want to,

318
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:57,940
I want it to just kind of,

319
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,350
uh,

320
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:01,110
get into that statement you made about
misinformation and whether or not you'll

321
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:01,944
police it.

322
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:02,490
So like,

323
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:06,900
I think that the tough part of this is
really an love to have a discussion about

324
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:10,320
this is do you really want corporations
to police what's true and not true?

325
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,061
Absolutely not.

326
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:11,701
So really,

327
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:12,660
really tough position.

328
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:13,494
But you guys do that.

329
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,880
We try not to do that.

330
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:15,870
We don't want to do that.

331
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,070
But you do and your rules.

332
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,460
But the places that we focus on is where
we think that people are going to be

333
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:25,461
harmed by this in a direct and tangible
way that we feel a responsibility to

334
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,990
correct ourselves.

335
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,350
Rules to what do you mean by that?

336
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,870
Gender dead naming and
mis-gendering that's a specific
ideology that's unique to

337
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:36,330
a very small faction of people in this
world that you guys actually banned

338
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:37,140
people for.

339
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:40,470
So the way I think of it
is it's behavior based.

340
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,390
And I know you think of
it as content and we can,

341
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,680
we can disagree on this point,

342
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,700
but this is about why are you
doing this to a trans person?

343
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,490
Why are you calling them by this name
when they've chosen to go by a different

344
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:52,650
name or why are you
outing them in some way?

345
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,050
Like what is your intent
and purpose behind that?

346
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,350
[inaudible] mean to interrupt.

347
00:09:56,351 --> 00:09:57,630
But in the interest of clarity,

348
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:00,810
I wanted to explain what deadnaming means.

349
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:00,991
Right?

350
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,240
Right.

351
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,350
So that,

352
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,211
so,

353
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:03,700
uh,

354
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,480
a transgender individual changes
their name when they transition.

355
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,270
A dead name would be the birth name
or the name they went by before the

356
00:10:09,271 --> 00:10:10,104
transition.

357
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,850
So that was my mom's probably
going what and what's a debt name?

358
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,630
And I will clarify to your role
specifically targeted mis-gendering and

359
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:19,170
deadnaming.

360
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,160
I believe it's correct.

361
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,371
Right?

362
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:24,750
So years ago we passed a policy that we
call our hateful conduct policy and that

363
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:28,650
prohibits targeting or attacking
someone based on their belonging and,

364
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,880
and any number of groups,

365
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,790
whether it's because of their religion
or their race or their gender,

366
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,460
their sexual orientation
and their gender identity.

367
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:38,390
So it was something that's
broad based is that you,

368
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,760
you can't choose to attack people because
of these characteristics will have

369
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,590
limits on what characteristics you police.

370
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,011
Right?

371
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:44,550
So you're not,

372
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,920
you're not a banning people,

373
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:47,610
but for targeted trans species.

374
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:47,941
Others,

375
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,670
right.

376
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:48,880
Uh,

377
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,070
will,

378
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,240
we have also general abuse
and harassment are walls,

379
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:51,481
right?

380
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,420
Which says you can't engage in abuse
and harassment on the platform,

381
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,950
but you can't designate someone,

382
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,240
but you can call them stupid.

383
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:58,590
Uh,

384
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,130
generally,

385
00:10:59,130 --> 00:10:59,341
I mean,

386
00:10:59,341 --> 00:11:01,050
if you created an account that,

387
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:01,621
uh,

388
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:05,370
only was there to call the
same person stupid 5,000 times,

389
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,020
we'd probably view that as a,

390
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,770
you know,

391
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,230
targeted,

392
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,580
harassed,

393
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,413
targeted harassment.

394
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,010
It's a function of the bit,

395
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:15,330
it's a fortunate behavior because people
with our system can do this in massive

396
00:11:15,331 --> 00:11:16,164
velocity.

397
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,890
Ultimately silence you from a
platform or to say like I give up,

398
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:20,850
I don't want to deal with this thing

399
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:25,710
so we can just get into
all of the big examples.

400
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:26,544
I mean uh,

401
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,900
starting with painting to Tim,

402
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:31,860
but can we just take a step back and try
to level set of what we're trying to do

403
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:33,540
with our policies because
I think it's worth doing.

404
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:33,990
Yes.

405
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,990
So as,

406
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,580
as a,

407
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,510
as a high level,

408
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,650
I personally,

409
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,960
and this isn't my job
to run the policy team,

410
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,830
I believe that everyone has a voice and
should be able to use it and I want them

411
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:45,030
to be able to use it online.

412
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,390
Now where we draw a line is when people
use their voice and use their platform

413
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,110
to abuse and harass other
people to silence them.

414
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,010
Because I think that that's what we've
seen over the years is a number of people

415
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,280
who have been silenced online because
of the abuse and harassment they've

416
00:12:00,281 --> 00:12:00,701
received.

417
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:00,870
Any,

418
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,610
either stop talking or they leave
the platform and its entirety.

419
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,670
If you look at free expression and
free speech laws around the world,

420
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,893
they're not absolute.

421
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,291
They're not.

422
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:08,710
Absolutely.

423
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,890
There's always limitations on what you
can say and it's when you're starting to

424
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:12,760
endanger other people.

425
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,990
So my question then is when I was
physically threatened on Twitter,

426
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
you guys refuse to take down the tweet
and I showed up in Berkeley and someone

427
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:22,600
physically threatened me
because they were encouraged to,

428
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:26,200
when I was in Venezuela I was physically
threatened by high profile individual,

429
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,480
10,000 people tweeting at me.

430
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:28,314
You guys do nothing.

431
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:28,781
Right?

432
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:32,620
So I guess there's the obvious question
of why does it always feel like your

433
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:35,860
policies are going one direction
politically you say it's about behavior.

434
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,970
You said it several times already,

435
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,691
but I've already,

436
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:41,470
I've got tons of examples of that not
being the case and you will always be able

437
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:42,470
to find those examples.

438
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:46,690
Examples where you guys were alerted
multiple times and did nothing.

439
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
Like when Antifa docs,

440
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,930
a bunch of law enforcement agents,

441
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,460
some of the tweets were removed,

442
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,510
but since September,

443
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,890
this tweet is still live with a list
of private phone numbers addresses yet

444
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:57,724
Kathy Griffin,

445
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,283
she's fine.

446
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,530
The guy who threatened the lives of
these kids in Covington and said,

447
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,640
lock him in school and burn it down.

448
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,474
You did nothing.

449
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,400
I mean he got suspended
it take his tweets down.

450
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,230
Was he banned for threatening
the lives of kids?

451
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,064
Absolutely not.

452
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,181
There again,

453
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:10,830
we have an,

454
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,120
um,

455
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm happy to talk about all these details.

456
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:17,800
We have our policies that are meant to
protect people and are meant to enable

457
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:20,230
free expression as long as you're
not trying to silence somebody else.

458
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:24,100
Now we take a variety of different
enforcement mechanisms around that.

459
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,450
Sometimes you get warned,

460
00:13:25,451 --> 00:13:26,260
sometimes we were,

461
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,700
your tweet is forced to be deleted.

462
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:31,870
It's a very rare occasion where we will
outright suspend someone without any

463
00:13:31,871 --> 00:13:36,280
sort of warning or any sort of
ability to understand what happened.

464
00:13:36,281 --> 00:13:39,130
What did you guys do with Kathy Griffin
when she was saying she wanted the names

465
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,740
of those young kids
were in the maggot hat.

466
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,280
So the Covington high school counts.

467
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:43,670
That's all right.

468
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,411
That's a great example,

469
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:44,980
Joe.

470
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,270
So in that particular case,

471
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:46,631
you know,

472
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:50,800
our doxing policy really focuses
on posting private information,

473
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,600
which we don't consider
names to be private.

474
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,520
We consider your home address,

475
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,240
your home phone,

476
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,070
your home phone number or
your mobile phone number,

477
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,540
those types of things to be private.

478
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,010
So in that particular case we took what
I think now is probably a very literal

479
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:06,910
interpretation of our policy and said
that that was not a doxing incident.

480
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,960
Do you think that was an error?

481
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,770
I think that it was shortsighted and
given the context of what was going on

482
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:12,940
there that um,

483
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,920
if I was doing this all over again,

484
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,160
I would probably ask my team to look at
that through the lens of what was the

485
00:14:18,161 --> 00:14:19,300
purpose behind that tweet.

486
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,340
And if the purpose was in fact to identify
these kids to either docs them are

487
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:23,681
abusing,

488
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:24,221
harass them,

489
00:14:24,221 --> 00:14:25,270
which it probably was,

490
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,970
then we should be taking
a more expansive view of,

491
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,370
of that policy and including
that type of content.

492
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,190
Especially considering
the fact they're minors.

493
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:32,980
Exactly.

494
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,970
Right away though.

495
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,660
Exactly.

496
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,493
The approach.

497
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,560
So this is a trial and error sort of learn
and move on with new information sort

498
00:14:40,871 --> 00:14:41,260
of a deal.

499
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,861
Absolutely.

500
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:42,611
We're gonna learn,

501
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:43,780
we're gonna make a ton of mistakes.

502
00:14:43,781 --> 00:14:44,710
We're trying to do this,

503
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,100
uh,

504
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,070
with hundreds of millions of
accounts all around the world,

505
00:14:48,071 --> 00:14:49,060
numerous languages.

506
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,950
We're going to make
mistakes even if we get,

507
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,550
there will always be mistakes,

508
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:56,690
but we're hoping to learn from those and
to make ourselves better and to catch

509
00:14:56,691 --> 00:15:00,200
cases like Tim's or others where
we clearly may have made an error.

510
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:02,390
And I'm open to having those discussions.

511
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:02,900
I'm not,

512
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,210
I'm sorry Tim familiar
with your specific cases,

513
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,670
but I'd love to follow up with you and

514
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,320
you want to understand what it's like.

515
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,240
You want to pull it up.

516
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:11,990
So it's a,

517
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,830
B I t.

518
00:15:12,831 --> 00:15:13,131
Dot.

519
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,440
L Y slash Antifa tweet,

520
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,303
all lowercase.

521
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,420
This is also an evolution
in prioritization as well.

522
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:20,960
We're,

523
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,540
one of the things we've
come to recently is we do,

524
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,733
we do need to,

525
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,490
we do need to prioritize these efforts
both in terms of policy enforcement,

526
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:29,270
um,

527
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,650
how we're thinking about evolving them.

528
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,070
Um,

529
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,460
one of the things that we want to focus
on as number one is physical safety.

530
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,580
And this leads you immediately
to something like doxing.

531
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:42,670
And right now the only way we take action
on a docksin case is if it's reported

532
00:15:43,851 --> 00:15:44,630
or not.

533
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,170
What we want to move to is to be
able to recognize those in real time,

534
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:49,490
at least in the English language,

535
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,750
recognize those in real time through
our machine learning algorithms and take

536
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,550
the action before it has to report it.

537
00:15:55,551 --> 00:16:00,551
So we're focused purely right now on
going after a docksin cases with our

538
00:16:01,491 --> 00:16:03,350
algorithms so that we can be proactive.

539
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,770
That also requires a much more rigorous
appeals process to correct us when we're

540
00:16:09,381 --> 00:16:10,214
wrong,

541
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,250
but we think it's tightly scoped enough.

542
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,820
It impacts the most important thing,

543
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:15,230
which is someone's physical safety.

544
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,880
Once we learned from that,

545
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,580
we can really look at the,

546
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,760
the biggest issue with our system right
now is all the burden is placed upon the

547
00:16:22,761 --> 00:16:23,180
victim.

548
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,610
So we only act based on reports.

549
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,410
We don't have a lot of enforcement.

550
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,760
Um,

551
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,870
especially with,

552
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,040
with more of the more,

553
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:36,070
the more the take downs
that are run through machine
learning and deep learning.

554
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,830
But if,

555
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,790
if something is reported,

556
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:40,780
a human does review it eventually or
are there a series of reports that you'd

557
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:41,614
never get to?

558
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,490
There's,

559
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,900
there's probably reports we don't,

560
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,600
I mean we prioritize a queue
based on severity and the city.

561
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,371
The thing that Walmart,

562
00:16:48,371 --> 00:16:51,260
mark severity is something like physical
safety or private information or

563
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:51,550
whatnot.

564
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,820
So generally we try to
get through everything,

565
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,030
but we have to prioritize
that cue even coming in.

566
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,761
So if,

567
00:16:57,761 --> 00:17:00,020
if someone threatened the
lives of someone else,

568
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,410
you would,

569
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,430
would you band that account?

570
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,600
Would you tell them like,

571
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,850
like let's say someone
tweeted three times,

572
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,380
kill these people,

573
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:08,360
I want them dead three times.

574
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,200
Is that,

575
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,940
yes.

576
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,220
You didn't,

577
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,400
you didn't abandon him though that up,

578
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,280
Jamie.

579
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,900
That's a,

580
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't know.

581
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,571
I don't,

582
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:18,230
I don't necessarily want to give out
specific usernames because they're not,

583
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,430
people just point the
finger at me and saying,

584
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:20,660
I'm getting these people band.

585
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,410
But yeah.

586
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:21,561
You know,

587
00:17:21,561 --> 00:17:22,310
during Covington,

588
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,410
this guy said multiple times too.

589
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,390
He wanted his followers
to go and kill these kids.

590
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,200
Yeah.

591
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,070
And we have to look at that.

592
00:17:28,071 --> 00:17:29,630
But we also have look in the context,

593
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,590
cause we also have,

594
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,660
I think we talked about this a
little bit in the last podcast,

595
00:17:32,661 --> 00:17:33,480
but we,

596
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,300
we have gamers on the platform who are
saying exactly that to their friends that

597
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:40,220
they're going to meet at the
game in the game tonight.

598
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,920
And without the context
of that relationship,

599
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,870
with the context of the
conversation that we're having,

600
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,300
we would take the exact same action on,

601
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,500
on them incorrectly.

602
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,603
Yeah.

603
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:50,581
That I,

604
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:51,450
that I understand.

605
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,310
I think in the case of Covington though,

606
00:17:53,311 --> 00:17:55,290
this user was so high profile,

607
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,730
he's a verified user.

608
00:17:56,731 --> 00:18:00,090
He's got something like 20,000 followers
and it was highlighted by numerous

609
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:01,530
conservative media outlets saying,

610
00:18:01,531 --> 00:18:01,711
wow,

611
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:02,300
this guys,

612
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,041
it screenshot it.

613
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:03,874
It's being shared.

614
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,980
I mean you had a Disney producer like
saying a picture of a wood chipper with a

615
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:10,170
body being thrown in at saying
that's what you want it to happen.

616
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:10,950
You know.

617
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,291
So I,

618
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,900
I do know that some of
these accounts got locked.

619
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,190
Producer was doing that.

620
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:14,490
That.

621
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:14,960
Well,

622
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,180
I'll,

623
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,800
I'll clarify fact check me on that.

624
00:18:16,801 --> 00:18:17,460
But that's the,

625
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,200
basically the conversation
that was had it,

626
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:19,770
there's a guy,

627
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,491
Disney was,

628
00:18:20,491 --> 00:18:23,430
he posted a picture of from Fargo of
someone being tossed in a wood chipper and

629
00:18:23,431 --> 00:18:23,671
he says,

630
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:24,990
I want all these Maga kids,

631
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,883
you know,

632
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,820
done like this.

633
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,390
You had another guy who specifically
said lock them in the school,

634
00:18:30,391 --> 00:18:31,200
burn it down,

635
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
set a bunch of disparaging things and
then said if you see them fire on that

636
00:18:34,201 --> 00:18:35,370
many tweeted that more than once

637
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,830
and that those accounts where
those tweets were taken down,

638
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,300
those were violations of our rules.

639
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:39,871
That's,

640
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:41,430
I'm pretty sure it's
actually illegal to do that.

641
00:18:41,431 --> 00:18:41,850
Right.

642
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:42,451
It's to,

643
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:42,691
to,

644
00:18:42,691 --> 00:18:43,240
to tell,

645
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,910
to tell you or any individual to
commit a felony is a crime like,

646
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,500
right.

647
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:48,770
Yeah.

648
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:51,320
Incitement of violence in many places.

649
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:52,640
I just have to wonder how,

650
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,350
like I understand the context issue,

651
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,940
but this is what,

652
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,660
this is what I talk,

653
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,670
what other context and scale too though.

654
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,180
Right.

655
00:18:59,180 --> 00:18:59,521
That's him.

656
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:00,890
Those accounts were actioned.

657
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,900
They may not have been action
the way you want it to,

658
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:03,460
but the,

659
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:06,890
the tweets were forced to be
deleted and the account were shorts.

660
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,630
I can penalty for that.

661
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,770
So I understand that.

662
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,730
What kind of a penalty?

663
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,280
Well,

664
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:11,721
again,

665
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:12,680
as I said it earlier,

666
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,011
Joe,

667
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:13,580
we don't,

668
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:13,880
uh,

669
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,713
usually,

670
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,111
uh,

671
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,960
automatically suspend accounts with
one violation because we want people to

672
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:18,380
learn.

673
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,320
We want people to understand what they
did wrong and give them an opportunity

674
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,190
not to do it again.

675
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:22,490
Right?

676
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,000
And it's,

677
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,340
it's a big thing to kick
someone off the platform.

678
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,151
And I take that very,

679
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:26,840
very seriously.

680
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,081
So,

681
00:19:27,081 --> 00:19:31,220
so I want to make sure that
when someone violates our rules,

682
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:34,100
they understand what happened and
they're given an opportunity to,

683
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,580
you know,

684
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,740
get back on the platform
and change their behavior.

685
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,720
And so in many of these cases,

686
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:42,440
what happens is we will force someone
to acknowledge that their tweet violated

687
00:19:42,441 --> 00:19:43,040
our rules,

688
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,220
forced them to delete that tweet before
they can get back on the platform.

689
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,510
And in,

690
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:48,380
in many cases,

691
00:19:48,381 --> 00:19:49,191
if they do it again,

692
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,024
we give them a timeout,

693
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,140
which is like seven days.

694
00:19:51,141 --> 00:19:51,501
When we say,

695
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:52,040
look,

696
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,873
you've done it again.

697
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,260
It's a temporary suspension.

698
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:55,123
If you do it again,

699
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:55,983
you're a mom.

700
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,350
I'm totally a mom.

701
00:19:57,351 --> 00:19:58,184
Exactly.

702
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,530
And your mom too.

703
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,610
And if you do it again then you're done.

704
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:01,851
Right.

705
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:02,840
So it's kind of like,

706
00:20:02,841 --> 00:20:03,141
you know,

707
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:03,890
three strikes.

708
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,060
So it's sort of like baseball.

709
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,970
And so in some of these
cases at Tim's referencing,

710
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,740
I have to imagine because
the streets weren't deleted,

711
00:20:09,741 --> 00:20:11,150
they are violations of our rules.

712
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,570
People are upset that the account came
back again and was allowed to say other

713
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:14,931
things.

714
00:20:14,931 --> 00:20:16,970
But we did take action on those tweets.

715
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,020
They were violations of it.

716
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:21,830
And then you have people like Milo who
was mean to a person and you delete,

717
00:20:21,831 --> 00:20:23,060
you banned him permanently.

718
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,980
There's more than I actually Tim,

719
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:25,731
let's talk about it.

720
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:26,060
Yeah,

721
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,231
yeah.

722
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:26,420
I'm,

723
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:29,570
I'm happy to talk about Milo
and actually brought the tweets.

724
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,071
It can also,

725
00:20:30,071 --> 00:20:30,491
so let's,

726
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:31,810
let's preface that by saying,

727
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,690
the point I want to make sure is clear
is that you had somebody who actively

728
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,770
called for the death of people.

729
00:20:35,771 --> 00:20:36,910
I understand the context issue.

730
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,080
Maybe he's talking about video games,

731
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,923
probably the some scale.

732
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,760
And scale.

733
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,990
So this is a verified user

734
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,960
and that's just the complexity
and enacting not an excuse
for why we don't do it

735
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,040
in a particular writer.

736
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,590
And then

737
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:48,801
there,

738
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:49,960
there are a lot of other examples too.

739
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,960
They get into more
egregious areas that I've,

740
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,541
I've prepared.

741
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,060
So here we have someone
with over 20,000 followers.

742
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:59,740
He's verified numerous times insights
his followers to commit a crime against

743
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:00,574
these kids.

744
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:03,340
The action taken against
him is delete the tweets.

745
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,031
You get a suspension,

746
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:04,864
you get time out.

747
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,260
Then you have people like Alex Jones
who be rated a CNN reporter permanently

748
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:08,501
banned.

749
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:09,430
You get Milo Yiannopoulos.

750
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:10,570
He was mean permanently banned.

751
00:21:10,571 --> 00:21:11,530
That that's your impression.

752
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,520
That's not what happened.

753
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,220
Okay,

754
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,053
let's,

755
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,913
let's,

756
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,700
let's play,

757
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,200
let's do this one at a time.

758
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,280
Let's start with Milo.

759
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,870
What was the details with Milo?

760
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,710
Milo had a number of tweets that violated,

761
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:27,270
our rule has gone back to 2014 but I'm
going to talk about the final three and

762
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,630
this three snakes concept.

763
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,590
Um,

764
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:33,250
he claimed to be a buzzfeed
reporter and his bio.

765
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:33,880
Um,

766
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,910
and he's a verified accounts
that is impersonation.

767
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,050
I'm not sure why he did that.

768
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,093
He did do that.

769
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,870
We'll buzzfeed's a left wing thing.

770
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:43,030
So he was doing parody a potentially,

771
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:46,150
but our party rules are very specific
that if you have an account that's mean

772
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,790
being,

773
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,320
uh,

774
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,160
is a parody account,

775
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:49,890
you need to say that it
is a parody accounts.

776
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,950
People,

777
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,640
everybody who knows Milo would know
that he's not a buzz feed reporter.

778
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,050
That people who don't know Milo,

779
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,780
we'll look at that
verified account and say,

780
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,640
but he wasn't verified after awhile.

781
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,020
You removed as verification.

782
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:03,850
He violated our rules around verification.

783
00:22:03,851 --> 00:22:05,030
So the vowel,

784
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,410
the verification was removed
because of the buzzfeed thing.

785
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,270
I believe so.

786
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,640
I can,

787
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,421
I can confirm them.

788
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,254
Could I believe so.

789
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:13,390
He also a docked someone,

790
00:22:13,391 --> 00:22:14,290
he posted,

791
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:14,650
um,

792
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:17,110
private information about an individual.

793
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,430
So that was the second one.

794
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,710
He tweeted to somebody else.

795
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,583
Um,

796
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,050
if you are my child,

797
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,420
I'd have dashed your head
on a rock and try it again,

798
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,770
which we viewed as a threat.

799
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,833
Really.

800
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:30,440
That's,

801
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,470
I'm seems like he's saying like,

802
00:22:32,471 --> 00:22:33,970
your mom should have swallowed you.

803
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,661
You know,

804
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:35,494
it's like,

805
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,221
you know what I'm saying?

806
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:36,581
He's like,

807
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:36,890
you're,

808
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,020
you're a mistake.

809
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:38,801
I'll take that.

810
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,634
That's a threat.

811
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,640
I understand why reasonable people
would have different impressions.

812
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,610
I'm just going through and telling you
what they are just so we can have all the

813
00:22:45,611 --> 00:22:47,560
facts on the table and
then we can debate them.

814
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,030
And then the last one,

815
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,950
we found a bunch of things that he
posted that we've viewed as incitement of

816
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,720
abuse against Leslie Jones.

817
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,950
So there's a bunch of them.

818
00:22:56,951 --> 00:23:01,951
But the one that I like to look at in
which really convinced me is he posted to

819
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:05,080
doctor tweets that were
supposedly by Leslie Jones.

820
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:05,920
They were fake tweets.

821
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,110
Um,

822
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,200
the first one said,

823
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,820
white people are getting on my nerves.

824
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,830
Like how can you call yourself human?

825
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,410
And then the second one said,

826
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,670
the God damn a slur for a Jewish
person at Sony ain't paid me yet.

827
00:23:21,941 --> 00:23:25,420
Damn bics nude better pay up.

828
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,160
This was just a fake tweet that
someone had photo-shopped two for two,

829
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,460
two fake tweets.

830
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,550
And we know they were faked because we
could still tell from the software and

831
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,393
they were faked,

832
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,370
can't always tell.

833
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,290
So it is possible that he
didn't know they were faked.

834
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,530
It's possible someone send it to him
and he didn't do his due diligence and

835
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:45,980
looking it

836
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,570
up.

837
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,231
It is possible.

838
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:50,260
But it was pointed out to him that
they were fake because he left it on.

839
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,870
And not only did he leave it on,

840
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,540
he said,

841
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,970
don't tell me some mischievous intranet.

842
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:56,200
Rascal made them up.

843
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,130
Exclamation point.

844
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,380
So this and the context of a bunch of
other things he was saying towards Leslie

845
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,213
Jones on Twitter,

846
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,740
I and my team felt that this was taken
as a whole incitement of harassment

847
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:09,280
against her.

848
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,020
Wasn't there another issue with multiple
accounts that were connected to him?

849
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,140
Uh,

850
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,990
there were a bunch of other
issues on the background,

851
00:24:17,991 --> 00:24:21,620
but these are the three primary
things that we looked at in terms of,

852
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,340
but the other things that
were in the background,

853
00:24:23,341 --> 00:24:27,480
weren't they multiple accounts
that were connected to him?

854
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:28,180
Like

855
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,050
I think that I'm,

856
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,100
I'm not sure about that.

857
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,431
Uh,

858
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:30,940
Joe,

859
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,110
I think it was more that we found him to
be engaging in coordinated behavior and

860
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:36,790
inciting people to,

861
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,260
to attack Leslie Jones.

862
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:40,620
Now with a case like him?

863
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:40,981
No,

864
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:41,880
I'm just going to be honest.

865
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:45,630
When I'm listening to those or
listening to read those tweets out,

866
00:24:45,631 --> 00:24:46,680
they don't sound that bad.

867
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:50,020
And they certainly don't sound as bad as
calling for the death of a child who's

868
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,940
wearing a maggot hat.

869
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:54,690
Throw him into a woodshop or the fact
that that guy is still out there tweeting

870
00:24:54,691 --> 00:24:57,990
and yet Milo's not Milo's initial,

871
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,180
the whole thing stemmed from,

872
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:01,380
other than the buzzfeed thing,

873
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:04,350
stemmed from his legitimate
criticism of a film.

874
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,251
And he's,

875
00:25:05,251 --> 00:25:05,551
you know,

876
00:25:05,551 --> 00:25:07,020
he's a satirist.

877
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,370
He was mocking this film.

878
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,520
The doxing incident
wasn't related to doxing.

879
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,370
Yeah.

880
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,203
Why don't we,

881
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,600
why don't we stop?

882
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,290
We all agree that doxing,

883
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:17,660
if something that Twitter
should take action 100%,

884
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:18,020
right?

885
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,220
Yeah.

886
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,790
Because frightened people in real life.

887
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:24,590
And I take an enormous
amount of responsibility for
that because I fear daily

888
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:27,890
for the things that are happening on the
platform that are translating into the

889
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:28,520
real world.

890
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,310
So,

891
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,140
uh,

892
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,380
Milo is a contentious figure and there
are certainly things you can pull up that

893
00:25:33,381 --> 00:25:34,011
I wouldn't agree with.

894
00:25:34,011 --> 00:25:34,731
Anything he did there.

895
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:35,840
I think those are horrible.

896
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,580
I think Joe brought up
some really good points,

897
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,930
but what about Chuck Johnson?

898
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:40,730
Why was Chuck Johnson Band?

899
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,400
I don't have those
details in front of me to,

900
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,480
Chuck Johnson said that he was preparing
something to take out d deray Mckesson,

901
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,550
and in the,

902
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,730
in a journalistic context,

903
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,790
people take this to me and he was going
to do a dossier or some kind of hit

904
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,530
piece on Deray is permanently banned.

905
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:55,641
And my understanding,

906
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,020
and it's been a long time
since I've read this,

907
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,280
there was some leaked emails,

908
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:01,070
I think from Dick Costolo where
he said maybe it wasn't deck.

909
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:01,791
I don't want to drag deck.

910
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:02,391
I don't know who it was,

911
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:03,051
exactly what they said.

912
00:26:03,051 --> 00:26:03,381
I don't care.

913
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:04,214
Just get rid of him.

914
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,720
And he was off.

915
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,010
So you have,

916
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,851
and again,

917
00:26:07,851 --> 00:26:09,410
maybe there's some hidden context there,

918
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:10,190
I don't know.

919
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,880
But on the surface,

920
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,050
the concern is that this is
always leaning towards the left.

921
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,351
Oh,

922
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:16,131
it absolutely is.

923
00:26:16,131 --> 00:26:16,570
And I'm,

924
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:16,901
I'm,

925
00:26:16,901 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm not even getting started.

926
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,083
Yeah,

927
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,040
I can understand why you feel that way.

928
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,060
I don't think that's true.

929
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:26,200
I think we look at each
individual instance of
violations of our rules and try

930
00:26:26,201 --> 00:26:27,550
to make the best case that we can.

931
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:27,880
Right.

932
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,510
Just not trying.

933
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:28,740
And I,

934
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,830
I do think Joe,

935
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:31,060
just to just to say,

936
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,600
I do think we've failed in
a couple of ways and I want,

937
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,570
I want to admit that.

938
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,020
Okay.

939
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,680
Number one,

940
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,860
we haven't done enough education about
what our roles are because a lot of

941
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:40,810
people violate our rules
and they don't even know it.

942
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,640
Like some of the statistics
that we've looked at,

943
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,420
like for a lot of first
time users of the platform,

944
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,830
if they violate the rule once,

945
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,960
almost two thirds of them
never violate the rules again.

946
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,750
So we're not talking about like
a bunch of people accidentally.

947
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:53,460
Like if they know what the rules are,

948
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,510
most people can avoid it.

949
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,950
And most people when they
feel the sting of a violation,

950
00:26:57,951 --> 00:26:58,161
they go,

951
00:26:58,161 --> 00:26:58,431
okay,

952
00:26:58,431 --> 00:26:59,960
I don't want to lose my rights to post.

953
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,750
Exactly.

954
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,080
And they're,

955
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:01,821
and they're able to do it.

956
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:05,000
So we have a lot of work to
do on education so people
really understand what the

957
00:27:05,001 --> 00:27:06,410
rules are in the first place.

958
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,890
The other thing we have to do to address
these allegations that were doing this

959
00:27:09,891 --> 00:27:14,891
from a bias perspective is to be really
clear about what types of behavior are

960
00:27:15,561 --> 00:27:17,360
caught by our rules
and what types are not,

961
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,950
and to be transparent within the product.

962
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:23,120
So when a particular tweet is a found
to be in violation of our rules being

963
00:27:23,121 --> 00:27:23,511
very,

964
00:27:23,511 --> 00:27:26,960
very clear like this wheat was found to
be in violation of this particular role

965
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,140
and that's all work that we're doing is
we think the combination of education

966
00:27:30,141 --> 00:27:32,000
and transparency is really important,

967
00:27:32,001 --> 00:27:34,010
particularly for an open
platform like Twitter.

968
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:34,710
It's,

969
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,490
it's just part of who we are and we
have to build it into the product.

970
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,391
I appreciate that.

971
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:42,260
Your particular thoughts though on
those examples that he described when he

972
00:27:42,261 --> 00:27:45,350
talking about someone saying they
should throw these children into a wood

973
00:27:45,351 --> 00:27:49,550
chipper versus Chuck Johnson
saying he should take this guy,

974
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:52,280
he wants to prepare a
dossier to take this guy out,

975
00:27:52,281 --> 00:27:53,114
or how did he say it?

976
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,110
He said something like,

977
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,970
I'm going to take out deray McKesson with,

978
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,330
he said,

979
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:57,460
I'm preparing to take out Derek,

980
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,071
something like that.

981
00:27:58,071 --> 00:27:58,904
I can't remember.

982
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:00,463
I can understand.

983
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,080
It could be misconstrued as he
was trying to assassinate him.

984
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:03,291
Right.

985
00:28:03,291 --> 00:28:03,570
You could,

986
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:04,580
you could misconstrue it that,

987
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,420
but not a direct threat.

988
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,950
But the other one's a direct threat.

989
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,630
One guy has banned for life,

990
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,493
the other guy is still

991
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,420
posted and we can,

992
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,500
I'm happy to follow up.

993
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:11,721
I was,

994
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:12,840
you don't have all the Chuck Johnson.

995
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,990
It's not about one thing.

996
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:14,500
As I said,

997
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,070
it's about a pattern and practice
of violating our rules and we,

998
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,900
we don't want to kick
someone off for one thing,

999
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,450
but if there's a pattern in
practice like there was from Milo,

1000
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:25,990
we are going to have to take action at
some point because we can't sit back and

1001
00:28:25,991 --> 00:28:27,160
let people be abusing,

1002
00:28:27,161 --> 00:28:28,650
harassed and silenced on the cloud.

1003
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:28,871
Well,

1004
00:28:28,871 --> 00:28:29,150
so,

1005
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:33,040
so one really important thing that
needs to be stated is that Twitter by

1006
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:35,950
definition is a biased platform
in favor of the left period.

1007
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:36,161
It's not,

1008
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:36,791
it's not a question.

1009
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:38,530
I understand you might have
your own interpretation,

1010
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,633
but it's very simple.

1011
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,760
Conservatives do not agree with you
on the definition of mis-gendering.

1012
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,360
If you have a rule in place that
specifically adheres to the left ideology,

1013
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,810
you by default are enforcing
rules from a biased perspective.

1014
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,171
Well,

1015
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:50,650
Tim,

1016
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,110
there are a lot of people on the left
who don't agree with how we're doing our

1017
00:28:53,111 --> 00:28:56,520
job either for sure and those people
think that we don't take enough action on

1018
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:59,110
it and are Rasman and then we
left far too much behavior go.

1019
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,290
That's a radical example though.

1020
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,460
I mean what he's talking about,

1021
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,080
I mean in terms of generalities,

1022
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,140
the in general things lean far more left.

1023
00:29:07,141 --> 00:29:07,980
Would you agree with that?

1024
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,300
I don't know what that means,

1025
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,090
but in this particular case it's
how the speech is being used.

1026
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:17,220
This is a new vector of attack that people
have felt that I don't want to be on

1027
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:20,730
this platform anymore because I'm being
harassed and abused and I need to get

1028
00:29:20,731 --> 00:29:21,160
the hell out.

1029
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,770
What people harassed and
abused me all day and night.

1030
00:29:22,771 --> 00:29:23,760
You don't do anything about that.

1031
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:25,880
I,

1032
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,060
I,

1033
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,260
my,

1034
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,530
my,

1035
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,130
my notifications permanently locked
at 99 you have a worse than I do.

1036
00:29:29,131 --> 00:29:32,610
I mean you got substantially
more followers and I don't
click the notification

1037
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,740
tab anymore because it's
basically just harassment.

1038
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,240
And I even when,

1039
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,710
so this is a really funny anecdote,

1040
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,980
I was covering a story in Berkeley
and someone said if you see him

1041
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:43,420
attack him like it was,

1042
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:43,661
it was,

1043
00:29:43,661 --> 00:29:44,321
I'm paraphrasing,

1044
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,150
they said basically to swing at me,

1045
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,100
take my stuff,

1046
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,003
steal from me,

1047
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,350
and Twitter told me after review,

1048
00:29:50,351 --> 00:29:51,790
it was not a violation of their policy.

1049
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,220
Somebody made an illusion to me being a
homosexual and I reported that instantly

1050
00:29:57,221 --> 00:29:58,030
gone.

1051
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:58,863
So when I shot,

1052
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,170
so,

1053
00:29:59,170 --> 00:29:59,921
so for me I'm looking,

1054
00:29:59,921 --> 00:30:00,161
I'm like,

1055
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:00,820
well of course,

1056
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,720
of course Twitter is going to enforce
the social justice aspect of their policy

1057
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,583
immediately,

1058
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,191
in my opinion,

1059
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:09,190
probably because you guys have a PR
constraints and you're probably nervous

1060
00:30:09,191 --> 00:30:10,024
about that.

1061
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,340
But when someone actually threatens
me with a crime and insights,

1062
00:30:12,341 --> 00:30:15,010
their followers to do it and nothing got
done and I'm not the only one who feels

1063
00:30:15,011 --> 00:30:15,280
that way.

1064
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,350
Well Tim pessimistic.

1065
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,720
If someone acts in that manner
and threatens to hurt you,

1066
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,040
that's a violation of our rules.

1067
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,340
Right?

1068
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:25,220
Maybe there was a mistake there and I'm
happy to go and correct that and we can

1069
00:30:25,221 --> 00:30:28,190
do it offline so we don't fear
any sort of reprisal against you.

1070
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,540
But that's a mistake.

1071
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,570
That's not an agenda on my
part or on the team spark.

1072
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,540
Would this be any PR constraints?

1073
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:36,580
That is not.

1074
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,030
So why did you ban Alex Jones?

1075
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,440
Can we get out of that?

1076
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,273
You want to get into that?

1077
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:40,850
Absolutely.

1078
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:41,241
Are you ready?

1079
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:41,780
For sure.

1080
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,530
All alright.

1081
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,500
Oh I've been ready for

1082
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,833
um,

1083
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,391
well let,

1084
00:30:47,391 --> 00:30:47,471
let,

1085
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:47,580
let,

1086
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,021
let me say this.

1087
00:30:48,021 --> 00:30:49,520
The reason I bring him up is that Oliver,

1088
00:30:49,521 --> 00:30:50,354
Darcy,

1089
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:54,860
one of the lead reporters covering Alex
Jones in his content set on CNN that it

1090
00:30:54,861 --> 00:30:58,010
was only after media pressure did
these social networks take action.

1091
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,340
So that's why I bring him up specifically
cause it sort of implies you are under

1092
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,050
PR constraints to get rid of him.

1093
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,860
I think if you look at the Pr,

1094
00:31:04,861 --> 00:31:06,450
that's what her went
through and that incident,

1095
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,200
it wouldn't be that we looked good in it.

1096
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:08,641
You have to,

1097
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:10,590
and that's not at all
why we took action on it.

1098
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,300
Sorry.

1099
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:15,960
You'll have to look at the full context
on the spectrum here because one of the

1100
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:20,961
things that happened over a weekend
is what Alex mentioned on your,

1101
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,380
on your podcast with him.

1102
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,250
He was removed from the
Itunes podcast directory.

1103
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,510
That was the,

1104
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
that was the linchpin
for him because it it,

1105
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,720
it drove all the traffic to what he said.

1106
00:31:33,721 --> 00:31:38,721
Basically zero immediately after
that we saw our peer companies,

1107
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,870
Facebook,

1108
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,710
Spotify,

1109
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,450
Youtube also take action.

1110
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:43,733
We did not,

1111
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,350
we did not because we,

1112
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:49,710
when we looked at our service and we
looked at the reports on their service,

1113
00:31:49,711 --> 00:31:52,530
we did not find anything
in violation of our rules.

1114
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:58,370
Then we got into a situation where
suddenly a bunch of people were reporting

1115
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,860
content on our platform,

1116
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,570
including CNN who wrote an article about
all the things that might violate our

1117
00:32:06,571 --> 00:32:07,050
rooms,

1118
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:12,050
rules that we looked into and we gave
him one of the other warnings and then we

1119
00:32:12,841 --> 00:32:14,370
can get into the actual details.

1120
00:32:14,371 --> 00:32:14,970
But yeah,

1121
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,320
we did not follow,

1122
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:16,861
we,

1123
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:21,861
we resisted just being like a domino with
our peers because it wasn't consistent

1124
00:32:22,411 --> 00:32:26,460
with our rules in the contract
we put in before our customers.

1125
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,530
So what was it that made you ban them?

1126
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,350
So there were three separate incidents
that came to our attention after the

1127
00:32:32,351 --> 00:32:33,184
fact,

1128
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,371
uh,

1129
00:32:33,371 --> 00:32:34,660
that were reported to us by,

1130
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,710
by different users.

1131
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:36,550
Uh,

1132
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:40,880
there was a video that was uploaded that
showed a child's being violently thrown

1133
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:41,990
to the ground and crying.

1134
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,040
So that was the first one.

1135
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,350
The second one was a video that we
viewed as incitement of violence.

1136
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,490
I can read it to you.

1137
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:49,791
It's a,

1138
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,391
sure it's a little,

1139
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:51,620
it's a little bit of a transcripts,

1140
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:51,950
but,

1141
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:52,783
um,

1142
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,790
but now it's time to act on the
enemy before they do a false flag.

1143
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,820
I know that Justice Department's crippled
a bunch of followers and cowards,

1144
00:32:58,821 --> 00:32:59,421
but there's groups,

1145
00:32:59,421 --> 00:32:59,901
there's grants,

1146
00:32:59,901 --> 00:33:00,734
juries,

1147
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,040
there's,

1148
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,731
you called for it.

1149
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,121
It's time,

1150
00:33:02,121 --> 00:33:02,601
politically,

1151
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:06,350
economically and judiciously and legally
and criminally to move against these

1152
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:06,800
people.

1153
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,060
It's got to be dumb now.

1154
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:08,961
Get together.

1155
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:09,351
The people,

1156
00:33:09,351 --> 00:33:09,681
you know,

1157
00:33:09,681 --> 00:33:10,311
aren't traders,

1158
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:10,970
aren't cowards,

1159
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,320
aren't helping their frickin bats,

1160
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,810
hedging their fucking bets like
all these other assholes do.

1161
00:33:14,811 --> 00:33:15,321
And let's go,

1162
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:16,154
let's do it.

1163
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,100
So people need to have there and
then there's a bunch of other stuff,

1164
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:19,820
but at the end,

1165
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:22,640
so people need to have their battle
rifles ready and everything ready at their

1166
00:33:22,641 --> 00:33:25,910
bedsides and you've gotta be ready because
the media is so disciplined in their

1167
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:26,744
deception.

1168
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,630
So this is you're,

1169
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,610
you're saying that this is a call
to violence against the media.

1170
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,250
That's what it sounded
like to us at the time.

1171
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,400
And there've been a number of incidents
of violence against the media.

1172
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,001
And again,

1173
00:33:38,001 --> 00:33:40,760
I take my responsibility for what
happens on the platform and how that

1174
00:33:40,761 --> 00:33:42,950
translates off platform very seriously.

1175
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,590
And that felt like it was
an incitement to violence.

1176
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:48,230
If he only tweeted the incitement
to violence would have been fine.

1177
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,670
If he only treats only tweeted that
trans posted that transcript saying,

1178
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:53,990
get your battle rifles ready,

1179
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,040
you wouldn't have deleted his account.

1180
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,480
I,

1181
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:55,850
again,

1182
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:56,840
context matters to him.

1183
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,980
It's not about one thing.

1184
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,320
So we'd have to look at the
entire context of what's going on.

1185
00:34:00,321 --> 00:34:01,154
So I'm asking was that,

1186
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,680
was that agregious enough
for you to say that alone?

1187
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,410
That wasn't,

1188
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,930
that wasn't there was one number two.

1189
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,201
Right,

1190
00:34:06,201 --> 00:34:06,381
right.

1191
00:34:06,381 --> 00:34:09,260
So then I guess the question is what
was the video context of the kid being

1192
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:10,070
thrown to the ground?

1193
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,120
Was it newsworthy?

1194
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,750
We obviously didn't think so in depicting
violence against the child is not

1195
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:16,550
something that we would
allow on the platform,

1196
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,720
even if it's a news content.

1197
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:18,321
Um,

1198
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:19,170
if it was a,

1199
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,520
there are certain types of situations
where if you were reporting on,

1200
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,150
um,

1201
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,620
you know,

1202
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,580
war zone and,

1203
00:34:24,581 --> 00:34:25,670
and things that might be happening,

1204
00:34:25,671 --> 00:34:29,270
we would put an interstitial on that type
of content that's graphic or violent.

1205
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,520
But we didn't feel that
that was the context here.

1206
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,160
Well,

1207
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,520
there's a video that's been going around
that was going around a few four or

1208
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:36,181
five weeks ago,

1209
00:34:36,181 --> 00:34:36,901
the one where the,

1210
00:34:36,901 --> 00:34:40,080
the girls were yelling at that big giant
guy and the guy punched that girl in

1211
00:34:40,081 --> 00:34:41,670
the face and she was like 11 years old.

1212
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,100
I saw that multiple times on Twitter.

1213
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,290
That was one of the most violent
things that we're seeing.

1214
00:34:46,291 --> 00:34:50,010
This giant man punched this
11 year old girl in the face.

1215
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,780
And that was,

1216
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,060
was that removed from Twitter?

1217
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:53,860
I don't know.

1218
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,140
I would have to go see if
anyone reported it to us.

1219
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,990
I think one of the issues here is too is,

1220
00:34:59,230 --> 00:34:59,441
you know,

1221
00:34:59,441 --> 00:35:00,730
you do you want me to
get to the third one?

1222
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,053
The third strike,

1223
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,890
um,

1224
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:08,500
we looked at was a verbal altercation
that Alex got into with a journalist.

1225
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,060
And in that altercation there were,

1226
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,440
which was uploaded to Twitter.

1227
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,130
Um,

1228
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,130
there were a number of
statements using eyes of the rat,

1229
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,990
even more evil looking in person.

1230
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:17,920
He's just scum.

1231
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:21,730
You're a virus to America and freedom
smelling like a possum that climbed out of

1232
00:35:21,731 --> 00:35:23,620
the rear end of a dead cow.

1233
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,530
You look like a possum that
got caught doing some really,

1234
00:35:26,531 --> 00:35:27,820
really nasty stuff in my view.

1235
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,470
So it was a bunch of,

1236
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,940
that's really,

1237
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:31,810
that's hilarious.

1238
00:35:31,811 --> 00:35:32,591
Pattern and practice.

1239
00:35:32,591 --> 00:35:35,610
But it was a verbal altercation
that was posted on our classrooms.

1240
00:35:35,611 --> 00:35:36,444
So,

1241
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:41,170
so we took the totality of this having
been warned that we have rules against

1242
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,990
abuse and harassment of individuals.

1243
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:44,940
We saw this pattern in practice,

1244
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,141
one strike,

1245
00:35:46,141 --> 00:35:46,650
two strike,

1246
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,430
three strikes and we made
a decision to promote.

1247
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,970
Last one was on periscope.

1248
00:35:50,971 --> 00:35:52,150
Is that what it was that he uh,

1249
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,070
broadcast through?

1250
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,010
Um,

1251
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:56,440
I think it was originally on periscope,

1252
00:35:56,441 --> 00:36:00,610
but it was also re posted from
multiple related accounts onto Twitter.

1253
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,230
So we can,

1254
00:36:03,231 --> 00:36:05,150
we can agree with you
when you say these things.

1255
00:36:05,151 --> 00:36:05,391
Like,

1256
00:36:05,391 --> 00:36:05,571
you know,

1257
00:36:05,571 --> 00:36:06,111
Alex said this,

1258
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:06,944
it sounds like a threat.

1259
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,870
He was berating this
person's saying awful things.

1260
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,700
But ultimately your
judgment is the contacts.

1261
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,970
You say we have to pay
attention to the context.

1262
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,070
We just trusting that you
made the right decision.

1263
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:16,990
Well,

1264
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,640
I'm,

1265
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,050
I'm giving you as much facts
as I can give your hair.

1266
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:25,051
And I think that this is the real hard
part of content moderation at scale on

1267
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:25,990
global platforms.

1268
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,550
It's not easy and I don't think jack
or I would tell you that it's easy.

1269
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:28,770
Yes.

1270
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:31,070
A imposturous volume do
you guys have to deal with?

1271
00:36:31,071 --> 00:36:33,770
And that's one of the things that I
wanted to get into with Jack when I first

1272
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:36,470
had them on because when my thought,

1273
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,160
and um,

1274
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,900
I wasn't as concerned about the
censorship as many people were,

1275
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:46,930
my main concern was what does it like
to start this thing that's kind of for

1276
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:48,014
fun?

1277
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,740
And then all of a sudden it becomes the
premier platform for free speech on the

1278
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:52,574
planet earth.

1279
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,533
So

1280
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,150
it is that,

1281
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:58,560
but it's also a platform that's used to
abuse and harass a lot of people and,

1282
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,030
and used in ways that none
of us want it to be used.

1283
00:37:01,031 --> 00:37:01,640
But nonetheless,

1284
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,473
it happens.

1285
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:05,200
And I think it's an enormously
complicated challenge,

1286
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,890
uh,

1287
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,560
for any company to do
content moderation at scale.

1288
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:12,190
And that's something that we are sitting
down thinking about how do we take this

1289
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,210
forward the future,

1290
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,430
because this is,

1291
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,263
it doesn't scale.

1292
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:15,521
Yeah.

1293
00:37:15,521 --> 00:37:15,720
So,

1294
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,110
so,

1295
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:16,471
so let's,

1296
00:37:16,471 --> 00:37:17,430
let's take the other context.

1297
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:17,681
Now we,

1298
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:18,511
we've heard what you said,

1299
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,880
why what Alex Jones did was bad
and now we can look at it this way.

1300
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,900
Oliver Darcy,

1301
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:23,610
who has on numerous occasions,

1302
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:25,380
insulted conservatives recently on CNN,

1303
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:30,240
called them gullible being sold red meat
by grifters repeatedly covers a story.

1304
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,820
I'm going to do air quotes because I
think to an extent he is allowed to cover

1305
00:37:32,821 --> 00:37:33,654
these stories.

1306
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,820
He keeps going after Alex Jones,

1307
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,170
he keeps digging through his history.

1308
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,730
Then he goes on TV and says,

1309
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:39,720
we got him banned.

1310
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,050
Then Alex Jones confronts him and a very
aggressive and mean way and that's your

1311
00:37:43,051 --> 00:37:46,440
justification for four or I
should say I invert the timeline.

1312
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,740
Basically you have someone who is
relentlessly digging through stuff,

1313
00:37:49,741 --> 00:37:50,574
insulting you,

1314
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,180
you know,

1315
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,370
calling you names Po ripper,

1316
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,300
sifting through your history,

1317
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:57,420
trying to find anything they can
to get you terminated going on TV,

1318
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:58,680
even writing numerous stories.

1319
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,070
You confront them and say you're evil
and you say a bunch of really awful mean

1320
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,530
things and then you,

1321
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,350
you bet him.

1322
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:04,590
Right?

1323
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,810
So when you post that
information all over the country,

1324
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,201
right?

1325
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:11,370
But you have a journalist who recently
went on TV and said Seapak is a bunch of

1326
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:14,010
gullible conservatives being
fed red meat by grifters.

1327
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,970
You can tell this guy's not got honesty,

1328
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:16,920
an anonymous agenda.

1329
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,630
So what you have it to me,

1330
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:21,720
it looks like the
Conservatives to an extent.

1331
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,630
Probably we'll try and mass
flag people on the left.

1332
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,170
But from an ideological
standpoint you have the actual,

1333
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:28,800
you know,

1334
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,880
whatever people want to call it.

1335
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,960
Sector of identitarian left that belief
free speech is a problem that have

1336
00:38:33,961 --> 00:38:36,220
literally showed up in Berkeley
burning free speech signs

1337
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,400
and then you have conservatives who
are tweeting mean things and the

1338
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,320
conservatives are less likely in,

1339
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,450
I think it's fair to point out,

1340
00:38:43,451 --> 00:38:46,480
less likely to try and get someone else
band because they like playing off them.

1341
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:47,620
And the left is,

1342
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,550
is targeting them.

1343
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:51,770
So you end up having disproportionate
a lot of assumptions in what you're

1344
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,240
saying.

1345
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,400
And I don't know what basis
you're saying those things.

1346
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,560
I mean you have conservatives demanding
free speech and you have liberals,

1347
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:57,850
uh,

1348
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,631
I shouldn't say liberals.

1349
00:38:58,631 --> 00:39:02,680
You have w w what people refer to as
the regressive left calling for the

1350
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,060
restrictions on speech.

1351
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:04,830
You have these,

1352
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:07,030
I don't know what those terms
mean to be honest with you.

1353
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,250
We have people on all sides of the
spectrum who believe in free speech and I,

1354
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:11,800
I believe that to be the case.

1355
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:15,280
So your platform restricts speech.

1356
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:20,320
Our platform promotes speech unless
people violate our rules and in a specific

1357
00:39:20,321 --> 00:39:21,154
direction,

1358
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,300
in any interaction.

1359
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,110
But uncle,

1360
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,241
oh,

1361
00:39:23,241 --> 00:39:24,070
I don't want to say his name.

1362
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,050
The guy who calls for
death gets a suspension.

1363
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,030
The guy who insinuates
that gets a permanent ban.

1364
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:31,750
You're misinterpreting what I'm
saying and I feel like you're doing it

1365
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:32,410
deliberately.

1366
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,030
It's not about one particular thing.

1367
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:37,570
It's about a pattern in
practice of violating a pattern
and practice of banning.

1368
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:41,770
Only one faction of people
recently published an article
where they looked at 22

1369
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:46,240
high profile bandings from 2015 and
found 21 of them were only on one side of

1370
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:47,074
the cultural debate,

1371
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:50,110
but I don't look at the political spectrum
of people and I'm looking at their

1372
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:50,510
tweets.

1373
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,670
You have a bias,

1374
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,440
your bias and your,

1375
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,380
you're targeting specific individuals
because your rule support this

1376
00:39:56,381 --> 00:39:57,130
perspective.

1377
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,810
No,

1378
00:39:57,810 --> 00:39:58,040
it,

1379
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,721
they don't agree with that.

1380
00:39:58,721 --> 00:39:59,290
Well,

1381
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,370
can you be clear though in like what
rules support that purse specifically?

1382
00:40:02,371 --> 00:40:02,691
The,

1383
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,240
the easiest one is mis-gendering,

1384
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,420
right?

1385
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:06,280
Because that's so clearly ideological.

1386
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:09,220
If you ask a conservative
what is mis-gendering,

1387
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:12,730
they'll say if someone is
biologically male and you call them,

1388
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:13,220
you know,

1389
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:15,710
she a biologic and me
and you called a mushy,

1390
00:40:15,711 --> 00:40:17,410
that's mis-gender gender
as a conservative view.

1391
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:17,620
The,

1392
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,040
the,

1393
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,870
the progressive view is inverted.

1394
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:25,380
So now you actually have in your
policies a rule against the conservative

1395
00:40:25,421 --> 00:40:26,230
perspective.

1396
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:30,490
I have a rule against the
abuse and harassment of
trans people on our platform.

1397
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,710
That's what my rule is.

1398
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:34,420
We just give context in the
background as to why the why that is.

1399
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,500
And I brought some,

1400
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,221
some research.

1401
00:40:36,221 --> 00:40:39,730
So we obviously received
a lot of feedback.

1402
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,410
So we don't make these roles in a vacuum.

1403
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,190
Just to be clear,

1404
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,030
we have a bunch of people all around the
world to give us context and the types

1405
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:47,110
of behavior they're seeing,

1406
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,690
how that translates into real world harm.

1407
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,710
And uh,

1408
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,130
they give us feedback and they tell us
like you should consider different types

1409
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:54,731
of rules,

1410
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,470
different types of perspectives,

1411
00:40:56,471 --> 00:40:57,130
different.

1412
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,851
Like for example,

1413
00:40:57,851 --> 00:41:01,360
when we try to enforce hateful conduct
in a are hateful conduct policy.

1414
00:41:01,361 --> 00:41:02,350
And in particular country,

1415
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,040
we are not going to know all of a slur
words that are used to target people of a

1416
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,620
particular race or a particular religion.

1417
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,330
So we're going to rely on building out
a team of experts all around the world

1418
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:15,250
who are going to help
us enforce our rules.

1419
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,310
So in the particular
case of m Ms Generating,

1420
00:41:18,311 --> 00:41:21,220
I'm just trying to pull up some
of the studies that we looked at,

1421
00:41:21,221 --> 00:41:22,010
but we looked at,

1422
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,450
um,

1423
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:27,220
the American Association of Pediatrics
and looked at the number of transgender

1424
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:29,500
youth that were committing suicide.

1425
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,580
It's an astronomical,

1426
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:30,941
I'm sorry,

1427
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,140
I can't find it right now in front of me.

1428
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:32,711
It's a really,

1429
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:34,070
really high statistic that's like 10

1430
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:37,160
times what the normal suicide
rate is of normal teenagers.

1431
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,800
And we looked at the causes
of what that was happening.

1432
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:42,740
And a lot of WWE was not just
violence towards those individuals,

1433
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:45,440
but it was bullying behavior and what was,

1434
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,560
what were those bullying behaviors
that were contributing to that.

1435
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:52,010
And that's why we made this
rule because we thought,

1436
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,080
and we believe that those types of
behaviors were happening on our platform.

1437
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,250
And we wanted to stop it.

1438
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,930
Now there are exceptions to this rule.

1439
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,010
We don't,

1440
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:01,760
and this is all,

1441
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,460
this isn't about like public figures
and there's always going to be public

1442
00:42:04,461 --> 00:42:06,890
figures that you're going to
want to talk about and that's,

1443
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,490
that's fine.

1444
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,970
But this is about are you doing something
with the intention of abusing and

1445
00:42:10,971 --> 00:42:14,780
harassing a trans person on the platform
and are they viewing it that way and

1446
00:42:14,781 --> 00:42:17,090
reporting it to us so that we take action.

1447
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,220
So I will just state,

1448
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,550
I actually agree with the
rule from my point of view.

1449
00:42:22,551 --> 00:42:25,430
I agree that bullying and harassing
Trans People's and higher,

1450
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,480
entirely wrong.

1451
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,343
I disagree with it,

1452
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,360
but I just want to make sure it's
clear to everybody who's listening.

1453
00:42:29,361 --> 00:42:30,590
My point is simply that,

1454
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,041
you know,

1455
00:42:31,041 --> 00:42:35,780
Ben Shapiro went on a talk show and
absolutely refused and that's his shtick.

1456
00:42:35,781 --> 00:42:36,021
You know,

1457
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,450
and he's one of the biggest
podcasts in the world.

1458
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,440
So if you have all of his millions upon
millions of followers who are looking at

1459
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:43,101
this rule saying,

1460
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:47,210
this goes against my view of the world
and it's literally 60 plus million in

1461
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:47,780
this country.

1462
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,290
You do have a rule that's
ideologically bent and it's,

1463
00:42:50,291 --> 00:42:50,721
it's true.

1464
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:51,190
You,

1465
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:51,951
you did the research,

1466
00:42:51,951 --> 00:42:52,880
you believe this,

1467
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,420
well then you have Ben Shapiro who did
his research and doesn't believe it.

1468
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:56,900
Yeah.

1469
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,020
And I relied on the American
Association of Pediatrics and,

1470
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:00,980
uh,

1471
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,250
you know,

1472
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,600
human rights council and other,

1473
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,070
and I'm sure he has his sources too,

1474
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:05,030
for when he gives his statements.

1475
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,300
The point is a bit of equally just
wonder if they have that context.

1476
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,320
I mean,

1477
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,621
that's,

1478
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,420
and that's where we have also,

1479
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:11,660
it's,

1480
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:11,980
it's,

1481
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,070
it's just explaining the
why behind a lot of reasons.

1482
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:17,240
I would agree.

1483
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,200
And I think it's fine.

1484
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,270
You did research and you
found this to be true,

1485
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:24,440
but we can't simply say maybe Ben Shapiro
and the other conservatives who feel

1486
00:43:24,441 --> 00:43:24,651
this way,

1487
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:25,484
don't know.

1488
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:26,390
We have to wait.

1489
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:27,110
We can't,

1490
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:27,590
you know,

1491
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:28,370
the point I'm trying to make is,

1492
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:28,521
it's,

1493
00:43:28,521 --> 00:43:29,800
it's simply whether you believe it,

1494
00:43:29,801 --> 00:43:30,140
what,

1495
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,760
whether you justified
or not is not the point.

1496
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:32,270
The point is,

1497
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:32,720
you do,

1498
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,590
you do have this rule.

1499
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:35,240
That rule is at odds with conservatives,

1500
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:35,870
period.

1501
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:36,051
Well,

1502
00:43:36,051 --> 00:43:36,980
I think I,

1503
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:37,880
I think that you're,

1504
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,200
you're generalizing,

1505
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,940
but I think it is really
important as Jack said,

1506
00:43:40,941 --> 00:43:42,620
to the why behind these things,

1507
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,500
the why as to protect people from abuse
and harassment on our platform and

1508
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:49,280
understand what you essentially
created a protected class.

1509
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,390
If this is the case,

1510
00:43:50,391 --> 00:43:54,050
because despite these
studies and what you know,

1511
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:59,051
the studies are showing there's a gigantic
suicide rate amongst trans people,

1512
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:00,524
period.

1513
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:04,520
It's a 40% it's an outrageously large now,

1514
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:09,170
whether that is because of
gender dysphoria with us
because of the complications

1515
00:44:09,171 --> 00:44:11,270
from sexual surgery,

1516
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:12,680
sexual transition surgery,

1517
00:44:12,681 --> 00:44:14,180
whether it's because of bullying,

1518
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:17,990
whether it's because of this awful
feeling of being born in the wrong gender,

1519
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:20,180
whether that all that
is yet to be determined.

1520
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:24,950
The fact that they've shown that there's
a large amount of trans people that are

1521
00:44:24,951 --> 00:44:25,784
committing suicide,

1522
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:29,600
I don't necessarily think that that makes,

1523
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,980
that makes sense in terms of

1524
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,050
people from someone's perspective,

1525
00:44:34,051 --> 00:44:38,460
like a Ben Shapiro saying that
if you are biologically female,

1526
00:44:38,490 --> 00:44:42,150
if you are born with
a double x chromosome,

1527
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,890
you will never be x,

1528
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:44,700
y.

1529
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,740
If he says that that's,

1530
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:49,620
that's a violation of
your policy and this is,

1531
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:52,140
you are creating a protected class

1532
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:52,930
to be,

1533
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:53,320
to be fair,

1534
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,170
targeted 30 saying it or,

1535
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,053
or targeting.

1536
00:44:57,370 --> 00:44:58,890
So express that opinion.

1537
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:02,490
So what if he said title to express that
opinion if he's doing it in a manner

1538
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,950
that's targeted at an
individual repeatedly,

1539
00:45:04,951 --> 00:45:05,401
repeatedly,

1540
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:06,120
repeatedly,

1541
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,953
and saying that,

1542
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,171
okay,

1543
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:07,670
but what about,

1544
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,503
what about,

1545
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,091
you know,

1546
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:09,730
what's going on with it?

1547
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:11,650
Martina Navratilova right now,

1548
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,280
Martina natural over why?

1549
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:14,320
Why can I say her last name now?

1550
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,220
The Napa tro.

1551
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:17,590
I don't think I've ever said it.

1552
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,040
Martina Navajo Tullow VA
is it till over Trello Va.

1553
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:22,210
Anyway,

1554
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:25,240
epic World Class Legend Tennis Player,

1555
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,720
right?

1556
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,170
Who happens to be a lesbian is um,

1557
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:33,270
being harassed because she says that
she doesn't believe that trans women,

1558
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,350
meaning someone who is biologically male,

1559
00:45:35,351 --> 00:45:39,640
who transitions to a female should
be able to compete in sports against

1560
00:45:39,641 --> 00:45:40,930
biological females.

1561
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,520
This is something that I agree with.

1562
00:45:42,521 --> 00:45:46,030
This is something I have personally
experienced a tremendous amount of

1563
00:45:46,031 --> 00:45:50,200
harassment because I stood up when there
was a woman who was a trans woman who

1564
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:54,460
was fighting biological females in
mixed martial arts fights and destroying

1565
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:55,210
these women.

1566
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:55,751
And I was saying,

1567
00:45:55,751 --> 00:45:59,290
what did you just watch this and tell
me this doesn't look crazy to you?

1568
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:00,663
Um,

1569
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,410
well,

1570
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,243
I,

1571
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:03,520
well,

1572
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,360
my point is you should be
able to express yourself in,

1573
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,770
if you say that you believe
someone is biologically male,

1574
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:14,980
even though they identify as a female,

1575
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:17,350
that's a perspective that should be valid.

1576
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,970
I mean that this is someone's,

1577
00:46:19,030 --> 00:46:19,863
someone's,

1578
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:20,950
this is,

1579
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:21,611
first of all,

1580
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,200
it's biologically correct.

1581
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:23,631
So we,

1582
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:24,880
we have a problem in that.

1583
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:30,120
If your standards and your policies
are not biologically accurate,

1584
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,670
then you're dealing with an ideological,

1585
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:34,060
I,

1586
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:34,450
you know,

1587
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:35,950
an ideological policy.

1588
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,600
And just because,

1589
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:37,991
I mean,

1590
00:46:37,991 --> 00:46:38,710
I don't,

1591
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,110
I don't want to target trans people.

1592
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,490
I don't want to harass them.

1593
00:46:42,491 --> 00:46:42,960
I certainly,

1594
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,710
I'll call anybody whatever they want.

1595
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:45,131
I mean,

1596
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:48,130
if you want to change your name to a
woman's name and identify as a woman,

1597
00:46:48,131 --> 00:46:49,480
I'm 100% cool with that.

1598
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,090
But by saying,

1599
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:55,540
I don't think that you should
be able to compete as a woman.

1600
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,530
This opens me up for harassment
and I never will hoard it.

1601
00:46:59,531 --> 00:46:59,891
Any of it,

1602
00:46:59,891 --> 00:47:00,910
I just don't pay attention to it.

1603
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:01,744
Right.

1604
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,120
Going into like Megan Murphy for instance,

1605
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:04,661
right?

1606
00:47:04,661 --> 00:47:05,950
You can call that target harassment.

1607
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:07,540
If Megan Murphy who was a,

1608
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:07,961
for those that are,

1609
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:08,170
don't,

1610
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:08,501
don't know,

1611
00:47:08,501 --> 00:47:12,910
she's a radical feminist who refuses
to use the transgender pronouns.

1612
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,020
If she's in an argument with a trans
person over whether or not they should be

1613
00:47:17,021 --> 00:47:21,520
allowed in sports or in biologically
female spaces and she refuses to use their

1614
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:23,140
pronoun because of her ideology,

1615
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,003
you'll bend them.

1616
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:25,001
Again,

1617
00:47:25,001 --> 00:47:29,950
it depends on the context on the
platform and it's also not banned

1618
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:30,760
permanently.

1619
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,491
Like you get Warren,

1620
00:47:31,491 --> 00:47:32,800
she was banned permanently.

1621
00:47:32,801 --> 00:47:33,220
But listen,

1622
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,870
she was hearing about what happened.

1623
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,090
What did he explain it to me?

1624
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:37,680
What,

1625
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:37,901
what,

1626
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:38,980
what did she actually do?

1627
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,090
My understanding and I don't have the
tweet by tweet the way that I did for the

1628
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:43,391
others,

1629
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:46,510
but my understanding is that she
was warned multiple times for um,

1630
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,730
mis-gendering an individual that she was
in an argument with in this individual

1631
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:54,610
is actually bringing a lawsuit
against her in Canada as well.

1632
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,110
So you have an argument between two
people again and you have a rule that

1633
00:47:59,111 --> 00:48:01,750
enforces only one side of the ideology
and you've banned only one of those

1634
00:48:01,751 --> 00:48:02,080
people.

1635
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,080
We have a rule that attempts to address
what we have perceived to be instances

1636
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:11,170
of abuse or harassment or ideology,

1637
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:11,571
right?

1638
00:48:11,571 --> 00:48:12,500
But it is an ideology,

1639
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:12,651
right?

1640
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:14,630
If she's saying a man is never a woman,

1641
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,830
if that's what she's saying.

1642
00:48:15,831 --> 00:48:17,630
And then biologically she's correct.

1643
00:48:17,631 --> 00:48:18,980
We obviously have a debate here.

1644
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,540
This is not a clear cut.

1645
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:23,900
This is not something like
you can say water is wet,

1646
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,130
you know this is dry.

1647
00:48:25,131 --> 00:48:25,311
It's,

1648
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:27,140
and this is not like
something you can prove.

1649
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,700
This is something where you,

1650
00:48:28,701 --> 00:48:32,960
you have to acknowledge that there's
an understanding that if someone has a

1651
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:33,794
trans person,

1652
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,950
we all agree to consider them a woman.

1653
00:48:36,951 --> 00:48:38,260
And to think of them as a woman,

1654
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,280
to talk to them and address them with
their preferred name and their preferred

1655
00:48:43,281 --> 00:48:43,970
pronouns.

1656
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:45,770
But biologically this is not accurate.

1657
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:46,470
So we have,

1658
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,690
we have a divide here.

1659
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,440
We have a divide between the conservative
estimation of what's happening and

1660
00:48:51,441 --> 00:48:53,300
then the definition.

1661
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,860
That's the liberal definition of it.

1662
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,940
I think that's right Joe.

1663
00:48:55,941 --> 00:48:59,120
And I think what I'm trying to say is
that it's not that you can't have those

1664
00:48:59,121 --> 00:48:59,954
viewpoints.

1665
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,260
It's an if you're taking those
viewpoints in your targeting and at the,

1666
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,320
at a specific person in a way that
reflects your intents to abuse and harass.

1667
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:09,390
What if it's in the context
of the conversation?

1668
00:49:09,391 --> 00:49:12,240
What if she's saying that I don't think
that trans women should be allowed in

1669
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,850
these female spaces to
make decisions for women.

1670
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,340
And then this person's
arguing and she says,

1671
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,130
a woman is biologically female.

1672
00:49:20,131 --> 00:49:21,530
You are never going to be a woman.

1673
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:23,900
She responded with men
aren't women though.

1674
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,600
And that was her first
in the series of events.

1675
00:49:26,601 --> 00:49:28,160
That's what got her the
suspension and the warning.

1676
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,730
Um,

1677
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,510
that was one of many tweets that was
part of providing context and that was

1678
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:33,344
actually the second,

1679
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,930
second actually strike
is my understanding.

1680
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:36,800
But why is that a strike?

1681
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:37,010
Yeah,

1682
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:37,843
why is that a strike?

1683
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,200
But again,

1684
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,910
like it's the context of I don't,

1685
00:49:40,970 --> 00:49:42,200
I don't have all the trees in front of me.

1686
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:46,040
There were like 10 or 12 tweets going
back and forth and my understanding is

1687
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,720
that in the context of all of those,

1688
00:49:47,721 --> 00:49:49,910
she was mis-gendering a particular person.

1689
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,300
Not that she was holding
a baby or statement,

1690
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:52,880
wasn't it?

1691
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:53,480
I don't know.

1692
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,313
It was.

1693
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,220
So you don't,

1694
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,670
you're having,

1695
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:58,250
you're having an individual who was
debating a high profile individual in her

1696
00:49:58,251 --> 00:50:00,530
community and she's expressing her,

1697
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,640
her ideology of versus hers and you have
opted to band one of those ideologies.

1698
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:05,510
It's within the

1699
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,920
text of this conversation.

1700
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:07,550
This is,

1701
00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:08,990
this is what is being debated.

1702
00:50:08,991 --> 00:50:12,860
Whether or not someone is in fact
a woman when they were born a male.

1703
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:15,050
I understand that this is controversial.

1704
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,950
I do.

1705
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:17,560
I especially to a radical feminist.

1706
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:19,040
I understand why,

1707
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,870
why people would not agree with the role,

1708
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:22,370
but that being said,

1709
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:27,170
it is a rule on our platform and once
you're warned about the rule to repeatedly

1710
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:30,560
post the same content is also going
to be a violation of our rules.

1711
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,011
Rabid.

1712
00:50:31,011 --> 00:50:31,670
The rule,

1713
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:32,091
it's,

1714
00:50:32,091 --> 00:50:36,650
this seems like a good example
of an ideologically based rule.

1715
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:37,550
If if you're,

1716
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,820
if she's saying that a man
is never a woman though,

1717
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,300
that is not in that context harassment.

1718
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:49,430
That is a very specific opinion that
she has that happens to be biologically

1719
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:50,264
accurate.

1720
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:50,661
Now,

1721
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,494
I don't,

1722
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,011
you know,

1723
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:56,840
I don't agree with targeting harassment
on anybody and I targeted harassment on

1724
00:50:56,841 --> 00:50:59,990
trans people or or straight
people or whatever.

1725
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:00,291
I don't,

1726
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,124
I don't agree with it.

1727
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:02,240
I don't think you should do it.

1728
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:02,721
It's just,

1729
00:51:02,721 --> 00:51:03,890
it's not something I want to do.

1730
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,620
But in this context,

1731
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,530
what she's saying is not just her,

1732
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,460
her expression,

1733
00:51:10,461 --> 00:51:11,300
but it's accurate.

1734
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,990
I think an important point
is if I tweet it to you,

1735
00:51:14,991 --> 00:51:15,650
Joe,

1736
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,160
Joe,

1737
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,150
you are not a hamster.

1738
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,460
That's clearly not a
violation of the rules.

1739
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:19,911
However,

1740
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:21,620
there are identify as a hamster?

1741
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:22,061
Well No,

1742
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:22,240
uh,

1743
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:22,450
it,

1744
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,960
it wouldn't be clear cause I know,

1745
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,860
I know people who have specifically
began using insults of animals to avoid

1746
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:29,630
getting kicked off the platform
for breaking the rules.

1747
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:33,320
Certain individuals who have been
suspended now use certain small woodland

1748
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:36,770
creatures in place of slurs so they're
not really insulting you and it's fine.

1749
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,290
But there are people who considers
themselves trans species.

1750
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:41,900
Now I'm not trying to belittle
the trans community by no means.

1751
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,530
I'm just trying to point out that you
have a specific rule for one set of people

1752
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,513
and they're there.

1753
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:48,530
So there are people who
have general body dysphoria.

1754
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,610
You don't have rules on that.

1755
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,830
There are people who have
actually amputated their own arms.

1756
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:52,880
You don't have rules on that.

1757
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:54,530
You have a very specific rule set.

1758
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:59,980
And in more importantly in the
context of a targeted conversation,

1759
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,260
I can say a whole bunch of things that
would never be considered a rule break.

1760
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,960
But that one is which
is ideologically driven.

1761
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,450
Yeah.

1762
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:09,380
Thank you for the feedback.

1763
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,040
I mean we're,

1764
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:14,240
we're again always learning and trying
to understand different people's

1765
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:15,020
perspectives.

1766
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:15,970
And I'll,

1767
00:52:16,310 --> 00:52:19,940
all I'll say is that our intent
is not to police ideology.

1768
00:52:19,941 --> 00:52:22,850
Our intent is to police
behaviors that we view as abuse,

1769
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:23,151
movement,

1770
00:52:23,151 --> 00:52:23,661
harassment,

1771
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:27,200
and I hear your point of view and it's
something that I'll definitely discuss

1772
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:27,800
with my team.

1773
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,160
And even in this case,

1774
00:52:29,161 --> 00:52:29,521
it wasn't,

1775
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:30,970
it wasn't just um,

1776
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,600
no going against this particular role,

1777
00:52:34,601 --> 00:52:39,220
but also things that were
more ban evasive as well,

1778
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:41,920
including taking a screenshot
of the original tweet,

1779
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:42,641
reposting it,

1780
00:52:42,641 --> 00:52:43,910
which is against her or term,

1781
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:44,041
sir.

1782
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:45,580
Well that sounds like
it's more of the accident.

1783
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:47,570
It sounded like a protest
against your role.

1784
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,020
I understand you have to ban them for it,

1785
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,900
but people can protest
any one of our rules.

1786
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:51,321
We can't,

1787
00:52:51,321 --> 00:52:52,930
we can't like let them do that.

1788
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,181
No,

1789
00:52:53,181 --> 00:52:53,241
no,

1790
00:52:53,241 --> 00:52:53,361
no.

1791
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:54,530
I haven't purchased any of that.

1792
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:54,800
I'm not,

1793
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,220
dating is great.

1794
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,060
I understand you're saying,

1795
00:52:56,061 --> 00:52:58,730
but I just want to make sure I point out
she was clearly doing it as an effort

1796
00:52:58,731 --> 00:53:01,430
to push back on what she viewed
as an ideologically driven role.

1797
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:01,641
Well,

1798
00:53:01,641 --> 00:53:02,660
this is what the problem is.

1799
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:07,661
This is a real debate
in the LGBT community.

1800
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:11,480
This is a debate where there is a division
and there's a division between people

1801
00:53:11,481 --> 00:53:16,481
that think that Trans Women are invading
biological female spaces and making

1802
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:20,300
decisions that don't benefit
these biological females,

1803
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,170
CIS gender,

1804
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,003
whatever you want to call them.

1805
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:24,200
This is an actual debate
and it's a debate,

1806
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:27,660
a debate amongst people
amongst left wing people.

1807
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,310
And it's a debate amongst liberals.

1808
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:30,181
This is,

1809
00:53:30,181 --> 00:53:35,181
I mean I would imagine the vast majority
of people in the LBGT community are in

1810
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:37,110
fact on the left.

1811
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,720
And this is one example of that.

1812
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:44,840
So you have a protected class that's
having an argument with a woman who feels

1813
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:50,130
like there's an ideological bent
to this conversation that is not,

1814
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,360
not only not accurate,

1815
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,194
but not fair.

1816
00:53:52,350 --> 00:53:54,840
And she feels like it's not
fair for biological women.

1817
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:56,070
The same as Martina,

1818
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:56,761
I'll,

1819
00:53:56,761 --> 00:53:56,971
I'll,

1820
00:53:56,971 --> 00:53:57,750
uh,

1821
00:53:57,750 --> 00:53:59,040
take this to its logical conclusion.

1822
00:53:59,041 --> 00:54:01,830
I got sent a screenshot from
somebody and maybe it's faked.

1823
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,940
I think it was real.

1824
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:06,720
They were having an argument with
someone on Twitter and responded with,

1825
00:54:06,721 --> 00:54:07,230
Dude,

1826
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:07,590
comma,

1827
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:08,161
you don't know,

1828
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:08,281
blah,

1829
00:54:08,281 --> 00:54:08,910
blah blah.

1830
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,180
And they got a suspension and a lockout
had deleted the tweet because the

1831
00:54:12,181 --> 00:54:16,530
individual using a cartoon Avatar with
the eight with with the apparently with

1832
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:19,980
Sam reported it and said
that I'm transgender and
he's calling me dude and the

1833
00:54:19,981 --> 00:54:22,110
dude and the Twitter user
actually got a suspension for it.

1834
00:54:22,111 --> 00:54:23,910
So I can understand mistakes happen,

1835
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,560
but when you have a rule that's like that,

1836
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,270
there's colloquial terms that are like,

1837
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:27,661
man,

1838
00:54:27,661 --> 00:54:27,961
come on.

1839
00:54:27,961 --> 00:54:28,441
Don't say that.

1840
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:28,550
Yeah,

1841
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,331
dude is like,

1842
00:54:29,331 --> 00:54:30,260
we say like,

1843
00:54:30,261 --> 00:54:30,341
oh,

1844
00:54:30,341 --> 00:54:33,650
like I asked you guys when you were
going to take a photo in front of this

1845
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:33,771
thing.

1846
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:34,041
I said,

1847
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:34,874
guys,

1848
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:36,050
but I included you.

1849
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:37,983
Thank you.

1850
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:41,073
Thank you.

1851
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:42,171
Yeah,

1852
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:42,700
it's,

1853
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,431
it's tricky,

1854
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:46,100
but in this case of Megan Murphy,

1855
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:46,521
that's her name,

1856
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:46,970
right?

1857
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:47,520
Yeah.

1858
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,770
That doesn't make any sense to me.

1859
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:52,090
That seems like she should be allowed
to express herself in this is,

1860
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:53,330
this is not being,

1861
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:54,620
she's not being mean,

1862
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,990
but I saying a man has never a woman.

1863
00:54:56,991 --> 00:55:01,991
This is a perspective that that is
scientifically accurate and that's,

1864
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:03,350
that's part of the problem.

1865
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:03,580
I,

1866
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:03,830
I,

1867
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:04,060
I,

1868
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,210
I just don't want it to run into,

1869
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:05,921
to beating a dead horse.

1870
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:06,870
So I think I want to,

1871
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:11,920
it's a really important thing to go
over all the nuances of this particular

1872
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:16,921
subject because I think that
one in particular highlights
this idea of where the

1873
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:20,110
problems lie and having a protected class.

1874
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,840
And I think we should be compassionate.

1875
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,160
We have a lot of protected classes,

1876
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:24,990
gender,

1877
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:25,630
race,

1878
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:26,380
nationality,

1879
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,250
like these are the protective,

1880
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,840
but this not for white people.

1881
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,900
When you say gender or race,

1882
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:34,390
when it's not all protected category.

1883
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:37,810
So you can't attack someone for their
belonging to a particular race or a

1884
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:38,860
particular religion?

1885
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,560
Well you can mock white people ad nauseum.

1886
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,640
It's not a problem.

1887
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:43,360
It doesn't get,

1888
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,530
it doesn't get removed.

1889
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:45,580
I'm not talking about mocking,

1890
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:47,580
I'm talking about abusing and harassing.

1891
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,650
But I mean if you mok a
black person in the same way,

1892
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:53,020
it would be considered targeted racism.

1893
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,000
And again,

1894
00:55:55,001 --> 00:55:57,190
it's about targeted
harassment on the platform.

1895
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:58,270
But well,

1896
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,790
I mean what is targeted harassment?

1897
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,091
I mean,

1898
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:01,780
but when you're,

1899
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,230
okay,

1900
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:02,441
look,

1901
00:56:02,441 --> 00:56:03,274
if you ha,

1902
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,540
what is racism?

1903
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,890
Is Racism own it?

1904
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:11,500
I mean there's this progressive
perspective of racism
that it's only possible if

1905
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,990
you're from a more powerful
class only punching down.

1906
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,160
That's the only racism.

1907
00:56:15,161 --> 00:56:16,540
I don't think that makes any sense.

1908
00:56:16,810 --> 00:56:20,530
I think racism is looking at
someone that is from whatever,

1909
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,960
whatever race and deciding that they,

1910
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:27,940
in fact less or less
worthy or less valuable,

1911
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
whatever it is that that takes place
across the platform against white people.

1912
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,260
Now I'm not saying white
people need to be protected.

1913
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,360
I know it's easier being
a white person in America.

1914
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,283
It's a fact,

1915
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:43,500
but it's hypocritical to have a
policy that only distinguishes,

1916
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:46,120
you can make fun of white
people all day long.

1917
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,060
But if you decide to make fun
of Asian folks or you know,

1918
00:56:49,061 --> 00:56:51,580
fill in the blank that is racist,

1919
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,920
but making fun of white people
isn't and it doesn't get removed.

1920
00:56:54,070 --> 00:56:55,080
There are tons of tooling.

1921
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:57,190
How about Sara Jong
From The New York Times?

1922
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,160
That's a,

1923
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:58,311
well,

1924
00:56:58,311 --> 00:56:59,330
I can actually explain that one.

1925
00:56:59,331 --> 00:56:59,840
Please do.

1926
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,040
There's,

1927
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:00,600
that was,

1928
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:01,433
uh,

1929
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,320
my understanding is that you
guys started banning people,

1930
00:57:03,321 --> 00:57:06,980
official entities policies around 2015
and most all the tweets he made was prior

1931
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:07,550
to that.

1932
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:08,620
And so you didn't enforce the old,

1933
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:08,881
yeah.

1934
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:10,230
So are hateful conduct policy,

1935
00:57:10,231 --> 00:57:10,411
Joe,

1936
00:57:10,411 --> 00:57:11,730
just to be clear is,

1937
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,140
is across the board,

1938
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,590
meaning like it doesn't just protect
women and protects men and women and

1939
00:57:16,591 --> 00:57:18,120
protects all races.

1940
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:18,780
It doesn't matter.

1941
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,610
And this is how the law is
set up in the United States,

1942
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:21,030
right?

1943
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,560
You can't discriminate against white men.

1944
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:24,870
You can't discriminate against black men.

1945
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:26,640
Like those are the laws,

1946
00:57:26,641 --> 00:57:26,971
right?

1947
00:57:26,971 --> 00:57:28,050
Like that's the structure.

1948
00:57:28,051 --> 00:57:28,431
It is.

1949
00:57:28,431 --> 00:57:29,070
It doesn't,

1950
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:30,390
it doesn't take into consideration

1951
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:30,720
power.

1952
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:35,420
Someone says something about white people
and Mark's white people on Twitter.

1953
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,040
What do you do about that?

1954
00:57:37,041 --> 00:57:39,590
If it's targeted harassment
targeted at a person.

1955
00:57:39,591 --> 00:57:41,300
So just white people in general.

1956
00:57:41,301 --> 00:57:42,940
If you say something about
why people in general,

1957
00:57:42,941 --> 00:57:43,774
it's not an issue.

1958
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:44,500
Well,

1959
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,180
I mean we focus on targeted harassment,

1960
00:57:46,181 --> 00:57:49,060
which is behavior that is targeted
against an individual who belongs to that

1961
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:49,420
class.

1962
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:49,930
Okay.

1963
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:53,320
Because if you try to police every
opinion that people have about different

1964
00:57:53,321 --> 00:57:54,310
races or religions,

1965
00:57:54,311 --> 00:57:56,500
like obviously that's
a very different story.

1966
00:57:56,501 --> 00:58:00,880
So this is about if you target that to
somebody who belongs to that class and

1967
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:01,930
that's reported to us,

1968
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:03,310
that is a violation of our rules.

1969
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,350
And so in the Sarah Jiang case,

1970
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:06,431
a lot,

1971
00:58:06,431 --> 00:58:08,260
we did see many tweets,

1972
00:58:08,350 --> 00:58:08,681
uh,

1973
00:58:08,681 --> 00:58:10,900
of that nature that we're focused on.

1974
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:11,470
Uh,

1975
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,000
people who are white or men.

1976
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,860
And our rules in this area came into
effect in 2015 which was our hateful

1977
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:18,850
conduct policy.

1978
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:23,510
And a lot of those tweets were from a
time period where those rules weren't

1979
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:23,830
enough.

1980
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:24,790
And in her defense,

1981
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,620
she was actually supposedly
responding to people that have,

1982
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,330
you don't believe that

1983
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:32,820
come on over three years and she's
tweeting blanket statements about,

1984
00:58:33,090 --> 00:58:33,710
yeah,

1985
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:33,981
sure,

1986
00:58:33,981 --> 00:58:34,311
sure.

1987
00:58:34,311 --> 00:58:34,961
But so,

1988
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:35,930
so I will say too,

1989
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:36,793
obviously I've done it

1990
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:38,970
finish on my one point.

1991
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:39,661
So in,

1992
00:58:39,661 --> 00:58:40,201
in that case,

1993
00:58:40,201 --> 00:58:43,110
there were tweets from before the rules
went into effect and tweets from after

1994
00:58:43,111 --> 00:58:44,010
the rules went into effect.

1995
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:47,120
And we did take action on the
tweets from after the rules went in.

1996
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,680
She's also pretty young,

1997
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:49,160
but he did.

1998
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,390
So I want to point,

1999
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:51,050
uh,

2000
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:51,261
yeah,

2001
00:58:51,261 --> 00:58:52,094
she's in her twenties.

2002
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,430
We're talking about something that
might've happened eight years ago,

2003
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:56,643
right?

2004
00:58:57,350 --> 00:58:57,651
20.

2005
00:58:57,651 --> 00:58:59,010
It was like 2011 to 13.

2006
00:58:59,110 --> 00:58:59,260
But,

2007
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:00,290
but I do want to point this out,

2008
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:00,710
um,

2009
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,311
before coming on.

2010
00:59:01,311 --> 00:59:01,941
I've obviously did it.

2011
00:59:01,941 --> 00:59:02,210
Dot.

2012
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,560
I did a decent amount of research.

2013
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,080
I searched for slurs against white people,

2014
00:59:06,081 --> 00:59:06,501
black people,

2015
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:06,951
Latinos,

2016
00:59:06,951 --> 00:59:08,180
and I found copious,

2017
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:08,510
just,

2018
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:09,860
just tons and tons of them.

2019
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:11,720
Now they don't go back.

2020
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:14,570
Most of what I found in go back too far
because it does seem like you guys are

2021
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:15,231
doing your best,

2022
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:17,270
but there is a lot and
it targets white people,

2023
00:59:17,271 --> 00:59:17,841
black people,

2024
00:59:17,841 --> 00:59:18,501
Jewish people.

2025
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:19,310
It's everywhere.

2026
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:19,551
And I,

2027
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:19,890
and I can,

2028
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,190
I can,

2029
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:20,841
I can understand that.

2030
00:59:20,841 --> 00:59:21,170
You,

2031
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,190
you got a hundreds of millions,

2032
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:22,911
but,

2033
00:59:22,911 --> 00:59:23,180
uh,

2034
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:23,391
let's,

2035
00:59:23,391 --> 00:59:23,630
let's,

2036
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:23,871
let's,

2037
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:24,651
let's try another,

2038
00:59:24,651 --> 00:59:24,890
uh,

2039
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:27,230
subject to address that point.

2040
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:27,830
Um,

2041
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,450
and I think Jack talked
about this a little bit.

2042
00:59:29,510 --> 00:59:33,200
Like this is where right now we have a
system that relies on people to report it

2043
00:59:33,201 --> 00:59:33,471
to us,

2044
00:59:33,471 --> 00:59:35,180
which is a huge burden on people.

2045
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,130
And especially if you are,

2046
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:37,521
uh,

2047
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:39,980
happened to be a high
profile person and Tim,

2048
00:59:39,981 --> 00:59:40,430
you would,

2049
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,241
you would understand this.

2050
00:59:41,241 --> 00:59:43,040
You're not going to sit there
and report every tweet and Joe,

2051
00:59:43,041 --> 00:59:44,540
y'all understand this isn't like,

2052
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,470
it's not worth your time.

2053
00:59:45,471 --> 00:59:47,960
You're not going to go through a tweet
by tweet as people respond to you and

2054
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:48,794
report it.

2055
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:50,180
People tell us this all the time.

2056
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,870
So this is where we have to start getting
better at identifying when this is

2057
00:59:53,871 --> 00:59:57,710
happening and taking action on it without
waiting for somebody to tell us the

2058
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:57,980
time.

2059
00:59:57,980 --> 00:59:59,360
Using an algorithm though,

2060
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:01,130
do you not miss context?

2061
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,520
I mean,

2062
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:02,440
it seems to me that

2063
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,850
there's a lot of people
that say things in humor,

2064
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:05,650
you know,

2065
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:05,930
the,

2066
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:06,250
the,

2067
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:08,360
or slurs within particular communities,

2068
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:09,560
which is perfectly reasonable,

2069
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,160
right?

2070
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:10,491
Right.

2071
01:00:10,491 --> 01:00:11,450
So yes,

2072
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:14,900
there is a danger of the algorithm
is missing context and that's why we,

2073
01:00:14,901 --> 01:00:18,740
we really want to go carefully into this
and this is why we've scoped it down

2074
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,270
first and foremost to doxing,

2075
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,040
which is at least first to
hit our number one goal,

2076
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:25,310
protecting physical safety,

2077
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:29,450
like making sure that nothing done online
will impact someone's physical safety

2078
01:00:29,451 --> 01:00:30,081
on offline,

2079
01:00:30,081 --> 01:00:31,880
on our platform in this case.

2080
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:37,450
The second is that there are patterns
around doxing that are much easier to see

2081
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,460
without having the context.

2082
01:00:40,461 --> 01:00:40,880
There are,

2083
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,920
there are exceptions of course,

2084
01:00:42,921 --> 01:00:44,600
cause you could docs,

2085
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,140
um,

2086
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,100
someone's public,

2087
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:46,460
you know,

2088
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,150
uh,

2089
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:47,211
uh,

2090
01:00:47,211 --> 01:00:47,841
representatives,

2091
01:00:47,841 --> 01:00:48,590
public,

2092
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:48,721
uh,

2093
01:00:48,721 --> 01:00:49,311
office,

2094
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:52,880
phone number and email address and
the algorithm might catch that,

2095
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,870
not have the context that this is a US
representative and this information is

2096
01:00:56,871 --> 01:00:57,704
already public.

2097
01:00:57,950 --> 01:00:59,300
So essentially this just,

2098
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:04,460
it highlights how insanely difficult
it is to monitor all of these posts.

2099
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,470
And then what is the volume?

2100
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:06,931
Like what,

2101
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:07,731
what are we dealing with?

2102
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,060
Like how many posts do you guys get at

2103
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:09,640
day?

2104
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,810
A hundreds of millions of posts a day.

2105
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,030
And how many human beings are manually
reviewing any of these things?

2106
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,433
I don't have that,

2107
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,040
that number.

2108
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,580
A lot.

2109
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,150
A lot.

2110
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,740
Thousands,

2111
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:21,741
hundreds of thousands.

2112
01:01:21,741 --> 01:01:22,700
How many employees you guys have?

2113
01:01:22,701 --> 01:01:23,030
We have,

2114
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,863
uh,

2115
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:25,610
4,000 employees around the world.

2116
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,210
That's it.

2117
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,043
Yeah,

2118
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:28,250
we have 4,000 employees.

2119
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:29,930
The reason that's crazy though,

2120
01:01:29,931 --> 01:01:30,920
but stop and think about that.

2121
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:35,240
4,000 people that are monitoring
hundreds of millions of tweets on we,

2122
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:35,691
we have,

2123
01:01:35,691 --> 01:01:35,870
uh,

2124
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:36,171
we have,

2125
01:01:36,171 --> 01:01:36,320
uh,

2126
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:40,190
we have a small team who's monitoring
tweets and some of them are employed by

2127
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:40,341
us.

2128
01:01:40,341 --> 01:01:42,170
Some of them are contractors throughout,

2129
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:42,920
throughout the world.

2130
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:43,940
So 4,000 employees,

2131
01:01:43,941 --> 01:01:44,481
total,

2132
01:01:44,481 --> 01:01:46,520
4,000 employees who are engineers,

2133
01:01:46,521 --> 01:01:47,301
who are designers,

2134
01:01:47,301 --> 01:01:48,040
who are lawyers.

2135
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,310
So the number of people actually
monitoring tweets is probably less than a

2136
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:52,820
thousand.

2137
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:53,150
Uh,

2138
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:57,920
well the reason we don't give out
specific numbers is we need to scale these

2139
01:01:57,921 --> 01:01:58,754
dynamically,

2140
01:01:58,910 --> 01:01:59,151
right?

2141
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:00,910
If we see a particular event within,

2142
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:01,170
uh,

2143
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,150
within country,

2144
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:06,170
we might hire a hundred more
people on contract to deal with it,

2145
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:06,590
right?

2146
01:02:06,590 --> 01:02:08,160
Whereas they may not be full time and,

2147
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:08,421
and,

2148
01:02:08,421 --> 01:02:09,650
and with us the entire time,

2149
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,570
they have the ability to take down tweets.

2150
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:12,211
Uh,

2151
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:13,140
they have Dave the,

2152
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,990
so as we get reports,

2153
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,200
it goes into a queue and
those are ranked by severity.

2154
01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:19,980
And then we people who look at

2155
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,800
our roles and look at the look at the
tweets and looking at the behavior in the

2156
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:23,634
context around it.

2157
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:28,560
And they have the ability to go
down that enforcement spectrum.

2158
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:29,910
The vigil talked about one,

2159
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,890
make people log in,

2160
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:36,810
read why it's a violation over tweet
and delete it to temporary suspensions.

2161
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:39,450
And finally a permanent suspension,

2162
01:02:39,451 --> 01:02:41,370
which is the absolute last resort,

2163
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:43,650
which we ultimately do not want to do.

2164
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:48,300
We want to make sure that our rules are
also guided towards incentivizing more

2165
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,950
healthy conversation and,

2166
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:50,550
and more,

2167
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:51,570
more participation.

2168
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:51,930
Yep.

2169
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:52,350
So let,

2170
01:02:52,350 --> 01:02:52,441
let,

2171
01:02:52,441 --> 01:02:52,561
let,

2172
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:53,090
let me ask you,

2173
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:53,610
um,

2174
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:55,680
the rules you have are
not based in US law,

2175
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:56,071
right?

2176
01:02:56,071 --> 01:02:58,440
US law doesn't recognize
restrictions on hate speech.

2177
01:02:58,441 --> 01:02:59,400
It's considered free speech.

2178
01:02:59,401 --> 01:03:01,620
So if you want to stand on a street
corner and yell the craziest things in the

2179
01:03:01,621 --> 01:03:01,801
world,

2180
01:03:01,801 --> 01:03:03,600
you're allowed to on your platform,

2181
01:03:03,630 --> 01:03:04,170
Twitter,

2182
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:05,003
you're not allowed to.

2183
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,740
So even in that sense alone,

2184
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:09,660
your rules do have an
ideology behind them.

2185
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,740
I don't completely disagree.

2186
01:03:10,741 --> 01:03:11,071
I think,

2187
01:03:11,071 --> 01:03:11,281
you know,

2188
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:12,114
I don't want harassment.

2189
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:12,900
Um,

2190
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,160
but the reason I bring this up is getting
into the discussion about democratic

2191
01:03:17,161 --> 01:03:18,150
health of a nation.

2192
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,160
So I think it's,

2193
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:23,940
it can't be disputed at this point
that Twitter is extremely powerful in

2194
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:25,140
influencing elections.

2195
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:25,860
You know,

2196
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:26,001
I,

2197
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:28,890
I'm pretty sure you guys published
recently a bunch of tweets from foreign

2198
01:03:28,891 --> 01:03:30,720
actors that were trying
to mettle in elections.

2199
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,900
So even you as a company recognize
that foreign entities are trying to

2200
01:03:33,901 --> 01:03:35,250
manipulate people using this platform.

2201
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:36,500
So I,

2202
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:36,650
there's,

2203
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,130
there's a few things I
want to ask beyond this,

2204
01:03:38,131 --> 01:03:42,270
but if wouldn't it be
important then to just as a,

2205
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,051
at a certain point,

2206
01:03:43,051 --> 01:03:46,890
Twitter becomes so powerful in influencing
elections and giving access to even

2207
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:50,190
the president's tweets that you should
allow people to use the platform based

2208
01:03:50,191 --> 01:03:52,470
under the norms of US law,

2209
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:53,611
First Amendment,

2210
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:54,290
free speech,

2211
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,590
right to expression on the platform.

2212
01:03:56,310 --> 01:03:57,600
This is becoming too much,

2213
01:03:57,650 --> 01:03:57,890
uh,

2214
01:03:57,890 --> 01:03:58,141
of,

2215
01:03:58,141 --> 01:03:58,830
uh,

2216
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:02,130
it's becoming too powerful and how
our elections are taking place.

2217
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,620
So even if you are saying,

2218
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:04,741
well,

2219
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:06,750
hate speech is our role and a
lot of people agree with it.

2220
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:09,090
If at any 0.1 person disagrees,

2221
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:10,680
there's still an American
who has it right to this,

2222
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,160
you know,

2223
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:15,270
to access to the public discourse and
you've essentially monopolized and not

2224
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:15,900
completely,

2225
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:16,740
but for the most part.

2226
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,120
So isn't there some responsibility on
you to guarantee at at a certain extent,

2227
01:04:21,630 --> 01:04:22,710
less regulation happen,

2228
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:23,780
right?

2229
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:23,970
Like,

2230
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:24,181
look,

2231
01:04:24,181 --> 01:04:24,391
if you,

2232
01:04:24,391 --> 01:04:26,660
if you recognize foreign
governments are manipulating a lot,

2233
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,503
our elections,

2234
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,870
then shouldn't you guarantee the right
to an American to access this platform to

2235
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,190
be involved in the electoral process?

2236
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:35,173
Yeah,

2237
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,390
I'm not sure I see the,

2238
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:36,880
the,

2239
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:37,970
the tie between those things,

2240
01:04:37,971 --> 01:04:39,170
but I will address one of your points,

2241
01:04:39,171 --> 01:04:40,004
which was,

2242
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:40,580
uh,

2243
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,360
we're not,

2244
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,340
we're a platform that serves the world.

2245
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:44,630
So we're a global,

2246
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:44,991
uh,

2247
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:49,100
75% of the users of Twitter or
outside of the United States.

2248
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:49,410
Oh No.

2249
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:49,550
Right,

2250
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:49,761
right,

2251
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:49,881
right.

2252
01:04:49,881 --> 01:04:51,290
So we don't,

2253
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:51,640
uh,

2254
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,090
apply laws.

2255
01:04:53,091 --> 01:04:56,030
I'm just one country when we're
thinking about it and we think about,

2256
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:56,540
um,

2257
01:04:56,540 --> 01:05:01,340
how do you have a global standard
that can meet the threshold of as many

2258
01:05:01,341 --> 01:05:04,370
countries as possible because we want
all the people in the world to be able to

2259
01:05:04,371 --> 01:05:05,630
participate in that conversation.

2260
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:05,950
Yeah.

2261
01:05:05,950 --> 01:05:08,580
And so it also meet elections like
the Indian election coming up.

2262
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:09,230
Right.

2263
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:09,840
And I'm,

2264
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,070
my,

2265
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:12,710
my understanding is you were also accused
of being biased against conservatives

2266
01:05:12,711 --> 01:05:13,544
in India recently.

2267
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,680
There was a report on that as well as
you held up a sign that said something

2268
01:05:17,681 --> 01:05:19,330
offensive about the Brahmin.

2269
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:20,770
Yeah.

2270
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:22,660
So in that sense,

2271
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,340
even in other countries,

2272
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,800
you're accused of the same things that
you're being accused of by American

2273
01:05:26,801 --> 01:05:27,634
conservatives.

2274
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:30,100
I think that the situations are very,

2275
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:30,970
very different.

2276
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:31,960
Um,

2277
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:36,040
and I don't think that that the
ideologies in play are the same at all.

2278
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:36,251
Well,

2279
01:05:36,251 --> 01:05:36,501
so the,

2280
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:37,990
the reason we clarify that,

2281
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:40,430
I,

2282
01:05:40,430 --> 01:05:41,920
I'm not sure what you're talking about,

2283
01:05:41,921 --> 01:05:42,600
but we,

2284
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:45,910
we did have our vice president of
public policy testify in front of Indian

2285
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:47,800
parliament a couple of
weeks ago and he was,

2286
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:51,190
they were really focused on election
integrity and safety and abuse and

2287
01:05:51,191 --> 01:05:55,000
harassment of women and
political figures and the likes.

2288
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:55,470
So,

2289
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:55,850
so my,

2290
01:05:55,850 --> 01:05:56,110
my,

2291
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:58,240
my concern I guess is
I recognize your globe.

2292
01:05:58,310 --> 01:05:59,560
You're a company that serves the world,

2293
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:04,090
but as an American I have the concern
that the democracy I live in the

2294
01:06:04,090 --> 01:06:04,091
Democratic Republic,

2295
01:06:04,091 --> 01:06:04,421
I'm sorry,

2296
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:06,100
in the democratic functions are healthy.

2297
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,930
One of the biggest threats is,

2298
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:08,111
you know,

2299
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:08,830
Russia and Iran,

2300
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:09,251
Russia,

2301
01:06:09,251 --> 01:06:09,641
Iran,

2302
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:10,001
China,

2303
01:06:10,001 --> 01:06:12,160
they're trying to meddle in our
elections using your platform.

2304
01:06:12,161 --> 01:06:12,941
And it's effective.

2305
01:06:12,941 --> 01:06:15,550
So much so that you've actually
come out and removed many people.

2306
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:16,151
You know,

2307
01:06:16,151 --> 01:06:18,910
Covington was apparently started
by account base in Brazil.

2308
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:19,361
You know,

2309
01:06:19,361 --> 01:06:23,500
the Covington scandal where this fake
news goes viral was reported by CNN.

2310
01:06:23,501 --> 01:06:24,040
That was a,

2311
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:25,030
it was a dummy account.

2312
01:06:25,031 --> 01:06:27,700
They were trying to prop it up and they
were pushing out this out of context

2313
01:06:27,701 --> 01:06:28,534
information.

2314
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:29,620
So they do this,

2315
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,730
they use your platform to do it.

2316
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:36,380
You've now got a platform that is so
powerful in our American discourse that

2317
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:39,280
foreign governments are using
it as weapons against us.

2318
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,450
And you've taken a stance against
the laws of the United States.

2319
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:44,980
I don't mean like against
like you're breaking the law.

2320
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:45,890
I mean you,

2321
01:06:45,891 --> 01:06:49,060
you have rules that go beyond the scope
of the u s which will restrict American

2322
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,500
citizens from being able to participate.

2323
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:51,071
Meanwhile,

2324
01:06:51,071 --> 01:06:52,540
foreign actors are free to do so,

2325
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,070
so long as they play by your rules.

2326
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:58,150
So our elections are being threatened
by the fact that if there's an American

2327
01:06:58,151 --> 01:06:59,320
citizen who says,

2328
01:06:59,321 --> 01:07:01,840
I do not believe in your mis-gendering
policy and you bend them,

2329
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,570
that person has been removed
from public discourse on Twitter.

2330
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:04,781
Right.

2331
01:07:04,781 --> 01:07:06,950
But they don't get banned for
saying they don't agree with it.

2332
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:08,530
Sure.

2333
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:11,300
Specifically violating
it by targeting an inlet,

2334
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:14,440
let's say in protest and
individual repeatedly says,

2335
01:07:14,441 --> 01:07:14,741
no,

2336
01:07:14,741 --> 01:07:17,950
I refuse to use your pronouns in like
Megan Murphy's case and she's a Canadian,

2337
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,120
so I don't want to use her specifically.

2338
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,540
The point I'm trying to make is at a
certain level there are going to be

2339
01:07:22,541 --> 01:07:25,660
American citizens who have been removed
from this public discourse which has

2340
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,040
become so absurdly powerful.

2341
01:07:27,041 --> 01:07:30,370
Foreign governments weaponize it because
you have different rules than the

2342
01:07:30,371 --> 01:07:31,480
American country has.

2343
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:34,600
Just to be clear on my understanding,

2344
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:36,250
and I'm not an expert
on all the platforms,

2345
01:07:36,251 --> 01:07:37,780
is that foreign governments use multiple,

2346
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:42,400
multiple different ways to interfere in
elections and it's not limited to our

2347
01:07:42,401 --> 01:07:44,380
platform nor is that
limited to social media,

2348
01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:45,320
but the president does.

2349
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:49,000
I made her president is on a lot of
different platforms as as the White House.

2350
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:52,360
I think it's fair to point out the
media coverage of his Twitter account is

2351
01:07:52,361 --> 01:07:56,240
insane and they would run a new stories
every time he tweets and so certainly

2352
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:57,183
undeniable.

2353
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:01,330
I'm just pointing out that there are a
number of different avenues for this and

2354
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:03,550
individuals have choices and
how they use the platform,

2355
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,170
so valued to have other platforms,

2356
01:08:05,171 --> 01:08:08,740
but he uses Twitter as exclusively and
what I'm trying to bring up is that if

2357
01:08:08,741 --> 01:08:10,840
Twitter refuses to
acknowledge this problem,

2358
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:12,010
you are facing regulation.

2359
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:12,400
I don't,

2360
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,870
I don't know if you care about that,

2361
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,130
but at a certain point,

2362
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,213
which problem,

2363
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:16,700
if,

2364
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:20,150
if you're going to restrict American
citizens from participating on a platform

2365
01:08:20,151 --> 01:08:23,390
where even the president speaks and
it's essentially you have a private,

2366
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:25,160
privately owned public space,

2367
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:25,470
uh,

2368
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:25,710
if,

2369
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:29,960
if I could use an analogy that would be
most apt and you've set rules that are

2370
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:32,030
not recognized by the u s in fact,

2371
01:08:32,031 --> 01:08:34,010
when it came to a supreme
court hearing that said,

2372
01:08:34,011 --> 01:08:35,480
hate speech is not a violation,

2373
01:08:35,481 --> 01:08:36,710
it's actually protected free speech.

2374
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,390
So there's an actual odds.

2375
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,100
So there might be someone who says,

2376
01:08:40,101 --> 01:08:43,610
I refuse to live by any other means than
what the supreme court has sent down.

2377
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:45,020
That means I have a right to hate speech.

2378
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:45,913
You will bend them.

2379
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,020
That means your platform is so powerful.

2380
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:48,521
It's,

2381
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:52,310
it's being used to manipulate elections
and you have rules that are not

2382
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:55,160
recognized by the government to remove
American citizens from that discourse.

2383
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:56,450
So as a private platform,

2384
01:08:56,451 --> 01:09:01,130
you become too powerful
to not be regulated if you
refuse to allow people free

2385
01:09:01,131 --> 01:09:01,964
speech.

2386
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,700
But I'm trying to pick
apart the connection.

2387
01:09:06,910 --> 01:09:09,190
I think so,

2388
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:10,631
yes,

2389
01:09:10,631 --> 01:09:10,911
we,

2390
01:09:10,911 --> 01:09:12,640
we do have an issue with,

2391
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:13,503
um,

2392
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:17,230
foreign entities and misinformation and,

2393
01:09:17,231 --> 01:09:20,320
and this is a extremely complicated issue,

2394
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:25,030
which we're just beginning to
understand and grasp and take action on.

2395
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:31,170
I don't think that issue is solved
purely by not being more aggressive on

2396
01:09:34,181 --> 01:09:38,080
something else that is taking people
off the platform entirely as well,

2397
01:09:38,081 --> 01:09:40,210
which is abuse and harassment.

2398
01:09:40,780 --> 01:09:45,780
It's a cost benefit analysis ultimately
in our rules are designed again and you

2399
01:09:47,071 --> 01:09:47,170
know,

2400
01:09:47,170 --> 01:09:49,690
they don't always manifest
this way in the outcomes,

2401
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:54,040
but in terms of what we're trying to
drive is opportunity for every single

2402
01:09:54,041 --> 01:09:57,490
person to be able to speak
freely on the platform.

2403
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,080
And that's absolutely not true.

2404
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:01,270
You don't allow hate speech,

2405
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:02,081
hate speech.

2406
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:03,730
So free speech is not on your platform.

2407
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,260
I said,

2408
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:10,860
speak for everyone that create the
opportunity for everyone to speak on our

2409
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:12,663
service.

2410
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:13,503
Unless you Dave,

2411
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:14,711
it's hate speech.

2412
01:10:14,711 --> 01:10:14,861
Right?

2413
01:10:14,861 --> 01:10:15,360
And then

2414
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,193
part of that,

2415
01:10:16,290 --> 01:10:20,340
the recognition that we're taking action
on is that when some people encounter

2416
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:25,341
particular conduct that we see them
wanting to remove themselves from the

2417
01:10:26,401 --> 01:10:27,360
platform completely,

2418
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:31,620
which goes against that
principle of enabling everyone
to speak or giving people

2419
01:10:31,621 --> 01:10:36,060
the opportunity to speak are so rules
are focused on the the opportunities

2420
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:40,350
presented and we have particular outcomes
to make sure that those opportunities

2421
01:10:40,351 --> 01:10:40,570
are

2422
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,350
so as possible.

2423
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,501
Let's,

2424
01:10:41,501 --> 01:10:42,700
let's separate the first that the,

2425
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:45,660
the point I made about foreign
governments was just to explain the,

2426
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:45,951
the,

2427
01:10:45,951 --> 01:10:48,260
the power that your platform holds here.

2428
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:49,163
How can be weaponized?

2429
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:50,093
We'll separate that now.

2430
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,130
When antifa shows up to Berkeley and
bashes a guy over that with a bike lock

2431
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,870
that is suppressing his speech,

2432
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:56,411
right?

2433
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:57,430
That's a act of physical violence.

2434
01:10:57,431 --> 01:10:58,210
However,

2435
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:01,720
when antifa links hands and blocks the
door so that no one can go to an event

2436
01:11:02,050 --> 01:11:03,490
that is also legally allowed,

2437
01:11:03,790 --> 01:11:04,031
right?

2438
01:11:04,031 --> 01:11:07,450
So what you're saying is that if someone
is engaging in behavior such as going

2439
01:11:07,451 --> 01:11:10,240
on Twitter and shouting
someone down relentlessly,

2440
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,930
that's something external
to what happens in,

2441
01:11:13,150 --> 01:11:14,550
in the world under the u s government.

2442
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:19,350
I am allowed to scream very close to
you and not let you speak in public,

2443
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:21,060
but on Twitter you don't allow that.

2444
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,940
So there's a dramatic difference between
what Twitter thinks is okay and what

2445
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:25,290
the u s government thinks is okay.

2446
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,270
Our democracy functions
and how Twitter functions.

2447
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:31,710
The issue I'm pointing out is that
we know Twitter is becoming extremely

2448
01:11:31,711 --> 01:11:33,960
important in how our public
discourse is occurring,

2449
01:11:34,170 --> 01:11:37,170
how our culture is culture is
developing and who even gets elected.

2450
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:41,220
So if you have rules that
are based on a global policy,

2451
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:45,330
that means American citizens who are
abiding by all of the laws of our country

2452
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:47,730
are being restricted from engaging
in public discourse because you've

2453
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:48,420
monopolized it.

2454
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:49,500
Can I counter that though?

2455
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:52,230
Because these foreign governments
are restricted by the same rules.

2456
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,000
So if they violate those same rules,

2457
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:54,610
they will be,

2458
01:11:54,610 --> 01:11:55,470
they will be removed.

2459
01:11:55,471 --> 01:11:57,150
So play within those rules.

2460
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:00,480
They can participate in the discourse
even if they are just trying to manipulate

2461
01:12:00,481 --> 01:12:01,314
our elections.

2462
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:02,610
On the other hand,

2463
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:06,540
if the people that are on the
platform play by those rules,

2464
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:11,310
they can also counteract unless
their ideology goes in line with us.

2465
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:14,010
Law and on is legally allowed
as opposed to what you allow.

2466
01:12:14,011 --> 01:12:18,090
So foreign governments can can absolutely
keep making new accounts and keep

2467
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:19,380
building and keep manipulating.

2468
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,320
They can even post things that'll go
viral and then get banned and not care.

2469
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:22,770
Right.

2470
01:12:22,770 --> 01:12:24,330
But a private American citizen can say,

2471
01:12:24,331 --> 01:12:25,200
here's my opinion.

2472
01:12:25,201 --> 01:12:26,250
I refuse to back down.

2473
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:26,880
I see what you're saying.

2474
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:27,713
You will ban him.

2475
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,310
So we can see that at a certain
point you have a lot [inaudible].

2476
01:12:32,550 --> 01:12:34,100
Twitter is slowly gaining in,

2477
01:12:34,101 --> 01:12:34,741
in my opinion,

2478
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:38,670
too much control from your personal
ideology based on what you've researched,

2479
01:12:38,671 --> 01:12:41,520
what you think is right
over American discourse.

2480
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,450
If you,

2481
01:12:42,450 --> 01:12:43,140
if Twitter,

2482
01:12:43,140 --> 01:12:43,500
and this again,

2483
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,041
it's my opinion,

2484
01:12:44,041 --> 01:12:44,874
I'm not a lawmaker,

2485
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:50,120
but I would have to assume if Twitter
refuses to say in the United States you

2486
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:53,700
are allowed to say what is
legally acceptable period.

2487
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:57,270
Then lawmakers only choice will be to
enforce regulation on your company.

2488
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:57,941
Actually,

2489
01:12:57,941 --> 01:12:58,121
Tom,

2490
01:12:58,121 --> 01:13:01,240
I spend quite a bit of time talking
to lawmakers as part of my role,

2491
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:02,710
had a public policy.

2492
01:13:02,830 --> 01:13:03,230
Um,

2493
01:13:03,230 --> 01:13:04,600
I spent a lot of time in DC.

2494
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:09,220
I want to say the Jack and I have both
spent a lot of time in DC and I think

2495
01:13:09,250 --> 01:13:11,740
from the perspective of of lawmakers,

2496
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:12,640
um,

2497
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:17,590
they are across the spectrum
are also in favor of policing,

2498
01:13:17,650 --> 01:13:20,110
abuse and harassment
online and bullying online.

2499
01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:24,400
Well those are things that people care
about because they affect their children

2500
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,070
and if they affect their communities
and they fact individuals.

2501
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:30,010
And so I don't think that,

2502
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,551
and as a,

2503
01:13:30,551 --> 01:13:32,500
as a private American business,

2504
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:37,270
we can have different standards than
what an American government owned

2505
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,540
corporation or American government
would have to institute.

2506
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,160
Those are two different things.

2507
01:13:42,190 --> 01:13:42,910
American bit.

2508
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:46,060
And I understand your point about the
influence and I'm not denying that.

2509
01:13:46,061 --> 01:13:48,580
Certainly Twitter is an
influential platform,

2510
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,320
but like anything,

2511
01:13:50,321 --> 01:13:54,100
whether it's the American law or the
rules of Twitter or the rules of Facebook

2512
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,210
or wills of any platform,

2513
01:13:55,211 --> 01:13:57,580
there are rules and those
rules have to be followed.

2514
01:13:57,581 --> 01:14:01,030
So it is your choice whether to
follow those rules and to continue to

2515
01:14:01,031 --> 01:14:04,690
participate in a civic dialogue and
it's your choice to not do that.

2516
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,311
Absolutely.

2517
01:14:05,311 --> 01:14:09,150
You've monopolized public discourse to
an extreme degree and you say my way or

2518
01:14:09,151 --> 01:14:12,160
the highway we are facing
and we haven't monopolize

2519
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:12,281
it.

2520
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,730
There are many different avenues for
people to continue to have a voice.

2521
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:18,100
There are many different
platforms that offer that.

2522
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,960
We are a largely influential one.

2523
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:22,450
I'm not trying to take away from
that and we're a very important one.

2524
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:23,830
You don't need to be the most important.

2525
01:14:23,831 --> 01:14:26,730
It's just that you are
extremely important and that's,

2526
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:27,521
and that's a compliment.

2527
01:14:27,521 --> 01:14:29,470
Twitter has become extremely powerful,

2528
01:14:29,860 --> 01:14:33,040
but at a certain point you should not
have the right to control what people are

2529
01:14:33,041 --> 01:14:33,730
allowed to say.

2530
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:35,470
No private or look,

2531
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,520
I'm a social liberal.

2532
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,330
I think we should regulate
you guys because you are
unelected officials running

2533
01:14:40,331 --> 01:14:44,260
your system the way you see fit against
the wishes of a democratic republic.

2534
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,020
And there are people who disagree
with you or being excised from public

2535
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:48,760
discourse because of your ideology.

2536
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:49,960
That terrifies me.

2537
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:52,690
And we can take it one step
further just so I understand.

2538
01:14:52,690 --> 01:14:56,710
So are you suggesting that we
don't have any policies around,

2539
01:14:56,750 --> 01:14:56,860
uh,

2540
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:58,630
abuse and harassment on the platform?

2541
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,830
Um,

2542
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,110
I'm trying to understand what
it is I'm saying cause I'm not,

2543
01:15:02,111 --> 01:15:03,310
I'm not sure I'm following you.

2544
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:03,811
So you,

2545
01:15:03,811 --> 01:15:06,280
you don't think we should have any
rules about abuse and harassment.

2546
01:15:06,281 --> 01:15:07,300
So even that,

2547
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,750
the threats that you received
that you mentioned that we didn't,

2548
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:13,840
but you mentioned a number of threats
that you received in your quite frustrated

2549
01:15:13,841 --> 01:15:14,840
that we hadn't taken action on them.

2550
01:15:14,841 --> 01:15:16,270
That you think we shouldn't have roles.

2551
01:15:16,271 --> 01:15:18,520
That I'm frustrated
because of the hypocrisy.

2552
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,593
So when I,

2553
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,473
when I see,

2554
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:24,550
I see the flow of one direction and then
what I see are Republican politicians

2555
01:15:24,551 --> 01:15:25,041
who in my opinion,

2556
01:15:25,041 --> 01:15:27,460
you're just too ignorant to understand
what the hell is going on around them.

2557
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,040
And I see people burning
signs that say free speech.

2558
01:15:30,220 --> 01:15:31,990
I see you openly saying,

2559
01:15:32,290 --> 01:15:36,220
we recognize the power of our platform
and we're not going to abide by American

2560
01:15:36,221 --> 01:15:37,054
norms.

2561
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:41,050
I see the manipulation of Twitter
for in violation of our elections.

2562
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:41,591
I see.

2563
01:15:41,591 --> 01:15:46,120
Democratic operatives in Alabama waging
a false flag campaign using fake Russian

2564
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:47,080
accounts and the,

2565
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:47,471
and the,

2566
01:15:47,471 --> 01:15:50,980
and the guy who runs that company has
not been banned from your platform even

2567
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:52,510
after it's been written
by the New York Times.

2568
01:15:52,511 --> 01:15:53,344
He was doing this.

2569
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:56,740
So we know that not only are
people manipulating your platform,

2570
01:15:56,980 --> 01:16:00,940
you have rules that remove honest American
citizens with bad opinions who have a

2571
01:16:00,941 --> 01:16:02,470
right to engage in public discourse.

2572
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,670
And it's like you recognize it
but you like having the power.

2573
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:08,190
I'm not quite sure at what point,

2574
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:09,120
get back to my points.

2575
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:13,300
So you believe that Twitter should not
have any roles about abuse and harassment

2576
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:16,240
or any sort of hate speech on the
platform that that's your position.

2577
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:19,120
That's a extremely reductive.

2578
01:16:19,121 --> 01:16:20,560
I don't know that maybe too simplistic.

2579
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:21,850
The point I'm trying to make is,

2580
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,200
but ain't,

2581
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,001
you're trying to make your,

2582
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:28,570
you're asking us to comply with the u
s law that would criminalize potential

2583
01:16:28,571 --> 01:16:30,580
speech and put people in jail for it.

2584
01:16:30,581 --> 01:16:32,080
And you're asking us to enforce those,

2585
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:33,330
those terms while,

2586
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:34,960
I mean if you insight death,

2587
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:35,560
you will.

2588
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,640
That's a crime you can go,

2589
01:16:36,641 --> 01:16:37,474
you can go to jail for that.

2590
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:39,370
So at the very least you could,

2591
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,391
you like when you,

2592
01:16:40,391 --> 01:16:41,800
when you have people on your
platform who committed crime,

2593
01:16:41,801 --> 01:16:42,634
you don't ban them.

2594
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,031
I say,

2595
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:43,864
well that's really weird.

2596
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:46,300
And then when you have people on your
platform who say a bad naughty word,

2597
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:46,961
you do band them.

2598
01:16:46,961 --> 01:16:47,141
I say,

2599
01:16:47,141 --> 01:16:48,040
well that's really weird.

2600
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:49,580
I mean I've seen people get banned for,

2601
01:16:49,581 --> 01:16:50,980
for tweeting an end to you.

2602
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,520
I understand what they're trying to
do when they tweet letters at Uga,

2603
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,900
but they get suspended for
it and they get a threat.

2604
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:56,351
You know,

2605
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:57,070
like you can't,

2606
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:57,251
let's,

2607
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:58,390
let's talk about learning to code.

2608
01:16:59,060 --> 01:16:59,330
What do you,

2609
01:16:59,330 --> 01:17:00,170
what do you mean by that?

2610
01:17:03,010 --> 01:17:05,770
There are people who know that they
can tweet a single letter and the next

2611
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:07,150
person knows what letter
they need to tweet.

2612
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:08,201
You see what I'm saying?

2613
01:17:08,201 --> 01:17:09,034
So you'll see,

2614
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:09,561
you know,

2615
01:17:09,561 --> 01:17:10,040
one user

2616
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:12,400
we'll say and the next years or
we'll put an I the next user.

2617
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:13,753
Yes.

2618
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,860
And so they get suspended for doing so.

2619
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:16,361
And,

2620
01:17:16,361 --> 01:17:17,091
and these are,

2621
01:17:17,091 --> 01:17:19,730
these are the people who are trying
to push the buttons on the rules.

2622
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:20,773
Right?

2623
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:21,950
They get suspended for that.

2624
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:22,843
Absolutely.

2625
01:17:23,390 --> 01:17:23,960
So,

2626
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,940
because I think here's the thing,

2627
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:26,301
I think,

2628
01:17:26,301 --> 01:17:29,120
I think your team understands
what they're doing,

2629
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:32,090
however it gets really
dangerous territory.

2630
01:17:32,091 --> 01:17:32,421
If someone,

2631
01:17:32,421 --> 01:17:35,540
someone accidentally tweets an end and
you assume they're trying to engage in

2632
01:17:35,550 --> 01:17:36,261
harassment campaign,

2633
01:17:36,261 --> 01:17:38,690
which is why I said let's
talk about learning to code.

2634
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:39,230
But we do,

2635
01:17:39,230 --> 01:17:40,700
we do look at coordination of it,

2636
01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:43,400
of accounts or direct messages.

2637
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:45,150
Uh,

2638
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:46,710
I dunno about direct messages,

2639
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:48,450
but until you read the direct messages,

2640
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:49,650
we don't redirect messenger.

2641
01:17:49,651 --> 01:17:52,980
We don't read them unless someone reports
a direct message to us that they have

2642
01:17:52,981 --> 01:17:53,670
received.

2643
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:56,100
And so you read their direct
messages that they send to you.

2644
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:57,020
So if,

2645
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:00,650
if you have a direct message and someone
says something terrible and then like

2646
01:18:00,651 --> 01:18:03,020
you receive a death threat
and your report that to us,

2647
01:18:03,190 --> 01:18:03,890
then you receive,

2648
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:04,611
then we would read it.

2649
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:05,444
Cause you've reported it.

2650
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:05,960
Do,

2651
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:08,940
does anyone in the company have access
to direct messages other than that?

2652
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,420
Um,

2653
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,300
only in the context again of
reviewing reports that were,

2654
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:14,800
are not accessible.

2655
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:15,910
Um,

2656
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:16,870
not to my knowledge.

2657
01:18:17,710 --> 01:18:18,543
I don't know what you mean.

2658
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,570
We're not resemble,

2659
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,410
we're not reading them.

2660
01:18:20,410 --> 01:18:24,220
Is it possible that someone could go
into Tim's direct messages and just read

2661
01:18:24,221 --> 01:18:25,180
his direct messages?

2662
01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:25,960
I don't think so.

2663
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:29,560
So if Tim writes an n and I
write an I and Jamie writes a,

2664
01:18:29,561 --> 01:18:29,921
Gee,

2665
01:18:29,921 --> 01:18:31,900
can you go into our
direct messages and say,

2666
01:18:31,901 --> 01:18:32,500
Hey,

2667
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,520
let's fuck with Jack and we're going to
write this stuff out and we're going to

2668
01:18:36,521 --> 01:18:38,620
do it and let's see if they banned us.

2669
01:18:39,450 --> 01:18:40,283
You can't read that?

2670
01:18:41,100 --> 01:18:41,933
I don't think so.

2671
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,030
So if that's the case,

2672
01:18:43,060 --> 01:18:45,250
I don't want to know if
there was a concerted effort.

2673
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:46,660
I think what he's saying,

2674
01:18:46,661 --> 01:18:46,931
I was like,

2675
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:47,231
if we,

2676
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:51,100
if we do see those train
of replies and that is,

2677
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:51,993
that is coordination.

2678
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:52,501
You know,

2679
01:18:52,501 --> 01:18:53,334
what people are doing,

2680
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,281
the point of showing,

2681
01:18:54,281 --> 01:18:55,200
like how do you prove it?

2682
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:56,220
Well,

2683
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:58,370
I think beyond the end,

2684
01:18:58,840 --> 01:18:59,220
you know,

2685
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:00,390
the first person or with a letter,

2686
01:19:00,391 --> 01:19:01,260
you can't prove he did it,

2687
01:19:01,261 --> 01:19:01,891
but everybody else,

2688
01:19:01,891 --> 01:19:02,500
you kind of can.

2689
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:02,880
I don't,

2690
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:03,870
but I don't think we would.

2691
01:19:04,290 --> 01:19:04,501
Well,

2692
01:19:04,501 --> 01:19:05,030
I've,

2693
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:05,370
look,

2694
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:05,971
I can say this,

2695
01:19:05,971 --> 01:19:08,010
I've been sent numerous
screenshots from people.

2696
01:19:08,011 --> 01:19:08,844
Screenshots can be faked.

2697
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:09,391
I recognize it,

2698
01:19:09,391 --> 01:19:11,940
but I've seen people actually tweet.

2699
01:19:12,210 --> 01:19:14,670
And then I've seen the tweet
follow right after one.

2700
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:15,340
One letter though.

2701
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:15,481
Yeah.

2702
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:18,030
Someone tweeted at you a
someone decently high profile,

2703
01:19:18,031 --> 01:19:20,580
like a big youtuber tweeted an end
at you and then got like a 12 hour

2704
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:21,414
suspension.

2705
01:19:22,430 --> 01:19:23,760
But let's talk about learning to code.

2706
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:24,380
Right.

2707
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:28,260
And why are people being suspended
for ta tweeting Hashtag learn to code?

2708
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:29,223
Yup.

2709
01:19:29,310 --> 01:19:30,460
We did some research on this.

2710
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:31,630
Yes,

2711
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:32,710
we did some research on us.

2712
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:33,573
Um,

2713
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:35,150
so there was a situation,

2714
01:19:35,230 --> 01:19:40,230
I guess about a month ago or so where
a number of journalists or receiving a

2715
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,450
variety of tweets,

2716
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,020
um,

2717
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:46,540
some containing a learn to code,

2718
01:19:46,570 --> 01:19:49,120
some containing a bunch of other,

2719
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:49,990
um,

2720
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,330
coded language that was wishes of harm.

2721
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:56,020
And these were thousands and thousands
of tweets being directed at a handful of

2722
01:19:56,021 --> 01:19:56,854
journalists.

2723
01:19:56,980 --> 01:19:59,800
And we did some research
and what we found was,

2724
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:00,370
uh,

2725
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:03,730
a number of the accounts that
we're engaging in this behavior,

2726
01:20:03,731 --> 01:20:06,970
which is tweeting at the journalist
with this either learn to code or things

2727
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:10,050
like day of the rope and
other coded language.

2728
01:20:10,260 --> 01:20:10,531
Uh,

2729
01:20:10,531 --> 01:20:11,460
we're actually,

2730
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:11,820
um,

2731
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:12,990
Ban of Asian accounts.

2732
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:15,480
That means accounts that have
been previously suspended.

2733
01:20:15,780 --> 01:20:19,890
And we also learned that there was a
targeted campaign being organized off our

2734
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:22,620
platform to abuse and
harass these journalists.

2735
01:20:22,650 --> 01:20:23,483
That's not true.

2736
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:25,391
Does he see,

2737
01:20:25,391 --> 01:20:25,930
here's the thing,

2738
01:20:25,930 --> 01:20:29,480
an activist who works for NBC
wrote to that story and then lobby.

2739
01:20:29,481 --> 01:20:29,831
Do you,

2740
01:20:29,831 --> 01:20:33,130
you issued an official statement and then
even the editor and chief of the daily

2741
01:20:33,131 --> 01:20:34,690
caller got a suspension for tweeting,

2742
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:35,500
learn to code at the day,

2743
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,333
at the daily show.

2744
01:20:36,370 --> 01:20:39,980
So I have never talked to anybody
from NBC about this issue.

2745
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:41,170
No.

2746
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:43,030
So they reported don't misrepresent me.

2747
01:20:43,031 --> 01:20:46,000
They report it at the narrative goes
far and wide amongst your circles.

2748
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:49,000
Then all of a sudden you're seeing high
profile conservatives tweeting a joke,

2749
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:49,870
getting suspensions.

2750
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,110
So again,

2751
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:54,200
some of these tweets actually contained,

2752
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:55,100
um,

2753
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:55,933
death threats,

2754
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,080
wishes of harm,

2755
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,290
other coded language
that we've seen to mean,

2756
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:01,250
um,

2757
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,810
death to journalists.

2758
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:05,690
So it wasn't about just the learn to code,

2759
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,030
it was about the context of it.

2760
01:21:07,190 --> 01:21:07,530
Can we,

2761
01:21:07,530 --> 01:21:07,870
come on,

2762
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:08,820
that's not true.

2763
01:21:08,950 --> 01:21:09,810
That's just not true.

2764
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:12,930
The editor in chief of the daily caller
was suspended for tweeting nothing but

2765
01:21:12,931 --> 01:21:14,070
hashtag learn to code.

2766
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:15,671
Sorry Tim,

2767
01:21:15,671 --> 01:21:16,090
can I,

2768
01:21:16,090 --> 01:21:16,990
can I finish what I'm saying?

2769
01:21:17,260 --> 01:21:17,530
Yeah.

2770
01:21:17,530 --> 01:21:20,140
So we were looking at the context
and what was happening is there were

2771
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:21,880
journalists receiving hundreds of tweets,

2772
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,500
some had death threats,

2773
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:24,550
some had wishes of harm,

2774
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:25,720
some just learn to code.

2775
01:21:26,170 --> 01:21:28,420
And in that particular
context we made a decision,

2776
01:21:28,421 --> 01:21:29,170
we consider this,

2777
01:21:29,170 --> 01:21:31,060
this type of behavior about dog piling,

2778
01:21:31,061 --> 01:21:35,380
which is when all of a sudden individuals
are getting tons and tons of tweets at

2779
01:21:35,381 --> 01:21:35,740
them.

2780
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:37,630
They feel very abused or
harassed on the clock.

2781
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:38,481
Can we pause this?

2782
01:21:38,481 --> 01:21:38,830
Cause this,

2783
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:40,940
we're super confusing for people
who don't know the context.

2784
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:45,200
The learn to code thing is in response
to people saying that people that are

2785
01:21:45,201 --> 01:21:49,280
losing their jobs like coal miners and
truck drivers and things like that,

2786
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:50,690
we could learn to code.

2787
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:51,620
This was,

2788
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:56,620
it was almost like ingest initially or
if it wasn't ingest initially it was so

2789
01:21:56,691 --> 01:22:00,440
poorly thought out as a suggestion
that pizza started mocking it.

2790
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:00,850
Right?

2791
01:22:00,850 --> 01:22:01,150
Correct.

2792
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:01,880
So that's correct.

2793
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,010
The first stories that came out were
simply like Ken miners learn to code.

2794
01:22:05,030 --> 01:22:06,070
There was no liners.

2795
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:06,380
Right,

2796
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:09,590
and they'll hashtag learn
to code is just a meme.

2797
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,140
It's not even necessarily a
conservative one that you will see more

2798
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:12,930
conservatives using.

2799
01:22:12,930 --> 01:22:15,590
It was people are using
it to mock how stupid.

2800
01:22:15,591 --> 01:22:19,510
The idea of taking a person who's on an
educators in their 50s who should our

2801
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:24,790
learn some new form of vocation and then
someone says learn to code and so then

2802
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:27,800
other people when they're losing their
job or when something's happening,

2803
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:28,701
people would write,

2804
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:30,800
learn to code because it's a mean.

2805
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:31,300
Well,

2806
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,270
not even necessarily.

2807
01:22:32,271 --> 01:22:32,601
I would,

2808
01:22:32,601 --> 01:22:33,710
I would just characterize,

2809
01:22:33,711 --> 01:22:38,630
learn to code as a meme that represents
the elitism of modern journalists and

2810
01:22:38,631 --> 01:22:40,910
how they target certain
communities with disdain.

2811
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:41,330
Okay.

2812
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:41,511
So,

2813
01:22:41,511 --> 01:22:42,210
so to,

2814
01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:42,410
to,

2815
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:43,150
to make that point,

2816
01:22:43,150 --> 01:22:45,440
there are people who have been
suspended for tweeting something.

2817
01:22:45,441 --> 01:22:47,810
Like I'm not too happy with how,

2818
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:48,021
you know,

2819
01:22:48,021 --> 01:22:49,700
buzzfeed reported the story
Hashtag learn to code,

2820
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:50,090
right?

2821
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:54,020
Making representation of these people
are snooty elites who live in ivory

2822
01:22:54,021 --> 01:22:54,830
towers.

2823
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:55,460
But uh,

2824
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:55,881
but,

2825
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:56,714
but again,

2826
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:57,441
you know,

2827
01:22:57,441 --> 01:22:59,900
this is a meme that has
nothing to do with harassment,

2828
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:00,591
but you know,

2829
01:23:00,591 --> 01:23:00,711
it's,

2830
01:23:00,711 --> 01:23:02,190
some people might be
harassing somebody in,

2831
01:23:02,191 --> 01:23:02,990
might tweet it.

2832
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:04,550
Why would we expect to see,

2833
01:23:04,580 --> 01:23:05,290
even still,

2834
01:23:05,290 --> 01:23:07,330
I'm still getting messages from people
with screenshots saying I've been

2835
01:23:07,331 --> 01:23:10,960
suspended for using a Hashtag and the
editor in chief of the daily caller,

2836
01:23:11,290 --> 01:23:11,620
right?

2837
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:11,821
He,

2838
01:23:11,821 --> 01:23:12,041
he,

2839
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:12,221
he,

2840
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:12,640
he,

2841
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:12,881
he took,

2842
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:13,301
he quote,

2843
01:23:13,301 --> 01:23:16,900
tweeted a video from the daily show
with Hashtag learn to code and he got a

2844
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:17,734
suspension for it.

2845
01:23:17,860 --> 01:23:18,580
So why,

2846
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,750
why learn to code?

2847
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:22,530
Why is that alone so egregious?

2848
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:24,290
And I don't think it is so gracious.

2849
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:26,590
So is it just something that
got stuck in an algorithm?

2850
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:27,121
Uh,

2851
01:23:27,121 --> 01:23:27,451
no.

2852
01:23:27,451 --> 01:23:28,284
It was a,

2853
01:23:28,440 --> 01:23:28,801
again,

2854
01:23:28,801 --> 01:23:30,930
a specific set of issues
that we were seeing.

2855
01:23:30,990 --> 01:23:35,760
I'm targeting a very specific
set of journalists and it
wasn't just the learn to

2856
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:36,091
code,

2857
01:23:36,091 --> 01:23:37,950
it was a couple of things going on.

2858
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:40,650
A lot of the accounts tweeting
learn to code where band invaders,

2859
01:23:40,651 --> 01:23:42,360
which means it curiously been suspended.

2860
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:45,950
A lot of the accounts had other
language in them are of tweets out other

2861
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,200
language like day of the brick
day of the rope of ready.

2862
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:53,310
These are all coded meanings
for violence against people.

2863
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:53,750
Right.

2864
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:54,060
Um,

2865
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:54,893
and so,

2866
01:23:55,020 --> 01:23:56,670
and the people who are receiving this,

2867
01:23:56,671 --> 01:24:01,290
we're receiving hundreds of these in
what appeared to us to be a coordinated

2868
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,460
harassment campaign.

2869
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:06,030
And so we were trying to understand the
context of what was going on and take

2870
01:24:06,031 --> 01:24:06,864
action on them.

2871
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,590
Because again,

2872
01:24:07,590 --> 01:24:08,160
I don't know,

2873
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:08,461
Joe,

2874
01:24:08,461 --> 01:24:11,670
if you've ever been the target
of a dog piling event on Twitter,

2875
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:16,230
but it is not particularly fun when
thousands of people or hundreds of people

2876
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:18,630
are tweeting at you and saying things.

2877
01:24:18,630 --> 01:24:21,330
And that's can be viewed
as a form of harassment.

2878
01:24:21,350 --> 01:24:23,100
And it's not about the individual tweet.

2879
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:26,300
It is about the volume of things
that are being directed at you.

2880
01:24:26,301 --> 01:24:27,090
You understand.

2881
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:28,500
And so in that particular case,

2882
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:30,990
we made the judgment call
and it is a judgment call,

2883
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:31,890
um,

2884
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:36,890
to take down the tweets that
were responding directly
to these journalists that

2885
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:41,790
were saying learn to code even if they
didn't have a wish of harm specifically

2886
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:45,390
attached to them because of what
we viewed as coordinated attempt,

2887
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:46,180
uh,

2888
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:46,891
to harass them.

2889
01:24:46,891 --> 01:24:47,790
And again,

2890
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:48,331
like I was saying,

2891
01:24:48,331 --> 01:24:52,110
some of the other signals and coded
language and we were worried that learn to

2892
01:24:52,111 --> 01:24:55,500
code was taking on a different meaning.

2893
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:57,420
I understand what in
that particular context.

2894
01:24:58,410 --> 01:24:58,771
So,

2895
01:24:58,771 --> 01:25:00,990
but in and of itself though,

2896
01:25:00,991 --> 01:25:05,520
it's still seems like there's
alternative meanings to learn to code.

2897
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,850
It still could be used as
Tim was saying to mark,

2898
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:09,450
uh,

2899
01:25:09,450 --> 01:25:09,721
you know,

2900
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:10,141
elite,

2901
01:25:10,141 --> 01:25:10,751
snooty,

2902
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:11,040
okay.

2903
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,730
Yes,

2904
01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:12,180
yes,

2905
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:12,780
absolutely.

2906
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:13,411
I agree with you.

2907
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:16,950
So it's really about the context of what
was happening in that situation and all

2908
01:25:16,951 --> 01:25:17,784
those other things.

2909
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:21,210
I think in a very different situation
we would not take action on that.

2910
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:21,880
Hmm.

2911
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:22,420
Okay.

2912
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,520
But does not seem like your,

2913
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:28,240
you're throwing a blanket
over a very small issue.

2914
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:29,140
Um,

2915
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,080
I think you learned to code
in itself is very small.

2916
01:25:32,081 --> 01:25:34,000
The blanket is cast over racism.

2917
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:36,010
The blanket is cast over this,

2918
01:25:36,011 --> 01:25:38,440
all the other horrible things
that are attached to it,

2919
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,160
but the horrible things
that are attached to it,

2920
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,013
the real issue,

2921
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:45,730
this learn to code thing is kind of a
legitimate protest in people saying that

2922
01:25:45,731 --> 01:25:47,140
these minors should learn to code.

2923
01:25:47,141 --> 01:25:48,190
That's kind of preposterous.

2924
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,930
The first articles weren't mean.

2925
01:25:50,050 --> 01:25:52,720
It was just it learn to
code kind of identified.

2926
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:56,380
You have these journalists who are so
far removed from Middle America that they

2927
01:25:56,381 --> 01:25:59,230
think you can take a 50 year old man
who's never used a computer before and put

2928
01:25:59,231 --> 01:25:59,810
them in a,

2929
01:25:59,810 --> 01:26:00,350
you know,

2930
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:01,810
the stories I think were legitimate.

2931
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:02,330
Yes.

2932
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:04,140
But the point more so is

2933
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:04,851
it was a meme.

2934
01:26:04,851 --> 01:26:09,140
The hashtag the idea of learn
to code condenses this idea.

2935
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:10,310
And it's easy to communicate,

2936
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:13,790
especially when you only have
280 characters that there
is a class of individual

2937
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:14,570
in this country.

2938
01:26:14,570 --> 01:26:15,610
I think you mentioned on uh,

2939
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:17,180
was it Sam Harris that the left,

2940
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,900
the left liberal journalists
only follow each other in the,

2941
01:26:20,901 --> 01:26:22,250
in the run up to the 25th,

2942
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,450
2016 elections.

2943
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,930
Yeah.

2944
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:24,440
And so,

2945
01:26:24,440 --> 01:26:24,950
uh,

2946
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:27,950
I mean I s I still believe that to be
true and I've worked in these offices.

2947
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:28,873
It has changed.

2948
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,090
They've done the study
on the visualization and
other is a lot more cross

2949
01:26:32,091 --> 01:26:32,661
pollination.

2950
01:26:32,661 --> 01:26:33,050
But we,

2951
01:26:33,050 --> 01:26:37,850
what we saw is a folks who are bordering
on the left and on a spectrum mainly

2952
01:26:37,851 --> 01:26:41,000
followed folks on the left
and folks on the right fold.

2953
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:41,510
Everyone,

2954
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,691
right.

2955
01:26:41,691 --> 01:26:44,030
You were talking about earlier
that there's these bubbles,

2956
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:44,570
there's,

2957
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:47,510
there's bubbles and we've helped
create them and maintain them.

2958
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:48,591
So,

2959
01:26:48,591 --> 01:26:51,410
so here's what ends up happening and this
is one of the big problems that people

2960
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:52,910
have with this story.

2961
01:26:52,911 --> 01:26:53,690
Particularly,

2962
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:57,140
particularly you have a left wing
activist who works for NBC News.

2963
01:26:57,170 --> 01:26:58,730
I'm not accusing you of
having read the article.

2964
01:26:59,000 --> 01:26:59,451
He right.

2965
01:26:59,451 --> 01:26:59,631
He,

2966
01:26:59,631 --> 01:26:59,931
he's,

2967
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:01,070
he spends a uh,

2968
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:03,230
like a day lobbying to Twitter saying,

2969
01:27:03,231 --> 01:27:03,510
guys,

2970
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:04,161
you have to do this.

2971
01:27:04,161 --> 01:27:05,120
You have to make these changes.

2972
01:27:05,450 --> 01:27:08,570
The next day he writes a story saying
that four Chan is organizing these,

2973
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:08,870
these,

2974
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:12,770
these harassment campaigns and death
threats and while four Chan was doing

2975
01:27:12,771 --> 01:27:13,551
threads about it,

2976
01:27:13,551 --> 01:27:15,460
you can't accuse fortune simply
for talking about cause right.

2977
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,090
It was talking about it
too as what's Twitter.

2978
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:19,670
So then the next day he,

2979
01:27:19,671 --> 01:27:20,780
after he published his article,

2980
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:25,370
now he's getting threats and then Twitter
issues a statement saying we will take

2981
01:27:25,371 --> 01:27:26,870
action and to make matters worse,

2982
01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:28,460
when John Levine,

2983
01:27:28,461 --> 01:27:29,360
a writer for the rap,

2984
01:27:29,390 --> 01:27:31,850
got a statement from one of
your spokespeople saying,

2985
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:32,900
yes,

2986
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:34,850
we are banning people
for saying learn to code.

2987
01:27:35,510 --> 01:27:37,580
A bunch of journalists
came out and then lied.

2988
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:39,440
I had no idea why he's
saying this is not true.

2989
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:40,274
This is fake news.

2990
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:43,340
Then a second statement was published
by Twitter saying it's part of a

2991
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:44,300
harassment campaign.

2992
01:27:44,660 --> 01:27:46,490
And so then the mainstream
narrative becomes,

2993
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:47,151
oh,

2994
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:49,250
they're only banning people who
are part of a harassment campaign.

2995
01:27:49,251 --> 01:27:49,601
But you,

2996
01:27:49,601 --> 01:27:53,070
you literally see legitimate high profile
individuals getting suspensions for,

2997
01:27:53,071 --> 01:27:54,350
for joining us on a joke.

2998
01:27:54,690 --> 01:27:54,950
Oh,

2999
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:55,810
they're there for sure.

3000
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:56,840
Probably mistakes in there.

3001
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,990
I don't think that any of us are claiming
that we've got that's 100% right and

3002
01:27:59,991 --> 01:28:03,440
probably our team having a lack of context
and to actually what's happening as

3003
01:28:03,441 --> 01:28:03,740
well.

3004
01:28:03,740 --> 01:28:08,630
And we would fully admit we probably
were way too aggressive when we first saw

3005
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:10,370
this and made mistakes.

3006
01:28:11,190 --> 01:28:12,050
I hope this clarifies.

3007
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:14,000
Then you have situations
like this where you can see,

3008
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:14,421
you know,

3009
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:14,511
the,

3010
01:28:14,511 --> 01:28:15,141
this journalist,

3011
01:28:15,141 --> 01:28:15,891
I'm not going to name him,

3012
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:19,290
but he routinely has very like left wing,

3013
01:28:19,310 --> 01:28:21,770
I don't want to use
overtly a esoteric words,

3014
01:28:21,771 --> 01:28:22,670
but uh,

3015
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,700
intersectional dogmatic points of view.

3016
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:26,330
Right?

3017
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:27,700
So this is considered me.

3018
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:32,300
So like intersectional feminism is
considered like a small ideology.

3019
01:28:32,450 --> 01:28:36,050
It people refer to these groups as the
regressive left or the identitarian left.

3020
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,260
These are basically people who hold views
that a person is judged based on the

3021
01:28:39,261 --> 01:28:41,870
color of their skin instead of
the content of their character.

3022
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:44,150
So you have the right wing version
of which is like the ultra right,

3023
01:28:44,450 --> 01:28:45,290
the left wing version,

3024
01:28:45,291 --> 01:28:46,190
which is like,

3025
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:47,053
um,

3026
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:48,490
intersectional feminism is,

3027
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:48,791
is,

3028
01:28:48,791 --> 01:28:49,880
is how simple referred to.

3029
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:52,490
So you'll see people say things like,

3030
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:52,731
you know,

3031
01:28:52,731 --> 01:28:53,481
when they typically,

3032
01:28:53,481 --> 01:28:56,420
when they rag on white men or
when they say like white feminism,

3033
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:56,900
these are,

3034
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:59,390
these are signals that they
hold these particular views.

3035
01:28:59,630 --> 01:28:59,891
And these are,

3036
01:28:59,891 --> 01:29:00,950
these are becoming more pervasive.

3037
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:03,810
What ends up happening is you have a
journalist who clearly holds these views.

3038
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:04,920
I don't you want to call him a journalist.

3039
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:08,130
He writes extremely biased
and out of context story,

3040
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:10,200
Twitter takes action in response,

3041
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:11,430
a seemingly in response.

3042
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:14,250
Then we can look what happens
with Oliver Darcy at CNN.

3043
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,091
He says,

3044
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:15,480
you know,

3045
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,030
the people at Seapak are the conservatives
are gullible eating red meat from

3046
01:29:18,031 --> 01:29:18,361
grifters,

3047
01:29:18,361 --> 01:29:18,961
among other things,

3048
01:29:18,961 --> 01:29:20,490
disparaging comments about the right.

3049
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:23,970
And he's the one who's primarily
advocating for the removal of certain

3050
01:29:23,971 --> 01:29:25,500
individuals who you then remove.

3051
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:27,420
And then when Kathy
Griffin calls for Doxing,

3052
01:29:27,421 --> 01:29:28,170
that's fine.

3053
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:28,751
When this guy,

3054
01:29:28,751 --> 01:29:30,240
he calls for the death of these kids,

3055
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:30,930
he gets,

3056
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:32,380
he gets a slap on the wrist and,

3057
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:32,791
and look,

3058
01:29:32,791 --> 01:29:34,170
I understand the context matters,

3059
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:37,410
but grains of sand to make a heat and
eventually you have all of these stories

3060
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:40,770
piling up and people are asking you
why it only flows in one direction.

3061
01:29:40,890 --> 01:29:41,910
Because I gotta I gotta be honest.

3062
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:45,540
I'd imagine that calling for the death
three times of any individuals or bandit

3063
01:29:45,541 --> 01:29:46,200
ball offense,

3064
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:46,921
even without a warning,

3065
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:47,754
he just get rid of him.

3066
01:29:48,270 --> 01:29:49,260
But it didn't happen.

3067
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:50,340
Right.

3068
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:50,701
We see,

3069
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:51,481
we see these,

3070
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:51,751
you know,

3071
01:29:51,751 --> 01:29:52,900
people say men aren't women though,

3072
01:29:52,910 --> 01:29:53,731
and they get a suspension.

3073
01:29:53,731 --> 01:29:56,000
We see people say the editor
and chief of the daily caller,

3074
01:29:56,010 --> 01:29:58,380
maybe the best example
Hashtag learned to code,

3075
01:29:58,460 --> 01:29:58,700
uh,

3076
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,450
quoting the daily show
and you get to suspension,

3077
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:04,490
just threatening death and inciting
death is a suspension to it.

3078
01:30:04,491 --> 01:30:06,480
If it feels like it's only
going in one direction.

3079
01:30:07,060 --> 01:30:07,250
Yeah,

3080
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,440
I think we have a lot of work to do to
explain more clearly when we're taking

3081
01:30:10,441 --> 01:30:11,274
action and why.

3082
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:16,140
And certainly looking into any mistakes
we may have made in those particular

3083
01:30:16,150 --> 01:30:16,983
situation.

3084
01:30:17,210 --> 01:30:18,390
Breathe that in tech.

3085
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,530
I think we can all agree this,

3086
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:19,710
oh,

3087
01:30:19,710 --> 01:30:23,070
I would hope you agree
tech tends to lean left

3088
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:26,330
like tech companies,

3089
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:27,290
Facebook,

3090
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:27,980
Twitter,

3091
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:28,750
Google.

3092
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:32,830
I I would be willing to bet
that a conservative running
a social network would

3093
01:30:32,831 --> 01:30:33,910
not have a hate speech policy.

3094
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,990
I mean you look at Gab and you look at
mines and mines not even right wing.

3095
01:30:36,991 --> 01:30:37,100
Yeah,

3096
01:30:37,100 --> 01:30:37,341
right.

3097
01:30:37,341 --> 01:30:38,270
They're not right wing at all.

3098
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:38,780
They're just,

3099
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:41,210
they just staunchly support free speech.

3100
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:41,360
Right,

3101
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:41,511
right.

3102
01:30:41,511 --> 01:30:43,250
I don't think gab is necessarily,

3103
01:30:43,251 --> 01:30:45,530
I don't think the owner is
necessarily right when either,

3104
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,670
I don't know much about him.

3105
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:48,080
I think he's like a libertarian.

3106
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:49,380
I don't want to,

3107
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:49,670
uh,

3108
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,230
I don't want to specify either.

3109
01:30:51,231 --> 01:30:51,541
I don't know.

3110
01:30:51,541 --> 01:30:52,400
I don't know enough.

3111
01:30:52,590 --> 01:30:53,660
But I know that there,

3112
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:55,520
when you read what they write,

3113
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:59,030
they're just staunchly
committed to free speech.

3114
01:30:59,330 --> 01:30:59,671
But they,

3115
01:30:59,671 --> 01:30:59,931
you know,

3116
01:30:59,931 --> 01:31:01,070
stop doxing.

3117
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:01,431
They will,

3118
01:31:01,431 --> 01:31:05,840
they will do things to stop targeted
harassment and doxing and things along

3119
01:31:05,841 --> 01:31:06,560
those lines.

3120
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,760
Sometimes slowly,

3121
01:31:07,940 --> 01:31:08,773
admittedly.

3122
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:10,303
But they want,

3123
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:12,170
they just want an open platform.

3124
01:31:12,530 --> 01:31:17,530
What my point is is that I think a lot
of people that are on the right feel

3125
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:21,770
disenfranchised by these platforms
that they use on a daily basis.

3126
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:23,450
I don't know what the percentage are.

3127
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:27,170
The percentages are in terms of the number
of people that are conservative that

3128
01:31:27,171 --> 01:31:29,090
use Twitter versus the number
of people that are liberal,

3129
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,610
but I would imagine it's
probably pretty close,

3130
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:32,923
isn't it?

3131
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:34,970
I don't know the numbers.

3132
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,920
I don't know because we don't ask people,

3133
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:38,140
but then we'd have to,

3134
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:39,350
we'd have to infer all that.

3135
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:39,640
Okay.

3136
01:31:39,640 --> 01:31:41,150
Based on what we're saying or because,

3137
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:42,080
so let's not even go there,

3138
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:42,740
but then,

3139
01:31:42,740 --> 01:31:43,600
but the,

3140
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:44,000
the,

3141
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,170
the people that run,

3142
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,870
whether it's Google or
Twitter or Facebook,

3143
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,240
any of these platforms,

3144
01:31:50,270 --> 01:31:51,290
Youtube for sure.

3145
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,500
Powerful leaning towards the left.

3146
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:55,900
Okay.

3147
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:56,920
When we all agree to that,

3148
01:31:57,750 --> 01:31:58,870
we don't ask our employees,

3149
01:31:59,110 --> 01:32:00,250
but my guess is

3150
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:03,670
that many employees at tech
companies are probably liberal.

3151
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,930
It's really fascinating,

3152
01:32:04,990 --> 01:32:05,741
but I also think,

3153
01:32:05,741 --> 01:32:05,950
yeah,

3154
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:06,570
I mean your point,

3155
01:32:06,570 --> 01:32:06,891
oh,

3156
01:32:06,891 --> 01:32:11,410
all the companies you mentioned are
in exactly the same region as well.

3157
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,420
We do.

3158
01:32:13,450 --> 01:32:13,751
You know,

3159
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:18,580
we do have the challenge of some
monocultural thinking as well,

3160
01:32:18,581 --> 01:32:20,440
but we,

3161
01:32:20,441 --> 01:32:21,040
and we,

3162
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:21,311
you know,

3163
01:32:21,311 --> 01:32:22,630
I have said publicly that,

3164
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:23,260
you know,

3165
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:27,670
yes we will have more of a
liberal bias within our company,

3166
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:28,720
so this to CNN,

3167
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,310
but that doesn't mean that
we put that in our rules.

3168
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:34,173
Right?

3169
01:32:34,210 --> 01:32:38,290
But hold on because what I'm getting
at is that at some point in time things

3170
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:42,220
have to get down to a human being
looking and reviewing a cases.

3171
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:47,290
And if you guys are so left wing in your,

3172
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:48,910
your,

3173
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:52,480
your staff and the area that you
live in and all of these things,

3174
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:57,660
things are almost naturally going to lean
left if is that fair to say if we were

3175
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,820
purely looking at the content,

3176
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,670
but a lot of this agent work
is based on the behaviors,

3177
01:33:03,671 --> 01:33:07,270
all the things that we've been discussing
in terms of the context of the actual

3178
01:33:07,450 --> 01:33:08,283
content itself,

3179
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:10,180
what the roles are,

3180
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:11,290
the mis-gendering policy,

3181
01:33:11,291 --> 01:33:11,500
right?

3182
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:11,861
So your,

3183
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:13,450
your rules do reflect your,

3184
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,260
your bubble,

3185
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:14,441
right.

3186
01:33:14,441 --> 01:33:15,191
Go to the middle and you know,

3187
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:17,020
go to middle America and go
hang out at a conservative town.

3188
01:33:17,021 --> 01:33:18,160
They're not going to agree with you.

3189
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:21,400
Your rules are based on your bubble
in San Francisco or whatever city.

3190
01:33:21,720 --> 01:33:22,810
I'm from Middle America,

3191
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:23,441
I'm from Saint Louis,

3192
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:23,920
Missouri.

3193
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,260
And I hear the point.

3194
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:29,800
I definitely hear the point in terms
of like us putting this rule forth,

3195
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:33,490
but we have to balance it with the fact
that people are being driven away from

3196
01:33:33,491 --> 01:33:34,324
our platform.

3197
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:35,380
And they may not disagree.

3198
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:37,060
They may not agree with me on that.

3199
01:33:37,210 --> 01:33:38,050
My folks from Missouri,

3200
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:43,051
but I think they would see some valid
argument and what we're trying to do to

3201
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:44,410
again,

3202
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:47,260
increase the opportunity for as
many people as possible to talk.

3203
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:48,363
That's,

3204
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:48,850
that's it.

3205
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:51,760
It's not driving the new that
you're speaking to where you stop,

3206
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:52,700
what,

3207
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:56,110
what community is and isn't deserving
of protection are conservatives not

3208
01:33:56,111 --> 01:33:57,670
deserving of protection
for their opinions.

3209
01:33:57,970 --> 01:34:02,800
But I want to focus in
a way on individuals and
increasing the absolute number

3210
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:05,770
of people who have opportunity to speak
on the platform in the first place.

3211
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:08,050
So then do you need a
rule for a body dysphoria?

3212
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:09,460
Do you need a rule for other kin?

3213
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:10,340
Right?

3214
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,200
You see what I'm asking you?

3215
01:34:11,310 --> 01:34:11,520
You,

3216
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,071
you have a specific,

3217
01:34:12,071 --> 01:34:12,904
I see what you're asking me.

3218
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:13,361
Like,

3219
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:13,501
and,

3220
01:34:13,501 --> 01:34:18,501
and this came from a call and
research and there there's,

3221
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:23,470
there's disagreement as to whether this
is the right outcome or not and this is

3222
01:34:23,471 --> 01:34:24,304
the right policy.

3223
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:25,263
And yes,

3224
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:30,370
our bias does influence looking in
this direction and our bias does take,

3225
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:31,393
um,

3226
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,560
our biases influence us putting
a rule like this in place.

3227
01:34:35,561 --> 01:34:39,430
But it is with the understanding
of creating as much
opportunity as possible for

3228
01:34:39,431 --> 01:34:43,870
as many people to speak based on the
actual data that we see of people leaving

3229
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:45,940
the platform because of
experiences that have,

3230
01:34:46,630 --> 01:34:47,830
why did your research stop there?

3231
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:49,650
It hasn't stopped.

3232
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:49,830
We,

3233
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:50,531
we are,

3234
01:34:50,531 --> 01:34:54,790
our rules aren't set in and something
that just stops and doesn't evolve.

3235
01:34:54,791 --> 01:34:56,260
We're going to constantly question,

3236
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:01,220
we're going to get feedback from people
on every end of the spectrum of any

3237
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:03,760
particular issue and make changes

3238
01:35:03,860 --> 01:35:04,693
accordingly.

3239
01:35:04,810 --> 01:35:05,643
Doesn't stop.

3240
01:35:05,780 --> 01:35:06,501
And to your credit.

3241
01:35:06,501 --> 01:35:10,250
I really do appreciate that the fact
that you're very open about that you have

3242
01:35:10,251 --> 01:35:13,310
made mistakes and that you're continuing
to learn and grow and that your company

3243
01:35:13,311 --> 01:35:15,950
is reviewing these things and trying
to figure out which way to go.

3244
01:35:15,951 --> 01:35:19,370
And I think we all need to pay attention
to the fact that this is a completely

3245
01:35:19,371 --> 01:35:20,060
new road.

3246
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:22,490
This road did not exist 15 years ago.

3247
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:23,720
There was nothing there.

3248
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,420
That is a tremendous
responsibility for any con,

3249
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:27,343
any company,

3250
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:32,410
any group of human beings to be in
control of public discourse on a scale

3251
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:35,480
unprecedented in human history.

3252
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:36,860
And that's what we're dealing with here.

3253
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:40,700
This is not a small thing and I know
people that have been banned to them.

3254
01:35:40,701 --> 01:35:41,270
This is,

3255
01:35:41,270 --> 01:35:42,800
this is a matter of ideology.

3256
01:35:42,801 --> 01:35:43,371
This is a matter of,

3257
01:35:43,371 --> 01:35:46,700
this is a matter of that there's a lot
of debate going on here and this one of

3258
01:35:46,701 --> 01:35:48,770
the reasons why I wanted to
bring you on because Tim,

3259
01:35:48,771 --> 01:35:53,030
cause you know so much about so many of
these cases and so much because you are

3260
01:35:53,031 --> 01:35:54,490
a journalist and you're,

3261
01:35:54,491 --> 01:35:58,820
you're very aware of the implications
and all the problems that have been that

3262
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:00,800
maybe have slipped through my fingers.

3263
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:02,720
So I do want to make one
thing really clear though.

3264
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,870
I have a tremendous amount
of respect and trust for you.

3265
01:36:05,871 --> 01:36:08,030
And you say you wanted to solve this
problem simply because you're sitting here

3266
01:36:08,031 --> 01:36:09,140
right now and these are,

3267
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,550
these other companies aren't right?

3268
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:12,260
Jackie went on Sam Harris,

3269
01:36:12,261 --> 01:36:13,850
you are on a get with Gad sad.

3270
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:17,240
And that says to me a good faith effort
to try and figure out how to do things

3271
01:36:17,241 --> 01:36:18,074
right.

3272
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:18,760
So as,

3273
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:19,401
as much as I,

3274
01:36:19,401 --> 01:36:22,070
I'll apologize for getting kind
of angry and being emotional.

3275
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:22,340
Oh,

3276
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:23,110
so he was hungry.

3277
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:24,290
I look,

3278
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:29,320
we also haven't been great at
explaining our intent and there's a,

3279
01:36:29,481 --> 01:36:31,190
there's a few things going on.

3280
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:32,083
One,

3281
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:33,980
as Joe indicated,

3282
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:36,960
centralized global policy.

3283
01:36:36,961 --> 01:36:39,380
A scale is almost impossible.

3284
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:40,370
And,

3285
01:36:40,370 --> 01:36:41,750
and we realize this,

3286
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:44,900
different services have
different answers to this.

3287
01:36:44,901 --> 01:36:47,770
Reddit has a community
based policy where a,

3288
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:48,680
each topic,

3289
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,600
each subreddit has its own policy and,

3290
01:36:50,601 --> 01:36:51,171
and you know,

3291
01:36:51,171 --> 01:36:51,500
there's,

3292
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:52,520
there's some benefit to that.

3293
01:36:52,521 --> 01:36:54,740
So that's problem number one.

3294
01:36:54,770 --> 01:36:59,770
We know that this very binary off or
on platform isn't right and it doesn't

3295
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:06,071
scale and it ultimately goes against
our key initiative of wanting to promote

3296
01:37:06,650 --> 01:37:08,030
more healthier conversation.

3297
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:10,400
I just don't think
that's what you're doing.

3298
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:11,471
I and,

3299
01:37:11,471 --> 01:37:11,850
and I,

3300
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:12,471
I hear you.

3301
01:37:12,471 --> 01:37:12,921
I hear you.

3302
01:37:12,921 --> 01:37:13,120
Yeah,

3303
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:13,953
but like,

3304
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:15,560
so we're not done.

3305
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,951
We're not,

3306
01:37:15,951 --> 01:37:16,521
we're not done.

3307
01:37:16,521 --> 01:37:19,610
We're not finished with
our work and we need to,

3308
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:22,670
the reason I'm going on all these podcasts
and having these conversations and

3309
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,060
ideally vigils getting out there more
often as well because we don't see enough

3310
01:37:26,061 --> 01:37:27,140
for him to hear enough for her.

3311
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:30,530
We need to have these
conversations so we can learn,

3312
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:30,891
we can,

3313
01:37:30,891 --> 01:37:35,270
we can get the feedback and
also pay attention to where
the technology is going.

3314
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:37,190
Before the podcast we
talked a little bit about,

3315
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:38,210
and I talked about it on this,

3316
01:37:38,330 --> 01:37:40,370
our previous podcasts and also Sam's,

3317
01:37:40,970 --> 01:37:45,970
that technology today is enabling content
to live forever in a way that was not

3318
01:37:46,281 --> 01:37:47,150
possible before.

3319
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,450
You can say that everything
on the Internet lives forever.

3320
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:54,950
But that's not generally not true
because any host or any con connection,

3321
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:55,943
take it down,

3322
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,750
the block chain changes all that.

3323
01:37:57,751 --> 01:38:00,060
It can actually exist forever,

3324
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:02,420
permanently without anyone
being able to touch it.

3325
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:02,821
Government,

3326
01:38:02,821 --> 01:38:03,654
company,

3327
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:04,583
individual.

3328
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:08,550
And that is a reality that we need to pay
attention to and really understand our

3329
01:38:08,551 --> 01:38:09,000
value.

3330
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,810
And I believe a lot of our
value in in the future,

3331
01:38:13,350 --> 01:38:14,071
not today,

3332
01:38:14,071 --> 01:38:14,341
again,

3333
01:38:14,341 --> 01:38:15,031
we have a tons of,

3334
01:38:15,031 --> 01:38:19,320
we have a ton of work is to take a strong
stance of like we are going to be a

3335
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:23,730
company like given this entire Corpus
of conversation and content within the

3336
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:24,420
world,

3337
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:27,420
we're going to work to promote
healthy public conversation.

3338
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:28,590
That's what we want.

3339
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:29,610
That's what we're gonna do.

3340
01:38:29,940 --> 01:38:31,320
And if you disagree with it,

3341
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:36,570
you should be able to turn it off and you
should be able to access anything that

3342
01:38:36,571 --> 01:38:37,980
you want as you would with the Internet.

3343
01:38:37,981 --> 01:38:42,960
But those are technologies that are just
in the formative stages and presenting

3344
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:45,540
new opportunities to companies like ours.

3345
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,374
And,

3346
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:49,710
and there's a ton of challenges with
them in a ton of the things that we've

3347
01:38:49,711 --> 01:38:54,711
discussed over the past hour that it
doesn't solve and maybe exacerbates,

3348
01:38:55,201 --> 01:38:59,160
especially around things like
election and foreign interference and,

3349
01:38:59,210 --> 01:38:59,610
um,

3350
01:38:59,610 --> 01:39:01,320
some of the regulatory
concerns that you're bringing.

3351
01:39:01,690 --> 01:39:02,680
There's a few issues,

3352
01:39:02,681 --> 01:39:02,950
right?

3353
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:04,840
Your definition of what
is or isn't healthy,

3354
01:39:05,330 --> 01:39:05,660
right?

3355
01:39:05,660 --> 01:39:05,901
Yes,

3356
01:39:05,901 --> 01:39:06,201
yes.

3357
01:39:06,201 --> 01:39:06,481
And,

3358
01:39:06,481 --> 01:39:06,711
and,

3359
01:39:06,711 --> 01:39:08,030
and we want that to be public.

3360
01:39:08,150 --> 01:39:09,530
Like we want that we're,

3361
01:39:09,531 --> 01:39:10,160
we're going,

3362
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,450
we have four indicators right now that
we're working on with an external lab.

3363
01:39:14,451 --> 01:39:15,650
We won't other labs too.

3364
01:39:15,651 --> 01:39:17,360
We want to give it up open source,

3365
01:39:17,361 --> 01:39:18,890
make sure that people can comment on it,

3366
01:39:19,220 --> 01:39:20,600
that people can help us define it.

3367
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:24,320
We'll use that interpretation on
our own algorithms and then push it.

3368
01:39:24,321 --> 01:39:26,000
But that has to be open.

3369
01:39:26,001 --> 01:39:26,960
That has to be transparent.

3370
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:27,651
Are we there today?

3371
01:39:27,651 --> 01:39:28,490
Absolutely not.

3372
01:39:28,491 --> 01:39:29,324
We're not there yet.

3373
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:33,080
I this this course of action to me it
looks like a Fahrenheit four 51 future

3374
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:34,580
where everything is so offensive.

3375
01:39:34,581 --> 01:39:35,720
Everything must be restricted.

3376
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:36,080
I see.

3377
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,940
That's the path I see that you're on.

3378
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,380
You want to have a healthy conversation,

3379
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:40,760
you want to maximize the amount of people.

3380
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,970
That means you've got to cut off all
the tall grass and level everything out.

3381
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:45,071
So if,

3382
01:39:45,071 --> 01:39:45,310
if,

3383
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:45,551
if,

3384
01:39:45,551 --> 01:39:48,650
if you've decided that this one rule needs
to be enforced because certain things

3385
01:39:48,651 --> 01:39:49,484
are offensive.

3386
01:39:49,720 --> 01:39:49,841
No,

3387
01:39:49,841 --> 01:39:51,220
but can I explain what,

3388
01:39:51,460 --> 01:39:55,960
what health at least means to us and
the skeptical or get so like we talked a

3389
01:39:55,961 --> 01:39:57,610
little bit about this on
the previous podcasts,

3390
01:39:57,611 --> 01:40:02,611
but what we have four indicators that
we're trying to define and try to

3391
01:40:03,401 --> 01:40:04,930
understand if there's
actually something there.

3392
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,970
One is shared attention.

3393
01:40:07,420 --> 01:40:11,560
Is a conversation generally shared around
the same objects or is it disparate?

3394
01:40:12,010 --> 01:40:14,500
So like as we're having conversation,

3395
01:40:14,860 --> 01:40:16,240
the four of us are having a conversation.

3396
01:40:16,241 --> 01:40:19,450
Are we all focused on the same
thing or as Joe on his phone,

3397
01:40:19,451 --> 01:40:21,460
which you were earlier or
like whatever is going on.

3398
01:40:21,820 --> 01:40:23,950
Because a more shared attention will,

3399
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:28,600
will lead to healthier conversation
number two is shared reality.

3400
01:40:29,080 --> 01:40:30,910
Not whether something is factual,

3401
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:33,040
but are we sharing the same facts?

3402
01:40:33,070 --> 01:40:34,120
Is the earth round?

3403
01:40:34,150 --> 01:40:34,983
Is the world flat?

3404
01:40:36,010 --> 01:40:37,150
So we,

3405
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:38,050
we can,

3406
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:39,020
we are meant,

3407
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:39,680
yes,

3408
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:43,630
we can tell what facts are we sharing
and what facts are we not sharing?

3409
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:44,800
What percentage of the conversation.

3410
01:40:44,801 --> 01:40:45,420
So that's,

3411
01:40:45,420 --> 01:40:46,510
that's the second indicator.

3412
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:48,730
Third is receptivity.

3413
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:54,600
Are the participants receptive to
debate and to civility and to uh,

3414
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:56,680
expressing their opinion?

3415
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:57,970
And even if it is,

3416
01:40:57,990 --> 01:40:58,450
um,

3417
01:40:58,450 --> 01:41:03,450
something that might be a hurtful or
are people receptive to at least look at

3418
01:41:03,641 --> 01:41:04,690
and be empathetic and,

3419
01:41:04,691 --> 01:41:05,980
and look at what's behind that week.

3420
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:08,950
This is the one we have the
most measurement around today.

3421
01:41:08,951 --> 01:41:13,090
We can determine and predict when
someone might walk away from a Twitter

3422
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:14,890
conversation because they feel it's toxic.

3423
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:16,510
I just ignore them all basically.

3424
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:17,291
So,

3425
01:41:17,291 --> 01:41:17,950
and we see,

3426
01:41:17,950 --> 01:41:19,060
we see that in our data.

3427
01:41:19,090 --> 01:41:19,391
Right?

3428
01:41:19,391 --> 01:41:19,840
So you,

3429
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,500
and there's some conversations
that you get into and you and you,

3430
01:41:22,530 --> 01:41:23,140
you know,

3431
01:41:23,140 --> 01:41:23,800
persist.

3432
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:26,890
And then the finally is
variety of perspective.

3433
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:27,941
Are we,

3434
01:41:27,941 --> 01:41:31,720
are we actually seeing the full spectrum
of any topic that's being talked about?

3435
01:41:32,260 --> 01:41:35,860
And these are not meant to
be taken as individual parts,

3436
01:41:35,890 --> 01:41:38,500
but in unison how they played together.

3437
01:41:38,860 --> 01:41:40,480
And we've written these out,

3438
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:44,800
we haven't gotten far enough in actually
defining what they look like and what

3439
01:41:44,801 --> 01:41:45,221
they mean.

3440
01:41:45,221 --> 01:41:49,600
And we certainly haven't gotten good
enough at understanding when we deploy a

3441
01:41:49,601 --> 01:41:50,231
solution,

3442
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:52,660
like being able to follow a Hashtag,

3443
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:56,140
does that impact variety of
perspective to the positive?

3444
01:41:56,141 --> 01:41:58,250
Does it impact shared
reality to the negative?

3445
01:41:58,280 --> 01:41:58,811
What not.

3446
01:41:58,811 --> 01:42:00,910
So this is how we're thinking about it.

3447
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:03,190
And as we think more about that,

3448
01:42:03,191 --> 01:42:07,150
that influences our product and influences
our enforcement and influences our

3449
01:42:07,151 --> 01:42:07,790
policy as well.

3450
01:42:07,790 --> 01:42:10,220
What you're describing sounds
wildly different to what Twitter is,

3451
01:42:10,221 --> 01:42:10,401
right?

3452
01:42:10,401 --> 01:42:10,811
So you're,

3453
01:42:10,811 --> 01:42:12,650
you have a goal for where
you want to get with those,

3454
01:42:12,710 --> 01:42:13,543
those metrics.

3455
01:42:14,030 --> 01:42:16,290
So what confuses me then when you,

3456
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:16,561
when you,

3457
01:42:16,561 --> 01:42:18,590
when we talk about someone
like Megan Murphy who,

3458
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,880
sure she violated your rules,

3459
01:42:20,330 --> 01:42:22,040
but in the context of a conversation,

3460
01:42:22,100 --> 01:42:22,371
you know,

3461
01:42:22,371 --> 01:42:27,130
you recognize people will sometimes
get heated with each other if you know,

3462
01:42:27,140 --> 01:42:29,870
how do you do is a healthy conversation
when no one is being negative.

3463
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:30,470
What if,

3464
01:42:30,470 --> 01:42:32,690
what if people are yelling at each
other and being mean and insulting where

3465
01:42:32,691 --> 01:42:33,524
mis-gendering them.

3466
01:42:34,330 --> 01:42:39,330
I think it's a question of what thresholds
you allow and the more control we can

3467
01:42:40,811 --> 01:42:45,811
give people to very the spectrum
on what they want to see.

3468
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:46,690
Um,

3469
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:47,860
that feels right to me.

3470
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:48,610
I mean,

3471
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:49,270
Joe in,

3472
01:42:49,270 --> 01:42:50,440
in your,

3473
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:53,530
your Alex podcast did exactly this thing.

3474
01:42:53,531 --> 01:42:54,850
You're hosting a conversation.

3475
01:42:55,420 --> 01:43:00,420
You had both of your guests who started
talking over each other and you pause

3476
01:43:01,751 --> 01:43:02,450
the conversation.

3477
01:43:02,450 --> 01:43:02,711
You said,

3478
01:43:02,711 --> 01:43:03,670
let's not get combatative.

3479
01:43:03,671 --> 01:43:04,504
Someone said,

3480
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:05,590
I'm not being combative.

3481
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,590
You said you're all talking
over each other and,

3482
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:12,430
and there's a dynamic that the
conversation then shifted to that.

3483
01:43:12,431 --> 01:43:14,500
Got to some deeper points,

3484
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,360
right?

3485
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:16,300
It could have just said,

3486
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,590
let that happen and,

3487
01:43:17,591 --> 01:43:17,960
and,

3488
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:18,761
and let it go.

3489
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:19,810
And that's fine too.

3490
01:43:19,811 --> 01:43:20,141
It's,

3491
01:43:20,141 --> 01:43:20,770
it's,

3492
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:24,820
it's up to who is viewing and
experiencing that conversation.

3493
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:25,870
And I agree with you,

3494
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:28,780
it is completely far off
from where we are today.

3495
01:43:28,810 --> 01:43:30,280
We've not only have,

3496
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:34,270
we had to address a lot of these issues
that we're talking about at this table,

3497
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:38,550
but we've also had to turn the company
around from a business standpoint.

3498
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:39,310
We'd have,

3499
01:43:39,310 --> 01:43:43,570
we've had to fix all of our infrastructure
that's over 10 years old and we had

3500
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:46,270
to go through two layoffs because
the company was too large.

3501
01:43:46,271 --> 01:43:50,920
So we have to prioritize our efforts and
I don't know any other way to do this,

3502
01:43:51,890 --> 01:43:56,330
be really specific about our
intentions and our aspirations and,

3503
01:43:56,620 --> 01:44:01,220
and the intent and the why behind our
actions and not everyone's going to agree

3504
01:44:01,221 --> 01:44:01,940
with it in the,

3505
01:44:01,940 --> 01:44:02,900
in the particular moment.

3506
01:44:03,120 --> 01:44:03,321
So,

3507
01:44:03,321 --> 01:44:03,430
uh,

3508
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:04,000
so I will,

3509
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:04,300
I want to,

3510
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:06,580
I want to point this out before
I make my next statement though.

3511
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:07,280
Just real quick.

3512
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,580
It seems like the technology is
moving faster than the culture.

3513
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,140
So I do recognize your,

3514
01:44:11,141 --> 01:44:12,490
you guys are in a rock and a hard place.

3515
01:44:12,730 --> 01:44:15,700
How do you get to a point where you
can't have that open source crypto,

3516
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:19,780
blockchain technology that allows for
free and open speech at the same time the

3517
01:44:19,781 --> 01:44:20,770
technology exists.

3518
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,320
Twitter has been replicated
numerous times in different ways.

3519
01:44:23,321 --> 01:44:24,370
Mastodon for instance.

3520
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:24,770
Yup.

3521
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:27,490
What's disconcerting to me is,

3522
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:28,570
you know,

3523
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:28,740
and,

3524
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,860
and maybe you have research on this,

3525
01:44:29,861 --> 01:44:31,270
which is why you've taken
the decision that you have,

3526
01:44:31,271 --> 01:44:32,800
but when you ban someone,

3527
01:44:33,190 --> 01:44:34,060
because they've said,

3528
01:44:34,090 --> 01:44:34,570
you know,

3529
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:36,550
bad opinions mis-gendering well,

3530
01:44:36,551 --> 01:44:37,600
they're not going to go away.

3531
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:39,880
They're going to try and
find anywhere they can speak.

3532
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:42,320
So what effectively happens is you're,

3533
01:44:42,321 --> 01:44:44,080
you're taking all of these people from a,

3534
01:44:44,081 --> 01:44:45,520
from a wide range of the most,

3535
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:45,940
uh,

3536
01:44:45,940 --> 01:44:46,780
tease a prison analogy,

3537
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:48,340
murderers all the way to pot smokers,

3538
01:44:48,341 --> 01:44:50,230
and you're putting in the same room with
each other and you're saying you're not

3539
01:44:50,231 --> 01:44:51,064
welcome here.

3540
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:51,311
Well,

3541
01:44:51,311 --> 01:44:53,770
what happens when you take someone who
smokes pot and put them in prison with a

3542
01:44:53,771 --> 01:44:55,060
bunch of gang bangers and murderers,

3543
01:44:55,600 --> 01:44:56,433
they fall into that.

3544
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:57,320
So

3545
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:02,060
I totally get the point and I'm hyper
aware of our action sending more and more

3546
01:45:02,061 --> 01:45:02,820
things into that.

3547
01:45:02,820 --> 01:45:02,941
Well,

3548
01:45:02,941 --> 01:45:06,810
this is something that I wanted to discuss
is really important in this vein of

3549
01:45:06,811 --> 01:45:07,470
thinking.

3550
01:45:07,470 --> 01:45:09,240
What about roads to redemption?

3551
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:11,970
What about someone like Megan
Murphy lit about someone,

3552
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,590
Anyone Alex Jones.

3553
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:14,570
Milo is,

3554
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:16,290
is it Ken?

3555
01:45:16,291 --> 01:45:21,291
We find a path for people to get back to
the platform that for good or for bad,

3556
01:45:23,011 --> 01:45:23,844
like it or not,

3557
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:27,660
there is one video platform that people
give a shit about and that's youtube.

3558
01:45:27,870 --> 01:45:29,190
You get kicked off of Youtube,

3559
01:45:29,220 --> 01:45:31,110
you're doomed and that's just reality.

3560
01:45:31,111 --> 01:45:31,944
You can go,

3561
01:45:32,070 --> 01:45:33,120
Vimeo is wonderful.

3562
01:45:33,121 --> 01:45:35,340
There's a lot of great
video platforms out there.

3563
01:45:35,341 --> 01:45:39,790
They have a fucking tiny fraction
of the views that youtube dubs.

3564
01:45:39,810 --> 01:45:40,643
That's just reality.

3565
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:42,090
The same thing can be said for Twitter,

3566
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:47,340
whether or not other platforms
exist is that's inconsequential.

3567
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:50,190
The vast majority of
people are on Twitter.

3568
01:45:50,340 --> 01:45:53,760
The vast majority of
people that are making,

3569
01:45:53,761 --> 01:45:56,880
you know post about the news
and breaking information,

3570
01:45:56,940 --> 01:45:57,870
they do it on Twitter.

3571
01:45:58,920 --> 01:46:03,920
What can be set up and have you guys
given consideration to some sort of a path

3572
01:46:04,411 --> 01:46:05,244
to redemption?

3573
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:05,711
Yeah,

3574
01:46:05,711 --> 01:46:05,960
the,

3575
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:06,793
there's,

3576
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,160
there's redemption and
there's rehabilitation.

3577
01:46:09,340 --> 01:46:09,790
Okay.

3578
01:46:09,790 --> 01:46:10,300
You know,

3579
01:46:10,300 --> 01:46:11,133
we,

3580
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:17,010
we haven't done a great job at having
a cohesive stance on rehabilitation and

3581
01:46:18,551 --> 01:46:19,030
redemption.

3582
01:46:19,030 --> 01:46:19,781
We have it in parts.

3583
01:46:19,781 --> 01:46:20,614
So the,

3584
01:46:20,730 --> 01:46:22,360
the whole focus behind,

3585
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:22,930
um,

3586
01:46:22,930 --> 01:46:27,930
the temporary suspensions is to at least
give people pause and think about why

3587
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:35,220
they violated our why and how they
violated our particular rules that they

3588
01:46:35,390 --> 01:46:37,960
signed up for when they came in
through our terms of service.

3589
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:38,441
Right.

3590
01:46:38,441 --> 01:46:39,490
Whether you agree with him or not.

3591
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:41,380
Like this is the agreement that we have.

3592
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:41,860
Well,

3593
01:46:41,860 --> 01:46:42,210
do you know,

3594
01:46:42,210 --> 01:46:43,290
I'm just thinking this,

3595
01:46:43,291 --> 01:46:44,190
I'm sorry to interrupt you,

3596
01:46:44,191 --> 01:46:47,160
but it would be kind of hilarious
if you guys had an option,

3597
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:48,121
like a,

3598
01:46:48,121 --> 01:46:50,010
a mode of Twitter,

3599
01:46:50,011 --> 01:46:50,940
an angry mode.

3600
01:46:50,941 --> 01:46:51,451
Like fuck,

3601
01:46:51,451 --> 01:46:52,530
I'm angry right now.

3602
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:54,270
So I'm going to type
some things and it says,

3603
01:46:54,271 --> 01:46:54,751
hey dude,

3604
01:46:54,751 --> 01:46:56,160
why don't you just think about this?

3605
01:46:56,340 --> 01:46:58,560
We're going to hold it
for you in the Q and.

3606
01:46:58,590 --> 01:46:59,110
A.

3607
01:46:59,110 --> 01:46:59,910
We will do that.

3608
01:46:59,910 --> 01:47:00,743
People do that.

3609
01:47:00,990 --> 01:47:02,250
People do that in their drafts,

3610
01:47:02,251 --> 01:47:03,480
but in they do.

3611
01:47:03,481 --> 01:47:04,021
I'm sure they did.

3612
01:47:04,021 --> 01:47:05,760
But it would be funny if
you had an angry mode.

3613
01:47:05,780 --> 01:47:05,950
Yeah.

3614
01:47:05,950 --> 01:47:06,540
But like me,

3615
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:07,190
you guys,

3616
01:47:07,190 --> 01:47:10,560
I noticed you guys are using a lot of
curse words and you're saying a lot of bad

3617
01:47:10,561 --> 01:47:12,090
things were going to put
you in an angry mode.

3618
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:13,081
So think about this.

3619
01:47:13,081 --> 01:47:16,050
So you have to make several clicks
if you want to post this and there is

3620
01:47:16,051 --> 01:47:20,460
research to suggest that people expressing
that actually tends to minimize more

3621
01:47:20,461 --> 01:47:21,540
violent physical.

3622
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:22,300
Uh Oh for sure.

3623
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:22,770
Dot.

3624
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:24,030
Everyone says that with emails,

3625
01:47:24,031 --> 01:47:24,500
if you're,

3626
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:24,870
if you're gonna,

3627
01:47:24,870 --> 01:47:27,360
if you're in the middle of the night and
someone sends you an email and you find

3628
01:47:27,361 --> 01:47:27,961
it insulting,

3629
01:47:27,961 --> 01:47:30,600
you ready your type anemia
and then go to sleep,

3630
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,510
wake up in the morning like I'm
going to say something nice.

3631
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:33,931
You know?

3632
01:47:33,931 --> 01:47:37,290
That's how I wind up
interacting with these people.

3633
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,273
But what,

3634
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:42,570
what do you think can be done for people
like let's say Megan Murphy because she

3635
01:47:42,571 --> 01:47:43,860
seems one of the,

3636
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:47,950
it's as easy to see her
perspective is any what?

3637
01:47:48,020 --> 01:47:48,720
What do you think could be

3638
01:47:48,720 --> 01:47:49,553
done for her?

3639
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:50,140
I think,

3640
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:50,973
I think you're right.

3641
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:56,330
I think that I would love to get to a
point where we think of a suspensions is

3642
01:47:57,931 --> 01:48:00,930
temporary and she's
banned for life right now.

3643
01:48:00,931 --> 01:48:03,210
That's the only option that
we've built into our roles,

3644
01:48:03,211 --> 01:48:06,450
but we have every capability of changing
that and that's something that I want

3645
01:48:06,451 --> 01:48:08,220
my team to focus on is thinking about,

3646
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:09,181
as Jack said,

3647
01:48:09,181 --> 01:48:11,940
not just coming back after
some time bound period,

3648
01:48:12,240 --> 01:48:16,110
but also like what more can and should
we be doing within the product itself

3649
01:48:16,140 --> 01:48:18,140
early on to educate people about the role.

3650
01:48:18,141 --> 01:48:20,850
So one of the things that
we're working on as a very,

3651
01:48:20,851 --> 01:48:23,100
very simplified version
of the Twitter rules,

3652
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:24,480
that's two pages,

3653
01:48:24,510 --> 01:48:25,343
not 20.

3654
01:48:26,010 --> 01:48:28,530
I've made sure that my
lawyers don't write it.

3655
01:48:28,570 --> 01:48:30,600
It's written in as
plain English as we can.

3656
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:35,130
We try to put examples in there and
like really taking the time to educate

3657
01:48:35,131 --> 01:48:35,550
people.

3658
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,090
And I got,

3659
01:48:36,090 --> 01:48:38,910
people aren't always going to agree with
those roles and we have to address that

3660
01:48:38,911 --> 01:48:39,630
too,

3661
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:44,040
but at least simplifying it and educating
people so that they don't even get to

3662
01:48:44,041 --> 01:48:44,671
that stage.

3663
01:48:44,671 --> 01:48:48,100
But once they do understanding that there
are going to be different contexts in

3664
01:48:48,101 --> 01:48:49,020
people's lives,

3665
01:48:49,021 --> 01:48:53,190
different times they're going to say and
do things that they may not agree with.

3666
01:48:53,191 --> 01:48:57,930
And they don't deserve to be permanently
suspended for forever from a platform

3667
01:48:57,931 --> 01:48:58,410
like Twitter.

3668
01:48:58,410 --> 01:48:58,520
Oh,

3669
01:48:58,520 --> 01:48:58,821
great.

3670
01:48:58,821 --> 01:48:59,820
So how do you get to it?

3671
01:48:59,821 --> 01:49:00,401
So we,

3672
01:49:00,401 --> 01:49:00,720
we,

3673
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:03,840
this is something that actually we just
had a meeting on this earlier this week,

3674
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:04,081
uh,

3675
01:49:04,081 --> 01:49:05,130
with our executive team.

3676
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:05,880
Um,

3677
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:06,570
and,

3678
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:06,901
you know,

3679
01:49:06,901 --> 01:49:09,780
identifying kind of some of the
principles by which we would want to think

3680
01:49:09,781 --> 01:49:10,590
about,

3681
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:11,160
um,

3682
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:11,401
you know,

3683
01:49:11,401 --> 01:49:12,211
time bounding,

3684
01:49:12,211 --> 01:49:12,871
suspension.

3685
01:49:12,871 --> 01:49:13,621
So it's work.

3686
01:49:13,621 --> 01:49:15,510
We have to do it and
we're gonna figure it out.

3687
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:17,460
And I'm not going to tell you
what's coming out right away,

3688
01:49:17,461 --> 01:49:18,060
but it's on,

3689
01:49:18,060 --> 01:49:18,841
it's on our roadmap.

3690
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:19,800
It's something that we want to do.

3691
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:23,250
Why don't you set up a jury system?

3692
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:26,220
When someone reports something instead
of you having to worry about it,

3693
01:49:26,250 --> 01:49:29,940
there would be no accusation of bias if
100,000 users were randomly selected to

3694
01:49:29,941 --> 01:49:31,140
determine cause the periscope does this.

3695
01:49:31,141 --> 01:49:31,960
Yep.

3696
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:32,770
Yeah.

3697
01:49:32,770 --> 01:49:33,730
And we've learned.

3698
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,990
So scope doesn't see a
please explain that we,

3699
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:36,240
uh,

3700
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:37,840
so periscope has a,

3701
01:49:37,841 --> 01:49:38,674
um,

3702
01:49:38,850 --> 01:49:39,370
uh,

3703
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:39,990
uh,

3704
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:40,270
uh,

3705
01:49:40,270 --> 01:49:41,590
content moderation jury.

3706
01:49:41,740 --> 01:49:45,190
So we flag based on the
machine learning algorithms.

3707
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:46,030
Um,

3708
01:49:46,030 --> 01:49:47,020
and in some cases,

3709
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:48,430
um,

3710
01:49:48,430 --> 01:49:49,720
particular replies,

3711
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:53,230
we send them to a small
jury of folks to ask,

3712
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:58,060
is this against our from service or is
this something that you believe should be

3713
01:49:58,061 --> 01:50:00,820
in the channel or 90 [inaudible]
know to be on the jury?

3714
01:50:00,910 --> 01:50:01,210
No,

3715
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:01,541
it's,

3716
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:02,170
it's random.

3717
01:50:02,170 --> 01:50:05,920
So you were chosen and you decide
whether or not you want to participate.

3718
01:50:05,950 --> 01:50:06,280
Yup.

3719
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:06,670
Okay.

3720
01:50:06,670 --> 01:50:08,320
And it's,

3721
01:50:08,460 --> 01:50:09,130
it's good.

3722
01:50:09,130 --> 01:50:10,420
It has some flaws that has some,

3723
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:11,890
some gaming aspects to it as well.

3724
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:13,100
But like we,

3725
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:16,470
we do have a lot of experiments
that we're testing and like,

3726
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,400
we want to build confidence and like,

3727
01:50:18,401 --> 01:50:21,040
it's actually driving the
outcomes that we think are,

3728
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,380
are useful.

3729
01:50:22,380 --> 01:50:22,750
Um,

3730
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:26,980
and periscope is a good playground
for us across many regards.

3731
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:31,250
I think ultimately one of the greater
philosophical challenges is that you are a

3732
01:50:31,251 --> 01:50:32,960
massively powerful corporation.

3733
01:50:33,260 --> 01:50:34,940
You have international investors.

3734
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,320
I believe as a Saudi prince owns what,

3735
01:50:36,321 --> 01:50:37,310
6% of Twitter?

3736
01:50:37,940 --> 01:50:38,570
So when I,

3737
01:50:38,570 --> 01:50:39,380
is that true?

3738
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:40,540
I'm just wanna make sure it's correct.

3739
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:43,580
We're a publicly traded corporate
or anybody can buy stock,

3740
01:50:43,581 --> 01:50:46,170
but that doesn't mean they
have a influence on data.

3741
01:50:46,370 --> 01:50:46,581
Well,

3742
01:50:46,581 --> 01:50:48,590
I think depending on which
political faction you asked,

3743
01:50:48,591 --> 01:50:49,610
I'll say money is influence,

3744
01:50:49,670 --> 01:50:49,911
right?

3745
01:50:49,911 --> 01:50:52,700
So I'm not going to say that the
Saudi prince who invested in Twitter,

3746
01:50:52,900 --> 01:50:53,241
because again,

3747
01:50:53,241 --> 01:50:53,810
I've only a,

3748
01:50:53,810 --> 01:50:55,100
it's been a while since
I've read these stories.

3749
01:50:55,220 --> 01:50:57,290
It's like showing up to your meetings
and throwing his weight around,

3750
01:50:57,590 --> 01:50:58,423
but at a certain point,

3751
01:50:58,610 --> 01:50:59,300
not doing that,

3752
01:50:59,300 --> 01:50:59,630
but,

3753
01:50:59,630 --> 01:51:00,463
but you know,

3754
01:51:00,500 --> 01:51:01,000
for I,

3755
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:01,521
I might do,

3756
01:51:01,521 --> 01:51:02,330
I have to trust you,

3757
01:51:02,330 --> 01:51:02,640
right?

3758
01:51:02,640 --> 01:51:03,470
This is a guy who's throwing,

3759
01:51:03,470 --> 01:51:04,490
throwing it over a billion dollars,

3760
01:51:04,491 --> 01:51:05,480
I think into Twitter.

3761
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:07,430
Twitter has influence on our elections,

3762
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:08,570
foreign governments,

3763
01:51:08,810 --> 01:51:11,150
foreign government actors
have stake in Twitter.

3764
01:51:11,450 --> 01:51:14,330
It worries me then when you base your
rules on your personal decisions on an

3765
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:15,860
unelected group of people,

3766
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:16,700
you,

3767
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:19,310
you have such tremendous power in
this monopoly on public discourse,

3768
01:51:19,490 --> 01:51:20,360
near monopoly.

3769
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:22,060
Like he was saying you some platforms,

3770
01:51:22,150 --> 01:51:23,390
Twitter has no real competition.

3771
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:26,360
So I just have to hope and trust
you have the best interest at heart,

3772
01:51:26,361 --> 01:51:27,500
but you at the end of the day,

3773
01:51:27,501 --> 01:51:27,801
it's,

3774
01:51:27,801 --> 01:51:28,220
it's,

3775
01:51:28,220 --> 01:51:29,120
it's authoritarian.

3776
01:51:29,630 --> 01:51:31,010
No one chose you to be in charge of this.

3777
01:51:31,011 --> 01:51:32,750
I understand you mentioned
you discovered Twitter,

3778
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:34,310
but here I am looking at,

3779
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:34,521
you know,

3780
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,190
both of you have this tremendous power
over whether or not someone can get

3781
01:51:37,191 --> 01:51:38,024
elected.

3782
01:51:38,090 --> 01:51:40,940
You can choose to band someone and tell
me all day and night you have a reason

3783
01:51:40,941 --> 01:51:41,774
for doing it.

3784
01:51:41,810 --> 01:51:42,650
I just have to trust you.

3785
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:43,370
That's terrifying.

3786
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:44,203
There's no proof.

3787
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:46,610
There's no proof Alex Jones at any of
these things other than thinks he's

3788
01:51:46,611 --> 01:51:47,031
posted.

3789
01:51:47,031 --> 01:51:47,181
Right.

3790
01:51:47,181 --> 01:51:47,780
I understand that.

3791
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:50,750
That's actually what I was on the phone
with to Alex was texting me saying that

3792
01:51:50,751 --> 01:51:55,220
he'd never did anything to endanger any
child and that he was disputing what

3793
01:51:55,221 --> 01:51:58,580
people were saying about a
video of a child getting harmed.

3794
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,210
And so do we just trust an unelected,

3795
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:01,970
uh,

3796
01:52:01,970 --> 01:52:02,480
I mean,

3797
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,291
you were extreme,

3798
01:52:03,291 --> 01:52:04,970
extremely wealthy individuals.

3799
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:05,930
Saudi princes,

3800
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:06,590
you know,

3801
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:09,110
it's a publicly traded company who
knows where the infant is coming from.

3802
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:12,200
Your rules are blessed not based on
a global policy and I'm sitting here

3803
01:52:12,201 --> 01:52:12,561
watching,

3804
01:52:12,561 --> 01:52:12,771
wow,

3805
01:52:12,771 --> 01:52:15,800
these people who are never chosen in this
position and have too much power over

3806
01:52:15,801 --> 01:52:16,190
my,

3807
01:52:16,190 --> 01:52:16,470
my,

3808
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,790
my,

3809
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:17,060
my,

3810
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:17,810
my politics.

3811
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:20,570
I think that that's why it's so
important that we take the time to build

3812
01:52:20,571 --> 01:52:24,800
transparency into what we're doing and
that's part of what we're trying to do is

3813
01:52:24,801 --> 01:52:27,830
not just in being here
and talking to you guys,

3814
01:52:27,831 --> 01:52:30,050
but also building it
into the product itself.

3815
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:34,430
I think one of the things that I've
really loved about a new product launch,

3816
01:52:34,431 --> 01:52:38,420
what we've done is to disable any sort
of ranking in the home timeline if you

3817
01:52:38,421 --> 01:52:41,000
want and you don't have to see
our algorithms at play anymore.

3818
01:52:41,330 --> 01:52:43,160
These are the kinds of things
that we're thinking about.

3819
01:52:43,161 --> 01:52:44,960
How do we give power back to the people,

3820
01:52:45,290 --> 01:52:48,950
our service so that they can see what
they want to see and they can participate

3821
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:51,740
the way they want to participate and
this is longterm and I get there,

3822
01:52:51,741 --> 01:52:52,574
we're not there yet,

3823
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:53,930
but this is how we're thinking about it

3824
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:55,900
and you can imagine where that goes.

3825
01:52:55,901 --> 01:53:00,901
I mean an interest one switch and
turning all the algorithms off or what,

3826
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:01,901
what does that do?

3827
01:53:01,901 --> 01:53:02,734
What does that look like?

3828
01:53:02,920 --> 01:53:03,251
Um,

3829
01:53:03,251 --> 01:53:06,250
so these are the conversations
that we're having in the company,

3830
01:53:06,251 --> 01:53:08,140
whether they be good ideas or bad ideas.

3831
01:53:08,141 --> 01:53:09,700
We haven't determined that just yet,

3832
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:10,900
but we,

3833
01:53:11,020 --> 01:53:11,311
we,

3834
01:53:11,311 --> 01:53:13,270
we definitely look,

3835
01:53:13,271 --> 01:53:18,271
I definitely understand the mistrust that
people have in our company and myself

3836
01:53:18,730 --> 01:53:23,620
in the corporate structure and all the
variables that are associated with it,

3837
01:53:23,621 --> 01:53:26,290
including who chooses to
buy on the public market,

3838
01:53:26,291 --> 01:53:27,280
who chooses not to.

3839
01:53:27,410 --> 01:53:27,610
I,

3840
01:53:27,610 --> 01:53:31,210
I get all of it and I
grew up on the Internet.

3841
01:53:31,390 --> 01:53:35,620
I'm a believer in the internet principles
and I want to do everything in my

3842
01:53:35,621 --> 01:53:38,470
power to make sure that we are
consistent with those ideals.

3843
01:53:38,860 --> 01:53:39,611
At the same time,

3844
01:53:39,611 --> 01:53:43,330
I want to make sure that every single
person and do everything in my power has

3845
01:53:43,331 --> 01:53:45,070
the opportunity to participate.

3846
01:53:45,230 --> 01:53:46,990
So let me ask you a question then,

3847
01:53:47,020 --> 01:53:47,440
um,

3848
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:48,730
for your policy as it pertains to say,

3849
01:53:48,731 --> 01:53:49,564
Saudi Arabia,

3850
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:50,561
right?

3851
01:53:50,561 --> 01:53:52,660
Do you enforce the same hate
speech rules on Saudi Arabia?

3852
01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:55,210
Are Our roles are global?

3853
01:53:55,211 --> 01:53:56,980
We enforced them against everyone.

3854
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:59,740
So even in countries where
it's criminal to be LGBT,

3855
01:53:59,741 --> 01:54:02,240
you will still banned someone for,

3856
01:54:02,241 --> 01:54:03,790
for saying something disparaging to,

3857
01:54:03,791 --> 01:54:05,110
or it was saying
something to that to that,

3858
01:54:05,170 --> 01:54:06,003
to that effect.

3859
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:08,440
Like let's say Saudi Arabia sent in,

3860
01:54:08,441 --> 01:54:10,460
someone's took to death for a,

3861
01:54:10,570 --> 01:54:11,860
I don't want to call it
how your base specific,

3862
01:54:11,861 --> 01:54:12,521
let's call it Iran Ron,

3863
01:54:12,521 --> 01:54:15,100
because I believe that's the big focus
right now with Trump administration.

3864
01:54:15,550 --> 01:54:16,061
Iran.

3865
01:54:16,061 --> 01:54:18,040
It's my understanding it's
still punishable by death.

3866
01:54:18,041 --> 01:54:18,874
I could be wrong,

3867
01:54:19,240 --> 01:54:20,073
but it is criminal.

3868
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:23,440
If someone then directly targets
one of these individuals,

3869
01:54:23,560 --> 01:54:24,610
will you ban them?

3870
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:25,331
I mean,

3871
01:54:25,331 --> 01:54:26,410
do you guys function any round?

3872
01:54:26,411 --> 01:54:27,630
Cause I think we're blocked in Iran.

3873
01:54:27,680 --> 01:54:27,910
Yeah,

3874
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:28,743
that's what I figured.

3875
01:54:28,810 --> 01:54:30,040
But there are some countries where,

3876
01:54:30,220 --> 01:54:30,731
for instance,

3877
01:54:30,731 --> 01:54:34,360
I'm Michelle Malkin recently got really
angry because she received notice that

3878
01:54:34,361 --> 01:54:36,220
she violated blasphemy laws in Pakistan.

3879
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:37,450
Right.

3880
01:54:37,450 --> 01:54:39,730
So you do follow some
laws in some countries,

3881
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:41,200
but it's not a viable,

3882
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,780
I guess the question I'm
asking you is in Pakistan,

3883
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:45,850
it's very clearly a different culture.

3884
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:47,020
They don't agree with your rules.

3885
01:54:47,230 --> 01:54:48,820
We do have a per country takedown,

3886
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,360
meaning that I'm content might be
nonvisible within that country,

3887
01:54:52,361 --> 01:54:53,920
but visible throughout
the rest of the world.

3888
01:54:54,250 --> 01:54:54,950
But so

3889
01:54:54,950 --> 01:54:55,101
look,

3890
01:54:55,101 --> 01:54:55,850
I guess the question,

3891
01:54:55,850 --> 01:54:57,080
just to add onto what Jack's saying,

3892
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:58,280
we actually are very,

3893
01:54:58,281 --> 01:54:59,420
very transparent about this.

3894
01:54:59,421 --> 01:55:02,210
So we publish a transparency
report every six months.

3895
01:55:02,211 --> 01:55:02,751
The details,

3896
01:55:02,751 --> 01:55:06,440
every single request that we get from
every government around the world and the

3897
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:08,060
content that they ask us to remove.

3898
01:55:08,061 --> 01:55:10,370
And we post that to an
independent third party site.

3899
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:14,930
So you could go right now and look and
see every single request that comes from

3900
01:55:14,931 --> 01:55:18,080
the Pakistani government and what
content they're trying to remove from

3901
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:18,914
Pakistan.

3902
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:19,720
And I,

3903
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:19,930
I've,

3904
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:22,480
I've seen a lot of conservatives get
angry about this and it's kind of

3905
01:55:22,481 --> 01:55:22,960
confusing,

3906
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:23,321
confusing.

3907
01:55:23,321 --> 01:55:23,561
I'm like,

3908
01:55:23,561 --> 01:55:24,394
this is a really good thing.

3909
01:55:24,490 --> 01:55:26,470
I would want to know if
Pakistan wanted to kill me.

3910
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:27,673
No anger,

3911
01:55:27,680 --> 01:55:29,560
a blasphemy laws posting
pictures of Muhammad.

3912
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:30,760
So,

3913
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:31,060
uh,

3914
01:55:31,060 --> 01:55:31,570
it's a,

3915
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:32,050
it's a crime.

3916
01:55:32,050 --> 01:55:33,790
Are they angry about
our transparency report?

3917
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:34,330
Are there,

3918
01:55:34,330 --> 01:55:34,960
there's,

3919
01:55:34,960 --> 01:55:39,250
there's a perception that you sending
that notice is like a threat against them

3920
01:55:39,251 --> 01:55:40,570
for violating blasphemy laws.

3921
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:43,710
Whereas it's very clearly just letting
you know a government has taken action

3922
01:55:43,711 --> 01:55:44,300
against you,

3923
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:47,350
which it's saying that the government
has restricted access to that content in

3924
01:55:47,351 --> 01:55:48,011
that country.

3925
01:55:48,011 --> 01:55:52,120
And the reason we tell users or tell
people that that's happened is because a

3926
01:55:52,121 --> 01:55:55,630
lot of them may want to file their own
suit against the government or a lot of

3927
01:55:55,631 --> 01:55:59,590
them may be in danger if they happen
to be under that particular governments

3928
01:55:59,591 --> 01:56:03,100
jurisdiction and they may want to take
action to protect themselves if they know

3929
01:56:03,101 --> 01:56:05,290
that the government is looking
at the content in their accounts.

3930
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:07,120
So we don't always know.

3931
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,660
We don't,

3932
01:56:07,660 --> 01:56:09,040
we send the notice to everybody,

3933
01:56:09,041 --> 01:56:11,440
we don't always know where you
are or what country you live in.

3934
01:56:11,710 --> 01:56:15,430
And so we just send that notice as like
to try to be as transparent as possible.

3935
01:56:15,550 --> 01:56:15,740
The,

3936
01:56:15,740 --> 01:56:20,710
the main point I was trying to get to
is your policies support a community,

3937
01:56:20,890 --> 01:56:23,730
but there may be laws in a certain country
that does not support that community

3938
01:56:23,731 --> 01:56:24,564
and finds a criminal.

3939
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:25,211
Right.

3940
01:56:25,211 --> 01:56:28,780
So your actions are now directly opposed
to the culture of another name of the

3941
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:29,560
country.

3942
01:56:29,560 --> 01:56:33,520
I guess the point I'm trying to make
is that if you enforce your values,

3943
01:56:33,521 --> 01:56:34,400
which are uh,

3944
01:56:34,990 --> 01:56:35,590
you know,

3945
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:37,630
perceivably not even the
majority of this country,

3946
01:56:37,631 --> 01:56:38,070
if you're,

3947
01:56:38,070 --> 01:56:38,290
you know,

3948
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:41,020
consider yourselves more liberal leaning
and you're half of the United States,

3949
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:43,990
but you're enforcing those rules on the
rest of the world that use the service.

3950
01:56:44,020 --> 01:56:46,840
It's sort of forcing other
cultures 20 or to yours.

3951
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,040
So a lot of,

3952
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:54,040
a lot of our rules are based in more the
UN declaration that isn't just purely

3953
01:56:55,140 --> 01:56:55,830
us.

3954
01:56:55,830 --> 01:56:58,760
Doesn't the UN declaration guarantee the
right of all people through any medium

3955
01:56:58,761 --> 01:56:59,720
to express their opinion?

3956
01:57:00,080 --> 01:57:00,913
It does.

3957
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,760
And it also has,

3958
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:03,160
can,

3959
01:57:03,160 --> 01:57:05,360
it also has conditions
around particular speech,

3960
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:06,380
inciting violence.

3961
01:57:06,740 --> 01:57:07,190
Um,

3962
01:57:07,190 --> 01:57:08,030
and um,

3963
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:08,750
some of the,

3964
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:10,640
some of the aspects that
we speak to as well,

3965
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:12,530
and it protects from the covenant

3966
01:57:12,740 --> 01:57:13,230
stories,

3967
01:57:13,230 --> 01:57:14,041
whether it's religion,

3968
01:57:14,041 --> 01:57:14,610
race,

3969
01:57:14,610 --> 01:57:15,443
gender,

3970
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:16,501
sexual orientation,

3971
01:57:16,501 --> 01:57:20,430
those are all also protected under the
UN covenant to Protect Human Rights.

3972
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:23,030
Ooh,

3973
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:24,140
we'll give that a pause.

3974
01:57:27,450 --> 01:57:29,890
I'm sure we have many more
things to talk about Doug.

3975
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:30,370
No worries.

3976
01:57:30,370 --> 01:57:33,260
I don't want to just just saying this
has got a bunch of other things that,

3977
01:57:33,490 --> 01:57:33,671
you know,

3978
01:57:33,671 --> 01:57:34,391
cause here's the thing,

3979
01:57:34,391 --> 01:57:37,720
there's a bunch of other issues having
to do with bias and censorship and I feel

3980
01:57:37,721 --> 01:57:40,600
like we've kind of beaten
that horse relentlessly.

3981
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:42,200
But I think that horse is good to beat.

3982
01:57:43,190 --> 01:57:46,420
It's also good to address why the
worst is being beaten and why,

3983
01:57:46,450 --> 01:57:47,810
why it exists in the first place.

3984
01:57:48,200 --> 01:57:48,650
Um,

3985
01:57:48,650 --> 01:57:49,483
and I,

3986
01:57:49,690 --> 01:57:50,670
I really,

3987
01:57:50,920 --> 01:57:52,070
I want to say this again.

3988
01:57:52,100 --> 01:57:55,700
I really appreciate the fact that you
guys are so open and that you're willing

3989
01:57:55,701 --> 01:57:57,890
to come on here and talk about
this cause you don't have to.

3990
01:57:58,130 --> 01:58:00,770
This is your decision and especially you,

3991
01:58:00,771 --> 01:58:01,101
Jack,

3992
01:58:01,101 --> 01:58:03,050
after we had that first
conversation and the,

3993
01:58:03,220 --> 01:58:04,520
the blow back was so hard,

3994
01:58:04,700 --> 01:58:06,590
you wanted to come and clarify this.

3995
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:11,690
And I think this is so important to
give people a true understanding of what

3996
01:58:11,931 --> 01:58:14,060
your intentions are versus
what perceptions are.

3997
01:58:14,630 --> 01:58:14,751
You.

3998
01:58:14,751 --> 01:58:15,584
Appreciate it.

3999
01:58:15,830 --> 01:58:17,020
Thank you for hosting us again.

4000
01:58:17,030 --> 01:58:17,863
And um,

4001
01:58:18,290 --> 01:58:18,480
look,

4002
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:19,313
I,

4003
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:23,840
I think it's also important
that the company is not just me.

4004
01:58:24,090 --> 01:58:29,090
We have people in the company who are
really good at this and are making some

4005
01:58:30,411 --> 01:58:33,290
really tough decisions and
having tough conversations and,

4006
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:38,610
and getting pushed back and
getting feedback and they
have the best intentions.

4007
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:40,160
So what,

4008
01:58:40,160 --> 01:58:41,260
so let's,

4009
01:58:41,620 --> 01:58:42,000
I'll,

4010
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,680
I'll get back into the meat of things
to get to beating the dead horse.

4011
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:47,500
I don't know if you have any data on
why Jacob Wall was recently banned.

4012
01:58:48,100 --> 01:58:48,770
Do you have that?

4013
01:58:48,770 --> 01:58:49,340
Uh,

4014
01:58:49,340 --> 01:58:49,810
uh,

4015
01:58:49,810 --> 01:58:50,643
I believe

4016
01:58:50,720 --> 01:58:51,600
who is chicken wall?

4017
01:58:51,900 --> 01:58:52,733
He's a,

4018
01:58:52,770 --> 01:58:54,510
I don't know how to describe me
as a conservative personality,

4019
01:58:54,511 --> 01:58:55,380
but he's very,

4020
01:58:55,381 --> 01:58:56,090
very,

4021
01:58:56,090 --> 01:58:56,280
uh,

4022
01:58:56,280 --> 01:58:59,370
controversial for like
fake news or something.

4023
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:01,530
I don't know too much about them so
I don't want to accuse them of things

4024
01:59:01,531 --> 01:59:02,370
because I don't know who he is.

4025
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:03,691
But he was,

4026
01:59:03,691 --> 01:59:04,200
uh,

4027
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:08,250
he was in something where
you tried accusing Muller
of like sexual assaults and

4028
01:59:08,251 --> 01:59:10,380
it turned out to be like
just completely fake,

4029
01:59:10,381 --> 01:59:11,200
ridiculous.

4030
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:11,550
Good.

4031
01:59:11,550 --> 01:59:15,900
This was a gentleman that was in the USA
Today article where he admitted that he

4032
01:59:15,901 --> 01:59:17,130
was going to,

4033
01:59:17,131 --> 01:59:22,131
he had a use tactics in
the past to influence the
election and he will continue

4034
01:59:23,071 --> 01:59:24,660
to do so using all of his channels.

4035
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:25,553
Yes.

4036
01:59:25,640 --> 01:59:27,060
When we saw that report,

4037
01:59:27,061 --> 01:59:27,750
our team,

4038
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:28,230
um,

4039
01:59:28,230 --> 01:59:29,100
looked at his account,

4040
01:59:29,101 --> 01:59:31,650
we noticed there were multiple
accounts tied to his account,

4041
01:59:31,651 --> 01:59:34,650
so fake accounts that he had created that
we're discussing political issues and

4042
01:59:34,651 --> 01:59:39,651
pretending to be other people from other
firms that we would have phone numbers,

4043
01:59:40,471 --> 01:59:43,560
linking accounts together or
email addresses and some cases,

4044
01:59:43,561 --> 01:59:44,251
Ip addresses,

4045
01:59:44,251 --> 01:59:46,720
other types of metadata that
are associated with accounts.

4046
01:59:46,721 --> 01:59:48,330
So we can link those accounts together.

4047
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:52,800
And having multiple accounts in and of
itself is not a violation of our rules

4048
01:59:52,801 --> 01:59:55,440
because some people will
have their work account,

4049
01:59:55,470 --> 01:59:56,303
the personal account.

4050
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:59,940
It's when you're deliberately pretending
to be someone else and manipulating a

4051
01:59:59,941 --> 02:00:01,890
conversation about a political issue.

4052
02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:03,180
And those are exactly the stint,

4053
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,450
the types of things that
we saw the Russians do,

4054
02:00:06,451 --> 02:00:07,041
for example,

4055
02:00:07,041 --> 02:00:08,120
in the 2016 elections.

4056
02:00:08,121 --> 02:00:12,540
So it was that playbook and that type of
activity that we saw about Jacob Wall.

4057
02:00:12,840 --> 02:00:14,610
And that's why his
accounts were suspended.

4058
02:00:14,730 --> 02:00:16,260
Did you investigate Jonathan Morgan?

4059
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:17,820
I don't know who that is.

4060
02:00:18,060 --> 02:00:18,893
Why the,

4061
02:00:19,730 --> 02:00:19,950
that's,

4062
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:21,250
that's the important question of why I,

4063
02:00:21,300 --> 02:00:21,930
I don't,

4064
02:00:21,930 --> 02:00:22,860
I don't know who that is,

4065
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:23,220
but that's,

4066
02:00:23,220 --> 02:00:23,880
that's,

4067
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:25,950
it might be that someone at
Twitter investigated him.

4068
02:00:25,951 --> 02:00:26,870
I personally don't know.

4069
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:27,700
So,

4070
02:00:27,700 --> 02:00:28,090
uh,

4071
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:31,720
one of the issues that I think is really
important to get to is you should know

4072
02:00:31,721 --> 02:00:32,290
who he is.

4073
02:00:32,290 --> 02:00:34,150
He's more important than Jacob Wallets,

4074
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:34,781
but for some reason,

4075
02:00:34,781 --> 02:00:37,130
you know about this conservative
guy and not the Democrat who,

4076
02:00:37,220 --> 02:00:39,220
who helped metal in the Alabama election.

4077
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:39,730
Well,

4078
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:40,563
so Jonathan,

4079
02:00:40,750 --> 02:00:42,870
according to near sheer volume,

4080
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:44,040
they have to pay attention to it.

4081
02:00:44,041 --> 02:00:44,230
Right?

4082
02:00:44,230 --> 02:00:44,500
Right,

4083
02:00:44,500 --> 02:00:44,920
right.

4084
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:45,620
But it's,

4085
02:00:45,620 --> 02:00:48,460
it's about grains of sand making a heap
and the flow of a direction where we can

4086
02:00:48,461 --> 02:00:50,260
see Jacob Wall has said he's done this.

4087
02:00:50,261 --> 02:00:50,621
So you're like,

4088
02:00:50,621 --> 02:00:51,221
we're gonna investigate.

4089
02:00:51,221 --> 02:00:52,054
We banned him.

4090
02:00:52,240 --> 02:00:55,690
It was recently reported and covered by
numerous outlets that a group called new

4091
02:00:55,691 --> 02:00:59,920
knowledge was meddling in the Alabama
election by creating fake Russian accounts

4092
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:03,190
to manipulate national media and to
believing that Roy Moore was propped up by

4093
02:01:03,191 --> 02:01:03,940
the Russians.

4094
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:05,830
Facebook banned him and as
well as for their people.

4095
02:01:05,831 --> 02:01:06,664
But Twitter didn't,

4096
02:01:06,700 --> 02:01:07,230
he's still at it

4097
02:01:07,230 --> 02:01:09,720
did ban the accounts that
were engaged in the behavior.

4098
02:01:09,920 --> 02:01:10,753
I do remember that.

4099
02:01:10,850 --> 02:01:12,830
I do remember signing
this division in our team.

4100
02:01:13,100 --> 02:01:13,870
That's worse though.

4101
02:01:13,870 --> 02:01:15,290
So you didn't bend the guy doing it,

4102
02:01:15,291 --> 02:01:16,430
but you band the people like

4103
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:18,210
so in the case of Jacob Wall,

4104
02:01:18,211 --> 02:01:21,690
we were able to directly attribute
through email addresses and phone numbers,

4105
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:25,680
his direct connection to the accounts
that were created to manipulate the

4106
02:01:25,681 --> 02:01:26,370
election.

4107
02:01:26,370 --> 02:01:30,180
If we're not able to tie that direct
connection on our platform or law

4108
02:01:30,181 --> 02:01:33,720
enforcement doesn't give us
information to tie attribution,

4109
02:01:34,020 --> 02:01:35,370
we won't take action.

4110
02:01:35,371 --> 02:01:36,990
And it's not because
of political ideology,

4111
02:01:36,991 --> 02:01:39,290
it's because we want to be damn
sure before we take action it.

4112
02:01:39,291 --> 02:01:44,150
So someone could use a VPN perhaps and
maybe additional email accounts and they

4113
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:45,140
could game the system in that.

4114
02:01:45,141 --> 02:01:47,720
We are certainly sophisticated
ways that people can,

4115
02:01:47,960 --> 02:01:48,700
can do,

4116
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:49,220
uh,

4117
02:01:49,220 --> 02:01:52,390
things to mask who they are and what
accounts that they're controlling.

4118
02:01:52,470 --> 02:01:56,340
Interesting internal conversation to
just to provide more light and to what

4119
02:01:56,341 --> 02:01:56,790
happens.

4120
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:57,750
Like I got a,

4121
02:01:57,900 --> 02:02:00,030
I got an email or a text from Vigia,

4122
02:02:00,660 --> 02:02:01,440
um,

4123
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,790
one morning and said,

4124
02:02:02,850 --> 02:02:07,050
we are going to permanently suspend
those particular account and it's not a,

4125
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:08,130
you know,

4126
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:09,090
what do you think it's,

4127
02:02:09,140 --> 02:02:10,260
we are going to do this.

4128
02:02:10,290 --> 02:02:13,620
And I then have an
opportunity at task questions.

4129
02:02:13,621 --> 02:02:17,460
I asked a question why she gave me a
link back to the document of all the

4130
02:02:17,461 --> 02:02:19,440
findings and USA Today.

4131
02:02:19,950 --> 02:02:20,370
Um,

4132
02:02:20,370 --> 02:02:21,840
we took the action.

4133
02:02:21,870 --> 02:02:22,740
I was on Twitter.

4134
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:27,580
A bunch of people pointed me at this
particular case since some of those tweets

4135
02:02:27,581 --> 02:02:29,220
to her what's going on?

4136
02:02:29,550 --> 02:02:32,160
So that's well that's in the background.

4137
02:02:32,290 --> 02:02:34,840
Wouldn't you just terminate anybody
associated with the company that was doing

4138
02:02:34,841 --> 02:02:35,051
this?

4139
02:02:35,051 --> 02:02:36,400
I mean you keep in mind too,

4140
02:02:36,401 --> 02:02:38,080
at the time when this
campaign was happening,

4141
02:02:38,370 --> 02:02:40,380
this is what pieces he had,

4142
02:02:40,450 --> 02:02:43,540
he admitted to engaging in the operation
in a quote to New York Times and you

4143
02:02:43,541 --> 02:02:44,830
banned the accounts associated with it.

4144
02:02:44,831 --> 02:02:46,450
So if you know he's the
one running the company,

4145
02:02:46,451 --> 02:02:46,991
wouldn't you be like,

4146
02:02:46,991 --> 02:02:47,180
okay,

4147
02:02:47,180 --> 02:02:48,013
your gun,

4148
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:49,110
um,

4149
02:02:49,110 --> 02:02:52,860
do you want us to take every single
newspaper accounts attribution?

4150
02:02:52,890 --> 02:02:55,560
Because what we were able to do in the
Jacob Wall situation was actually tie

4151
02:02:55,561 --> 02:02:57,360
those accounts in our own systems,

4152
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,050
right.

4153
02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:59,850
That he will actually control the rounds.

4154
02:02:59,860 --> 02:03:01,440
Not just take the word of a newspaper.

4155
02:03:01,690 --> 02:03:01,890
Yeah.

4156
02:03:01,890 --> 02:03:02,600
You can have a second.

4157
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:03,720
You said you band his accounts.

4158
02:03:04,410 --> 02:03:04,830
Yes.

4159
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:08,680
And you know from his own statement
and from his tweets that he was the run

4160
02:03:08,681 --> 02:03:08,970
running,

4161
02:03:08,970 --> 02:03:09,803
running the company.

4162
02:03:10,170 --> 02:03:11,003
Jacob Wall.

4163
02:03:11,070 --> 02:03:11,180
No,

4164
02:03:11,180 --> 02:03:11,281
no,

4165
02:03:11,281 --> 02:03:11,380
no,

4166
02:03:11,380 --> 02:03:11,451
no,

4167
02:03:11,451 --> 02:03:11,621
no.

4168
02:03:11,621 --> 02:03:12,340
Jonathan Morgan.

4169
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:12,461
Oh,

4170
02:03:12,461 --> 02:03:13,220
sorry.

4171
02:03:13,220 --> 02:03:14,053
I'm getting confused.

4172
02:03:14,200 --> 02:03:14,490
So,

4173
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:14,970
uh,

4174
02:03:14,970 --> 02:03:15,800
uh,

4175
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:16,640
Jacob Wall,

4176
02:03:16,670 --> 02:03:18,440
it's announced in the USA Today.

4177
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:18,891
He says,

4178
02:03:18,891 --> 02:03:19,910
I'm doing this and you're like,

4179
02:03:19,911 --> 02:03:20,151
okay,

4180
02:03:20,151 --> 02:03:21,410
we can look at as like how we can see it.

4181
02:03:21,411 --> 02:03:22,850
We get rid of him with,

4182
02:03:22,851 --> 02:03:23,780
with new knowledge.

4183
02:03:23,781 --> 02:03:24,580
You said you did

4184
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:25,413
those counts down?

4185
02:03:25,570 --> 02:03:29,090
I believe we were able to take down a
certain cluster of accounts that we saw

4186
02:03:29,140 --> 02:03:30,220
engaging in the behavior,

4187
02:03:30,221 --> 02:03:34,250
but we weren't necessarily able to tie
it back to one person controlling those.

4188
02:03:34,251 --> 02:03:36,880
Like even if they say they did
it and this is where I get back.

4189
02:03:36,881 --> 02:03:40,960
Like we like to have some
sort of attribution that's
the direct that we can see.

4190
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:46,090
Would we just take the any newspaper
or any article at face value and just

4191
02:03:46,091 --> 02:03:46,810
action them.

4192
02:03:46,810 --> 02:03:47,021
That's it.

4193
02:03:47,021 --> 02:03:47,111
Go.

4194
02:03:47,111 --> 02:03:51,400
Do you have to contact him and get some
sort of a statement from him in order to

4195
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,450
take down as account?

4196
02:03:52,451 --> 02:03:55,920
And obviously I don't think he would
admit to manipulating Twitter if Twitter

4197
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,411
asked him.

4198
02:03:56,411 --> 02:03:59,950
So get the fact that he
communicated with a newspaper.

4199
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:00,330
Right.

4200
02:04:00,330 --> 02:04:01,200
To clarify,

4201
02:04:01,290 --> 02:04:01,650
uh,

4202
02:04:01,650 --> 02:04:02,281
what they said,

4203
02:04:02,281 --> 02:04:05,070
what they claimed to the New York
Times was that it was a false flag.

4204
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:06,240
Uh,

4205
02:04:06,240 --> 02:04:09,000
New York Times said they reviewed
internal documents that showed,

4206
02:04:09,030 --> 02:04:11,010
they admitted it was a
false flag operation.

4207
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:12,030
Um,

4208
02:04:12,030 --> 02:04:13,830
the guy who runs the company said,

4209
02:04:13,890 --> 02:04:14,101
Oh,

4210
02:04:14,101 --> 02:04:14,970
his company does this.

4211
02:04:14,971 --> 02:04:17,430
He wasn't a aware necessarily,

4212
02:04:17,640 --> 02:04:19,230
but it was an experiment.

4213
02:04:19,320 --> 02:04:19,721
So He's,

4214
02:04:19,721 --> 02:04:20,820
he's given kind of a,

4215
02:04:20,850 --> 02:04:21,451
in my opinion,

4216
02:04:21,451 --> 02:04:22,284
duplicitous,

4217
02:04:22,290 --> 02:04:23,123
like,

4218
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:23,581
you know,

4219
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:24,450
not straight forward,

4220
02:04:24,480 --> 02:04:25,980
but at the time of this campaign,

4221
02:04:25,981 --> 02:04:27,180
which he claims to know about,

4222
02:04:27,630 --> 02:04:28,980
he tweeted that it was real.

4223
02:04:29,100 --> 02:04:30,480
So during the Roy Moore campaign,

4224
02:04:30,481 --> 02:04:31,314
he tweets,

4225
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:31,771
wow,

4226
02:04:31,771 --> 02:04:32,610
look at the Russians.

4227
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:33,870
Then it comes out later.

4228
02:04:33,871 --> 02:04:35,160
His company is the one that did it.

4229
02:04:35,550 --> 02:04:36,300
So you're kind of like,

4230
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:36,451
oh,

4231
02:04:36,451 --> 02:04:38,850
so this guy was up his own fake news.

4232
02:04:39,360 --> 02:04:39,930
Right.

4233
02:04:39,930 --> 02:04:41,310
Then when they get busted he goes,

4234
02:04:41,311 --> 02:04:41,731
oh no,

4235
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:43,290
it's just my company doing an experiment.

4236
02:04:43,350 --> 02:04:44,970
But You tweeted it with real pyramid,

4237
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:48,450
you use your verified Twitter account
to push the fake narrative your company

4238
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:49,560
was pumping on this platform.

4239
02:04:50,220 --> 02:04:50,491
And so,

4240
02:04:50,491 --> 02:04:51,390
so the point I want to make,

4241
02:04:51,391 --> 02:04:52,180
I guess is

4242
02:04:52,180 --> 02:04:54,140
it sounds like we need to
take a closer look at this one

4243
02:04:54,190 --> 02:04:55,580
ban and bring back Morgan murder.

4244
02:04:55,660 --> 02:04:56,493
Well,

4245
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:57,410
Meghan Murphy,

4246
02:04:57,410 --> 02:04:58,243
Megan Murphy,

4247
02:04:58,370 --> 02:04:58,820
sorry.

4248
02:04:58,820 --> 02:04:59,990
Morgan Murphy is a friend of mine.

4249
02:05:00,190 --> 02:05:00,350
Te,

4250
02:05:00,350 --> 02:05:00,730
te Te.

4251
02:05:00,730 --> 02:05:01,563
Te to,

4252
02:05:01,730 --> 02:05:02,563
sorry Morgan.

4253
02:05:03,830 --> 02:05:04,520
So this is the,

4254
02:05:04,520 --> 02:05:05,211
I haven't read the story.

4255
02:05:05,211 --> 02:05:06,770
It's been like two months
since the story broke.

4256
02:05:06,771 --> 02:05:07,730
So I could have my,

4257
02:05:07,790 --> 02:05:08,300
you know,

4258
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:08,721
I don't want to,

4259
02:05:08,721 --> 02:05:10,700
I don't want to get sued
and have my facts wrong,

4260
02:05:11,030 --> 02:05:13,430
but the reason I brought this up
was not to accuse you of wrongdoing.

4261
02:05:13,431 --> 02:05:16,070
What's the point out that I don't,

4262
02:05:16,071 --> 02:05:19,220
I don't think that the people who work
at Twitter are twirling their mustaches,

4263
02:05:19,221 --> 02:05:19,731
laughing,

4264
02:05:19,731 --> 02:05:19,951
you know,

4265
02:05:19,951 --> 02:05:21,950
bad pressing the ban button
whenever they see a conservative.

4266
02:05:21,951 --> 02:05:22,820
I think it's just,

4267
02:05:23,060 --> 02:05:26,000
there's a bias that's unintentional
that flows in one direction.

4268
02:05:26,210 --> 02:05:29,210
So you see the news about Jacob Wall
and I think there's a reason for it too.

4269
02:05:29,240 --> 02:05:30,440
There's a couple of reasons for one,

4270
02:05:30,770 --> 02:05:31,220
yours,

4271
02:05:31,220 --> 02:05:33,200
your staff is likely more,

4272
02:05:33,270 --> 02:05:36,620
you've mentioned more like the Tylene
left and look at certain sources.

4273
02:05:37,100 --> 02:05:37,431
Uh,

4274
02:05:37,431 --> 02:05:40,370
so you're going to hear about more things
more often and take action on those

4275
02:05:40,371 --> 02:05:42,800
things as opposed to the
other side of the coin.

4276
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:43,570
But,

4277
02:05:43,570 --> 02:05:44,400
but we,

4278
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:46,580
we have to consider like where
the actions are taking place.

4279
02:05:46,630 --> 02:05:50,270
And I'm speaking more broadly to the
4,000 people that we have as a company

4280
02:05:50,271 --> 02:05:53,000
versus deliberateness that
we have on bridges team.

4281
02:05:53,130 --> 02:05:53,931
I just mean when we,

4282
02:05:53,931 --> 02:05:57,260
when we look at a company wide average
of all of your employees and the

4283
02:05:57,261 --> 02:06:00,230
direction they lean versus the new
sources they're willing to read,

4284
02:06:00,260 --> 02:06:01,610
you're going to see a
flow in one direction,

4285
02:06:01,611 --> 02:06:02,570
whether it's intentional or not.

4286
02:06:03,020 --> 02:06:04,280
And so I think the challenges,

4287
02:06:04,490 --> 02:06:08,860
well we don't generally
rely on new sources to find
inspiration of our platform.

4288
02:06:08,900 --> 02:06:10,520
We we're looking at what we're seeing,

4289
02:06:10,521 --> 02:06:13,970
the signals we can see and once in a
while we will get tipped off to something.

4290
02:06:13,971 --> 02:06:16,670
But like for the most part when
we're looking at manipulation,

4291
02:06:16,671 --> 02:06:19,820
it's not like the New York Times can
tell us like what's going on on the

4292
02:06:19,821 --> 02:06:21,970
platform where the ones that
have the metadata ABAG accounts,

4293
02:06:21,971 --> 02:06:24,170
where are the ones that can see
patterns of behavior at scale.

4294
02:06:24,320 --> 02:06:25,400
But I hear your point.

4295
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:29,120
I knew one name and I didn't know another
name and it was because visual said

4296
02:06:29,360 --> 02:06:31,400
you don't work permanently
banning this account.

4297
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:32,690
And yes,

4298
02:06:32,691 --> 02:06:33,090
we,

4299
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:37,760
we didn't have the same sort of findings
in the other particular account,

4300
02:06:37,761 --> 02:06:40,400
which I got feedback on pass to her and,

4301
02:06:40,460 --> 02:06:42,460
and we didn't find what
we needed to find I think,

4302
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:43,081
but to be clear,

4303
02:06:43,081 --> 02:06:45,870
the team had taken action on those
stuff months ago when it actually had

4304
02:06:45,871 --> 02:06:46,310
happened.

4305
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,530
Got It.

4306
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:46,640
Got It.

4307
02:06:46,640 --> 02:06:47,120
Yeah,

4308
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:47,541
I think,

4309
02:06:47,541 --> 02:06:47,931
you know,

4310
02:06:47,931 --> 02:06:48,270
uh,

4311
02:06:48,270 --> 02:06:53,270
a lot of what people assume is
malintent is sometimes fake news.

4312
02:06:53,720 --> 02:06:53,961
You know,

4313
02:06:53,961 --> 02:06:57,140
I think one of my biggest criticisms in
terms of what's going on our culture is

4314
02:06:57,141 --> 02:06:58,490
the news system is,

4315
02:06:58,850 --> 02:06:59,720
like you pointed out,

4316
02:06:59,750 --> 02:07:00,710
although it's changed,

4317
02:07:00,711 --> 02:07:02,240
left wing journalists
only follow themselves.

4318
02:07:02,570 --> 02:07:02,841
I,

4319
02:07:02,841 --> 02:07:03,621
that's my experience.

4320
02:07:03,621 --> 02:07:04,670
I've worked for these companies.

4321
02:07:04,671 --> 02:07:06,470
And so they repeat the same narratives.

4322
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:07,400
They don't get out of their bubble,

4323
02:07:07,401 --> 02:07:07,851
even today.

4324
02:07:07,851 --> 02:07:10,670
They're still in a bubble and they're not
seeing what's happening outside of it.

4325
02:07:11,090 --> 02:07:12,320
And then what happens is,

4326
02:07:12,490 --> 02:07:12,720
you know,

4327
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:13,000
we,

4328
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:13,250
uh,

4329
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:13,791
according to date,

4330
02:07:13,791 --> 02:07:14,780
I think this is from Pew,

4331
02:07:15,900 --> 02:07:18,410
most new journalism jobs
are in blue districts.

4332
02:07:18,590 --> 02:07:20,330
So you've got people who
only hear the same thing.

4333
02:07:20,331 --> 02:07:21,650
They only cover the same stories.

4334
02:07:22,070 --> 02:07:22,820
So if,

4335
02:07:22,820 --> 02:07:23,290
you know,

4336
02:07:23,290 --> 02:07:24,110
um,

4337
02:07:24,110 --> 02:07:24,780
we hear,

4338
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:25,021
uh,

4339
02:07:25,021 --> 02:07:25,890
about Jesse Small light,

4340
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:27,140
we hear about how the stories it goes,

4341
02:07:27,290 --> 02:07:28,070
it goes wild.

4342
02:07:28,070 --> 02:07:30,800
But there's like 800 instances of
Trump supporters wearing maga hats,

4343
02:07:30,801 --> 02:07:31,460
getting beaten.

4344
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:31,761
You know,

4345
02:07:31,761 --> 02:07:34,970
throughout the past couple of years we
had a guy show up to a school in Eugene

4346
02:07:35,290 --> 02:07:36,070
with a gun and fire two

4347
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:38,410
rounds at a cop wearing a smash
the patriarchy and she'll shirt.

4348
02:07:38,650 --> 02:07:40,210
And those stories don't
make the headlines.

4349
02:07:40,211 --> 02:07:40,920
So it's,

4350
02:07:40,920 --> 02:07:41,191
you know,

4351
02:07:41,191 --> 02:07:41,350
when,

4352
02:07:41,350 --> 02:07:43,600
when the journalists are
inherently in a bubble,

4353
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:46,780
the information you're going to get as
a big company who follows these news

4354
02:07:46,781 --> 02:07:49,690
organizations is going to be
inherently one side as well.

4355
02:07:50,110 --> 02:07:52,600
And then you only action you're
gonna be able to take is what you,

4356
02:07:52,601 --> 02:07:52,871
you know,

4357
02:07:52,871 --> 02:07:54,520
you can't ban someone if you
don't know they're doing it.

4358
02:07:54,640 --> 02:07:55,170
But I hear you.

4359
02:07:55,170 --> 02:07:57,040
I think that our biggest issue,

4360
02:07:57,070 --> 02:07:58,900
and the thing that I,

4361
02:07:59,020 --> 02:08:03,160
I want to fix the most is the fact that
we create and sustain and maintain these

4362
02:08:03,161 --> 02:08:03,994
echo chambers.

4363
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:04,470
Yeah.

4364
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:04,790
Well,

4365
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:04,970
you,

4366
02:08:04,970 --> 02:08:07,450
you're rolling out that new feature
that allows you to hide replies,

4367
02:08:07,451 --> 02:08:08,284
right?

4368
02:08:08,320 --> 02:08:08,561
We're,

4369
02:08:08,561 --> 02:08:08,830
we're,

4370
02:08:08,830 --> 02:08:09,371
we're testing,

4371
02:08:09,371 --> 02:08:11,740
we're experimenting with a inability to,

4372
02:08:12,210 --> 02:08:12,700
um,

4373
02:08:12,700 --> 02:08:17,380
enable people to have more control as
you would expect to a host over the

4374
02:08:17,381 --> 02:08:18,010
conversation.

4375
02:08:18,010 --> 02:08:18,461
And like,

4376
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:19,300
Facebook allows that.

4377
02:08:19,630 --> 02:08:19,961
Yeah,

4378
02:08:19,961 --> 02:08:23,860
but I don't think they have the level
of transparency that we want to put into

4379
02:08:23,861 --> 02:08:23,981
it.

4380
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:28,480
So we actually want to show whether a
comment was moderated and then actually

4381
02:08:28,481 --> 02:08:31,210
allow people to see those comments.

4382
02:08:31,270 --> 02:08:31,511
Um,

4383
02:08:31,511 --> 02:08:35,410
so both showing the action that this
person moderated a particular comment and

4384
02:08:35,411 --> 02:08:36,280
then you can actually see the,

4385
02:08:36,510 --> 02:08:37,930
so if it's one click,

4386
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:38,740
one click,

4387
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:39,431
one click over,

4388
02:08:39,431 --> 02:08:40,270
one tap over.

4389
02:08:40,850 --> 02:08:41,140
Um,

4390
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:42,250
that's how we're thinking about it.

4391
02:08:42,251 --> 02:08:43,630
It might change in the future,

4392
02:08:43,631 --> 02:08:44,464
but we,

4393
02:08:44,470 --> 02:08:49,470
we can't do this with a
level of transparency because
we minimize something.

4394
02:08:49,930 --> 02:08:51,490
Visit spoke to earlier,

4395
02:08:51,491 --> 02:08:52,630
which is speaking truth to power,

4396
02:08:52,690 --> 02:08:53,770
holding people to account.

4397
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:57,130
Even things like the fire festival where,

4398
02:08:57,420 --> 02:08:57,640
you know,

4399
02:08:57,640 --> 02:09:01,210
you had these organizers who were
deleting every single comment,

4400
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:03,940
moderating every single comment
that called this thing of fraud.

4401
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,930
And don't go here.

4402
02:09:05,170 --> 02:09:05,890
We can't,

4403
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:06,723
we can't,

4404
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:08,020
we can't reliably.

4405
02:09:08,021 --> 02:09:08,280
And,

4406
02:09:08,280 --> 02:09:11,830
and like just from a
responsibility standpoint,

4407
02:09:11,831 --> 02:09:14,560
ever create a feature that
enables more of that to happen.

4408
02:09:14,980 --> 02:09:17,290
And that's how we're thinking
about even features like this.

4409
02:09:17,410 --> 02:09:19,510
I'm going to jump right off into
a different train cart here.

4410
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:23,470
Has Law enforcement ever asked you to
keep certain people on the platform even

4411
02:09:23,471 --> 02:09:24,640
after they violated your rules?

4412
02:09:26,730 --> 02:09:27,563
Uh,

4413
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:29,110
not that I'm aware.

4414
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:30,633
So then this,

4415
02:09:30,670 --> 02:09:31,061
you know,

4416
02:09:31,061 --> 02:09:31,301
to the,

4417
02:09:31,301 --> 02:09:33,070
to the next question pertained to bias.

4418
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:37,260
You have the issue of Antifa versus
the proud boys and Patriot prayer and a

4419
02:09:37,280 --> 02:09:40,780
Twitter permanently excised anyone
associated with the proud boys antifa

4420
02:09:40,781 --> 02:09:45,160
accounts who have broken
the rules repeatedly branded
known cells that have been

4421
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:46,600
involved in vines all still active.

4422
02:09:47,180 --> 02:09:48,013
Okay.

4423
02:09:48,230 --> 02:09:49,070
Is there a reason?

4424
02:09:49,590 --> 02:09:49,940
Well,

4425
02:09:49,940 --> 02:09:50,870
with the proud boys,

4426
02:09:50,900 --> 02:09:55,900
what we were able to do was actually
look at documentation and announcements

4427
02:09:55,971 --> 02:09:56,600
that,

4428
02:09:56,600 --> 02:09:56,990
you know,

4429
02:09:56,990 --> 02:10:00,290
the leaders of that organization had made
and their use of violence in the real

4430
02:10:00,291 --> 02:10:01,040
world.

4431
02:10:01,040 --> 02:10:04,040
So that was where we were focused
on and subsequent to our decision,

4432
02:10:04,041 --> 02:10:06,230
I believe the FBI also
designated that's not true.

4433
02:10:06,650 --> 02:10:07,130
It's not true.

4434
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:07,550
That's not true.

4435
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:08,000
No.

4436
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,330
Okay.

4437
02:10:08,330 --> 02:10:08,631
No,

4438
02:10:08,631 --> 02:10:09,740
that's not true yet.

4439
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:10,170
You know,

4440
02:10:10,170 --> 02:10:12,200
the proud boys started out as a joke.

4441
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:13,190
Gavin McInnes,

4442
02:10:13,390 --> 02:10:16,880
Anthony [inaudible] who was a part of
opie and Anthony knows his own show,

4443
02:10:17,540 --> 02:10:17,900
tall,

4444
02:10:17,900 --> 02:10:21,800
told me about it happened on his show
because there was a guy that was on the

4445
02:10:21,801 --> 02:10:26,240
show and they made a joke about starting
a gang based on him cause he was a very

4446
02:10:26,241 --> 02:10:27,051
a feminine guy.

4447
02:10:27,051 --> 02:10:28,460
And they would call him the proud boys.

4448
02:10:29,090 --> 02:10:30,400
And I'm the,

4449
02:10:30,401 --> 02:10:33,050
they went into detail about how this thing

4450
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:38,240
from a joke and saying that you could
join the proud boys and everyone was,

4451
02:10:38,290 --> 02:10:38,540
you know,

4452
02:10:38,540 --> 02:10:43,400
it was like being silly to people joining
it and then it becoming this thing to

4453
02:10:43,401 --> 02:10:48,401
fight antifa and then becoming infested
with white nationalists and becoming was

4454
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:50,281
thing well in,

4455
02:10:50,281 --> 02:10:50,581
in,

4456
02:10:50,581 --> 02:10:50,761
in,

4457
02:10:50,761 --> 02:10:52,100
in many ways it hell it was,

4458
02:10:52,370 --> 02:10:57,370
but it's been documented how it started
and what it was and misrepresented as to

4459
02:10:59,480 --> 02:11:00,313
why it was started.

4460
02:11:00,500 --> 02:11:04,010
I think there's some things that
should be clarified about them.

4461
02:11:04,011 --> 02:11:06,560
But Gavin has made a bunch of
statements that crossed the line.

4462
02:11:06,561 --> 02:11:08,060
He claims he claims to be joking.

4463
02:11:08,210 --> 02:11:08,701
And so that's,

4464
02:11:08,701 --> 02:11:10,160
that's what he did on my podcast.

4465
02:11:10,161 --> 02:11:12,170
He was talking to me about Antifa.

4466
02:11:12,420 --> 02:11:16,190
The ANTIFA was blocking people like Ben
Shapiro speeches and things along those

4467
02:11:16,191 --> 02:11:16,491
lines.

4468
02:11:16,491 --> 02:11:18,080
And stopping conservatives for speaking,

4469
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:19,970
you should just just
punch them in the face.

4470
02:11:19,970 --> 02:11:21,430
We're going to have to start
kicking people's asses.

4471
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:22,190
And I was like,

4472
02:11:22,190 --> 02:11:22,281
well,

4473
02:11:22,281 --> 02:11:23,000
this is the risk,

4474
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:26,450
not just irresponsible but foolish and
short sided and it's just a dumb way to

4475
02:11:26,451 --> 02:11:26,960
talk.

4476
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:30,380
So then you have the antifa groups
that are engaging in the same thing.

4477
02:11:30,410 --> 02:11:30,700
We've,

4478
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:30,860
we,

4479
02:11:30,860 --> 02:11:31,101
you know,

4480
02:11:31,101 --> 02:11:33,530
the famous bike lock basher
incident where a guy shut up,

4481
02:11:33,680 --> 02:11:34,513
hit seven,

4482
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:35,180
uh,

4483
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,890
he hit seven people over
that with a bike lock.

4484
02:11:37,490 --> 02:11:38,000
Um,

4485
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:38,990
they subsequently released his,

4486
02:11:38,991 --> 02:11:39,171
damn,

4487
02:11:39,171 --> 02:11:40,550
I'm going to leave that
out for the time being.

4488
02:11:40,850 --> 02:11:43,190
You have other groups like by any means,

4489
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:44,480
by any means necessary.

4490
02:11:44,481 --> 02:11:45,350
You have in,

4491
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:46,184
um,

4492
02:11:46,580 --> 02:11:47,090
uh,

4493
02:11:47,090 --> 02:11:48,110
Portland for instance,

4494
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:49,910
there are specific branded factions.

4495
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,060
There is,

4496
02:11:51,060 --> 02:11:51,370
uh,

4497
02:11:51,370 --> 02:11:51,531
the,

4498
02:11:51,531 --> 02:11:55,340
the tweet I mentioned earlier where
they docs ice agents and they said,

4499
02:11:55,370 --> 02:11:57,290
do whatever inspires you
with this information.

4500
02:11:57,620 --> 02:11:58,071
And I mean,

4501
02:11:58,071 --> 02:11:58,970
you're tagged in it a million times.

4502
02:11:58,970 --> 02:11:59,960
I know you probably can't see it,

4503
02:12:00,260 --> 02:12:02,870
but you can actually see that some of
the tweets and the threat I removed.

4504
02:12:03,050 --> 02:12:06,620
But the main tweet itself from an
antifascist account linking to a website

4505
02:12:07,010 --> 02:12:07,940
straight up saying like,

4506
02:12:07,941 --> 02:12:09,140
here's the private home details,

4507
02:12:09,141 --> 02:12:11,750
phone number addresses of these law
enforcement officers is not removed in

4508
02:12:11,751 --> 02:12:12,584
September.

4509
02:12:12,770 --> 02:12:14,180
So here's what you end up seeing is,

4510
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:15,410
uh,

4511
02:12:15,410 --> 02:12:16,101
again to point.

4512
02:12:16,101 --> 02:12:19,280
I think one of the big problems in this
country is the media because it was

4513
02:12:19,281 --> 02:12:22,460
reported that the FBI designated
probably was an extremist group,

4514
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:24,710
but it was a misinterpretation based.

4515
02:12:24,740 --> 02:12:24,890
Uh,

4516
02:12:24,890 --> 02:12:25,191
uh,

4517
02:12:25,191 --> 02:12:29,780
sheriff wrote a draft saying with the
FBI considers them to be extremists.

4518
02:12:30,110 --> 02:12:33,380
The media then reported hearsay from the
sheriff and the FBI came out and said,

4519
02:12:33,390 --> 02:12:33,511
no,

4520
02:12:33,511 --> 02:12:33,561
no,

4521
02:12:33,561 --> 02:12:33,681
no,

4522
02:12:33,681 --> 02:12:34,461
we never meant to do that.

4523
02:12:34,461 --> 02:12:35,294
That's not true.

4524
02:12:35,410 --> 02:12:36,890
We are just concerned about violence.

4525
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:37,881
So the proud boys,

4526
02:12:37,881 --> 02:12:38,714
I'll get purged.

4527
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,051
And again,

4528
02:12:39,051 --> 02:12:39,410
I think,

4529
02:12:39,410 --> 02:12:39,600
you know,

4530
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:40,490
Gavin's a different story,

4531
02:12:40,491 --> 02:12:40,671
right?

4532
02:12:40,671 --> 02:12:43,040
If you want to go after the individuals
who are associated with that group

4533
02:12:43,130 --> 02:12:44,420
versus the guy who goes on the show.

4534
02:12:44,421 --> 02:12:46,430
And says outrageous things
and goes and Joe show.

4535
02:12:46,860 --> 02:12:48,970
And then you have the
Antifa branded sells.

4536
02:12:48,971 --> 02:12:51,650
Like what I mean by that is
they have specific names.

4537
02:12:51,770 --> 02:12:55,670
They sell merchandise and they're the
ones showing up throwing mortar shells

4538
02:12:55,671 --> 02:12:56,271
into crowds.

4539
02:12:56,271 --> 02:12:57,170
They're the ones showing up with,

4540
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:59,450
with crowbars and bats
and whacking people.

4541
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:03,860
I was in Boston and there was a rally
where conservatives are planning on

4542
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:04,421
putting on a rally.

4543
02:13:04,421 --> 02:13:07,850
It was literally just like Libertarians
and conservatives antifa shows up with

4544
02:13:07,851 --> 02:13:11,840
crowbars bats in balaclavas
with weapons threatening them.

4545
02:13:12,290 --> 02:13:13,850
And so I have to wonder if,

4546
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:14,713
if you know,

4547
02:13:14,720 --> 02:13:16,550
these people are allowed to
organize in your platform.

4548
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,020
Are you concerned about that?

4549
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:19,730
Why aren't they being banned
when they violate the rules?

4550
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:20,660
Yeah,

4551
02:13:20,660 --> 02:13:21,051
absolutely.

4552
02:13:21,051 --> 02:13:21,884
We're concerned about that.

4553
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:24,210
Has the FBI designated them
as a domestic terrorist?

4554
02:13:24,220 --> 02:13:25,053
Yes.

4555
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:25,461
I'm sorry.

4556
02:13:25,461 --> 02:13:28,070
Homeland Security in New Jersey has
listed them under domestic terrorism.

4557
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:28,690
So,

4558
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:33,060
so here I understand is a conundrum in
that the general concept of anti fascism

4559
02:13:33,390 --> 02:13:34,290
is a loose term.

4560
02:13:34,291 --> 02:13:35,460
That means you oppose fascism,

4561
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:35,940
right.

4562
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:38,790
But antifa is now they have a flag.

4563
02:13:38,940 --> 02:13:40,320
They've had a flag since the Soviet,

4564
02:13:40,321 --> 02:13:40,990
you know,

4565
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:43,610
a Nazi Germany in the Soviet era
and they've brought it back there.

4566
02:13:43,620 --> 02:13:47,040
Specific groups that I'm not going to
mention by name that have specific names

4567
02:13:47,041 --> 02:13:47,851
and they sell merchandise.

4568
02:13:47,851 --> 02:13:49,320
They've appeared and various news outlets.

4569
02:13:49,500 --> 02:13:52,260
They've expressed their desire to
use violence to suppress speech.

4570
02:13:52,680 --> 02:13:53,090
There was a,

4571
02:13:53,090 --> 02:13:58,090
is that a centralized organization the
same way that I hear you on proud boys,

4572
02:13:58,611 --> 02:14:01,520
but like where they have like tenants
that are written out and there was a

4573
02:14:01,521 --> 02:14:02,450
leader and like,

4574
02:14:02,980 --> 02:14:03,440
uh,

4575
02:14:03,440 --> 02:14:03,680
no,

4576
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:04,400
it's not the same,

4577
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,140
but there are specific branded cells.

4578
02:14:06,170 --> 02:14:06,861
So that's why I bring them up.

4579
02:14:06,861 --> 02:14:07,281
Specifically,

4580
02:14:07,281 --> 02:14:08,114
I realize,

4581
02:14:08,420 --> 02:14:08,691
you know,

4582
02:14:08,691 --> 02:14:11,270
someone showing up to a rally wearing
a black hoodie and sunglasses.

4583
02:14:11,300 --> 02:14:11,481
We,

4584
02:14:11,481 --> 02:14:12,314
who are you gonna ban?

4585
02:14:12,530 --> 02:14:16,670
But there are groups that that organize
specifically called for violence.

4586
02:14:16,820 --> 02:14:17,060
They,

4587
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:17,300
they,

4588
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:18,590
they pushed the line as close as,

4589
02:14:18,591 --> 02:14:18,811
as,

4590
02:14:18,811 --> 02:14:20,000
as lightly as possible.

4591
02:14:20,270 --> 02:14:22,700
They advocate sabotage
and things like this.

4592
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:23,841
And you know,

4593
02:14:23,841 --> 02:14:25,060
when the proud boys go
out and get in fights,

4594
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:26,450
they're not getting in
fights with themselves.

4595
02:14:26,690 --> 02:14:26,940
They're,

4596
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:27,351
you know,

4597
02:14:27,351 --> 02:14:28,184
so

4598
02:14:28,350 --> 02:14:29,000
point out to the,

4599
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:34,000
they decided to call for violence based
on Antifa calling for violence based on

4600
02:14:34,651 --> 02:14:38,550
Antifa actually actively committing
violence against conservative people that

4601
02:14:38,551 --> 02:14:39,384
were there to see different,

4602
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:39,750
well,

4603
02:14:39,750 --> 02:14:43,540
it partly started because in
Berkeley there was a Trump rally.

4604
02:14:43,541 --> 02:14:46,090
So actually after Milo got
chased out of the Berkeley,

4605
02:14:46,091 --> 02:14:46,360
they were,

4606
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:47,740
there was $100,000 in damages.

4607
02:14:47,950 --> 02:14:48,131
I mean,

4608
02:14:48,131 --> 02:14:50,320
there's a video of some
guy in all black cracking.

4609
02:14:50,321 --> 02:14:52,930
Someone on the back was on the ground
looking like they're unconscious.

4610
02:14:53,380 --> 02:14:56,680
So these conservatives see this and they
decided to hold a rally saying we won't

4611
02:14:56,681 --> 02:14:57,490
back down.

4612
02:14:57,490 --> 02:15:00,880
They hold a rally in Berkeley
and then Antifa shows up again.

4613
02:15:00,881 --> 02:15:02,440
I understand you can't figure
out who these people are.

4614
02:15:02,441 --> 02:15:03,011
For the most part,

4615
02:15:03,011 --> 02:15:04,090
they are decentralized.

4616
02:15:04,510 --> 02:15:06,700
But then this insights,

4617
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:07,151
uh,

4618
02:15:07,151 --> 02:15:08,080
an escalation,

4619
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,880
you then get the rise
of the base to stick.

4620
02:15:09,881 --> 02:15:10,091
Man,

4621
02:15:10,091 --> 02:15:10,451
they called it,

4622
02:15:10,451 --> 02:15:13,870
this guy shows up in armor with a stick
and he starts swinging back and now you

4623
02:15:13,871 --> 02:15:15,010
have two factions forming.

4624
02:15:15,460 --> 02:15:18,880
So while I recognize it's much
easier to ban a top down group,

4625
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:20,140
there are,

4626
02:15:20,140 --> 02:15:20,470
you know,

4627
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:23,110
the difference I would get I guess is
while will you look at the proud boys,

4628
02:15:23,111 --> 02:15:23,591
it's straight,

4629
02:15:23,591 --> 02:15:24,424
top down vertical.

4630
02:15:24,670 --> 02:15:27,640
You look at Antifa and there's different
cells of varying size and their

4631
02:15:27,650 --> 02:15:28,483
different accounts.

4632
02:15:28,780 --> 02:15:29,660
So I have to,

4633
02:15:29,690 --> 02:15:30,070
uh,

4634
02:15:30,070 --> 02:15:31,000
to like,

4635
02:15:31,001 --> 02:15:33,790
I guess the argument I could make as if
you're going to bend the proud boys by

4636
02:15:33,791 --> 02:15:35,440
all means for under your justification.

4637
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:39,970
But if you look at a specific channel
that's got 20,000 followers that cheers

4638
02:15:39,971 --> 02:15:40,780
them on,

4639
02:15:40,780 --> 02:15:40,961
right?

4640
02:15:40,961 --> 02:15:42,730
These are people who throw
mortar shells into crowds.

4641
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,480
Isn't that advocating for terrorism
and incitement to violence?

4642
02:15:46,720 --> 02:15:47,020
Yeah,

4643
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:47,853
absolutely.

4644
02:15:48,880 --> 02:15:51,310
So I guess the question is how
come they don't get removed?

4645
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:52,701
Well,

4646
02:15:52,701 --> 02:15:54,110
in the past when we've looked at,

4647
02:15:54,170 --> 02:15:54,500
um,

4648
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:54,980
antiviral,

4649
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:55,250
we,

4650
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:55,520
it's,

4651
02:15:55,520 --> 02:15:57,200
we ran into this decentralization issue,

4652
02:15:57,201 --> 02:16:00,500
which is we weren't able to find the same
type of information that we were able

4653
02:16:00,501 --> 02:16:01,530
to find about Prometheus,

4654
02:16:01,640 --> 02:16:06,560
which was a centralized leadership base
documentation of what they stand for.

4655
02:16:06,900 --> 02:16:07,550
Um,

4656
02:16:07,550 --> 02:16:08,390
but absolutely.

4657
02:16:08,391 --> 02:16:10,580
I mean it's something that we'll continue
to look into and to the extent that

4658
02:16:10,581 --> 02:16:13,220
they are using Twitter to organize
any sort of offline violence that's

4659
02:16:13,221 --> 02:16:14,660
completely prohibited under our rules.

4660
02:16:14,661 --> 02:16:16,430
And we would absolutely take action.

4661
02:16:16,810 --> 02:16:17,060
Two.

4662
02:16:17,060 --> 02:16:19,060
Why Gavin was Bam that,

4663
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:22,400
was there a specific thing that he did
or was it as the association with the

4664
02:16:22,401 --> 02:16:24,010
proud boys and association
with the problem?

4665
02:16:24,011 --> 02:16:24,171
You know,

4666
02:16:24,171 --> 02:16:28,490
he's a abandoned that he's not only that
he's disassociated themselves with it

4667
02:16:28,491 --> 02:16:30,070
and said that it got out of him

4668
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:31,540
and he doesn't want to have
anything to do with it.

4669
02:16:31,600 --> 02:16:31,930
Yeah.

4670
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:34,810
And I think this is a great test
case for how we think about,

4671
02:16:34,830 --> 02:16:35,440
uh,

4672
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:36,910
getting people back on the platform.

4673
02:16:37,260 --> 02:16:37,500
Yeah.

4674
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:38,110
In the center.

4675
02:16:38,110 --> 02:16:42,490
He's an interesting case because he's
a really a provocateur and he fancies

4676
02:16:42,491 --> 02:16:43,060
himself,

4677
02:16:43,060 --> 02:16:43,271
you know,

4678
02:16:43,271 --> 02:16:44,950
sort of a punk rocker and he just,

4679
02:16:44,951 --> 02:16:46,540
he likes stirring shit.

4680
02:16:46,870 --> 02:16:49,480
I mean [inaudible] when he came
on my show last time he was on,

4681
02:16:49,481 --> 02:16:52,690
he was dressed up like a Michael
Douglas and falling down,

4682
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:53,350
you know,

4683
02:16:53,350 --> 02:16:53,550
he,

4684
02:16:53,550 --> 02:16:54,610
he did it on purpose.

4685
02:16:54,611 --> 02:16:55,900
He brought a briefcase and everything.

4686
02:16:55,901 --> 02:16:56,141
I'm like,

4687
02:16:56,141 --> 02:16:56,770
what are you doing?

4688
02:16:56,770 --> 02:16:59,230
It's like a Michael Douglas
and falling down like he's,

4689
02:16:59,470 --> 02:17:04,470
he's a showman in many ways and he did
not mean for this to it go the way it

4690
02:17:05,471 --> 02:17:06,130
went.

4691
02:17:06,130 --> 02:17:11,130
He thought it would be this
sort of innocent fun thing
to be a part of and then

4692
02:17:11,741 --> 02:17:12,930
other people got involved in it.

4693
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:15,640
And then when people call for violence,

4694
02:17:16,330 --> 02:17:20,110
the problem is they think that you know
you're going to just hit people and

4695
02:17:20,111 --> 02:17:21,070
that's going to solve a problem.

4696
02:17:21,071 --> 02:17:22,900
It just creates a much more,

4697
02:17:22,930 --> 02:17:24,310
much more comprehensive problem.

4698
02:17:24,390 --> 02:17:25,830
Why it's important to point out,

4699
02:17:25,831 --> 02:17:29,010
Gavin said has had meant like you said
things way worse than than Alex Jones

4700
02:17:29,011 --> 02:17:29,580
ever did.

4701
02:17:29,580 --> 02:17:30,020
Sure.

4702
02:17:30,020 --> 02:17:31,680
Whether you want to
say it's a joke or not.

4703
02:17:31,710 --> 02:17:32,730
He said things like,

4704
02:17:32,850 --> 02:17:33,151
you know,

4705
02:17:33,151 --> 02:17:33,690
choke him,

4706
02:17:33,690 --> 02:17:34,840
punch him like directly.

4707
02:17:35,110 --> 02:17:35,943
Yup.

4708
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:40,020
But I guess was the primary reason for
getting rid of them was what you thought

4709
02:17:40,021 --> 02:17:41,670
that the FBI had designated
them an extremist group?

4710
02:17:41,730 --> 02:17:41,881
No,

4711
02:17:41,881 --> 02:17:43,800
cause we did it many months in advance.

4712
02:17:44,100 --> 02:17:44,251
Oh,

4713
02:17:44,251 --> 02:17:44,490
okay.

4714
02:17:44,490 --> 02:17:44,730
Yeah,

4715
02:17:44,730 --> 02:17:45,430
I was just,

4716
02:17:45,430 --> 02:17:45,731
so,

4717
02:17:45,731 --> 02:17:46,300
he just,

4718
02:17:46,300 --> 02:17:48,790
it was just his association
with the proud boys.

4719
02:17:48,990 --> 02:17:52,260
I don't recall and I would have to go
back and I don't want to misstate things.

4720
02:17:52,261 --> 02:17:55,500
I don't recall whether those statements
that you're referring to of Gavin's

4721
02:17:55,501 --> 02:17:55,870
we're on

4722
02:17:55,870 --> 02:17:56,703
Twitter,

4723
02:17:56,830 --> 02:17:57,910
so they weren't.

4724
02:17:58,090 --> 02:17:58,420
Um,

4725
02:17:58,420 --> 02:17:58,960
there's another,

4726
02:17:58,960 --> 02:17:59,231
you know,

4727
02:17:59,231 --> 02:18:02,260
when it comes to the
weaponization of rules against,

4728
02:18:02,320 --> 02:18:07,000
like Gavin isn't creating a compilation
of things he's ever said out of context

4729
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:08,560
and then sending them around
to get himself banned.

4730
02:18:08,620 --> 02:18:10,000
Other people are doing that to him,

4731
02:18:10,001 --> 02:18:12,070
activist who don't like
him and it's effective.

4732
02:18:12,340 --> 02:18:12,761
In fact,

4733
02:18:12,761 --> 02:18:13,930
I would actually like to point out,

4734
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,300
um,

4735
02:18:14,300 --> 02:18:17,950
there's one particular user
who has repeatedly made
fake videos attacking one of

4736
02:18:17,951 --> 02:18:19,300
your other high profile conservatives.

4737
02:18:19,570 --> 02:18:21,100
So much so that he's had
to file police reports,

4738
02:18:21,101 --> 02:18:22,210
harassment complaints,

4739
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:23,110
and it just doesn't stop,

4740
02:18:23,620 --> 02:18:23,861
you know?

4741
02:18:23,861 --> 02:18:26,890
So I guess I'll ask this
after to this regard.

4742
02:18:26,891 --> 02:18:29,440
If someone repeatedly makes
videos of you out of context,

4743
02:18:29,441 --> 02:18:32,110
fake audio accusing you of
doing things you've never done,

4744
02:18:32,140 --> 02:18:33,500
at what point is that valuable?

4745
02:18:34,250 --> 02:18:34,431
Yeah.

4746
02:18:34,431 --> 02:18:34,701
Again,

4747
02:18:34,701 --> 02:18:36,770
if it's targeted harassment
and we can establish that,

4748
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:40,190
it's just a really hard thing with a US
determining whether something is fake or

4749
02:18:40,191 --> 02:18:40,520
not.

4750
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:40,671
Well,

4751
02:18:40,671 --> 02:18:41,420
it's awesome when,

4752
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:42,710
when things are out of context,

4753
02:18:42,980 --> 02:18:44,930
you still have video of
the person saying that.

4754
02:18:44,931 --> 02:18:47,600
I agree that it's not a
contest that it's disingenuous,

4755
02:18:47,990 --> 02:18:52,990
but it's still the person saying it
and you're making a compilation of some

4756
02:18:53,151 --> 02:18:55,100
preexisting or audio or video.

4757
02:18:55,480 --> 02:18:56,420
So I think in,

4758
02:18:56,421 --> 02:18:57,700
in this instance of Gavin,

4759
02:18:57,701 --> 02:18:59,920
like one of the things he said
was like a call to violence,

4760
02:18:59,921 --> 02:19:01,090
but he was talking about,

4761
02:19:01,260 --> 02:19:01,600
uh,

4762
02:19:01,600 --> 02:19:04,840
like it was in the context of talking
about a dog and being scolded.

4763
02:19:04,920 --> 02:19:05,170
Yeah.

4764
02:19:05,170 --> 02:19:05,831
So he was like,

4765
02:19:05,831 --> 02:19:06,101
hit him,

4766
02:19:06,101 --> 02:19:06,521
just hit him.

4767
02:19:06,521 --> 02:19:07,031
And then it's like,

4768
02:19:07,031 --> 02:19:08,290
it turns out he's talking about dog,

4769
02:19:08,320 --> 02:19:09,430
like we're doing something wrong.

4770
02:19:09,620 --> 02:19:09,761
Right.

4771
02:19:09,761 --> 02:19:11,770
And they take that and they
snippet and then it goes viral.

4772
02:19:11,771 --> 02:19:12,880
And everyone that's flagging saying,

4773
02:19:12,881 --> 02:19:13,714
you got to ban this guy.

4774
02:19:14,010 --> 02:19:14,260
Good.

4775
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:14,831
I understand you.

4776
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:15,100
Like,

4777
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:15,820
you know,

4778
02:19:15,820 --> 02:19:16,061
but,

4779
02:19:16,061 --> 02:19:16,241
uh,

4780
02:19:16,241 --> 02:19:19,390
I guess the issue is if people keep
doing that to destroy someone's life.

4781
02:19:19,520 --> 02:19:19,740
So,

4782
02:19:19,740 --> 02:19:20,340
so I think there's,

4783
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:20,561
there's a,

4784
02:19:20,561 --> 02:19:21,700
there's a bigger discussion.

4785
02:19:21,701 --> 02:19:22,150
I think.

4786
02:19:22,150 --> 02:19:22,510
Um,

4787
02:19:22,510 --> 02:19:24,400
both of you could probably shed
some important light on too,

4788
02:19:24,401 --> 02:19:25,234
outside of Twitter.

4789
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:27,980
This weaponization of
content from platforms is

4790
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:30,050
being used to get people banned
from their banking accounts.

4791
02:19:30,470 --> 02:19:30,651
You know,

4792
02:19:30,651 --> 02:19:31,484
they're getting there.

4793
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:33,350
We can talk about patriotic for instance,

4794
02:19:33,351 --> 02:19:33,980
and again I'm not,

4795
02:19:33,980 --> 02:19:34,280
this is,

4796
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:36,500
this may just be something
you could chime in on.

4797
02:19:37,010 --> 02:19:37,970
Patrion band,

4798
02:19:38,030 --> 02:19:39,130
a man named Carl Benjamin,

4799
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:40,220
also known as Sargon of a cod.

4800
02:19:40,310 --> 02:19:43,670
He's also banned from Twitter and it was
because you know why he got banned from

4801
02:19:43,671 --> 02:19:44,340
Twitter.

4802
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:45,030
Um,

4803
02:19:45,030 --> 02:19:46,590
I can see

4804
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:50,660
that's an interesting one.

4805
02:19:52,410 --> 02:19:52,720
Uh,

4806
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:53,670
I do have some,

4807
02:19:53,671 --> 02:19:55,080
some of the details here.

4808
02:19:55,710 --> 02:19:56,543
Um,

4809
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:57,833
do you want me to read them?

4810
02:19:58,140 --> 02:19:58,973
Okay.

4811
02:19:58,980 --> 02:19:59,813
Um,

4812
02:20:00,350 --> 02:20:01,440
it looks like it's going to be growth.

4813
02:20:01,510 --> 02:20:03,450
It's not stuff that I love saying.

4814
02:20:03,870 --> 02:20:04,350
Um,

4815
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:05,183
but I will say it.

4816
02:20:05,220 --> 02:20:07,150
What job said I shouldn't make,

4817
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:09,630
he doesn't like cursing either.

4818
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:10,833
Um,

4819
02:20:11,370 --> 02:20:12,120
let's see.

4820
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:13,150
I curse more than he does,

4821
02:20:13,151 --> 02:20:15,300
so I guess I should say it a first strike.

4822
02:20:15,330 --> 02:20:16,050
Um,

4823
02:20:16,050 --> 02:20:17,910
fuck white people kill all men die.

4824
02:20:17,911 --> 02:20:22,911
CISCOM none of the above qualify
as hate speech one was that,

4825
02:20:23,780 --> 02:20:24,080
uh,

4826
02:20:24,080 --> 02:20:25,050
I don't have the dates.

4827
02:20:25,051 --> 02:20:25,820
I'm sorry.

4828
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:26,310
He's,

4829
02:20:26,310 --> 02:20:27,060
he's a white guy.

4830
02:20:27,060 --> 02:20:29,340
I mean obviously he's joking around there.

4831
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:31,110
Fuck white people.

4832
02:20:31,140 --> 02:20:33,510
It also sounds like he's trying to make
a point about your roles and how you

4833
02:20:33,511 --> 02:20:33,961
enforce them.

4834
02:20:33,961 --> 02:20:34,794
Not Actually,

4835
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:37,620
which is also exactly why
you got kicked off patriarch.

4836
02:20:37,650 --> 02:20:37,951
He was,

4837
02:20:37,951 --> 02:20:38,740
it was exactly.

4838
02:20:38,740 --> 02:20:39,150
Yeah.

4839
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:39,511
Well,

4840
02:20:39,511 --> 02:20:43,200
I know he also posted a
photo of interracial gay porn
at some white nationalists

4841
02:20:43,201 --> 02:20:43,920
to make them angry.

4842
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:44,753
Yes.

4843
02:20:44,910 --> 02:20:45,151
Yeah.

4844
02:20:45,151 --> 02:20:45,984
He's funny.

4845
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:47,971
He's funny.

4846
02:20:47,971 --> 02:20:48,470
As I'm dying,

4847
02:20:48,470 --> 02:20:48,960
I,

4848
02:20:48,960 --> 02:20:53,610
I can understand how a posting that
photo is that agregious violation of the

4849
02:20:53,611 --> 02:20:53,971
rules,

4850
02:20:53,971 --> 02:20:54,241
whether,

4851
02:20:54,241 --> 02:20:56,370
whether or not he was trying
to insult some people.

4852
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:57,270
That's a very good point.

4853
02:20:57,271 --> 02:20:58,320
And I wanted to bring that up.

4854
02:20:58,350 --> 02:21:00,090
Is Porn a violation of the rules?

4855
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:02,593
Uh,

4856
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:03,670
porn generally?

4857
02:21:03,671 --> 02:21:04,150
No.

4858
02:21:04,150 --> 02:21:04,600
Good.

4859
02:21:04,600 --> 02:21:05,433
Really good for you.

4860
02:21:06,010 --> 02:21:08,590
Why would cause any bends
in my feed all the time.

4861
02:21:08,591 --> 02:21:12,790
I follow a couple of naughty girls
and occasionally they post pictures of

4862
02:21:12,791 --> 02:21:14,110
themselves engaging in intercourse.

4863
02:21:14,111 --> 02:21:14,381
I'm like,

4864
02:21:14,381 --> 02:21:15,214
yikes.

4865
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:16,380
So then what,

4866
02:21:16,410 --> 02:21:16,691
what else,

4867
02:21:16,691 --> 02:21:17,800
what are the other strikes for Saigon?

4868
02:21:18,390 --> 02:21:19,000
Um,

4869
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:19,810
let's see.

4870
02:21:19,810 --> 02:21:20,500
Um,

4871
02:21:20,500 --> 02:21:23,020
there was the use of a Jewish slur.

4872
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:24,183
Um,

4873
02:21:24,250 --> 02:21:25,083
how do you use it?

4874
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:27,010
A two or a person.

4875
02:21:27,011 --> 02:21:31,810
You trader remaner white genocide
supporting his Llama file.

4876
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:34,620
Did you were slower lover

4877
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:38,330
that should keep you going
Hashtag Hitler was right,

4878
02:21:38,890 --> 02:21:39,170
but,

4879
02:21:39,170 --> 02:21:40,730
but these are general opinions.

4880
02:21:40,760 --> 02:21:41,820
These are targeted.

4881
02:21:42,110 --> 02:21:46,160
They're targeted at somebody that that
sounds like he's being like he's making a

4882
02:21:46,161 --> 02:21:46,994
joke.

4883
02:21:47,020 --> 02:21:48,900
I understand in context the,

4884
02:21:48,930 --> 02:21:50,150
it sounds like the other one,

4885
02:21:50,420 --> 02:21:51,890
like in context what he's saying,

4886
02:21:51,891 --> 02:21:53,540
particularly the fact
that he's a white guy.

4887
02:21:53,780 --> 02:21:55,970
That doesn't sound like
a racial slur at all.

4888
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,480
I mean he's saying fuck
white people and he is white

4889
02:21:58,580 --> 02:21:59,271
and context.

4890
02:21:59,271 --> 02:21:59,600
Again,

4891
02:21:59,600 --> 02:22:00,650
these are tied together.

4892
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:05,920
I always knew that person was not to
be trusted that fucking Jewish slur.

4893
02:22:06,610 --> 02:22:07,360
Oh,

4894
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:08,193
so there's a lot,

4895
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:12,100
there's a bunch of very specific person
targeting trying to be very provocative

4896
02:22:12,101 --> 02:22:14,350
saying this without a
specific Jewish person.

4897
02:22:14,800 --> 02:22:16,720
I don't know the race of this person.

4898
02:22:16,721 --> 02:22:17,170
I'm sorry.

4899
02:22:17,170 --> 02:22:18,100
And this is not okay,

4900
02:22:18,130 --> 02:22:19,200
but this is not it.

4901
02:22:19,210 --> 02:22:20,140
This is not parody.

4902
02:22:20,141 --> 02:22:21,310
This is not joking around.

4903
02:22:21,720 --> 02:22:22,930
We didn't view it that way.

4904
02:22:22,931 --> 02:22:23,471
I'm just telling,

4905
02:22:23,471 --> 02:22:25,090
I'm not trying to like read,

4906
02:22:25,260 --> 02:22:25,890
litigate all this.

4907
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:26,010
I'm

4908
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:27,030
just telling you what they were.

4909
02:22:27,870 --> 02:22:30,720
I knew he had done things that were
like egregious violations of the rules

4910
02:22:30,721 --> 02:22:31,260
because,

4911
02:22:31,260 --> 02:22:31,710
you know,

4912
02:22:31,710 --> 02:22:32,161
plain simple,

4913
02:22:32,161 --> 02:22:34,800
I didn't bring him up to go through
and try and figure out a feat,

4914
02:22:34,860 --> 02:22:36,000
but that it does sound like,

4915
02:22:36,001 --> 02:22:38,370
at least the first one was
meant to be a critique of.

4916
02:22:39,180 --> 02:22:41,040
So there are a bunch of others.

4917
02:22:41,041 --> 02:22:42,980
If you want to hear him more than that,

4918
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:43,860
keep it rolling.

4919
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:44,160
Again,

4920
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:44,760
targeted,

4921
02:22:44,760 --> 02:22:47,370
this is how I know one day that I'll
be throwing you from a helicopter.

4922
02:22:47,371 --> 02:22:48,960
You're the same kind of malignant cancer.

4923
02:22:48,961 --> 02:22:49,794
Don't forget it.

4924
02:22:50,090 --> 02:22:50,460
Um,

4925
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:51,030
so there's just,

4926
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:53,700
it's not one thing or two
things or three things.

4927
02:22:53,701 --> 02:22:54,930
This just like a bunch of them.

4928
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:57,840
Even though you throw
someone from a Heloc,

4929
02:22:57,841 --> 02:23:00,150
well he doesn't really like
you in that helicopter,

4930
02:23:00,170 --> 02:23:01,340
but admittedly,

4931
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:02,400
and I,

4932
02:23:02,400 --> 02:23:02,730
so,

4933
02:23:02,730 --> 02:23:03,080
so he,

4934
02:23:03,080 --> 02:23:03,261
he,

4935
02:23:03,261 --> 02:23:03,521
he,

4936
02:23:03,521 --> 02:23:06,290
he's on youtube by the name of Sargon
of Akkad is a big account and I've,

4937
02:23:06,291 --> 02:23:09,150
I've criticized him for being overly
mean in the past and I think it's

4938
02:23:09,151 --> 02:23:10,310
exemplified by angry,

4939
02:23:10,560 --> 02:23:10,980
but,

4940
02:23:10,980 --> 02:23:11,291
but he,

4941
02:23:11,291 --> 02:23:12,570
he has a very different now.

4942
02:23:12,570 --> 02:23:15,090
And I guess the reason I brought him
up was not very different though.

4943
02:23:15,091 --> 02:23:15,720
How so?

4944
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:16,050
Well,

4945
02:23:16,050 --> 02:23:16,651
a lot of the content,

4946
02:23:16,651 --> 02:23:17,700
he makes as much calmer.

4947
02:23:17,820 --> 02:23:18,121
He's,

4948
02:23:18,121 --> 02:23:19,830
he's less likely to
insult someone directly.

4949
02:23:19,860 --> 02:23:22,500
He makes probably recognizing
that he's on his last straw.

4950
02:23:22,590 --> 02:23:22,711
Oh,

4951
02:23:22,711 --> 02:23:23,130
definitely.

4952
02:23:23,130 --> 02:23:24,390
Especially ticked off of Twitter.

4953
02:23:24,391 --> 02:23:25,171
He's on Youtube.

4954
02:23:25,171 --> 02:23:26,730
He's probably got a mind his p's and q's.

4955
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:27,630
Oh,

4956
02:23:27,630 --> 02:23:28,351
but so,

4957
02:23:28,351 --> 02:23:29,184
um,

4958
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:30,990
the reason I brought him up again,

4959
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:35,340
but we'll move on was that activists
found a live stream from eight months ago.

4960
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:38,700
I totally forgot why I was bringing it
up because we've moved so far away from

4961
02:23:38,701 --> 02:23:39,300
where we were.

4962
02:23:39,300 --> 02:23:40,133
But um,

4963
02:23:40,290 --> 02:23:40,590
they,

4964
02:23:40,590 --> 02:23:44,770
they pull this clip from an hour and a
half or whatever into a two hour live

4965
02:23:44,771 --> 02:23:45,810
stream on a small channel.

4966
02:23:45,811 --> 02:23:49,650
They only have 2000 views sent to
Patrion and then Patriot and said,

4967
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:49,830
yep,

4968
02:23:49,830 --> 02:23:51,170
that's a violation and banned him out.

4969
02:23:51,170 --> 02:23:51,361
Right.

4970
02:23:51,361 --> 02:23:52,194
Without warning.

4971
02:23:52,530 --> 02:23:53,071
Which again,

4972
02:23:53,071 --> 02:23:54,330
I understand it's different
from what you guys do.

4973
02:23:54,331 --> 02:23:55,320
You do suspensions first.

4974
02:23:55,620 --> 02:23:55,861
But,

4975
02:23:55,861 --> 02:23:56,011
uh,

4976
02:23:56,011 --> 02:23:59,310
I guess the reason I was bringing
up was to talk about a few things.

4977
02:23:59,710 --> 02:24:00,030
Um,

4978
02:24:00,030 --> 02:24:01,350
why blocking isn't enough.

4979
02:24:01,500 --> 02:24:02,730
Why muting isn't enough.

4980
02:24:02,970 --> 02:24:05,550
And if you think that it's
driving people off the platform,

4981
02:24:06,060 --> 02:24:07,920
people post my tweets on Reddit,

4982
02:24:08,190 --> 02:24:08,970
I blocked them,

4983
02:24:08,970 --> 02:24:09,960
they use a dummy account,

4984
02:24:09,961 --> 02:24:10,620
load up my tweet,

4985
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:12,600
post it to reddit and
then spam me on reddit.

4986
02:24:12,630 --> 02:24:13,770
So you know,

4987
02:24:13,771 --> 02:24:17,130
blocking and even leaving Twitter would
never do anything short of me shutting

4988
02:24:17,131 --> 02:24:17,640
up.

4989
02:24:17,640 --> 02:24:19,890
There's nothing you can do
to protect me or anyone else.

4990
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:20,550
Look,

4991
02:24:20,550 --> 02:24:23,460
I mean these are exactly the
conversations we're having are one,

4992
02:24:23,820 --> 02:24:28,110
the reason why I don't think
blocking and muting or enough is one,

4993
02:24:28,140 --> 02:24:30,030
I don't think we've made
mute powerful enough.

4994
02:24:31,050 --> 02:24:32,790
It's spread all over the service.

4995
02:24:33,390 --> 02:24:33,750
Uh,

4996
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:34,583
you,

4997
02:24:34,980 --> 02:24:37,640
you can use it and then you got to
go find where you actually meet.

4998
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:39,990
These people are in their little
profile page and that's just,

4999
02:24:40,020 --> 02:24:40,560
uh,

5000
02:24:40,560 --> 02:24:41,370
it's not a,

5001
02:24:41,370 --> 02:24:42,330
it's a disaster.

5002
02:24:42,480 --> 02:24:45,540
It just doesn't work in the
same way that it should work.

5003
02:24:45,541 --> 02:24:47,190
In the same way that follow works,

5004
02:24:47,250 --> 02:24:48,480
which is just the inverse event,

5005
02:24:48,690 --> 02:24:50,550
I noticed that now I get
a notification that says,

5006
02:24:50,551 --> 02:24:53,220
you can't see this tweet because
you made it this person before.

5007
02:24:53,221 --> 02:24:54,990
I would just see a
weird reply and be like,

5008
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:55,591
oh,

5009
02:24:55,591 --> 02:24:56,041
it's one of those.

5010
02:24:56,041 --> 02:24:56,620
Exactly.

5011
02:24:56,620 --> 02:24:56,950
So

5012
02:24:56,950 --> 02:25:01,390
there's also all this infrastructure
that we have to fix in order to like pass

5013
02:25:01,391 --> 02:25:05,470
those through in terms of what action
you took or what action someone else

5014
02:25:05,471 --> 02:25:08,140
talked to be transparent about
what's happening on the network.

5015
02:25:08,540 --> 02:25:09,373
The second,

5016
02:25:09,940 --> 02:25:10,630
um,

5017
02:25:10,630 --> 02:25:14,020
the second thing that block
is really interesting.

5018
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:15,371
I think it's,

5019
02:25:15,371 --> 02:25:16,204
uh,

5020
02:25:16,420 --> 02:25:21,420
my own view is it's wholly an unsatisfying
because what you're doing is your

5021
02:25:23,230 --> 02:25:23,951
blocking someone.

5022
02:25:23,951 --> 02:25:24,040
They

5023
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,900
get notification that you've blocked them,

5024
02:25:26,520 --> 02:25:26,770
uh,

5025
02:25:26,770 --> 02:25:28,930
which may embolden them even more,

5026
02:25:28,931 --> 02:25:29,860
which causes,

5027
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:30,813
you know,

5028
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:32,780
others around and ramifications from,

5029
02:25:32,810 --> 02:25:33,670
from the network.

5030
02:25:34,120 --> 02:25:39,040
But also that person can log out of
Twitter and then look at your tweets.

5031
02:25:39,130 --> 02:25:39,820
Uh,

5032
02:25:39,820 --> 02:25:40,690
just on the public web,

5033
02:25:40,691 --> 02:25:41,340
because we're,

5034
02:25:41,340 --> 02:25:46,270
we're public so it doesn't feel as as
rigorous and as durable as something like

5035
02:25:46,570 --> 02:25:47,860
making mute much stronger.

5036
02:25:48,120 --> 02:25:51,000
I guess the challenge is no
matter what rule you put in place,

5037
02:25:51,001 --> 02:25:52,860
people are going to
harass you if you're a,

5038
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:54,630
if you're engaging in public discourse,

5039
02:25:54,660 --> 02:25:54,811
you know,

5040
02:25:54,811 --> 02:25:57,390
if I go out in the street
and yell out my opinion,

5041
02:25:57,391 --> 02:26:00,370
somebody could get in my face if
I get off Twitter cause I'm sick.

5042
02:26:00,570 --> 02:26:01,380
I mean look,

5043
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:02,080
you know,

5044
02:26:02,080 --> 02:26:03,720
I'm sure you get it way worse than I do,

5045
02:26:03,810 --> 02:26:04,740
especially as you know,

5046
02:26:04,800 --> 02:26:07,110
the high profile probably
getting it right now.

5047
02:26:07,170 --> 02:26:07,411
Yeah,

5048
02:26:07,411 --> 02:26:07,771
totally.

5049
02:26:07,771 --> 02:26:07,921
Oh,

5050
02:26:07,921 --> 02:26:08,330
me too.

5051
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:08,850
God,

5052
02:26:08,850 --> 02:26:09,683
I can only imagine,

5053
02:26:10,490 --> 02:26:10,840
but so,

5054
02:26:10,840 --> 02:26:11,880
so the only thing I can do is,

5055
02:26:11,881 --> 02:26:12,091
look,

5056
02:26:12,091 --> 02:26:13,050
we're not on Twitter right now.

5057
02:26:13,080 --> 02:26:16,380
We're on Joe Rogan's podcast and they're
still going to target you on Twitter.

5058
02:26:16,381 --> 02:26:16,901
They're still going to,

5059
02:26:16,901 --> 02:26:17,100
it's,

5060
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:18,690
I guarantee we're all of a reddit.

5061
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:20,730
The leftist probably railing on me,

5062
02:26:20,731 --> 02:26:22,020
the rights wailing on you guys.

5063
02:26:22,260 --> 02:26:22,741
So it's,

5064
02:26:22,741 --> 02:26:22,981
it's,

5065
02:26:22,981 --> 02:26:26,040
it seems like even if you try everything
in your power to make Twitter healthier

5066
02:26:26,041 --> 02:26:26,820
and better,

5067
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:27,960
it's not going to change anything

5068
02:26:29,290 --> 02:26:32,680
that I'm not sure about that because one
of the things that I do think is that

5069
02:26:32,681 --> 02:26:33,514
just,

5070
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:38,940
I'm not in favor of a lot of this heavy
handed banning and a lot of the things

5071
02:26:39,101 --> 02:26:39,970
that have been going on,

5072
02:26:40,390 --> 02:26:42,730
particularly like a case
like the Megan Murphy case.

5073
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:46,090
But what I think that
we are doing is we're,

5074
02:26:46,840 --> 02:26:51,840
we're exploring the idea of civil
discourse where we're trying to figure out

5075
02:26:52,421 --> 02:26:56,620
what's acceptable and what's
not acceptable and you're
communicating about this

5076
02:26:56,621 --> 02:27:00,790
on a very large scale and it's putting
that out there and then people are

5077
02:27:00,791 --> 02:27:05,330
discussing it whether they agree or
disagree with a vehemently defend you or,

5078
02:27:05,620 --> 02:27:06,520
or hate you.

5079
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:09,370
They're discussing this and this is,

5080
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:13,300
I think this is how these things change
and they change over long periods of

5081
02:27:13,301 --> 02:27:13,780
time.

5082
02:27:13,780 --> 02:27:18,780
Think about words that were commonplace
just a few years ago that you literally

5083
02:27:19,331 --> 02:27:20,440
can't say anymore.

5084
02:27:21,010 --> 02:27:21,221
Right.

5085
02:27:21,221 --> 02:27:21,400
You know,

5086
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:21,581
I mean,

5087
02:27:21,581 --> 02:27:26,260
there's so many of them that
were extremely commonplace
or not even thought to

5088
02:27:26,261 --> 02:27:30,240
be offensive 10 years ago that
now you can get banned off.

5089
02:27:30,570 --> 02:27:30,661
Well,

5090
02:27:30,661 --> 02:27:31,200
so it was for,

5091
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:31,501
but that's,

5092
02:27:31,501 --> 02:27:35,940
that's a good point to argue against
banning people and to cease enforcing hate

5093
02:27:35,941 --> 02:27:36,720
speech rules.

5094
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:36,960
Yeah,

5095
02:27:36,960 --> 02:27:38,160
I agree with that as well.

5096
02:27:38,190 --> 02:27:39,570
I think it's both things.

5097
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:39,811
Let me,

5098
02:27:39,811 --> 02:27:40,021
let me,

5099
02:27:40,021 --> 02:27:40,231
let me,

5100
02:27:40,231 --> 02:27:41,130
let me tell you something important.

5101
02:27:41,160 --> 02:27:42,810
I was in the UK at an event,

5102
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:43,440
um,

5103
02:27:43,440 --> 02:27:45,090
for a man named [inaudible] who,

5104
02:27:45,091 --> 02:27:46,020
I don't know if you've heard of oh,

5105
02:27:46,021 --> 02:27:46,470
sure.

5106
02:27:46,470 --> 02:27:46,770
Yeah,

5107
02:27:46,770 --> 02:27:46,951
yeah.

5108
02:27:46,951 --> 02:27:50,340
Dan is the guy who got charged
and convicted of making
a joke where he had his,

5109
02:27:50,430 --> 02:27:51,840
his pug do a Nazi salute.

5110
02:27:52,470 --> 02:27:56,820
But I was there and I was arguing that
a certain white nationalists had used

5111
02:27:56,821 --> 02:27:58,320
racial slurs on youtube.

5112
02:27:58,770 --> 02:27:59,341
He has,

5113
02:27:59,341 --> 02:28:00,174
I don't want to name him,

5114
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,010
and some guy in the UK said,

5115
02:28:02,040 --> 02:28:02,791
that's not true.

5116
02:28:02,791 --> 02:28:03,660
He's never done that.

5117
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:04,793
And I said,

5118
02:28:04,830 --> 02:28:05,431
you're crazy.

5119
02:28:05,431 --> 02:28:06,240
Let me pull it up.

5120
02:28:06,240 --> 02:28:07,073
Unfortunately,

5121
02:28:07,560 --> 02:28:08,520
I don't know why,

5122
02:28:08,670 --> 02:28:09,690
but when I did the Google search,

5123
02:28:09,750 --> 02:28:10,583
nothing came up.

5124
02:28:11,070 --> 02:28:12,600
What I did notice at
the bottom of the page,

5125
02:28:12,601 --> 02:28:12,961
it said,

5126
02:28:12,961 --> 02:28:13,590
due to,

5127
02:28:13,590 --> 02:28:13,801
you know,

5128
02:28:13,801 --> 02:28:14,390
UK law,

5129
02:28:14,390 --> 02:28:15,750
certain things have been removed.

5130
02:28:16,170 --> 02:28:21,030
So I don't know if it's exactly why I
couldn't pull up a video proving or tweets

5131
02:28:21,110 --> 02:28:21,471
anything.

5132
02:28:21,471 --> 02:28:24,950
Because I think using these words gets
rescript from the social platforms.

5133
02:28:25,130 --> 02:28:28,850
I could not prove to this man the first
century in that in the UK that this man

5134
02:28:28,940 --> 02:28:30,800
is a VPN and then get around that.

5135
02:28:31,250 --> 02:28:32,083
Uh,

5136
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:33,080
yeah.

5137
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:35,300
I mean at the time I was just like
trying to pull it up and I'm like,

5138
02:28:35,301 --> 02:28:35,391
oh,

5139
02:28:35,391 --> 02:28:36,110
that's weird.

5140
02:28:36,110 --> 02:28:41,110
So now you have someone who doesn't
realize he's a fan of a bigot because the

5141
02:28:41,211 --> 02:28:42,620
law has restricted the speech.

5142
02:28:43,070 --> 02:28:44,930
So there's a point to be made if you,

5143
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:45,711
I understand,

5144
02:28:45,711 --> 02:28:46,370
you want a healthy,

5145
02:28:46,370 --> 02:28:46,731
like you,

5146
02:28:46,731 --> 02:28:47,750
you want Twitter to grow,

5147
02:28:47,751 --> 02:28:48,650
you need it to grow.

5148
02:28:48,710 --> 02:28:49,940
The shareholders needed to grow,

5149
02:28:49,941 --> 02:28:51,590
the advertisers need to advertise.

5150
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:52,730
So you've got all these restrictions.

5151
02:28:53,270 --> 02:28:55,550
But allowing people to
say these awful things,

5152
02:28:55,700 --> 02:28:59,780
make sure we stay away from them and
it allows us to avoid certain people.

5153
02:28:59,781 --> 02:29:02,540
And it isn't an important to know
that these people hold these beliefs.

5154
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:03,583
If you get rid of him,

5155
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:04,071
you know,

5156
02:29:04,071 --> 02:29:06,510
someone could walk into a business and
you wouldn't even know that they were a

5157
02:29:06,511 --> 02:29:07,344
neo Nazi,

5158
02:29:07,580 --> 02:29:10,080
but if they were high profile saying
there things you'd be like that's the guy

5159
02:29:10,081 --> 02:29:10,281
at home.

5160
02:29:10,281 --> 02:29:11,300
Like you're absolutely right.

5161
02:29:11,301 --> 02:29:13,970
This is like one of my favorite
sayings is that sunlight is the best

5162
02:29:13,971 --> 02:29:16,160
disinfectant and it's so,

5163
02:29:16,161 --> 02:29:16,461
so,

5164
02:29:16,461 --> 02:29:17,180
so true.

5165
02:29:17,180 --> 02:29:21,670
I like one of the biggest problems with
censorship is the fact that you pushed

5166
02:29:21,671 --> 02:29:24,380
people underground and you
don't know what's going on.

5167
02:29:24,740 --> 02:29:26,090
And this is something I worry about.

5168
02:29:26,300 --> 02:29:29,450
It's not that I don't worry if
you ban people for these roles,

5169
02:29:29,451 --> 02:29:33,530
I also worry about driving people away
from the platform and affecting their

5170
02:29:33,531 --> 02:29:34,251
real lives.

5171
02:29:34,251 --> 02:29:38,480
So what we're trying to find this right
balance and I hear you like you may not

5172
02:29:38,481 --> 02:29:41,420
think we're drawing the lines in the
right place and we get that feedback all

5173
02:29:41,421 --> 02:29:43,680
the time and we're always
trying to find the right places.

5174
02:29:44,200 --> 02:29:49,100
But I worry as much about like the
underground and like being able to shine a

5175
02:29:49,101 --> 02:29:50,900
light on these things is as anything else.

5176
02:29:51,370 --> 02:29:56,030
I think it's a cost benefit analysis and
we have to constantly rehash it and do

5177
02:29:56,060 --> 02:29:56,893
it.

5178
02:29:56,920 --> 02:29:57,753
Like we,

5179
02:29:57,870 --> 02:30:02,840
we have the technology we have today
and we are looking at technologies which

5180
02:30:02,841 --> 02:30:07,841
opened up the aperture even more and we
all agree that a binary on or off is not

5181
02:30:11,691 --> 02:30:13,640
the right answer and it is not scalable.

5182
02:30:14,120 --> 02:30:19,100
We have started getting into nuance
within our enforcement and we've also

5183
02:30:19,101 --> 02:30:22,330
started getting into nuance
with the presentation of,

5184
02:30:22,360 --> 02:30:23,151
of content.

5185
02:30:23,151 --> 02:30:24,440
So you know,

5186
02:30:25,430 --> 02:30:30,430
one path might have been for some of
your replies for us to just remove that,

5187
02:30:31,100 --> 02:30:31,821
those,

5188
02:30:31,821 --> 02:30:32,150
you know,

5189
02:30:32,150 --> 02:30:33,500
offensive replies completely.

5190
02:30:33,501 --> 02:30:34,281
We don't do that.

5191
02:30:34,281 --> 02:30:39,120
We hide it behind an interstitial to
protect the original tweeter and it,

5192
02:30:39,140 --> 02:30:39,521
and,

5193
02:30:39,521 --> 02:30:43,310
and also folks who don't want to see
that they can still see everything.

5194
02:30:43,311 --> 02:30:44,630
They just have to do one more top.

5195
02:30:44,631 --> 02:30:46,100
So that's one solution.

5196
02:30:46,101 --> 02:30:47,240
Ranking is another solution,

5197
02:30:47,241 --> 02:30:50,360
but as technology gets better and
we get better at applying to it,

5198
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:52,100
we have a lot more optionality.

5199
02:30:52,101 --> 02:30:53,270
Whereas we don't,

5200
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:54,920
we don't have that as much today.

5201
02:30:55,290 --> 02:30:58,400
I feel like I'm just gonna
reiterate an earlier point though.

5202
02:30:58,700 --> 02:30:59,210
You know,

5203
02:30:59,210 --> 02:31:01,190
if you recognize sunlight
is the best disinfectant,

5204
02:31:01,460 --> 02:31:01,790
you're,

5205
02:31:01,790 --> 02:31:02,301
it's like you're,

5206
02:31:02,301 --> 02:31:05,360
you're chasing after a goal that
can never be met if you want to.

5207
02:31:05,361 --> 02:31:07,940
If you want to protect all speech and
they start banning certain individual,

5208
02:31:08,030 --> 02:31:08,391
you want to,

5209
02:31:08,391 --> 02:31:10,100
you want to increase the amount
of healthy conversations,

5210
02:31:10,340 --> 02:31:11,600
but you're banning some people.

5211
02:31:11,870 --> 02:31:12,141
Well,

5212
02:31:12,141 --> 02:31:14,270
how long until this group
is now funded by that group?

5213
02:31:14,271 --> 02:31:15,560
How long until you've banned everybody?

5214
02:31:15,561 --> 02:31:16,130
I hear you.

5215
02:31:16,130 --> 02:31:18,380
I don't believe a permanent
ban promotes health.

5216
02:31:19,160 --> 02:31:19,980
Don't,

5217
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,701
I don't believe that.

5218
02:31:20,701 --> 02:31:20,931
But we,

5219
02:31:20,931 --> 02:31:21,631
we have to,

5220
02:31:21,631 --> 02:31:24,170
we have to work with the technologies,

5221
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:25,560
tools and conditions that we,

5222
02:31:25,830 --> 02:31:26,880
that we have today.

5223
02:31:27,030 --> 02:31:27,301
So,

5224
02:31:27,301 --> 02:31:32,301
and evolve over over time to
where we can see examples.

5225
02:31:32,630 --> 02:31:33,120
Um,

5226
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:33,720
like,

5227
02:31:33,720 --> 02:31:34,050
uh,

5228
02:31:34,050 --> 02:31:38,490
this woman at the Westboro Baptist Church
who was using Twitter every single day

5229
02:31:38,910 --> 02:31:42,150
to spread hate against
the Lgbtqa community.

5230
02:31:42,570 --> 02:31:44,880
And over time we had,

5231
02:31:44,910 --> 02:31:49,650
I think it was three or four folks on
Twitter who would engage her every single

5232
02:31:49,650 --> 02:31:50,640
day about what she was doing.

5233
02:31:50,641 --> 02:31:52,410
And she actually left the church.

5234
02:31:54,060 --> 02:31:54,960
She's amazing.

5235
02:31:55,130 --> 02:31:56,130
And she is,

5236
02:31:56,131 --> 02:31:58,080
she's not pulling her
family out of that as well.

5237
02:31:58,081 --> 02:32:02,370
And you could make the argument that
if we banned that account early on,

5238
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:04,260
she would have never left the church.

5239
02:32:04,290 --> 02:32:05,250
I completely hear that.

5240
02:32:05,251 --> 02:32:05,520
We,

5241
02:32:05,520 --> 02:32:06,320
we get it.

5242
02:32:06,320 --> 02:32:06,661
It's,

5243
02:32:06,661 --> 02:32:07,494
it's just,

5244
02:32:07,820 --> 02:32:07,941
well,

5245
02:32:07,941 --> 02:32:08,260
so let's,

5246
02:32:08,260 --> 02:32:08,710
let's,

5247
02:32:08,710 --> 02:32:09,860
I just want to make sure we had,

5248
02:32:09,861 --> 02:32:11,840
we're advancing the conversation
too and not just going to go back.

5249
02:32:11,841 --> 02:32:12,270
So,

5250
02:32:12,270 --> 02:32:12,710
uh,

5251
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:13,431
I'll just ask you this.

5252
02:32:13,431 --> 02:32:16,550
Have you considered allowing some of
these people permanently banned back on

5253
02:32:16,551 --> 02:32:17,361
with some restrictions?

5254
02:32:17,361 --> 02:32:19,370
Maybe you can only tweet twice per day,

5255
02:32:19,371 --> 02:32:21,350
maybe you can't retweet or
something to that effect.

5256
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:23,440
I think we're very early
in our thinking here,

5257
02:32:23,470 --> 02:32:23,861
so we're,

5258
02:32:23,861 --> 02:32:25,570
we're open minded to how to do this.

5259
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:29,410
I think we agree philosophically that
permanent bands aren't extreme case

5260
02:32:29,411 --> 02:32:31,720
scenario and it shouldn't be one of our,

5261
02:32:32,330 --> 02:32:32,680
you know,

5262
02:32:32,680 --> 02:32:34,630
regular use tools in our tool chest.

5263
02:32:34,990 --> 02:32:38,710
So how we do that I think is something
that we're actively talking about today.

5264
02:32:39,010 --> 02:32:40,960
Is there a timeline that we can,

5265
02:32:40,990 --> 02:32:41,201
so,

5266
02:32:41,201 --> 02:32:41,961
so look in all,

5267
02:32:41,961 --> 02:32:43,780
I think dad would fix a lot of problems.

5268
02:32:43,781 --> 02:32:44,410
You think so?

5269
02:32:44,410 --> 02:32:44,801
Yes.

5270
02:32:44,801 --> 02:32:45,634
I really do.

5271
02:32:45,700 --> 02:32:46,060
Like,

5272
02:32:46,060 --> 02:32:49,450
I'm just curious like are you thinking
like bands of a year or five years,

5273
02:32:49,451 --> 02:32:49,990
10 years?

5274
02:32:49,990 --> 02:32:51,370
I'm just curious like what is,

5275
02:32:51,400 --> 02:32:54,370
what is a reasonable ban
in this kind of context?

5276
02:32:54,760 --> 02:32:57,970
I think reasonably so much enough to
state their case as to why they want to be

5277
02:32:57,971 --> 02:32:58,690
unbanned.

5278
02:32:58,690 --> 02:33:00,310
Like someone should have to have a,

5279
02:33:00,390 --> 02:33:00,700
uh,

5280
02:33:00,700 --> 02:33:02,320
like a well measured,

5281
02:33:02,321 --> 02:33:05,410
considerate response
to what they did wrong.

5282
02:33:05,411 --> 02:33:05,650
Did,

5283
02:33:05,650 --> 02:33:07,150
do they agree with what they did wrong?

5284
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:12,010
Maybe perhaps saying why they don't think
they did anything wrong and you could

5285
02:33:12,011 --> 02:33:12,880
review it from there.

5286
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:13,220
Hmm.

5287
02:33:13,220 --> 02:33:14,053
I think,

5288
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:14,390
um,

5289
02:33:14,390 --> 02:33:14,631
you know,

5290
02:33:14,631 --> 02:33:15,380
one of the challenges,

5291
02:33:15,380 --> 02:33:18,680
we have the benefit in English common
law of hundreds of years of precedent and

5292
02:33:18,681 --> 02:33:20,990
developing new rules and figuring
out what works and doesn't,

5293
02:33:20,991 --> 02:33:21,890
Twitter is very different.

5294
02:33:22,430 --> 02:33:24,050
So I think with the technology,

5295
02:33:24,051 --> 02:33:25,670
I don't know if you need
permanent bands or even,

5296
02:33:25,700 --> 02:33:26,990
or even suspensions at all,

5297
02:33:27,020 --> 02:33:28,130
you could literally just,

5298
02:33:28,450 --> 02:33:28,820
uh,

5299
02:33:28,820 --> 02:33:29,600
I mean,

5300
02:33:29,600 --> 02:33:31,850
lock someone's account is
essentially suspending them.

5301
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:32,570
But,

5302
02:33:32,570 --> 02:33:33,220
uh,

5303
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:33,410
I,

5304
02:33:33,410 --> 02:33:33,861
I again,

5305
02:33:33,861 --> 02:33:37,010
I wouldn't claim to know anything
about the things you go through,

5306
02:33:37,011 --> 02:33:40,340
but what if you just restricted
most of what they could say?

5307
02:33:40,370 --> 02:33:40,641
You know,

5308
02:33:40,641 --> 02:33:42,110
you block certain words
in a certain dictionary.

5309
02:33:42,111 --> 02:33:42,944
If someone's been,

5310
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:44,960
if someone was greased hill open,

5311
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:45,080
no,

5312
02:33:45,080 --> 02:33:45,231
but,

5313
02:33:45,231 --> 02:33:45,410
but,

5314
02:33:45,410 --> 02:33:46,310
but the thing about it this way,

5315
02:33:46,311 --> 02:33:49,370
is it better that they're permanently
banned or it sounds better but it's not,

5316
02:33:49,700 --> 02:33:50,533
it's not good.

5317
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:51,740
I don't know to think about it this way.

5318
02:33:51,830 --> 02:33:54,080
Instead of being suspended for 72 hours,

5319
02:33:54,170 --> 02:33:56,510
you get a dictionary block
from hate speech words.

5320
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:57,793
Right.

5321
02:33:57,860 --> 02:33:58,693
Does that not make sense?

5322
02:33:58,800 --> 02:33:59,080
People

5323
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:00,150
just use kind of language.

5324
02:34:00,180 --> 02:34:01,110
This is what we see all the time.

5325
02:34:01,111 --> 02:34:01,501
Yeah,

5326
02:34:01,501 --> 02:34:01,770
I don't,

5327
02:34:01,770 --> 02:34:02,603
well they could move.

5328
02:34:02,610 --> 02:34:02,881
What do you,

5329
02:34:02,881 --> 02:34:07,881
what do you think about perhaps instead
of w w w w is it possible to have levels

5330
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:10,433
of Twitter,

5331
02:34:10,590 --> 02:34:15,590
like a completely uncensored unmoderated
level of Twitter and then you know,

5332
02:34:15,661 --> 02:34:17,980
have like a rated r and then have like a

5333
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:19,180
PG 13 yeah,

5334
02:34:19,210 --> 02:34:20,800
I mean I don't think that's a bad idea.

5335
02:34:20,910 --> 02:34:21,520
We,

5336
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:23,860
we have those levels in place today,

5337
02:34:23,861 --> 02:34:25,000
but you don't really see them.

5338
02:34:25,060 --> 02:34:25,450
One,

5339
02:34:25,450 --> 02:34:27,860
we have a not safe for work switch,

5340
02:34:28,240 --> 02:34:29,470
which you can turn on or off.

5341
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:30,530
Oh really?

5342
02:34:30,530 --> 02:34:33,220
And let's say for work switch off.

5343
02:34:33,221 --> 02:34:33,680
Joe,

5344
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:34,820
do you think so

5345
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:37,410
based on what you're seeing,

5346
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:40,330
you know it's there.

5347
02:34:40,760 --> 02:34:43,120
So we have that and then as
victor pointed out earlier,

5348
02:34:43,210 --> 02:34:43,481
you know,

5349
02:34:43,481 --> 02:34:44,201
we have the timeline.

5350
02:34:44,201 --> 02:34:44,530
We'd,

5351
02:34:44,530 --> 02:34:46,270
we started ranking the timeline,

5352
02:34:46,540 --> 02:34:46,871
uh,

5353
02:34:46,871 --> 02:34:48,070
about three years ago.

5354
02:34:48,190 --> 02:34:51,910
We enabled people today to turn
that off completely and see,

5355
02:34:51,940 --> 02:34:52,350
you know,

5356
02:34:52,350 --> 02:34:54,250
the reverse cron of
everything they follow.

5357
02:34:54,251 --> 02:34:55,084
You can,

5358
02:34:55,390 --> 02:35:00,340
you can imagine a world where that switch
has a lot more power over more of our

5359
02:35:00,341 --> 02:35:02,410
algorithms throughout
more of the surface areas.

5360
02:35:02,530 --> 02:35:03,281
You can imagine that.

5361
02:35:03,281 --> 02:35:05,620
So these are all the questions
that are on the table.

5362
02:35:05,620 --> 02:35:05,901
Yes.

5363
02:35:05,901 --> 02:35:06,641
About timeline.

5364
02:35:06,641 --> 02:35:07,810
And this is,

5365
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:08,920
this is a challenging one.

5366
02:35:08,921 --> 02:35:13,300
I don't know about
timeline because first we,

5367
02:35:13,510 --> 02:35:18,460
we've decided that our priority right
now is going to be on proactively

5368
02:35:18,770 --> 02:35:22,840
enforcing a lot of this content
specifically around anything that impacts

5369
02:35:22,841 --> 02:35:23,531
physical safety,

5370
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:24,040
like,

5371
02:35:24,040 --> 02:35:24,670
like doxing.

5372
02:35:24,670 --> 02:35:26,070
So bright.

5373
02:35:26,170 --> 02:35:29,180
But there's so many examples of
what you guys not doing that I,

5374
02:35:29,410 --> 02:35:30,010
I know,

5375
02:35:30,010 --> 02:35:30,391
but that,

5376
02:35:30,391 --> 02:35:31,224
that's what we,

5377
02:35:31,360 --> 02:35:32,890
that's what we're fixing right now.

5378
02:35:33,100 --> 02:35:34,170
That's a privatization.

5379
02:35:36,170 --> 02:35:39,130
We think more in terms of milestones
and the particular timeline.

5380
02:35:39,131 --> 02:35:41,080
We're going to move as fast as we can,

5381
02:35:41,081 --> 02:35:42,640
but some of it's a function of our,

5382
02:35:43,060 --> 02:35:43,841
of our infrastructure,

5383
02:35:43,841 --> 02:35:44,770
of the technology we have to,

5384
02:35:44,800 --> 02:35:45,760
we have to bring to bear.

5385
02:35:46,210 --> 02:35:51,100
Do you guys have conversations about
trying to shift the public perception of

5386
02:35:51,101 --> 02:35:52,450
having this left wing bias?

5387
02:35:52,490 --> 02:35:53,740
Maybe possibly addressing it?

5388
02:35:54,100 --> 02:35:54,520
Yeah.

5389
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:54,820
All right,

5390
02:35:54,820 --> 02:35:55,840
well that's what they're doing right now,

5391
02:35:55,841 --> 02:35:56,170
right?

5392
02:35:56,170 --> 02:35:56,441
Yeah.

5393
02:35:56,441 --> 02:35:59,640
I mean I went on the Sean Hannity show.

5394
02:35:59,641 --> 02:35:59,890
I,

5395
02:35:59,890 --> 02:36:00,201
you know,

5396
02:36:00,201 --> 02:36:00,430
we,

5397
02:36:00,430 --> 02:36:00,970
we,

5398
02:36:00,970 --> 02:36:02,620
how was that we brought ourselves before.

5399
02:36:02,621 --> 02:36:03,760
It was pretty a lot of sunlight.

5400
02:36:03,790 --> 02:36:04,870
It was short and he,

5401
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:06,590
well it was short and um,

5402
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,360
there run a lot of really tough questions
and that was a feedback as well.

5403
02:36:10,361 --> 02:36:11,320
And I,

5404
02:36:11,490 --> 02:36:12,011
I get it.

5405
02:36:12,011 --> 02:36:12,310
Like,

5406
02:36:12,310 --> 02:36:13,330
look again,

5407
02:36:13,360 --> 02:36:13,870
I'm also,

5408
02:36:13,870 --> 02:36:14,740
I'm from Missouri.

5409
02:36:15,310 --> 02:36:16,450
My Dad is a Republican.

5410
02:36:16,451 --> 02:36:17,800
He listened to Hannity,

5411
02:36:17,801 --> 02:36:18,910
he listened to rush Limbaugh.

5412
02:36:18,911 --> 02:36:19,960
My mom was a democrat.

5413
02:36:20,530 --> 02:36:25,530
And I feel extremely fortunate that I
was able to first see that spectrum,

5414
02:36:25,811 --> 02:36:29,050
but also feel safe enough to
express my own point of view.

5415
02:36:29,440 --> 02:36:31,720
But when I go on some
of them like Hannity,

5416
02:36:31,721 --> 02:36:33,120
I'm not talking to entity,

5417
02:36:33,130 --> 02:36:35,170
I'm talking to people like
my dad who listened to him.

5418
02:36:35,590 --> 02:36:38,510
And I want to get across how we think and,

5419
02:36:38,790 --> 02:36:41,110
and also that our thinking evolves.

5420
02:36:41,110 --> 02:36:42,440
And here's the challenges we're seeing.

5421
02:36:42,441 --> 02:36:43,150
And like,

5422
02:36:43,150 --> 02:36:44,380
this is our intent.

5423
02:36:44,410 --> 02:36:45,820
This is what we're trying to protect.

5424
02:36:45,821 --> 02:36:46,770
And we're,

5425
02:36:46,780 --> 02:36:49,930
we're gonna make some mistakes along the
way and we're going to admit to them we

5426
02:36:50,470 --> 02:36:53,530
didn't admit to them in the past
week and middle to a lot more,

5427
02:36:53,590 --> 02:36:53,980
uh,

5428
02:36:53,980 --> 02:36:55,540
over over the past three years.

5429
02:36:55,570 --> 02:36:55,960
Um,

5430
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:56,793
but,

5431
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:57,800
you know,

5432
02:36:57,800 --> 02:36:58,060
I,

5433
02:36:58,060 --> 02:37:01,000
I don't know any other way to
address some of these issues.

5434
02:37:01,001 --> 02:37:01,420
It all,

5435
02:37:01,420 --> 02:37:02,530
it all goes back to trust.

5436
02:37:02,531 --> 02:37:03,340
Like our,

5437
02:37:03,340 --> 02:37:05,440
one of our core operating
principles is earning trust.

5438
02:37:05,441 --> 02:37:06,700
How do we earn more trust?

5439
02:37:06,701 --> 02:37:07,810
And I,

5440
02:37:07,811 --> 02:37:08,130
you know,

5441
02:37:08,130 --> 02:37:11,350
the people in the world
who do not trust us at all.

5442
02:37:11,410 --> 02:37:13,990
And there are some people who
trust us a little bit more,

5443
02:37:13,991 --> 02:37:16,160
but this is the thing
that want to measure this

5444
02:37:16,190 --> 02:37:17,480
the thing that we want to get better at.

5445
02:37:17,600 --> 02:37:20,500
I saw you get a conversation
with I think Katie Hertzog no,

5446
02:37:20,501 --> 02:37:20,580
no,

5447
02:37:20,580 --> 02:37:21,110
no.

5448
02:37:21,110 --> 02:37:23,300
Who was it that was the
wrong person you had,

5449
02:37:23,301 --> 02:37:25,050
you had a Twitter conversation with Kara.

5450
02:37:25,100 --> 02:37:25,760
Kara Swisher.

5451
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:26,240
Wow.

5452
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:26,841
Wrong person,

5453
02:37:26,841 --> 02:37:27,740
but someone got got shut up.

5454
02:37:27,940 --> 02:37:28,773
Uh,

5455
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,270
and,

5456
02:37:29,270 --> 02:37:30,070
and you know,

5457
02:37:30,070 --> 02:37:32,480
I I see that the left goes at
you in the opposite direction.

5458
02:37:32,481 --> 02:37:33,314
They want more,

5459
02:37:33,800 --> 02:37:34,590
they want more banning,

5460
02:37:34,590 --> 02:37:36,350
they want more restrictions.

5461
02:37:36,470 --> 02:37:37,001
And then looked at the,

5462
02:37:37,001 --> 02:37:38,240
the right is saying less.

5463
02:37:38,430 --> 02:37:39,140
Right.

5464
02:37:39,140 --> 02:37:41,600
So I mean in terms of solving the problem,

5465
02:37:41,900 --> 02:37:43,280
tell us what their conversation was about.

5466
02:37:43,700 --> 02:37:44,210
Uh,

5467
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:45,530
I do you want to summarize cause it,

5468
02:37:45,531 --> 02:37:45,890
cause my,

5469
02:37:45,890 --> 02:37:49,010
the thing I was pointing out specifically
was that you were being asked to do

5470
02:37:49,011 --> 02:37:51,110
more in terms of controlling,

5471
02:37:51,270 --> 02:37:52,071
it wasn't just more,

5472
02:37:52,071 --> 02:37:56,030
but to be a lot more specific about
what actions we've taken to promote more

5473
02:37:56,031 --> 02:37:56,900
health on the platform.

5474
02:37:56,900 --> 02:37:57,051
Like,

5475
02:37:57,051 --> 02:37:58,250
what products did we change?

5476
02:37:58,251 --> 02:38:02,150
What policies did we introduce
in the past two years?

5477
02:38:02,210 --> 02:38:03,043
Um,

5478
02:38:03,380 --> 02:38:03,860
uh,

5479
02:38:03,860 --> 02:38:05,510
so she was asking questions.

5480
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,100
Every question she asked.

5481
02:38:07,101 --> 02:38:12,101
She wanted me to be a lot more specific
and some of these things have something

5482
02:38:12,351 --> 02:38:13,490
that is a very specific,

5483
02:38:13,580 --> 02:38:16,080
some are directional
right now because like we,

5484
02:38:16,081 --> 02:38:17,750
we have to prioritize,

5485
02:38:18,250 --> 02:38:18,521
you know,

5486
02:38:18,521 --> 02:38:18,730
the,

5487
02:38:18,730 --> 02:38:19,770
the direction and,

5488
02:38:19,771 --> 02:38:20,870
and I talked about like,

5489
02:38:20,900 --> 02:38:21,111
you know,

5490
02:38:21,111 --> 02:38:24,380
we've decided that physical safety
is going to be a priority for us.

5491
02:38:24,381 --> 02:38:27,980
And to us that means like being a whole
lot more proactive around things like

5492
02:38:27,981 --> 02:38:28,610
toxin.

5493
02:38:28,610 --> 02:38:29,850
So two suggestions,

5494
02:38:29,900 --> 02:38:32,990
I guess I'm not going to imply
that you have unlimited funding,

5495
02:38:33,080 --> 02:38:34,640
but we did mention the peer review.

5496
02:38:34,650 --> 02:38:35,330
Dot.

5497
02:38:35,330 --> 02:38:35,631
Right?

5498
02:38:35,631 --> 02:38:35,990
Right.

5499
02:38:35,990 --> 02:38:37,040
And you had the,

5500
02:38:37,041 --> 02:38:38,570
you mentioned earlier with
layoffs and retraction,

5501
02:38:38,910 --> 02:38:39,743
uh,

5502
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:40,521
peer review,

5503
02:38:40,521 --> 02:38:41,354
which we mentioned,

5504
02:38:41,540 --> 02:38:43,280
but have you considered opening an office,

5505
02:38:43,281 --> 02:38:47,180
even a small one for trust and safety
in an area that's not predominantly blue

5506
02:38:47,181 --> 02:38:48,470
so that at least you have,

5507
02:38:48,830 --> 02:38:51,770
like you can have some pushback is what
is learned to code mean and then they

5508
02:38:51,771 --> 02:38:52,470
could tell you.

5509
02:38:52,470 --> 02:38:53,130
Absolutely.

5510
02:38:53,130 --> 02:38:53,520
So that,

5511
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:53,731
that's,

5512
02:38:53,731 --> 02:38:54,000
uh,

5513
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:54,781
that's great feedback.

5514
02:38:54,781 --> 02:38:55,614
And just so you know,

5515
02:38:55,620 --> 02:38:58,760
the trust and safety team is also global
team and the enforcement team isn't

5516
02:38:58,770 --> 02:38:59,603
global team.

5517
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:03,660
So it's not like people from California
who are looking at everything making

5518
02:39:03,661 --> 02:39:04,950
decisions there are global.

5519
02:39:05,250 --> 02:39:08,730
Now I hear your point about who trains
them in the materials they have and all

5520
02:39:08,731 --> 02:39:09,061
that.

5521
02:39:09,061 --> 02:39:10,260
And like we have to think about that.

5522
02:39:10,590 --> 02:39:11,370
And um,

5523
02:39:11,370 --> 02:39:11,730
that's,

5524
02:39:11,730 --> 02:39:14,280
that's one thing that Jack has really
been pushing us to think about is how do

5525
02:39:14,281 --> 02:39:15,630
we decentralize our workforce?

5526
02:39:15,631 --> 02:39:18,480
Because out of San
Francisco in particular,

5527
02:39:18,510 --> 02:39:20,160
so this is something he's very focused on.

5528
02:39:20,270 --> 02:39:24,500
What about publishing evidence
of wrongdoing in a banning?

5529
02:39:24,530 --> 02:39:25,430
So when people say,

5530
02:39:25,431 --> 02:39:25,641
you know,

5531
02:39:25,641 --> 02:39:26,840
what did Alex Jones really do?

5532
02:39:26,870 --> 02:39:28,340
Maybe a lot of people
didn't realize what you,

5533
02:39:28,400 --> 02:39:29,233
what you saw.

5534
02:39:29,240 --> 02:39:29,631
And again,

5535
02:39:29,631 --> 02:39:30,500
it's an issue of trust.

5536
02:39:30,530 --> 02:39:30,960
Yeah,

5537
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:31,880
I love this,

5538
02:39:31,881 --> 02:39:32,210
Tim.

5539
02:39:32,210 --> 02:39:32,751
I'm a lawyer.

5540
02:39:32,751 --> 02:39:33,710
So by training,

5541
02:39:33,960 --> 02:39:34,250
um,

5542
02:39:34,250 --> 02:39:35,720
we're thinking of doing something called,

5543
02:39:35,721 --> 02:39:36,620
we call case studies,

5544
02:39:36,621 --> 02:39:38,840
but essentially like this is our case law.

5545
02:39:38,841 --> 02:39:39,830
This is what we use.

5546
02:39:40,130 --> 02:39:42,530
And so on high profile cases,

5547
02:39:42,620 --> 02:39:42,951
cases,

5548
02:39:42,951 --> 02:39:46,580
people ask us about like to actually
publish this so that we can go through,

5549
02:39:46,910 --> 02:39:47,420
you know,

5550
02:39:47,420 --> 02:39:48,650
tweet by tweet just like this.

5551
02:39:48,651 --> 02:39:52,370
Because I think a lot of people just
don't understand and they don't believe us

5552
02:39:52,371 --> 02:39:53,181
when we're saying these things.

5553
02:39:53,181 --> 02:39:55,430
So to put that out there
so people can see it,

5554
02:39:55,431 --> 02:39:55,761
and again,

5555
02:39:55,761 --> 02:39:57,620
they may disagree with the
calls that we're making,

5556
02:39:57,621 --> 02:40:00,170
but we at least want them to see
why we're making these calls,

5557
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:01,180
I think.

5558
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:02,870
And that that I do want to do.

5559
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:04,880
I want to at least start
that by the end of this year.

5560
02:40:05,480 --> 02:40:05,751
So I,

5561
02:40:05,751 --> 02:40:06,460
I think,

5562
02:40:06,460 --> 02:40:06,770
you know,

5563
02:40:06,770 --> 02:40:10,220
ultimately my main criticism stands
and I don't see a solution to in that

5564
02:40:10,460 --> 02:40:11,900
Twitter is an unelected,

5565
02:40:12,080 --> 02:40:12,730
you know,

5566
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:14,490
unaccountable as far as I'm concerned.

5567
02:40:14,491 --> 02:40:15,780
When it comes to public discourse,

5568
02:40:16,140 --> 02:40:19,620
you have rules that are very
clearly at odds as we discussed.

5569
02:40:19,650 --> 02:40:20,700
I don't see a solution to that.

5570
02:40:20,701 --> 02:40:22,140
And I think in my opinion,

5571
02:40:22,350 --> 02:40:24,330
we can have this kind of
like we've tone things down.

5572
02:40:24,331 --> 02:40:25,560
We've had some interesting conversations,

5573
02:40:25,561 --> 02:40:26,394
but ultimately,

5574
02:40:26,700 --> 02:40:28,470
unless you're willing to
allow people to just speak,

5575
02:40:28,710 --> 02:40:30,030
speak entirely freely,

5576
02:40:30,510 --> 02:40:31,343
you are in,

5577
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:31,930
uh,

5578
02:40:31,930 --> 02:40:35,820
we have an unelected group with a near
monopoly on public discourse in many

5579
02:40:35,821 --> 02:40:36,241
capacities.

5580
02:40:36,241 --> 02:40:37,590
And I understand it's not everything.

5581
02:40:37,700 --> 02:40:39,690
It is big too and it's,

5582
02:40:39,720 --> 02:40:40,021
you know,

5583
02:40:40,021 --> 02:40:43,770
what I see is you are going to dictate
policy whether you realize it or not,

5584
02:40:44,040 --> 02:40:46,770
and that's going to terrify people and
it's going to make violence happen.

5585
02:40:46,770 --> 02:40:47,850
It's gonna make things worse.

5586
02:40:48,360 --> 02:40:48,720
You know,

5587
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:49,021
the,

5588
02:40:49,021 --> 02:40:49,854
the,

5589
02:40:49,870 --> 02:40:52,290
I hate bringing up this example on the,

5590
02:40:52,291 --> 02:40:54,090
on the rule from mis-gendering
because I'm actually,

5591
02:40:54,091 --> 02:40:56,760
I understand it and I can agree
with it to a certain extent.

5592
02:40:57,170 --> 02:40:57,420
Um,

5593
02:40:57,420 --> 02:40:57,840
and I've,

5594
02:40:57,840 --> 02:40:58,400
you know,

5595
02:40:58,400 --> 02:40:58,800
um,

5596
02:40:58,800 --> 02:41:00,390
nothing but we're nothing but
respect for the trans community.

5597
02:41:00,391 --> 02:41:03,300
But I also recognize we've seen
an escalation in street violence.

5598
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:07,630
We see a continually a disenfranchised
large faction of individual in his

5599
02:41:07,631 --> 02:41:08,400
country.

5600
02:41:08,400 --> 02:41:10,290
We then see only one
of those factions band.

5601
02:41:10,710 --> 02:41:14,790
We then see a massive
multinational billion dollar
corporation with private and

5602
02:41:14,970 --> 02:41:15,900
foreign investors.

5603
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:18,300
And it looks to me like if you hold,

5604
02:41:18,480 --> 02:41:19,410
if you know,

5605
02:41:19,740 --> 02:41:21,650
foreign governments are
trying to manipulate us there.

5606
02:41:21,660 --> 02:41:21,901
I don't,

5607
02:41:21,901 --> 02:41:25,050
I don't see a direct solution to that
problem that you do have political views,

5608
02:41:25,051 --> 02:41:25,980
you do enforce them.

5609
02:41:26,340 --> 02:41:29,220
And that means that Americans who are
abiding by American ruler being excised

5610
02:41:29,221 --> 02:41:30,900
from political discourse
and that's the future.

5611
02:41:30,930 --> 02:41:31,763
That's it.

5612
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:32,500
Yeah.

5613
02:41:32,500 --> 02:41:32,850
We,

5614
02:41:32,850 --> 02:41:34,060
we do have views on,

5615
02:41:34,061 --> 02:41:35,040
on the approach and,

5616
02:41:35,140 --> 02:41:35,620
and again,

5617
02:41:35,620 --> 02:41:36,453
uh,

5618
02:41:36,650 --> 02:41:37,483
we,

5619
02:41:37,560 --> 02:41:41,830
we ground this in creating as much
opportunity as possible for the largest

5620
02:41:41,831 --> 02:41:42,520
number of people.

5621
02:41:42,520 --> 02:41:43,160
Right?

5622
02:41:43,160 --> 02:41:45,970
That's where it starts
and where we are today.

5623
02:41:46,150 --> 02:41:46,540
Um,

5624
02:41:46,540 --> 02:41:48,040
we'll certainly evolve but like that,

5625
02:41:48,041 --> 02:41:49,940
that is what we are trying to base our,

5626
02:41:50,230 --> 02:41:51,520
our rules and judgments not,

5627
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:52,810
and I get that.

5628
02:41:52,870 --> 02:41:53,890
That's an ideology.

5629
02:41:53,980 --> 02:41:55,660
I completely understand it.

5630
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:57,050
But we,

5631
02:41:57,210 --> 02:41:58,480
we also have to,

5632
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:04,560
we also have to be free to experiment
with solutions and experiment with

5633
02:42:06,100 --> 02:42:10,720
evolving policy and putting something
out there that might look right at the

5634
02:42:10,721 --> 02:42:12,500
time and evolving.

5635
02:42:12,550 --> 02:42:13,780
I'm not saying this is it,

5636
02:42:13,781 --> 02:42:15,910
but like we,

5637
02:42:16,510 --> 02:42:18,400
we look to research,

5638
02:42:18,401 --> 02:42:21,430
we look to our experience
and data on the platform and,

5639
02:42:21,930 --> 02:42:24,490
and we make a call and if we get it wrong,

5640
02:42:24,730 --> 02:42:25,300
we're,

5641
02:42:25,300 --> 02:42:26,960
we're going to admit it and we're,

5642
02:42:26,961 --> 02:42:27,940
we're going to evolve it.

5643
02:42:28,150 --> 02:42:28,630
But I guess,

5644
02:42:28,630 --> 02:42:29,081
do you,

5645
02:42:29,081 --> 02:42:29,740
uh,

5646
02:42:29,740 --> 02:42:31,060
do you understand my point?

5647
02:42:31,240 --> 02:42:32,620
I understand the point that there are,

5648
02:42:32,621 --> 02:42:35,260
there are American citizens abiding by
the law who have a right to speak and be

5649
02:42:35,261 --> 02:42:37,570
involved in public discourse that
you have decided aren't allowed to.

5650
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:38,291
Yeah.

5651
02:42:38,291 --> 02:42:38,441
And,

5652
02:42:38,441 --> 02:42:39,850
and I think we've discussed,

5653
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:40,480
um,

5654
02:42:40,480 --> 02:42:41,180
like we,

5655
02:42:41,180 --> 02:42:41,541
we,

5656
02:42:41,541 --> 02:42:44,610
we don't see that as a win a win

5657
02:42:45,580 --> 02:42:47,760
as not promoting health
ultimately over time.

5658
02:42:47,790 --> 02:42:48,030
Right.

5659
02:42:48,030 --> 02:42:50,400
But is ultimately what is your priority?

5660
02:42:50,490 --> 02:42:54,090
Do you have it prioritized in terms of
what you got w what you guys would like

5661
02:42:54,091 --> 02:42:54,924
to change?

5662
02:42:55,260 --> 02:42:56,670
I think Jack has said
it a couple of times,

5663
02:42:56,671 --> 02:42:59,700
but the first thing we're going to do
is prioritize people's physical safety

5664
02:42:59,850 --> 02:43:00,690
because that's gotta be,

5665
02:43:02,160 --> 02:43:03,600
you already have done that pretty much,

5666
02:43:03,601 --> 02:43:04,340
right?

5667
02:43:04,340 --> 02:43:05,360
When you do that more,

5668
02:43:05,430 --> 02:43:06,450
we've prioritized it.

5669
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:07,353
Okay.

5670
02:43:07,430 --> 02:43:08,221
We're doing the work.

5671
02:43:08,221 --> 02:43:12,280
I don't think companies like
ours make the link enough.

5672
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:14,890
But what does he mean online
and offline ramifications?

5673
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:16,090
What's the main criticism?

5674
02:43:16,180 --> 02:43:17,620
What's the main criticism you guys,

5675
02:43:17,621 --> 02:43:19,960
is it censorship that you guys experience?

5676
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:21,410
Is it censorship is a banning,

5677
02:43:21,430 --> 02:43:21,881
like what does it,

5678
02:43:21,881 --> 02:43:22,271
what ends?

5679
02:43:22,271 --> 02:43:23,200
What do you get that at most?

5680
02:43:23,320 --> 02:43:23,951
It depends on who.

5681
02:43:23,951 --> 02:43:26,340
Every single person has
a different criticisms.

5682
02:43:26,341 --> 02:43:28,120
So I don't think there's
a universal opinion.

5683
02:43:28,121 --> 02:43:31,200
I mean you just painted the
picture right between like the,

5684
02:43:31,340 --> 02:43:31,980
the,

5685
02:43:31,980 --> 02:43:33,940
the left end of the
spectrum is asking for more.

5686
02:43:33,970 --> 02:43:34,280
Sure.

5687
02:43:34,280 --> 02:43:36,430
And the right is asking for less at,

5688
02:43:36,440 --> 02:43:39,010
that's very simplified
just for this country,

5689
02:43:39,520 --> 02:43:41,080
but at a high level.

5690
02:43:41,110 --> 02:43:41,710
Yeah,

5691
02:43:41,710 --> 02:43:42,520
that's consistent.

5692
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:42,680
I mean,

5693
02:43:42,680 --> 02:43:43,760
my opinion would be,

5694
02:43:44,030 --> 02:43:45,120
as much as I,

5695
02:43:45,230 --> 02:43:46,020
I don't,

5696
02:43:46,020 --> 02:43:47,480
I don't like a lot of
what people say about me,

5697
02:43:47,481 --> 02:43:48,314
what they do.

5698
02:43:48,380 --> 02:43:50,930
The rules you've enforced on Twitter
have done nothing to stop harassment

5699
02:43:50,931 --> 02:43:52,070
towards me or anyone else.

5700
02:43:52,430 --> 02:43:52,660
Right.

5701
02:43:52,660 --> 02:43:54,050
I swear to God my Twitter,

5702
02:43:54,080 --> 02:43:55,610
I mean my reddit is probably,

5703
02:43:55,611 --> 02:43:55,791
you know,

5704
02:43:55,791 --> 02:43:57,260
50 messages from various,

5705
02:43:57,261 --> 02:43:57,560
you know,

5706
02:43:57,560 --> 02:44:00,380
far left and left wing sub
reddits lying about me.

5707
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:02,220
It calling me horrible names,

5708
02:44:02,250 --> 02:44:02,511
quote,

5709
02:44:02,511 --> 02:44:04,010
tweeting me and these people are blocked,

5710
02:44:04,280 --> 02:44:04,750
right?

5711
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:04,980
And I,

5712
02:44:04,980 --> 02:44:07,490
and I never used to block people because
I thought it was silly because they can

5713
02:44:07,491 --> 02:44:08,324
get around it anyway.

5714
02:44:08,540 --> 02:44:10,130
But I decided to at one point,

5715
02:44:10,131 --> 02:44:10,911
because out of sight,

5716
02:44:10,911 --> 02:44:11,630
out of mind,

5717
02:44:11,630 --> 02:44:12,610
if they see my tweets last,

5718
02:44:12,611 --> 02:44:13,670
they'll probably interact with me last.

5719
02:44:13,671 --> 02:44:15,950
But they do this and they
lie about what I believe.

5720
02:44:15,951 --> 02:44:18,680
They lie about what I stand for and
they're trying to destroy everything about

5721
02:44:18,681 --> 02:44:19,880
me and they do this to other people.

5722
02:44:20,210 --> 02:44:21,080
I recognize that.

5723
02:44:21,350 --> 02:44:22,161
So ultimately I say,

5724
02:44:22,161 --> 02:44:22,311
well,

5725
02:44:22,311 --> 02:44:22,910
what can you do?

5726
02:44:22,910 --> 02:44:23,511
It's going to happen.

5727
02:44:23,511 --> 02:44:24,261
I'm one of these platforms.

5728
02:44:24,261 --> 02:44:25,190
The Internet is a thing,

5729
02:44:25,250 --> 02:44:26,240
as they say on the Internet,

5730
02:44:26,660 --> 02:44:27,590
welcome to the Internet.

5731
02:44:27,980 --> 02:44:28,611
So you know,

5732
02:44:28,611 --> 02:44:28,971
to me,

5733
02:44:28,971 --> 02:44:30,870
I see Twitter trying to
enforce all these rules to,

5734
02:44:30,900 --> 02:44:31,910
to maximize good.

5735
02:44:31,911 --> 02:44:34,400
And all you end up doing is
stripping people from the platform,

5736
02:44:34,730 --> 02:44:36,830
putting them in dark corners of
the web where they get worse.

5737
02:44:37,190 --> 02:44:39,200
And then you don't actually
solve the respite problem.

5738
02:44:39,220 --> 02:44:41,130
Really targeted dark corner of the web.

5739
02:44:41,160 --> 02:44:41,990
Right?

5740
02:44:41,990 --> 02:44:42,170
Right.

5741
02:44:42,170 --> 02:44:42,321
No,

5742
02:44:42,321 --> 02:44:43,154
I'm not talking to,

5743
02:44:43,340 --> 02:44:44,510
but there are dark corners of reddit.

5744
02:44:44,540 --> 02:44:45,800
There are alternatives.

5745
02:44:46,130 --> 02:44:49,490
I mean the Internet isn't gonna go away
and people have found alternatives.

5746
02:44:49,520 --> 02:44:51,560
And here's the other thing
that's really disconcerting.

5747
02:44:52,070 --> 02:44:56,630
We can see a trend among all of these
different big silicon valley tech

5748
02:44:56,631 --> 02:44:57,450
companies.

5749
02:44:57,450 --> 02:44:57,810
Uh,

5750
02:44:57,810 --> 02:44:58,040
they,

5751
02:44:58,040 --> 02:44:59,540
they hold a similar view to you guys.

5752
02:44:59,540 --> 02:45:03,080
They banned similar ideology and
they're creating a parallel society.

5753
02:45:03,470 --> 02:45:06,890
You've got alternative social networks
popping up that are taking the dregs of

5754
02:45:06,891 --> 02:45:07,041
the,

5755
02:45:07,041 --> 02:45:09,320
of the mainstream and give
them a place to flourish,

5756
02:45:09,350 --> 02:45:09,711
grow,

5757
02:45:09,711 --> 02:45:10,544
make money.

5758
02:45:10,610 --> 02:45:12,920
Now we're seeing people
be banned from mastercard,

5759
02:45:12,921 --> 02:45:13,341
from band,

5760
02:45:13,341 --> 02:45:13,791
from paypal,

5761
02:45:13,791 --> 02:45:17,660
even banned from chase bank because they
all hold the same similar ideology to

5762
02:45:17,661 --> 02:45:18,230
you.

5763
02:45:18,230 --> 02:45:18,441
Oh,

5764
02:45:18,441 --> 02:45:18,621
it's,

5765
02:45:18,621 --> 02:45:19,160
it's,

5766
02:45:19,160 --> 02:45:19,401
you know,

5767
02:45:19,401 --> 02:45:20,420
in some capacities,

5768
02:45:20,600 --> 02:45:20,841
uh,

5769
02:45:20,841 --> 02:45:22,250
I don't know exactly why chase does it.

5770
02:45:22,490 --> 02:45:24,980
I assume it's because you'll
get some activists who alive.

5771
02:45:25,010 --> 02:45:28,370
When we were talking about there've been
a series of individuals band from chase

5772
02:45:28,371 --> 02:45:30,740
bank accounts have been,

5773
02:45:30,741 --> 02:45:30,981
yes,

5774
02:45:30,981 --> 02:45:32,030
their accounts were closed.

5775
02:45:32,660 --> 02:45:35,330
I think maybe the most notable
might be Martina Marketta.

5776
02:45:35,870 --> 02:45:37,970
I don't know much about her.

5777
02:45:38,000 --> 02:45:40,100
I follow her on Twitter and their
tweets are typical conservative,

5778
02:45:40,101 --> 02:45:40,820
fair.

5779
02:45:40,820 --> 02:45:42,230
And she created a comic,

5780
02:45:42,231 --> 02:45:43,430
I think it's called lady alchemy.

5781
02:45:43,940 --> 02:45:47,090
She's a Trump supporter and she got a
notice that her business account was

5782
02:45:47,091 --> 02:45:47,924
terminated.

5783
02:45:48,080 --> 02:45:51,500
You then have Joe Biggs who
previously worked with Info wars.

5784
02:45:51,501 --> 02:45:52,730
I don't know much about this.

5785
02:45:52,731 --> 02:45:53,564
I didn't follow up,

5786
02:45:53,690 --> 02:45:54,620
but he tweeted out,

5787
02:45:54,710 --> 02:45:55,700
chases shattered my account.

5788
02:45:55,730 --> 02:45:58,670
And then you have the new chairman
of the proud boys and reggae.

5789
02:45:58,960 --> 02:45:59,793
I forgot his last name.

5790
02:45:59,860 --> 02:46:00,740
Tario or something.

5791
02:46:01,280 --> 02:46:03,590
And so I was really white.

5792
02:46:04,520 --> 02:46:04,791
Oh no,

5793
02:46:04,791 --> 02:46:05,061
he's a,

5794
02:46:05,061 --> 02:46:05,840
he's Afro Cuban.

5795
02:46:05,840 --> 02:46:06,171
I know.

5796
02:46:06,171 --> 02:46:07,004
That's what's the letter.

5797
02:46:07,370 --> 02:46:07,700
But I,

5798
02:46:07,700 --> 02:46:08,390
you know,

5799
02:46:08,390 --> 02:46:08,661
so,

5800
02:46:08,661 --> 02:46:09,230
so what,

5801
02:46:09,230 --> 02:46:10,130
what I see across the board,

5802
02:46:10,131 --> 02:46:10,731
it's not just,

5803
02:46:10,731 --> 02:46:12,800
and it's what I wanted to bring up
before about your perspective on these

5804
02:46:12,801 --> 02:46:13,131
things.

5805
02:46:13,131 --> 02:46:13,791
You guys are like,

5806
02:46:13,791 --> 02:46:16,430
we're going to do this one thing and
no snowflake blamed itself for the

5807
02:46:16,431 --> 02:46:16,821
avalanche.

5808
02:46:16,821 --> 02:46:17,654
But now what do we have?

5809
02:46:18,050 --> 02:46:19,970
We have conservatives
being stripped from paypal.

5810
02:46:20,270 --> 02:46:21,260
We have certain,

5811
02:46:21,740 --> 02:46:23,330
I'll just say individual
strip from paypal,

5812
02:46:23,331 --> 02:46:25,070
patrion financing.

5813
02:46:25,100 --> 02:46:26,240
So they set up alternatives.

5814
02:46:26,600 --> 02:46:28,880
Now we're seeing people who have,

5815
02:46:29,090 --> 02:46:30,140
like you mentioned,

5816
02:46:30,141 --> 02:46:30,980
Westboro Baptist Church,

5817
02:46:30,981 --> 02:46:33,320
and she's been deradicalized
by being on the platform.

5818
02:46:33,530 --> 02:46:36,200
But now we have people who are being
radicalized by being pushed into the dark

5819
02:46:36,201 --> 02:46:38,360
corners and they're building
and they're getting,

5820
02:46:38,390 --> 02:46:40,640
they're growing and they're
growing because there's this,

5821
02:46:40,900 --> 02:46:44,030
this idea that you can
control this and you can't,

5822
02:46:44,600 --> 02:46:44,980
you know,

5823
02:46:44,980 --> 02:46:45,260
uh,

5824
02:46:45,260 --> 02:46:48,920
I think you mentioned earlier that there
are studies showing and also counter

5825
02:46:48,921 --> 02:46:49,131
studies,

5826
02:46:49,131 --> 02:46:51,620
but people exposed to
each other is better.

5827
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:56,030
I found something really interesting and
because I have most at whether or not

5828
02:46:56,031 --> 02:46:58,880
people want to believe that's all of my
friends are on the left and some of them

5829
02:46:58,881 --> 02:47:00,320
are even like socialists.

5830
02:47:00,680 --> 02:47:04,220
And they're absolutely terrified to say
to talk because they know they'll get

5831
02:47:04,221 --> 02:47:06,860
attacked by the people who call for
censorship and try to get him fired.

5832
02:47:07,460 --> 02:47:09,380
And when I talked to them,

5833
02:47:09,800 --> 02:47:12,110
I was talking to a friend
of mine in La and she said,

5834
02:47:12,410 --> 02:47:13,730
is there a reason to vote for Trump?

5835
02:47:14,210 --> 02:47:16,550
And I explained a very simple
thing about Trump supporters.

5836
02:47:16,580 --> 02:47:17,630
This was back in 2016 and I said,

5837
02:47:17,660 --> 02:47:17,781
oh,

5838
02:47:17,781 --> 02:47:18,110
well,

5839
02:47:18,110 --> 02:47:18,291
you know,

5840
02:47:18,291 --> 02:47:20,540
you've got a lot of people who are
concerned about the free trade agreements

5841
02:47:20,810 --> 02:47:22,190
sending jobs overseas.

5842
02:47:22,310 --> 02:47:23,900
So they don't know much about Trump,

5843
02:47:23,901 --> 02:47:25,910
but they're gonna vote for him because
he supported that and so did Bernie.

5844
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:28,400
And then the response is really,

5845
02:47:28,490 --> 02:47:29,323
I didn't know that.

5846
02:47:29,480 --> 02:47:30,290
And so you have this,

5847
02:47:30,290 --> 02:47:34,220
this ever expanding narrative that Trump
supporters are Nazis and the Maga hat

5848
02:47:34,221 --> 02:47:35,210
is the KKK hood.

5849
02:47:35,420 --> 02:47:36,290
And a lot of this rhetoric,

5850
02:47:36,310 --> 02:47:36,640
you know,

5851
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:37,251
emerges on Twitter.

5852
02:47:37,251 --> 02:47:37,950
But when,

5853
02:47:37,950 --> 02:47:39,710
when a lot of these people
are getting excised,

5854
02:47:40,190 --> 02:47:43,670
then you can't actually meet these people
and see that they're actually people.

5855
02:47:43,671 --> 02:47:44,540
And they may be mean.

5856
02:47:44,680 --> 02:47:45,620
They may be mean people,

5857
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:46,970
they may be awful people,

5858
02:47:46,971 --> 02:47:47,960
but they're still people.

5859
02:47:47,990 --> 02:47:50,000
And even if they have bad opinions,

5860
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:51,230
sometimes you actually,

5861
02:47:51,290 --> 02:47:53,270
I think in most instances
you find the regular people,

5862
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:53,811
well,

5863
02:47:53,811 --> 02:47:57,530
there's a part of the problem of calling
for censorship and banning people in

5864
02:47:57,531 --> 02:48:01,970
that it is sometimes effective and that
people don't want to be thought of as

5865
02:48:01,971 --> 02:48:06,350
being racist or in support of racism
were in support of nationalism or any of

5866
02:48:06,351 --> 02:48:07,280
these horrible things.

5867
02:48:07,281 --> 02:48:12,281
So you feel like if you support these
Banning's you support positive discourse

5868
02:48:13,341 --> 02:48:15,140
in a good society and all
these different things,

5869
02:48:15,470 --> 02:48:19,820
what you don't realize is what you're
saying is that this does create these dark

5870
02:48:19,821 --> 02:48:24,800
corners of the web and these other social
media platforms evolve and have farm.

5871
02:48:24,840 --> 02:48:27,590
It mean when you're talking
about bubbles and about these,

5872
02:48:27,591 --> 02:48:28,050
uh,

5873
02:48:28,050 --> 02:48:28,470
the,

5874
02:48:28,470 --> 02:48:30,290
these group think bubbles,

5875
02:48:30,650 --> 02:48:34,520
the worst kind of group think bubbles
is a bunch of hateful people that get

5876
02:48:34,521 --> 02:48:36,290
together and decide their posts.

5877
02:48:36,500 --> 02:48:38,630
They've been persecuted instead of,

5878
02:48:38,690 --> 02:48:42,500
like we were talking about with Megan
Phelps having an opportunity to maybe

5879
02:48:42,501 --> 02:48:45,950
reshaped their views by having
discourse with people who choose to,

5880
02:48:45,951 --> 02:48:47,480
or not choose to engage with them.

5881
02:48:47,610 --> 02:48:47,821
Well,

5882
02:48:47,821 --> 02:48:48,270
let's,

5883
02:48:48,270 --> 02:48:49,120
let's think about the,

5884
02:48:49,121 --> 02:48:51,390
the logical end of
where this is all going.

5885
02:48:51,660 --> 02:48:52,890
You want healthier conversation,

5886
02:48:52,891 --> 02:48:55,770
so you're willing to get
rid of some people who then
feel persecuted and have no

5887
02:48:55,771 --> 02:48:57,210
choice but to band together with others.

5888
02:48:57,450 --> 02:48:58,051
Mastercard,

5889
02:48:58,051 --> 02:48:58,501
chase,

5890
02:48:58,501 --> 02:48:59,010
Patrion,

5891
02:48:59,010 --> 02:48:59,550
they all do it.

5892
02:48:59,550 --> 02:49:00,383
Facebook does it.

5893
02:49:00,870 --> 02:49:01,703
They're growing.

5894
02:49:01,740 --> 02:49:02,610
These platforms are growing.

5895
02:49:02,611 --> 02:49:03,421
They're getting more users,

5896
02:49:03,421 --> 02:49:03,961
they're expanding,

5897
02:49:03,961 --> 02:49:05,850
they're showing up in real
life and they're there.

5898
02:49:06,180 --> 02:49:06,690
You know,

5899
02:49:06,690 --> 02:49:10,020
even these people who are
band aren't the Neo Nazi evil.

5900
02:49:10,260 --> 02:49:13,590
They're just regular people who have
banded together that forms a parallel

5901
02:49:13,591 --> 02:49:14,221
finance system,

5902
02:49:14,221 --> 02:49:15,150
a parallel economy.

5903
02:49:15,510 --> 02:49:18,120
You've got Patriot alternatives
emerging where people are saying,

5904
02:49:18,150 --> 02:49:18,391
you know,

5905
02:49:18,391 --> 02:49:18,571
we,

5906
02:49:18,571 --> 02:49:21,630
we reject you and now I want a platform
where people say the most ridiculous

5907
02:49:21,631 --> 02:49:22,410
things.

5908
02:49:22,410 --> 02:49:22,810
Now

5909
02:49:22,810 --> 02:49:24,370
money normalizes that as well.

5910
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:25,233
That's also,

5911
02:49:25,540 --> 02:49:26,770
that's what I mean by parallel society.

5912
02:49:26,771 --> 02:49:27,130
To them,

5913
02:49:27,130 --> 02:49:29,320
everything they're
doing is just and right,

5914
02:49:29,440 --> 02:49:33,220
and you can't stop them anymore and it
develops hate for the opposing viewpoint.

5915
02:49:33,221 --> 02:49:35,920
You Start Hating people
that are progressive because
these are the people that,

5916
02:49:35,921 --> 02:49:39,250
like you and I have talked about the data
and society report that labeled us as

5917
02:49:39,251 --> 02:49:39,701
all right,

5918
02:49:39,701 --> 02:49:41,080
adjacent or whatever.

5919
02:49:41,081 --> 02:49:42,520
Now more fake news coming out about it.

5920
02:49:42,550 --> 02:49:42,910
Right?

5921
02:49:42,910 --> 02:49:47,860
So that's connected because you and I
have talked to people that are a on the

5922
02:49:47,861 --> 02:49:48,910
ride or far right,

5923
02:49:48,911 --> 02:49:52,900
that somehow or another were secretly
far right and that there's this influence

5924
02:49:53,090 --> 02:49:55,680
network of people together and says fake.

5925
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:55,810
Well,

5926
02:49:55,810 --> 02:49:56,120
it's,

5927
02:49:56,120 --> 02:49:57,940
it's a schizophrenia connection.

5928
02:49:57,941 --> 02:50:01,120
That's one of those weird things
where people draw a circle.

5929
02:50:01,150 --> 02:50:01,301
Oh,

5930
02:50:01,301 --> 02:50:03,340
you talked to this guy and
this guy talked to that guy,

5931
02:50:03,341 --> 02:50:04,090
therefore you know that.

5932
02:50:04,090 --> 02:50:04,410
Yeah.

5933
02:50:04,410 --> 02:50:04,561
Well,

5934
02:50:04,561 --> 02:50:04,711
so,

5935
02:50:04,711 --> 02:50:04,980
so,

5936
02:50:04,980 --> 02:50:05,850
so here's a,

5937
02:50:05,851 --> 02:50:07,440
an expanded part of this problem.

5938
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:08,100
Uh,

5939
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:08,521
so this,

5940
02:50:08,521 --> 02:50:08,760
this,

5941
02:50:08,760 --> 02:50:09,541
you're probably not familiar,

5942
02:50:09,541 --> 02:50:13,210
but a group called data and society
published what's entirely fake report

5943
02:50:13,560 --> 02:50:16,170
labeling 81 alt-right adjacent
or wherever they want to call it,

5944
02:50:16,171 --> 02:50:17,820
youtube channels included
Joe Rogan and me.

5945
02:50:17,850 --> 02:50:18,683
It's fake.

5946
02:50:18,810 --> 02:50:22,110
But you know what a couple dozen news
outlets wrote about it as if it was fact.

5947
02:50:22,170 --> 02:50:24,410
You believe the proud
boys were labeled as Fba.

5948
02:50:24,440 --> 02:50:24,660
Uh,

5949
02:50:24,660 --> 02:50:26,460
by the FBI's extremists
when they actually weren't,

5950
02:50:26,461 --> 02:50:28,860
it was a sheriff's report from
someone not affiliate with the FBI,

5951
02:50:29,340 --> 02:50:32,190
but they are activists within
media who have an agenda.

5952
02:50:32,640 --> 02:50:32,941
And we,

5953
02:50:32,941 --> 02:50:34,560
we saw this with learn to code.

5954
02:50:34,680 --> 02:50:37,410
It was an NBC reporter
who very clearly is in,

5955
02:50:37,411 --> 02:50:37,651
you know,

5956
02:50:37,651 --> 02:50:40,650
left wing identitarian
writing a story for NBC.

5957
02:50:40,950 --> 02:50:44,040
Then your average American sees
that NBC story thinks it's factual.

5958
02:50:44,370 --> 02:50:45,480
Then everyone talks about it.

5959
02:50:45,510 --> 02:50:46,500
Then your people hear about it.

5960
02:50:46,501 --> 02:50:47,520
Then you start banning people.

5961
02:50:47,820 --> 02:50:49,030
So you know,

5962
02:50:49,031 --> 02:50:49,150
the,

5963
02:50:49,150 --> 02:50:50,820
I guess to drive the point home,

5964
02:50:51,750 --> 02:50:53,370
the snowflake one blame
itself for the avalanche.

5965
02:50:53,371 --> 02:50:54,840
You guys are doing what
you think is right.

5966
02:50:55,320 --> 02:50:56,550
So is Facebook,

5967
02:50:56,551 --> 02:50:56,911
youtube,

5968
02:50:56,911 --> 02:50:57,271
patriot,

5969
02:50:57,271 --> 02:50:57,600
all these,

5970
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:00,450
all these platforms and it's all
going to result in one thing.

5971
02:51:00,660 --> 02:51:03,180
It's going to result in groups like
Patriot prayer on the proud boys sang.

5972
02:51:03,181 --> 02:51:05,040
I refuse to back down showing up.

5973
02:51:05,070 --> 02:51:06,510
It's gonna result an Antifa showing up.

5974
02:51:06,750 --> 02:51:08,520
It's going to result in more extremism.

5975
02:51:08,880 --> 02:51:11,550
You've got an Antifa count that published
the home addresses and phone numbers

5976
02:51:11,551 --> 02:51:12,480
that hasn't been banned.

5977
02:51:12,690 --> 02:51:15,780
That's going to further
show conservatives that the,

5978
02:51:15,781 --> 02:51:16,170
the p,

5979
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:17,400
the policing is asymmetrical.

5980
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:17,851
Whether,

5981
02:51:17,851 --> 02:51:18,270
you know,

5982
02:51:18,270 --> 02:51:19,103
it is or isn't.

5983
02:51:19,470 --> 02:51:23,820
And I think the only outcome to this
on the current course of action is like

5984
02:51:23,850 --> 02:51:24,630
insurgency.

5985
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:27,090
We've seen people
planting bombs in Houston,

5986
02:51:27,091 --> 02:51:27,930
tried to blow up a statue.

5987
02:51:28,220 --> 02:51:30,150
We saw someone plant a bomb at
a police station and Eugene,

5988
02:51:30,151 --> 02:51:30,780
Oregon,

5989
02:51:30,780 --> 02:51:31,531
two weeks before that,

5990
02:51:31,531 --> 02:51:34,320
a guy showed up with a gun and fired
two rounds at a cop wearing a smash the

5991
02:51:34,321 --> 02:51:35,340
patriarchy and she'll share.

5992
02:51:35,850 --> 02:51:36,840
So you know,

5993
02:51:36,841 --> 02:51:37,021
so,

5994
02:51:37,021 --> 02:51:37,651
so that happens.

5995
02:51:37,651 --> 02:51:39,120
Then a week later they say
you killed our comrade.

5996
02:51:39,121 --> 02:51:40,260
Then a week later Obama's planted,

5997
02:51:40,261 --> 02:51:41,280
I don't believe it's a coincidence.

5998
02:51:41,281 --> 02:51:42,114
Maybe it is,

5999
02:51:42,450 --> 02:51:44,430
but I lived in New York.

6000
02:51:44,431 --> 02:51:48,660
I got out too many people knew who I was
and there was people sending me emails

6001
02:51:48,661 --> 02:51:49,920
with threats and I'm like,

6002
02:51:49,921 --> 02:51:50,700
this is escalating.

6003
02:51:50,700 --> 02:51:50,941
You know,

6004
02:51:50,941 --> 02:51:52,530
we've seen throughout the
past years with Trump,

6005
02:51:52,531 --> 02:51:53,320
we've seen,

6006
02:51:53,320 --> 02:51:53,970
um,

6007
02:51:53,970 --> 02:51:58,110
Breitbart has a list of 640 instances
of Trump supporters being physically

6008
02:51:58,111 --> 02:51:59,700
attacked or harassed in some way.

6009
02:52:00,030 --> 02:52:04,620
There was a story the other day about an
81 year old man who was attacked and it

6010
02:52:04,621 --> 02:52:07,510
seems like everything's flowing in
one direction and nobody wants take

6011
02:52:07,511 --> 02:52:10,810
responsibility and say maybe
we're doing something wrong.

6012
02:52:10,811 --> 02:52:11,644
Right.

6013
02:52:11,770 --> 02:52:12,231
This is why that,

6014
02:52:12,231 --> 02:52:13,840
that's why I brought up
earlier regulation as a,

6015
02:52:13,850 --> 02:52:14,411
in my opinion,

6016
02:52:14,411 --> 02:52:15,080
inevitable.

6017
02:52:15,080 --> 02:52:15,230
Yeah,

6018
02:52:15,230 --> 02:52:15,710
I mean I,

6019
02:52:15,710 --> 02:52:19,420
I don't think it's going to be the
responsibility of any one company.

6020
02:52:19,440 --> 02:52:19,690
We,

6021
02:52:19,690 --> 02:52:23,260
we have a desire and need to be clear
that we have a desire to promote health

6022
02:52:23,320 --> 02:52:26,890
and in public conversation
and as we've said,

6023
02:52:27,070 --> 02:52:27,421
like I,

6024
02:52:27,421 --> 02:52:32,080
I don't think over time a
permanent ban promotes health.

6025
02:52:32,170 --> 02:52:32,480
I,

6026
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:32,780
I,

6027
02:52:32,780 --> 02:52:33,341
I don't,

6028
02:52:33,341 --> 02:52:35,200
but we have,

6029
02:52:35,320 --> 02:52:36,160
we have to,

6030
02:52:36,190 --> 02:52:37,030
we have to get there.

6031
02:52:37,530 --> 02:52:39,130
There are exceptions
to the rule of course,

6032
02:52:39,131 --> 02:52:40,450
but like we,

6033
02:52:40,840 --> 02:52:41,380
we,

6034
02:52:41,380 --> 02:52:41,680
we,

6035
02:52:41,680 --> 02:52:42,820
we just have work to do and I,

6036
02:52:42,830 --> 02:52:45,790
I had the benefit of
conversations like this is,

6037
02:52:45,820 --> 02:52:46,840
we're talking about it more,

6038
02:52:46,841 --> 02:52:49,510
but the people will naturally call us out.

6039
02:52:49,511 --> 02:52:50,344
Like you got to,

6040
02:52:50,350 --> 02:52:51,400
you got to show it as well.

6041
02:52:51,490 --> 02:52:52,620
Do you fear regulation?

6042
02:52:53,650 --> 02:52:54,280
I don't,

6043
02:52:54,280 --> 02:52:55,570
I don't fear regulation.

6044
02:52:55,571 --> 02:52:55,840
If,

6045
02:52:55,840 --> 02:52:58,330
if we're talking about
regulation in the government,

6046
02:52:58,331 --> 02:53:03,331
intervention in the job of if a regular
job is to protect the individual and

6047
02:53:03,581 --> 02:53:07,840
make sure that they level the playing
field and they're not pushed by any

6048
02:53:07,841 --> 02:53:09,640
particular special interest,

6049
02:53:09,641 --> 02:53:12,520
like companies like ours who might,

6050
02:53:12,700 --> 02:53:13,533
you know,

6051
02:53:13,900 --> 02:53:14,250
uh,

6052
02:53:14,250 --> 02:53:17,620
PR work with irregular to
protect our own interest,

6053
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:19,000
that I think is incorrect.

6054
02:53:19,210 --> 02:53:21,460
I agree that we should have,

6055
02:53:21,970 --> 02:53:22,803
um,

6056
02:53:23,800 --> 02:53:26,920
an agency that can help us protect the,

6057
02:53:27,880 --> 02:53:30,070
protect the individual and
level the playing field I had.

6058
02:53:30,071 --> 02:53:35,071
So I think oftentimes companies see
themselves as reacting to regulation.

6059
02:53:35,710 --> 02:53:37,960
I think we need to take
more of an education role.

6060
02:53:38,350 --> 02:53:39,490
So I don't fear it.

6061
02:53:39,491 --> 02:53:42,880
I want to make sure that we're
educating regulators on what's possible,

6062
02:53:42,881 --> 02:53:44,620
what we're seeing and where we could go.

6063
02:53:44,680 --> 02:53:46,300
When you say educating regulators,

6064
02:53:46,460 --> 02:53:50,350
that's initiating irregulation
[inaudible] not necessarily.

6065
02:53:50,351 --> 02:53:53,710
I mean there we might just be Todd Keating
regulators who are these regulators.

6066
02:53:54,210 --> 02:53:55,750
These are folks who,

6067
02:53:56,020 --> 02:54:01,020
who might be tasked with coming up with
a proposal for particular legislation or

6068
02:54:01,570 --> 02:54:02,170
laws,

6069
02:54:02,170 --> 02:54:02,440
um,

6070
02:54:02,440 --> 02:54:03,340
to present to,

6071
02:54:03,880 --> 02:54:04,680
um,

6072
02:54:04,680 --> 02:54:04,990
uh,

6073
02:54:04,990 --> 02:54:05,823
legislators.

6074
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:10,090
So it's making sure that we are
educating to the best of our ability.

6075
02:54:10,091 --> 02:54:11,200
This is what we are,

6076
02:54:11,201 --> 02:54:12,011
this is what we see,

6077
02:54:12,011 --> 02:54:13,420
this is where technology is going.

6078
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:16,140
And do you think you can
hold off regulation now,

6079
02:54:16,340 --> 02:54:20,950
do you think that by these approaches
and by being proactive and by taking a

6080
02:54:20,951 --> 02:54:21,281
standard,

6081
02:54:21,281 --> 02:54:25,240
perhaps offering up a road to redemption
to these people and making clear

6082
02:54:25,241 --> 02:54:27,010
distinctions between what you're,

6083
02:54:27,280 --> 02:54:28,071
what you're allowing,

6084
02:54:28,071 --> 02:54:28,901
what you're not allowing,

6085
02:54:28,901 --> 02:54:31,870
you can hold off regulation or do you
disagree with what he's saying about

6086
02:54:31,871 --> 02:54:32,161
regularly?

6087
02:54:32,161 --> 02:54:32,261
No,

6088
02:54:32,261 --> 02:54:33,071
I don't believe that should be.

6089
02:54:33,071 --> 02:54:34,710
Our goal is to hold off regulation.

6090
02:54:34,720 --> 02:54:36,790
I believe we should be,

6091
02:54:37,030 --> 02:54:39,790
we should participate
like any other citizen,

6092
02:54:39,791 --> 02:54:44,140
whether it be a corporate citizen or an
individual citizen in helping to guide

6093
02:54:44,141 --> 02:54:44,980
the right regulation.

6094
02:54:45,550 --> 02:54:45,910
So,

6095
02:54:45,910 --> 02:54:46,210
uh,

6096
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:46,931
are you familiar,

6097
02:54:46,931 --> 02:54:50,170
and I could be wrong on this because
it's been like 15 years since I've done

6098
02:54:50,171 --> 02:54:50,261
this.

6099
02:54:50,261 --> 02:54:52,900
Are you familiar with the clean
water restoration act at all?

6100
02:54:52,940 --> 02:54:53,830
I don't expect you to be.

6101
02:54:53,831 --> 02:54:54,664
It's a very specific thing.

6102
02:54:54,940 --> 02:54:55,421
So,

6103
02:54:55,421 --> 02:54:55,691
uh,

6104
02:54:55,691 --> 02:54:59,380
it was at some point in like the early
seventies there was a river in Ohio,

6105
02:54:59,381 --> 02:54:59,771
and again,

6106
02:54:59,771 --> 02:55:00,191
I could be wrong,

6107
02:55:00,191 --> 02:55:01,060
it's been 15 years.

6108
02:55:01,061 --> 02:55:02,440
I used to work for an
environmental organization,

6109
02:55:02,860 --> 02:55:03,693
started on fire.

6110
02:55:04,250 --> 02:55:08,390
And what was typically told to us was
that all of these different companies said

6111
02:55:08,391 --> 02:55:09,230
we're doing the right thing.

6112
02:55:09,800 --> 02:55:10,880
But like as I mentioned,

6113
02:55:10,881 --> 02:55:12,110
the snowflake doesn't blame itself.

6114
02:55:12,290 --> 02:55:15,890
So over time the river was so polluted
it became sludge and lit on fire.

6115
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:17,060
And so someone said,

6116
02:55:17,390 --> 02:55:20,780
if all of these companies think they're
doing the right thing and they've all

6117
02:55:20,781 --> 02:55:22,280
just contributed to this nightmare,

6118
02:55:22,550 --> 02:55:24,560
we need to tell them blanket regulation.

6119
02:55:25,010 --> 02:55:26,690
And so what I see with these companies,

6120
02:55:26,691 --> 02:55:28,130
like banking institutions,

6121
02:55:28,160 --> 02:55:31,280
public discourse platforms
via distribution,

6122
02:55:31,820 --> 02:55:32,481
I actually,

6123
02:55:32,481 --> 02:55:35,300
I'm really worried about what regulation
will look like because I think the

6124
02:55:35,301 --> 02:55:37,040
government is going to
screw everything up,

6125
02:55:37,310 --> 02:55:40,490
but I think there's going
to be a recoil of a,

6126
02:55:40,500 --> 02:55:42,170
at first I think the Republicans,

6127
02:55:42,320 --> 02:55:45,050
because I watched the testimony you had
in Congress and I thought they had no

6128
02:55:45,051 --> 02:55:45,771
idea what they're talking about,

6129
02:55:45,771 --> 02:55:46,604
nor did they care.

6130
02:55:46,850 --> 02:55:48,380
There was like a couple of
people who make good points,

6131
02:55:48,381 --> 02:55:49,310
but for the most part they were like,

6132
02:55:49,311 --> 02:55:50,144
I don't whatever,

6133
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:51,410
and asked about Russia and stuff.

6134
02:55:51,650 --> 02:55:52,760
So they have no idea what's going on.

6135
02:55:52,761 --> 02:55:54,830
But there will come a time when you know,

6136
02:55:54,831 --> 02:55:55,161
for instance,

6137
02:55:55,161 --> 02:55:55,550
one of the,

6138
02:55:55,550 --> 02:55:58,700
one of the great things they brought up
was that by default when someone in DC

6139
02:55:58,701 --> 02:55:59,270
signs up,

6140
02:55:59,270 --> 02:56:01,310
they see way more
Democrats than Republicans.

6141
02:56:01,730 --> 02:56:02,000
Right.

6142
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:02,141
You,

6143
02:56:02,141 --> 02:56:03,390
you remember that when you testified?

6144
02:56:03,440 --> 02:56:04,010
Yeah.

6145
02:56:04,010 --> 02:56:04,730
So,

6146
02:56:04,730 --> 02:56:07,210
well that there's an
issue and I don't think I,

6147
02:56:07,220 --> 02:56:08,870
I believe you when you
say it's Algorithmic,

6148
02:56:08,900 --> 02:56:09,733
that these are,

6149
02:56:09,980 --> 02:56:10,191
you know,

6150
02:56:10,191 --> 02:56:11,210
prominent individuals.

6151
02:56:11,211 --> 02:56:12,590
So they get automatically recommended.

6152
02:56:12,890 --> 02:56:13,723
But then there,

6153
02:56:13,810 --> 02:56:14,780
so again,

6154
02:56:14,810 --> 02:56:15,650
the solution to that,

6155
02:56:15,651 --> 02:56:18,440
like how do you regulate a programmer
to create an algorithm to solve that

6156
02:56:18,441 --> 02:56:19,100
problem is,

6157
02:56:19,100 --> 02:56:21,650
is it's crazy you're regulating
someone to invent a technology.

6158
02:56:22,190 --> 02:56:25,010
But I feel like there'll be
a backlash when too many,

6159
02:56:25,190 --> 02:56:26,510
right now we're seeing the reason,

6160
02:56:26,540 --> 02:56:28,790
one of the reasons we're having this
conversation is that conservatives feel

6161
02:56:28,791 --> 02:56:31,280
like they're being
persecuted and repressed.

6162
02:56:31,820 --> 02:56:33,160
So then it's going to escalate from,

6163
02:56:33,180 --> 02:56:34,610
it's not going to stop
with these conversations.

6164
02:56:34,690 --> 02:56:35,240
And so that we're,

6165
02:56:35,240 --> 02:56:38,050
we've been having a lot of talks about
this particularly around algorithms.

6166
02:56:38,080 --> 02:56:38,640
And,

6167
02:56:38,640 --> 02:56:39,010
um,

6168
02:56:39,010 --> 02:56:42,130
one of the things that we are only focused
on is not just fairness in outcomes

6169
02:56:42,131 --> 02:56:43,750
but also explainability of algorithms.

6170
02:56:43,751 --> 02:56:44,584
And I know Jackie,

6171
02:56:44,730 --> 02:56:45,331
you love this stuff,

6172
02:56:45,331 --> 02:56:47,140
so I don't know if you want to talk
a little bit about our work there.

6173
02:56:47,380 --> 02:56:47,831
You know what I mean?

6174
02:56:47,831 --> 02:56:48,191
We,

6175
02:56:48,191 --> 02:56:48,640
um,

6176
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:52,660
so there's two fields of research within
artificial intelligence or rather new,

6177
02:56:52,661 --> 02:56:54,490
but I think really
impactful for our industry.

6178
02:56:54,491 --> 02:56:56,410
One is fairness and ml.

6179
02:56:57,040 --> 02:57:00,040
So you're guessing what
fairness and machine learning,

6180
02:57:00,100 --> 02:57:01,840
like learning and deep learning.

6181
02:57:01,960 --> 02:57:06,610
So looking at everything from what
data set is fed to an algorithm.

6182
02:57:06,940 --> 02:57:11,500
So like the training data set all the
way to how the algorithm actually behaves

6183
02:57:11,501 --> 02:57:11,950
on that,

6184
02:57:11,950 --> 02:57:12,783
on that data set,

6185
02:57:13,210 --> 02:57:14,090
making sure that it,

6186
02:57:14,170 --> 02:57:19,170
it does not develop bias over the launch
at longevity of the algorithms use

6187
02:57:20,141 --> 02:57:20,950
case.

6188
02:57:20,950 --> 02:57:23,920
So that's one area that
we want to lead in.

6189
02:57:23,921 --> 02:57:28,780
And we've been working with some of the
leading researchers in the industry to

6190
02:57:28,781 --> 02:57:33,400
do that because the reality is a
lot of this human judgment is moving

6191
02:57:33,401 --> 02:57:34,234
algorithms.

6192
02:57:34,420 --> 02:57:39,420
And the second issue with it moving
now rhythms is algorithms today can't

6193
02:57:39,581 --> 02:57:43,780
necessarily explain the decision making
criteria that they use so they can't

6194
02:57:43,781 --> 02:57:44,351
explain.

6195
02:57:44,351 --> 02:57:45,490
And the way that you make a decision,

6196
02:57:45,500 --> 02:57:46,960
you explained why you make that decision.

6197
02:57:47,350 --> 02:57:50,080
Algorithms today are not being programmed
in such a way that they can even

6198
02:57:50,081 --> 02:57:53,140
explain that you may wear
an Apple Watch for instance.

6199
02:57:53,141 --> 02:57:55,300
It might tell you to
stand every now and then.

6200
02:57:55,750 --> 02:57:56,530
Um,

6201
02:57:56,530 --> 02:57:59,560
right now those algorithms
can't explain why,

6202
02:57:59,740 --> 02:58:00,550
why they're doing that,

6203
02:58:00,550 --> 02:58:01,010
right?

6204
02:58:01,010 --> 02:58:01,260
That,

6205
02:58:01,260 --> 02:58:02,100
that's a bad example

6206
02:58:02,100 --> 02:58:03,450
cause he does it every food,

6207
02:58:03,540 --> 02:58:04,470
every 50 minutes.

6208
02:58:04,471 --> 02:58:05,240
But,

6209
02:58:05,240 --> 02:58:05,730
um,

6210
02:58:05,730 --> 02:58:09,210
as we offload more and more of these
decisions both internally and also

6211
02:58:09,211 --> 02:58:13,500
individually two watches
and two cars and whatnot,

6212
02:58:13,980 --> 02:58:14,291
there,

6213
02:58:14,291 --> 02:58:15,150
there was no,

6214
02:58:15,151 --> 02:58:15,510
uh,

6215
02:58:15,510 --> 02:58:19,950
there's no ability right now for that
algorithm to actually go through and list

6216
02:58:19,951 --> 02:58:21,930
out the criteria used
to make that decision.

6217
02:58:21,931 --> 02:58:25,320
So this is another area that we'd like
to get really good at if we want to

6218
02:58:25,321 --> 02:58:27,990
continue to be transparent
around our actions,

6219
02:58:27,991 --> 02:58:32,430
because a lot of these things are just
black boxes and they're being built in

6220
02:58:32,431 --> 02:58:34,710
that way because there's
been no research into like,

6221
02:58:34,740 --> 02:58:38,160
well how do we get these algorithms
to explain what their decision is?

6222
02:58:38,310 --> 02:58:39,360
That question hasn't been asked.

6223
02:58:39,450 --> 02:58:43,020
My fear is it's technology
that you need to build,

6224
02:58:43,470 --> 02:58:43,901
but the,

6225
02:58:43,901 --> 02:58:45,330
the public discourse is there.

6226
02:58:45,670 --> 02:58:47,310
We know that foreign
governments are doing this.

6227
02:58:47,311 --> 02:58:49,800
We know that democratic
operatives in Alabama did this.

6228
02:58:50,040 --> 02:58:51,690
And so I imagine that,

6229
02:58:52,300 --> 02:58:52,531
you know,

6230
02:58:52,531 --> 02:58:53,251
with Donald Trump,

6231
02:58:53,251 --> 02:58:53,431
I,

6232
02:58:53,431 --> 02:58:53,760
I,

6233
02:58:53,760 --> 02:58:54,031
you know,

6234
02:58:54,031 --> 02:58:56,900
he talked about an executive order for
free speech on college campuses so that

6235
02:58:56,901 --> 02:58:56,981
the,

6236
02:58:56,981 --> 02:58:58,470
the chattering is here.

6237
02:58:58,890 --> 02:59:01,470
Someone's going to take a
sledgehammer to Twitter,

6238
02:59:01,471 --> 02:59:01,891
to Facebook,

6239
02:59:01,891 --> 02:59:05,670
to youtube and just be alike for not
understanding the technology behind it,

6240
02:59:06,090 --> 02:59:08,940
not willing to give you the benefit of
the benefit of the doubt and just saying,

6241
02:59:08,970 --> 02:59:09,930
I don't care why you're doing it.

6242
02:59:09,931 --> 02:59:10,764
We are mad.

6243
02:59:10,890 --> 02:59:11,341
You know what I mean?

6244
02:59:11,341 --> 02:59:12,740
And then pass some bells and,

6245
02:59:12,810 --> 02:59:14,460
and then it's over again.

6246
02:59:14,700 --> 02:59:15,240
Clarifying,

6247
02:59:15,240 --> 02:59:15,620
I,

6248
02:59:15,620 --> 02:59:19,140
I think you guys are biased and I
think what you're doing is dangerous,

6249
02:59:19,530 --> 02:59:21,060
but I think that doesn't matter.

6250
02:59:21,090 --> 02:59:22,290
It doesn't matter what you think is right.

6251
02:59:22,320 --> 02:59:25,500
It matters that all of these companies
are doing similar things and it's,

6252
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:25,830
and it's,

6253
02:59:25,830 --> 02:59:27,210
and it's already terrifying people.

6254
02:59:27,480 --> 02:59:27,781
I mean,

6255
02:59:27,781 --> 02:59:28,051
look,

6256
02:59:28,051 --> 02:59:28,241
when,

6257
02:59:28,241 --> 02:59:30,000
when I saw somebody got banned
from their bank account,

6258
02:59:30,720 --> 02:59:31,860
that's terrifying.

6259
02:59:31,890 --> 02:59:33,330
And paypal has done this for a long time,

6260
02:59:33,350 --> 02:59:33,940
you know,

6261
02:59:33,940 --> 02:59:38,370
seems like more grievous than being
banned from any social justice or social

6262
02:59:38,550 --> 02:59:42,570
media platform that that
seems to me to be worthy of

6263
02:59:43,910 --> 02:59:47,060
boycott Patriot patriot and
issued a statement about a man,

6264
02:59:47,061 --> 02:59:50,510
I believe his name is Robert Spencer and
they said mastercard instructed us to

6265
02:59:50,511 --> 02:59:51,344
ban him.

6266
02:59:51,410 --> 02:59:51,831
And you know what?

6267
02:59:51,831 --> 02:59:51,981
You know,

6268
02:59:51,981 --> 02:59:54,350
I'll say this to me mentioning chase,

6269
02:59:54,380 --> 02:59:54,831
paypal,

6270
02:59:54,831 --> 02:59:56,270
mastercard terrifies me.

6271
02:59:56,540 --> 02:59:58,040
I'm on the Joe Rogan podcast right now,

6272
02:59:58,070 --> 03:00:00,170
calling out these big
companies in defiance.

6273
03:00:00,990 --> 03:00:04,010
I would like to know all the specifics
of why they chose to do that.

6274
03:00:04,011 --> 03:00:06,830
And I would hope that they would release
some sort of a statement explaining why

6275
03:00:06,831 --> 03:00:07,551
they chose to do that.

6276
03:00:07,551 --> 03:00:08,720
Maybe there's something we don't know.

6277
03:00:08,840 --> 03:00:09,201
There was a,

6278
03:00:09,201 --> 03:00:10,100
there was a reporter,

6279
03:00:10,580 --> 03:00:13,250
and I could be in this wrong because
I didn't follow it very much with big

6280
03:00:13,251 --> 03:00:14,150
league politics.

6281
03:00:14,630 --> 03:00:18,260
Who said that after reporting on
paypal negatively they banned him.

6282
03:00:19,220 --> 03:00:20,053
That's terrifying.

6283
03:00:20,180 --> 03:00:21,560
So less reporting on it.

6284
03:00:21,561 --> 03:00:22,340
In what way?

6285
03:00:22,340 --> 03:00:23,440
Like reporting on the saga.

6286
03:00:23,540 --> 03:00:24,440
A issue.

6287
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:24,801
No,

6288
03:00:24,801 --> 03:00:25,790
apparently is a journalist.

6289
03:00:25,791 --> 03:00:29,180
He wrote about something bad pay pal did
league politics is conservative and so

6290
03:00:29,181 --> 03:00:31,550
all of a sudden he got a notification
that they can't tell them why,

6291
03:00:31,551 --> 03:00:32,384
but he's gone.

6292
03:00:32,750 --> 03:00:34,190
So I see these big tech monopolies.

6293
03:00:34,191 --> 03:00:34,791
I see youtube,

6294
03:00:34,791 --> 03:00:35,121
Facebook,

6295
03:00:35,121 --> 03:00:35,391
Twitter,

6296
03:00:35,391 --> 03:00:35,961
I see paypal,

6297
03:00:35,961 --> 03:00:39,470
mastercard and they're doing it and they
all say they're doing the right thing.

6298
03:00:39,710 --> 03:00:42,620
But all of these little things they're
doing are adding up to something

6299
03:00:42,621 --> 03:00:46,460
nightmarish and some legislators going
to show up and in a matter of time with a

6300
03:00:46,461 --> 03:00:48,320
sledgehammer and just he's in whack.

6301
03:00:48,321 --> 03:00:48,930
Your Algorithm.

6302
03:00:48,930 --> 03:00:49,081
Well,

6303
03:00:49,081 --> 03:00:51,570
it's really the same stupid logic
where I was talking about were,

6304
03:00:51,750 --> 03:00:53,430
you know Gavin was saying punch people.

6305
03:00:53,431 --> 03:00:54,151
When you punch people,

6306
03:00:54,151 --> 03:00:54,984
it doesn't end there.

6307
03:00:55,140 --> 03:00:55,460
Oh yeah.

6308
03:00:55,460 --> 03:00:57,960
The Punch man banned them
and it doesn't end there.

6309
03:00:58,140 --> 03:00:58,960
It doesn't end there.

6310
03:00:58,960 --> 03:01:00,220
You give to realize also,

6311
03:01:01,040 --> 03:01:01,420
uh,

6312
03:01:01,420 --> 03:01:02,530
Twitter is how old now?

6313
03:01:02,950 --> 03:01:03,701
11 years old.

6314
03:01:03,701 --> 03:01:04,390
12 years old.

6315
03:01:04,390 --> 03:01:04,991
13 years old,

6316
03:01:04,991 --> 03:01:06,010
13 years old.

6317
03:01:06,120 --> 03:01:06,490
Well,

6318
03:01:06,490 --> 03:01:07,271
13 years from now.

6319
03:01:07,271 --> 03:01:08,950
What are the odds that there's
not going to be something else?

6320
03:01:08,951 --> 03:01:09,784
Just like it?

6321
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:10,241
Well,

6322
03:01:10,241 --> 03:01:11,074
pretty slim.

6323
03:01:11,220 --> 03:01:12,053
Uh,

6324
03:01:12,670 --> 03:01:15,490
how we do collect a million,

6325
03:01:15,491 --> 03:01:15,611
no,

6326
03:01:15,611 --> 03:01:15,940
but let's,

6327
03:01:15,940 --> 03:01:16,120
let's,

6328
03:01:16,120 --> 03:01:19,060
let's talk about the
incestuous relationship that
a lot of these journalists

6329
03:01:19,061 --> 03:01:20,860
have been defending the
policies you guys push.

6330
03:01:21,370 --> 03:01:22,420
Gab It was,

6331
03:01:22,421 --> 03:01:22,691
was,

6332
03:01:22,691 --> 03:01:23,231
was a,

6333
03:01:23,231 --> 03:01:24,041
a study was done.

6334
03:01:24,041 --> 03:01:26,560
I talked about this last time where
they found 5% of the tweet of the,

6335
03:01:26,561 --> 03:01:27,101
I don't wanna say tweets,

6336
03:01:27,101 --> 03:01:30,040
but the post on Gab where hate speech
compared to Twitter's like 2.4.

6337
03:01:30,550 --> 03:01:34,000
So it's a marginal increase yet gab
is called the white supremacy network.

6338
03:01:34,150 --> 03:01:35,860
Of course you go on it and yeah,

6339
03:01:35,861 --> 03:01:36,880
absolutely exists.

6340
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:38,290
They say that synagogue shooter.

6341
03:01:38,320 --> 03:01:38,441
Oh,

6342
03:01:38,441 --> 03:01:39,160
he was a gap user.

6343
03:01:39,160 --> 03:01:40,060
He was a Twitter user too.

6344
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,410
He posted on Twitter all the time.

6345
03:01:41,860 --> 03:01:44,260
So why the media is targeting,

6346
03:01:44,440 --> 03:01:44,700
it's,

6347
03:01:44,700 --> 03:01:46,570
it's such a crazy nightmarish reality.

6348
03:01:46,630 --> 03:01:47,780
It is active narrative.

6349
03:01:47,781 --> 03:01:49,210
And when the Guardian,

6350
03:01:49,270 --> 03:01:49,570
uh,

6351
03:01:49,570 --> 03:01:52,630
I believe it was the Daily Mail called
Count Danky law and Nazi hate criminal.

6352
03:01:52,660 --> 03:01:55,600
It's like really made a joke
on youtube and he's being,

6353
03:01:55,601 --> 03:01:56,434
he was arrested.

6354
03:01:56,650 --> 03:01:57,070
Um,

6355
03:01:57,070 --> 03:01:59,260
I thank God every day we have the
first amendment in this country.

6356
03:01:59,470 --> 03:02:02,770
Well there's a cover of a newspaper that
was cause he got a new job somewhere

6357
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:03,071
they get,

6358
03:02:03,071 --> 03:02:04,570
he got fired for that.

6359
03:02:04,600 --> 03:02:05,560
He got kicked off the show.

6360
03:02:05,830 --> 03:02:06,310
Wow.

6361
03:02:06,310 --> 03:02:06,491
Yeah.

6362
03:02:06,491 --> 03:02:06,890
That's so,

6363
03:02:06,890 --> 03:02:08,430
so you have cause of trying again.

6364
03:02:08,980 --> 03:02:09,761
Let me ask you another thing.

6365
03:02:09,761 --> 03:02:10,271
Do you guys,

6366
03:02:10,271 --> 03:02:12,430
do you guys take the advice of
the southern poverty law center?

6367
03:02:14,500 --> 03:02:15,700
Do we take the advice of like,

6368
03:02:15,840 --> 03:02:16,840
so it's,

6369
03:02:16,841 --> 03:02:18,340
it's widely circulated,

6370
03:02:18,370 --> 03:02:19,330
the SPLC lobbies,

6371
03:02:19,331 --> 03:02:21,370
various social platforms
to ban certain people.

6372
03:02:21,640 --> 03:02:22,350
They advise.

6373
03:02:22,350 --> 03:02:22,510
Uh,

6374
03:02:22,510 --> 03:02:23,051
it's an important,

6375
03:02:23,051 --> 03:02:23,884
they advised youtube as,

6376
03:02:23,890 --> 03:02:25,000
as the Anti Defamation League.

6377
03:02:25,300 --> 03:02:27,820
Do you use them in your
decision making process?

6378
03:02:27,850 --> 03:02:28,900
It rule development.

6379
03:02:29,710 --> 03:02:33,880
We're very aware of the flaws with
certain of their research and we're very

6380
03:02:33,881 --> 03:02:35,980
careful about who we take advice from.

6381
03:02:36,070 --> 03:02:37,030
But do you take advice from them?

6382
03:02:37,450 --> 03:02:40,540
I think that they have certainly
reached out to our team members,

6383
03:02:40,541 --> 03:02:42,790
but there's certainly nothing
definitive that we take from them.

6384
03:02:42,910 --> 03:02:43,800
We don't take action.

6385
03:02:43,980 --> 03:02:46,720
You'll never take an action based on
the information received from them.

6386
03:02:47,380 --> 03:02:50,050
The reason I bring that up specifically
is that they're cited often,

6387
03:02:50,350 --> 03:02:50,711
you know,

6388
03:02:50,711 --> 03:02:51,400
in the United States,

6389
03:02:51,400 --> 03:02:54,220
there's other groups like a hope not hate
in the UK and now they're all going to

6390
03:02:54,221 --> 03:02:54,731
point their,

6391
03:02:54,731 --> 03:02:55,090
you know,

6392
03:02:55,090 --> 03:02:56,470
figurative guns at me for saying this.

6393
03:02:56,860 --> 03:02:58,240
But the southern poverty law center,

6394
03:02:58,780 --> 03:02:59,613
uh,

6395
03:02:59,620 --> 03:03:02,470
wrote an article where they claimed I
went to Iran for a Holocaust deniers

6396
03:03:02,471 --> 03:03:03,780
conference and I've never been to Iran.

6397
03:03:03,790 --> 03:03:07,060
And their evidence was this guy found
an archived website from a Holocaust

6398
03:03:07,061 --> 03:03:08,380
denier with my name on it.

6399
03:03:08,381 --> 03:03:09,340
And that was their proof.

6400
03:03:09,850 --> 03:03:11,500
And there are people
who have been labeled,

6401
03:03:11,530 --> 03:03:11,710
you know,

6402
03:03:11,710 --> 03:03:15,250
extremist by this organization
that have been Sam Harris.

6403
03:03:15,820 --> 03:03:16,870
Sam Harris was started with,

6404
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:17,753
yeah,

6405
03:03:17,770 --> 03:03:18,341
I mean it didn't,

6406
03:03:18,341 --> 03:03:21,130
they lose a big lawsuit they settled on.

6407
03:03:21,210 --> 03:03:21,720
Yeah.

6408
03:03:21,720 --> 03:03:21,961
So,

6409
03:03:21,961 --> 03:03:22,481
so again,

6410
03:03:22,481 --> 03:03:22,961
like not,

6411
03:03:22,961 --> 03:03:24,250
not to imply that you guys do use it,

6412
03:03:24,251 --> 03:03:25,990
but I asked specifically
because it's been reported,

6413
03:03:25,991 --> 03:03:27,160
other organizations do.

6414
03:03:27,430 --> 03:03:29,830
So we have activist organizations,

6415
03:03:30,100 --> 03:03:32,160
we have journalists that
I can attest to our APP,

6416
03:03:32,220 --> 03:03:32,981
absolutely activists,

6417
03:03:32,981 --> 03:03:33,760
cause I've worked for,

6418
03:03:33,760 --> 03:03:34,361
I worked for vice,

6419
03:03:34,361 --> 03:03:35,320
I worked for a fusion.

6420
03:03:35,500 --> 03:03:36,160
I was told,

6421
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:36,610
uh,

6422
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:40,840
it implicitly not explicitly to lie
to side with the audience as it were.

6423
03:03:41,230 --> 03:03:45,520
I've seen the narratives they push and
I've had conversations with people that

6424
03:03:45,521 --> 03:03:46,001
I'm not going to,

6425
03:03:46,001 --> 03:03:47,800
I'm going to keep
relatively off the record.

6426
03:03:48,190 --> 03:03:52,060
Journalists who are terrified because
they said the narrative is real.

6427
03:03:52,360 --> 03:03:52,601
Right?

6428
03:03:52,601 --> 03:03:55,060
One journalist in particular
said that he had read,

6429
03:03:55,090 --> 03:03:56,230
he had evidence of,

6430
03:03:56,260 --> 03:03:56,990
you know,

6431
03:03:56,990 --> 03:03:59,970
essentially he had reason to
believe there was a wrongdoing.

6432
03:03:59,990 --> 03:04:00,950
But if he talks about it,

6433
03:04:00,951 --> 03:04:01,880
he could lose his job.

6434
03:04:02,270 --> 03:04:02,741
And there,

6435
03:04:02,741 --> 03:04:05,410
there was a journalist who reported to
me that data and society admitted their

6436
03:04:05,411 --> 03:04:06,060
report was,

6437
03:04:06,060 --> 03:04:06,281
was,

6438
03:04:06,281 --> 03:04:06,770
was,

6439
03:04:06,770 --> 03:04:07,603
was uh,

6440
03:04:08,090 --> 03:04:08,923
incorrect.

6441
03:04:09,110 --> 03:04:13,220
And now you've got organizations lobbying
for terminating Joe and I because of

6442
03:04:13,221 --> 03:04:13,521
this stuff.

6443
03:04:13,521 --> 03:04:14,120
So this,

6444
03:04:14,120 --> 03:04:15,470
this narrative persists.

6445
03:04:15,860 --> 03:04:18,950
Then you see all the actions I mentioned
before and all the organizations saying

6446
03:04:18,951 --> 03:04:19,820
we're doing the right thing.

6447
03:04:20,180 --> 03:04:21,980
And I got to say like we're living in,

6448
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:22,851
I mean,

6449
03:04:22,851 --> 03:04:25,790
I feel like we're looking at the
doorway to the nightmare dystopia of,

6450
03:04:25,800 --> 03:04:26,570
yeah,

6451
03:04:26,570 --> 03:04:27,403
I,

6452
03:04:27,530 --> 03:04:27,830
I,

6453
03:04:27,830 --> 03:04:28,910
I just want to clarify like,

6454
03:04:28,911 --> 03:04:29,120
uh,

6455
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:29,953
I don't,

6456
03:04:30,110 --> 03:04:31,580
I don't know if we're going
around and saying we're,

6457
03:04:31,910 --> 03:04:33,530
we're necessarily doing the right thing.

6458
03:04:33,530 --> 03:04:35,180
We're saying why we're
doing what we're doing.

6459
03:04:35,370 --> 03:04:35,580
Right?

6460
03:04:35,580 --> 03:04:36,050
Right.

6461
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:37,730
That's what we need to get better at.

6462
03:04:37,790 --> 03:04:38,623
And I,

6463
03:04:38,690 --> 03:04:43,690
I don't want to hide behind what
we believe is like the right thing.

6464
03:04:43,971 --> 03:04:48,971
We have to clearly rationalize why we're
making the decision we're making and

6465
03:04:49,101 --> 03:04:49,581
more of that.

6466
03:04:49,581 --> 03:04:50,060
That's,

6467
03:04:50,060 --> 03:04:54,020
that to me is the prevention from
this snowflake avalanche metaphor.

6468
03:04:54,110 --> 03:04:54,261
Well,

6469
03:04:54,261 --> 03:04:54,501
but,

6470
03:04:54,501 --> 03:04:57,680
but I think it's just
obvious to point out,

6471
03:04:57,830 --> 03:04:58,340
again,

6472
03:04:58,340 --> 03:04:58,881
I said this before,

6473
03:04:58,881 --> 03:05:01,040
we can have the calm conversation
and I can understand you,

6474
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:03,110
but for I'm from where I'm sitting,

6475
03:05:03,140 --> 03:05:06,890
you hold a vastly different ideology
than I do and you have substantially more

6476
03:05:06,891 --> 03:05:08,600
power and controlling my government.

6477
03:05:08,900 --> 03:05:09,590
That terrifies me.

6478
03:05:09,590 --> 03:05:10,090
And what's my,

6479
03:05:10,090 --> 03:05:11,670
what makes it worse is
that a Saudi prince,

6480
03:05:12,380 --> 03:05:15,080
as lace was reported that decided
prints owns a portion of that company.

6481
03:05:15,081 --> 03:05:17,240
So I'm sitting here like
just a little American,

6482
03:05:17,570 --> 03:05:18,560
can't do anything to stop it.

6483
03:05:18,800 --> 03:05:22,700
I'm just watching this unaccountable
machine churn away and you're just one

6484
03:05:22,701 --> 03:05:23,600
snowflake in an avalanche.

6485
03:05:23,601 --> 03:05:24,890
All these other companies are as well.

6486
03:05:25,160 --> 03:05:25,611
And I'm like,

6487
03:05:25,611 --> 03:05:26,180
well here we go.

6488
03:05:26,180 --> 03:05:26,841
This is going to be a ride.

6489
03:05:26,841 --> 03:05:27,160
The other ones,

6490
03:05:27,160 --> 03:05:30,140
just as if it just said that Saudi
princes and have any influence,

6491
03:05:30,810 --> 03:05:32,320
but am I supposed to
trust that that's the,

6492
03:05:32,321 --> 03:05:32,841
that's the issue,

6493
03:05:32,841 --> 03:05:33,140
right?

6494
03:05:33,140 --> 03:05:33,400
I'm not,

6495
03:05:33,400 --> 03:05:35,510
I'm not trying to insinuate he showing
up to your meetings and telling you what

6496
03:05:35,511 --> 03:05:35,751
to do,

6497
03:05:35,751 --> 03:05:37,490
but when someone dumps $1
billion a year company,

6498
03:05:38,090 --> 03:05:39,230
I think it's silly to,

6499
03:05:39,290 --> 03:05:41,660
to imply that they don't at
least have some influence.

6500
03:05:41,661 --> 03:05:41,781
But,

6501
03:05:41,781 --> 03:05:42,830
but regardless,

6502
03:05:42,890 --> 03:05:45,320
and unlike the Internet
within a company like ours,

6503
03:05:45,321 --> 03:05:46,700
you don't necessarily see the protocol.

6504
03:05:46,701 --> 03:05:47,290
You don't see the,

6505
03:05:47,290 --> 03:05:47,580
the,

6506
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:48,620
the processes.

6507
03:05:48,621 --> 03:05:48,921
And,

6508
03:05:48,921 --> 03:05:51,070
and that's just an area where
we can do a little much later,

6509
03:05:51,110 --> 03:05:51,943
I guess,

6510
03:05:51,950 --> 03:05:52,783
you know,

6511
03:05:53,450 --> 03:05:54,950
beat it over the head a million times.

6512
03:05:54,950 --> 03:05:55,783
It'd be the dead horse.

6513
03:05:56,390 --> 03:05:57,201
I think ultimately,

6514
03:05:57,201 --> 03:05:57,411
yeah,

6515
03:05:57,411 --> 03:05:58,370
I get what you're doing.

6516
03:05:58,730 --> 03:05:59,570
I think it's wrong.

6517
03:05:59,750 --> 03:06:01,730
I think it's terrifying
and I think we're looking,

6518
03:06:01,760 --> 03:06:02,330
we're slow.

6519
03:06:02,330 --> 03:06:03,170
We're on the avalanche already.

6520
03:06:03,171 --> 03:06:03,710
It's happened.

6521
03:06:03,710 --> 03:06:07,220
And where we're heading down to this
nightmare scenario of the future where it

6522
03:06:07,221 --> 03:06:10,400
terrifies me when I see people who
claim to be supporting liberal ideology,

6523
03:06:10,401 --> 03:06:12,020
burning signs that say free speech,

6524
03:06:12,290 --> 03:06:13,790
threatening violence against other people.

6525
03:06:14,090 --> 03:06:15,770
You have these journalists
who do the same thing.

6526
03:06:15,771 --> 03:06:17,390
They accuse everybody of being a Nazi,

6527
03:06:17,391 --> 03:06:19,100
everybody of being a fascist Joe Rogan,

6528
03:06:19,850 --> 03:06:20,271
and you're like,

6529
03:06:20,271 --> 03:06:21,350
you're like a socialist.

6530
03:06:21,410 --> 03:06:22,280
As far as I know.

6531
03:06:22,281 --> 03:06:23,780
You're like ubi proponent,

6532
03:06:23,810 --> 03:06:24,250
you know?

6533
03:06:24,250 --> 03:06:26,230
I wouldn't necessarily say I'm very,

6534
03:06:26,240 --> 03:06:27,051
I'm being facetious.

6535
03:06:27,051 --> 03:06:29,900
I'm being crazy liberal and
except for second amendment,

6536
03:06:29,930 --> 03:06:32,570
that's probably the only thing that
I disagree with a lot of liberals.

6537
03:06:32,840 --> 03:06:34,600
And then you see what the
media says about everybody.

6538
03:06:34,650 --> 03:06:36,530
You see how they called Jordan
Peterson all day and night.

6539
03:06:36,560 --> 03:06:37,040
Alt right.

6540
03:06:37,040 --> 03:06:37,873
The alt right hates him.

6541
03:06:38,060 --> 03:06:40,580
And this narrative is used to
strip people of their income to,

6542
03:06:40,590 --> 03:06:42,320
to remove them from public discourse.

6543
03:06:42,650 --> 03:06:44,130
And it looks foolish because it,

6544
03:06:44,131 --> 03:06:46,940
it Neil ultimately upon examination,

6545
03:06:46,941 --> 03:06:49,400
like you were saying that
sunlight is the best disinfection.

6546
03:06:49,430 --> 03:06:50,263
Absolutely.

6547
03:06:50,550 --> 03:06:51,700
Upon examination,

6548
03:06:51,710 --> 03:06:55,140
you realize that this is not true at all
and that these people look foolish like

6549
03:06:55,141 --> 03:06:57,060
the date in society article.

6550
03:06:57,090 --> 03:06:57,301
No,

6551
03:06:57,301 --> 03:06:57,620
no.

6552
03:06:57,620 --> 03:07:00,960
I know all these organisations publish
that as fact without looking at any data.

6553
03:07:00,990 --> 03:07:01,890
Maybe some did,

6554
03:07:01,891 --> 03:07:02,724
but anybody,

6555
03:07:03,130 --> 03:07:03,963
but yeah,

6556
03:07:04,040 --> 03:07:04,660
man and no,

6557
03:07:04,660 --> 03:07:04,741
no,

6558
03:07:04,741 --> 03:07:04,831
no,

6559
03:07:04,831 --> 03:07:04,891
no.

6560
03:07:04,891 --> 03:07:07,190
They're still talking about millions
and millions of people who's,

6561
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:08,850
who are these people
that are still siding it?

6562
03:07:08,970 --> 03:07:11,010
Guardian will cleanse the company,

6563
03:07:11,011 --> 03:07:12,240
start yelling shame,

6564
03:07:12,720 --> 03:07:13,141
but so,

6565
03:07:13,141 --> 03:07:13,460
so,

6566
03:07:13,460 --> 03:07:14,400
so look foolish.

6567
03:07:14,520 --> 03:07:15,330
We now have,

6568
03:07:15,330 --> 03:07:15,900
uh,

6569
03:07:15,900 --> 03:07:19,530
and this which makes things muddier as
we now have a guy who's claiming that he

6570
03:07:19,531 --> 03:07:19,970
did an,

6571
03:07:19,970 --> 03:07:20,460
uh,

6572
03:07:20,460 --> 03:07:20,641
this,

6573
03:07:20,641 --> 03:07:21,440
you're gonna love this.

6574
03:07:21,440 --> 03:07:24,960
There's a guy claiming that the 81
accounts listed on this thing as alt right

6575
03:07:25,260 --> 03:07:28,200
have been d are no longer
being recommended on youtube.

6576
03:07:28,950 --> 03:07:30,720
And so I looked at the,

6577
03:07:30,721 --> 03:07:33,180
the statistics for various people on
these channel because first of all,

6578
03:07:33,181 --> 03:07:34,014
my channel is doing great.

6579
03:07:34,110 --> 03:07:35,220
My recommendations are way up,

6580
03:07:35,420 --> 03:07:35,940
uh,

6581
03:07:35,940 --> 03:07:36,720
as our yours.

6582
03:07:36,720 --> 03:07:37,920
A lot of people are growing.

6583
03:07:38,580 --> 03:07:41,230
And I did a comparison
like subscribers are up,

6584
03:07:41,231 --> 03:07:41,671
views are up,

6585
03:07:41,671 --> 03:07:42,570
what's this guy claiming?

6586
03:07:42,900 --> 03:07:47,900
And apparently he did a big sampling of
videos where he for some reason thought

6587
03:07:48,211 --> 03:07:49,560
you Joe Rogan,

6588
03:07:49,590 --> 03:07:52,380
we're 12% of all the
videos in this network.

6589
03:07:52,830 --> 03:07:53,663
And then when the,

6590
03:07:53,690 --> 03:07:54,840
when it's data stopped working,

6591
03:07:54,841 --> 03:07:56,160
he claimed that everything stopped.

6592
03:07:56,161 --> 03:07:59,490
So he actually produced a
graph of primarily you or
your channel and then when

6593
03:07:59,491 --> 03:08:02,850
his system stopped working he published
that and it was picked up by it and now

6594
03:08:02,851 --> 03:08:05,640
you have people claiming the
alt right has been banned from,

6595
03:08:05,641 --> 03:08:06,474
from Youtube.

6596
03:08:06,750 --> 03:08:09,570
And it's more fake news based off
fake news based off fake news.

6597
03:08:09,630 --> 03:08:10,950
I don't understand what you're saying.

6598
03:08:11,010 --> 03:08:11,231
So,

6599
03:08:11,231 --> 03:08:14,370
so basically there's a guy claiming
that because of data and society,

6600
03:08:14,460 --> 03:08:17,550
we have been stripped of recommendations
on Youtube that you just to tell you

6601
03:08:17,551 --> 03:08:18,690
one thing that is true though,

6602
03:08:18,691 --> 03:08:21,660
we don't trend like Alex
Jones was saying like,

6603
03:08:21,661 --> 03:08:21,950
uh,

6604
03:08:21,950 --> 03:08:24,600
the video we did got 9 million views,

6605
03:08:24,601 --> 03:08:25,650
but it's not trending.

6606
03:08:25,890 --> 03:08:26,251
And I said,

6607
03:08:26,251 --> 03:08:26,401
well,

6608
03:08:26,401 --> 03:08:28,110
it's because my videos never trend.

6609
03:08:28,440 --> 03:08:30,310
They just don't trend while you're,

6610
03:08:30,360 --> 03:08:33,180
but I think it's probably because
of the language that's used.

6611
03:08:33,660 --> 03:08:34,590
I think that's,

6612
03:08:34,700 --> 03:08:36,060
that's part of the issue.

6613
03:08:36,061 --> 03:08:37,500
It's the subject matter in language.

6614
03:08:37,501 --> 03:08:39,360
I think they have a,

6615
03:08:39,361 --> 03:08:41,540
they have a bias against swearing and,

6616
03:08:41,541 --> 03:08:42,211
and you know,

6617
03:08:42,211 --> 03:08:44,790
extreme topics and subjects.

6618
03:08:45,610 --> 03:08:49,590
I don't think that's true because you've
had like a late night TV hosts to talk

6619
03:08:49,591 --> 03:08:50,940
about really messed up things.

6620
03:08:50,940 --> 03:08:51,773
They all swear,

6621
03:08:51,900 --> 03:08:52,740
don't swear though.

6622
03:08:52,741 --> 03:08:52,891
The,

6623
03:08:52,891 --> 03:08:53,090
the,

6624
03:08:53,090 --> 03:08:53,790
it's not,

6625
03:08:53,790 --> 03:08:54,900
it's not a matter of,

6626
03:08:55,140 --> 03:08:56,430
and what they talk about,

6627
03:08:56,431 --> 03:08:59,250
whether that's messed up in
comparison to what we talk about,

6628
03:08:59,251 --> 03:09:00,480
it's probably pretty different.

6629
03:09:00,630 --> 03:09:00,991
You know what,

6630
03:09:00,991 --> 03:09:01,590
man,

6631
03:09:01,590 --> 03:09:02,423
I'm a,

6632
03:09:02,460 --> 03:09:05,730
I'm fairly resigned to this future
happening no matter what we do about it.

6633
03:09:06,060 --> 03:09:08,570
And so I bought a van and I'm
going to convert it to us Christ.

6634
03:09:08,630 --> 03:09:08,760
Well,

6635
03:09:08,760 --> 03:09:09,900
I'm coming to a workstation,

6636
03:09:09,901 --> 03:09:10,734
right?

6637
03:09:11,140 --> 03:09:12,660
You're going to be a prepper bro.

6638
03:09:12,760 --> 03:09:12,850
No,

6639
03:09:12,850 --> 03:09:12,950
no,

6640
03:09:12,950 --> 03:09:13,031
no,

6641
03:09:13,031 --> 03:09:13,090
no,

6642
03:09:13,090 --> 03:09:13,161
no,

6643
03:09:13,161 --> 03:09:13,240
no,

6644
03:09:13,240 --> 03:09:13,321
no,

6645
03:09:13,321 --> 03:09:13,380
no,

6646
03:09:13,380 --> 03:09:13,441
no,

6647
03:09:13,441 --> 03:09:13,501
no,

6648
03:09:13,501 --> 03:09:14,334
no.

6649
03:09:14,700 --> 03:09:15,121
First of all,

6650
03:09:15,121 --> 03:09:18,570
I will say it's hilarious to me like
that people have bandaids they never use,

6651
03:09:18,571 --> 03:09:20,850
but they don't store like
at least one emergency,

6652
03:09:20,851 --> 03:09:21,870
like food supply.

6653
03:09:21,871 --> 03:09:23,300
It's like you never use band aids.

6654
03:09:23,310 --> 03:09:24,143
Why do you have them?

6655
03:09:24,300 --> 03:09:24,660
But,

6656
03:09:24,660 --> 03:09:25,350
uh,

6657
03:09:25,350 --> 03:09:25,600
no.

6658
03:09:25,600 --> 03:09:25,841
I,

6659
03:09:25,841 --> 03:09:26,341
I do.

6660
03:09:26,341 --> 03:09:26,431
I,

6661
03:09:26,431 --> 03:09:27,480
I see this every day.

6662
03:09:27,510 --> 03:09:28,410
It was a couple of years ago,

6663
03:09:28,411 --> 03:09:28,681
I said,

6664
03:09:28,681 --> 03:09:28,951
wow,

6665
03:09:28,951 --> 03:09:30,210
I see what's happening on social media.

6666
03:09:30,211 --> 03:09:30,931
We're going to see violence.

6667
03:09:30,931 --> 03:09:31,140
Boom,

6668
03:09:31,140 --> 03:09:31,710
violence happened.

6669
03:09:31,710 --> 03:09:31,950
I said,

6670
03:09:31,950 --> 03:09:32,041
oh,

6671
03:09:32,041 --> 03:09:32,641
it's going to escalate.

6672
03:09:32,641 --> 03:09:33,131
Someone's gonna kill.

6673
03:09:33,131 --> 03:09:33,311
Boom.

6674
03:09:33,311 --> 03:09:35,040
Charlottesville happened and it's like,

6675
03:09:35,190 --> 03:09:35,401
I,

6676
03:09:35,401 --> 03:09:36,130
I've,

6677
03:09:36,130 --> 03:09:39,300
there have been statements
from foreign security advisors,

6678
03:09:39,301 --> 03:09:42,240
international security experts saying
we're facing down high probability of

6679
03:09:42,241 --> 03:09:42,780
civil war.

6680
03:09:42,780 --> 03:09:44,010
And I know it sounds crazy.

6681
03:09:44,280 --> 03:09:45,960
It's not going to look like
what you think it looks like.

6682
03:09:46,170 --> 03:09:49,050
It may not be as extreme as it
wasn't 18 hundreds but this was,

6683
03:09:49,051 --> 03:09:49,410
I think,

6684
03:09:49,410 --> 03:09:52,800
I think it was in the Atlantic where
they surveyed something like 10 different

6685
03:09:53,020 --> 03:09:54,250
international security

6686
03:09:54,250 --> 03:09:54,941
experts who said,

6687
03:09:54,941 --> 03:09:58,270
based on what the platforms are doing
based on how the people are responding.

6688
03:09:58,790 --> 03:10:00,640
One Guy said it was like 90% chance,

6689
03:10:00,641 --> 03:10:02,010
but the average was really high.

6690
03:10:02,050 --> 03:10:02,351
Well,

6691
03:10:02,351 --> 03:10:03,040
let's,

6692
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:07,030
let's look outside of the idea of
physical war and let's look at the war of

6693
03:10:07,031 --> 03:10:07,691
information.

6694
03:10:07,691 --> 03:10:08,501
What we're talking about,

6695
03:10:08,501 --> 03:10:13,501
what's happening with foreign entities
invading social media platforms and

6696
03:10:13,751 --> 03:10:16,630
trying to influence our
elections and our democracy.

6697
03:10:16,631 --> 03:10:17,980
That is a war of information.

6698
03:10:18,430 --> 03:10:18,971
That is,

6699
03:10:18,971 --> 03:10:20,980
that war is already going on.

6700
03:10:20,981 --> 03:10:22,930
If you're looking at something
like data and society,

6701
03:10:22,931 --> 03:10:25,360
that's sort of an act
of war in that regard,

6702
03:10:25,600 --> 03:10:25,751
right?

6703
03:10:25,751 --> 03:10:26,040
It's a,

6704
03:10:26,040 --> 03:10:27,660
it's an information war.

6705
03:10:27,700 --> 03:10:28,560
An attempt to,

6706
03:10:28,660 --> 03:10:29,680
to lie to people,

6707
03:10:29,740 --> 03:10:30,660
to step out there,

6708
03:10:30,661 --> 03:10:33,640
there their ideological opponents and
it's also one of the woman who wrote that

6709
03:10:33,641 --> 03:10:35,500
said that it's been proven
over and over again.

6710
03:10:35,501 --> 03:10:39,220
The D platforming is an effective way
to silence and then called for us to be

6711
03:10:39,230 --> 03:10:40,063
men.

6712
03:10:40,080 --> 03:10:40,871
It's kind of hilarious.

6713
03:10:40,871 --> 03:10:42,400
I don't think she was saying
that we should be banned.

6714
03:10:42,710 --> 03:10:43,301
I don't think she said,

6715
03:10:43,301 --> 03:10:44,050
well she should be.

6716
03:10:44,050 --> 03:10:46,780
She said something to the effect of
Youtube has to take action to prevent this

6717
03:10:46,781 --> 03:10:47,170
from,

6718
03:10:47,170 --> 03:10:47,680
you know,

6719
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:48,191
well you know,

6720
03:10:48,191 --> 03:10:51,100
but people see someone saying
things that they don't agree with.

6721
03:10:51,130 --> 03:10:55,840
It's very important for
people to understand where
silencing people leads to.

6722
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:57,100
And I don't think they do.

6723
03:10:57,101 --> 03:11:00,520
I think people have these very
simplistic ideologies and these very,

6724
03:11:00,850 --> 03:11:04,630
very narrow minded perceptions of
what is good and what is wrong.

6725
03:11:04,660 --> 03:11:05,500
And I think,

6726
03:11:05,860 --> 03:11:07,600
and I've been saying
this over and over again,

6727
03:11:07,601 --> 03:11:09,880
but I think it's one of the
most important things to state.

6728
03:11:10,240 --> 03:11:13,120
People need to learn to be reasonable.

6729
03:11:13,420 --> 03:11:16,300
They need to be learned to be
reasonable and civil discourse.

6730
03:11:16,301 --> 03:11:17,280
Civil discourses.

6731
03:11:17,380 --> 03:11:18,610
It's extremely important.

6732
03:11:18,611 --> 03:11:19,650
And think over the long term.

6733
03:11:19,750 --> 03:11:20,230
Yes.

6734
03:11:20,230 --> 03:11:21,670
They go to the locker and understand it.

6735
03:11:21,671 --> 03:11:22,600
You're playing chess.

6736
03:11:23,380 --> 03:11:24,030
Yeah.

6737
03:11:24,030 --> 03:11:24,450
Um,

6738
03:11:24,450 --> 03:11:28,030
we did three hours and 30
minutes then when nobody had a p.

6739
03:11:28,390 --> 03:11:28,930
Amazing.

6740
03:11:28,930 --> 03:11:29,830
I'm proud of all of you.

6741
03:11:33,010 --> 03:11:33,970
We did start a little late.

6742
03:11:34,060 --> 03:11:34,330
Yeah,

6743
03:11:34,330 --> 03:11:35,260
like three 15.

6744
03:11:35,500 --> 03:11:36,130
Okay.

6745
03:11:36,130 --> 03:11:36,963
I mean,

6746
03:11:36,970 --> 03:11:38,740
I guess the last thing I
can say is I don't think,

6747
03:11:39,130 --> 03:11:40,210
I think we had a good conversation.

6748
03:11:40,270 --> 03:11:40,850
I think we did.

6749
03:11:40,850 --> 03:11:41,681
I honestly,

6750
03:11:41,681 --> 03:11:42,850
I don't think we felt anything.

6751
03:11:42,880 --> 03:11:43,420
I don't think there's many,

6752
03:11:43,420 --> 03:11:43,930
if any,

6753
03:11:43,930 --> 03:11:45,190
do you think we could do this again,

6754
03:11:45,191 --> 03:11:48,250
like six months and see where you guys
are at in terms of like what I think is

6755
03:11:48,251 --> 03:11:49,690
important is the road to redemption.

6756
03:11:49,691 --> 03:11:53,140
I think that would open up a lot of doors
for a lot of people to appreciate you.

6757
03:11:53,170 --> 03:11:54,310
We're going to need more than six months,

6758
03:11:54,311 --> 03:11:55,144
just

6759
03:11:56,010 --> 03:11:56,843
do it.

6760
03:11:57,480 --> 03:11:58,330
Here's the scary thing.

6761
03:11:58,530 --> 03:12:00,700
The information travels
faster than you can,

6762
03:12:01,000 --> 03:12:01,610
right?

6763
03:12:01,610 --> 03:12:02,560
That's the point I was making,

6764
03:12:02,890 --> 03:12:06,850
that our culture is going to evolve faster
than you can catch up to that problem

6765
03:12:06,880 --> 03:12:09,430
because there's a problem and I don't,

6766
03:12:09,630 --> 03:12:10,090
wow.

6767
03:12:10,090 --> 03:12:10,300
You know,

6768
03:12:10,300 --> 03:12:11,440
technology took a big leap.

6769
03:12:11,680 --> 03:12:12,281
Twitter existed,

6770
03:12:12,281 --> 03:12:12,850
the Internet existed.

6771
03:12:12,850 --> 03:12:13,960
Now we're all talking so quickly.

6772
03:12:14,590 --> 03:12:16,180
You can't actually solve
the problem before that.

6773
03:12:16,181 --> 03:12:17,080
People get outraged by it.

6774
03:12:17,760 --> 03:12:18,420
So no,

6775
03:12:18,420 --> 03:12:18,630
I,

6776
03:12:18,630 --> 03:12:19,041
I could,

6777
03:12:19,041 --> 03:12:23,980
I mean there was an early phrase on the
Internet by some of the earliest and

6778
03:12:24,050 --> 03:12:25,910
Internet engineers and designers,

6779
03:12:25,940 --> 03:12:29,480
which is code is law and a lot of,

6780
03:12:29,510 --> 03:12:34,510
a lot of what companies like ours
and startups and random folks who are

6781
03:12:36,741 --> 03:12:41,741
individuals who are contributing to the
Internet will change parts of society in

6782
03:12:41,871 --> 03:12:45,950
some for the positive and some
for the negative and the most,

6783
03:12:46,370 --> 03:12:49,220
I think the most important
thing that we need to do is to,

6784
03:12:50,720 --> 03:12:51,470
as we just said,

6785
03:12:51,470 --> 03:12:51,831
shine.

6786
03:12:51,831 --> 03:12:53,300
I'll punch your light on it,

6787
03:12:53,450 --> 03:12:58,070
make sure that people know where we stand
and where we're trying to go and what

6788
03:12:58,071 --> 03:13:01,920
bridges we might need to build from our
current state to the future state and,

6789
03:13:02,470 --> 03:13:03,170
and,

6790
03:13:03,170 --> 03:13:06,230
and be open about the fact
that like we're not going to,

6791
03:13:06,510 --> 03:13:09,030
and this is do your other point.

6792
03:13:09,110 --> 03:13:12,190
We're not going to get to a
perfect answer here like it,

6793
03:13:12,210 --> 03:13:12,500
it's,

6794
03:13:12,500 --> 03:13:16,730
it's just going to be steps and steps
and steps and steps and the fee.

6795
03:13:16,820 --> 03:13:18,410
What we need to build is agility.

6796
03:13:18,470 --> 03:13:21,470
What we need to build is an
ability to experiment very,

6797
03:13:21,471 --> 03:13:26,420
very quickly and take in all these
feedback loops that we get some feedback

6798
03:13:26,510 --> 03:13:27,530
loops like this,

6799
03:13:27,531 --> 03:13:28,280
um,

6800
03:13:28,280 --> 03:13:31,100
within the numbers itself and
then integrate that much faster.

6801
03:13:31,250 --> 03:13:32,000
What's wrong with the,

6802
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:33,830
with the Geri system on Twitter?

6803
03:13:33,860 --> 03:13:34,693
Why wouldn't that work?

6804
03:13:35,120 --> 03:13:36,530
I don't know why I want to work on,

6805
03:13:36,531 --> 03:13:37,910
I'm not saying we want to test that.

6806
03:13:38,290 --> 03:13:39,800
Like we're testing the periscope and,

6807
03:13:39,890 --> 03:13:40,310
and,

6808
03:13:40,310 --> 03:13:41,750
and I don't have a reason,

6809
03:13:41,751 --> 03:13:44,330
a compelling reason why we want
to do it within Twitter either.

6810
03:13:44,331 --> 03:13:44,580
I,

6811
03:13:44,580 --> 03:13:45,380
I don't,

6812
03:13:45,380 --> 03:13:46,520
so we likely will,

6813
03:13:46,521 --> 03:13:47,720
but you know,

6814
03:13:48,110 --> 03:13:48,411
again,

6815
03:13:48,411 --> 03:13:50,720
we were a company of so many resources,

6816
03:13:50,750 --> 03:13:51,650
finite resources,

6817
03:13:51,651 --> 03:13:52,380
finite people,

6818
03:13:52,380 --> 03:13:57,020
and we need to prioritize
and we've decided you may
disagree with this decision,

6819
03:13:57,021 --> 03:14:01,340
but we've decided that physical safety
and the admission of off-platform

6820
03:14:01,550 --> 03:14:02,390
ramifications,

6821
03:14:03,120 --> 03:14:03,411
uh,

6822
03:14:03,411 --> 03:14:04,760
is critical for us.

6823
03:14:04,790 --> 03:14:09,080
And we need to be able to be a lot
more proactive in our enforcement,

6824
03:14:09,640 --> 03:14:09,830
uh,

6825
03:14:09,830 --> 03:14:12,440
which will lead to stronger answers.

6826
03:14:12,500 --> 03:14:13,380
And we want,

6827
03:14:13,430 --> 03:14:15,380
we want to focus on the
physical safety aspect.

6828
03:14:15,381 --> 03:14:19,700
And doxing is a perfect example that
has patterns that are recognizable.

6829
03:14:19,701 --> 03:14:20,534
And then we can move on.

6830
03:14:20,650 --> 03:14:20,900
I,

6831
03:14:20,900 --> 03:14:23,450
I hear it and I just feel like,

6832
03:14:23,930 --> 03:14:24,320
you know,

6833
03:14:24,320 --> 03:14:27,230
the conclusion I can come
from the conversation is
you're going to do what you

6834
03:14:27,231 --> 03:14:28,100
think needs to be done.

6835
03:14:28,220 --> 03:14:30,950
I think what you're doing is wrong and
ultimately nothing's going to change.

6836
03:14:31,490 --> 03:14:31,851
I got it.

6837
03:14:31,851 --> 03:14:32,121
You're going to,

6838
03:14:32,121 --> 03:14:33,200
you're going to try new technologies.

6839
03:14:33,230 --> 03:14:35,120
You're going to try and
do it systems from the,

6840
03:14:35,121 --> 03:14:36,020
from where I see it,

6841
03:14:36,080 --> 03:14:40,250
I think you have an ideology
diametrically opposed to mine.

6842
03:14:40,400 --> 03:14:40,581
I mean,

6843
03:14:40,581 --> 03:14:41,331
not to an extreme degree.

6844
03:14:41,331 --> 03:14:42,680
I think there are people
who are more like,

6845
03:14:42,740 --> 03:14:43,700
I'm not conservative.

6846
03:14:44,120 --> 03:14:44,990
There are a lot of people who are,

6847
03:14:44,991 --> 03:14:46,010
who are probably think,

6848
03:14:46,160 --> 03:14:46,431
you know,

6849
03:14:46,431 --> 03:14:46,571
I'll,

6850
03:14:46,571 --> 03:14:47,100
I'll say this too.

6851
03:14:47,100 --> 03:14:50,120
You're a symbol for a lot of them and
so I can definitely respect you having a

6852
03:14:50,121 --> 03:14:50,954
conversation.

6853
03:14:51,170 --> 03:14:53,780
There are so many different companies
that do things that piss people off.

6854
03:14:54,260 --> 03:14:55,130
You sitting here right now,

6855
03:14:55,131 --> 03:14:58,040
I'm sure there's a ton of conservatives
who are you pointing all of their anger

6856
03:14:58,041 --> 03:14:59,810
and you because you are here,

6857
03:15:00,470 --> 03:15:00,951
but you know,

6858
03:15:00,951 --> 03:15:02,330
ultimately I just feel like,

6859
03:15:03,470 --> 03:15:04,640
I don't think anything's going to change.

6860
03:15:04,760 --> 03:15:05,600
I think you're on your path,

6861
03:15:05,601 --> 03:15:08,870
you know what you need to do and you're
trying to justify it and I'm looking at

6862
03:15:08,871 --> 03:15:12,110
what Twitter is doing
as very wrong and it's,

6863
03:15:12,130 --> 03:15:12,411
it's,

6864
03:15:12,411 --> 03:15:13,120
it's uh,

6865
03:15:13,120 --> 03:15:16,910
oppressive and ideologically driven and
I'm trying to justify why you shouldn't

6866
03:15:16,911 --> 03:15:17,181
do it,

6867
03:15:17,181 --> 03:15:18,014
but nothing's going to change

6868
03:15:18,170 --> 03:15:18,950
mine.

6869
03:15:18,950 --> 03:15:23,950
My intention is to build a platform
that gives as many people as possible

6870
03:15:24,171 --> 03:15:25,730
opportunity to freely express themselves

6871
03:15:25,770 --> 03:15:28,500
and some people believe the United States
has already done that and Twitter is

6872
03:15:28,501 --> 03:15:30,920
now going against what the u s has
developed over hundreds of years.

6873
03:15:31,360 --> 03:15:33,570
This is called have a platform.

6874
03:15:33,660 --> 03:15:36,030
I mean the United States doesn't
have a platform to do that.

6875
03:15:36,031 --> 03:15:38,190
Twitter is when you're
talking about the Internet,

6876
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:38,940
the United States,

6877
03:15:38,940 --> 03:15:41,790
if they want to come up with
the United States Twitter,

6878
03:15:42,030 --> 03:15:42,301
like a,

6879
03:15:42,301 --> 03:15:46,020
a solution on alternative that the
government runs and they use it,

6880
03:15:46,050 --> 03:15:47,760
use free speech to govern that.

6881
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:48,833
Good luck.

6882
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:50,100
Good luck with that.

6883
03:15:50,380 --> 03:15:50,790
Well,

6884
03:15:50,790 --> 03:15:53,150
it's a h institutes challenge
and also I recognize not just,

6885
03:15:53,151 --> 03:15:53,700
you know,

6886
03:15:53,700 --> 03:15:54,870
almost insurmountable.

6887
03:15:55,110 --> 03:15:59,400
I mean the have the dummies that are in
charge of the United States government.

6888
03:15:59,520 --> 03:16:01,380
This is why I said regulation to is scary.

6889
03:16:01,540 --> 03:16:02,373
Yeah,

6890
03:16:02,930 --> 03:16:04,170
that's a terrible idea.

6891
03:16:04,230 --> 03:16:04,680
But so,

6892
03:16:04,680 --> 03:16:05,401
but you know,

6893
03:16:05,401 --> 03:16:05,581
and I,

6894
03:16:05,581 --> 03:16:08,670
I think it's important to point out
too that a lot of people don't realize,

6895
03:16:09,390 --> 03:16:10,830
you guys have to contend with profits.

6896
03:16:10,831 --> 03:16:12,510
You have to be able to make
money to pay your staff.

6897
03:16:12,540 --> 03:16:13,050
There's no,

6898
03:16:13,050 --> 03:16:14,640
like you don't get free
money to run your company.

6899
03:16:14,641 --> 03:16:19,080
So aside from the fact that you have
advertisers want to be in the platform,

6900
03:16:19,470 --> 03:16:22,680
I imagine a lot of these companies are
enforcing hate speech policies because

6901
03:16:22,681 --> 03:16:24,720
advertisers don't want to be
associated with certain things.

6902
03:16:25,020 --> 03:16:26,010
So that creates,

6903
03:16:26,040 --> 03:16:26,251
you know,

6904
03:16:26,251 --> 03:16:27,210
through advertisement,

6905
03:16:27,240 --> 03:16:28,380
cultural restrictions.

6906
03:16:28,381 --> 03:16:29,700
That's 100% of the problem,

6907
03:16:29,730 --> 03:16:29,891
right.

6908
03:16:29,891 --> 03:16:32,520
At 100% of the problem with most of
these platforms including youtube.

6909
03:16:32,610 --> 03:16:33,150
Absolutely.

6910
03:16:33,150 --> 03:16:33,331
Yeah.

6911
03:16:33,331 --> 03:16:36,360
I mean when the PD pie thing
happened and all of these,

6912
03:16:36,361 --> 03:16:36,640
uh,

6913
03:16:36,640 --> 03:16:37,020
you know,

6914
03:16:37,020 --> 03:16:38,340
restrictions came down on,

6915
03:16:38,610 --> 03:16:41,070
on advertising and content creators,

6916
03:16:41,071 --> 03:16:41,910
that's where it comes from.

6917
03:16:41,911 --> 03:16:42,750
It all comes from,

6918
03:16:42,810 --> 03:16:43,470
from money.

6919
03:16:43,470 --> 03:16:44,041
It's why,

6920
03:16:44,041 --> 03:16:44,460
uh,

6921
03:16:44,460 --> 03:16:45,240
I'll let those good,

6922
03:16:45,240 --> 03:16:45,871
just to be clear,

6923
03:16:45,871 --> 03:16:47,580
those can be segmented as well.

6924
03:16:47,650 --> 03:16:48,810
Second to advertisers,

6925
03:16:48,870 --> 03:16:51,120
advertisers can choose where they went to,

6926
03:16:51,300 --> 03:16:52,440
where they want to be placed,

6927
03:16:52,470 --> 03:16:53,010
certainly.

6928
03:16:53,010 --> 03:16:57,660
But the platform recognizes that there's
a huge blow back and they're losing

6929
03:16:57,661 --> 03:16:58,040
money.

6930
03:16:58,040 --> 03:16:58,710
I mean,

6931
03:16:58,710 --> 03:16:59,451
look at the,

6932
03:16:59,451 --> 03:16:59,651
the,

6933
03:16:59,651 --> 03:17:00,301
the peto scandal.

6934
03:17:00,301 --> 03:17:01,230
It just happened on Youtube.

6935
03:17:01,320 --> 03:17:03,300
It was people posting
comments with timestamps.

6936
03:17:03,301 --> 03:17:06,270
They weren't even breaking the rules
and advertisers pull up the platform and

6937
03:17:06,271 --> 03:17:08,520
youtube didn't realize because
they weren't breaking the rules,

6938
03:17:08,521 --> 03:17:09,450
they just creepy dudes.

6939
03:17:09,990 --> 03:17:11,850
So maybe people also,

6940
03:17:12,150 --> 03:17:15,960
there were putting comments and so one
of the most preposterous responses to

6941
03:17:15,961 --> 03:17:20,310
that was that content creators are going
to be responsible for their comments.

6942
03:17:20,430 --> 03:17:20,611
Well,

6943
03:17:20,611 --> 03:17:21,450
they've just turned them off.

6944
03:17:21,930 --> 03:17:22,763
Well,

6945
03:17:23,340 --> 03:17:27,300
the problem with the sledgehammer hammer
like me is that I put out a lot of

6946
03:17:27,301 --> 03:17:32,301
content and there's millions of views
and it's impossible to moderate all the

6947
03:17:32,700 --> 03:17:34,650
comments and we don't
moderate them at all.

6948
03:17:34,680 --> 03:17:34,810
Right.

6949
03:17:34,810 --> 03:17:36,840
About Youtube band only
on videos with minors.

6950
03:17:37,440 --> 03:17:39,120
So they deleted all comments,

6951
03:17:39,510 --> 03:17:41,830
videos with mine videos
where they say youth,

6952
03:17:42,030 --> 03:17:42,930
but you know what I'm saying?

6953
03:17:42,931 --> 03:17:44,420
If you put a youtube video on,

6954
03:17:44,440 --> 03:17:47,550
you have a bunch of people that say a
bunch of racist things and your youtube

6955
03:17:47,551 --> 03:17:48,210
comments,

6956
03:17:48,210 --> 03:17:50,220
you could be held
responsible and get a fuck.

6957
03:17:50,380 --> 03:17:50,540
No,

6958
03:17:50,540 --> 03:17:50,611
no,

6959
03:17:50,611 --> 03:17:50,661
no,

6960
03:17:50,661 --> 03:17:50,721
no,

6961
03:17:50,721 --> 03:17:50,771
no,

6962
03:17:50,771 --> 03:17:50,910
no.

6963
03:17:50,910 --> 03:17:51,840
You clarified that.

6964
03:17:51,900 --> 03:17:54,030
They clarified that one recently.

6965
03:17:54,060 --> 03:17:54,960
They said that people words,

6966
03:17:54,990 --> 03:17:58,200
but the first initial statement was that
you were going to responsible for your

6967
03:17:58,201 --> 03:18:01,500
comments and then they said it's
only Michael like Philip to Franco.

6968
03:18:01,500 --> 03:18:03,910
And a lot of people freaked
out and then they qualify then.

6969
03:18:04,090 --> 03:18:07,560
But so the reason I bring that up is
just because there's going to be things

6970
03:18:07,561 --> 03:18:10,530
that even if you segment
your advertisers from you,

6971
03:18:10,531 --> 03:18:10,860
look,

6972
03:18:10,860 --> 03:18:11,251
you know,

6973
03:18:11,251 --> 03:18:11,351
I,

6974
03:18:11,351 --> 03:18:11,971
I pointed out,

6975
03:18:11,971 --> 03:18:15,990
I think the Democrats are in a really
dangerous position because outrage

6976
03:18:15,991 --> 03:18:16,650
culture,

6977
03:18:16,650 --> 03:18:18,420
although it exists in all factions,

6978
03:18:18,720 --> 03:18:20,880
is predominantly on one faction.

6979
03:18:21,270 --> 03:18:24,510
And so when Trump comes out and
says something really offensive,

6980
03:18:24,540 --> 03:18:24,721
you know,

6981
03:18:24,721 --> 03:18:25,560
grab 'em by the,

6982
03:18:25,590 --> 03:18:26,423
you know what I'm talking about?

6983
03:18:26,670 --> 03:18:27,600
The Trump supporters laugh.

6984
03:18:27,630 --> 03:18:28,740
They bought tee shirts that said it,

6985
03:18:29,250 --> 03:18:29,971
the people on the left,

6986
03:18:29,971 --> 03:18:30,721
the Democrat types,

6987
03:18:30,721 --> 03:18:31,554
they got angry.

6988
03:18:31,620 --> 03:18:33,330
So what happens now
you see Bernie Sanders,

6989
03:18:33,331 --> 03:18:34,164
he's being dragged.

6990
03:18:34,260 --> 03:18:36,720
The media is looking for
blood and they're desperate.

6991
03:18:36,780 --> 03:18:37,770
They're laying people off,

6992
03:18:37,830 --> 03:18:40,500
they're dying and they will do
whatever it takes to get those clicks.

6993
03:18:40,800 --> 03:18:41,670
I there was an like,

6994
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:43,170
you know is I have to
do with Twitter though.

6995
03:18:43,530 --> 03:18:45,960
It has to do with the fact that
someone's going to find something on your

6996
03:18:45,961 --> 03:18:48,340
platform and they're going to
call your advertiser and say,

6997
03:18:48,430 --> 03:18:49,300
look what Twitter is doing.

6998
03:18:49,301 --> 03:18:49,871
And you're going to be like,

6999
03:18:49,871 --> 03:18:49,961
oh,

7000
03:18:49,961 --> 03:18:50,471
we had no idea.

7001
03:18:50,471 --> 03:18:51,940
And then too bad and canceled all ads.

7002
03:18:51,970 --> 03:18:52,803
Your money's dried up.

7003
03:18:53,110 --> 03:18:55,630
And so the reason I bring that
up is I recognize Twitter.

7004
03:18:55,631 --> 03:18:55,931
Youtube,

7005
03:18:55,931 --> 03:18:56,321
Facebook is,

7006
03:18:56,321 --> 03:18:58,330
other platforms are worried.

7007
03:18:58,570 --> 03:19:00,370
Money has to come from
somewhere to pay people.

7008
03:19:00,670 --> 03:19:04,330
So you also have to realize you've got
the press that's salivating looking for

7009
03:19:04,331 --> 03:19:06,730
that juicy story where they can accuse
you of wrongdoing because it'll get them

7010
03:19:06,731 --> 03:19:07,180
clicks,

7011
03:19:07,180 --> 03:19:08,013
they'll make money.

7012
03:19:08,260 --> 03:19:11,710
And that means even though Youtube
did nothing wrong with these comments,

7013
03:19:11,740 --> 03:19:13,870
it was just a creepy group of
people who didn't break the rules,

7014
03:19:13,871 --> 03:19:15,160
who figured out how to
manipulate the system.

7015
03:19:15,190 --> 03:19:17,680
Youtube eight like you
had had to take the,

7016
03:19:17,710 --> 03:19:18,360
take that one.

7017
03:19:18,360 --> 03:19:19,870
The advertisers pulled
out youtube lost money,

7018
03:19:20,350 --> 03:19:22,840
so you did then panics
sledgehammers comments.

7019
03:19:23,290 --> 03:19:26,200
Just wipe them out that
that can happen to anybody.

7020
03:19:26,290 --> 03:19:26,531
Right.

7021
03:19:26,531 --> 03:19:27,880
We're in a really dangerous time.

7022
03:19:28,050 --> 03:19:28,210
Oh.

7023
03:19:28,210 --> 03:19:29,490
Also in their defense though,

7024
03:19:29,491 --> 03:19:30,630
they have to deal with that.

7025
03:19:30,631 --> 03:19:33,150
I mean they have a bunch of
pedophiles that are posting comments.

7026
03:19:33,280 --> 03:19:33,430
No,

7027
03:19:33,430 --> 03:19:33,750
for sure.

7028
03:19:33,750 --> 03:19:35,610
I mean what do you do about that?

7029
03:19:35,611 --> 03:19:38,700
What do you know what other than higher
millions of people to moderate every

7030
03:19:38,701 --> 03:19:40,590
single video that's put on Youtube,

7031
03:19:40,591 --> 03:19:42,030
which is almost impossible.

7032
03:19:42,080 --> 03:19:47,080
The point I'm trying to break bring up
is that even if Twitter want it to say,

7033
03:19:47,151 --> 03:19:47,451
you know what,

7034
03:19:47,451 --> 03:19:48,350
we're going to have free speech.

7035
03:19:48,380 --> 03:19:49,070
What happens?

7036
03:19:49,070 --> 03:19:50,030
Advertisers rock later.

7037
03:19:50,240 --> 03:19:51,140
Even if you segment it,

7038
03:19:51,170 --> 03:19:53,350
they're going to be threatened to buy
it and so the restrictions are going to

7039
03:19:53,360 --> 03:19:54,800
come from whether or not
you can make money doing it.

7040
03:19:55,060 --> 03:19:56,050
I don't know about that.

7041
03:19:56,051 --> 03:19:56,710
I don't know.

7042
03:19:56,710 --> 03:20:00,550
I think that that is changing and I think
that is changing primarily because of

7043
03:20:00,551 --> 03:20:01,270
the Internet.

7044
03:20:01,270 --> 03:20:06,270
If you look at what was acceptable in
terms of people discussing that would get

7045
03:20:07,121 --> 03:20:07,960
advertisement.

7046
03:20:08,020 --> 03:20:10,210
It was network television standards.

7047
03:20:10,510 --> 03:20:11,740
Now that's changing.

7048
03:20:11,770 --> 03:20:12,220
I mean there's,

7049
03:20:12,220 --> 03:20:12,880
there's going to be,

7050
03:20:12,880 --> 03:20:16,420
there's ads on a lot of the videos
that I put out that have pretty extreme

7051
03:20:16,421 --> 03:20:17,170
content.

7052
03:20:17,170 --> 03:20:19,690
It's because advertisers are
changing their perspective.

7053
03:20:20,530 --> 03:20:21,363
I don't think so.

7054
03:20:21,520 --> 03:20:22,990
They're shifting their
hundred percent shifting.

7055
03:20:22,991 --> 03:20:23,740
That's why this,

7056
03:20:23,740 --> 03:20:25,180
this podcast has ads.

7057
03:20:25,480 --> 03:20:25,751
Sure,

7058
03:20:25,751 --> 03:20:26,170
sure.

7059
03:20:26,170 --> 03:20:26,561
I mean,

7060
03:20:26,561 --> 03:20:28,750
I don't think it's to the point
where everyone's lost all ads,

7061
03:20:28,751 --> 03:20:29,291
but I look,

7062
03:20:29,291 --> 03:20:31,240
you think George Carlan will
be allowed to do his bit today?

7063
03:20:31,320 --> 03:20:32,020
Yes.

7064
03:20:32,020 --> 03:20:32,580
No,

7065
03:20:32,580 --> 03:20:32,851
no.

7066
03:20:32,851 --> 03:20:33,640
Come on man.

7067
03:20:33,640 --> 03:20:34,320
Not Right.

7068
03:20:34,320 --> 03:20:35,220
He would be able to do it.

7069
03:20:35,430 --> 03:20:35,820
Listen,

7070
03:20:35,820 --> 03:20:39,120
there's stuff like that on Netflix
specials that are out right now.

7071
03:20:39,300 --> 03:20:40,290
Things are changing.

7072
03:20:40,530 --> 03:20:45,510
It's just in the process of
this transformation where
people are understanding

7073
03:20:45,511 --> 03:20:47,130
that because of the Internet first,

7074
03:20:47,550 --> 03:20:49,710
if you look at late night conversations,

7075
03:20:49,950 --> 03:20:54,950
how about j Cole Bear saying
that President Trump has
Putin's dick in his mouth.

7076
03:20:56,220 --> 03:20:57,630
How about him saying that on television?

7077
03:20:57,750 --> 03:21:00,090
Do you really think that would
have been done 10 years ago?

7078
03:21:00,570 --> 03:21:03,540
It wouldn't have been or 15
years ago or 20 impossible.

7079
03:21:03,630 --> 03:21:04,360
Not Possible.

7080
03:21:04,360 --> 03:21:06,540
[inaudible] standards are
changing because of the Internet,

7081
03:21:06,630 --> 03:21:11,010
so things that were impossible
to say on network television.

7082
03:21:11,130 --> 03:21:12,000
Just 10 years ago.

7083
03:21:12,001 --> 03:21:12,190
You,

7084
03:21:12,190 --> 03:21:12,630
Kevin,

7085
03:21:12,630 --> 03:21:12,901
Kevin,

7086
03:21:12,901 --> 03:21:17,310
Kevin Hart lost his Oscar hosting
Gig because of Gi loss 10 years ago,

7087
03:21:17,640 --> 03:21:18,810
but do you know why he lost?

7088
03:21:18,811 --> 03:21:20,310
He lost it because
people were complaining,

7089
03:21:20,430 --> 03:21:20,671
right?

7090
03:21:20,671 --> 03:21:23,340
Because people who were activists
were complaining that he had said some

7091
03:21:23,341 --> 03:21:27,600
homophobic things and they do it every
had subsequently apologized for before

7092
03:21:27,601 --> 03:21:28,291
they ever listened.

7093
03:21:28,291 --> 03:21:30,290
That count count dangle
as a comedian like,

7094
03:21:30,300 --> 03:21:30,691
can I look?

7095
03:21:30,691 --> 03:21:31,650
You were to discuss this.

7096
03:21:31,651 --> 03:21:33,670
I know I'm with you and I
understand what you're saying.

7097
03:21:33,750 --> 03:21:35,060
I'm Canadian,

7098
03:21:35,310 --> 03:21:37,800
but I'm a comedian and I
understand where things are going.

7099
03:21:38,140 --> 03:21:39,190
The the,

7100
03:21:39,230 --> 03:21:42,600
the demise of free speech
is greatly exaggerated.

7101
03:21:42,840 --> 03:21:43,673
That's what I'm saying.

7102
03:21:43,950 --> 03:21:46,400
I'm saying there's a lot of people
out there that are complaining,

7103
03:21:46,640 --> 03:21:49,100
but the problem is not necessarily
that there's so many people that are

7104
03:21:49,101 --> 03:21:49,730
complaining.

7105
03:21:49,730 --> 03:21:52,010
The problem is that people are
reacting to those complaints.

7106
03:21:52,030 --> 03:21:52,190
Right?

7107
03:21:52,190 --> 03:21:56,780
The vast majority of the population is
recognizing that there is an evolution of

7108
03:21:56,781 --> 03:21:58,970
free speech that's
occurring in our culture,

7109
03:21:58,971 --> 03:22:00,590
in an all cultures around the world,

7110
03:22:00,710 --> 03:22:03,110
but this is a slow process that
when you're in the middle of it,

7111
03:22:03,290 --> 03:22:04,850
it's so almost like evolution.

7112
03:22:04,970 --> 03:22:05,781
While you're in the middle of it,

7113
03:22:05,781 --> 03:22:06,950
you don't think anything is happening,

7114
03:22:06,951 --> 03:22:07,940
but it's fucking happening.

7115
03:22:08,220 --> 03:22:08,690
Yep.

7116
03:22:08,690 --> 03:22:09,470
I agree with you.

7117
03:22:09,470 --> 03:22:11,990
I agree with you that the
majority of people are like,

7118
03:22:11,991 --> 03:22:12,411
that's funny.

7119
03:22:12,411 --> 03:22:13,244
I don't care.

7120
03:22:13,370 --> 03:22:16,940
But the minority has kind of dictating
things right now for now and not even

7121
03:22:16,941 --> 03:22:17,721
dictating things.

7122
03:22:17,721 --> 03:22:21,140
So just making a lot of that
noise is having an effect.

7123
03:22:21,260 --> 03:22:23,480
That's what data and
society was an attempt at.

7124
03:22:23,510 --> 03:22:23,810
Right.

7125
03:22:23,810 --> 03:22:25,180
I don't think it was effective.

7126
03:22:25,220 --> 03:22:26,180
That's why we're still here.

7127
03:22:26,181 --> 03:22:27,770
We're talking right now it was one attack,

7128
03:22:28,190 --> 03:22:29,410
but I mean any of the,

7129
03:22:29,760 --> 03:22:33,380
of articles that are written about all
sorts of things that are inaccurate or

7130
03:22:33,950 --> 03:22:36,440
some people have been eating your bond
bank accounts and some people have been

7131
03:22:36,441 --> 03:22:36,830
kicked off.

7132
03:22:36,830 --> 03:22:37,663
Yes.

7133
03:22:37,820 --> 03:22:40,880
This is why it's important to have this
conversation and conversations like

7134
03:22:40,881 --> 03:22:41,020
that.

7135
03:22:41,020 --> 03:22:41,111
Well,

7136
03:22:41,111 --> 03:22:41,250
so,

7137
03:22:41,250 --> 03:22:41,991
so here's what I'll say.

7138
03:22:41,991 --> 03:22:42,500
I just,

7139
03:22:42,500 --> 03:22:45,730
I crossed my fingers and I wait for when
you implement blockchain technology,

7140
03:22:45,740 --> 03:22:46,310
bro.

7141
03:22:46,310 --> 03:22:49,340
Well the van is going to be a mobile
production studio so I can travel around

7142
03:22:49,370 --> 03:22:50,660
when things are getting crazy.

7143
03:22:50,661 --> 03:22:51,494
A lot of water.

7144
03:22:52,330 --> 03:22:53,120
Well,

7145
03:22:53,120 --> 03:22:53,420
food,

7146
03:22:53,420 --> 03:22:55,490
I'm putting a bandaid so
putting a shower in it.

7147
03:22:55,670 --> 03:22:56,470
Okay.

7148
03:22:56,470 --> 03:22:59,270
It's going to be like I'm at a computer
and monitors and I'm be able to do video

7149
03:22:59,310 --> 03:23:01,190
so I can travel around when
everything's happening.

7150
03:23:01,580 --> 03:23:01,791
But,

7151
03:23:01,791 --> 03:23:03,290
but I just write this up.

7152
03:23:03,530 --> 03:23:07,790
I want to see the blockchain version
of Twitter where it said exists.

7153
03:23:07,880 --> 03:23:08,720
That's what I want to see.

7154
03:23:08,721 --> 03:23:10,340
It's going to happen
whether we like it or not.

7155
03:23:10,370 --> 03:23:11,203
Um,

7156
03:23:11,240 --> 03:23:12,073
any last thoughts?

7157
03:23:12,260 --> 03:23:12,620
Nope.

7158
03:23:12,620 --> 03:23:14,030
I just want to thank you Joe.

7159
03:23:14,040 --> 03:23:14,960
This has been great.

7160
03:23:14,990 --> 03:23:15,681
And Tim,

7161
03:23:15,681 --> 03:23:16,250

7162
03:23:16,250 --> 03:23:16,670
Thank you.

7163
03:23:16,670 --> 03:23:18,680
We're always listening and
I've learned a lot today.

7164
03:23:18,800 --> 03:23:19,281
Thank you.

7165
03:23:19,281 --> 03:23:20,360
I really appreciate you guys.

7166
03:23:20,361 --> 03:23:21,050
Thank you jack.

7167
03:23:21,050 --> 03:23:21,470
Thank you.

7168
03:23:21,470 --> 03:23:22,303
Any last things?

7169
03:23:22,720 --> 03:23:23,660
I think we've said it all.

7170
03:23:23,690 --> 03:23:24,800
That's a wrap folks.

7171
03:23:25,280 --> 03:23:26,360
No more ear beatings.

7172
03:23:26,570 --> 03:23:27,403
Goodnight everybody.

7173
03:23:29,390 --> 03:23:29,871
That was awesome.

7174
03:23:29,871 --> 03:23:30,180
Thank you.

7175
03:23:30,180 --> 03:23:30,440
Right.

7176
03:23:30,440 --> 03:23:30,920
Thank you.

7177
03:23:30,920 --> 03:23:32,240
Thanks for talking.

7178
03:23:32,241 --> 03:23:33,074
I really do appreciate it.

7179
03:23:33,890 --> 03:23:34,430
Could you,

7180
03:23:34,430 --> 03:23:35,990
I just want to followup
on a couple of things

7181
03:23:36,650 --> 03:23:40,340
they worry mean you mentioned
an NCF account that docs,

7182
03:23:40,360 --> 03:23:40,891
policemen.

7183
03:23:40,891 --> 03:23:45,850
Can you please just send the
elwise slash candy but we bit dot.

7184
03:23:46,180 --> 03:23:49,200
Ly Slash [inaudible] and then,

7185
03:23:49,270 --> 03:23:50,010
um,

7186
03:23:50,010 --> 03:23:50,701
would you DM me?

7187
03:23:50,701 --> 03:23:51,181
I'll follow you.

7188
03:23:51,181 --> 03:23:52,260
Would you DM me the,

7189
03:23:52,440 --> 03:23:54,410
the accounts that you
said had to read them?

7190
03:23:54,420 --> 03:23:55,253
You know,

7191
03:23:55,770 --> 03:23:56,270
uh,

7192
03:23:56,270 --> 03:23:57,103
no.

7193
03:23:57,110 --> 03:23:57,943
Uh,

7194
03:23:58,200 --> 03:23:59,640
I believe in minimizing harm.

7195
03:24:00,070 --> 03:24:00,903
And if,

7196
03:24:01,250 --> 03:24:01,580
Aye.

7197
03:24:01,580 --> 03:24:01,900
Aye.

7198
03:24:01,900 --> 03:24:02,460
Aye.

7199
03:24:02,460 --> 03:24:02,820
So,

7200
03:24:02,820 --> 03:24:03,150
uh,

7201
03:24:03,150 --> 03:24:03,871
when Patriot,

7202
03:24:03,871 --> 03:24:04,704
I won't,

7203
03:24:04,740 --> 03:24:05,730
I won't take action on it,

7204
03:24:05,731 --> 03:24:06,930
but I want to understand why.

7205
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:10,020
Pick acting on him and I can't
learn from that unless we,

7206
03:24:10,580 --> 03:24:10,950
so,

7207
03:24:10,950 --> 03:24:11,430
so,

7208
03:24:11,430 --> 03:24:12,263
uh,

7209
03:24:12,420 --> 03:24:13,860
when Lawrence [inaudible]
got banned from patriarchy,

7210
03:24:13,890 --> 03:24:14,370
hold on.

7211
03:24:14,370 --> 03:24:15,290
A lot of people were,

7212
03:24:15,330 --> 03:24:16,163
right now

7213
03:24:19,250 --> 03:24:21,740
this is streaming frozen.
