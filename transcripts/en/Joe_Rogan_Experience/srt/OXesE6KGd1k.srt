1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,610
Panion podcasts. If you'd never
heard one of these podcasts before.

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:05,500
Don't expect us to even pay
attention to the fights.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,820
Sometimes we do it. Sometimes
we felt like, oh great,
Joe's going to do commentary.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,770
No, Brendan's not doing commentary
accounts. I do commentary.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,970
We'll do commentary because I
know nothing about the fight.

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:22,590
He'll pretend that he is giving strategy
advice. That wouldn't really work.

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,450
Exactly. But uh, what we do is we watch
the fights and a, you can sync it up.

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,920
Um, right now it's the
first fight. Who is this?

9
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,870
This is Hein.
And we'll try saying this name.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,460
Nick Heine Verses Luke has
said Jif ski to juice ski.

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,770
There he is. There is,
Luke has said juicy.

12
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,550
Who's my favorite fighter
who ends in a ski there?

13
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,560
This is the first fight on the main card.
Who's that guy there?

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,940
The guy on the left. Yeah. Fabulous
Viking character with tattoos.

15
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,830
Dms a great look.
He's not tall to thumb.

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,350
Two thumbs go.

17
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,700
People like me running out there is Lucas.
And uh,

18
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,050
so like I said,
we,

19
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:11,880
we will might talk about this
fights or it might be diarrhea talk.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:15,170
Maybe you never know. Drugs and podcasts
that you knew shirt. Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,660
Nice fighter. And the kid
killing it. Thank. Thank you.
To Brenton shop, our design,

22
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,890
our chief designer fighter and the
kid.com I go like this. He asked me,

23
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:25,410
I might pin it and I go, I don't
know, maybe. And he goes, Oh,

24
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,920
I'm not asking your opinion, just showing
them to you. I don't hear back from him.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm like, I have an
opinion. I said, I said,

26
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:33,390
you have the fashion sense of Anne Frank.

27
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,120
Literally I was dead to
Holocaust reference. That was,

28
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:41,220
I was very surprised because she
can't see what she's wearing.

29
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,090
Very similar to you. Well
No, no, no. Now you're,

30
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,140
you're confusing and frank with Helen
Keller. That's right. Fortunately

31
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,380
why did you have
oh wow.

32
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,730
Shit and frank would be great if you
were aware in Cabo. In an attic, right.

33
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,710
And exactly.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,530
And that's it. Yeah. Had, I knew Joey

35
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,180
and I should have just kept my mouth shut.
But the problem is,

36
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,630
and frank though it would work within
then frank because she probably wore just

37
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:16,200
one like dowdy dress cause she had to
live in an attic. Right. Or a year.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,740
Damn behind is ripped. Now he's a big
kid. Kids in good shape. Yes, he has.

39
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:23,760
He was in his corner. Oh yeah, he's
a tiger Muay Thai guy. He was also,

40
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:28,270
he was also a pro uh, policemen.
Tiger Muay Thai apparently is,

41
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,470
it's just a fucking bang and
gym over in Cat Thailand.

42
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,790
They just have an amazing camp there.
There's a couple camps down now.

43
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,610
Aka has a big kid. I'm like switch down
there, right? Yep. Yeah. No I don't,

44
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:44,630
I'll wonder why Mike Swick decided to move
his camp to Thailand. Oh Shit. Totally.

45
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,900
No, this is what a
subscribers that's going on.

46
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,960
You get to see a nice surprise once you
lock us in since you're the last one in,

47
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,380
so no one knows who you go. No one
comes in here and looking for, yeah.

48
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,130
I think for SWIC as I'm sure decision,
right. Like he was going to open a gym.

49
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,120
And why Thailand?
I mean he has a family.

50
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,040
I don't know why the fuck you
decided to go to Thailand.

51
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,940
I forgot he had a family.

52
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,260
I thought it was like wiling out on the
girls and no jams. That sounds good.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,870
Can I hear amazing things about, that's
what I hear. Amazing. And when I,

54
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,550
when I shot a little movie called hangover
to all the stunt guys and most of the

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,600
just tough guys around.

56
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:21,601
We're all professional or
aspiring professional Moy
Thai guys who spoke I think

57
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:26,320
a little bit about training and Paquette.
Yeah, that area. Um, like I said,

58
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,070
he's got that too,

59
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:30,250
those two gyms and it's supposed to be
like a really cool tourist area too.

60
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:34,270
It's really beautiful. It's
spelled p h, e t which would be,

61
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:37,490
fuck it Tony mother
sounds like a great plan.

62
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,600
Lightened bitches on fire last
night at the comedy store.

63
00:03:40,601 --> 00:03:42,010
Then shows up for the fight companion.

64
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:46,410
Funny like he's in love with Yolanda
Jerk Riddick I'd say Jerky Dick.

65
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:50,500
I took the beat for that
for the bonds.

66
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,510
No fans. When you put it on the back end
to have a boss right now. By the way,

67
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,490
that's great feeling.

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,980
Oh boy. Don't say, but if you say Jerky
Dick in front of Tony, he might get upset.

69
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,830
I get a little offended over this.
I wish we could.

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,640
I wish we could respect
Johana. I do. She has the baby.

71
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:15,420
You should know how to say her fucking
name before you tell people to respect

72
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:20,060
her and Jay Check Yohanna
Yohanna and their last name.

73
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,380
Yen J. Check, check, check,
check, check that she,

74
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,810
the way she has it. There's like a
little bit of an ou in there as well.

75
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:31,050
You and jet check. I just call
her JJ it friends. Call her JJ.

76
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,970
Have you ever forgotten you'll do
that college age? I made that up. Oh,

77
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:38,710
you should get better. Like talking about
Jj, the champ JJ, but he's gs marketing.

78
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,140
She has,

79
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,670
it's not even tough to say George Saint
Pierre and everybody was saying GSP,

80
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:47,460
it's too long when you have you
ever, uh, when you call it a fight.

81
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,820
Do you ever guys guys, seriously guys.
Okay, first fights about the star.

82
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:55,840
If you're gonna sync this up, I'll let
you know. Right when they touched gloves.

83
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:58,810
Now they touched gloves.
Yeah. So the clock right now,

84
00:04:58,811 --> 00:05:00,100
the moment they showed the clock,

85
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:03,130
we'll let you guys know so you could
sync it up. We call this Sara Lee.

86
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:07,750
The Michael is feeling the guy
out for 40 ushering, four 47,

87
00:05:07,751 --> 00:05:10,090
four 46, four 45. Okay, so there you go.

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Now you sinked up because the Internet
runs about 10 seconds at least behind

89
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:19,750
depending on where you are. The Ustream
feed will run about 10 seconds behind.

90
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,020
Great Tan on that dude.
Can you tell he trains and Thailand.

91
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,450
Lucas is going after it.
Yeah, you can't help it.

92
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,610
He's got a kind of skin it smolders.

93
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:31,270
Isn't it interesting that like Tan like
that is actually good for your body and

94
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,160
your endurance and the way your,
um, your, your body makes muscle.

95
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,220
It's anabolic,
you know,

96
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,020
vitamin D and your production of vitamin
D at aids and the antibiotics process.

97
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:45,460
That's why a lot of fighters get tans.
I do. Steve Maxwell told me that. Yeah,

98
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,520
but you were just sexy bitch.
I would get 10 cause I'm vain.

99
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:53,980
I get 10 cause I'm very vain.
And you don't mind wrinkles.

100
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,880
No may know on the face. He liked
that fucking leathered old look. Well,

101
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:04,250
I do dye my beard. My sister looked
at me the other day and she goes, Ooh,

102
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,980
your face looks like
it needs lots of water.

103
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:13,130
This is just me. She's hilarious. But
mean she's very smart. Yes she is.

104
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,800
Yes. You guys are get
along very well. We did.

105
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,400
We got along great at your daughter's
party. Yes. Clung to your sister.

106
00:06:19,401 --> 00:06:22,070
My sister has one of those.
She's pretty amazing.

107
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,200
She's very smart because smart.
Not sentimental either. Good. Yeah,

108
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,100
she doesn't. I said you get hormonal when
you uh, have your period Cheetos. No,

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,970
and that annoys me. I remember when
she was younger I was like, whoa.

110
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,310
It's not a very, it doesn't have a lot
of girl energy to get along with patty.

111
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,240
Great.
Very well.

112
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,590
Call everybody pussies. Yup. Geez, that's
too intense, man. That's too intense.

113
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,050
Kathleen is not like when girls talk like
them, man. Those guys of scary. Yeah.

114
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,060
My sister is not sentimental
hoods seats like, whoa, whoa.

115
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:58,040
She's not romantic stuff.
Easy bit. Some are down bitch.

116
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,380
Someone's going to make you swallow your
teeth. Cat. My sister, my sister used to,

117
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,920
my sister used to have
an eye for weakness,

118
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:07,370
like if she saw a guy with a w what she
called a week Chin or if somebody was

119
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:11,120
sleeping with their mouth open, God help
you. She'd be like sleeping on a plane.

120
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,180
We'd be on our plan. Should go look
at that guy with his mouth open.

121
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,840
What a weak link. I was like,
come on man. He's just sleeping.

122
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:21,200
His jaws hanging open.
She's like, that's annoying.

123
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,370
That's your dad's barbarian jeans?
Yes. She's all my, I call her I,

124
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,130
the joke is I look at our go daddy.
Oh, I mean Kathleen, they look alike.

125
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,290
That's not good. No, she's got, she's
got bigger bones. She was the Husky one.

126
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,320
I was the frail. You wish you
had your sisters genes, dude,

127
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:39,130
I would get cold really
easily. I had no, I had,

128
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:42,140
I was so skinny and my sister was like,
what are you cold for you baby?

129
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:46,640
She has a full set of hair on her too.
She does. Chicks don't usually go ball.

130
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,730
She's not suffering from male pattern
baldness. What we're talking about.

131
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:56,420
I'm like, she's a fucking war.
Like I said, I hear on her,

132
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,870
she also has a little Dick.
It's got a tiny,

133
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:03,220
tiny cock ball.
That was a nice styles,

134
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,110
a nice transition there behind
recognizing that that knee is coming.

135
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,210
Kind of telegraph that knee now ride
the back but give up the position.

136
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:14,870
Most small, small arms is short
arms and legs. She's very muscular.

137
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,940
He sits a rare look these days.
Gosh,

138
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,760
get your hands off in the lighter and
lighter weight classes guys are becoming

139
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,070
less and less muscular.
Really? Yeah. Yeah.

140
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,280
Well cause we got Caligiuri
and CBRE on the car tonight.

141
00:08:28,281 --> 00:08:31,850
Two guys that were real thick for
their way class. It's just super rare.

142
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,480
Wait til this drug testing kicks in
and it was only like gumby and shit.

143
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:40,250
You're not joking to Kermit the
frog. Not Joking. It is. It's very,

144
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,160
very weird. What? What's going on here?

145
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:46,850
Because the UFC is deciding
to do it on their own.

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,830
They're deciding to clean
up the sport on their own,

147
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:53,080
but it's an inherently dirty sports,
but they're not part of it. Right.

148
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,490
And they're handed off so, and you'll
see, they can't tell him who to test.

149
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,070
They're just saying, hi, you
guys do it strictly as fuck.

150
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,270
We're just going to stay out of it.

151
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,490
They're telling they're telling the
commissioner to do that. No, no,

152
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:03,141
not a commission.

153
00:09:03,141 --> 00:09:07,100
I bringing in water that bringing the
people that busted Balka the strictest

154
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,670
drug testing in the world. They're
going to have it year round. Right.

155
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,720
They're going to do it randomly
all year round. The five,

156
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:15,060
five random tests a year.
They show up at your house,

157
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:19,740
three o'clock in the morning, Brian,
get up. God Damn you ain't no. Yeah.

158
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:23,330
The problem with that and awakened
me. A Wiccan security son. Yeah.

159
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,690
Hashtag rich they're getting,

160
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,680
they're getting guys that are um,
you know,

161
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:37,320
looking in the middle of your sleep cycle,
you're fucking up their whole day.

162
00:09:37,321 --> 00:09:39,300
If you could fuck up a couple
of days of training problem,

163
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,120
they could take a shot and maybe they
wouldn't have taken if you'd done that,

164
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,700
you know, I mean, they might be slower in
the gym because of that. That's really,

165
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,120
you're going to get a piss.
I'm gonna Piss on your face.

166
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,010
You wake me up at three in the morning.
There should be,

167
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,710
but they don't want to make
it so that you could cycle it.

168
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,220
You know you can get apparently
Alex Rodriguez, by the way,

169
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,790
this scientific analysis is brought to
you by Joey Diaz told me about this.

170
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,660
Don't take it with a grain of salt. Yeah,
dog. They got these fucking gummy bears.

171
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,010
Alex Rodriguez was taken gummy bears.
He would take him and they would test.

172
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,510
By the time he knew exactly when to take
these fucking things so that when they

173
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,490
were going to test them, it
would be out of, it's just, no,

174
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:15,990
he's right fucking gummy bear.

175
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,410
He's right that he would do it and turn
the game by the end of the game is if

176
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,470
they test them as another system.
How's that possible? I have no idea.

177
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:25,500
I wish I had the fucking scientist.
But is that still possible?

178
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,990
Cause someone to get those
to veto lunch yesterday.

179
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:33,900
Was that the weirdest
transition of bodies? Vito?

180
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:37,050
Between Luke Rockhold and
veto fighting Weidman.

181
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:41,220
It's like what the fuck happened
or or over him that time. No,

182
00:10:41,221 --> 00:10:45,540
but over him still looks like a stud. Like
Overeem is smaller than it used to be,

183
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,170
but he's still looks like a stud when
old tour, it looks deflated. I agree.

184
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:54,171
He looks like he looks like someone stole
his meat over him when he fought Brock

185
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,420
Lesnar I was like, holy fuck, you need
to beat bright ass. Shut that shit.

186
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:00,300
Oh hell yeah.
It's called guys guys.

187
00:11:00,301 --> 00:11:05,150
Obstructional you beat Brock's ass and
then just walk on over to the fucking, uh,

188
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,800
Orleans casino and when the Mr
Olympia like you could do both.

189
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,090
He was fucking Jack. I watched
it. I was like, Oh fuck.

190
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:16,060
I need to find a different career or a
different doctor. Holly, different doctor.

191
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,300
What can I ask you guys? Uh,
I watched the Kimbo slice, uh,

192
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,740
frank champ. I mean then shamrock,
shamrock fight and him, Ken,

193
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:28,110
him and Ken had him
completely stretched out.

194
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,750
When I got to tell you right now
that fight look fake as fuck.

195
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:32,040
That's what I was going
to take that literally,

196
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,100
that's what I thought was a couple of
things I don't like about that fight.

197
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,280
I don't like that clinch,

198
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:38,250
that long clinch that they had
where they were mouth to ear,

199
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,310
they would amount to each other's
ears for Nolan was really striking.

200
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,140
Like if he's turning your wrestler,

201
00:11:43,141 --> 00:11:45,300
I'm popping those elbows
and fucking take me down.

202
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:48,840
How about the fact that would have
stretched out when Ken did take him down?

203
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,860
He never hit him once. How about that?
He never hit him. He had him down.

204
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,070
He had them flattened out.

205
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,420
He had his back and he's not crashing
them. He's not blasting with punches.

206
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,870
He's got him flattened out and he's not
hitting him. That doesn't make any sense.

207
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:05,280
He's also, he also had a full, he
had a full head to toe. I know,

208
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,040
but he's also 51 that's true,
and a fighter 51 yeah,

209
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,230
that's true. You'd, you'd a hundred
percent correct and I was like,

210
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,250
I watched everyone, right? I watch
all the [inaudible]. I watch all UFC,

211
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,370
I'll let you everything. So the bell tour
when, when the interest is, I was like,

212
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,980
this is so dope. The, it was kind
of like the pride and all that.

213
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,790
Then I was on board. You have the, I was
on, you had, he had big brown on board,

214
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
but then when Ken shamrock walked
out, I was like, what the fuck?

215
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:33,790
How about the girl who was singing?
What was that about? I don't know. See,

216
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,460
I'm down with that though.
I'm down with lights.

217
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:37,860
His love for Brian to thing for me,
when I walked,

218
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,550
he is a man. He's really tall and
brow. No a singer, not like that.

219
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,440
He's got great hair and a part inspired
by the great Gatsby that would crush so

220
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:53,510
hard.
I'm working with big brown,

221
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,870
his big brown,
big brown.

222
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,070
You could totally get an opponent's head.
By the way,

223
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,990
when he's laughing at your insurance,

224
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:09,060
he's going to punch this guy in
his big fat and take him down.

225
00:13:09,061 --> 00:13:11,930
Be careful of his game.
I don't want a west side story

226
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,750
and surveys.
Just two is second to none.

227
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,410
He's really handsome. That
doesn't, he can turn on a nun.

228
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:26,710
Don't ever play with me.
You didn't even try.

229
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,640
But shamrock came out.
I think his whole family was

230
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,990
behind him. He had a white girl with the
daughter and the kids behind it. Yeah.

231
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,430
He had a girl that was with them,

232
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:41,570
mostly his granddaughter or something
that had his daughter maybe that had a kid

233
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,020
on board until that,
until that it was very WWF.

234
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,770
The entrances to me, it looked
the whole thing, the entrance.

235
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,010
So suspect because he was
shaking everybody's hand.

236
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:54,400
It didn't look like he was about
to go to a fight and it was about,

237
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:56,600
he was about to go put
on a performance nervous.

238
00:13:56,601 --> 00:13:59,600
And if you watched Kimbo fight when he
was in the UFC when he was fighting like

239
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:01,010
mitre own or Houston Alexander,

240
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,610
that motherfucker's taking it serious
now when he fought Ken Shamrock,

241
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,150
he's talking to him in the ring
before the entrance. No, no, no.

242
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,790
The baddest motherfuckers on the
nurse really don't talk like that,

243
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,240
but they might have told them that this
is the way to generate interest in this

244
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:17,060
fight to hype it up all
the fake bad blood like,

245
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,250
and then the other thing that got me
was the way Kimbo stopped share mark.

246
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,200
That was real as fuck. I mean
he definitely was crap. I agree.

247
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,700
So maybe they made an agreement and Kimbo
said I'm to punch this mother fucker

248
00:14:31,701 --> 00:14:35,400
anyway. Yeah, he was like, it's
fine. Glasses dude. Um, but,

249
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,930
but he did have him completely stretched
out with what looked like a full rear

250
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:42,260
naked choke. Am I wrong about that? Sort
of, but he never went behind the head.

251
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,760
Like he choked him,

252
00:14:43,761 --> 00:14:47,360
but he had it like on top of the head
and sort of sort of weird and Kimbo was

253
00:14:47,361 --> 00:14:50,100
able to just keep grabbing up because
it's hard to choke out with one arm.

254
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:52,890
And this year, I mean you gotta you
gotta be real mother fucker. Yeah.

255
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,250
To be a monster.
But timber just kept grabbing the one arm,

256
00:14:55,251 --> 00:14:58,040
which is the right move
to do. But I saw, oh man,

257
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,750
it was disturbing to me how easy
Kimbo Shuck Ken off his back.

258
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,810
Like there's a lot of shit that I
didn't like about it, that it was dealt.

259
00:15:05,811 --> 00:15:08,480
And you see their next card,
they're doing a doublet they're doing,

260
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,340
and if I call on it, Diamond May.
I love it. Yeah. I'm on board.

261
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,460
[inaudible] daily on that.
I don't know if he's fighting daily,

262
00:15:16,461 --> 00:15:19,160
but they're both fighting on the car.
I thought he was fighting daily.

263
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,130
If he's funny. Daily daily's
and fucking trust. Super
trouble. He's in trouble. Yes.

264
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,341
Joe Shillings.

265
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,090
A tall motherfucker who can crack
and he's been in there with the best

266
00:15:29,091 --> 00:15:31,280
kickboxers in the world and daily date.
Yeah.

267
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:34,610
Dailies really good kickboxing for MMA.
But then again,

268
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,060
dailies got that fucking
ridiculous nuclear left left. Yeah.

269
00:15:38,061 --> 00:15:41,570
But if he don't think Joe Schilling seemed
better striking. Yes. He knocked out,

270
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:45,410
man. Come on. Yeah, he knocked
out, man. Oh Man. I have

271
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,280
kicked him and I can't imagine
if I told him. Yeah, yeah.

272
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,060
Watching those, those kickboxing fights
where it's just kickboxing with huff his,

273
00:15:56,061 --> 00:15:59,510
so he was so devastating for a while
that he used to be a Schilling.

274
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,350
Schilling knocked out fucking Simon Marcus
with one punch after they've gone to

275
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:07,250
four rounds. Four rounds. Yeah. And that
was the first guy to ever beat Marcus.

276
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:10,670
Marcus was undefeated like 39 and then
went to a drawl. Right. And then they,

277
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,340
they had to go to the next. Right.
And the reason why I went to withdraw,

278
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,930
Simon had dropped him. Simon had dropped
Joe showing, but then Joe Schilling,

279
00:16:17,931 --> 00:16:22,400
you'd come back and won
some, like it was, you know,

280
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:26,630
the way they do to Gloria was the old
k one way where if they go three rounds

281
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:29,440
and then if it's a draw, they go to
the fourth and final round tiebreaker.

282
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,540
That's a mother fucker.
That'll fuck your mind. Well,

283
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,610
how about the fact that he had to
fight two more times after that night?

284
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,580
Same night. Yes. He had a fight. Fucking
Wayne Barrett, who's a bad motherfucker.

285
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,670
He had a fight him after that. And then
he had a fight. Art 11 in the fucking,

286
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,850
this is all just striking right up.
Oh, kickbox gets paid for stuff.

287
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,990
That was a pretty, pretty good
pay day, I'm sure. How old he was.

288
00:16:50,991 --> 00:16:55,100
Just talking about how sorry was like
for days you had hit asleep in an easy

289
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:59,120
chair. Every time he'd get up he'd
be like, oh, his arms wouldn't bend.

290
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,260
Everything was fucked up.

291
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:04,360
Just like getting hit and balking and
three fights in one day. That's what that,

292
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:07,010
that's way, that's crazy.
He fucked 10 rounds,

293
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,160
10 rounds against three
different opponents. I did
four sets the other night.

294
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:12,890
I thought that was hard.
Can I be honest with you?

295
00:17:12,891 --> 00:17:16,930
It's like you're looking a little more
vascular and I appreciate it. Weights.

296
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:21,470
I got the kid lifting that squad Straw.
You started

297
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,100
when we were in Canada.

298
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:28,040
The kids saw us with our shirts off and
decided to start lifting. That's right.

299
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,850
Brian switched shirts to rep you?
Yeah.

300
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,890
Oh, nice. So all three of
you played a part in it. Nice
man. He started working out.

301
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,610
Yeah, I had to. Yeah. He saw the kid
with his fucking shorter. I saw that.

302
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:49,100
It made me like really sad. Rogan's pretty
jacked. Rogan's very thick. It's a lot.

303
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,053
They like,
I

304
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,280
didn't, I was like, I
need shoulder surgery.

305
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:57,350
I have a torn labrum. I hope.
I don't know. So man. Yeah,

306
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,120
it clicks and it makes them more,
you know,

307
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,510
the problem has been bugging me for a
year and for a year I've just been pushing

308
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:07,830
through it. Because you're an extremist.
Moderate. I always stop Joe. Definitely.

309
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,490
No, I called Brian the other night.
I'm like, where are you man? He's like,

310
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,350
emergency room, Bro. I got a
sore throat right now. I'm like,

311
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,010
I'm not making this up. He's like, I'm
in the emergency room. And it could,

312
00:18:19,011 --> 00:18:21,650
it could, you know, you see a white spot
that can be canceled. I'm like, Yep,

313
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,260
that's spastic catch shit. Same thing.
Or is it, no, no, no. I had, I had a,

314
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,290
on my dingleberry I W it was a
white spot and I was like, Oh,

315
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:31,110
same one spot or a new one that
I was the same one. But I go,

316
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,630
that's cancer and a guy looks at my thing
and he goes, and he goes, this is, I was,

317
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:39,450
I was so convinced. And he
goes, Huh? I already, he goes,
I guess that that's wild.

318
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,780
I go, what is, he goes, you didn't,
it's probably, where were you?

319
00:18:41,781 --> 00:18:44,640
I said it was in Costa Rica. Oh, I
used to work in a clinic down there.

320
00:18:44,641 --> 00:18:48,440
He probably has something from there
by just a self limiting virus. Oh,

321
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,890
by the way, gone the next day. I think
it was food on my tonsil on my thing.

322
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,040
It's embarrassing,
man.

323
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:56,190
He was probably ate a chocolate donut
with like powdered sugar on or some shit.

324
00:18:56,191 --> 00:19:00,780
A hypochondriac. Powdered sugar. Gotten
a little thing. Meanwhile I pokes.

325
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,180
I fucking hate them.
Jesus Christ.

326
00:19:03,181 --> 00:19:06,240
While your sister has spots all over
her fucking tongue, it doesn't do shit.

327
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:10,250
A bitch doesn't give a fuck.
She eats grass at me.

328
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,190
Who's up some grass clean mouth.
It's got green mouth syndrome,

329
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,710
foamy green bubbles on the corner of
her mouth. You chewing that cut again.

330
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,600
Shut the fuck up. Pussy. Looks
like you have your mouth open.

331
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:26,100
You don't have four stomachs.
Stop Chewing.

332
00:19:26,101 --> 00:19:29,090
Cutting's a special type of dude
to be with a girl like that. Yeah.

333
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,840
I'm not one of those guys tried it.
I am not that guy. I've tried it too.

334
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:35,370
I like women who are women.
Me Too,

335
00:19:35,371 --> 00:19:38,400
like women who want to argue with you
and they get fucking gangster with you.

336
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:41,310
That's not interesting to me.
That's like when I, when I tried,

337
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:45,270
I had a little affair with growing the
national Canadian water polo team who was

338
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,210
so hot, but she went back, was
thicker than mine and her hands,

339
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,730
her knuckles when we'd hold
hands. I was like, well,

340
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,690
your hands are a little just a smidge
bigger than mine and I have a big problem

341
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,470
with that. See, that's what I
love about my girlfriend Yolanda,

342
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,470
is that she doesn't start
any drama or talk shit,

343
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,180
but she, she knows her role.
She's mentioned she'll finish it,

344
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,320
uses it all up given chicks concussions.

345
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,710
She's exhausted by the time
she gets to you. She's very,

346
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,670
she's very beaten pitches. I want to
see you guys today. If you guys fucked,

347
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,020
you wouldn't have much say in it.
Don't need you lick pussy now.

348
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:25,830
I think boozy, you'll come out of your
fucking tired. Come on down. She wouldn't

349
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,200
go to sleep. I know why they call him the
Golden Pony. It's he's, he's surprising.

350
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:34,920
He has a surprising dick. That's
good. Is Dickie. So Bryce skinny,

351
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:38,220
skinny but like me, but he's
surprising. It's more of the ivory pony.

352
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,980
I give it to her. Good guys. I'm serious.

353
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,700
She didn't know your hair up in corn rows.
Just

354
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,020
I'd give it to

355
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:48,960
her.
Good guys

356
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,070
come.
I wouldn't fucking give it to her man.

357
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,770
That's how you know a guy's mouth.
He started laying the proper,

358
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,310
I was setting up for my cornrows line
too. Good man. You know how I do it guys?

359
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:09,380
Like looking for everybody
to confirm my guys. You know

360
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:14,110
guys, I would, I would
fuck her. Good fellas.

361
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:20,980
The time I was telling her she needed,
we haven't talked about this fight once.

362
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,560
Yeah. This guy sergeant is actually
getting the better of him right now. He's,

363
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,230
he's uh oh there it is man.

364
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,690
Highness slick. He, he's very aware
of what's going on. Like when,

365
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,780
when the other guy is throwing
shots and kicks, he's,

366
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,970
he's aware of like where
the angles are coming from,

367
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:39,550
is capitalized a couple of times on that.
He's cardios good.

368
00:21:39,551 --> 00:21:42,120
He hasn't stopped moving man.
He's not tired. He's tire.

369
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,430
Roger Works is a good fucking trainer man.

370
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:48,850
He's apparently going to
fight again on the UFC. No,

371
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:53,630
he's fighting on one FC last week. His
last flight, right. Soccer fucked up.

372
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,860
He fought one 72 and Roger's not,

373
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,690
not even that big for one 55. Going
to catch an angles. Look at that dude.

374
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,970
You remember Roger Roger when he was in
the UFC and he's like the poster boy.

375
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,660
He's the first one that everyone thinks
Rhonda was the first one on the cover of

376
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:11,350
sports illustrated. Actually Roger worked
up. I'm great. This is my man over here.

377
00:22:11,351 --> 00:22:14,070
It's walking toward him to straight
toward him and, and then we met he,

378
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:18,250
because I think he beat, uh, I forget who
he beat in that one. Eat a lot of guys,

379
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,830
but he was front kicking the guy and
who was the front cover of sports

380
00:22:20,831 --> 00:22:24,400
illustrated. But then he got to
like big headed and he was like,

381
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,610
I want to get paid, whatever. So is
not just that you want to get paid.

382
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,380
He started complaining
about shit publicly,

383
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:34,690
started complaining about the media duties
and not getting paid for media duties.

384
00:22:34,691 --> 00:22:38,110
And it was like, what? That
motherfucker disappeared. He made it.

385
00:22:38,111 --> 00:22:40,900
He said to do what? That's
cool. Check this out.

386
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,530
Shelf Ia for a nice young two years
and here's the worst matchup possible.

387
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,740
Here's gray Maynard. See Ya. I'm
gonna fucking went to Thailand.

388
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,010
Last time I saw him fighting, he was
in a street fight in Texas. Yeah,

389
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,350
that was amazing though.
The dude hit a girl.

390
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,570
The dude hit a girl in the
parking lot. What? Yeah,

391
00:22:55,571 --> 00:22:58,720
and Roger worked a pig ass
dude and Roger worked a k.

392
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,190
Oh this dude in front of a football
player. Big football player. Wow.

393
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,990
He sucker punches this girl.
Oh, I don't know what happened,

394
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:08,620
but this guy stepped up and sucker
punches. Girl got his face and he goes,

395
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,090
I'll knock you out too,
motherfucker.

396
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,870
Roger takes his shirt off and
just tees off on this guy.

397
00:23:13,871 --> 00:23:17,110
It's like Goddamn action movie.
The camera pans to the guy,

398
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,080
pants to Roger moving towards the guy.
Next thing you know,

399
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,630
there's like a scramble
people in front of him.

400
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:25,330
The Dude's laid out and Roger soccer
kicking him in the ass, dude. Wow.

401
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,410
Did he get in trouble for it? No, he got
love from the whole world. Fantastic.

402
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:34,490
Could you get trouble for
that guy's a con, right? He's
a good dude, man. Good Dude.

403
00:23:34,491 --> 00:23:38,110
He's a great guy. Really good guy. He just
had the wrong people in his ear. He's,

404
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:41,020
oh, he's on. He came and he
was in Denver for a while.

405
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:46,010
I remember training with us and he was
always just the fucking just bra man. His

406
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,630
boy one. Yeah. Well he's, he's taken a
lot of punishment in his career, man.

407
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,270
He tried being an APP. Yeah.
Well that was the thing.

408
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:54,680
He was dating that Laura prepon.

409
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,770
Yeah. From that 70
[inaudible] show. Yeah. And a,

410
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:00,470
I think she probably got in his head and
she was like the first celebrity I saw.

411
00:24:00,471 --> 00:24:05,270
I thought Rogers. So Cause Marty,
how's it go? Shit. Dan Hardee.

412
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,590
Jesus Christ. No Guy's, he
looks like Tom Hardy though.

413
00:24:09,591 --> 00:24:12,980
Cause Tom is also playing a character
like this. So there's Roger.

414
00:24:12,981 --> 00:24:16,970
Look at handsome bastard. I'm look at
him. Yeah, he's a fucking ladies' man.

415
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,800
I've ever seen one kit to stud. They tried
doing the whole acting thing in fine.

416
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,810
They get you man.
They get you.

417
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,680
Dan Hardee gave that dude
the Mike can't do that.

418
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:32,590
That's frowned upon Dan hard.
He's going to be slapped when he goes.

419
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:35,120
What is this speech?
This guys can't do this.

420
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,140
It's about to start a revolution
of some kinds of shit. I'm on.

421
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,090
It sounds like Hitler. Mine comp. Yeah.

422
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:45,200
He's the only thing with his hand.

423
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,760
This is intense. This some
fight this on bypass shit. Hey,

424
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,040
there's some fipass shit man grabbed up.

425
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,320
Take that mic Dan Hardee who gets taller
than I thought 1,000 just give him that

426
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,770
mic. What's stretch? I mean that's
a big no, no, right Joe do that.

427
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,650
You can then very rare
occasions I hi guys on a trust.

428
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,330
You know, mentally like really hard
to share a mic with anyone ever.

429
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,810
You know when it's your role when
you're in control, but it's a difference

430
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,830
[inaudible] because when I'm doing
interviews like you never, I very, I'm,

431
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,160
I have no personality when I'm
doing interviews, my personality,

432
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:29,030
my or my interviews are all about trying
to get the most out of the fighter.

433
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,210
I just tried to ask him question and
give them the opportunity to express

434
00:25:32,211 --> 00:25:36,290
themselves. But you very, I've, I don't
interject very much. Most of what I do,

435
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,390
I'll give them a little enthusiasm,

436
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,670
tell them how exciting it
was and how awesome ones,

437
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,740
but my goal is 100% while I'm doing
interviews is to try to get that guy to

438
00:25:45,741 --> 00:25:50,150
express himself. That's why when I, when
I've tried to give people advice about,

439
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,280
you know, I've had a lot of guys
ask me like, what do you do?

440
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:54,590
How do I give interviews?
That's my scariest part a lot.

441
00:25:54,591 --> 00:25:57,410
A lot of these guys are real nervous
about interviews because it's live.

442
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,070
You don't know exactly what to say and
you kind of ad libbing it in the moment.

443
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,940
I'm like, the most important thing
is it's not you, it's not about you.

444
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:08,420
It's all about trying to get the most
out of that guy. This is his moment.

445
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,520
What he was thinking, how it feels
to be a champion. All that does.

446
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:14,300
Is it surprising? Um,
give us your thoughts.

447
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:16,770
I want to know how a guy feels afters
cause sometimes a guy will say,

448
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,630
you know what man, from the second round
my hand was broken and uh, you know,

449
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:24,020
I tried to eat and you don't know, right?
Like you have to, you have to ask. Like,

450
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:28,040
how do you feel like, what happened? What
was it like? Was anything surprising?

451
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,190
You can't give him the mic. Don't
give me the mic. I like, Yo God,

452
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,450
Tfa tek.com blog gets everyone.

453
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,650
Was your, were you, um, I'm
surprised at the, uh, Cain Velasquez?

454
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:46,070
Uh, no I wasn't. I wasn't,

455
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:49,620
I wasn't surprised when I thought about
it afterwards. While it was happening,

456
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:51,300
I was like, whoa, this is crazy.

457
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,550
But you can't just go up to 7,500 feet
above sea level and expect to keep your

458
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:59,730
cardio. Especially when you haven't
fought in two fucking years. Man,

459
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,140
you just haven't fought. I see.
I think that's a good point.

460
00:27:04,141 --> 00:27:05,220
You can't do that.

461
00:27:05,221 --> 00:27:10,221
However you don't become a multi time
world champ and not know that that's an

462
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:15,510
issue. And I think his issues are way
beyond that. I think he realized that,

463
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:18,670
I think they could have fought in
fucking la at sea level and he would have

464
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:21,720
looked like that. Really? Yeah. I think,
I think [inaudible] a bad example.

465
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:25,230
You don't get to his level without
assuming that. I think it's a cop out.

466
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,380
I gotta be honest. Wow,
that's interesting. So what
do you think is going on,

467
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,640
do you think for you were doing,

468
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:31,740
just got that much better do
you think came to slipping?

469
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,660
I think for doom got that much better.

470
00:27:33,661 --> 00:27:37,530
And I think Kane has had damn near
two years off and he's taken a lot of

471
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:40,770
punishment, man and good points. And
with these injuries. It's not like,

472
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:41,760
you know how it goes,
man,

473
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,520
when you have something to drink can
still work on stuff and continue to get

474
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:48,270
better.
Two years off of with surgeries and Rehab,

475
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,260
two years in MMA, the UFC, the game's
changing fast as fuck man. Like even now,

476
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,840
I haven't fought since December.

477
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:58,860
If I fought at then this next
December with a year off,

478
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:02,790
the games changed little over two years
and then you're fighting a motherfucker

479
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:07,350
and for doom who's been activists fucking
getting better and better and then,

480
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,210
and he's tall and he's got long reach.
Don't want to take them down. Enjoy that.

481
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,990
So what are you going to do now? And he
got strangled. I mean, that's what it was,

482
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,100
which is actually better
for him. You know, he was
getting fucked up on his feet.

483
00:28:20,101 --> 00:28:22,390
He was about to get knocked out.
He's about for doing.

484
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,510
He was wobbling all over the place.

485
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:28,020
I would imagine if you were getting ready
for her doom in your Cain Valasquez,

486
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,300
your coach says, never
shoot a sack. Double leg.

487
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,330
Only a single know his coach was to
Javier Vasquez for versatile or Javier

488
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,930
Mendez rather who, first of all,
it was a fantastic coach. Yes,

489
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,570
it doesn't have a background is grappling.

490
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,680
Black belt in Jujitsu was not some
worldclass grabbed her. Right.

491
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:45,010
I don't think he's ever rolled
with a guy like for over doing.

492
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:49,350
Have you never rolled the guy who has a
fucking nasty guard look for doom guys,

493
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:54,390
you don't know. You can't take that guy
down, right? You can, but there has to be.

494
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:57,690
You have to bring in a guy like boosh
shusher to get you ready for, for doom.

495
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,531
Shoot a single.

496
00:28:58,531 --> 00:29:00,930
I got them because they're going to
different stuff to get ahold of your neck

497
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,040
like you shouldn't see you like
on a high level guide Jitsu guy.

498
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,090
He's going to get a hold of your neck,

499
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,720
but you can pass and still taking the
matter to shit is in the first round. Yes.

500
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,420
Well he loves his head on the outside.

501
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:13,110
Knows that problem has
to be on the incident.

502
00:29:13,111 --> 00:29:14,530
Your head has to be pinned to the chassis.

503
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,970
You should a double on a guy like Carl,
like Fabricio,

504
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:21,660
but for [inaudible] guard is so fucking
good unless you bring in a Vinnie

505
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,670
Magallanes or someone who's
got like a commensurate guard.

506
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,550
Good luck being able to defend
against him because he's got hit.

507
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,410
That double leg was desperation.
You can see him exhausted.

508
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,090
Have you ever seen change Cain?

509
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:38,270
Cain shoot such a shitty double and he
was just exhausted and then first of all

510
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:42,040
it's his technique was shit, right?
You see him over his, he leans,

511
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:46,090
he he liked leans over and over.
Dunamis is fucking promo.

512
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,470
Turn his volume of Jamie.
Best Promo ever. This is,

513
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,940
this is amazing fucking Promo.

514
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,120
I'm so fucking pumped things. Me and
Eddie got a crown on this fella, Hon.

515
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:02,450
Do you guys better grant?
Who'd you buy? Really? Ooh,

516
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,260
I'm rooting for Connor though.
I love that guy.

517
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,080
He walks even. It's so cool.
It's just a cocky fuck.

518
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,680
Like I love it.

519
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:20,080
This is such a great commercial
commercial, by the way. Cost $1 million.

520
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,790
Look at those eyes.
What a great fucking commercial.

521
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,440
God Damn.
July 11 hurry up and get here.

522
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:36,080
Please say what was it cheap
is using that Jay z song?

523
00:30:36,081 --> 00:30:38,250
They're probably got some 900
grand than a hundred Ghana.

524
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,800
I'll do that shit for $20 right now.
Yeah.

525
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,670
Could have sang the song for that
Promo. That would have been, oh,

526
00:30:46,671 --> 00:30:51,500
I hope that's right. Machida and
Romero, are you around for that?

527
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,680
You in town? I'm in San Francisco
at the punchline. Is that what? No,

528
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,320
that's not next weekend. Callan. June
27th June 27th this is June 27 yeah,

529
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:03,740
you and next weekend is the 27th around.
I'll be in you're there to,

530
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:07,970
to doing business. What are you doing?
Business. What kind of business?

531
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,120
The podcast sponsors business sponsor
stuff. Meeting with sue sponsor,

532
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:16,010
rearrange that. They would stand
up. You want to see my work?

533
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:20,150
I'm all,
I could go up and do yourself.

534
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:24,710
Do you have to set, oh, now the
year, now that you mention writing,

535
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:27,860
how much new stuff? Now let me ask you
this about your special, which by the way,

536
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:31,470
it was fucking so much fun to be at. The
only time I've ever opened up for a guy.

537
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,360
This is the only time I've ever warmed
up a crowd. Incredible. Like, I dunno,

538
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:39,990
15 fucking years I haven't gone
to on a show and 15 years. Yeah.

539
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,620
It was weird. Yeah. It's
weird to just go up like that.

540
00:31:42,621 --> 00:31:44,760
Like you do it all the time,
Tony. You know, you're like,

541
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:49,940
there's a talent to getting the
crowd going. Like getting into it.

542
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,620
It was fun. Yeah, you did a great job,

543
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,010
but that room is fucking
amazing for a special.

544
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:58,670
When I was backstage watching on the
Monitor, I was like, this is perfect.

545
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,760
It's the perfect room. I loved
it. I loved the, I love the state.

546
00:32:01,761 --> 00:32:05,960
I love the feel on the floor. I feel so
grounded. Did they ask you to do, do,

547
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,560
do you have more than one camera? Like
how many cameras? Six camera. Six cameras.

548
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:13,280
Yeah. See, I was thinking like the one
camera that they have when you work there,

549
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:16,480
you know how you worked there. They
make a film of every show. Right.

550
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,850
And the one camera that they have when
you work there as well. Perfect. Yeah.

551
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:23,410
It's like that one. I've been
watching specials lately and one,

552
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,280
one of the things that I've
been coming to this conclusion,

553
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:28,100
it's like you need one view of the show,

554
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:31,820
like head on the way you
can kind of watch a show.

555
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,580
Do you think 20 cameras over kill Cowen?
Six cameras.

556
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,460
Well he had a guy with him that does hair,
who had a holster,

557
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:42,140
was dead serious for sure.
Relax. I'm just giving them a,

558
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,060
I was just giving them my credit. You
know, he's a good guy and whatever,

559
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:48,200
giving them credit for all those people
were in the way during the way of

560
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:51,640
thinking. There's relaxation. If
it wasn't for Brendan tonight,

561
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,030
you probably wouldn't have been loose.
Yeah,

562
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:55,430
cause we were back there busting
those guys balls. It's right.

563
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,760
Like what you had on a Bentley belt.
Little too much.

564
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:02,810
He had a Bentley belt of red
Kango backwards of course,

565
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,620
and a holster. Any little cal writing
eyes was like, don't fuck this up.

566
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:10,850
See you went, how long he grabbed
you by the ears. What did I do?

567
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:15,290
Like 20 1520 minutes? About
28, 20, 28. But it was great.

568
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,950
They loved it. Hell yeah. Was
very appropriate and it was great.

569
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,590
The thing we talked about, Kevin was
so ready to just smart move to have uh,

570
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,980
such as, you know, a way over
qualified opener for a special,

571
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:30,140
I mean it's hilarious.
Joe Rogan opening for me.

572
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:34,280
I had Joey Diaz do mine at the Ice House.
That's says do it man.

573
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,330
That's how you do it was bloody murders
through. The thing was is I got,

574
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:41,510
I go Joey, I can only have
you do 15. Cause if you do,

575
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,180
if you do 21 minutes or longer,

576
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,510
there's no way they're going to be
able to listen to me for an hour.

577
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,980
And you have to be careful with that.

578
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:53,930
Like you don't want that fucking like
earned amount. Kevin Hart opened for you,

579
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:58,710
Joe. I got three guys opened for me before
when I was filling in special fuck too

580
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:03,290
much. Yeah, it was too much at some times
when I show we Dunkin. Oh No. Was it Joey?

581
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:07,810
Ari, Joey, Ari. I think it
was Joey. Ari and a red band.

582
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:11,490
Did a set. Yeah, it was
ridiculous. Two people. One person.

583
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,060
I didn't go on stage to the
hour and the show plus too much.

584
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:17,230
I'll defer your special. Yeah.
Wow. And it lands with you.

585
00:34:17,231 --> 00:34:20,270
It's like you know when you are worried
because you're sweating so much.

586
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:23,630
He wouldn't shut up the second shot.
I turned the heat off.

587
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,440
Don't worry about it. Just do it.
Show look. You're in a club. Yeah.

588
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,230
No one gives you a club. You wouldn't
care. Right. If you were just,

589
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:31,460
it was a set on the weekend,

590
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,770
it wouldn't even cross your mind
if it would cross your mind,

591
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:34,480
it'd be something wrong.

592
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,890
I was just thinking about not being
able to use the second take because the

593
00:34:36,891 --> 00:34:39,610
sweat was different on my shirt and by
the way, don't wear a shirt like that.

594
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,640
Don't wear a light blue shirt. As soon as
I walked in on the, God damn it. I know.

595
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:47,800
I always knew to wear a black shirt or
best was in between shows. They're like,

596
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:50,390
Brian, we have to fix the hair on the back
of your head. I'm like, no, you don't.

597
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:52,580
You don't have to fix his hair.
He's like,

598
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:55,370
he's the back of his neck like the back
of his neck just winding up. I'm like,

599
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,410
no one is going to watch
this fucking special and go.

600
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:01,690
I thought it was funny until
I saw an errant hair is here.

601
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,210
Just sweating just isn't funny.
Yeah. Back of his neck is just,

602
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:09,250
the hairs is uncanny. So wet. I
just didn't like it. I'm gonna call,

603
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,770
I'm gonna call it wet to get,
get a look at this Guy Steve Kennedy.

604
00:35:12,771 --> 00:35:15,980
Cause that's where every UFC fighters
body's going to look like after drug

605
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,230
testing becomes 100% implemented.

606
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:22,370
We're all going to look like steam shop.
I looked like Roy Nelson.

607
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,730
Damn Bro.
What do you want me to do?

608
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,280
Yo Dude fighter and the
kid.com shut the fuck up.

609
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,870
His marijuana considered a no,
you're good.

610
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,110
It's only the week of the fight. Yes. Oh
really? Yeah. Only the week of the fight.

611
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:40,230
So you can get caught smoking weed and
they're not going to touch you for weed

612
00:35:40,231 --> 00:35:43,920
unless it's the weekend. Wow.
This is the question I have.

613
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,550
So you know how they say they're going
to test you five times throughout the

614
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:47,820
year.

615
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,450
So if I fight 3:00 AM I getting tested
eight or does that count as part as the

616
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,090
five? That's a good question.
That's a very good question.

617
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,750
I think they said five randoms throughout
the year, so it does it not count,

618
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,940
you know? I mean he's bummed me out.

619
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:04,680
One of the things bums me out is it,

620
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,890
this is going to cost a fuck
load of money to go after,

621
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,830
you know all these different guys for
using performance enhancing drugs.

622
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:15,820
The fighters that money I, that's
what I'm going to say. Sorry.

623
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,990
Yeah, it needs to be said,
man. It needs to be said.

624
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,590
Can you imagine if they started
drug testing and standup comedy?

625
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,600
What would happen?
They would make sure that you were on.

626
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,330
We'd then make sure you do it.
You get suspended.

627
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:30,270
If you weren't using cocaine and
marijuana matching your suspension,

628
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:34,440
Bro Plain you, they suspended you if you
smoke pot because it made you too funny.

629
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:37,590
It's definitely a performance
enhancing drug when it comes to comedy.

630
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:41,880
I write all my best shit on weed. By
the way, I got these new vape pens,

631
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,530
Goddamn to the pump. Dignity. Really? Who
makes a big fan of vape pens these days?

632
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,430
I don't know. Make some, I don't
read them. Start Smoking that shit.

633
00:36:50,431 --> 00:36:53,220
You just open them up. Open them up.
Why don't you make your own fuck.

634
00:36:53,221 --> 00:36:57,090
Other people don't want to get in that
business. That business is sneaky.

635
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:01,560
Like you gotta be real careful because
it's federally illegal and when you make

636
00:37:01,561 --> 00:37:04,920
a shit ton of money and we're going to
come after you take it all away and if

637
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:08,590
you're like me and you like to talk a lot
of shit, some things he'd get up. Yeah,

638
00:37:08,591 --> 00:37:09,424
I'm kidding.

639
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,250
People can get upset and they can find
the fact that get an example of you and

640
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:17,520
all that. Yeah. It's one thing if you'd
like to smoke a little weed personally,

641
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,930
that makes me feel,
but if you're selling it and making it,

642
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:23,040
then you don't need to. Yeah. You
don't need to get in that business.

643
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:26,790
It's also like a level of wealth that
I'm not sure you really want to get to.

644
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm not sure you want to get to a level
of wealth where everyone knows your

645
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,990
worth $1 billion and you have to
drive around with fucking garbage.

646
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,610
Like whenever I look at
Lorenzo Fertitta and he has,

647
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:39,840
he's fucking former seals around them all
the time with earpieces Noz fuck cause

648
00:37:39,841 --> 00:37:41,410
you gotta worry about
going to kidnap them.

649
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,420
I can take an eye answer
and being a sex slave,

650
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,170
the dudes that fucking guard
Lorenzo Fertitta or legit as fuck.

651
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,630
Yeah, you look in their eyes
and like these are dudes.

652
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:55,630
It will kill you with a pencil. 100%.
You, you know there's one, you're,

653
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,180
there's a service as a service. Whether
if you're going to do like a, I dunno,

654
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:04,290
something like climb mount Everest or do
some crazy fucking kayak trip or go to

655
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:05,340
Brazil.
You can,

656
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:09,210
you pay a monthly fee and they will pick
you up and rescue wherever you're at in

657
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:10,890
the world.
There's only a certain light,

658
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:13,320
they won't go to Syria and they
won't go to like Afghanistan.

659
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:15,480
But other than that,
anywhere in the world you're covered.

660
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,200
It's only like $175 a month
or some shit. Yeah. Good.

661
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:23,130
It's got to be way more than that. No, no,
no, it's not. It's only more than that.

662
00:38:23,131 --> 00:38:25,860
If you're doing some like crazy shit
and you tell them ahead of time,

663
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:30,990
but so membership, so what do you have to
do it where Fr. RFID chip. No, check it.

664
00:38:30,991 --> 00:38:33,810
You have to have one of those satellite
phones like those big ass satellite

665
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,210
phone, which a small price to pay a
pretty small. Now we used one one.

666
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,730
We're in Montana hunting. There's,
they're shrinking. What are we doing?

667
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:42,460
Another hunting trip. Let's schedule
it. What do you want to kill?

668
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,860
What do you want to let me
shoot some shit? Yeah. You
want to get in? Yeah. Okay.

669
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,370
You know we should get killed
my hands. We should. Oh Jesus.

670
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,860
He should all go to to hone ranch
and go shoot some pigs. All right,

671
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,150
because it's an hour and a half. That's
great. I don't eat swine, but I'm down.

672
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,670
No, I'm just kidding. I'll eat. I'll
eat some days. Well, they don't.

673
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,760
It's hard to get bacon because bacon
really comes from an animal that's been

674
00:39:03,761 --> 00:39:06,910
overfed and fattened up. The
pigs eat. Oh, that guy's lit.

675
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,290
I'm not trying to eat a skinny plan. He's,
he's got his, he's not coming after him.

676
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,980
Yeah, he doesn't. His head goes up when
he gets thrown him. His Chin goes up,

677
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,420
but the pigs that you're going to get her,
you're going to be way leaner.

678
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,990
But the hams are fantastic. These pigs
in such good shape. I don't like that.

679
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:27,690
Wild as fuck. Now. All right.
Now this guy, red rash shorts.

680
00:39:27,691 --> 00:39:30,820
He's going to knock this guy
out. Black. It's black as fuck.

681
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,890
I don't want to be no lag.
Pig may see a white.

682
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,400
Every now and then you see like a
white spotted one or around one,

683
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:38,770
but most of them are black. So you know
what the demonstrating you and me is.

684
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:42,250
I won't make them my pet. Bring
it home. I have pets are ready.

685
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,950
Thank you very much. You do have a
shitload of pets. I've got a few pets.

686
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,390
I got chickens, I got cats and
I'll shoot some shit or oral all.

687
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:52,210
I'll be like the dog he has won't need
one of those dogs. Those point 'em out.

688
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,400
I remember when I was doing Kirsty alleys,
TV show,

689
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:59,150
I went to her house and she had to
blind lemurs. She had a Shitload,

690
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,780
a Chinchillas who thousand dogs,
cats,

691
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:06,810
and she had a huge desert hair
in the middle of her lit bedroom.

692
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,740
It was fensten and it
couldn't use its back legs,

693
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,740
so it had to drag itself until you
show how rich you are to people.

694
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,690
How much random ass PECI.
That's me carrying a bear
out of the woods on my back.

695
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:23,650
That shot with a bow and
arrow. Damn, that is all man.

696
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,490
So mixed on that in Alberta.

697
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:32,350
I sat there that night.
Brittany, defendant has a
bond. You need to frame this.

698
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:36,310
Let me say that. That's
a 250 seat. I was there.

699
00:40:36,311 --> 00:40:39,010
I'd be in the back and here's
Brennan tears. Just crying.

700
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:44,160
Terrified 100 yards through the woods,
over dead falls with that bear.

701
00:40:44,161 --> 00:40:47,750
I'm as crazy. No one's got your shoulder.
Oh am I totally didn't get hurt.

702
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,800
How much did that thing way to 50 my
shoulder was hurt from more from is about

703
00:40:53,801 --> 00:40:58,740
that bears your size motherfucker. For
real though, my shoulder was hurting.

704
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:03,070
Benching phase. I think benching is
really what I did. It just flat bench.

705
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,380
Very young shoulders.
Is that right?

706
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:09,820
Inclined bench man or dumped just a well
Subotica got the rear naked and one arm

707
00:41:09,821 --> 00:41:13,600
trapped. Wow. Oh this is
over because it's a crank.

708
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:15,700
He's turning away from the choke,
which is,

709
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,370
you know as long as you could
really pin your neck down.

710
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,750
It's a real crank right now though. That
shit. He's pretty map. He's fine now.

711
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:26,260
He's more wrapped up now. He's more
wrapped up. Good position on that page.

712
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,260
I love that body triangle, man.
That body triangle is so good.

713
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:33,100
See I did not in MMA because how are you
get, what are you going to transition?

714
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:37,040
A blue belt can defend the rear naked
choke with those giant gloves on so we

715
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:40,970
feel body triangle can't transition
anytime. You can really SAP a guys will.

716
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:44,680
I agree. You can control your breathing,
especially if you go belly down. Yeah.

717
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,570
If you could turn that guy and get them
belly down with that body triangle. God,

718
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:48,331
that's so nasty.

719
00:41:48,331 --> 00:41:53,331
He gets it like Ken shamrock and now
Peter [inaudible] bad mother fucker Dean

720
00:41:53,721 --> 00:41:57,620
list or in his corner that day and you
know that motherfucker can't choke wrong.

721
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:00,200
Dean lister had been looking for
his neck for the past six years.

722
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,400
It's just find it. It's just
head, shoulders. He's his thing,

723
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,120
man. I met him at the metaphors. I
couldn't believe how thick he was.

724
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,850
Shy Has Josh Barnett tapped him?

725
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,120
How about Josh Barnett tapped
him to talk to your boy. He,

726
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,210
Ron Dude Barnett Barnett,

727
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,720
other the best catch wrestler of all time.
All time.

728
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,810
Really so impressive that it was better.
He tapped dean lister and any tap here,

729
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,190
dean. He tapped d. First of all,

730
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:32,570
people say Dean listers never been
tapped out in training and he's 16 years,

731
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:35,330
never been tapped out in training.
He's never been tapped out and cognition.

732
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,310
Fucking ed, he got tapped with like
of headaches, the neck crank, crank.

733
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,610
He got him in that judo headlock.
Fuck. It's silent Trojan motherfucker.

734
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,590
See his next fight. Who was he
fighting? Roy Nelson. Japan son. Ooh,

735
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,970
I like it. I'm not going to fight that
or UFC like it. What'd you just say?

736
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,640
Not Ufc or US close. Once you
grab some bench, take a break.

737
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,980
What are you talking about? To
understand what the sport, I mean,

738
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,390
fuck the UFC guys. I don't
know. Look at Dean lister.

739
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,800
I can't believe you've never been
tapped in practice even. That's cool.

740
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,720
Josh Martin. I said, oh, that's cool.
Check this out. That was a slick move.

741
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,850
You see the way he set that,
that a rear naked up we, he,

742
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,170
he made them defend one arm to sy.
Set them up for the second one.

743
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,840
He turned away from the one
arm into the second arm.

744
00:43:17,841 --> 00:43:19,500
So Baba knows what the
fuck he's doing with that.

745
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,410
He like it almost like he fed them the
one arm so that he would turn away from

746
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:27,320
it and then slip the second one under
the chin. I'm not mad at that shirt.

747
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:31,760
Very nice. Here's a little tip. See, I
saw giggle. I don't take heat for this,

748
00:43:31,761 --> 00:43:34,760
but bear with me here. When
Daniel Cormier, I saw him,

749
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,560
he's The new light heavyweight champion,
right?

750
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:40,340
And UFC selling his shirts and
then as soon as July 1st kicks in,

751
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:43,620
Reebok's going to design the
shirts. If I'm Daniel Cormier, oh,

752
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,270
I'm Conor McGregor or Ronda Rousey,
one of these mega stars,

753
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:51,710
why won't you have your own website and
create your own shirts and sell the fuck

754
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:52,100
out of them,

755
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,520
reap all your own benefits and that you're
speaking like a businessman. You're,

756
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:59,030
you're a smart dude and you have the
ambition to do that kind of stuff.

757
00:43:59,031 --> 00:44:01,910
But a lot of guys don't. They just
hire someone to do it. You're right,

758
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,750
you're right. How about
you? Why don't you do it?

759
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,530
Maybe that's a good side business for you.
I don't know.

760
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,420
I mean I would get my own shit.
Fucking savage.

761
00:44:08,421 --> 00:44:11,840
You got a little too much going on selling
about 8,000 t shirts and 20 minutes.

762
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:15,320
I always text you right away like Joe,
check it out.

763
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,070
They'll put up these shirts for
sale and self souses in minutes.

764
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:26,990
And I'm like thinking about the numbers,
I was just plus expenses. Holy Shit.

765
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:32,370
That's real legit money and
nothing gets me more excited. Oh,

766
00:44:32,371 --> 00:44:35,370
it's when they sell. I'm literally
jumping around sweating. Well,

767
00:44:35,371 --> 00:44:37,530
when I was at Brian's,
I'm taping.

768
00:44:37,531 --> 00:44:39,990
The fucking audience was
filled with your tee shirts.

769
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:43,860
Everything was fighter and the kid.
I think you'd be surprised.

770
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,330
There's so many different shirts. Crazy
audience is amazing. It's really cool.

771
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,920
He shot like fourth one's drop in our
show. Dope. I love what you're wearing.

772
00:44:52,921 --> 00:44:56,370
An American flag type shit.
Red, white and blue tank.

773
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,320
And then we've got the master Kim shirt,
but in red, white and blue. It's so dope.

774
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:03,930
I'm like, awesome. Yeah. Anyways.

775
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,360
Ooh. He handed it to her. I cooking.
I'll tell him you did y'all.

776
00:45:09,361 --> 00:45:12,330
I need some fucking priming Joe Rogan
shirts. I'm always rocking my winter.

777
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,410
I kind of, I gotta be honest. I feel
like a tool rocked in my own shit.

778
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,120
I know what you mean. That's what I'm
saying. You never seen me wear my shirts,

779
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,670
nor do I even talk about them.
That's a real problem.

780
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:24,210
I have a Goddamn tee shirt company and
I never had to advertise it like three

781
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:27,300
times. But you do well with it. It makes
great money. When I was talking to you,

782
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:29,940
it goes all the time. I didn't
even, I didn't even know
he sold shirts. I was like,

783
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,290
what you gotta do bro? You got to
do this. You're like, motherfucker,

784
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,930
I've been selling shirts
forever. I'm like, Oh really?

785
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:41,490
Regina has a pretty boxer.
She wished she can't box.

786
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,770
He's got teeth. Fuck
yeah, guys, your boxes.

787
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,230
Fat did badly care. I love athletes. Oh,

788
00:45:49,231 --> 00:45:53,710
I sure would show her a good time.
Right guys I share with you guys.

789
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:58,470
What's her? She pulls her pussy
lips apart and brushes her teeth.

790
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,370
She gets a fucking one of those
little waterpiks down there.

791
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,290
Ah Man. I'll tell you what the struggle
is real with girl. What is her name?

792
00:46:10,291 --> 00:46:15,210
Regina is, it is so real. I love
girls, man. It's a fucking curse.

793
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,810
Well, they're better than dudes when
it comes to having sex with them.

794
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,160
You got to do what you got to do. They
don't. There's a reason opposites attract.

795
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,050
Right. They don't look like you see it
at what point? I just attracted to one.

796
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:31,740
You know what I'm saying?
Fucking curse. You feel me? Yeah.

797
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:34,410
That's problem to being attracted
to one. It's very difficult. Yeah.

798
00:46:34,411 --> 00:46:37,380
I love all different kinds of women.
There's also,

799
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,650
then there's also the problem
of just getting along. You know,

800
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,050
everybody has a fucking
different sensibility, man.

801
00:46:43,051 --> 00:46:46,470
Men and women see thinks so goddamn
differently. Different goals,

802
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,210
truly different needs, different think
different things that pissed them off.

803
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:54,210
You know what hurts my feelings is
girls that I've dated before, we've,

804
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:58,860
we dated for years, even lived together
and now just cause whatever. We're not,

805
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,980
you know, still intimate in
relationship. We're not friends anymore,

806
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,530
but you just get us thinking
about the time you've not wasted,

807
00:47:04,531 --> 00:47:07,860
but you spent all those years together. To
me, I'm like, no, let's still be friends,

808
00:47:07,861 --> 00:47:12,200
but they can't do it, man. Some of them
can't be. But you can eat the arms. Yeah,

809
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:15,750
because he used to send it in there and
shoot loads inside their body and they

810
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:20,751
loved it around you in the man I love
you and they feel your back wall of the

811
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,553
path.

812
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,680
They feel that crease where the spine
is and the the muscles wrap around the

813
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:30,310
valley cause muscle valley

814
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,400
shop does that thing where he lies on
his back and he puts the weight bar here

815
00:47:33,401 --> 00:47:38,050
and he does those fuck exercises
load that puts them up on Instagram.

816
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,270
400 pounds.

817
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,520
One more set. One more.
One more Rep. Meanwhile,

818
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,960
Rampage's trainer I follow
Rampage's his trainer on Instagram.

819
00:47:55,961 --> 00:48:00,340
It's a woman with an ass created by God.
What's the name please?

820
00:48:00,341 --> 00:48:03,920
Juliet something or another? I
don't know her name. Oh good.

821
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:07,630
Well I mean I guess she's only
doing squats for houses. Retarded,

822
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,860
retarded and she does 400
pounds at that exercise.

823
00:48:11,861 --> 00:48:16,090
That same exercises you overdose of it.
Videos of it. Undeniable. The face though,

824
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,050
she's pretty, she's not ugly at all.
She's pretty, but it, you don't even care.

825
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:21,410
I'm going to slip on the heard them.

826
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,360
Dean thinks she's married and she
has children that had been there.

827
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,770
Her ass is ridiculous. It's ridiculous.
But she does that same thing.

828
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,460
She has like a yoga mat that she uh,

829
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,040
has rolled up next to the bench so she
could pull it up here and she puts her

830
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,350
elbows on the bench cause
she can't get under it.

831
00:48:38,351 --> 00:48:41,770
Like she's not as strong as you to get
under it. But once she gets under it,

832
00:48:41,771 --> 00:48:46,530
it's on, let me find it. I'll find it for
you. Yeah, that's fine. That the shell.

833
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:48,100
Yeah. I get dead serious. I'm like,

834
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,200
I should be on Instagram and you'll see
a girl's ass and I'll be like, God damn,

835
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:56,020
I don't care where I'm at. You
just, it's like so frustrating.

836
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,600
It's like seeing a dope ass car.
Exactly.

837
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,310
And then I'll go to their fucking webpage
or I'll go to their Instagram page and

838
00:49:03,311 --> 00:49:07,450
you find out that they have 7
million followers can all it is,

839
00:49:07,451 --> 00:49:11,320
is pictures of their ass girls get way
more followers on Instagram than they do

840
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:16,090
is look up there. Yeah. That's
her find the one when she's doing,

841
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,900
find the one when she's doing
that. A, that's a strong gal.

842
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,650
That critter got to shit or honor. Oh
yeah, sure. You gotta wait, check Jamie.

843
00:49:23,651 --> 00:49:28,200
Find the one where she's in
there doing the, the fucking, oh,

844
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:32,870
that's rampages.
Well,

845
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:37,400
she's got a page. What does
it said, Juliet? What? Yeah,

846
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:39,920
but I'm telling you that she has a page.
So what is it?

847
00:49:39,921 --> 00:49:44,830
What does that say that they had
at Juliet Lynn 82. All right.

848
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,230
I'll find it. Hold on the
sheet. She's not that. Don't,

849
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,680
this is going to be interesting.
There's nothing better than a nice ass.

850
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:57,690
Hudson was this cat is this
Seaver and Jerry are ready.

851
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,870
That's the cove Maine. How the
fuck is that happening? Are Ready.

852
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:03,360
This is a short night.

853
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,690
It's a great deal of,
Ooh.

854
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:16,610
How about that Forman Bella
tour tournament coming up
in September. I know, right?

855
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,560
What is that? It's uh, who
is it? It's a saw king,

856
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,450
Mo and filled day manual.
Newton King Mo. Phil Davis.

857
00:50:23,451 --> 00:50:28,010
And he's the last guy or the fourth guy?
Yeah, he's a baldheaded. One night. Well,

858
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,650
one night, right? Yeah. They're
all fighting one night. Yeah.

859
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:34,280
Four man tournament in one night.
God Damn you Scott Coker.

860
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:38,450
You Genius Bella Tours
trying some experiments. Huh?

861
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:41,360
I'm not mad at to mix it up cause you
gotta do some cause you're not going to

862
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:43,610
give with the UFC count
for towel tell you this,

863
00:50:43,611 --> 00:50:46,010
the front patio or the
comedy store last night,

864
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,390
everybody was waiting for that shamrock.
Everyone loves Kimbo man.

865
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,900
And it garnered attention and you know,

866
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,210
I don't see the UFC up on that TV
as much at like, I mean that often,

867
00:50:59,211 --> 00:51:03,260
but you know that gets, that gets a
different crowd watching for sure.

868
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:06,260
You know what I mean? I agree. I
think they're doing it. Smart man.

869
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:10,850
I've never even really seen Bella
tour in the past like year until,

870
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,370
uh, until last night and I was really
surprised about those WWF engines.

871
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:20,510
It's fun though, Huh? Yeah. They're not
quite doing it right? I don't think so.

872
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:21,400
We'll see you Mickey.

873
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,910
It is and I don't think they see what
works about the WWF sentences that they're

874
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:30,800
not doing. Like it's cool the production
value but a little too much. Right.

875
00:51:30,801 --> 00:51:33,440
It's Corny as fuck.
Have the guys walking in and fight.

876
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,810
It's not sense the entertainment.

877
00:51:37,530 --> 00:51:41,930
It's not though don't it is. I think
the UFC came to the right conclusion.

878
00:51:41,931 --> 00:51:44,930
They taught about it and they said,
you know what? We can get more seats.

879
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,560
We could sit more people in here
without this. They're really great.

880
00:51:48,561 --> 00:51:51,440
Seats are important to get rid of this
ramp and plus we're spending all this

881
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:55,550
money on pyrotechnics and shit for what
and then they decide to be awesome.

882
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,930
I don't think it's awesome, man.
I don't, I think the UFC is more,

883
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,650
it's looked more as a legit sway,

884
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,860
more towards more of a spectacle
but it sure, okay, what do you do?

885
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:10,070
You can go talent for talent. Do you
see this is what you do. You Poach.

886
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:14,180
What bell torn needs to do is do some
of that Goddamn Viacom money and take

887
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:16,490
advantage of this, this
route. Reebok thing,

888
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,780
this Reebok thing that has a lot of
fighters that are going to lose a shitload

889
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,910
of money. Here she is. Look
at this. Come on, son. Wow.

890
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,830
Fuck did I say wow girls, no joke. There's
a bunch of videos of her doing that.

891
00:52:27,831 --> 00:52:32,210
She, she's letting you
know, man. She's t man. Oh,

892
00:52:32,211 --> 00:52:34,570
I would do serious things to her.
No,

893
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,690
you would fuck the shit out of [inaudible]
and she would open up a window and

894
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:43,490
shoot it and trash guy with her pussy.
She would pull her dick off,

895
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:48,520
pull your dick off with her vagina and
this guy opened up the window sticker

896
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:53,420
pussy. Tanium she'd kill a
bird with it. She's in. Shit.

897
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:56,390
I'm going to start doing now is what does
access. I've got to start doing that.

898
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,740
What's the benefit of that exercise?
Work your ass, hips and glutes.

899
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:02,870
It gets you ready to fuck fat shall
be good for your sprawl, right? Yeah.

900
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:06,170
Great for your sprawl. Good. Good for
hip mobility or look at that booty.

901
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:10,130
Look at that booty. Yeah.
It's a ridiculous booty. No,
no, no. Go down. Scroll down.

902
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,950
Look at that. Why did Jesus Christ?
That's good, but it's black.

903
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,380
It's hard to see because of the blackness.
Scroll down a little.

904
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:17,600
There's one little further,
little further. She gets it.

905
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,220
She gets up tickle biddies to that.

906
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,090
That is a fucking validify booty and

907
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,400
I'm not mad at that. Good for her.
Congratulations on your wonderful body.

908
00:53:29,401 --> 00:53:32,730
Congrats. Yeah. Oh, she
trains hard. Well, she's,

909
00:53:32,731 --> 00:53:37,350
rampage is a strength and conditioning
trainer. I guess. Rampage has a gym. Yeah,

910
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:39,360
he does. Right. And a Orange County? Yeah.

911
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,110
What does it's called like Rampage's
fitness or something like rampage for him.

912
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,900
Good for him.
I'm glad he's invested his money.

913
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,220
He's still dealing with that litigation
bullshit, right? With belter? Yup.

914
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:51,413
What is that about?

915
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,420
Bella tours signed him and then
they violated their contracts.

916
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:58,140
So the judge released him.
They put an injunction. Judge,

917
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:03,090
Judge List lifted the injunction.
He fought for the UFC.

918
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:06,000
Everybody loved him. Fought
Fabio Maldonado. Great fight.

919
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:11,300
And then they got a new injunction and
so there's a new legal issue going on at

920
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,670
the table. What? They had to
release his contract. Revelatory.

921
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,540
That thing was Beastie. Yeah.
He's making a lot of money.

922
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:22,920
Are you allowed to hang a banner if,
if, if you're under the Reebok deal,

923
00:54:22,921 --> 00:54:25,350
can you hang a banner? He
came to that sober. Wow.

924
00:54:25,590 --> 00:54:28,620
Not only that you have to wear Reebok
closed the entire week of fight cannon.

925
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:32,970
He yells, show up and fight when
Reebok pumps. Oh my God. Wow.

926
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:37,480
Um, you know what man, forcing
me to get her Bible. Ted,

927
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,420
it's an open Barb wire run
your bicep fucking tramp stamp.

928
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:47,010
I'd rather just get a Reebok trance.
Then we're rebounding nineties tattoos.

929
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:48,303
The um,

930
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:53,310
the thing about it is that it's opening
up the door for belter in a big way.

931
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:57,480
If they can show that they can come up
with a lot of money for you in a contract

932
00:54:57,481 --> 00:54:59,970
and let you get your own sponsors
like the way it used to be,

933
00:55:00,310 --> 00:55:04,560
they'll change the fucking game because
all you need is a few of those guys jump

934
00:55:04,561 --> 00:55:08,670
over. Davis was the first
man. Yeah. But Phil, he was a,

935
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,760
from all due respect, Phil was a
free agent. With all due respect.

936
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,880
Phil was not really a threat for
the title. It's just not, you know,

937
00:55:14,881 --> 00:55:17,200
you watch the Anthony Rumble
Johnson beat him up. It's,

938
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,420
it's hard and Jon Jones is going
to see Ryan Bader beat him.

939
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,490
It's like, I don't know. I mean he could
beat Machida and he beat Gustafsson.

940
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:30,670
He did. He did. But he beat Gustafsson
very early in his career. My submission.

941
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,230
It's true. And that when a guy
named Sheila with beat Glover tech,

942
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:38,340
he said he'd be wrangled him a cheeto
did and clover clover trained for that

943
00:55:38,341 --> 00:55:41,270
Shit and Connecticut and his backyard.
I'm just saying literally beats it.

944
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:44,100
I know he did. He but he beat
some top top guys. Don't look.

945
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:46,800
Phil Davis is a tough guy,
but no one thinks of him.

946
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:48,360
The way they think about rumble over.

947
00:55:48,361 --> 00:55:51,060
They think about Daniel that
like he might be, you know,

948
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,450
is a real shot at the title.
So him going over to bell tours,

949
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,780
not the biggest loss you're saying
we need like, exactly. Exactly.

950
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,920
Word Aldo went over to Bella tour.
How about this?

951
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:06,650
I'll go and Borow of Henan Borow how bout
if Hanan Barao Beats Tj Dillashaw and

952
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:08,640
then goes over to belt or,
I mean that's craziness.

953
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,070
If they get a few guys
like that and by the way,

954
00:56:11,071 --> 00:56:13,620
they have fucking that
fucking pretracheal pit bull.

955
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:18,010
Did you see that fight last night and
came back, came back and CalEd them.

956
00:56:18,011 --> 00:56:23,010
That was a wild ass fucking advice. Now
I saw some good spots with a belt tour.

957
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:24,580
Violence.
See like any powerhouse

958
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,190
sponsors. I'm surprised that
everyone's not jumping the train yet.

959
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,910
They need more numbers, you know.
And the last thing, he's good. Yeah,

960
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:32,980
I'm sure it was.
They need to bail on that fucking name.

961
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:36,820
Bella tours a stupid name. Yeah, I'm not
a fan of it. What does ballot tour mean?

962
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:41,800
It's like like warrior and Latin or
using a dead language about that tour.

963
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,540
I don't know.
Let's find out cause I'm talking shit.

964
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,820
I don't really know what the
actual name for sure. Switch it up.

965
00:56:45,821 --> 00:56:49,310
There'll be a little more professional.
It should be spike MMA. I just like,

966
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:54,550
just like, you know, showtime has
showtime boxing. Hbo Is Hbo Boxing,

967
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,540
MMA. Viacom fighting. What?

968
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,390
Make it more professional, man.
It. What is the name? Good.

969
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,490
That's an interesting senior way. What I
was right. Brandon, what do we do here?

970
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:09,450
Okay. It's warrior in
Latin. Dennis Seaver,

971
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,800
but it's hard for to Seaver
to fucking get motivated.

972
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:16,330
After Connor Mcgregor stole his soul.
You see that fight in Boston?

973
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,230
He looks so slow. You need
to see walks so slow. Crazy.

974
00:57:20,231 --> 00:57:24,310
Mcgregor walked him down and beat the fuck
out of him. I know you can't pick Joe,

975
00:57:24,311 --> 00:57:26,900
but uh, Tony, Brian, honey. See Connor,

976
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,370
I chose a hick kind of go there.
I,

977
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,390
he doesn't know. There's no
idea. I mean, if I had to really,

978
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,390
if I had to really put you on the other
line, if I had to put money on it,

979
00:57:37,391 --> 00:57:39,310
I would put,
I would put money on,

980
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,630
on Connor because I feel like there's so
much momentum and he has so much belief

981
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:47,830
and I feel in some ways maybe he's
inside Josias had, can I, can I do,

982
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,770
can I help you out here? So you
think he has more belief than Josie?

983
00:57:50,771 --> 00:57:55,000
It guy was at Lawson did nine years. 10
pound best in the world. 10 year, 10 now.

984
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:58,820
Yeah. Yeah. A little bit
more belief than Josie.

985
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:01,330
Elder look at Aldo has
massive belief in himself,

986
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:04,140
so don't question not better camp.
All those beaten.

987
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,380
Everybody they put in front of them.

988
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:08,890
Here's the best leg kicks maybe in
the world and now he's motive MMA.

989
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:09,871
His leg kicks us.

990
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:14,410
So God damn fast and nasty professional
level soccer player and he has that

991
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:19,270
ridiculous fucking hip snap because of
that. Some of the best takedown defense.

992
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,590
Spectacular.

993
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:25,090
The only thing about Aldo is he's had a
lot of fights and he's had a lot of wars

994
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:28,180
in the gym.
A lot of like tough rounds in fighting.

995
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:31,270
You know that last Chad Mendez fight was
probably the toughest fight he's ever

996
00:58:31,271 --> 00:58:35,230
had inside the octagon. True
Mendez cracked him man to
man his punishment. Yeah.

997
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:39,130
Men has hit him. Some bombs and
men has can hit fucking hard man.

998
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:40,810
You see that Ricardo Lamas fight.

999
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:44,800
You see the hardest hit her
in that division by farm
and he cautioned and Josie

1000
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:48,820
Aldo took that and still what he says he
did twice and I'll go drop them in that

1001
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:52,990
first round sort of illegal cause.
Kind of like after the above is tough.

1002
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,010
The crack a little loud.

1003
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:57,580
She had caught Connor's taller and I
feel like his hands are probably better.

1004
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:01,790
Well, he's never fought anybody
remotely as good as all doses,

1005
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:05,110
not even close level of competition.
Now that's true.

1006
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:08,920
If I'm putting money on it in Vegas,
yeah, I'm going to Jose Aldo all day,

1007
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:13,090
but personally for the UFC,
since I'm team UFC,

1008
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,610
I want Connor to win.
If Connor wins,

1009
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:18,580
he's the biggest star of the
UFC is the habit of Aldo wins.

1010
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,180
It shows everybody what a fucking monster
they'd been sleeping on it. Yeah. Right.

1011
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,460
But then what do you do with Khan
announced a gimmick. We built,

1012
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:28,430
he rebuilds depends on how he loses.
Here's my thing.

1013
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:32,390
I think it's brilliant that they have
Connor fighting Aldo right away like this,

1014
00:59:32,391 --> 00:59:35,330
because the reality is we have
not seen Conor fight a wrestler.

1015
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,150
If you see Conor in there with a Frankie
Edgar Connor in the air with the Chad,

1016
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:42,860
tough favor. Never. No,
ma'am. Wrestlers can be a bit,

1017
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:44,330
you never know what they could do to him.

1018
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,430
You never know if they could
take him down at smother him.

1019
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:51,530
Look at the way Frankie Edgar stole cubs.
Watson's fucking Amil just stole it.

1020
00:59:51,531 --> 00:59:55,610
Asher body. They don't want
that cause that Clay Guido,

1021
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,310
Anthony Pettis,
remember that you don't want that.

1022
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:00,720
And that's what [inaudible]
did to him to this. Exactly.

1023
01:00:00,721 --> 01:00:04,310
But does on with better stand
up. Yes. So, but the thing is,

1024
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:08,510
it's going to be rough for Connor. As
long as he makes it a fight, we're good.

1025
01:00:08,511 --> 01:00:11,540
If he goes in and gets fucking
dismantled, then it's like, oh my God,

1026
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,180
this shit talking. It's embarrassing.
He's so big and so strong.

1027
01:00:14,181 --> 01:00:17,150
I don't think he's going to get
dismantled, but I think it's a fight, man.

1028
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,500
It's a fucking hell of a fight.

1029
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,340
I think Connor has gotten
a little too confident.

1030
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,400
I think he's wearing sunglasses indoors
and shit now his thing or the show

1031
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:28,450
wrestling fan,

1032
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:33,440
but most of those guys come in and
sunglasses when after they have the belt,

1033
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,040
he's wearing the sunglasses indoors
before the belt. You gotta wait,

1034
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,460
you gotta pay your dues.
He's almost back to sunglasses.

1035
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,800
That's why mentality and it's going
to ruin this whole fight podcast.

1036
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,610
I'll do you bring this up. We'll shoot
it. How agiri on top with Dennis.

1037
01:00:48,611 --> 01:00:50,810
He re look at this,
but it's not pro wrestling.

1038
01:00:50,811 --> 01:00:53,870
It's high school wrestling
that I'm talking about here
because I think I'll does

1039
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,280
going to do to macgregor.

1040
01:00:55,281 --> 01:00:58,890
What core me did the Johnson all
not a wrestler on that level though.

1041
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:02,450
Does that Jujitsu guys a big difference
between wrestling and he's going to try

1042
01:01:02,451 --> 01:01:04,880
to knock them out. You're bat
shit. You're bat shit crazy though.

1043
01:01:04,881 --> 01:01:08,210
If you think it gets into grappling match
at is not going to get taken down or

1044
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:13,250
out Jujitsu. I believe that all those
Jujitsu is so fucking underrated.

1045
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:15,180
Is that goodwill class,

1046
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,940
that world class he beat Cabrina.
Oh,

1047
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:26,000
shut the fuck up. Police guys.
He's guys, I'm sorry. He's beaten.

1048
01:01:26,001 --> 01:01:29,680
Worldclass black belts. Let's just say
that in straight Jujitsu concentration.

1049
01:01:29,690 --> 01:01:32,650
Jujitsu. He's, he's elite. I
mean when you watch a movie,

1050
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:35,750
you watch his Mike Brown fight. When
you fought Mike Brown for the WEC title,

1051
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:40,190
he takes his back like a ghost gets those
hooks in and just [inaudible] you're

1052
01:01:40,191 --> 01:01:43,370
going know when you're a kid. Second
on your mom's titty. He was an ag.

1053
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,400
That's how long he's been doing.
Shit. Big Difference. Accurate.

1054
01:01:46,401 --> 01:01:49,880
But he's been doing it a while.
My man, well he's explosion his,

1055
01:01:49,881 --> 01:01:54,800
his speed with those who kicks and
punches men older than me of the others.

1056
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,440
63 years old. No, you are a motherfucker.
Look at Seavers busted up cow. Caligiuri

1057
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:05,600
yeah, that's a great photo. You Dennis.
He runs a guy where I was talking,

1058
01:02:05,601 --> 01:02:08,990
I was doing this interview
with Crooklyn Stephie from,

1059
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:14,360
cause she's with bloody elbows. I would
you do like regular interviews with her.

1060
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,660
She's my friend.
Um,

1061
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:20,100
but we were talking about
Ken shamrock and Kimbo

1062
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,460
they were,

1063
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,540
they were on this pro ped rat and they
got cut off because both of them were

1064
01:02:24,541 --> 01:02:27,000
basically like, who gives a fuck?
Why don't you steroids you steroids.

1065
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:32,340
I'm thinking, why can't guys
like make an agreement? Like if,

1066
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:34,080
say like,
you know,

1067
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:38,970
if you got like Vitor Belfort and whoever
and they made an agreement to be able

1068
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:43,170
to use whatever the fuck they wanted.
And you know, you're both saying like,

1069
01:02:43,171 --> 01:02:47,880
can canon chemos proof example
41 and 51 super suspect if,

1070
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:51,360
and they fought in Missouri,
so did Bobby Lashley and Bobby,

1071
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:56,361
then Bobby Lashley always fights and
these strange places with fucking soup

1072
01:02:58,590 --> 01:03:02,040
propped up athletic
commissions. Yeah, I mean,

1073
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:06,510
I just think that there's not nothing
wrong with making an agreement like that.

1074
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,570
Well, you know what's weird to me
is like, you look at other sports,

1075
01:03:09,571 --> 01:03:13,440
like in baseball, if you get tested,
if he testifies for steroids,

1076
01:03:13,441 --> 01:03:17,400
your show fuck no hall of fame, you get
booed ever. We go look at Barry Bonds,

1077
01:03:17,401 --> 01:03:19,320
Alex Rodriguez, right? And
then sending all these records,

1078
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,620
if you get caught in the, in
the UFC, you're kind of fucked.

1079
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:25,740
You look at a guy like Rothko who
got caught or Alistair Overeem,

1080
01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:29,640
then they fight. Everyone kind of forgets.
It's whatever. You get cotton football,

1081
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:34,350
it's not a big deal. It's weird to me,
man. It's weird how we baseball's America.

1082
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,360
It's weird though. America's
not change. Damn it.

1083
01:03:37,361 --> 01:03:42,361
And you don't need to understand in your
mouth once a year looking all fucking

1084
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,650
Eurasian.
Oh look at all brown brown.

1085
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:53,460
I just think society needs to
be consistent. It shouldn't
matter. Right? Like if,

1086
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:57,840
cause baseball's a weird one man,
because it's like who gives a fuck? No,

1087
01:03:57,841 --> 01:04:00,240
you're batting the ball.
Bat speed.

1088
01:04:00,241 --> 01:04:03,540
You can keep playing and all up
into your thirties and no shit.

1089
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:04,850
I want to see home runs.

1090
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,910
I want them jacked on steroids to the
gills and crush and balls. Yeah, exactly.

1091
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:12,000
Like Sammy Sosa.
Mcgwire how dope was that?

1092
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,240
That was the only time that people
were excited. Yeah. Felt deflated.

1093
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:18,690
There's this weird old as well. How
about Sammy Sosa turn into a white guy?

1094
01:04:18,691 --> 01:04:22,010
What the fuck happened?
Michael Jackson's super crazy.

1095
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:25,170
I think in the collegiate to skin or
something. It's like a gray color.

1096
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:28,320
It's weird. It's dead. Yeah. He
looks like it was like a corpse.

1097
01:04:28,590 --> 01:04:32,450
It's just so weird how
the society bring up Sam.

1098
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:35,580
He says that when he first went into the
league and when and when he was two 40

1099
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:39,820
it's the difference is ridiculous.
Oh Martin. When we get my was wire,

1100
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:45,000
he was giant. He had the fucking
Paul boomer arms, thighs,

1101
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:49,330
forums where show Jen my thighs
with a hand at the end of it.

1102
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,160
That's what I want. Like Tony, you love
fucking bullshit wrestling pro lesson.

1103
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:57,510
You love that fake wrestling.
Now think if the drug test it was like,

1104
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:58,590
do you have seen they're all skinny?

1105
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:03,330
Is it as cool now you watch pro wrestling
cause are these characters they they

1106
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:06,300
look like superheroes. We'll see. I'm
takeaway drug tests and see second,

1107
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:07,770
here's a bad example,

1108
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:11,610
Doug cm punk is one of the
biggest wrestlers in the
world and he's 100% clean.

1109
01:05:11,611 --> 01:05:12,990
He's the exception.
But,

1110
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:18,010
but there's a went through at UFC
is going through back in that hall

1111
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:22,630
Cogan thing in the late mid,
mid, early nineties. It was huge.

1112
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:26,110
And so they had to eliminate it. They
had to, they have to do it themselves.

1113
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:30,400
They have like a super strict parole
say burrow. I'm serious. Super strict.

1114
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:35,470
And tell me, but Tiesta and the rock
are clean. No, watch your words sir.

1115
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:39,310
Come on. The Rock. The rocks on steroids.

1116
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:43,720
This is Tony.

1117
01:05:43,721 --> 01:05:48,721
You weigh six pounds and you're talking
about a guy who is an immense super app

1118
01:05:48,851 --> 01:05:52,810
is probably about two 60 is Brock Lesnar
on steroids. Of course they're all,

1119
01:05:52,811 --> 01:05:55,720
they've all done something.
They've all done. Brock Lesnar,

1120
01:05:55,721 --> 01:05:58,330
first of all has superior genetics.

1121
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,460
There'll be the phrase
structure that that guy has.

1122
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,740
You can go back to when Brock
Lesnar was in high school,

1123
01:06:02,741 --> 01:06:07,390
he was a fucking monster.
He benched two 25 49 times.

1124
01:06:07,391 --> 01:06:11,680
Yes. 49 we can see is Columbine is
calm down. My numbers are stupid.

1125
01:06:11,681 --> 01:06:14,860
Combined numbers are through the roof.
His vertical is insane.

1126
01:06:15,060 --> 01:06:17,290
Polite Brock Lesnar's combine numbers.
Jamie,

1127
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:21,340
all that said he got shitted on when
we get to the NFL, they made fun of it,

1128
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:24,290
wasn't ready for it and
he was playing football.

1129
01:06:24,310 --> 01:06:27,800
He's been doing wrestling fruits.

1130
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:31,660
Brock Lesnar's the super freak,
but back to bullshit wrestling.

1131
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:35,910
You don't think these guys cause pink
color schedules to their schedule is

1132
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:36,960
fucking insane.
Night.

1133
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,550
You're not eating protein shakes and
staying on that schedule. My mandate,

1134
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,960
the Piss on your sport or
your entertainment. I mean,

1135
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:48,730
well those guys are constantly not
getting enough sleep and it's a brutal,

1136
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:52,510
brutal schedule. You talked to Tony
who's in that business. It's brutal, man.

1137
01:06:52,511 --> 01:06:54,820
And after, a lot of times they
have to pay for themselves.

1138
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,520
You have to own rent cars
and then bill the company.

1139
01:06:57,521 --> 01:07:00,010
It's a brutal circus of shit.
Totally.

1140
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:02,740
You think triple h is
a fucking called clean.

1141
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:07,540
You don't get a neck like I an east.
I don't know what triple h is doing.

1142
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:11,110
I that's, that's an interesting
one. I mean, he's a fucking monster.

1143
01:07:11,111 --> 01:07:15,050
He shaped weird. What about Battista?
Dude, look, Patista is the word.

1144
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,490
I don't even acknowledge that Battista
was ever even in pro. He's so,

1145
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,800
he's so terrible. What are you
talking about? He was great.

1146
01:07:20,801 --> 01:07:25,270
And Guardians of the galaxy.
Phenomenal. Oh, Europe mess. No.

1147
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:30,330
How dare you now the guardians of the
galaxy disappointing to watch him talking.

1148
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:35,080
Shit. That movie was great.
Spotlight. You're out of your mind.

1149
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:40,660
What's a good movie? Mad Max was great
but didn't see it. I heard it was awesome.

1150
01:07:40,661 --> 01:07:43,510
We're going to fucking love it. You know
what? Too much action. You know it's dope.

1151
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:46,960
Dude did I didn't see until this weekend
when I was flying back from Mexico.

1152
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:50,690
John Wick, the Keanu Reeves movie,
the action will be replaced.

1153
01:07:51,380 --> 01:07:55,570
They kill his dog and he goes and
kills everybody. Really? Oh Hon.

1154
01:07:55,571 --> 01:08:00,250
They kill his dog. So he goes, no, no,
no. I'm not doing it. Justice. Revenge.

1155
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:03,640
They kill cells. Combine numbers. It's a
fucking phenomenal movie they're doing.

1156
01:08:03,641 --> 01:08:07,990
John Wick to look at is 44
seven 40 by the way, 283 pounds.

1157
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:12,910
Four seven 40 35 inch vertical jump,
long jump,

1158
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,710
10 feet standing,
jump,

1159
01:08:15,711 --> 01:08:18,710
10 feet bench press to 25 to 30 reps.

1160
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,820
Jesus fucking Christ,
a running back,

1161
01:08:22,821 --> 01:08:27,140
living in the body of a defensive end.
It's ridiculous. He's an ease of free.

1162
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,620
I gotta be honest, especially when he
did do that as a number of years ago.

1163
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,850
Now that's not that freakish.
Yeah, really, really.

1164
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,430
But you got to think about
if some fucking freaks.

1165
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:39,650
Now this isn't something
he was training for. No,

1166
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:44,150
this isn't the guy that was moving towards
towards being a pro fungicide to do

1167
01:08:44,151 --> 01:08:47,690
it. Brock Lesnar's is the biggest freak
the UFC has ever seen, ever, ever.

1168
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:50,180
Hands down if Brock are
dicks off right now,

1169
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,740
if Brock Lesnar had the right coach,
like if he went to a mat,

1170
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:57,550
not saying there's anything wrong
with his coaches, this is what I'm,

1171
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,830
what I'm saying is if he had the
right coach the right amount of time,

1172
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:04,430
like if you went to a Matt Hume
or a Foracia hobby and they,

1173
01:09:04,450 --> 01:09:09,440
they engineered his career
from the beginning to the
time he's being introduced

1174
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:12,860
to the UFC to the time he's
introduced to high level competition.

1175
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:16,470
He could have been an all
time. Yes. Paul's heavyweight,

1176
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:20,600
the capabilities he fought a former
heavyweight champion and his second

1177
01:09:20,601 --> 01:09:21,590
professional fight,

1178
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,130
he fought Frank Mir and his second
professional fight had no idea as a defend

1179
01:09:25,131 --> 01:09:28,730
against the leg lock. He got leg locked
mass. My favorite fighter of all time.

1180
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:30,650
Great fight.
Frank Mir is a bad motherfucker,

1181
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,980
but then in his third fight after that
he fights heath herring beats the shit

1182
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:34,814
out of heath.
Herring.

1183
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:39,230
Then he fights Randy fucking coture
stops Randy coture and his fourth

1184
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:40,750
professional fucking fights.
Yeah.

1185
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,850
But Randy couture was like
stuck in a wheelchair.

1186
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,900
Does or octagon and fucking Brock
Lesnar still. It doesn't matter.

1187
01:09:47,930 --> 01:09:50,180
He's still for the foreign
professional fight.

1188
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:55,370
Insanely impressive what he's done in
his career, man. Shane in his prime. Yes.

1189
01:09:55,371 --> 01:09:57,650
He James in his prime.
He got fucked out.

1190
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:01,760
There's Shane rocked and after Shane had
a shit where they could have stopped it,

1191
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:03,680
let's be easily,
could've stopped it easily.

1192
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:06,440
Good thing they did it because he
came back and one that's came back and

1193
01:10:06,441 --> 01:10:09,450
strangle them. Look, Brock Lesnar,

1194
01:10:09,550 --> 01:10:13,730
I mean he had no business
fighting Allister after he
came back from that surgery.

1195
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:16,940
He had no business fighting Kane.
He just was not on that level.

1196
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:20,030
But if he learned to get on that
level, it's all those guys. He beats,

1197
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:23,860
although he has more talent than all
those guys, all those guys. And, uh,

1198
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:27,500
but he doesn't like to get hit dude ass
pat Barry when he was in his training

1199
01:10:27,501 --> 01:10:30,680
camp and pap it, you know, they brought
Pat Barry and before he fought someone,

1200
01:10:30,681 --> 01:10:31,910
I forget in Pat,

1201
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:35,720
moved out there and was in Minnesota
and he said he'd only train like three,

1202
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:39,920
two or three times a week and they were
sparring and Pat, you know, pat goes hard.

1203
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:44,510
I was a train part of mine for years.
Peck is really hard. He's a beast man.

1204
01:10:44,511 --> 01:10:47,390
He's a beast. Stand up,
terrible ground. Anyways,

1205
01:10:47,450 --> 01:10:52,450
so he fucking hits Brock and I
guess Brock freaks the fuck out.

1206
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:55,820
And his coaches were like, what the
fuck are you doing? And path like,

1207
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:59,390
what do you mean? Like don't fucking
hit Brock in the faith. That was like,

1208
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:02,960
what the fuck am I doing here then?
And they're like, you just Paul Man,

1209
01:11:02,961 --> 01:11:06,380
just feel it out. What? Yeah, I'm
pals. Like this is some bullshit.

1210
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,510
They weren't hitting him,
but that's [inaudible] great
story. Well that's weird.

1211
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,420
Him Training with Brock.
I had heard conflicting stories.

1212
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:17,550
I had heard that that's not true.
Hmm.

1213
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,630
So I'm going to have to do a fight night
without you guys. I'm very sad. No Way.

1214
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:24,900
Next weekend. No Man. Saturday
night fucking bullshit.

1215
01:11:24,901 --> 01:11:27,990
And my boy Leo does fighting to Cindy.
You don't have to be there with him.

1216
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:31,850
You come with me. He does. He needs.
Why? What's it for without me?

1217
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:34,550
He gets lost and I think
he does well with our dog.

1218
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,140
Maybe this bet. No, no, no.
That's not true. Where's
Brian? I'm depressed. His head.

1219
01:11:43,141 --> 01:11:47,430
Hags hello my boy. Leo's fighting. I
was just with him last week. Tiny man.

1220
01:11:47,431 --> 01:11:49,980
He looks great. Does he?
Looks Great. Does he great.

1221
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:53,100
What was going on with him entering into
that Rockhold fight. This is a second.

1222
01:11:53,101 --> 01:11:55,600
Whoa. That's a tight guillotine. He had

1223
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:02,700
the right knee was more important
than even the choke fine. 100%. Yeah.

1224
01:12:02,701 --> 01:12:04,740
Getting that right knee up and over.
It was more important.

1225
01:12:04,741 --> 01:12:08,110
Position over submission. This
are right. That's fucking great.

1226
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:14,040
Kenny. As a position over
submission. First of all, defense.

1227
01:12:14,041 --> 01:12:18,990
I am always safe. Leo said in
that Rockhold fight, he had,

1228
01:12:18,991 --> 01:12:19,824
um,

1229
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,270
in exchange got hit in the back of the
head and he was out of sorts then sort of,

1230
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:26,460
he said it was in illegal shot.
I completely disagree.

1231
01:12:26,461 --> 01:12:29,190
I watched the elbow land
Atlanta to the side of the head.

1232
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,770
It was a ruthless was fucking
elbow that Rockhold hit him with,

1233
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:34,680
but Rockhold had already had his back,
was already beaten them up.

1234
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:38,460
Rockhold had them on the ground and
Machita didn't look good physically.

1235
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,920
He looked different physically.
He looks soft. I agree.

1236
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:43,830
A hundred percent rock called
he's gonna fight widened, right.

1237
01:12:44,370 --> 01:12:47,580
Rockhold is going to fight Weidman and
that's a fucking motherfucker of a file.

1238
01:12:47,970 --> 01:12:52,320
Real quick. Best fight in
middleweight history. Naval
battling could be maybe him,

1239
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,880
uh, Anderson versus Weidman might be
the only other fighter that's old school

1240
01:12:56,881 --> 01:13:00,600
Anderson, but Anderson, the first
by Anderson is prime Anderson.

1241
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:04,050
The first fight versus Weidman. We
didn't know that it was over and I know,

1242
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:07,260
but we found out really quick. Well,
we only found out because he fucked up.

1243
01:13:07,410 --> 01:13:10,890
If Anderson didn't fuck up Anderson
escape from the knee. Need Bar,

1244
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,670
right escape from the leg lock attempt
by Weidmann and was beating Weidman

1245
01:13:14,671 --> 01:13:18,720
standing up before he's clowning around
and trying to goad Weidman into an

1246
01:13:18,721 --> 01:13:20,080
exchange so he could,
you know,

1247
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:24,240
he could counter attacks and I'm standing
up because he's making such a joke of

1248
01:13:24,241 --> 01:13:28,310
kicking the shit. Punched him in the
face. He was not punching in the face. No,

1249
01:13:28,330 --> 01:13:30,840
it was not. Well, he
barely hit him in the face.

1250
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,480
He didn't like kids
through a lot of leg kicks.

1251
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:36,540
And it was the first thing that John
Danaher said to me when I went into the

1252
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:40,300
corner, John Donner, her said, uh, I said,
congratulations after Wyman. Beat him.

1253
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,370
Donna is such a fucking wizard.
The first thing that it was mine,

1254
01:13:43,930 --> 01:13:46,200
I don't like how many times he was
getting hit with those leg kicks.

1255
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:47,520
He was the first thing out of his mouth.

1256
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,910
It's like the guy just won the
middleweight championship of the world.

1257
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:54,740
Knocked out. Anderson Silva
was a great coach. Exactly. Um,

1258
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:59,970
I just think you have two fighters in
there. Very, very prime, right? Like,

1259
01:13:59,971 --> 01:14:03,420
yeah. Rockhold had to slip up where
he got his fucking, I kicked out by,

1260
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:08,160
by Vito juiced up Vitorin Brazil. Right.
Other than that, he's a mother fucker.

1261
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:11,680
You have Weidman is prime.
You have Rockland is prime.
It's rare. We see this man.

1262
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:12,370
Yeah.

1263
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:15,520
To me it's the best vitamin weight history
if not one of the best fights in UFC

1264
01:14:15,521 --> 01:14:18,300
history. I would agree. I would agree
with that. I think, I think Brock,

1265
01:14:18,301 --> 01:14:21,280
Shane's better. I think that's a
bigger fight. But other than that,

1266
01:14:21,310 --> 01:14:25,720
I think what's meager five because it's
the heavyweights settles most important

1267
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:26,800
title Troy,
but,

1268
01:14:26,801 --> 01:14:30,550
and those are also two true heavyweights
who brought some shit to the octagon.

1269
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:35,470
Right? Like canes to a tough sell man
because he doesn't look in posing.

1270
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,530
Right. He doesn't really talk. He just
wants to wrestle and fucking chill. Right?

1271
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,371
I don't think so.

1272
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,540
I think you've Cain was more active and
he hadn't been injured and you just run

1273
01:14:42,541 --> 01:14:45,370
it through the division like he was
when he was in his prime before.

1274
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:46,780
Like this two year layoff.

1275
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:50,740
If you look at the cane that beat up
junior dos Santos and the second and third

1276
01:14:50,741 --> 01:14:51,161
fights,

1277
01:14:51,161 --> 01:14:54,460
if you'll get the cane that stormed
through Ben Rothwell that's old school,

1278
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:58,420
but that cane if he had
was like more active,

1279
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,450
he'd be like Canelo Alvarez.
He be fucking huge.

1280
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,290
It's just tough to sell him when he's
on the shelf for two months or two years

1281
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:05,830
rather than me.

1282
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:10,540
But think about when Brock Brock fucking
Lesnar the WWE crowd and then he had

1283
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:14,160
the UFC crowds sold and he's being
bitches up former champs frank.

1284
01:15:14,161 --> 01:15:16,510
When you heat up in the air and you
could tour, you know what I'm saying?

1285
01:15:16,511 --> 01:15:21,130
It's insane. When he beat up mirror and
stop destroyed, his face smashed his face.

1286
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:24,100
He's the biggest star of the UFC has
ever had. And then you have Shane Carwyn.

1287
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,560
Remember Shane just got
done beating the brakes off.

1288
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:30,760
Mayor knocked out Gonzaga
and all knockouts. Mgm Grand,

1289
01:15:30,790 --> 01:15:34,070
biggest heavyweight, 12 time
in UFC. That's the biggest
fight in UFC history. Yeah,

1290
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:37,770
no, I just think Rockhold and
Weidman is a dope, dope fight man.

1291
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:41,830
What was also the biggest paper view card
ever is also, it was UFC 100 of course.

1292
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:46,060
So it was a big event and you know,
it was a lot of shyness and a UFC 100 oh,

1293
01:15:46,061 --> 01:15:47,740
that's right. I'm
thinking of mirror. Yeah.

1294
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:52,741
You're thinking of Mayor Brock and Shane
was UFC one 16 at Mgm Grand One 16 one

1295
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:58,390
16 because I fought rusher on that.
There's your boy pat. Yeah, there it is.

1296
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:02,260
We've got to have him tell us the story
of training with Brock Lesnar MMA record

1297
01:16:02,261 --> 01:16:06,990
three and two of that stuff.
Um, yeah. Interesting. Yeah.

1298
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:12,340
Brock does crazy stuff in the WWF that
seems in human that other wrestlers have

1299
01:16:12,341 --> 01:16:15,790
never been able to do.
Skylar asked me, sir,

1300
01:16:16,270 --> 01:16:21,000
don't bring in Dodo events. Keep
bringing it up. Is The guy there?

1301
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:25,160
He has 69 he's 70 that's
natural. Totally natural. No one,

1302
01:16:25,190 --> 01:16:29,530
no one has ever looked like that at 69
if you'd quit bullshit and get on TRT,

1303
01:16:29,531 --> 01:16:32,500
that could be you.
That thinks 21 years older than me.

1304
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:36,220
22 years old out of them.
It's insane. Richie Shit,

1305
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,080
which is shit muscular tits.
Great market and love it and crazy.

1306
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,140
Ooh, look at this. Is Dick's
probably hard all day long.

1307
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:48,700
He destroys on Mcgregor.
Conor McGregor.

1308
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:52,450
I comb that.
I come from the show.

1309
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,360
I said on, I spoke, I spoke my
country's name and my native tongue.

1310
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:03,930
I said, ed, I'll tell you what.

1311
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:08,380
That's what I can't wait to hear those
Irish and Brazilian chance going back and

1312
01:17:08,381 --> 01:17:10,100
forth can be outside.
She can't

1313
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:14,790
wait to hear is the sound of head kicks
from the crowd as fucking giant Broccoli.

1314
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:19,250
I wanted to shoot my myself like a
lightning bolt through his chest.

1315
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:24,410
Let's you sounded Scottish while he's
looking back is actually from Scott,

1316
01:17:24,430 --> 01:17:26,840
but you're ruining the new tattoo.

1317
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:31,490
The tiger on his stomach fucked up when
I set of apps like that and you cover it

1318
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:35,030
with that bullshit and it's such good
work. It looks like a three d image.

1319
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:40,030
Look at him. Although Scarface, Scarface,

1320
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:45,770
bad, he's a bad motherfucker. People
got to educate themselves on all though,

1321
01:17:45,771 --> 01:17:49,850
man. I mean he's no joke and
mother Fucker, he's no joke.

1322
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,790
Any, any of motivation. Not
that he doesn't. Anyways,

1323
01:17:55,791 --> 01:17:59,750
but now he's talking all this shit.
Like I said, I'm a Connor fan though.

1324
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:03,980
How can you not be man?
What he's done for the story's crazy.

1325
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:09,460
Did you see how all those brought in the
jungle fight guy? Be a [inaudible] know.

1326
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:14,060
How do you say the Bald Guy Bill? How
would he know? No. Pull up a video.

1327
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:19,090
Josie Aldo brings in Jonah's bill hotard
hene hole does not know how to say

1328
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:21,830
that.
Say the dude's name,

1329
01:18:21,831 --> 01:18:26,831
but the point is the dude who we
brought in can emulate Connor perfectly.

1330
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,440
He's built like Connor and he's a
beat. He does. He move like tunnel.

1331
01:18:30,441 --> 01:18:33,980
That's the different, he's good dude.
He's good. Yeah, you got to see this guy.

1332
01:18:34,250 --> 01:18:39,210
First of all, pull up, pull
up a highlight reel, pull out,

1333
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:43,460
pull up a highlight reel for
Jonah's jungle fight champ. Jonah's,

1334
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,310
B. I. L. H. A. R. I. N. H. O. O.

1335
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,510
I've seen this dude fight before.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1336
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:55,060
He fights one 45 and he fights
the same style that Connor does.

1337
01:18:55,061 --> 01:18:58,250
A fuck isn't any in the UFC. He will
be eventually. He's a beast. I mean,

1338
01:18:58,251 --> 01:19:02,270
he's got a, he's got a contract with
jungle fight. He's was champ. You know,

1339
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,660
it's a big Brazilian organization's
trouble for Connor though.

1340
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:07,370
If he found someone to mimic that style.
Well that's the issue with Connor.

1341
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:11,810
Watch this cat. This cat's good dude. Look
at Bill Marino. This is him because his,

1342
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:14,150
they call them speed,
but watch how this guy moves around.

1343
01:19:14,151 --> 01:19:17,690
He moves around exactly the
Connor and he fights southpaw.

1344
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:22,100
Watch how this mother fucker fights. Look
at this. He looks just like, oh, he's,

1345
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:25,180
she's wicked. He's wicked
dude. He's wicked tail.

1346
01:19:25,940 --> 01:19:27,500
He's got nasty kicks.

1347
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:31,220
He's a real good striker and
he's got a vicious look at that.

1348
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:34,660
Look at that fucking switch. Kick to the
head, Dude. He's built just like Connor.

1349
01:19:34,661 --> 01:19:39,200
You exactly. He moves like Connor
to look at this motherfucker. Ooh,

1350
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:44,630
he's good. His kicks are
better than Connor's. How
about that? He hurts dudes too,

1351
01:19:44,631 --> 01:19:47,840
man. He's good. Damn Bill.
If Reno's no joke man,

1352
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:52,610
strictly please stand up, huh?
No, he's, he's an MMA champ.

1353
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:57,620
He's nasty dude. Look at him. He's no
joke. Okay, so this is the guy moves.

1354
01:19:57,621 --> 01:20:01,640
Exactly. This is the guy that Connor's
bringing it and a lot of local cobra.

1355
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:03,500
Look at the,
I know is better than Connor.

1356
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:06,080
A lot of people think that he
could beat Conor in an MMA fight.

1357
01:20:06,270 --> 01:20:08,130
Fucking looks good,
man.

1358
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:11,460
Man. Look at this fucking movement.
He's no joke. That's straight left.

1359
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:13,640
Does he have any losses?
Ah, I don't know man.

1360
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:16,470
I know what his record is cause I mean
obviously it's a highlight. So yeah,

1361
01:20:16,471 --> 01:20:20,250
he's a bad motherfucker, but well, you
know, look, he's, he moves just like him.

1362
01:20:20,251 --> 01:20:23,160
He looks exactly like him. There couldn't
be a better trainer, but he's nasty.

1363
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:24,220
I wonder how he's lost.

1364
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:27,540
He's even wearing his hair like
Connor and preparation for this fight.

1365
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:30,030
Damn all in. Yeah. Watch this. Okay,

1366
01:20:30,031 --> 01:20:34,020
now pull up a video of a Aldo training
with them. Watch this. He also,

1367
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:36,390
he painted his face all the way.
Look how he's doing his hair.

1368
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:40,680
He's got his fucking hair up like Connor
lowly shit son. And he's just like,

1369
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:43,390
exactly. He's doing all the shit
that Connor does. He brought,

1370
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:46,830
he brought him in to mimic Connor.
Dude on put my entire life savings.

1371
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:51,270
See how he's doing now.
Yes, this is a game changer.

1372
01:20:51,330 --> 01:20:55,590
It's kid fish die. Fuck man.
He's just like, exactly.

1373
01:20:55,750 --> 01:21:00,270
And he's, you know, he's got that
style of movement in the first place.

1374
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,050
All the three 60 wheel kicks and
roundhouse kicks and all that shit too.

1375
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:08,700
That's trouble. It's interesting. It's
very interesting. Very interesting.

1376
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:12,770
What is that guy's name again? Bill
[inaudible]. Bill arena. I'll see promise.

1377
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:13,613
He's from Brazil.

1378
01:21:14,530 --> 01:21:19,330
Sage A. I. N. H. O. M.

1379
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:23,580
Have a new boyfriend. Guys Know Joe.
He's no joke. I like [inaudible].

1380
01:21:24,090 --> 01:21:27,390
He said better kicker than Conor.
Better than he must like it. See,

1381
01:21:27,391 --> 01:21:29,400
Connor's kicks her almost disdainful.

1382
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,080
If you watch the way
Conor throws his kicks,

1383
01:21:31,081 --> 01:21:34,890
he throws his kicks a lot the
way like exactly like bitch,

1384
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,890
I'll just throw these kicks out there.
So He's six and no,

1385
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:40,650
he hasn't lost every wind's been by Tko.

1386
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,700
He's got one decision. Dan, once
a mission, we're in naked choke.

1387
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:49,320
He's a bad motherfucker. Holy Fuck Man.
Where does he fight? What fights you?

1388
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:52,700
The junk of five champion.
He's No,

1389
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:58,310
25 five 11 five 11 one 45 and Connor
Connor's not five 11 five not five 11 see

1390
01:22:02,630 --> 01:22:06,570
is I'm five 11 Connor's not close
to five 11 you. Dot. You're known.

1391
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:09,190
When we find out that you're wrong,
it's going to be ugly.

1392
01:22:09,210 --> 01:22:12,400
Take a look at the Instagram picture with
us. How much time you, you go Instagram.

1393
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:17,610
He's slouching. I stood next to him
and I know, you know I look at body.

1394
01:22:17,611 --> 01:22:21,600
You have boots on. I'm obsessed with it,
right? You're right. Thank you. He's five.

1395
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:25,500
Nine. Everybody be quiet. Is He? Yes. Yes.
Everybody. Give it up. Give it up. Kevin.

1396
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:30,960
Come on, man. I'm trying to be death.
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Jesus man. Connors.

1397
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:33,480
Five eight says it says
they're five eight. Well,

1398
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:36,120
I'm five eight and honestly I
think he's an inch taller than me.

1399
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:40,490
I think that's not correct.
It's tough. It's tough, man.

1400
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,600
That's insane.
I don't know.

1401
01:22:42,601 --> 01:22:45,050
I'm more surprised that he
brought in that guy or calendar.

1402
01:22:45,051 --> 01:22:50,051
I feel of Reno Bill of Reno is
a fucking real game changer.

1403
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:51,900
That's a game changer.
Yeah.

1404
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:54,990
Big Game Changer because he's going
to learn how to deal with that style.

1405
01:22:54,991 --> 01:22:57,990
And Bill arena was explaining to him
all the different setups that he does.

1406
01:22:57,991 --> 01:23:00,810
Because bill,
you fights exactly like Connor fights.

1407
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:05,150
He sets up kicks and punches in a very,
very similar way. And that's huge man.

1408
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:06,130
Because when you fight someone

1409
01:23:06,130 --> 01:23:10,090
like Connor there, there's very few
fighters, there's Connor, Leo Machida,

1410
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:14,170
Ronda Rousey, Stephan struve.
Cause he's fucking nine foot tall.

1411
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:17,930
There's certain guys we get one shot at.
You can't duplicate it. Right, right.

1412
01:23:17,970 --> 01:23:22,480
So now you find a guide just like Connor
or maybe you're going to see that dude,

1413
01:23:22,481 --> 01:23:25,930
that's a fucking game change.
Exactly. Exactly. Damn.

1414
01:23:25,931 --> 01:23:28,720
And I'm putting a lot of money on Giardia.
I'm rooting for Connor though.

1415
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,490
My heart wants Connor, but my brains, I
don't be, I love Josie. I love Connor too.

1416
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,380
I have no,
I have no dog in this fight.

1417
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:38,050
I really do mean I just want a great
fight. I went to live up to the height,

1418
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:41,080
Dana said he thinks would be the
biggest paper view ever. It could be.

1419
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:43,450
It's not going to be bearing
UFC 100 so let's get real.

1420
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:46,870
It could be either one of these days
are bigger stars than Brock. Oh.

1421
01:23:46,871 --> 01:23:48,280
But internationally,
they certainly are.

1422
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:52,300
Conor McGregor is the biggest star in
combat sports history to come out of

1423
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:53,490
Ireland. Wow. Well, really?

1424
01:23:54,110 --> 01:23:58,720
There's a lot man co Madeline
traditional bra on boxer edition.

1425
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:00,880
Yeah, but they've Wayne
McCullough, your boy.

1426
01:24:00,881 --> 01:24:02,620
Wayne McCullough comes
from Wayne McCullough.

1427
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:05,290
There's Dev a lot of great boxes
that have come from Ireland.

1428
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,560
Look at this daily superstars back
for over 1 million paperclips,

1429
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:12,050
so not the biggest average says on track
for 1 million. I misquoted Dana. Oh,

1430
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:15,250
fucking rip. My Connor thinks it's going
to be the biggest ever, not Dana. Okay.

1431
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:18,310
My bad. Connor or Dana, this takes
over a million. Look at that site.

1432
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:23,170
It does over a million, so sure
it does over a million. 100% yeah,

1433
01:24:23,171 --> 01:24:26,890
I think it does a million watch. I think
internationally in Europe especially,

1434
01:24:26,891 --> 01:24:31,450
I think we really have no idea how big he
is. What is the date? It said July 11th

1435
01:24:33,310 --> 01:24:36,580
find the kid won't be at the UFC expo.
It's all the shit going on.

1436
01:24:36,581 --> 01:24:38,740
What is that about?
How come you guys won't be in the UFC?

1437
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:41,010
Actually we can't talk shit about
Reebok and show up at the X.

1438
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,110
Is that what's going on?
I'm just saying I'm,

1439
01:24:43,111 --> 01:24:44,710
I'm assuming that it has
a little bit to go on it,

1440
01:24:44,711 --> 01:24:49,270
but do they see the shit going
on? Shit going on. Listen,
if we ever want to do it,

1441
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:53,650
well we could do is next time there's a
UFC where you guys want to do something.

1442
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,590
We could just get a studio
somewhere like it, uh,

1443
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:01,360
at a casino and do a live event and
have a podcast with a three of us.

1444
01:25:01,361 --> 01:25:05,980
We just go onstage live. So we'll do
the way in and then after the way,

1445
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:09,140
and we'll do like a 6:00 PM
podcast somewhere and the only few,

1446
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:13,150
and I do an 8:00 PM show
somewhere at 9:00 PM show. Dude,

1447
01:25:14,380 --> 01:25:15,440
really?
And Tony Hinchcliffe,

1448
01:25:15,441 --> 01:25:20,050
Tom [inaudible] and I will be at the car
theater at MGM where they do Cirque de

1449
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:24,640
Solei. That's a great show laying
in the show. I just remembered.

1450
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:27,610
You're reminding me I have to act
to figure out, maybe I should email.

1451
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:30,790
It's someone who like knows more,

1452
01:25:30,791 --> 01:25:34,360
but they told us last time at that car
theater cause it's a Cirque de Solei

1453
01:25:34,361 --> 01:25:36,250
theater that we can do like crazy stuff.

1454
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:39,230
What do you mean come in like on a
zip line or they're not coming in.

1455
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:44,050
I was too much to your fucking
trying to be a tour for comedy now.

1456
01:25:44,060 --> 01:25:48,490
It's like, no, you can't do that.

1457
01:25:48,491 --> 01:25:50,880
You can just go out there and
you do get sick. A zip line.

1458
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:53,820
But it has a nice suit on like
the Golden Pony and saying,

1459
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:57,880
do I get to do something like
that instead of your own show?

1460
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,390
Show some sensor and you don't.

1461
01:26:01,391 --> 01:26:04,100
You want to come in from
the bottom like brides a hi

1462
01:26:04,770 --> 01:26:08,220
Todd. Cigarette guy died at that
Cirque de Solei theater. Dying. Dying.

1463
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:09,950
Dying is a combination.
Wrestling.

1464
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:15,190
Think about who's the guy who fell
fucking Brett. The hitman Hart's brother.

1465
01:26:15,330 --> 01:26:18,020
Do you want to be Brett? The hitman
Hart's brother? Here's girl Jessica Benet.

1466
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:22,670
I gotta take a leak before this gets
going. She looks calm, man. For sure.

1467
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:26,450
Don't duck lip it though to lock the gun.
She's sexy, Bro. Yeah. Don't hate on sexy.

1468
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,220
I'm not hating on see yourself.
Don't hate it.

1469
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:33,140
I just said the winner of this gets a
nose job. Frenos job. Dammit. Brendan,

1470
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:36,160
what's wrong with that? But let me
tell you something about Yohanna.

1471
01:26:36,190 --> 01:26:38,570
Me and Tony got a couple beaks ourselves.
Yeah.

1472
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,000
Wait a Salem throw me under the bus.

1473
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:48,050
This big bomb, Bro.
We're part of the beat.

1474
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:51,950
Clam guys might know this is
probably smaller than well,

1475
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:53,280
my nose is right there with you guys.
Huh?

1476
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:56,710
Johann has a is the only one that
doesn't have the weird knows.

1477
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:59,360
[inaudible] knows I'm waiting
for it to get messed up.

1478
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:04,280
[inaudible] no, right. I'm with
you on Johana and on. I like,

1479
01:27:04,281 --> 01:27:06,230
I like these.
Both these girls are attractive to me.

1480
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:09,100
I don't care what anybody says.
You're such a pussy. Yeah.

1481
01:27:09,140 --> 01:27:11,480
You still worried about people
lashing out on dude, we,

1482
01:27:12,290 --> 01:27:16,430
my air BNB did said they're unable
to accommodate my request. Hey,

1483
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:20,120
let's do this offline. Kellan sorry,
but for 100% don't text her in the shot.

1484
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:20,983
Hurts me.

1485
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:25,420
I mean, she's got a wrestler.
That's her only chance.

1486
01:27:25,421 --> 01:27:29,320
Did you see it just jumped to the yard?
Do you follow you on, on Instagram? Oh,

1487
01:27:29,321 --> 01:27:30,910
I don't.
Oh my God.

1488
01:27:30,911 --> 01:27:34,510
You should look up this thing of her
striking the other day we watched it.

1489
01:27:34,570 --> 01:27:38,590
Oh my God. Fucking animal. An animal.

1490
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:40,500
The one where she's hitting
the Mitts and then sprawl.

1491
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:44,930
What up? What up? Pop Up. Pop Up.
[inaudible] she's a fucking monster.

1492
01:27:45,140 --> 01:27:47,680
She's the best women's
striker to ever grace the UFC.

1493
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:50,300
Is She gonna win this fight
then in your mind? Oh,

1494
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:53,510
you're talking about the the fucking
minus 700 favorite? Yes, Brian.

1495
01:27:54,770 --> 01:27:57,260
I'd think so. Well just
get a penny. I mean,

1496
01:27:57,290 --> 01:28:01,610
it's gonna be a tough go for her
because she fucked a Carlos Esparza.

1497
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:04,820
Fucking Joanna did and
just dismantled Esparza.

1498
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:07,970
So Penn eight her only chit chance,
not striking.

1499
01:28:07,971 --> 01:28:09,530
She's going to have to get
him to the ground. Yeah.

1500
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:11,330
It's not wrestlings Jujitsu and

1501
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:14,690
all of you on his fights ago,
because I've been to quite a few of them.

1502
01:28:14,691 --> 01:28:18,020
Just luckily, you know, matched up
with the gigs that I do with Joe.

1503
01:28:18,021 --> 01:28:21,580
And she just happens to be on
the card and two fights ago, uh,

1504
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:26,740
she went all Jujitsu against the Jujitsu
girl and rolled with our man and her

1505
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:30,700
specialty is striking and
sh she just g out Jujitsu,

1506
01:28:30,701 --> 01:28:32,740
the Jujitsu Carlos Spo Spars,

1507
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:35,860
Esparza tried taking her announce
something like 16 times as successful like

1508
01:28:35,861 --> 01:28:37,450
once or twice.
If that,

1509
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:41,260
and a spark I would assume is a better
wrestler in Penn a so she has her hands

1510
01:28:41,261 --> 01:28:43,420
full. I, if I'm predicting this,

1511
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:48,410
I think Jay Jay knocks her out
in the third round. All right,

1512
01:28:48,411 --> 01:28:50,830
take [inaudible] not knockout.
Tko is in third.

1513
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:53,450
I don't like seeing a girl
who's this good at striking.

1514
01:28:53,451 --> 01:28:56,990
Just beat up some other girl on
the fake Cyborg. Gina Carano.

1515
01:28:57,120 --> 01:29:00,560
You ever seen it looked like bully
beat down. I was like, oh my God.

1516
01:29:00,740 --> 01:29:02,670
And Carano was a sexy

1517
01:29:02,670 --> 01:29:07,350
beast. Beautiful. Oof, oof. Sign me
the fuck up. She's in the audience.

1518
01:29:07,460 --> 01:29:09,750
I'm too loud asked for it,
but I'll make a go at it your way.

1519
01:29:09,790 --> 01:29:12,780
You're just not her style. Doesn't
matter bro. She was dating superman.

1520
01:29:13,230 --> 01:29:17,640
Who's superman? Oh, that guy.
Can Superman fight though? No,

1521
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:20,850
it's just a sexy bitch, you know?
That was not good enough. You can't.

1522
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:25,790
If you can't fight, you can't fuck
that girl the term maybe, but I don't.

1523
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:27,470
I just don't see anything
she needs to fight around.

1524
01:29:27,490 --> 01:29:30,450
She's a Weidman or some
fucking Luke Rockhold,

1525
01:29:30,451 --> 01:29:34,530
Brendan Schaub type character
side it. That was a pro
football player, right? Yeah.

1526
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:38,220
Calculus quarter.
She's too hot and she's a Badass fighter.

1527
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:41,040
Like she's not going to be able to deal
with some guy who can't fight and just

1528
01:29:41,110 --> 01:29:43,230
look squishy. Walk around. I would
have. How much do you worry about?

1529
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:48,300
She's not a little girl. I say.
Well, when I saw her, she was she.

1530
01:29:48,301 --> 01:29:51,360
Yes. She's easily bought
at one 45 yeah, she's,

1531
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:54,750
she's won 60 when I saw
that she's hot. No, guys,

1532
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:58,710
you think the girls need to be skinny?
You're crazy. I don't lose my band.

1533
01:29:58,711 --> 01:30:02,160
And number nine I agree guys. Dude,

1534
01:30:02,161 --> 01:30:07,161
she's just all woman's Janet chronic to
me is the sexiest female fighter ever.

1535
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:11,100
You want to make some gladiator babies?
That's your fucking girl.

1536
01:30:11,290 --> 01:30:14,880
100% no doubt. I mean for
real man. When she fought,

1537
01:30:14,881 --> 01:30:18,780
Cyborg Cyborg was at her juicy juice.
That hurt my feelings.

1538
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:21,690
That was a hurt feelings. I feel like
guys should have jumped in there,

1539
01:30:21,691 --> 01:30:25,540
defended her well. It would be a guy
fighting. I feel like Roger worked does,

1540
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:28,980
should have jumped in then and
defended a girl. That's fucked up, man.

1541
01:30:28,981 --> 01:30:31,950
That was fucked.
Such a fucking beat down Dave.

1542
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:36,060
They almost are responsible for the
lack of drug testing they did for her.

1543
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,880
They just didn't give a fuck.
What was that like, man?

1544
01:30:38,881 --> 01:30:42,810
I think Cyborg might be choosing a
nice house and her eyes are intense.

1545
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:47,830
Look in her eyes, look at
her, say turning. I think I
agree. She take that back.

1546
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:50,850
Only her and Rhonda are the
only two that I've been in.

1547
01:30:50,851 --> 01:30:52,440
Atlanta has a good nose flattened.

1548
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:56,190
You know what JJ though
looks better without makeup.

1549
01:30:56,191 --> 01:30:58,320
I think it's when she puts makeup on.
Where's that?

1550
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:01,110
God Damn Polo top is
where it gets trouble.

1551
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:06,120
She's such a, in her country, in
Poland, Polo tops, herb that's hot.

1552
01:31:06,121 --> 01:31:10,700
It's like bold knapsack people and the
renaissance days and were like back then,

1553
01:31:10,780 --> 01:31:13,820
that was good to be Rubin. Ask.
It was sexy. Catch you who pray,

1554
01:31:13,821 --> 01:31:18,510
protect it from disease. Nobody had
any food trailer like yoga pants in La.

1555
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:22,950
That's right. First Polish UFC champion,
first female European UFC champion.

1556
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:26,790
She is, this is what it should say
under her title. Bad ass bitch.

1557
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:30,330
Six time world Moitai
champion it 100% legit.

1558
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,910
You watch her Moitai it's so crisp.
First of all,

1559
01:31:32,911 --> 01:31:37,911
her fucking jab is a laser beam and it's
so fast and so technical and she has

1560
01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:42,810
confidence. She's cool. She's so
gangster. What's she doing here?

1561
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:47,280
That video of her lighting up the
pads. Jesus Christ. That's impressive.

1562
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,580
I haven't seen it. You haven't
seen it. Jamie, pull that video up.

1563
01:31:50,581 --> 01:31:54,900
The video of her from the UFC Instagram
page just to get a feel for the fucking

1564
01:31:54,901 --> 01:31:57,570
hand speed.
This chick possess for the UFC.

1565
01:31:57,630 --> 01:31:59,980
They need her to be a
dominant to make this

1566
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:00,780
uh,

1567
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:05,260
was it strawweight to make the strawweight
division [inaudible] siding and heard

1568
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,030
it just dominate bitches like Rhonda is.

1569
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:08,950
Cause if you have the
belt constantly switching,

1570
01:32:09,370 --> 01:32:12,820
it's hard for people to jump on board. You
know what I'm saying? I agree. I agree.

1571
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:15,060
I think people will
catch on like her fists.

1572
01:32:15,061 --> 01:32:19,990
I like Ron does armbar you know like
she sort of has this fun thing to watch.

1573
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,520
It's all of our striking.
It's not just our Fiserv elbows are nasty.

1574
01:32:24,521 --> 01:32:28,540
Boils up bitches and clinch. No,
look at that. Look up at that screen.

1575
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:33,460
Watch this calendar is your worst
nightmares. Damn fucking dude.

1576
01:32:33,610 --> 01:32:37,890
And I'd watch your spa. Light it up. Light
it up. Light it up. Sprite. Light it up.

1577
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:42,970
Light it up. Light it up.
Light it up. Light it up. Let
it up. Sprawl. Come on Tony.

1578
01:32:42,971 --> 01:32:44,800
It might be too much my man.
It's too much.

1579
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:49,820
Rather look at the confidence she is
Jesus' right hand speed is the same world.

1580
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:51,880
I need a girl like that to defend me.

1581
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:54,850
If I ever make fun of somebody too bad
and they get in my face, it was like,

1582
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:59,230
it's speed. Camera, speed it or no it
isn't. Look at the guy was totally normal.

1583
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:02,050
Sick. Look at the guy's movement.
That doesn't like speed it up at all.

1584
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:06,970
We know that's not speeding. She's 115
pounds of fury boxing tonight too, man.

1585
01:33:06,990 --> 01:33:07,740
Watch.
Watch me.

1586
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,660
Watch me hit mets to know you're
going to throw your hands in the air.

1587
01:33:10,661 --> 01:33:12,340
They don't think you're going
to hit things with your hands.

1588
01:33:12,341 --> 01:33:16,480
You don't find that box. I am way
McCulloch makes me wear headgear, right?

1589
01:33:16,540 --> 01:33:21,490
God dammit. He hates when I
do. He hates it. He hates it.

1590
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:25,670
No, I hate that. You think
you're fighting? Hey Bro.
That's what he hates. You don't.

1591
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,710
You guys have video on me. Nice. He
knew and Wayne, where do they get,

1592
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:31,930
I've seen you sit down during the
middle of the round from exhaustion.

1593
01:33:32,110 --> 01:33:36,250
That's true.
I am 48 I just don't care enough.

1594
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:41,350
Last time I hit and while I do my job,
shut up. Last time I hit myths, I puked.

1595
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:45,580
Did you? It's so hard. It's, it's
exhausting. Two or three times a week.

1596
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:47,890
You know what a year.
You know what it is.

1597
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:51,550
I'll help both you out get in shape and
brought what's wrong with you. February,

1598
01:33:51,551 --> 01:33:54,220
I'm in shape.
How dare you got to sit between rounds.

1599
01:33:54,250 --> 01:33:56,950
I don't have to sit anymore between Raz
now I know that's not what I energy.

1600
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:59,420
You know every time you sit I
get a text from someone's a gin.

1601
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:04,300
Brian's the only guy I got.
Tony hasn't seen me in a long time.

1602
01:34:04,301 --> 01:34:06,580
You got multiple eyes on you.
Brian's the only guy who,

1603
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:10,990
you've got people watching me. I texted
him once. They let me know how he does.

1604
01:34:12,640 --> 01:34:12,971
Brian,

1605
01:34:12,971 --> 01:34:16,060
is it true that in between rounds when
you sit down and a guy comes and fixes

1606
01:34:16,061 --> 01:34:20,760
your hair down with a, with a
towel and has a Bentley belt,

1607
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:22,590
is it true that when you're sparring a,

1608
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,510
you get afraid that you're sweating
too much? He comes over and good.

1609
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,170
There's motivational things with my hair.

1610
01:34:28,810 --> 01:34:31,420
Does it upset you that your wetter
in round two then in round one?

1611
01:34:31,810 --> 01:34:36,160
Sometimes I look good when I'm wet.
She's confident.

1612
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:39,740
She's so cool.
She's a bad ass.

1613
01:34:40,390 --> 01:34:43,930
I would eat her ass.
Whoa. You get nose deep.

1614
01:34:44,290 --> 01:34:48,900
Probably have to just,
she's going to make my son elbows to save.

1615
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:52,210
She's nervous. You can eat that ass or
you're not eating dinner that night.

1616
01:34:52,211 --> 01:34:53,930
It's got to be nerve wracking.
Ooh.

1617
01:34:54,310 --> 01:34:56,150
Oh.

1618
01:34:56,340 --> 01:34:58,890
Kiss, kiss, lick. Yes. Nose to nose.

1619
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:03,410
Noser nose beak to be big.
To be beat to beat dog.

1620
01:35:03,850 --> 01:35:06,110
I'm explain something to you.
All you fucking guys right now.

1621
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:10,380
You've got to get your jab in her face
and you've got to just follow up with a

1622
01:35:10,381 --> 01:35:13,520
fucking serious kick.
Okay.

1623
01:35:13,521 --> 01:35:16,880
Predictions that third
round Tko by upper cut.

1624
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:21,830
Yolana round to Roger Worth of jumps in.
There we go.

1625
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:25,050
This is the fight we're watching.
This is the first of all these phones.

1626
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:28,850
Does anybody know who won the couch area?
Joe Idea.

1627
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:32,810
Jerry won by decision changed your
bring those shorts up. We'll pinay.

1628
01:35:32,811 --> 01:35:34,970
I liked the way she's
moving to light on the feet.

1629
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:37,500
Throwing up a Nice Crisp Jab to

1630
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:44,240
Tko round one. No, come on. I would
jump to guard. Look at that. Jab,

1631
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:49,070
Jab. Ooh fucker. Don't kid yourself guys.

1632
01:35:49,071 --> 01:35:51,830
Penn has been training hard to
that jab that you want to has.

1633
01:35:51,831 --> 01:35:55,190
It's like one of my favorite
jab in all of MMA. I agree.

1634
01:35:55,191 --> 01:35:57,680
She mixes it up to the body to look at.
Oh,

1635
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:00,320
she goes below scan in the pocket though.

1636
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:03,550
Left took is standing
right there and yeah,

1637
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:07,370
but do you understand what's standing
in the pocket means you have to exchange

1638
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:11,610
like these aren't exchanges. She's
getting tickling. [inaudible]

1639
01:36:14,930 --> 01:36:17,300
guys, can I tell you something?
Penn is the real deal. Well,

1640
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:19,400
penny has very good
takedowns I'll tell you that.

1641
01:36:19,430 --> 01:36:22,220
You saw that on the ultimate fighter.
She's really good at hip tosses.

1642
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:26,000
Good luck taking fucking JJ does. She's
going to take your mom's taking her back.

1643
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:30,990
Nah, Brian, you realize
this isn't a takedown. Well,
he's, she's got a headlock,

1644
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:36,010
a headlock. Rhonda loves his
fucking position. Big, juicy,

1645
01:36:36,020 --> 01:36:40,640
huge. Fucking 10. Look at this. She
escapes. Ron has a judoka. Ne Is fucking,

1646
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:44,450
she's taken some shots, man. Coming
up and keeping her eyes open.

1647
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:49,670
I'll tell you what, I don't like Jay
Jay's long board shorts. I mean, either

1648
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:54,080
your shoulders was around her shoulders,

1649
01:36:54,620 --> 01:36:59,270
keeping her protecting
her chin up. Ooh, comes,

1650
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:02,840
she's throwing chocolate Liddell
style. She went down, right?

1651
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:07,930
Don't let that fucking Roy Nelson right
hand hit exactly on a oh great timing by

1652
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:13,100
penny. Oh at this take down
right back up. Right back up.

1653
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:16,730
I'm not gonna line up. I'm not gonna lie
to you guys. I come for penny. Really?

1654
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:21,710
How come? I don't know man, because she's
such an underdog. I agree. Wow. Brendon,

1655
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:24,170
I'm with you.
I am really liking you.

1656
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:26,720
Want us to take down
these UFC needs JJ to win,

1657
01:37:26,721 --> 01:37:30,350
but it's fitting that her name's penny
cause Yolanda is going to beat her like a

1658
01:37:30,351 --> 01:37:34,630
wet noodle soup that did that by
the way. That's good. Sit down.

1659
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:39,080
Look at this balance. Look at
this. Take down the fat. Hates it.

1660
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:42,190
When I do jokes,
discipline is displayed.

1661
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,700
When I see them come and mill
it down the fucking train track,

1662
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:49,220
but not everybody sees him. I didn't
see him. The fucking flashing lights.

1663
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:53,420
Meaning it's a macaroni
joke coming your way.

1664
01:37:58,740 --> 01:38:02,650
Oh my God. Don't let him. Don't let him
suppress you. You keep with the jokes.

1665
01:38:03,150 --> 01:38:05,760
Need is a body sweat pants to do.

1666
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:10,260
He's going to tire her out.
You guys, I told you this.

1667
01:38:10,380 --> 01:38:13,260
Oh nasty elbow in the clinch.

1668
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:17,640
Nasty old going to hold on
for like leg taken a saver.

1669
01:38:18,730 --> 01:38:23,460
I see a fucking foot going or if it's
a five round fight. Kids. Yes sir.

1670
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:29,190
Oh ooh. Don't do it. Left
Hook. [inaudible] can take
it. I'll tell you that man.

1671
01:38:29,191 --> 01:38:31,020
She can.
She's taken some good shots.

1672
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:34,510
I mean there are 115 post
Jessica training with Penn h.

1673
01:38:34,511 --> 01:38:38,590
She trained under the
timing. She trains. Uh,

1674
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:41,820
she changed that Bouchez Jim Fujitsu.
I know she goes there all the time.

1675
01:38:41,821 --> 01:38:46,821
She was at rain for a long time and
then she also trains at a Ruca Bisbing

1676
01:38:47,821 --> 01:38:49,680
spots.
I'm excited about.

1677
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:56,790
Here's your champ. Stand up. Come on.

1678
01:39:01,890 --> 01:39:05,550
Yeah, she's going to catch
her any second. Do you hope

1679
01:39:07,230 --> 01:39:10,500
I know how to Saturday you can
be if she gets submitted. Tony.

1680
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:15,570
It's an it's impossible. She
doesn't get her up. Jessica hurt.

1681
01:39:15,571 --> 01:39:19,560
She got hurt. She got hurt.
Yeah, she's her dad. Oh elbow.

1682
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,250
She's talking her head in goods.
Look how,

1683
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:27,120
how those hit good fucking hips by you.
Ana. Can't operate right back on the head.

1684
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:31,290
Yeah, no, right. That was a
little slightly illegal minute
to go. You get a warning,

1685
01:39:31,291 --> 01:39:35,660
but pinay she's got to go to your button.
Recovered. There you go. Just sit there.

1686
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:38,670
Chill. Fuck. You're like, let her take
the lights. Cool. Chill and recover.

1687
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:43,290
If she needs those legs. Well,
she needs her fucking cobwebs,

1688
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:48,220
but those are world legs. Grow legs
are all soft. They can't take not Jay.

1689
01:39:48,221 --> 01:39:53,070
Jay's, hers. A schmuck in bats will
sinewy look at this little snaps

1690
01:39:54,990 --> 01:39:59,640
that it's so weird. Snaps. See
she's recovering. This is smart man.

1691
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,480
It is smart. Super Smart. Yeah.

1692
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:05,910
She's definitely not to the
body's exact same thing you do.

1693
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:10,140
Letting her cobwebs clear up a little
bit here and she's looking at is bots

1694
01:40:10,141 --> 01:40:13,500
guten standing him up. All right. That's
a good way to get back up to your feet.

1695
01:40:13,501 --> 01:40:16,620
Clean to hell. Yeah, that's
good. They back up. They
didn't want to but school. Yup.

1696
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:23,100
Hit Jessica. Pinay man. She's
game as fuck. Don't kid yourself.

1697
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,220
Come on Jessica.
And you know what all this

1698
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:33,960
was that dance. It was. It was a hundred
percent legit. You still lost the rich,

1699
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,620
but she's showing that she's game is fuck,
but she's still in there.

1700
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,520
Come on Jessica, don't worry.
And by the way, you know,

1701
01:40:40,530 --> 01:40:44,910
you got to think that this is fucking
wearing on. We've making her fight.

1702
01:40:45,090 --> 01:40:49,620
That kind of grueling grappling, extreme
exchanges is going to wear on you ana.

1703
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:53,660
Yup. And she's going
to slow down. Yup. Mm.

1704
01:40:54,940 --> 01:40:58,780
Oh Jessica would have right
hand look at us. Very nice.

1705
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:04,090
Look at that. Great timing. Great timing
on that shot. She's the real deal man,

1706
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:08,510
which she's forcing her to wrestle and
once she forces at a wrestle it you want

1707
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:12,640
Ooh, nice nasty elbow on the claim. That's
the one that popped in as she is right.

1708
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:17,170
Get inside man. That was a nice writing
on the outside. She has Minjan it man.

1709
01:41:17,171 --> 01:41:21,850
She's mean. Well you know how hard life
is in Poland. The field look like that.

1710
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:26,820
Yup. And if you're a fighter and
skinny little winery chick, oh,

1711
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:28,510
hard life man. Hard. Right?

1712
01:41:28,540 --> 01:41:31,810
The boys or the boys aren't knocking
at the door to take you on dates and

1713
01:41:32,130 --> 01:41:35,980
[inaudible] is when they got one of the
funniest guys on the planet after when

1714
01:41:35,981 --> 01:41:39,140
they stick it in there. Not Nice. She's
funny too. She's got a good sense of you.

1715
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:43,930
She always makes cracks, jokes and a show
and she'll fall in love. That's right.

1716
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:47,020
Well Tony, should we set this up
the way open for you in Poland?

1717
01:41:48,980 --> 01:41:53,630
Tanya, let's see if Jessica
[inaudible] does anyone different?

1718
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:55,300
Damn judging is sitting on a shelf.

1719
01:41:55,770 --> 01:42:00,160
She's strong like these one punches one
and one two and you just can't do that.

1720
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:02,530
What y'all want.
She's just so ready to be there.

1721
01:42:02,531 --> 01:42:04,600
Right when that second
punch gets pulled back.

1722
01:42:04,630 --> 01:42:06,240
Well especially if you're
looking for a take down,

1723
01:42:06,241 --> 01:42:07,930
you've got to throw them all in one shot.
Then you shoot.

1724
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:11,380
Especially if she doesn't anticipate
a third or fourth punch comment,

1725
01:42:11,410 --> 01:42:15,460
like no change of angles. No opera
cuts. Yup. So she's looking for the one.

1726
01:42:15,461 --> 01:42:16,450
If she throws the one,

1727
01:42:16,451 --> 01:42:19,450
the two's coming behind it and that's
about it and she knows she's going to be

1728
01:42:19,451 --> 01:42:24,190
right there pulling back and then
countering instantly when that punch pulls

1729
01:42:24,191 --> 01:42:27,160
back, Jj is too high level to
get caught with that bullshit.

1730
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:29,770
He'll look at this and that
riding desktop on. There you go.

1731
01:42:29,771 --> 01:42:33,340
Just hold the gap though. This
with the clench here, man.

1732
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:37,690
Yo want to gets pinay but she's got
to be careful of that head the way she

1733
01:42:37,691 --> 01:42:40,390
leaves at head dead.
Pinay when you watch the ultimate fighter,

1734
01:42:40,391 --> 01:42:45,040
she took a lot of girls down from that
headlock position and look at this.

1735
01:42:45,041 --> 01:42:49,340
This g the judo toss. Oh,
acquisition hide kicks out of Jj.

1736
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:51,550
Yannis fucking let's go girl.

1737
01:42:51,940 --> 01:42:54,250
Well she doesn't do it because she
worries about people taking her down,

1738
01:42:54,270 --> 01:42:59,020
but standing right there man.
Fuck yeah. Is She's tough dude.

1739
01:42:59,350 --> 01:43:01,900
Honor Toes. Good. Really Good Tom.

1740
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:03,780
Oh

1741
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:09,320
Hey my feet straight. Laugh. Oh,
check. Jab to the body's now too.

1742
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:14,520
Oh look at this combination is reaching.
The exact combination is nasty.

1743
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:17,340
This fights close to being over
gentlemen. Yeah, it's getting rough.

1744
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:21,420
It's getting rough. Penny's. She's
taken a beating cancer. Come on penny.

1745
01:43:21,421 --> 01:43:24,820
Last or third round. Yeah. I
love the movement of your honor.

1746
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:28,350
The way she slides away from things and
then comes right back in and attacks.

1747
01:43:28,380 --> 01:43:32,140
There's those head kicks.
She's loosen it up now. Yeah.

1748
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:36,200
Why can't mount like got down?

1749
01:43:38,860 --> 01:43:42,150
Oh Nice.
Oh she damn

1750
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:46,180
her nose.
Your nose is wide open.

1751
01:43:48,190 --> 01:43:52,130
It's like of this common
nation. Goddamn. That hand

1752
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:56,600
speed is ridiculous. Holy
Shit. Oh, look at that.

1753
01:43:56,690 --> 01:44:00,200
In the clinch, she lands in elbow
right to that same spot on the nose.

1754
01:44:00,201 --> 01:44:02,150
The smarter penny.
Fuck yeah.

1755
01:44:05,210 --> 01:44:06,860
She needs to bleed inside.

1756
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:12,040
If you want his ear just getting those
inner ear and she can take serious

1757
01:44:12,561 --> 01:44:15,810
punishment, man. She, that's too without
the fuck else are going to be broken.

1758
01:44:16,470 --> 01:44:19,120
Elbow and noses splatter.

1759
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:24,140
Oh ooh. Jj is comfortable. Hands down.

1760
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:29,000
Is this just a low,
that nose. Look at this.

1761
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:33,950
Look at her face. Pennock jumped
head kicked. Just barely missed.

1762
01:44:33,951 --> 01:44:35,420
Henoch get under hooked up to half guard.

1763
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:40,250
You want to set it up the left high kick.
Just when? When she goes south. Paul,

1764
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,930
look, it's coming covered combo. Mi, Mi,

1765
01:44:44,931 --> 01:44:49,160
Mi three. No nother elbow saw
in the clinch. I tell you what,

1766
01:44:49,220 --> 01:44:53,060
I've never seen a female fighter fucked
another girl up with this much damage.

1767
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:57,320
Ever. Look at her face, man.
This is insane. She looks
like a monster movie. Yeah,

1768
01:44:57,321 --> 01:45:00,110
she has a giant Gash
on her nose real quick.

1769
01:45:00,111 --> 01:45:04,190
Tony are still into this or I'm, I
love this. Look, look at my girl.

1770
01:45:04,191 --> 01:45:07,430
She's covered in her opponents blood
like a fucking warrior and you're still

1771
01:45:07,431 --> 01:45:11,950
attracted. More attractive.
I like winners. Job Tony.

1772
01:45:11,960 --> 01:45:16,250
That's all the gay and Tony coming
to the surface itself in the form of

1773
01:45:17,760 --> 01:45:21,260
a real woman. You, you fucking,
you chauvinists. He's appearing.

1774
01:45:21,300 --> 01:45:24,730
He's imagining her with a
strap on right now. Tony,

1775
01:45:25,130 --> 01:45:28,580
what about Caitlyn Jenner or
left eye is closed. Her right?

1776
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:33,530
Eye's all fucked up too, man. Oh Jesus.
Look at this Combo. Hey, real quick.

1777
01:45:33,531 --> 01:45:37,900
Tough is Jessica. Remember Jay Jay's
115 pounds fucking girls up like this.

1778
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:42,000
You don't see damage like this at the, in
the female that kick to the body. Jesus.

1779
01:45:42,120 --> 01:45:46,500
Dan, just Jessica Payne is a bad,
bad, bad motherfucker. Yeah, she is.

1780
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:49,910
It's fitting that her name's penny cause
it looks like she is tomato sauce all

1781
01:45:49,911 --> 01:45:54,830
over your face
up on the hill.

1782
01:45:58,270 --> 01:45:59,810
But I said the better one for a second.

1783
01:45:59,811 --> 01:46:04,460
So hard to fight somebody
this good looking up blood.
I mean is a tomato sauce.

1784
01:46:04,580 --> 01:46:09,520
Come on. So wait till the third round.
So big browns predictions, right? No, no.

1785
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:16,970
He has this pass. What are you doing?
Got a new favorite female fighter. Yeah,

1786
01:46:16,971 --> 01:46:20,390
she's a beast bro. And he's tough and
I'm just kidding. Jay. Jay's my faith.

1787
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:28,700
Second seconds nation.

1788
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:33,890
My grantee Kale baby man.
Dude, this is so impressive.

1789
01:46:33,891 --> 01:46:38,660
And look at this. Panay is still working
for the tape. She's super flexible,

1790
01:46:38,661 --> 01:46:43,310
son. Wow. This thing's
TK on the third baby.

1791
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:44,860
I want to say followers fans.

1792
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:49,710
So it's like I'm a fucking
so fucking impressed with
my God. I love, look at her.

1793
01:46:49,711 --> 01:46:53,880
Fuck you gash on her nose.
Stop that. Oh my God,

1794
01:46:53,881 --> 01:46:56,880
look at the cutter knows I've never seen
a cut on and I was like that before.

1795
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:59,400
I'm going to be here now
because it's a female.

1796
01:46:59,401 --> 01:47:01,770
Will they stop it early and
then if it was a male for it.

1797
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:04,920
It depends on a lot of experience with
this email fighting. We're in Germany,

1798
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:08,580
right? Oh my God. That's a huge
gash. And you do it. Most man. Well,

1799
01:47:08,581 --> 01:47:11,310
they put adrenaline on it and
they could try to close it up.

1800
01:47:11,311 --> 01:47:16,180
They close it up with Vaseline.
Ouch. Ouch. Ouch. Oh fuck that. It's,

1801
01:47:16,260 --> 01:47:18,630
I think it was an elbow
that lit her up elbow.

1802
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:23,550
That was him right there.
Immediately. The blood SLOs. Jj.

1803
01:47:23,551 --> 01:47:26,370
He's my favorite fighter now. Hey Tony.
I'm on board. I don't want to fuck her,

1804
01:47:26,371 --> 01:47:30,590
but she's my favorite. She's my
favorite fight and fucking in man.

1805
01:47:30,990 --> 01:47:34,590
This bitch is bad. Hey, real quick. I
never watched her fine. I gotta be honest.

1806
01:47:34,591 --> 01:47:36,930
I don't watch a lot of
girl fight Ronda fight.

1807
01:47:36,931 --> 01:47:39,540
Somebody in that way class with this kind
of striking would be very interesting

1808
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:41,070
on that side,
but not really

1809
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:47,450
in fucking tosser 20 feet.
There's some nose dad.

1810
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:52,650
Her nose was just totally smashed. What
a bad ass. You've got to give it up, man.

1811
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:54,980
Oh, Jessica Bernays. No
joke. Jasmine Benet. No,

1812
01:47:54,981 --> 01:47:58,260
you don't get to this level without
fucking being tough. Come on, man.

1813
01:47:58,261 --> 01:48:02,070
This is different. This is more than
tough. This is transcended the well,

1814
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:05,010
this is fucking no easy.

1815
01:48:08,490 --> 01:48:13,140
Easy to know for sure.
Take it. Come on Jessica.

1816
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:16,690
Wow. Come on girl, Baby. So Crystal,

1817
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:20,370
Jessica [inaudible] toughness, man. So
impressed. Ouch. Keep your hands up.

1818
01:48:20,430 --> 01:48:24,480
Please keep hands. I've never seen a
little hundred 15 pound female fighter.

1819
01:48:24,481 --> 01:48:27,570
Fucked a girl up like this
in my entire life. So good.

1820
01:48:27,610 --> 01:48:31,060
It's Cyborg doesn't do this to girls.
She fucking sledge.

1821
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:35,050
Sledgehammers the hands out,
but she doesn't have this
kind of technique. No. Ouch.

1822
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:35,940
Keep your hands up please.

1823
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:40,980
I've never seen a little hundred 15 pound
female fighter fucked the girl up like

1824
01:48:40,981 --> 01:48:45,050
this in my entire life. So good Cyborg
doesn't do this to girls. She had that.

1825
01:48:45,051 --> 01:48:47,580
She had fucking sledge
hammers the hands out,

1826
01:48:48,150 --> 01:48:50,760
but she doesn't have this
kind of technique. No. Wow.

1827
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,300
Look at the wealth above and below her.

1828
01:48:54,301 --> 01:48:59,200
I don't let her get Jesus
Christ next for Jay Jay. No,

1829
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:04,020
it's want to sign up for it took a day
to day and her had a really close fight.

1830
01:49:04,150 --> 01:49:08,460
She wanted to split decisions.
Yeah. You're talking about
the 2.0 Jay Jay. Yeah.

1831
01:49:08,461 --> 01:49:12,250
Well she's a different
Jj. No, she's got it.

1832
01:49:12,430 --> 01:49:16,350
She's got the another elbow for sure.
Finish this round some right though. Jj,

1833
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:21,560
what are you talking about? What?
It froze. Oh, we'll reboot it,

1834
01:49:21,561 --> 01:49:24,600
man. Reboot. It just rebooted.

1835
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:28,690
Rebooted bull shit.
God.

1836
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:32,190
Can they hear the recording?
It's still live. Right? Recording

1837
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:38,590
Jessica [inaudible] contact.
She's amazing. She's, she's tired.

1838
01:49:38,591 --> 01:49:42,270
I'm looking at when she
keeps moving, man. Fuck Dude.

1839
01:49:42,271 --> 01:49:45,420
She is definitely tough as fuck.
She's so tough.

1840
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,380
She just doesn't have
an answer to this now.

1841
01:49:47,470 --> 01:49:50,430
Who does look at the
swelling all over face?

1842
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:55,390
Not that I still moving her head still.
Pinay is definitely game. God is,

1843
01:49:55,391 --> 01:49:59,710
she had her hands up. Tam. Hands up. God,

1844
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:02,170
I'm stressed out. Low left. Took

1845
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:08,410
why he's stressed out. I like to see
girls get fucked. Oh really? I don't,

1846
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:11,800
I don't hate them exactly.
To Brendon. I don't either.
I Hate Austin. I'm exhausted.

1847
01:50:12,450 --> 01:50:16,150
I cringed. I don't feel, I feel
sick aunt and my hands feel numb.

1848
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:20,680
Jj is a fucking nightmare machine. She
hasn't been touched. It's just no good.

1849
01:50:20,710 --> 01:50:24,580
She's no joke. That's for sure,
man. Her technique is so beautiful.

1850
01:50:24,640 --> 01:50:25,800
I want to see her go to the body.

1851
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:30,200
I like how she switches up
to southpaw orthodox. Either.

1852
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:36,400
That Jab is ridiculous. God Damn. Ouch.

1853
01:50:36,910 --> 01:50:40,390
Oh,
Jessica pinay with the clinch.

1854
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,130
You want to get a little careless there.

1855
01:50:43,060 --> 01:50:46,580
Jessica trying to drag her to the ground,
could drag him to the ground.

1856
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:47,650
Look at this

1857
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:54,300
part to get her down and knock her nose
off of her to get her down on the knee.

1858
01:50:56,260 --> 01:51:00,580
Oh, it's squirting out of that girl's
face. Is that a hell of a fight?

1859
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,110
Fuck yeah, it is, man.

1860
01:51:02,860 --> 01:51:07,270
I think it's interesting that the UFC as
male centric as it has been for so long

1861
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:10,540
is a leader in feminist,
like a feminist activity,

1862
01:51:10,541 --> 01:51:14,790
like a leader in women's
fighting and it's, and it's
as exciting as men's, right?

1863
01:51:14,830 --> 01:51:17,590
Well, there's no women's boxing
of any prominence right now.

1864
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:22,540
You don't know of any women's champions.
Nobody talks about in the other leaks.

1865
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:25,120
There's just not, well, there's
Invicta, right? They're all female.

1866
01:51:25,121 --> 01:51:27,640
But to this boxing,
I mean there's only,

1867
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:32,790
there's only a lion fight that has
women's Moyie Thai fights, time bomb.

1868
01:51:33,250 --> 01:51:35,110
She's that shoot.

1869
01:51:35,111 --> 01:51:37,750
I just watched the other day I was sewing
president to tweet it out. I was like,

1870
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:42,430
God damn, tiff, time bumped that beast.
She's a beast. Get a girl like that.

1871
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:46,990
The traffic to son. Get a girl
to learn how to sprawl. Right.

1872
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,960
Enjoy that. Well, young JJ on
your hands that he's there you go.

1873
01:51:50,590 --> 01:51:52,990
Well she's at that same
level if not higher. Yeah,

1874
01:51:52,991 --> 01:51:57,991
she's a Maltese and measuring shot and
Tiffany could go do some modeling she

1875
01:51:58,091 --> 01:52:00,610
wanted to to, you know what I'm say
up. That's when you get a superstar.

1876
01:52:00,640 --> 01:52:05,360
Now that JJ can be a superstar.
Hobos man, those elbows in tight. Jj,

1877
01:52:05,380 --> 01:52:10,240
go ahead and finish her for me,
girl. Hey Brendan. When is that way?

1878
01:52:10,241 --> 01:52:12,850
What does the doctor do?
Their stuff it, they uh,

1879
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,790
how much they can put things
in them in it, but like up it.

1880
01:52:15,791 --> 01:52:19,150
But then in the back they set, they set
your notes. I've had my nose set twice.

1881
01:52:19,720 --> 01:52:23,290
I said, Ooh, your Adrenaline Jab.

1882
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:30,030
That's Tareq and right
hand. Now I'll call it,

1883
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:36,730
nailed it and fight. It was crazy.
She's a beast. She is a fucking beast.

1884
01:52:36,731 --> 01:52:40,630
Slugger. Airy. Look at that blood on
that. No one wants a piece of that son.

1885
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,713
Who's next?

1886
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:51,950
Who's next? Yeah. What did she look to
the car, Tony, you get fucked up tonight.

1887
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:57,600
I love it. To fucking
Badass. She's so cool. God,

1888
01:52:57,690 --> 01:53:02,540
she's a police man. Mad Respect for
Jessica. Danny's a fan favorite.

1889
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:07,070
Now you cannot be a fantasy show. Tough.
Oh look at her fucking nose, dude.

1890
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,260
Look at her nose. Oh my God. Oh my God.

1891
01:53:12,261 --> 01:53:16,380
That knows.
Now when you get a gash like that,

1892
01:53:17,320 --> 01:53:21,380
that opens up easier the next time.
Right? Scar tissue. Yeah, on the nose.

1893
01:53:21,381 --> 01:53:23,390
It's not too bad.
It's on the ice where you're in trouble.

1894
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:29,790
They're going to repair it. They'll do
a great job. Did you see? Um, uh, Dave,

1895
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:33,240
who the fuck showed? Uh, oh, um, uh,

1896
01:53:33,560 --> 01:53:37,230
Raquel Pennington brew cal paint and
had a big gash on her forehead and then

1897
01:53:37,231 --> 01:53:41,390
show me pictures of it before and
after like the job that they did like

1898
01:53:41,391 --> 01:53:44,750
repairing it. They did an amazing
job. Like you can't even see the scar.

1899
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:46,760
I don't know how the fuck they did it.

1900
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:52,330
I mean they have like really good plastic
surgeons these days. Scar tissues.

1901
01:53:52,360 --> 01:53:56,840
A mother Fucker, man. Yeah
it did. And people scar
differently. Like black people,

1902
01:53:56,930 --> 01:54:01,160
they tend to get more keloid scars there
for some reason. Their scars like they,

1903
01:54:01,161 --> 01:54:04,980
they have like thicker wealth type
co scars. A stickup higher. Mm.

1904
01:54:06,190 --> 01:54:09,320
Depends on the person. It depends
on it's side of, it's genetic.

1905
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:14,330
I had a nose job after I fought cro cop
and he shattered my nose with an elbow

1906
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,630
Chan. I was worried. I was like, God, am I
me fucked from now? And the doctor's like,

1907
01:54:17,631 --> 01:54:20,570
no, your nose probably won't
ever break again. Because what?

1908
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:24,440
The way they structure it, they, they're
so advanced now it's stronger. Wow.

1909
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:28,130
Stronger after you break it. How do they
do? What are they doing? I'm not sure.

1910
01:54:28,131 --> 01:54:31,380
Because he threw an APP. What? Like
shattered my nose into pieces, right?

1911
01:54:31,410 --> 01:54:36,260
We put like a mesh net and it
almost, oh, face isn't touched.

1912
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:40,460
Look at her fucking face.
Look at Jessica's face. Kind
of feel bad dude. How about,

1913
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:43,040
what's she gonna look like in
the six hours? That's awful man.

1914
01:54:43,910 --> 01:54:47,360
Look at this fucking monster.
Not touched. Not touched.

1915
01:54:48,100 --> 01:54:51,140
Does she's a bad ass. Get somebody
that far ahead of you and striking.

1916
01:54:51,141 --> 01:54:51,800
What are you gonna do?

1917
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,560
I mean she's so try and take them
down cause she's far ahead of her and

1918
01:54:54,561 --> 01:54:58,160
grappling. But now it's just pay off.
Yeah. Not just far ahead and striking,

1919
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:00,350
but takedown defense as well.
Unbelievable.

1920
01:55:00,351 --> 01:55:03,920
Take out these ads or take down
defense is nasty. Finable balance.

1921
01:55:04,670 --> 01:55:07,490
Dan Hardee rocking the
fucking converse all stars.

1922
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:12,020
She's totally about the take. It's
Mike from him. If he could, if he left,

1923
01:55:12,021 --> 01:55:14,330
the other ones have its current
crank this up so we can hear this

1924
01:55:17,770 --> 01:55:19,220
and again and again and again

1925
01:55:23,660 --> 01:55:24,493
from me.

1926
01:55:27,850 --> 01:55:30,410
These five we'll do the one.

1927
01:55:31,710 --> 01:55:33,660
Not really. It's more of a beat. Well,

1928
01:55:33,661 --> 01:55:37,350
it's a kind of war like when
the UFC has a world like this.

1929
01:55:37,351 --> 01:55:39,940
It's sort of like when the United
States invades Afghanistan. Yeah.

1930
01:55:39,950 --> 01:55:43,050
It's kind of a war I guess,
where we're just like, we got

1931
01:55:45,630 --> 01:55:48,480
God. Come on. Give me a shout out.

1932
01:55:50,050 --> 01:55:53,670
Could you imagine my number one fan,
Tony Hinchcliffe Golden Pony,

1933
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:57,810
golden pony on the topic.
I had an idea to success and victory.

1934
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:04,610
I think she said it. It's our belt. This

1935
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:10,540
get to the face kid. Ooh,
that's no fun. Oh yeah.

1936
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:25,500
Jay Jay's my favorite fun.
Her angles are amazing.

1937
01:56:27,720 --> 01:56:29,720
Dammit.
Mark are

1938
01:56:32,150 --> 01:56:36,390
God damn. She's good. I
agree with you. A big brown.

1939
01:56:36,391 --> 01:56:39,540
This is so important for this division
to have a dominant champ like that to

1940
01:56:39,541 --> 01:56:40,960
really make everybody excited about it.

1941
01:56:40,961 --> 01:56:43,920
It seems to think if there was no
Rhonda at one 35 what do we do?

1942
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:49,800
What are you doing? What's going to
change nonstop? Yeah. There's nothing.

1943
01:56:50,010 --> 01:56:53,160
There's no, that's a problem with Rhonda
at that weight class. That was it.

1944
01:56:53,570 --> 01:56:57,540
Less Cyborg and get down to one 35 who
do you anticipate to see? Even a channel.

1945
01:56:57,570 --> 01:57:01,210
Rhonda is a different story because
she's such a dominant champion.

1946
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:04,110
She's just destroying it now. It's
like, all right, this isn't cool.

1947
01:57:04,170 --> 01:57:08,970
Like she's like,
she's moved past that 0.41 15 we need it.

1948
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:12,120
But around has already gone past that
point where we have to have some sort of

1949
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:15,060
competition. Cause like I bet
when she fights in Brazil,

1950
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:18,660
I bet the numbers aren't great concern.
She's destroying bitches.

1951
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:22,680
You get the Mike Tyson effect where
you're too good. Where it's like hold up.

1952
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:27,080
I'm not going to spend $70 a c or
merge some girl in 15 seconds. Right.

1953
01:57:27,270 --> 01:57:30,420
Cause the comp tickets then,
not that she's not fighting good fighters,

1954
01:57:30,421 --> 01:57:34,230
but people assume that they're not
good and Ron has just been spoonfed,

1955
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:36,510
which is not true.
Oh look at that fucking elbow.

1956
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:41,640
Do you think batchko HIA has a chance
at she not. She has nothing. Oh really?

1957
01:57:41,641 --> 01:57:44,580
Batch and your talk shit about
Rhonda is deck commit suicide.

1958
01:57:44,610 --> 01:57:46,890
You fucked up so good.
Yeah.

1959
01:57:46,891 --> 01:57:51,000
Well she said she doesn't
commit suicide after the fight.

1960
01:57:51,570 --> 01:57:55,280
She didn't apparently said she didn't
know that her dad's suicide. You know,

1961
01:57:55,290 --> 01:57:57,030
believe, believer, no, I don't
believe her. She may not.

1962
01:57:57,090 --> 01:58:00,390
I think she got too much heat and
then she was like, oh that's gross.

1963
01:58:01,030 --> 01:58:05,460
But you give Rhonda reason to break your
motherfucking arm cause her dad what?

1964
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:09,700
Dude? She's in trouble and, but the UFC
is doing everything they can to black.

1965
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,040
All right.
This one's going to be close.

1966
01:58:11,130 --> 01:58:16,020
We're centered to Brazil to fight in
the home country of batch. Now come on.

1967
01:58:16,890 --> 01:58:20,550
Wow. It's too much man. But
it's not Rhonda his fault,

1968
01:58:20,551 --> 01:58:24,420
but the public views it as,
oh they're just tossing anyone to Rhonda.

1969
01:58:24,421 --> 01:58:26,880
But that's what's the best
available. It's not. Rhonda is fall.

1970
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:32,170
There's your girl Toni, look at her.
Keeping my eye on these coaches are hers.

1971
01:58:32,171 --> 01:58:37,080
I got a little touchy.
Your fucking hands up high girl.

1972
01:58:38,760 --> 01:58:43,030
She's so good. Does she have a nickname?
No, they need to make one for you.

1973
01:58:43,150 --> 01:58:47,500
Refer to as j j j j is a good name for
him and I like change market that man.

1974
01:58:47,590 --> 01:58:51,670
Yeah, no, I liked Jay Jay, I think.
I think you nailed it. The other one,

1975
01:58:51,671 --> 01:58:53,380
the jerk or a Dick?
I don't think we should use that.

1976
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:56,740
I just didn't know what to say.
I took some heat

1977
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:03,940
press with her, man. He too fucking
technique is so spectacular.

1978
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:06,760
Scary little thing. She's so good, dude.

1979
01:59:06,761 --> 01:59:09,520
I've never seen a female
fighter just destroy,

1980
01:59:09,521 --> 01:59:13,120
grow and break her down and do that
damage better than Cyborg. Way Better.

1981
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:14,410
Way Better.
Way More.

1982
01:59:14,411 --> 01:59:17,800
Way more skillful and not just
overwhelmingly physically dominant.

1983
01:59:17,860 --> 01:59:21,640
It's all technique because yes,
girls with submissions,

1984
01:59:21,641 --> 01:59:23,920
but she's not like cutting
and breaking them down.

1985
01:59:23,921 --> 01:59:28,810
Destroying this girl cologic a Dahlia
and her had a very close fight. This,

1986
01:59:28,811 --> 01:59:31,210
this is the next one in line
because Claude, you could Dahlia,

1987
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:35,020
they went to a fucking split decision.
They went to war. Man. A good day.

1988
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:39,010
It took her down like a day is now. Joe,
Tim's good day is pretty. And by the way,

1989
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:43,300
I thought day you'll won the fight. Wow. I
fucked. Could tell you one. The decision,

1990
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:46,470
I thought it was very close. She's gonna
fuck with Dell. You're wanting to resign.

1991
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:50,270
Yeah. 12 and one and that
one is to Yolana. Wow.

1992
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:55,320
The one and the one was a very
fucking close fight to JJ.

1993
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:59,470
Now they fight,
I want to say a year and a half ago.

1994
02:00:00,710 --> 02:00:03,640
You're dealing with a confident
JJ, right? Yeah. It was before her,

1995
02:00:03,641 --> 02:00:07,120
her title fight with,
um, it was to set up the,

1996
02:00:07,230 --> 02:00:09,920
the title fight with Esparza.
She,

1997
02:00:09,970 --> 02:00:14,540
Michelle Waterson in their division
now though. She's, she's not,

1998
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:17,890
she's in the UFC now. Oh really?
The broader signed with UFC. Yeah.

1999
02:00:18,160 --> 02:00:20,740
She's fighting similarly.
She looks heavily Musk muscled.

2000
02:00:20,830 --> 02:00:25,420
I wonder if some of that is help get
diarrhea. Yeah, she might test positive.

2001
02:00:25,421 --> 02:00:27,470
Well Michelle Waterson they'll beat,
uh,

2002
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:32,140
submitted Jessica Penne a shallow water
sense of peace. Yeah. She has a beast.

2003
02:00:32,140 --> 02:00:33,430
She's very Jackson's.
Yeah.

2004
02:00:34,280 --> 02:00:36,370
You won't talk about someone
who for sure stopped doing that.

2005
02:00:36,430 --> 02:00:38,680
You want to talk about someone
who's super marketable,

2006
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:42,160
Michelle Waterson cause she's
really pretty too. It's true. Well,

2007
02:00:42,161 --> 02:00:46,030
they need that man and they need to make
sure that she's ready because she won't

2008
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:50,600
be pretty after Chavon answers. Right.
Girl tend to unpretty if on you,

2009
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:55,800
she goes, look at her. Who's next?
Who's next? Next. Next. Next. Geez.

2010
02:00:57,330 --> 02:01:01,240
She's only 27 two men. She has
what they need now. When, when she,

2011
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,070
what did she study?

2012
02:01:02,070 --> 02:01:05,470
Just strict more time cause it looks
like boxing six time world champion.

2013
02:01:05,471 --> 02:01:09,790
She's definitely got great hands. Well
Shit. Holland Dutch came white tie is,

2014
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:11,500
you know,
more ties boxing as well.

2015
02:01:11,501 --> 02:01:15,160
Like there's a lot of Moitai Thai
fighters like yachts and climbs up fucking

2016
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:19,840
Badass boxer. I mean Moitai is not
mean that they don't have good hands.

2017
02:01:20,140 --> 02:01:24,820
Especially today in this day and age
before guys like Ramon Decker came over to

2018
02:01:24,821 --> 02:01:28,030
Holland. A lot of those guys didn't
concentrate in their hands as much.

2019
02:01:28,210 --> 02:01:30,790
But once the European guys
and once some of the uh,

2020
02:01:30,791 --> 02:01:35,040
American guys started going over to
Holland or to Thailand and fighting you,

2021
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:37,930
you started to see a lot more
hand techniques from the ties,

2022
02:01:38,710 --> 02:01:42,830
the or the motherfucker because people
are really good with the elbows man.

2023
02:01:43,060 --> 02:01:47,540
Somebody like her star,
like what she does or look at Cro cop,

2024
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:50,330
Conor Mcgregor, 2008 Oh, crank that up.

2025
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:55,460
Oh well he handles, it's all over
his face in 2000 looking sharp.

2026
02:01:55,760 --> 02:01:56,960
He really stepped his game up.

2027
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:08,910
You got a big head, Huh? All right.
Yes, it does. Noggin. I'm the future.

2028
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:11,310
That's when he was like 16 damn man.

2029
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,780
He was about to retire two years ago.
Yeah, about to retire. He had a friend,

2030
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:21,340
apparently his friend had got so battered
up in a fight that they told him never

2031
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:23,650
fight him. Fight again.
Yeah. It was really worried,

2032
02:02:23,651 --> 02:02:26,000
like thinking about his life
going, fuck, what am I doing?

2033
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:29,600
It was out of the gym is coach called him.
Doc offered him a fight.

2034
02:02:30,170 --> 02:02:31,910
He didn't answer the phone.
He told a story on a podcast.

2035
02:02:31,911 --> 02:02:35,180
He didn't answer the phone over and over
again. Finally it was like, Oh fuck it.

2036
02:02:35,181 --> 02:02:37,610
I'll pick it up. How crazy.
The Anderson Silva, same thing,

2037
02:02:37,900 --> 02:02:40,780
basically was going to walk away and
know. Kara was like, no man, this,

2038
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,680
let's just see what happens.
Keep going.

2039
02:02:42,681 --> 02:02:45,830
They get signed by the UFC
and does fuck Chris Liebing.

2040
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:47,620
He was retired and no guarantee.

2041
02:02:47,630 --> 02:02:49,610
That's why he owes his career
that he says that he goes,

2042
02:02:49,730 --> 02:02:52,760
I owe everything to Nogueira
because big nog was like, no man.

2043
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,920
Just keep going for a little bit.
Let's see what happens.

2044
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,260
And he talked him into it.
What does and do now?

2045
02:02:57,261 --> 02:03:01,160
I mean he's in this weird predicament
too with the drug testing where they uh,

2046
02:03:01,161 --> 02:03:06,161
apparently they found like he had to two
samples and one of them tested positive

2047
02:03:07,310 --> 02:03:10,280
and the other one from a different
lab did not test positive.

2048
02:03:10,281 --> 02:03:13,490
So this is dispute as to
which one was correct.

2049
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:17,450
That's the thing that bothers
me is he just denies it.

2050
02:03:17,510 --> 02:03:20,540
Like he should just come on back.
Listen, my leg was fucked up.

2051
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:24,470
I used some stuff to get my leg better.
He said that I don't think he did.

2052
02:03:24,471 --> 02:03:27,870
He's well, from what I've hear he's
denied any bit of it. Really. Yeah.

2053
02:03:27,920 --> 02:03:29,720
Cause he went on the ultimate
fighter and he was like,

2054
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:34,370
I've never taken steroids is bullshit.
It's all a scam. I thought he said Anders,

2055
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:38,540
I thought they said Anderson admitted to
taking something to heal his leg but it

2056
02:03:38,541 --> 02:03:40,910
was out of competition.
And then once he,

2057
02:03:41,310 --> 02:03:46,070
because he tested positive more than once,
you know, tested positive before the,

2058
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:50,450
before the fight in camp. And then he
tested positive again after the fight.

2059
02:03:50,490 --> 02:03:53,960
But said negative after
the first positive.

2060
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:55,520
I'm always fascinated with those,

2061
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:58,590
those moments in your life where
one person says one thing to you,

2062
02:03:58,591 --> 02:04:01,070
when it changes the course of your life,
what do you mean? You know what I mean?

2063
02:04:01,130 --> 02:04:05,180
Like when somebody goes, okay, don't,
don't quit. Keep going. Maybe one more.

2064
02:04:05,450 --> 02:04:09,300
And you think of those times that were
seminal in your mind and your life will

2065
02:04:09,301 --> 02:04:10,910
be that one person,
one teacher,

2066
02:04:10,911 --> 02:04:15,060
one guy who says one productive
thing or one negative thing. Well,

2067
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:16,430
I stopped competing.

2068
02:04:16,460 --> 02:04:20,780
I stopped fighting and I focus 100% on
comedy because this one kid at an open

2069
02:04:20,781 --> 02:04:23,780
mic night said to me that I was
really good when I first started,

2070
02:04:23,781 --> 02:04:28,140
but I've drifted off. Oh, I was like,
fuck, he's right. I really was right.

2071
02:04:28,190 --> 02:04:30,500
I didn't even get upset. I was like,
he's right. It was like six months in.

2072
02:04:30,501 --> 02:04:34,330
It stung. It's fucking,
it's so important though.

2073
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:38,900
It's so important to hear that Joe
sit with it. I'll tell him, Brian, um,

2074
02:04:38,940 --> 02:04:42,960
the talk we had right about not fighting
anymore and how I need to move on,

2075
02:04:43,320 --> 02:04:46,950
but we were talking, I was
talking to Nate, more carts,

2076
02:04:46,951 --> 02:04:50,220
head coach and um,

2077
02:04:50,490 --> 02:04:52,170
I sent him what Nate tweeted out,

2078
02:04:52,171 --> 02:04:55,570
how he made all the excuses and
they tweeted back and he, yeah, he,

2079
02:04:55,580 --> 02:04:59,490
he wasn't feeling it. He was
sick. I'm like, no, no, no,
no, no. I get that. I get that.

2080
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:01,410
It's time to move on man.

2081
02:05:01,411 --> 02:05:05,640
You have got to tell him it's your
guys' duties to move on and then hit me.

2082
02:05:05,641 --> 02:05:06,120
I'm like,

2083
02:05:06,120 --> 02:05:11,120
this is why fucking Joe was so honest
with me because if you kind of skimp

2084
02:05:11,821 --> 02:05:13,710
around it and you, and
you leave the, you know,

2085
02:05:13,711 --> 02:05:16,530
like you kind of leave an open
door worried about their feelings.

2086
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:20,040
I can come with a million excuses
why it can be world champ.

2087
02:05:20,041 --> 02:05:22,710
You know what I'm saying?
But you have the fuck it's going to hurt.

2088
02:05:22,711 --> 02:05:25,920
Like a mother fucking might ruin your
career, but you just fucking hit him.

2089
02:05:25,921 --> 02:05:29,970
Right straight man. He got to be dead
honest because even his coach is like, no,

2090
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,750
he can figure this out. I'm like,
no, no, no motherfucker, it's over.

2091
02:05:33,840 --> 02:05:36,510
You have got to tell them it's
time to move on. Like yeah,

2092
02:05:36,511 --> 02:05:38,370
but he might do this for what?

2093
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:42,480
So the UFC gives them these young lines
and they make a name off of them for

2094
02:05:42,481 --> 02:05:44,730
white man. He has heat. There's just,

2095
02:05:44,910 --> 02:05:47,310
there's things we're seeing
where it's not good. Yeah.

2096
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:51,240
There's a certain point in time where
your time's past you and you've got to

2097
02:05:51,241 --> 02:05:52,380
understand when the time is.

2098
02:05:52,440 --> 02:05:55,770
And the only way to understand when
their time is is you have to be objective

2099
02:05:55,771 --> 02:05:56,310
with yourself.

2100
02:05:56,310 --> 02:05:59,040
You have to be honest with yourself and
you need someone to tell you you can't

2101
02:05:59,041 --> 02:06:00,570
be objective and honest with stuff.

2102
02:06:00,571 --> 02:06:03,380
Cause you don't get to an elite
level fighting being objective.

2103
02:06:03,660 --> 02:06:07,950
You don't because you know,
do I still believe I can be
a champion? Yeah, I do. No,

2104
02:06:07,951 --> 02:06:10,770
you know, no matter what, especially now,
like what if our Lawsky beats for doom.

2105
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,420
And then you look at our
Lawsky and your fight,

2106
02:06:12,421 --> 02:06:15,000
which was you could have easily won
that fight. I definitely beat them.

2107
02:06:15,001 --> 02:06:18,270
But you know, look at that and you go,
well how can be champ? Yeah, yeah. Which,

2108
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:22,650
which is great. But to me it's
like, um, when, when I never,

2109
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:25,530
it never hit me till till I was talking
to Nate and I was like, oh my God,

2110
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:28,310
this is what Joe did with me.
Like you,

2111
02:06:28,490 --> 02:06:33,060
you have to be so fucking honest and
you can't tiptoe around their feelings

2112
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:34,950
because they're not going to get it.
It's really weird.

2113
02:06:34,951 --> 02:06:37,740
Like sometimes you'll see like I
was the first time I appreciate it,

2114
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:41,310
but that literally last week was the
first time I ever was like, oh my God,

2115
02:06:41,580 --> 02:06:42,960
I get it.
Cause fighters,

2116
02:06:43,080 --> 02:06:46,350
you don't get to that level
without this crazy confidence man.

2117
02:06:46,530 --> 02:06:48,990
And people tell you stuff
and sometimes not good.

2118
02:06:48,991 --> 02:06:50,610
You have to block that
out and just keep going.

2119
02:06:50,611 --> 02:06:53,310
What's also different than anything else?
Like if you were a musician,

2120
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:54,720
no one would ever talk to you like that.

2121
02:06:54,900 --> 02:06:56,700
But the difference
between being a musician,

2122
02:06:56,701 --> 02:07:00,960
making bad songs and being a fighter
and getting punched in the face is that

2123
02:07:00,961 --> 02:07:05,130
you're going to suffer for the rest of
your life with any unnecessary damage

2124
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:07,440
that you take.
And the more you can stop that,

2125
02:07:07,441 --> 02:07:09,570
the more you can have a
great rest of your life.

2126
02:07:09,600 --> 02:07:11,250
You know what a friend told
me that though when I was,

2127
02:07:11,310 --> 02:07:14,400
we were arguing about Nate. I'm like,
Bro, I'll fucking talk to them. Right?

2128
02:07:14,730 --> 02:07:18,480
Cause me and Nate are very close and I
was like, I'll talk to him. But he goes,

2129
02:07:18,481 --> 02:07:19,950
all right.
He goes to different stream.

2130
02:07:19,951 --> 02:07:24,951
Joe Talking to you and you talking
to Nate is you have other options.

2131
02:07:26,220 --> 02:07:29,060
I don't have to ever fight
again. I'm fucking fine, man.

2132
02:07:29,061 --> 02:07:32,970
My life's actually better now. I'm
not fighting so much way better. Nay.

2133
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:36,850
What's Nate going to do? It's true
or any father not on the article.

2134
02:07:36,851 --> 02:07:39,790
I'm just saying I started fighters.
I don't know coach. Yeah, it's hard.

2135
02:07:40,190 --> 02:07:42,760
It's hard when most guys
don't prepare for your kids.

2136
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:45,100
They also don't have that kind
of personality that you have.

2137
02:07:45,101 --> 02:07:48,640
That translates really easily into
podcasting and fucking around and being in

2138
02:07:48,641 --> 02:07:50,110
fucking around whether you're doing,

2139
02:07:50,111 --> 02:07:53,170
you guys are having fun and getting
paid fucking around around. Yeah, yeah.

2140
02:07:53,171 --> 02:07:57,310
You're fucking around and cracking jokes
and you know that's, it's entertaining.

2141
02:07:57,310 --> 02:08:00,480
And he's not that guy. He was done there
attain, but the guy was talking to him.

2142
02:08:00,490 --> 02:08:01,930
I can say his name, but
he just goes, he goes,

2143
02:08:01,931 --> 02:08:04,690
that's easy for you to say because you
can walk away and you're gonna make more

2144
02:08:04,691 --> 02:08:08,170
money not fighting. So you're like,
yeah, see everything's great and dandy.

2145
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:10,960
These other fighters, they don't
have that man to fall back to there.

2146
02:08:10,961 --> 02:08:14,620
There's no 401k. There's no retirement
plan. Right. Nate has four kids,

2147
02:08:14,621 --> 02:08:19,570
a wife of mortgage bills. Fighting's
his number one source of income.

2148
02:08:20,080 --> 02:08:24,400
You see him and then at least he's not
getting like stunned with every shot that

2149
02:08:24,401 --> 02:08:28,450
lands like gray Maynard,
gray, Maine or bugs me. You
know, I really liked that guy.

2150
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:31,150
He's a great man.
He's a good dude and a great fighter.

2151
02:08:31,151 --> 02:08:34,300
And it came that close to winning the
world title and now you see him and he

2152
02:08:34,301 --> 02:08:37,680
gets lit up when you see like his
body just starts short circuit.

2153
02:08:37,680 --> 02:08:41,650
Heartbreaking man. It's hard.
What if Reebok did this to
help fighters out? What,

2154
02:08:41,680 --> 02:08:46,680
this is a little off this and what if
Reebok said all right to help fighters out

2155
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,430
because you only get paid when you fight,
right?

2156
02:08:48,460 --> 02:08:50,350
So guys are hustling trying
to figure things out.

2157
02:08:50,620 --> 02:08:53,680
What if an awfully Reebok has the money
and obviously the UFC has the money

2158
02:08:53,681 --> 02:08:56,920
because they're drug testing every
fucking fighter a million times,

2159
02:08:56,921 --> 02:08:57,754
which is expensive.

2160
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:01,510
What if Reebok did a monthly payment
system where you're not forced to take

2161
02:09:01,511 --> 02:09:04,090
fights where you're not getting
injured and showing up for fights?

2162
02:09:04,250 --> 02:09:07,030
What if he did a monthly plan? It's
not, they don't have enough money.

2163
02:09:07,390 --> 02:09:08,830
There's not enough money invested in this.

2164
02:09:08,831 --> 02:09:11,980
You think about the $70 million
that Reebok put in over six years,

2165
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:15,400
which is nothing. Yeah, it's not much,
but you got 600 fighters or something.

2166
02:09:15,401 --> 02:09:17,950
I'm an OFAC 70 million
to rebus nothing but to,

2167
02:09:17,970 --> 02:09:21,100
to give people enough money to live
comfortably. I didn't say comfortably,

2168
02:09:21,101 --> 02:09:24,520
I'm just saying it helps out because
the fighters are losing tons a month.

2169
02:09:24,521 --> 02:09:28,420
He's right. Yeah. So you make that up
and they're not, you're not, you know,

2170
02:09:29,150 --> 02:09:32,710
risking fighting, injured stuff
like that. Brain trauma they get,

2171
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:35,280
they're getting monthly. So that
makes sense. Maybe. But you know,

2172
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:40,180
the real problem is securing a future
outside of fighting and what a guy like

2173
02:09:40,181 --> 02:09:44,740
you, you have more potential outside of
fighting now than anybody and more than

2174
02:09:44,741 --> 02:09:47,020
you've ever had before.
And as your podcast,

2175
02:09:47,340 --> 02:09:51,490
your podcast is fucking giant right
now and it's growing at this crazy rate

2176
02:09:51,860 --> 02:09:54,430
where you guys are millions and
millions of downloads every month.

2177
02:09:54,431 --> 02:09:56,080
It's going to keep going and going
and going and going and going.

2178
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:00,790
And it's just getting stratospheric.
They don't have that.

2179
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,420
They don't, and you have like all this
thing, you have something to work for,

2180
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:07,900
like you see,
you see like progress and excitement.

2181
02:10:07,901 --> 02:10:12,340
It's like you're making a
smooth transition. These
guys, they don't have that.

2182
02:10:12,341 --> 02:10:15,970
And when they don't have that, there's
literally nothing. Talk to your boy Shane.

2183
02:10:16,390 --> 02:10:17,430
You know what his car wouldn't doing.

2184
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:21,040
He's working as an engineer that has
just not the same as being the fucking

2185
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:25,720
heavyweight champ of the UFC has not the
same of the glory when he smashed Frank

2186
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:29,350
Mir, you know when he smashed
Frank Mir and got ahold of him,

2187
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:30,880
tied him up in that clinch.

2188
02:10:30,881 --> 02:10:34,340
It just ripping those fucking
uppercuts mean that is go

2189
02:10:34,340 --> 02:10:35,180
Lori.

2190
02:10:35,181 --> 02:10:39,200
Just Gloria on the highest
level excitement on the
highest level and when that

2191
02:10:39,201 --> 02:10:42,620
ends and also you're getting a paycheck
and the government gets a big piece of

2192
02:10:42,621 --> 02:10:46,850
that paycheck. I paychecks. Not
much anyway. No. Yeah, like I, I,

2193
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:51,120
it's depressing to talk about, it was
just true for fighters. Most, you know,

2194
02:10:51,160 --> 02:10:55,010
to my references, all dogs don't go to
heaven fighting. It's not like the movies,

2195
02:10:55,011 --> 02:10:58,520
man. This ain't no mark Wahlberg movie
where the credits roll and he's walked off

2196
02:10:58,521 --> 02:11:01,850
then sunset with a bag full of money
and it's usually not like that man.

2197
02:11:01,851 --> 02:11:05,420
You know? And we all know guys
that when we talk to them,

2198
02:11:05,421 --> 02:11:09,590
we see that diminishing things.
We see their eyes not focusing right.

2199
02:11:09,800 --> 02:11:10,700
We see their gate.

2200
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:14,190
One of the things that bothered me about
watching Nate fight was how closest

2201
02:11:14,210 --> 02:11:16,880
stance was.
There's something that happens when,

2202
02:11:16,881 --> 02:11:19,280
when fighters get hit
a lot with their legs,

2203
02:11:19,310 --> 02:11:23,300
they start moving their stance closer
and closer together and it's just like

2204
02:11:23,330 --> 02:11:25,990
they don't have that wide like,
you know, see how, you know,

2205
02:11:26,020 --> 02:11:30,740
Connor fights and he's getting this
wide stance. I fled up sneezing. When,

2206
02:11:30,741 --> 02:11:32,000
when guys get hit a lot,

2207
02:11:32,001 --> 02:11:35,390
they start moving their legs closer and
closer together and it's almost like

2208
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:39,180
they, their balances fuck their
motor skills are affected. You know,

2209
02:11:39,220 --> 02:11:42,980
it's one of the things that I talked
to a guy Medsker is working with this

2210
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:45,800
company in Dallas that um,
uh,

2211
02:11:45,801 --> 02:11:49,310
rehabilitates people from traumatic
brain injuries and it's one of the things

2212
02:11:49,311 --> 02:11:50,600
that they talked about is the gate.

2213
02:11:50,900 --> 02:11:55,010
Like you could see the differences in the
way people stand and the way they move

2214
02:11:55,011 --> 02:11:58,190
and the way they, they move inside
the ring. This is, there's a,

2215
02:11:58,850 --> 02:12:01,070
Ben and I were talking
about whether or not,

2216
02:12:01,450 --> 02:12:03,260
and it's a very tricky thing to pull off,

2217
02:12:03,261 --> 02:12:05,840
whether there should be
some kind of an expert body,

2218
02:12:06,130 --> 02:12:10,730
a governing body of experts who can
look at somebody in their fight and say,

2219
02:12:10,820 --> 02:12:14,180
you just can't fight anymore. You lose
your life. Okay, but you say that,

2220
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:14,930
but how do you,

2221
02:12:14,930 --> 02:12:18,390
how do you stop our Lawsky from
fighting [inaudible] because there were

2222
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:23,020
[inaudible] was on the way out. I'll
ask. He gets starched by Fader, right?

2223
02:12:23,030 --> 02:12:24,290
Starch flatline.

2224
02:12:24,500 --> 02:12:28,520
He gets a starched by a surgeon
or surrogate Keratan off,

2225
02:12:28,600 --> 02:12:31,130
kicked starches up for us.
You can get us the big foot,

2226
02:12:31,160 --> 02:12:35,060
beat the fuck out of them by rumble,
rumble, smashes him in the first round,

2227
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:37,790
breaks his jaw and you're looking at him,
you're like, this guy has got to stop.

2228
02:12:38,030 --> 02:12:41,840
Now he comes back to the UFC,
wins a couple of fights,

2229
02:12:41,900 --> 02:12:44,620
knocks out Travis Brown and he's
next in line for a fact. We say,

2230
02:12:44,630 --> 02:12:46,460
I would say the answer to
that is that's a hard case.

2231
02:12:46,461 --> 02:12:50,030
And to understand that this
exception, hard cases don't
make good laws. And, and I,

2232
02:12:50,031 --> 02:12:52,520
and I hear you. It's an
outlier. It's an outlier.

2233
02:12:52,521 --> 02:12:57,521
And I think if you'd have to weigh the
overall sort of benefit to to con to

2234
02:13:00,291 --> 02:13:03,350
that. So, so I do think that,

2235
02:13:04,670 --> 02:13:09,290
I do think that most of those, those
come back decisions could be avoided.

2236
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:10,010
Where you'd have,

2237
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:12,560
you'd make most of the dishes will be
very good if you had a group of people who

2238
02:13:12,561 --> 02:13:17,180
really know their shit and they took in
all the factors. Most people would go,

2239
02:13:17,420 --> 02:13:19,340
that person 36 years old,
whatever it was,

2240
02:13:19,341 --> 02:13:23,150
37 38 he's been starched
whatever many times.

2241
02:13:23,210 --> 02:13:26,870
He's not the same as I'm moving the
same. Right. He's got to stop. Okay.

2242
02:13:26,871 --> 02:13:28,450
How's he supposed to make
more and more important?

2243
02:13:28,580 --> 02:13:31,800
How do you tell him to stop when you
tell people it's okay to sky. Dot.

2244
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:35,880
We tell people it's okay to base jump.
It's a wingsuit and jump off a cliff.

2245
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:40,410
But is it also worth it? Like if
I'm a professional fucking swimmer,

2246
02:13:40,770 --> 02:13:44,280
that's like me having this great career
and be like, this is fucking crazy, man.

2247
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:46,720
I got wet. Yeah, you jumped in
water. You can get wet, you fight,

2248
02:13:46,721 --> 02:13:48,960
you get punched in the face
and head trauma, same shit.

2249
02:13:49,080 --> 02:13:51,750
So we know what we're signing up for.
Not the same shit though.

2250
02:13:51,751 --> 02:13:55,200
And the reason it's not the same shit
as that head trauma and the d and the

2251
02:13:55,201 --> 02:13:56,400
damage that these guys are taking,

2252
02:13:56,401 --> 02:13:58,800
they're going to pay for for the rest
of their life. And it's life shortening.

2253
02:13:59,010 --> 02:14:02,880
I don't think you could say the same thing
about things like swimming and things.

2254
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:07,110
So you don't think we know that that's
like, and I hate him more. And soldiers,

2255
02:14:07,370 --> 02:14:09,750
a soldier sign up for the Marines,

2256
02:14:09,900 --> 02:14:14,520
get going out on a fucking tour getting
shot me like what the fuck this is

2257
02:14:14,521 --> 02:14:15,260
bullshit man.

2258
02:14:15,260 --> 02:14:18,420
And addressing the fact that you don't
get to be a fighter and a great fighter.

2259
02:14:18,810 --> 02:14:19,110
Uh,

2260
02:14:19,110 --> 02:14:24,110
like a lot of the guys without being
objective is probably not your friend in

2261
02:14:24,301 --> 02:14:28,050
the ring when you're a young man
that's in all sports though. Football,

2262
02:14:29,550 --> 02:14:32,880
Joe Montana, which if it was up
to him, he'd still be slinging.

2263
02:14:32,881 --> 02:14:37,690
Football's a 49 or is that 60 years old
for every athlete's going to keep going

2264
02:14:37,691 --> 02:14:42,540
till? Well, the NFL and NBA is, it's very
simple, right? Nope, there's a young guy,

2265
02:14:42,541 --> 02:14:43,420
we're not paying anymore.

2266
02:14:43,870 --> 02:14:48,630
It really bums me out that they'd go
after a guy like Roger Clemens for using

2267
02:14:48,631 --> 02:14:53,400
growth hormone to throw a ball
faster. Cause like why? Like he's,

2268
02:14:53,401 --> 02:14:57,420
yeah, he's using some stuff, but by
the way, that stuff's not illegal.

2269
02:14:57,570 --> 02:15:01,140
It's not like he's using math.
Okay. He's using stuff that's legal.

2270
02:15:01,141 --> 02:15:04,830
You can buy it that your body produces
anyway. Your body produces in any way.

2271
02:15:04,890 --> 02:15:07,710
Scientists developed it.
It makes your body work better.

2272
02:15:07,711 --> 02:15:11,490
And all he's doing is prolonging
his career, throwing a baseball.

2273
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:12,920
He's investing in itself.

2274
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,410
No one's getting hurt from Roger
Clemens taking growth hormone and still

2275
02:15:16,440 --> 02:15:19,770
throwing. Every guy that he's
pitching to is on the same shit.

2276
02:15:20,130 --> 02:15:22,380
So what's the point?
And he's not hurting these guys.

2277
02:15:22,590 --> 02:15:25,810
It's not like he's kickboxing
and because of this, he's alive.

2278
02:15:26,250 --> 02:15:30,240
He's showing up with hyper human hormone
levels that allow him to absorb punches

2279
02:15:30,241 --> 02:15:35,241
like tic tacs and just see guys down raw
Vandelay in his prime with that kind of

2280
02:15:36,241 --> 02:15:37,074
shit.

2281
02:15:37,090 --> 02:15:42,090
It comes back down to the old idea of
competition sport on a fair playing field.

2282
02:15:42,450 --> 02:15:43,770
That's where that's,

2283
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:46,440
that would be the argument that the
commission would make and baseball, right?

2284
02:15:46,441 --> 02:15:49,890
They'd say, well, you know you,
you, you're, you have an advantage.

2285
02:15:49,950 --> 02:15:54,210
Then over the doesn't have an advantage
because he's still just a picture and

2286
02:15:54,211 --> 02:15:57,690
it's not like he's throwing some ball
190 miles an hour when no one's ever seen

2287
02:15:57,691 --> 02:16:02,670
that before. Throwing, he's throwing
pitches at a normal speed. I mean,

2288
02:16:02,671 --> 02:16:06,840
he's not doing anything unusual. I mean,
you know what I'm saying? I do. It's,

2289
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:09,650
I mean I think baseball is
one of the worst arguments.

2290
02:16:09,651 --> 02:16:14,651
I agree when it comes to steroids and
the amount of crap that Barry Bonds Tuck,

2291
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:20,280
like just being booed and bro, look bro,

2292
02:16:20,281 --> 02:16:23,400
he just broke the three
thousands home run. It's insane.

2293
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:25,050
He just passed like Hank Aaron,
Babe Ruth.

2294
02:16:25,051 --> 02:16:28,650
I was she and that is his piano cover it.
There's a little ticker at the bottom,

2295
02:16:28,740 --> 02:16:31,590
but not a lot. The Yankees, he
spoke at all of these bonuses.

2296
02:16:31,690 --> 02:16:33,190
There's Matthews are saying,
nope,

2297
02:16:33,220 --> 02:16:36,280
we can't mark this because you're known
as a steroid user. Yeah. He's like,

2298
02:16:36,281 --> 02:16:40,810
what the fuck to my contract? You want
me $6 million if I hit this milestone,

2299
02:16:40,840 --> 02:16:43,900
that's never been done. How many new
Yankees are saying, nope, we can't do it.

2300
02:16:44,640 --> 02:16:47,500
We can't market you. Hold on a
second. You voided the contract.

2301
02:16:47,501 --> 02:16:51,220
I'd been testified for steroids.
Is that true? 100% true. So he,

2302
02:16:51,221 --> 02:16:54,730
did he void his contract and be
legally, is it void the I, I, I'm not,

2303
02:16:54,740 --> 02:16:55,780
I don't know the contract,

2304
02:16:55,781 --> 02:16:59,530
but they're not paying him and he's
not putting up a fight either. Wow.

2305
02:16:59,560 --> 02:17:02,500
Look at Barry Bonds,
Marty golden gloves and Barry Bonds,

2306
02:17:02,501 --> 02:17:07,501
one nine sat a shitload and that steroids
are not can help you necessarily field

2307
02:17:08,351 --> 02:17:10,810
balls to that level and that skill,
well that's not true.

2308
02:17:11,020 --> 02:17:13,810
It's going to help you run faster.
You're going to get to the ball quicker.

2309
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:17,590
But I'm saying like you said, to your
point, a great deal of baseball is skill.

2310
02:17:17,800 --> 02:17:22,430
And I would say steroids for baseball
allow you to play longer so we'll know.

2311
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:24,670
It definitely allows you to hit
a ball harder. I understand.

2312
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:29,710
And be your bad speed. Faster. Bat weighs
less too, but you also play longer.

2313
02:17:29,740 --> 02:17:33,370
You can also just play into your late
thirties where you probably couldn't

2314
02:17:33,371 --> 02:17:35,860
because your bat speed slows down.
Now do you think,

2315
02:17:35,861 --> 02:17:38,020
and this comes with
bullying and all this shit,

2316
02:17:38,021 --> 02:17:41,920
do you think with society become a little
bit sissy sissified now it's like head

2317
02:17:41,921 --> 02:17:44,650
traumas, a baker deal. Cause head
traumas always been there and it's about,

2318
02:17:44,670 --> 02:17:46,780
we know more about it though.
We know more about it,

2319
02:17:46,781 --> 02:17:49,390
but at the same time it's like,
oh, we should stop this football.

2320
02:17:49,391 --> 02:17:52,180
They shouldn't play with helmets. Well,
when I signed up for football, I'm like,

2321
02:17:52,181 --> 02:17:55,090
all right, I'm clashing. My
helmet, he gets that dude.
It's probably not safe. Yeah,

2322
02:17:55,091 --> 02:17:57,850
but, but I do it. You thought it
was about your bowel was wrong.

2323
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,290
Now as we learned more and more about
not only what it does but the longterm

2324
02:18:02,350 --> 02:18:04,300
effects are harder to,

2325
02:18:04,510 --> 02:18:08,830
it's harder to condone it when you know
that the people that are doing it right

2326
02:18:08,831 --> 02:18:12,490
now are going to pay a very steep price
or could paste. It's harder for society,

2327
02:18:12,491 --> 02:18:15,520
I think, to deal with that. A lot
of athletes, they're variable.

2328
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:18,100
I think if you asked most of
the athletes like came in,

2329
02:18:18,310 --> 02:18:21,280
your brain's going to get fucked up.
It's going to take 10 years off your life.

2330
02:18:21,281 --> 02:18:25,830
He's still going to do it. Most of them
say yes. Well, because the hearing, yes,

2331
02:18:25,940 --> 02:18:26,860
they have no other options.

2332
02:18:27,670 --> 02:18:31,930
I think that those stories existed before
of the guy who got a concussion and

2333
02:18:31,931 --> 02:18:35,290
the coach put them back in there and
then he got paralyzed moments later,

2334
02:18:35,560 --> 02:18:38,170
but they never get broadcast
because it wasn't the Internet.

2335
02:18:38,380 --> 02:18:41,680
So those stories were trapped in
Toledo, Ohio and some, you know,

2336
02:18:41,740 --> 02:18:44,680
some parents would tell their
friends and it would be a tragedy,

2337
02:18:44,681 --> 02:18:47,470
but it would never make it
across the globe right now.

2338
02:18:47,471 --> 02:18:50,230
Those stories become huge
international stories.

2339
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:55,110
You also see your childhood heroes
talking about how they don't remember it.

2340
02:18:55,111 --> 02:18:59,560
And Tony Dorsette did that interview and
talked about how he just forgets where

2341
02:18:59,561 --> 02:19:01,300
he is,
what he's doing.

2342
02:19:01,550 --> 02:19:05,050
Dicta Mike Ditka Hall of fame
coach Hall of fame player was like,

2343
02:19:05,051 --> 02:19:08,740
if I knew the repercussions is going
to have on my players and myself,

2344
02:19:08,890 --> 02:19:12,250
I would never play football. I would
never coach any of it. And they go,

2345
02:19:12,251 --> 02:19:14,740
would you let your sons or your
grandkids play football? He goes, nope,

2346
02:19:14,830 --> 02:19:18,970
that's not right. That's Mike
motherfucking Mr Football Dick.

2347
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:22,120
That's so cranes and the trail and talked
about the fact that his son wants to

2348
02:19:22,121 --> 02:19:23,350
play football. And he said, well,

2349
02:19:23,351 --> 02:19:26,590
that's not going to happen until
you can basically you're in what,

2350
02:19:26,591 --> 02:19:29,740
sophomore or junior in high school until
your head start to develop and maybe

2351
02:19:29,750 --> 02:19:33,500
college. Well then you're not
playing right. It's stupid.

2352
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:35,000
But that's what makes it that material.

2353
02:19:35,001 --> 02:19:36,680
And it played what for
seven years it was like,

2354
02:19:36,710 --> 02:19:38,750
I don't want my son playing football
right now. Isn't that amazing?

2355
02:19:38,751 --> 02:19:42,800
Like he's fighting and MMA in
the UFC and he's like, Dad,

2356
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:44,810
that's not as dangerous.
That football things.

2357
02:19:44,811 --> 02:19:47,660
What you really should be worried
about. I disagree really. I mean,

2358
02:19:47,661 --> 02:19:52,260
I played in both. Yeah. I think my
breath bad. Right? Yeah. Neither one.

2359
02:19:52,850 --> 02:19:55,940
Neither one's good for your
health. What's, what's worse
do you think? Both will.

2360
02:19:55,941 --> 02:20:00,140
Okay, so let's, let's just say for
example, so what, this, uh, 2016,

2361
02:20:00,141 --> 02:20:04,340
it'd be my eighth year in the UFC, right?
Eight years in the NFL. I'm set for life.

2362
02:20:04,400 --> 02:20:08,480
I get a stipend every month. Every
time at playing on 401k. I'm good man.

2363
02:20:09,050 --> 02:20:12,320
I don't have to go fucking
figure something else out
to do. I can live off that.

2364
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:17,120
I'll be all right. I'd full benefits.
UFC, I take some head trauma,

2365
02:20:17,150 --> 02:20:20,940
which I'm going to get if I'm in
for eight years and I retired, uh,

2366
02:20:21,200 --> 02:20:25,640
January 2nd after eight years.
There's no stipend, there's no 401k.

2367
02:20:25,820 --> 02:20:29,230
I have no options. I better figure some
shit out. These thing that fell. I,

2368
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:30,620
I'm still gonna get head trauma,

2369
02:20:30,710 --> 02:20:34,220
but at least I at least I'm going to
get compensated for it down the road.

2370
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:37,670
And it's not [inaudible] fault
because u of c right now,

2371
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:39,500
you know we're getting there,
but we're in leather helmets.

2372
02:20:39,501 --> 02:20:42,080
If his NFL NFL said it's
been around a long time,

2373
02:20:42,200 --> 02:20:46,130
it's a smooth operating machine.
There's a player's union. So I get that.

2374
02:20:46,490 --> 02:20:49,670
But if I had to pick least least,
if I'm with severe head trauma,

2375
02:20:49,671 --> 02:20:53,000
at least I don't have to when I retire,
at least take something back.

2376
02:20:53,001 --> 02:20:54,020
What does that make sense?
Yeah.

2377
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:57,200
What do you think what but what the
from the actual doing of the sport,

2378
02:20:57,530 --> 02:20:59,270
and I know it probably
depends on the position,

2379
02:20:59,630 --> 02:21:02,360
but the say a free safety
or someone does that,

2380
02:21:02,361 --> 02:21:05,960
does a free safety take more head trauma
than somebody who is an active fighter

2381
02:21:05,961 --> 02:21:08,630
in the UFC? I don't think so. No.

2382
02:21:08,870 --> 02:21:12,860
I don't think she uses because they the
protection of the helmet on and then if

2383
02:21:12,861 --> 02:21:14,370
you're talking,
if you're a heavyweight,

2384
02:21:14,371 --> 02:21:18,290
you swine with other 260 plus pound
professional athletes and when you're

2385
02:21:18,291 --> 02:21:19,890
sparring,
especially now we have more,

2386
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:23,270
we have more knowledge and guys aren't
sparring and much taking as much,

2387
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:25,280
you know, hits. But I had a day,

2388
02:21:25,310 --> 02:21:27,830
I mean you get hit with a
jab from the UFC heavyweight,

2389
02:21:27,831 --> 02:21:31,280
it's gonna fuck your brain up man. And
you're going to get hit. It's what?

2390
02:21:31,340 --> 02:21:34,940
It's what you signed up for him? Yeah.
There's really no way around it. No.

2391
02:21:34,941 --> 02:21:37,850
It's part, it's part of the game. Talking
to Tony Jeffries, I mean when he was,

2392
02:21:37,851 --> 02:21:41,930
he was like calculating in the
how many fights, how many head,

2393
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:45,770
how many hits he took to the head.
He didn't the average 55,000.

2394
02:21:45,771 --> 02:21:50,330
He said if he got hit, uh, six times
around in the head, which is low,

2395
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:51,890
if you got to hit six times.

2396
02:21:52,040 --> 02:21:55,940
And he asked how many rounds he did an
amateur fights and pro fights came out to

2397
02:21:55,941 --> 02:21:56,321
white light.

2398
02:21:56,321 --> 02:21:58,850
You five thousand fifty five thousand
hits to the head and then I did,

2399
02:21:58,910 --> 02:22:02,510
I kind of did it on my calculator and he
was right. I was like, God damn. Well,

2400
02:22:02,511 --> 02:22:03,860
think about George Saint Pierre.

2401
02:22:03,890 --> 02:22:07,480
We know he got hit 800 plus
times inside the Oxford.

2402
02:22:07,481 --> 02:22:11,120
Crazy by world class fighters.
How many gloves on? Yeah.

2403
02:22:11,121 --> 02:22:14,260
How many times did you get hit in the
head of the gym? You know how many,

2404
02:22:14,330 --> 02:22:17,300
how many different rounds did he spar?
And he goes,

2405
02:22:17,301 --> 02:22:21,110
hard man has to those hard. He does, Huh?

2406
02:22:21,230 --> 02:22:23,980
And against the very best in the world.
Once they come out,

2407
02:22:23,981 --> 02:22:26,250
if they come up with a way
to regenerate brain cells,

2408
02:22:26,410 --> 02:22:28,080
they come up with a way to fix.

2409
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:31,320
Like if they come up with some sort
of stem cell injection when they can

2410
02:22:31,321 --> 02:22:34,470
regenerate your tissue, oh then
we're good and we're good. Fuck yeah.

2411
02:22:34,580 --> 02:22:37,650
Until that had the best sport in the
world. Yeah. Then it's like, man,

2412
02:22:37,660 --> 02:22:40,860
why worry about it? Yeah. You know,
maybe they give you some shit.

2413
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:42,510
It makes you way smarter
than everybody else.

2414
02:22:42,511 --> 02:22:45,630
Once you get brain damage like that movie.

2415
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:47,790
What's that movie trying to
reverse engineer the brain.

2416
02:22:47,791 --> 02:22:49,810
That's the brain project
in both China and,

2417
02:22:49,860 --> 02:22:51,540
and they say they're not
even close to the brain.

2418
02:22:51,550 --> 02:22:54,210
So complicated that every everything else,
they're good brain.

2419
02:22:54,211 --> 02:22:58,830
They can't figure it difficult. It's
a 10 year project and then nuts. Yeah,

2420
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:00,533
they just,

2421
02:23:00,660 --> 02:23:04,830
I think they're coming really close to
reverse engineering the red blood cell of

2422
02:23:04,831 --> 02:23:08,280
a dog, which means that then they'll
be able to do it with a human,

2423
02:23:08,310 --> 02:23:13,200
which really means they'll be able
to replicate it with a tiny machine.

2424
02:23:13,590 --> 02:23:15,000
Well,
that's what Kurzweil was saying.

2425
02:23:15,001 --> 02:23:17,910
Kurzweil was saying they're going to
come up with artificial blood cells that

2426
02:23:17,911 --> 02:23:18,744
are so efficient.

2427
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:22,320
You'll be able to take one deep breath
and go to the bottom of a pool for an

2428
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:26,550
hour. Yup. Yup. How about that?
How about that and sprint,

2429
02:23:26,551 --> 02:23:27,870
you'll be able to sprint on a breath.

2430
02:23:27,890 --> 02:23:30,600
I can just run two sports
will never be the same.

2431
02:23:30,601 --> 02:23:32,430
It won't be an ever be the
same. It'd be fun, man.

2432
02:23:32,431 --> 02:23:35,610
Thousand Years from now till strength
won't be, it won't be good. No,

2433
02:23:35,611 --> 02:23:40,080
it's going to be so different. It'll be,
it'll be the technology in your body.

2434
02:23:40,081 --> 02:23:41,460
What can you afford? You know, it's cool.

2435
02:23:41,480 --> 02:23:43,770
It will not cool as people are
going to be like, you know what?

2436
02:23:43,771 --> 02:23:48,060
I want my kid to play like Lebron
James and looked like Brad Pitt. Well,

2437
02:23:48,061 --> 02:23:50,070
but that raises that race is not good

2438
02:23:52,530 --> 02:23:56,100
playing level. Like you want people
to be different man raises what?

2439
02:23:56,101 --> 02:23:58,140
Like then if say you could do that,

2440
02:23:58,141 --> 02:24:00,540
say you can engineer and like
the perfect person, right?

2441
02:24:00,990 --> 02:24:02,610
Then it would then it would be,

2442
02:24:02,611 --> 02:24:06,090
it would raise really weird questions
about what a human being is because so

2443
02:24:06,091 --> 02:24:08,090
much of what we define a human being,
you know,

2444
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:12,150
based on what their will and their
ability to figure out how to make someone

2445
02:24:12,151 --> 02:24:16,920
smart or make someone have
a good personality makes
someone have a funny sense

2446
02:24:16,921 --> 02:24:19,740
of humor. The sense of
humor, especially unique.

2447
02:24:19,770 --> 02:24:21,300
You can't really engineer
that with a computer.

2448
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:24,930
How you put it all together and you may
even have a guy look like Brad Pitt all

2449
02:24:24,931 --> 02:24:28,710
you want. If somebody like you comes
along and goofs on him and he falls apart.

2450
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:32,880
Thank Gosh, that's huge. Like look at you.

2451
02:24:32,881 --> 02:24:36,390
You're not genetically engineered Aria,
what would you have done without that?

2452
02:24:36,391 --> 02:24:40,500
Probably Starve. You know, they'll
get you your fucking science process.

2453
02:24:40,501 --> 02:24:41,580
You're going to walk away with a girl.

2454
02:24:41,610 --> 02:24:45,060
That's what we were talking about that
like with an athlete where were like,

2455
02:24:45,090 --> 02:24:47,870
there is in the human element,
there's the unmeasurable,

2456
02:24:48,300 --> 02:24:51,020
there's something called Sante
humor personality, things like,

2457
02:24:51,090 --> 02:24:52,650
so we were talking about
athletes like you can,

2458
02:24:52,680 --> 02:24:55,230
you can mention the best athlete I can
run the fastest, jumped the highest,

2459
02:24:55,231 --> 02:24:56,370
you know,
all that stuff.

2460
02:24:56,670 --> 02:25:00,060
Yet somehow they don't win games the way
somebody who does all that stuff in an

2461
02:25:00,061 --> 02:25:01,590
average way it does or not as well.

2462
02:25:01,680 --> 02:25:04,990
So Wayne Gretzky didn't have the fastest
slap shot and even close with in the

2463
02:25:04,991 --> 02:25:07,230
fastest skater.
Somehow he could put it all together.

2464
02:25:07,440 --> 02:25:11,370
And the question becomes how much of a
factor is that measure in when you talk

2465
02:25:11,371 --> 02:25:13,740
about how good an athlete,
somebody who does Larry Bird,

2466
02:25:14,010 --> 02:25:18,090
Larry Bird was never a great athlete,
but his fucking accuracy.

2467
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:19,320
And those three pointers,

2468
02:25:19,530 --> 02:25:24,140
his competitive edge had edge demeanor
and confidence and disability.

2469
02:25:24,180 --> 02:25:27,850
Getting into the other player's head.
The biggest trash talker. Yeah. I mean,

2470
02:25:27,880 --> 02:25:30,610
you know, you're looking at a guy
that's like a pasty white dude.

2471
02:25:30,611 --> 02:25:35,410
It didn't look anything like Brian
James. So awesome. So dope that,

2472
02:25:35,411 --> 02:25:36,021
but that is that,

2473
02:25:36,021 --> 02:25:41,021
that weird human x factor that thank God
exists because technology may be moving

2474
02:25:41,081 --> 02:25:43,660
forward, but it, Tony, you're a
football fan when you watch it.

2475
02:25:43,990 --> 02:25:46,960
Do you care that there's brain
trauma going on? Oh, of course. Yeah.

2476
02:25:46,961 --> 02:25:50,950
It's fucking crazy. But you still watch
it every Sunday. Yeah. And fighting you.

2477
02:25:50,951 --> 02:25:54,940
What? Like you just what do you, so you
realize [inaudible] got brain damage.

2478
02:25:54,941 --> 02:25:56,960
Correct. Don't give a fuck. I got to,

2479
02:25:56,980 --> 02:26:00,370
I got a couple of bad concussions
back in high school. Wrestling days.

2480
02:26:00,430 --> 02:26:03,730
Got Stuck in a head, scissors and
a guy slammed my head, you know,

2481
02:26:03,731 --> 02:26:08,050
he pops back and I was out. I woke
up with Puke all over me on the mat.

2482
02:26:08,920 --> 02:26:13,420
That helmet that you were wearing, that
cryo helmet, those guys contacted me.

2483
02:26:13,421 --> 02:26:16,630
You liked that? I liked the, I like
what they're doing for, you know,

2484
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:20,530
just cool me is a, a really cool
non profit organization, um,

2485
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:24,310
that basically tries to get the word out
there that when you have head trauma,

2486
02:26:24,580 --> 02:26:28,990
uh, he was a veteran. Uh, I think Daniel
Damn, Daniel Ortega, Daniel or teas, uh,

2487
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:31,330
I'm sorry, I can't, Daniel wins.
I was, I think his name is,

2488
02:26:31,331 --> 02:26:34,420
and he runs it and he was at, he
wasn't skinny, he was Mexican.

2489
02:26:34,870 --> 02:26:39,700
He was asking me this or take solid
solid Daniel Gonzalez. The last was,

2490
02:26:41,460 --> 02:26:45,300
sorry Daniel for not getting your new ido.
But Daniel was in the,

2491
02:26:45,301 --> 02:26:46,990
in the military and I
believe he's a medic.

2492
02:26:47,050 --> 02:26:50,860
And one of the things that they found is
that when you have head trauma and you

2493
02:26:50,861 --> 02:26:54,850
cool somebody immediately you cool their
head right away. It can, it can be very,

2494
02:26:54,851 --> 02:26:58,720
very beneficial to stopping
longterm, um, uh, trauma.

2495
02:26:58,721 --> 02:27:03,250
And this guy who, the Cryo
Hammad Guy Douglas, uh, he,

2496
02:27:03,251 --> 02:27:06,760
his brother's a boxer. He was a boxer
and his brother actually has a gym.

2497
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:10,630
And so he created this basically this
cryo Hammad where you just put in the

2498
02:27:10,631 --> 02:27:15,250
freezer and you just put it on your
head after contact and he sent it to you

2499
02:27:15,251 --> 02:27:17,470
because you're worried about head trauma.
He told me though,

2500
02:27:17,471 --> 02:27:20,380
because he listens to the podcast,
he goes, stop boxing. He goes,

2501
02:27:20,381 --> 02:27:24,390
what are you doing? He goes, stop boxing
and don't box. There's no reason to,

2502
02:27:24,550 --> 02:27:26,770
and if you insist on it,
fucking cool your head.

2503
02:27:26,771 --> 02:27:29,620
But you're getting your bell
rung when your box. No, no.

2504
02:27:29,800 --> 02:27:33,060
I mean he'll catch me,
but it's not. I'm fine.

2505
02:27:33,130 --> 02:27:36,370
Then you go home and you put on
the cryo helmet. No, I don't do it.

2506
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:39,670
I just got it.
I will now will.

2507
02:27:39,710 --> 02:27:43,150
The guy was smart sent to you and Joel
Road Elementary. He's a great guy.

2508
02:27:43,230 --> 02:27:44,900
It's very smart fighter.

2509
02:27:45,080 --> 02:27:48,250
But I'm doing it because I think
I just call me as a nonprofit.

2510
02:27:48,310 --> 02:27:51,010
I use barn with Wayne Macola.
Yeah.

2511
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:54,940
And Wayne McCullough was just like
popping you going with when Mikala

2512
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:56,410
[inaudible] Mikala moves around with me.

2513
02:27:56,430 --> 02:27:59,830
I try to his horse with other guys though.
I seen him as part of the you guys.

2514
02:27:59,831 --> 02:28:02,850
I'm like, what are you doing? But they're
not. What does it look like when, Gosh,

2515
02:28:03,850 --> 02:28:07,150
you haven't seen me in a long time. Well,
no, I was going to help you up. Brian.

2516
02:28:07,270 --> 02:28:10,660
Brian's foot works better and all of his
foot works better than all these guys.

2517
02:28:10,661 --> 02:28:14,590
I mean, he's not leaking
this fucking guy. Yeah, look,

2518
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:17,920
so when you take off your cryo helmet,

2519
02:28:17,921 --> 02:28:21,870
is there a guy with a blow dryer and
a holster there to fix her hair? Yes.

2520
02:28:22,210 --> 02:28:26,490
Is, but Brian is getting hit
in the head when he's sparring.

2521
02:28:27,550 --> 02:28:31,190
Not Hard. Still hits to the head.
He's still trauma to the head. I know.

2522
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:35,720
I like doing it though. I
liked box. I don't get it.
Why don't you just do Jujitsu?

2523
02:28:35,930 --> 02:28:39,200
That's why I fucking to start doing.
Why don't you do it? I'm going to, well,

2524
02:28:39,201 --> 02:28:43,760
why don't you, I'm trying to
box. I have time. I'll do it.

2525
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:47,340
I played tennis. But you
were a good grappler when you
were a good grappler. Yeah,

2526
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:50,060
I know. I missed the show. I remember
when we first started training,

2527
02:28:50,061 --> 02:28:52,740
when I first brought you in to Carlson
Gracie's, you will go hard, man.

2528
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:53,603
You'd go after those.

2529
02:28:53,940 --> 02:28:57,260
You're going to roll this Saturday with
Tarik and Jake shields. I can't wait.

2530
02:28:57,830 --> 02:29:00,900
How will I do against Jake? Be you going
to get mauled? Come on dude. Oh Man.

2531
02:29:00,970 --> 02:29:03,950
You seen the way I hark and Jake shields.
Gene do great Brian.

2532
02:29:03,951 --> 02:29:06,770
She's just saying thank you and last
time you were old. It doesn't matter bro,

2533
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:10,070
because what happens is I square up.
What are you going to do? Take me down.

2534
02:29:10,071 --> 02:29:13,280
Hold on a second. You guys can, uh, in
San Francisco. Is that what's going on?

2535
02:29:13,340 --> 02:29:16,430
You're going to train up there?
Fuck. Are you doing up there?

2536
02:29:16,431 --> 02:29:19,430
What are you guys done to get to the
punchline and then he's coming over and

2537
02:29:19,431 --> 02:29:22,340
we're going to have two
meetings with sponsors,

2538
02:29:22,600 --> 02:29:24,620
one for personal and one for the podcast,

2539
02:29:24,650 --> 02:29:27,790
and then we're going to have fun like row
with Jake Shields. I can't wait. Yeah,

2540
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:30,590
that'd be fun for about three seconds.
I mean, I have no business piece.

2541
02:29:30,610 --> 02:29:31,443
It's squashed.

2542
02:29:31,570 --> 02:29:35,840
No pain with Jake first week of May
cause he's getting ready to fight.

2543
02:29:36,980 --> 02:29:41,120
So all he's working on his leg locks.
He's a fucking monster. Jake's a beast.

2544
02:29:41,121 --> 02:29:45,530
He's a very good man.
Very much the way to 20 really?

2545
02:29:45,560 --> 02:29:48,890
No one seven.
Exactly.

2546
02:29:48,891 --> 02:29:53,000
Once I got to understand like jobs
inside, my weight's on my feet. He's,

2547
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:56,060
he's made out of lead
cut down to reign him.

2548
02:29:56,140 --> 02:29:58,700
If you cut down to one 40 I'll wrestle.

2549
02:29:58,701 --> 02:30:03,701
You wrestle off 40 I couldn't suck that
kind of weight cut loose 30 pounds.

2550
02:30:06,230 --> 02:30:09,950
I think you could do it, dude. I have
to do it. I think you'd do it, man.

2551
02:30:10,010 --> 02:30:14,220
I'd have thought. Yeah. What are
you scared? One 45 can I suck?

2552
02:30:14,430 --> 02:30:18,710
I have to do a cooking show yesterday
talking about my diet and how strict it

2553
02:30:18,711 --> 02:30:19,940

2554
02:30:19,941 --> 02:30:22,310
Just me bullshit him the whole
time they're going to hear this.

2555

so I wear like this tight black shirt.

2558
02:30:34,430 --> 02:30:38,230
I looked like fucking John Claude van
Damme like black shirt, but giants.

2559
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:40,190
He is so enormous.
We were,

2560
02:30:40,191 --> 02:30:43,460
he hadn't eaten and we would done a
podcast and he's like, I'm starving.

2561
02:30:43,461 --> 02:30:45,770
I'm starving. And I can see the
friends. He'd look in his eyes.

2562
02:30:45,890 --> 02:30:50,150
He's got a food issue and horrible food
we'd go to to take away my favorite

2563
02:30:50,151 --> 02:30:54,620
places. He orders, he orders, he
orders a sandwich. That's the cooking.

2564
02:30:54,621 --> 02:30:58,850
Show me bullshit my way through this diet.
Where's this at? Where? That's my house.

2565
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:04,550
Nice. Yeah. And so what does this
show? What does this cooking show? Ah,

2566
02:31:04,690 --> 02:31:08,450
just basically the beak ground. Slim
down because I, I know ray was there. No,

2567
02:31:08,451 --> 02:31:12,410
I said watch out. Like I wish Rachel
Ray was this. Yeah. Hell yeah.

2568
02:31:12,411 --> 02:31:15,500
She loves people and looked like a burly.
You look like a burly cook.

2569
02:31:15,501 --> 02:31:20,150
There you are. Early Cook. If you're
a cooking dude, do you know the car

though? Like Shit, and I was so hungry.

2572
02:31:29,761 --> 02:31:33,650
We went to Juliana's takeaway so much and
he goes like this. He finally, he goes,

2573
02:31:34,390 --> 02:31:37,440
he looks at me, he looks at me
after we ate, and he goes and I go,

2574
02:31:37,441 --> 02:31:40,360
what's up with this? I'm getting
another piece of pizza, and I go, well,

2575
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:43,050
kind of things. I am Brian. I'm
going to do it, and I, all right,

2576
02:31:43,051 --> 02:31:46,080
there's nothing goes great. You're not
going to jump off the 50 foot cliff.

2577
02:31:46,081 --> 02:31:47,250
He goes, I'm doing it. And he goes,

2578
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:50,970
I'd like another piece please like a
little dot two cookies and you're talking

2579
02:31:50,971 --> 02:31:53,820
to a girl and I see her looking
at Mego. Brian, I'm debt. Yes,

2580
02:31:53,930 --> 02:31:57,230
I got your cookies and pizza, man. I'll
tell you what you've never seen before.

2581
02:31:57,231 --> 02:31:58,680
Who you want to see something nuts.

2582
02:31:58,860 --> 02:32:02,920
You need to see Ari Shaffir eat at
Fogo de Chao. I eat a lot of food too,

2583
02:32:03,150 --> 02:32:06,810
but I can't fuck with Ari when he has an
all you can eat buffet at Fogo de Chao

2584
02:32:07,170 --> 02:32:10,680
fogo they have the chip. They flip
it over. I don't know how he does it.

2585
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:13,950
He got EOD. It's all of us.
It's because of his Jewishness.

2586
02:32:14,370 --> 02:32:17,110
He sees the opportunity to fulfill upon.
It's good.

2587
02:32:17,130 --> 02:32:21,420
It's like a berry just cause
it's all you can eat. It's,

2588
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:23,890
I don't know how he does it,
but do you eat because you're,

2589
02:32:23,980 --> 02:32:28,380
I mean your lean dude and I see your post
at night where it's like Moose fucking

2590
02:32:28,381 --> 02:32:30,870
meat so you're not eating a lot of
carbs that doesn't put your weight on.

2591
02:32:30,970 --> 02:32:32,580
Well I don't eat much carbs.

2592
02:32:32,581 --> 02:32:37,380
It's like if I limit my pasta to like
only a couple portions a week and I live

2593
02:32:37,381 --> 02:32:39,900
at home, I'm bread. Yeah, I
don't, I don't believe in it.

2594
02:32:40,140 --> 02:32:43,830
I think pasta is mostly just dough
and gee, it's a fucking golf.

2595
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:48,660
It's like when you eat it, it's
just doughy. Julie, massive fucking,

2596
02:32:48,930 --> 02:32:52,470
it's just so like coming.
And Lou did you just have great genetics?

2597
02:32:52,790 --> 02:32:54,540
Well I have really good genetics for sure,

2598
02:32:54,541 --> 02:32:57,560
but I definitely eat a lot of good food.
I get a lot of vegetables.

2599
02:32:57,930 --> 02:33:01,150
Like what was your breakfast? I haven't
eaten yet. Do you have any at all?

2600
02:33:01,160 --> 02:33:04,920
I hit this bar. Do you do that on
purpose? Like intermittent fast day,

2601
02:33:05,010 --> 02:33:06,120
late at night,
late at night.

2602
02:33:06,121 --> 02:33:09,840
And had five eggs and I had some
steak and I want to go sleep.

2603
02:33:09,870 --> 02:33:14,250
I can't eat protein at night. I
literally, I'm asleep if I did that.

2604
02:33:14,251 --> 02:33:16,380
If I eat eggs and steak or beef,

2605
02:33:16,381 --> 02:33:20,730
I would wake up two hours later in a
DNA hot sweat and I have to throw the

2606
02:33:20,731 --> 02:33:24,570
covers off and I would be up awake for
another three hours. I can't do it.

2607
02:33:24,630 --> 02:33:28,650
Guess what? I can sleep on carbs. Big Bowl
carbs. No problem. Why? Why is that? What?

2608
02:33:28,651 --> 02:33:31,330
It depends on your metabolic type
apparently from what I've read like,

2609
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:33,300
and I'll give you a questionnaire.
Would you,

2610
02:33:33,301 --> 02:33:36,690
can you eat carbs at night and you sleep
well right through the night if you eat

2611
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:40,060
protein, if I eat any
protein, I'm fucked. See I,

2612
02:33:40,070 --> 02:33:43,320
if I eat carbs like I
feel like weighed down.

2613
02:33:44,270 --> 02:33:47,940
Like if I eat a bowl of pasta,
I love Spaghetti man, like
Spaghetti and meatballs.

2614
02:33:47,941 --> 02:33:51,330
I'm in heaven. I love it. How about,
how about right after it's over,

2615
02:33:51,630 --> 02:33:56,130
it's just went after. It's over.
I'm just like, oh, I just hate glue.

2616
02:33:56,280 --> 02:33:56,910
You know what the,

2617
02:33:56,910 --> 02:34:00,450
you know what the problem I'm having
sticking to a strict diet is when you have

2618
02:34:00,451 --> 02:34:03,250
a goal, like when you know you have
a motherfucker look Andrea loss,

2619
02:34:03,251 --> 02:34:04,380
you're going to fight a cro cop.

2620
02:34:04,470 --> 02:34:09,470
It's easy to be strict as fuck right now
because you're afraid basically I have

2621
02:34:09,900 --> 02:34:14,640
a goal. You have a goal in mind. Like
right now, you know there's, there's no,

2622
02:34:14,670 --> 02:34:17,160
like I said, I'm only taking a
fight if it's a super fight. I told,

2623
02:34:17,300 --> 02:34:18,133
I told them that

2624
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:20,430
so, but there's nothing set right. Right.

2625
02:34:20,480 --> 02:34:24,430
Right now it's like tonight I'm going
out to this dinner. It's like all right,

2626
02:34:24,431 --> 02:34:28,510
well usually I'd go out and I'd eat super
strict but in my head like when I get

2627
02:34:28,511 --> 02:34:32,360
the minion I'm like for what? Why would
I eat superstar? Just enjoy food man. I,

2628
02:34:32,390 --> 02:34:36,470
and then I'm worried about getting fat
and cause I have body dysmorphia. Yeah,

2629
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:41,290
the best boss. Like girls, look at your
body. What about when we saw Mika Kelly,

2630
02:34:41,410 --> 02:34:45,910
how embarrassed was that? And I like sat,
I'm just kidding me. Kelly is, it is,

2631
02:34:45,911 --> 02:34:48,940
it is a, an actress and I think
she was on the hills or something.

2632
02:34:48,941 --> 02:34:52,900
She dated Derek Jeter. I, she got the
same place. She's, you hide your function.

2633
02:34:53,720 --> 02:34:56,740
She's looking, they're looking at him that
the three girls, I'm looking at Brent,

2634
02:34:56,741 --> 02:34:59,200
I'm going to turn Brennan and
Brennan goes like this, Brendan,

2635
02:34:59,201 --> 02:35:02,890
because we're eating how we're just
down the way. And he goes, um, I,

2636
02:35:02,891 --> 02:35:05,560
I'll take a box please.
I'm going to take this to go.

2637
02:35:05,860 --> 02:35:08,110
And I got hot and he puts it in
a box and I said, I was like,

2638
02:35:08,111 --> 02:35:11,020
that's weird and I'm eating away.
As soon as they leave, he goes,

2639
02:35:11,110 --> 02:35:13,280
I'll be honest with you. I didn't
want her to think I was a fat ass.

2640
02:35:13,290 --> 02:35:17,340
And he opens it up to stretch out
even remotely. Fallon, I don't know.

2641
02:35:17,360 --> 02:35:19,300
You know what I was telling,
Brian isn't telling me. He goes,

2642
02:35:19,301 --> 02:35:21,010
why are you like that?
Cause I'm not like,

2643
02:35:21,011 --> 02:35:24,820
like I don't look like Alistair Overeem
and when I was in high school or

2644
02:35:24,821 --> 02:35:29,080
girlfriends said something
to me before, like, oh, huge
competition. She's like, God,

2645
02:35:29,081 --> 02:35:29,680
be nicer.

2646
02:35:29,680 --> 02:35:34,360
If you had a little flatter stomach and
since then like my high school stupid by

2647
02:35:34,390 --> 02:35:36,350
the right time to get over
that, huh? Well, I don't

2648
02:35:39,850 --> 02:35:44,200
get bullied.
So time to get over that.

2649
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:49,930
Get over that right now. It was
only 20 years ago. It was some time.

2650
02:35:50,480 --> 02:35:53,390
Some time. Man. Let's see here.

2651
02:35:53,410 --> 02:35:55,840
Would Vinny shoreman said the
hypnotist that I had in the podcast,

2652
02:35:55,841 --> 02:35:59,920
he was talking about this guy who was six
years old who was standing on a top of

2653
02:35:59,921 --> 02:36:02,690
a hill and he was looking down. He
was like, well, why don't you go down?

2654
02:36:02,691 --> 02:36:05,140
He goes down and those guys
are down there. They used
to bully me in high school.

2655
02:36:05,730 --> 02:36:08,620
He's 60 and the guys who used to
bully him in high school, we don't.

2656
02:36:08,630 --> 02:36:12,140
He was waiting for them to leave
before he went down. That said, whoa.

2657
02:36:12,190 --> 02:36:13,630
Like he was looking,
don't happen to me.

2658
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:17,380
I got bullied for a full year
and it turned me into a fucking,

2659
02:36:17,410 --> 02:36:20,320
if somebody tried to blow me, I'll show
up at your fucking house and kill you.

2660
02:36:20,350 --> 02:36:23,740
That's what happens. I get so angry. I'm
not buying that. When he talks about,

2661
02:36:24,060 --> 02:36:28,510
I hate when you fucking
bullying bullying me right now.

2662
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:34,480
You've talked to too many guys that
let you say shit like that and then it

2663
02:36:34,481 --> 02:36:38,870
becomes like vernacular comes like
a part of the way [inaudible].

2664
02:36:39,460 --> 02:36:43,660
I know when I first met you,
all those people used to hang around with.

2665
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:47,110
Those are all toxic and they've ruined
the way you're allowed to communicate

2666
02:36:47,111 --> 02:36:49,240
with people because they said stupid shit.

2667
02:36:49,241 --> 02:36:52,000
And then you said if somebody who was
looks for any bro, look at how am I,

2668
02:36:52,060 --> 02:36:56,260
what do you have to say to me?
Well what's the scary movie with the law?

2669
02:36:58,360 --> 02:37:00,850
We have to hold on just
a scary movie with them.

2670
02:37:00,851 --> 02:37:04,390
And it was the most annoying thing
to me. What? He goes, fuck this guy.

2671
02:37:04,391 --> 02:37:08,440
I can wish a demon would grab me, man.
You know what I would do? And I'm like,

2672
02:37:08,470 --> 02:37:10,900
I get mad. Why are you talking to
me? He's like, not that you get mad.

2673
02:37:10,900 --> 02:37:14,020
It's so you hang around with people for
a long time you hung around with people

2674
02:37:14,021 --> 02:37:18,950
that allowed you to talk like that.
No, without mocking [inaudible] Bros,

2675
02:37:19,080 --> 02:37:23,290
Bros pros.
Let's not fuck some.

2676
02:37:23,630 --> 02:37:26,150
You bully me Bro. I don't give
a shit about your USC bullshit.

2677
02:37:26,270 --> 02:37:27,320
I will fucking come right at you.

2678
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:30,470
I could pin it on the ground right now
and put me into the trial. You could try.

2679
02:37:30,890 --> 02:37:32,870
You could try and guess what?
She gets the Nice,

2680
02:37:32,871 --> 02:37:37,710
that's why I would fucking come right
to your house. You'd be dead Joe.

2681
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:41,990
Yup. He needs friends like us cause he
gets it around saying guys who don't know,

2682
02:37:41,991 --> 02:37:45,380
I'm putting it away to muck
around with all lot of idiots.

2683
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:49,700
There's a lot of people that he hangs
around with full of shit that they're,

2684
02:37:49,710 --> 02:37:54,560
they're, they're dumb. I feel sick.

2685
02:37:55,340 --> 02:37:59,030
I feel sick. You do. You hang out with
a lot of people that are such bullshit.

2686
02:37:59,031 --> 02:38:03,560
Artists know and you don't. You
know, you know who I'm talking about.

2687
02:38:03,570 --> 02:38:06,010
You have friends that are bullshit
artists and you don't even realize that.

2688
02:38:07,430 --> 02:38:08,263
You know.

2689
02:38:08,750 --> 02:38:12,070
You know why I know you do and you've
had them from the moment I met you and

2690
02:38:12,120 --> 02:38:16,130
they lie each other. I met Brian and 94
he's surrounded by idiots. I was like,

2691
02:38:16,131 --> 02:38:18,920
what's going on here? With
these fucking people. Come on.

2692
02:38:18,921 --> 02:38:21,500
They try to drag you away.
Slowly and surely guys,

2693
02:38:21,590 --> 02:38:26,090
I pushed those people off cliffs. Slowly
but surely I separating him from most,

2694
02:38:26,100 --> 02:38:27,950
they're like, hey, your friend
doesn't like me. I was like, well,

2695
02:38:27,980 --> 02:38:29,180
just a little hard to,
he's hard.

2696
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:32,810
He can push a marrying one of them at
a certain point in time. I was like,

2697
02:38:32,811 --> 02:38:36,410
what the fuck are you talking about?
Everybody was, everybody else was like,

2698
02:38:36,580 --> 02:38:40,550
it's good luck. Good luck brother. No,
it's going to work out. It's gonna work.

2699
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:44,120
I'm like, what the fuck are you
talking about you out of your mind?

2700
02:38:44,750 --> 02:38:47,550
You out of your mind. It's just me and
patty were the only one that was telling.

2701
02:38:47,950 --> 02:38:51,700
I remember Gotti here. You're not
married. You did save me dude.

2702
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:56,090
All meet people or I'll meet some people
with celebrities or not and for some

2703
02:38:56,091 --> 02:38:58,590
reason I was like, God, real
good. Fucking hate this purse.

2704
02:38:59,060 --> 02:39:03,320
That's the way I think of things like
job they would thing is that Joe will

2705
02:39:03,321 --> 02:39:07,280
actually like kind of let it be known
or at least just be kind of right away.

2706
02:39:07,310 --> 02:39:10,790
Just ignore them really hard and
I never do that. Well you can't.

2707
02:39:10,850 --> 02:39:12,470
You can't ruin my life.

2708
02:39:16,290 --> 02:39:18,980
Those people are that they, it's
almost like this. People have energy.

2709
02:39:18,981 --> 02:39:21,260
He's afraid it's going to stick to them.
They do stick to you.

2710
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:24,470
They become a part of your life and then
you have to deal with their bullshit.

2711
02:39:24,650 --> 02:39:25,060
You have to do,

2712
02:39:25,060 --> 02:39:28,160
you have to like pretend that what
they're saying is not retarded.

2713
02:39:28,161 --> 02:39:28,881
And when you do that,

2714
02:39:28,881 --> 02:39:32,000
you compromise the way you think
and behave and communicate with you.

2715
02:39:32,010 --> 02:39:34,760
Nip It in the butt right away. Even
on your show, you nip it on. But,

2716
02:39:34,850 --> 02:39:36,980
but even like before we
can do a show in here,

2717
02:39:36,981 --> 02:39:41,300
this guy had this bullshit
machine and you're like, Bro,
this is fucking terrible.

2718
02:39:41,301 --> 02:39:43,550
That armbar thing.
Bone in my body.

2719
02:39:43,551 --> 02:39:48,200
I tried to help people's feelings since
meeting you. I'm getting better at it.

2720
02:39:48,201 --> 02:39:51,770
You can't do that because it's not bad
for them. I'm not saying you're a loser,

2721
02:39:51,771 --> 02:39:54,050
you're a bad person. I'm
saying this, this, the idea,

2722
02:39:54,060 --> 02:39:57,410
one plus one doesn't equal six. You know
it's funny, but saying it equals six.

2723
02:39:57,411 --> 02:39:59,060
I'm like, this is crazy. This is not,

2724
02:39:59,090 --> 02:40:01,610
there are two people I've known in
my life who had really bad breath.

2725
02:40:01,611 --> 02:40:05,740
One was a girl, the guy the worst route,
and nobody wants to tell the same guy,

2726
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:09,740
the same guy. We know that's
another guy. You have three,

2727
02:40:09,940 --> 02:40:13,010
but I can't live your whole life and
have bad breath. No one says a word.

2728
02:40:13,020 --> 02:40:14,160
Want to sit there.
And I kept saying,

2729
02:40:14,160 --> 02:40:15,540
how do I tell this person?

2730
02:40:15,541 --> 02:40:18,960
And I never could because I felt
like I wasn't quite close enough.

2731
02:40:18,961 --> 02:40:21,480
But it was always, and so they've
been walking around with bad breath.

2732
02:40:21,790 --> 02:40:24,660
We have a mutual friend and I've
left it up to count. I go, bro,

2733
02:40:24,750 --> 02:40:27,790
tell him his breath smells
like pure shit broke.

2734
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:30,870
It would ricochet off the car
window. And I'm like, who farted?

2735
02:40:31,670 --> 02:40:35,930
Who's bars in my car? Was his breath
like an open call Brian? I'm like, Bro,

2736
02:40:36,390 --> 02:40:38,240
please tell him no.

2737
02:40:40,380 --> 02:40:43,770
So we just chilled for a nice three
hour car ride in this pure shit.

2738
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:48,020
Eat Shit. I just saw him the other day
too. The problem is, I don't know how,

2739
02:40:48,090 --> 02:40:51,870
what do you like? Oh yeah, bad breath. And
what do you say to them? Go to a doctor.

2740
02:40:51,871 --> 02:40:56,220
What's a doctor's wife would tell him?
I know your nose is broken.

2741
02:40:56,220 --> 02:40:59,130
Maybe she had a head injury. I think when
you have head injuries you're fucking,

2742
02:40:59,131 --> 02:41:01,750
your nose gets a year. No,
it doesn't work. Oh good.

2743
02:41:01,960 --> 02:41:05,720
Maybe Marcus Davis lost his sense of
smell for a long time. My friend. Yeah,

2744
02:41:05,721 --> 02:41:07,850
my Goddamn head trauma pho.

2745
02:41:07,950 --> 02:41:10,470
That's one of the things
that Rhonda Patrick talked
about when we had her on the

2746
02:41:10,471 --> 02:41:12,470
podcast.
She was talking about what the,

2747
02:41:12,471 --> 02:41:15,660
the mechanism that goes off
in your brain to protect you.

2748
02:41:15,661 --> 02:41:18,390
Like when you start getting really
serious head trauma, they just,

2749
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:22,380
certain switches started just shutting
off. She's a circuit breakers.

2750
02:41:22,381 --> 02:41:25,650
Sense of smell is a big one. Taste
right. And some guys have taste, taste,

2751
02:41:25,980 --> 02:41:29,540
taste and smell and losing your
taste and smell. When you smell,

2752
02:41:29,541 --> 02:41:33,330
a lot of times you lose your taste
as well. Yeah, yeah. I connected.

2753
02:41:34,780 --> 02:41:38,490
Yeah. I mean you're fine. You're fine.
Right now it's the w, you know the,

2754
02:41:38,491 --> 02:41:42,150
the guys who just continued to get that
fucking head trauma over and over and

2755
02:41:42,151 --> 02:41:44,810
over and over and over and over and over
and over and over and over and over.

2756
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:47,880
No trouble. And then the gate and I like
the knee than what we're talking about.

2757
02:41:48,230 --> 02:41:50,130
Dude. I'm honestly, I'm
going to get spot man.

2758
02:41:50,131 --> 02:41:54,330
Like I was telling Brian this the other
day, like before companions like, dude,

2759
02:41:54,331 --> 02:41:57,390
I can't before fight
companions before the podcast.

2760
02:41:57,450 --> 02:42:00,450
Sometimes I can't sleep at night.
I'm so excited to do it. When, when,

2761
02:42:00,451 --> 02:42:01,980
when our shirts we get released,

2762
02:42:02,250 --> 02:42:05,580
it's the same to me is that when I fight
I'm that excite for them to fucking

2763
02:42:05,581 --> 02:42:08,210
drop. And so that's awesome.
It's awesome man. Thank you.

2764
02:42:08,300 --> 02:42:10,470
So long as you're doing
something you really enjoy,

2765
02:42:10,500 --> 02:42:12,570
that is really the key to life purpose,

2766
02:42:12,640 --> 02:42:14,800
but you want to wake up with a
perfect cause. He shows that we're,

2767
02:42:14,801 --> 02:42:15,780
we've been doing lately,

2768
02:42:15,790 --> 02:42:18,570
you're working on new material and
just like trying to get it together.

2769
02:42:18,600 --> 02:42:21,500
Like it's exciting before while
you're doing it. And Caitlin,

2770
02:42:21,610 --> 02:42:24,450
it's exciting when it, and afterwards
you listening to the recordings,

2771
02:42:24,451 --> 02:42:27,100
trying to figure out how to tweak
the joke and add this to it.

2772
02:42:27,360 --> 02:42:29,940
As long as you're doing something,
building something. Yeah. It's,

2773
02:42:29,950 --> 02:42:31,210
it's building something.
Yeah.

2774
02:42:31,230 --> 02:42:34,380
So I think one of the big problems that
we were talking about like fighters have

2775
02:42:34,410 --> 02:42:38,070
is at once the career's over, there's
no more progress. There's nothing.

2776
02:42:38,071 --> 02:42:40,410
Where do you place your energy?
Yeah. What's happening? Where's your,

2777
02:42:40,411 --> 02:42:41,970
where's your excitement?
You know,

2778
02:42:41,971 --> 02:42:44,800
you mean there's only so
many gyms you can open. Yeah.

2779
02:42:44,801 --> 02:42:47,220
And that's not gonna
fulfill that fucking the,

2780
02:42:48,030 --> 02:42:51,150
the constant pulse you always used.
Didn't really know what I'm saying.

2781
02:42:51,210 --> 02:42:54,630
I don't know what you do, man. The answer.
Believe me, I'd fucking kill everybody.

2782
02:42:54,690 --> 02:42:57,060
And that's why a lot of guys
like the one I'm going to drugs.

2783
02:42:57,061 --> 02:42:59,910
They want to go into something
to try to forget it, man. Yeah.

2784
02:42:59,911 --> 02:43:03,990
Recharge that excitement.
Yeah. Get that juice. Need it.

2785
02:43:04,500 --> 02:43:05,670
Get your shit together,
bitches.

2786
02:43:05,671 --> 02:43:08,370
We're going to wrap this up nice and
tight with a big fat bow fighter and the
