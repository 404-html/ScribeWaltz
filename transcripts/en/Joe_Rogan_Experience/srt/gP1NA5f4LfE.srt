1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,810
Four three,
two,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,570
one.
Hello Peter.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,670
Hello Joe.
What's going on man?

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,520
A whole lot.
You were just telling me something that

5
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,800
is one of the most ridiculous things
I've ever heard.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,750
That you swam from Maui to Lanai.
Right?

7
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,880
And you're the one,
the only humans ever do that.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:25,560
I am told I was the first person to swim
from Maui to when I am back.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,700
The one way is a pretty famous swim race
that's done every year.

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,860
You're the first person to do it.
The round.

11
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:33,570
Go back.
Fuck Dude.

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,910
Why'd you do that?
How long have you got it started when I

13
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:40,590
was a boy.
They told me I couldn't do it.

14
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:46,050
What made you want to do that?
That's a ridiculous proposition.

15
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,000
Um,
so I got into,

16
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,000
I decided in,
it's going to sound silly.

17
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,470
I read a book in January of 2004 about
this woman named Penny Dean,

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,040
who still to this day holds the record
for the fastest crossing of the Catalina

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:01,620
Channel.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,540
So it was for me from Catalina Island to
San Pedro or or a to a not you typically

21
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,541
swimming to point point [inaudible] and
she had done it in like seven hours and

22
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,580
20 minutes and I was like,
that's amazing.

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,060
I far as a crow flies,
it's 21 miles with the currents.

24
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:21,360
It's a little longer.
And I was like,

25
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,800
you know,
I really want to do this.

26
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,080
Um,
but I,

27
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,330
I got to learn how to swim first.
That seems that's three miles an hour

28
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:30,930
swimming.
She is a phenom.

29
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,350
Penny Dean had a stroke rate of 90
strokes per minute,

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,140
which I mean that might not mean
anything to someone who doesn't swim,

31
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:41,400
but like to turn to have a hand hit the
water every,

32
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,840
you know,
third of it.

33
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,200
Two thirds of a second is a remarkable
case.

34
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,150
Yeah.
I can't hold a cadence of that for a

35
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,800
hundred yards.
Wow.

36
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,200
And she did it for 20 miles.
Yeah.

37
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,840
What a beast.
She's out of control.

38
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,980
There's certain people like that,
man,

39
00:01:57,981 --> 00:02:01,680
it freaked me out I think.
I think marathon's swimming might be one

40
00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,770
sport where if you just look at the
numbers,

41
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:08,250
I think women are better than men.
Well there's that woman who swam from

42
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:09,510
Cuba to the United States.
Right?

43
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:10,750
She was the first person ever,
Diana,

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,010
Diane and she didn't she do it like at a
fairly advanced age.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,990
Yeah.
I mean she's of course got an amazing

46
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:18,420
pedigree of swimming and this wasn't her
first Rodeo.

47
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,351
Right,
right,

48
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,050
right.
Why,

49
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,480
why do you think women are better than
men?

50
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:24,780
That's that.
I mean those of us that,

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm not a member of this community
anymore,

52
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:29,040
but when I was,
it was one of our favorite topics of

53
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,170
discussion.
I think a thing,

54
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,710
opportunities or ideas that were put
forth were higher pain tolerance.

55
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,320
Something about being,
you know,

56
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,520
evolving to be able to give birth,
um,

57
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,810
just means they can tolerate pain a lot
higher.

58
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,170
Um,
I think another thing I've heard is

59
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,280
buoyancy.
You know,

60
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,080
women are naturally going to have more
body fat,

61
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,240
which provides insulation.
When you do these swims,

62
00:02:51,241 --> 00:02:54,240
you're not allowed any wetsuits or aids
of any sort.

63
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,570
So shorts,
you're like,

64
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,740
you're in a speedo and single latex cap
and that's it.

65
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,770
And so if you can have a little,
and so I think women's hips because

66
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,160
they're going to have more fat on their
hips,

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,701
they,
they,

68
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,850
it corrects one of the big buoyancy
issues that we have in swimming.

69
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,800
We didn't evolve to swim.
We're horrible at it naturally because

70
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:17,800
we swim like this.
We drag our hips through the water.

71
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,960
And if you think about the importance of
aerodynamics in most of the things that

72
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:25,210
we think about,
whether it be archery or race,

73
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:27,490
car driving or cycling,
you know,

74
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:30,790
in water it's that much more important
because the density of water is,

75
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,890
you know,
thousands of times greater than air.

76
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,430
So swimming is just a hundred percent
about avoiding drag.

77
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,130
Wow.
So that totally makes sense.

78
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,730
Um,
I just have been fascinated forever with

79
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:48,620
people that are capable of pushing their
brain to do things that other people

80
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:50,300
just don't think are possible.
Like a,

81
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,291
you know,
big foot,

82
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:54,320
200 race or like a,
any of those things.

83
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:58,760
But the swim one is particularly crazy
because you can't stop.

84
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,601
Right,
right.

85
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,450
Like,
if you're running an ultra marathon and

86
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,370
you just want to sit down for a couple
minutes and just take a break,

87
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,800
you can do that.
But if you're swimming,

88
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:09,320
there's,
you've got a damn thing you could do.

89
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,540
You could tread water is about as good
as it gets,

90
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,840
but you can't touch the boat or the
Kayak or it's an immediate

91
00:04:14,841 --> 00:04:17,420
disqualification.
Oh God,

92
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,230
that's so crazy.
Mat.

93
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,840
That is such a,
wow.

94
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,160
So you heard about this woman doing and
that's what I read

95
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,170
this book and I was like,
I really want to do this.

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,850
At the time I was,
uh,

97
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,420
I was actually in my residency in
Baltimore and I was like,

98
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:34,960
you know,
I really want to do this and I don't

99
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,920
have to learn how to swim to do it.
So I started taking swimming lessons and

100
00:04:37,921 --> 00:04:39,600
then,
um,

101
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,580
let me to make it very long story short.
Basically by about the summer of 2005,

102
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:49,440
I entered my first swim race,
which was a two mile swim race in Lake

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,273
Restin,
Virginia.

104
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,490
And I did it and I was like,
oh my God,

105
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:56,460
I just swam two miles in the open water.
You know,

106
00:04:56,461 --> 00:04:57,960
it was hard,
but I was like,

107
00:04:57,961 --> 00:04:59,700
okay,
that's the proof of concept.

108
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,580
Now you just got to figure out how to
make it 2025 miles.

109
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,150
And uh,
so I just,

110
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,570
you know,
went completely psycho and ratcheted up

111
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:10,500
the training.
And,

112
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:16,410
and then in October of 2005 I did my
first catalina swim.

113
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,290
Wow.
That's gotta be a pretty good feeling

114
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:25,220
though when you're done that you are
capable of pushing yourself to what most

115
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:27,080
people think is an impossible distance.

116
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,310
Yeah.
I mean,

117
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,450
people,
you asked a moment ago,

118
00:05:30,451 --> 00:05:33,270
why do you do this?
I would say that in life,

119
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,240
um,
velocity means very little acceleration

120
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:38,880
means everything.
So what do I mean by that?

121
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,060
Right?
Like if you're going 650 miles an hour

122
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:43,740
in an airplane,
you don't actually feel it.

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,490
You only feel when speed changes,
right?

124
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,140
So I've always had this theory that
emotionally that's also true.

125
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:56,850
Like happiness is only interesting when
it's juxtaposed with sadness.

126
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,560
And so the feeling of crawling on the
shore after you've been swimming for 12

127
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:07,580
to 14 hours is amazing.
But what makes it especially amazing is

128
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:10,610
that six hours earlier you thought you
were going to die.

129
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,420
So you start these swims in the middle
of the night to avoid the shipping

130
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:18,590
traffic.
So that first swim boat drops you off at

131
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:20,570
Catalina island.
It's midnight.

132
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,170
That's a darkness.
You can't imagine like you can't even

133
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:25,520
see la from Catalina.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,510
You have to swim for six hours before
you even see the lights of Las Angeles.

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,590
Really?
Yeah.

136
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,340
What do you see the stars and the
phospho like bioluminescent organisms in

137
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,840
the water.
Whoa.

138
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,160
Just incredible,
man.

139
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,580
That's worth the price of admission.
So every time your hand comes through

140
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:46,610
the water,
you're pulling and ripping these little

141
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:51,020
things and you're seeing the sparks and
you can't tell where the water ends in

142
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:53,030
the sky starts.
In other words,

143
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,690
the stars and the bio luminescence looks
like one cylinder.

144
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,660
Wow.
So for the first few hours,

145
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:01,220
that's cool.
But then,

146
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,660
you know,
my first swim,

147
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:05,030
the water was incredibly rough.
Um,

148
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,570
I had only swim in the ocean for two
weeks before the swim.

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,550
I did all my training in a swimming
pool,

150
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,630
so in a lake on the east coast.
So now I look,

151
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:17,120
I wasn't used to how to keep the
saltwater out of my mouth.

152
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,290
So then I was like puking my guts out
and then my,

153
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,510
um,
while you were swimming?

154
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,520
Yeah,
yeah,

155
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,330
yeah.
Just because at work you just stop and

156
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,510
puke and then keep swimming.
And then,

157
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,180
uh,
but then my tongue started to get really

158
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:34,700
swollen from the saltwater because
again,

159
00:07:34,701 --> 00:07:37,520
as I would learn later on,
I would go on to do many more of these

160
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,220
swims.
But what I learned is the importance of

161
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,710
spitting in the water out of your mouth
very quickly.

162
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:45,260
So in a,
in a freshwater pool or lake,

163
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,310
you get away with more.
But in the ocean you swallow that salt

164
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:50,570
water,
you're going to get sick as hell.

165
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:55,160
So all this stuff's going on.
So by five in the morning,

166
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:58,460
you've been swimming for five hours,
you're getting cold.

167
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,860
You're,
I mean,

168
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,701
you know,
frankly,

169
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:05,130
just physiologically like your cortisol
levels are at a nadir,

170
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,920
you're just,
you feel horrible.

171
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,320
It's like,
it's a really bad feeling and you're not

172
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:12,020
even halfway there.
And it's like you don't know if you can

173
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:12,781
do it and blah,
blah,

174
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:13,001
blah,
blah,

175
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:14,210
blah.
Well,

176
00:08:14,211 --> 00:08:16,820
if six hours later,
you're now crawling out of the water

177
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:18,740
feeling like you've done this amazing
thing,

178
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,420
that that's emotional acceleration.
That's like the greatest contrast.

179
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,450
I know what I mean.
I've never experienced that.

180
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,760
But I was,
uh,

181
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,440
explaining the other day to a friend of
mine about this,

182
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:33,860
a camping trip that we went on in
Montana when it was like nine degrees

183
00:08:33,861 --> 00:08:35,420
outside.
It was freezing cold.

184
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,090
We stayed out there for five,
six days.

185
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:40,640
And then when we finally got to a hotel
room,

186
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:44,390
I took a shower and it was the most
amazing shower I've ever experienced in

187
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,330
my life.
And that's a small thing,

188
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,090
but you take a shower every day and it's
like a big deal when you do it in that

189
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:51,400
setting or,
or think about the,

190
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:54,830
the meal you've had if you've been fast,
similar situation.

191
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,730
Yeah,
we're starving or lost at sea.

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,530
Yeah,
yeah,

193
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,860
yeah.
I can't imagine.

194
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,620
That's a,
so now that you've done,

195
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,270
and how many of these have you done
these crazy?

196
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:06,660
He swim races or swim,
call them several.

197
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,520
Yeah.
Usually these major,

198
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:10,700
major ones are not racist.
You're,

199
00:09:10,701 --> 00:09:12,360
you're on your own.
You have to,

200
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,020
you go to the Federation that oversees
that body of water and you say,

201
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:17,010
Hey,
I want to do this.

202
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:17,880
And then you,
you know,

203
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,640
you go through all the channels to do
it.

204
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,540
Like they have to have an observer there
and they,

205
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,590
you follow these official rules,
you can be registered as someone was

206
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,730
actually completed it.
Right.

207
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,300
And someone's there to make sure you
didn't,

208
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,530
you know,
you did it correctly.

209
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,290
Um,
I dunno,

210
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:34,440
I probably done all in probably like a
dozen of these,

211
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:36,870
but probably like six of them,
really long ones.

212
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,780
What's the longest?
Well,

213
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,380
that's a good question.
What does the Mallee one was 20 miles

214
00:09:43,381 --> 00:09:45,630
there and back.
So 40 miles miles total.

215
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,190
The maui channel is a 10 mile channel.
So round trip is 20.

216
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:54,540
The bigger question is time in the water
because you rarely get to swim these in

217
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,730
a straight line.
So the Maui Lanai one,

218
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,000
I wanted to go Maui Lanai,
Molokai,

219
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,500
Maui to do the triangle and that would
have been 30 miles as a crow flies.

220
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,150
But we just,
you know,

221
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,990
boat captain wasn't willing to do it at
night because of the tiger sharps.

222
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:15,050
And during the daytime we couldn't
physiologically figure out how one could

223
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,430
suffer against those,
the wind,

224
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,380
cause the wind gets so brutal in the
middle of the day.

225
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,980
So even the one that I did,
which was just a there and back,

226
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,990
I ended up swimming for 12 hours because
on the,

227
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,060
the,
the first way crossing where there was

228
00:10:30,061 --> 00:10:35,061
no wind took me four hours and then it
took eight hours to get back because I

229
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:38,190
was swimming like the hypotenuse of a
triangle,

230
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,480
right?

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Like the current's going this way.
So I had to swim this way just to go in

232
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:46,530
a straight line and I still can,
I almost missed Maui,

233
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,250
Jesus Christ.
So I almost got swept out to Molokai

234
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,550
just because the current was about 1.7
knots,

235
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,850
which is about as fast as I can swim.
Maybe two knots.

236
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,240
Fuck,
that is a ridiculous thing,

237
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:03,540
man.
Why are you doing this?

238
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:04,374
This,
this,

239
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,790
this,
this maniacal?

240
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,410
Well,
I don't do it anymore.

241
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,770
I mean it was certainly a,
it was an amazing season in my life,

242
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:15,771
but I think once my daughter was born,
which was 10 years ago this summer,

243
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,770
that's when I,
I only probably did two of these after

244
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,140
she was born because then the training
just got,

245
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,540
so I just,
you got to live in the water if you want

246
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,350
to do this sport,
like you got to including the winter,

247
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,160
you know,
like,

248
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
you know,
even in San Diego where I live,

249
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:35,350
it's still,
you know,

250
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,740
55 degrees in the water and you're going
to spend three,

251
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:41,400
four hours a day in the water freezing,
you know,

252
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,660
it's just,
so I was like,

253
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,610
you know,
I just don't have the,

254
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,640
the,
the drive to spend 25 hours a week

255
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:48,474
swimming.

256
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,340
Yeah.
What was the,

257
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,040
what was going on in San Diego when that
guy got bitten half by a shark

258
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,260
couple of years back.
They were training for something.

259
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,740
Yeah.
It's funny you remember that.

260
00:11:58,741 --> 00:12:02,370
That was may of 2008 I remember that
like it was yesterday.

261
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:06,480
So at the time I lived in San Francisco,
and this is actually just before I swim,

262
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:08,220
the Maui thing,
now that I think about it,

263
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:09,990
that was 10 years ago.
I swim the Maui thing in,

264
00:12:09,991 --> 00:12:12,260
uh,
June of oh six but June of,

265
00:12:12,261 --> 00:12:14,820
oh wait.
So I'm doing all my training in a

266
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:19,770
swimming pool up in San Francisco
because I don't want to acclimate to

267
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:22,740
very cold water.
I actually want to be in warm water,

268
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,100
but I needed one long ocean swim of like
14 or 15 miles as my last training swim.

269
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,000
So I came down to San Diego to do it.
And just by bad luck,

270
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,850
I came down a few days after that guy
was killed.

271
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,550
Now,
this was a,

272
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,790
a guy,
I didn't know him,

273
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,480
but he was a triathlete training with a
triathlon group that they would go out

274
00:12:42,481 --> 00:12:45,510
and swim every morning and I know the
beach exactly where it happened in

275
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:46,350
Solana beach.

276
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,790
And,
um,

277
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,130
unfortunately,
like most people who get attacked by

278
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:51,690
great whites,
they have a very,

279
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,180
they always attack the same way,
which is below and behind stealth bite

280
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,630
up and then they retreat.
So they're trying to basically enjoy the

281
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:03,570
praise so that their prey exsanguinate
and then they take off and then they

282
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:07,290
wait until you bleed out.
So they never saw the shark.

283
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,570
But you could tell from the bite marks
it was,

284
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,090
um,
actually had a friend who was on the

285
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:17,091
beach and saw him when he came out and
he was basically dead when he got to

286
00:13:17,191 --> 00:13:18,000
shore.
He had,

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,680
he had bled to death.
The problem is,

288
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,960
so in this case,
the shark had bitten and cut through his

289
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:26,280
femoral arteries and veins and the
saltwater prevents you from having any

290
00:13:26,281 --> 00:13:29,400
hemostasis,
so it exacerbates the blood loss.

291
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,890
So that's generally how folks parish
when they're out of the water.

292
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,480
Um,
you know,

293
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,430
a bunch of other swimmers came to his
rescue.

294
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,090
And Luckily that commotion prevents the
Sharks from wanting to come back.

295
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,760
So three days later I go out and I'm
swimming at that beach because I swam

296
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,850
from my,
my training swim was La Jolla up to

297
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:55,500
Solana beach and back.
And I got to tell you like three days

298
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,500
after a guy dies where you're swimming.
It is,

299
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:00,510
it was about one of the most,
uh,

300
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,830
mentally challenging training swims to
be like,

301
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,540
cause you can't see like the water at
that part of the beach is so murky,

302
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,220
you know,
and you're only a couple of hundred

303
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,180
yards off shore that like you can barely
see your hands when you're swimming.

304
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:19,110
Um,
and so you're just thinking this the

305
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,943
day.

306
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,970
Oh Dude.
Yeah.

307
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,800
I'm not interested in that.
I can't see why.

308
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:28,960
You know,
there's just something about sharks too.

309
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,280
I mean there,
to me,

310
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:34,270
one of the most terrifying thing for
it's first of all were so inept in the

311
00:14:34,271 --> 00:14:34,871
water.
I mean,

312
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,090
even a person like you is a great
swimmer.

313
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,691
Yeah.
We're,

314
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:38,740
we're a joke.
Yeah.

315
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:41,260
What we are in comparison to what they
are.

316
00:14:41,261 --> 00:14:44,440
It's just you're,
you're throwing yourself into the world

317
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,640
of a super predator.
And to know that one just jacked a

318
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:50,920
person just a few days before and you're
out there swimming.

319
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,870
Yeah.
Although I will say this,

320
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:55,220
you know,
when it's all said and done,

321
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,760
all of the close encounters I've had,
probably the scariest moment I've ever

322
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:02,060
had in the water was doing a swim from
Santa Rosa to Santa Barbara.

323
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:06,140
So Santa Rosa Island,
which is the second furthest North

324
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,010
Channel Island.
You've got San Miguel,

325
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,450
Santa Rosa,
Santa Cruz,

326
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:10,910
and Anacapa represent the top four
channel islands.

327
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,170
So we did this November swim.
It was a nighttime thing.

328
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,630
Again,
swimming from Santa Rosa Island to Santa

329
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,040
Barbara.
And uh,

330
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,700
at about five in the morning,
maybe six in the morning,

331
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:25,910
you're just starting to get enough light
where you can see and you're out there.

332
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:30,911
So you really have amazing visibility.
And I looked down probably 40 feet and I

333
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:37,361
see this enormous thing swimming like
this,

334
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,730
which is how sharks swim.
And I see the dorsal fin and the

335
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,820
position that freaks me out.
And the tails this way.

336
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,560
But all of that is shark,
right.

337
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,900
And I like,
you know,

338
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,170
like lift up out of the water,
kind of hyperventilate for a second.

339
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:52,490
And I'm thinking to myself,
all right,

340
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:55,070
you got to make a judgment call here.
If that's really a great white,

341
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,630
you probably ought to get out of the
water.

342
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,910
But if you,
the moment you are out of the water,

343
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:00,140
that's it.
The swim was over.

344
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,480
Like you just spent like months doing
this,

345
00:16:02,481 --> 00:16:06,560
like it's done.
So then I convinced myself,

346
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:08,990
and I think I'm right.
I think it was a dolphin on its side

347
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,700
because a dolphin on its side with its
fin would get stale.

348
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,530
Fin would be the same way and it could
swim that way.

349
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,090
So in the end,
I just kept swimming.

350
00:16:17,091 --> 00:16:18,530
But I mean,
that scared the shit out of me.

351
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,570
Well,
they have seen quite a few of them off

352
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:22,330
the coast of Malibu.
There's a,

353
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,061
Oh,
there's tons.

354
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:27,350
There's no question they're there.
They are way more plentiful than we

355
00:16:27,351 --> 00:16:29,480
realize.
And all you can do is talk to the

356
00:16:29,481 --> 00:16:30,920
fishermen.
Like the fishermen will tell you,

357
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,420
they're like,
you're like off core and auto.

358
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,720
I mean it's like nonstop great whites.
Really?

359
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:37,663
Oh yeah.

360
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,730
Why are you freaking me out?
The good news is they see us all the

361
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:47,630
time and most of the time they realize
we're not what they want.

362
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,930
They want seals.
Yeah.

363
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,790
The,
the,

364
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,590
whenever they attack us,
they're making a mistake.

365
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,390
Now is there a s like a suit you can
wear your Kevlar suit to protect,

366
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,220
protects you from getting bitten in
half?

367
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,590
No,
but this is so funny.

368
00:17:00,591 --> 00:17:03,890
You bring this up.
I became obsessed with this thing called

369
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,724
the uh

370
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,340
oh,
what was it called?

371
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:08,740
Christ.
You,

372
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,610
you,
you put the thing on your ankle.

373
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,950
Like you had like a little velcro thing,
you'd wrap it on your ankle and had a

374
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,810
tail like this long,
you know,

375
00:17:14,811 --> 00:17:19,811
like four foot long thing and it was
charged and it sends out an electrical

376
00:17:20,421 --> 00:17:24,440
impulse that um,
disturbs the shit out of the sharks.

377
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:28,220
The sharks knows is an Oregon that
census electricity.

378
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,790
So when a shark,
like it could be pitch black,

379
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:34,790
it could be salt water and they can
still scope you ma,

380
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,920
you know,
from hundreds of yards away based on the

381
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:40,250
electrical activity of your heart.
And that Oregon is their nose.

382
00:17:40,251 --> 00:17:41,930
So this little thing,
I forgot what it was called,

383
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:46,750
like the Shark Taser or some shit.
It puts out a signal that like tazes

384
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,380
them and they don't want to get within
like,

385
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,920
oh there it is.
James caught up here,

386
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:55,430
the world's first shark deterrent band.
It's called the shark bands worn on the

387
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:57,480
wrist or ankle it,
I don't know.

388
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:00,900
I thought it had a different name,
but because the one that I was going to

389
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:04,860
get and did a ton of research into,
had a really long tail hanging off it

390
00:18:04,861 --> 00:18:09,210
and that became the problem.
He's uses patented magnetic technology

391
00:18:09,211 --> 00:18:11,940
to repel sharks.
So the tail was a problem because of the

392
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:12,960
drag?
No,

393
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:15,030
because it would,
it sounds silly,

394
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,800
but it would come up and zap you in the
nuts.

395
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,810
So you'd be so they became unbearable to
practice swimming in this thing.

396
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,980
Cause you're like every 37 seconds you'd
get zapped by the tail.

397
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,220
Um,
and I was just like,

398
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:31,850
yes.
I like how it says reduced the risk.

399
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,311
Oh yeah.
Hey,

400
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:33,960
can I get some numbers?
Please

401
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,600
tell I went to see a reduced by how much
fy one,

402
00:18:39,601 --> 00:18:40,500
7%.

403
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,390
Um,
and then it also is a leash for your

404
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,910
surfboard too.
You can use one of those,

405
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,050
the trap,
a tier,

406
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,220
a strapped to your ankle.
But

407
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,950
yeah,
no,

408
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,230
it's going to come to me like in an
hour.

409
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,030
I'll remember what this silly thing was.
Jamie.

410
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,873
You'll probably find it.
Yeah,

411
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,320
off of Catalina.
I know it's one of the best shark

412
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:05,040
fishing places in the world.
I have a friend of mine who told me that

413
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,910
if you think about like wild places on
earth that are just overrun with

414
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:13,290
predators and terrifying like Predator
prey activity.

415
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,460
Catalina island is one of the top spots
in the world.

416
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:18,750
I was like,
what are you talking about?

417
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,700
He's like,
I'm telling you man,

418
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,630
the shark fishing off Catalina Island is
fucking insane.

419
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,970
And then I watched a television show
just,

420
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,370
you know,
synchronicity a couple of days later and

421
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,070
it was these guys shark fishing off of
Catalina.

422
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,620
I was like,
what in the fuck?

423
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:37,980
I could have never guessed the catching
Makos mostly.

424
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,110
And it's actually my recollection
because we swam around Catalina ones as

425
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:46,200
well.
The backside is way more aggressive than

426
00:19:46,201 --> 00:19:49,170
the front side.
The side that faces the Pacific side

427
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:51,300
they'd rather than face as Los Angeles.
Yeah,

428
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,970
there's way more crazy stuff out.
Yeah.

429
00:19:52,971 --> 00:19:54,780
I think that's exactly where they were.
Yeah.

430
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:57,600
It looked pretty nuts.
I mean they were bringing in these 15

431
00:19:57,601 --> 00:19:58,950
foot sharks.
I mean it was like,

432
00:19:58,951 --> 00:20:01,740
what in the fuck?
These are just floating around out

433
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:03,360
there,
you know,

434
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,710
it's uh,
I mean,

435
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,600
I guess of course they are,
right.

436
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,090
I mean it's a,
there's a lot of fish out there as well,

437
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:12,660
so I'm sure they Adelina is amazing.
Pretty crazy.

438
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,880
I'd,
I'd,

439
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,260
I'd swim to it,
I'd swam from it.

440
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,270
I just want him around it.
I'd done the only thing and I'd never

441
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:21,930
stepped foot on it except at the
beginning or end of a swim until five

442
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:22,290
years ago.

443
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:25,200
I went there for a vacation,
like actually just went to avalon for

444
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,250
you know,
three days.

445
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,280
I'm like,
it's not a place I could live.

446
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,550
It's a little too quiet,
but for three or four days.

447
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:36,930
It was amazing.
I think people hunt on Catalina.

448
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,480
They've got huge buffalo there.
Is that what it is?

449
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,400
Yeah,
so apparently there was a movie that was

450
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:43,630
made there back in the 20s or something
like that.

451
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,720
Let a bunch of Buffalo,
they had a bunch of Buffalo.

452
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,320
Yeah,
for the movie and I guess they never

453
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,890
liked to corral or something.
She shits is totally overrun with

454
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,380
Buffalo.
Well there was one of the channel

455
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:57,940
islands that they had actually turned
into a bow hunting destination.

456
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,580
Like they had brought in a bunch of
deer.

457
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,570
I think they brought in stags and a
bunch of weird exotic shit and they put

458
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:05,410
him on this island.

459
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,000
I think they even had elk and then
biologists just weren't having it.

460
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,310
They were like,
this is just so out of whack.

461
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:17,170
And so they had them eradicated and the
way they do that is it's pretty

462
00:21:17,171 --> 00:21:19,480
gruesome.
They just gunned down from the air and

463
00:21:19,481 --> 00:21:21,760
just leave the bodies.
Yeah.

464
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:24,850
They just decided that they were to
invasive species regardless of how

465
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,700
valuable they might have been.
Two people that wanted to go there and

466
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:28,810
eat them,
you know,

467
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,780
they just decided just for the ecosystem
alone,

468
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:34,000
it's just,
and there's no predators there and they

469
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,780
weren't going to turn the fucking island
to wild kingdom and bring wolves or

470
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:40,240
something in there,
which would be pretty God damn crazy.

471
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:43,840
Imagine if there was an island you go
and they just had wolves and elk running

472
00:21:43,841 --> 00:21:45,970
around an island just,
well,

473
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,260
that's it.
I'm not surprised that we'd gotten them

474
00:21:47,261 --> 00:21:47,680
all down.

475
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,320
At least say make it open season for
hunting or something like that.

476
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:51,640
They could have been productive about
it.

477
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,850
They,
that's an interesting perspective.

478
00:21:54,851 --> 00:21:58,870
Cell Biologists look at it in terms of
the entire ecosystem,

479
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:00,820
right?
They look at in terms of the plants,

480
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,050
the amount of waste,
fecal waste,

481
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,580
if these animals are leaving behind the
fact that they're,

482
00:22:06,581 --> 00:22:09,820
they're literally eating everything that
they can on the sound.

483
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:13,870
They're not supposed to be there.
And then they're competing with whatever

484
00:22:13,871 --> 00:22:16,000
things are native to that island.
Yeah.

485
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,380
And probably,
I mean,

486
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:19,840
you've kind of thousand pound elk.
It's not supposed to be on a fucking

487
00:22:19,841 --> 00:22:22,150
island.
This thing's just eating everything it

488
00:22:22,151 --> 00:22:25,390
can and they don't,
they don't have a winter either.

489
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,910
So it's just like the whole,
like they're just not supposed to be.

490
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,980
The channel islands.
Islands

491
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,440
themselves are kind of amazing.
I mean,

492
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,850
most people know of Catalina,
but you know,

493
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:35,280
there's eight of them and now two of
them,

494
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:37,930
you can't step foot on a,
I think it's allowed to,

495
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:40,200
no,
San Clemente and San Nicolas through

496
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,220
military basis.
So we tried to do a swim from San

497
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,920
Nicolas back to Los Angeles.
This was a relay swim because it's like

498
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:51,921
an 85 mile swim.
And I spent like six months researching

499
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:54,630
it,
speaking to a bunch of naval officers.

500
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:55,081
I was like,
Hey,

501
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:58,420
is there any way we can cause you
officially to have to start a swim,

502
00:22:58,421 --> 00:23:01,080
you have to be able to touch dry land
and be out of the water.

503
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:01,921
And they're like,
yeah,

504
00:23:01,921 --> 00:23:04,050
you can't come on the island.
So in the end,

505
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,450
what we decided was we were just going
to do a stealth landing,

506
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,940
you know,
by the time they came down and screamed

507
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:11,010
at us and shot at us,
we'd have been off the island.

508
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,413
But,
uh,

509
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,850
then we got to the,
now the other big thing I've been

510
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,361
saying,
nick,

511
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:18,240
is that's real shark territory because
that's where the elephant seals live.

512
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,730
And so when we got out there,
we literally could not get to shore

513
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:26,070
because of the elephant seals.
Like we're,

514
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:29,260
we're 200 yards off sand neck.
And you know,

515
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,770
this is after I'd taken a full two days
to get out there.

516
00:23:31,771 --> 00:23:33,360
I mean,
this place is really hard to get to

517
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:35,490
because the water is brutal and you're
not in a huge boat.

518
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,863
And,
uh,

519
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,060
yeah,
you're looking at like thousand pound

520
00:23:39,061 --> 00:23:41,220
elephant seals that are just like
licking their chops,

521
00:23:41,221 --> 00:23:42,630
looking at you,
trying to get in the water.

522
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:45,770
What would they do with you?
I didn't want to find out,

523
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,810
but they're not predatory,
right?

524
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,510
I mean I don't think I know.
I mean I think they're aggressive is

525
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:52,400
hell.
Did you see that video of the little

526
00:23:52,401 --> 00:23:56,840
girl that's sitting on a dock and a seal
jumps up and grabs her in the ass and

527
00:23:56,841 --> 00:23:58,730
pulled her under the water?
Do you ever see that Jamie?

528
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,700
Yeah,
and I didn't think that seals ever did

529
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,440
something like that before.
I Dunno.

530
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,370
I did see a special once about how
dolphins could be kind of aggressive

531
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,140
with each other.
Like they could harm,

532
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,750
you know Lou,
this is,

533
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:16,190
the seal is sitting there and this girl
see line actually look at this.

534
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,440
It comes up and they think,
yeah,

535
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,340
but I think it was probably looking for
a handout and these people weren't

536
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,340
giving it to her.
Oh.

537
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,360
And then she turns her,
he says,

538
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,230
yeah,
fuck that thing.

539
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,410
I'd be like,
I'd be right back.

540
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,320
Fill that fucking puddle with led.

541
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,260
That was fast.
Yeah.

542
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,710
They jumped up fast.
Yeah.

543
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:52,820
They,
they're predators.

544
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,260
I mean,
they eat things.

545
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,330
Yeah.
The 19 plants in the water,

546
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,420
they're eating fish and shit,
you know,

547
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,800
whatever they can get ahold of.
They probably birds and stuff too.

548
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,240
They're probably used to scoop and
things up,

549
00:25:02,241 --> 00:25:06,410
but I bet that what that's from is them
getting to acclimated to people.

550
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,770
Yeah.
Feeding them.

551
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,793
Oh,
sure.

552
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,243
Yeah.
There's a,

553
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,400
they have an issue in boulder where
boulder is a,

554
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,310
if you're been Colorado.
Yeah,

555
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,250
yeah.
Beautiful.

556
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,120
Right.
Gorgeous.

557
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,990
Super Liberal.
Like as progressive as it gets.

558
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,850
Right.
You ever been to San Francisco?

559
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,510
Oh,
I have.

560
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,060
Yeah.
I think boulder is right up there,

561
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:31,070
but there's less people in there that,
you know,

562
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,310
everyone's real healthy and active and
hiking and stuff like that.

563
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,760
They don't allow hunting for mountain
goats on the weekends because there's so

564
00:25:40,851 --> 00:25:43,220
many people hiking and going.

565
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,250
They don't want people killing these
mountain goats in front of them because

566
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:49,610
people freak out.
Even though they have decided that they

567
00:25:49,611 --> 00:25:52,820
have to control the population and kill
a certain number of them to keep the,

568
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,700
um,
but so many people go out there that

569
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:02,780
these things aren't scared of people.
So it's created this really weird

570
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:06,830
situation where if you are hunting them,
you're,

571
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,890
you're almost hunting something that's
domesticated.

572
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,820
People feed them cheetos.
So much so that a friend of mine was

573
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:17,210
talking about it,
that he was up there with his daughter.

574
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,220
His daughter opened up a bag of cheetos
and the goat walked right to a wild

575
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:23,750
goat,
lives out in the fucking woods,

576
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,740
walked right up to his daughter and they
were laughing.

577
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:31,280
She opened up the bag of cheetos and put
it and he stuffed his head in the bag of

578
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:31,640
cheetos.

579
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:35,150
He knew what to do.
And he's in this guy who was talking

580
00:26:35,151 --> 00:26:40,151
about this is a hunter and he's like,
this fucking goat has like cheeto dust

581
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,620
all over its face.
Like it's the craziest thing.

582
00:26:42,621 --> 00:26:45,450
It's face is all red with a cheeto dust.
And it's sitting there chewing these

583
00:26:45,451 --> 00:26:48,620
cheat,
like it's done it before and it's just

584
00:26:48,621 --> 00:26:51,660
read that goat had diabetes I think
probably eventually,

585
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,910
right?
Yeah.

586
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,490
I was in Costa Rica.
This is another similar situation and we

587
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:01,491
were staying at this four seasons out
there and the monkeys have gotten very

588
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:04,800
accustomed to people being there.
And so,

589
00:27:04,801 --> 00:27:07,230
um,
they come by and they hang out and they

590
00:27:07,231 --> 00:27:10,410
were like trying to get things from you.
And um,

591
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,790
my daughter opened up a package oreos
and the monkey just jumped onto this

592
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:16,680
little ledge,
like a couple feet away from her.

593
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,660
And uh,
and my wife was like,

594
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,450
I really don't think it's a good idea
that we feed this thing oreos.

595
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,680
And I said,
wow,

596
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,480
you know,
it's probably going to get eaten by a

597
00:27:24,481 --> 00:27:25,980
fucking crocodile anyway.
I mean,

598
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:29,400
it's going to food poisoning it.
Is that what you're thinking?

599
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,840
I mean,
it's not going to eat this every day.

600
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:32,250
It's not going to be a normal part of
its diet.

601
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:37,730
But we hand the monkey and Oreo,
it pops open the Oreo and starts chewing

602
00:27:37,981 --> 00:27:41,070
on the frosting like a little kid.
And then we're like,

603
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,570
oh,
this little fucker probably gets these

604
00:27:42,571 --> 00:27:43,920
things every week.
Right,

605
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:47,010
so it begs the question,
does he know how to do that?

606
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:51,000
Because he's watched some human do it,
or we innately wired to do that with

607
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:52,920
Oreos.
Ooh.

608
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:57,330
I think he knows how to do it because
someone's giving them Oreos so many

609
00:27:57,331 --> 00:27:59,460
times.
Then he knows that the good stuff,

610
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,020
the good stuff,
the mental,

611
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,500
they should just sell that at a pace.

612
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,933
I don't know.
I think it'd be good.

613
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,310
I think.
I think the middle is only good because

614
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:10,200
you can,
you can contrast it with the,

615
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,910
it comes back to the contrast.
Exactly.

616
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,271
Yes.
Thank you.

617
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,560
Right.
I think you're really right.

618
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,540
I think it was just pure middle.
It'd be pretty gross.

619
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,880
If they probably sold pure middle,
nobody would buy it,

620
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,190
but if they sold those black cookies by
themselves,

621
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:22,110
no one by those fucking gross things
either.

622
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,150
Like should.
Yeah.

623
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,230
This gets worse.
Cookies like those key,

624
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,530
what'd you eat?
The white stuff.

625
00:28:28,531 --> 00:28:29,101
You're like,
all right,

626
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:33,750
I'll eat this stupid ass black cookie.
It's a sunk cost and Cole cookie.

627
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:35,670
Here it is.
Here's a little monkey doing it.

628
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,770
Look,
they grab it from you and they just

629
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:38,880
fucking love o worry.
Look,

630
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:42,240
they look at him opening up,
immediately open it up and start chewing

631
00:28:42,241 --> 00:28:43,074
that white stuff.

632
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,620
Yeah.
Crazy.

633
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,880
And we had,
um,

634
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:52,020
there's a thing that is called the
[inaudible] Monday.

635
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,110
Have you ever heard of those?
It's a,

636
00:28:55,170 --> 00:29:00,170
it's related to the raccoon.
It's this weird animal that lives mostly

637
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:05,211
in central and South America and it has
a northern range that extends into

638
00:29:05,521 --> 00:29:07,980
Arizona all the way up into Mesa.
I think,

639
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,260
um,
like it gets into the areas where it

640
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:13,650
gets cold.
But Arizona I think is the only state in

641
00:29:13,651 --> 00:29:17,850
the u s that has it.
But it's this weird looking monkey

642
00:29:17,851 --> 00:29:22,500
raccoon thing that is so domesticated
that we gave it some grapes.

643
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,480
Here it is.
We gave it some grapes and this little

644
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,350
fucker,
there it is.

645
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,550
I mean,
look at that weird little thing.

646
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,650
It came and uh,
sat,

647
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:35,610
we had like a little,
a patio area in the hotel room and he

648
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:40,611
came and sat down with us and so calm
that it sat and went underneath one of

649
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:41,980
the chairs.

650
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,260
And took a nap after we gave it some
grapes,

651
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,330
like while we're hanging around,
my daughters are running around making

652
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,600
noise and this thing's just chilling.
It's like a pet.

653
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,150
It was a total pet.
It was a total pet.

654
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,273
Yeah.
There they are.

655
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,740
They're cool man.
Weird looking things.

656
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,860
People eat them apparently.
Apparently they hunt them in Arizona.

657
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,510
He's eating Nachos.
Yeah.

658
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:09,250
I mean after seeing this as just like,
I don't think I can hunt that.

659
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,470
I'd have to be pretty hungry to eat one
of those.

660
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,440
They're so cute.
Little face,

661
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,040
weird little animal man.
Really interesting.

662
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,050
Yeah.
Our relationship with animals is very

663
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:23,050
odd when they get into close proximity.
Yeah.

664
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,260
Yeah.
We,

665
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:28,420
we've got a wicked coyote problem and
San Diego and at least in the part I

666
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:31,300
live in and you know,
it's just one of those things once we

667
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:34,270
got rid of mountain lions,
because nobody wants mountain lions

668
00:30:34,271 --> 00:30:36,340
around the coyotes running a muck.

669
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,440
Is that what it is?
I think,

670
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,450
I mean I was talking to a friend of mine
about this the other day actually,

671
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:43,300
and he was saying that there's probably
only like in our neighborhood there's

672
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:47,560
probably only like two mountain lions
left and the,

673
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:52,090
the coyotes just,
they've exploded there.

674
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,720
There's so many of them around.
Like it doesn't really bother me that

675
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,370
much.
I mean I could kind of like listening to

676
00:30:57,371 --> 00:30:59,650
them howl,
but you know,

677
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,630
if you,
if they get into your chicken coop.

678
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,900
Yeah,
I had one killed chickens just a few

679
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,041
weeks ago.
Yeah,

680
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:08,680
yeah.
I have a got video of a dead chicken.

681
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,630
It's such a bummer man.
We chase it away.

682
00:31:10,631 --> 00:31:14,350
It was on the roof of the chicken coop.
The way they jump,

683
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,140
it's so stunning.
Like they're so graceful.

684
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:22,260
Like I've never seen anything that moves
like that in the wild.

685
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,340
The way it coyote does,
they,

686
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,960
there was a six foot fence.

687
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,560
It's on the ground.
It jumps to the top of the six foot

688
00:31:29,561 --> 00:31:30,810
fence,
almost like it's,

689
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,050
it's under different gravity rules than
us and touches the top of the fence and

690
00:31:35,051 --> 00:31:36,790
then boom,
it's on the top of the chicken coop.

691
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,970
I mean in like a second,
like I haven't seen that.

692
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:40,960
That would be,
yeah,

693
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:43,270
it's crazy.
I have video of one of them jumping my

694
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:44,560
fence.
Um,

695
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,570
I caught one of them with a chicken in
his mouth,

696
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,940
jumping the fence,
jumped the six foot fence with a chicken

697
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,740
in his mouth.
Just jump point,

698
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,040
touch the top of the fence with his
front paws back.

699
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:55,930
Paws went over right behind it and it
was gone.

700
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,150
It's crazy.
Um,

701
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,370
but you know,
look,

702
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:00,460
they,
we need them.

703
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,250
We need them to kill the rabbits and the
rats.

704
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:04,990
And if we didn't,
we'd have a giant,

705
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:06,520
like here's what,
that's what I tell my daughter,

706
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,040
cause she,
she like gets all stressed out that

707
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:10,840
there's coyotes and around walking
around her house.

708
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,890
And I was like,
well first of all,

709
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,720
they're pretty skittish of us.
And boy,

710
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:15,820
they keep those roads under control.
They really do.

711
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:19,120
You need them for that.
But there's a coyote problem across the

712
00:32:19,121 --> 00:32:21,160
country.
They're the only animal that's in every

713
00:32:21,161 --> 00:32:23,770
single state in every single city.
Now,

714
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,180
every single city,
there's,

715
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:28,940
there's coyotes in Manhattan.
Come on,

716
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:32,560
I'm not bullshitting in the park.
They've found them in the park.

717
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,640
They found them in the bronx.
They found them in abandoned buildings.

718
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,890
Yeah,
there's a great book I read called

719
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,800
America by a past guests of the podcast,
Dan Flores.

720
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:46,370
He's a a wildlife historian,
so it's fascinating.

721
00:32:46,371 --> 00:32:49,430
There are really,
really unusual animal in that.

722
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:52,700
When you shoot one,
they yell out,

723
00:32:52,701 --> 00:32:54,740
here's this wizards,
coyotes in New York City.

724
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,860
Look at this in fucking New York City.
Dude,

725
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,470
she hit in New York City,
New York City Police Department.

726
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,640
Coyote running down the street.

727
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,680
Yeah,
they're everywhere,

728
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:04,400
man.
They have,

729
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,140
they have a real problem with them in
Chicago.

730
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,840
I thought I could escape them when I'm
in New York.

731
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,670
No,
you can't escape them anywhere.

732
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:14,180
They're in all 50 states now.
They've completely extended the range.

733
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,420
And the reason why they extended their
range is because we,

734
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,790
we went after them.
We hunted them down.

735
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,340
You know,
they were able to eradicate wolves and

736
00:33:22,341 --> 00:33:27,341
the way they were able to eradicate
wolves is they would kill the Alpha and

737
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:29,870
then they would take a,
an animal like a horse,

738
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,080
they would shoot it and then they would
fill it up with strict nine.

739
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,700
And so then they would rub the Alpha,
the body of the Alpha all over this,

740
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,090
this carcass of the horse.
And then the other wolves would come and

741
00:33:41,091 --> 00:33:44,870
smell that the Alpha had been there and
then they would eat the wolf or eat the

742
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,460
horse rather and die.

743
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,720
And so they were able to do this and
essentially use this method plus

744
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,900
shooting them and things like that to
eradicate them from the west.

745
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:58,340
Because of ranchers and cattle farmers,
they've never been able to do that with

746
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:00,080
coyotes.
When you shoot a coyote,

747
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:03,350
if they do roll call,
like when you hear them howling,

748
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,010
if one of them is missing,
it's sends the females,

749
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,820
it sends some sort of a signal where
their bodies produce more pups.

750
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,600
So if ones missing,
instead of having like three pups,

751
00:34:14,601 --> 00:34:18,070
she'll have six.
So you make more coyotes when you kill

752
00:34:18,071 --> 00:34:20,630
them and they extend the range.
When you persecute them,

753
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:22,620
they just extend their range.
It's,

754
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,520
they're fucking crazy animal.
They are wicked smart man.

755
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,740
They've been chewing at the roof of my
chicken coop,

756
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,830
trying to get in.
I came outside the other night,

757
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,810
my dog,
I have a,

758
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,960
I have three dogs,
but one of them is a golden retriever

759
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,750
and that dog has fucking zero instincts.

760
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,490
I mean it's,
it is just,

761
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,310
it's a little human.
It's like,

762
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,110
it's like a little marshmallow.
It's just a,

763
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,370
yeah.
So he's fun.

764
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:49,130
No go running with and stuff.
He's a great dog sweetheart of a dog.

765
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,810
Great pet.
But like,

766
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,100
he's like,
what's going on over there?

767
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,590
What's happening?
There's a fucking coyote on the roof,

768
00:34:54,591 --> 00:34:55,760
dude.
What do you mean what's going on over

769
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,220
there?
They're literally chewing the shingles

770
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,890
off the roof outside.
One job to do.

771
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,980
He'll bark.
He's not interested.

772
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,660
He's just one.
He's only a year old too,

773
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:07,310
but he's just curious.
You know,

774
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,510
it's uh,
it's,

775
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:13,280
it's very weird living in proximity with
all these things because where I live,

776
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,570
you know,
we have a lot of hawks,

777
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:18,540
lot of owls,
lot of coyotes and occasionally amount

778
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,280
line.
And I've seen,

779
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,740
I saw a bobcat once,
which is pretty interesting.

780
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,380
I've never seen one of those.

781
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,250
They're weird looking.
So we're looking thing to see one of a

782
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,690
friend of mine,
um,

783
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:31,400
I put it up on instagram.
Cvu find it.

784
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:34,550
It's fucking old.
It's an old one on instagram.

785
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,650
Um,
a friend of mine had a coyote or a

786
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:42,390
bobcat break into her chicken coop and
kill every one of our chickens and the

787
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:43,380
coyote.
There it is.

788
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,380
Look at that fucking freaky bitch.
How'd you find it so quick?

789
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,590
You're an animal.
Jamie's a bobcat.

790
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,210
Just get the best searching skills of
all time.

791
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:53,130
But look at that.
That's in my friends.

792
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:56,460
Chicken coop.
He says a bunch of murder chickens

793
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:59,460
scattered around it.
Look in that things face.

794
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,020
Yeah.
Fuck that.

795
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,570
That look is fuck you.
Yeah,

796
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:06,070
they'll look is fuck you lady.
Yeah.

797
00:36:06,071 --> 00:36:07,740
It killed your chickens.
Why you have mount side.

798
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,340
Ooh.
Ah,

799
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,350
crazy man.
So,

800
00:36:13,351 --> 00:36:15,370
uh,
how do you know Jocko does,

801
00:36:15,371 --> 00:36:17,310
is how we got connected to the folks at
home.

802
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:21,530
So John's like,
prepare to get your brain blown out on

803
00:36:21,531 --> 00:36:22,380
the side.
My friend over,

804
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:22,861
I said,
all right,

805
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:23,940
let's do it.
So,

806
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,010
uh,
I met Jocko through one of my really

807
00:36:26,011 --> 00:36:27,960
close friends,
a guy named Kirk Parsley,

808
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,700
who's a,
also a navy seal,

809
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,330
a former seal.
And um,

810
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,490
Kirk said,
hey,

811
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,710
you gotta meet my friend Jocko.
Basically it's just like you guys,

812
00:36:37,711 --> 00:36:40,050
you just gotta meet Jocko.
You just have to experience Jocko.

813
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,330
That was basically,
it was like a ride.

814
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,680
Yeah.
So,

815
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,030
so I'm at Jocko,
we obviously connected pretty quickly.

816
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,430
And then,
um,

817
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,050
I think,
oh,

818
00:36:52,051 --> 00:36:57,051
this was before Jockos book had come,
his first first book had come out and I

819
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,460
said,
I got to introduce you to one of my best

820
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,390
friends,
this Guy Tim Ferriss,

821
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:01,141
who I'm obviously,
you know,

822
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:01,974
tim.

823
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,750
And um,
cause Tim's always looking for,

824
00:37:03,751 --> 00:37:05,340
you know,
a great guest on a podcast.

825
00:37:05,341 --> 00:37:07,710
And so I called Tim and I said,
look,

826
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,130
you got to just trust me on this one.
Sight unseen.

827
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,590
Just have Jocko come to San Francisco
next week.

828
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,500
Just I don't need to say anything else.
It will be worth it.

829
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,830
And I,
luckily I had enough credit in the bank

830
00:37:19,831 --> 00:37:20,664
with Tim.
I'd done it.

831
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:23,670
I'd been successful on enough sight,
unseen recommendations,

832
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,310
but I think the Jocko when was the best
one ever,

833
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,850
because he called me after he called me
while Jocko was still there and he's

834
00:37:29,851 --> 00:37:31,080
like,
yeah,

835
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,340
that was pretty intense.
Yeah.

836
00:37:32,341 --> 00:37:34,120
I send them an email after that podcast
on my,

837
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:37,230
that's one of the best podcasts I've
ever heard in my life and I made a post

838
00:37:37,231 --> 00:37:39,930
about it.
Chaco responded to the post and then I

839
00:37:39,931 --> 00:37:43,830
got Jocko on and then I end,
Tim convinced Jocko to do his own

840
00:37:43,831 --> 00:37:44,170
podcasts.

841
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:45,660
Yeah.
And now it's huge.

842
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,620
I mean,
his podcast,

843
00:37:46,621 --> 00:37:51,450
I get text messages all the time from
people thanking me for telling them to

844
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:53,640
listen to it.
And then I get tweets from people

845
00:37:53,641 --> 00:37:58,360
thanking me for talking Jocko in it,
doing it because it's just this app.

846
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,040
Just,
just,

847
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,960
there's outliers in this world,
you know,

848
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,070
in,
in everything.

849
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:05,160
There's outliers in athletics,
there's out.

850
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:08,520
But when it comes to like discipline and
motivation and just,

851
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,330
just when you look at someone who is
just undeniable,

852
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,780
like Jocko is one of those guys,
he's just undeniable.

853
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,310
He's,
he's a specimen.

854
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:21,330
He's definitely
off the graph.

855
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,640
Yeah.
I'd met him a long time ago when,

856
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:26,190
uh,
he was training with Dean lister and

857
00:38:26,191 --> 00:38:29,760
dean was fighting in the UFC.
I remember meeting him and I'm like,

858
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:34,260
what's that guy's deal?
Certain dudes that have got that whole

859
00:38:34,261 --> 00:38:36,100
lot of shit going on behind their eyes.

860
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,341
You're like,
okay,

861
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:39,480
guys seen some stuff,
you know.

862
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,111
Yeah,
I'll tell you.

863
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:43,100
I'll tell you a funny Jocko story.
I don't think I,

864
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,430
I guess I can tell this story in public.
It's pretty funny.

865
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,910
So Jocko was in New York.
I just,

866
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:53,500
after his book came out and um,
you know this and I was like,

867
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:53,881
look,
I want to,

868
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:54,880
I want to juice you.
Some of my,

869
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:56,560
my,
my buddies who run hedge funds here,

870
00:38:56,561 --> 00:38:58,600
because some,
a lot of what Jocko does is they,

871
00:38:58,630 --> 00:38:59,770
you know,
he and his partner,

872
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,320
they consult with,
with guys like this doing leadership

873
00:39:02,321 --> 00:39:05,650
stuff.
And so we went up to the offices of one

874
00:39:05,651 --> 00:39:08,980
of my friends who has this very famous
hedge fund.

875
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:11,290
And his office is like on the 50th floor
on park.

876
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:14,110
And it's looking at,
it's like a beautiful view down park and

877
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,370
we're just,
and we're just sitting there in his

878
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:16,660
office just shooting the shit.

879
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,780
And I forget how it came up,
but somehow,

880
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,030
um,
we were just talking about like,

881
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,780
like how good is a sniper?
Like what does it actually take?

882
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,340
And,
um,

883
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,520
and then of course we're,
we're talking very specifically about,

884
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,230
um,
I can't believe I'm blanking on his

885
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,064
name.
Um,

886
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,150
Chris,
I'm the Bradley Cooper played him in.

887
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,970
Yeah,
Chris Kyle were talking cause cause

888
00:39:39,971 --> 00:39:41,580
Chris Kyle had been,
um,

889
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,810
part of Jockos uh,
team.

890
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,310
Uh,
I forget which seal team,

891
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:47,080
maybe it was he when he was seal team
two.

892
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,453
But,
um,

893
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,410
in fact,
I think Jocko said,

894
00:39:50,411 --> 00:39:50,891
he goes,
you know,

895
00:39:50,891 --> 00:39:53,380
yeah.
Chris was a part of my team for more of

896
00:39:53,381 --> 00:39:57,300
his kills than any of his other kills.
And so then we were like,

897
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,530
like what sets him apart?
I mean,

898
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:02,380
obviously any snow navy seal sniper has
gotta be amazing.

899
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,510
But Chris took it to another level.

900
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:05,500
What,
what was it?

901
00:40:05,501 --> 00:40:06,430
And He,
and he said,

902
00:40:06,431 --> 00:40:07,870
okay,
let me show you what it was.

903
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,810
So he said,
we walked us over to the window and he

904
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,644
goes,
okay,

905
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,030
you see that guy in that hat over there?
Like about a mile down the,

906
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,890
you know,
you can basically see it cause we're

907
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,150
like a pink hat or something.
I said,

908
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:19,871
yeah.
He goes,

909
00:40:19,871 --> 00:40:21,640
okay,
if you're a sniper,

910
00:40:21,641 --> 00:40:25,750
you gotta be able to lay down,
not move and put your eye up against

911
00:40:25,751 --> 00:40:29,890
this thing and like look out at him and
you can't,

912
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:33,610
if you ever take your eye off that
you're going to lose the sight.

913
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:36,110
So you gotta be able to stay in that
position and I'm moving to it.

914
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,690
He goes,
I forgot what the number was,

915
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:42,460
but Jocko said the average navy seal
sniper can stay in that position without

916
00:40:42,461 --> 00:40:45,820
moving.
I glued to the site for x number of

917
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:47,080
minutes and I forgot what the number
was.

918
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,480
Maybe it was like 15 minutes.
He's like,

919
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,280
Chris could do that for two hours.
He could lay in that position,

920
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:59,610
not moving and not taking his eye off
that thing with one eye shut for hours

921
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:01,631
and he,
you know,

922
00:41:01,631 --> 00:41:03,580
he's just like,
he just had a different,

923
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,570
he just had a different gear and um,
it was just an amazing,

924
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,100
I mean,
I mean those are some of my favorite

925
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,730
moments with Jocko is when he like can
tell you something that is like,

926
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,840
like they're like maybe three people in
the world that would understand why that

927
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:17,710
matters.
You know,

928
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,500
sniping is fat is really fascinating,
right?

929
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:24,010
Because just sharp shooting,
just being able to shoot something at a

930
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:27,340
distance and long distance shooting is
a,

931
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:28,870
it's,
it's a big sport.

932
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,850
I mean for,
in terms of target shooting,

933
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:34,490
I mean there's guys that are out there,
they're shooting 1500 yards

934
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:37,730
and doing it competitively.
That's a crazy distance.

935
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:39,140
Amazing.
It's crazy distance.

936
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,620
But when you think about it,
you got a rifle,

937
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,020
it's on arrest,
you're sitting,

938
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,810
you're either on a bench or you're prone
or whatever it is.

939
00:41:47,811 --> 00:41:50,960
You're lying down most of the time.
This is all it is.

940
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,880
It's this with your finger pull,
pull,

941
00:41:52,881 --> 00:41:53,571
pull,
pull,

942
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:54,404
pull,
boom.

943
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,500
Some people are way better at that.
Just think of that coordinating your

944
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:03,140
vision,
getting the radical set on the target,

945
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,420
polling that and without movement.
The outliers are the people who can do

946
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:10,460
that.
And you've got to think like when you,

947
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,560
when you break down physical movements,
right?

948
00:42:12,561 --> 00:42:15,350
Like he watched gymnastics routine in
the Olympics,

949
00:42:15,351 --> 00:42:19,670
like holy shit and it flips and the land
and they stick and it's incredible.

950
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,470
But now break it down to just the
movement of your trigger finger,

951
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:25,251
pull,
pull,

952
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:25,911
pull,
pull,

953
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,070
pull,
play,

954
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:28,303
no movement.

955
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,990
You know,
I mean it's,

956
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:34,250
I'm sure you've shot guns,
but it's hard to like if you shoot

957
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,680
pistols and you have dummy rounds,
you know,

958
00:42:36,681 --> 00:42:39,660
like a lot of people and they mix in
dummy rounds so that they find out that

959
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,680
they're a jerk and a trigger.
And when you see,

960
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:44,810
like I was watching a video with,
um,

961
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,350
Tim Kennedy and Tim Kennedy was a
shooting at the range and he's,

962
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:50,180
he's pulling bang,
Bang,

963
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,770
Bang,
and it goes click.

964
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:52,940
And he goes,
Woo,

965
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:55,220
look at that trigger control like it.
Cause it was,

966
00:42:55,250 --> 00:42:56,780
he put,
the way he pulled it,

967
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,540
it didn't go off target,
it didn't move.

968
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:01,520
It was it,
there was no punch to it,

969
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,400
you know,
but you gotta fucking practice for

970
00:43:04,401 --> 00:43:09,401
forever just to be able to do that.
Just to not anticipate the recoil of the

971
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:13,820
gun and Yank and move and twitch and
just controlling the mind.

972
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:16,100
I mean,
it's a fascinating thing to me that

973
00:43:16,101 --> 00:43:18,770
just,
just pulling this one thing or you would

974
00:43:18,771 --> 00:43:21,110
think fucking anybody could do that.
I can show you how to do that.

975
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,400
You know,
like,

976
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,220
like I've had friends that say they want
to go hunting.

977
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:25,941
Uh,
you know,

978
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:27,030
I want to go hunting.
You know what,

979
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,280
what do I do?
Where do I get a boat?

980
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:29,330
I'm like,
slow down.

981
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,590
Let's get your rifle.
Because I could teach you how to shoot a

982
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:34,490
rifle.
We could,

983
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:36,570
we could get someone that we could cite
in your rifle,

984
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,960
go to the range,
we'll cite it in under a hundred yards,

985
00:43:38,961 --> 00:43:43,190
get ya a good accurate rifle.
And then all you have to do is kind of

986
00:43:43,191 --> 00:43:44,900
keep it together.
A rifle,

987
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:47,540
we get into a hundred yards of a wild
pig,

988
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:51,950
you're going to be able to kill this
thing 100% you got years before you're

989
00:43:51,951 --> 00:43:53,330
gonna be able to shoot that thing with a
bow.

990
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,710
I mean,
fucking years.

991
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,260
First of all it is,
and the bow is like,

992
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:00,590
my wife said this to me awhile ago,
she said,

993
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:03,710
of all the things you do,
she's like,

994
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:07,460
archery seems to be the only one where
even if you don't have a good day,

995
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:09,650
you're still happy.
Like if I,

996
00:44:09,651 --> 00:44:11,870
if I,
if I'm on the race track and I'm driving

997
00:44:11,871 --> 00:44:13,430
a race car or if I'm,
you know,

998
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,920
swimming or whatever,
and I just have a bad day,

999
00:44:15,921 --> 00:44:17,840
like I don't,
I'm just not firing on all cylinders

1000
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:18,674
like it,
you know,

1001
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:20,270
just kind of pisses me off.
Right?

1002
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:23,210
There's something about archery where
even if I'm not having a good day,

1003
00:44:23,211 --> 00:44:26,390
like
maybe it's an extension of what you're

1004
00:44:26,391 --> 00:44:28,460
talking about with the trigger finger.
So for me,

1005
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,010
I got an artery because of tim and the
story

1006
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,570
that the thing that he told me,
which obviously for anyone who has,

1007
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:36,240
yeah.
The thing that he told me that

1008
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,610
immediately made me be like,
I want to do this.

1009
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,660
It was just anything that requires that
much perfection just seems great.

1010
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,890
And he was like,
yeah,

1011
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:45,660
you don't take a shot unless you can
kill the animal.

1012
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,710
Like,
you know?

1013
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,870
And so like you might take one shot in
two days,

1014
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:50,490
like it's,
it's gotta be a kill shot and the kill

1015
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:51,660
shots got to look like x,
y,

1016
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:52,230
and Z.
And I was like,

1017
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,720
oh,
that's like you gotta be dialed in.

1018
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:58,860
So it was this idea of back tension,
you know,

1019
00:44:58,861 --> 00:45:00,300
it was sort of like,
wow,

1020
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,880
you're taking a perfect shot.
Like it's all in the Rhomboids,

1021
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,510
you know,
it's all back here and you've got to be

1022
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:07,410
able to do,
as you said,

1023
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:11,520
you've got to completely be able to
eliminate any anticipation,

1024
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,840
any of this business.

1025
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:15,060
And Yeah.
And so I think that,

1026
00:45:15,870 --> 00:45:18,480
I think of archery for me is almost like
a meditation.

1027
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,020
Like,
if you,

1028
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,630
like I'm talking in the way,
like Sam Harris would talk about sort of

1029
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:26,631
consciousness and the way you are so
hyper aware of what you're doing that

1030
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,790
yes,
you can daydream and your mind can

1031
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,220
wander.
But if you actually start to imagine the

1032
00:45:32,221 --> 00:45:36,180
sensations of every part of archery,
in many ways it feels like meditating.

1033
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,900
So I think that's why I'm just like,
you know,

1034
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:41,970
and I never really thought about it with
shooting a rifle.

1035
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,950
Um,
cause I don't have much experience with

1036
00:45:43,951 --> 00:45:47,220
guns,
but I'm guessing it's very similar.

1037
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:48,660
But as you said,
like the,

1038
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,850
the,
the difference between the good and the

1039
00:45:50,851 --> 00:45:54,090
great and that is less obvious,
you know,

1040
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,530
at a distance.
Yeah.

1041
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:59,790
I think a offhand shooting a rifle and
shooting a bow,

1042
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:00,683
I bet.

1043
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:01,920
I bet.
Um,

1044
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,920
just as accurate at 60 yards as the
average person is not a sniper,

1045
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:11,880
but the average person with a rifle,
you can be pretty fucking accurate.

1046
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,850
You can't off a bench.
So there's,

1047
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:16,650
there's some similarities.
There's,

1048
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:21,240
there's a similarity to having the,
you have to have perfect technique.

1049
00:46:21,241 --> 00:46:24,060
You have to have the right stance.
You have to make sure that you know

1050
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:27,900
everything's locked in and your,
your structure is correct.

1051
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:31,320
But I agree with you that I think it's
some sort of a meditation.

1052
00:46:31,321 --> 00:46:36,321
I also think there's something to
hitting a target that is in our DNA

1053
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:41,370
that's connected to hunting,
that's connected to survival,

1054
00:46:41,371 --> 00:46:46,350
that's connected to the thousands of
years that people through arrows and

1055
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,080
fucking what did that,
what does that thing called?

1056
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:52,090
What's that thing called?
That they had a lot of,

1057
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:52,951
yeah.
Is that,

1058
00:46:52,951 --> 00:46:54,420
I say that Atlatl right?
Yeah.

1059
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,260
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah.

1060
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,800
That's like a,
an advanced spear throwing thing and

1061
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:03,801
then archery and just,
I think when a person would hit a deer,

1062
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,960
they knew their tribe was going to eat.
Right.

1063
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,790
And so there's this like charge and you
get a small amount of that juice when

1064
00:47:11,791 --> 00:47:12,780
you hit a target.
Yeah,

1065
00:47:12,781 --> 00:47:13,840
no,
I'm sure there's,

1066
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:18,150
there's gotta be dopamine that's being
secreted when we send to do that.

1067
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,510
It's the greatest feeling in the world.
It shouldn't make sense.

1068
00:47:21,511 --> 00:47:23,220
Like when you looking at someone doing
it,

1069
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:24,930
you're like,
what do you give a fuck if that Arrow

1070
00:47:24,931 --> 00:47:26,490
goes in there?
It doesn't make any sense.

1071
00:47:26,491 --> 00:47:31,030
Like why does it make sense?
But there's a fucking sat like Jamie

1072
00:47:31,031 --> 00:47:34,090
laughs at me cause I'll hit the bullseye
from 45 yards.

1073
00:47:34,091 --> 00:47:35,440
And I'm like,
yes.

1074
00:47:35,441 --> 00:47:39,490
It's like you get this little Whoa,
you get a little a little burst man.

1075
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,590
I just liked the whole experience,
even the sound.

1076
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,200
So sometimes like when my veins get
holes in them,

1077
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,900
like sometimes you put a broadhead
through or are you put like a field tip

1078
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:50,360
through another one.
And now obviously sometimes if you trash

1079
00:47:50,361 --> 00:47:50,951
the vein,
the air,

1080
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,480
it doesn't work.
But like usually just a single hole and

1081
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:55,570
a vein,
we'll produce a sound that is the

1082
00:47:55,571 --> 00:47:59,080
greatest sound you've ever heard when
that Arrow leaves to whistle.

1083
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,750
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1084
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,420
I love it.
So when certain broadheads certain

1085
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:06,910
vented broadheads they whistle,
it was still too much.

1086
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,400
They give you all the heads up.
Yeah.

1087
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,100
Yeah.
So that whole experience of like the

1088
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,960
perfect release,
you know,

1089
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:15,670
even when you surprise yourself,
like I've been,

1090
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:19,840
I switched over to this Carter
revolution release about a back tension

1091
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:20,660
release.
Yeah.

1092
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:22,810
It's the most pure back tension.
It's better than the honey.

1093
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:25,030
Cause the honey,
you could still cheat a little bit.

1094
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,200
You know,
if you were getting lazy,

1095
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:28,470
you could twist,
twist and exactly right.

1096
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,640
But the evolution,
there is no cheating.

1097
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,510
Right.
You can't,

1098
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,410
you so you,
you can surprise yourself with a shot.

1099
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,570
Yeah.
So there's no anticipation.

1100
00:48:37,571 --> 00:48:38,401
Yeah.
Yeah.

1101
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:39,940
That's,
you can't explain this to people who

1102
00:48:39,941 --> 00:48:42,100
don't do it.
And you notice that now you can't,

1103
00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:43,900
they're like,
what are you rambling about?

1104
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:47,680
Boring the shit out of me.
I have tried to explain this to people

1105
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:52,090
who don't know what I'm talking about.
I was trying to explain it to Alexander

1106
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,620
Gustafson,
who's in here the other day and he's a

1107
00:48:53,621 --> 00:48:54,880
hunter too.
And he,

1108
00:48:54,881 --> 00:48:57,130
but he only hunts in Sweden.
You can't bow hunt.

1109
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:57,964
It's not legal.
Oh.

1110
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,270
And uh,
uh,

1111
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:02,470
he wanted to learn how to shoot a bow.
And so I was explaining that I put my

1112
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:03,700
finger on this trigger.

1113
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:05,940
My fingers sits on the trigger.
I use a Carter too.

1114
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,260
I use it a first choice.
It's the name of the race.

1115
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,780
I go my finger and my thumb is on the
trigger,

1116
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,210
but I never squeeze it.
Yup.

1117
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,890
The squeezing is all done with my back
cause I pull,

1118
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,070
then it just goes off and look,
you can see his head was like,

1119
00:49:18,071 --> 00:49:19,630
why?
Why would you?

1120
00:49:19,631 --> 00:49:20,830
But you could just do that.
Right.

1121
00:49:20,831 --> 00:49:23,850
Why don't you just do that?
You don't know.

1122
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,220
It's so counter intuitive.
But um,

1123
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,920
once I got into it,
Tim actually sent me this book on back

1124
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:33,670
tension and then I just devoured it.
I mean it was sort of like the reading

1125
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,080
the Penny Dean Book,
you know,

1126
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:39,220
is tim doing this a lot now?
Not as much as he should be.

1127
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:40,690
Um,
but uh,

1128
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,220
trying to hunt with it.
Yeah.

1129
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:42,871
Tim,
Tim,

1130
00:49:42,871 --> 00:49:43,480
oh,
hunt.

1131
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,000
And um,
I actually got it so far.

1132
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:48,400
I know he's,
he's hunting rifles.

1133
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:48,721
No,
no,

1134
00:49:48,721 --> 00:49:49,200
no.
He's hot.

1135
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:49,810
He goes,
he's,

1136
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:52,030
he's been on bow hunting trips.
That's in fact what got me into it

1137
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:55,150
because about two years ago,
he was getting ready to go to a trip do

1138
00:49:55,151 --> 00:49:57,640
at five day trip in Colorado.
And he called me and said,

1139
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:59,350
um,
hey,

1140
00:49:59,351 --> 00:50:02,680
I want to talk with you about like some
training and some nutrition to like get

1141
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:05,530
ready for this because it's going to be
kind of an extreme whole deal.

1142
00:50:05,531 --> 00:50:06,520
You know,
you're at altitude,

1143
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:08,610
you're running around like crazy.
You've got to be able to like,

1144
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,670
like sprint and then be totally relaxed.
And so he's like,

1145
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,800
you know,
can you help me think about how to train

1146
00:50:14,801 --> 00:50:16,510
and what the nutrition would be?
And I said,

1147
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:18,430
okay,
tell me more about what the demands are.

1148
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:20,410
And the more he told me,
the more I was like,

1149
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,680
why am I not doing this?
This sounds really fricking awesome.

1150
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,810
So that's so,
uh,

1151
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,100
and he's got an awesome video of,
of,

1152
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:29,180
uh,
of this.

1153
00:50:29,181 --> 00:50:30,020
Uh,
he took,

1154
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,370
I mean probably he only took one shot
and like the whole five day trip and it

1155
00:50:34,371 --> 00:50:36,310
was a perfect kill.
It kill.

1156
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,850
It was a huge bird and I can't even
remember what it works.

1157
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,630
Yeah.
Yeah.

1158
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:44,120
It was like a bird on the ground,
like some huge ass bird,

1159
00:50:44,121 --> 00:50:45,440
but it wasn't a Turkey.
It was like,

1160
00:50:45,441 --> 00:50:47,600
I don't remember what it was,
but the shot,

1161
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:48,801
he was like,
you know,

1162
00:50:48,801 --> 00:50:50,270
it was one of those things where it was
like,

1163
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,460
cause it,
you know,

1164
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:54,560
like all my practices on stationary
targets,

1165
00:50:54,561 --> 00:50:56,660
right.
So it's a totally new dimension when

1166
00:50:56,661 --> 00:51:00,410
it's like the things doing this.
So it was flying.

1167
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:02,600
It was,
it was like kind of like either running

1168
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,030
on the ground or about to fly or
something.

1169
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,380
Anybody hit it in motion.
I mean,

1170
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:08,030
it was a great shot.
That's crazy.

1171
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,920
Yeah.
Wonder what the fuck that would be.

1172
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,390
I don't know what it was.
I'll have to ask him.

1173
00:51:11,391 --> 00:51:16,391
Big Bird in North America.
Did he shoot a fucking eagle to shooting

1174
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,210
the Pelican?
Definitely wasn't me.

1175
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,840
Yeah.
I was reading something about the goose

1176
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:25,730
problem about,
uh,

1177
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:28,820
how the goose population has exploded
because,

1178
00:51:28,821 --> 00:51:29,471
uh,
uh,

1179
00:51:29,471 --> 00:51:31,160
farmlands and that,
uh,

1180
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,020
they,
they literally don't,

1181
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:38,060
they don't know what to do with the
certain population of different kinds of

1182
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:40,610
geese that are flying into this country
from Canada.

1183
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,620
It's funny to say this.
I was in Toronto,

1184
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,480
um,
three weeks ago and it,

1185
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:47,180
which is where I'm from and though I
don't go off,

1186
00:51:47,181 --> 00:51:50,690
and we were,
I was with my brother and we were up

1187
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:53,030
taking the kids to some place and sure
enough,

1188
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:57,680
like we're walking from one area to the
other and these geese come up and they

1189
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:00,350
kind of start posturing.
And I'm thinking,

1190
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,200
what the fuck?
And my brother's like,

1191
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,770
Gavin moving.
Clearly one of us is near one of their

1192
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:07,730
eggs.
And I was like,

1193
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:08,870
why?
He's like,

1194
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,621
Oh yeah.
He goes,

1195
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:12,980
these are the most aggressive creatures
and they're big.

1196
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,540
They're pretty big.
So I was like,

1197
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:16,670
fair enough.
Let's just keep walking.

1198
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,860
Don't make eye contact.
They're big,

1199
00:52:18,861 --> 00:52:20,810
but you can cook them,
so fuck them.

1200
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,650
Get out of here.
God Damn Geese.

1201
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,670
Yeah.
Um,

1202
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,600
there's a,
there's a,

1203
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:31,870
there's a certain type of geese that
they call Ribeye in the sky because they

1204
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:37,001
have a delicious red meat to them.
What does that call which fucking God

1205
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:39,620
damn it.
Um,

1206
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,100
but they're very plentiful in Texas.
Yeah.

1207
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:45,360
They hunt them in Texas and they,
they literally,

1208
00:52:45,361 --> 00:52:47,140
it's the meat,
like is it modeled?

1209
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,160
It looks like a Ribeye.
It's crazy.

1210
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:51,290
Sandhill cranes.
You sandhill crane.

1211
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:53,210
That's what it is.
It's not something you don't know.

1212
00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,620
He's a fucking wizard with the Google
massly with Google.

1213
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:00,380
Everyone is a wizard,
but Jamie's an extra wizard.

1214
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:02,510
He's really getting at an India.
Yeah.

1215
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,110
But that is what they call them.
So it's,

1216
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,380
um,
it's actually a common phrase because

1217
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,960
it,
I've had friends that say it might be

1218
00:53:08,961 --> 00:53:11,420
the most delicious meat in the world.
I mean,

1219
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:13,430
it tastes like a,
like a,

1220
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:18,490
like a wad Gu ribeye and it's flying
around and you could shoot like fucking

1221
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:22,610
10 a day.
It's crazy.

1222
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:24,920
Like I have friends that hunt these
things and you know,

1223
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,010
they're fun.
They're mostly in

1224
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,020
Texas.
I don't know where they are,

1225
00:53:28,021 --> 00:53:31,140
but my friends who have hunted them,
hunted them in Texas and I'm sure they

1226
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,780
fly all across the country.
But it,

1227
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:34,561
yeah,
it's a crane.

1228
00:53:34,561 --> 00:53:35,730
It's not a goose.
Yeah.

1229
00:53:35,731 --> 00:53:38,550
I've never been,
I've only been bird hunting twice.

1230
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:42,420
I went once with Anthony Bordain,
uh,

1231
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,170
for his TV show.
We hunted pheasants and he shot one and

1232
00:53:46,171 --> 00:53:48,180
then we cooked it and ate it.
That was fun.

1233
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:50,670
I shot at one and missed and then I shot
a Turkey once,

1234
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,550
which is pretty interesting.
Wild Turkeys.

1235
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,320
Very good.
Very delicious.

1236
00:53:55,710 --> 00:53:57,780
But um,
you know,

1237
00:53:57,781 --> 00:53:58,614
it's,
um,

1238
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,990
when I,
I like mammals,

1239
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:03,900
I like eating mammals.
I prefer,

1240
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,440
I prefer red meat.
I think it's just better for you.

1241
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:10,800
I think it's more nutritious.
It's more exhilarating.

1242
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,200
There's something about the,
the meat itself,

1243
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:14,430
just,
it tastes better.

1244
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,470
No,
I haven't met too many foods.

1245
00:54:16,471 --> 00:54:19,260
I don't like really,
you just sit and eat it.

1246
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:21,210
Well,
with the kind of exercise that you do,

1247
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,820
I'm sure you're,
you almost have a voracious appetite.

1248
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,351
Uh,
I mean,

1249
00:54:25,351 --> 00:54:27,290
I do,
but nothing like what I used to be.

1250
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:30,990
And I fast pretty much every day doing
16 hours.

1251
00:54:30,991 --> 00:54:32,400
What are you doing?
Um,

1252
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,510
it depends.
So when I'm in,

1253
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,000
I split my time between New York and
California.

1254
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:38,610
When I'm in New York,
it's absolutely one meal a day,

1255
00:54:38,611 --> 00:54:40,560
no ifs,
ands or buts because it's just the

1256
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:41,850
schedule is such that,
you know,

1257
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:44,460
I'm seeing patients in the morning and
afternoon and I don't want to do,

1258
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:47,060
I don't want to waste time to eat.
So what do you doctor in?

1259
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,620
Uh,
cause that's a good question.

1260
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:50,483
I mean,
uh,

1261
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,580
I trained as a surgeon and did cancer
surgery.

1262
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,780
Uh,
but I,

1263
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,500
my practice is based on longevity.
So it's sort of how do you apply

1264
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,930
nutrition,
exercise,

1265
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,480
sleep,
stress management,

1266
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,430
endocrinology,
lipid,

1267
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:05,850
Ology,
supplements,

1268
00:55:05,851 --> 00:55:06,930
hormones,
all that stuff.

1269
00:55:06,931 --> 00:55:10,290
Like how do you engineer,
how to make somebody live longer as soon

1270
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,850
as my clinical interest.

1271
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,560
Um,
so yeah,

1272
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,920
so in New York I eat one meal a day,
so it's basically like a 22 hour fasting

1273
00:55:16,921 --> 00:55:19,290
window and then I'm feeding within a two
hour window.

1274
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,820
Wow.
When I'm here.

1275
00:55:21,210 --> 00:55:22,840
Um,
it's about this,

1276
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:23,311
well,
I mean,

1277
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:24,690
yesterday and today it's the same.
Like,

1278
00:55:24,691 --> 00:55:27,170
you know,
today it's just been kind of a busy day.

1279
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:29,790
I won't eat until dinner tonight,
but,

1280
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,730
um,
my short fast would be 16 hours where I

1281
00:55:32,731 --> 00:55:34,680
would eat kind of short fat.
That would be a short,

1282
00:55:34,681 --> 00:55:39,120
fast one for me really to do.
You got to get in touch with your

1283
00:55:39,121 --> 00:55:41,520
evolutionary.
So I had this discussion with a friend

1284
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:43,230
this morning because he was saying to
me,

1285
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:45,360
he can't do 16 hours.
Well he's a pussy.

1286
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,171
No.
And I was like,

1287
00:55:46,171 --> 00:55:48,570
my studies a puzzle.
You just told them no,

1288
00:55:48,571 --> 00:55:51,190
but I said,
you got to understand if,

1289
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:54,060
if our ancestors couldn't function when
they were hungry,

1290
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,043
we wouldn't be here.

1291
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,660
So it's,
it's not just that starvation,

1292
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:00,450
uh,
short term adaptation to starvation is,

1293
00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:02,790
is necessary.
It's probably beneficial.

1294
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:03,960
Uh,
in other words,

1295
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:06,450
you know,
during these short periods of

1296
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,280
deprivation of food,
you know,

1297
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,080
we get just a little bit more
epinephrine and Norepinephrine,

1298
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,080
we just get a little bit sharper,
a little bit better.

1299
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:15,380
Um,
I,

1300
00:56:15,390 --> 00:56:17,540
I can't even,
I can't even remember what it's like to

1301
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,200
eat three meals a day.
It's been so long,

1302
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:24,320
really.
I mean I've been doing crazy shit for 10

1303
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,410
years.
Nutritional wise.

1304
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:30,640
Like I'm gonna spend three years in
ketosis where we go from a one day I was

1305
00:56:30,641 --> 00:56:33,100
in Ketosis for three years.
Um,

1306
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,580
lots of fasting,
but I think intermittent fasting or time

1307
00:56:36,581 --> 00:56:39,490
restricted feeding probably at least
five years.

1308
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,420
And what does for people listening,
what are the benefits of that?

1309
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:45,320
Well,
I mean if you're,

1310
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:48,220
if we're going to get really technical,
we have to be clear that I think a lot

1311
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:51,340
of the benefits are overstated and a lot
of the benefits or things that we've

1312
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:52,450
only studied in animals.

1313
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:56,650
So there's a guy named Satchin panda at
the Salk Institute in San Diego who's I

1314
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:59,260
think one of the world's experts on time
restricted feeding.

1315
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:02,020
But
you know,

1316
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:05,230
for example,
a 16 hour fast and a mouse produces

1317
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,300
unbelievable results.
If you take a group of,

1318
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,070
you know,
certain types of mice are strains of

1319
00:57:09,071 --> 00:57:12,250
rats or other rodents and you in a 24
hour period period,

1320
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:14,530
deprive them of any nutrient for 16
hours,

1321
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,200
but then for eight hours,
let them eat whatever the hell they

1322
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,820
want.
They can't gain weight.

1323
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:20,770
So,
um,

1324
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:21,411
and the,
and the,

1325
00:57:21,411 --> 00:57:25,510
and the reason we think is that it,
once you give a long enough period of

1326
00:57:25,511 --> 00:57:28,690
time when the animal can ramp up,
it's uh,

1327
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:31,780
the like the enzymes in the liver that
are responsible for fat oxidation.

1328
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,540
I mean they just basically become fat
burn.

1329
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:37,120
I hate that term fat burning machine.
It's so overused,

1330
00:57:37,121 --> 00:57:37,720
but that's bay.

1331
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,690
They basically just become unbelievably
efficient at metabolizing fat.

1332
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,340
So,
um,

1333
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,710
we have to be careful that when we
extrapolate that,

1334
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:48,250
cause you and I have a very different
metabolism than a mouse,

1335
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:52,720
like a 16 hour fast to a mouse is much
longer than it is to us.

1336
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,260
So I don't know if those benefits would
extend.

1337
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,180
Um,
also it's not entirely clear the time

1338
00:57:58,181 --> 00:58:01,720
restricted feeding will produce the
longevity benefit that we see in other

1339
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,870
sort of fasting or fasting mimicking
types of diets.

1340
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,000
Um,
so for me,

1341
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:09,010
what it comes down to is,
I mean,

1342
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,320
honestly,
it's just an easier way.

1343
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,200
It gives me a much more liberty with
what I eat during my feeding window.

1344
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:17,260
I don't have to be nearly as restrictive
when I'm feeding.

1345
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,630
Um,
if I have that period off it just,

1346
00:58:19,631 --> 00:58:21,730
just in terms of like my physiologic
response.

1347
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:23,590
Secondly,
there's a convenience thing.

1348
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:26,410
Like I kind of hate being tethered to
eat.

1349
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,160
I like knowing that hey,
if I get into a pinch,

1350
00:58:30,161 --> 00:58:33,400
like I don't have to eat right now and
if I'm sitting on the airplane and

1351
00:58:33,401 --> 00:58:35,860
they're serving dog shit,
I don't have to eat.

1352
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,350
I can wait another five hours until I
eat.

1353
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,690
Um,
I also just feel much more steady in my

1354
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:45,350
energy levels.
I,

1355
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:49,330
I kind of vaguely remember like 10 years
ago when I was kind of like eating a

1356
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:54,100
normal diet,
how I always had this low in energy

1357
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:56,320
after lunch.
Like there is the post lunch,

1358
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:59,890
pre dinner.
I just don't feel good.

1359
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,190
Like not that I feel bad,
but like I'm not sharp.

1360
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,490
I'm not in my a game and I don't even
remember what that feels like anymore,

1361
00:59:06,491 --> 00:59:08,650
which is not to say I feel great all the
time,

1362
00:59:08,651 --> 00:59:11,890
but I definitely don't have that
vacillating energy level.

1363
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:13,411
Yeah.
I've said that to be,

1364
00:59:13,411 --> 00:59:16,150
but when I eliminated most carbs from my
diet,

1365
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,390
you know,
and I have a friend of mine who you

1366
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,890
talked to his trainer about that and his
trainers like you're crazy.

1367
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,190
Eat bread,
eat pasta,

1368
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,410
don't listen to him like no,
don't listen to him.

1369
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:26,120
Like just,
just google it.

1370
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,030
That stuff's fucking terrible for you.
If you want to eat carbohydrates,

1371
00:59:29,031 --> 00:59:30,650
get it from fruits,
you know,

1372
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:34,550
get it from some natural sources.
But just if you have a trainer that's

1373
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:36,740
telling you to eat bread,
get a new fucking trainer.

1374
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:38,970
Cause it's just,
it's not what you need.

1375
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:42,560
And it's nothing wrong with eating if
you want to occasionally and in small

1376
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:45,020
doses.
But when I eliminated most of that stuff

1377
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:47,060
from my diet,
I felt the exact same thing.

1378
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:52,270
I felt that midday nap desire go away
and they're just the fogginess about

1379
00:59:53,771 --> 00:59:55,460
like you at the end of the day like,
Oh God,

1380
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:58,010
I'm fucking tired.
And then I'd have to drink a cup of

1381
00:59:58,011 --> 01:00:01,850
coffee to get ramped back up again.
And this is like never ending cycle of

1382
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:04,880
having this insulin spike and then this
crash.

1383
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,990
And that is,
uh,

1384
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,390
that's from carbohydrates.
It's from refined carbohydrates and you

1385
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,190
know,
having too much fucking sugar in your

1386
01:00:13,191 --> 01:00:14,780
body and everybody does it.
It's like,

1387
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,090
oh,
this will be funny for your,

1388
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:19,910
so,
so google my name and just put like

1389
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:22,790
Peter Attia fat and um,
you'll,

1390
01:00:22,791 --> 01:00:24,140
you're,
you're going to see a picture of me when

1391
01:00:24,141 --> 01:00:26,870
I was a swimmer because all this time we
were talking about me swimming.

1392
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:31,040
You're assuming like I'm a fit dude.
I was fit but fat dude,

1393
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,020
fitbit,
fat fit but totally fat.

1394
01:00:33,350 --> 01:00:34,940
And this is what you eating.
Oh,

1395
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:36,500
nonstop carbs.
But they're there.

1396
01:00:36,501 --> 01:00:37,910
I am.
See on the left there,

1397
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,870
well I wouldn't say you're fat.
I would say you got got a little paunch

1398
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:42,860
anya.
I Dunno.

1399
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:43,281
Wait,
wait,

1400
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:44,470
there's another picture,
uh,

1401
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,400
after I swim across Lake Tahoe,
go to that.

1402
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,560
That one right there.
Yeah,

1403
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:51,450
go gut there fella.

1404
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,450
I Dunno.
It's like you boozing it up,

1405
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,370
but it's also the way you're sitting
down.

1406
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,640
Stood up,
sucked it in for a picture on instagram.

1407
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:00,230
Might look okay.
I don't know.

1408
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,720
I was definitely,
you know,

1409
01:01:02,721 --> 01:01:05,060
probably what?
Maybe 30 pounds heavier.

1410
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:05,761
Wow.
But,

1411
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:06,351
but,
but you know,

1412
01:01:06,351 --> 01:01:08,600
body fat was much greater and what were
you eating?

1413
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,910
Oh,
I mean I probably went through three or

1414
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:15,470
four bottles of power,
a two day training all day and you know

1415
01:01:15,530 --> 01:01:20,530
every postworkout was a carvery feed and
so you're in sort of this vicious

1416
01:01:20,541 --> 01:01:24,820
glycogen dependent state people that
it's,

1417
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:28,520
it's crazy that there's so many folks
out there that are living their life

1418
01:01:28,521 --> 01:01:31,310
that don't even understand that this is
a process they're going through.

1419
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,640
They just think this is eating and
exercise.

1420
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:38,780
This is what happens,
but it's not your body lit.

1421
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,090
If you shot,
cut that off,

1422
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:45,230
push it away,
enter into a completely different food

1423
01:01:45,231 --> 01:01:45,800
source.

1424
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,260
Just change the way you,
you eat,

1425
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:53,390
your body will change and that that just
that concept that people,

1426
01:01:53,391 --> 01:01:55,280
that sounds like horseshit it sounds
like,

1427
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:58,380
what are you saying you you're what are
you offering some miracle cure your

1428
01:01:58,410 --> 01:01:59,210
already?
No,

1429
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:04,130
I'm saying you will change the dimension
of life that you operate in.

1430
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,830
It will change because you won't be the
same person.

1431
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,580
You won't like who you are is dependent
upon a lot of things.

1432
01:02:10,581 --> 01:02:13,310
But one of them is how much energy you
have and how you feel,

1433
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,250
whether you're crashing,
if you change the way you eat,

1434
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:19,010
you change the energy you have,
you changed the,

1435
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,003
you feel

1436
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,560
it'll change.
Your behavior will change your choices,

1437
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,950
it'll change your ambitions,
it'll change your potential.

1438
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:28,920
I mean,
there's so many things that will change.

1439
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,630
But there's an interesting question
which I've,

1440
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:31,464
I've,
I,

1441
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:35,670
I spend some time thinking about and
I've sort of accepted the fact that we

1442
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:38,580
might not know the answer,
which is when I was growing up,

1443
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:42,390
I was exercising like crazy.
Not as much as I was when I was

1444
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,670
swimming,
but I mean,

1445
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:45,330
sorry,
more than I was when I was swimming,

1446
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,800
but I ate like I had the world's worst
diet growing up,

1447
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:53,870
so I would eat breakfast was a bowl of,
um,

1448
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,370
like a box of cereal.
So I'd take like one of these tupperware

1449
01:02:56,371 --> 01:02:58,230
bowls.
It was this big and fill it with a full

1450
01:02:58,231 --> 01:02:59,910
box.
So each day I would have just a box of

1451
01:02:59,911 --> 01:03:01,590
cocoa puffs or whatever.
I would start the day.

1452
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:07,490
And then lunch was a full loaf of bread,
which would seven sandwiches plus a

1453
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:10,570
plate of fries,
plus a big tub of like,

1454
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,120
like a two liter jug of orange juice.
But I was training six hours a day,

1455
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,021
right?
So I would,

1456
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:18,900
you know,
run 10 miles in the morning in the gym,

1457
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:20,700
you know,
boxing like it was,

1458
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:21,840
you know,
you know what that shit is like.

1459
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,210
I mean,
it's ridiculously energy expending.

1460
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:28,200
But the point is,
I had a hard time holding my weight and

1461
01:03:28,201 --> 01:03:33,201
I was a middleweight one 60 walked
around at one 58 who walks around below

1462
01:03:33,451 --> 01:03:35,550
their fight weight.
So,

1463
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,070
you know,
my waist was 28 inches.

1464
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:40,020
I was probably four and a half percent
body fat.

1465
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:44,010
And I was eating anything and everything
you could put in front of me.

1466
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:49,230
And then something happened in medical
school where that shit just stopped and

1467
01:03:49,231 --> 01:03:51,570
I wasn't even eating as badly at the
time.

1468
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:55,350
But all of a sudden the metabolic
adaptation just vanished.

1469
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,290
And you know,
I mean,

1470
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,930
I wish someone had,
could study this,

1471
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:04,530
meaning you would have to take a group
of individuals and do muscle and fat

1472
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:07,500
biopsies over their course of their
life,

1473
01:04:07,770 --> 01:04:10,470
or at least during this window when we
think this is happening.

1474
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:13,980
And I think for many of my patients or
just even friends,

1475
01:04:13,981 --> 01:04:17,130
like it seems that this happens kind of
in your thirties if you're a guy,

1476
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:18,560
uh,
for women,

1477
01:04:18,561 --> 01:04:19,394
uh,
it's,

1478
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:22,980
it's harder for me to tell because I
think pregnancy can interfere with this.

1479
01:04:23,370 --> 01:04:25,500
Um,
so sometimes we get a bit of a skew to

1480
01:04:25,501 --> 01:04:28,290
answer,
but if I had to hypothesize,

1481
01:04:28,291 --> 01:04:33,291
I think that we go from having a lot of
lipid protein lipase on muscle cells and

1482
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:39,291
not much on fat cells to the reverse.
So when I was 16 and invincible,

1483
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:44,900
my muscles had a lot of this enzyme lpl
on it that could just absolutely take

1484
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:51,210
whatever I was throwing at them and turn
it into energy for the muscle.

1485
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,880
Whereas when that lpl exists on a fat
cell,

1486
01:04:53,881 --> 01:04:55,440
you're basically just going to store
more fat.

1487
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:58,710
And now why that would happen over time?
I mean,

1488
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:02,280
we could guess reasons,
but I'd love to know if that's the case

1489
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,060
because I still can't really figure out
like why is it today?

1490
01:05:06,061 --> 01:05:10,410
I am so carbohydrate sensitive.
When there was a day when I could eat,

1491
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,110
you know,
I was probably eating seven or 8,000

1492
01:05:13,111 --> 01:05:16,710
calories a day of which 80%,
we're probably carbohydrates.

1493
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,990
When I was growing up and was lean and
mean.

1494
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:22,630
Did you experience a crash at all and
the like post,

1495
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:24,610
afternoon crash,
post lunch crash?

1496
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:27,010
It's a good question.
Back then,

1497
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,430
I don't think I did that much back in
the day.

1498
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,730
Which would also speak to the idea of
better fuel partitioning,

1499
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,000
fuel partitioning,
meaning that sort of technical term for

1500
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:40,300
where your body knows to go to access
energy.

1501
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:41,770
You know,
are you going to glycogen,

1502
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:43,960
are you going into the fat?
Um,

1503
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:45,790
and then where are you storing energy?
So I,

1504
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,970
so I suspect I was just better at fuel
partitioning as a kid,

1505
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,650
which I'm sure most of us were.
Um,

1506
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,440
anyway,
it's kind of,

1507
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:56,350
of course the real question.
And the reason we care about this as

1508
01:05:56,351 --> 01:05:57,820
like what could you do about it,
right?

1509
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,890
Like what,
you know,

1510
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:01,630
for example,
like that's probably one of the reasons

1511
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:03,640
why testosterone as,
as,

1512
01:06:03,641 --> 01:06:06,190
as testosterone goes down,
you're going to get fatter,

1513
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,830
all things equal.
And part of the reason is testosterone,

1514
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:11,620
upregulates,
lpl and hormone sensitive lipase and all

1515
01:06:11,621 --> 01:06:15,730
of these other enzymes in the direction
of making you leaner versus fatter.

1516
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,980
So,
um,

1517
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:21,820
but that I,
I just don't think that that's enough of

1518
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:22,300
it.
You know,

1519
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,020
I think there's something else that's
going on that's triggering that decline.

1520
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,130
So for you at this 22 hour window of not
eating,

1521
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:35,320
what do you think the benefits are other
than your energy and slight spikes in

1522
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:38,890
nor epinephrin and some other hormones?
Well,

1523
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,380
I don't think there's sufficient
evidence at this point in time,

1524
01:06:41,381 --> 01:06:44,110
that time restricted feeding is going to
impact my longevity.

1525
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,950
So I think that's the big claim.
And it's the big claim this thing.

1526
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:48,611
What is the claim?
Like?

1527
01:06:48,611 --> 01:06:49,540
What are they saying?
Oh,

1528
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:52,690
I mean,
I think the claim would be that fasting

1529
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,640
mimicry,
which could be,

1530
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:56,320
you know,
like what,

1531
01:06:56,321 --> 01:07:00,910
say valter Longo talks about where you
do a five day hypo caloric diet of 750

1532
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:02,680
to a thousand calories a day for five
days,

1533
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:04,750
followed by 25 days of ad libitum
feeding,

1534
01:07:04,751 --> 01:07:07,000
meaning eat whatever the hell you want.
Um,

1535
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:09,340
uh,
in terms of total caloric content,

1536
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:11,200
um,
you know,

1537
01:07:11,201 --> 01:07:13,940
the claim is well that's going to
enhance longevity and,

1538
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:16,000
or you know,
doing a 16,

1539
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:18,070
eight or 18 six is going to enhance
lifespan.

1540
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,830
So just to take a step back,
um,

1541
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:25,660
I am only aware of,
uh,

1542
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:31,110
three things that have universally
extended lifespan across all model

1543
01:07:31,151 --> 01:07:32,890
organisms.
So if you think of like all,

1544
01:07:32,891 --> 01:07:36,310
you carry what's right,
if you go from yeast to worms to flies

1545
01:07:36,311 --> 01:07:39,550
to mammals,
the only things that uniformly extend

1546
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:40,810
life,
um,

1547
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:45,160
or almost uniformly is caloric
restriction and or dietary restriction.

1548
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:49,120
So total reduction in calories during
the lifetime and,

1549
01:07:49,121 --> 01:07:51,790
or reduction of certain subsets of those
calories.

1550
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,430
So there's a super famous experiment
that was done.

1551
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:56,800
Um,
actually if anyone's interested,

1552
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:58,780
I wrote about it.
It's on my blog somewhere,

1553
01:07:58,781 --> 01:08:01,450
but it's basically this,
the best experiment ever done in chloric

1554
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,990
restriction was between monkeys.
And there was a group at the NIH and a

1555
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,140
group at the University of Wisconsin and
it was like a 19 year experiment or

1556
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:11,020
something like that.
So you could really study the impact of

1557
01:08:11,021 --> 01:08:12,670
caloric restriction over these things.

1558
01:08:13,210 --> 01:08:16,160
And that experiment showed us that
caloric restriction,

1559
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:19,460
extended lifespan,
if you had a really shitty diet and it

1560
01:08:19,461 --> 01:08:22,220
did not extend lifespan if you had a
really good diet,

1561
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,580
counterintuitive,
but it also spoke to the idea that

1562
01:08:25,581 --> 01:08:27,950
dietary restriction probably matters.
So in other words,

1563
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:31,940
if you're eating a regular diet of
Mcdonald's every day,

1564
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:37,010
and then we put your counterpart eating
70% of Mcdonald's every day,

1565
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,890
that's going to move the needle.
But in the Wisconsin,

1566
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:40,480
uh,
and,

1567
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:42,020
and,
and the NIH experiment,

1568
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:44,660
when you took the monkeys that were
eating kind of,

1569
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,320
it wasn't their natural food,
but it was less horrible food.

1570
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:50,540
The caloric restriction did not extend
lifespan.

1571
01:08:51,290 --> 01:08:55,250
So that threw a wrench in everyone's
understanding of caloric restriction.

1572
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:58,490
And there are certain strains of mice
that also don't seem to be enhanced in

1573
01:08:58,491 --> 01:09:00,950
terms of lifespan,
meaning just time on,

1574
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:02,670
on earth.
Um,

1575
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:05,840
but for the most part nutrient
deprivation,

1576
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,420
um,
pretty ubiquitously extends life.

1577
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:14,110
The second thing that uniformly extends
life across this is a drug called

1578
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:17,210
rapamycin,
which is kind of like my favorite drug

1579
01:09:17,211 --> 01:09:19,580
in the whole world.
I mean meaning it's like I think it's

1580
01:09:19,581 --> 01:09:22,250
the most important drug in in terms of
this space,

1581
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:26,000
not necessarily because it's a drug that
will all be taking though I do believe

1582
01:09:26,001 --> 01:09:28,310
that is the case,
but more importantly because of what

1583
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:32,480
it's taught us about the nutrient
sensing pathway and its target,

1584
01:09:32,481 --> 01:09:36,460
which is this protein called Tor,
the target of Rapamycin or m torres,

1585
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,550
you probably heard of it as mechanistic
target of rapamycin and wrap a and

1586
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:43,610
inhibits that.
Now it's a bit complicated because

1587
01:09:43,611 --> 01:09:45,730
there's two variants of it.
There's something called [inaudible]

1588
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:50,150
complex one and mtor complex too.
And if you take rap in mice and day in

1589
01:09:50,151 --> 01:09:53,330
and day out every day,
which for example transplant patients

1590
01:09:53,331 --> 01:09:55,130
do,
it's an immune suppressant.

1591
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,500
That doesn't seem to really extend
lifespan.

1592
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:02,420
But if you take it in a pulsatile way,
you selectively get this m torque one

1593
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:05,720
inhibition without the m torque to
inhibition that seems to produce

1594
01:10:05,721 --> 01:10:07,730
longevity big time.
How does that work?

1595
01:10:07,731 --> 01:10:10,460
How would you take it selectively?
Well,

1596
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,980
um,
this is sort of one of my main clinical

1597
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:14,140
interests,
um,

1598
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:16,280
because I,
uh,

1599
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,880
obviously I'm waiting for the day when I
can start taking it and ultimately,

1600
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:21,860
you know,
feel that it's safe enough that I could

1601
01:10:21,861 --> 01:10:23,580
give it to patients.
Um,

1602
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:26,960
if I'm extrapolating from all of the
best data out there.

1603
01:10:26,961 --> 01:10:30,110
So that's looking at the work that's
come out of a guy named David Sabatini,

1604
01:10:30,111 --> 01:10:32,300
his lab.
David's a guy at mit,

1605
01:10:32,301 --> 01:10:34,610
he's a professor.
He's actually the guy that when he was a

1606
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:38,960
medical student,
I'm doing his phd in 1994 actually

1607
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:41,930
discovered how wrap a mice and works in
mammals.

1608
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:45,320
He's actually the guy that coined
mechanistic target of Rapamycin,

1609
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:49,700
mtor work as a name.
And so now whatever we are almost 25

1610
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:51,320
years later,
um,

1611
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,510
you know,
he's still running the powerhouse lab

1612
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:55,700
that understands it.
So if you look at all of the literature

1613
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:59,610
that's coming out of their lab,
coupled with a guy named Matt K,

1614
01:10:59,611 --> 01:11:03,020
Berlin at the University of Washington
who's doing rap and mice and studies in

1615
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:08,021
dogs along with the work done by someone
named Joan Manic who was at the time at

1616
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:12,920
Novartis has now at a company called
restore bio and a few other people.

1617
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,510
My intuition is that somewhere between
two to six milligrams every five to

1618
01:11:18,511 --> 01:11:22,440
seven days is probably the sweet spot.
Um,

1619
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:25,950
but you know,
am I confident enough in that to say

1620
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,870
that we should all be taking it?
Not yet.

1621
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:32,040
There's a couple things that like,
I want to be able to measure before we

1622
01:11:32,041 --> 01:11:34,230
do that,
but um,

1623
01:11:35,370 --> 01:11:37,230
you know,
in the animal data,

1624
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,310
the stuff's remarkable.

1625
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:41,400
If you look at Matt k Berlin's dog data,
it's remarkable.

1626
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:42,840
Like,
what are they doing with it?

1627
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,070
Well,
so for you,

1628
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,240
you own a dog,
you know this,

1629
01:11:45,241 --> 01:11:45,721
right?
I mean,

1630
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:48,210
if you,
if you look at outside of euthanasia or

1631
01:11:48,211 --> 01:11:49,500
accidents,
how to dogs die,

1632
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,940
they basically die of cancer and heart
and,

1633
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:52,920
and,
and they get dilated cardiomyopathy.

1634
01:11:52,921 --> 01:11:54,840
So it's a different type of heart
disease in humans get,

1635
01:11:54,841 --> 01:11:57,540
they don't get atherosclerotic disease,
they get heart failure.

1636
01:11:57,990 --> 01:11:59,340
Their,
their hearts just get too too,

1637
01:11:59,341 --> 01:12:01,200
too big.
And their ejection fraction,

1638
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,990
which is the amount of blood,
the percentage of blood that leaves the

1639
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,310
ventricular chamber with every
contraction that is,

1640
01:12:06,311 --> 01:12:08,940
that number goes down.
Bad things happen.

1641
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:11,580
Now to put that in perspective,
you and I sitting here,

1642
01:12:11,830 --> 01:12:15,270
couple of normal fit dudes,
we probably have a resting ejection

1643
01:12:15,271 --> 01:12:20,271
fraction of 60% and if like we went out
there and like killed it and work out as

1644
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:24,480
hard as we could at peak,
we might get that up to 80 85% ejection

1645
01:12:24,481 --> 01:12:25,314
fraction.

1646
01:12:25,770 --> 01:12:30,770
So once the ejection fraction gets below
30% you know a person starts to become

1647
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:33,810
very symptomatic.
Well,

1648
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:38,160
Matt took these dogs that had low
ejection fractions to begin with and I

1649
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:41,910
forget what the exact number was,
but it might've been like below 40% are

1650
01:12:41,911 --> 01:12:46,911
below 30% put them on a rapid mice and
for 12 weeks and in just 12 weeks saw an

1651
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:52,620
absolute 10% improvements or not didn't.
That means that's not going from 30 to

1652
01:12:52,621 --> 01:12:55,560
33,
that's going from 30 to 40% f

1653
01:12:55,561 --> 01:12:57,230
improvement.
Um,

1654
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,600
in other words,
this is hard to measure an effect in 12

1655
01:13:00,601 --> 01:13:02,520
weeks of a drug.
Um,

1656
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,640
and certainly you're not gonna be able
to measure a longevity impact over that.

1657
01:13:05,641 --> 01:13:09,390
So much of the study that's being done
with this is looking at surrogate

1658
01:13:09,391 --> 01:13:12,930
markers that we assume would portend
longevity.

1659
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:15,840
So Matt's work focusing on,
um,

1660
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,300
the ejection fraction,
uh,

1661
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:20,730
mannix work was focused on immune
response,

1662
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,890
which again was,
so this was the turning point for me.

1663
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:27,890
This was like December of 2014 was like
when everything in my professional world

1664
01:13:29,131 --> 01:13:33,540
shifted in terms of my interest towards
like rapamycin is the thing I want to

1665
01:13:33,541 --> 01:13:37,110
know everything about.
Because when I was a surgical resident,

1666
01:13:37,111 --> 01:13:38,550
you know,
we used to give rapamycin out,

1667
01:13:38,551 --> 01:13:40,920
like it was cotton candy to all the
transplant patients.

1668
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:45,450
It was an amazing drug that
revolutionized transplant physiology

1669
01:13:45,810 --> 01:13:49,500
because it had far fewer side effects
than massive doses of prednisone and

1670
01:13:49,501 --> 01:13:51,030
things that we used to have to give
patients.

1671
01:13:51,031 --> 01:13:53,640
Now you could give them much less
prednisone and you could give them

1672
01:13:53,641 --> 01:13:57,390
rapamycin or cousins of mice and like fk
five Oh six

1673
01:13:57,620 --> 01:14:00,470
and what you're doing with that stuff as
you're suppressing the immune system so

1674
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,270
the body doesn't reject the organ.
Exactly.

1675
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,270
Now when you do that,
does that leave them to south double to

1676
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,310
illness or disease?
Would that be the case with wrap on

1677
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:10,580
minds in person taking him for
longevity?

1678
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:11,980
That's the dollar question.

1679
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:15,850
And so I think in two,
so in a moment I want,

1680
01:14:15,851 --> 01:14:17,030
I'll,
I'll tell you the story of how wrapping

1681
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,720
mice and came to be because I think it's
the most interesting story in biology

1682
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:24,721
certainly in the last 25 30 years.
But when it was approved in 1999 by the

1683
01:14:25,541 --> 01:14:27,580
FDA,
it was for this indication,

1684
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:32,581
it was an immune suppressant.
It was 10 years before anybody figured

1685
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:33,790
out that,
oh wait,

1686
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:36,490
this could also extend life.
And they're in,

1687
01:14:36,491 --> 01:14:40,570
you had this paradox which was waiting.
How can an immune suppressant extend

1688
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:42,220
life?
I mean everybody acknowledges that

1689
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:44,460
immunity is a court,
you know,

1690
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:49,590
element of health.
And so in December of 2014 I feel like

1691
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:53,170
it was like almost Christmas Day.
I remember thinking this is like the

1692
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:55,300
best president I've ever got.
Um,

1693
01:14:55,390 --> 01:15:00,390
mannix group published this paper,
which they did in a group of about 320 a

1694
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:03,640
65 year olds ish.

1695
01:15:03,910 --> 01:15:06,850
So they put them into four groups.
There's a placebo group,

1696
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:10,270
there was a group that got,
and it wasn't actually wrapping mice and

1697
01:15:10,271 --> 01:15:11,620
it was ever,
ever alignments,

1698
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:13,780
which is an analog of rep mice.
It's basically the same drug.

1699
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,600
So there's a group that got one
milligram every single day,

1700
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:20,320
five milligrams once a week,
20 milligrams once a week.

1701
01:15:21,070 --> 01:15:24,760
They did this for something like eight
to 12 weeks and then they washed out,

1702
01:15:24,761 --> 01:15:27,850
meaning they got nothing for eight to 12
weeks and then they were hit with a flu

1703
01:15:27,851 --> 01:15:31,030
vaccine.
And then the scientists measured the

1704
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:34,390
immune response doing these really
complicated as where you look at t cell

1705
01:15:34,391 --> 01:15:38,050
function.
So relative to the placebo,

1706
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,320
paradoxically all groups.
And I said paradoxically,

1707
01:15:41,321 --> 01:15:45,370
because even the group that got one
milligram once a day all saw an increase

1708
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:46,780
in immunity,
which is a good thing.

1709
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:51,340
But the five and 20 group saw an even
bigger response.

1710
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,890
The people who just got five once a week
or 20 once a week.

1711
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:57,460
So on even bigger response.
But the group that took 20 once a week

1712
01:15:57,461 --> 01:16:00,450
had more side effects.
And the biggest side effect of rap and

1713
01:16:00,451 --> 01:16:04,420
mice and acutely as these awful,
awful mouth sores called aptos ulcers.

1714
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,610
They're nasty,
they're brutal.

1715
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,400
Um,
I used to get them all the time just

1716
01:16:09,401 --> 01:16:11,530
from I think sleep deprivation,
uh,

1717
01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:12,281
or any,
you know,

1718
01:16:12,281 --> 01:16:13,750
something that was weakening my immune
system.

1719
01:16:13,751 --> 01:16:16,710
So it's an internal source,
not,

1720
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:19,400
and not like a cold sores,
canker.

1721
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:21,730
So it's a,
it's a really nasty type of canker sore.

1722
01:16:21,731 --> 01:16:22,990
Yeah.
So,

1723
01:16:23,500 --> 01:16:24,590
um,
I want,

1724
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:29,200
once I had one so bad that I was like,
this is when I was in residency and I

1725
01:16:29,201 --> 01:16:30,610
was like,
it was just driving me nuts.

1726
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:32,740
So I went to the or and I got a bunch of
Lidacain,

1727
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:34,000
which is a local anesthetic.

1728
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:37,690
And I went into the call room and I just
grabbed my tongue and just injected like

1729
01:16:37,691 --> 01:16:39,670
Lidocaine in it.
And just when I did that,

1730
01:16:39,671 --> 01:16:42,610
somebody walked in and I've got like
blood dripping down from my mouth and

1731
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,230
I've got a needle in my mouth.
And they're like,

1732
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:45,281
and I'm like,
no,

1733
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:45,401
no,
no,

1734
01:16:45,401 --> 01:16:46,211
no.
It's not what you think.

1735
01:16:46,211 --> 01:16:49,340
It's not what you think.
I swear it's Lidacain.

1736
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:50,020
They're like,
ah,

1737
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:51,550
dude.
Ah,

1738
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:52,810
we,
I got you in to help.

1739
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,810
You know,
we were support groups for people.

1740
01:16:55,811 --> 01:16:57,820
Like you lie to Keynes.
Disgusting.

1741
01:16:57,821 --> 01:17:01,390
I had my,
a deviated septum fixed and they shoved

1742
01:17:01,391 --> 01:17:02,590
the lidacain up there.
You know,

1743
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,130
it's,
it's,

1744
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,970
it's hard stuff.
And the rest of the day I just felt like

1745
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:10,370
shaky and just weird.
And then I realized,

1746
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,480
oh,
this is like a,

1747
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,510
almost like a cocaine type thing.
Like,

1748
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:17,480
do you know why we have wida cane
because of cocaine or,

1749
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:19,460
yeah,
it's a guy named William Stewart Hall

1750
01:17:19,461 --> 01:17:21,080
stead who was,
uh,

1751
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:23,540
so near and dear to my heart because he
was the original,

1752
01:17:23,541 --> 01:17:27,800
he was the founding surgeon at Johns
Hopkins and one of the original four

1753
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,250
horsemen.

1754
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,240
So the four main physicians that
basically have shaped medicine in this

1755
01:17:32,241 --> 01:17:35,180
country all started out at Hopkins.
Uh Oh,

1756
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:38,510
slur in medicine,
Hopkins in surgery and two other guys,

1757
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,860
Walsh.
And I'm blanking on the,

1758
01:17:39,861 --> 01:17:42,230
Kelly was the third one.
Um,

1759
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:46,940
and he basically figured out,
cause you gotta remember like there was

1760
01:17:46,941 --> 01:17:50,660
a day when surgery was staggeringly
barbaric.

1761
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:55,520
Like prior to ether surgery was like,
all right,

1762
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,070
can you hold them down?
Like gag him,

1763
01:17:58,100 --> 01:18:00,740
get him drunk,
gag him and like we're gonna do our

1764
01:18:00,741 --> 01:18:03,530
thing.
It's crazy.

1765
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:06,950
So God,
I used to know all of this shit.

1766
01:18:06,951 --> 01:18:08,810
I don't remember any of the exact dates
anymore,

1767
01:18:08,811 --> 01:18:13,811
but it was like kind of like mid 18
hundreds to late 18 hundreds when up at

1768
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:18,110
Massachusetts General Hospital.
I forget the name of who it was,

1769
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,670
but someone basically came up with
ether.

1770
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:21,920
So ether became the first form of
anesthetic.

1771
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:24,170
But you know,
you were sort of knocking people out.

1772
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:24,710
Well,
it was,

1773
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:26,360
you know,
fast forward probably 20,

1774
01:18:26,361 --> 01:18:30,650
30 years when Halstad figured out that
this thing called cocaine could provide

1775
01:18:30,651 --> 01:18:33,830
local anesthetic.
So he began experimenting with like

1776
01:18:33,831 --> 01:18:37,460
crazy and of course in the process
became patently addicted to it.

1777
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:42,880
So you have this entire generation of
surgeons at Hopkins from that early era

1778
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,250
that were completely coke addicted,
so halstead and all of his first

1779
01:18:46,251 --> 01:18:48,300
generation of residents.
Um,

1780
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,890
and then of course from that we got
lidacain be pivot cane,

1781
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,280
all of these things that don't have the
same properties.

1782
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:58,450
But to this day,
cocaine is still used and,

1783
01:18:58,451 --> 01:19:01,340
and most people don't realize it,
but cocaine's a schedule two drug

1784
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,410
meaning it actually has a medical
application.

1785
01:19:03,411 --> 01:19:05,960
I'm like heroin,
which is scheduled one and the dea and

1786
01:19:05,961 --> 01:19:07,400
marijuana.
That's right.

1787
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:08,630
But,
um,

1788
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:12,080
the cocaine is schedule two and it is
still used in some ent surgery,

1789
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:14,900
um,
because it has some favorable properties

1790
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:17,360
over even lidocaine and Bupivacaine for
nasal surgery.

1791
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:21,620
Did you know that they still use cocoa
leaves for flavor and Coca Cola?

1792
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,540
They actually extract the cocaine from
it.

1793
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:26,460
Use the coca leaves and the cocaine goes
to medical for,

1794
01:19:26,690 --> 01:19:29,690
I didn't know that.
I had cocoa tea for my first time,

1795
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:30,680
uh,
this summer.

1796
01:19:30,681 --> 01:19:34,460
Like real Kokoda Latte,
but like brought up from my coco.

1797
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:35,800
That's what it is.
Oh yeah.

1798
01:19:35,801 --> 01:19:38,120
It's great.
I could not get enough of that stuff.

1799
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:41,780
You can't shut the fuck up on it though.
That's a weird sort of high.

1800
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:45,350
It's a very strange thing.
It's very talkative sort of high.

1801
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,700
I thought it was just everything about
it was like just for Cheetah leaves.

1802
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:50,570
You ever done that?
Like in Peru or no?

1803
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:51,620
No,
I've never done it either,

1804
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,900
but apparently it's really interesting
like the,

1805
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:57,620
it's like a coffee sort of a thing and
it's got flavonoids.

1806
01:19:57,621 --> 01:19:59,000
It's actually,
yeah,

1807
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:00,950
it's actually probably healthy for you.

1808
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:06,580
I just love plants in general.
We think of the coca leaves as producing

1809
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,360
cocaine we think of as inherently
negative.

1810
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:13,350
But the leaf itself,
like if you just don't extract it,

1811
01:20:13,590 --> 01:20:15,280
it's actually really good for you.
Well that's the thing.

1812
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:17,700
I mean I and that you know,
even like thinking about the difference

1813
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:22,230
between eating fruit versus eating Oreos
for sugar.

1814
01:20:22,270 --> 01:20:25,590
Yeah.
Like nature's pretty good at regulating

1815
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:28,560
how fast this stuff.
So in the case of fruit,

1816
01:20:28,561 --> 01:20:31,170
like how quickly does fructose hit your
liver?

1817
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:33,600
There's a sort of governor built into
it.

1818
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:37,050
If you're eating raspberries,
like could you get nonalcoholic fatty

1819
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:38,730
liver disease from eating enough
raspberries?

1820
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:39,720
Yeah,
probably.

1821
01:20:39,721 --> 01:20:43,320
But it's like go crazy.
You needed to become a full time job.

1822
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:46,560
Or you could just drink a giant gallon
of orange juice every day.

1823
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,050
If that would do it,
just do it.

1824
01:20:48,130 --> 01:20:51,960
There was a lot quicker because most
people think of fresh squeezed orange

1825
01:20:51,961 --> 01:20:52,950
juice as being,
oh,

1826
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:54,030
you're eating healthy.

1827
01:20:54,130 --> 01:20:55,650
Yeah.
Look at you over there with your fresh

1828
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:57,870
squeezed on your juicing as totally
healthy,

1829
01:20:57,871 --> 01:21:01,230
super healthy.
Meanwhile you're just drinking a big old

1830
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:03,060
glass of sugar.
You literally,

1831
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:05,310
your body doesn't know the difference
between that and a Coke Cola.

1832
01:21:06,210 --> 01:21:08,270
Very little difference between the two.
Unfortunately,

1833
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:10,620
Cole's got some other stuff in there,
caffeine.

1834
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:13,020
But other than that,
just the sugar itself.

1835
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:14,430
Yeah.
Your liver would have a hard time

1836
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:16,710
telling the difference.
So crazy.

1837
01:21:17,130 --> 01:21:21,330
Most people would think a glass of
orange juice at breakfast as a healthy

1838
01:21:21,331 --> 01:21:22,650
choice.
Yeah.

1839
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,320
Glass of champagne from mountain dew.
Yeah.

1840
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,470
It might be better.
Might get more shit done.

1841
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:31,020
Yeah.
So this a,

1842
01:21:31,021 --> 01:21:35,070
the dosage of one five and then 20.
So,

1843
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:36,840
so that,
that study,

1844
01:21:36,910 --> 01:21:38,880
I remember reading that and thinking,
okay,

1845
01:21:38,970 --> 01:21:40,530
if it's,
if you looked at that study,

1846
01:21:40,531 --> 01:21:42,510
you realize if you're going to be in the
placebo,

1847
01:21:42,511 --> 01:21:45,030
the one a day,
the five once a week or the 20 once a

1848
01:21:45,031 --> 01:21:47,190
week,
the five once a week was the way to go.

1849
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:48,750
And cause you got sweet spot.
That's right.

1850
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:53,190
You got all the benefit of 20 more
benefit than one and the fewest side

1851
01:21:53,191 --> 01:21:55,470
effects.
And how long has this study,

1852
01:21:55,620 --> 01:22:00,390
that was an eight week intervention with
an eight week wash out was enough to see

1853
01:22:00,391 --> 01:22:04,440
the enhanced immunity.
Do you think that a longer term study is

1854
01:22:04,441 --> 01:22:07,830
necessary to see like what the body
adapts?

1855
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:08,940
Yeah,
absolutely.

1856
01:22:08,941 --> 01:22:10,680
I mean all this stuff is in its infancy
now.

1857
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:12,540
My,
my shtick is,

1858
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:14,460
um,
so,

1859
01:22:14,461 --> 01:22:16,380
so right now wrapping my son's off
patent,

1860
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,020
right?
So the drug was approved in [inaudible]

1861
01:22:18,021 --> 01:22:21,480
99 by the FDA.
But this is after an unbelievable,

1862
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,420
amazing story of like how,
you know,

1863
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:27,120
this drug almost got lost forever.
Like,

1864
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:28,080
uh,
you know,

1865
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,380
so,
so there is no economic incentive for a

1866
01:22:31,381 --> 01:22:32,430
company to,
you know,

1867
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,840
figure out how to do this thing with
rapamycin.

1868
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,020
Um,
and even ever alignments.

1869
01:22:37,020 --> 01:22:40,590
I think ultimately Novartis,
and I'm saying this with no actual

1870
01:22:40,591 --> 01:22:42,330
knowledge other than just my own
speculation,

1871
01:22:42,331 --> 01:22:44,520
but I suspect Novartis was like,
well,

1872
01:22:44,730 --> 01:22:46,560
you know,
we're not going to play this game just

1873
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,260
with ever alignments.
And that's I think why it probably spun

1874
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:51,830
into this other company,
a restore bio to,

1875
01:22:51,860 --> 01:22:55,050
to sort of combine it with other agents.
Um,

1876
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:58,440
but at,
at an n of one level,

1877
01:22:58,441 --> 01:23:01,860
what I'm kind of interested in doing is,
um,

1878
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,560
you know,
using myself as a Guinea pig to start to

1879
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:09,010
measure the benefits of it.
Because my hypothesis is three things

1880
01:23:09,011 --> 01:23:13,090
have to be true if rapamycin is working.
And I could be wrong,

1881
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,520
but,
but this is my hypothesis and this is

1882
01:23:15,521 --> 01:23:16,480
what I test with,
with,

1883
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:19,870
with,
with other scientists is if you were

1884
01:23:19,871 --> 01:23:21,880
taking ramp in mice in at the right
dose,

1885
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:23,980
um,
so assume you're not getting all the

1886
01:23:23,981 --> 01:23:26,080
nasty side effects,
you're not getting the mouth sores and

1887
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:26,710
stuff like that.

1888
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,690
Three things have to get better.
One,

1889
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:33,040
your glucose metabolism should at least
get no worse but potentially better.

1890
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,560
I suspect it's a function of where you
start.

1891
01:23:35,860 --> 01:23:40,150
So there is one doctor in New York who
has like a rap on mice and practice.

1892
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:43,750
I think he's in there,
he's in the bronx actually.

1893
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:47,410
And I've talked to him a bunch.
And when he,

1894
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,420
when he started at himself,
he said like the improvements were

1895
01:23:52,421 --> 01:23:54,700
remarkable just in terms of glucose
metabolism,

1896
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,890
but I think he was starting at a pretty
bad spot.

1897
01:23:56,891 --> 01:23:58,570
But if maybe you are,
I took it,

1898
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:02,200
we might not notice much getting better,
but we definitely should not get worse.

1899
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:06,040
So that's easy to measure clinically do
as an oral glucose tolerance test would

1900
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:10,030
give you that answer.
But two things should get significantly

1901
01:24:10,031 --> 01:24:12,070
better.
The first is immune function should get

1902
01:24:12,071 --> 01:24:13,360
better.
Not Worse.

1903
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:16,030
There is no clinical way to measure
that,

1904
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,780
but we do know how to measure it.
I mean when I was doing my post doc,

1905
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:23,290
it was in an immunology lab.
Like I know how to do that as say I just

1906
01:24:23,291 --> 01:24:26,410
don't have like $1 million worth of
equipment to measure it.

1907
01:24:26,440 --> 01:24:30,430
What is the difference in the dosage
even in the high end at 20 versus what

1908
01:24:30,431 --> 01:24:33,040
you would give someone if they got a
kidney transplant?

1909
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:35,410
Yeah,
typical transplant dose would have been

1910
01:24:35,411 --> 01:24:37,810
like two,
three milligrams every day.

1911
01:24:38,530 --> 01:24:40,630
Okay.
So it's quite a bit different.

1912
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:44,560
It is and it's different on two levels
because you know when you're giving it

1913
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:48,010
every day at a lower dose,
you stint still end up producing tissue

1914
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:52,030
levels that might even be comparable to
where that person was getting with the

1915
01:24:52,031 --> 01:24:56,050
spike of 20 and in general,
this isn't always true,

1916
01:24:56,051 --> 01:25:00,220
but in general in pharmacology side
effects are the result of certain side

1917
01:25:00,221 --> 01:25:03,400
effects are the result of the nadir dose
and certain side effects of the result

1918
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:04,270
of the peak dose.

1919
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,580
So with every drug,
you kind of have to understand this a

1920
01:25:06,581 --> 01:25:08,850
little bit.
But going back to this rap at mycenae

1921
01:25:08,860 --> 01:25:11,680
thing and the third thing that has to be
true in my opinion,

1922
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,740
it could be full of shit,
but I think the third thing that has to

1923
01:25:14,741 --> 01:25:17,770
be true if you're taking the right dose
is you need to see an uptick in

1924
01:25:17,771 --> 01:25:20,530
autophagy.
And um,

1925
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:23,350
so just as if you,
does that mean a toffee is this process

1926
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,080
where the body,
the cells start eating themselves.

1927
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:29,020
So it's kind of like a programmed cell
death,

1928
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:32,290
although technically we reserve that
term for something called apoptosis.

1929
01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:34,840
But when you're fasting,
what's,

1930
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:37,480
why would fasting produce a benefit?
I mean,

1931
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:41,500
I think the most logical explanation is
enhanced the toffee g.

1932
01:25:41,650 --> 01:25:45,670
So the body basically has to prioritize
in the absence of nutrients,

1933
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:50,380
the underperforming cells are basically
told each herself and you know,

1934
01:25:50,381 --> 01:25:51,970
we can recycle some of your components.

1935
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:55,540
Maybe this mitochondria is worth saving.
This golgi apparatus is worth saving.

1936
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:59,200
And then we selectively,
when we refeed repopulate the better

1937
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:01,780
cells.
And in many ways I think wrap mice and

1938
01:26:01,781 --> 01:26:05,690
can do that in a pill.
So the problem is we don't have a blood

1939
01:26:05,691 --> 01:26:07,780
test to measure autophagy.
So in,

1940
01:26:07,781 --> 01:26:09,200
in the,
in the lab,

1941
01:26:09,201 --> 01:26:12,230
when you measure autophagy,
you need muscle biopsies or they

1942
01:26:12,231 --> 01:26:14,210
typically even just sacrifice the
animals.

1943
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:16,100
Um,
this has become a very hot area.

1944
01:26:16,101 --> 01:26:20,750
So the Nobel prize in medicine and
physiology was awarded for the genetic,

1945
01:26:21,070 --> 01:26:23,930
um,
basically the elucidation of the genetic

1946
01:26:23,931 --> 01:26:25,730
regulation of Autophagy in,
uh,

1947
01:26:26,410 --> 01:26:28,850
actually it's 2016 so it's very recent,
about a year and a half ago.

1948
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:30,560
This is what the Nobel prize was awarded
for.

1949
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,850
But what I'm hoping is that we can
develop a signature for autophagy with a

1950
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:38,720
blood test.
So I believe that you should be able to

1951
01:26:38,721 --> 01:26:43,721
look at someone's blood and look at all
of the metabolomics,

1952
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,480
all of the small molecules,
all of the proteome.

1953
01:26:47,780 --> 01:26:51,110
And there should be a signature.
It should look different from the way we

1954
01:26:51,111 --> 01:26:52,100
look when we're,
you know,

1955
01:26:52,101 --> 01:26:54,830
fast it or read a story fully fed.
Otherwise,

1956
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:57,620
would you just take a sample of the
muscle tissue,

1957
01:26:57,621 --> 01:26:59,420
like punch something out?
Yeah.

1958
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:00,320
And,
and I'm,

1959
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,240
I mean,
I'm willing to do at all and I probably

1960
01:27:02,241 --> 01:27:03,710
will,
we're just trying to get what's called

1961
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:07,220
an irb and institutional review board.
So to do these kinds of studies in

1962
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:09,980
humans,
even if I'm the only subject and it's

1963
01:27:09,981 --> 01:27:12,080
just like,
I don't care what you do to me type of

1964
01:27:12,081 --> 01:27:13,670
thing,
we still have to get an irb.

1965
01:27:13,671 --> 01:27:18,671
So we're working on getting an n of one
irb so that we can take muscle biopsies,

1966
01:27:19,611 --> 01:27:21,710
fat biopsies for me,
blood tests,

1967
01:27:21,711 --> 01:27:24,410
and then start to actually look for that
signature.

1968
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:28,480
Would it vary in where you got it from?
Like would you want your muscles yeah,

1969
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:29,720
more than one muscle group?

1970
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:31,430
It's a very good question.
I don't know the answer.

1971
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:32,750
Hmm.
Um,

1972
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,750
I probably have to talk to people who
have a lot of experience doing this with

1973
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:36,750
animals,
but it,

1974
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,650
it actually wouldn't surprise me.
Like if I were going to do it,

1975
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:44,680
I would just start in the legs because
the muscles in the legs tend to be the

1976
01:27:44,811 --> 01:27:46,550
harbinger of what's going on in the
body.

1977
01:27:46,551 --> 01:27:47,151
So,
for example,

1978
01:27:47,151 --> 01:27:51,170
one of the first signs of diabetes,
like a decade before you get diabetes.

1979
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:55,760
One thing that if you're actually doing
this kind of testing in people it you'll

1980
01:27:55,761 --> 01:27:57,920
notice glucose,
insulin resistance,

1981
01:27:57,921 --> 01:28:01,610
and the muscles of the legs.
So once the legs start to get insulin

1982
01:28:01,611 --> 01:28:04,160
resistant,
you're on a glide path to bad things

1983
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:07,880
happening.
I'm fascinated by legs first of all,

1984
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:12,140
from years of martial arts,
but also because over the last year or

1985
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:16,040
so I've been doing a lot of running and
it's one of the only muscle groups that

1986
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:17,360
I could work out every day.

1987
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:22,600
I can,
I can run hills every day and I'm not

1988
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:26,660
sore like that.
That's not even possible for any other

1989
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:27,471
group.
I mean,

1990
01:28:27,471 --> 01:28:31,730
I can kind of do that with boxing.
You can hit the bag and as far as like

1991
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:34,940
Ryan hills is essentially like
plyometrics,

1992
01:28:34,941 --> 01:28:39,140
like you're pushing your entire weight
up and then you're catching with the

1993
01:28:39,141 --> 01:28:41,990
other leg and pushing it up.
You can't do that with,

1994
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:44,780
you can't bench press every day.
You're fucking arms would fall off.

1995
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:47,450
I mean,
there's probably someone out there doing

1996
01:28:47,451 --> 01:28:48,470
it.
That's proven me wrong,

1997
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:51,320
but there's nothing like the amount of
endurance that you have in your life,

1998
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,020
but it can just be an adaptation that
you've had as well.

1999
01:28:54,021 --> 01:28:56,840
I mean,
when I was a competitive cyclist,

2000
01:28:57,860 --> 01:29:00,110
I mean there were definitely days when I
would,

2001
01:29:00,111 --> 01:29:03,090
especially when we did like multi day
events,

2002
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:06,720
like there were days when it's just like
you're beaten down.

2003
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:07,633
Yeah,
yeah.

2004
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,270
You're going to learn in the first 10
minutes.

2005
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:11,670
Like everybody else is riding together,
you're riding alone.

2006
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,720
The fatigue level though is
significantly different than it

2007
01:29:15,721 --> 01:29:18,660
different than it would be if you were
doing something with your arms every

2008
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:19,650
day.
It seems like your ability to,

2009
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:22,020
you can definitely recruit more.
That's probably part of it.

2010
01:29:22,330 --> 01:29:25,410
Like more tissue.
I think you have more options like you

2011
01:29:25,411 --> 01:29:25,950
can,
you know,

2012
01:29:25,950 --> 01:29:28,260
especially if you really have good
proprioception.

2013
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:30,060
But for example,
like if you're dead lifting,

2014
01:29:30,690 --> 01:29:32,700
you know,
I actually think,

2015
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:34,740
um,
if you,

2016
01:29:34,890 --> 01:29:36,030
so,
so you know how you have like the

2017
01:29:36,031 --> 01:29:37,860
positive and negative motion,
concentric,

2018
01:29:37,861 --> 01:29:41,790
eccentric motion of a weight.
If you're willing to do away with the

2019
01:29:41,791 --> 01:29:45,690
negative,
you can lift heavy every single day.

2020
01:29:45,691 --> 01:29:47,100
So there's this guy named Ryan.
Oh,

2021
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:49,580
unfreaking believable.
So you do,

2022
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,180
I've seen people doing that.
You know,

2023
01:29:51,181 --> 01:29:52,080
I saw that,
uh,

2024
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:55,620
Andre Galvao on his instagram the other
day was doing dead lifts and just

2025
01:29:55,621 --> 01:29:56,550
dropping the weight.

2026
01:29:56,550 --> 01:29:57,960
And I was like,
that seems weird to me.

2027
01:29:57,961 --> 01:30:00,330
So when I was a cyclist,
this was my training,

2028
01:30:00,720 --> 01:30:02,190
uh,
and it was all put together by this guy

2029
01:30:02,191 --> 01:30:04,500
named Ryan flarity who actually
introduced,

2030
01:30:04,501 --> 01:30:07,530
that was another one of my sight unseen
introductions to tim for a podcast.

2031
01:30:07,531 --> 01:30:09,600
It's a great podcast with Ryan flaherty
on,

2032
01:30:09,990 --> 01:30:12,510
and he's a,
I call him the guru of speed.

2033
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,570
He,
this is a guy who likes singlehandedly,

2034
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:17,880
I shouldn't say singlehandedly.
I mean he's on the shoulders of many

2035
01:30:17,881 --> 01:30:20,100
other people who have done great work,
but,

2036
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:22,620
but it has,
has really done an amazing job at

2037
01:30:22,621 --> 01:30:24,450
figuring out how to make people run
fast.

2038
01:30:25,290 --> 01:30:26,770
And,
um,

2039
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:29,910
it's a very long story and I mean,
he does such a great job on the podcast.

2040
01:30:29,911 --> 01:30:30,660
I won't go into it,
but,

2041
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:34,710
but for the purpose of this discussion,
one of our interest was,

2042
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:36,390
hey,
could we translate everything you've

2043
01:30:36,391 --> 01:30:38,610
learned about sprinting into cycling?

2044
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:41,910
And his biggest observation was the
following.

2045
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,390
If he took a hundred runners and lined
them up and new,

2046
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,330
like before they ran,
knew how,

2047
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,180
how hard they could hit a force plate
treadmill.

2048
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:53,850
He could predict the order in which
they'd finished the race.

2049
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,940
So force plate treadmill as its name
suggests a treadmill,

2050
01:30:57,060 --> 01:31:02,060
but it's a special treadmill where it
measures the force that you hit and that

2051
01:31:02,161 --> 01:31:04,740
the higher that number divided by your
bodyweight,

2052
01:31:04,770 --> 01:31:07,620
that became what he described as mass
specific force.

2053
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:11,400
That number,
if you rank order it is the order in

2054
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:15,600
which people would finish the run.
So it kind of makes sense if you think

2055
01:31:15,601 --> 01:31:15,991
about it,
right?

2056
01:31:15,991 --> 01:31:18,480
The harder you can hit the ground
relative to your own weight,

2057
01:31:18,481 --> 01:31:21,780
the higher you go and the higher you go,
the longer you traveled with each

2058
01:31:21,781 --> 01:31:25,620
stride.
So you saying bolt has the highest ever

2059
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,350
force plate measurement,
um,

2060
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:32,280
calculation and it's,
I forget what his ratio is.

2061
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:38,090
I want to say he's like 6.9 or seven
times more force than his body weight

2062
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:41,730
every time he hits,
if fricking staggering.

2063
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,710
Wow.
So then Ryan's,

2064
01:31:43,711 --> 01:31:45,750
once he figured all this stuff out,
his next question,

2065
01:31:45,751 --> 01:31:47,310
this is when he was working at USA
track.

2066
01:31:47,311 --> 01:31:49,200
His next question was,
could you train this?

2067
01:31:49,380 --> 01:31:50,970
In other words like,
okay,

2068
01:31:50,971 --> 01:31:55,971
if Joe runs a 4.9 40 and we want to get
that down to a four five can that be

2069
01:31:57,991 --> 01:32:00,310
done?
And it turned out the answer was

2070
01:32:00,311 --> 01:32:03,550
categorically yes.
You have to do two things.

2071
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:05,830
You have to get stronger and you have to
get lighter.

2072
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,470
So how do you do that?
And that's when he came up with this

2073
01:32:08,471 --> 01:32:12,250
idea of we do hex bar dead lifts,
we lift really heavy.

2074
01:32:12,251 --> 01:32:14,200
So you're only doing fives,
fours,

2075
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:16,630
threes or twos,
never more than five reps.

2076
01:32:16,930 --> 01:32:21,070
And so you'll do five sets every single
day and you'll pick it.

2077
01:32:21,070 --> 01:32:22,810
So some days it will be five sets of
three,

2078
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:24,910
some days it's five sets of five,
whatever it is.

2079
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:27,340
And you're off.
And they're very well prescribed.

2080
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:31,810
Like you know at what percentage of your
one rep Max you're doing these APP and

2081
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:34,270
it's up drop up,
drop up,

2082
01:32:34,271 --> 01:32:37,750
drop.
So you're never getting the Actin myosin

2083
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:41,620
filament to tear pass because that's
what happening in the negative is the

2084
01:32:41,621 --> 01:32:46,270
act and the act acting is coming off the
myosin and that is creating a micro tear

2085
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:47,950
in the muscle.
And that's what the muscle rebuilt.

2086
01:32:47,951 --> 01:32:50,260
That's why we get larger when we lift
weights.

2087
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:54,100
But when you drop it,
you unload the muscle when you're

2088
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,920
relaxing it.
So the is not going to get bigger.

2089
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,320
So you're getting all the benefits,
all the strength,

2090
01:32:59,321 --> 01:33:02,470
which is primarily around the type two b
muscle fiber,

2091
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:05,590
um,
and without the,

2092
01:33:05,591 --> 01:33:06,490
without the size.

2093
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,410
So anyway,
when,

2094
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,710
when I asked Brian,
hey,

2095
01:33:08,711 --> 01:33:10,630
could we do this in cycling,
we did this experiment,

2096
01:33:10,631 --> 01:33:12,310
which was,
he kind of came up with,

2097
01:33:12,311 --> 01:33:14,940
this was for me and two other guys who
were very good cyclists.

2098
01:33:14,941 --> 01:33:16,180
Like I was like,
I'm a popper.

2099
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:18,490
But these guys were like cat one,
cat,

2100
01:33:18,491 --> 01:33:22,060
two collegiate cyclers cyclists.
But they were like my training partners.

2101
01:33:22,390 --> 01:33:26,530
So we did this thing where we did the
same routine that he had the sprinters

2102
01:33:26,531 --> 01:33:27,850
doing.
And it's a bit more complicated than

2103
01:33:27,851 --> 01:33:32,620
I've described because you're also
juxtaposing the positive only with

2104
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:35,050
something called a post activation
potentiation,

2105
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:37,210
which you may have already experienced
this,

2106
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:40,570
but I don't know if you've ever tried to
do plyometrics after deadlifting,

2107
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:43,570
but it seems counterintuitive that you'd
be able to do more,

2108
01:33:43,571 --> 01:33:45,490
but you can really,
yeah,

2109
01:33:45,970 --> 01:33:49,510
it has to be a heavy dead lift and
attributes of numbers or no more in

2110
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:51,520
terms of distance,
like more in terms of vertical.

2111
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,960
So your highest,
um,

2112
01:33:54,430 --> 01:33:56,860
uh,
like plyometric jump is going to come

2113
01:33:56,861 --> 01:33:58,840
after you've done like,
you know,

2114
01:33:58,841 --> 01:34:01,620
three sets of three at,
you know,

2115
01:34:01,630 --> 01:34:05,940
95% of your one rep Max three sets of
three dropping or using essential.

2116
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:06,843
No,
definitely.

2117
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,103
Absolutely.
Yeah.

2118
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:10,450
Wow.
And so we would super set the

2119
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:14,350
plyometrics with the dead lifts and you
would do this every day.

2120
01:34:14,770 --> 01:34:17,020
And I'm so Ryan,
you know,

2121
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:19,570
he,
he runs a training camp where he has,

2122
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,540
um,
typically the top 10 college prospects

2123
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:24,910
every year just before the NFL combine
come down.

2124
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:28,300
And I mean the changes he makes in their
time,

2125
01:34:28,301 --> 01:34:30,790
like Johnny Menzel was one of them.
So obviously Johnny Menzel has

2126
01:34:30,791 --> 01:34:31,960
obviously,
you know,

2127
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:34,720
not panned out in the pros,
but most people kind of forget how good

2128
01:34:34,721 --> 01:34:37,960
an athlete he was.
And when he showed up to camp,

2129
01:34:38,500 --> 01:34:41,500
I forget what his time was,
but I want to say it was about,

2130
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:43,990
I don't know,
you could probably look this up for me.

2131
01:34:44,220 --> 01:34:48,310
You know,
it was three tenths slower than what he

2132
01:34:48,311 --> 01:34:49,990
ultimately ran at the combine.
And He,

2133
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:53,740
I think he had the fastest or second
fastest quarterback time at the combine

2134
01:34:53,950 --> 01:34:56,500
after just 12 weeks of doing this.
Wow.

2135
01:34:56,560 --> 01:34:58,460
I mean,
it was unbelievable

2136
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:02,330
how fast he can get these guys to run.
I saw something the other day that I'd

2137
01:35:02,331 --> 01:35:04,970
never seen before.
It's an East centric bike.

2138
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:07,010
It,
it changes back and forth.

2139
01:35:07,011 --> 01:35:09,050
Heard of this thing.
You're the second person to tell me

2140
01:35:09,051 --> 01:35:10,700
about this.
I think I saw it yesterday.

2141
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:12,350
In fact,
now that I think about it,

2142
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,670
it was east sensor can concentric,
but it,

2143
01:35:14,671 --> 01:35:16,070
it,
it alternates.

2144
01:35:16,100 --> 01:35:16,451
Yeah,
yeah,

2145
01:35:16,451 --> 01:35:17,630
yeah.
And it,

2146
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,110
it looked really weird.
It,

2147
01:35:19,111 --> 01:35:21,740
it,
it forces movement and you're resisting

2148
01:35:21,741 --> 01:35:23,720
the movement.
See if you can find that Jamie.

2149
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,300
It's like an East centric,
I forget what it's called,

2150
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:29,090
but uh,
like someone sent me this like,

2151
01:35:29,091 --> 01:35:30,260
Hey,
this thing is amazing.

2152
01:35:30,261 --> 01:35:31,190
I was like,
it's a bike.

2153
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:33,530
The fuck you talking about look
different than that.

2154
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:35,800
The one I saw was also different.
It looked,

2155
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,550
it was a wreck.
I think it was like a recumbent.

2156
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,720
Yeah.
Yeah.

2157
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:40,220
That's what I saw too.
Yeah.

2158
01:35:40,570 --> 01:35:41,750
He centric.
Yeah.

2159
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:43,750
You're spelling it wrong.
No,

2160
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:45,500
it was coming up though.
Oh,

2161
01:35:45,501 --> 01:35:47,060
it says just centric.
Oh,

2162
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:48,800
okay.
Huh.

2163
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:50,990
East centric exercise bike.
Try that.

2164
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:54,920
It,
but it's the thing is it,

2165
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:57,850
it alternated between east centric and
concent trick.

2166
01:35:57,851 --> 01:36:02,620
It wasn't just the one with the red and
the top row looks like it.

2167
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:05,680
What does that pediatric Er Aragon,
I don't know.

2168
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:07,570
It's on it.
It's for little kids.

2169
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:10,680
Well,
whatever.

2170
01:36:10,780 --> 01:36:12,610
I,
I wish I had saved it cause I was like,

2171
01:36:12,910 --> 01:36:15,270
I'm never buying this.
But you know,

2172
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,830
it just looked interesting.
It's just like,

2173
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:21,040
there's always these new methods of
stimulating the body and tricking it

2174
01:36:21,041 --> 01:36:22,450
into doing things.
And,

2175
01:36:22,451 --> 01:36:24,430
uh,
I guess that's essentially what a lot of

2176
01:36:24,431 --> 01:36:26,110
people,
the way a lot of people think of

2177
01:36:26,111 --> 01:36:28,420
intermittent fasting,
you're kind of stimulating the body.

2178
01:36:28,421 --> 01:36:29,860
You're hacking it,
tricking it.

2179
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:30,783
You know,

2180
01:36:31,170 --> 01:36:32,010
and I wonder,
you know,

2181
01:36:32,011 --> 01:36:36,210
one of the things that Ryan and I talked
about was could we ever adopt his

2182
01:36:36,211 --> 01:36:39,620
training system to swimming?
And in,

2183
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:42,900
in running and cycling,
it's primarily going to be quads,

2184
01:36:42,901 --> 01:36:45,060
Hams,
glutes have to be the muscles that do

2185
01:36:45,061 --> 01:36:46,660
it.
And in row things like,

2186
01:36:46,661 --> 01:36:47,940
what would you,
we were talking about like,

2187
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:50,190
you really got to be able to get the
lats fired,

2188
01:36:50,191 --> 01:36:53,220
but how do you get the last of fire at
such a weight?

2189
01:36:53,370 --> 01:36:56,220
And then without having to do the
negative as well.

2190
01:36:56,730 --> 01:36:59,100
So we just couldn't really kind of
figure out how to do it.

2191
01:36:59,150 --> 01:37:02,700
And they're,
so we adopted part of his technique to

2192
01:37:02,701 --> 01:37:05,460
swimming,
which was the actual training routine

2193
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,490
meaning.
So one of the big misconceptions,

2194
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:11,910
if you're trying to go fast is that you
need to still train slow.

2195
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:14,520
But the reality of it is like,
you know,

2196
01:37:14,550 --> 01:37:19,320
if you're trying to run a marathon at,
you know,

2197
01:37:19,321 --> 01:37:23,880
call it a pace of two 15 you know,
world class marathon runner,

2198
01:37:24,510 --> 01:37:27,720
there's not a lot of benefit to be
spending much time running at a pace

2199
01:37:27,721 --> 01:37:28,560
slower than that.

2200
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,060
If anything,
you want to be running slightly faster.

2201
01:37:30,061 --> 01:37:31,230
That,
so you know who meb is,

2202
01:37:31,231 --> 01:37:34,290
the American marathoner who won the
Boston marathon three years ago.

2203
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:37,420
No.
So amazing marathon or um,

2204
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:41,400
he's the,
I think he's the only person to have won

2205
01:37:41,401 --> 01:37:43,440
the New York Marathon,
the Boston Marathon,

2206
01:37:43,441 --> 01:37:45,450
and to have won an Olympic medal and
marathon.

2207
01:37:45,451 --> 01:37:48,360
He won a silver medal in the 2004 Athens
Games.

2208
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:52,920
But when he won the Boston Marathon,
he was like 38 years old,

2209
01:37:52,921 --> 01:37:56,190
which in marathon parlance is,
you might as well be a hundred.

2210
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:00,240
And he had not really had a great race
in the previous few years.

2211
01:38:00,241 --> 01:38:04,200
So he had been effectively written off
in the sport and Ryan actually helped

2212
01:38:04,201 --> 01:38:08,190
train them and all they did was apply
this principle of sprinting into

2213
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:10,690
marathon running,
which was all right matt,

2214
01:38:10,691 --> 01:38:14,490
if you want to win the Boston Marathon,
you need to be able to travel like four

2215
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:18,930
inches further with every step you take
taking the same number of steps at the

2216
01:38:18,931 --> 01:38:20,490
same cadence that you currently run.

2217
01:38:21,150 --> 01:38:22,110
And they,
you know,

2218
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:26,130
Ryan did the math and said that means
you're forced number has to go from

2219
01:38:26,131 --> 01:38:29,010
where it is now,
which I think was 1.7 meaning he could

2220
01:38:29,011 --> 01:38:31,350
only dead lift 1.7 times his body
weight.

2221
01:38:31,620 --> 01:38:33,720
You have to get that until like 2.6 or
something.

2222
01:38:34,260 --> 01:38:36,360
And so when meb train for the Boston
Marathon,

2223
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:41,220
he was focusing heavily on these dead
lifts and doing much shorter,

2224
01:38:41,221 --> 01:38:43,680
faster runs.
And you know,

2225
01:38:43,710 --> 01:38:47,490
I mean if you watch the video of his
Boston marathon when it's incredible,

2226
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,750
like you know,
he just takes off and like leaves

2227
01:38:51,751 --> 01:38:53,730
everybody behind him and they're like,
yeah,

2228
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:55,080
there's no way he'll be able to keep
that up.

2229
01:38:55,081 --> 01:38:56,820
We'll let them go.
And they couldn't write them in.

2230
01:38:57,240 --> 01:39:00,010
Wow.
Do you think that someone's going to

2231
01:39:00,011 --> 01:39:02,010
build a break too?
But that's the big,

2232
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:03,150
we were just talking about the other
day.

2233
01:39:03,151 --> 01:39:04,800
Some guy got really close.
What'd you say?

2234
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:06,900
He hit Jamie like two oh six or
something.

2235
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:08,810
I think someone's gone closer to the
nighttime.

2236
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:11,460
Then that guy in Germany last year go
even closer.

2237
01:39:11,461 --> 01:39:13,920
I think it was two oh two or something
along those lines.

2238
01:39:14,760 --> 01:39:17,220
And you think that this sort of method
is what they're using?

2239
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:21,150
So I don't know if I'm allowed to talk
to you about this stuff publicly.

2240
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,560
Um,
don't worry.

2241
01:39:22,561 --> 01:39:23,394
No one's listening.

2242
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:27,090
Um,
so,

2243
01:39:27,091 --> 01:39:29,520
so short answer is yes,
I think this can be done.

2244
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,760
Um,
everything has to be perfect,

2245
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:35,550
right?
Meaning you have to have the perfect

2246
01:39:35,551 --> 01:39:39,540
athlete trained to peak at the right
time.

2247
01:39:39,541 --> 01:39:41,910
You need the right humidity,
like everything has to fire on all

2248
01:39:41,911 --> 01:39:45,480
cylinders.
But just as there was nothing

2249
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:49,560
physiologically special about a four
minute mile when Roger bannister broke

2250
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:51,480
it,
it was more of a psychological barrier.

2251
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:53,640
Um,
you know,

2252
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:56,100
I'm not suggesting for a moment that
this will be easy,

2253
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:58,350
but you know,
we're going to get there.

2254
01:39:58,380 --> 01:40:01,440
I mean like this can happen.
That is incredible.

2255
01:40:01,441 --> 01:40:05,790
If you think about how fast you're
running to run 26 miles in two hours and

2256
01:40:05,791 --> 01:40:06,840
two minutes.
Staggering.

2257
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:08,880
I don't think people understand like
what?

2258
01:40:08,881 --> 01:40:13,050
Uh,
I mean I was never a great runner.

2259
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:16,140
I could,
I was about a two 50 marathon,

2260
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:19,680
two 55 marathon when I was a boxer,
but never trained as a runner.

2261
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,690
Like it was just,
I just ran so much and I was pretty

2262
01:40:21,691 --> 01:40:25,950
fast.
But like when I think about how hard I

2263
01:40:25,951 --> 01:40:30,780
would have to run to bust out a to 50 to
two 55 and to think like,

2264
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:33,990
was there any chance I could have ever
got that down to a two 30?

2265
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:39,840
It's a,
that is such an enormous change in pace.

2266
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,510
It's,
it's,

2267
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:43,080
I,
I don't know that I ever could have done

2268
01:40:43,081 --> 01:40:45,270
that regardless of all the training
tricks in the world.

2269
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,100
And what kind of diet of those guys
following?

2270
01:40:48,330 --> 01:40:51,000
Well,
I know personally I can't speak to what

2271
01:40:51,001 --> 01:40:53,740
the other guys do,
but I think a lot of those guys are in

2272
01:40:53,741 --> 01:40:56,890
the state of where I was when they were
younger.

2273
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,410
Meaning like I,
they can probably get away with a lot

2274
01:40:59,411 --> 01:41:00,520
more.
Um,

2275
01:41:00,580 --> 01:41:03,070
if you look at the physiques,
if most of these guys,

2276
01:41:03,071 --> 01:41:06,010
they're,
they're perfectly built,

2277
01:41:06,011 --> 01:41:08,500
like I'm talking to elite level,
I'm talking about like anyone who runs a

2278
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:08,800
marathon.

2279
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:10,360
But if you're talking about like the
people who were going to win the

2280
01:41:10,361 --> 01:41:15,340
marathons,
they are basically all engine and then

2281
01:41:15,341 --> 01:41:18,100
chassis in the right place.
That's basically all they come down to.

2282
01:41:18,101 --> 01:41:21,430
Right?
I mean they are enormous cardiovascular

2283
01:41:21,431 --> 01:41:24,100
system,
very strong quads,

2284
01:41:24,101 --> 01:41:25,060
Hams,
glutes,

2285
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:27,670
and then everything else is very tiny.
When you say enormous,

2286
01:41:27,671 --> 01:41:30,490
like is literally the size of their law
and you actually look at,

2287
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:34,180
well I mean it's all relative,
but when you look at their frame,

2288
01:41:34,270 --> 01:41:37,660
their thorax is going to be larger.
And is it expanded because of the

2289
01:41:37,661 --> 01:41:39,040
training?
I think so.

2290
01:41:39,041 --> 01:41:41,440
I mean sense you never know cause and
effect.

2291
01:41:41,441 --> 01:41:44,950
Sometimes you could argue like maybe
these guys were,

2292
01:41:44,980 --> 01:41:47,950
maybe the people who are drawn to those
sports are the ones that are,

2293
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:50,350
you know,
are drawn to come to be elite in those

2294
01:41:50,351 --> 01:41:52,780
sports already had a genetic
predisposition.

2295
01:41:52,780 --> 01:41:54,730
That's sort of my feeling is it's a bit
of both.

2296
01:41:54,731 --> 01:41:57,460
Lance Armstrong,
it doesn't have a very large heart.

2297
01:41:57,970 --> 01:42:00,010
Um,
I don't know.

2298
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:03,100
Um,
I think what lance had that was pretty

2299
01:42:03,101 --> 01:42:06,130
unique,
even amongst the world's best,

2300
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:08,290
which is what he competed with.
Of course,

2301
01:42:08,770 --> 01:42:13,360
I think his lactate threshold was a lot
higher than most people genetically.

2302
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:15,160
Yeah.
And then of course,

2303
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:15,851
any,
and again,

2304
01:42:15,851 --> 01:42:16,361
you know,
I mean,

2305
01:42:16,361 --> 01:42:20,740
I know it's such a controversial topic,
although my view is I think that every

2306
01:42:20,741 --> 01:42:25,741
single cyclist,
at least from 1991 till 2011 was on

2307
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:27,460
highly,
highly,

2308
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:29,710
you know,
augmented programs.

2309
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:33,460
So you know,
that Lance one seven of those years,

2310
01:42:33,790 --> 01:42:34,960
um,
in the,

2311
01:42:34,990 --> 01:42:37,150
in that context just tells me that he
was,

2312
01:42:37,180 --> 01:42:40,480
you know,
training harder and being more specific

2313
01:42:40,481 --> 01:42:41,021
to the race.
I mean,

2314
01:42:41,021 --> 01:42:42,910
what people don't understand is like,
I mean,

2315
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:45,190
lance only peaked for one race a year.

2316
01:42:45,340 --> 01:42:49,180
Like everything that that team us postal
did was geared for that one race.

2317
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:53,680
Um,
and also when you really look at how

2318
01:42:53,681 --> 01:42:55,990
much doping they did it,
well actually it wasn't that much.

2319
01:42:56,620 --> 01:42:58,120
Like,
you know,

2320
01:42:58,121 --> 01:43:00,910
when they were blood transfusing,
it might've been two units over the

2321
01:43:00,911 --> 01:43:03,550
course of a race.
And I'm not saying that that wouldn't

2322
01:43:03,551 --> 01:43:04,930
help.
It would help a lot,

2323
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:09,310
but that's nothing compared to what
people were doing just a few years

2324
01:43:09,311 --> 01:43:11,380
before lance came along.
So Lance one,

2325
01:43:11,381 --> 01:43:14,590
I think his first one in [inaudible] 99
the guy who won before that in

2326
01:43:14,591 --> 01:43:17,320
[inaudible] 98 was Marco Pantani before
that was going to be on,

2327
01:43:17,321 --> 01:43:17,711
oh,
rick,

2328
01:43:17,711 --> 01:43:19,960
in 97 and before that was gonna be horn
reese,

2329
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:23,620
bjorn [inaudible],
his nickname was Mr 60 because his

2330
01:43:23,621 --> 01:43:28,621
hematocrit was always over 60.
That's fricking like how that guy didn't

2331
01:43:28,811 --> 01:43:30,490
die of a stroke.
I don't know.

2332
01:43:30,890 --> 01:43:31,840
It's not from EPO.

2333
01:43:32,170 --> 01:43:34,840
Yeah.
Lance never had a credit over 50 to my

2334
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:38,410
knowledge.
They would basically always titrate with

2335
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:42,340
EPO and,
or hemoglobin up to 50 which was the

2336
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:43,990
trigger.
So,

2337
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,221
you know,
but,

2338
01:43:45,221 --> 01:43:46,180
but I think,
and again,

2339
01:43:46,181 --> 01:43:46,841
I,
I've never,

2340
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:49,480
I don't know lance at all,
so I certainly don't know anything about

2341
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:52,310
him beyond like the little bits that I
had read over time.

2342
01:43:52,311 --> 01:43:55,430
But I do think his lactate tolerance was
remarkable,

2343
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:56,930
meaning,
um,

2344
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:58,850
you know,
we measure lactate in athletes,

2345
01:43:58,851 --> 01:44:00,770
swimmers and cyclists when they're,
you know,

2346
01:44:00,830 --> 01:44:04,010
trying to figure out what their
performances and as far as I can tell,

2347
01:44:04,011 --> 01:44:05,810
there are seem to be these two
phenotypes.

2348
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,680
There's the one phenotype where people
can tolerate staggeringly high amounts

2349
01:44:09,681 --> 01:44:10,740
of lactate.
And,

2350
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:13,520
and again,
it's not lactate per se that is causing

2351
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:17,180
the pain that you're experiencing.
It's the hydrogen ion that accompanies

2352
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:18,840
the lactate.
Um,

2353
01:44:19,070 --> 01:44:22,640
so lactic acid,
the acid part of that is a hydrogen ion

2354
01:44:22,641 --> 01:44:26,840
and that's actually what's poisoning the
muscle and preventing the muscle from

2355
01:44:26,841 --> 01:44:30,680
having this effortless Actin Myosin Act,
you know,

2356
01:44:30,710 --> 01:44:32,330
contract release,
et Cetera.

2357
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:35,420
But we use lactate as a proxy cause
we're lactate is high,

2358
01:44:35,421 --> 01:44:38,390
the hydrogen ion is high.
And there were some people who can just

2359
01:44:38,391 --> 01:44:40,610
holler rate,
like incredible doses.

2360
01:44:40,611 --> 01:44:43,070
I used to work with Olympic swimmers and
uh,

2361
01:44:44,030 --> 01:44:46,670
I mean there were just a couple of these
guys like they could actually be

2362
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:50,480
standing with a lactate of 24 I mean
when I was competing,

2363
01:44:50,481 --> 01:44:55,481
if I had a lactate above 16 or 17 I
couldn't be standing like that was just

2364
01:44:55,940 --> 01:44:58,310
too much pain.
Like I was on the floor.

2365
01:44:58,370 --> 01:45:03,370
If I was over 17 I was puking and I saw
dudes that could stand there at 24 I've

2366
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:06,440
fact,
one of my good friends,

2367
01:45:06,441 --> 01:45:06,751
he,
he,

2368
01:45:06,751 --> 01:45:11,751
he won a gold and a silver medal in the
Sydney Olympics and retired from

2369
01:45:11,991 --> 01:45:14,780
swimming in 2004 then came back to swim
masters.

2370
01:45:14,781 --> 01:45:17,090
So and was like,
he actually was trying to make a

2371
01:45:17,091 --> 01:45:19,580
comeback to make the 2012 Olympic team.

2372
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:22,970
And when he was training for that,
like I would poke him between races and

2373
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,820
I saw him get out of a 402 the
individual medley race,

2374
01:45:25,821 --> 01:45:27,770
which is the hardest swim race of them
all.

2375
01:45:27,771 --> 01:45:30,770
The 400 I am is,
I mean you might as well just shoot

2376
01:45:30,771 --> 01:45:31,910
yourself.
It's so painful.

2377
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:36,350
He got out of that.
Had a lactate of 18 two minutes later,

2378
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:38,270
not two minutes later,
maybe seven minutes,

2379
01:45:38,271 --> 01:45:40,730
they are jumped on the blocks and 100
breast race,

2380
01:45:41,060 --> 01:45:42,920
you know,
came out with a lactate of 21 and that

2381
01:45:42,921 --> 01:45:44,840
kind of thing.
So there are those guys.

2382
01:45:44,841 --> 01:45:46,520
And then I think at the other end of the
spectrum,

2383
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:50,840
the word on the street is guys like
Michael Phelps or at the opposite end of

2384
01:45:50,841 --> 01:45:55,841
that where they are so efficient at
shuttling lactic acid out of the cell

2385
01:45:57,201 --> 01:46:01,130
back to the liver where this thing
called the Cori cycle actually turns

2386
01:46:01,131 --> 01:46:04,880
lactate back into glucose that they
never have high levels of lactate.

2387
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:06,250
Now again,
all of this is sort of were,

2388
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:08,210
you know,
speculation because I don't,

2389
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:10,400
I think they were very hush hush about
phelps as numbers,

2390
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:14,630
but I heard from reliable and reasonable
sources that he would rarely have a

2391
01:46:14,631 --> 01:46:18,050
lactate of of 8.0 including when he's
breaking world records.

2392
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:21,350
Whoa.
Which for me at 8.0 like I'm smoking and

2393
01:46:21,351 --> 01:46:24,490
joking like that's fine,
but for you know,

2394
01:46:24,590 --> 01:46:28,190
he was so efficient at getting rid of it
that yeah,

2395
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:29,150
he could,
you know,

2396
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:31,500
set the world record in the 400 I am and
have a lactate of eight.

2397
01:46:31,680 --> 01:46:33,200
Again,
I don't know if this is true,

2398
01:46:33,470 --> 01:46:34,370
but,
but I've,

2399
01:46:35,450 --> 01:46:38,060
there's certainly a plausible mechanism
by which it could be,

2400
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:39,740
well,
it's fascinating that this could

2401
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:41,510
potentially all be engineered,
right?

2402
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,970
That like through use of crispr or
something else,

2403
01:46:43,971 --> 01:46:48,971
you could take all these various facets
of performance enhancing modalities,

2404
01:46:49,950 --> 01:46:54,150
extend a person's ability and so many
different ways and create a super

2405
01:46:54,151 --> 01:46:54,984
person.

2406
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:55,621
Yeah,
of course.

2407
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:56,371
It's interesting,
right?

2408
01:46:56,371 --> 01:46:58,590
Once he started genetically doing it,
if you could,

2409
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:00,930
does it become cheating in the same way?
Like would we,

2410
01:47:00,931 --> 01:47:03,720
would we have,
if you have someone like Phelps who has

2411
01:47:03,721 --> 01:47:08,721
this genetic predisposition to getting
rid of lactose lactaid and you take

2412
01:47:08,881 --> 01:47:11,670
someone like me,
you probably has none of that and you

2413
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:13,560
know,
you juice me up to his level.

2414
01:47:13,860 --> 01:47:16,060
Is that cheating?
I mean it is.

2415
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,060
I don't know.
I mean those are the questions.

2416
01:47:18,061 --> 01:47:20,280
I mean,
this is why people like Daniel Coyle who

2417
01:47:20,281 --> 01:47:24,390
are so critical of Lance Armstrong say
cause cause on the one hand you'll have

2418
01:47:24,391 --> 01:47:25,171
camps and say,
look,

2419
01:47:25,171 --> 01:47:27,780
it's the great equalizer.
Like why don't we just let everybody

2420
01:47:27,781 --> 01:47:30,660
dope and steroid argument with them and
may as well.

2421
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:32,910
Well and and frankly it's more my
argument,

2422
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:35,130
but I have a different reason for
arguing that way,

2423
01:47:35,131 --> 01:47:38,820
which is I think having done these
sports and nowhere near at the high

2424
01:47:38,821 --> 01:47:40,110
level that those guys do it.

2425
01:47:40,140 --> 01:47:43,500
I just know how destructive they are.
Like the Tour de France is the most

2426
01:47:43,501 --> 01:47:45,090
unhealthy thing on the face of the
earth.

2427
01:47:45,150 --> 01:47:50,150
I've heard that it's healthier to do to,
to Tour de France on steroids than it is

2428
01:47:50,161 --> 01:47:53,790
to do it off sterile absa fucking loot
Lee.

2429
01:47:54,120 --> 01:47:55,590
When those guys finish the Tour de
France,

2430
01:47:55,591 --> 01:47:58,770
they are osteopenic.
I mean their bone density has eroded

2431
01:47:59,070 --> 01:48:01,470
their muscle.
They have lost so much muscle mass.

2432
01:48:01,471 --> 01:48:03,900
I mean it is a devastating grueling
event.

2433
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:06,690
Now nothing's going to completely
ameliorate that.

2434
01:48:07,020 --> 01:48:10,140
But like,
if we think that like watching these

2435
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:13,500
guys killed themselves,
riding six hours a day,

2436
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:15,870
hitting peak thresholds of,
you know,

2437
01:48:15,871 --> 01:48:18,720
six watts per kilogram,
if we think there's anything

2438
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:21,930
physiologically reasonable about that,
we're out to fucking lunch.

2439
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,490
But is that the point?
I mean,

2440
01:48:23,491 --> 01:48:27,240
isn't that the point is that you can
push your mind to do something your body

2441
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:29,100
absolutely doesn't want to do.

2442
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,230
So you should be rewarded for,
for that.

2443
01:48:31,770 --> 01:48:33,750
And these guys are in a league of their
own,

2444
01:48:33,751 --> 01:48:35,070
I mean,
professional cyclists for some of the

2445
01:48:35,071 --> 01:48:36,660
toughest athletes out there.
I mean,

2446
01:48:36,661 --> 01:48:39,620
obviously every athlete at the peak of
their game is remarkable and,

2447
01:48:39,621 --> 01:48:42,780
and no disrespect to like the best
running back in the NFL,

2448
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:46,110
but like,
you can't even compare that to what a

2449
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:48,390
guy does for,
for workload for sure.

2450
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:49,560
Yeah.
For just the pain,

2451
01:48:49,590 --> 01:48:52,250
like the absolute sheer discomfort.
Um,

2452
01:48:52,360 --> 01:48:55,260
and the physiologic torture and the
duration of it and all of these other

2453
01:48:55,261 --> 01:48:56,021
things.
Well,

2454
01:48:56,021 --> 01:48:59,150
you see it in their faces to those guys.
Like when they retired,

2455
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,110
they look like they're 10 years older
than they are.

2456
01:49:01,180 --> 01:49:01,490
Yeah,
yeah,

2457
01:49:01,490 --> 01:49:03,390
yeah.
I mean they've lost all of the fat.

2458
01:49:03,420 --> 01:49:04,021
A lot of them,
you know,

2459
01:49:04,021 --> 01:49:06,060
they just,
if you don't have fat in your face,

2460
01:49:06,061 --> 01:49:09,870
I mean you age dramatically,
they just look exhausted too.

2461
01:49:09,930 --> 01:49:12,390
I mean,
it looks like it's just drained them

2462
01:49:12,391 --> 01:49:15,180
like they've forced to live 30 years
inside of 10.

2463
01:49:15,390 --> 01:49:16,081
Yeah.
So it's like,

2464
01:49:16,081 --> 01:49:17,760
what if we just say,
guess what?

2465
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,760
Everybody's allowed to use whatever
amounts of EPO,

2466
01:49:20,761 --> 01:49:25,470
blood testosterone to be at the 80th
percentile of what we consider normal.

2467
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:30,500
So everybody is allowed to walk around
with a hemoglobin of 14.7 or up to 14.7

2468
01:49:31,141 --> 01:49:33,120
or 15 or cheat that,
right?

2469
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:34,141
Wouldn't they?
I mean,

2470
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:38,580
if you allow people to use,
but I also think like the,

2471
01:49:38,670 --> 01:49:43,670
the testing on this stuff is so like,
it's so jv now there's this idea called

2472
01:49:43,981 --> 01:49:46,440
the biological passport.
There was introduced many years ago,

2473
01:49:46,441 --> 01:49:47,440
which basically,
look,

2474
01:49:47,441 --> 01:49:51,370
we're going to develop a signature for
every person and now if you deviate much

2475
01:49:51,371 --> 01:49:53,740
from your signature will,
that'll be the trigger.

2476
01:49:54,100 --> 01:49:56,350
Um,
and the argument again by certain

2477
01:49:56,351 --> 01:49:58,270
people,
and I think Daniel coyle argued this a

2478
01:49:58,271 --> 01:50:01,840
lot in um,
one of his books that he wrote ripping

2479
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:04,790
apart lance was the reason.

2480
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,860
It's the reason doping is unfair because
the everybody does it argument doesn't

2481
01:50:08,861 --> 01:50:13,690
hold water is because if you're a person
who naturally lives at a hematocrit of

2482
01:50:13,691 --> 01:50:16,990
47,
you're only getting a slight improvement

2483
01:50:16,991 --> 01:50:20,410
going from 47 to 50.
If you're a person who naturally lives

2484
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:23,590
at 43,
you going from 43 to 50,

2485
01:50:23,591 --> 01:50:27,250
you get a much bigger advantage to which
I say,

2486
01:50:27,370 --> 01:50:30,550
yeah,
but that's true on a relative basis.

2487
01:50:30,551 --> 01:50:33,820
But an absolute level,
if everybody's walking around with a

2488
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:37,360
hematocrit of 48 to 50,
they still have the same oxygen carrying

2489
01:50:37,361 --> 01:50:39,460
capacity.
It does level the playing field.

2490
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:44,170
The concern though isn't,
I would believe the concern is you don't

2491
01:50:44,171 --> 01:50:48,010
want people to think that the only way
to do this sport is to take drugs.

2492
01:50:48,520 --> 01:50:52,000
Well absolutely.
And it's also worth putting in in mind

2493
01:50:52,001 --> 01:50:53,920
that,
and this is sort of my pet peeve with

2494
01:50:53,921 --> 01:50:57,100
this whole drug and sport thing is like,
I mean

2495
01:50:58,870 --> 01:51:00,190
personally I don't really give a shit.

2496
01:51:00,220 --> 01:51:01,750
I mean I just have bigger things I care
about.

2497
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:05,500
Then like how many steroids barry bonds
took to hit all those home runs.

2498
01:51:05,740 --> 01:51:08,890
But what really does chap my ass is when
people don't actually understand how

2499
01:51:08,891 --> 01:51:10,630
steroids work,
right?

2500
01:51:10,631 --> 01:51:15,040
Like it bugs the shit out of me when
people assume that if you take steroids

2501
01:51:15,041 --> 01:51:16,450
you will have,
you know,

2502
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:18,120
you will hit that many,
you know,

2503
01:51:18,190 --> 01:51:20,890
home runs or you will run this fast or
lift this much.

2504
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:25,690
The only thing that steroid is doing is
enabling you to recover faster from the

2505
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:29,170
brutal work that it takes to actually do
those things.

2506
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,880
So you know,
all the,

2507
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:34,840
if I,
if I shot myself full of Epo,

2508
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,640
I mean you've probably seen ICARUS,
right?

2509
01:51:37,170 --> 01:51:38,440
I mean I thought that was,
I thought he did it.

2510
01:51:38,441 --> 01:51:41,110
I thought bit Bryan Fogel that prideful
of that.

2511
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:43,280
A really good job of showing like,
I mean,

2512
01:51:43,281 --> 01:51:46,150
and he was a pretty good responder to
the EPO.

2513
01:51:46,150 --> 01:51:48,340
I think he did a growth hormone.
Testosterone,

2514
01:51:48,341 --> 01:51:52,010
an EPO.
I mean you saw in the end of the day he

2515
01:51:52,011 --> 01:51:56,050
f he finished worse the second year
round because his bike ran out of,

2516
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:57,460
exactly.
That's my point.

2517
01:51:57,461 --> 01:52:01,210
You see like people don't realize like
one little thing makes all the

2518
01:52:01,211 --> 01:52:03,640
difference from a performance
standpoint.

2519
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:04,990
Yeah.
He probably would have done a little bit

2520
01:52:04,991 --> 01:52:07,660
better,
but it's not because the drugs were in

2521
01:52:07,661 --> 01:52:09,640
him per se.
It's because the drugs that were in him

2522
01:52:09,641 --> 01:52:13,600
allowed to train more.
So the reason he was a fitter rider the

2523
01:52:13,601 --> 01:52:18,160
second year was because his watts per
kilo were hired because of how much more

2524
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:21,190
he trained the drugs enabled him to
train that much harder.

2525
01:52:21,220 --> 01:52:22,450
Yeah.
That's what it does.

2526
01:52:22,451 --> 01:52:24,820
It allows you to train harder so you
recover better.

2527
01:52:24,821 --> 01:52:27,130
So you have more output.
Correct.

2528
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:30,400
But we don't want young kids to think
that the only way to do this is start

2529
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:32,560
taking steroids and fuck up your
endocrine system.

2530
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:33,281
And that's,
no,

2531
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:35,770
of course not.
But we also want to keep in mind like

2532
01:52:36,610 --> 01:52:38,230
see,
it almost requires like a broader

2533
01:52:38,231 --> 01:52:40,120
discussion,
which is like why do we care?

2534
01:52:40,690 --> 01:52:44,320
Well we care in combat sports because it
allows you to inflict more damage and

2535
01:52:44,370 --> 01:52:44,581
no,
no,

2536
01:52:44,581 --> 01:52:44,801
no,
no.

2537
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:46,850
I'm saying like why would,
why do,

2538
01:52:46,910 --> 01:52:48,950
why do it?
Let's just say I'm not a professional

2539
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:49,784
athlete.
Okay.

2540
01:52:50,030 --> 01:52:54,410
Why do I actually care how fast I run or
how fast I ride or any of these other

2541
01:52:54,411 --> 01:52:55,880
things?
Well,

2542
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:58,580
because you want to brag about it.
So maybe or weight,

2543
01:52:58,930 --> 01:53:00,830
right?
So maybe there in lies the problem.

2544
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,030
I mean,
I mean I,

2545
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:06,560
you know,
when I stopped cycling competitively,

2546
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:12,280
I think a big part of it was I just
realized that performance and longevity

2547
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:16,160
stopped being colinear.
They started to become somewhat

2548
01:53:16,161 --> 01:53:17,900
orthogonal.
They started to deviate.

2549
01:53:18,170 --> 01:53:20,150
In other words,
the things that I was doing that we're

2550
01:53:20,151 --> 01:53:23,120
enhancing my performance and I'm not
even talking about drugs,

2551
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:24,560
I'm just talking training wise.

2552
01:53:25,250 --> 01:53:28,550
It seemed to come at the expense of what
I believed was going to make me live

2553
01:53:28,551 --> 01:53:31,040
longer.
So specifically the,

2554
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:33,530
the thing I cared most about was
cardiovascular health.

2555
01:53:33,860 --> 01:53:38,860
Now the incidence of atrial fibrillation
in highly trained athletes is 10 times

2556
01:53:40,251 --> 01:53:44,150
higher than that of non athletes.
So like that's a little

2557
01:53:44,151 --> 01:53:45,210
counterintuitive,
right?

2558
01:53:45,770 --> 01:53:50,770
Why would people who have such amazingly
fit cardiovascular systems have 10 times

2559
01:53:51,051 --> 01:53:54,590
the risk of this horrible condition
called atrial fibrillation,

2560
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:57,320
which yeah,
many people have it but not young.

2561
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:59,030
You're not supposed to have that when
you're 40.

2562
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:02,540
And it's usually associated with
cardiovascular disease.

2563
01:54:02,990 --> 01:54:05,240
And yet people are,
you know,

2564
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,900
showing up with these,
I mean I have four patients who have had

2565
01:54:08,901 --> 01:54:11,030
to get ablations for atrial
fibrillation.

2566
01:54:11,031 --> 01:54:14,120
What does an ablation and ablation is a
procedure where they stick a catheter up

2567
01:54:14,121 --> 01:54:19,121
through the femoral artery in the vein
and then they burned pieces of the heart

2568
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:21,440
specifically around the,
um,

2569
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:25,160
uh,
pulmonary veins and they basically are

2570
01:54:25,790 --> 01:54:29,330
trying to burn away and create,
um,

2571
01:54:30,050 --> 01:54:32,570
uh,
or remove the ability of the electrical

2572
01:54:32,571 --> 01:54:33,740
system to move in this way.

2573
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:37,040
So what's basically happening with,
with this type of athlete's heart is,

2574
01:54:37,650 --> 01:54:39,950
um,
when your heart is constantly being

2575
01:54:39,951 --> 01:54:43,040
exposed to that high stretch,
high ejection fraction load,

2576
01:54:43,190 --> 01:54:45,530
you're basically stretching out the
electrical system cause the electrical

2577
01:54:45,531 --> 01:54:47,360
system of the heart runs within its
muscles.

2578
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:52,040
So as you stretch it out a certain group
of people and we don't know why certain

2579
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:53,630
people are susceptible and certain or
not,

2580
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:55,970
but they just developed this,
um,

2581
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:59,360
this dysrhythmia.
So you're soldering the motherboard as

2582
01:54:59,361 --> 01:54:59,970
it were.
Yeah.

2583
01:54:59,970 --> 01:55:01,040
Yeah.
You can possibly think of that.

2584
01:55:01,041 --> 01:55:04,310
Right?
You're like creating new lines to block

2585
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:04,871
the,
the,

2586
01:55:04,871 --> 01:55:06,580
the connection.
Oh,

2587
01:55:07,070 --> 01:55:08,690
that's fucking crazy.
Yeah.

2588
01:55:08,691 --> 01:55:10,490
So think about it.
Someone said once,

2589
01:55:10,491 --> 01:55:13,280
and I don't know if that's true,
maybe you'd be able to have some insight

2590
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:18,440
there that there is a concept that your
entire life,

2591
01:55:18,441 --> 01:55:19,910
you have a certain amount of heartbeats.

2592
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:23,480
Does that make sense?
Oh No,

2593
01:55:23,481 --> 01:55:24,680
of course.
I've heard it many times.

2594
01:55:24,681 --> 01:55:26,880
I don't know if that's correct.
I,

2595
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:28,550
that's fucking scary.
I don't,

2596
01:55:28,551 --> 01:55:30,800
I don't,
I don't tend to agree with that.

2597
01:55:31,250 --> 01:55:33,430
Um,
because I,

2598
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:35,660
I,
you can't compare one beat to the other.

2599
01:55:35,661 --> 01:55:36,141
I mean,
you,

2600
01:55:36,141 --> 01:55:36,741
you can't,
you know,

2601
01:55:36,741 --> 01:55:38,750
it's hard for me to say that,
you know,

2602
01:55:39,470 --> 01:55:44,470
an 80 to 90% ejection fraction beat
under incredible load is the same as the

2603
01:55:45,511 --> 01:55:46,560
beat that I'm,
you know,

2604
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:49,560
like it is beat per beat,
the same as the beat I experience when

2605
01:55:49,561 --> 01:55:51,090
I'm sleeping and my heart's writing,
you know,

2606
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:52,590
my heart's beating at 40 beats per
minute.

2607
01:55:52,920 --> 01:55:53,780
I think,
um,

2608
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,040
maybe there's a directional truth to
that,

2609
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,400
but I,
I feel like when you're talking about

2610
01:55:59,401 --> 01:56:01,770
human longevity,
it's a game of inches.

2611
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:05,040
And that is like something that's
probably directionally true within a

2612
01:56:05,040 --> 01:56:05,873
mile.

2613
01:56:05,990 --> 01:56:08,780
Now when you're talking about human
longevity and you,

2614
01:56:08,781 --> 01:56:10,700
you know,
and you're thinking about all these

2615
01:56:10,701 --> 01:56:12,590
different things that you could do to
extend,

2616
01:56:13,070 --> 01:56:18,070
how much of that is supplementation and
do you supplement?

2617
01:56:18,110 --> 01:56:21,200
Like are you,
are you a person who takes colloidal

2618
01:56:21,201 --> 01:56:25,820
minerals or are you a person that is
interested in antioxidants?

2619
01:56:25,821 --> 01:56:28,070
Like what,
what do you do in terms of that?

2620
01:56:28,650 --> 01:56:29,880
Um,
so I,

2621
01:56:29,980 --> 01:56:34,600
my view on longevity is it's just,
it's the hardest problem there is.

2622
01:56:34,630 --> 01:56:38,560
And so you gotta have every,
like I'm agnostic about what the

2623
01:56:38,561 --> 01:56:41,560
approach is.
So I want to understand everything that

2624
01:56:41,561 --> 01:56:43,210
you can do with respect to,
you know,

2625
01:56:43,211 --> 01:56:44,710
food,
drugs,

2626
01:56:44,740 --> 01:56:46,600
supplements,
hormones.

2627
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:49,270
And to be clear,
the only difference between a drug and a

2628
01:56:49,271 --> 01:56:51,370
supplement is one's regulated and one is
not.

2629
01:56:51,371 --> 01:56:51,991
But you know,
and I,

2630
01:56:51,991 --> 01:56:53,980
I have patients that'll say things like,
oh,

2631
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:54,620
you know,
doctor,

2632
01:56:54,620 --> 01:56:58,030
I don't want to take that drug.
I'd rather do it naturally.

2633
01:56:58,031 --> 01:56:59,320
Can I do it?
And it sort of like,

2634
01:56:59,321 --> 01:57:00,190
well,
okay,

2635
01:57:00,191 --> 01:57:01,510
you,
you don't want to take a stat and,

2636
01:57:01,511 --> 01:57:05,320
but you do want to take red yeast rice.
Well they both inhibit HMG coa

2637
01:57:05,321 --> 01:57:07,600
reductase.
The enzyme that catalyzes the first step

2638
01:57:07,601 --> 01:57:11,620
of cholesterol synthesis.
You're willing to take one that you buy

2639
01:57:12,070 --> 01:57:14,530
in a drug store that's totally
unregulated and you're not willing to

2640
01:57:14,531 --> 01:57:18,310
buy the one that comes from a drug
company where the FDA has their foot up

2641
01:57:18,311 --> 01:57:20,680
the ass of the company making it to make
sure it's perfect.

2642
01:57:21,040 --> 01:57:22,490
That just strikes me as a false
equivalent.

2643
01:57:22,491 --> 01:57:26,170
So I only say that to just say like,
I think everything should be on the

2644
01:57:26,171 --> 01:57:29,080
table and then the question should be,
how do you decide what to do?

2645
01:57:29,081 --> 01:57:30,400
So,
um,

2646
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:32,680
uh,
there are absolutely a bunch of

2647
01:57:32,681 --> 01:57:34,450
supplements that I take.
Um,

2648
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:37,750
but I don't have kind of a one size fits
all approach to it because I think

2649
01:57:37,751 --> 01:57:40,930
you've gotta be able to kind of measure
what's going on in a person,

2650
01:57:41,170 --> 01:57:42,460
get a baseline and figure it out.
So,

2651
01:57:42,461 --> 01:57:43,120
you know,
I mean,

2652
01:57:43,120 --> 01:57:46,120
my guess is you've had a million people
on the show that can talk your ears off

2653
01:57:46,121 --> 01:57:47,140
about,
you know,

2654
01:57:47,141 --> 01:57:48,940
which paypal,
which people should take methylated

2655
01:57:48,941 --> 01:57:52,750
vitamins versus which shouldn't,
and if you have this mthfr mutation

2656
01:57:52,751 --> 01:57:55,150
versus this one,
should you be taking this versus that.

2657
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:56,710
I think all of those things are valid.

2658
01:57:57,010 --> 01:57:59,590
Um,
some of the stuff that I find even more

2659
01:57:59,591 --> 01:58:02,920
interesting is actually a lot less sexy
and I don't have a good answer for it.

2660
01:58:02,980 --> 01:58:03,813
But,
um,

2661
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,051
you know,
looking at,

2662
01:58:05,051 --> 01:58:06,610
for example,
vitamin D levels.

2663
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:07,770
So,
you know,

2664
01:58:07,870 --> 01:58:11,170
you see a huge disparity and the vitamin
D levels people have.

2665
01:58:11,410 --> 01:58:16,360
And it begs the question to all people
run effectively at the same vitamin D

2666
01:58:16,361 --> 01:58:18,070
level.
Um,

2667
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:20,920
and is that a function of not just their
own individual,

2668
01:58:20,921 --> 01:58:24,460
like how much sun they're getting,
but more importantly like potentially

2669
01:58:24,461 --> 01:58:29,461
genetically where they're from.
So I'm starting to feel like people who

2670
01:58:30,341 --> 01:58:32,340
have northern European,
uh,

2671
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:37,440
blood might actually run better at a
lower vitamin D level than people like

2672
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:38,500
me who,
you know,

2673
01:58:38,530 --> 01:58:43,030
come from places near the equator where
maybe just evolved to see more sunlight

2674
01:58:43,031 --> 01:58:45,400
and have more vitamin d.
What's your ancestry?

2675
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:46,900
My parents are both from Egypt.

2676
01:58:47,170 --> 01:58:48,070
Oh,
interesting.

2677
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:50,620
Um,
so,

2678
01:58:50,710 --> 01:58:53,050
and the range,
like when you look at a laboratory test,

2679
01:58:53,051 --> 01:58:56,560
when you check somebody vitamin D,
like the range that's offered is 30 to a

2680
01:58:56,561 --> 01:58:59,500
hundred is optimal say range.
Yeah.

2681
01:58:59,501 --> 01:59:00,070
I'm like,
that's,

2682
01:59:00,070 --> 01:59:01,520
that's probably not the range,
you know,

2683
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:02,890
so,
so I personally think the range is

2684
01:59:02,891 --> 01:59:05,470
probably 40 to 60,
but I also measure something called

2685
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:09,010
parathyroid hormone that allows me to
further titrate that range and stuff

2686
01:59:09,011 --> 01:59:10,540
like that.
Well when you talking about this,

2687
01:59:10,541 --> 01:59:13,690
it's really obvious,
really clear that there's so much data

2688
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:16,140
to go through that it's,
we're,

2689
01:59:16,210 --> 01:59:19,990
we're learning this and [inaudible],
I don't want to say it's in its infancy,

2690
01:59:19,991 --> 01:59:23,340
but if we look back a thousand years now
and we will most certainly say their

2691
01:59:23,350 --> 01:59:25,570
understanding of this science is at its
infancy.

2692
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:27,070
Yeah,
for sure.

2693
01:59:27,130 --> 01:59:31,900
I mean,
the issue is how do you make sense of a

2694
01:59:31,901 --> 01:59:34,810
problem or how do you try to solve a
problem which is unsolvable.

2695
01:59:34,990 --> 01:59:36,370
And,
and the reason I say that is the

2696
01:59:36,371 --> 01:59:37,690
following,
um,

2697
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:41,560
you know,
you have what I call kind of the

2698
01:59:41,561 --> 01:59:44,080
medicine 1.0 world,
which was,

2699
01:59:44,600 --> 01:59:47,980
I define that as everything that took
place before Francis Bacon.

2700
01:59:48,610 --> 01:59:50,890
Um,
you can probably tell me when that was.

2701
01:59:50,891 --> 01:59:55,891
I'm going to guess Francis Bacon is like
1650 to 1670 or something like that.

2702
01:59:56,260 --> 02:00:00,400
But that was basically the first person
to come along and codify the scientific

2703
02:00:00,401 --> 02:00:03,760
method.
So anything that came along before the

2704
02:00:03,761 --> 02:00:08,761
scientific method may have been correct.
Meaning there were things that were

2705
02:00:08,951 --> 02:00:11,650
certainly done back then that proved
helpful,

2706
02:00:11,980 --> 02:00:15,400
but they weren't grounded in a principle
of science.

2707
02:00:15,550 --> 02:00:17,110
In other words,
you know,

2708
02:00:17,111 --> 02:00:19,390
even a blind squirrel is gonna find nuts
sometimes.

2709
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:22,840
And then we basically through,
you know,

2710
02:00:22,841 --> 02:00:24,300
following the Qaddafi,
you know,

2711
02:00:24,301 --> 02:00:24,811
the,
the,

2712
02:00:24,811 --> 02:00:28,420
the elucidation of a scientific method,
the development of statistics to

2713
02:00:28,421 --> 02:00:30,070
actually make sense of data.

2714
02:00:30,460 --> 02:00:33,220
We then got into the sweet spot where I
think we are now,

2715
02:00:33,221 --> 02:00:37,780
which is medicine 2.0 and to me,
medicine 2.0 is really good at solving

2716
02:00:37,781 --> 02:00:40,600
problems that are amenable to relatively
short,

2717
02:00:40,601 --> 02:00:44,650
simple clinical trials.
And there has been no better example

2718
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:47,260
than in this space than infectious
diseases.

2719
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:52,590
So like if you think about the
unbelievable improvement in human

2720
02:00:52,601 --> 02:00:56,350
longevity that has come from
antibiotics,

2721
02:00:56,590 --> 02:00:59,710
antiviral therapy for HIV,
I mean remember 30 years ago,

2722
02:00:59,711 --> 02:01:03,970
Hiv was a lethal Li,
no questions asked lethal condition.

2723
02:01:03,971 --> 02:01:07,060
Today it's a chronic disease for
virtually every patient with HIV.

2724
02:01:07,061 --> 02:01:10,210
It's a chronic disease today,
meaning you will die with HIV,

2725
02:01:10,211 --> 02:01:12,010
not from HIV.
That is,

2726
02:01:12,730 --> 02:01:17,230
that's almost hard to fathom when you
consider how shitty we are at addressing

2727
02:01:17,231 --> 02:01:19,180
other chronic diseases like heart
disease,

2728
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:20,650
cancer,
Alzheimer's disease.

2729
02:01:21,190 --> 02:01:26,020
So the problem is if you want to know
the answer,

2730
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:28,420
should I eat this way or that way?

2731
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:31,330
Should I exercise this way or that way?
Should I take this drug or that drug or

2732
02:01:31,331 --> 02:01:34,120
this supplement or that supplement to
live longer?

2733
02:01:34,150 --> 02:01:38,440
We can never know the answer in humans
because there is no clinical trial that

2734
02:01:38,441 --> 02:01:41,420
can answer that question.
And we can do that experiment in

2735
02:01:41,450 --> 02:01:44,840
everything that's not human.
But we've already learned the hard way

2736
02:01:44,841 --> 02:01:48,560
that what happens in not humans doesn't
necessarily extrapolate to humans.

2737
02:01:49,250 --> 02:01:51,800
And we can do things to be slicker about
it.

2738
02:01:51,801 --> 02:01:53,990
You know,
when you study rhesus monkeys for 20

2739
02:01:53,991 --> 02:01:56,060
years,
it's certainly more interesting than

2740
02:01:56,061 --> 02:01:59,600
studying mice for one year.
But in the end,

2741
02:01:59,630 --> 02:02:01,520
you know,
there's still animals in captivity.

2742
02:02:01,521 --> 02:02:03,830
They're still not in the same
environment and all these things.

2743
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:08,831
So my view on this topic is the only way
to go to this kind of medicine 3.0 is

2744
02:02:09,501 --> 02:02:12,740
you've got to have kind of a strategy
around how you think about it.

2745
02:02:13,310 --> 02:02:16,120
And so in many ways that's,
that's if,

2746
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:21,160
that's what I spend most of my time
dealing with is what is a strategy for

2747
02:02:21,531 --> 02:02:26,531
longevity that becomes a scaffolding
upon which you anchor every new piece of

2748
02:02:27,171 --> 02:02:29,090
data.
Because I mean,

2749
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:31,130
I know things today from a data
standpoint,

2750
02:02:31,131 --> 02:02:32,900
I didn't know 10 years ago and to your
point,

2751
02:02:32,901 --> 02:02:36,230
even in five years we'll look back at
stuff we're doing today and thank God we

2752
02:02:36,231 --> 02:02:38,690
have more data.
Is that still the right thing to do?

2753
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:41,780
Um,
and so that strategy to me is,

2754
02:02:41,781 --> 02:02:45,320
is sort of fundamentally based on three
bodies of literature.

2755
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:49,160
And the first is is like what did we
learn from centenarians so that people

2756
02:02:49,161 --> 02:02:52,490
who naturally live to a hundred,
um,

2757
02:02:52,700 --> 02:02:56,120
they have the advantage or that body of
literature has the advantage of being

2758
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:59,210
based on humans.
It has the disadvantage of it not being

2759
02:02:59,211 --> 02:03:00,080
experimental.

2760
02:03:00,110 --> 02:03:01,180
So we,
you know,

2761
02:03:01,181 --> 02:03:03,860
like we don't know like what cause and
effect was.

2762
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:06,110
And then secondly,
if you look at all of the animal

2763
02:03:06,111 --> 02:03:09,320
literature or nonhuman literature where
you can actually do the experiments,

2764
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,530
what's common there?
And then if you look at the underlying

2765
02:03:12,770 --> 02:03:14,650
molecular mechanisms,
so if you,

2766
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:17,780
I feel like if you tie those three
together,

2767
02:03:18,110 --> 02:03:21,620
you come up with a general scaffolding
for what it means to live longer and

2768
02:03:21,621 --> 02:03:26,621
live healthier,
then we can try to look at one thing at

2769
02:03:28,131 --> 02:03:29,060
a time and say,
hey,

2770
02:03:29,420 --> 02:03:31,400
vitamin D,
yay or nay antioxidant,

2771
02:03:31,401 --> 02:03:34,370
Yay or nay.
So when you're,

2772
02:03:34,590 --> 02:03:35,150
it's,
it's,

2773
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:38,030
it's gotta be very time consuming for
you.

2774
02:03:38,110 --> 02:03:41,030
We'll have a research team.
That's when I started this practice

2775
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:45,980
about three years ago,
I realized like I was losing the battle.

2776
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:47,660
I,
my ability to sit down and read

2777
02:03:47,661 --> 02:03:49,550
scientific papers was like shrinking.

2778
02:03:50,090 --> 02:03:51,800
So I hired an analyst,
you know,

2779
02:03:51,801 --> 02:03:52,011
he,
I,

2780
02:03:52,011 --> 02:03:54,140
he had worked with me in the past.
He was amazing.

2781
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:57,420
I brought him over full time to do this.
Then another one that another,

2782
02:03:57,470 --> 02:04:02,450
I mean now I have four full time
analysts and I mean as this practice

2783
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:04,250
grows and or you know,
whatever,

2784
02:04:04,251 --> 02:04:07,400
I have the revenue to justify it.
Like I'll have 10 analysts one day and

2785
02:04:07,401 --> 02:04:09,320
this practice,
and even that's not enough.

2786
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:14,600
I mean approximately 100,000 papers are
published every month on pub med,

2787
02:04:14,990 --> 02:04:17,420
Jesus Christ.
So I forgot I did the math on that one.

2788
02:04:17,421 --> 02:04:19,910
So I think it's like three papers a
minute.

2789
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:22,640
It's pretty stunning when you think
about the amount of human achievement

2790
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:25,100
that we've experienced just in our
lifetime in that regard.

2791
02:04:25,101 --> 02:04:29,870
Like how many people are working on
understanding just the mechanisms and

2792
02:04:29,871 --> 02:04:32,960
the human body and this data is just
piling up as we speak.

2793
02:04:32,990 --> 02:04:34,700
Yeah,
but the problem is the signal to noise

2794
02:04:34,701 --> 02:04:39,701
ratio is almost zero.
So I would say conservatively 90%,

2795
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:42,930
if not 99% of that is completely
useless.

2796
02:04:43,030 --> 02:04:44,730
Really.
Absolutely.

2797
02:04:45,030 --> 02:04:47,310
Um,
actually wrote about this once.

2798
02:04:47,690 --> 02:04:50,280
Um,
so when a paper comes out,

2799
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:54,780
if it is never cited again,
meaning for the remainder of time,

2800
02:04:54,781 --> 02:04:57,630
no one ever even goes back to reference
that paper.

2801
02:04:57,810 --> 02:05:00,090
You could probably make the case that
that paper is not relevant.

2802
02:05:00,930 --> 02:05:04,170
And if you then further strip out auto
citations,

2803
02:05:04,680 --> 02:05:07,980
meaning the only time it's ever cited is
when the author then goes back and cites

2804
02:05:07,981 --> 02:05:12,981
his or her own paper.
Something like 70 or 80% of patients of

2805
02:05:13,671 --> 02:05:17,850
papers never get cited outside of an
auto citation.

2806
02:05:17,851 --> 02:05:19,770
Again,
is this because they're not relevant or

2807
02:05:19,771 --> 02:05:22,090
does it possible to get lofts lost in
the shuffle?

2808
02:05:22,091 --> 02:05:24,070
Like some of them might be worth
something?

2809
02:05:24,180 --> 02:05:26,700
Probably possible,
but I would bet it is much,

2810
02:05:26,701 --> 02:05:28,380
much more the former than the latter.

2811
02:05:29,790 --> 02:05:32,550
And then on top of it,
a lot of stuff comes out and then years

2812
02:05:32,551 --> 02:05:35,070
later you realize it was wrong,
you know,

2813
02:05:35,100 --> 02:05:37,950
or it was.
And that's more often the case that it

2814
02:05:37,951 --> 02:05:41,130
was wrong through an honest mistake then
wrong through a dishonest mistake.

2815
02:05:41,131 --> 02:05:43,260
But there's still a lot of wrong through
dishonest mistake.

2816
02:05:43,261 --> 02:05:46,920
Stuff's coming out there as well.
So how much of this data is forcing you

2817
02:05:46,921 --> 02:05:49,650
or causing you to alter your own
patterns?

2818
02:05:50,340 --> 02:05:51,330
Well,
we,

2819
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:56,500
we believe internally that probably 100
papers a month enter the literature that

2820
02:05:57,571 --> 02:06:01,170
are relevant to what we do.
Meaning it means some of the literature

2821
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:01,861
that comes out,
like,

2822
02:06:01,861 --> 02:06:04,020
you know,
the rheumatology literature might be

2823
02:06:04,021 --> 02:06:05,670
relevant to them,
but that's not what I do.

2824
02:06:05,671 --> 02:06:07,620
That's crazy.
Three a day.

2825
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:11,670
Yeah.
So that's why when I say I want 10

2826
02:06:11,671 --> 02:06:14,370
analysts,
you see why it's like it's you got it.

2827
02:06:14,370 --> 02:06:16,470
Because first of all it's finding those
papers too.

2828
02:06:16,471 --> 02:06:20,280
So how do you do that?
Like what we subscribe to a whole bunch

2829
02:06:20,281 --> 02:06:23,520
of services that basically prefilter a
bunch of shit for us.

2830
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,500
And then we have a system where we go
about kind of pulling that stuff.

2831
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:31,440
So you get those three a day and then
they bring them to you.

2832
02:06:31,441 --> 02:06:33,100
How do you have the time?
No.

2833
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:34,510
So is the thing,
and I,

2834
02:06:34,630 --> 02:06:35,730
it's funny you say that.
I was like,

2835
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:38,370
literally as I was driving here today,
I was talking to my buddy of mine and I

2836
02:06:38,371 --> 02:06:39,450
was like,
dude,

2837
02:06:39,480 --> 02:06:41,100
I'm the fucking bottleneck and I hate
it.

2838
02:06:41,880 --> 02:06:46,560
I'm now the bottleneck because the
analysts are now turning out stuff

2839
02:06:46,561 --> 02:06:50,250
faster than I can even provide ancillary
feedback.

2840
02:06:50,270 --> 02:06:51,620
Cause my job is like,
you know,

2841
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:56,160
you hire great people who are smarter
than you and like you just guide them,

2842
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:57,390
you just point them in the right
direction.

2843
02:06:57,690 --> 02:07:02,690
So what we mostly do is create programs
where we're going out and looking for

2844
02:07:04,201 --> 02:07:06,150
new knowledge.
So for example,

2845
02:07:06,270 --> 02:07:09,000
one of the questions that is tormenting
me right now because I still don't know

2846
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:11,580
the answer is,
is there any benefit to taking human

2847
02:07:11,581 --> 02:07:13,530
growth hormone from a longevity
perspective?

2848
02:07:13,560 --> 02:07:16,620
There's clearly a performance benefit.
Growth Hormone is probably the single

2849
02:07:16,621 --> 02:07:19,380
most abused drug in all of sports.
There's no question about that.

2850
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,100
But,
um,

2851
02:07:21,390 --> 02:07:24,030
is there a way to take it where it makes
you live longer?

2852
02:07:24,090 --> 02:07:26,160
I've never prescribed growth hormone to
a patient.

2853
02:07:26,520 --> 02:07:29,100
Um,
because frankly I'm not yet confident

2854
02:07:29,101 --> 02:07:32,730
that I know the answer to that question.
But I feel like it's worth knowing,

2855
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:35,010
right?
Cause I can certainly make a teleologic

2856
02:07:35,020 --> 02:07:37,180
argument for why growth hormone can be
helpful.

2857
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:40,000
But I can also make a teleologic
argument for why it can be harmful.

2858
02:07:40,540 --> 02:07:45,540
And so like many things,
your knee jerk reaction to something can

2859
02:07:45,881 --> 02:07:46,720
often be wrong.

2860
02:07:46,750 --> 02:07:50,320
And My kneejerk reaction to growth
hormone has historically been causes

2861
02:07:50,321 --> 02:07:52,810
cancer because why?
Well,

2862
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:57,280
growth hormone tells your liver to make
igf insulin like growth factor and you

2863
02:07:57,281 --> 02:07:59,350
know,
two thirds of tumors seem to thrive on

2864
02:07:59,351 --> 02:08:02,530
igf.
So ostensibly you would think,

2865
02:08:02,531 --> 02:08:03,940
well,
growth hormone can't be right.

2866
02:08:03,941 --> 02:08:07,390
But then one of my analysts,
Bob Kaplan pointed out to me a year ago,

2867
02:08:07,391 --> 02:08:07,841
he's like,
you know,

2868
02:08:07,841 --> 02:08:08,860
Peter,
I've been thinking about this.

2869
02:08:08,861 --> 02:08:11,770
And he's like,
given how ubiquitous growth hormone is

2870
02:08:11,771 --> 02:08:14,200
in sports and how long it's been
ubiquitous in sports,

2871
02:08:14,201 --> 02:08:15,160
like,
I mean,

2872
02:08:15,490 --> 02:08:20,490
this was the drug that turned around us
Olympic athletes in the late seventies,

2873
02:08:20,621 --> 02:08:22,110
early eighties.
Um,

2874
02:08:22,180 --> 02:08:23,290
he's like,
where's the body count?

2875
02:08:24,190 --> 02:08:28,060
Like we're all of these people dying of
cancer from all these years of

2876
02:08:28,061 --> 02:08:29,830
staggering growth hormone use.

2877
02:08:30,660 --> 02:08:31,260
Yeah,

2878
02:08:31,260 --> 02:08:32,430
I,
we don't really see it.

2879
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:34,500
When we went back and looked at
literature,

2880
02:08:34,740 --> 02:08:37,890
I mean,
we found that the data on growth hormone

2881
02:08:37,891 --> 02:08:41,550
and igf are not nearly as straight
forward as people have made it out to

2882
02:08:41,551 --> 02:08:42,780
be.
In fact,

2883
02:08:42,781 --> 02:08:43,500
there's,
uh,

2884
02:08:43,500 --> 02:08:44,970
I mean,
I could draw it actually for you,

2885
02:08:44,971 --> 02:08:46,260
not that anyone who won't necessarily
see this,

2886
02:08:46,261 --> 02:08:47,730
but at least you'll see what I'm talking
about.

2887
02:08:48,120 --> 02:08:53,120
If this is percentile so higher,
and this is igf level,

2888
02:08:54,990 --> 02:08:55,770
right?
So,

2889
02:08:55,770 --> 02:08:57,810
okay.
Igf Level,

2890
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:59,520
most people are listening to this.
Oh,

2891
02:08:59,521 --> 02:09:02,610
actually it's talking about that before.
Yeah.

2892
02:09:02,850 --> 02:09:07,850
So the overall mortality curve for igf
and growth hormone is like a j curve,

2893
02:09:11,940 --> 02:09:15,990
meaning low igfs really high mortality.

2894
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:17,350
Okay.

2895
02:09:17,350 --> 02:09:19,960
Yes.
As you go from about the 70th or 80th

2896
02:09:19,961 --> 02:09:24,100
percentile up to the 90th percentile,
there's a slight increase in mortality.

2897
02:09:24,610 --> 02:09:27,190
But this is not what you would think of.
Like you would sort of,

2898
02:09:27,250 --> 02:09:29,890
if you were just reading the headlines,
you would think it looks like this.

2899
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:31,570
Right?
So there's a sweet spot.

2900
02:09:32,020 --> 02:09:33,260
Not only that,
if you,

2901
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:36,760
this is overall mortality.
What if you parse this out by disease?

2902
02:09:36,970 --> 02:09:38,560
Well,
that's when it gets really interesting.

2903
02:09:38,830 --> 02:09:41,140
So cancer's curve looks like this.

2904
02:09:42,710 --> 02:09:44,060
Very similar.
Yes.

2905
02:09:44,180 --> 02:09:49,180
But Alzheimer's curve looks like this
heart disease curve looks like this.

2906
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:54,160
So describe that to people that are
listening.

2907
02:09:54,170 --> 02:09:56,060
So what that means is,
so for example,

2908
02:09:56,061 --> 02:10:00,650
Alzheimer's disease and heart disease
have an almost monotonic reduction in

2909
02:10:00,651 --> 02:10:02,930
risk.
As igf gets higher and higher and

2910
02:10:02,931 --> 02:10:05,660
higher,
it's only cancer that seems to have that

2911
02:10:05,720 --> 02:10:08,600
uptick.
We're risk starts to actually rise once

2912
02:10:08,601 --> 02:10:11,480
you cross past the call at 70th
percentile.

2913
02:10:12,020 --> 02:10:14,690
And so when you integrate all of these
curves together,

2914
02:10:14,691 --> 02:10:18,140
that's why you see this slight uptick.
Now again,

2915
02:10:18,141 --> 02:10:20,600
this is epidemiology,
so one has to take this with a grain of

2916
02:10:20,601 --> 02:10:22,850
salt,
but this is to me,

2917
02:10:22,851 --> 02:10:25,400
when I saw this graph,
which Bob put together,

2918
02:10:25,580 --> 02:10:27,470
I don't know,
a while ago I was like,

2919
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:30,290
wait a minute,
this doesn't jive with my preconceived

2920
02:10:30,291 --> 02:10:34,940
notion of like growth hormone is bad.
This warrants way further exploration.

2921
02:10:35,540 --> 02:10:40,370
And so what that basically turned into
is now an enormous internal project that

2922
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:44,480
will take us probably a year to complete
and we'll constantly be updated.

2923
02:10:44,481 --> 02:10:47,030
Like we did this already with
testosterone two years ago.

2924
02:10:47,031 --> 02:10:51,230
We put together like a 40 page white
paper on the topic and then at least

2925
02:10:51,231 --> 02:10:55,330
once every two weeks it gets updated.
Every time a new paper comes out and

2926
02:10:55,460 --> 02:10:58,430
basically asking the question like,
is testosterone replacement beneficial

2927
02:10:58,431 --> 02:11:01,880
or harmful and under what situations
should it be considered versus not?

2928
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:05,010
And again,
the goal is to do this and emotionally,

2929
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:10,480
and that's hard to do because for
reasons I'm not entirely clear on

2930
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:13,880
basically everyone's kind of just
emotional about this stuff.

2931
02:11:13,960 --> 02:11:17,110
Well there are emotional about steroids
because of all the press about Barry

2932
02:11:17,111 --> 02:11:21,050
bonds and you know,
all the different baseball players that

2933
02:11:21,100 --> 02:11:21,990
got caught with it.
Is,

2934
02:11:21,991 --> 02:11:22,824
is it,
is it getting,

2935
02:11:23,050 --> 02:11:25,420
is it the cheating aspect of it?
100%.

2936
02:11:25,450 --> 02:11:26,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

2937
02:11:26,351 --> 02:11:30,820
I think that's exactly what it is.
I think people consider taking any kind

2938
02:11:30,821 --> 02:11:32,920
of hormone,
whether it's growth hormone or

2939
02:11:32,921 --> 02:11:36,580
testosterone as cheating.
Even if you're talking about older

2940
02:11:36,581 --> 02:11:38,500
people that take it like,
uh,

2941
02:11:38,520 --> 02:11:39,400
I was,
uh,

2942
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,590
looking at one of those ads,
you know,

2943
02:11:41,591 --> 02:11:44,530
they have those ads for hormone
replacement that is really old looking,

2944
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,710
Jeffry life I think.
Is that his name?

2945
02:11:46,720 --> 02:11:49,300
Doctor Life Jack.
And he's fucking,

2946
02:11:49,301 --> 02:11:51,940
he's got a full six pack controlled like
a gorilla.

2947
02:11:52,510 --> 02:11:53,343
And,
uh,

2948
02:11:53,410 --> 02:11:54,700
my friend was like,
God,

2949
02:11:54,701 --> 02:11:55,720
that can't be healthy.
I'm like,

2950
02:11:55,721 --> 02:11:58,030
what the fuck are you talking about?
Look at him.

2951
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:00,700
I go,
what do you think a 70 year old dude is

2952
02:12:00,701 --> 02:12:01,750
supposed to look like?

2953
02:12:01,900 --> 02:12:03,970
They're supposed to be knocking on
death's door.

2954
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:07,150
That guy looks like he could fuck his
way through a building full of teenage

2955
02:12:07,151 --> 02:12:08,290
girls.
You know?

2956
02:12:08,300 --> 02:12:11,140
He's like,
I shouldn't say teenage 20 year old,

2957
02:12:11,440 --> 02:12:16,440
21 or 19.
He looks like a man who's really fit and

2958
02:12:17,261 --> 02:12:19,900
healthy with an old guy's head.
Yeah,

2959
02:12:20,050 --> 02:12:22,090
it's weird.
And I was like,

2960
02:12:22,120 --> 02:12:23,560
you know,
if it's not healthy,

2961
02:12:23,561 --> 02:12:25,930
then what is it?
If that's not healthy,

2962
02:12:25,931 --> 02:12:26,171
like,
oh,

2963
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:28,150
he's going to die of cancer.
He's going to die of a heart attack.

2964
02:12:28,390 --> 02:12:30,430
He's going to die.
Period.

2965
02:12:30,670 --> 02:12:32,980
If you look at his head,
how much time would you give him?

2966
02:12:32,981 --> 02:12:35,380
I gave you a,
if I gave you a bet,

2967
02:12:35,680 --> 02:12:37,840
okay,
we have $1 million bet.

2968
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:41,170
Uh,
give you an over under of 10 years.

2969
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:42,820
How many,
how many years are you going to give

2970
02:12:42,821 --> 02:12:44,800
this guy?
You're going to give him 20.

2971
02:12:45,090 --> 02:12:45,900
You gonna give them,

2972
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:46,241
wait,
wait,

2973
02:12:46,241 --> 02:12:48,460
you're moving the over under,
you said I had the only,

2974
02:12:48,520 --> 02:12:50,190
I had a 10 year window on that.
Right.

2975
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:52,450
You get,
you get to tell you take over.

2976
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:54,690
I'll take over on the tenure.
Okay.

2977
02:12:55,060 --> 02:12:56,680
Um,
what do you,

2978
02:12:56,710 --> 02:12:59,140
how many years would give them
impossible to know if,

2979
02:12:59,280 --> 02:13:01,120
am I allowed to talk to him first?
No,

2980
02:13:01,300 --> 02:13:02,590
no,
no fucking clue.

2981
02:13:02,840 --> 02:13:04,150
You're looking at a magazine,
right?

2982
02:13:04,210 --> 02:13:04,370
No,
no,

2983
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:06,220
no I can't because I got to know his
family history.

2984
02:13:06,280 --> 02:13:09,640
I mean honestly they of course your
parents will tell me more about how long

2985
02:13:09,641 --> 02:13:14,641
you'll live then what you look at.
70 in America is basically death's door.

2986
02:13:15,040 --> 02:13:16,300
No,
I think today.

2987
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:17,950
Well,
so that's a complicated question

2988
02:13:17,951 --> 02:13:19,690
actually,
which is actually prompts another

2989
02:13:19,691 --> 02:13:22,150
analysis who just kicked off in the 10
year range.

2990
02:13:22,210 --> 02:13:22,960
Yeah,
no.

2991
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:23,391
So it,
it,

2992
02:13:23,391 --> 02:13:25,240
it,
it depends how you ask the question.

2993
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:29,080
So the question is what is the average
life expectancy of a man and a woman

2994
02:13:29,081 --> 02:13:30,160
today in the United States?
And I,

2995
02:13:30,161 --> 02:13:31,860
I mean,
someone's going to correct me,

2996
02:13:31,861 --> 02:13:33,930
so I feel like it doesn't matter what I
say.

2997
02:13:34,110 --> 02:13:38,160
I think it's 79 and 81 respectively for
a man and a woman today.

2998
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:41,070
But the more interesting question is
this one,

2999
02:13:41,310 --> 02:13:42,720
which is,
so what year were you born?

3000
02:13:42,900 --> 02:13:47,900
67 okay,
so in 1967 what was the annual life

3001
02:13:48,301 --> 02:13:51,030
expectancy or the average life
expectancy of a man and a woman?

3002
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:53,730
And we could look that up,
but I'm guessing it would have been.

3003
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:56,310
Let's see,
life expectancy has been going up at 0.3

3004
02:13:56,311 --> 02:13:59,550
to 0.6% per year.
We could back out that kegger and let's

3005
02:13:59,551 --> 02:14:04,551
just say for shits and giggles,
like the number was 60 69 or 73 or

3006
02:14:05,071 --> 02:14:07,680
something like that.
I promise you,

3007
02:14:07,681 --> 02:14:09,000
you are going to live longer than that.

3008
02:14:09,450 --> 02:14:11,530
What was it?
67 67 all right,

3009
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,590
so do,
would I take the bet that you're going

3010
02:14:14,591 --> 02:14:18,690
to live longer than 67 even though that
was the median life expectancy the year

3011
02:14:18,691 --> 02:14:20,430
you were born?
Hell yeah.

3012
02:14:20,431 --> 02:14:24,390
I'll take that all day long.
And so what we're actually putting,

3013
02:14:24,420 --> 02:14:27,060
this isn't just a dumb analysis we do.
I don't even know why we're doing this.

3014
02:14:27,061 --> 02:14:29,160
Sometimes we just do dumb shit that has
no bearing.

3015
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:34,250
But what I want to do is create a graph
of actual life expectancy as realized

3016
02:14:35,101 --> 02:14:38,370
versus projected life expectancy in the
year of birth.

3017
02:14:38,550 --> 02:14:41,550
My hypothesis is that is always a
positive number.

3018
02:14:41,730 --> 02:14:44,550
What I want to know is what's the
derivative on it?

3019
02:14:44,551 --> 02:14:49,551
Is it increasing or decreasing?
So I think that science is accelerating

3020
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:56,960
our longevity and that that's one of my
proof points is that we are constantly

3021
02:14:57,930 --> 02:15:00,420
underestimating how long we can live.
Now,

3022
02:15:01,170 --> 02:15:05,220
on the other end of that spectrum,
I am not one of these futurists who

3023
02:15:05,221 --> 02:15:07,170
thinks like there's in mortality out
there.

3024
02:15:07,530 --> 02:15:09,330
You know,
I would be,

3025
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:12,690
if right now I could sign a piece of
paper that would say,

3026
02:15:12,691 --> 02:15:14,600
Peter,
are you willing to commit to a lifespan

3027
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:17,010
right now?
So you're willing to acknowledge that if

3028
02:15:17,011 --> 02:15:19,140
there's some major breakthrough,
you'll miss out on it.

3029
02:15:19,350 --> 02:15:22,770
But I guarantee you this duration,
like what would you take right now if I

3030
02:15:22,771 --> 02:15:23,460
said,
Joe,

3031
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:27,990
you can be a hundred and and be fully
functional at a hundred so when you're a

3032
02:15:27,990 --> 02:15:29,460
hundred you're going to get run.
Yeah,

3033
02:15:29,790 --> 02:15:32,730
you're going to be like,
you're going to be like a fit 60 year

3034
02:15:32,731 --> 02:15:34,950
old at a hundred.
So you're still working out.

3035
02:15:35,100 --> 02:15:37,470
You're still shooting pretty good.
Yeah.

3036
02:15:37,471 --> 02:15:38,790
Would you take it?
Nope.

3037
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:41,760
In other words,
you're willing to bet that by the time

3038
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:42,594
we get there.
Yeah.

3039
02:15:42,610 --> 02:15:44,550
Because when it's over it's over anyway.
Yeah.

3040
02:15:44,790 --> 02:15:49,350
Yeah.
So I mean to me I think most people have

3041
02:15:49,351 --> 02:15:54,351
a greater sense of confidence about
where technology goes now that I think

3042
02:15:54,811 --> 02:15:57,810
they're really only been a handful of
step function changes in longevity.

3043
02:15:57,990 --> 02:15:59,310
So,
um,

3044
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:01,890
you know,
the production of infant mortality was

3045
02:16:01,891 --> 02:16:03,720
huge.
Like once we actually figured out how

3046
02:16:03,721 --> 02:16:06,120
the fuck to deliver babies and not kill
moms,

3047
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:11,430
like that was a big deal that had a step
function improvement in human longevity.

3048
02:16:12,180 --> 02:16:15,930
The next one was really sanitation.
Like once we figured out that like don't

3049
02:16:15,931 --> 02:16:19,790
shit where you drink huge improvement in
human mortality.

3050
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:21,120
Hilarious.
It's amazing.

3051
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:22,710
Right?
Then we take that shit for granted now.

3052
02:16:22,711 --> 02:16:25,410
Right.
And then the third one was basically

3053
02:16:25,411 --> 02:16:27,120
germ theory.
You know,

3054
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:30,370
starting with lister and going all the
way to Fleming when we figured out like,

3055
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:32,950
you know,
if you,

3056
02:16:33,790 --> 02:16:37,030
if you cut open a cadaver and then go
and deliver a baby,

3057
02:16:37,060 --> 02:16:38,530
that's bad.
Um,

3058
02:16:38,710 --> 02:16:41,140
because there were these microscopic
things that none of us anticipate,

3059
02:16:41,141 --> 02:16:43,090
right?
We haven't had a step function

3060
02:16:43,091 --> 02:16:45,550
improvement in mortality and nearly a
hundred years.

3061
02:16:46,570 --> 02:16:48,640
So what's next?

3062
02:16:49,180 --> 02:16:51,370
Now I think there were a couple of
potentials for that,

3063
02:16:52,120 --> 02:16:55,150
but what I don't know as if like they're
going to happen in my lifetime,

3064
02:16:55,151 --> 02:16:57,910
in your lifetime,
but I want to buy the optionality to

3065
02:16:57,911 --> 02:17:01,420
stick around for it by doing all this
incremental little shit.

3066
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:06,990
It will these three plus papers a day
and the options are increasing.

3067
02:17:07,530 --> 02:17:09,590
It's,
it's just seems to me that it's,

3068
02:17:09,870 --> 02:17:11,110
there's a trend,
right?

3069
02:17:11,180 --> 02:17:12,040
The trend is,
as you,

3070
02:17:12,041 --> 02:17:14,350
as you're saying,
there is an increase of longevity,

3071
02:17:14,351 --> 02:17:15,810
but it's not a huge increase.
Right.

3072
02:17:16,170 --> 02:17:18,640
Um,
but our understanding of the human body

3073
02:17:18,970 --> 02:17:20,350
is,
that's,

3074
02:17:20,410 --> 02:17:23,080
that seems to be pretty radically
improving,

3075
02:17:24,090 --> 02:17:26,860
especially in terms of nutrition,
nutritional absorption and the

3076
02:17:26,861 --> 02:17:30,370
mechanisms behind nutrition on some
level.

3077
02:17:30,371 --> 02:17:32,170
Yeah.
And on some level I still feel like

3078
02:17:32,171 --> 02:17:36,140
we're in the dark ages because you
recognize the potential or you know?

3079
02:17:36,220 --> 02:17:37,053
No,
because I think,

3080
02:17:37,290 --> 02:17:41,080
I think I'm just humbled by how hard it
is to actually take care of people.

3081
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:44,620
Like I,
I think so I was about,

3082
02:17:44,650 --> 02:17:48,130
I'm about as good or responder is you're
going to have to carbohydrate reduction.

3083
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:52,360
So doing something as simple as just not
eating carbs and not eating sugar,

3084
02:17:52,361 --> 02:17:57,361
like completely changed my health.
I mean at 40 if you compare the 40 year

3085
02:17:57,581 --> 02:18:02,581
old me to the 30 year old me,
like the 40 year old is like literally

3086
02:18:02,951 --> 02:18:07,780
twice as healthy as the 30 year old me.
And that was through something as simple

3087
02:18:07,810 --> 02:18:11,420
conceptually simple as making this
radical dietary shifts.

3088
02:18:11,530 --> 02:18:14,890
And by what standards are you saying
that you're twice as healthy at 40 than

3089
02:18:14,891 --> 02:18:18,370
30 how will you now 45 and but what,
what is the,

3090
02:18:18,890 --> 02:18:22,690
I mean again,
I'm speaking a bit glibly even let's

3091
02:18:22,691 --> 02:18:23,810
just talk objective.
Yeah.

3092
02:18:23,811 --> 02:18:25,570
Yeah.
So like what would be my lip had levels,

3093
02:18:25,571 --> 02:18:29,200
what would be my triglyceride levels?
How much body fat do I have?

3094
02:18:29,200 --> 02:18:32,710
What's my vo two Max like by all of
those metrics,

3095
02:18:32,711 --> 02:18:35,230
like everything was just so much better
at 40.

3096
02:18:35,630 --> 02:18:36,463
Um,
I mean,

3097
02:18:37,420 --> 02:18:37,901
and,
and,

3098
02:18:37,901 --> 02:18:42,901
and so I've split yet I've seen a lot of
patients where you take the carbs out of

3099
02:18:43,451 --> 02:18:44,620
their diet,
it doesn't matter.

3100
02:18:44,740 --> 02:18:45,231
You know,
you,

3101
02:18:45,231 --> 02:18:46,910
you,
you felt that you,

3102
02:18:46,990 --> 02:18:48,460
you make them fast,
you do this,

3103
02:18:48,461 --> 02:18:50,230
you know,
the only thing that you just can't fix

3104
02:18:50,260 --> 02:18:52,690
some of the underlying metabolic
problems.

3105
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:54,550
Like what kind of problems?
No,

3106
02:18:54,551 --> 02:18:59,551
I think some people are just so insulin
resistant that it becomes really hard to

3107
02:19:00,191 --> 02:19:03,220
fix them without doing draconian stuff.
I mean,

3108
02:19:03,221 --> 02:19:07,750
I have one patient who he's really now I
think going to in many ways become the

3109
02:19:07,751 --> 02:19:10,750
poster child for,
he's definitely the toughest case I've

3110
02:19:10,751 --> 02:19:15,751
ever had and why he's such an amazing
guy is he was actually able to do

3111
02:19:15,851 --> 02:19:19,360
something that's really hard to do,
which is stick to something with

3112
02:19:19,361 --> 02:19:21,550
complete blind faith in me.

3113
02:19:21,850 --> 02:19:24,460
Even when it didn't feel good,
even when I knew it would take a long

3114
02:19:24,461 --> 02:19:26,950
time to see the results.
So he,

3115
02:19:27,170 --> 02:19:32,170
he's probably five foot eight ways to 35
at the start.

3116
02:19:32,271 --> 02:19:35,090
So five,
eight to 35 metabolic syndrome,

3117
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:40,100
huge amount of fatty liver disease.
I'm not the typical patient in my

3118
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:41,960
practice.
Most of my patients are kind of young,

3119
02:19:41,961 --> 02:19:43,950
healthy people who want to like,
you know,

3120
02:19:43,970 --> 02:19:46,760
want this and mortality thing.
But um,

3121
02:19:47,090 --> 02:19:51,770
this is someone who doesn't fit that
description probably 70 years old,

3122
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:53,680
uh,
on like,

3123
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:54,501
you know,
for drugs,

3124
02:19:54,501 --> 02:19:57,560
for blood pressure,
10 gregory heavy for a seven year old.

3125
02:19:57,590 --> 02:19:58,310
Yeah,
it is.

3126
02:19:58,310 --> 02:19:58,911
Yeah.
Oh,

3127
02:19:58,911 --> 02:20:00,740
and his,
and he just had a hip replacement.

3128
02:20:00,950 --> 02:20:02,660
You basically couldn't walk,
you know,

3129
02:20:02,661 --> 02:20:06,200
everything was,
and we had tried carbohydrate

3130
02:20:06,201 --> 02:20:08,120
restricting him before.
It just didn't work.

3131
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:09,770
And part of it was,
I don't know how he just,

3132
02:20:09,771 --> 02:20:11,540
it was hard for him to stick to it and
go about,

3133
02:20:11,560 --> 02:20:12,351
so I just said to him,
look,

3134
02:20:12,351 --> 02:20:14,870
man,
I want to try something completely

3135
02:20:14,871 --> 02:20:19,040
fucking extreme and I want to try it for
six months,

3136
02:20:19,970 --> 02:20:22,340
every five days per me.

3137
02:20:22,430 --> 02:20:26,150
Every month you're going to spend the
first five days eating 500 calories a

3138
02:20:26,151 --> 02:20:29,870
day of a ketogenic diet.
And it's basically just going to be like

3139
02:20:29,871 --> 02:20:30,780
vegetables,
oil.

3140
02:20:30,781 --> 02:20:34,520
Like you're basically eating a bunch of
salad and then for the next 25 days

3141
02:20:34,521 --> 02:20:37,820
you're going to do a time restricted
ketogenic diet where you're only going

3142
02:20:37,821 --> 02:20:41,990
to eat in that eight hour window and
then you're going to repeat that every

3143
02:20:41,991 --> 02:20:44,660
month for six months.
And he was like,

3144
02:20:44,661 --> 02:20:46,610
I won't be able to do it.
And I was like,

3145
02:20:46,611 --> 02:20:47,360
I know,
I know.

3146
02:20:47,360 --> 02:20:50,180
It seems crazy.
I think you will be able to do it

3147
02:20:50,750 --> 02:20:53,090
because remember all that time that
you're not eating,

3148
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,460
your body's going to have to start
eating itself.

3149
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:58,590
And so you'll be all right.
And the,

3150
02:20:58,660 --> 02:21:01,220
I'm giving you a grossly over simplified
version of what we did,

3151
02:21:01,221 --> 02:21:02,780
but it was much more complicated than
that.

3152
02:21:02,780 --> 02:21:05,090
There's a bunch of other stuff that we
had to do to manage it as well.

3153
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:07,100
Well,
I mean,

3154
02:21:07,101 --> 02:21:09,380
he just sent me,
I mean we were in touch all the way

3155
02:21:09,381 --> 02:21:11,270
along,
so it was clear that this was working,

3156
02:21:11,271 --> 02:21:15,050
but it was just kind of amazing to get a
picture from him two weeks ago as we

3157
02:21:15,051 --> 02:21:18,770
just past that six month mark,
he weighs a buck 75 whoa,

3158
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:22,070
that's 60 pounds in six months.
Holy Shit.

3159
02:21:22,160 --> 02:21:23,660
His liver,
this is,

3160
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,240
and that's interesting,
but not nearly as interesting to me is

3161
02:21:26,241 --> 02:21:30,440
the fact that his trans amylases,
which are the enzymes that the liver

3162
02:21:30,441 --> 02:21:33,350
makes in response to how much fat is
accumulating.

3163
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:36,080
You know,
normal is like less than 40.

3164
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:39,050
He was like in the hundreds and you
know,

3165
02:21:39,051 --> 02:21:41,450
the ultrasound showed it was just a
bunch of fat and he doesn't drink

3166
02:21:41,451 --> 02:21:43,370
alcohol.
So we knew it was fatty liver,

3167
02:21:43,371 --> 02:21:44,780
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,
you know,

3168
02:21:44,781 --> 02:21:47,510
now he's in the twenties and thirties,
um,

3169
02:21:47,540 --> 02:21:48,890
blood pressures,
previous diet.

3170
02:21:49,160 --> 02:21:51,110
What was he eating?
Standing normal dude.

3171
02:21:51,140 --> 02:21:52,520
Yeah.
Just to say he wasn't a particularly

3172
02:21:52,521 --> 02:21:53,600
junk food,
you know,

3173
02:21:53,601 --> 02:21:55,940
he wasn't a junkie guy.
The problem is he was metabolically

3174
02:21:55,941 --> 02:21:57,860
broken.
So I'll come back to why I felt like

3175
02:21:57,861 --> 02:22:01,250
this was unnecessary intervention,
despite how draconian it was.

3176
02:22:01,670 --> 02:22:04,880
Um,
he's on a treadmill 30 minutes a day

3177
02:22:04,881 --> 02:22:06,230
now.
He couldn't walk before.

3178
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:08,600
I mean,
you take 60 pounds off the treadmill.

3179
02:22:08,601 --> 02:22:10,610
You mean walking in?
She walks on a treadmill now.

3180
02:22:10,910 --> 02:22:13,150
Yeah.
You can't really recently once you get

3181
02:22:13,160 --> 02:22:14,950
the hip replacement.
Yeah.

3182
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:17,480
Um,
so it's just,

3183
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:19,410
it's basically reprogrammed him and,
and,

3184
02:22:19,411 --> 02:22:23,150
and so the reason I have occasionally
pulled that trick out,

3185
02:22:23,330 --> 02:22:27,390
although it hasn't always,
is based on this case study I read

3186
02:22:27,391 --> 02:22:28,760
that's very famous.
I'm sure some,

3187
02:22:28,780 --> 02:22:30,360
I'm,
there's gotta be someone in this show

3188
02:22:30,361 --> 02:22:32,130
who's talked about it,
but it was,

3189
02:22:32,131 --> 02:22:36,750
um,
the paper was published in either the

3190
02:22:36,750 --> 02:22:38,550
early seventies or late sixties,
but it was the longest ever medically

3191
02:22:38,551 --> 02:22:39,450
supervised fast.

3192
02:22:39,480 --> 02:22:43,110
So it was this guy who weighed somewhere
between 375 and 400 pounds.

3193
02:22:43,410 --> 02:22:48,410
He did a 382 day inpatient medical fast
where he had only water and minerals.

3194
02:22:49,320 --> 02:22:51,810
At the end of that,
something like 382 days,

3195
02:22:52,320 --> 02:22:56,610
he was down from,
call it 400 to a buck 65 this paper was

3196
02:22:56,611 --> 02:23:01,260
published seven years later he weighed
like a buck 70 a buck 75 the crazy thing

3197
02:23:01,261 --> 02:23:03,300
about that guys,
it's skin track to,

3198
02:23:03,410 --> 02:23:05,670
yeah,
so he didn't have that problem that a

3199
02:23:05,671 --> 02:23:08,460
lot of people have when they lose a lot
of weight where they have all this extra

3200
02:23:08,461 --> 02:23:11,850
skin,
his skin went along with his body.

3201
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:14,070
Yeah.
And I wonder if that's just due to

3202
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:15,390
genetic elasticity.
Yeah,

3203
02:23:15,391 --> 02:23:16,980
exactly.
I would like to know,

3204
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:19,410
I'd like to know if he had stretch marks
when it shrank.

3205
02:23:19,730 --> 02:23:20,880
You know?
You know,

3206
02:23:20,881 --> 02:23:23,280
it's funny,
I've never tried to figure out like

3207
02:23:23,281 --> 02:23:24,630
whatever came of that patient.

3208
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:26,310
I can't imagine he'd be alive now
though.

3209
02:23:26,311 --> 02:23:28,150
I know he was young at the time,
but the,

3210
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:33,160
the part that interested me was that he
didn't regain all the weight seven years

3211
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:35,850
later and that suggested that there was
a,

3212
02:23:36,270 --> 02:23:38,070
like it was a reprogram.
I was like,

3213
02:23:38,071 --> 02:23:39,900
you've got the blue screen of death on
the computer.

3214
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:43,710
Did the hard reset.
You got to be a new person again because

3215
02:23:43,920 --> 02:23:47,580
I'm not of the camp that thinks like
that guy got to be 400 pounds just

3216
02:23:47,581 --> 02:23:51,930
because he was a glutton and a slot,
like something fundamentally broke in

3217
02:23:51,931 --> 02:23:55,800
that dude.
And what broke was he basically lost the

3218
02:23:55,801 --> 02:23:58,650
ability to partition fueled correctly.
Now,

3219
02:23:58,770 --> 02:24:01,230
could food play a role in that?
Absolutely.

3220
02:24:01,290 --> 02:24:03,390
Certainly if you eat enough shit that
can happen.

3221
02:24:03,770 --> 02:24:05,520
Um,
but I think it's more complicated than

3222
02:24:05,521 --> 02:24:06,930
that.
I think it can be epigenetic,

3223
02:24:07,230 --> 02:24:09,120
uh,
if not outright genetic but probably

3224
02:24:09,121 --> 02:24:10,170
more epigenetic.

3225
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:13,920
Um,
and so I'm interested in this idea of

3226
02:24:13,921 --> 02:24:16,380
how do you reset people.
Um,

3227
02:24:16,710 --> 02:24:18,420
and again,
this is all kind of long winded way of

3228
02:24:18,421 --> 02:24:22,530
saying like,
one of the advantages of practicing

3229
02:24:22,531 --> 02:24:25,680
medicine is you get to you,
you say humble because every,

3230
02:24:25,681 --> 02:24:27,570
every time you think you're smart and
you're like,

3231
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:29,460
I got this shit figured out.
Like,

3232
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:31,500
you know,
there's like some patient who's got a

3233
02:24:31,501 --> 02:24:34,440
problem that you can't figure out and it
just drives you nuts.

3234
02:24:34,830 --> 02:24:37,170
But you realize like,
I mean even just today,

3235
02:24:37,171 --> 02:24:38,730
I was talking to a friend of mine,
he's not a patient,

3236
02:24:38,731 --> 02:24:41,430
but I mean my God,
he's just going through like this

3237
02:24:41,431 --> 02:24:43,830
devastating health situation.
He's been,

3238
02:24:43,860 --> 02:24:46,110
he has seen every doctor,
he's been to mass general,

3239
02:24:46,111 --> 02:24:48,120
he's been to Stanford,
he's been to hopkins,

3240
02:24:48,121 --> 02:24:49,920
he's been to the best hospitals in this
country.

3241
02:24:50,160 --> 02:24:53,340
They can't fucking come close to figure
out what's wrong with this guy.

3242
02:24:54,450 --> 02:24:59,450
And so as bad as that is for him,
I think that level of humility is

3243
02:24:59,641 --> 02:25:02,520
actually good for the profession.
It's good to what is going on with him

3244
02:25:02,521 --> 02:25:04,950
that they can't figure it out.
He's having these horrible neurologic

3245
02:25:04,951 --> 02:25:07,860
symptoms where he gets these for
circulations and muscle weakness.

3246
02:25:07,861 --> 02:25:11,890
And obviously the big concern about six
months ago when this started was he,

3247
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:14,010
he was presenting like he had Lou
Gehrig's disease,

3248
02:25:14,580 --> 02:25:17,340
which you know,
obviously is about as bad a fade as you

3249
02:25:17,341 --> 02:25:18,930
can have.
Um,

3250
02:25:19,320 --> 02:25:23,010
luckily that has been ruled out and
they've done a million muscle biopsies

3251
02:25:23,020 --> 02:25:25,720
and all these other things,
but they don't know what's going on.

3252
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:29,070
Has He altered his tie and he's taking,
no,

3253
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:30,730
no.
We don't know what's going on.

3254
02:25:31,540 --> 02:25:33,790
It's,
it is certainly far outside of my area

3255
02:25:33,791 --> 02:25:34,601
of expertise.
I mean,

3256
02:25:34,601 --> 02:25:36,070
what we talked about today was,
look,

3257
02:25:36,071 --> 02:25:38,560
man,
all we really need to be doing is fixing

3258
02:25:38,561 --> 02:25:39,580
your symptoms at this point.

3259
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:41,890
In other words,
there's understanding what's causing

3260
02:25:41,891 --> 02:25:43,750
this and then managing the symptoms
around it.

3261
02:25:44,050 --> 02:25:46,030
I think the smartest people in the
country had figured out,

3262
02:25:46,031 --> 02:25:47,770
they have no goddamn clue what's going
on.

3263
02:25:47,980 --> 02:25:50,080
Let's now figure out how to manage your
symptoms,

3264
02:25:50,081 --> 02:25:51,700
your energy levels,
your mood,

3265
02:25:51,701 --> 02:25:53,020
all of these other things.
What has,

3266
02:25:53,021 --> 02:25:54,880
what has he done for that?
Well,

3267
02:25:54,881 --> 02:25:55,870
I told him today,
I was like,

3268
02:25:55,871 --> 02:25:56,920
look,
I'm going to send you a kit.

3269
02:25:56,921 --> 02:25:59,740
We're going to do a certain blood test
on you and a certain urine test on you,

3270
02:25:59,741 --> 02:26:03,260
and I want to just figure out what's
going on with your four hormone systems.

3271
02:26:03,261 --> 02:26:06,820
There's basically four hormone systems
play a pretty big role in how we feel

3272
02:26:07,150 --> 02:26:09,940
and adjusting those dozen,
I'm not convinced it necessarily makes

3273
02:26:09,941 --> 02:26:11,590
you live longer,
but it can certainly make you live

3274
02:26:11,591 --> 02:26:13,660
better.
So I want to kind of understand.

3275
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:17,560
I suspect he's not firing on all
cylinders on that dimension.

3276
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:21,490
Whether it's a result of whatever is
going on that nobody can figure out or

3277
02:26:21,491 --> 02:26:23,980
not.
But I'd rather focus on something that I

3278
02:26:23,981 --> 02:26:26,320
think we can fix.
Yeah.

3279
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:29,560
The,
the change in diet thing with that guy

3280
02:26:29,590 --> 02:26:34,060
where he went and fasted for 360 plus
days,

3281
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:37,450
what did he eat when he got back on
food?

3282
02:26:37,780 --> 02:26:40,060
Great question.
I do not know the answer now.

3283
02:26:40,061 --> 02:26:41,320
That might be that,
that just,

3284
02:26:41,350 --> 02:26:46,350
I don't recall that being in the paper,
but if it wasn't,

3285
02:26:46,541 --> 02:26:48,190
I don't know if anybody did the follow
up,

3286
02:26:48,191 --> 02:26:50,230
but that's,
to me that's the interesting question to

3287
02:26:50,490 --> 02:26:52,900
kind of feel amazing.
Like he got his life back,

3288
02:26:52,901 --> 02:26:53,734
right?
Like,

3289
02:26:54,010 --> 02:26:55,630
and my recollection is he was a young
man.

3290
02:26:55,660 --> 02:26:57,100
He was in his late twenties,
I think.

3291
02:26:57,250 --> 02:26:58,780
Yeah.
I believe I remember that as well.

3292
02:26:58,840 --> 02:26:59,673
I think,
um,

3293
02:27:00,010 --> 02:27:03,220
I would like to find out what he's
eating now to keep his weight at the

3294
02:27:03,221 --> 02:27:04,054
same level.

3295
02:27:04,450 --> 02:27:06,310
I mean,
he must just be so thankful.

3296
02:27:06,311 --> 02:27:07,450
First of all,
you might be like,

3297
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,780
I mean,
I have friends that are pretty

3298
02:27:10,781 --> 02:27:15,730
overweight and one that died pretty
recently who was really big and he just

3299
02:27:15,731 --> 02:27:18,520
had this feeling when he would meet
people.

3300
02:27:18,940 --> 02:27:20,440
I mean,
you talked about it a little bit,

3301
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:24,220
it was just obese.
It was just this thing where you're

3302
02:27:24,221 --> 02:27:25,001
just,
Oh,

3303
02:27:25,001 --> 02:27:28,540
look at this enormous fat guy.
And then to go from that to,

3304
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:29,793
oh,
there's a guy,

3305
02:27:30,340 --> 02:27:31,520
there's normal guy.
Yeah,

3306
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:33,820
that's just a guy.
It's 168 pound guy.

3307
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:35,920
Normal.
No difference between the hand.

3308
02:27:35,940 --> 02:27:38,070
I gotta Tell Ya,
I know we,

3309
02:27:38,071 --> 02:27:40,930
we love that.
We love to beat up on fat people.

3310
02:27:41,320 --> 02:27:43,390
We love to turn it into a character
defect.

3311
02:27:43,391 --> 02:27:47,800
But I gotta tell you virtually every fat
person that I know or that I've taken

3312
02:27:47,801 --> 02:27:50,950
care of,
they are not disproportionately eating

3313
02:27:50,951 --> 02:27:53,230
more than their peers in some cases,
yes,

3314
02:27:53,380 --> 02:27:55,480
but not unbalanced it.

3315
02:27:55,520 --> 02:28:00,250
The problem is that they simply do
everything incorrectly,

3316
02:28:00,280 --> 02:28:01,930
metabolically,
you know,

3317
02:28:01,931 --> 02:28:05,200
so their body is functioning correctly
and it's,

3318
02:28:05,230 --> 02:28:07,600
you know,
there's a genetic component.

3319
02:28:07,630 --> 02:28:11,260
I think there are dietary exacerbations.
I think certainly not exercising makes

3320
02:28:11,261 --> 02:28:13,060
things worse.
So there are lots of predisposing

3321
02:28:13,061 --> 02:28:14,500
factors,
but at the end of the day what's

3322
02:28:14,501 --> 02:28:17,920
happening is when you and I eat like
let's,

3323
02:28:17,950 --> 02:28:21,350
let's take a meal that,
that like if you had pancakes and

3324
02:28:21,351 --> 02:28:23,450
scrambled eggs,
that would be like a really good mix of,

3325
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:25,550
that'd be a third carbs,
a third protein,

3326
02:28:25,551 --> 02:28:27,980
a third fat.
So it's like a shit ton of nutrient,

3327
02:28:27,981 --> 02:28:30,500
right?
If you or I ate that,

3328
02:28:30,650 --> 02:28:32,090
yeah,
it probably wouldn't be that good for

3329
02:28:32,091 --> 02:28:33,170
us.
But like we,

3330
02:28:33,210 --> 02:28:34,970
you know,
let's say we just finished a workout or

3331
02:28:34,971 --> 02:28:39,140
something like we're going to partition
such that that glycogen will first and

3332
02:28:39,141 --> 02:28:43,340
foremost go to replace the muscle and
liver stores of glycogen because we have

3333
02:28:43,341 --> 02:28:45,860
bigger muscles and our muscles are more
insulin sensitive.

3334
02:28:46,070 --> 02:28:49,400
We can actually disproportionately put
more glycogen into our muscles,

3335
02:28:49,520 --> 02:28:51,170
into the leg muscles,
cause you'll have done that,

3336
02:28:51,171 --> 02:28:52,370
run up the hills.
Right.

3337
02:28:52,970 --> 02:28:54,770
And,
and then furthermore,

3338
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:59,720
when we want to recruit energy again,
we'll have the ability to actually go

3339
02:28:59,721 --> 02:29:01,040
back and get fat.
Especially,

3340
02:29:01,090 --> 02:29:01,641
you know,
in other words,

3341
02:29:01,641 --> 02:29:06,641
break down fat at lower atp demands than
necessarily always going to glycogen.

3342
02:29:07,010 --> 02:29:09,620
So in other words,
we partition fuel in a smarter way.

3343
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:12,590
And these patients,
I mean you can measure this clinically

3344
02:29:12,591 --> 02:29:16,430
using something called rer and of course
doing other blood tests,

3345
02:29:17,060 --> 02:29:18,380
like they just,
they just,

3346
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:22,280
they can't break down their own fat.
So their body is essentially broken in

3347
02:29:22,281 --> 02:29:24,710
that regard.
And that can be fixed with,

3348
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:27,740
with diet.
It's a hard problem because the way I

3349
02:29:27,741 --> 02:29:31,190
explain it to people is,
and so clinically I'm not interested in

3350
02:29:31,191 --> 02:29:32,060
weight loss,
right?

3351
02:29:32,061 --> 02:29:35,540
I mean that's just not,
I'm much more interested in longevity

3352
02:29:35,750 --> 02:29:37,550
and yeah,
sometimes weight loss comes with that,

3353
02:29:37,551 --> 02:29:41,000
but I like if I ever get stuck doing
weight loss,

3354
02:29:41,001 --> 02:29:41,834
like I'll,
I'll,

3355
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:43,400
I'm doing the wrong thing for my
interest.

3356
02:29:43,760 --> 02:29:46,190
But um,
the way I say to people when they want

3357
02:29:46,191 --> 02:29:47,300
to lose weight is,
look,

3358
02:29:47,301 --> 02:29:48,890
you don't want to lose weight.
You want to lose fat.

3359
02:29:49,070 --> 02:29:51,590
Let's,
let's be very clear on our semantics.

3360
02:29:51,860 --> 02:29:53,840
It weight is irrelevant,
right?

3361
02:29:53,841 --> 02:29:57,140
Unless you're a cyclist or some athlete
for whom the actual scale means

3362
02:29:57,141 --> 02:29:57,900
something.
But for,

3363
02:29:57,900 --> 02:29:59,870
for people like us,
it's you want to lose fat,

3364
02:29:59,880 --> 02:30:01,760
not wait.
And then when you say you want to lose

3365
02:30:01,761 --> 02:30:02,990
fat,
what does that mean in English?

3366
02:30:03,950 --> 02:30:05,900
Well,
do you want fewer fat cells or do you

3367
02:30:05,901 --> 02:30:09,590
want each fat cell to be smaller?
Those are totally different questions.

3368
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,930
If you want fewer fat cells have
liposuction,

3369
02:30:12,890 --> 02:30:14,780
but we know that that doesn't fix you
metabolically.

3370
02:30:14,781 --> 02:30:17,870
So if you want fewer,
if you want to be less fat,

3371
02:30:17,900 --> 02:30:22,730
you have to have smaller fat cells.
Now at fat cell conceptually has two

3372
02:30:22,731 --> 02:30:23,900
inputs and one output.

3373
02:30:24,500 --> 02:30:27,020
So now I say,
let's reframe the question.

3374
02:30:27,230 --> 02:30:28,960
You've got a room with a hundred people
in it.

3375
02:30:28,961 --> 02:30:32,330
You want fewer people in the room.
What has to happen?

3376
02:30:32,900 --> 02:30:35,000
More people have to leave the room,
then enter the room.

3377
02:30:35,740 --> 02:30:37,700
So similarly,
if you have a fat cell and you want it

3378
02:30:37,701 --> 02:30:40,100
to be less fat,
you've got to get more fat out of it.

3379
02:30:40,101 --> 02:30:43,190
Then enters it.
And the fact that exits the cell exits

3380
02:30:43,191 --> 02:30:47,240
via a process called lipolysis and the
inputs to a fat cell or something called

3381
02:30:47,241 --> 02:30:50,180
De Novo Lipogenesis,
which is turning carbohydrates into fat.

3382
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:53,000
And Reyes tariffs location,
which is turning fat,

3383
02:30:53,030 --> 02:30:56,420
like in a free fatty acid into a
triglyceride back into a fat cell.

3384
02:30:56,990 --> 02:30:59,540
Each of those three doors is controlled
by hormones.

3385
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:05,800
And so the purpose of nutrition or
fasting or exercise or drugs or hormones

3386
02:31:06,951 --> 02:31:10,610
or all these things is to manipulate
those hormones in the direction of what

3387
02:31:10,611 --> 02:31:15,050
I call negative fat flux or what would
be referred to in the literature as fat

3388
02:31:15,051 --> 02:31:16,580
balance,
negative fat balance.

3389
02:31:17,150 --> 02:31:20,070
And the hormones that drive that are are
insulin,

3390
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:21,840
hormone sensitive lipase,
testosterone,

3391
02:31:21,841 --> 02:31:25,110
estrogen,
cortisol being the five most important

3392
02:31:25,111 --> 02:31:26,400
in my opinion.
Uh,

3393
02:31:26,430 --> 02:31:28,740
maybe someone will disagree with that,
but I think those are the five that

3394
02:31:28,741 --> 02:31:30,240
ruled the roost.
And so,

3395
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:33,510
you know,
how do you manipulate those?

3396
02:31:33,570 --> 02:31:35,610
Well,
insulin seems to be the most important

3397
02:31:35,611 --> 02:31:40,080
of the five and there's no better way to
lower insulin than to not eat.

3398
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:45,980
So the first thing that happened to that
dude who went 382 days without anything

3399
02:31:46,681 --> 02:31:50,910
but water and minerals is he basically
had very low insulin levels.

3400
02:31:51,420 --> 02:31:53,820
In fact,
once he got into raging Ketosis,

3401
02:31:53,821 --> 02:31:58,821
which he got into by about day seven,
his insulin came up only to prevent him

3402
02:31:59,161 --> 02:32:03,360
from going into Ketoacidosis,
which was what would happen if he had no

3403
02:32:03,361 --> 02:32:04,560
insulin response.
In other words,

3404
02:32:04,561 --> 02:32:07,470
if he was a type one diabetic,
he would have died if ketoacidosis,

3405
02:32:07,770 --> 02:32:11,640
because he wouldn't have had the insulin
to regulate the uptick of ketones.

3406
02:32:11,850 --> 02:32:14,220
But if you are,
I did this because we have a normal

3407
02:32:14,221 --> 02:32:17,550
pancreas.
We would actually remake just enough

3408
02:32:17,551 --> 02:32:22,551
insulin to suppress key to genesis and
keep that Beta hydroxy butyrate level in

3409
02:32:22,561 --> 02:32:23,340
the,
you know,

3410
02:32:23,340 --> 02:32:27,270
kind of in the neighborhood of probably
seven or eight millimolar as opposed to

3411
02:32:27,271 --> 02:32:30,270
getting north of 12 to 15,
which is when you get into trouble.

3412
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,880
So,
you know,

3413
02:32:33,630 --> 02:32:36,870
how do you manipulate insulin?
Nutrition is the first way.

3414
02:32:36,871 --> 02:32:39,570
If you can't fast,
the next best thing is to reduce

3415
02:32:39,571 --> 02:32:41,340
carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates,

3416
02:32:41,341 --> 02:32:43,560
obviously you're the most insulinogenic
of food,

3417
02:32:43,710 --> 02:32:45,900
although protein can be quite
insulinogenic as well.

3418
02:32:45,901 --> 02:32:48,180
It has a different response.
Um,

3419
02:32:48,510 --> 02:32:50,700
and then that's when you start to think
about these other things.

3420
02:32:50,701 --> 02:32:53,580
You know,
I've seen patients where they just can't

3421
02:32:53,581 --> 02:32:56,070
lose weight and I watch what they're
doing and they're doing everything

3422
02:32:56,071 --> 02:32:58,050
right,
but they just can't lose weight.

3423
02:32:58,350 --> 02:33:00,600
But then you notice their cortisol
levels through the roof.

3424
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:03,930
It's hard to get rid of fat when you
have lots of cortisol.

3425
02:33:03,931 --> 02:33:08,931
Cortisol is a very anabolic hormone to
fat and a very catabolic hormone to

3426
02:33:09,601 --> 02:33:11,340
muscle,
which is the exact opposite of what we

3427
02:33:11,341 --> 02:33:12,690
want to stop.
The drone,

3428
02:33:12,691 --> 02:33:16,770
of course is the exact opposite.
Testosterone is catabolic to fat but

3429
02:33:16,771 --> 02:33:19,440
anabolic to muscle.
Um,

3430
02:33:19,620 --> 02:33:20,820
and then of course,
you know,

3431
02:33:20,821 --> 02:33:23,670
women have a harder time because once
women go through menopause,

3432
02:33:24,210 --> 02:33:26,490
they lose all the estrogen and all the
testosterone.

3433
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:30,420
And so now they lose two hormones that
play a very important role in regulating

3434
02:33:30,421 --> 02:33:32,880
this.
So for these people that are having the

3435
02:33:32,881 --> 02:33:37,030
issue with cortisol levels,
that's exacerbated by stress.

3436
02:33:37,031 --> 02:33:40,920
Right?
So stress actually exacerbates your

3437
02:33:40,921 --> 02:33:42,390
weight gain.
Absolutely.

3438
02:33:43,740 --> 02:33:47,370
That's interesting.
In addition to a whole bunch of other

3439
02:33:47,371 --> 02:33:49,710
stuff,
literally eat the same diet and gain

3440
02:33:49,711 --> 02:33:51,150
more weight because of stress.

3441
02:33:51,210 --> 02:33:53,010
Absolutely.
Wow.

3442
02:33:53,670 --> 02:33:55,920
Again,
hormones are what's driving fuel

3443
02:33:55,921 --> 02:33:57,390
partitioning.
You know,

3444
02:33:57,630 --> 02:34:00,120
you're responsible for what you put in
your mouth,

3445
02:34:00,510 --> 02:34:04,140
but in many ways at that point,
like the hormones take over and decide

3446
02:34:04,141 --> 02:34:06,480
where it's going.
Wow.

3447
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:08,790
That's fascinating.
Now you yourself,

3448
02:34:08,820 --> 02:34:10,230
what,
what's your diet like?

3449
02:34:10,260 --> 02:34:12,060
I mean you,
you told me you only eat once a day,

3450
02:34:12,061 --> 02:34:14,520
but yeah,
I'm one one meal a day or sometimes two

3451
02:34:14,521 --> 02:34:16,560
meals a day.
How many calories you're taking in,

3452
02:34:18,200 --> 02:34:19,600
you know,
nowhere near what I used to.

3453
02:34:19,601 --> 02:34:21,130
I just don't train that much anymore.
I mean,

3454
02:34:21,131 --> 02:34:23,650
I kind of lift three days a week and
then I,

3455
02:34:24,070 --> 02:34:27,880
I ride like a stationary bike,
like a Peloton or I prefer this thing

3456
02:34:27,881 --> 02:34:30,310
called a Whoa who kicker where you
actually put your bike on it.

3457
02:34:30,460 --> 02:34:32,080
So I'll do that three or four times a
week.

3458
02:34:32,680 --> 02:34:36,160
Um,
I would guess when I sit down to throw

3459
02:34:36,161 --> 02:34:37,990
down,
it's probably 3000 calories

3460
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:40,720
in one meal,
Huh?

3461
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:42,760
Yeah.
Although the problem is I'm a fucking

3462
02:34:42,761 --> 02:34:44,950
pig,
like I'm kinda discussed and like I can

3463
02:34:44,951 --> 02:34:45,751
eat a lot.
It's,

3464
02:34:45,751 --> 02:34:47,680
it's gross.
Like I gross people out of how much I

3465
02:34:47,681 --> 02:34:49,040
can eat.
It's pretty,

3466
02:34:49,570 --> 02:34:53,680
for me to only eat 3000 calories in a
sitting is like tame.

3467
02:34:54,010 --> 02:34:54,610
Really?
Yeah.

3468
02:34:54,610 --> 02:34:54,971
Yeah.
No,

3469
02:34:54,971 --> 02:34:56,740
I have an eating disorder.
Really.

3470
02:34:56,980 --> 02:35:00,100
I mean I sort of,
I think I have disordered eating.

3471
02:35:00,160 --> 02:35:01,000
Yeah.
I,

3472
02:35:01,470 --> 02:35:04,390
I'm seems like you just enjoy it because
you do it once a day.

3473
02:35:04,750 --> 02:35:06,270
No,
under any circumstance.

3474
02:35:06,271 --> 02:35:09,550
Like I stress eat,
I um,

3475
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:13,750
I do get a dope.
Like I don't get a dopamine high from

3476
02:35:13,840 --> 02:35:18,840
gambling or alcohol.
Like I don't like those things are not

3477
02:35:20,111 --> 02:35:23,530
things that I can abuse.
Like when I'm really in a shitty place

3478
02:35:23,531 --> 02:35:25,420
in life,
like I,

3479
02:35:26,230 --> 02:35:29,590
I sued and punish myself with food.
A lot of people do.

3480
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:32,950
So you could relate and as a thin man,
you know,

3481
02:35:32,951 --> 02:35:35,860
when you're talking to people that are
large and have the same issue,

3482
02:35:36,460 --> 02:35:38,410
it's a good thing to know its toll.

3483
02:35:38,410 --> 02:35:40,450
I mean,
I completely understand what these

3484
02:35:40,451 --> 02:35:43,690
people are going through,
but at least in as much as what the,

3485
02:35:44,410 --> 02:35:46,600
as the,
as the physiologic desire for it.

3486
02:35:46,601 --> 02:35:48,550
I mean,
obviously they will experience something

3487
02:35:48,551 --> 02:35:51,190
even worse because there's the,
like I can like,

3488
02:35:51,191 --> 02:35:53,110
look,
I don't have abs on,

3489
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:55,630
I don't have veins in my abs anymore.
I used to,

3490
02:35:55,660 --> 02:35:57,400
when I was in a ketogenic diet,
you know,

3491
02:35:57,401 --> 02:36:00,040
7% body fat,
I was completely ripped.

3492
02:36:00,190 --> 02:36:01,510
I'm not ripped anymore,
you know,

3493
02:36:01,540 --> 02:36:04,030
relative to that,
that kind of bugs me.

3494
02:36:04,031 --> 02:36:05,350
But like nobody really knows that.
I mean,

3495
02:36:05,351 --> 02:36:08,470
nobody really gives a shit.
So I can still like look like a super

3496
02:36:08,471 --> 02:36:10,540
healthy dude,
a super lean dude,

3497
02:36:10,541 --> 02:36:12,430
even if I'm not.
Um,

3498
02:36:12,970 --> 02:36:15,910
but oh my God,
like when Shit's going wrong,

3499
02:36:15,911 --> 02:36:19,390
like I want to eat some of the worst
foods that have ever been created.

3500
02:36:20,650 --> 02:36:21,100
You know what I mean?

3501
02:36:21,100 --> 02:36:24,550
Why is that instinct there?
Why is the instinct that when you're not

3502
02:36:24,551 --> 02:36:27,880
feeling like for me it's tired.
Like if I'm tired,

3503
02:36:27,881 --> 02:36:30,070
like if I'm coming home from a Gig and
it's two o'clock in the morning,

3504
02:36:30,071 --> 02:36:32,410
it's very difficult for me to drive past
Wednesday's,

3505
02:36:32,920 --> 02:36:34,990
you know,
I want to go to Wendy's and Reno.

3506
02:36:35,150 --> 02:36:36,700
That could be,
that could be a course that could be an

3507
02:36:36,701 --> 02:36:39,010
adrenal issue.
So a lot of times we'll see when people

3508
02:36:39,700 --> 02:36:43,570
either turn to sugar or salt in times of
fatigue,

3509
02:36:43,571 --> 02:36:45,110
a lot of times it can be,
uh,

3510
02:36:45,160 --> 02:36:47,050
you know,
they don't have the right level of free

3511
02:36:47,051 --> 02:36:50,500
cortisol at that moment in time.
I always feel it's a willpower issue

3512
02:36:50,570 --> 02:36:53,510
because if I could just get home,
I'll cook something healthy and then I

3513
02:36:53,511 --> 02:36:55,610
have victory,
you know,

3514
02:36:57,550 --> 02:36:59,800
cause if I get home,
I know I've got healthy food at home,

3515
02:36:59,801 --> 02:37:02,620
I eat something really good and it's
just as good.

3516
02:37:02,620 --> 02:37:05,650
But there's something about also there's
like you doing something,

3517
02:37:05,651 --> 02:37:06,820
you know,
you shouldn't do,

3518
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:09,460
there's a little weird little charge
there.

3519
02:37:09,461 --> 02:37:10,271
Yeah,
that's interesting.

3520
02:37:10,271 --> 02:37:11,830
I mean,
I guess it's different for different

3521
02:37:11,831 --> 02:37:13,180
people.
I think for me,

3522
02:37:13,570 --> 02:37:15,560
if I'm really going to be brutally about
it,

3523
02:37:15,561 --> 02:37:16,670
I think it's that I,
like,

3524
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:18,830
I sometimes just want to punish myself
and I'm like,

3525
02:37:18,831 --> 02:37:22,880
you know,
like eating bad food is like when you're

3526
02:37:22,881 --> 02:37:24,060
bad,
you eat bad food,

3527
02:37:24,090 --> 02:37:26,720
you give yourself a cheat day.
Um,

3528
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:28,190
you know,
I don't,

3529
02:37:28,191 --> 02:37:29,930
not really,
I mean,

3530
02:37:29,990 --> 02:37:32,080
I think these days and you know,
you've got kids,

3531
02:37:32,140 --> 02:37:34,670
so you know what I mean?
Cheat Day is just present themselves

3532
02:37:34,671 --> 02:37:37,580
often enough or other reasons.
And unfortunately,

3533
02:37:38,030 --> 02:37:41,870
I think for me the cheat meals are a lot
of times cleaning up a kid's plate or

3534
02:37:41,871 --> 02:37:43,100
something like that.
You know,

3535
02:37:43,101 --> 02:37:44,150
like,
like,

3536
02:37:44,180 --> 02:37:45,530
I mean,
the funny thing is I just,

3537
02:37:45,560 --> 02:37:48,080
I really don't know why I just like
shitty food.

3538
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:50,450
Like I like macaroni and cheese.
I just,

3539
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,860
if they don't eat their macaroni and
cheese,

3540
02:37:51,861 --> 02:37:54,110
I got to eat it.
My kids asked me to make them peanut

3541
02:37:54,111 --> 02:37:56,090
butter and jelly the other day and they
don't,

3542
02:37:56,150 --> 02:37:58,970
each is really good.
It's fucking fantastic.

3543
02:37:58,971 --> 02:38:01,880
Especially with the glass of milk.
They don't need the crusts.

3544
02:38:01,881 --> 02:38:02,361
And I'm like,
well,

3545
02:38:02,361 --> 02:38:03,350
he's crushed.
Shouldn't go.

3546
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,660
Oh God,
this happens in Africa.

3547
02:38:05,661 --> 02:38:08,210
That shit eat that crow.
So I ate the Krug and I thought about

3548
02:38:08,211 --> 02:38:10,430
all the bread with peanut butter and
Jelly.

3549
02:38:10,431 --> 02:38:13,490
I ate in those cross.
I basically had a fucking sandwich.

3550
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:15,920
It's like I'm pretending that I'm just
eating a little,

3551
02:38:15,921 --> 02:38:17,450
cried a lot.
I'm worse than you,

3552
02:38:17,451 --> 02:38:18,380
dude.
You know what I would've done in that

3553
02:38:18,381 --> 02:38:19,940
situation?
I would've been like peanut butter

3554
02:38:19,941 --> 02:38:22,280
jellies.
Well I would have started by saying

3555
02:38:22,340 --> 02:38:25,220
there's not enough peanut butter and jam
on these crusts too.

3556
02:38:25,230 --> 02:38:27,100
Like I don't have the right ratio.
So I would have like got out of the

3557
02:38:27,101 --> 02:38:29,330
peanut butter and the jam and dip the
crust in there and like,

3558
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:30,500
and then I would've probably made a
sandwich.

3559
02:38:30,530 --> 02:38:32,150
I'm just happy that I didn't need a
sandwich.

3560
02:38:32,151 --> 02:38:35,900
I'm of my own as well as their cross
cause I probably cook once,

3561
02:38:36,140 --> 02:38:40,760
once the fucking gates are open.
Once I'm out there making spaghetti and

3562
02:38:40,761 --> 02:38:41,900
meatballs like,
all right,

3563
02:38:41,930 --> 02:38:43,880
let's get some fucking ice cream in
Hispanics too.

3564
02:38:44,380 --> 02:38:46,220
You know,
what's a Merde fucking off?

3565
02:38:46,590 --> 02:38:47,990
Um,
so what do you,

3566
02:38:48,110 --> 02:38:50,570
what do you eat,
like when you sit down for these 3000

3567
02:38:50,571 --> 02:38:51,880
calorie meals?
Uh,

3568
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:54,860
so if I'm in control of the meal,
which I usually am and I'm,

3569
02:38:54,861 --> 02:38:56,870
I'm super boring dude,
so it's,

3570
02:38:56,871 --> 02:38:59,080
um,
I like to have a salad in a bowl.

3571
02:38:59,081 --> 02:39:01,140
It's larger than my head.
Um,

3572
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:03,140
so I was referred to that as a manly
bowl.

3573
02:39:03,170 --> 02:39:07,040
That's the definition of a manly bowl.
So it's gotta be like a staggering

3574
02:39:07,041 --> 02:39:10,010
amount of salad.
And my salad is the same every freaking

3575
02:39:10,011 --> 02:39:11,540
day.
It's Romaine lettuce,

3576
02:39:11,570 --> 02:39:12,403
it's,
you know,

3577
02:39:12,410 --> 02:39:13,430
tomatoes,
mushrooms,

3578
02:39:13,431 --> 02:39:15,170
cucumbers,
carrots.

3579
02:39:15,500 --> 02:39:17,510
And then the dressing is just extra
virgin olive oil,

3580
02:39:17,511 --> 02:39:21,320
freshly squeezed lemon salt and pepper.
So it's pretty bland salad in that

3581
02:39:21,321 --> 02:39:22,154
sense.
But I mean,

3582
02:39:22,370 --> 02:39:24,170
I can eat that all day,
every day.

3583
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:28,970
And then it's a serving of protein and I
usually cycle through salmon,

3584
02:39:29,300 --> 02:39:31,340
pork,
steak,

3585
02:39:31,610 --> 02:39:33,680
you know,
get some Gamey meat,

3586
02:39:33,710 --> 02:39:36,620
like whatever.
I just sort of cycled through that and

3587
02:39:36,621 --> 02:39:39,620
then I usually have some sort of starchy
vegetable to go with it.

3588
02:39:39,710 --> 02:39:41,330
So,
um,

3589
02:39:41,540 --> 02:39:43,040
potato,
rice.

3590
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:44,900
You know,
lately the last couple of weeks I've

3591
02:39:44,901 --> 02:39:48,980
been skipping the starch and just
mainlining extra salad and extra

3592
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,050
protein.
Um,

3593
02:39:51,800 --> 02:39:53,720
but you know,
but,

3594
02:39:53,730 --> 02:39:56,420
but that's insane.
That's what I'm in San Diego where I

3595
02:39:56,421 --> 02:39:58,160
have control over what I eat more in New
York.

3596
02:39:58,160 --> 02:40:01,640
I never eat in my apartment.
Like I just never cook,

3597
02:40:01,670 --> 02:40:05,990
so I always go out and there it's a
little less regulated.

3598
02:40:05,991 --> 02:40:06,621
So,
I mean,

3599
02:40:06,621 --> 02:40:08,510
I just love Indian food.
I love Persian food.

3600
02:40:08,511 --> 02:40:10,220
I love food.
That unfortunately is,

3601
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:13,100
you know,
got more carbs in it then I'm probably

3602
02:40:13,440 --> 02:40:15,870
for,
but I try to modify.

3603
02:40:15,871 --> 02:40:20,871
So like last week I had um,
this Bob who's actually one of my,

3604
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:22,650
my head analyst,
he lives in Boston.

3605
02:40:22,651 --> 02:40:24,060
He came down to New York for a couple of
days.

3606
02:40:24,061 --> 02:40:26,130
We were doing some work and we went out
for,

3607
02:40:26,131 --> 02:40:29,400
he loves Indiana and I live in and so we
went out for Indian one night and we

3608
02:40:29,401 --> 02:40:33,960
hadn't eaten all day.
So we ordered I think seven or eight

3609
02:40:33,970 --> 02:40:37,260
entrees and the waiter is like,
you know,

3610
02:40:37,650 --> 02:40:39,720
uh,
you guys,

3611
02:40:39,780 --> 02:40:41,670
no you ordered seven or eight entrees,
right?

3612
02:40:41,671 --> 02:40:42,240
We're like,
yeah,

3613
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:43,073
we got it.
We got it,

3614
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:43,973
we're good.

3615
02:40:44,130 --> 02:40:44,881
And so,
you know,

3616
02:40:44,881 --> 02:40:48,270
we sort of skipped the non or maybe had
one non to split instead of,

3617
02:40:48,271 --> 02:40:51,510
normally I would've had like four nuns
and only had one bowl of rice.

3618
02:40:51,930 --> 02:40:54,060
But still a lot of carbs.
It is.

3619
02:40:54,061 --> 02:40:54,540
Yeah.
Yeah.

3620
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:58,020
Naan bread is insane.
Luckily babied more of it than I did and

3621
02:40:58,021 --> 02:41:00,990
he's way more jacked than me,
so he can get away with eating way more

3622
02:41:01,260 --> 02:41:03,060
non than me.
Um,

3623
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:04,350
but yeah,
that night,

3624
02:41:04,380 --> 02:41:07,320
I mean also those sauces are like so
fatty.

3625
02:41:07,470 --> 02:41:09,990
Like I'm sure that was a 4,000 calorie
throw down.

3626
02:41:10,890 --> 02:41:12,940
Um,
the other thing I'm,

3627
02:41:12,970 --> 02:41:15,540
I'm pretty good about is when I'm done,
I'm done.

3628
02:41:16,020 --> 02:41:19,140
So that's the other thing about time
restricted feeding that I think I get

3629
02:41:19,141 --> 02:41:22,950
away with more because like when I go
back to my apartment,

3630
02:41:22,980 --> 02:41:26,940
I will rarely have another bite.
And when I wake up in the morning,

3631
02:41:26,941 --> 02:41:28,650
it's like black coffee,
you know,

3632
02:41:28,651 --> 02:41:31,260
I'm not sneaking little shit in
throughout the day.

3633
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:33,780
Like,
whereas if I'm not fasting,

3634
02:41:33,810 --> 02:41:37,480
it's just too easy for me to just like
skip stuff.

3635
02:41:37,700 --> 02:41:39,810
Oh yeah.
Like in my office,

3636
02:41:39,811 --> 02:41:44,280
like I shared my office in New York,
I share with another doctor who is his

3637
02:41:44,281 --> 02:41:44,821
office.
Actually.

3638
02:41:44,821 --> 02:41:48,660
I kind of sublet an office there,
but like I've never seen more shit in my

3639
02:41:48,661 --> 02:41:50,640
life.
Like then the stuff patients bring for

3640
02:41:50,641 --> 02:41:55,641
him to eat and patients bring him shitty
food nonstop doctor.

3641
02:41:56,100 --> 02:41:58,650
Of course they're trying to torture him
for torture and now,

3642
02:41:58,651 --> 02:42:00,360
I dunno maybe,
but it's like,

3643
02:42:00,361 --> 02:42:02,340
you know,
are drug reps will bring stuff by or

3644
02:42:02,341 --> 02:42:03,270
something like that.
There's just like,

3645
02:42:03,330 --> 02:42:05,760
there's an endless barrage of bad food
to eat,

3646
02:42:05,910 --> 02:42:07,140
but it's like good,
bad food.

3647
02:42:07,350 --> 02:42:09,540
Delicious.
Like if they were bringing like Oreos

3648
02:42:09,541 --> 02:42:12,780
that actually wouldn't tempt me despite
the monkey homecooked Brownie.

3649
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:13,793
Yeah,
exactly.

3650
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:17,430
Like I forget the name of um,
God,

3651
02:42:17,431 --> 02:42:19,560
I can't remember the name of some of
these bakeries up there,

3652
02:42:19,561 --> 02:42:20,394
but,
but yeah,

3653
02:42:20,400 --> 02:42:24,630
there's like some ridiculous shit that
shows up and every once in a while like

3654
02:42:25,320 --> 02:42:26,100
I'm like,
okay,

3655
02:42:26,100 --> 02:42:27,930
the fastest breaking at four o'clock
today,

3656
02:42:28,650 --> 02:42:29,730
give me one of those scones.

3657
02:42:31,050 --> 02:42:33,450
But as long as you do it with
moderation,

3658
02:42:34,380 --> 02:42:35,760
you think you're okay.
Yeah.

3659
02:42:35,761 --> 02:42:38,730
Except that my motto in life is
moderation is the only thing worth doing

3660
02:42:38,731 --> 02:42:41,910
in moderation.
So the problem is once I start like,

3661
02:42:42,810 --> 02:42:45,090
it's usually the wheels come off the bus
pretty quick.

3662
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:47,220
Do you try to mitigate that with
exercise?

3663
02:42:47,221 --> 02:42:49,200
Like do you say that went off the rails
today?

3664
02:42:49,230 --> 02:42:52,110
So let's hit the gym and go hard.
It's less that it's usually I

3665
02:42:52,150 --> 02:42:54,680
anticipated.
And so like so.

3666
02:42:54,910 --> 02:42:58,620
So last week a buddy of mine went to see
the David Bowie exhibit.

3667
02:42:58,621 --> 02:42:59,730
Did you see it by the way,
that Brooklyn?

3668
02:42:59,820 --> 02:43:01,770
No.
Are you a Bowie fan at all?

3669
02:43:01,830 --> 02:43:03,180
Yeah.
Oh Dude.

3670
02:43:03,181 --> 02:43:06,480
It's there until mid June or July
Brooklyn at the Brooklyn Museum.

3671
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:09,810
It is clean a couple of weeks ago,
but I was only there for two days for

3672
02:43:09,811 --> 02:43:11,530
the UFC and I had a show out there.
Uh,

3673
02:43:12,190 --> 02:43:14,560
so probably one of the best shows I've
ever seen in my life.

3674
02:43:14,830 --> 02:43:16,360
Yeah.
Unbelievable.

3675
02:43:16,610 --> 02:43:19,600
I didn't realize it,
but like it closed at 11:00 PM and

3676
02:43:19,601 --> 02:43:20,890
they'd just didn't have the heart to
tell me.

3677
02:43:20,891 --> 02:43:24,220
So I was there until midnight before
they finally came and escorted me out of

3678
02:43:24,221 --> 02:43:24,930
the building.
They're like,

3679
02:43:24,930 --> 02:43:25,541
uh,
sir.

3680
02:43:25,541 --> 02:43:28,630
We closed an hour ago and I was like,
damn sorry man.

3681
02:43:28,940 --> 02:43:31,750
So what is it?
It's like an exhibit of all of his art,

3682
02:43:31,751 --> 02:43:33,420
all of his music,
all of,

3683
02:43:33,490 --> 02:43:34,780
and it's like,
it's done.

3684
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:37,690
You know when you go to museums and they
put the headphones on you and you have

3685
02:43:37,691 --> 02:43:39,220
to like push the button to hear the
thing.

3686
02:43:39,221 --> 02:43:42,250
It doesn't work that way.
Like whatever you stand near,

3687
02:43:42,340 --> 02:43:46,720
you get the music associated with that
plus or minus and narrative as

3688
02:43:46,721 --> 02:43:50,950
necessary.
But it was like,

3689
02:43:50,951 --> 02:43:53,860
I've never like they,
I think they had every one of his

3690
02:43:53,861 --> 02:43:55,450
costumes.
Wow.

3691
02:43:55,610 --> 02:43:57,070
It was,
it was epic.

3692
02:43:57,220 --> 02:44:00,580
So anyway,
that night I knew we were going to go

3693
02:44:00,581 --> 02:44:04,750
out for a killer dinner before in
Brooklyn before we went to the show.

3694
02:44:05,770 --> 02:44:08,170
And so normally I exercise in the
morning,

3695
02:44:08,171 --> 02:44:09,490
but that day I was like,
look,

3696
02:44:10,090 --> 02:44:12,640
I will,
your muscles will be a little bit more

3697
02:44:12,760 --> 02:44:16,630
insulin sensitive if you can exercise
about 30 minutes before you eat.

3698
02:44:16,631 --> 02:44:20,800
That's probably about the sweet spot.
So if I were to ride at like eight in

3699
02:44:20,801 --> 02:44:23,470
the morning and then not eat until seven
at night,

3700
02:44:23,500 --> 02:44:25,990
I Kinda,
I mean I would still eventually get the

3701
02:44:25,991 --> 02:44:27,850
glycogen there,
but it wouldn't be quite as easy.

3702
02:44:27,851 --> 02:44:28,960
It would require a little bit more
insulin.

3703
02:44:29,050 --> 02:44:31,780
So in that case I just modified my day
and was like,

3704
02:44:31,781 --> 02:44:33,970
you know,
made my schedule such that I could ride

3705
02:44:33,971 --> 02:44:38,380
at 5:00 PM in anticipation of that.
And I also wrote a little longer and a

3706
02:44:38,381 --> 02:44:41,980
little harder just you know,
like let's really crush this session so

3707
02:44:41,981 --> 02:44:44,350
that you know,
I can go and enjoy dinner a little bit

3708
02:44:44,351 --> 02:44:45,160
more.

3709
02:44:45,160 --> 02:44:47,530
Well it sounds like you enjoy a lot of
things.

3710
02:44:47,531 --> 02:44:49,500
You have a lot going on,
you've got your,

3711
02:44:49,820 --> 02:44:52,960
your medical practice,
you have all these different things you

3712
02:44:52,961 --> 02:44:57,490
participated in as far as athletics,
boxing and swimming and cycling.

3713
02:44:58,510 --> 02:45:02,350
What jazzes you up now?
Like what do you like,

3714
02:45:02,351 --> 02:45:04,330
how do you,
you obviously have a mind that requires

3715
02:45:04,331 --> 02:45:05,650
a lot of stimulation.
Like what,

3716
02:45:05,680 --> 02:45:08,080
what keeps you going?
Um,

3717
02:45:08,140 --> 02:45:11,890
I mean I think,
I think this longevity thing is the

3718
02:45:11,891 --> 02:45:15,850
perfect culmination of all of my
previous lives in terms of professional

3719
02:45:15,851 --> 02:45:18,550
lives.
So I mean I used to be an engineer and

3720
02:45:18,551 --> 02:45:23,551
then I went into surgery and then I left
that and went into management consulting

3721
02:45:24,131 --> 02:45:26,770
and it was a hundred like,
had nothing to do with medicine for

3722
02:45:26,771 --> 02:45:29,170
several years.
I just worked in credit risk modeling.

3723
02:45:29,740 --> 02:45:33,670
And so in many ways like when you
combine medicine with engineering,

3724
02:45:33,671 --> 02:45:37,240
with risk management,
that is what longevity is all about.

3725
02:45:37,270 --> 02:45:39,130
Like if you want to take the
practitioners,

3726
02:45:39,670 --> 02:45:43,000
you know the roll up your sleeves
approach that that's what it is.

3727
02:45:43,001 --> 02:45:47,440
So I think that scratches that itch but,
but I think for me like I have to be

3728
02:45:47,441 --> 02:45:50,440
sort of mastering something.
So that's where archery and race car

3729
02:45:50,441 --> 02:45:53,710
driving today become just total
obsessions.

3730
02:45:53,711 --> 02:45:56,080
And like when we were talking earlier,
it's like yeah,

3731
02:45:56,081 --> 02:45:58,480
I mean I don't know that I'll ever go
hunt because I don't know that I want to

3732
02:45:58,481 --> 02:46:00,370
spend three days,
you know,

3733
02:46:00,880 --> 02:46:02,980
taking 10 shots when I could be
spending,

3734
02:46:02,981 --> 02:46:06,640
you know,
three days taking 300 shots in my

3735
02:46:06,641 --> 02:46:08,050
backyard.
Like in the end,

3736
02:46:08,051 --> 02:46:13,051
I think what I really just obsess over
is trying to get better at something.

3737
02:46:13,370 --> 02:46:16,130
And the nice thing when you start things
late in life,

3738
02:46:16,131 --> 02:46:20,150
like I didn't get my racing license till
three years ago and I only picked up

3739
02:46:20,151 --> 02:46:22,520
archery two years ago or maybe a year
ago.

3740
02:46:23,030 --> 02:46:26,270
Like when you suck so much,
like the opportunity to get better is

3741
02:46:26,271 --> 02:46:30,410
awesome.
So I think the bigger itch for me is not

3742
02:46:30,411 --> 02:46:33,290
intellectual.
I think it's like tinkering.

3743
02:46:33,320 --> 02:46:35,630
It's like figuring out how to do shit
better.

3744
02:46:36,350 --> 02:46:37,183
Yeah.
I,

3745
02:46:37,240 --> 02:46:41,360
I share a similar interest and things I
suck at and that's what one of the

3746
02:46:41,361 --> 02:46:43,580
things that was so compelling to me
about archery.

3747
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:48,860
When did you start
2013?

3748
02:46:48,861 --> 02:46:51,170
I think I bought,
well I bought a bow before that,

3749
02:46:51,171 --> 02:46:52,860
but I didn't really use it.
Uh,

3750
02:46:52,880 --> 02:46:56,390
2013 I think is right when I got pretty
serious about it.

3751
02:46:57,260 --> 02:46:59,360
You had John Dudley on your show once,
didn't you?

3752
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:00,440
Yeah,
a couple times.

3753
02:47:01,070 --> 02:47:05,930
I wasn't skipping Bhutan.
I mean that shot through the handle of

3754
02:47:05,931 --> 02:47:08,150
the kettle bell was that a hundred
yards?

3755
02:47:08,180 --> 02:47:09,800
I think it was a little more,
but yeah.

3756
02:47:10,220 --> 02:47:11,870
Yeah,
that is,

3757
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:14,510
that's one of my favorite things in the
world.

3758
02:47:14,600 --> 02:47:18,230
He's helped me a lot.
He's a remarkable archery coach and it

3759
02:47:18,231 --> 02:47:21,260
just a great person to just a great guy.
One saw on Instagram,

3760
02:47:21,261 --> 02:47:23,840
him and Jocko and the uh,
they bumped into each other in an

3761
02:47:23,841 --> 02:47:26,570
airport and,
and so like I saw Jocko like two days

3762
02:47:26,571 --> 02:47:30,110
later we had coffee one day to be clear,
Jocko head tea.

3763
02:47:30,200 --> 02:47:33,020
I had coffee draco's a tea guy,
but I was like,

3764
02:47:33,021 --> 02:47:34,790
dude,
I can't believe you know John Dudley

3765
02:47:34,791 --> 02:47:36,070
goes,
I dunno.

3766
02:47:36,150 --> 02:47:39,020
He just grabbed me in the airport and I
was like,

3767
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:39,980
dude,
I,

3768
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:41,870
there's shot too.
I want to see this.

3769
02:47:42,450 --> 02:47:47,450
He did it with a lighted nock let knock
people don't have any idea how great it

3770
02:47:51,450 --> 02:47:54,860
is.
They cannot fathom what he just did.

3771
02:47:56,360 --> 02:48:00,230
I've seen him do some regular shit.
He's a bad motherfucker when it comes to

3772
02:48:00,231 --> 02:48:01,220
archery,
that's for sure.

3773
02:48:01,221 --> 02:48:02,510
And he's helped me.

3774
02:48:02,540 --> 02:48:04,280
Tremendous.
Where does he live?

3775
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:07,640
He lives in Iowa.
He moved to Iowa just so he can kill big

3776
02:48:07,641 --> 02:48:11,120
giant deer because he literally bought a
farm in Iowa,

3777
02:48:12,050 --> 02:48:15,980
giant chunk of land and raises it for,
he has,

3778
02:48:15,981 --> 02:48:20,000
he does do some farming,
but essentially what he does is raises

3779
02:48:20,001 --> 02:48:21,920
deer.
It doesn't raise him like there's no,

3780
02:48:21,950 --> 02:48:23,110
there's no fence.
Right.

3781
02:48:23,130 --> 02:48:26,120
It makes it very,
make it favorable for them to be there.

3782
02:48:26,450 --> 02:48:28,820
He has food plots that he grows.
And I mean,

3783
02:48:28,821 --> 02:48:30,320
I hunted on this place a couple of years
ago.

3784
02:48:30,321 --> 02:48:31,154
It's amazing.
It's,

3785
02:48:31,210 --> 02:48:33,410
it's an incredible place.
He loves it.

3786
02:48:33,500 --> 02:48:35,570
I just,
I remember when I bought my bow,

3787
02:48:35,750 --> 02:48:37,220
like I just sort of,
you know,

3788
02:48:37,790 --> 02:48:39,960
went into the arts,
like performance archery in San Diego is

3789
02:48:39,961 --> 02:48:41,000
like a place to go,
right?

3790
02:48:41,030 --> 02:48:42,380
Yeah.
Went in there and it was like,

3791
02:48:42,381 --> 02:48:43,280
okay,
here's what I want to do.

3792
02:48:43,281 --> 02:48:43,881
They're like,
why?

3793
02:48:43,881 --> 02:48:44,810
I'm like,
just want to do it.

3794
02:48:44,830 --> 02:48:45,441
I'm like,
okay,

3795
02:48:45,441 --> 02:48:47,630
great.
And then I remember when I got all my

3796
02:48:47,631 --> 02:48:49,280
kit and my setup and they're like,
all right,

3797
02:48:49,520 --> 02:48:52,820
you gotta go to knock on like,
you gotta just watch this dude's videos.

3798
02:48:52,821 --> 02:48:56,090
And yeah,
now he's literally the best.

3799
02:48:56,091 --> 02:48:57,810
And in terms of like,
uh,

3800
02:48:57,811 --> 02:48:59,240
the average person who is interested in
it,

3801
02:48:59,241 --> 02:49:01,850
and he's got a great podcast about it,
knock on podcast,

3802
02:49:01,851 --> 02:49:06,290
but he gets so geeky and technical and
his descriptions and his understanding

3803
02:49:06,291 --> 02:49:08,250
of it and,
and he constantly obsesses

3804
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:11,610
about form and structure and,
you know,

3805
02:49:11,611 --> 02:49:14,070
archery.
And to me,

3806
02:49:14,130 --> 02:49:18,090
my history as a martial artist,
it really jives with me.

3807
02:49:18,091 --> 02:49:19,770
It makes sense.
Cause you could do,

3808
02:49:19,860 --> 02:49:23,970
you could muscle things and do them
wrong and develop bad habits and you'll

3809
02:49:23,971 --> 02:49:28,971
never reach your full potential or you
could do things correctly and be very,

3810
02:49:29,611 --> 02:49:33,440
very disciplined and focused and
understand the what,

3811
02:49:33,450 --> 02:49:37,560
why you're doing something and then re
really actually reach your full

3812
02:49:37,561 --> 02:49:39,750
potential.
There's really no other way.

3813
02:49:39,751 --> 02:49:43,590
And with archery specifically,
it's so satisfying.

3814
02:49:43,591 --> 02:49:47,040
Like as we were saying before,
when you do pull it off and you know you

3815
02:49:47,041 --> 02:49:50,820
do execute that perfect shot with your
rhomboids and the hand goes over the

3816
02:49:50,821 --> 02:49:54,900
back shoulder and you watch that Arrow
schunk go right into that bullseye.

3817
02:49:54,901 --> 02:49:55,950
Like yes,

3818
02:49:56,080 --> 02:50:00,430
I have my daughter come out and do the
slow mo shot of me from behind.

3819
02:50:00,431 --> 02:50:04,360
I've got like a hundred of these dumb
things on my phone and it's just like I

3820
02:50:04,361 --> 02:50:06,310
can watch them all day and it's like,
did I do it that I do it?

3821
02:50:06,340 --> 02:50:07,240
Nope,
not there.

3822
02:50:07,260 --> 02:50:08,940
Right.
Oh sweet.

3823
02:50:09,870 --> 02:50:12,970
A lot of his elbow position to the
height of the elbow.

3824
02:50:12,971 --> 02:50:15,040
The elbow has to be in line with the
Arrow,

3825
02:50:15,550 --> 02:50:17,260
you know,
and sometimes people are polling but

3826
02:50:17,261 --> 02:50:20,290
they're pulling in their elbows up here
instead of way back here.

3827
02:50:20,330 --> 02:50:21,163
Yeah.
You know,

3828
02:50:21,720 --> 02:50:24,040
um,
I think that's an interesting point

3829
02:50:24,041 --> 02:50:25,210
about certain things,
right?

3830
02:50:25,211 --> 02:50:26,860
So,
so to me,

3831
02:50:26,861 --> 02:50:31,861
the other thing I like about our tree
and race car driving is you have to

3832
02:50:32,051 --> 02:50:36,310
learn some emotional discipline.
You can't get pissed off and work your

3833
02:50:36,311 --> 02:50:39,250
way through either of those things.
You can sort of get pissed off on the

3834
02:50:39,251 --> 02:50:42,520
bike and it can actually charge you,
which is not to say that cycling doesn't

3835
02:50:42,521 --> 02:50:45,280
have technique in it,
but it plays a much smaller role.

3836
02:50:45,281 --> 02:50:47,860
And in the end,
the girl factor can out trumpet,

3837
02:50:47,980 --> 02:50:52,980
but you can't grow your way out of a
shitty shot and you cannot in a car.

3838
02:50:53,681 --> 02:50:55,240
If you start getting pissed,
you're done.

3839
02:50:56,260 --> 02:50:59,200
Absolutely done.
The same thing can be said for a lot of

3840
02:50:59,201 --> 02:51:00,910
things.
I think pool is one of them.

3841
02:51:00,950 --> 02:51:02,200
That's a big one.
Golf,

3842
02:51:02,630 --> 02:51:04,000
which I don't do,
but yeah.

3843
02:51:04,300 --> 02:51:05,380
Yeah.
Listen,

3844
02:51:05,381 --> 02:51:07,090
Peter,
we just did three hours,

3845
02:51:07,091 --> 02:51:09,490
believe it or not.
I don't believe that it's two 30

3846
02:51:11,190 --> 02:51:15,010
and that crazy places at a time warp.
It really is.

3847
02:51:15,290 --> 02:51:15,771
But,
uh,

3848
02:51:15,771 --> 02:51:17,790
I really appreciate this conversation,
man.

3849
02:51:17,791 --> 02:51:19,670
It was really fun.
So thanks man.

3850
02:51:19,671 --> 02:51:21,380
Thank you.
If people want to get ahold of you on

3851
02:51:21,381 --> 02:51:23,210
twitter,
give them your twitter address,

3852
02:51:23,211 --> 02:51:24,530
your website and all that stuff.
Yeah.

3853
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:26,570
Peter Attia,
md on both e,

3854
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:27,441
t t,
t I.

3855
02:51:27,441 --> 02:51:28,120
A.
I.

3856
02:51:28,120 --> 02:51:28,700
A.
All right,

3857
02:51:28,700 --> 02:51:29,720
thanks man.
That was awesome.

3858
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:38,190
Hmm.
