1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,430
Whoever thought ice tea,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,240
whoever thought ist would wind up being
a dude in a reality show with a white

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:08,700
chick with a big ass. Who would have
thought it would come down to that.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,910
And when you're a kid of original gangster
and that reality show it some pretty

5
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,370
white lady with a big ass ice cube wall.
So yeah,

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:21,240
he's like yelling at his kids guy now
that's his, y'all keep it down back there.

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,430
That's the new ice cube.
Y'All keep it down. Damn.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,890
But scrunchy face y'all keep it down.
Damn.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,820
The Joe Rogan experience podcast
brought to you by the flashlight.

10
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:35,790
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on
the link for the flashlight and then you

11
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:39,930
enter in my last name,
they give you money or less,

12
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:44,490
you have to pay less money to get
your freak on. They give you 15% off.

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,330
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah,

14
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:48,750
it really is a great product.
Very solid product that's like legit.

15
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,580
Like it's 100% you're going to masturbate.

16
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:52,260
It's a hundred times
better than your hands.

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,781
It's,
you know,

18
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:55,270
it's one of those things where people
would give a shit about it and they have

19
00:00:55,271 --> 00:00:57,340
from the beginning, and you know,
we don't have to name names,

20
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,270
but certain people might have a vested
interest in my professional career.

21
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:02,710
I know they think, well, Joe Rogan,

22
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:05,050
I just don't think that's the
right thing to do. Joe Rogan,

23
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:08,080
that just seems like a fucking disgusting
thing to be endorsing. And I say,

24
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:08,914
how dare you?

25
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:13,660
How dare you take me a person who
has basically staked my whole fucking

26
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:16,060
existence on telling the
truth about everything,

27
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:17,680
no matter how uncomfortable it is.

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
And you want me to shut down
the rubber pussy business? Well,

29
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:23,980
I guess why the rubber pussy is
way better than fucking your hand.

30
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,110
It's just better. Guess
what? The rubber plus,

31
00:01:26,111 --> 00:01:29,050
he's probably better than a lot
of girls you've had sex with.

32
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:34,000
And that's not a joke. It's like
the best vagina ever. And it's fake.

33
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,060
Of course. It's not attached to a
human. It's not as good as having sex.

34
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:40,090
It's not like I'm asking you to
be d human or anything like that,

35
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,510
but I'm just saying if you're going to
beat off and you're going to beat off,

36
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,060
it's like a dessert. It's like vacation,
like treat yourself once in a while.

37
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,530
Like a general,
like a gentleman.

38
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,040
The only problem is you will
shoot like a real sexual load lot,

39
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,380
not like a jerking off load
and you shoot like a sex load,

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,170
so it puts you away like you,
you'll, you'll fall asleep.

41
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,950
You do have the possibility of waking
up with someone's screaming at you while

42
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:03,350
you've got the fleshlight still
on your dick and your alcohol,

43
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,460
your pants don't wear your ankles.

44
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,490
I never thought about that job because
you really do when you're fucking the

45
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,880
extra pulsing of your Dick. You know
when I get a little extra pumping,

46
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:15,110
the next up,
your body's convinced it's a real vagina.

47
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,580
Totally. You should way bigger loads and
it's way at the end of it, you're like,

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,430
you're really crash,

49
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,990
so you could do have more of a possibility
of getting busted if you pass out

50
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,600
idiot. Especially if you do it in your
office or something. Here's a tip.

51
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:31,240
Also if you, if you're going to
wash it off in your bathroom,

52
00:02:31,241 --> 00:02:34,270
I usually keep it right on my sink while
it's still, you know, drying and stuff.

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,520
Don't use your hair clippers anywhere
near it because I got a bunch of hair all

54
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:43,180
over it and it's impossible to get
like hair pieces off your flashlight.

55
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,910
So now mine looks like I had
like a five o'clock shadow.

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,740
It's creepy dude. It's
really gross. It's like the,

57
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:54,560
like late eighties when they first
started shaving, you know, we will,

58
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,310
I did Dave's old porn,
you know the David tell a thing,

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,190
which David tells sits you and you and him

60
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,750
a watch a porn films. And it's
really funny because first of all,

61
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,180
Dave could watch cartoon, he could
watch anything. And it's funny,

62
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:10,660
he's just hilarious,
but they're all bushy man.

63
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,870
This fucking Harry boxes.
It's really crazy. I like
it. Do you like that? I like,

64
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,670
I tell you what, it doesn't bother me. It
doesn't, it doesn't make me sad. You know,

65
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,260
I don't go, oh, wouldn't fuck her over.
Got Crazy box. I'd be like, your hair,

66
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:25,540
you dirty little bitch. They're still
hot. It doesn't make them less hot.

67
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,730
It's a weird aesthetic
choice that we have. We,

68
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:31,150
we've turned and essentially all
women have had to gone it go into it.

69
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,260
It's the porno look period. There's
no, no bushes anymore. Bushes are gone.

70
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,230
When was the last time he even saw
pubic hair? You see like little Tufts,

71
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,770
like a whisper of a pubic hair.
No one has a real Bush anymore,

72
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,440
but they're out there.
They just hide them.

73
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:48,190
He's fucking ugly as sin. Also that bald
motherfucking monkey at the end of it,

74
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:51,010
before you stick your Dick in it while
you're looking at you like, damn,

75
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,980
this thing looks like,
and then you have all these images.

76
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:56,290
You even giggle at times during sex.

77
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,680
You look at that fucking
monkey with that hair.

78
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,960
It has a little personality to it.
Whether it's a launch pad,

79
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,990
whether it's got that Julius
Erving, fucking look. I liked it.

80
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:08,230
You get a little sweat man. It gives
that little monkey at different Patois.

81
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:11,290
You know what I'm saying?
Especially like she used to silliness.

82
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,740
Something smells like olive oil or
something because of that and the other

83
00:04:14,741 --> 00:04:18,390
reason why women had big bushes because
they depended more conditioner women

84
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:20,170
until they want to fucking make a move.
You know what I'm saying?

85
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:23,020
They dye their hair that blonde streak
and they were out of the fucking house.

86
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:27,550
They don't use conditioner.
Who has conditioner? That hat?

87
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,580
That's what girls do. Well, a
Balsam. That was an old school.

88
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,400
You don't think girls have that shit.
You put conditioner on,

89
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:35,260
you wash it off and the
condition didn't even come up.

90
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,650
Well the conditioners like
a billion dollar market man,

91
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,100
there's a lot of chicks out there use it

92
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,420
conditioner like a big fucking,

93
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,770
we're also brought to you by on it.com
makers is Alpha brain. That's on it.

94
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,100
O. N. N. I. T. R. Hemp protein
should be out any day now as a as,

95
00:04:53,101 --> 00:04:53,934
as the kettlebells,

96
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,940
kettlebells are very difficult
to get the distribution in order.

97
00:04:56,941 --> 00:05:00,300
As you can imagine, we're sending cannon
balls to you. I mean we're sending,

98
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,480
we're sending you 70 pound
fucking cannon balls and bigger.

99
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:06,590
Some of them are even bigger than 70
pounds. They're ridiculous. And, uh,

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,390
the other crazy kettlebells that I'll
tell you about that in the future.

101
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:11,580
So the hemp protein is coming
to all that coming up very soon.

102
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,070
Alpha brain is the number one product.

103
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:18,480
The biggest one that I use that comes
out on a.com is the one that I literally,

104
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:22,620
if I go on the road and I don't have it
with me, I go, fuck, I get angry on it.

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Curious actually about the Alpha
brain. Yeah, I took it today.

106
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,880
I've got to get you some of it.

107
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:29,670
I'll get you some of it so you could
try it for yourself and tell me what you

108
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:34,650
think. You'd have a pretty extensive
experience in supplements. So I would,

109
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,620
uh, I would say you'd be
a good guy to give it to.

110
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:40,470
Have you ever fucked around
with nootropics? Do you?
Little bit. A little bit, yeah.

111
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,160
Do you ever try a Roman ASCII stuff? And
not yet. Actually, I have it saved, uh,

112
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,950
from listening to you guys and
you talk about his is really good.

113
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,130
His has a little bit of caffeine too. If
so, if you're into, if you want to be,

114
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,320
I believe it does.
I want them to speak it speak,

115
00:05:52,321 --> 00:05:55,980
but it's called neuro run and I recommend
that as well. There's a all by the way,

116
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,230
the ingredients Alpha brain, if you know,
if you're like, oh, it's too expensive,

117
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:03,770
but Bubba, look, steal the
ingredients. It's real simple.

118
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,610
You can see them on the bottles,
it's listed online. Go there,

119
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,090
find out what it is buying in bulk and
save yourself some money. I swear to God,

120
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,640
if you're happy and
you're, you know, you're,

121
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:15,520
you're feeling good from
all this stuff and you're,

122
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,720
you're experiencing a
benefit from nootropics.

123
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:21,670
I don't even care when we're
much more concern. Hmm.

124
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,480
I just took them right there.

125
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,200
We're much more concerned with
people not feeling ripped off.

126
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:31,880
This is also why we have a 100% money
back guarantee on the first order of 30

127
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:35,510
pills that you buy. When you
buy it. You try it out, you go,

128
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:38,560
I don't feel like that was worth it. You
don't even have to send it back. Just,

129
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,430
you just tell us and
you get your money back.

130
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:45,431
We are trying as hard as humanly possible
to not rip anybody off and to sell

131
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:49,130
something that I believe in.
And then I've been using for a long time.

132
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,980
I'm a big advocate of nutrition.

133
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,600
I'm a big advocate of vitamins and
supplements and eating healthy foods and a

134
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:01,480
lot of fresh vegetables and get your
fido nutrients in and, and you know,

135
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,350
a healthy bacteria in
your body like probiotics.

136
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:11,180
I'm a big fan of acidophilus and I'm
a big fan of nootropics and if you're,

137
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,280
if you're interested in any of this stuff,
please Google it. It's n o, t, r, O, p.

138
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:17,360
I. C, that's the word.

139
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:21,560
Nootropic a lot of controversy
on it at one both ways. You know,

140
00:07:21,561 --> 00:07:25,610
both sides of interesting arguments
for me. I've had excellent results. Uh,

141
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,800
I believe in him 100% and uh,

142
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,330
that's why I endorse on it and that's
why on it is a sponsor of the podcast.

143
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,160
There's a bunch of different
other supplements on it.

144
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,660
One of them's called shroom tech sport.

145
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,380
There's going to be a big two page
article about that and fighters only.

146
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,800
I'm excited about that. They just
sent it to me. They have a day. Um,

147
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,270
people fucking love it.

148
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:48,200
It's one of the best supplements I have
ever used as far as like endurance as

149
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,140
far as like giving you energy while
you work out. It's got a quarter steps,

150
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:54,770
mushrooms in it and a ton of 12 and
a lot of other shit. And like I said,

151
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:58,340
if you can find the ingredients, go steal
it, steal the ingredients, make a sh,

152
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:01,040
make your own shit, dude. Save some money.
But if you don't want to save any money,

153
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,790

you'd like. I don't give a fuck Yo,

155
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm that kind of baller. There's some
people that just won't cut coupons,

156
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,430
you know what I'm saying?
All right. That's it folks.

157
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,690
Mike Dolce is here and we're going
to get to the bottom of shit.

158
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,790
The food you eat,
motherfuckers. Oh, experience

159
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,503
Joe Rogan podcast.

160
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,580
[inaudible] also joining us.

161
00:08:31,381 --> 00:08:31,900
Of course,
yours

162
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,310
is the one and only mad
flavor, Aka Joey, Coco Diaz.

163
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,570
And I have here something that everybody
has to try. It's Grillo's pickles,

164
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,540
[inaudible] pickles from Boston.
They send them to me in the mail.

165
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,290
This is the best fucking pickles known,
known to human things,

166
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,520
known to human beings.

167
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,270
They're fresh and they make them
and they send them from Boston.

168
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,730
And this is the spicy ones.
It's Grillo's pickles.

169
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:58,590
You've got try one of these
motherfuckers. Dude, this shit's legit.

170
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,780
Mike Dolce knows about food.
Mike Dolce is,

171
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,110
you are a nutritional
consultant to all these, uh,

172
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,450
various MMA fighters and
probably the most famous one. No,

173
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,820
I'm certainly the most
famous one by a long shot.

174
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:14,200
I can't think of anybody who has,
uh,

175
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,230
gotten so many different fighters,
uh, on track as far as nutrition,

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,230
as far as, uh, you know,
getting their weight in order.

177
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:26,310
So many guys like Tiago Alvarez who had
always had problems getting on. Wait,

178
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,790
once you started working with
you, no problems. You know what,

179
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,440
what got you into this?

180
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:35,850
I mean you do you have a
background in nutrition from
college? LikeW , w how many,

181
00:09:35,851 --> 00:09:39,400
you know so much about it. Just
from reading books, from experience,

182
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,790
life experience, education,
you know, of course.

183
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:45,210
I've been focused on this my
whole life since I was a kid,

184
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:49,750
since I was in single digits actually,
which I think Joey might reference. Um,

185
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,820
since you were a little kid,
you're just like nutrition.
Nice room, Camrys, pickles.

186
00:09:53,821 --> 00:09:56,760
Good. How could these fucking pit bulls
give me some of the pickles? Kill you?

187
00:09:56,761 --> 00:10:01,550
Fucked up. You got to have something
to go with them. Like a tofu steak

188
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,770
or something delicious.

189
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,620
I didn't bring you something to go
in it and that's where you upset.

190
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,700
You have in front of Mike Dalton.
You're talking about the ink priest.

191
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,780
Romie what are you going to do it for?
Streets mashing on this pickle though.

192
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,320
It's pretty good as fuck. You know what?
You gave the wrong credit. You said,

193
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:15,870
you know,

194
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,430
how do you get from nutrition number
one of these for motherfucking Belmont,

195
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,220
New Jersey. That's right. If you don't
know about food and you're from Belmont,

196
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:26,640
you should shoot yourself. That's what
I'm saying. You know what I'm saying?

197
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,030
Nobody gives you a ranch
dressing and Belmont dropped
her for me. Dressing. Yeah.

198
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,910
I was still on the ranch.
Yessing bad for you.

199
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,130
Why do you serve it with French fries?

200
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,030
Some people like white people like it
that's not allowed on the east coast.

201
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,540
I don't mind it. Yeah, it's a, it's a,
it's a white people thing. White people.

202
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,110
Some people, well people with, I dunno,

203
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,350
people did a little duller tones to them,
you know,

204
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,820
tell her personality was like, oh it's
almost nothing. And someone was like,

205
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:58,080
you just eat and rough fat.
I'm were creeped out by
people like thousand island.

206
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,000
I think that's more
creepy. Yeah, that's nasty.

207
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:01,920
That's something you like when you're
a little kid cause you think you're

208
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:05,020
getting away with something because
it tastes almost sweet. It's like, oh,

209
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:09,540
like ketchup, like catch up
as like a dessert, you know?
I really is. It's fucking,

210
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,690
it's a fruit. Tomatoes or fruit. There's
a lot of people don't even realize that.

211
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,800
That's why everybody likes ketchup.
Ketchup is all sugar.

212
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,340
You're getting sugary sweet,
some weird fucking vegetables.

213
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:25,080
It's been mashed up and they stick
your French fries into no delicious.

214
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,990
It's fucking good, but probably
not so good for you. Right?

215
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,190
Ketchup is actually depending, you
know, get it from organic sources. Uh,

216
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,570
make sure you limit the processing. Most
important, anything is good for you.

217
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,200
If you take out the processing and the
processing is needed to preserve these

218
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:45,201
things sometimes or the processing is
needed to turn a batch of chemicals into a

219
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:50,400
food substitute that actually tastes
like something from the earth. Whoa.

220
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,040
Would be processing.
Does that scare you when you see shit

221
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,040
like that going down? It scares
the hell out of me, man. It, it,

222
00:11:57,041 --> 00:12:00,010
it gets me out of bed every day. It
keeps me like, that's all I see in.

223
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,730
It's all I focus on. What do you think
about all this genetically modified foods?

224
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:07,660
Are you ended that at all?
Do you understand as much
about that? That's uh, that's,

225
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:11,900
that's the end of the planet.
That's the end of the earth,
I think is, uh, the, the,

226
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,180
the modification, the alteration
of, of our DNA of the human race,

227
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:20,680
let's say through new new food sources,
unrecognized maybe on,

228
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:22,850
on a simulated and, uh, um,

229
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,260
further reactions happen within the human
body that we may or may not understand

230
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:27,910
yet because of that.
Yeah.

231
00:12:27,911 --> 00:12:30,820
We don't even know what the fuck that
genetically modified crops are doing to

232
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:31,660
people, right? Yeah.

233
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,320
But they're there in abundance and
they're inexpensive and they taste good.

234
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,580
So yeah. And they're poisoning other
crops. They're infiltrating their,

235
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,730
there's their seeds or whatever the
fuck it is, gets in the air and uh,

236
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,920
gets to other people's land somehow
or another. And these people,

237
00:12:47,921 --> 00:12:49,360
they get cross pollinated.

238
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,450
And so they started growing
these genetically modified crops,

239
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:57,370
not unbeknownst to them. And then they
get sued by Monsanto, which is incredible.

240
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,060
The crazy thing about those Monsanto
things is you can't even get seeds from

241
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:03,220
them. You know, like you buy the corn,

242
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,950
it's like the way it used
to be is you would buy corn,

243
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,450
you get the seeds from that corn
itself planted and make new corn.

244
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,270
Like that's how plants work.
Yeah. Monsanto, they don't,
they don't roll like that.

245
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,720
They don't roll like that.
You ain't getting no seeds
bitch. You don't get seeds,

246
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:19,260
you don't get seeds. They don't
make seeds. They're there.

247
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,020
Their food makes their seeds make
food and then you don't own it.

248
00:13:23,021 --> 00:13:26,410
Next year you own it. This year
you, you buy the seeds for the year.

249
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,720
So if you have like some, you know, some,

250
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,990
some plants and you think you're going
to like just go old school American

251
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:33,010
Indian style and just,

252
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,490
we'll take the seeds from them and we'll
harvest and we'll, we'll, you know,

253
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,380
create a, a, a beautiful,
sustainable environment. No, no,

254
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,500
no. You buy this every year. Yeah. You,

255
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:46,560
we got your bitch at our price and
there's so many dudes that are click

256
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,110
committing suicide in third
world countries that had
been roped into doing this

257
00:13:50,111 --> 00:13:54,100
shit with Monsanto. I think they have a
huge problem in India. I believe it was,

258
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,770
there's a lot of suicidal,
let me, I should look that up,

259
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,120
but I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
Suicides from there,

260
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,680
they're depressed that they get
stuck in with these loans. Yeah.

261
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:10,640
Thousands of farmers are
committing suicide. Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,070
This is crazy, man. But what,

263
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:17,510
what's what's happening
is they essentially go in
economic hitman style and a

264
00:14:17,511 --> 00:14:19,610
offer these people seeds and you know,

265
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:22,990
and sort of take over the
situation and make sure that, uh,

266
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,740
these people are using their stuff. And
then the farmers, uh, they get stuck,

267
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:31,580
uh, like going fuck loads of
money and they can't pay it.

268
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,810
So is it illegal for them to own
other seats? I don't know. You know,

269
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:37,610
I'd have to find out. I
mean, if that's the case,

270
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,380
they got really fucked
over by their country,

271
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:44,380
but I'm reading an article
about it right now. If you,
you just, just Google, um, uh,

272
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,610
what did I Google?
Just Google India.

273
00:14:48,611 --> 00:14:52,040
Monsanto suicide.
And there's a bunch of different,

274
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,670
don't say the Brian. That's
stupid. That was the only funny,

275
00:14:55,671 --> 00:15:00,260
the first 3000 times
you said it. Um, yeah.

276
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,840
Fuck man. It's really, it's really scary.

277
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,290
But there's all sorts of different crops
and seeds that a Monsanto apparently.

278
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,080
Yeah, track. Wow. There's
thousands of fucking suicides.

279
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,310
This is really scary shit.

280
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,960
They're saying that it's at least
200,000 suicides in India connected to

281
00:15:22,761 --> 00:15:25,220
Monsanto.
Wrap your head around that shit.

282
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,940
200,000 people have committed suicide
because Monsanto's got them into

283
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:34,570
the seed game. This game pitch, I'll,

284
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,200
you mean my fees? Oh, you got
a baby that's crying. Oh Man.

285
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,340
Mass scenes. Juan Santos just
got, this is just running shit.

286
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,750
That's really pretty scary. How big of a
company are they? Oh, they're enormous.

287
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,990
There's so enormous that they, it was, uh,

288
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,840
the black water was sold to someone
and they don't know who it was.

289
00:15:53,841 --> 00:15:55,790
And one of the people in
the running was Monsanto.

290
00:15:55,791 --> 00:16:00,380
They believe that Monsanto was interested
in black water. If that's the case,

291
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,420
that means like the biggest food company
in the world has the biggest mercenary

292
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:09,950
group under the world working for them.
Gangster. That's his gangster. She gets,

293
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,330
that's his gangster. As you
get, they, they hired some
marks. They're like, you know,

294
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:17,600
we're just taking over the world by
selling them fucking shitty seeds,

295
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,650
the taking over the world and they've
got their own army, by the way.

296
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,270
And not just any army got the
best one of the world. Wow.

297
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,810
It's a will you live in a crazy world,
man. We live in a movie. We really do.

298
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:35,580
We live in some crazy gangster movie.
Absolutely. So back to the food,

299
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,480
you, um, you'd, you'd get these
fighters. And so what do you do?

300
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:42,930
Basically you write out all of their
nutrition, everything they can eat,

301
00:16:42,931 --> 00:16:45,480
what time they eat it, blah, blah,
blah. Like how do you, what do you do?

302
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,820
No, um, it, it depends on the athlete.
Number one, it depends on the person,

303
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,020
what their goal is.

304
00:16:51,021 --> 00:16:54,230
So the first thing I do is I fly out
there in a shadow him for a few days,

305
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,450
hang out with the Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, hang out with them,

306
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:59,420
hanging out with their families, stay
in the guest room, whatever. And uh,

307
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,250
I just laid back and I watch and I see,

308
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:03,800
and then we start to talk and
build a relationship. And A,

309
00:17:03,801 --> 00:17:08,300
I start to fill in the cracks.
I troubleshoot, eat bad
instead of this, you know,

310
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,310
you got training at 11,
you wake up 10 45

311
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,110
daddy, do you have to be, does that,

312
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,530
does that fall into play or I wouldn't
say dad, let me, let me say how much of a,

313
00:17:16,531 --> 00:17:21,420
um, uh, how much of an older
brother, how much of a,

314
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,850
how much of a situation
where, you know, these guys,

315
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:27,670
like they're looking for
someone to help them to coach

316
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,210
coaches. The most respectful way of
putting it mean how many, I know a lot.

317
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
It's amazing how many fighters need
like someone to tell them what to do.

318
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,730
Like there's a lot of guys
who were super independent,

319
00:17:38,731 --> 00:17:40,770
but there's a lot of guys who
aren't that independent at all.

320
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,010
And then they essentially need someone
to tell him what to do and in order for

321
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:45,340
them to shut that aspect aspect

322
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,160
of their brain off and be
successful. Yeah, it's, uh, I,
I do as is a coach. You know,

323
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:53,430
I'm a full time coach and the
coaching in certain areas, the guys,

324
00:17:53,431 --> 00:17:56,430
some guys I actually do develop
that brother type of bond with,

325
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:58,950
but it's not every guy, you
know, because professional,

326
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:02,460
I worked with a bunch of guys and you
only have so much emotional output or,

327
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,990
or can we not naming any names?

328
00:18:03,991 --> 00:18:07,680
Like what's the most difficult situation
that you'd have to encounter? Um,

329
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,070
it's the people around
the athlete, you know, in,

330
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,690
in a coach relationship one
on one. It's like a, you know,

331
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,970
you're working with your Moitai coach,
you're in the room, nobody's there.

332
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,170
You hear everything, you do, everything,

333
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:19,380
you respond to everything and the
more people in that room are talking,

334
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,410
the less you're going to retain the
technique can execute the technique.

335
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,580
Same thing with the things
that I do. Yeah. That's just
like performing on stage.

336
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,460
If you're performing on stage,
someone's talking in the background,

337
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:32,610
that Shit's annoying. If you're training
and use a bunch of people in the room,

338
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,080
people don't realize that like training,

339
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,210
especially training the fight that's like,

340
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,600
that requires all of your
fucking attention. Sure.

341
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,770
Everybody treats it like it's no big deal.
Like you're out there.

342
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,330
Just even if you were playing pool,

343
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:45,300
if he were lined up on a difficult shot
and a bunch of people were talking,

344
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:49,050
he'd be like, well, you shut the fuck up
and nobody's punching you in the face,

345
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,840
kick you in the face in front of millions
of people in your mortgage is on the

346
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:53,970
line when you're playing pool and
they've got a bunch of yes men.

347
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,200
So that's what it is. Yeah. Well I mean
everybody has, we all have yes men,

348
00:18:58,201 --> 00:18:59,520
right in our own way. And, and it's,

349
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:03,120
it's the motivation or it's what's best
for the athlete at that given time.

350
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,170
You know, some athletes need some,
yes, men are random just to keep their,

351
00:19:06,171 --> 00:19:09,330
their confidence up and keep
their lifestyle secure. Um,

352
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:12,900
but it's the people that are kind of
pushing in the wrong areas at that given

353
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,960
point, you know, eight weeks before
applied, six, four, two, you know,

354
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:19,980
the closer you get the, uh,
the less room for inefficiency.

355
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,950
I think you have. So you Kinda, you know,

356
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,210
I think I helped with
some guys eliminate that.

357
00:19:24,211 --> 00:19:26,970
And sometimes it's through nutrition,
sometimes it's through training too much,

358
00:19:26,971 --> 00:19:30,600
too little, you know, sleep
patterns, just perception.

359
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,580
And sometimes it's a, it's other aspects
of the team, maybe not it's external,

360
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,570
it's internal, you know, the,

361
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,600
the striking coach or the
wrestling coach or you know,

362
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:42,660
one coach wants to do too much or
all the coaches want to do too much.

363
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,850
So being that I'm with
the athlete more often,

364
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,270
I can see what their
recuperation level is,

365
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,720
how they're performing daily.
Um,

366
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,620
and kind of moderate via the peaking let's
there the intensity and the volume of

367
00:19:55,621 --> 00:19:59,760
the overall training session.
So when you go to these different camps,

368
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,590
do you see like a constant paradigm like
replaying itself over and over again or

369
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,190
one guy is trying to get in control of
the camp and all the other guys trying to

370
00:20:08,191 --> 00:20:10,350
push that guy out.
Do you see like a lot of that,

371
00:20:10,351 --> 00:20:13,350
a psychological bullshit that
goes on behind the scenes? Yeah,

372
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,810
but I don't think it's any
different in a fight camp than it.

373
00:20:15,811 --> 00:20:19,350
Isn't that a family or an office
environment or the PTA, you know,

374
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,280
that's probably worse with
it. It's everywhere. And
there's some, you know, a lot.

375
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,740
I'm, I'm blessed that a lot
of the teams that I work with,

376
00:20:25,741 --> 00:20:27,750
I'm fortunate enough to work with.
There's none of that.

377
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,810
We all respect each other as
professionals and the athletes, the boss,

378
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:32,220
I call it the Microsoft structure,

379
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,060
the athlete is Bill Gates and I'm the
best damn keyboard builder in the world.

380
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,860
And that's what I do.
And that's all I want to do.

381
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,920
I can certainly help the guy that built
the monitor and the office next to me,

382
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,720
but you know,
I,

383
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:45,690
I'm the best keyboard guy
and we'll communicate around
the board and we'll give

384
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,040
everything to the man on top.
He makes the decisions.

385
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,100
I don't think people realize
the importance for a fighter
of having a strong and

386
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:58,330
professional team, having people
that are not bullshit artists,

387
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,600
they're not charlatans,
they're not egomaniacs.

388
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:04,150
They know what the fuck they're doing.
They're professionals.

389
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,690
That's what they're there for. And
everybody has a job. Being a nutritionist,

390
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,900
be it a strength and conditioning coach.
Everyone is the real fucking deal.

391
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:15,100
That's a real jujitsu coach. This is a
real Moy Thai coach. And, and you know,

392
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:18,220
one of the things that's driving me crazy
is all these fighters that are getting

393
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:18,581
injured,

394
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:22,180
like Dominick Cruz got injured because
they're all training together all in one

395
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:22,750
room.

396
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,750
Dominick Cruz is preparing to defend
his fucking Bantam weight world title.

397
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,230
And his knee gets blown out because
someone lands on him. That's fucked up.

398
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,540
You're talking about someone
he's not training with.

399
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,180
If people don't understand this,
he's training with one person there.

400
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,040
They're sparring and next to him,

401
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:42,700
two other dudes are working out and they
collide into the champ. First of all,

402
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,440
those dudes are idiots.
There's dudes.

403
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:47,140
Whoever the fuck was driving
that takedown was an idiot.

404
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,900
Whoever the fuck was defending
it was an idiot. Those guys are,

405
00:21:49,901 --> 00:21:53,800
they're right next to a guy
who's preparing to fucking
train for his world title.

406
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,590
I shouldn't say they're idiots and say, I
should say I've done it. The same thing.

407
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:00,430
It's an idiotic move. She should be
way the fuck away from that guy. Yeah.

408
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:03,130
That shit happened to Rashad.
It happened to, you know,

409
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:08,000
it's happened to a couple
guys. Like that's some Bush
league shit. Yeah. Small. Uh,

410
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,620
small mistake and a huge, huge
price to pay. Right? Yeah.

411
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,700
I shouldn't have said that guys
who are training or an idiot's.

412
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:15,490
What I should say is it's an
idiotic way to set up a room.

413
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,460
It's an idiotic way to set up a training
room when the guy's training for the

414
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:22,660
fucking world title in a period. It's
crazy. Bush league, like I hear it.

415
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:27,620
It drives me nuts was you are, when
you come to a camp, how do you,

416
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,310
uh, you, you're obviously
brought in for nutrition,

417
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:34,510
but if you see like some other bullshit,
some things that you need to deal with,

418
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:37,540
some things that, you know, like
you'd say it to the athlete, like,

419
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,261
here's your problem.

420
00:22:38,261 --> 00:22:42,460
You have this big social drama going on
and you've got to pick a side and stick

421
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,510
with that and then get,

422
00:22:43,511 --> 00:22:47,110
be done with this because otherwise you're
dealing with this fucking social shit

423
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,011
and you're,
you're,

424
00:22:48,011 --> 00:22:51,010
that's taking up resources that you could
be using to train and concentrate and

425
00:22:51,011 --> 00:22:53,740
your opponent. Absolutely.
So you, you breathe. Do you,

426
00:22:53,741 --> 00:22:55,480
are you the guy who goes to the athlete?

427
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,280
You got everybody. I go to the athlete,
I go to the, the, the person involved,

428
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,530
you know,
and we speak about

429
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,410
professionals, you know,
it's not emotional,

430
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,430
it's professional and you have the luxury
of really being so requested that uh,

431
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,910
it's, it's, you know,

432
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:12,120
you don't have to worry about like this
one guy who is going to fire you because

433
00:23:12,121 --> 00:23:15,660
you know, you upset his friend
and you know, as you know,

434
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,200
as buck got hurt now I think
the people that I work with, um,

435
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:23,860
they called drift for a fucking reason.
They brought me there for a reason.

436
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,160
There's something not right. You
know, we don't know if it's nutrition,

437
00:23:27,161 --> 00:23:31,230
whatever they called you in for we, have
you ever been a situation where a fly,

438
00:23:31,231 --> 00:23:35,340
it has got like a crazy fucking old lady.
Absolutely. Every fight. I had a crazy,

439
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:39,040
oh my God. And Go, come in
for a second dog. This chick,

440
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,530
she got to go right there.
That's a fucking, yeah.

441
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,100
May I have heard some things. There
was so shy from dudes who were like the

442
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,390
baddest motherfuckers you would think this
dude ain't taking no shit from nobody.

443
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,430
And you know,
night before his fight,

444
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,760
his girlfriend wants to fucking
fight all night, won't let him sleep.

445
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,710
It keeps waking him up
and fucking with him,

446
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:00,620
calling him a loser and leaves
the middle of the night.

447
00:24:00,621 --> 00:24:02,510
It doesn't say where he's going
and he can't go back to sleep.

448
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:05,810
He's calling her phone.
She won't answer there in Vegas.

449
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:09,050
This bitch just went out at 5:00 AM,
you know,

450
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:13,040
and these guys have to fight the next
day and deal with it because a lot of,

451
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,520
to become a professional athlete,
to become a guy,

452
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:20,790
especially who wants to be a cage
fighter, you know, a lot of these people,

453
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:25,870
or they're the type of impulsive athletes
that attract crazy broads cause crazy

454
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:30,650
bods, dude, nutty shit.
Like, you know, you know,

455
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:33,920
they'll suck your Dick like 10 minutes
after meeting you and you're like, Whoa,

456
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:38,600
this pitch is hot. She is
both, this is nuts. Well, she's
crazy. She's fucking crazy.

457
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,810
And then it ended in crazy impulsiveness
and made her blow you in a bathroom.

458
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:45,990
That's, that's not what leads to a
good relationship. Like absolute,

459
00:24:45,991 --> 00:24:48,450
that girl's a freak. You know, you
gotta get the fuck away from me.

460
00:24:48,451 --> 00:24:50,550
You're not supposed to have kids
with her. Move her in. Yeah,

461
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,720
with a lot of these guys and move her
in. They have kids with them. These,

462
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,430
those you gotta be careful and not,
I'm not saying don't do it,

463
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,540
but I'm saying be careful.

464
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:04,690
You gotta be careful of that all in
relationship will you meet somebody and

465
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:09,110
right away the girls all in and the
guys all in and the two of you are like,

466
00:25:09,111 --> 00:25:13,180
I love you. I love you. Spend 15 hours
a day with each other every day. That

467
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,860
guy, that's your manager. I don't like how
he talks to you. Yes. Bye Greg Jackson.

468
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,430
I don't like him. I don't like his
eyes. I don't trust them. Oh yeah,

469
00:25:21,431 --> 00:25:26,320
they always put my father in law. I think
my father should train. He's getting up

470
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,140
separate. Separate you from the herd.
It's amazing. You have to go to,

471
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,370
somebody's going to be
straight up. There's no fucking
beating around the bush.

472
00:25:36,371 --> 00:25:38,290
Listen, I've seen the
behavior, first of all,

473
00:25:38,291 --> 00:25:41,050
what you're doing at the gym
with a fucking 90 young cause.

474
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:44,520
This shit that you can't even believe you
walk in and it's not that the fighters

475
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:47,470
a fucked up, it's that they have little
things that you're tightening up.

476
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:50,000
We all could have somebody come
into our lives and say, hey dog,

477
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,200
you got to start getting up at seven.
You got to start eating at six 15,

478
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:55,420
which makes a lot of sense.
One of the things that get booked,

479
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,580
I told Joe about it.
I go,

480
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,850
I can't give fucking used to this
dolce water before fucking coffee shit.

481
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,490
Every time I drink water in the morning,
first off,

482
00:26:03,491 --> 00:26:06,820
I got a cramp in my stomach like
pills or vitamins in the morning.

483
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,200
But it's explaining what
you're talking about.

484
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:11,280
Why do you have to drink water before?
Tough to jump the metabolism. Uh,

485
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:14,770
Mike and his book says to drink
coffee after your meal. Uh,

486
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,800
I think the first time I read it was
the water first to get your metabolism

487
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:20,200
going, which makes sense. It makes
a lot of sense. I don't understand.

488
00:26:20,201 --> 00:26:22,180
How does water get your metabolism going?
What does it do?

489
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,990
So you push the water through your body
and starting to digestive process to

490
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,630
working to start working,
to prepare your diet,

491
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,030
digestive environment for the food
that's next to come. So now you put the,

492
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,170
the nutrients in the body and we
get them metabolism, start to work,

493
00:26:35,171 --> 00:26:36,070
start the process.

494
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,590
And then if you're a coffee drinker
and then you can have some coffee,

495
00:26:38,591 --> 00:26:42,370
which is a cynic, you know, so you
want something already down there.

496
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,040
So it's to not

497
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,360
increase or overload a digestive
system with the acidity, which is hard.

498
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,620
We all know, you know, you have a little
bit of coffee on an empty stomach.

499
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,980
You're jacked up for days.
We're not in the next six hours a room.

500
00:26:52,981 --> 00:26:55,350
You've got to train in two
hours. You grown in, you know,

501
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:59,040
so you start your day in
the proper, uh, proper note.

502
00:26:59,041 --> 00:27:01,440
Whether you're going in an office, it
doesn't matter. I'll go in the office,

503
00:27:01,441 --> 00:27:03,840
we go into the gym to train. It
doesn't matter. It's the same thing.

504
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,050
What do you think about
coffee for athletes before
they compete? Is that okay?

505
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,990
Absolutely. I'm, I'm
sipping on one right now.

506
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,840
Like a lot of guys jacked themselves up
with caffeine before they fire. Right.

507
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,580
As long as they're used to it.
Um,

508
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:16,620
nothing that they haven't been
doing in the last three weeks.

509
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,820
All of a sudden guys fight night,
they want to drink a, you know,

510
00:27:18,821 --> 00:27:21,780
an energy drink or this new pill.
Your heart beat too fast.

511
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,500
Can't calm yourself down.
We can't predict what the is going to be.

512
00:27:25,501 --> 00:27:27,660
We haven't tested it.
Tested in the gym. Yeah.

513
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,640
When I was talking to
Chelsea son and he was uh,

514
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:34,140
talking about how he uses like those
little vibrant type caffeine pills,

515
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:37,320
which are legal, he knows what
the law, the legal, you know,

516
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,630
doses and that way when
he's taking the pills,

517
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:42,240
he never has to worry because if
you drink like a 20 ounce Starbucks,

518
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:47,050
a lot of folks don't know you might
like Piss hot for caffeine. Like you,

519
00:27:47,051 --> 00:27:48,790
you only can have a certain amount.
Yeah.

520
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,160
Caffeine is a PR weird performance
enhancing drug and that it's legal.

521
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,660
You're allowed to drink caffeine,

522
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:56,430
but you're only allowed to
drink a certain amount of it.

523
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,300
It's really fascinating isn't it?
Yeah. Because uh, if folks don't know,

524
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:03,630
like if you get, we got our coffee
from lovebirds cafe and bakery.

525
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,720
Very nice place down the street and a
nice mom and pop shop here in Pasadena.

526
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,900
But um, you go to Starbucks and
you get one of them vent these,

527
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:13,600
that's a lot of God damn cap on.
It's way more caffeine.

528
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,000
Maybe I've been doing Trenton, but I
think that's a lot of ice buddy. No, no,

529
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,090
I do light ice. Trenta iced coffee,
unsweetened every single day. Oh my God.

530
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,290
Is that a strong as a
regular coffee? It's, it's,

531
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,600
it's stronger actually cause they actually
make it stronger because the ice is

532
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:31,080
supposed to melt it. You're going to
die. So if they just did regular coffee,

533
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,280
so it's actually, yeah, it's stronger.

534
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,640
Well you would not be able to fight
in the UFC for sure. If you did,

535
00:28:35,641 --> 00:28:37,020
you would get Keith Kaiser up your ass.

536
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,820
That would be my excuse for not fighting
in that. You have to do, I just coughing.

537
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:45,930
Sorry. Isn't it funny that you, you can't
smoke weed but you can smoke cigarettes.

538
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,460
No one, you don't, you don't test hot for
cigarettes. This is hilarious. It live.

539
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,960
They're looking out for you fucking idiot.

540
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,530
You can't smoke legal weed either.
Like Nick Diaz has a goddamn prescription.

541
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,550
And by the way, the prescriptions,
uh, carries over to Nevada is a,

542
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:05,250
Nevada has medical marijuana
too. So why do they, you know,

543
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:09,450
why do you have to apply for some
exemption? It's so ridiculous. So silly.

544
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,010
Long as you're not fighting high and
you can take pills, you know, um,

545
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,420
the different medical pills,

546
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:19,140
psychological pills you can take
during the training in less time.

547
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,110
You closer to the fight, then
you could marijuana. I, yeah.

548
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,480
I don't know how long it
takes to cycle off Adderall,

549
00:29:24,481 --> 00:29:27,960
but I do know that fighters had been
told they can't fight on it. On Adderall.

550
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,640
Xanax. Fight Week. Yeah. How
many days does that wear off?

551
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,790
I don't know the, but the,
the life of it specifically,

552
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:39,150
but I know guys can be on that flight
weekend and test fine and be legal going

553
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:41,860
up and up, disclose everything.
It's no problem. I've done Xanax,

554
00:29:41,861 --> 00:29:44,350
but from what I understand,
one of the problems with Xanaxes,

555
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,420
although it alleviates anxiety,

556
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,140
there's sort of a rubber band effect and
after it wears off, you're more anxious.

557
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:53,300
Then you were even before you took that,
it sticks to you fucking fat.

558
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,440
So if you take 10 milligrams of Valium,
your body only really uses five.

559
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,860
The only five, the other five
go into your body and sit there.

560
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,690
So the next morning when you wake up,

561
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,300
you blow those two hits to
take a right to fucking work.

562
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,500
Those two hits of that fucking number of
strongly what they usually are because

563
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:14,030
Valium gets sits in your fat and
your body releases it as it needs it.

564
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:17,480
So it might need it to fall asleep,
but then it holds on to the rest.

565
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,840
That's what I don't like about value.
You have that hangover the next day.

566
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:24,830
Any of those things are fucking
horrible. Ambien, get her up.

567
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:29,170
I mean people buying cars, people cook
and fucking meals and going shopping.

568
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,460
How the fuck go shopping if
it gets they go shopping.

569
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,900
Yeah. Well that's what
happens when you do a ambient.

570
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,360
I have a whole bit about it
in my act cause it's true.

571
00:30:38,361 --> 00:30:40,010
A friend of mine did
make a fucking Turkey,

572
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,670
made a Turkey wise on Ambien and I
do a bit about it and my it true,

573
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:46,760
it doesn't remember going to supermarket.
Totally legal may not fucking dark age.

574
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,050
Yeah. I think all the anxiety medication
in the market is bullshit or shit.

575
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,360
I think if you go to acupuncture and a
meditated would do the same to do all the

576
00:30:56,701 --> 00:30:57,534
same things.

577
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:00,970
You say that man, but your circumstances
are not everyone else's circumstances.

578
00:31:00,971 --> 00:31:04,390
I would never say that he's, some people
don't need an anti anxiety medication.

579
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,160
Whatever situation they're in.
I wouldn't say it's bullshit. I

580
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,750
did not say that. I said the ones I
was prescribed we'll fucking horrific.

581
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,070
Okay. Horrific. To the point where I gave
him to Sergio, love this motherfucker,

582
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:19,910
call me the next day and said dog,
whatever it was and that shit is bad.

583
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:23,060
When Sergio Love Cork and I
told you this other Pi's. Yeah,

584
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:26,420
you told me you gave me,
gave a medication. Great Guy.

585
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,160
And I was taking these things.
I'm going,

586
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:31,700
I'm feeling fucked up on these anxiety
pills. I got these from Bob Hope.

587
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,980
This is the sag doctor.
They're not going to give me shit.

588
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,820
So it takes away your anxiety by making
him feel like shit. Oh, I was feeling,

589
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,170
I was feeling depressed. I
was feeling like everything
was very moody. Everything.

590
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,060
When I was on it, I felt like I
was dark. I couldn't do comedy.

591
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,940
Do you mean like that for,

592
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:51,980
I felt like I was living a fucking
black and white movie. Wow.

593
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,840
That's hard to describe to people.

594
00:31:53,841 --> 00:31:56,600
You feel like you're in a
black and white movie and I,

595
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,010
something wasn't right that was
taken to afternoon naps. You know,

596
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,490
it wasn't right. And I said one day,
wait a second, I got a test monkey.

597
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:09,620
I got my boy. I call this motherfucker
up cause I've seen, I seen my boy,

598
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,680
10 ten's I've seen them before.
10 zero one shot.

599
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,240
Anybody weeds for tens and at the end of
the night says I 1310s you're a savage.

600
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,340
It takes a missile and
knock that motherfucker,

601
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,400
fellow chocolate dialing going nowhere.

602
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,870
You're going to be pounded
that motherfucker for hours.

603
00:32:23,871 --> 00:32:26,780
1310s are you fucking kidding me?
Yeah.

604
00:32:26,781 --> 00:32:31,560
You do a little blown of mixed it up
a little bit and milligrams of valley.

605
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:36,500
What it, what does one do? One fucking
knock you out from here to England. Jesus.

606
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:38,960
How was he taking?
When you're drinking and you're drinking,

607
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,190
your adrenaline is still

608
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,060
alive. Probably goes into your fat and
that's kind of a big guy. He's a big guy.

609
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:47,590
But the fucking funny thing was that
when he called me the next day and said

610
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,860
they was fucked up, I was like, I just
flushed him. And I said, that's it.

611
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:54,980
Even though I have a fear of needles,
I'm going to hit this acupuncture.

612
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:58,510
Why not let me give it a shot. I
don't understand people who, uh,

613
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,130
need to get happy because I'm happy.
You know what I'm saying?

614
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,440
But I know people that have been unhappy.

615
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,010
I don't understand like the desire to
try to achieve happiness cause right.

616
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:09,770
I'm a happy person.
I surround myself with happy people.

617
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,310
I do what I want to do for a living.
I got a lot of loved ones. Happiness.

618
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,330
That's happiness to me.

619
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,550
I know people though that just
got stuck in a fucking bad place.

620
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:22,760
And if they're not bad people,
they just got stuck in a bad place.

621
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,930
And I know that anti anxiety medication
and I know that antidepressants have a

622
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:30,290
place in this world and the
real problem is corruption.

623
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,610
The real problem is these fucking asshole
doctors that want to prescribe it for

624
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:38,250
everyone. That doesn't feel good that
day. They want to, I mean they'll,

625
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,010
they'll try to prescribe that shit.
There's,

626
00:33:40,011 --> 00:33:42,770
there's some unscrupulous
motherfuckers they, we know,

627
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,020
they get kickbacks from
pharmaceutical companies.

628
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:49,370
We know that pharmaceutical
representatives, they, they
take them out to dinners.

629
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:53,420
And I know this because Mrs Rogan's
mom is a nurse and you know,

630
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,320
I've seen like I've seen how that whole
business works. It's creepy as fuck.

631
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,480
When is a business of the advertise
these fucking things on TV man.

632
00:34:02,481 --> 00:34:05,980
They haven't been magazines. It's crazy.
You're right. Joy. I fucked up cause,

633
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:10,250
but I also think that people should try
every other avenue before they go on.

634
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,630
But that's for facts.
That's for fucking sure.

635
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,610
From exercise to meditate
and to yoga to the needles.

636
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,680
I don't give a fuck of
the long Bata helps you.

637
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,040
Anything is better than
getting caught into that cycle.

638
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,640
But what I'm trying to say by
my saying that I'm happy is it,

639
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:30,110
I'm not saying I've always been happy.
I was very dark early in my life.

640
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,150
I was a, when I was, when I was young,

641
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:35,240
when I was in my early
twenties and my teens, I was a,

642
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:39,110
I was not a happy person by any stretch
of the imagination and not even remotely,

643
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:42,170
but I knew it was possible.

644
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,890
And because you,
you,

645
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:50,360
you manage your life the correct way
because you get to a situation where you

646
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:52,700
gotta have a lot of good fortune
and you have a lot of good friends.

647
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,260
Your literally, your mental state
becomes a happier mental state.

648
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:01,670
Like what people don't understand is a
lot of the reason why you feel like shit

649
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:05,570
is because your life fucking sucks and
you're supposed to feel like shit to

650
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:08,210
motivate you. They get the
fuck out of the life you're in.

651
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,700
Whether it's a relationship,
whether it's a job,

652
00:35:10,701 --> 00:35:12,890
whatever the situation is that sucks.

653
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,310
Whatever the thing is inside you
that's rotting you out from the inside,

654
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:19,520
whether it's you want to do something
else but didn't have the balls to pursue

655
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:22,760
it. You wanted another girl but you
couldn't keep her cause you're a liar.

656
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,800
Whatever the fuck it is that eats at you,

657
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,860
you got to straighten that shit
out or you will never be happy.

658
00:35:27,861 --> 00:35:31,310
You can't just flood yourself
with chemicals that trick
your brain to thinking

659
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:34,940
that this reality is acceptable because
it's not really what's going on.

660
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,980
What's going on is you
know that you haven't done

661
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,540
the best that you can do. It's about
choices. Yeah. What about the fighter?

662
00:35:42,570 --> 00:35:47,010
That's fine for the championship of the
world on Saturday and two weeks before

663
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,780
he's fighting for the
championship of the world.

664
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,980
He's not sticking her mother's childhood
forever. Fucking stupid reason. You know,

665
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,270
um, something his father said
to him, he wasn't good. Awesome.

666
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,210
Because people have
gotten into funks before.

667
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,870
Big things because your
mind talking about who,

668
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,880
how your mind works in mysterious ways.
Who are you talking about?

669
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,720
Not talking about anybody in particular.
I, I'm sorry, you were talking about a,

670
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:11,370
was talking about how your mind works.
We both read the art of war,

671
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:13,680
the war of art.
Know what that guy says.

672
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,050
How a writer will surround
himself with obstacles.

673
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,340
We'll put natural obstacles in front
of ourselves to make us feel, you know,

674
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,610
and your mind,
does it take you to dark places?

675
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,450
It's our own fucking personal resistance.

676
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:29,110
We know it's good for us and we won't
fucking do it, but it's really weird how,

677
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,590
I can't imagine a fighter,
a comic, you know,

678
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:34,020
a lot of these comics towards
the end of the Kennison,

679
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,180
a lot of these fighters
towards the and awesome.

680
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,330
I mean the punches in the head
and the mind and insecurities,

681
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:43,260
they fucking spinning around Bro.
And once you get insecurity in the mix,

682
00:36:43,590 --> 00:36:47,940
you have to go talk to somebody
or it's, it's, it's a ego.

683
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,170
It's all mixed in that same fucking thing.
The ego works too fucking ways, man.

684
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:56,190
Unquestionably, the ego works two
ways. It's a, it's a dance. You know,

685
00:36:56,191 --> 00:36:57,810
and I think a big part of the dances,

686
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,100
you got to put out an overwhelming
abundance of positive energy.

687
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:07,080
I think that's the way to avoid all
the funk and all the bad feelings.

688
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,430
You got to put out an overwhelming amount
of positive energy. If you do that,

689
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:15,090
you have like a surplus out there and then
even the negative shit that comes out,

690
00:37:15,091 --> 00:37:16,340
you just slides right off you.

691
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,740
Cause you've got so much good stuff
coming your way. That's the choices.

692
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,730
The choices make a positive choice.
You make a negative choice in.

693
00:37:22,731 --> 00:37:23,760
The more positive you make,

694
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:26,900
the more you're surrounded by positive
and in the more positive your situations,

695
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:30,930
your lifestyle, your, you know, the, the,
the people around you and then the energy.

696
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,710
So now you're like, you, you're a happy
guy because you're, you're positive guy.

697
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,680
You surround yourself with positive
people, you do positive things, you know,

698
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:39,690
you move forward like that.
You in a,

699
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:42,690
in a parallel universe could be negative
just because you woke up one day and

700
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:44,790
you had corn flakes instead of,
you know,

701
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,830
your green smoothie and then you kind of,
you know,

702
00:37:46,831 --> 00:37:49,440
we're with a bunch of people and they're
smoking cigarettes in the car and

703
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,630
they're listening to this song that you
don't like and you're stuck in traffic

704
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:52,920
and your day kind of go shit even more.

705
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,900
And then there's no
coffee at the coffee spot.

706
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:57,060
You don't have time to get
in there because you're late
for the meeting and your

707
00:37:57,061 --> 00:38:00,420
day keeps spiraling farther and
farther on that negative route.

708
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:01,830
And then it kind of keeps going that way.

709
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,600
And that's where a lot
of people fall off track.

710
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:06,630
And I deal with a lot of people
that are unhappy because they're,

711
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,310
they're overweight,
but why are they overweight?

712
00:38:08,311 --> 00:38:11,610
They're overweight because
they're unhappy, so they
emotionally eat or you know,

713
00:38:11,611 --> 00:38:13,890
they, they, they know that
they're not making good decisions,

714
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,750
so they don't feel like
they deserve good things.

715
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,110
So they kind of inflict a
negative situations on himself,

716
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,220
eat bad and smoke cigarette,

717
00:38:20,221 --> 00:38:22,440
hanging out with bad people and
they're kind of caught in that fuck.

718
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,590
But it's easy to get out of that
funk with a decision. You know what?

719
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,480
I'm going to leave.
I'm gonna walk out and go there.

720
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,940
I'm going to drink some water.
I'm going to step out in the sunshine.

721
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,340
I'm going to the gym and then
call my mom just to say hello,

722
00:38:32,341 --> 00:38:34,800
I'm gonna give my wife a kiss
or whatever the heck it is.

723
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,220
You start making those little positive

724
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,290
decisions and boom,
the next thing you know,

725
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,260
you're happy and every day you're more
and more happy and you're successful.

726
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:44,980
Whether you're a writer or an
entrepreneur or whatever the heck you are.

727
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:46,390
You know you do dishes,

728
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,420
you love what you do when you're more
successful and everything starts to grow

729
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:50,254
and explode from there.

730
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,960
You know the fat trains a motherfucker
and you just described it exactly the fat

731
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:57,440
trains and mother Fucker, because
even if you waved, did at twice.

732
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,060
Even if you wait did it twice at 11 you'll
look, I got to eat again. Cheesecake,

733
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,000
ice cream. It's just your mind works.
You think like that. I have to it again,

734
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:11,510
just saying that you never fucking
know. You know? You never fucking know.

735
00:39:11,511 --> 00:39:13,220
The fat train is a motherfucker.

736
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,260
It's a psychological train
is what you're trying to say.

737
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:18,370
It's a fucked up training
that makes you be a junkie.

738
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:21,890
The same thing that makes me a gambler.
Yeah. The same thing. And it's,

739
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:24,910
so what we were discussing
before the show started,

740
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:28,820
you said don't talk was that people in
America don't really fucking know where

741
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:31,910
to get on that. Get it. Go get off
that train. Yeah. They really don't.

742
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,750
And even if you stop the train and go
get off this scared because they don't

743
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,800
know and there's longevity it staying
off that train for the longest time.

744
00:39:39,801 --> 00:39:42,620
It's not going to happen. Two weeks.
We'll explain what you're saying.

745
00:39:42,621 --> 00:39:46,070
What do you mean by this train? That's
just fat train. It's just a cycle.

746
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:49,420
It's another word for a cycle of abuse,
of cycle of addiction.

747
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,470
Just sending a behavioral,

748
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,110
one night you'd go on the fucking road
and you go to this comedy club and you're

749
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:57,410
hungry and you're on the road for a
fucking week straight. And then they,

750
00:39:57,411 --> 00:40:00,290
I don't mean eight weeks fucking
straight and no shit bucking clubs.

751
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,390
You know what I'm talking about?
And you going to eat dinner,

752
00:40:02,391 --> 00:40:05,480
they have French fries and a hamburger
and now you can't sleep because you're

753
00:40:05,481 --> 00:40:07,580
from the fucking east coat.
You're from the west coast,

754
00:40:07,581 --> 00:40:10,220
you're going into the east coast,
you've got the radio pre fucking day.

755
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,250
So lack of sleep puts fucking
weighed on you. And all of a sudden,

756
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:15,380
next thing you know you'd get,
you're 20 pounds overweight,

757
00:40:15,381 --> 00:40:18,510
you're 30 pounds overweight and you went
on the road and then this happens. I'm,

758
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,020
I'm just, I'm just describing
it how it happened to me.

759
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,700
And you don't know what's going on.

760
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,610
And even though you worked out
all your life and you've walked,

761
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,760
this weight is getting put on and you
know how you can't breathe in your fucking

762
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:31,340
sleep now you can't
breathe and your sleep.

763
00:40:31,341 --> 00:40:34,370
So I'm scared of fucking needles
and doctors. So you know what?

764
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:37,340
Maybe if I get a fucking heart attack,
then I'll figure this out.

765
00:40:37,341 --> 00:40:38,570
So on until I get the heart attack,

766
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,910
that's when I'll go in and take
care of this fucking sleep apnea.

767
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,970
It's finally you're not sleeping and
finally you're falling asleep and fucking

768
00:40:43,971 --> 00:40:47,480
lights and your 90 pounds heavier
than when you moved to La.

769
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Even though there's a fucking why MCA
walking distance from your house and you

770
00:40:53,121 --> 00:40:55,010
walked past it and it's
like the devil's house.

771
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:56,660
You even crossed the fucking street.

772
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,790
You don't even walk in their
fucking state of the city.

773
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,110
That's the factory and the fat train where
people are describing now in America,

774
00:41:03,111 --> 00:41:07,400
obesity was Obama's wife. These
fucking kids are huge. You lost.

775
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,710
You lost a ton of way, Joe.
You asked at one point in time,

776
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,060
which doesn't mean it doesn't matter how
much the job down the fucking street,

777
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,370
35 go down the street right now.

778
00:41:16,371 --> 00:41:18,680
There's not a kid playing
on a fucking street no more.

779
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,380
You mean that all those fucking
houses isn't that one parent.

780
00:41:21,381 --> 00:41:23,480
They can go listen and Monday
I'm going to come out and play.

781
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:27,380
Stick ball with these fat books while
the computer would have knapsack would

782
00:41:27,381 --> 00:41:28,790
compete with the fuck are these kids gone?

783
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,970
They walk around with 80 pounds on
their fucking bag and then 90 pounds

784
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,890
overweight. But me, it started as an
adult. It didn't start as a six year old.

785
00:41:36,891 --> 00:41:41,030
Fucking kid didn't start as
a six year old fucking kid.

786
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,140
It started when I was 30 and I was already
10 years in the fucking bag of blow

787
00:41:45,141 --> 00:41:48,140
and drinking. You know you don't realize
and I'm one night at the comedy store,

788
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:51,350
the Fucker, I don't like alcohol. I
don't like the fucking taste of it.

789
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,370
If I'm doing blow out drink sperm,
but if

790
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:58,900
I don't like the taste,
the apple,

791
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,740
it's a gel soldiers timing ever social
fucking thing I had when I see Joe

792
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:06,500
drinking a beer, you don't think I
want to grab him. You Mike, don't you?

793
00:42:06,501 --> 00:42:08,390
I do the worst thing in the world.
I get so bored.

794
00:42:08,391 --> 00:42:10,510
I'm so embarrassed and been a mud to that.

795
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,440
All I do is smoke pot like a 13 year old.

796
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:15,410
That's sometime [inaudible] give me a
fucking cigarette cause I got to feel like

797
00:42:15,411 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm doing something.

798
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,200
You know what the fucking bartender
told me once at the comedy store that I

799
00:42:19,201 --> 00:42:21,960
drank 16 soldiers while I
was there one night. Wow.

800
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,730
You don't 16 soldiers Dooney fucking
your weights. A lot of sugar.

801
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,490
That's a lot of sugar. I was doing that
eight times a day. People don't know that.

802
00:42:28,491 --> 00:42:29,630
A fucking can of soda.

803
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,650
It's six weight watcher points and the
whole day is dirty fucking eight points.

804
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,590
So if you have six cans of Soda, so
what are you going to do about it? No,

805
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:39,200
it's what you can do to
get off this fucking train.

806
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:43,940
It's so what do you do about it, bro?
I started with changing my character.

807
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,020
It didn't start with the Diet first.
It started with the fucking character,

808
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,540
which is getting up in the morning
and walking, like you said,

809
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:53,060
to the mailbox and touching
it and walking back.

810
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,210
Bob Zany used to take
a bus from Hollywood,

811
00:42:56,211 --> 00:42:59,690
the fucking west side of La
or walked back that you know,

812
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,580
little why did he do that?
To lose weight.

813
00:43:01,910 --> 00:43:04,910
People do fucking put themselves
in predicaments. Awesome. You know,

814
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:08,210
I went to swim. It was a better
option. No, I notice it, but you know,

815
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:11,360
I want to lose weight. I was
scared. I didn't know how to start.

816
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:12,680
I asked a bunch of guys,

817
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:15,190
I knew if I went to Eddie and
sadly I want to lose weight,

818
00:43:15,191 --> 00:43:17,510
he would have thrown me into the fucking
spectrum with digital and I would have

819
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:21,530
broke my fucking back cause I was four
15 and I told you the first time I got on

820
00:43:21,531 --> 00:43:24,630
a fucking treadmill I going to do two
minutes. Yeah. The little guy said,

821
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,360
well you were four 15 at one time,

822
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:30,170
the longest shot cheese
that November 415 pounds,

823
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,970
three packs of cigarettes and fucking day.

824
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,620
So before you lose weight or you can go
in any direction you don't like did I

825
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:41,600
joined karate with black dudes in the
hood so they didn't know who the fuck I

826
00:43:41,601 --> 00:43:45,440
was. It didn't matter who the
fuck I was because I wasn't good.

827
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:49,040
Where are you going? How are you going
downtown with these two black dudes?

828
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,220
And it's funny because I wanted to,

829
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,060
I wanted to put my mind back to where it
was when I was 13 when I hated fucking

830
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,540
all the stupidity when my mother
used to even say, let me Sunday,

831
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,850
you're going to need a drink cause
you've got to stick up your ass.

832
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,860
But I was fine at that point in my life.

833
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:06,380
So I took myself and my mind back to that.

834
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:09,770
I wanted to fucking roll my gear
up in a fucking thing and go back.

835
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:13,400
And just to take my mind too,
when I was an evil fucking 13 year old,

836
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,950
where if you came up to me with
a cigarette, I'd smack you.

837
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:18,950
If you came up to me to a joint,
I fucking tackle you.

838
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:20,630
And if you came up to me with alcohol,

839
00:44:20,631 --> 00:44:22,820
I called you a loser
because my mother had a bar.

840
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:25,100
So I would watch these
people in the bar and go,

841
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,430
I can't believe my mother makes money off.
These fucking Mumbo was drinking.

842
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:33,220
They can stay at home for a six pack and
drop $2 or whatever Schlitz was. Yeah.

843
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,080
So before I got my weight loss program
back, I wanted to get my character back.

844
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,200
Even today book, I go to the
fucking gym, like I was telling you,

845
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:44,520
and I'll do 45 on the bike. I hit the
bag, throw sidekicks, I'm drenched.

846
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,280
People look at me. Everybody's in the
fucking air conditioning. I'm outside.

847
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:51,210
I go to the YMCAS. I'd go to the one
I could go to any sucking gym and La.

848
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:53,670
I go to YMCAs because I want to be rugged.

849
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,620
It takes us back to being a fat mother
fucker and enough with this obesity and

850
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,400
all these diseases were a bunch of fat
fucks and that's how to get off the thing.

851
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:04,980
And I do your little treadmill
workout for beginners,

852
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,000
which I looked at for a month and
go, I'm in no danger. What is this?

853
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:09,750
What is the treadmill?

854
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,290
I love this fucking treadmill workout
from the beginning of the intermediate.

855
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:14,730
Joey fucking,
I'm sorry,

856
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:16,660
what's a treadmill workout?
It's um,

857
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:19,950
in the book I have a few
different treadmill workouts,

858
00:45:19,951 --> 00:45:22,430
beginner treadmill workout, which
is just an introduction. Um,

859
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,080
what it is broken out.
I can actually pull it up and take a look,

860
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:27,060
but I have a beginner, an
intermediate, and the advanced,

861
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,670
which is the fight or treadmill workout,
which is basically intervals.

862
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:30,580
So the fighter,

863
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,940
one minute, eight minutes, one
minute at six minutes, one minute,

864
00:45:32,941 --> 00:45:37,320
eight minutes and it's six minutes per
round. So it's really a six minute round.

865
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,490
I'll never even try that.

866
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:42,810
The beginner was basically you walk for
five minutes at three miles per hour and

867
00:45:42,811 --> 00:45:44,060
then you put it up to five miles.

868
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,800
Wow. Great. Hear him saying why, why
are you doing it? What is your, um,

869
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,700
for the beginner it's really to get people
active to build that base. You know,

870
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:53,080
a lot of times,
like Joe was saying,

871
00:45:53,081 --> 00:45:55,290
people that they're out of shape
for whatever reason, you know,

872
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,760
they've been making negative decision.
Now they make a positive decision.

873
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:00,310
They walk into the gym where
they, you know, have a little
treadmill at the house,

874
00:46:00,311 --> 00:46:01,180
whatever it is.

875
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:04,600
They start to exercise and they do it
wrong because they follow what they see on

876
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:07,930
TV. When they fall, what they saw in
the old self magazine or whatever it is,

877
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:10,930
sore as hell the next day.
They don't perform well,
they look fat, they feel fat,

878
00:46:10,931 --> 00:46:13,300
their clothes are too
tight. Screw this, I'm out.

879
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,560
And that's like Joey saying you walk in
the gym and then you don't go back for a

880
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:17,860
while that people make the bad decisions.

881
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,180
So what this beginner
treadmill workout is it,

882
00:46:20,181 --> 00:46:22,720
it's getting people on the train wheels,
getting them active,

883
00:46:22,721 --> 00:46:23,740
it's getting their heart moving,

884
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:27,280
it's getting their blood flowing and
it's a transition into something a little

885
00:46:27,281 --> 00:46:31,000
bit better. Like Joe is a great example.
He started his, you know, hardest.

886
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:32,830
His hardest pace was
three miles an hour or so.

887
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,070
And then he would go down to one
and he would walk. Now, you know,

888
00:46:36,071 --> 00:46:38,750
a few weeks later he's almost
doubled that or was more than double.

889
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:41,440
That made tremendous amount of
progress in a short period of time.

890
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,610
Instead of just jumping in and doing,
you know, four miles an hour is your,

891
00:46:45,611 --> 00:46:47,710
your slow. And then six or eight
miles an hour is your fast,

892
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,740
which is what most other people do.
So it's in the book.

893
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:52,900
I kind of break it down and
make it easy for people.

894
00:46:52,901 --> 00:46:55,000
So you just kind of stared at, you
pressed the buttons and you move forward.

895
00:46:55,370 --> 00:47:00,290
So you just set out a nice roadmap to
follow and this is the best way to achieve

896
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:05,090
results. And how do you get
people to stick with things?

897
00:47:05,091 --> 00:47:08,560
Do you have particular techniques that
you've developed over the year to,

898
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,580
to motivate guys? Do you you, you give
them inspirational quotes? The like,

899
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:17,600
yeah, it's a all the above. Really. It's,
it's about accountability. You know,

900
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,090
you have to be accountable. What's
your goal? What's your goal? Joe?

901
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,410
What are you going to do?
You want to, you know,

902
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:25,070
make this much money or you want to buy
that old house or you want it, you know,

903
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:28,500
donate x amount of dollars or whatever
the heck it is. What's your goal now?

904
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,220
What are you going do to get there?
Let's

905
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,370
start building steps. Let's
set small goals. Very simple.

906
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:37,180
And it's basic information that we
all know. I'm not saying anything new,

907
00:47:37,181 --> 00:47:41,440
I'm just maybe holding people accountable
to actually doing it. Well, you know, I,

908
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:41,891
there's,

909
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:45,430
there's a term that I use for certain
people and the term is a collector of

910
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:47,230
ideas and I think that's what you are.

911
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:50,550
And there's a guy named Jason
Silva is a brilliant guys,

912
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,440
been a real podcast a couple of times.
That is the same thing that he is,

913
00:47:53,441 --> 00:47:58,441
he's a guy who he takes some
of the greatest information
that's available and he

914
00:47:58,691 --> 00:48:02,710
can regurgitate it in a very entertaining
way. Um, there's not wrong with that.

915
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:04,810
Like you defending that.
Like there's no need to defend that.

916
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:08,470
That's a legitimate skill as
much as learning, you know,

917
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:12,790
car mechanics is a skill as much as
learning it, the medical, you know,

918
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:13,840
science is a skill.

919
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,820
It's all skilled and the ability
to retain all this information. Um,

920
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,710
but you're in a strange
position is the position of, uh,

921
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:23,500
attempting to motivate people like this.
And you were former fighter as well.

922
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,290
You're on the ultimate fighter. What
season, when you're on season seven,

923
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:30,880
how many more fights did you have after
that? Um, I had a couple of more handful,

924
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,290
maybe four or five,
you know,

925
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,130
and then just decided to concentrate
on training guys. The training.

926
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:38,530
That was really the, uh,
the focus in the beginning.

927
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:41,140
I've always been a coach and I've always
been doing that and I fought because I

928
00:48:41,141 --> 00:48:42,640
loved it and I enjoyed it.
Um,

929
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,170
it helped me be a better coach
and I was pretty good at it. I,

930
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:49,430
I did decently well. I'll up
until a certain point. Um,

931
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,250
so the enjoyment was there and I was in
the industry. So I know, you know, very,

932
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,400
um,
specifically what the athlete goes there.

933
00:48:57,490 --> 00:49:00,880
Did you find yourself in a situation
when you were thinking about not doing it

934
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:03,100
anymore and you're wondering
if she's doing any more?

935
00:49:03,101 --> 00:49:07,210
We had like one foot in and
one foot out. Yes. Since, um,

936
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:10,600
since my first fight in the IFL
first fight in the IFL, um, you know,

937
00:49:10,601 --> 00:49:13,930
I got two pro fights and that two or
three pro fights, first fighting, I fell,

938
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:16,870
I knocked this kid out. It's the fastest
record in the history that, you know, IFL.

939
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:20,700
It's, uh, the big who plots on TV
and that when the, you know, it's,

940
00:49:20,701 --> 00:49:23,600
it's team format, the third
victory. So it went from my team.

941
00:49:23,601 --> 00:49:25,270
It's all great stuff when an Xbox live,

942
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,430
which is awesome because
when they just came out,

943
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:29,920
it was the Xbox and they stepped
up the Xbox live and boom,

944
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,800
I went walking through the airport with
on my shoulder cause I'm not putting

945
00:49:32,801 --> 00:49:35,870
that shit and uh, you know the
baggage. Right, right. I'm caring.

946
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:39,820
I was trying to buy it for like seven,
$800 in the airport from it. Wow.

947
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:41,050
It was that new. Yeah, it was awesome.

948
00:49:41,051 --> 00:49:44,500
I didn't know it was such a big dam
and that from that point on I achieved,

949
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:48,510
that was my goal. You know, pretty modest
goals. I did it. I mean I, you know,

950
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:49,870
was undefeated even at that point.

951
00:49:49,871 --> 00:49:52,630
And then I just kept rolling forward
a little bit. Still coaching,

952
00:49:52,631 --> 00:49:54,850
very active as a coach.

953
00:49:54,851 --> 00:49:57,690
And at one point I had 40 pro
athletes while I was profiling.

954
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:02,770
But you weren't concentrating yourself as
much? Um, no, no. Just, it's selfishly,

955
00:50:02,771 --> 00:50:06,370
you know, in a quadrant of my brain I was,
I was going to be the ultimate fighter,

956
00:50:06,371 --> 00:50:08,720
you know, champion and all that stuff. Um,

957
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,790
but that was probably less than 10%
of my true time output, you know,

958
00:50:12,791 --> 00:50:16,030
if you charted what I did in the day
was mostly for everybody else. Yeah.

959
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:20,020
You can't just be confident and not do
the work. Right. Yeah. Gotta do the work.

960
00:50:20,021 --> 00:50:23,710
It's got to go all in. Treat
it like, especially like
people always say like, hey,

961
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:25,000
how come you don't have an MMA fight?

962
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,290
Besides the fact that
I'm getting old as fuck.

963
00:50:27,590 --> 00:50:31,070
The real problem is I don't want to do it
and I don't think he should dabble. No,

964
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:34,400
I'm not going to quit doing comedy.
There's no way I'll quit doing comedy.

965
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,640
There's no way I quit doing this podcast.
There's no, there's no way. I mean,

966
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:41,990
I'm not going to, and if I didn't quit
comedy, I wouldn't be able to fight.

967
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,580
There's no way, you know, it's just,

968
00:50:43,581 --> 00:50:45,620
I don't think it's something
that you should have asked.

969
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:48,770
You shouldn't businessman, you shouldn't
have anything else on your mind. I mean,

970
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:51,500
you could have distractions and
hobbies and all that good stuff,

971
00:50:51,501 --> 00:50:53,960
but when you're training,
you're fucking, that's a,

972
00:50:53,961 --> 00:50:56,570
it's an amazing amount of time
these guys have to devote.

973
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:58,630
I don't think people realize it.
People like that.

974
00:50:58,631 --> 00:51:01,760
Just watch fights and don't dig
into it and find out what a,

975
00:51:01,761 --> 00:51:03,860
what a training schedule is
like for these fucking kids.

976
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:07,490
It's incredible psychological impact.
The physical impact is easy.

977
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,580
We can all work hard as human beings,
we can all put our body through that.

978
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,350
It's the psychological impact of knowing
six weeks from now, five weeks from now,

979
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:16,190
four weeks from now,

980
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,460
there's another bastards somewhere on
this planet training and he's gonna meet

981
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:22,580
you at a certain point and a certain
time and your whole family is going to be

982
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:25,130
there and everyone you went to school
with is going to be there and he can do

983
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:29,180
some shit that you can do and you know
what you've done to people that might get

984
00:51:29,181 --> 00:51:32,330
done to me. Absolutely. It's, and it,
it will, it's just a matter of time.

985
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:36,110
Is this the time? Is this at the
time? Maybe not. Hopefully not.

986
00:51:36,111 --> 00:51:37,820
We're going to train for it to be not and,
and not to be,

987
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:42,710
but it couldn't be the time,
you know? So it, it's, it's
a, it's a head trip. Imagine,

988
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,950
fuck. And as soon as it's over, just
like anything else, it's like, you know,

989
00:51:45,951 --> 00:51:50,210
you want to jump right back
in there. Oh, I could've done,
I would've, you know, x, y,

990
00:51:50,211 --> 00:51:52,280
and Z. There's all these other things that
we could have done better. Let's do it.

991
00:51:52,281 --> 00:51:54,860
Let's schedule another one,
boom and scheduled. Oh Shit.

992
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,010
Now all of a sudden the head trip kicks
in again as soon as it's scheduled.

993
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:01,970
And it's, you know, personal experience
of course. But every fighter,

994
00:52:01,971 --> 00:52:04,130
almost every fighter, because not
every, but almost every fighter,

995
00:52:04,131 --> 00:52:07,860
it's the same thing. It's the same
script over and over. It's a, it's,

996
00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:11,060
there's an interesting term that a fighter
takes when they realize they're never

997
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:13,670
going to be the best and they're
just sort of doing it to fight.

998
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:16,640
They're just going to take fights.
Yeah. You know, and that's a, that's a,

999
00:52:16,641 --> 00:52:20,300
it's a completely different turn.
They'd become a different fighter. Like,

1000
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:23,080
you could almost see their color
change, you know, they just, they,

1001
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,480
they go from being this streaking like
a thing that's constantly improving to

1002
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:32,210
something that levels off and in
fact usually dwindles a little bit.

1003
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,630
Sometimes guys get a little bit better.
I mean it varies on the athlete,

1004
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:39,830
but there's young guys had come up and
there's one beating or to beatings that

1005
00:52:39,831 --> 00:52:42,050
they get somewhere along the
line and make them realize like,

1006
00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:44,140
you're never going to beat
this guy. Not, you know,

1007
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,440
I'll take it out of him and may cause we,

1008
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:48,290
we have close contacts but boxing
look at James Kirkland. Yeah.

1009
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:51,320
Shooting Star right. Came in and the
gate, you know, he was the next big thing.

1010
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,880
Yeah. Had a little bit of
trouble. Lifestyle travel
outside the ring and you know,

1011
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:59,450
took a pretty good beating.
Now just he's kind of,

1012
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,470
is he maybe maintaining but
probably degrading, didn't
he? Um, didn't he have a,

1013
00:53:04,471 --> 00:53:07,160
have a real tough fight recently?
Um,

1014
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:12,120
had I not hear about that? Um,
the fuck is the tall kid hall.

1015
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:16,370
Williams motorcycle crash paralyzed.
It's a heartbreaking. How can a man,

1016
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,680
and that kid had such a tough
career. I mean, look who we fought.

1017
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,260
Look how well he did.
Couldn't get a fight.

1018
00:53:21,261 --> 00:53:24,290
Nobody would fight him because he's such
a tough son of a bitch who was one of

1019
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:27,060
the most dangerous and
feared guys for years.

1020
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:31,410
And then he slowly started to slow down
and then, you know, Martinez got him.

1021
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,270
You have a big left hand. He had some
tough fights, man. But you know that he,

1022
00:53:36,271 --> 00:53:40,290
the dude had a crazy work rate too. I
mean, nobody out punched Paul Williams.

1023
00:53:40,291 --> 00:53:43,050
That guy would come in.
Yeah, it was ridiculous.

1024
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:47,820
Some credible winky. Right. There's
another guy. Doesn't get enough credit.

1025
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:51,990
What a technical boxer. That guy
is so smart. So good defensively.

1026
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:55,800
You know the shell that he
be. Yeah. Hands up high man.

1027
00:53:55,801 --> 00:53:59,280
He broke a lot of dudes down with that.
Just with sheer technique and skill.

1028
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:02,880
He's a real skillful boxer.
I appreciate him like as a professional,

1029
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:06,690
I see what he does and like that's a
real goddamn professional fighting Tarver

1030
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:09,870
soon or I see the billboard, I'm pretty
sure I could be wrong. Wiki rights. Right.

1031
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:13,530
And Tarver. Yeah, that's good
fight. They're both are good.
You know, that's a good,

1032
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,220
you know, even as far as like levels of
their career to yeah, I'll watch that.

1033
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:20,520
Tara is doing real well at heavyweight
and you see that had a couple of

1034
00:54:20,521 --> 00:54:24,480
heavyweight fights. Why is winky
writing him fighting then names money,

1035
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,940
you know winky, right? Doesn't give
a fuck. Right. He'll fight anybody.

1036
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,620
He always has called people out. Yeah.
Cause Tarver looked real good as a,

1037
00:54:31,621 --> 00:54:32,281
as a heavyweight.

1038
00:54:32,281 --> 00:54:35,400
I forget who the fuck he fought but he
beat the shit out of somebody. Yeah.

1039
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,160
Beginner treadmill,
workout jumping.

1040
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:41,250
Cause I don't want to leave you
hanging warm up. Five minute walk,

1041
00:54:41,251 --> 00:54:42,300
three miles an hour round,

1042
00:54:42,301 --> 00:54:46,020
one 32nd jog at five miles an hour to
minute walk at three miles an hour.

1043
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,810
And you repeat that one,
two, three, four rounds.

1044
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:51,960
And the cool band is a simple five minute
walk, three miles an hour. Anybody.

1045
00:54:51,961 --> 00:54:55,470
Everybody can do that or their own
version of that. So I'm a coach.

1046
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,520
Here's The format I'm coaching you to
do it. Maybe you're one mile an hour,

1047
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:03,120
you know,
a 32nd job and then a two mile an hour,

1048
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:05,460
32nd jog and then one mile an hour,
two minute walk.

1049
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,050
Do you have something that can be
adapted to an elliptical machine? Um,

1050
00:55:09,570 --> 00:55:13,410
obviously you wouldn't be able to regulate
the miles an hour as cloak closely.

1051
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:16,340
Or the intensity is the Watson, an
elliptical machine. You know, there's,

1052
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:19,480
there's all of the machines have a
way of regulating intensity, right?

1053
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,890
And displaying it to you even on the
rower hadn't rows per second or per minute

1054
00:55:22,891 --> 00:55:24,810
or whatnot. So you can do the
same thing with rose as well.

1055
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,540
You can do the same thing.
Like Joey was talking before,

1056
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:30,720
y'all in your neighborhood, you walk
out your front door job to one mailbox,

1057
00:55:30,721 --> 00:55:33,380
walk to the next to jog to the mailbox,
walked in the next tape.

1058
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:35,820
Most plots are evenly sized
in most neighborhoods.

1059
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:39,120
I got a big hill on my street that
I'm scared of that I didn't ever run,

1060
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,550
but it's fucking huge.
It's a,

1061
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:44,850
it's a scary hill hill to one house and
walked back down. Don't do it that way.

1062
00:55:44,851 --> 00:55:47,910
When you, when you do a hill sprint
though, what is the rule like what do you,

1063
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:51,540
what should you do? Should you run for
30 seconds? Should you run for a minute?

1064
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:56,220
Like what's the, what's the smart way
to do it all depends. I picture cycles.

1065
00:55:56,410 --> 00:55:59,340
I break everything down in the
cyclists, a picture, three weeks cycles.

1066
00:55:59,430 --> 00:56:01,800
What are we trying to accomplish
over the next three weeks? Well,

1067
00:56:01,801 --> 00:56:05,100
I want to develop explosive power and
you have to re quads, glutes, hamstrings,

1068
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:08,640
calves or whatnot. Maybe just speed
off the line. Maybe it's enduring.

1069
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,930
So why are we going to the hill? You
know, and then we determine what the,

1070
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:14,640
what the intensity, what the
volume is going to be. Um,

1071
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,650
and it every three weeks it should change.

1072
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,430
So you can find another area that you
want to improve and then peak that out.

1073
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,680
Then maybe go back to the first area
or find a third area. Peak that out.

1074
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,670
So you're constantly

1075
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,700
peeking out a specific
area with strict rules.

1076
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,900
What is the one thing that you take
out a fighter's diets most commonly

1077
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,390
processed foods. Without
a doubt. You know,

1078
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,570
I'm an advocate of earth grown
nutrients is a term that I like to use.

1079
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,780
Is that like Paleo Diet type shit?
No,

1080
00:56:40,781 --> 00:56:44,080
but Paleo uses earth grown nutrients,
so EarthCorps nutrients.

1081
00:56:44,081 --> 00:56:46,630
It's like it's whole foods.
But when you say whole foods pick people,

1082
00:56:46,631 --> 00:56:49,990
picture supermarket chain,
whole foods also sells conventional food,

1083
00:56:49,991 --> 00:56:51,030
not just organic earth.

1084
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:55,390
Neutrik earth or nutrients means this
came from the earth unadulterated by man.

1085
00:56:55,391 --> 00:56:56,410
I walked out my backyard,

1086
00:56:56,411 --> 00:56:59,710
I pulled it out of the stream with my
bare hands and pulled it out of the ground

1087
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:03,100
and I didn't even plant the seeds. Let
say it just naturally grew right there.

1088
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,370
That's EarthCorps. And the closer
we can get to that, the better.

1089
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:10,300
So what I try and do with my athletes or
clients or anybody I deal with is I try

1090
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:13,570
and make suggestions and tips
and then from my experience,

1091
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:14,950
try this instead of that,

1092
00:57:14,951 --> 00:57:17,560
you're gonna use a high fructose
corn syrup based Ketchup.

1093
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:19,630
When you can get this one right over here,

1094
00:57:19,631 --> 00:57:23,140
you can make your own with tomatoes and
some vinegar and some salt. And you know,

1095
00:57:23,141 --> 00:57:27,520
maybe a little bit of a Guy Bay on your
own stope tastes exactly the same or the

1096
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:31,050
earth grown one tastes a heck of
a lot better, you know? So yeah,

1097
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,340
that's the thing that I try
and do with the athletes.

1098
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:37,930
But you're okay with Pasta
Pasta? Yeah. Yeah. Um, pasta be,

1099
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:42,670
because athletes require a lot of sugar.
It's a lot of fuel. Turbos Wednesday.

1100
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:46,840
Um, we do, I call, you know, a refeed
Wednesday night, which is typically,

1101
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,460
it's a comfort meal. So we placate the
emotional side, the emotional eating side,

1102
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:54,610
even during training camps,
like light candles and shit,

1103
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,130
if that's what's necessary,
you know, you know,

1104
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,770
recommend maybe the athlete does it
with their wife or their family or their

1105
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:02,560
girl, they're their friends, they're
the games on or whatever it is.

1106
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:05,770
So you can do it any way you want. Glass
of wine at the table with the family,

1107
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,380
you know, any which way you want
to do. It's the emotional side,

1108
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:11,620
but also nutritionally the athletes
getting everything that they need.

1109
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:16,030
So I like to make my pasta with
chemo and not a Keema Pasta.

1110
00:58:16,031 --> 00:58:18,670
Just straight keenwah you know
lots of people. Yeah, it's awesome.

1111
00:58:18,671 --> 00:58:21,490
Lots of people dig it. So it's,
it's a pasta night in theory,

1112
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:25,330
but it's not pasta noodles. It's not Zeni.
It's not, you know, in any of that stuff.

1113
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,600
Although you can't do it, you can get a
brown rice if you want to go gluten free.

1114
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:31,510
So this keen wa it's Keenwah Pasta.
Is that what you're saying?

1115
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:35,210
Like the actual pasta itself can use it.
I prefer just straight cane loss.

1116
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,710
So it looks more like a Chilean.
Me I've been using for a while now,

1117
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:42,280
just mixing it with vegetables and stuff
like that. It's still confused though.

1118
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:46,750
So there's no pasta. There can be pasta,
but you're calling it pasta pasta.

1119
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,800
It's a refeed night. So we were talking
about, but you can certainly use pasta.

1120
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,860
Okay. But it's cane while
it's not possible place the
Pos. Right, right. But I'm,

1121
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:59,080
what I'm confused and when I was asking
is pasta. Okay. Actual white paws,

1122
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:03,130
Barilla Pasta, Spaghetti, Spaghetti,
that certainly can be used.

1123
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:04,840
It can be it or a brown,
right.

1124
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,560
Round Rice space pasta or a
tapioca based gluten free pasta.

1125
00:59:08,561 --> 00:59:13,030
Or Quinoa Pasta or maybe just keen one
noodle noodles by itself or maybe no

1126
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:16,870
noodles at all. You're just going to
have the sauce, which is a red sauce,

1127
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:20,680
tomato base peppers and onions and
garlic and herbs and spices and all those

1128
00:59:20,681 --> 00:59:23,870
good things thrown in there too. What
about a Zico Pasta? Yeah. Awesome.

1129
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:26,270
I love that. Good stuff. Yeah, I've
been using that a bunch lately. Okay.

1130
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:31,300
Is there any benefit to taking like
plain white pasta or taking as ego pasta

1131
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:35,030
like carbohydrate wines? Absolutely.
Carb load glycogen stores. Oh No.

1132
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:38,240
I'm saying which is which one gives you
more benefit would what does you'll give

1133
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:41,990
you more benefit? Would straight
white pasta give you more benefit?

1134
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:45,650
I would lean towards the [inaudible]
because it's closer to the earth grown

1135
00:59:45,651 --> 00:59:47,910
nutrient category and it's,

1136
00:59:47,911 --> 00:59:52,820
it's higher in a variety of nutrients
where if you go just the straight durum

1137
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:55,520
wheat pasta, which is like a standard
Barilla pasta where you getting any,

1138
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:58,730
you know, olive garden and
whatnot. There was a high, yes,

1139
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,020
there's a high glycogen content.
So if you're only goal is glycogen stores,

1140
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:05,450
then you can certainly
get that from the pasta.

1141
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:10,190
But if your goal is to get glycogen
plus fiber plus essential fats, plus,

1142
01:00:10,270 --> 01:00:13,100
you know, vitamin B or whatever
the heck else is in there,

1143
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,460
and then you go to the [inaudible] and
you keep getting closer back to the earth

1144
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:19,040
because there's more vital
nutrients contained in that.

1145
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,660
But what's clean wall he wants to, it's
a grain. And what's it taste like? Wood.

1146
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:26,490
It's delicious.
King was kind of it.

1147
01:00:26,491 --> 01:00:29,150
It takes on the flavor of
what it's being served with.

1148
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:32,090
So I made a recipe name when
I was working with Mike Pyle,

1149
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:35,630
when he fought her cart. Almeda and the,
you know, I come up with the recipes.

1150
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:38,900
I'm Italian dude, like grow kid
in the kitchen. I'm rolling. No,

1151
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:41,810
we're making simple as, you know,
fried no one in our kitchen. And uh,

1152
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,120
been doing it my whole life.
So I worked with these guys,

1153
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:48,080
pile lives a few miles from me and Vegas
go over his house where I would've been

1154
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:51,830
eat for dinner. Start missing
some recipes. King La,

1155
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:55,570
I got some keen ground
Turkey, asparagus, Renna,

1156
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,960
onions and mushrooms chopped each
one. I uh, you know, light saute,

1157
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:02,540
low heat so it tastes you don't
kill all the nutrients. Low heat,

1158
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:05,970
saute the vegetables. How long do you
saute something to not kill the nutrients?

1159
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,890
Um,
man,

1160
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:10,370
as long as it takes for it to kind of
soften up or get to the flavor that you

1161
01:01:10,371 --> 01:01:10,611
want.

1162
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:14,540
Like a peppers and they have a really
hard exterior outer shell so you actually

1163
01:01:14,541 --> 01:01:17,960
want to saute the pepper is a little
bit to break it down to unlock the

1164
01:01:17,961 --> 01:01:18,471
nutrients.

1165
01:01:18,471 --> 01:01:21,020
Otherwise it's going to digest through
and it's going to fall out really.

1166
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:24,380
And you won't get all that. So it actually
is better for you to do that, to cook,

1167
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:29,810
to cook peppers in, in certain cases.
Isn't it the case with tomatoes as well?

1168
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,510
If there's something that gets
activated in tomatoes when you cook it,

1169
01:01:32,511 --> 01:01:37,240
that doesn't, when it's when it's raw,
I'm not sure specifically on tomato butts.

1170
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,120
Things like spinach.
Most vegetables with an outer layer,

1171
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:45,800
you will unlock a more nutrients
when you actually heat that up,

1172
01:01:45,830 --> 01:01:49,550
but not always because you still want to
have them raw and fresh because there's

1173
01:01:49,551 --> 01:01:53,840
a ton of other VI, other vital nutrients
and it's called lycopene. Lycopene.

1174
01:01:53,841 --> 01:01:57,800
It's an antioxidant and it comes
from cooked tomatoes. Julie,

1175
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:01,520
if you want to add good local
place as good Kim law, swingers,

1176
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:06,200
I usually always get the side of can
want and it's good and the Abbott Tuna

1177
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,790
Salad there where it's just like tennis
out on lettuce and stuff and has,

1178
01:02:09,870 --> 01:02:12,830
it's on a bed of kin law and I always
get double Chenwa and that's like one of

1179
01:02:12,831 --> 01:02:16,450
the best salads that you can get around.
Know they got a,

1180
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,040
they have Jamaican jerk chicken
would keen wa it's the, that was the

1181
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,830
closest I could have.
If I don't want to have pasta,

1182
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:24,390
if I would just want to try it one time,

1183
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:27,150
like what's the closest I
could have for the head,

1184
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:31,050
you know what I'm saying like that I
could just eat like a pasta and not really

1185
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:33,680
trip on it. And it's like
when I like lamb, uh,

1186
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:37,620
10 minutes later I'm fucking tripping.
I just want to eat something and not trip.

1187
01:02:37,650 --> 01:02:41,590
What can I eat that that's
closest to pasta? No fucking Tofu.

1188
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,680
Cause I have a heart attack McKean whites.

1189
01:02:43,730 --> 01:02:47,100
It's no idea you're going to serve him.

1190
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:51,190
Keywan he's going to come back in here
and scream for 15 fucking watched.

1191
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:52,500
And I was like a girl.

1192
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,350
Let me tell you,
it's Mozzarella cheese.

1193
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,700
We'll fucking pasta sauce and real pasta.

1194
01:03:05,810 --> 01:03:09,690
He'll fucking hippies scanning
some fucking spaghetti.

1195
01:03:10,110 --> 01:03:12,470
My fucking hamp put curry
in my spaghetti and clamp.

1196
01:03:12,471 --> 01:03:16,320
So as I talked to that bitch for
six years, my mother, fuck I am.

1197
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:18,330
You understand what? You
fucked up. One of my recipes,

1198
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:22,500
Stacy poker Ludo had the worst mashed
potatoes of all time when you had to talk

1199
01:03:22,501 --> 01:03:25,950
to her for a fucking year on Thanksgiving.
That's how serious I take this shit.

1200
01:03:26,190 --> 01:03:27,030
So let's say,

1201
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:30,420
so I should maybe just stick to the
spinach pasta and go from there.

1202
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:34,170
Water myself down. Let's, let's back
up a second because what's your goal?

1203
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:38,650
Don't tell me what you want. What do you
mean? What's our goal up pasta. But I've,

1204
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,940
since I left the east coast, now
I, I'm okay with once a week. Yeah.

1205
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,480
And I don't have to have
sausage and meatballs. I'm okay.

1206
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,240
But you hear what he's saying, what it was
he saying? He's saying, what's the goal?

1207
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,670
What's the sweat? He's always saying,
what's your hope? A little bit.

1208
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:54,350
Maybe just to help a little bit. What
do you recommend? How bad it was?

1209
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,830
A bowl of pasta every week, but help but
help what? Your heart, your cholesterol,

1210
01:03:58,950 --> 01:04:00,540
your uniqueness.
What?

1211
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:05,220
It depends on how close you are to the
brink or how far you are from your goal

1212
01:04:05,221 --> 01:04:09,360
or how close you already your goal.
Just eat healthier pasta with the Turkey.

1213
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:12,450
Like I liked what you, what you want
in the book. It's fucking delicious.

1214
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:16,290
And the chilies fucking smoking too. If
you make those recipes, you're golden man.

1215
01:04:16,291 --> 01:04:18,870
And you had the gluten free option.
You've got the Vegan option,

1216
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:19,411
you got the athletes.

1217
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:22,350
I ain't gonna lie to you the first two
times I made the past, I used fucking,

1218
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,240
you know, Ron zoning blow
transition. That's fine.

1219
01:04:25,241 --> 01:04:28,070
I've got to go rock zone and he's
been around for 30 fucking years. I,

1220
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,530
he's got to know Mike Dolce two fucking
years. I got to go with Ron Zoning.

1221
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:34,890
That's my fucking man.
If I loaned me the number two,

1222
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:37,350
I don't like that string with Joey.
I mean this is a,

1223
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:40,400
an uncomfortable moment here, but I got
to confront you on this because well,

1224
01:04:40,401 --> 01:04:42,750
we got here is a guy who was
like a nutritional expert.

1225
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,410
You're using them as a sounding board.
No, no, no, no, but honestly, brother,

1226
01:04:46,411 --> 01:04:49,590
you know what you got to do. No, no,
no. I'm asking him what's better for me.

1227
01:04:49,591 --> 01:04:52,680
I'm not trying to be funny with them.
I'm asking him what's better.

1228
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:53,760
If I like pasta,

1229
01:04:53,970 --> 01:04:56,940
what is the closest thing I could have
if I wanted to have a little healthy?

1230
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,840
That's my homie Joe. A little healthier.
It's my fucking question and that's it.

1231
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,200
A little healthier.
Donald fucking saves.

1232
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,870
I'm telling you this cut me off.
He would stop me.

1233
01:05:06,871 --> 01:05:11,390
I never find the guests never sold to you,
Joe.

1234
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:13,560
I just want to hear him
talking about nutrition.

1235
01:05:13,561 --> 01:05:16,860
You know I'm a fat fuck and maybe I
like to explain to the fucking running

1236
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:17,960
technique,
but he said when

1237
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,260
he confronted you, he said, I
pulled them with the fucking goal.

1238
01:05:22,261 --> 01:05:23,980
Was your playing law and order?

1239
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:29,070
I'm saying to him [inaudible] I to fucking
maybe eat a little healthier pasta.

1240
01:05:29,351 --> 01:05:30,880
That's why I don't eat
the meat of the sausage.

1241
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:32,470
Is there any way to make
it a little healthier?

1242
01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:37,260
Maybe the spinach pasta maybe the whole
week without suffering that much and

1243
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:41,490
when I taste the whole wheat, am I
going to go fucking dolce? What I'm,

1244
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:44,910
I'm getting back.
He was past the goal of the pasta.

1245
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,920
What's your goal exactly?
What's your life goal?

1246
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:49,390
Where are we trying to
go with your health?

1247
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:52,690
With our fitness to 70 and
my head was too fucking big.

1248
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,150
I was going into meet people.
They thought I had cancer.

1249
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,640
I swear to fucking God dog.
They get to tell.

1250
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:00,370
That's why I went in and I started
doing the upright rows to fill this in a

1251
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:02,440
little bit now because
it got so fucking skinny.

1252
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,150
I thought it was going to put
one of those voice machines.

1253
01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:05,470
That's what people are looking at.

1254
01:06:05,471 --> 01:06:09,850
Me and auditions and meetings like I was
going to put a voice machine so when I

1255
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:14,110
hurt my nemesis, just the
consequences of having a one man show.

1256
01:06:14,111 --> 01:06:18,070
I booked up this area here a little
bit. Right. Needs to be 280 oh, I know.

1257
01:06:18,071 --> 01:06:21,370
I read the fucking thing. Not
lost 110 pounds. How's the fuck?

1258
01:06:21,371 --> 01:06:25,090
Didn't you eat all that shit in one day?
That's 19 year old died.

1259
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:26,920
That's when you're whacking off.
Twice a day.

1260
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,950
You're fucking drinking and you're
fucking somebody eight times a day.

1261
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:32,440
That thing that you were eating was a May,

1262
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:36,100
a pepperoni pizza at night
with a provolone on it.

1263
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:42,040
The last snake, he can't eat that
no fucking way. 10 years ago,

1264
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:45,940
maybe that diet that you eat now, what
do you mean? Years ago when I met him,

1265
01:06:45,941 --> 01:06:49,540
we went to the Miami Improv.
My jaw dropped. When you
order food, I fucked him.

1266
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:53,050
My jaw drop. Joe Rogan. Why?
Because you ate three entrees.

1267
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:58,000
It's still this mother fucker. I'm sorry,
Mister Dolce talk that you just ate.

1268
01:06:58,001 --> 01:07:02,570
I ate fucking egg Omelet, you know, with
eggs. No fucking egg whites, cheese.

1269
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,500
I mean the Diet wasn't being,
I feel like I work out hard.

1270
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,320
I eat whatever the fuck I want to eat.
And when I'm done with a show,

1271
01:07:08,321 --> 01:07:12,490
especially two shows, I'm hungry man. I
eat a lot of food. A lot of stake. Yeah.

1272
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:16,000
Are you Paleo guy? Yeah,
well I don't follow it 100%,

1273
01:07:16,001 --> 01:07:21,001
but the majority of my diet is essentially
most of what I tried to eat is just

1274
01:07:21,221 --> 01:07:23,530
salads and meat. That's most
of it. I try to eat. Yeah.

1275
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,440
And then I'll throw in a little bit of
pasta here and there every now and then,

1276
01:07:26,441 --> 01:07:28,090
or if I'm on the road and
I'm going to run, you know,

1277
01:07:28,091 --> 01:07:31,510
I eat what I can to try to stay
healthy. Sure. Always supplement,

1278
01:07:31,511 --> 01:07:35,800
supplement every day. Counseling a lot
of fish, oil, multivitamins, keylated,

1279
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:36,880
minerals,
the whole deal.

1280
01:07:36,881 --> 01:07:40,960
I take a a gang of shit all day
long and I drink Kale shakes.

1281
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:44,400
I tried to drink them every
day. Sure. So, um, that's, uh,

1282
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:49,300
that's the majority of what I
do. I, um, but I think what,

1283
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,750
what,

1284
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:52,960
what you were bringing up with Joey's a
real good point that a lot of people say,

1285
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:54,390
oh, I just want to Sorta, they got it.

1286
01:07:54,420 --> 01:07:57,010
They're kind of dabbling in the
idea of improving themselves.

1287
01:07:57,190 --> 01:08:00,430
And the real way to do it is you got to
write down what the fuck you want and

1288
01:08:00,431 --> 01:08:03,370
then go after it because otherwise you
live in sort of a wishy washy world.

1289
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:07,360
You know, if you decide I'm going to
get down to bang, I'm going to do this,

1290
01:08:07,361 --> 01:08:10,750
I'm going to run a marathon in less
than five hours, I'm going to, you know,

1291
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:14,320
whenever the fuck it is, you got to
write that shit down and go for it.

1292
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,040
What I tell people is the best

1293
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:16,990
advice it is,
I,

1294
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,040
I've ever heard is the best advice I ever
came up with is it live your life like

1295
01:08:23,241 --> 01:08:24,590
you're the hero in your movie.

1296
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:28,200
And right now is when the fucking
movie starts and your life is a shitbag

1297
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:28,851
disaster.

1298
01:08:28,851 --> 01:08:31,610
Like every fucking Arnold sports nigger
move where he wakes up and makes a

1299
01:08:31,611 --> 01:08:34,850
blender full of pizza and ice cream and
that's what he, you know what I mean?

1300
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:36,470
Those guys were like on the brink,

1301
01:08:36,471 --> 01:08:39,110
they put the gun in their mouth and they
put it down so you see a photo of their

1302
01:08:39,111 --> 01:08:43,640
daughter. Pretend that's you.
Pretend you are right now.

1303
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:47,810
You're in the part of the movie that
starts and it shows you as a fucking loser

1304
01:08:48,050 --> 01:08:50,030
and just decide not to be a loser anymore.

1305
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:54,260
Live your life like there's a documentary
crew following you around and you are

1306
01:08:54,261 --> 01:08:58,940
analyzing your own behavior to what you
would want to do so that your kids one

1307
01:08:58,941 --> 01:09:00,170
day would look back at it and,
and,

1308
01:09:00,171 --> 01:09:03,500
and see that documentary and
look on it with pride. Like, Wow,

1309
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:07,460
my dad was a bad motherfucker. He
really did what he had to do. Wow.

1310
01:09:07,461 --> 01:09:11,000
My mom really got her shit together.
I love a success story,

1311
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:12,830
but even more than a success story,

1312
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,940
I like a dude who fucks his life up and
then gets it back together again. Story.

1313
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:19,940
Those are my favorite stories.
And the way to do that,

1314
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:21,410
you've got to write shit down.

1315
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,860
You got to think that you are the
hero in your own fucking movie.

1316
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,620
And then you get to sit down and
you've got to write shit down.

1317
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,240
Write down what you need to do.

1318
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:32,290
Most people play the role of the
victim in the movie, right? Yeah.

1319
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:34,040
This life is fucking me over,
man.

1320
01:09:34,041 --> 01:09:37,490
I could have had this and I should have
had that. And why does this guy get that?

1321
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:38,810
And why does that guy get this?

1322
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:42,310
And all things that are completely
unrelated to you, all things that you,

1323
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:47,150
you find other people's success as a
downfall on your own existence instead of

1324
01:09:47,151 --> 01:09:49,430
being inspired instead of
choosing to be positive,

1325
01:09:49,431 --> 01:09:51,880
instead of like improving constantly on,

1326
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:56,030
on the direction of trying to achieve
whatever the fuck you have written down

1327
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:58,340
and you just sit around and spiral,
you know,

1328
01:09:58,490 --> 01:10:01,760
there's nothing more miserable than
sitting around someone that's fucking

1329
01:10:01,761 --> 01:10:04,640
complaining all the time. And he's
one of the most annoying things ever.

1330
01:10:04,641 --> 01:10:05,750
Everybody hates it.

1331
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:08,930
When someone just sits around and they
complain about their life and they don't

1332
01:10:08,931 --> 01:10:12,920
do Jack Shit about it and
you tip toe around it, you
don't know what to say. Well,

1333
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:14,600
she gets upset when you bring that up.

1334
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:18,140
I don't want to bring that up and you
want to go, you fucking crazy bitch.

1335
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:20,240
You know what's wrong with your life?
Stop.

1336
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:24,620
Stop announcing it to everybody else
and go out and fix that shit and that's

1337
01:10:24,621 --> 01:10:28,190
tough love. Tough love is what
everybody needs. Me included.

1338
01:10:28,370 --> 01:10:31,220
That's the only good thing about
like assholes on the Internet.

1339
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,440
Sometimes they say things.
That's right. Yeah.

1340
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:36,980
Sometimes Kuntz we'll say shitty things
to you on the Internet about a show you

1341
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:39,470
did or a thing you said or you know,

1342
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,690
oh the fucking neck
choking me on the podcast.

1343
01:10:41,691 --> 01:10:44,780
You're an asshole for even thinking
like that and you know part party you is

1344
01:10:44,781 --> 01:10:47,330
like, fuck you. Who the
fuck are you? But you,

1345
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:51,470
you feel bad if things are correct,
you feel bad.

1346
01:10:51,471 --> 01:10:54,830
If someone nails Ya,
you'll feel bad if you really did,

1347
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:57,860
if you didn't do anything
wrong and someone actually
a content is just like they

1348
01:10:57,861 --> 01:10:59,350
look like a crazy person like B.

1349
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:03,320
You have to be able to have that honest
assessment of yourself and the only way

1350
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:06,320
you can do that as you're taking
account of yourself all day long,

1351
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:08,960
you're taking account, you're writing
down what the fuck you need to do.

1352
01:11:08,961 --> 01:11:13,890
You're doing it. You have a mindset that
you want to maintain throughout the day.

1353
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:14,160
Don't

1354
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,260
let the world maintain your mindset.

1355
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:20,730
You choose what mindset that you are going
to maintain and I fucking do that for

1356
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:24,300
sure. That's it. I tell you
words of wisdom by Joe Rogan.

1357
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,990
I got on Twitter yesterday that said that
whenever I was on a podcast where you,

1358
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:31,650
we were racially insensitive. Why
was that? And he didn't. He didn't,

1359
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,723
he wasn't a Douchey,

1360
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,690
are sensitive about the douchey thing
to have and it was seven in the morning

1361
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,610
and I'm one of those guys that,
you know what you want early, man,

1362
01:11:39,611 --> 01:11:43,050
I want to rob me up at eight.
You want to round me up at 11 go,

1363
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:46,200
well let's seven don't fucking
around me up, dawg. I'm smoking dope.

1364
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,950
I'm playing with the cats. I'm drinking.
Cool. I'm having a good old time solo,

1365
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,750
like a doctor,
you know,

1366
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:55,530
giggling by myself and stupid jokes I'm
writing and all of a sudden this guy

1367
01:11:55,550 --> 01:12:00,360
sends me this and I look at it
and I go this, fuck. You're right.

1368
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:06,370
He's right. I'm fucking
racially insensitive every
day. And I wrote back to,

1369
01:12:06,371 --> 01:12:08,460
you're right,
but at least I had racist.

1370
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,740
Then you got a right
to say something to me.

1371
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,370
But because we're racially insensitive
and I'm a sensitive to my own race,

1372
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,910
you know his, his, I don't even, I
don't even like my own race. Yeah, no,

1373
01:12:17,911 --> 01:12:18,370
it's the way.

1374
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:22,410
I don't mostly Italian with a little bit
of Irish and I avoid most Italians and

1375
01:12:22,411 --> 01:12:26,520
most hiring shy. They're five crazy
genetics. I don't like my race.

1376
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:30,980
So there I think the idea of being
racially insensitive is ridiculous because

1377
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:34,320
what they're getting upset at you is
pointing out real shit about races.

1378
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:37,680
The pointing I real shit that you think
is funny that you sing and if they get

1379
01:12:37,681 --> 01:12:39,180
upset at that, that's
on them, man. You're,

1380
01:12:39,181 --> 01:12:42,270
you're attaching yourself to something
you have no fucking control over and you

1381
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:45,420
even have pride, which is one of
the most ridiculous things ever.

1382
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:49,960
I'm fucking pride that I'm from
this part of the ground. You know,

1383
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,120
it's just the stupidest thing ever. The
idea that, you know, I'm a proud this.

1384
01:12:54,121 --> 01:12:58,530
I'm a proud dad as a proud Greek.
Shut the fuck up. Just shut up.

1385
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:02,430
Shut up with your dummy.
You fucking individual on planet earth.

1386
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:08,120
Stop it putting too many later
on himself cause they're pussies.

1387
01:13:08,271 --> 01:13:11,940
If you put a tape recording in my room,
you like Joey, you fucking racist.

1388
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:14,910
But then if you look at my walls,
you're like, you ain't fucking racist.

1389
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,740
You got it.
We've got Bruce Lee on this wall.

1390
01:13:16,741 --> 01:13:18,000
You've got Richard Pryor on this wall.

1391
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,630
I'll tell you where Hendricks on this
fucking wall nationalism is sorta even

1392
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:23,010
kind of admirable.
Kind of creepy,

1393
01:13:23,011 --> 01:13:27,330
but kind of admirable is Brazil
because they are so nationalistic.

1394
01:13:27,331 --> 01:13:29,490
They love Brazil so much.
Man.

1395
01:13:29,491 --> 01:13:32,880
I had never been to a country
that's so pro their country.

1396
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:37,220
Then Brazil passionate. Right?
Oh my God. It's incredible. Yeah.

1397
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:42,060
They're fucking more passionate
about their nationalism.

1398
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:45,630
Any country I've ever been a part of, I
wish that was here. That passion, right?

1399
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,850
That example from Brazil
came over here to America.

1400
01:13:47,851 --> 01:13:49,080
I think we need a little bit of that.

1401
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:52,510
As long as it's not against
other countries. My,

1402
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:56,760
my issue is not with passion and pride in,
in the individual country.

1403
01:13:56,761 --> 01:13:57,880
It's you against the,

1404
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:00,810
the rest of the world that think
that's fucking pointless and nonsense.

1405
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,730
That that shit drives me nuts.
Nuts, such shit. And you know,

1406
01:14:05,731 --> 01:14:08,250
but there's is a funny thing,
like when I was in jersey,

1407
01:14:08,251 --> 01:14:12,010
somebody was fighting and somebody was
yelling USA. Then I thought about what you

1408
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:16,040
told me about Brazil when Mike
Powell one by one, they were yellow.

1409
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:21,250
I'm a fag or yelling. What was the
word I see? I go, or some fat guy.

1410
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:22,250
No,
or something like that.

1411
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:25,720
I go and the translator thought
they were chanting Ciga. No,

1412
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,390
they thought they were chanting junior
dos Santos, his name and I said,

1413
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:31,030
I don't think that's what
they're saying. Yeah, like she,

1414
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:33,970
she didn't want to say like what
what they actually were saying.

1415
01:14:34,450 --> 01:14:37,920
It's funny because now if you go to a
little league game or something like that,

1416
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:42,520
you can not even allowed to say
nothing negative like swing the ball.

1417
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:46,210
You can't say nothing. In today's
society, the way they bring up these kids,

1418
01:14:46,211 --> 01:14:50,110
if you go to a stadium now to watch
a baseball game or football game,

1419
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:51,790
it's a bunch of fucking people.

1420
01:14:51,791 --> 01:14:54,560
You can ranch dressing except for
the Dodgers state and you're like,

1421
01:14:54,561 --> 01:14:57,220
who were they were, they were fucking,
you got to go there with fight gear on,

1422
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,020
but fucking everywhere else it's pretty
fucking decent. Like nobody says nothing.

1423
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,410
It's not like, hey you mother. When
I was a kid and I go to Shea Stadium,

1424
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:09,970
does fucking Christ Stir Boston Games
in the 70s they'd throw you off the

1425
01:15:09,971 --> 01:15:13,780
fucking balcony. Now we live in
a society where you go to a game,

1426
01:15:13,781 --> 01:15:17,440
people pay 300 for a ticket and
they're well behaved. In Jersey.

1427
01:15:17,441 --> 01:15:18,640
They were a little fucking crazy,

1428
01:15:18,641 --> 01:15:22,480
but that was the craziest you somebody
that had a heart attack on the side,

1429
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,630
something had fights.

1430
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:27,820
You mean somebody was fighting and when
[inaudible] was fighting so many had the

1431
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:30,250
hardest time had somebody,
somebody dropped from drunkeness,

1432
01:15:30,251 --> 01:15:33,670
one of those fucking loud a Jersey deals.
The guy behind me kept yelling,

1433
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,950
looking for work,
looking for work,

1434
01:15:35,951 --> 01:15:40,270
and then he would sit down and pass out
for 10 minutes looking for as my uncle.

1435
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,100
He didn't even know it was fine.
He just kept saying looking for work.

1436
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:46,690
That's the cool thing about live events.
The cool thing in the bad thing,

1437
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:49,840
it's like you might get lucky and sit
next to Joey Diaz or you might get fucked

1438
01:15:49,841 --> 01:15:53,290
and sit next to a couple of drunk
assholes. Absolutely. Most likely.

1439
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:58,130
Possibly. It depends. We
never know though. It's,

1440
01:15:58,131 --> 01:16:01,090
it's interesting how different parts of
the country have like very distinct ways

1441
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:06,070
of gathering and crowds to
like east coast. There are
a lot more aggressive. Man,

1442
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:10,330
I would hate to be in your face.
Want to compete.

1443
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:15,370
I would hate to be in Jersey this week
cause that is the worst type of crowd in

1444
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:19,570
Jersey. What is it? What's this week that
king's a plane in the fucking finals.

1445
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:23,950
Let me give you an example. Team.
The hockey team with Jersey,

1446
01:16:23,951 --> 01:16:26,380
when they won last time they went,

1447
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:31,590
they won and they went to every bar in a
50 mile radius with the Stanley Cup and

1448
01:16:33,150 --> 01:16:35,440
it had a drink. And then I was
thinking about when I was a kid,

1449
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,650
you know how people say to you now
owe America American footballs weak.

1450
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:43,780
Fucking uh, uh, rugby is the sport.
You know what though? I grew up,

1451
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,560
I played street hockey and Jersey and
one of those leaves for three weeks and

1452
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,760
that was one time where I actually
doubted my man at the age of 13.

1453
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:56,440
I did that for three weeks because
it's not hockey sticks and sneakers.

1454
01:16:56,650 --> 01:16:59,380
There's another variable
involving this cars,

1455
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:04,330
com cars and you don't get,
you ain't real until you get hit by a car.

1456
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,370
You know what I'm saying? Like that's
how you get props. Like dog, which Joe,

1457
01:17:07,371 --> 01:17:09,670
he got hit by a car but he
was playing next Tuesday. I,

1458
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,020
that's how you got props
by getting hit by a car.

1459
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:15,720
Like people would smash into til bro
Breaks weren't good back then either.

1460
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:20,160
Listen, when you broke a Cadillac, a
glass, not a windshield because I want,

1461
01:17:20,161 --> 01:17:20,991
understand what I'm saying?

1462
01:17:20,991 --> 01:17:25,991
People when you dented a fucking Cadillac
grill in the 70s you want going to a

1463
01:17:26,721 --> 01:17:30,410
hospital that's an instant fuck my name.
You know,

1464
01:17:30,411 --> 01:17:33,500
squeezing the ball for the rest of
your life though with different causes.

1465
01:17:33,501 --> 01:17:36,740
It's not like hitting the fucking Hyundai
now with a thing. Bends a little bit.

1466
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,900
Right. I used to play street hockey with
Tom Mccann, hockey sneakers, Tom Mccann,

1467
01:17:41,901 --> 01:17:43,150
especially black bottoms.

1468
01:17:43,151 --> 01:17:46,760
So you would stick dog and they had
these things where it was just you played

1469
01:17:46,761 --> 01:17:50,870
for your neighborhood, like
for your block, like dirty
a street. Had a team. Again,

1470
01:17:50,871 --> 01:17:53,930
it's 51st street and you would walk
over there where your hockey sticks,

1471
01:17:53,931 --> 01:17:55,880
no roller skates and
there wasn't a street.

1472
01:17:55,881 --> 01:17:59,330
And if you were in the middle of a
fucking oh role and the car was coming,

1473
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,340
you that mother Fucker,
you either had to wait,

1474
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,370
he was hitting you and somebody
would get hit once a fucking month.

1475
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,310
And that was like your badge of honor.
Like those times,

1476
01:18:07,311 --> 01:18:08,900
like he got hit by a car blog.

1477
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:11,840
His head went through the side of a
glass and he's coming back to play on

1478
01:18:11,841 --> 01:18:14,570
Tuesday.
That was this week in Jersey.

1479
01:18:14,571 --> 01:18:18,380
You do not want to be in Jersey
and the plane in La. So this week,

1480
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:21,350
like Wednesday night, you ain't get no
sole out. You're going to sell out. Well,

1481
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:23,090
I'm going to sell out.
We're going to do fucking great.

1482
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:26,810
But the rest of the city you'll be
fucking deck. There's the king's a devils.

1483
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:30,180
The Devil's kingdom starts Wednesday.
That's amazing. I didn't even know today.

1484
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:34,970
Huh? Somebody it was like, yeah, the
kings are playing in the finals in Jersey.

1485
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,240
I don't know where they're playing on
Wednesday, but whenever the fuck it is,

1486
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,660
you don't want to be. So it's the
kings are there. The hockey team,

1487
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:43,760
I didn't even know that they
had a hockey team members,

1488
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:47,110
but they are the devils Harris Devil.
The Devil's are from Jersey.

1489
01:18:47,111 --> 01:18:50,540
Think the king kings. Oh,
La Kings, right. That right.

1490
01:18:50,541 --> 01:18:55,520
So remember Harris Pete used to work for
the kings. Harris. Pete worked for them.

1491
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,060
He used to, he used to be
like a hockey coach with them,

1492
01:18:58,061 --> 01:19:01,640
so he knew all those guys.
I don't remember that.

1493
01:19:02,570 --> 01:19:04,790
I didn't know that. I just remember
he worked at the comedy store.

1494
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:07,310
And then didn't you get in a bad
motorcycle accident when? I Dunno.

1495
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:08,713
I think he hurt himself.

1496
01:19:08,990 --> 01:19:11,690
He used to drive a all the
way up the coast and his bike,

1497
01:19:11,691 --> 01:19:12,740
but I'm pretty sure he wrecked.

1498
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:14,290
Okay.

1499
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:17,230
That's so sad about Paul
Williams, man, young kid.

1500
01:19:17,231 --> 01:19:20,290
What do you know about promising? I just
saw the headline and read the story yet.

1501
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:22,690
John. Not much man. How
the story, his brother,

1502
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,440
you're on a fucking motorcycle in
2012 what's he doing on a motorcycle?

1503
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:30,370
Awesome Burger on a motorcycle. Got
millions of dollars. It's in the contract.

1504
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:32,650
I understand you want to be evil
can eat well. You know what?

1505
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:36,610
Go out to a fucking circle out in the
swamps and ride your bike around in

1506
01:19:36,611 --> 01:19:39,310
circles with the elm and the chicken.
Have a suck good Dick.

1507
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:43,750
But the drive a motorcycle in today's
society and my heart goes out to you.

1508
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,720
Seriously. Especially Joe Rogan.
You'll see them on the phone.

1509
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,130
Borrow five cause yeah,

1510
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:52,570
doing 90 in between because when you're
stuck in bumper to bumper, scary. It's so,

1511
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:53,890
you know a different world.

1512
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:57,250
They live in a different world than
you live in their world is the world of

1513
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:01,660
there on a ride and it's a a fucking
engine strapped between their legs.

1514
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,270
They're risking life.
A red band.

1515
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,170
What's the story you told me that they
played a fucking video for me. What?

1516
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:08,190
The guy with the helmet

1517
01:20:08,190 --> 01:20:10,710
on where he chopped the car in
half. A little lady and I, yeah,

1518
01:20:10,711 --> 01:20:13,800
we played it on right here at the deer.
That should happen on a more,

1519
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:18,210
you're chopping a beer and a half
with a fucking motorcycle. Yeah.

1520
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,720
Yeah. That was a crazy video. What

1521
01:20:21,310 --> 01:20:23,020
guys just hit it?
Hit it just right.

1522
01:20:23,050 --> 01:20:25,630
He hit that thing just
right where he didn't die,

1523
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:30,380
but he could easily fucking got shit flown
through the fucking air and landed on

1524
01:20:30,381 --> 01:20:34,970
his neck. Yeah. Motorcycles
are awesome, but fuck that.

1525
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,810
Not Worth it. No, no. Protective

1526
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:43,640
Outer Shell. It's so much fun. Well,
they're coming out with um, different, uh,

1527
01:20:43,690 --> 01:20:48,190
jackets and clothes that it's
made out of a particular impact.

1528
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:52,330
Fiber that was,
tightens up and hardens on impact.

1529
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:57,600
So you actually can fly through the air
or land on the fucking concrete and your

1530
01:20:57,611 --> 01:21:02,230
body like is protected from the
impact by this stuff. Hardening. Wow.

1531
01:21:02,250 --> 01:21:05,980
Like on impact. Yeah. I don't quite
understand it. I don't know how it works,

1532
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:08,560
but you know, it's like how
the fuck does an airbag work?

1533
01:21:08,561 --> 01:21:11,860
I don't understand that either. I
mean it just, the impact senses.

1534
01:21:11,861 --> 01:21:14,920
They send something and it blows up this
fucking bag in your face to save you.

1535
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:15,311
Well,

1536
01:21:15,311 --> 01:21:20,311
I think this is far more complex in that
the actual fabric itself has like that

1537
01:21:20,531 --> 01:21:21,820
property built into it.

1538
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:26,440
Yeah, no, the airbag saving.
You remember years ago,

1539
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:29,830
my mother was driving in the
snow 20 miles an hour real slow,

1540
01:21:29,831 --> 01:21:33,160
the car skid and she very lightly
taps a telephone pole. Boom.

1541
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:38,230
Airbag deploys, breaks or nose.
Wow. That's a big problem.

1542
01:21:38,650 --> 01:21:42,460
And it kills kids in the front seat.
That's why you can't really, let's see.

1543
01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:46,750
It's a, it's a, it's a pro and a
con for some people, but whatever,

1544
01:21:46,751 --> 01:21:47,620
for saves a life,

1545
01:21:47,621 --> 01:21:50,550
I'll take a fucking broken those and
going through and I'm sure it's, oh,

1546
01:21:50,551 --> 01:21:54,490
it's a tons of lives. Well, if you've done
any training at all, your Ferdie broken,

1547
01:21:54,491 --> 01:21:57,400
you know, I was listening to that bad.
It's just stick some things in there,

1548
01:21:57,401 --> 01:22:01,390
open the passage up. The only problem is,
and you got to clean it out. Even then,

1549
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:05,340
it's not that big a deal. This is
dolce. I didn't say any fights lately.

1550
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,850
Yeah, Shit happens when you're the
ref and the living room. That's true.

1551
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:14,120
How do you, do you ever try and talk
fighters into getting deviated Septum?

1552
01:22:14,121 --> 01:22:16,590
Sixt um,
I talk all about

1553
01:22:16,820 --> 01:22:19,280
my fighters into dealing with doctors.
You know,

1554
01:22:19,281 --> 01:22:22,250
I went all my guys to have a doctor
that they can go to and that can help

1555
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,900
coordinate their health and keep on
top of it. So deviated Septum Septum.

1556
01:22:26,901 --> 01:22:28,850
If they're not getting enough oxygen,
we've got to address that.

1557
01:22:28,940 --> 01:22:31,190
There's so many dudes that are
out there doing that. Like mayhem.

1558
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:32,330
Mayhem has no nose.

1559
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,570
His nose is totally useless and
I tried to tell him to fix that.

1560
01:22:35,571 --> 01:22:37,040
Like you hear him talk,
you talked to her.

1561
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:40,820
Maybe do like he's got that sort
of nasally tone to his voice.

1562
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:44,270
It's cause his nose doesn't work.
He has to spray Afrin up there every day.

1563
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:46,730
What does that stuff, was that what it
is? What does that some anti edition,

1564
01:22:46,820 --> 01:22:49,520
it opens up your, what is it
called? Africa? Is that what it is?

1565
01:22:49,850 --> 01:22:52,520
This stuff that opens up your nostril. If
he doesn't do that, he can't breed that.

1566
01:22:52,521 --> 01:22:56,240
It was known. That stuff is really
bad. It's addictive. It's the water.

1567
01:22:56,241 --> 01:22:59,420
The water's better cause I do the
other things so the water's good.

1568
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:02,990
But you should boil that water because
there's been a bunch of cases recently.

1569
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:07,360
If people getting parasites
and their fucking head, Huh?
Yeah. How bad. Real simple.

1570
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,280
Real simple.
The fucking water.

1571
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:13,450
Sometimes it's stuff that gets killed by
your stomach acids and it's no problem

1572
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:17,050
whatsoever for that, but it's not
the same if it goes up your nose.

1573
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:19,030
If he goes up your nose,
it actually becomes,

1574
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,500
there's just people have gotten infected.

1575
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,050
Cheers.
You got fucking pile of water.

1576
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:26,980
Put some Vicks on that motherfucker
with a proud paper and it will open up

1577
01:23:26,981 --> 01:23:30,250
everything. Your eye balls, you would
see through walls with 10 minutes.

1578
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,410
It wasn't a good old fuck.

1579
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:37,470
Yes. Legal infections. By the
way, in Louisiana, especially,

1580
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:42,000
Louisiana Department of Health and
hospitals issued a warning about improper

1581
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:45,720
Neti pot use, which has been
linked to two deadly infections.

1582
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:48,810
51 year old woman from Desoto
parish and a 21 year old,

1583
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:53,580
20 year old man from St Bernard parish
died after using Neti pots containing tap

1584
01:23:53,581 --> 01:23:57,400
water to flush out their sinuses.
Both became infected with sweat.

1585
01:23:57,401 --> 01:24:01,830
This nod glary,
a flowery,

1586
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,640
a parasite known as a brain eating Amoeba.

1587
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:12,110
Jesus fucking Christ brain eating Amoebas
from your tap water that you get from

1588
01:24:13,651 --> 01:24:16,830
fucking porn water up your nose.
Water is poisoned.

1589
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:19,980
Water is filled with poisoned
aliens that want to eat your brain.

1590
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:22,920
Wrap your fucking head around that.
I mean,

1591
01:24:22,921 --> 01:24:25,470
that's essentially what we are dealing
with. You're dealing with a life force.

1592
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:28,440
I mean, this isn't like, oh, you got
some birth control pills and your nose.

1593
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:32,010
Now this is a, this is an actual
parasite. It's a living organism.

1594
01:24:32,290 --> 01:24:36,870
It lives in fucking water that you drink
and you pour it up your nose and eat

1595
01:24:36,890 --> 01:24:38,490
your brains out

1596
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:42,430
though. What the fuck is it? What?
What? What should the next level you do?

1597
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,780
We've got to put a pill in
water at the house in Boyle.

1598
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:48,190
This shit is any good and out here,
I know there's a fucking scale,

1599
01:24:48,210 --> 01:24:52,750
a fucking scam. You got to boil this.
If you go to Arizona, tastes like dirt.

1600
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,790
They say the best waters in Jersey,
New York Day. Cause they cleaned it.

1601
01:24:55,870 --> 01:25:00,040
I can't fucking see that
a Hudson. Yes. Holy Shit.

1602
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:02,260
There's a lot of tests
linked to this shit man.

1603
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:07,090
There is a lot of desks link to this
and it's all this same brain eating

1604
01:25:07,091 --> 01:25:07,924
parasite.

1605
01:25:08,830 --> 01:25:13,390
Wow. Penn Jillette did the thing
of bullshit where he did the bar,

1606
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:16,750
the water bar in Hollywood,
and he was giving people water,

1607
01:25:16,751 --> 01:25:20,050
like telling them this is Walter from
Europe, the mountains. Meanwhile,

1608
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:21,200
the way there was in the backyard,

1609
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:24,810
I'd fill in the fucking bottles of water
hose and these mother fucking months

1610
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:28,150
are like, oh, it's so Omni.
It was the shift from the uh,

1611
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:29,390
yeah,

1612
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,750
from the back. You fucking hoes at
the restaurant tap water. You know,

1613
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,680
I don't trust Dick when it comes to this

1614
01:25:34,930 --> 01:25:37,780
best. Oh Yo. This stuff
gets into people's fucking,

1615
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:41,510
this is killing people that swim in,
in fresh water.

1616
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:47,030
Where in warm lakes, this is killing
people in Kansas. Jesus Christ,

1617
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:52,220
two kids died because of this brain eating
Amoeba after swimming in a warm lake

1618
01:25:52,221 --> 01:25:57,100
in August. This is apparently
like really common. Huh?

1619
01:25:57,730 --> 01:26:01,840
Oh my God. What the fuck man? It's
don't go swimming in lakes out there.

1620
01:26:01,841 --> 01:26:03,070
People in your house.
Yeah.

1621
01:26:03,270 --> 01:26:07,000
Not Go swimming in lakes and stay away
from trees cause that Japanese beetle and

1622
01:26:07,001 --> 01:26:10,810
getting you fucking asshole
and biotic side out. Shit.

1623
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:16,060
This is amending jaw foul

[inaudible] [inaudible] be ubic a m o e B.
I see.

1625
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:24,913
How do you say that?

1626
01:26:26,750 --> 01:26:29,960
Amoebic Amoebic Ma,

1627

m e I n men Joe in Cephalitis
men join cephalitis.

1628
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:39,590
You know it's really no need to make
the brain eating parasite and give it

1629
01:26:39,591 --> 01:26:43,040
another fucking complicated name.
Why did they have late stage names?

1630
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,920
You know they have like the
name that you call them.

1631
01:26:45,921 --> 01:26:48,510
Like you know this is
notorious B I g brain,

1632
01:26:48,511 --> 01:26:52,940
any parasite and then they have this
fucking crazy Latin bullshit that nobody

1633
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:57,350
can say. It's like you are you talking
English to an English speaking person?

1634
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:01,520
You Fuck?
What is this 70,000 fucking letter word?

1635
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:05,890
The IRS creates those words, I
think. Yeah. What is dope? Yeah.

1636
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:10,850
Lorazepam. Valium was a pan. Whatever
they have stage names stays names.

1637
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:12,410
Just give me the fucking thing.

1638
01:27:13,210 --> 01:27:16,520
They think this parasite is man
created as it naturally occurs,

1639
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:17,960
naturally occurring.
It's like,

1640
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:20,660
you know what people don't understand
is when you see a lake, okay,

1641
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:24,740
that is not just water
and fish. Okay? There's,

1642
01:27:24,741 --> 01:27:28,430
that's a a an ecosystem.
There's algae, there's,

1643
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:30,770
there's plants that are growing in there.
There's all sorts of,

1644
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:33,530
there's fish shit that something
has to eat that fish shit.

1645
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:36,590
There's a lot of things going on
there. There's parasites. You know,

1646
01:27:36,620 --> 01:27:39,740
that's one of the reasons why it's
not safe to eat fresh water Sushi.

1647
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:43,520
You have to be really careful
with freshwater Sushi like
salmon and things along

1648
01:27:43,521 --> 01:27:47,210
those lines. Even fish that are,
that migrate like Salmon, they get,

1649
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,790
they get parasites, man, you,

1650
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:52,370
you should really only eat like salt
water fish like tuna and yellow tail and

1651
01:27:52,371 --> 01:27:55,730
things along those lines. Like a lot of
people, like health advisors tell you,

1652
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:57,980
you know there's certain amount of
people that are going to get worms.

1653
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:01,310
They're going to get parasites
from eating Sushi is what it is.

1654
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:03,860
Especially if you eat fresh water stuff,
you know,

1655
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:05,480
we don't know where the
fuck that's coming from.

1656
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:10,180
These could be coming from those farms
like farm raised fish are sure when you

1657
01:28:10,181 --> 01:28:11,480
have a reason wanting to see those things,

1658
01:28:11,481 --> 01:28:13,580
they're just swimming pools
filled with fish. Shit,

1659
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:17,210
it's fish and fish shit and they're
throwing pellets in there and the fish eat

1660
01:28:17,211 --> 01:28:20,690
the pellets, dies their muscles.
So it is actually orange. Yeah.

1661
01:28:20,700 --> 01:28:25,220
That's the weirdest thing about
domestic domestic trout and salmon.

1662
01:28:25,221 --> 01:28:29,540
They don't even have the same color. Their
bodies. Yeah. Fuck is that man. I mean,

1663
01:28:29,541 --> 01:28:32,590
you know evil when it comes to food
as nutrition guy would've fucked.

1664
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:34,670
Do you trust that?
Trust yourself?

1665
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:39,320
I mean you go to whole foods or am I
getting the best meat available to me when

1666
01:28:39,321 --> 01:28:42,270
I go to Gelson's, am I gay and
I'm just using these two labs?

1667
01:28:42,890 --> 01:28:47,090
Do I go to a butcher back to basics aren't
my whole bucket cow like most people

1668
01:28:47,091 --> 01:28:48,230
are doing out in the Midwest.

1669
01:28:48,410 --> 01:28:51,540
They're raising their old cow and going
over there on the weekends and feed that

1670
01:28:51,541 --> 01:28:54,710
and chopping it up. I mean, why wouldn't
you trust start local? You know,

1671
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:57,440
I was trying to start in your own backyard
on your property and then go to your

1672
01:28:57,441 --> 01:28:58,490
neighbor,
you know,

1673
01:28:58,491 --> 01:29:02,190
start making little circles from your
house and try and get your nutrients

1674
01:29:02,190 --> 01:29:04,950
as, as local as possible. That's
the best way to do it. And the,

1675
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:08,880
eventually you stumble onto the food
chains like a whole foods or trader Joe's

1676
01:29:08,881 --> 01:29:11,250
or whatever else.
And then you have to be very specific.

1677
01:29:11,550 --> 01:29:14,550
Look for local sources
that they get it from.

1678
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:18,060
What do you do when a guy's a Vegan?
That's awesome.

1679
01:29:18,830 --> 01:29:21,350
Do you think that's healthy?
Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely.

1680
01:29:21,370 --> 01:29:24,850
Just have to be careful
about, you know, as, as a,

1681
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:29,730
is it healthy for all hundred
and 20 years of your existence?

1682
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,270
Maybe or maybe not. Is it healthy if
you're, uh, a combat athlete and maybe,

1683
01:29:33,271 --> 01:29:36,450
or maybe not. Is it healthy, you know,
geographically where you're located.

1684
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:39,720
Do you have a full supply of
all the nutrients necessary,

1685
01:29:39,721 --> 01:29:42,810
the plant based nutrients
necessary maybe or maybe not,

1686
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:47,420
but veganism as a philosophy or as
as a goal I think is excellent. Um,

1687
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:52,080
do we need meat proteins? Uh, they
certainly work very well, but you know,

1688
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:56,040
there are other options that should be
considered and I think it's very unique

1689
01:29:56,041 --> 01:29:58,110
to the individual in your moment,
you know,

1690
01:29:58,111 --> 01:30:01,380
on in this space and time maybe
veganism is the right thing.

1691
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:04,710
I like what I call Vegan modified
where we go through cycles.

1692
01:30:04,711 --> 01:30:07,680
I go through cycles. I go like three
days a vegan every three weeks or so,

1693
01:30:07,681 --> 01:30:10,190
or three months, a Vegan, you
know, a year. You know, I,

1694
01:30:10,191 --> 01:30:13,950
I play with little things like that, but
also other ways, you know, hardcore meats,

1695
01:30:13,980 --> 01:30:14,813
you know,
now you know,

1696
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:17,040
I'm getting a little away from red
meats a little bit more lately.

1697
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,220
So I'm kind of dabbling in other areas
more and more plant based things.

1698
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:25,310
Would you like, uh, when you talk
to people about veganism, do you,

1699
01:30:25,430 --> 01:30:29,660
how do you set up like to make sure
that they get all the amino acids,

1700
01:30:29,661 --> 01:30:32,330
all the nutrition,
all the things just based on plants?

1701
01:30:32,331 --> 01:30:33,710
Like you have to be careful,
right?

1702
01:30:33,711 --> 01:30:36,920
Like it's not this like people to
understand like you can get protein from

1703
01:30:36,921 --> 01:30:39,320
certain things, but it's not
going to be a complete protein.

1704
01:30:39,321 --> 01:30:42,140
There's certain aspects of it that you're
not going to get that you would get

1705
01:30:42,141 --> 01:30:44,930
from meat. Absolutely. How do
you, uh, how do you monitor that

1706
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:47,960
protein is broken down into amino acids.
So you have to look at me,

1707
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:51,630
the nine essential amino acids. Are you
getting those in, in abundance, you know,

1708
01:30:51,631 --> 01:30:56,070
based upon your need, you know, what's
your, uh, your, your requirement.

1709
01:30:56,071 --> 01:30:58,110
How often are your
muscles rebuilding itself?

1710
01:30:58,111 --> 01:31:01,140
Let's say we'll talk about athletes, you
know, they have a demand on their body.

1711
01:31:01,141 --> 01:31:03,450
They break their, their muscles
down and they need protein in meat,

1712
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,460
amino acids to rebuild that,
you know,

1713
01:31:05,461 --> 01:31:08,100
get it back to the baseline
and then improve from there.

1714
01:31:08,610 --> 01:31:12,230
Doing that as a Vegan is very difficult,
especially here in the United States.

1715
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,020
North America,

1716
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:17,580
it's very hard just because there aren't
quality vegan products available that

1717
01:31:17,581 --> 01:31:18,930
aren't genetically modified.

1718
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:21,810
I think genetically modified
products do worse for you.

1719
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:26,040
I do believe that you were worse for
you because we can't determine it can't

1720
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:28,650
predict the outcome. We don't know
what the future result is gonna be.

1721
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,770
I don't know what the long term uses.

1722
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:33,500
And I think there's immediate distortion
to the way the body absorbs the

1723
01:31:33,501 --> 01:31:38,300
nutrients and by the word genetically
modified kind of explaining to people what

1724
01:31:38,330 --> 01:31:42,590
most people don't understand is that
there are certain plants that are

1725
01:31:42,591 --> 01:31:47,300
genetically modified for various
reasons and some of them are to uh,

1726
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:48,920
avoid parasites.

1727
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:53,540
Some of them are to not get killed by
pesticides so they can spray pesticides

1728
01:31:53,541 --> 01:31:56,500
over everything. I mean, tell some of
the, some of the other reasons why they,

1729
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,120
it's profit is why they're
genetically modified.

1730
01:31:59,140 --> 01:32:03,510
The genetically modified so the plants
can grow bigger and stronger and faster.

1731
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:08,610
It's pes is what genetically modified a
GMO Jim performance enhancing drugs for

1732
01:32:09,491 --> 01:32:12,580
plants. Exactly. That's exactly what it
is. And there was a toxic effect to it.

1733
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:13,091
You know,

1734
01:32:13,091 --> 01:32:16,570
I don't believe any man can step in and
can alter what was naturally occurring

1735
01:32:16,571 --> 01:32:20,380
on the planet with a positive
outcome. You know? Uh,

1736
01:32:20,410 --> 01:32:23,560
I just don't think we have the ability,
I think we're fooling ourselves and the,

1737
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:25,540
the scientists of the people
involved are fooling yourself.

1738
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:28,630
What sort of general feeling to it?
Like they haven't,

1739
01:32:28,690 --> 01:32:33,010
they haven't done all the due diligence
as far as the longterm benefits.

1740
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:37,060
And it seems like we, it's, it's
food. We're saying it's food.

1741
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:40,120
It is food and everybody knows that food
is okay. It's not poison. So run with,

1742
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,780
it looks like food tastes looks like a
photo of food more than it looks like

1743
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:47,410
food. And that's the problem. Well, when
Monsanto gets involved, first of all,

1744
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:50,500
they have patents on
essentially a patent's on life.

1745
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:54,400
That alone is very strange.
I mean, what if, you know,

1746
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:57,580
the idea is like stage to
do this for certain drugs.

1747
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:01,270
Like that's how bath salts have become
legal is what they essentially did was

1748
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:05,560
took something that's illegal and modify
it very slightly and then it becomes

1749
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:09,580
legal, the ad one molecule to it and
then it's not the same thing legally,

1750
01:33:09,730 --> 01:33:13,810
so then it's okay. Well when
you, you do that with, with life,

1751
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:15,760
like you're owning all the corn.

1752
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:19,660
Like that idea is insane that they can
take corn and then they add a little

1753
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:20,500
thing to the corn.

1754
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:25,420
Now they own all that corn
because they created the fuck.

1755
01:33:25,421 --> 01:33:28,750
You create it. That's like going
up to a Porsche and you know,

1756
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:32,350
and painting stripes on it and saying,
well I created this Porsche,

1757
01:33:32,351 --> 01:33:36,550
now I get the patent on this Porsche.
It's like it's complete total.

1758
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:39,100
That's a terrible analogy.
I know I tried to say,

1759
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:42,670
and you're pushing at the top of my head,
but the idea that they tried to,

1760
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,490
they tried to patent pigs,

1761
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:49,300
they tried to patent literally patent
pig parts because they're genetically

1762
01:33:49,301 --> 01:33:52,460
modifying pigs. They're trying to
patent a pig. They genetically modify.

1763
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:56,950
Like these are like some really
unscrupulous dangerous ideas like these.

1764
01:33:56,951 --> 01:34:00,790
This is your, you're going to
go own life like what's next?

1765
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:04,510
Are you going to take a person and
modify just one little strand and that

1766
01:34:04,511 --> 01:34:08,860
person's DNA and you made them from a a
Zygote that someone had left behind in a

1767
01:34:08,861 --> 01:34:12,580
fucking frozen lab. When people take
their embryos and they discard them,

1768
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:16,000
are you sure there you're frozen and
bureaus are embryos are discarded?

1769
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:19,300
What if someone comes along and adds
a few fucking molecules to them? Oh,

1770
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:23,560
it's not a, it's not a person
anymore. It's a a human fuck bag.

1771
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:27,040
I just take it around with me. It
doesn't talk. It can't go to work.

1772
01:34:27,100 --> 01:34:29,530
It just listens to me and
I get to fuck it. I mean,

1773
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:33,460
and it grows to full
maturity in 24 months. Let's,

1774
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:37,360
that's not outside the
realm of possibilities. It
sounds ridiculous. I mean,

1775
01:34:37,361 --> 01:34:40,750
it's obviously a joke, but if you
can, if you can patent tomatoes,

1776
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,770
if you can patent,

1777
01:34:41,860 --> 01:34:45,940
if you can own the design to
something that all you did was altar,

1778
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,060
that's crazy.
That's really crazy.

1779
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,880
And these politicians that
have let this take place,

1780
01:34:52,030 --> 01:34:56,410
you mother fuckers are guilty.
You're all guilty,

1781
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:00,740
you're all cops and crooks and you fucked
up the whole world because you started

1782
01:35:00,741 --> 01:35:03,830
a chain of events and that chain
of events due to fucking greed,

1783
01:35:03,890 --> 01:35:06,260
due to special interest
groups, due to lobbyists, dude,

1784
01:35:06,261 --> 01:35:10,430
all those assholes that laced your
fucking pockets and allowed you to allow

1785
01:35:10,431 --> 01:35:15,320
people to do something, you know
is fucking evil and against nature.

1786
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:19,760
You know it is. They're going to
patent pig. Get the fuck out of here.

1787
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:23,840
You crabs, the assholes. Crazy. Greedy.

1788
01:35:23,841 --> 01:35:25,900
Cons have set a chain of events in,

1789
01:35:25,910 --> 01:35:29,240
in place that might take down the
whole human race. Congratulations.

1790
01:35:29,540 --> 01:35:32,270
Because the thing about people,
man, when they start making money,

1791
01:35:32,330 --> 01:35:35,150
when they started making money with
something, whether it's from bombing,

1792
01:35:35,151 --> 01:35:39,920
people are poisoning people or once
you start making money at something,

1793
01:35:40,130 --> 01:35:43,310
it's very hard to change the law.

1794
01:35:43,490 --> 01:35:47,840
Very hard to stop that chain of events
because once they're in the money's

1795
01:35:47,841 --> 01:35:52,610
flowing, people are getting
greased. There's no motivation
whatsoever. Stop that.

1796
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:57,650
And that's money. Big money.
Trillions of dollars worldwide.

1797
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:02,540
More than the whole United States.
Condoms. Yeah. And once I Ryan was,

1798
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,050
and then we usually pay him the
fuck off too. Yeah. This is a dirty,

1799
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,840
the dirty world forever.

1800
01:36:09,950 --> 01:36:14,670
So what administration that they fucking
con what probably Reagan probably start

1801
01:36:14,671 --> 01:36:15,320
off with Reagan.

1802
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:18,940
There's a lot of bad shit started with
the Reagan administration before that way.

1803
01:36:18,941 --> 01:36:23,020
A lot of bad shit started with Reagan.
It's in the pig. That is, that is that,

1804
01:36:23,060 --> 01:36:25,520
that was the first puppet.
That was the first.

1805
01:36:25,670 --> 01:36:30,670
We had a guy who made a living at a fake
in it and he became the main guy that

1806
01:36:31,521 --> 01:36:34,490
we needed to tell the truth.
He was a professional liar.

1807
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:38,960
He's Ronald Reagan was an actor and
the actors, or are professional liars.

1808
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:44,020
He was a really good convincing liar
and that motherfucker was the president.

1809
01:36:44,481 --> 01:36:48,470
And from there it all turned to shit.
And now today it's amazing.

1810
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:52,490
Everybody forgets that.
Let me say a word when it started,

1811
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:53,810
it doesn't say when I started here,

1812
01:36:57,050 --> 01:37:02,050
oh 1901 shizam son fucking
things up for a long time.

1813
01:37:03,140 --> 01:37:07,880
They started in St Louis and that crazy,
these crazy assholes.

1814
01:37:07,970 --> 01:37:10,720
And I bet you know what? I bet they
started off as a legitimate company.

1815
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:12,980
He's trying to improve on
products. Sure. You know,

1816
01:37:13,010 --> 01:37:14,880
they probably would just try
and make better corn. Yup.

1817
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:16,700
Probably trying to make a
better tomato that doesn't,

1818
01:37:16,701 --> 01:37:17,960
it doesn't rot out so quick.

1819
01:37:18,050 --> 01:37:20,600
They probably thought they were good
doing good things and then next thing you

1820
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:25,250
know they're buying up.
Mark's take it over the fucking world.

1821
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:29,980
200,000 Indian farmers have committed
suicide because of them. It's amazing.

1822
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:32,790
Yeah. That's good. I got a
loophole for all of them. Yeah,

1823
01:37:33,130 --> 01:37:34,390
they did to the actual law.

1824
01:37:34,420 --> 01:37:37,180
They got a loophole for all of them
where they would not fucking do it.

1825
01:37:37,630 --> 01:37:41,440
That's what the law is. Beautiful. Because
we got, like you said, genetically,

1826
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:45,520
so I put a put two leaves on top of
the fucking tomato and that's it.

1827
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,330
I could change the fucking tomato.
Tomato has two little fucking leaves.

1828
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:53,030
It doesn't have a step. Did you imagine
that shit? It's really ridiculous.

1829
01:37:53,031 --> 01:37:54,730
It's really ridiculous.
I never knew about that.

1830
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:59,530
It's really ridiculous. It's
ridiculous that you're allowed
to do that. It's, it's,

1831
01:37:59,531 --> 01:38:00,251
it's criminal.

1832
01:38:00,251 --> 01:38:05,080
There's so many laws that are in place
that are just so spectacularly corrupt.

1833
01:38:05,290 --> 01:38:08,500
It's, it's hard to imagine that anybody
takes voting seriously at this point.

1834
01:38:08,950 --> 01:38:12,090
Who does take voting
seriously? Unfortunately, he,
I don't anymore. You know,

1835
01:38:12,270 --> 01:38:16,270
I don't hear any of my peers talking
about it with confidence. Like it matters.

1836
01:38:16,540 --> 01:38:16,750
You know,

1837
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:20,800
people talk about politics and politicians
like they talk about reality TV. Well,

1838
01:38:20,801 --> 01:38:24,320
I think real anymore. All that hope
be changed. Shit. You know? Oh,

1839
01:38:24,321 --> 01:38:27,850
I hope he changing. You know, those were
Sarah Palin said about, about Obama.

1840
01:38:27,851 --> 01:38:29,800
How's that hope be changed
you think working out for you?

1841
01:38:29,840 --> 01:38:32,950
She said it's kind of brutal when
it's coming from a Dingbat like her,

1842
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:35,170
but meanwhile she's fucking right.
He's on it.

1843
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:37,450
This is ain't no ho be you going on.

1844
01:38:37,451 --> 01:38:41,050
We're doing the same God damn
shit economy's still sliding.

1845
01:38:41,051 --> 01:38:43,900
Everybody's talking about, oh,
the job market rebounds back.

1846
01:38:43,990 --> 01:38:46,000
They hired more government people.
That's it.

1847
01:38:46,030 --> 01:38:50,230
How bad is the job market and you guys,
the people you know are out of work.

1848
01:38:50,231 --> 01:38:53,690
Are you hearing about everybody hurting?
And I know the housing market is,

1849
01:38:53,691 --> 01:38:56,440
is garbage because I know
many people lost their home.

1850
01:38:56,590 --> 01:39:01,420
A lot of people in Vegas for UFC and
compare that that's cause I live in Vegas

1851
01:39:01,421 --> 01:39:04,810
cause all, as I say, I go to Cleveland.

1852
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:08,650
When I go to Columbus, I gauge, you
look around, you know, we're here in la,

1853
01:39:08,651 --> 01:39:12,460
we're in the comedy business, the
movie business. We see ms Sadie's.

1854
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:16,890
But that's just a short amount. You
know, that's why after the Sag merged,

1855
01:39:16,900 --> 01:39:20,620
I mean even shits hurt and fucking here.
But uh,

1856
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:23,330
you know,
what's amazing when you look at it,

1857
01:39:23,331 --> 01:39:26,560
the election and after you
lived through the election,

1858
01:39:26,830 --> 01:39:29,820
like once you live through,
what's the guy, uh,

1859
01:39:29,970 --> 01:39:32,530
the guy that came on the chicks dress,
Clinton,

1860
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:34,840
once you live through his election,

1861
01:39:35,050 --> 01:39:38,860
you really learned what the election
was all about and you learned that.

1862
01:39:38,861 --> 01:39:42,250
It's like when people look at a
sporting event, they want to gamble.

1863
01:39:42,251 --> 01:39:45,040
They look at the point spread.
That's the least of your fucking worries.

1864
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:47,200
There's so many circumstances around that.

1865
01:39:47,201 --> 01:39:51,100
And when you look at an election to see
how somebody won, you know when Clinton,

1866
01:39:51,101 --> 01:39:54,400
they just involve them TV. Yeah,
that's it. You've seen them.

1867
01:39:54,401 --> 01:39:58,210
They involve the generation that didn't
think they had a vote and they just

1868
01:39:58,211 --> 01:40:02,050
involved it and you see the little
scams. It's a, they sell the sizzle,

1869
01:40:02,051 --> 01:40:06,040
not the steak, and that's it. And if
you keep buying into the fucking sizzle,

1870
01:40:06,490 --> 01:40:10,200
eventually one day, one day, you know,
it doesn't take long after two elections.

1871
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,820
When you're 30 and you've seen
two or three elections to go,

1872
01:40:12,821 --> 01:40:16,990
nothing is changed by the time you're
30 you should see this and nothing's

1873
01:40:16,991 --> 01:40:17,531
really changed.

1874
01:40:17,531 --> 01:40:20,830
I'm going to go down there and drive all
people to vote or whatever the fuck it

1875
01:40:20,831 --> 01:40:23,770
is. I'm still registered in my
hometown in North Bergen, New Jersey.

1876
01:40:23,970 --> 01:40:28,480
I've had 19 fucking felonies and I
still vote there and an absentee ballot

1877
01:40:28,481 --> 01:40:30,940
because they don't give a fuck.
You got to kill somebody in Jersey.

1878
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:34,540
They stopped voting, leaving, then you
vote to you, your spirit's fucking vote.

1879
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:35,370
Absolutely.

1880
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:40,170
Okay. Ready for this? Monsanto
made Agent Orange. Yeah. Yeah.

1881
01:40:40,290 --> 01:40:43,350
Isn't that. That's what's in the round.
That which is what's in the corn.

1882
01:40:43,950 --> 01:40:48,950
I they sprayed on crops of Vietnam
and all these fucking people,

1883
01:40:49,531 --> 01:40:53,240
including John, our driver in
Atlanta. Remember that guy? Yeah.

1884
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,130
That guy was awesome.

1885
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:58,870
Our driver in Atlanta, he was, he's sick
from Agent Orange. From Vietnam. Wow.

1886
01:40:59,890 --> 01:41:03,310
Yeah. Agent Orange. Oh. And
Ddt as well. That's cute.

1887
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,880
They made DDT. Wow. What a crazy company.

1888
01:41:09,010 --> 01:41:13,840
That's ridiculous. They made me
began manufacturing DDT in 1944.

1889
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:15,190
Oh my God.

1890
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:19,420
The incesticide insecticide was a much
welcomed in the fight against malaria

1891
01:41:19,421 --> 01:41:23,500
transmitting mosquitoes. Hmm. And
then I guess it's not good, right.

1892
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:27,970
Maybe develop for a good purpose
and bastardize into profit. Well,

1893
01:41:27,971 --> 01:41:30,580
it's really good for killing
mosquitoes and mosquitoes are cunts.

1894
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,140
It is a fucking crazy cycle, man.
There's a war going on people,

1895
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:37,930
all the vegans that are all,
uh,

1896
01:41:37,931 --> 01:41:40,240
you know that love animals
more than you love people.

1897
01:41:40,270 --> 01:41:43,240
That's where I draw the line. That's where
I think you people are fucking crazy.

1898
01:41:43,241 --> 01:41:46,750
If there's a team you should be on,
it's teen people 100%.

1899
01:41:46,900 --> 01:41:50,140
I don't think he should be on team
buffalo or team Chicago or anything silly

1900
01:41:50,141 --> 01:41:51,640
like that,
but as a race,

1901
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:55,570
who the fuck can you relate to if you
can't relate to human beings and people

1902
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:59,020
that are like, there was a mountain lion
and got shot in Santa Monica last week.

1903
01:41:59,290 --> 01:42:02,290
People protest. Oh my God, they went
crazy. Yeah. Why did you shoot it?

1904
01:42:02,380 --> 01:42:04,480
The woman was like on Facebook,
this lady was like,

1905
01:42:04,510 --> 01:42:07,000
I would gladly take a
bullet for a mountain lion.

1906
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:12,340
You understand the emotion, right?
The love she has maybe for nature,

1907
01:42:12,341 --> 01:42:17,140
for life in itself, but the lack of love
she has in life with humans. With humans.

1908
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:20,670
Yeah. I mean humans, your own, you
know, if it was the a family member,

1909
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,990
so she said before person,
she said,

1910
01:42:22,991 --> 01:42:26,500
I would gladly take a bullet for a
mountain lion or a bear before I would a

1911
01:42:26,501 --> 01:42:30,460
person. Hmm. Meanwhile, bears
don't give a fuck about you.

1912
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:34,360
If you got shot right in front of a Bam,
boom, you're fucking headaches bloated.

1913
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:37,480
The bear would walk over, sniff.
You look around, start eating.

1914
01:42:37,481 --> 01:42:40,810
You are eating your end trails. Very
sample. That's what the bear would do.

1915
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:43,570
That sweet mama bear would start
eating your asshole. Call her,

1916
01:42:43,571 --> 01:42:47,530
call her little kids zone of mountain
lions. Don't give a fuck if you get shot,

1917
01:42:47,531 --> 01:42:50,950
you dummy you ridiculous bitch.
And this is a tear bullet.

1918
01:42:50,951 --> 01:42:53,170
Of course it is out here.
It's where people are soft.

1919
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:55,390
It's crazy out here walking
in with restaurants.

1920
01:42:55,391 --> 01:42:57,850
It's like walking into a
reality show set and you know,

1921
01:42:57,851 --> 01:43:00,160
having dinner here last night was
a trip and breakfast this morning.

1922
01:43:00,190 --> 01:43:03,760
And what way do you just walk in and
you see like it's like cast members,

1923
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:06,250
perfect outfits they do
with the scarf around,

1924
01:43:06,580 --> 01:43:08,950
you know what I mean at dinner.

1925
01:43:08,951 --> 01:43:12,120
And he's got the cute little girlfriend
who was all done up looking like he's

1926
01:43:12,121 --> 01:43:16,340
straight off MTV, the hair's perfect. And
he's talking to he acting like he's uh,

1927
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,780
you know,

1928
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:21,780
adjacent silver wannabe smart he is and
how much more he knows and he's 22 years

1929
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:25,370
on the planet then you know her,
cause she's only 21 and a half.

1930
01:43:25,370 --> 01:43:28,110
There's a lot of needy cons
out here. It's, it's nuts.

1931
01:43:28,430 --> 01:43:31,990
Everything with a performance
is, is crazy. It really is crazy.

1932
01:43:31,991 --> 01:43:35,260
Especially the ones that get ready
to look messy. But then this,

1933
01:43:35,261 --> 01:43:38,320
that's where this dude,
this is that they actually take an hour.

1934
01:43:38,321 --> 01:43:40,120
I don't want to look like I did myself.

1935
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:43,990
I want to look like I walked out of a
fucking bomb shed. Let me walk out there.

1936
01:43:43,991 --> 01:43:48,970
They get the hair and they, they actually
moose it. So it, it is so fucking crazy.

1937
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:53,630
It's nuts. It's fucking crazy. Thank
you for fucking those. Oh, Jesus. Yeah.

1938
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:56,090
It's cool though. It's, you know,
it's like walking through the Matrix.

1939
01:43:56,240 --> 01:43:58,390
It is strange. Yeah. Uh, I, you know,

1940
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:02,220
I try not to spend too much time in
Hollywood itself, but if you do you,

1941
01:44:02,221 --> 01:44:06,560
you sometimes be surprised at how blatant
it is. I was like, Jesus, is this real,

1942
01:44:06,561 --> 01:44:09,160
this seems like it's so
stereotypical, like, so stereotyped.

1943
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:12,320
How did you guys not see
how goofy look Truman show?

1944
01:44:12,321 --> 01:44:13,970
It's like a big set and you know,

1945
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:18,140
well I think reality shows have really
changed the culture significantly and

1946
01:44:18,141 --> 01:44:20,720
most of us don't understand
it or see it because you know,

1947
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:24,230
we're out there in the world of standup
comedy in the world of MMA to very,

1948
01:44:24,231 --> 01:44:27,980
very real world.
But in here in California,

1949
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:31,940
the reality is you can get
famous for fucking nothing.

1950
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:33,830
And if you do have a good concept,

1951
01:44:33,831 --> 01:44:37,910
it's like I saw one where there was a
guy who has a bunch of pretty girls who

1952
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:40,220
cut hair for him and
he has a reality show.

1953
01:44:40,430 --> 01:44:43,370
It's a fucking haircut place and they'll
wear bikinis and they cut hair and it's

1954
01:44:43,371 --> 01:44:46,940
on a HD net. I was like, Jesus Christ,
you just swinging at everything.

1955
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:51,560
There's enough out there that all someone
has to do is be like semi outrageous.

1956
01:44:51,710 --> 01:44:54,620
And next thing you know there there
are professional personality, you know,

1957
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:58,550
and maybe they don't, you know that
that attention desires unhealthy.

1958
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:02,030
Like maybe it's like Judy Browning, you
know, like where it's coming from place.

1959
01:45:02,031 --> 01:45:05,090
It's probably not that healthy.
The re the ways lashing out like that.

1960
01:45:05,091 --> 01:45:08,900
It's absolutely a place of a lack of
discipline or a place of a lack of,

1961
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,410
of love early on in his life or
whatever the fuck it is. And currently,

1962
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:15,440
most likely. Yeah, currently.
Most likely. Yeah. I mean,

1963
01:45:15,441 --> 01:45:17,990
the last thing you want to do,
what to do like that is, you know,

1964
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:20,810
put a fucking camera in his
face and take them dragon.

1965
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:25,000
I've got to give him a hug. Go
drink some common meal tea. I mean,

1966
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:29,210
how many guys went fucking absolutely
apeshit bananas that were on the ultimate

1967
01:45:29,211 --> 01:45:30,590
fighter a lot,
man.

1968
01:45:30,710 --> 01:45:34,490
Mikey Burnett maybe ran into the fucking
wall head first and broke his neck.

1969
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:36,670
Fucked his neck up, man. Mike,

1970
01:45:36,671 --> 01:45:40,910
you put a helmet on and
ran head first into a wall.

1971
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:46,540
Like you can't. Yeah, you can't do that.
Lock 16 dudes up in a house for six weeks.

1972
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:49,790
Make some blame each other. Yeah. Made
them up full of booths. Incredible.

1973
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:51,560
It's the craziest idea for a show ever.

1974
01:45:51,561 --> 01:45:55,360
The ultimate fighter is a genius fucking
program. Great TV. You know, like the,

1975
01:45:55,361 --> 01:45:59,400
the reason why Forrest and Stephan Bonner
went at each other so hard. They did.

1976
01:45:59,401 --> 01:46:02,120
Just some mother fuckers had been
standing each other down for weeks,

1977
01:46:02,540 --> 01:46:05,900
for weeks and weeks and weeks
training and staring each other down.

1978
01:46:06,290 --> 01:46:08,930
No one that they were gonna eventually
throw knuckles at each other.

1979
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:12,260
So two pit bulls in the cage,
right? Is it the finals finals,

1980
01:46:12,261 --> 01:46:15,740
the ultimate fighter this weekend.
I'm not even going. No, I'm not going.

1981
01:46:15,741 --> 01:46:18,050
I'm doing Canada.
I don't do the FX ones anymore.

1982
01:46:18,050 --> 01:46:19,610
I don't do the fuel or the FX wants,

1983
01:46:19,611 --> 01:46:21,920
but I miss doing the finals
of the ultimate fighter.

1984
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:25,460
It's fun indoctrinating these guys
and like seeing them, you know,

1985
01:46:25,461 --> 01:46:29,110
get their trophy and the fucking seen
how happy the art. That's a real journey,

1986
01:46:29,111 --> 01:46:33,140
man. To go in that house for all
those weeks and now it's 13 weeks.

1987
01:46:33,141 --> 01:46:36,700
Now it's even longer. It's nuts. It's,
these guys are locked away in time.

1988
01:46:37,520 --> 01:46:39,650
A long time.
A lot of them have families.

1989
01:46:39,651 --> 01:46:41,570
A lot of them have children
that they can't see.

1990
01:46:41,571 --> 01:46:45,110
That's three God damn months plus.
Yeah, that's crazy. You know,

1991
01:46:45,111 --> 01:46:49,100
you think it's hard going on the road
for a couple of no. Nothing. Nothing.

1992
01:46:50,390 --> 01:46:54,980
No book, no bell. Fireable no
Bible. No, they used to have,

1993
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:58,620
they used to be able to read bibles.
Right. Is that true? Cut Up season.

1994
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:02,700
They as a prop let me have one on
fight day and that's the only piece of

1995
01:47:02,701 --> 01:47:05,640
literature that was allowed on that
day. And I think cause ramp, you know,

1996
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:09,120
worked it in some bed.
If you want to do something wacky though,

1997
01:47:09,121 --> 01:47:13,570
like the read Satan's Bible,
you know, read some fucking
six six, six sheets. Yeah.

1998
01:47:14,330 --> 01:47:16,140
Yeah.
You want it to get crazy.

1999
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:20,460
You fucking wore eyeliner when you
fought and shit. That's the new gimmick.

2000
01:47:20,490 --> 01:47:23,490
Isn't it funny that you can legally
smoke a couple of cigarettes right before

2001
01:47:23,491 --> 01:47:27,990
you fought and nobody would stop ya? Yup.
So stupid and EPO is not illegal. Is it?

2002
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:33,190
Is it, is it illegal? I don't, so I don't
think they screen for EPO. What's EPO?

2003
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:34,230
Epo is a,

2004
01:47:34,231 --> 01:47:38,280
it's a performance performance enhancing
drug that cyclists are very fond of

2005
01:47:38,281 --> 01:47:41,760
because it increases the amount
of red blood cells in your body.

2006
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:46,670
It basically mimics the effects.
Yeah.

2007
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:51,930
There. I think that might have, yeah,
that only has the caffeine of a,

2008
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:55,930
of a cup of coffee.
Five hour energy is predominantly B12.

2009
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,450
One of the reasons why it works so well,

2010
01:47:57,570 --> 01:47:59,880
that's also what's also
in that shroom tech sport.

2011
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:03,780
A shit load of fucking beat 12 and you'll
be like, ha, that's true. I'm tech boy.

2012
01:48:03,790 --> 01:48:07,500
You take four of those pitchers and
then you go work out in an hour,

2013
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,540
an hour later,
go work out God damn man,

2014
01:48:09,670 --> 01:48:13,770
that it's B12 is fucking incredible.
And cordyceps mushrooms,

2015
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:16,500
that's the mushroom that those
people in high altitude take.

2016
01:48:16,710 --> 01:48:19,950
They started noticing their cattle were
eating them and then being more active.

2017
01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:20,760
So uh,

2018
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,970
people eventually start experimenting
with them and taking them and it helps

2019
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:28,971
your body produce more ox or a absorb
more oxygen and you've tried it,

2020
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,570
you've tried it out.
I love it.

2021
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,590
I love a cognitive advantage by using
it or just the field of cognitive

2022
01:48:34,591 --> 01:48:37,140
advantage for sure. For from
this Alpha brain stuff. I'm, I'm,

2023
01:48:37,150 --> 01:48:40,650
I am really fucking a pussy with this
stuff. If I go on the road, I panic.

2024
01:48:40,651 --> 01:48:44,070
If I fuck up and forget this,
when I have them send me some to hotels,

2025
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:46,580
you know I don't, I don't want to be
without this stuff. If I have the,

2026
01:48:46,600 --> 01:48:50,880
if there's like a show I have to do or
if I have to do a podcast or I have to

2027
01:48:50,881 --> 01:48:54,750
write, you know, I want my brain firing.
I don't, I don't, you know? Yeah.

2028
01:48:54,751 --> 01:48:57,660
You can be fine if you eat a
cheeseburger and don't eat healthy. Yeah,

2029
01:48:57,661 --> 01:48:59,760
you can be fine if you
only got three hours sleep,

2030
01:48:59,761 --> 01:49:02,460
I can perform on all those things. I
can do that. I can pull it together,

2031
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:06,080
but we all know what's optimum.
You all know when we feel the best,

2032
01:49:06,090 --> 01:49:07,410
like you were saying,
when you go on the road,

2033
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:12,030
that's a terrible feeling when you have
to fly in and then you have to do radio.

2034
01:49:12,030 --> 01:49:15,210
You're fucking exhausted and you
try to get some sleep that day,

2035
01:49:15,211 --> 01:49:18,030
but you don't really get enough and then
you've got to wake up and go do a show.

2036
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:22,770
No, I'm talking about 10 years ago when
you flew into Houston on Tuesday night,

2037
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:25,960
you went out to eat. You went
back to your room for the morning.

2038
01:49:25,990 --> 01:49:30,060
He used to go two hours radio. Remember
they used to be after the radio? Yeah,

2039
01:49:30,061 --> 01:49:34,440
we used to have so two days you didn't
fucking sleep. You slept it out by,

2040
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:35,790
by the time Friday came,

2041
01:49:36,060 --> 01:49:38,870
you can't fucking think straight and
you got to chose to do. Yeah, the,

2042
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:40,650
well that's the best thing
ever about the podcast.

2043
01:49:40,651 --> 01:49:42,150
So we don't have to do
a morning radio anymore,

2044
01:49:42,180 --> 01:49:43,570
although there are friends of ours though.

2045
01:49:43,580 --> 01:49:46,420
I still like to go on their shows like
opie and Anthony and you know, and,

2046
01:49:46,421 --> 01:49:48,010
and guys along those lines,
I mean there's

2047
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,890
still a lot of shows.
I like to do Dale Dudley in Austin,

2048
01:49:50,891 --> 01:49:55,870
but fucking I need sleep man to sleep.
It's fucking important.

2049
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:56,850
I tell you what,
some,

2050
01:49:57,030 --> 01:50:01,060
sometimes it's even good sometimes
to be a little unconscious.

2051
01:50:01,450 --> 01:50:05,710
I've had my best sets of two hours of
sleep. That drug induced the night before.

2052
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:09,550
I'm talking about two hours because you
had a fly or you come into it with a

2053
01:50:09,551 --> 01:50:12,280
different attitude, right. Do you
really do, when you're unconscious,

2054
01:50:12,281 --> 01:50:15,070
sometimes you don't want to think about
what the fuck you doing, you know,

2055
01:50:15,071 --> 01:50:16,390
40 fucking nine years old.

2056
01:50:16,391 --> 01:50:20,380
I would go to New York with Joe a couple
of weeks ago and we're at a hotel and I

2057
01:50:20,381 --> 01:50:23,680
wanted to smoke and there was
a balcony and it was a cricket.

2058
01:50:23,681 --> 01:50:28,180
He mother fucking balcony and it was
small and I get out there in the first day

2059
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:31,500
smoking two hits and I looked down,
do you know her?

2060
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:36,380
Through the joint away and walked
back in. Oh my God. It was burned by,

2061
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,910
but then the next night I went
out there and I hit it again.

2062
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:44,500
I didn't look down and nothing happened.
I walked in like that and I said,

2063
01:50:44,501 --> 01:50:46,780
you know what? That's like our
lives. When we look at something,

2064
01:50:47,050 --> 01:50:50,110
sometimes it's better not to fucking look.
Just go in there and go, you know what?

2065
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:54,220
Get me this fucking, he'll be on the
pill. There you go. Tubby, cock sucker.

2066
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:58,990
What's up baby question. I got
in, then I got to go. Shoot.

2067
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:01,630
I gotta ask you something because
I don't know what, first off,

2068
01:51:01,660 --> 01:51:05,610
what is the Paleo Diet? Paleo Diet
I think is happening and creation.

2069
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:11,500
Paleo, Paleolithic period. The period
before agriculture. So meat. Yeah,

2070
01:51:11,530 --> 01:51:15,070
meat and vegetables. I'm the things that
grow and you know, and just animals.

2071
01:51:15,250 --> 01:51:16,050
Like today I had,

2072
01:51:16,050 --> 01:51:19,000
I had a protein shake for breakfast
and I had the tuna for lunch.

2073
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,070
What kind of protein? Uh, the one
from fucking way from GNC. Okay.

2074
01:51:23,170 --> 01:51:26,380
Eight ounces of milk to ice cube
bull because it gets me going.

2075
01:51:26,381 --> 01:51:29,030
I can't leave the house without eating.
So I need something.

2076
01:51:29,031 --> 01:51:31,120
My blood sugar goes down, I
get dizzy and shit. Right.

2077
01:51:31,121 --> 01:51:36,040
So then for lunch I had a little
six ounce ribeye that I cuts fit.

2078
01:51:36,041 --> 01:51:40,540
I go to the butcher and I fry it up
with garlic with a little bit of fucking

2079
01:51:40,541 --> 01:51:43,750
spam and that's it. You know, I
like, man, I'm like Joe Rogan.

2080
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,940
I like fucking a good steak.
You know,

2081
01:51:45,941 --> 01:51:49,270
I can't eat a 22 ounce sirloin no more.

2082
01:51:49,271 --> 01:51:53,830
Like when I was 22 in northern New Jersey
at the Berkshire, Diana, but I like it.

2083
01:51:53,831 --> 01:51:56,110
Eight ounce, 10 ounce strip. In your book,

2084
01:51:56,140 --> 01:51:59,800
you always use the Turkey
meat and you particular, well,

2085
01:51:59,830 --> 01:52:03,460
I think right now a lot of
people are too in this country,

2086
01:52:03,461 --> 01:52:06,940
red meat dependent and their source of
red and he's the wrong wrong source.

2087
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:10,000
They'll go to Mcdonald's and that's
red meat to them. That's a burger.

2088
01:52:10,001 --> 01:52:14,410
That's good. You know, um, you know,
go to outback, you know, I mean,

2089
01:52:14,411 --> 01:52:17,030
I don't know the quality per
se, but I'm sure it's, you know,

2090
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:18,910
pretty confident it's
not the highest quality.

2091
01:52:18,911 --> 01:52:23,590
And they'll eat excessive amounts of
that 12 ounce, 16 ounce, constantly.

2092
01:52:23,591 --> 01:52:26,980
Two meals a day, three meals
a day. They'll have bacon,
pork, bacon at breakfast.

2093
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:27,610
The,
the,

2094
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:31,150
the calorie content at the end of the
day is so much higher than some of the

2095
01:52:31,151 --> 01:52:35,170
leaner meats, the poultry that, Turkey
chicken, things like that. So, red meat,

2096
01:52:35,171 --> 01:52:38,680
certainly, if that's part of your
mindset, part of your culture,

2097
01:52:38,681 --> 01:52:41,710
and you don't have any preexisting
medical conditions, right? You didn't,

2098
01:52:41,711 --> 01:52:46,060
you're not barred from eating red meat.
Uh, for whatever reason, um, it, it's,

2099
01:52:46,060 --> 01:52:50,390
it's certainly fine, you know, it's fine
to have in there, but in moderation,

2100
01:52:50,391 --> 01:52:51,800
you know,
I think everything in moderation,

2101
01:52:51,801 --> 01:52:54,470
you should certainly rotate
through the lean protein sources,

2102
01:52:54,471 --> 01:52:55,640
the animal protein sources,

2103
01:52:55,641 --> 01:52:58,880
just like you should through the
plant based sources he had on Joe's

2104
01:52:58,881 --> 01:53:01,910
recommendation. A lot of these
guys, the ostrich Burger,

2105
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:06,190
I took two bites in the fucking
delicious. It's so good. Ostrich Burger

2106
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:12,680
talking about food. Oh, it's fucking
delicious. And I had two bites just to,

2107
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:15,950
you know, like I said, I got
up the pantry shelf shit.

2108
01:53:15,951 --> 01:53:19,210
So I like the extra lean
Turkey meat man witches.

2109
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:22,140
Like I just replace the meat with uh,

2110
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:25,660
extra lean Turkey and just put a little
bit of the half of the packet of the

2111
01:53:25,661 --> 01:53:27,890
seasoning on it and it
tastes just like Manwich,

2112
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:32,390
but it's extra lean Turkey and
dramatically less calories. Right? Yeah.

2113
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:35,430
What do you feel about
supplements? Like, uh,

2114
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:37,630
what kind of things you get your guys on?
You know,

2115
01:53:37,730 --> 01:53:41,480
the first thing we get them on is the
food and make sure they're eating a well

2116
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:45,740
balanced diet of earth grown nutrients.
In a consistent,

2117
01:53:46,060 --> 01:53:49,610
uh, lifestyle. Once that's
been firmly established,

2118
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:52,400
then we can start to determine
what supplements they may need.

2119
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:56,540
Why do we start shotgunning supplements
in place of food and then start to fill

2120
01:53:56,541 --> 01:53:58,750
in the blanks with food. It should
be the other way around, right?

2121
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:01,910
So we get that diet established first and
then we start looking at food or look,

2122
01:54:01,970 --> 01:54:04,180
start looking at supplements.
And honestly,

2123
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:08,000
realistically the supplements are very
small and it's dependent upon the person.

2124
01:54:08,001 --> 01:54:10,760
Of course, some guys prefer supplements,
they have more of that mentality.

2125
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:14,510
But the people that don't aren't already
biased towards supplements typically

2126
01:54:14,511 --> 01:54:18,640
don't want to take supplements and have,
you know, tremendous feedback, you know,

2127
01:54:18,660 --> 01:54:21,530
and you know, medical data that
we get blood work done there,

2128
01:54:21,531 --> 01:54:23,120
you know exactly where they should be.

2129
01:54:23,240 --> 01:54:26,420
So it really doesn't warrant
supplements in most of the cases.

2130
01:54:26,421 --> 01:54:31,110
And that's most of the guys I work with.
Do you go do blood work on the guys? I,

2131
01:54:31,530 --> 01:54:33,530
I suggested I recommended
I'm not a doctor,

2132
01:54:33,531 --> 01:54:36,410
but that's why I almost insist
now with all my athletes,

2133
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,870
they worked directly with a doctor.
They get their blood work polled every,

2134
01:54:38,871 --> 01:54:42,500
you know, four to six weeks. Um, so
we can analyze the data. You know,

2135
01:54:42,501 --> 01:54:44,510
we constantly need to see where
the athletes had. It's like,

2136
01:54:44,630 --> 01:54:46,430
it's like if they're dropping
their hand when they bring it back,

2137
01:54:46,431 --> 01:54:47,270
health is the same way.

2138
01:54:47,271 --> 01:54:50,690
We've got to stay on top of everything
now when you see shit going down like

2139
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:55,370
this Alistair Overeem thing where they're
checking him, not even post fight,

2140
01:54:55,400 --> 01:55:00,330
but during training when they did the
random drug tests on everybody and

2141
01:55:00,331 --> 01:55:02,780
Allister, it turned out that
he had taken some medication.

2142
01:55:02,780 --> 01:55:05,840
The story is that he had taken some
medication and it inadvertently had

2143
01:55:05,841 --> 01:55:08,900
testosterone in and he wasn't aware it was
going to get tested. Yeah. What do you,

2144
01:55:08,901 --> 01:55:11,500
what do you, how do you feel
about these sort of situations?

2145
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:16,040
I think it's a lot of grand standing.
It's politics, it's bureaucracy. You know,

2146
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:19,700
you test the guys at competition,
you know that, that's fine.

2147
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,310
Unless there's some sort of
agreement beforehand, you know,

2148
01:55:22,311 --> 01:55:25,160
like they're talking about Adam and
blood testing, you know, whatever.

2149
01:55:25,161 --> 01:55:28,190
If that's the agreement, that's what the
athletes competing under, that's fine.

2150
01:55:28,370 --> 01:55:31,640
But I think like the, you know, surprise
drug tested the press conference,

2151
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:34,530
you know, they're, they're setting
guys up to to pinch him. Um,

2152
01:55:35,060 --> 01:55:37,140
now should these guys be taking things.
That's,

2153
01:55:37,190 --> 01:55:39,890
it's a whole nother conversation
and without knowing specifics,

2154
01:55:39,891 --> 01:55:43,560
it's not my place to talk about it, but
I think it's really politics, you know,

2155
01:55:43,561 --> 01:55:44,040
probably comes

2156
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:47,250
down to dollars or it comes down to ego
and it comes down to some sort of power

2157
01:55:47,251 --> 01:55:50,190
struggle instead of truly
trying to clean up the sport.

2158
01:55:50,191 --> 01:55:52,290
I don't think that's the
way to clean up the sport.

2159
01:55:52,291 --> 01:55:54,180
I think that's the way to kind of,
you know,

2160
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:58,950
further agendas and I don't
think that agenda's, uh, on,
uh, you know, helpful. Yeah,

2161
01:55:58,951 --> 01:56:02,460
it does get weird when, you
know, becomes an ego battle.

2162
01:56:02,461 --> 01:56:06,680
Like I caught you and you're
doing something you're not
supposed to be doing and

2163
01:56:06,690 --> 01:56:08,250
you know,
it's like what,

2164
01:56:08,290 --> 01:56:11,880
where do you draw the line and what's
legal and what's not legal? I mean,

2165
01:56:11,881 --> 01:56:16,320
who gets to decide what is fair?
Why is creating legal creatine works?

2166
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:21,210
Creatine is, creatine is a real
performance enhancing supplement.

2167
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:24,960
It's legit. It works. Caffeine is you
just like caffeine is in k you? Well,

2168
01:56:24,961 --> 01:56:27,460
caffeine is a tricky one because you can
use a little bit of it. You know, we,

2169
01:56:27,461 --> 01:56:31,230
we covered that. That's a, that's weird
that they let you use a little bit of it,

2170
01:56:31,231 --> 01:56:33,370
you know. Let me ask you
something dog. What are the,

2171
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:37,920
what does the general public pissed about
that the people would steroids while

2172
01:56:37,921 --> 01:56:42,921
they're trading a while they perform
vie Roger Clemens to this motherfucker.

2173
01:56:43,650 --> 01:56:45,440
Why are they mad it Roger Clemens.
Joe,

2174
01:56:45,441 --> 01:56:49,490
because he was pitching doing steroids
before he pitched. No, well, the,

2175
01:56:49,491 --> 01:56:54,240
the argument, what's really pathetic
is the argument is, first of all,

2176
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:58,230
Congress got involved, which is
observed Congress, Congress baseball,

2177
01:56:58,231 --> 01:56:59,220
aggressional hearings.

2178
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:04,050
They had congressional hearings on people
taking chemicals that aren't illegal.

2179
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:09,080
They aren't legal in order to get better
at playing baseball and then a ball

2180
01:57:09,091 --> 01:57:11,940
with a stick. And Congress is
getting involved by the way,

2181
01:57:11,941 --> 01:57:14,130
while two wars going on. Yeah. The, the,

2182
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:19,280
the thing that they come
down on the hardest is his
example that he sets for the

2183
01:57:20,191 --> 01:57:23,970
young kids who look up to him because
he's doing America's favorite pastime.

2184
01:57:24,300 --> 01:57:26,310
And because it's America's
favorite pastime,

2185
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:28,590
there's congressional hearings
on it as opposed to cycling.

2186
01:57:28,860 --> 01:57:33,860
There's way more evidence of widespread
abuse of cyclers than there is of,

2187
01:57:33,931 --> 01:57:38,550
uh, of, of baseball players. Even though
he ends up, it's almost like all cyclists,

2188
01:57:38,551 --> 01:57:40,140
it seems like around something.
Oh,

2189
01:57:40,160 --> 01:57:43,480
did Lance Armstrong get caught or did
he get free? What happened? You know,

2190
01:57:43,481 --> 01:57:48,030
plea bargain, what the
legal term is? I'm not sure,

2191
01:57:48,031 --> 01:57:51,420
but he's had heat coming his way for
a long time as he free yet though.

2192
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:53,940
I don't know, cause I, there
was some article in a magazine,

2193
01:57:53,941 --> 01:57:56,490
it was like the troubles behind him.
Lance Armstrong looks where I'm like,

2194
01:57:56,491 --> 01:57:59,190
what are you talking about? The troubles
behind him, that guy got caught.

2195
01:57:59,370 --> 01:58:03,420
He's caught. And what athlete isn't
looking for competitive advantage? Not Mm.

2196
01:58:03,421 --> 01:58:06,840
And not the combat sports. Not
Football. Not Baseball. Right.

2197
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:09,360
Nascar and tennis.
Golf.

2198
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:12,480
You think that they're not using
cognitive supplements? Drugs.

2199
01:58:12,481 --> 01:58:17,430
Who knows what it is?
Techniques. Um, artificial ways
to, you heard a selegiline.

2200
01:58:17,540 --> 01:58:22,540
So I have not sledge sledging into
some new cycle of mentally performance

2201
01:58:22,921 --> 01:58:25,380
enhancing drug.
Something that lasts like three hours.

2202
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:28,740
It's like some new thing that my doctor
actually told me about it. He says it's,

2203
01:58:28,741 --> 01:58:30,180
it's staggering.
The newest,

2204
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:33,900
the newest best thing lasts for like
three hours and it would just turns you

2205
01:58:33,901 --> 01:58:37,650
into a machine. I don't know man. I
haven't done it yet. I haven't done it,

2206
01:58:37,651 --> 01:58:40,160
but I'm scared to do it because
I'll do that shit all day. Yeah.

2207
01:58:40,470 --> 01:58:43,900
I wonder what like when you
mix it with weed. Hm. You know,

2208
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:50,040
report because you imagine take that
shit and you mix it with weed and ball.

2209
01:58:50,590 --> 01:58:54,730
All of a sudden, you know, you become
like doctor Manhattan for three hours ago.

2210
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,520
We both, I mean, I don't know,

2211
01:58:57,521 --> 01:59:01,840
but I know what it takes to be a champion
and the reason why you would take

2212
01:59:01,841 --> 01:59:06,310
those things as to recuperate anything
after 30 you're and your prime,

2213
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:09,030
whatever I could understand. I mean, if,

2214
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:13,480
if you're testing me at day fight
the fight day, yeah. I'm clean.

2215
01:59:13,930 --> 01:59:18,910
I don't get it right. If
he does, the thing is,

2216
01:59:18,930 --> 01:59:23,140
it's, the enhancement is not just the
enhancement inside. You know, when you,

2217
01:59:23,141 --> 01:59:26,110
when you, when you test clean. Okay. So
if you go to a fight, he tests clean.

2218
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:27,930
It doesn't mean you've been
cleaning your whole camp.

2219
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:31,660
It means you cleaned yourself up the
last few days or whatever the fuck it is

2220
01:59:31,661 --> 01:59:35,320
you took. As long as you're not
taking oil based things you can,

2221
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:38,080
you can take testosterone up until I,
you know,

2222
01:59:38,200 --> 01:59:41,260
a certain amount of time before
the fight and still test normal.

2223
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:44,680
And the problem with that is that you
have been able to train harder than the

2224
01:59:44,681 --> 01:59:48,130
other guy because you have been
unnaturally elevated and your testosterone

2225
01:59:48,131 --> 01:59:52,240
levels. So you've been able to do two
and three workouts a day and that's what,

2226
01:59:52,300 --> 01:59:56,470
there's a bunch of guys that are saying
that one of the issues with training

2227
01:59:56,620 --> 02:00:00,280
with so many guys getting injured is
that a lot of the guys who are getting

2228
02:00:00,281 --> 02:00:01,960
injured are not using,

2229
02:00:02,170 --> 02:00:05,050
and these are the reasons why they're
getting injured is because they're keeping

2230
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:08,530
up with guys who are using and they're
trying to keep the same pace as guys who

2231
02:00:08,531 --> 02:00:12,910
are using and their body
is fucking breaking down
because the shit that they're

2232
02:00:12,911 --> 02:00:17,620
dealing with when you're dealing with a
guy that is training three times a day

2233
02:00:17,860 --> 02:00:22,300
and each session is at least an hour
to two hours long and they're intense

2234
02:00:22,301 --> 02:00:24,940
sessions and they're doing
it for six to eight weeks,

2235
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:28,190
that is a lot of tissue breakdown
and a lot of that tissue,

2236
02:00:28,230 --> 02:00:29,950
it has to be built back up.
You know,

2237
02:00:29,951 --> 02:00:34,750
that's also a problem with this
performance enhancing drug argument about

2238
02:00:34,751 --> 02:00:36,640
testosterone replacement therapy.

2239
02:00:36,850 --> 02:00:41,620
Because if you catch me when I've been
up all night and I haven't gotten any

2240
02:00:41,621 --> 02:00:45,190
sleep and I've been working out two to
three times a day and you go in and get

2241
02:00:45,191 --> 02:00:47,980
your testosterone test, guess what
fuck face, it's going to be really low.

2242
02:00:48,220 --> 02:00:50,590
You know why it's really low
cause your body's broken down.

2243
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:54,040
So if you and and and and then you
supplement the testosterone will,

2244
02:00:54,041 --> 02:00:58,450
that is unnatural and you also have to
realize that some guys are coming into

2245
02:00:58,451 --> 02:00:59,500
camp would,

2246
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:03,850
there's not like one standard level of
fitness that guys are coming into camp

2247
02:01:03,851 --> 02:01:04,270
with.

2248
02:01:04,270 --> 02:01:07,690
Some guys come into camp and these are
like Hershel Walker type dudes that are

2249
02:01:07,691 --> 02:01:11,200
in shape all year round,
never get fat and never get out of shape.

2250
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:12,970
Always disciplined,
always training.

2251
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:18,060
So they have a much thicker base when
they get in their cardiovascular basis

2252
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:21,690
healthier, their, their, their
muscle endurance basis healthier.

2253
02:01:21,700 --> 02:01:23,920
Everything is healthier so they don't,

2254
02:01:23,950 --> 02:01:26,290
they don't have to worry
about overtraining as much.

2255
02:01:26,291 --> 02:01:28,270
They can keep a pace
at the other guy can't.

2256
02:01:28,420 --> 02:01:30,460
But if those other guys try
to keep up with that dude,

2257
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:34,390
that's when that's when
shit goes bad. So, you know,

2258
02:01:35,440 --> 02:01:38,770
I see the argument that you shouldn't be
allowed to be on steroids while you're,

2259
02:01:39,650 --> 02:01:43,670
but you shouldn't be allowed to train
on him either. You can't, he can't,

2260
02:01:43,700 --> 02:01:44,960
like if you're going to make them illegal,

2261
02:01:44,961 --> 02:01:46,610
they gotta be illegal to train with too,

2262
02:01:46,790 --> 02:01:49,610
because otherwise we
have an unrealistic bar.

2263
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:54,470
I'm not saying that performance enhancing
hormonal supplements shouldn't be

2264
02:01:54,471 --> 02:01:56,630
legal,
cause I think they probably should.

2265
02:01:56,750 --> 02:02:01,330
They should just be closely monitored
and you've got to decide how, how,

2266
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:05,030
how you want to regulate this because
eventually we're going to come up with

2267
02:02:05,031 --> 02:02:07,970
things that are better than this and
it's gonna. It's gonna go by the wayside.

2268
02:02:07,971 --> 02:02:12,170
Science is not going to stop
at testosterone replacement
or hormone replacement

2269
02:02:12,171 --> 02:02:16,130
or bio identical identical hormones.
They're going to have genetic engineering.

2270
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:17,270
It's coming.
You're going to,

2271
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:20,810
you're going to be able to
literally manipulate your
DNA. That's unquestionable.

2272
02:02:20,811 --> 02:02:24,260
Whether it's a hundred years from now
or whether it's 50 years from now or 20

2273
02:02:24,261 --> 02:02:26,000
years from now. I don't know
when it's going to take place,

2274
02:02:26,150 --> 02:02:29,210
but there's going to be something that
comes along and make no mistake about it.

2275
02:02:29,211 --> 02:02:32,420
That makes steroids obsolete.
So then the argument is going to be,

2276
02:02:32,421 --> 02:02:35,750
do we just say fuck science?
Do we say fuck progress?

2277
02:02:35,960 --> 02:02:38,690
Do we say that or do we decide
that? Well, you know what,

2278
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:41,910
if you want to compete as an athlete,
you,

2279
02:02:41,950 --> 02:02:44,420
you can't take the stuff that
you're fucking neighbors.

2280
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:48,050
The Postman is taking and the guy can
jump over buildings. You know, your, your,

2281
02:02:48,051 --> 02:02:49,850
your neighbor can fly through
the air like the hulk,

2282
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:53,180
but you can't take that if you want to
compete and kickboxing. Yeah, it gets,

2283
02:02:53,181 --> 02:02:57,590
gets a little squirrely.
Absolutely. Because what
steroids are, is science. I mean,

2284
02:02:57,620 --> 02:02:59,210
they work,
they work.

2285
02:02:59,690 --> 02:03:03,680
You can't look like Lee Haney who can't
look like that without some science.

2286
02:03:03,710 --> 02:03:08,510
And that's a whole nother lifestyle,
let's say then. And Athlete, right?

2287
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:11,480
Sure. Haney and those guys are going
on that side of the, uh, you know,

2288
02:03:11,481 --> 02:03:13,760
sports performance. Yeah.
That's not really an athlete.

2289
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:16,610
It's like a sort of an artist with
your body, right? It's a, it is, it's,

2290
02:03:16,611 --> 02:03:18,740
it's a science project also.
And those guys know it.

2291
02:03:18,860 --> 02:03:22,070
They're trying to do things that have
never been done for full done before.

2292
02:03:22,310 --> 02:03:23,450
They're making new expired.

2293
02:03:23,451 --> 02:03:26,660
They're experimenting on themselves
with all these new chemicals and new

2294
02:03:26,661 --> 02:03:28,390
compounds and you know,
more size.

2295
02:03:28,390 --> 02:03:30,980
You remember that this synthol craze
back in the day when these dudes were

2296
02:03:30,981 --> 02:03:33,590
injecting you oil into
their muscles to shape out,

2297
02:03:33,650 --> 02:03:35,300
it was an oil that would expand,

2298
02:03:35,301 --> 02:03:37,790
blow up their muscle like a balloon
and it would stay and look like that.

2299
02:03:38,900 --> 02:03:42,320
It's crazy. And where that oil
go, it looks gross. I mean,

2300
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:45,020
there were a few guys that actually
did it well, can't say names,

2301
02:03:45,021 --> 02:03:48,860
but are known to have done it. Some of
the most classic, you know, like, uh,

2302
02:03:48,861 --> 02:03:51,920
the artistic type of physique.
Just amazing, amazing things.

2303
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:56,000
Didn't carrot top to that recently?
My, it looks like, I don't know,

2304
02:03:56,270 --> 02:04:00,460
but he's doing it. He did it or
it was photo shopped? No, no, no.

2305
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:01,490
He was always yoked.

2306
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:06,350
But there was like some added
ridiculousness like Brian, look up Google,

2307
02:04:06,351 --> 02:04:09,980
uh, Kara top Synthol, s y n t, h,

2308
02:04:09,981 --> 02:04:13,050
O l and I'm not hating on carrot top,
by the way. I'm never hate on that too.

2309
02:04:13,130 --> 02:04:18,090
I think. I think carrot top seems like
a nice guy, you know, but he, he uh,

2310
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:22,740
he didn't just get swole. He got
fucking juice. It, it's 2000,

2311
02:04:22,741 --> 02:04:24,590
but it's not bad.
It's craziness.

2312
02:04:24,870 --> 02:04:28,460
It looks like it's got the loons in is
I got a fucking three biceps on top of

2313
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:33,290
mine. Biceps. There's something
not fun. Right? I know. It
looks like fake tits, man.

2314
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:38,050
It looks crazy. It's like balloons inside
your body. It doesn't look real all. We

2315
02:04:38,100 --> 02:04:41,700
just watched Tom Platz his lunch
last week, which is awesome.

2316
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:50,700
Oh, I see. I see how it pops
out. Like it's not real.

2317
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:54,690
It's like the implants dog.
Well, I don't think it is though.

2318
02:04:54,780 --> 02:04:58,200
I think you just like this guy.
Click on that guy.

2319
02:04:58,201 --> 02:05:01,260
That guy's a famous guy
for it. That guy, uh,

2320
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:05,680
I was in contact with him on Twitter for
a little while. He's the guy that, uh,

2321
02:05:05,730 --> 02:05:09,120
he was on that HBO show about it.
Yeah.

2322
02:05:10,490 --> 02:05:14,010
Steroids, carrot tops,
steroids. That's like Jesus.

2323
02:05:15,810 --> 02:05:20,520
He's got a good body. It's built sexy
carrot, top carrot looking pretty sexy.

2324
02:05:22,930 --> 02:05:24,630
That will,
that synthol thing though.

2325
02:05:24,631 --> 02:05:29,390
There's a lookup synthol
dance boy synthol dances.

2326
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:33,660
A guy who has a synthol tits and synthol
arms and he's like dancing around and

2327
02:05:33,661 --> 02:05:36,180
it doesn't even look remotely real man.
It bounces up and down.

2328
02:05:36,181 --> 02:05:39,720
Like he's got water balloons and his
arms and tits. It's really strange.

2329
02:05:39,870 --> 02:05:44,160
And he's like dancing. You know, you think
of all the people that take the juice.

2330
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:48,680
Oh, it really, you know, stick
to the thing, you know the die.

2331
02:05:48,950 --> 02:05:52,250
How about the Yahoos of Jersey? I
mean, you worked at Montego Bay.

2332
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:55,930
What about the guys down that as
you're shooting that shit, Bailey,

2333
02:05:56,350 --> 02:06:00,930
that taking the pills with a beer
and a wine, a blower short. I saw it.

2334
02:06:01,010 --> 02:06:05,020
I saw your boy, boy Danny Vega. Oh,

2335
02:06:05,021 --> 02:06:09,670
one time at his house on the phone.
I get what his bitch, fuck you.

2336
02:06:09,671 --> 02:06:10,270
You fuck.

2337
02:06:10,270 --> 02:06:14,380
And he's walking back and forth and all
of a sudden on top of his safe in his

2338
02:06:14,381 --> 02:06:17,740
safe was like money and a
thousand of those little vials.

2339
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:20,500
And he would take him out
and he would cut the coat.

2340
02:06:20,830 --> 02:06:25,470
And while he was doing the
line, his mom would shoot up
in the end. My mom, mom, Ma,

2341
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:28,960
ma, hurry up, I'm on the
phone, I'm hot, I'm cooking.

2342
02:06:29,260 --> 02:06:32,560
And he would fucking just pop him
in the fucking ass. And that's it.

2343
02:06:32,890 --> 02:06:35,110
And I knew for a fact I ran,
you know I was,

2344
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,390
I was in Jersey in the early eighties,

2345
02:06:37,720 --> 02:06:40,480
when beach where I was going to ask
you if you have a shot at my boys,

2346
02:06:40,481 --> 02:06:41,380
but shooting mad shit.

2347
02:06:41,740 --> 02:06:45,430
And I used to drive my bunny to a house
where they were guys and they would

2348
02:06:45,431 --> 02:06:48,450
blast them with the B12, the
deck of the Roblin. You know,

2349
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:52,960
those days it was Deca d
ball, uh, and Novar winstrol.

2350
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:55,420
It was very basic. Five
or six of them. Sure.

2351
02:06:55,600 --> 02:07:00,310
And he would get to be 12 and he would
go, go, go. I suppose they shoot. Yeah,

2352
02:07:00,311 --> 02:07:04,360
you can taste it in your
fucking mouth. Bam, Bam.

2353
02:07:04,720 --> 02:07:09,370
He in mind like panties.
That's where he would taste in his mouth.

2354
02:07:09,371 --> 02:07:14,371
The vitamins pop right up and it was
amazing how all those guys did that even

2355
02:07:15,110 --> 02:07:19,940
die from Phi. He had to deliver
shit. The one, what's number two,

2356
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,610
the hepatitis to tie this to
where you can't drink and shit,

2357
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:24,860
but the rest of those
boys that were shooting,

2358
02:07:24,861 --> 02:07:28,910
they don't die than to have Jesus
from the 80s they didn't know.

2359
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:30,040
Nobody knew back then.

2360
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:33,830
They wouldn't a room going fucking look
at my biceps that bigger than yours.

2361
02:07:35,350 --> 02:07:37,960
Bam fucking and they were sharing needles,

2362
02:07:38,110 --> 02:07:41,120
sharing needles yet that you didn't know
when they need to help nobody fucking,

2363
02:07:41,140 --> 02:07:44,470
well, you know, bodybuilding in
and get just lifting to get big.

2364
02:07:44,471 --> 02:07:47,410
It's so different than doing
it for a skill and for a sport.

2365
02:07:47,710 --> 02:07:51,100
You know what these guys are doing as
MMA athletes is just trying to compete in

2366
02:07:51,101 --> 02:07:55,210
the craziest, most shark infested fucking
ocean there is as far as sports go,

2367
02:07:55,390 --> 02:07:57,310
fighters, professional fighters, you know,

2368
02:07:57,311 --> 02:07:58,930
they're just trying to
get any edge whatsoever.

2369
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:03,520
The most highly conditioned athlete
in the world is the MMA athlete.

2370
02:08:03,660 --> 02:08:07,120
It's amazing what these guys are doing
and how it's still evolving. He'd be,

2371
02:08:07,121 --> 02:08:09,310
evolution is still, I
mean, what GSP, you know,

2372
02:08:09,311 --> 02:08:12,760
he was kind of ahead of the curve for
six years ago now. The average kid,

2373
02:08:12,850 --> 02:08:16,120
teenagers training like GSP
used to not that long ago. Yeah,

2374
02:08:16,121 --> 02:08:20,290
well then there's the Roy and Mcdonald's
is these guys who have trained in MMA

2375
02:08:20,291 --> 02:08:23,910
since they were boys and they don't
have a base in wrestling or bay.

2376
02:08:24,130 --> 02:08:28,750
There are MMA fighters from the jump,
you know, and, and when you're like,

2377
02:08:28,970 --> 02:08:32,710
just fully dedicated and involved like
a guy like Rory is and you're talented

2378
02:08:32,711 --> 02:08:36,640
and you're 21 and you're doing all the
right things and you're disciplined and

2379
02:08:36,641 --> 02:08:38,800
you're focused and you're
keeping your eyes and your Po,

2380
02:08:38,830 --> 02:08:43,390
you could see some incredible results
are possible, rounded by the right team,

2381
02:08:43,391 --> 02:08:47,980
right? You've got for us
and GSI out there, you know,
that kid is a beast man. And,

2382
02:08:47,981 --> 02:08:51,640
uh, you know, and then along once of John
Jones and I went along the lines of, uh,

2383
02:08:51,670 --> 02:08:52,120
you know,

2384
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:55,390
Jake Ellenberger is these guys that are
new guys that are coming up and it just

2385
02:08:55,391 --> 02:08:59,590
fucking destroyers. You know,
that like the 170 pound division,

2386
02:08:59,591 --> 02:09:04,420
think about how many fucking destroyers
are in that division. You know, everybody,

2387
02:09:04,510 --> 02:09:07,990
it's incredible. You know, and then think
of, you know, at the same thing, one 55,

2388
02:09:07,991 --> 02:09:11,210
one 55, it was like, who the fuck
is next? It's like there's know,

2389
02:09:11,380 --> 02:09:13,960
I guess Nate is next in line for the shot,

2390
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:19,060
but there's so many fucking talented
guys between Anthony Pettis and fucking

2391
02:09:19,061 --> 02:09:19,900
Clay Guido.

2392
02:09:19,901 --> 02:09:24,700
And it's like a soup of
awesome fighters and you know,

2393
02:09:24,820 --> 02:09:27,380
and then as Gilbert Melendez,
then Josh Thompson,

2394
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:30,460
I mean those guys fucking went to war
a couple of weeks ago and that was an

2395
02:09:30,461 --> 02:09:31,570
incredible fight.

2396
02:09:32,110 --> 02:09:35,050
Gilbert is right up there with the
best in the world in my opinion.

2397
02:09:35,080 --> 02:09:38,440
I think he's right up there with
anybody and I think Josh has as well.

2398
02:09:38,470 --> 02:09:40,300
Josh look fucking
incredible in that fight.

2399
02:09:40,301 --> 02:09:43,600
So I think that is the one of the number
one problems with a bunch of different

2400
02:09:43,601 --> 02:09:46,630
organizations. I would like to get
them all fucking get them in together.

2401
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:50,470
But it's like when you get like one 55,
it's like man, there's so many fighters.

2402
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:52,630
It's almost impossible to get
them all fight each other.

2403
02:09:52,790 --> 02:09:57,170
The numbers are staggering.
Put on more events, right. Gas.

2404
02:09:57,210 --> 02:09:59,920
How can you pick? We were struggling
now. I mean there's a reason.

2405
02:09:59,921 --> 02:10:02,710
That's why I don't do the FX
or the fuel shows anymore.

2406
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:04,770
It got to be just too
crazy. Sure. You know,

2407
02:10:04,840 --> 02:10:08,050
I do the paper views and the Fox and
then John Annex and Kenny Florian do the

2408
02:10:08,051 --> 02:10:09,770
other ones and then I think,
um,

2409
02:10:09,820 --> 02:10:13,080
Bonner's gonna do more of them and Frank
Mir I think is going to do strike force.

2410
02:10:13,090 --> 02:10:15,640
I've heard Frank Mir is great at it.
Mirrors really good.

2411
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:17,280
It's bright and fucking
guy, man. I'm still,

2412
02:10:17,281 --> 02:10:20,470
I'm doing the WBC stuff years ago when
he did a great job out of the gate.

2413
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:22,130
Did you ever work with him nutrition wise?
No,

2414
02:10:22,150 --> 02:10:25,930
I haven't spoken to him a few times.
Just the socially super cool guy.

2415
02:10:25,931 --> 02:10:30,520
Very intelligent, very smart
guy, knows his body, knows
the sport. No Science. Yeah.

2416
02:10:30,580 --> 02:10:34,220
I think people sleep on how
smart Frank Mir is for he, um,

2417
02:10:34,430 --> 02:10:37,850
he's judged a lot in my opinion,
by his dark days,

2418
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,350
by the days where after the
motorcycle accident. Yeah,
of course. Of course we are.

2419
02:10:42,650 --> 02:10:45,590
Yeah. And he's a perfect example of a guy
who got it back together again. I mean,

2420
02:10:45,591 --> 02:10:49,280
people don't remember when paid it. Pano
beat him when Brennan Vera stopped him.

2421
02:10:49,310 --> 02:10:54,110
I mean that Frank Mir has no resemblance
to Frank Mir of today. He's a killer.

2422
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:54,950
Yeah.

2423
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:59,090
But even he couldn't stop that junior dos
Santos freight train who can right now.

2424
02:10:59,120 --> 02:11:01,820
Well, that's one of the reasons why
I wanted to see Alistair fight a man.

2425
02:11:02,030 --> 02:11:05,570
I think if anybody look,
Allister is, in my opinion,

2426
02:11:05,571 --> 02:11:08,810
the most technical striker in the fucking
heavyweight division period. Sure.

2427
02:11:09,020 --> 02:11:13,130
Alistair's a beast. Man, the way he throws
leg kicks, his technique is perfect.

2428
02:11:13,310 --> 02:11:17,080
He's strong as fuck. He's big,
you know, and that heavyweight,

2429
02:11:17,090 --> 02:11:18,750
he's been massively successful.
You know,

2430
02:11:18,770 --> 02:11:21,860
once he put all that weight on
and you know, he, he changed his,

2431
02:11:21,861 --> 02:11:23,930
his focus and his uh, his, uh,

2432
02:11:23,931 --> 02:11:27,620
his training methods and concentrate a
lot on physical strength and you know,

2433
02:11:27,621 --> 02:11:31,190
the technique has always been there and
it's concentrate a lot on his endurance

2434
02:11:31,191 --> 02:11:34,490
and really worked hard. It's unfortunate
that that fight didn't take place.

2435
02:11:34,491 --> 02:11:36,080
It's unfortunate that if you fall,

2436
02:11:36,081 --> 02:11:38,750
you mean if Allister is telling the
truth and that's exactly what happened.

2437
02:11:38,920 --> 02:11:41,990
A doctor fucked them. You know, a
doctor shot him up with something,

2438
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:45,200
he added some inflammation and some
problems and the doctor gave him some

2439
02:11:45,220 --> 02:11:47,420
anti-inflammatories
mixed with testosterone,

2440
02:11:47,421 --> 02:11:50,300
which you know as well as
anybody will help you heal. Sure.

2441
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:53,750
But you're not supposed to be doing
that, right. I mean, that's the idea,

2442
02:11:53,751 --> 02:11:55,330
but it's not what you're,

2443
02:11:55,331 --> 02:11:58,820
you're not supposed to be taking that
ever if you're a professional fighter.

2444
02:11:58,850 --> 02:12:00,200
Right.
That's the idea behind it.

2445
02:12:00,201 --> 02:12:04,220
It's not like you can take like what
happens if a professional fighter says,

2446
02:12:04,250 --> 02:12:07,070
I'm going to take a year
off to deal with an injury.

2447
02:12:07,100 --> 02:12:10,460
I got a knee and a torn knee
ligament or something like that.

2448
02:12:10,610 --> 02:12:14,060
Do they go and test him then while
he's recovering from his knee surgery?

2449
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:16,300
Should they do?
That's a good question.

2450
02:12:16,500 --> 02:12:18,230
That is a good question
because a lot of doctors,

2451
02:12:18,231 --> 02:12:21,110
that's when they will prescribe
you steroids on a legal bay.

2452
02:12:21,111 --> 02:12:24,980
I know a guy who got an ACL operation
and the doctor prescribed them, Anna Var,

2453
02:12:25,160 --> 02:12:29,060
the doctor said this is a safe substance
to take as long as we only do it for x

2454
02:12:29,061 --> 02:12:30,580
amount of weeks and this
is what we're going to do.

2455
02:12:30,600 --> 02:12:33,920
Here's your program and this is
going to accelerate your growth, uh,

2456
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:38,510
to get you back on track sooner. Or
you know, the doctor said, you elect,

2457
02:12:38,511 --> 02:12:39,470
when it comes to ligaments,

2458
02:12:39,500 --> 02:12:43,370
you really shouldn't ever try to compete
for anything quicker than six months,

2459
02:12:43,430 --> 02:12:46,100
six months for replacing the
ligament is like, that's, that's,

2460
02:12:46,110 --> 02:12:48,980
that's not even being
conservative. That's, that's like,

2461
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:52,640
that's being still a little risky.
Six months is even still a little risky.

2462
02:12:52,790 --> 02:12:57,290
So this guy just said, but this,
this will help you, uh, put,

2463
02:12:57,530 --> 02:12:59,570
uh, your, your muscle back and you know,

2464
02:12:59,571 --> 02:13:02,450
and get you to the point where
everything is strong and it'll, uh,

2465
02:13:02,600 --> 02:13:05,750
it'll heal your need quicker. So that,
that becomes like a real question.

2466
02:13:05,751 --> 02:13:08,420
Like if you're going to say performance
enhancing drugs are illegal,

2467
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:10,430
what about when a guy is
clearly not competing?

2468
02:13:10,431 --> 02:13:13,190
Like what about a guy that's
recovering from a knee surgery?

2469
02:13:13,280 --> 02:13:17,830
What do they do then? W insulin
if you're diabetic, right? Right.

2470
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:21,830
That's a much more antibiotic, more
powerful hormone. And testosterone is,

2471
02:13:21,980 --> 02:13:26,690
is it really insulin? Absolutely. Yeah.
I mean, that's bodybuilders, you know,

2472
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:29,450
they're, they're, they're
hypertrophy, um, style that weights,

2473
02:13:29,451 --> 02:13:31,680
that's what they're looking for.
They're looking to grow and build muscle,

2474
02:13:31,681 --> 02:13:32,100
get bigger,

2475
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:35,120
get stronger, get leaner. UHM,
and in insulin really that,

2476
02:13:35,130 --> 02:13:38,000
that's the catalyst to store a or,

2477
02:13:38,020 --> 02:13:42,330
or for protein synthesis to build muscle
and to burn body fat. He is insulin,

2478
02:13:42,331 --> 02:13:45,540
dangerous to supplements. Literally
Insulin will kill you. Really.

2479
02:13:45,630 --> 02:13:49,710
It will kill you. But it's legal. So
talk about testosterone. Overdose,

2480
02:13:49,711 --> 02:13:51,270
testosterone. Yeah, he may,

2481
02:13:51,271 --> 02:13:54,240
you get some pimples maybe that maybe
there's some longterm effects won't

2482
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:57,170
immediately kill you. Take a little
bit too much insulin. You're dead.

2483
02:13:57,210 --> 02:14:01,560
You're in a coma. Really hairy now.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Is that

2484
02:14:03,370 --> 02:14:07,290
the wife? She was a diabetic.
That's how he killed her.

2485
02:14:07,291 --> 02:14:11,600
He came in and a little shy, a little
too much insulin and you go, wow,

2486
02:14:12,060 --> 02:14:14,610
how much do you take
out? God, I don't know.

2487
02:14:14,611 --> 02:14:18,720
And it would be irresponsible to say you
should be speaking with your doctor and

2488
02:14:18,721 --> 02:14:23,640
have a very specific dose,
you know, cause and insulin,

2489
02:14:23,641 --> 02:14:24,540
something, you know, diabetics,

2490
02:14:24,541 --> 02:14:28,350
some blood sugar issues can certainly
be controlled by diet and lifestyle that

2491
02:14:28,351 --> 02:14:30,690
actually gets you off of insulin,
you know?

2492
02:14:30,690 --> 02:14:34,170
And that's kind of where you should be
going to, how much to take. You know,

2493
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:36,770
there's guys that do some
crazy things they eat.

2494
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:40,680
The more is better philosophy
as far as diet goes.

2495
02:14:40,681 --> 02:14:45,360
Now if you see like a
high glycemic index diet,

2496
02:14:45,390 --> 02:14:48,570
when you, you know, if you ate a
lot of like really sugary things,

2497
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:52,590
doesn't that cause your insulin to
spike and it causes you to like fatigue

2498
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:54,360
quicker?
Well it depends when you take it,

2499
02:14:54,410 --> 02:14:57,090
can you take it directly after a workout
when your glycogen stores are low,

2500
02:14:57,120 --> 02:14:58,960
then you should write and absolutely.
I,

2501
02:14:59,130 --> 02:15:02,460
I drink a protein drink and I eat
a banana right after I work out.

2502
02:15:02,461 --> 02:15:05,720
That's the one thing that I do like and
it made a big difference in how I felt

2503
02:15:05,721 --> 02:15:06,554
for the rest of the night.

2504
02:15:06,780 --> 02:15:10,200
I got to go to Jujitsu and I would wait
until I got home before I would eat.

2505
02:15:10,230 --> 02:15:12,180
Yeah. So it dry, you know,
I'd get in the shower,

2506
02:15:12,181 --> 02:15:13,920
I'd shoot the shit with
the guys at the gym,

2507
02:15:13,950 --> 02:15:15,480
goodnight everybody and then drive home.

2508
02:15:15,481 --> 02:15:17,550
It takes a half an hour almost
to drive home from the gym.

2509
02:15:17,551 --> 02:15:19,890
By the time I got home I was,
it was too late crash.

2510
02:15:20,230 --> 02:15:22,260
I was already crashing and
I didn't want to do shit.

2511
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:24,210
But if I just had a protein drink,

2512
02:15:24,211 --> 02:15:27,360
I would bring it with me and I would
bring coconut water. I don't fill it in,

2513
02:15:27,690 --> 02:15:30,750
fill it, fill the, the protein
drink, you know, after,

2514
02:15:30,751 --> 02:15:32,370
after workout down at right away.

2515
02:15:32,371 --> 02:15:36,810
And it made a huge difference in how
I felt like I felt much, much better,

2516
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:38,700
like physically better
for the rest of the night.

2517
02:15:38,780 --> 02:15:40,500
He went home 30 to 45 minutes later,

2518
02:15:40,501 --> 02:15:43,380
you had a well balanced meal
and you felt awesome afterwards.

2519
02:15:43,650 --> 02:15:46,620
That's exactly what you should be doing
when you spike the insulin right after

2520
02:15:46,621 --> 02:15:49,650
the workout. Even more sugar than
protein, a little bit of protein.

2521
02:15:49,860 --> 02:15:52,750
So you have a protein shake. It should
be more of a, you know, I like a,

2522
02:15:52,751 --> 02:15:55,410
a whole foods fruit
shake, you know, mixed up.

2523
02:15:55,411 --> 02:15:57,000
Kind of like your Kale
shake you do in the morning.

2524
02:15:57,240 --> 02:15:58,610
Maybe a little more sugar in there,

2525
02:15:58,790 --> 02:16:01,140
a little more citrus with more
barriers and more apple would have you,

2526
02:16:01,141 --> 02:16:04,950
pineapple spiked your incident with a
little bit of protein, banana, not enough.

2527
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:07,470
Or should I just have something
instead of bananas? Bananas, good.

2528
02:16:07,471 --> 02:16:09,090
But you actually eat the banana?
Uh,

2529
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:12,540
so it takes a little longer to break down
where you can blend it. Getting your,

2530
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:17,541
so should I pour a little sugar in with
my workout drink or some Guy Gabay.

2531
02:16:17,671 --> 02:16:21,120
So Gavi, Gavi, bat for you. You
know, that's still on the fence.

2532
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:23,210
And they say green teas bad for you.
Some people say,

2533
02:16:23,580 --> 02:16:26,220
everybody says everything's been,
if too much oxygen is bad for you,

2534
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:29,980
you have too much love can be bad for
you. Right? Love is like oxygen. You

2535
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:34,270
get too much. You get too high, not
enough, and you're going to die. Oh, hi.

2536
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:38,900
Do you remember that song?
Fuck yeah. Mostly love is like

2537
02:16:40,590 --> 02:16:44,140
air supply. 10 CC. Ooh, remember
that sense? He's wasn't it? Oh,

2538
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:48,880
I don't remember them. They did. I'm
fine. They love. Oh really? Yeah. Yeah.

2539
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:53,230
I think it's demo. It could be. Who
the fuck is that? Love is like oxygen.

2540
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:58,510
A sweet, sweet Jesus. Wow.
Brian, pull that shit up. Sweet.

2541
02:16:58,870 --> 02:17:03,160
It's from 1978 deck.
Tara's. Yeah, beginning.

2542
02:17:03,510 --> 02:17:05,050
Good fucking jam,
man.

2543
02:17:05,470 --> 02:17:09,520
You always wonder is like these guys
that made this like one or two good jams

2544
02:17:09,521 --> 02:17:11,530
and then it just fucking,
they couldn't keep it together.

2545
02:17:11,560 --> 02:17:16,090
To make sweet love is like oxygen.
It's from 1978

2546
02:17:18,060 --> 02:17:21,930
these motherfuckers. That was a weird
time in the world, man. You know,

2547
02:17:22,140 --> 02:17:26,010
as far as nutrition goes, this is like
the best time ever in human history.

2548
02:17:26,040 --> 02:17:26,873
Would you agree?

2549
02:17:26,910 --> 02:17:30,630
Well or we could reverse it a few hundred
years and maybe that was the best time,

2550
02:17:30,660 --> 02:17:33,690
but I mean as far as like knowledge,
knowledge, it's amazing everywhere.

2551
02:17:33,691 --> 02:17:37,830
I mean knowledge, you know, it's,
it's comes too fast. Technology.

2552
02:17:37,831 --> 02:17:41,890
Your items loudest. Is
this it? Yeah, this is,

2553
02:17:42,540 --> 02:17:45,390
do you remember watching rocky when he
drank the raw eggs and went running?

2554
02:17:45,780 --> 02:17:47,820
How bad is that for you?
It's disgusting.

2555
02:17:48,510 --> 02:17:51,720
We're talking about that bacteria before,
right? Yeah. Loaded full of bacteria,

2556
02:17:51,740 --> 02:17:54,570
but how many times did you drink
that same shake? Yeah, I did it once.

2557
02:17:54,630 --> 02:17:56,970
I did it right. Right after I
saw rocky, I was a little kid.

2558
02:17:56,971 --> 02:17:59,250
I got inspired and this or this.
Give me some volume, Brian.

2559
02:18:20,030 --> 02:18:23,730
Nah, nothing gone. A die. Go. Brian,

2560
02:18:27,560 --> 02:18:28,393
you know,

2561
02:18:28,680 --> 02:18:33,680
that is one of the reasons why music is
so much different than comedy because in

2562
02:18:35,191 --> 02:18:39,300
comedy, if a guy can pull off a
jam, if a guy could pull off a hit,

2563
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:42,320
if a guy gets on stage and he's got a
bit that Nazi your fucking socks off,

2564
02:18:42,530 --> 02:18:44,330
that guy can keep coming
up with bits like that.

2565
02:18:44,331 --> 02:18:47,660
That's how that motherfucker
thinks. But not music, man.

2566
02:18:47,690 --> 02:18:52,690
They can nail one song and then the
rest can be just dog shit because they

2567
02:18:52,761 --> 02:18:57,320
worked all their life talk, travel. They
worked all their life on the first hour,

2568
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:59,420
the second amount as you
leave the door. Dot. Yeah,

2569
02:18:59,421 --> 02:19:02,080
but it's not even the suck at first album.
Like it's a song.

2570
02:19:02,110 --> 02:19:03,710
It's like one or two songs,
man.

2571
02:19:03,711 --> 02:19:07,140
You don't know all the controlling
fucking forces. Oh yeah. The,

2572
02:19:07,150 --> 02:19:09,110
the just the fucking discipline involved.

2573
02:19:09,590 --> 02:19:14,240
I go to watch Eddie perform or Eddie
and practice and it's fucking hard work,

2574
02:19:14,241 --> 02:19:17,960
man. That's it. That's not what
we do, man. Musicians practice.

2575
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:22,670
We fucking smoke weed and
go on the Internet and we
write things down. You know?

2576
02:19:22,671 --> 02:19:25,600
Well, I just learned this about
selegiline. And then you sit down,

2577
02:19:25,610 --> 02:19:28,040
you would a computer and you
make yourself laugh and Giggle,

2578
02:19:28,220 --> 02:19:30,680
and then you write down anything that
comes into your head throughout the day.

2579
02:19:30,680 --> 02:19:34,250
And then our practice is in front
of an audience. So our practices,

2580
02:19:34,340 --> 02:19:36,410
which by the way, tomorrow
night, laugh fact, where am I?

2581
02:19:37,710 --> 02:19:41,630
Are we going tomorrow night we're doing
another desk squad show here at the Ice

2582
02:19:41,630 --> 02:19:44,810
House. It's just like we, what
are we going to call them?

2583
02:19:44,840 --> 02:19:46,280
We're going to just desk want shows.

2584
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:51,590
We need to have a name [inaudible]
death on a Wednesday night. Ice House,

2585
02:19:51,591 --> 02:19:55,550
bitches, Wednesday seven o'clock. Saturday
eight 30. I go up on the stage two.

2586
02:19:55,551 --> 02:19:58,940
I'm doing kidnap and they the Z, the
history of this. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2587
02:19:58,941 --> 02:20:03,260
So make a night, make a night of it, which
can go next door. She, then we have this,

2588
02:20:03,261 --> 02:20:04,740
two rooms were rocking tomorrow night.

2589
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:09,860
Eight 30 show is Joey Diaz
is one man show. And uh,

2590
02:20:10,490 --> 02:20:13,670
I'm going to come watch that too. That's
at eight 30. And then right after that,

2591
02:20:13,671 --> 02:20:18,290
right next door at 10, that is the
uh, ice house show that we're doing.

2592
02:20:18,320 --> 02:20:23,300
And I'm headlining it and it starts at
10 o'clock and we got Joey Diaz is on,

2593
02:20:23,301 --> 02:20:27,500
Ari Shaffir is on. Brian Cowen might be
showing up. Christina Palicki who else?

2594
02:20:27,950 --> 02:20:31,380
Tony Hinchcliffe. Me and maybe John
had Fermin and maybe John had fun.

2595
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:34,730
So these are jamming shows and we
decided Wednesday night is a good night

2596
02:20:34,731 --> 02:20:38,450
because almost everybody's home. You
know, most of us that go on a town,

2597
02:20:38,451 --> 02:20:42,140
like this weekend, I'm at the River Creek
Casino. I think it's sold out. It's,

2598
02:20:42,141 --> 02:20:44,810
I mean, uh, Edmonton
Alberta with the RH fear.

2599
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:48,290
It may be sold out and there was
like 50 tickets left yesterday.

2600
02:20:48,320 --> 02:20:51,650
So if you jump on that shit dirty bitches,
but the ice house,

2601
02:20:51,651 --> 02:20:54,440
we haven't even announced it yet.
We're announcing it right now.

2602
02:20:54,650 --> 02:20:57,380
Icehouse con Oh wait a minute. I already
announced it on Twitter an hour ago.

2603
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:02,150
Okay. It's announced tomorrow night.
The Wednesday night ice house.

2604
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:04,280
So get on that shit.
Don't sleep.

2605
02:21:04,281 --> 02:21:08,090
ICEHOUSE comedy.com you can buy
tickets online and it will sell out.

2606
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:10,700
We sold out last week and the week
before that and all that shit.

2607
02:21:10,701 --> 02:21:13,010
So we're doing them on a regular basis.
So there you go.

2608
02:21:13,011 --> 02:21:16,280
Joe Diaz excited about that.
Yeah, I'm more excited about it.

2609
02:21:16,281 --> 02:21:18,410
I got to talk to them like
they'll chase Joey Diaz.

2610
02:21:18,411 --> 02:21:19,640
Let's make a goal for you brother.

2611
02:21:19,641 --> 02:21:21,530
There's a reason why I
wanted him to confront you.

2612
02:21:21,531 --> 02:21:23,230
Like when you were saying you were

2613
02:21:25,540 --> 02:21:28,460
other fucker. Listen, I love
you. Don't know. No, no. Me.

2614
02:21:28,760 --> 02:21:31,010
When the guy says what are
your goals? And you like, God,

2615
02:21:31,011 --> 02:21:33,580
I just want to eat a little bit,
that's not a goal. Let's get a goal.

2616
02:21:33,581 --> 02:21:37,240
It's what's write down a goal for you.
Like a health goal.

2617
02:21:37,530 --> 02:21:40,250
Look when you eat, is that the
right way to do it? My culture,

2618
02:21:40,380 --> 02:21:43,160
but this is what I'm right with
surrounded by love right now.

2619
02:21:43,230 --> 02:21:47,400
Before you even go there. Okay. Three
years ago I would eat three eggs,

2620
02:21:47,780 --> 02:21:50,010
would have half a loaf of
wonder bread with butter,

2621
02:21:50,340 --> 02:21:54,610
a half a pound of bacon and potatoes.
Today when I eat eggs,

2622
02:21:54,870 --> 02:21:59,400
one egg, one piece of toast and two
pieces of Seneca up bacon and oatmeal.

2623
02:22:00,270 --> 02:22:03,640
So what I managed to do is I try to cut,
you know,

2624
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:07,500
10 years ago I would eat a sandwich with
chips and the side of macaroni salad.

2625
02:22:07,900 --> 02:22:12,490
Now I eat a six inch with no chips and
don't macaroni salad. You follow me?

2626
02:22:12,830 --> 02:22:14,290
Like saying I do a little bit of coke.

2627
02:22:16,320 --> 02:22:20,530
So you get them.
So when I eat the pasta,

2628
02:22:20,560 --> 02:22:22,990
everybody always talks about right,
right there.

2629
02:22:23,230 --> 02:22:26,040
Is that my sprite is that you
can't spray? Yeah. Is that empty?

2630
02:22:27,150 --> 02:22:30,660
What's the ingredients in that
spread? Dick Water. Water, water.

2631
02:22:30,720 --> 02:22:33,220
Let me show you zero. It's
sprayed zero, right? Zero.

2632
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:37,170
But it's got back chemicals for you.
It doesn't have bad chemicals.

2633
02:22:37,171 --> 02:22:39,450
I don't even see where that came with
those. We've got, what are citric acid?

2634
02:22:39,451 --> 02:22:43,840
Potassium citrate, naturality,
potassium benzoate. Um, aspartame.

2635
02:22:44,090 --> 02:22:48,030
A sole salt for mean potassium.
So,

2636
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:52,560
and what do you get out of that? That's
so good. Thick. Yeah. And I mixed it up.

2637
02:22:52,710 --> 02:22:55,620
I got a new fucking rule at the house.
I got that thing from Costco.

2638
02:22:55,630 --> 02:22:58,950
Now for the last two months and I just
drink water one up at the house. Okay.

2639
02:22:59,040 --> 02:23:02,790
When I go out, that's my fucking treat.
God, why have you have we earned a treat?

2640
02:23:02,820 --> 02:23:06,360
Why? Absolutely. Tell me,
because I fucking live better.

2641
02:23:06,630 --> 02:23:09,780
I sleep my eight hours.
I take my fucking vitamins in the morning.

2642
02:23:10,110 --> 02:23:12,430
So you've achieved your goal.
You're where you want to me right now,

2643
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:15,450
this is the endpoint. Not
really, but where's the endpoint?

2644
02:23:15,480 --> 02:23:19,610
The endpoint about to 70 okay, and how
far did we get to go had it gets too big,

2645
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:24,240
but he has to deal with to my end goal
is a lot of things. What are you today?

2646
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:26,760
I've been smoking this shit
lately. Well, let's back up.

2647
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:29,640
What do you weigh right now to daily
eight to nine eight to seven years ago.

2648
02:23:29,641 --> 02:23:32,700
So 28 pounds.
How are we going to get their cut?

2649
02:23:32,701 --> 02:23:35,880
My intake food and what's the timeline?
Let's give ourselves a timeline.

2650
02:23:35,881 --> 02:23:40,440
Right now it's what may 29
six months to lose 20 pounds,

2651
02:23:40,441 --> 02:23:44,130
30 pounds myself. Easily obtainable.
Absolutely. Some five pounds a month,

2652
02:23:44,131 --> 02:23:47,190
five pounds. I could even do like eight
pounds a month if I a month. Alright.

2653
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:51,470
Two pounds a week. That's pretty fucking,
that's why I think we can do that.

2654
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:54,600
Two pounds a week. That's the
goal right now. Alright, great.

2655
02:23:54,601 --> 02:23:57,570
Way To start that is to kick that
out. No, and won't be a little bit,

2656
02:23:57,630 --> 02:24:01,120
that's what I've been trying to do lately
is just when I go out with friends,

2657
02:24:01,140 --> 02:24:02,850
like I said,
I have this insecurity.

2658
02:24:02,851 --> 02:24:05,640
I don't do deck now you want me to
fucking have one of these things?

2659
02:24:05,641 --> 02:24:09,460
I'd rather shoot myself in the fucking
it. No, no, no, no, no. That man,

2660
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:12,630
that's not necessary. Come on, I'll
go to the blog and a glass of water,

2661
02:24:12,631 --> 02:24:15,800
but I can't do that. No, I'm
saying I, I remind with me.

2662
02:24:15,801 --> 02:24:16,680
I don't know what I'm saying.

2663
02:24:17,160 --> 02:24:21,330
I gotta do something to feel like
I'm fucking alive sometimes. Yeah.

2664
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:24,180
The phone follow safety. You're hanging
out with great people. Oh No, no.

2665
02:24:24,181 --> 02:24:27,150
This is a lot. The Sun is
shining. You're breathing.

2666
02:24:27,180 --> 02:24:29,430
It's a beautiful fucking day to be alive.
You know me dog.

2667
02:24:29,431 --> 02:24:32,400
Every time I fucking get up. That's the
first thing I'd do is thank everybody.

2668
02:24:32,401 --> 02:24:35,190
There we go. You gotta be fucking
kidding me. So two pounds a week.

2669
02:24:35,191 --> 02:24:38,640
Now that's fine. Ways to do it. So
we've got to start making changes,

2670
02:24:38,641 --> 02:24:41,910
positive changes. Let me ask you some
questions about the lifting. At my age,

2671
02:24:41,911 --> 02:24:45,350
I like it. I liked going in there twice
a week and throw in some way to run.

2672
02:24:45,360 --> 02:24:49,330
It's not maximum weight. I'm doing
everything. Like you said, 12 to 15 yup.

2673
02:24:49,500 --> 02:24:52,620
I'm doing the bent over rows,
which I really like. One arm poles.

2674
02:24:52,890 --> 02:24:54,540
I do the fucking upright rows.

2675
02:24:54,780 --> 02:24:58,650
I do the bike to warm up every time I
go through a 45 minutes working out.

2676
02:24:58,651 --> 02:25:01,560
It's no problem. You like, oh, I
fucking like it. That's my thing.

2677
02:25:01,561 --> 02:25:05,850
So troubleshooting. If it's not,
it's is the dye apps of fuck it.

2678
02:25:05,850 --> 02:25:09,130
We'll circle back to the deaths of
died. Breakfast out of bed, out of bed.

2679
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:12,480
You have there that one egg will have
water.

2680
02:25:13,190 --> 02:25:17,670
I drink six ounces of water. I drink
a cup of coffee with no sugar. Black.

2681
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:21,270
Perfect. All right. And then I wait
a little while and then I go back in.

2682
02:25:21,271 --> 02:25:25,340
Then either let, depending on my day
have a protein shake from GNC. Okay. Oh,

2683
02:25:25,450 --> 02:25:29,410
I have one egg with a piece of
toast with butter on it and Bacon.

2684
02:25:29,770 --> 02:25:30,970
I don't like fucking milk.

2685
02:25:31,210 --> 02:25:33,790
I don't like almond milk cause I
looked at that thing in your book.

2686
02:25:33,791 --> 02:25:36,190
I don't see that's a problem I
had with the book but not really.

2687
02:25:36,191 --> 02:25:39,640
I even asked Joel Bach, we know
we had out. He was fucking,

2688
02:25:39,940 --> 02:25:44,530
the reason why he's saying it quick
keen was a weird spelling. It's Q. U. I.

2689
02:25:45,060 --> 02:25:47,590
A sesame street. You don't
have to fucking say no, no, no.

2690
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:51,790
A lot of people don't know. People
are asking me and they spell it crazy.

2691
02:25:52,530 --> 02:25:57,060
Keen wide sounds like k. E.
N w or something like that.

2692
02:25:57,210 --> 02:26:01,880
How do you spell it, man? Q. U.
I. N. E. A. S. Yeah, there we go.

2693
02:26:02,260 --> 02:26:04,180
Yeah, it's, it's, it's acute fucks me up.

2694
02:26:04,181 --> 02:26:07,240
I looked in the thesaurus and everything
but I want to have you tried it.

2695
02:26:08,780 --> 02:26:13,690
It looks like he looks like Joseph comes
in bags and sometimes he eats it with a

2696
02:26:13,691 --> 02:26:16,360
steak and he's going to fucking
hate it. So I'll try. I'll try.

2697
02:26:16,400 --> 02:26:19,030
It's what you mix it with.
Don't eat it by itself.

2698
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:20,110
What are you going to make it with?

2699
02:26:20,170 --> 02:26:23,950
I don't know how to look at the fucking
book and see what you got of cheese,

2700
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:28,120
if that's what we gotta do to get you out
saw sauce. What the fuck dog? Perfect.

2701
02:26:28,150 --> 02:26:31,930
You get me some Goddamn fucking hippie
food it tastes like so, wait a second.

2702
02:26:32,080 --> 02:26:35,230
Let's get something straight. Let's get
fucking something straight right here.

2703
02:26:35,480 --> 02:26:37,960
I love this. You know I live, listen,

2704
02:26:37,990 --> 02:26:40,110
I got to do something that
a lot of people didn't do.

2705
02:26:40,130 --> 02:26:42,520
Joe Rogan and watchman is he,
he wasn't there for it.

2706
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:45,100
I grew up in Jersey where there's
great food in New York City.

2707
02:26:45,250 --> 02:26:47,440
I lived in San Francisco.
We go to Texas,

2708
02:26:47,620 --> 02:26:51,580
which is the best fucking restaurants
or the country, Texas. We go to Vegas,

2709
02:26:51,910 --> 02:26:55,060
but the fucking restaurant that always
got my debit card was in boulder.

2710
02:26:55,061 --> 02:26:57,940
Colorado was called the
harvest restaurant on Canyon.

2711
02:26:57,941 --> 02:27:01,360
But I'm Pearl Street and because
they had everything vegetarian,

2712
02:27:01,480 --> 02:27:03,160
you're looking at me going Joey,
I don't see it.

2713
02:27:03,430 --> 02:27:07,480
They had a vegetarian Gazpacho that your
asshole would fucking quake the whole

2714
02:27:07,481 --> 02:27:09,840
way home. I couldn't
wait to taste it. Nice.

2715
02:27:09,910 --> 02:27:14,170
I a Swiss harvest Granola for
breakfast. I ate eggs. I hate eggs.

2716
02:27:14,410 --> 02:27:17,080
But the breakfast bowl you got
is kind of fucked up for me.

2717
02:27:17,410 --> 02:27:20,140
So that's something
that everybody loves it.

2718
02:27:20,380 --> 02:27:23,920
There's something that I don't like egg
whites either. You got to put some money.

2719
02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:25,570
I don't have any,

2720
02:27:25,570 --> 02:27:29,020
there was something in the breakfast and
just the whole buckwheat and that shit

2721
02:27:29,021 --> 02:27:33,910
that the bus, uh, gluten
free. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Joey,

2722
02:27:33,911 --> 02:27:36,310
the reason why I can in front of you
and the reason why I talked about it

2723
02:27:36,311 --> 02:27:39,210
earlier and when I, when I keep
getting onto the point of, you know,

2724
02:27:39,530 --> 02:27:42,640
you having a goal is cause I know
you've done it before. You know,

2725
02:27:42,641 --> 02:27:45,670
I was really proud of you when you quit
smoking and I was really proud of you

2726
02:27:45,671 --> 02:27:47,010
when you lost all that weight in minutes.

2727
02:27:47,410 --> 02:27:51,550
Pretty impressive for a guy who in my
life you've been a real impulsive sort of

2728
02:27:51,551 --> 02:27:56,170
wild dude, you know? I mean,
you've always, when you want to,

2729
02:27:56,171 --> 02:27:58,960
you have control, but
sometimes you, like you say,

2730
02:27:58,961 --> 02:28:02,530
you give yourselves rewards that like
Mike said, you haven't earned. I know,

2731
02:28:02,531 --> 02:28:05,740
and that's that's it's an impulsive thing.
It's part of being a great comic.

2732
02:28:05,741 --> 02:28:07,600
It's that I don't give a fuck attitude.

2733
02:28:07,601 --> 02:28:11,020
I'm going to do whatever the
fuck fucking bed at 7:00 AM.

2734
02:28:11,021 --> 02:28:13,540
I'm walking my fucking wife to
the tray. Right? What were ward,

2735
02:28:13,541 --> 02:28:16,060
aren't you fucking talking
about Robert Water, you people?

2736
02:28:16,150 --> 02:28:20,710
How many people have told you I want
to Holler, willing Noni fucking reward.

2737
02:28:20,890 --> 02:28:22,100
The reward is I work every

2738
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:24,710
fucking day. I had the surgery
and I had to sit at home,

2739
02:28:24,860 --> 02:28:27,470
so at that time I had a fucking,
they told me to go to the fucking gym,

2740
02:28:27,620 --> 02:28:31,010
have bulk up. I got this fucking
Cuban body that when I touch away,

2741
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:32,720
I told you to bulk up,

2742
02:28:33,440 --> 02:28:36,450
do the fucking squat and all
that shit made towards quiet,

2743
02:28:36,470 --> 02:28:39,830
get my metabolism going. I got a
whack off. I've got a bank, the wife,

2744
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:41,180
I go fucking bananas.

2745
02:28:41,330 --> 02:28:44,960
Then I went and got that GNC fucking
protein powder and I added it on there.

2746
02:28:45,110 --> 02:28:48,770
But for fuck, I kept the weight off. I
was at two 80 whatever. I'm feeling good.

2747
02:28:48,771 --> 02:28:50,270
My blood pressure down on my fish,

2748
02:28:50,330 --> 02:28:55,330
the basically yelled and backed us into
a corner because you know back up are

2749
02:28:56,530 --> 02:28:59,140
you fucking talking about there's
no reality count when you're on yet.

2750
02:28:59,180 --> 02:29:03,590
I work out every fucking day. That's what
I'm telling you. Why every fucking day.

2751
02:29:04,480 --> 02:29:09,480
But what he's saying is when you drink
sprite zero though fucking points one

2752
02:29:11,240 --> 02:29:15,440
spot.
Watch things on top of the shit issue.

2753
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:17,680
I'm on the board

2754
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:23,780
versus your book to enhance what I was
doing. Let me, I love wait, watch TV.

2755
02:29:23,790 --> 02:29:27,890
And then I love weight watchers. So
when you use the in the calorie concept,

2756
02:29:27,891 --> 02:29:32,360
the calorie count is wrong because the
donor has a hundred calories in it and a

2757
02:29:32,361 --> 02:29:36,830
chicken breast or six boys who are six
or you use the weight watchers points.

2758
02:29:36,831 --> 02:29:39,200
That doesn't mean you're healthy.
What's your nutrient quality?

2759
02:29:39,350 --> 02:29:41,240
Let's talk about yourselves.
How do your sales look?

2760
02:29:41,241 --> 02:29:44,090
Cause really we're just big blobs of
sales were billions and billions of cells,

2761
02:29:44,240 --> 02:29:47,510
which the health of ourselves, the way you
look, your physical presence right now,

2762
02:29:47,720 --> 02:29:50,870
that you're just a combination of
sales and how healthy are these sales.

2763
02:29:50,870 --> 02:29:53,980
And that's based upon the nutrient
quality of what it's taking.

2764
02:29:53,981 --> 02:29:55,470
And also external sign,
you know,

2765
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:59,600
factors of an environment and then
your relationships, things like that.

2766
02:29:59,690 --> 02:30:01,490
But yourself.
So nutrient quality,

2767
02:30:01,491 --> 02:30:04,610
you're talking about points points mean
nothing because it's just a calorie

2768
02:30:04,611 --> 02:30:07,570
structure, which is wrong. You
burn calories, you know, you know,

2769
02:30:07,580 --> 02:30:11,060
moving around throughout the day, your
calorie expenditure changes dramatically.

2770
02:30:11,330 --> 02:30:13,040
You know, you're sitting in
traffic. Use that example.

2771
02:30:13,041 --> 02:30:14,840
You're sitting in traffic for two hours,
bumper to bumper,

2772
02:30:14,841 --> 02:30:17,660
you're stuck or you cruise home,
he's at two totally different days.

2773
02:30:17,661 --> 02:30:21,050
You have two totally different
nutritional needs. So speaking with you,

2774
02:30:21,110 --> 02:30:24,260
we need to focus on nutrient
density on nutrient.

2775
02:30:24,440 --> 02:30:26,310
And that's not nutrient density.
That's garbage.

2776
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:29,000
That's a bunch of chemicals on it. Yeah,
but that's just, that's no calories.

2777
02:30:29,060 --> 02:30:33,680
That's one step. That's one little button
and got sodium in our retains water.

2778
02:30:33,710 --> 02:30:36,830
Thousands of weather.
But small decisions.

2779
02:30:36,831 --> 02:30:39,950
You can't live like a fucking priest
all the time. So don't equate.

2780
02:30:40,510 --> 02:30:44,390
Equate Soda Not Drinking Soda Free.
What would you rather that we have?

2781
02:30:44,391 --> 02:30:47,540
Get them like diary queen. Get them.
Mike, would you rather me have this?

2782
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:50,510
You know what he's doing? Dairy
Queen. Do you follow him saying no,

2783
02:30:50,511 --> 02:30:51,341
I'd rather have you,

2784
02:30:51,341 --> 02:30:55,010
you have some black coffee if you need
something special but a little coffee guy.

2785
02:30:55,480 --> 02:30:59,210
Have some tea. Make water, make a
tea at home. Make something special.

2786
02:30:59,211 --> 02:31:03,260
Make your own citrus cues, bringing
it with and get it locally. I mean,

2787
02:31:03,261 --> 02:31:06,350
you can walk out this door right
now. I don't like fucking costs. So,

2788
02:31:06,650 --> 02:31:10,820
but you know the, the place Joe into the,
the lovebirds. I'm just cafe and Megan.

2789
02:31:10,840 --> 02:31:12,740
I'm sure they have something
good there. Well, we were here.

2790
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:16,310
I'm not going to fuck a walk around.
We're here now.

2791
02:31:16,340 --> 02:31:18,830
You're not going to work three
minutes to have something healthy.

2792
02:31:18,990 --> 02:31:19,980
You're going to stay where

2793
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:23,930
you are to have something unhealthy.
That is where the spiral begins.

2794
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:27,540
So now you're queuing negative
instead of skewing positive.

2795
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:30,060
I was happy to see you.
I wasn't going to excuse myself.

2796
02:31:31,590 --> 02:31:34,170
I would always here with you.
It's a fucking water.

2797
02:31:34,230 --> 02:31:36,930
I would have walked with
you down there on my back.

2798
02:31:36,931 --> 02:31:41,590
If I have to say to bring you then Joey
and aid where you are, his daughter, me,

2799
02:31:41,591 --> 02:31:45,060
you, he'll start smiling. We
love you. Love me from reality.

2800
02:31:45,061 --> 02:31:49,110
You guys don't understand this hill was
my reality because he don't know if this

2801
02:31:49,111 --> 02:31:51,780
fucking guy, when it comes to
this shit, he doesn't know. Dig.

2802
02:31:51,781 --> 02:31:54,410
My reality was mother fucker.
I know you bought in,

2803
02:31:54,420 --> 02:31:56,520
you know you and I woke up in
the morning after I do coke.

2804
02:31:56,521 --> 02:31:58,980
If I had a piece of Sushi,
that was my workout for the day.

2805
02:31:59,430 --> 02:32:03,210
I thought in the back of my mind that
Sushi would cleanse the cocaine out of my

2806
02:32:03,211 --> 02:32:07,440
life. I actually believe that if you
drank pomegranate juice, wheat grass,

2807
02:32:07,470 --> 02:32:08,830
I could go out and do blow today.

2808
02:32:09,440 --> 02:32:13,110
So this is the guy you're talking to
about this shit. So now I'm telling you,

2809
02:32:13,300 --> 02:32:16,320
you're a new guy. The old guy,
Joe Rogan. What's my rule?

2810
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:18,300
What's my fucking rule about the road?

2811
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:22,620
I don't want to be on a fucking
note show on a Sunday night.

2812
02:32:22,920 --> 02:32:26,400
And there's reasons because on Sundays I
go to the farmer's market every fucking

2813
02:32:26,401 --> 02:32:30,780
week and I buy fruit. I Buy
Bananas. I throw him in my
fucking the protein shakes.

2814
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:32,520
I try. You know what? I drink. I drink.

2815
02:32:32,730 --> 02:32:35,460
This is what was going on when you guys
do is shut the Sunday show in Cleveland.

2816
02:32:35,790 --> 02:32:40,360
No, we used to fuck
that. I was backed by no,

2817
02:32:41,150 --> 02:32:43,390
fuck
that.

2818
02:32:44,440 --> 02:32:48,860
Fuck that part of the,
you should know. Hi Julie.

2819
02:32:48,870 --> 02:32:53,850
We want to book you on a Sunday night.
Unless you're paying the freight.

2820
02:32:53,851 --> 02:32:56,340
I can't do it because you're
knocking me out of my week.

2821
02:32:56,341 --> 02:32:58,480
That the fuck Outta here. We
got to, you got gotta farmers,

2822
02:32:59,040 --> 02:33:02,100
but 10 years ago if I went to a
restaurant, I thought that was healthy.

2823
02:33:02,101 --> 02:33:03,540
Mike before the book,

2824
02:33:03,660 --> 02:33:06,000
you don't know how nice it is in
the morning to make one egg and no,

2825
02:33:06,001 --> 02:33:09,350
you're not even home fries and a bunch
of disgusting butter from a stuck in the

2826
02:33:09,351 --> 02:33:12,180
diner. I grew up in Jersey.
He meets his brother.

2827
02:33:12,450 --> 02:33:16,740
So now I try to plan my Mr Diner
sometimes too. Oh and open steak sandwich,

2828
02:33:16,741 --> 02:33:21,300
a gravy on the French
cheese burger cheese.

2829
02:33:22,350 --> 02:33:26,550
But every time I of the charities, every
time I go to jersey, I say that myself.

2830
02:33:26,551 --> 02:33:28,530
I'm going to get a cheeseburger
deluxe and I don't.

2831
02:33:29,230 --> 02:33:32,790
So when I'm in Jersey with Johny
Hendricks on this last, uh, Fox card,

2832
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:37,680
I'm home every single day.
I had a jersey Friday disco fries,

2833
02:33:38,340 --> 02:33:43,160
French fries and gravy.
No out every day.

2834
02:33:43,170 --> 02:33:45,720
And port grow and cheats.
Oh, you know what I mean?

2835
02:33:45,721 --> 02:33:48,820
So there's my earned meals because I've
been grinding for so long and I may,

2836
02:33:48,821 --> 02:33:51,960
I'm going home, I'm going in jersey,
I'm eating like a crazy motherfucker.

2837
02:33:52,320 --> 02:33:53,400
And that's exactly what I did.

2838
02:33:53,401 --> 02:33:56,790
I built that up and I worked towards
it and I knew six weeks beforehand I'm

2839
02:33:56,791 --> 02:34:00,840
going to do it. You're going to do, we
believe in a cheat days, cheat meals,

2840
02:34:00,841 --> 02:34:02,330
and I use the cheat meals,

2841
02:34:02,610 --> 02:34:04,830
earned meals because cheating
has a negative connotation. It's,

2842
02:34:04,890 --> 02:34:07,830
I'm going to earn this,
I'm an this and I plan.

2843
02:34:08,180 --> 02:34:10,550
And then seven weeks I'll be back
in Jersey, one of the pizza place.

2844
02:34:11,140 --> 02:34:13,380
But you know what I mean?
We work at Harbin and run farther.

2845
02:34:13,381 --> 02:34:18,180
I'm going to eat better. I'm going to do
more things so I can have that. The, the

2846
02:34:18,190 --> 02:34:21,580
investment in myself where I can go out
there and do a little bit more and feel

2847
02:34:21,581 --> 02:34:25,420
good and have that emotional purge. No,
we can put you on the map. My gold chain.

2848
02:34:25,480 --> 02:34:28,220
Let's get Joey Diaz healthy. Can
we get, Joey has really helped me.

2849
02:34:28,900 --> 02:34:31,420
I'm going to say we've already started
that. Michael Chang we started today.

2850
02:34:31,940 --> 02:34:33,910
You're showing them is not
taking any of his bullshit.

2851
02:34:34,300 --> 02:34:37,570
He's screaming and yelling. I love it.
I'm going to send you a tape every week.

2852
02:34:38,850 --> 02:34:41,830
That's how I'm doing it from marijuana.
But my man,

2853
02:34:41,831 --> 02:34:45,120
Mike don't checks were in the middle of
a podcast and Joey's just pull out a kid.

2854
02:34:45,170 --> 02:34:48,760
The video podcasts. It's not
filming. It's not filming.

2855
02:34:49,320 --> 02:34:50,290
Brian's a wizard.

2856
02:34:51,460 --> 02:34:55,930
You can't trick Brian Trick
Brian with some technology. No,

2857
02:34:55,931 --> 02:34:59,260
I'm not saying it wasn't on purpose,
but you can't. You know, you see,

2858
02:34:59,261 --> 02:35:01,540
you know when the fucking thing
is working. Joey has no idea.

2859
02:35:01,720 --> 02:35:05,530
I don't fucking video. It was like
that bad flavor here with my boys,

2860
02:35:05,680 --> 02:35:08,820
Joe Rogan making video,
dolce and red band.

2861
02:35:09,070 --> 02:35:12,800
They put me on the dolce
challenge. How many pounds? Torque?

2862
02:35:12,850 --> 02:35:17,110
30 30 pounds. The goal is to
make your head look too big,

2863
02:35:17,590 --> 02:35:19,420
but it's really about being healthy.

2864
02:35:19,660 --> 02:35:22,810
So every week I'm going to make a little
