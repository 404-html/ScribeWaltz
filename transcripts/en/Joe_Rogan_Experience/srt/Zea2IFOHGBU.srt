00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:04,090
Yeah.

3
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:05,040
I just feel like,

4
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:05,874
um,

5
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,710
there's a certain amount of energy that
people get from wanting to prove other

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,544
folks wrong.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:11,821
Yeah,

8
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:12,150
no,

9
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:12,601
for sure.

10
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:13,110
For sure.

11
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,800
And uh,

12
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,280
it can,

13
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,350
it can help you in some ways.

14
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:17,280
It can certainly help you,

15
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,990
but I think sometimes even like,

16
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,570
what are you talking about the
benefits you had a cocaine,

17
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,250
like there's benefits to it.

18
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,070
There's like you could say things and
do things he ordinarily wouldn't be able

19
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:26,820
to do.

20
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,000
Well,

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,100
this is the motivation of,

22
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:31,140
of like proving people wrong.

23
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,561
You know,

24
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,400
I'll show you,

25
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:32,970
you know,

26
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,080
you said I was going to be shit,

27
00:00:34,081 --> 00:00:34,914
I'll show you.

28
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,890
Like you get to a certain point in time
that could kind of play against you too,

29
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:38,370
right?

30
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:38,850
Yes.

31
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,850
It could backfire because then it
becomes it for me it becomes like an a,

32
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,250
and I definitely did my last,

33
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,520
not the album I did mom
before last with that,

34
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,110
that angry,

35
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,400
I'll show you quite full
like villain this energy,

36
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,540
you know?

37
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,970
And I was able to make
some really great records,

38
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,580
but it was the most aggressive
music I had ever made.

39
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:03,240
Right.

40
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,601
And,

41
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:04,434
um,

42
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,080
some of it was the most
aggressive and a lot of levels,

43
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:08,130
not even in a mean way,

44
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,881
but just like,

45
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,151
you know,

46
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:10,530
just the music itself.

47
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:11,320
Um,

48
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,670
and that,

49
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,890
and I benefited the,

50
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,310
the,

51
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,860
the,

52
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,191
you know,

53
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:16,140
what I set out to do,

54
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,700
you know,

55
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,820
it all benefited,

56
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,181
you know,

57
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:18,900
but,

58
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,733
um,

59
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,640
I didn't,

60
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,850
it wasn't the normal way I
went about making an album,

61
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,170
so it was weird,

62
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,591
you know,

63
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:25,741
and,

64
00:01:25,741 --> 00:01:29,670
and it was something that I took a step
backward afterwards and then drop the

65
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,361
second album and like,

66
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:30,541
all right,

67
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,171
this one's not.

68
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:31,591
So,

69
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:31,890
um,

70
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:33,760
I don't really feel like I'm,

71
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,860
I'm like going,

72
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,460
you know,

73
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,470
up against the masters.

74
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:38,040
Like I really have
something to prove here.

75
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,290
This is more just like about like
just being at some type of peace,

76
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,831
you know,

77
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:46,770
and just having things sorted out once
all the madness is all done and just

78
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,460
kinda dislike.

79
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,570
Now it's just like,

80
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,863
right,

81
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,310
right.

82
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,611
You know,

83
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,430
and that's why I did indicat
another satellite flight.

84
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:53,701
You know,

85
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:57,240
cause I feel like in the cup was me
just figuring out how to produce,

86
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,140
you know,

87
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,430
and make records and then satellite fight
was me having it mastered and finally

88
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:07,140
putting together something that was
just like fine tune but in a different

89
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:09,210
structure where I have like
some instrumentals and then,

90
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,120
you know,

91
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,920
w you know,

92
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,410
the kind of like interludes
and then you know,

93
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:16,050
records that would just completely,

94
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:16,450
you know,

95
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,030
format it in different ways.

96
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Maybe not the three verse two Hook formula
and maybe just one long verse in one

97
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,930
altro and you know,

98
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:25,950
maybe no hook at all,

99
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,530
maybe no drums for the
first minute and 30 seconds,

100
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:29,640
but there's like wraps,

101
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,720
you know,

102
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,640
just experiment and then try and things,

103
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:33,210
you know,

104
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,610
not that I have that expertise
for creating a record,

105
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,270
you know?

106
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:36,931
Did you ever,

107
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:37,380
um,

108
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,000
listened to the brand new heavies?

109
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,850
I know some records here,

110
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,640
the brand new heavies did this
rap thing where they're gods.

111
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,250
It was trying to remember the name of it.

112
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,300
Um,

113
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,601
there's,

114
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,110
uh,

115
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,150
but it was along those lines,

116
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,620
like very experimental.

117
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:54,720
And this is like back in
like the early nineties.

118
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,500
They did like Kool g rap did one of them.

119
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,010
And did it like to like some
like actual music behind it?

120
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,790
Like yeah,

121
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,320
it was pretty interesting stuff.

122
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,270
But I remember that and
I remember thinking like,

123
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,020
man,

124
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,260
like why don't more people do
like Weird Shit with music?

125
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,750
Like how many people are
thinking the way you're thinking?

126
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,584
Like saying like,

127
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:14,861
okay,

128
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,330
how about we just do no drums for like
the first minute and a half and then just

129
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,420
start rapping and then the drums kicking
like these kinds of things where you

130
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,440
just like coming up with,

131
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:23,980
uh,

132
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,630
like just a different approach,

133
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,190
slightly different entry.

134
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,960
I think people are just a little
scared that they'll lose the audience's

135
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,541
attention.

136
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,760
And which is the very,

137
00:03:32,761 --> 00:03:35,220
a real fear.

138
00:03:35,221 --> 00:03:35,431
It's,

139
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:35,551
I,

140
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:36,384
I get it,

141
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,341
you know,

142
00:03:37,341 --> 00:03:39,270
but it also goes back
to what I was saying.

143
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:39,390
Like,

144
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,200
I've just been blessed with a family stat.

145
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,034
Like,

146
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:42,990
you know,

147
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,880
it's into what I'm doing no matter what,

148
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,391
you know.

149
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,080
Uh,

150
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,913
and that's,

151
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,300
that's just dope.

152
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,631
You know,

153
00:03:48,631 --> 00:03:49,560
but the average artist,

154
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:49,741
no,

155
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:51,120
they can't just experiment.

156
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:54,060
And there's this fear where they might
not sell records and then that's bad for

157
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:55,530
business and this is a business,

158
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,491
you know.

159
00:03:56,491 --> 00:03:57,324
Um,

160
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:57,991
so,

161
00:03:57,991 --> 00:03:58,530
you know,

162
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,363
um,

163
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,140
it's,

164
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,430
it's understood why most
guys don't really do it.

165
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:02,790
You know,

166
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,230
I would like to see people do it.

167
00:04:04,231 --> 00:04:05,064
I feel like there's,

168
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,170
that's not an excuse.

169
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,840
I feel like there's a way where people
can be a little bit more creative and

170
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:12,030
push the envelope a lot
more with the music,

171
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,691
uh,

172
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:13,770
where it fits in,

173
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:14,220
in a,

174
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:14,580
in a,

175
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,110
in a way that makes sense.

176
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,520
And it's true to their,

177
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:20,790
their art and their formula.

178
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,700
I feel like the,

179
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:21,961
yeah,

180
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:26,961
there's always a way to try something
new and be innovative and bring something

181
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,610
different to the table if
anybody wants to check out that,

182
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,500
that brand new heavies
that I was talking about,

183
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:33,750
it's called heavy rhyme experience.

184
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:34,561
Uh,

185
00:04:34,561 --> 00:04:36,210
and it was the brand new heavies.

186
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:39,150
It was 92 way back in the day when I was,

187
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,280
I was living in New York and um,

188
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,800
my friend God,

189
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,643
goddammit,

190
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,820
trying to remember his name,

191
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:46,260
standup comedian told me about him.

192
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:46,551
He goes,

193
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,311
you gotta listen to this shit.

194
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:48,630
These guys are doing some weird stuff.

195
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,230
They did a Doula with Kool g rap.

196
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,011
They did a,

197
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,650
one of them with a uh,

198
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,613
gangstarr.

199
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,700
It was pretty bad ass that a
bunch of different collaboration.

200
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:02,160
So like jazz singers with like rap,

201
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:03,000
like serious,

202
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,070
like best of the class back then
hardcore rappers rapping over their uh,

203
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:09,360
their ride or their music.

204
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,960
It was pretty cool.

205
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,130
Well,

206
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,963
AH,

207
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,630
yeah.

208
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,300
Um,

209
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,040
but your,

210
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,220
your point about having the fan base that
allows you to fuck around and practice

211
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,360
and take chances,

212
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
that is huge,

213
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:19,801
isn't it?

214
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:20,600
Like this,

215
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,210
the mentality that you know,

216
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:22,680
they,

217
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,680
they like you as a person as
well as like your music so that,

218
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:27,330
and they want you,

219
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,350
they want to see where you go with it.

220
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:28,690
Yeah.

221
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,990
You're always going to do your best
know it comes from a pure place to,

222
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,370
no,

223
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,430
I'm not like they know me
as a top 10 single say no,

224
00:05:36,431 --> 00:05:38,770
I'm just trying to make some cool
shit that they can connect with.

225
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,490
And that's the extent every time it
doesn't go beyond that and the minute it

226
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:43,121
tries to,

227
00:05:43,121 --> 00:05:44,470
it just starts getting frustrating.

228
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:47,620
Like start thinking about a radio
record to please somebody at the label.

229
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,480
Then it gets frustrating if I started
thinking about this and that for this.

230
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,590
And it gets frustrating if I
keep it just based on like,

231
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,160
amen,

232
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,450
this sounds gnarly and this,

233
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,790
make sure it's not too trippy in this.

234
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,680
Make sure it's not to
this and not do that.

235
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:01,130
But,

236
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,963
uh,

237
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,060
effortless combination of
everything all at once,

238
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,840
you know?

239
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,111
And,

240
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:06,410
and,

241
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:11,270
and that's really what these past
couple of years for me have been like.

242
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:16,010
Just mastering that
technique is a producer and,

243
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:16,844
um,

244
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,253
you know,

245
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:18,951
really,

246
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:20,110
really just,

247
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:20,840
uh,

248
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,790
going all out creatively and just trying
new things because I also internally

249
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,880
don't feel like I have
anything else to prove,

250
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:28,943
um,

251
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,900
as a musician.

252
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,680
But I have that itch,

253
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,191
you know,

254
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,240
like I need to create,

255
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,230
I feel like that's like
working out for me.

256
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,550
It's like doing reps
and stand mentally fit,

257
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,660
creatively fit,

258
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:45,241
you know?

259
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:45,800
Um,

260
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,810
so when it comes time to do an album,

261
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,010
I got some new powers I've
acquired in the past year,

262
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:51,471
just like,

263
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:51,741
you know,

264
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:54,920
from just dicking around in the
studio for a couple of months.

265
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,510
It's going everyday and making beats,

266
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,910
whether I'm in the studio
for five hours or two hours,

267
00:06:58,911 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm making something.

268
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:04,961
I'm making at least like on average
I make about making the studio.

269
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,960
I'm making at least two
to four beats a day.

270
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,280
And when I say beats,

271
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,720
I'm talking about completed,

272
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,370
sequenced,

273
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:14,420
uh,

274
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,180
instrumentals that I
could make records on.

275
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:17,931
So like,

276
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:18,651
not just some shit.

277
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,530
I started a little bit and then it's kind
of cool and I'll get back to it later.

278
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,040
I have probably like a Baker's
dozen of those in one session,

279
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,040
but I'll have like four
that are officially like,

280
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,221
oh,

281
00:07:28,221 --> 00:07:29,150
these jams are dope.

282
00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:31,940
I'm going to sit and live with
these and see what comes up.

283
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,490
So when you sit down to write music,

284
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:34,911
do you,

285
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:37,820
do you sit down and do you have an
idea in your head or did you select,

286
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,470
let it come to you while you're there?

287
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,700
Like how do you know how to start?

288
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,353
Um,

289
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,693
it,

290
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,800
it comes different every time.

291
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:45,950
It,

292
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,491
it doesn't,

293
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,324
um,

294
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
it depends.

295
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,700
It could be a baseline that I'm
thinking of it that inspires me.

296
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:57,020
Or it could be me not have anything
in my mind and just going through the

297
00:07:57,021 --> 00:07:57,854
sounds,

298
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,293
uh,

299
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,200
or it could be like a rhythm are heard or,

300
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:04,221
you know,

301
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:04,731
anything.

302
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:06,320
It could be a movie I'm watching.

303
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,161
I like to,

304
00:08:07,161 --> 00:08:07,461
you know,

305
00:08:07,461 --> 00:08:09,800
produce while I'm watching
movies with the sound off.

306
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,343
Um,

307
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:11,791
in,

308
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,340
that kind of helps me with scoring.

309
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:13,701
You know,

310
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,920
when I get in the scoring and the,

311
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,410
you know,

312
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,210
doing as my next step,

313
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,421
you know,

314
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:21,080
I want to get more into scoring
movies and sound design.

315
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,413
Um,

316
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,720
but it's all,

317
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,583
for me,

318
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,030
it's all just experimentation
and just seeing what happens and,

319
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:28,880
and you know,

320
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,470
it's not any pressure.

321
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,490
And when you hear a beat,

322
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:33,200
like when you're making a
beat and you're creating it,

323
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,610
you're hearing lyrics.

324
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,420
Are you hearing,

325
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,310
are you thinking about,

326
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,920
yeah,

327
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,161
yeah,

328
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:37,880
I'm here.

329
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,713
I mean,

330
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,880
here's,

331
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:41,840
you know,

332
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,673
when I,

333
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,180
when I'm hearing something,

334
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:45,350
I hear a completed,

335
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,363
right.

336
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:49,560
So when I'm starting to record and I
feel like I got some of my right song,

337
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,530
like I feel like in this back
to what you were talking about,

338
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,530
cause you know,

339
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,481
I feel like,

340
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:53,900
you know,

341
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,260
time doesn't really exist.

342
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:58,830
So an hour from now is
happening right now.

343
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,310
Right.

344
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,430
So there's songs that are
created that I haven't made yet.

345
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,930
So when I'm in the studio I feel like
I have this small like peek into this

346
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:11,070
other world in this window
that I can hear the song.

347
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:16,310
But it's my job in the present to
find the pieces to make it some.

348
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,670
And sometimes it might come out exactly
like what I'm hearing and sometimes it

349
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,300
might not,

350
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,070
but there's never,

351
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,460
it's never really spot on.

352
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,760
And I just hear glimmers of what the
song completed sounds like until it's

353
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:28,231
completed.

354
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:28,891
And Dennis just,

355
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,730
everything's perfect.

356
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,950
But that's how I can sit there
and listen to a mix and be like,

357
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:32,784
something's off.

358
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,500
Because in my completed version,

359
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,161
you know,

360
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:36,360
it's like a coloring book.

361
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,610
Every record starts off in one way,

362
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,151
just blank.

363
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,760
And I'm just filling in all the colors
and then there's one color is still

364
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,594
missing.

365
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,500
You know,

366
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,030
that's what's happening in the final,

367
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:45,741
in the ninth in.

368
00:09:45,741 --> 00:09:46,260
And you know when,

369
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,041
when mix knob them,

370
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:50,190
I mean there's still some colors
that just not in there yet.

371
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,190
And then I'm going through sounds and I
find the colors and everything is full,

372
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,490
then I'm cool or I might not find the
exact color but some close enough I'm

373
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,324
fine.

374
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,830
And like that's literally where it's at,

375
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,380
where you have to make
the executive decision.

376
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:01,691
Like all right,

377
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:02,231
I'm done with this.

378
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:05,370
So I'll be sitting for another two weeks
trying to sit with this mix cause I'm

379
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:08,580
really anal about it and if I
don't just back away and let it be,

380
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,751
you know,

381
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:10,650
we'll never hear any news.

382
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,380
That's a fascinating insight
into the creation of music.

383
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,281
So I don't,

384
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:14,640
um,

385
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,730
I don't know anybody that does that like,

386
00:10:17,731 --> 00:10:20,760
well where they could tell me about the
entire process from the beginning to,

387
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,760
and so it's interesting to get a
window into that world because I always

388
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:25,320
wondered and I also always wondered like,

389
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,341
I Know James,

390
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:29,130
he never writes his lyrics down
and it keeps them all in his head.

391
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,670
Right.

392
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,680
Do you do that or do you actually
write them down somewhere?

393
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,400
Um,

394
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,233
Nah,

395
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,070
sometimes I'm sometimes,

396
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,680
I mean a lot of my hooks are in my head,

397
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,180
but I need to write,

398
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,740
you know,

399
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,640
certain things down to just
Kinda make sure I'm making sense.

400
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,490
I used to do a lot of my
earliest stuff just off the dome,

401
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,510
just freestyle and Shit,

402
00:10:48,511 --> 00:10:48,781
you know?

403
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,260
And,

404
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,330
and sometimes that works
good with melodies.

405
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:52,020
I do that a lot.

406
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,380
I'll go in there and just hum flows
and try different things like that and

407
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:56,214
melodies.

408
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,310
But it's really just a combination.

409
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,150
It's never the psych,

410
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:01,403
you know,

411
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,020
always like writing off the dome.

412
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:04,771
Like some balance.

413
00:11:04,771 --> 00:11:06,330
I'll write completely off the dome.

414
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,691
You know,

415
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:08,460
I don't need paper for a ballot,

416
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:10,620
but like if the [inaudible] off the dome,

417
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,341
yeah,

418
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:12,091
that's a great term.

419
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:13,290
I'm gonna use that from now on.

420
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,600
Whenever there's a joke that I have,

421
00:11:14,601 --> 00:11:15,780
it's not written down anywhere.

422
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:16,830
It's going to be off the dome.

423
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:17,370
Yeah,

424
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,350
that was the end.

425
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,910
I feel like that it Kinda like,

426
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,600
you know,

427
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,250
gets people to understand
that this is some,

428
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,700
you know,

429
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,530
this,

430
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:24,750
this,

431
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,280
the spontaneousness of it,

432
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,060
you know?

433
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:27,480
Um,

434
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,390
is that something alternative rappers
use all the time or is that your term off

435
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:31,050
the dome?

436
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,883
Is that yours?

437
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,100
Oh,

438
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,933
I can't say.

439
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,010
I like to say,

440
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,390
I know the guy came home off the dome.

441
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,780
It's a very popular phrase
amongst the younger now,

442
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,130
but it all came out of kid.

443
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,023
I'll take it.

444
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,230
They get,

445
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,100
I'll start spreading that.

446
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,571
You're essentially,

447
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,370
you're open.

448
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:49,591
I mean,

449
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:49,981
whatever,

450
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:50,910
which way ever comes,

451
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,744
you just show up,

452
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,100
you show up and you put in the work,

453
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:53,921
you put in the work,

454
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,240
creating the beats you put in the work,

455
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,690
come on,

456
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:56,590
coming up with lyrics,

457
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,850
whatever way it comes up.

458
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,060
Where it comes up all in your head when
it comes up writing it down on paper and

459
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:06,061
the sessions are really me and my engineer
in and occasionally I have like my

460
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,990
brother from another mother.

461
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:08,231
Dot.

462
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,030
The genes coming through who,

463
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:10,361
you know,

464
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,510
it was an abandoned I came up with
a couple of years ago and that,

465
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:13,840
you know,

466
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,720
we kind of just put together because we
wanted to try something outside of the

467
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:16,930
world.

468
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,190
We were already making music in,

469
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,850
you know it's this,

470
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,570
the sessions are really small.

471
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:24,310
It's not like I got 20 dudes in there.

472
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,173
Right.

473
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,800
They're kind of sad sessions.

474
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,080
They're really sad and probably not sad.

475
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,070
Why was wondering I anything,

476
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,040
you can't feel bad for me like,

477
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,680
oh he's got no money in
the studio all went down.

478
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,693
But then like,

479
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,171
but then like,

480
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:40,510
you know like I'm in there
like a mad scientist.

481
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:41,021
Like you know,

482
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:42,090
I'm inventing right.

483
00:12:42,091 --> 00:12:42,730
It's not like,

484
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:43,001
you know,

485
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:45,370
an inventor don't got
20 motherfuckers in his,

486
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:45,881
his lab.

487
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:46,780
Why he ain't been shit.

488
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:48,280
Niggas is still as shit or they'll,

489
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:48,881
you know,

490
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,210
rack focus and you know,

491
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,223
distract him.

492
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,820
He got.

493
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,470
I find that when you have
your friends in the studio,

494
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:53,831
you got,

495
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:54,340
you know,

496
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,840
a couple guys on Worldstar,

497
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,070
a couple of guys on Twitter,

498
00:12:57,071 --> 00:12:59,740
a couple of guys over here and everybody's
talking about what's going on over

499
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,670
here and what's going on in here.

500
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,660
You're trying to write this song,

501
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,331
you get distracted.

502
00:13:02,331 --> 00:13:03,090
You like what happened?

503
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:03,851
Oh Hell Naw.

504
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:04,301
That's funny.

505
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:04,780
Funny.

506
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,490
Next thing you know it's
two hours have gone by.

507
00:13:06,491 --> 00:13:07,900
You still working on this record,

508
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,890
you had some lasts but when you came
to the studio for is not done yet.

509
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,521
Right.

510
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:12,761
You know,

511
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:13,970
and there's money being spent in,

512
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:14,531
there's time.

513
00:13:14,531 --> 00:13:15,400
Time is of the essence.

514
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,010
This is what we hustled
and worked hard for.

515
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,121
You know,

516
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:19,870
and I have to,

517
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,290
I had to remind myself as like,

518
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,760
man this has turned into a fucking
party and I moved here for work.

519
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,270
So also have this like
really gnarly work ethic.

520
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:28,540
Like,

521
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,660
cause I've been working since I
was 15 my first job was Wendy's.

522
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:34,000
I remember why I wanted to work.

523
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:35,500
It was because I want it in my own shit.

524
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:39,730
I was tired of asking my mom for stuff
and also didn't think it was fair,

525
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,061
you know,

526
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,580
to ask my mom for stuff because
I know we didn't have much.

527
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,720
So,

528
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,350
you know,

529
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,580
I just had that work for me is always
like one of those things that's very

530
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:49,180
important.

531
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,690
Yeah.

532
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,660
But like there was also some jobs
that I didn't fucking take seriously,

533
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:53,710
like American apparel,

534
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,923
you know,

535
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:57,490
where I was like coming in
late and I didn't give a shit.

536
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,080
And then like when my boss fired me,

537
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,850
like he took me to like this office and
kind of told me and when he said he's

538
00:14:03,851 --> 00:14:03,941
like,

539
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:04,601
I'm gonna have to let you go.

540
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:04,841
I was like,

541
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:05,500
yeah,

542
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,990
I figured that they knew it
because I didn't give a fuck.

543
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,321
You know,

544
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:08,711
it was like,

545
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:10,120
I now I can go to the studio.

546
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:10,950
Well it's probably not,

547
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,130
can make it work and like work on my
craft and then maybe find a better paying

548
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:15,600
job.

549
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:15,870
You know,

550
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,610
it doesn't have me in the fucking
basement of some building,

551
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:18,971
you know,

552
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:20,110
sweating my ass off phone,

553
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:20,560
clothes.

554
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,780
Everybody says you should always
do your best at every job you do.

555
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,140
A champion in life is a
champion and everything they do.

556
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,280
So if you're going to mop floors,

557
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:27,791
do your best,

558
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,980
and my pores Motha fuck
out of those floors.

559
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,660
That's great on paper.

560
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,730
But the reality is when
you're a young man,

561
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,890
it's sometimes it's good
to fuck off at something.

562
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:36,371
So you know,

563
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:37,750
you don't ever want to do that again.

564
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,570
They fire you and then you
learn and there's some,

565
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:41,740
there's some value in that.

566
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,700
It's unfortunate,

567
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,920
but we don't all learn the best way.

568
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,350
Sometimes we got to get
fired from American apparel.

569
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:47,960
Yeah,

570
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,793
yeah.

571
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,950
At least I didn't get fired
for like stealing something.

572
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,120
I got fired for being a Shitty landscaper.

573
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:58,310
Scalping people's lawns that
will fuck somebody as emotions.

574
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,020
I would hurt my feelings if somebody just,

575
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,480
if that was like the word
around town that I've been,

576
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:02,811
you know,

577
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:06,800
my main bread and butter I've been doing
invest in my life and just shitty yet

578
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,540
feelings.

579
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:08,781
Yeah.

580
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:13,781
I wasn't invested in being a
landmark toddler boy landscaper.

581
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:14,931
Yeah,

582
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:15,141
I know.

583
00:15:15,141 --> 00:15:15,741
I know what you're saying,

584
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:16,160
man.

585
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,890
It said there's a completely different
thing when you're creating your own

586
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:19,281
stuff.

587
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:20,510
We were working for yourself.

588
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,370
Then it's like a focus,

589
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,181
like an obsession,

590
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,230
almost type focused,

591
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,310
like the laser beam.

592
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,510
I love that term.

593
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,410
The lab too.

594
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:29,420
That's one of my favorite
terms from the rap,

595
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,530
the rap world.

596
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,150
They love talking about being in the lab,

597
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,520
creating material who are
like an inventor scientist.

598
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,380
You know,

599
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,160
it's,

600
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,360
it's Kinda like I treat it and
that'd be sense of the word.

601
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:41,941
And every since that,

602
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:42,170
that,

603
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:42,440
that,

604
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,273
that,

605
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,760
that,

606
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,440
that term I asked me know lab,

607
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,600
it's like where I'm working,

608
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:52,550
it's working and almost don't like playing
around and in the studio like that,

609
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:52,820
like,

610
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,130
cause it is a place for work.

611
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,881
It is an office,

612
00:15:55,881 --> 00:15:56,090
you know,

613
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,290
especially if you're trying to write,

614
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:59,510
if you're trying to write
things there too as well.

615
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,310
He tried to write lyrics and dudes are
all jumping around and not even that.

616
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,670
What if I'm not even
just me sitting there,

617
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,200
I might not have an idea yet,

618
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,060
even if I might just in silence.

619
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,601
Right,

620
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:08,871
right,

621
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:09,200
right.

622
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,330
I might just need fucking
silence for a little bit.

623
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:11,841
Yeah,

624
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:12,141
I don't,

625
00:16:12,141 --> 00:16:16,250
I've never been to any sort of a
recording studio where anybody was doing

626
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:17,690
anything like serious like that.

627
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,140
But I would imagine it's very
difficult to avoid the party.

628
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,741
It's like,

629
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,041
Hey,

630
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,520
we're in studio and guys
come to visit you come on by,

631
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,191
come to visit.

632
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:25,851
We did that.

633
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,740
So it's like I did that now it's like,

634
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,650
I mean I was,

635
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:34,010
I've been doing that's like do music
professionally since like 2123 going to

636
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:37,610
studios and having those moments with
the bugs because in the beginning it's

637
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:38,840
like you want your boys around.

638
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,360
So I kind of got that out of
my system and now it's like,

639
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:42,194
all right,

640
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,900
30 year old Scott goes
with studio by himself.

641
00:16:44,901 --> 00:16:45,740
He's got his book bag,

642
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:46,880
he's in there for maybe five,

643
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:50,030
six hours and then he goes home that
smart and you know what I'm saying?

644
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:51,950
And then he's like Friday night,

645
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:53,030
you know,

646
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,331
like,

647
00:16:53,331 --> 00:16:57,230
and good for you in bed by
like 11 1130 and Kapow Fuck,

648
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:58,064
sorry.

649
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,630
That's beautiful.

650
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,490
Yeah,

651
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,281
no may man.

652
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,390
That's how you get shit done.

653
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:03,920
That is how you get shit done.

654
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:04,830
I'm just psycho.

655
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:08,000
We didn't man those music videos though
when they showed the recording studio,

656
00:17:08,001 --> 00:17:09,500
it's always a giant table.

657
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,690
There's like all those little
switches that nobody understands.

658
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,760
Maybe you get a mixing board.

659
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,400
Everybody's,

660
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,610
everybody's standing in front of all the
switches and then everybody's partying.

661
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,750
Everybody's in the background,

662
00:17:17,751 --> 00:17:18,590
having a good time.

663
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,260
But that could also be when the
album's done and then celebrating it.

664
00:17:21,261 --> 00:17:22,460
Cause that's what also happens.

665
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,780
Like when I'm done with,

666
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,030
say I finished maybe eight songs
and I feel like I've got the album,

667
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:29,211
like,

668
00:17:29,211 --> 00:17:31,280
and I just need maybe a couple more jams.

669
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,110
You start inviting people to come here,

670
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:34,770
which you got and get their hands.

671
00:17:34,771 --> 00:17:36,080
So you had those moments too.

672
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:38,110
So you might see that happen and,

673
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,660
but,

674
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:42,770
but there's a year and a half of just
studio by myself before that happens,

675
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,791
you know,

676
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,601
like I don't really,

677
00:17:44,601 --> 00:17:45,640
and maybe a case that happened,

678
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:46,520
one or two friends,

679
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:46,970
you know,

680
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,803
maybe some,

681
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,810
one of my director friends are,

682
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,160
um,

683
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,060
my fellow actors.

684
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:52,170
So I just kinda want,

685
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,210
who have never really got
a chance to have been in,

686
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,110
be in the studio,

687
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,940
come by and just see,

688
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:57,721
get to experience.

689
00:17:57,721 --> 00:17:58,441
But they're not in,

690
00:17:58,441 --> 00:17:59,310
they're distracting me.

691
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,670
They're just watching and paying
attention and want to just be a fly on the

692
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:02,980
wall.

693
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,813
See how it works.

694
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:04,590
Yeah.

695
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,500
Well a lot of people were really
curious about it cause it's a,

696
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:12,501
it's almost a sort of a mysterious type
of creativity if people aren't involved

697
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,100
in especially the creating of music.

698
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,210
It's such a cultural,

699
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:16,711
uh,

700
00:18:16,711 --> 00:18:18,210
it's such a cultural influence.

701
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,010
So it's such a powerful influence.

702
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:20,940
Like your music has,

703
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,590
it inspires people.

704
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:24,840
Like when you listening
to music at the gym,

705
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,330
it can make you work out better.

706
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,480
Like you put your headphones on
and you play some awesome songs.

707
00:18:30,481 --> 00:18:32,970
You don't give a fuck that you're
on some stupid stamp machine,

708
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,960
like a hamster.

709
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,050
You just keep going.

710
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,193
And then music,

711
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,890
you liked the music so much.

712
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:39,330
You get into it and it's only,

713
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,164
it's in your head,

714
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,700
drowning out everything else.

715
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,780
Sometimes you don't even realize
how heavy your breathing until you,

716
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:45,061
you know,

717
00:18:45,061 --> 00:18:46,380
you take the earplugs out,

718
00:18:46,381 --> 00:18:46,591
you're like,

719
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:47,430
Holy Shit,

720
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,200
I'm getting it in working here.

721
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,440
It's because of nothing else
like hits you like that.

722
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:54,450
Like people's words,

723
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,740
they don't sustain that way.

724
00:18:55,741 --> 00:19:00,120
You can't like read incredibly passionate
essay and it sustains you through a

725
00:19:00,121 --> 00:19:00,954
workout like that.

726
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,181
Yeah,

727
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:01,410
no,

728
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,190
it's like,

729
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:04,800
it needs to be just something that like,

730
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,140
there's nothing like
music in that respect.

731
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,590
It has,

732
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,570
it has an impact that very few things do.

733
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,740
So that,

734
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:15,150
that process of creating it is always
fascinating and mysterious to people like

735
00:19:15,151 --> 00:19:17,790
me that don't have any
musical talent at all.

736
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,683
Yeah.

737
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,770
I,

738
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,603
um,

739
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:23,130
I just approached it in a different way,

740
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,730
uh,

741
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,401
because I'm,

742
00:19:24,401 --> 00:19:25,234
I'm just,

743
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,180
I do feel like I'm just,

744
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:28,310
every time I'm in the studio,

745
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,030
it's me just,

746
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,983
you know,

747
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,041
trying to create the,

748
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:36,510
uncreate it and it's a very
private thing sometimes.

749
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,583
You know,

750
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,483
I want to,

751
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:39,990
I want to be able to,

752
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,440
you know,

753
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,940
have my privacy when I do that.

754
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,650
Right,

755
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,260
right.

756
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,561
Yeah.

757
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:43,711
No,

758
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:44,610
I totally do.

759
00:19:44,611 --> 00:19:48,120
You do all your writing and everything
and the studio or do you sometimes sit at

760
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:48,540
home?

761
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:48,820
Oh,

762
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,950
it comes whenever a man,

763
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:50,640
right.

764
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,630
I'll be in the shower.

765
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,130
Do you have any of the shower?

766
00:19:53,131 --> 00:19:53,970
I'm thinking of some shit,

767
00:19:53,971 --> 00:19:54,420
you know,

768
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:54,691
give a,

769
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:57,120
use that a note app on the phone,

770
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:58,530
on your phone where you're talking to it.

771
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,400
Um,

772
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,181
record memos.

773
00:20:00,181 --> 00:20:00,450
Yeah,

774
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:00,871
a lot.

775
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:01,501
A lot of the time.

776
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:02,041
Not even that.

777
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:02,880
I mean the note app,

778
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,151
you know,

779
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,840
you can talk to it and
a voice recognition.

780
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,510
None of them.

781
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:09,150
I just kind of see if I'm
recording something as a melody.

782
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,120
Okay.

783
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,310
If I'm thinking of some missing mail,

784
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:13,600
I'm not like thinking of
wraps like other days.

785
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,650
It's less about that now
and it's more about like,

786
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,200
um,

787
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,260
like melodies and coming up
with songs and structure.

788
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,710
You want to hear the sound and then the
lyrics come next because the music is

789
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:26,880
just going to tell me what to say,

790
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:27,840
you know?

791
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,660
Wow.

792
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,000
That's,

793
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
that's fucking wild.

794
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:31,201
That's so cool.

795
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:35,970
Now how much of your creation is done
under the influence of marijuana?

796
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,493
Man,

797
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,440
I don't smoke to create,

798
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,440
I've come up with a lot of Shit's
sober sometimes when I'm fresh,

799
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,490
waking up in the morning.

800
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,030
Like sometimes the most ideas that like
8:00 AM sometimes people say that a lot

801
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:52,000
of writers like Stephen King I believe
does all of his writing in the morning.

802
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:53,980
I think he doesn't like
nine to noon every day.

803
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,540
It's like man,

804
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,100
I'm fresh in the morning with something,

805
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,200
some melody.

806
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,680
And it usually comes as walking through
the house and making breakfast and you

807
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,660
know,

808
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,710
it could be whenever it dropping a Deuce,

809
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,603
you know,

810
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,020
I'll come up with just melodies here
and there and I record them all if

811
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:11,830
something really catches me.

812
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,720
Cause if I don't record them
immediately and not lose them.

813
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,621
So I,

814
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:15,340
you know,

815
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,750
I got to record them somehow.

816
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,311
But it's,

817
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,031
it's very,

818
00:21:19,031 --> 00:21:19,600
um,

819
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,433
I'm always,

820
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,570
I'm always thinking about music as much
as like I like to deny it and you know,

821
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,980
go shoot a movie and shit.

822
00:21:26,981 --> 00:21:27,814
And you know,

823
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,770
I always think about music.

824
00:21:29,771 --> 00:21:32,800
I'm obsessed with the idea of just making,

825
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,663
you know,

826
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,700
the most beautiful songs that like,

827
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,061
you know,

828
00:21:37,061 --> 00:21:41,110
really make people feel some type of
comfort or some type of understanding

829
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,310
because the world is so fucked.

830
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,713
And uh,

831
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,190
you know,

832
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,140
I just really am obsessed with that idea.

833
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,430
I think I'm always going to be,

834
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:49,900
and now I'm just trying different,

835
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,190
different ways of doing that.

836
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:52,024
You know,

837
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,440
we did the rap shit,

838
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:54,550
we did the rock album.

839
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:55,131
No,

840
00:21:55,131 --> 00:21:57,620
I'm just trying to be this
like weird instrumentalist,

841
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,111
you know,

842
00:21:59,111 --> 00:22:01,630
and I don't really know
when that's going to be,

843
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:02,620
but I'm just really,

844
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:05,110
I guess in the process learning
how to produce better too,

845
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:05,944
which is,

846
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,640
uh,

847
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,390
is something that,

848
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:07,810
you know,

849
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:08,650
I've been trying to,

850
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,270
I always want to be better,

851
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:14,230
so it's good to be learning and
getting better as I'm creating.

852
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,960
Do you do any other things
like other than music,

853
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:21,961
do you have any other hobbies or things
that like I'm also get locked into a,

854
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:24,460
I like design and sometimes like,

855
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:25,260
uh,

856
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,790
and I wouldn't look at myself
as like a fashion designer,

857
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:28,624
but you know,

858
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:31,600
if an opportunity comes around
I'll do a collaborative.

859
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,040
You like designing clothes?

860
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,810
Like,

861
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,030
yeah,

862
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,420
like I've done a five t shirt,

863
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:38,360
collaborations with bay,

864
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:38,920
the name.

865
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,753
Um,

866
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:40,571
I used to work there.

867
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,520
That was my last job before I got famous,

868
00:22:42,521 --> 00:22:42,791
you know,

869
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,320
so like I have,

870
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,240
you know,

871
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,570
roots back in New York and that
was pretty much one of those,

872
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,080
the only job I've really kept
in touch with and you know,

873
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,370
that I went back to and,

874
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,130
you know,

875
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,410
did some things for the fans.

876
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:57,010
So you just saying up creating shit.

877
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:57,881
Yeah,

878
00:22:57,881 --> 00:22:58,210
it doesn't,

879
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:58,601
yeah.

880
00:22:58,601 --> 00:22:58,931
You know,

881
00:22:58,931 --> 00:22:59,530
it really,

882
00:22:59,530 --> 00:22:59,861
for me,

883
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,210
I'm starting to write a little bit more.

884
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,950
It's just staying creative,

885
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,251
right?

886
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:06,040
Like realizing like a
book or like blog entries.

887
00:23:06,041 --> 00:23:06,790
Like what do you mean?

888
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:10,150
Like a TV show or TV shows,

889
00:23:10,151 --> 00:23:11,380
horror movies,

890
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:11,590
uh,

891
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,570
ideas I've had in my head for a while.

892
00:23:13,571 --> 00:23:15,160
I'll just start jotting them down and,

893
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,390
you know,

894
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,920
just everything right now it's just me
just expressing whatever comes to mind,

895
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:21,401
you know,

896
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:21,580
uh,

897
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,010
anything that creatively strikes me.

898
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:24,401
Yeah.

899
00:23:24,401 --> 00:23:24,551
See,

900
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:28,750
that's a dream job for people to be
able to just come up with things all the

901
00:23:28,751 --> 00:23:29,340
time.

902
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,060
Just work on creating your,

903
00:23:31,061 --> 00:23:32,380
your entire day spent.

904
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:33,730
Mostly just concentrating on creating.

905
00:23:33,731 --> 00:23:35,170
I'm not doing anything with those things.

906
00:23:35,171 --> 00:23:35,261
Yeah.

907
00:23:35,261 --> 00:23:35,980
But it's,

908
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,731
it's stimulating,

909
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:37,350
you know,

910
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,440
it doesn't mean that I'm going to have
some TV show tomorrow or up or anything,

911
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:42,910
or it's just for me,

912
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:43,090
it,

913
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:43,923
it,

914
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,561
it just,

915
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:45,470
it's stimulating,

916
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:45,981
you know,

917
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:46,151
and,

918
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:46,984
and Shit,

919
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,171
knowing me,

920
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:49,280
I'll fuck around on my right,

921
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,000
the next shit,

922
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,370
you know,

923
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,203
like,

924
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,040
or something that could
lead me to assumption going,

925
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,100
who knows?

926
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,933
But,

927
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,750
um,

928
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,010
and it probably also helps you,

929
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:01,421
your,

930
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,380
your creativity in the
other areas as well.

931
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:03,830
Right.

932
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,910
But then on top of that,

933
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,280
I was the king of being like,

934
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:07,491
Oh,

935
00:24:07,491 --> 00:24:08,271
I have this idea,

936
00:24:08,271 --> 00:24:08,661
but Nah,

937
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:09,440
that's not for me.

938
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:09,741
Or No,

939
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:10,574
I couldn't do that.

940
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:10,930
Um,

941
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,190
I,

942
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,020
music is my thing.

943
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:12,171
No,

944
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:13,004
I couldn't do that.

945
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,470
So now I'm like pass that now.

946
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:18,130
There's nothing if it pops into
my mind and I can fucking do it.

947
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:19,280
Cause I thought about it for a reason.

948
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,150
So now it's just about finding time for
certain projects and I'm not no rush.

949
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:25,690
You know,

950
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,400
I been worried about being pigeonholed.

951
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:27,920
You're saying?

952
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,251
No,

953
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,000
I think,

954
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,910
I think I've done enough
strong arm and then let me get,

955
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,331
you know,

956
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:36,680
my space as an artist where I can kind
of do whatever I want now at this point

957
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:37,910
she reached out to me.

958
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,110
I just want us to be good though.

959
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,081
Don't get me wrong.

960
00:24:40,081 --> 00:24:43,880
Like I'm always feeling like I'm
vulnerable to make some bullshit.

961
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,280
I don't feel like I'm invincible.

962
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:46,750
Like,

963
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,220
and I think a lot of artists do get to
that point where they feel invincible.

964
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,710
Like I am very capable
of making some weak shit.

965
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,140
Y'All motherfuckers don't hear it.

966
00:24:54,141 --> 00:24:54,591
And you know,

967
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:57,410
and who you ask because I'm sitting there
and making sure that this is not weak

968
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,720
shit and scrapping the ones that are and,

969
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:00,031
and,

970
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:02,600
and working on the ones
that started off weak,

971
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,081
but you know,

972
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:05,870
making sure that they were where they
needed to be before you heard it.

973
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:06,800
Um,

974
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,430
do you have there,

975
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,061
are they like,

976
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:09,320
you gotta know when to abandon them?

977
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:09,981
Oh yeah.

978
00:25:09,981 --> 00:25:13,010
You all know when to abandon some shit
immediately and certain feelings you get,

979
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,630
you know when some shit is the
right one and when it's not this,

980
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,970
there's jokes like that too.

981
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,960
Very similar.

982
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,350
Yeah,

983
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:18,980
very similar.

984
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,090
Some of them you just kind of let go.

985
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,390
Yeah.

986
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,680
And then you can't infer songs.

987
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,030
Some,

988
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,330
it's much more emotional to let go some
shit that you like because it might be

989
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:31,070
on the right track to being something
gnarly like the shelf maybe he visited.

990
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:31,731
Yeah.

991
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,780
I go back every year.

992
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,810
I go back and listen to the shit
that I made the year before.

993
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,840
How do you categorize them?

994
00:25:35,841 --> 00:25:36,121
Do you,

995
00:25:36,121 --> 00:25:37,670
do you make notes or do you need,

996
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,750
they're all numbered.

997
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,723
[inaudible] numbered.

998
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,330
You just say you go back and you go,

999
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:41,511
okay,

1000
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:44,330
this is from 2013 then we just
listened to what I was doing.

1001
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,050
My,

1002
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:45,681
my engineer,

1003
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:46,340
I'll just tell him,

1004
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,830
pull up everything and we'll just
listen to things one by one flag.

1005
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:51,440
The ones that are good and
are there ones that you know,

1006
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,131
cause that's the thing.

1007
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:54,860
You always got to give
yourself a break and uh,

1008
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,960
it's always good to listen
to stuff with fresh years.

1009
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,150
I find.

1010
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:58,450
And,

1011
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,283
and also,

1012
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:00,663
uh,

1013
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,270
to just give you your,

1014
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,130
your brain a break because for me,

1015
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:07,610
I'm sitting in the studio for hours
listening to the same old shit,

1016
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,720
like the same old beat,

1017
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:08,910
you know,

1018
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,711
that you're working on,

1019
00:26:09,711 --> 00:26:09,981
you know,

1020
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:13,690
so it's kind of like you need
to back off a second and like,

1021
00:26:13,691 --> 00:26:15,440
I like to work on a record,

1022
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:17,833
bounce him,

1023
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,590
whatever,

1024
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,160
you know,

1025
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,700
bouncing means kind of compressing all
those sounds to one track to make that MP

1026
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,603
three.

1027
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,190
That's what you bounced on a file.

1028
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:26,660
That's what you guys get on your,

1029
00:26:26,661 --> 00:26:27,410
um,

1030
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,950
iPods is a bounce down file
of all of all the files.

1031
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,880
Um,

1032
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,470
so I bounced down everything.

1033
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:34,993
Uh,

1034
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,910
every one of the ones that I feel
like we're close to being finished or

1035
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,520
reasonable enough for me
to listen to and write too.

1036
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,110
And um,

1037
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:43,920
I won't to him that night.

1038
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,270
I'll wake up the next day and while I'm
making breakfast on my listen to him,

1039
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:49,200
then with fresh ears and I'll be like,

1040
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,681
aw shit.

1041
00:26:49,681 --> 00:26:50,460
Most of the time it's like,

1042
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:50,880
oh,

1043
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,713
this is dope.

1044
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,430
Because the night before I'm just saying,

1045
00:26:53,431 --> 00:26:53,640
hi,

1046
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,391
this shit sucks.

1047
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:54,721
I don't know.

1048
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:55,380
I listen to it tomorrow,

1049
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,531
you know,

1050
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:56,400
cause I've been in an hour,

1051
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,720
I've been in the studio for hours,

1052
00:26:57,721 --> 00:26:58,260
be too close,

1053
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,780
I'm by myself and I don't
have nobody to tell me like,

1054
00:27:00,781 --> 00:27:00,931
Yo,

1055
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:01,621
that shit was fresh.

1056
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,930
It's just like me and my own expertise.

1057
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:05,820
And just like right now
I think this is all shit,

1058
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,460
but I'll bounce it down and I'll
listen to it tomorrow and see.

1059
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,294
I feel,

1060
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,740
and almost every time I do that,

1061
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:11,670
if I bounce it down,

1062
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,540
it's like dope.

1063
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,240
And a lot of this shit could be
for someone else and not from me.

1064
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,980
Do you?

1065
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,400
It's a,

1066
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,630
it's the thing about music too,

1067
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:23,310
it seems like when there's a song
that I really like at any genre,

1068
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,930
it's like a really like it,

1069
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,300
I like it at first and then
I started really liking it.

1070
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:28,051
When I keep hearing it,

1071
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,010
I hear it a bunch of times.

1072
00:27:29,011 --> 00:27:31,410
Then as I'll hear it like
the fourth or fifth time,

1073
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,750
that's what I'll really get into it.

1074
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,410
Yeah.

1075
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,670
And it's interesting how music does that.

1076
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:36,504
Like there's,

1077
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,810
there's songs that you need
to hear a bunch of times.

1078
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,460
That's why people don't like new shit.

1079
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,410
Like if the rolling stones go on tour,

1080
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,510
like they better play
those fucking classics.

1081
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:45,830
Yeah.

1082
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,790
Nobody wants to hear some
weird shit even right.

1083
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,460
And Keith.

1084
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,293
Yeah.

1085
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,450
And that's good.

1086
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:50,970
I learned,

1087
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,930
I learned the hard way.

1088
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,793
You know,

1089
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,050
you go out and you do
Coachella and it's like,

1090
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:55,770
all right,

1091
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:57,690
I got fucking Coachella to do this.

1092
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,190
Come with the hits this,

1093
00:27:59,191 --> 00:27:59,851
give him this,

1094
00:27:59,851 --> 00:28:00,451
give him the joints.

1095
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:01,111
Didn't want to hear,

1096
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:01,351
you know,

1097
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:03,420
I'm not going to go out and
the Coachella and be like,

1098
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,081
all right guys,

1099
00:28:04,081 --> 00:28:08,580
so I know you guys know these songs
as they are produced on the album,

1100
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,350
but we're doing them all acoustic tonight.

1101
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:15,570
We know and I'm doing them
all in different keys so
they won't even be formatted

1102
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:16,404
how you remember them.

1103
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:18,030
But I promise you,

1104
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:22,820
you have me tonight on this stage for at
least an hour and a half my stroke and

1105
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,120
it's just the worst show ever,

1106
00:28:24,121 --> 00:28:24,580
you know?

1107
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:24,840
Yeah.

1108
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,090
When you'd go and do a new show,

1109
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,590
like if it's totally new thing,

1110
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:31,840
do you do are smaller clubs you
fuck around with like rock club?

1111
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,761
What were you talking about?

1112
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:33,130
Like,

1113
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,810
like if you're going to work like the
first time you're going to do a live

1114
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:37,600
perform,

1115
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,670
can any of you new stuff,

1116
00:28:38,671 --> 00:28:39,504
material,

1117
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,500
tour,

1118
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,040
tour.

1119
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,210
Because the tour is like,

1120
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,350
for me it's the fan club.

1121
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,401
You know,

1122
00:28:44,401 --> 00:28:48,240
I could go up there and fumble as many
times I want all night and my fans are

1123
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,074
just like,

1124
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,070
it's all good.

1125
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,080
This is the club house,

1126
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,053
right?

1127
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,580
This is where you're supposed to fuck up.

1128
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:55,170
You know when you go and do Coachella,

1129
00:28:55,171 --> 00:28:56,040
there's no time.

1130
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,930
There's no time to fuck up.

1131
00:28:57,931 --> 00:28:58,920
Everybody's watching.

1132
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,770
It's like the club houses we dick around.

1133
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:02,071
It's like,

1134
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,380
you know when a comment
goes to like the cop,

1135
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,220
the,

1136
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:05,640
the,

1137
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,480
the um,

1138
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,320
the club used to do standup at before he
blew up because he knows those are his

1139
00:29:10,321 --> 00:29:10,681
people,

1140
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:13,080
that he could be himself there
and you can try new jokes,

1141
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:13,920
you know,

1142
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,760
that's the same deal.

1143
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:16,680
Like that's how I approach tour.

1144
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,981
You know,

1145
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:18,990
I don't let press in
unless they buy a ticket.

1146
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,000
You want come to my show and
then fucking buy a ticket.

1147
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,580
Cause most of the time you give the
press their ticket in their writing and

1148
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:27,240
talking Shit said you giving motherfuckers
a free pass to come see your shelter.

1149
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:27,931
They can talk shit.

1150
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:28,231
It's like,

1151
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:28,801
no asshole.

1152
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:29,880
You want to talk shit about my show?

1153
00:29:29,881 --> 00:29:30,714
You're going to pay for it.

1154
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,313
People feel later,

1155
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,860
can't get any attention
unless they talk shit.

1156
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,281
That's a,

1157
00:29:35,281 --> 00:29:36,720
that's a big issue with folks.

1158
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:37,241
But it's like,

1159
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:37,350
uh,

1160
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:37,860
like,

1161
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,251
you know,

1162
00:29:38,251 --> 00:29:39,630
whatever the case may be.

1163
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,240
I'm gonna make you work
hard to get in there.

1164
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:46,420
So talk shit because it
is a fucking membership.

1165
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:49,990
It's like the only people I want on my
concert of people that really give a shit

1166
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:51,550
about what we're doing as artists,

1167
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:52,361
you know,

1168
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:52,621
and,

1169
00:29:52,621 --> 00:29:53,031
and,

1170
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:54,160
and you know,

1171
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,130
understand me as a human being,

1172
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:57,401
you know,

1173
00:29:57,401 --> 00:29:59,950
so let's say a very
psychedelic point of view.

1174
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,341
Yeah.

1175
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,750
I mean cause it is at the end of the day,

1176
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,070
like we were talking about before,

1177
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:04,180
it's all an experience,

1178
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:04,781
you know,

1179
00:30:04,781 --> 00:30:04,891
and,

1180
00:30:04,891 --> 00:30:08,590
and the show was even more so because
it's bringing the songs to life.

1181
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,731
Like I'm there,

1182
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:12,280
it's like a play for me theater.

1183
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,321
Like I'm out there,

1184
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:13,501
I'm,

1185
00:30:13,501 --> 00:30:13,770
I'm,

1186
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,121
I'm,

1187
00:30:14,121 --> 00:30:17,500
I'm the showman for tonight
and I'm taking you to a place,

1188
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,670
it's kind of like leave
your worries behind.

1189
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,981
Yeah.

1190
00:30:20,981 --> 00:30:21,630
It's like,

1191
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,020
I don't really want kids that,

1192
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:23,770
you know,

1193
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,760
the average hip hop show,

1194
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:28,650
it's like you see your favorite artists
come out at best performing the heads.

1195
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,381
They're almost there,

1196
00:30:29,381 --> 00:30:30,071
but you can't touch them.

1197
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:32,560
But it's just dope to know that
you're in the same building with them.

1198
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,760
And then that's the end of it.

1199
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,410
And that's just what you take is like,

1200
00:30:35,411 --> 00:30:35,591
man,

1201
00:30:35,591 --> 00:30:36,130
it was,

1202
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,060
we were in the nosebleeds,

1203
00:30:37,061 --> 00:30:37,960
but it was really nice.

1204
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:38,440
We was,

1205
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,950
you know,

1206
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,290
there tonight would that my
favorite rapper or whatever,

1207
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,300
this shit with me,

1208
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,340
it's more therapy.

1209
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,500
I'm confessing some things through song.

1210
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,423
You see me,

1211
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,090
you know,

1212
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,230
confess these things.

1213
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,870
You could see the emotion
as I'm performing,

1214
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:53,681
you know?

1215
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:56,260
And then there's kids out there that are
connecting with it in such a way where

1216
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:56,501
it's like,

1217
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:56,980
man,

1218
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,330
I already connect with this dude.

1219
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:02,080
But he's performing it in such a
way where he means it even more.

1220
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,920
He's singing it in a way where he
means even more in this environment.

1221
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,311
You know?

1222
00:31:06,311 --> 00:31:07,144
It's like,

1223
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,680
it's a different experience.

1224
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:11,260
And I love giving people that experience.

1225
00:31:11,261 --> 00:31:11,531
You know,

1226
00:31:11,531 --> 00:31:14,530
I love connecting with
them in a way where,

1227
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:15,010
you know,

1228
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,880
everybody at that concert is paying
attention and they're there because they,

1229
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,330
they,

1230
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,070
they want to experience something.

1231
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:23,200
Okay.
