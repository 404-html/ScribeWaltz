1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:00,481
Back Up,

2
00:00:00,481 --> 00:00:01,314
ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,120
Powerful Frankie the answer.

4
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:03,440
Edgar.

5
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:03,820
Thank you.

6
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:05,550
Who's got more heart
than this motherfucker?

7
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,630
How about nobody ever?

8
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:07,740
I mean,

9
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,210
you might have as much heart as him,

10
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:13,350
but that's all that's available as a
human is how it's all it's available.

11
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,420
There's no room for anything
else that you can get to the top.

12
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,171
If you get to the top.

13
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:17,310
He got Frankie Edgar Heart,

14
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,040
but you don't ever get to
more than Frankie Edgar Heart.

15
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,630
That level doesn't exist on the game,

16
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,410
but you Ryan favor man,

17
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,071
you ride favors.

18
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:28,770
Got Some fucking mad hard
to dude that Aldo fight.

19
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,250
That guy took bombs from all the leg
kick after leg kick after leg kick,

20
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:35,281
boom,

21
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:35,641
boom,

22
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,360
boom.

23
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,700
Made it five rounds after it's over.

24
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:42,570
His leg swells up like more than
twice the size of the other leg.

25
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,640
He took all these Twitter photos.

26
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:44,760
Yeah,

27
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,750
it was terrifying.

28
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,583
Man

29
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,480
is a Gamer too.

30
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,020
Everybody who trains with
them says he's better in the,

31
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,900
in the cage and he is in training.

32
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:55,201
Uh,

33
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,034
he's getting this fuck.

34
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,680
He's gaming as fuck
and he's an animal man.

35
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,450
We ride favors and animal.

36
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,180
But I was so impressed
with Frankie against cub.

37
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:03,991
I was like,

38
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:05,010
Jesus Christ,

39
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:06,300
he's so relentless.

40
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:07,321
I mean,

41
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:09,560
he would not stop,

42
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,480
just wouldn't stop and you could see cub,

43
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,400
but there was a certain point in
the fight where he was just like,

44
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,570
fuck.

45
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:16,111
Like,

46
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:18,030
what is this guy made out of?

47
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,770
He just doesn't get tired.

48
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,971
It doesn't get tired.

49
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,840
Cardio for days.

50
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,750
Nobody works harder and unstoppable heart.

51
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,680
Yeah.

52
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
You watched those gray Maynard fights.

53
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,020
Did he get hit with balls
of the best fights ever?

54
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:31,950
Oh my God.

55
00:01:31,951 --> 00:01:34,340
The two first rounds of the,

56
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:34,900
uh,

57
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,300
the two second fights,

58
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,780
the first fight was a loss,

59
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,081
you know,

60
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,390
so it was like he lost a decision,

61
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,800
but that was like early,

62
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,210
early back in the day.

63
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,130
But the second two fights,

64
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:47,430
man,

65
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,470
we're just fucking wars.

66
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,030
They were so crazy.

67
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,411
Right.

68
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:52,880
That's what they,

69
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,551
they fought three times,

70
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:53,850
right?

71
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:54,130
Yeah.

72
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:54,510
Mainers.

73
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,920
There've been the same right after those.

74
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,843
No.

75
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:57,661
Yeah,

76
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:57,960
he's,

77
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,141
well,

78
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,630
he's definitely taken
some serious punishment.

79
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,340
He got stopped in his last fight,

80
00:02:02,341 --> 00:02:03,174
right?

81
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,633
Yes.

82
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,733
Who stopped him?

83
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,161
Oh,

84
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:10,170
who do you mean your fight?

85
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,233
I'll pull it up.

86
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,900
This is a smart move by the UFC because
Frankie was just kind of chilling,

87
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,050
sitting on the shelf until Al Mcgregor.

88
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,520
Now he's got to fight to keep
them fresh while it's good too,

89
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,330
because it's not even in the
weight class that exists.

90
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,220
Normally competes.

91
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:26,460
Yeah.

92
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,320
So it's kind of,

93
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,141
or what happens?

94
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,760
He still has that fight available.

95
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,290
[inaudible] well,

96
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:33,210
they offered him a fight
against Tj and he's like,

97
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:33,720
nope,

98
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,580
not happening dude.

99
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,300
He says he's open for it though.

100
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,380
Is He?

101
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,280
But he didn't take it.

102
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:41,520
That's a tough match cause he's
not faster than Tj for sure.

103
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,650
How was he open to it
if he didn't take it?

104
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,290
He did an interview saying he's
not shutting the door on it.

105
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:47,550
Like he's open to it after this.

106
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,120
But he said,

107
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:48,241
oh,

108
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:52,110
after this he said no to
a title fight at the time.

109
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,650
Yeah.

110
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,120
But I guess he said he's open to it.

111
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:55,230
That's what I read in an interview.

112
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,070
I'm going to happen.

113
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,271
I wonder what happened.

114
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:57,870
What changed?

115
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:01,300
So Alexander Yakka view is the,

116
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:01,481
uh,

117
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,860
the guy that,

118
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,310
uh,

119
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,560
be stopped him and stopped
him in his last fight.

120
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,520
That it's tough to watch.

121
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,800
Ross Pearson stopped him before that.

122
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:09,791
Okay.

123
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,960
Actually it looks like it was
decision Yaka Yaka view is a decision.

124
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,130
Bras Pearson stopped him.

125
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:15,580
Sorry.

126
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:15,701
Oh,

127
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:16,780
that was in the second round.

128
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,370
Nate Diaz stopped him in the first round.

129
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,990
The Nate Diaz one was bad.

130
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,760
And at Tj Maxx one is the cage.

131
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,181
Yeah,

132
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:24,040
the TJ grant one was bad to elbow.

133
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
Yeah.

134
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,200
So he lost badly twice in a row.

135
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,700
T J K Odom and the first round
Nate k in the first round,

136
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,730
then Ross Pearson,

137
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,060
Klm and the second amount,

138
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:38,890
so three ferocious knockout
losses in a row to gray Maynard.

139
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,611
It's tough to see.

140
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,000
Right.

141
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,750
And then he law.

142
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:40,901
Yeah,

143
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:41,260
it's very,

144
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,220
he's a nice guy too.

145
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,120
I really like gray.

146
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,860
And then the F,

147
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,070
this is the last fight he lost by
decision to a guy that you know,

148
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:49,090
we never heard of before.

149
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,163
And uh,

150
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:50,920
he's,

151
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,400
I mean,

152
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,780
not that the guy wasn't a good fighter,

153
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,614
I'm sure,

154
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,460
but me,

155
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,380
you think about he was
fighting for the title,

156
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,790
fought for the title twice,

157
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,650
went to a draw with Frankie.

158
00:03:59,760 --> 00:03:59,981
I mean,

159
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,270
they had incredible,

160
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,104
incredible fight.

161
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,960
But then the battery got drained,

162
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:05,794
man.

163
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,233
Okay.

164
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,180
Lights cold black.

165
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,800
Frankie Edgar's about to step out.

166
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:12,870
Okay.

167
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,703
Oh Shit.

168
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,603
Here we go.

169
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,733
Biggie,

170
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,993
boom,

171
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,800
boom,

172
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,210
boom,

173
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:18,540
boom,

174
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,920
boom,

175
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,200
boom,

176
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,680
boom.

177
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,840
Every comes charging.

178
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,750
Ryan Getting Ready.

179
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,460
His coach behind a man,

180
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:30,300
Mark Henry is a fucking ridiculous coach.

181
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,171
Good,

182
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:31,740
Huh?

183
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,573
Dude lit.

184
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,750
It's tough to hear it,

185
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,490
but you can hear him yelling out.

186
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:37,320
They switch up their signals every time.

187
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,050
They have a whole language for each camp.

188
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,700
Front combinations.

189
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,571
You'll see.

190
00:04:42,571 --> 00:04:46,530
I'll nervous the coaches and he's sweating
profusely because he's yelling out

191
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,080
was in Frankie listens
like a fucking video game.

192
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,800
It's insane.

193
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,340
Wow.

194
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,173
That's cool.

195
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,280
For wins by knock off four by submission.

196
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:54,360
Three fight win streak.

197
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,710
V Bj Penn three times
Jesus fucking Christ.

198
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,440
Did he beat Bj Penn three times?

199
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,550
How crazy is that?

200
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,280
And the last one was just a demolition.

201
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,970
The last one was hard to watch.

202
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,970
Remember his fights with the Hendo?

203
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:09,930
Yeah,

204
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:10,591
those were good too,

205
00:05:10,591 --> 00:05:10,831
man.

206
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:11,580
They were great.

207
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,030
Yeah,

208
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,250
and he's so undersized
compared to Henderson.

209
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,650
I mean Benson's a big one.

210
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:19,920
55 are and Frankie makes
one 45 pretty easy.

211
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,550
I like Benson at one 70 man.

212
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:24,750
He looked great against Dash.

213
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,350
I agree.

214
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:27,030
And I love how he's willing
to fight other people.

215
00:05:27,031 --> 00:05:27,510
He's like,

216
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,990
you know,

217
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,751
I'll fight anybody.

218
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:30,360
What we was trying to fight Tyron Woodley,

219
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:34,080
he was calling Woodlea by well at least
trying to get that Johnny Hendricks

220
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:34,550
fight.

221
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,383
Hmm.

222
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,271
Yeah.

223
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,500
It's very interesting man.

224
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:43,430
Very interesting and no,

225
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,111
don't have a fight,

226
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:44,944
right?

227
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,420
I don't think he's thing right now
whenever say you say Hindo though.

228
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:50,254
I think Dan,

229
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,480
my bat confuse the shit out of me.

230
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,310
So there we go.

231
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,990
Number two and number three.

232
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,130
Well three at Bantam,

233
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,153
Uriah

234
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,630
and number two at featherweight.

235
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:00,201
Frankie,

236
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:05,201
the motherfucking answer Edgar reach
is about the same and the same height.

237
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,383
Yep.

238
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,831
Super Five.

239
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:09,650
Anything else?

240
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,390
Virtually identical.

241
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,450
It's crazy that he's 36 cause to me I
was 36 and Uriah Faber when I was working

242
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:17,661
for the UFC,

243
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:22,010
he was like the kid that was
2123 and now and even 36 pack.

244
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:26,870
Then you were like 30 when when you
were working for the key and the cage.

245
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,210
Now I'm talking about
when I worked for the UFC,

246
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,270
always worked for the UFC five 36 saw
when you first saw him fight those king of

247
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:34,701
the cage.

248
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:35,180
Right.

249
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,830
Cause I remember you were
telling me about him.

250
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,940
He bought in the WEC Hosanna what it was.

251
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,170
He found king in the cage too.

252
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:41,990
Did he?

253
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,380
Yeah.

254
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:42,531
Yeah.

255
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,060
He can king of the cage once.

256
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,570
Yeah.

257
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,700
And then he went to WC and that's right.

258
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,620
I am so curious about this fight.

259
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,320
He fought and Abu Dhabi has a blue belt.

260
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,310
He wrestled his whole life,

261
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,230
but he was a blue belt when he fought uh,

262
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,170
uh,

263
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:57,650
battling bean from American top team.

264
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,040
That was the first time I saw him.

265
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,441
Powerful.

266
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:02,660
Justin Buchholz shout out.

267
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,460
Yeah,

268
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,293
he's right there.

269
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,163
Yeah.

270
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,720
I'm really curious to
see how this plays out.

271
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,920
Predictions.

272
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,760
Frankie decision,

273
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:12,040
right.

274
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,180
All the way from three.

275
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,051
You guys bet on it.

276
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:15,771
Double or not.

277
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:16,604
Then

278
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,570
it's going to have to double on you.

279
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,100
We have APP to get you later.

280
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,570
Yeah.

281
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:24,170
We have to get half of it,

282
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:24,831
bro.

283
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,040
You're night having a half later.

284
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,253
They're not getting that.

285
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,580
You think?

286
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,990
I think Frankie wins three to two.

287
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,130
That would suck.

288
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,011
Let me close by.

289
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:33,530
Imagine the means if you lose.

290
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,020
Oh I know I'm gonna go.

291
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,920
It's gonna be tough to beat
that Bruce Jenner one though.

292
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,263
So

293
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,271
it was pretty,

294
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:46,090
God damn funny is I Instagram
15 seconds of that interview.

295
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,780
The part where she
asked him if he was gay,

296
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,793
are you gay?

297
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,760
Cause please know I'm not gay.

298
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,490
So that was hysterical.

299
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:56,840
So is the vocal,

300
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,320
he's like,

301
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,890
his eyes are fluttering and twitching
all these Panama hives and he's like,

302
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,431
no.

303
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:02,264
I'm like,

304
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,960
I only,

305
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,980
I've only been with women even
though it was so believable.

306
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,480
Would have something like that.

307
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:12,590
Like if you're transgender,

308
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:16,430
they immediately ignore all the other
ridiculous aspects of your behavior.

309
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,780
Like the fact that you fucking killed
somebody a couple of weeks ago by pushing

310
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:24,530
their fucking car in oncoming traffic
in a Humvee weren't paying attention.

311
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,310
Yeah.

312
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,310
I mean that some talks about poor
lady and they said he was dialed.

313
00:08:31,971 --> 00:08:32,151
No,

314
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:32,781
he wasn't texting.

315
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,370
Sure wasn't paying attention though.

316
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,790
He wasn't paying attention
when he's driving.

317
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,940
Was it after or before?

318
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,900
Was before.

319
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,890
Before he came out.

320
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,080
Maybe this is just a big distraction.

321
00:08:42,081 --> 00:08:42,201
No,

322
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:42,351
no.

323
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:43,640
He was already transitioning.

324
00:08:43,641 --> 00:08:45,140
He's been taking hormones forever.

325
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,493
Here it goes.

326
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,540
But if it's also the fact that he's living
with attention whores his whole life,

327
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,120
I mean it's like he lives
in a ridiculous household.

328
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,060
I mean all these things come into account,

329
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,110
but he was the greatest
athlete of all time.

330
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:58,381
No,

331
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:58,531
no,

332
00:08:58,531 --> 00:08:59,364
he's definitely,

333
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,310
no,

334
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,490
no,

335
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:00,780
no,

336
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:00,951
no,

337
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,650
no.

338
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,483
When you win,

339
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,520
when you win the gold
medal in the decathlon,

340
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,120
you know why you are no real
athletes were competing in that shit.

341
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,954
Go.

342
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,770
Is that the point?

343
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:13,420
Michael Jordan was not in
the fucking decathlon too.

344
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
Any black guys compete?

345
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,510
Kathlen okay,

346
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:15,931
here we go.

347
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:16,351
Here we go.

348
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:18,780
Here he was the greatest shut up.

349
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,021
Okay.

350
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:21,090
How's this play out inside leg kick by?

351
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,120
By Friday you got hit in the sack.

352
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:24,630
Come on,

353
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,463
come on.

354
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,041
Oh,

355
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:26,970
that would be nice,

356
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:27,660
I think.

357
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,151
I think you're right.

358
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,280
It has the power advantage.

359
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:29,840
Would you agree?

360
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,490
A hundred so Eddie,

361
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:32,730
you're,

362
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,120
you're,

363
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,571
you're free.

364
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:34,171
You're right here,

365
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,800
right?

366
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,430
You know what?

367
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,263
You taking your Ryan,

368
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,323
I,

369
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,420
I forget the Bat.

370
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,030
Who's the bet?

371
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,863
Ooh,

372
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,280
I got your eye on this one.

373
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,350
This is the bed double or nothing.

374
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,280
Eddie Bravo has your,

375
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,210
I got Frankie.

376
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,790
I can't believe you made them take
your ride a double or nothing.

377
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,300
Even though you were,

378
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:52,530
you were very strong coming into this.

379
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,730
Is it me or does Frankie Edgar's like
way bigger than your Rocky's big?

380
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,810
Well there's the same height.

381
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,341
It looks bigger.

382
00:09:59,341 --> 00:10:00,870
I think your eyelids thicker.

383
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,171
Yeah,

384
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:02,004
he's thick.

385
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,810
I guess it's the camera angle.

386
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,250
It's also way Tanner.

387
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,880
It's interesting like they're moving
like this is a five round fight.

388
00:10:08,881 --> 00:10:12,390
Like Frankie's like nice and paste slowly.

389
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,170
Lot a lot of footwork and movement
but nothing crazy as far as output.

390
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,900
It's going to be a really close fight man.

391
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,170
It's interesting seeing fracking
not have a speed advantage.

392
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:26,530
No,

393
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:27,363
I agree.

394
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,020
The rice fastest fuck man.

395
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,680
And then one 45 you know he's used
to fighting those one 30 fibers.

396
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,680
I W I think I like the fact that
it doesn't have to cut as much.

397
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:40,681
Wait for this fight to again at 36
it's probably he goes hard and smart.

398
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:41,501
Like I said,

399
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:42,080
I think you're right.

400
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,700
Has a power advantage in that he comes
off of weigh ins and has a picnic on the

401
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,260
ground like immediately does.

402
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:47,771
It does.

403
00:10:47,771 --> 00:10:48,040
Yeah.

404
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:51,640
He's soup eating salmon off
the fucking spinning back.

405
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:56,641
Kick [inaudible] tell you what your
eyes are smart as far as business wise.

406
00:10:57,371 --> 00:10:58,121
It goes there.

407
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:58,954
He's smart guy.

408
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,560
Yeah.

409
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,020
Well he owns a ton of businesses.

410
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:04,880
Chino in Sacramento in cars homes.

411
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,070
He's got a casino.

412
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,270
You have like part of a casino.

413
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,140
He torque.

414
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:08,710
He sold.

415
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,630
He sold a other companies.

416
00:11:10,631 --> 00:11:11,464
A case Swiss.

417
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:11,651
Hey,

418
00:11:11,651 --> 00:11:12,520
tell you what man.

419
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,100
Torque is a fucking great company.

420
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:16,630
They make really good gloves,

421
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:17,380
man.

422
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,620
There their boxing gloves or
my favorite boxing gloves ever.

423
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,730
Really for working out.

424
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,830
They made fight catch.

425
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:22,961
No,

426
00:11:22,961 --> 00:11:23,794
they made shirts.

427
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,460
Dude,

428
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,930
when next time you over my place,

429
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,580
I'll give you a pair of gloves.

430
00:11:27,581 --> 00:11:29,950
He gave me a few parents and
they're really fucking good man.

431
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:31,210
They're super comfortable.

432
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,810
Like they're the most comfortable
a bad gloves I've ever used him.

433
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,820
Okay.

434
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,900
Then you guys just always
connected with the right people.

435
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:39,530

436
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:39,771

438
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:41,391
They,

439
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:43,460
they make outstanding equipment.

440
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,481
They were great.

441
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:45,141
Hand wraps,

442
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:45,381
great.

443
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:46,970
Everything his other company was for.

444
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,230
Oh,

445
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,093
that didn't land

446
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,790
as Duane Ludwig working
with him for this fight.

447
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,040
You're I in Dwayne.

448
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:54,874
Don't see to,

449
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,880
these weren't wearing masks and Martin.

450
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,750
Ooh,

451
00:11:58,750 --> 00:11:59,920
rank you with the take down.

452
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,340
If this is going to be a long fight,

453
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,560
it's going to be close.

454
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,560
This one's going down.

455
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
The judges that he,

456
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,791
this is going to judge.

457
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,010
You better not fuck me.

458
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,040
I swear to God,

459
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:12,730
man.

460
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,750
I'm going to freak out.

461
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,843
Freak out.

462
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,773
They're just me.

463
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,670
Just memes and $1,800.

464
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,191
It's weird.

465
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:28,070
You see these like these
logos all over people.

466
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,930
Shorts is the last time
you going to see this.

467
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,800
They got another month of
this going to mess them.

468
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,323
Me Too.

469
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,550
Some companies are like high Bussa man.

470
00:12:37,551 --> 00:12:39,200
I mean they've been around
a long ass fucking time.

471
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,520
They're all just going
to go to Bella Torque,

472
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:40,881
right?

473
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,650
Don't you think they want
to be in this business?

474
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:43,740
This should go over to bell toy.

475
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:47,390
I mean they're already there and Bella
[inaudible] it's just not anybody watched

476
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,680
Beltre last night I did.

477
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,450
Who won the Kendall girl fight.

478
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,493
Kendall loss.

479
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,550
He got beat up man.

480
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,870
Bay To do,

481
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:54,610
didn't meet Wade.

482
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,400
Right.

483
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:55,811
So the,

484
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:57,050
the stripped him of his title.

485
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,740
Kendell got finished
yet round third round.

486
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,693
Wow.

487
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,570
Was it a five or four still
cy fourth round by round.

488
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,001
Five rounder.

489
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:05,834
Yeah.

490
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,110
Can he just kept taking
Kendall down over and over?

491
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,431
He's a big fucker.

492
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:11,780
I heard he's muscular.

493
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,050
He get ate up in the UFC though.

494
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,711
Good low,

495
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,260
good Frankie going high with the kicks.

496
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,870
I was really rooting for Kendall.

497
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,460
He's a good dude.

498
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,353
Great Guy.

499
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,830
Great dark jokes.

500
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:26,903
Yeah,

501
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,580
he's been around a long time.

502
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,473
Really has,

503
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,580
he had a lot more experience
than that guide foot.

504
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,700
I was super Antwon when,

505
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,720
whenever glories on,

506
00:13:36,721 --> 00:13:37,411
on spike up.

507
00:13:37,411 --> 00:13:38,710
Super into Oh yeah.

508
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,900
You see those heavyweights?

509
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:40,690
Paul?

510
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,090
I'm a big fan of Laura Dude.

511
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,530
Gloria's it shit.

512
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,453
I don't miss them.

513
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,773
Okay.

514
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,251
Yeah.

515
00:13:50,251 --> 00:13:52,770
Niki holes can just one of my
favorite fighters for sure.

516
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,113
In any sport.

517
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:55,870
Yeah.

518
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,790
You fall on that last one,

519
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:57,180
right?

520
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,241
Oh,

521
00:13:57,241 --> 00:14:00,360
did you see the arts 11 Simon
Marcus fight went to a draw.

522
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,520
That's fucking amazing career.

523
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:02,880
Uh,

524
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,120
do you see those heavyweights?

525
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:04,740
No.

526
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,700
There's no girl in glory,

527
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,280
but there's no famous girl fights.

528
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,490
More time Ronda Rousey kickboxing.

529
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,640
It would be cyborg seeing it.

530
00:14:13,641 --> 00:14:14,940
Dom beat Cyborg.

531
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,730
Who's that?

532
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,563
Italian client.

533
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,000
Tiffany time bomb.

534
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,140
She's a beast man.

535
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,153
Tiffany time.

536
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:20,650
Yeah.

537
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:21,840
Know her last name but she's,

538
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,000
she's easy on the eyes and she,

539
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:25,080
she's a beast.

540
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:25,471
Yeah.

541
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:27,290
There's some pretty girls
that fight Moyie Thai,

542
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,680
but it's um,

543
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,430
it just doesn't have the eyes that
grappling that Gnarly's up your face.

544
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,390
I'm curious to think.

545
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,530
Elbows and the arms.

546
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:35,520
So good for him either.

547
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,490
Yeah.

548
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,360
Moitai true.

549
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,150
I'm curious just to see,

550
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,040
to hear your critique of Kathy long
striking and how she moves and all that.

551
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,690
Cause I never really paid attention.

552
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:45,841
Oh,

553
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:46,770
she's bad ass.

554
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,820
She's very high light rail
man like maybe a year ago.

555
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,880
And I work with her.

556
00:14:51,881 --> 00:14:52,080
We,

557
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,970
we train at the same gym,

558
00:14:52,971 --> 00:14:55,790
but I just never followed
women's kickboxing.

559
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:56,870
I knew she was famous.

560
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,520
I just never seen any of her matches.

561
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:00,260
And One night I put on a highlight reel.

562
00:15:00,261 --> 00:15:00,951
Kathy law,

563
00:15:00,951 --> 00:15:01,660
I'm on familiar.

564
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,110
Holy Fuck Dude.

565
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,973
Pull by law.

566
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,770
She was Kathy Long,

567
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,250
Howard's role dynamic and just
so full of fire chief from walks,

568
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,700
whoring walks or sheriffs
like she comes out.

569
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,843
Ah,

570
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,290
fucking on fire.

571
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,210
She got mad at that round two.

572
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,351
So,

573
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:18,550
uh,

574
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,520
who won the first round?

575
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,623
Frankie,

576
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,520
you think so?

577
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:21,970
Yeah.

578
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,120
Down that takedown.

579
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,600
He was barely a take down.

580
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,630
Buddy can kick to the
body when it's this close.

581
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:28,820
Those takedowns and cage
presence and the pressure.

582
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,620
When's your rounds?

583
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,211
Oh Frankie.

584
00:15:30,211 --> 00:15:31,070
Right the knee.

585
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,150
Oh,

586
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,540
your wire.

587
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,373
Rather with a knee.

588
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,530
You ride with a kick to the body and
you ride with a kick to the knee.

589
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,550
I think I said Frankie.

590
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,050
Frankie barely won that.

591
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:41,100
First of all in favor.

592
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:44,291
Yeah.

593
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:47,320
If you're Ryan can make this
more of a kicking contest.

594
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,600
That's not like Frankie strong suit.

595
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,261
Oh,

596
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:50,831
but look at that.

597
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:51,970
Frankie throws a spinning back.

598
00:15:51,971 --> 00:15:52,720
Pays for it though.

599
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,021
Oh,

600
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,854
we got out of it.

601
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,910
Goddamn is quick.

602
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,721
It's nose is bleeding.

603
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:57,310
I think it's always bleeding.

604
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,220
If he sneezes and starts bleeding,

605
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,790
that's like me,

606
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,623
man.

607
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,230
Wow.

608
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:03,790
It's just normal.

609
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,361
You know,

610
00:16:04,361 --> 00:16:06,250
you get punched in the face all the time.

611
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,650
Mine just dry enough to add no surgery.

612
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,240
I blow my nose blood everywhere.

613
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,790
When you had a nurse,

614
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,481
no surgery,

615
00:16:13,481 --> 00:16:14,201
and you had your,

616
00:16:14,201 --> 00:16:14,291
uh,

617
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:15,310
your pipes opened up,

618
00:16:15,311 --> 00:16:17,770
did you blow some insane
boogers out of that?

619
00:16:17,771 --> 00:16:18,730
That was awesome.

620
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,421
Oh my God.

621
00:16:19,421 --> 00:16:20,980
I felt the best thing in the world.

622
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:23,080
I took photos of them and
I put them on Instagram.

623
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,980
I almost made Thompson Mura throw up
and sounds terrible in the airport.

624
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,873
Oh,

625
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,261
it wasn't Instagram.

626
00:16:29,261 --> 00:16:31,540
I don't think back then it was Twitter,

627
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,660
but I almost made whoa
head kicked by Frankie.

628
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,220
I almost made Thompson gonna throw up,

629
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,060
so I showed it to him.

630
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,483
Anyway,

631
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,540
that's a new Frankie Edgar man.

632
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,760
He's still in some
serious a kung fu kicks.

633
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:43,601
Yeah,

634
00:16:43,601 --> 00:16:44,530
he's throwing some cakes.

635
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,533
I like that.

636
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,820
That's that Mark Henry and Phil nurse,

637
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:49,330
man.

638
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:51,550
I would blow some boogers that
were bigger than a quarter.

639
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,391
Like I couldn't,

640
00:16:52,391 --> 00:16:53,510
didn't sell big data.

641
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,483
It's crazy ones.

642
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,690
And they were bloody and it
was like aliens when they,

643
00:16:58,691 --> 00:17:01,060
when they took the
things out of your nose.

644
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:01,301
Right.

645
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:02,140
Like how many stitches?

646
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:03,490
It's the best feeling in the world.

647
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,731
Yeah.

648
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,690
Because I had plastic splints in
there for like two little stitches.

649
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,010
It made my nose wider than
the actual space open.

650
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:12,970
The dude who did it,

651
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,110
he was a wizard.

652
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,100
He retired,

653
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,390
but he knew his shit.

654
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,740
He cut out all the tr,

655
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,740
I think they're called turbinates
the inside of like the,

656
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,580
the bump,

657
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:22,420
the bone bump,

658
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,540
cut those down and then like cut out all
the scar tissue at a ton of scar tissue

659
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,190
and put these fucking tubes in there.

660
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,240
And then splints,

661
00:17:31,241 --> 00:17:32,170
he's plastic splints.

662
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:33,760
The stitch it up and when it was over,

663
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,110
like my nose is wider,

664
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,490
like all this shit.

665
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:38,600
Like he like opened it up like nine,

666
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,610
change the shape.

667
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:40,620
You break that down.

668
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,620
Oh my God.

669
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:42,490
It's amazing.

670
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:43,930
My doctor sucked.

671
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,120
I don't breathe.

672
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,780
Great man.

673
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,250
Well you still get punched in the face.

674
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,160
I haven't been in the face tat much since

675
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,993
the surgery.

676
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,013
Uh,

677
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,850
the trash brown upper cut didn't help.

678
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,230
That's life though,

679
00:17:59,130 --> 00:17:59,431
Dude.

680
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:00,420
For most of my life.

681
00:18:00,421 --> 00:18:01,254
I couldn't breathe out of my nose.

682
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,411
Oh,

683
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:01,741
Frankie.

684
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,490
With an overhand right.

685
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,323
That was very nice.

686
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:03,780
Yeah.

687
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,280
What you call a mouth breather.

688
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,193
Look at this.

689
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,011
You get that?

690
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:08,180
Say,

691
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:08,300
hey,

692
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,133
that's a nose,

693
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,380
I'm jealous right now.

694
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,480
Have to honk on your belly.

695
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,260
Breathing efficient.

696
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,530
I love it.

697
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,880
I'm so happy with the surgery.

698
00:18:17,881 --> 00:18:20,700
I didn't even bother that much and
I got two nostrils that are totally

699
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:21,534
different.

700
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,870
They're all fucked up inside.

701
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,950
You like the ones really like
the sliver and one's a whole.

702
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:26,281
Yeah,

703
00:18:26,281 --> 00:18:31,230
I had three quarters blockage on one side
and almost a hundred percent blockage

704
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:31,950
on the other side.

705
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,220
Yeah,

706
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,850
my nose was useless at
a quarter of a nostril.

707
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,713
And that's it.

708
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,120
You don't having where they,

709
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,060
where they go in with the drill and just
kinda get it out of like all the shit.

710
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:42,720
Cause I used to,

711
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,170
I used to not addicted,

712
00:18:44,171 --> 00:18:45,330
but I'd use it every damn day.

713
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:45,900
Sprint.

714
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,201
Yes.

715
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:49,900
I'd use African like clogged everything
man was addicted to that shit too.

716
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,753
You know?

717
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,430
I'll just do it every loosens you up.

718
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,920
Joey Diaz is addicted to it.

719
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,720
He was joking around about it on stage.

720
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,680
It's horrible for a man.

721
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,450
It's like when I did coke
I can fucking breathe.

722
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:01,284
Perfect.

723
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,110
It was,

724
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,740
now I'm addicted is fucking Afrin.

725
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:05,843
Can't breathe.

726
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,181
Yeah.

727
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:10,050
That African stuff,

728
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,590
I don't know.

729
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,430
I'm going to stand up.

730
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:16,740
Makes the veins smaller so then you
nose doesn't work as efficiently.

731
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,011
Yeah.

732
00:19:17,011 --> 00:19:18,540
When you get addicted to it,

733
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,530
when you don't have it,

734
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,560
it literally will make
your nose the inside of it.

735
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:22,210
Swell.

736
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:22,650
Yup.

737
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,790
It's just so crazy.

738
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:24,760
So I had to go in,

739
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,750
they had like this little
drill and just caved out.

740
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,500
Polls.

741
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,040
Oh yeah,

742
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,160
like co quarter,

743
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:30,390
right,

744
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,680
where they taught cauterized.

745
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,040
Yes.

746
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,873
That's what they were doing.

747
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,841
It was nice.

748
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:34,530
Did it help?

749
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,070
Helia and then he got
punched in the nose again.

750
00:19:38,071 --> 00:19:38,970
Back to square one.

751
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:40,223
Fuck.

752
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,650
So many fighters talk with
like nasal Uriah talks,

753
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,100
nasal.

754
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,840
Do I sound nasally a little bit.

755
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,550
I can't stand when I listen to myself.

756
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:49,710
Talk to see who's the most nasally.

757
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,260
Vandelay was used to be,

758
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:55,470
but then he changed his
nose to mean van got a good,

759
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:56,500
a nice soft side.

760
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,480
You got a good family.

761
00:19:57,481 --> 00:20:00,350
So it's like face off Nicolas cage style.

762
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,170
You will see,

763
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,970
it's like a little article.

764
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,410
That is how he sounds.

765
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,930
I supposed to do a podcast
with him hitting nine full,

766
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,350
showed up two hours late.

767
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:15,743
Two hours late.

768
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,010
It's very good.

769
00:20:17,011 --> 00:20:18,000
Got To food.

770
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,310
He was two hours late and left.

771
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
Really sent me text.

772
00:20:21,741 --> 00:20:22,574
Sorry.

773
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,633
Cool man.

774
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,503
Okay,

775
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,261
thanks bro.

776
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:25,970
Is this,

777
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,340
oh,

778
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,300
that vendor,

779
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:28,134
they Silva.

780
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,100
He was late to two hours to wise to what?

781
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,300
Applying pursuit in Brazil.

782
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,670
My friend in Brazil,

783
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:36,810
there's is no time.

784
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:38,491
Nah.

785
00:20:38,491 --> 00:20:38,941
For real though.

786
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:40,110
He changed his entire face.

787
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:40,950
Face off style.

788
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,510
I'm thinking about doing that.

789
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,310
I wouldn't mind a new
microscopic Kathy long.

790
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,000
Who?

791
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,050
The highlight reel.

792
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:46,680
Yeah,

793
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,261
check out.

794
00:20:47,261 --> 00:20:47,400
Wait,

795
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,300
is she old school?

796
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,463
Oh yeah.

797
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,550
I'm talking about right now.

798
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:51,791
No,

799
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:51,941
no,

800
00:20:51,941 --> 00:20:52,121
no,

801
00:20:52,121 --> 00:20:55,360
but she actually is 50 years
old and wants to fight.

802
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:56,051
She's in great shape.

803
00:20:56,051 --> 00:20:56,884
She looks good.

804
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,970
She's in great shape still,

805
00:20:57,971 --> 00:20:58,804
man.

806
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,540
She's the best female
fighter I've ever seen.

807
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:02,410
Says Chuck Norris.

808
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,880
Chuck cut through all this shit and you
had some actual fighting holds black

809
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,170
belts in three styles.

810
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,540
Her and Brian Cowen and she'd
always have her hair up.

811
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,190
She is bad ass though.

812
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,093
Ooh,

813
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:13,841
look at that girl.

814
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:14,730
She's fighting.

815
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,730
It looked like my mom.

816
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,340
Okay,

817
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,660
boom bitch.

818
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,990
There's some high level shit.

819
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,910
This is like in the eighties dude.

820
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,271
Yeah,

821
00:21:30,271 --> 00:21:31,440
it was a PKA karate days.

822
00:21:31,441 --> 00:21:31,681
Okay,

823
00:21:31,681 --> 00:21:32,514
here we go.

824
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,233
Polls.

825
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:35,820
Come on.

826
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,653
Don't show me that.

827
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,011
Her fights,

828
00:21:38,011 --> 00:21:38,311
man.

829
00:21:38,311 --> 00:21:38,940
She's good.

830
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,390
My mom,

831
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,110
my mom,

832
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,580
my mom would fuck her up.

833
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:43,763
Come on.

834
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,950
Put some on her son.

835
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:48,690
It's so funny.

836
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,233
His fight as good,

837
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,920
super close man.

838
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:54,000
These fucking ground,

839
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:55,950
but I did not cost me 18 hundo.

840
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,950
You imagine Uriah pulls it off
if he wins the next three rounds.

841
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,460
Well that is tough.

842
00:22:05,461 --> 00:22:06,870
That last round is a toss up,

843
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:07,704
right?

844
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,020
Well if Uriah wins three out of five,

845
00:22:10,021 --> 00:22:10,854
that's all he has to do.

846
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,550
That's what I think.

847
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,260
Slow three.

848
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,653
Oh,

849
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,470
who the fuck knows man?

850
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:18,030
Who the fuck knows there and around three?

851
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:22,641
Yeah.

852
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:24,140
Edgar is probably going
to get the decision.

853
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:26,540
This is a weird fight for Frankie to man,

854
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:26,841
right?

855
00:22:26,841 --> 00:22:31,841
You can see rise not even ranked at one
45 he comes back to one 45 navy beats

856
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:32,230
Edgar.

857
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,530
He's right in the mix.

858
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,760
It's about your legacy though.

859
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:35,860
Ooh,

860
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,950
good I to hand.

861
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,690
It's about your legacy though.

862
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,021
You know,

863
00:22:39,021 --> 00:22:39,890
beating a guy like your eye,

864
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,760
the super fights.

865
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:41,090
A split.

866
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,110
Like what's left for you,

867
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:42,351
Ryan?

868
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:43,090
Frankie to do.

869
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:43,400
Yeah.

870
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
Title should be nice.

871
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:45,080
They both been there.

872
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,250
They've both been champs.

873
00:22:46,251 --> 00:22:47,084
Right?

874
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,440
You know what's crazy here?

875
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,450
WC was,

876
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,441
but he didn't know.

877
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:53,150
It's crazy seeing this fight man.

878
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,680
Is that like thinking like man,

879
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:57,650
your Riaa almost could've fought BJ Penn.

880
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,950
That would have been saying
throws a wheel kick that

881
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:05,200
Uriah fighting against Bj
Penn would have been insane.

882
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,130
How cool is super fights though with
with these amazing legacy of these guys?

883
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,270
This is what it's about.

884
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,433
Yeah.

885
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,170
Like I don't want to see Frankie
fights on his weight class.

886
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:15,280
I don't want to see your,

887
00:23:15,281 --> 00:23:15,880
I fight someone.

888
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,421
They've been there.

889
00:23:16,421 --> 00:23:17,170
They've done that.

890
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,970
I think this is your eyes weight class.

891
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:22,330
What would be your all kind of look
at that old liver for the canteen.

892
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:24,100
Nope.

893
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,490
No Man.

894
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,410
Frankie got out.

895
00:23:26,411 --> 00:23:26,621
Shit.

896
00:23:26,621 --> 00:23:30,550
You don't think Frankie trail
piss out of that every damn dead,

897
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:32,290
but still impressive nonetheless

898
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:34,390
hard.

899
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,223
Keep them down.

900
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:35,611
Yeah.

901
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:36,330
Right back up.

902
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:36,990
It counts though.

903
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,070
Those count the judges check one for
the Frankie check one for big brown.

904
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,133
Sorry Eddie.

905
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,400
You could see how and see
what this heavy super fight.

906
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,990
Jon Jones rushed cane.

907
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,411
Yeah,

908
00:23:48,411 --> 00:23:49,220
I think so too.

909
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,960
I'm in John Jones or said Weidman.

910
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:52,810
Come on son.

911
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,021
Oh,

912
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:53,510
I like that.

913
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,321
I must do small.

914
00:23:54,321 --> 00:23:55,154
How dare you.

915
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:56,120
Are you serious?

916
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,040
How dare you Jon Jones came.

917
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,910
I was asking square garden.

918
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:01,763
Want to see that too,

919
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,510
but I just,

920
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,340
I don't know if king can
get through a training camp.

921
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,890
You know somebody who is
like putting this out there.

922
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:07,550
They were like,

923
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,050
you really think about what Cain did as
far as like cane make no mistake about

924
00:24:12,051 --> 00:24:12,141
it.

925
00:24:12,141 --> 00:24:14,690
The baddest motherfucker on the
planet in the heavyweight division,

926
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,710
the heavyweight division,

927
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,090
but the guys kind of like all of his
injuries have kind of left that whole

928
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,170
division in turmoil.

929
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,820
It's like he's only fought a few times
and she's only defend title 19 months or

930
00:24:25,821 --> 00:24:26,654
some shit.

931
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,571
Yeah,

932
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:28,751
the,

933
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:29,260
the,

934
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,030
the heavyweight division's wide open.

935
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,730
I,

936
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,910
it'd be nice to CBRE doom when I think,

937
00:24:33,911 --> 00:24:36,700
I think it'd be better for the
sport for dooms a character.

938
00:24:36,701 --> 00:24:37,540
He speaks well.

939
00:24:37,541 --> 00:24:38,390
He speaks Portuguese,

940
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,111
speaks English,

941
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,390
she can speak Spanish.

942
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:40,831
Flu.

943
00:24:40,831 --> 00:24:42,190
He's a funny guy.

944
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,290
He's on TV.

945
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:49,630
He's skillful as fuck to fuck Uriah
looking for the year teen again.

946
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,950
Canes like a robot.

947
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:52,990
All he wants to do is
wrestle and not talk.

948
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,460
Wants to do this for us all and not talk.

949
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,220
That doesn't work well when you're
trying to make money in this game.

950
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:01,054
You know what I'm saying?

951
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,511
Man,

952
00:25:01,511 --> 00:25:03,040
Frankie heavyweight champ,

953
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:03,874
son,

954
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,073
you ain't gonna be no.

955
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,880
You Know Muhammad Ali shirts like k.

956
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:07,500
You know what I'm saying?

957
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,440
Keynesian going have that.

958
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,120
Never know I,

959
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,610
it's just a matter of whether
or not he can stay healthy.

960
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,421
Frankie said,

961
00:25:13,421 --> 00:25:13,541
yeah,

962
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,251
we can,

963
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:14,441
man.

964
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:17,590
We're seeing how great he is
right now is another hens.

965
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:20,230
Oh Guy Man and Ricardo Almeida.

966
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,461
He's shown that cub,

967
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:21,911
Swanson,

968
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:22,421
relentless,

969
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:23,650
and it's now Ooh,

970
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:24,160
better get up.

971
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,480
Side slipped.

972
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,800
I'll tell you what's a
dope ass super fight.

973
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,161
I mean,

974
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:31,281
yeah,

975
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,150
it's a little early,

976
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:33,020
but I'm just saying,

977
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:33,854
hear me out.

978
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,060
Connor Pedis.

979
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,370
That would be interesting.

980
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,600
Cool fight right?

981
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,790
Pat is going to be out for almost a year.

982
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,700
I saw batty fucked his arm up.

983
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,571
I liked left Tuck,

984
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:44,810
man.

985
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:45,770
I like medicine a lot.

986
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:46,461
Yeah,

987
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:46,941
I do too.

988
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:50,090
Pedis got a new girls smoke
show pays to be the champ.

989
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,310
Man Pays championing more.

990
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:52,491
Well,

991
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:53,360
you know what I'm saying though.

992
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:53,841
I hear you.

993
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:54,540
I still has that bed.

994
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,340
His house,

995
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,180
docent belt.

996
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:56,920
She walks in.

997
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
She's seen that belts on.

998
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,240
Well you got think don't let me get
them better when he was at pitch.

999
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:04,250
Being here right now over my shoulder.

1000
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,420
You walk through my house.

1001
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:08,570
It just be on a straight fucking display.

1002
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,120
Just with a highlight tape of my
entire career as the belt spins

1003
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,773
just himself.

1004
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,810
He used to wear it.

1005
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,653
The clubs.

1006
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,770
That was always the joke.

1007
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,101
I,

1008
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:21,830
Tim Silvia was to show up at
a bar with fucking belt on.

1009
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
I'd do the same shit.

1010
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,143
Ah,

1011
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,730
dos Anjos man.

1012
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:29,481
Holy Shit.

1013
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:30,171
Is that guy good?

1014
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:30,820
Huh?

1015
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,250
Yeah,

1016
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:31,601
I fell.

1017
00:26:31,601 --> 00:26:34,580
Dos Anjos versus pedes
was an eye opening fight.

1018
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,970
What's next for Dose Angeles?

1019
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,840
I don't,

1020
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,570
does he have anything?

1021
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:39,403
No.

1022
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,860
Um,

1023
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,511
he's injured.

1024
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:41,344
They be cowboy.

1025
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,190
Maybe mean cowboy.

1026
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,650
You do.

1027
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:46,640
If he batters Mech Dessie
that she wanted 100%.

1028
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,483
Well I think,

1029
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,320
and if he does give them a title shot,

1030
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:49,591
what's that?

1031
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:54,450
Seven in a row now you know who's fucking
flourishing of this Reebok deal is

1032
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:55,284
cowboy.

1033
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,651
He's like,

1034
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:55,891
Damn,

1035
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:57,240
I fight 12 times a year.

1036
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,200
I'm about to get paid.

1037
00:26:58,201 --> 00:26:59,310
So right

1038
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,550
Dj like that deal too.

1039
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,473
I talked to him about it.

1040
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,160
Worked out for him.

1041
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,123
Works for some people.

1042
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,350
Tim didn't like it very much.

1043
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,321
Yeah.

1044
00:27:08,321 --> 00:27:11,580
I think Tim summit's Great Hymn
was only getting 2,500 bucks.

1045
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,543
Yeah.

1046
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,080
So this is an interesting fight.

1047
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:17,430
Head into this fourth round.

1048
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:18,291
Thank you.

1049
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,430
Thought Frank Frankie's
up at least two to one.

1050
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,150
You think so?

1051
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:21,983
Yes.

1052
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,131
These judges though,

1053
00:27:23,131 --> 00:27:23,371
man,

1054
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,270
it makes me nervous.

1055
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,691
Eddie,

1056
00:27:24,691 --> 00:27:25,730
you're super quiet over there.

1057
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:26,201
You piss.

1058
00:27:26,201 --> 00:27:27,034
We made this bet.

1059
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:28,463
Are you guys,

1060
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,083
I tell you what,

1061
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,470
I'll give her the money right now.

1062
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,730
It doesn't look good.

1063
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,953
That look fine.

1064
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:35,521
Yeah,

1065
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:36,354
it did.

1066
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,710
Okay.

1067
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,780
Did we go wrong bro?

1068
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:41,301
How about that?

1069
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:43,040
Bet with are not the bet.

1070
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:45,620
But the matchup with Machida and your boy,

1071
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,693
Yo Romero.

1072
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,923
That's a fine,

1073
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,913
it's interesting.

1074
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,120
It's very interesting.

1075
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,380
You all were marrow though.

1076
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,191
He keeps getting hurt,

1077
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:52,371
right?

1078
00:27:52,371 --> 00:27:52,551
Yeah,

1079
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:53,570
he gets hurt too.

1080
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,420
He's not young and all that
wrestling is in catch up.

1081
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,870
He's 37 he had a significant neck surgery.

1082
00:27:59,871 --> 00:28:00,860
Like when he gets on the scale,

1083
00:28:00,861 --> 00:28:02,900
he's got a big scar on
the back of his head.

1084
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,100
Like a where's back of his neck rather
like where they get the discs fused.

1085
00:28:07,101 --> 00:28:11,270
I Dunno if he had disectomy or I
don't know where he got it done.

1086
00:28:11,271 --> 00:28:12,530
Merrick or Cuba.

1087
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,530
But there's that.

1088
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:18,530
And then there's the last fight with
Jacques Rey that he had to pull out of.

1089
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,191
Ooh,

1090
00:28:19,191 --> 00:28:20,180
that's a good fight too,

1091
00:28:20,181 --> 00:28:20,331
man.

1092
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,164
That was a great fight.

1093
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:26,600
But him Rockhold gets the next title
shot and then he got fucking jock gray.

1094
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:27,470
I don't know what's next.

1095
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:28,610
But you can't beat Kamozi.

1096
00:28:28,611 --> 00:28:30,200
He'd already beaten the
nest for a title shot.

1097
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,380
There's so many fucking killers
at one 85 85 what fucks sakes?

1098
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:38,060
It's so stacked.

1099
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:42,920
Frankie's Donald,

1100
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,650
a lot of spinning back
kicks in this fight.

1101
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,461
It's crazy.

1102
00:28:45,461 --> 00:28:47,110
Your eyes kicking more than usual to,

1103
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,980
well I expected that I that would be
a rye would have like if he had an

1104
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:54,580
advantage it would be in a kicking but
apparently Mark Henry thought that to

1105
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:56,141
Tony Man.

1106
00:28:56,141 --> 00:29:00,520
Mark Henry writes novels on
his fighters notes and shit.

1107
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,560
There's a nice leg kick I got.

1108
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,570
Ain't just pulls that thing out so quickly
and easily as the second time you're,

1109
00:29:08,201 --> 00:29:11,020
I had like a little play on a single Ooh,

1110
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:11,711
nice left hook.

1111
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:13,900
Right Frankie retract.

1112
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,071
I love Frankie.

1113
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:19,300
So this is a very good fight though.

1114
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,680
This is a very religious man.

1115
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:22,510
This isn't like the Cub Swanson fight,

1116
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,550
which is just a Frankie Edgar show.

1117
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,390
This is a good fight and hope bro.

1118
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:29,740
This is the to the highest level
athletes we have in the UFC.

1119
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,080
Frankie Edgar's footwork,

1120
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,040
he's so consistent.

1121
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:33,874
He just,

1122
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,110
he doesn't waver.

1123
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:36,460
He does the same shit.

1124
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,050
He doesn't slow down,

1125
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,820
never slows down.

1126
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:42,340
Saint Pace for five and never stands

1127
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,080
right in front of you is constantly moved.

1128
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,681
Only fight.

1129
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:45,420
He stood in front of me.

1130
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,440
Where was the gray Maynard
fight and his coach,

1131
00:29:47,441 --> 00:29:49,570
when he comes back to
the corner market goes,

1132
00:29:49,571 --> 00:29:51,320
what the fuck did I tell you not do?

1133
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,370
What the fuck did we talk about my bat?

1134
00:29:54,371 --> 00:29:57,850
And it goes out there and beats the breaks
off and move that to the first round

1135
00:29:57,851 --> 00:29:58,091
you like,

1136
00:29:58,091 --> 00:29:59,320
how is he even going to fight?

1137
00:29:59,321 --> 00:30:00,190
And he came back and won.

1138
00:30:00,191 --> 00:30:05,191
The second round isn't saying that heroic
slam and then everybody goes crazy.

1139
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:10,260
There's certain fights that they
really need to stop in between rounds.

1140
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,840
And if you looked at the beating the gray
Maynard put on him in the first round,

1141
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:14,201
you would go,

1142
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:14,591
man,

1143
00:30:14,591 --> 00:30:15,850
I don't know if he's
gonna be able to make it.

1144
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,713
I agree.

1145
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,960
But then like look at Machida
versus Rockhold like did,

1146
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:22,600
they could have easily stopped
that fight in between rounds.

1147
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,040
They wanted to,

1148
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,023
the wool they should have.

1149
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,980
They didn't even fucking
put his mouthpiece in.

1150
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,850
I know everyone thinks
that Machida was tapping,

1151
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:31,601
verbally tapping,

1152
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:32,141
but he's saying,

1153
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:33,200
I don't have my mouthpiece.

1154
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,900
He's trying to get a break
and get the mouthpiece.

1155
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,370
Granted he was getting his,

1156
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,510
he was getting crushed.

1157
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:38,411
He got,

1158
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:39,610
he got hit in the temple.

1159
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,630
He didn't know where it was.

1160
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,800
So he got beat up.

1161
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,060
Yeah.

1162
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:42,581
That one.

1163
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:43,450
Elbow to elbow.

1164
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:43,750
Yeah.

1165
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,140
Luke.

1166
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,580
I mean he landed a lot
of ground and pound,

1167
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:48,430
but that one should go at the
end of the round was so loud.

1168
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,800
It was like boom.

1169
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,590
Like you could hear it like
coconut style one 85 man,

1170
00:30:53,591 --> 00:30:53,891
there's not,

1171
00:30:53,891 --> 00:30:54,870
there's not a better division.

1172
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,560
So fun right now.

1173
00:30:56,561 --> 00:30:57,041
You're right.

1174
00:30:57,041 --> 00:30:57,671
I think you're right.

1175
00:30:57,671 --> 00:30:58,930
Between Shaka Ray,

1176
00:30:58,931 --> 00:30:59,764
Luke Rocco,

1177
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,180
nice takedown.

1178
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,040
Frankie Edgar.

1179
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:03,821
Yeah.

1180
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,190
Jocker a yacht.

1181
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:06,170
Rock hold.

1182
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,610
Why man feet towards hard Belfort.

1183
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,060
Why men and valproate?

1184
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:11,380
Man,

1185
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,681
man,

1186
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:16,270
I'm Vito has some very fucking
sophisticated striking as
one of the reasons why.

1187
00:31:16,271 --> 00:31:17,410
That's an interesting fight.

1188
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,060
Wildcard striking for sure.

1189
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,650
If that shit lands are going to sleep.

1190
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,280
Yeah.

1191
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,580
Ice.

1192
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,830
His striking s very sophisticated.

1193
00:31:23,831 --> 00:31:24,664
Very tricky.

1194
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,000
He's so explosive too.

1195
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,630
But will he be though?

1196
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,810
That's the thing that's post TRT.

1197
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,290
He looks good now.

1198
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,630
Have you seen him a little bit in it?

1199
00:31:34,631 --> 00:31:37,420
The ride loco photography?

1200
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,231
Yeah.

1201
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:38,441
Well,

1202
00:31:38,441 --> 00:31:39,274
Ryan said,

1203
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:42,100
you know the photography is obviously
him in the middle of punching,

1204
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,510
but he said he looks good.

1205
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,310
He lost a little weight for sure.

1206
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,781
But I've seen,

1207
00:31:46,781 --> 00:31:51,340
I've seen a lot of the video footage
of him sparring a in one of the Nicky

1208
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,110
Holt's can videos use him
spar in the background.

1209
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:54,670
He looks fucking good dude.

1210
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,570
This is the thing though,

1211
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:56,404
man.

1212
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,600
As good as we think he looks,

1213
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,580
if you're a guy who's
been on TRT or whatever,

1214
00:32:01,581 --> 00:32:03,130
it testosterone your entire career,

1215
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:06,310
now you're off of it and you're fighting
the baddest one 85 on the planet.

1216
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,320
Where's your mental state at?

1217
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,120
How are you going to go?

1218
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,700
That fight went to the second round and
you've landed that spinning heel kick

1219
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:15,340
and you've landed that left hand
and he's not going anywhere.

1220
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,203
That's a good point.

1221
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,230
It's a real good point.

1222
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:18,680
Yeah.

1223
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,620
The real could point.

1224
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,710
Where's he going to be at mentally?

1225
00:32:20,711 --> 00:32:21,250
Yep.

1226
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:21,971
That's the difference.

1227
00:32:21,971 --> 00:32:22,804
Cause Chris Weidman,

1228
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,580
Chris Weidman said he uh,

1229
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,320
got his blood checked
and testosterone is low.

1230
00:32:26,321 --> 00:32:26,591
He's like,

1231
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:27,101
fuck it.

1232
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:28,090
I feel fine.

1233
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,410
Say like we me man.

1234
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:30,671
Well,

1235
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:32,200
his testosterone was low,

1236
00:32:32,201 --> 00:32:35,170
but I guarantee you a lot of
that is due to hard training.

1237
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,290
Hundred percent hard training
just jacks your levels.

1238
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:38,771
You know?

1239
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:39,830
If someone says like,

1240
00:32:39,831 --> 00:32:39,981
oh,

1241
00:32:39,981 --> 00:32:42,260
I got my levels tested
and they're really low.

1242
00:32:42,261 --> 00:32:42,860
Okay,

1243
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,270
how often we training?

1244
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,070
How often did you train the week?

1245
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,840
When did you test?

1246
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,680
Yeah,

1247
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,390
when you're in folk,

1248
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,570
like remember when DC and Jon
Jones both tested like super low?

1249
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:53,781
Yeah,

1250
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:54,260
I do.

1251
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,370
What do you think about that?

1252
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:59,360
Because a lot of people said that that
was so low that it was indication or

1253
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:01,730
indicative rather have
them doing something.

1254
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:02,060
Yeah,

1255
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,560
because,

1256
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:02,850
well,

1257
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,130
I don't know enough about it,

1258
00:33:04,131 --> 00:33:06,140
but I ran all the experts stuff.

1259
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:06,860
Well,

1260
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,480
whoever they interviewed and they
said for them to be that low,

1261
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:13,910
there would have to be some sort of abuse,

1262
00:33:13,911 --> 00:33:14,360
right,

1263
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,050
of,

1264
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:15,321
yeah,

1265
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:16,340
but I don't believe that.

1266
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:19,580
I don't think they know
because they both tested.

1267
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,700
It was low testosterone
to epitestosterone ratio,

1268
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,400
which is the opposite of
knowing someone took steroids.

1269
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,950
It's low is the opposite of that,

1270
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,650
but we don't know where they
started because DC's older,

1271
00:33:30,651 --> 00:33:31,820
he's been wrestling all his life.

1272
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,380
Jonathan competing all his life.

1273
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,700
So before camp,

1274
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:35,301
where were they at?

1275
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:35,960
We don't know.

1276
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,471
We don't know.

1277
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:37,310
For them to test it.

1278
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,830
Maybe that's normal for them because
they've been compete all the life.

1279
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,740
So to jump at those
accusations is fucking crazy.

1280
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,590
I think it's this training camp.

1281
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,850
It's like we'll do,

1282
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:51,851
we know like what a really fucking hard
ass training camp does to testosterone

1283
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:52,461
levels.

1284
00:33:52,461 --> 00:33:53,294
Is it been like,

1285
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,890
is it consistent?

1286
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,030
Is it provable?

1287
00:33:56,031 --> 00:33:56,301
I mean,

1288
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:57,500
is is a,

1289
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:01,430
is there a baseline that they measured
before he went into camp and then in the

1290
00:34:01,431 --> 00:34:02,264
middle of camp,

1291
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,430
if you just test him randomly
in the middle of the camp,

1292
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,590
you're just getting
whatever he is right now.

1293
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,453
We don't really know.

1294
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,640
Yeah.

1295
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,140
We don't know what's causing it.

1296
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:11,270
You don't know how they were sleeping.

1297
00:34:11,271 --> 00:34:11,511
I mean,

1298
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,070
that was a stressful fucking leader.

1299
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,551
You know,

1300
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:13,990
a lot of time.

1301
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:14,690
A lot of shit.

1302
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:14,950
Yeah,

1303
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:15,500
lots of things.

1304
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,890
Fight press conference.

1305
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:19,520
If you take a guy like
you test Herschel Walker,

1306
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:24,140
I bet his fucking levels are naturally
really high and you tested them randomly.

1307
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:24,710
People are like,

1308
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,071
oh dude,

1309
00:34:25,071 --> 00:34:25,820
he's on Shit.

1310
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:26,360
No,

1311
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,230
he's just a freak.

1312
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:31,310
You don't know what this level that
epitestosterone a testosterone ratios.

1313
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:32,510
Even if you're a freak,

1314
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:35,360
there's like a natural level
that you never get over.

1315
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,020
True.

1316
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:41,020
That's how like when you see a guy like
who has like a 10 to one testosterone to

1317
00:34:41,091 --> 00:34:42,850
advertise Chaucer and
he has to be on onsite,

1318
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,680
but they allow you like a two to one,

1319
00:34:45,681 --> 00:34:46,400
three to one.

1320
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,480
I think four to one.

1321
00:34:47,481 --> 00:34:50,080
Nevada you six to once
you still out sex abuse.

1322
00:34:50,081 --> 00:34:51,560
Do you see the new rules?

1323
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:53,850
Not what are the new Nevada test sponsor?

1324
00:34:53,851 --> 00:34:54,321
Steroids.

1325
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,430
Three year suspension.

1326
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,210
Oh,

1327
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,080
well that's serious.

1328
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:57,801
Three or suspect.

1329
00:34:57,801 --> 00:34:59,450
If you test for diuretics or weed,

1330
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,380
what?

1331
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,600
Three years for years for weed.

1332
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:03,380
Wow.

1333
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,030
That's what we're going to lose.

1334
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,873
He sure.

1335
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:06,771
Jamie,

1336
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,490
can you bring that up?

1337
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:08,330
I say you're not sure.

1338
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,643
I'm positive.

1339
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,440
I just read it three years for weed.

1340
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:12,080
Pretty sure.

1341
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,010
Oh No,

1342
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:13,550
I don't.

1343
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,940
I don't think never moving
away from shit like that.

1344
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:16,221
Yeah,

1345
00:35:16,221 --> 00:35:18,470
but they changed it that a
sudden they changed that.

1346
00:35:18,471 --> 00:35:18,621
No,

1347
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:18,861
no.

1348
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:22,070
Nevada changed the requirements
as far as like how,

1349
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:24,740
what's positive and what's not like what,

1350
00:35:24,741 --> 00:35:24,921
how,

1351
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:26,930
what level the metabolites have to be.

1352
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,300
They essentially don't
want people fighting.

1353
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,134
Hi.

1354
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:30,591
Ooh,

1355
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:33,050
that was a Nice Jab I Frankie now.

1356
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,410
Yeah.

1357
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,310
I'm pretty sure man.

1358
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:34,911
Okay.

1359
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:36,130
This is a fifth round already.

1360
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,681
Fuck man.

1361
00:35:36,681 --> 00:35:37,514
How'd that happen?

1362
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,780
You this first offense,

1363
00:35:39,781 --> 00:35:41,100
18 months suspension.

1364
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,000
That's for muscle.

1365
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:42,230
Relax,

1366
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,063
sleep aids,

1367
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,101
opiates,

1368
00:35:44,101 --> 00:35:44,640
cannabis,

1369
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,473
cannabis.

1370
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,373
That's 18 months.

1371
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:47,430
Ah,

1372
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:48,121
second offense.

1373
00:35:48,121 --> 00:35:49,800
30 to 40% of your purse.

1374
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,060
Third offense.

1375
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,660
You said,

1376
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,740
didn't you say three years?

1377
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,700
I did.

1378
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,091
You wrong,

1379
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:55,050
son will.

1380
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,730
Well you were right for third offense.

1381
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,380
If it's the third offense and a fine.

1382
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,830
How about a fine of 75%
of the fighters purse.

1383
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:03,720
Why don't you steal money from him?

1384
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,890
Didn't the Guy Fight?

1385
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:06,750
Why are you stealing money from him?

1386
00:36:06,751 --> 00:36:08,070
Cause he was on one weed.

1387
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,360
Diuretic time.

1388
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,550
Two Years Prank.

1389
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:11,191
He takes him down.

1390
00:36:11,191 --> 00:36:11,700
Look at this.

1391
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,301
Cocaine,

1392
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:13,134
two years.

1393
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:15,660
Damn.

1394
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,460
How good is your rock ramble?

1395
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,383
Three years.

1396
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,171
Good left hook.

1397
00:36:19,171 --> 00:36:20,280
Their first offense.

1398
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:20,820
Steroids?

1399
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,060
Yeah.

1400
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:21,720
Three years.

1401
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,340
First six months.

1402
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,100
75 up to 75% of the fighters purse.

1403
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,911
Wow.

1404
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:27,870
First offense,

1405
00:36:27,871 --> 00:36:28,710
three years.

1406
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:29,940
Second offense,

1407
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,040
48 months suspension.

1408
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:32,670
All Mike,

1409
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,750
if you run from the test,

1410
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,584
48 months.

1411
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,300
This my thing though,

1412
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:37,380
so avoiding

1413
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,200
36 months.

1414
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:40,990
How many years?

1415
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,120
First three years.

1416
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,030
So like a guy like Alistair Overeem,

1417
00:36:45,031 --> 00:36:45,360
right?

1418
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,193
He's been caught.

1419
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,640
If he tests positive we get,

1420
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,990
does it start now?

1421
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:49,711
Like he gets caught?

1422
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:51,840
Is it 36 very good points.

1423
00:36:51,841 --> 00:36:52,830
If he gets caught now,

1424
00:36:52,831 --> 00:36:54,690
is it 48 or is it lifetime?

1425
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,220
Lifetime suspension?

1426
00:36:56,221 --> 00:37:00,270
Fine of 100% if you run
for the second time.

1427
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:00,490
Well,

1428
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:00,901
I'm just like,

1429
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:04,760
so what are they going to do with
Vandelay then because Vandelay there,

1430
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,770
there's like a big court case that's
going on with him where he's saying this

1431
00:37:09,931 --> 00:37:10,650
wasn't in place.

1432
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,220
Right,

1433
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,053
exactly.

1434
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,870
They were so hoping they were going
to catch Floyd Mayweather on steroids.

1435
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,960
75% of 120 million.

1436
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,730
Yeah.

1437
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,160
Right.

1438
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,080
No Shit.

1439
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,260
Built a new Vegas.

1440
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,730
What'd you guys think of that fight,

1441
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:24,031
by the way?

1442
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:24,810
I didn't rush you.

1443
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,680
I enjoyed it.

1444
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:26,220
Me Too.

1445
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,360
I'm one of the rare people.

1446
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,310
You and I are one of the
rare people that enjoyed it.

1447
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,750
Everybody that I know.

1448
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,500
Oh Shit.

1449
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,333
Frankie almost fell.

1450
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,310
Everybody that I know that saw
it thought it was boring as fuck.

1451
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,980
I didn't make it up.

1452
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,070
A few people loved it.

1453
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:38,610
Loved it.

1454
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,410
I enjoyed it.

1455
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,400
It's a fucking match.

1456
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:42,390
You watch it again from start to finish.

1457
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:42,810
Yeah.

1458
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:43,150
Oh yeah.

1459
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,810
I'd love to see.

1460
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:44,390
I don't think you,

1461
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:45,510
I'm not going to pay a Hundo.

1462
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,510
I'll,

1463
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:50,310
I usually stream that shit hung on my DVR.

1464
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:51,144
I might watch it.

1465
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,010
I'd like watching Floyd's movements.

1466
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:53,401
We too,

1467
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:53,850
man.

1468
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,000
He's just so God damn slick
and that's the best way to box.

1469
00:37:57,001 --> 00:38:02,001
The best way to box is he that guy beat
the game 48 fights and oh and he's fine.

1470
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:04,771
Oh,

1471
00:38:04,771 --> 00:38:06,240
and 500 million in the bank.

1472
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,250
He ones hoodwinked us
to David conney ticket.

1473
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,930
Dave Chappelle was so fucking funny.

1474
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,530
He was at the comedy store and he
said that when he was at the fight,

1475
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,180
Whitney Cummings yelled out,

1476
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:18,870
I love that girl.

1477
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,310
She yelled out in the middle of fight.

1478
00:38:20,311 --> 00:38:22,410
Floyd Mayweather beats women.

1479
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:27,270
Dave Chappelle goes men to bitch into,

1480
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,250
he said it in the fucking audience.

1481
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:33,084
Fell out,

1482
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,770
fell out two bits.

1483
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:35,980
The

1484
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:39,460
way he say he's laughing and they
might had a cigarette in his hand,

1485
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:40,294
and men too.

1486
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,550
What's wrong with Whitney?

1487
00:38:45,551 --> 00:38:46,870
Which doing well,

1488
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:48,250
she's empowered woman,

1489
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:48,710
you know,

1490
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,301
once a letter,

1491
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:50,530
but he knows what they already know.

1492
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:50,771
Well,

1493
00:38:50,771 --> 00:38:53,980
you came in support them at the fight
that you pay for a ticket or somebody

1494
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:55,840
bought it for either way much.

1495
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,910
Floyd's Paki I don't even
know if it really happened.

1496
00:38:57,911 --> 00:38:58,530
That's it.

1497
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:58,961
There you go.

1498
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,794
Five rounds,

1499
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,240
two minutes y'all.

1500
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,870
You can't trust these judges
and 100% I'll look at Frankie.

1501
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,410
You're actually,

1502
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,243
it's pretty sad.

1503
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,740
100% powerful.

1504
00:39:08,741 --> 00:39:09,311
Mark Henry,

1505
00:39:09,311 --> 00:39:09,760
Ricardo,

1506
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,593
Meda.

1507
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,550
God dammit,

1508
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,120
you should honey.

1509
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,280
Get you into that Batman.

1510
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,670
I never really lost that much off.

1511
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,020
Hence this sets up.

1512
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,420
Give me one.

1513
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:22,751
Fuck.

1514
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,160
It gets back to sons.

1515
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:27,280
This sets up an opportunity
though for a new,

1516
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,360
completely new,

1517
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:29,194
a fresh start.

1518
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,060
Fights next week.

1519
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:33,010
Yes.

1520
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:33,310
Yeah.

1521
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,143
Vegas.

1522
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,680
We're going to be their son.

1523
00:39:36,870 --> 00:39:39,340
I'm in Connecticut hosted
Espn Sports Center.

1524
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:40,330
Breaking down the fights.

1525
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,130
You got to go to Connecticut,

1526
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:42,791
Connecticut,

1527
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:43,624
Bristol.

1528
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,613
Ooh,

1529
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:49,120
that's where do you want a
Anthony Johnson and Cormier?

1530
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,633
He got DC.

1531
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,300
Wow,

1532
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,320
that's a good bet.

1533
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,370
That's a great bet.

1534
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:57,100
That's a good bet to take it.

1535
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,113
What do you think of that?

1536
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,643
We think of that.

1537
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,040
What about Weidman?

1538
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,873
Belfour

1539
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,063
I got Weidman.

1540
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,973
I got white men.

1541
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,520
Someone who's going to be
gangster and take feed.

1542
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:10,170
Tour.

1543
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,361
What?

1544
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:10,481
Hey,

1545
00:40:10,481 --> 00:40:10,811
what about,

1546
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,890
what about Travis Browne?

1547
00:40:11,891 --> 00:40:13,820
Andre last dog Brown.

1548
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,160
I follow both of them.

1549
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:16,840
I beat one of them.

1550
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,383
What?

1551
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,233
Who Do you want?

1552
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,710
Travis fucking Brown.

1553
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,670
So you want our laps and
I see what you're doing.

1554
00:40:26,890 --> 00:40:28,870
You're catching onto
this honey take scheme.

1555
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,640
The next week's card man is so stacked.

1556
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,600
If you go over about that
one for a little bit,

1557
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,290
think about that one thing
about DC rumble of course,

1558
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:44,860
and you'll check the odds,

1559
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:45,700
but it's all good,

1560
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:49,750
but isn't isn't a rumble
like in China or something?

1561
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,231
No,

1562
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:51,064
he's back.

1563
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,090
He was in town for a while,

1564
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:52,300
right?

1565
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,511
Yeah,

1566
00:40:52,511 --> 00:40:54,000
he was doing some seminars.

1567
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm going to try it.

1568
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,420
I don't know.

1569
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,200
That's a tough one.

1570
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,340
Look at this fucking car,

1571
00:40:57,341 --> 00:40:58,174
dude.

1572
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,130
Here's the fight card.

1573
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,670
That joy Benevidez and
Morag has a good fight.

1574
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:04,301
Fuck yeah,

1575
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:06,310
it is Mick desk.

1576
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,710
No love.

1577
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:09,461
No,

1578
00:41:09,461 --> 00:41:09,790
right.

1579
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,100
Well it's just because they
carry the car to just so stack.

1580
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:16,960
It's also those guys suck at Social
Media Dotson versus Zach Makowsky.

1581
00:41:16,961 --> 00:41:18,100
No one's talking about that.

1582
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,610
That's a great fucking fight.

1583
00:41:19,611 --> 00:41:20,440
The good fight too.

1584
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,720
That's a great fucking fights.

1585
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:22,950
Too many heavy hitters were.

1586
00:41:22,951 --> 00:41:23,830
We're not talking about it.

1587
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,011
Ooh,

1588
00:41:24,011 --> 00:41:24,670
Frankie one.

1589
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:27,250
How about your Ryan crazy.

1590
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:30,850
How about your Ryan Hall
versus Hofeld and a towel?

1591
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:32,020
That's a good fucking fight.

1592
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,900
The good fight.

1593
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,040
That's one that PP boy.

1594
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:34,820
Uriah Hall.

1595
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,050
Did we shake hands?

1596
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,260
Yeah,

1597
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,890
we did remember you were like pulling
away and I grabbed your hand and shook it.

1598
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,840
I shake hands.

1599
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:45,681
I remember that.

1600
00:41:45,681 --> 00:41:48,740
We didn't shake hands I thought
and the double or nothing.

1601
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:50,030
I thought you doubles or nothing.

1602
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:50,790
I think you double it.

1603
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:51,650
Nothing for sure.

1604
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,690
Definitely double check.

1605
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:54,524
Sorry.

1606
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,090
Frankie Edgar.

1607
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,910
Thank you though.

1608
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,200
I was stressed.

1609
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:00,561
Yeah.

1610
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:03,470
This some next week's
cardies is fucking insane.

1611
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:04,310
Crazy stack.

1612
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,290
It is a really good card.

1613
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,680
Do you guys seen the jinx yet and HBO?

1614
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:10,810
We talked about this already.

1615
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,370
I wonder if there's more others.

1616
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:14,150
More fights.

1617
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,810
Oh ma'am.

1618
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:15,980
Piles at the bottom.

1619
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:16,260
Guilt.

1620
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,820
Then we see that Kim Berkman.

1621
00:42:18,821 --> 00:42:21,780
It's a good fight bro and bro Rose,

1622
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,420
this is dope.

1623
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,040
Yeah,

1624
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,711
it's going to be awesome.

1625
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:25,030
Roses.

1626
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,150
A little superstar man.

1627
00:42:26,151 --> 00:42:26,550
She,

1628
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,590
she had a lost that finale,

1629
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:28,670
but she's going to be a star.

1630
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,380
Don Young Kim versus Berkman.

1631
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,310
No one's talking about that.

1632
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,600
That's a great fight.

1633
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:34,370
But rose doesn't want to fight.

1634
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,380
Johana why raw?

1635
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,410
Johan is a savage.

1636
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:39,040
I thought you were saying
she like turned it down now.

1637
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:39,211
No.

1638
00:42:39,211 --> 00:42:42,770
Was trying to fight that girl
in that White Polo fighter.

1639
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:43,610
She turned off by that.

1640
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,250
I mean maybe she just saying she
don't want a piece of it right now.

1641
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,113
Right.

1642
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:49,510
Probably most certainly would find him.

1643
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:50,900
Doug let her get one window.

1644
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,770
Honor is,

1645
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:52,970
she's bad ass.

1646
00:42:52,971 --> 00:42:53,550
She's cursed.

1647
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,890
Strikings nasty.

1648
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:55,731
Yeah.

1649
00:42:55,731 --> 00:42:57,160
She's just so crisp.

1650
00:42:57,161 --> 00:42:58,940
How's Frankie Conor McGregor breakdown?

1651
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,440
That's a really good fucking question
because we've never seen Conor McGregor

1652
00:43:03,441 --> 00:43:04,520
getting taken down,

1653
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,870
taken down and a guy quicker.

1654
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,150
Right.

1655
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,330
I've seen a guy quicker than him.

1656
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:11,270
You know who really would
be interesting is Mendez,

1657
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,930
Chad Mendez versus Conor McGregor
would be very fucking interesting.

1658
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,360
His Chad Mendez can shut the lights out.

1659
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,501
Oh,

1660
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:23,300
he has the most power that the lights out
when he hit llamas in llamas was like,

1661
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,051
oh,

1662
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:25,110
what was that all about?

1663
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:25,940
I'm alumnus.

1664
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,140
He was like bank.

1665
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,213
I was queasy.

1666
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:29,690
He's a fucking stud man.

1667
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:31,460
He's a super athlete and a stud.

1668
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,490
Oh well it was the,

1669
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,840
for sure if there's something I
don't give a fuck about its baseball.

1670
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,040
Yeah.

1671
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:36,880
As soon as that came on,

1672
00:43:36,881 --> 00:43:37,940
I'm my shut this off.

1673
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:41,380
Look at that terrible
logo there with that.

1674
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,210
Who came up?

1675
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:43,820
Multi colored Marlin.

1676
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,250
What marketing asshole came up with that.

1677
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,140
Where are the Marlins?

1678
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,510
The fish that you don't even eat

1679
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,790
was trying to um,

1680
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,930
sponsor the UFC so I wouldn't talk shit.

1681
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:57,793
How come?

1682
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:59,250
Why aren't they in mind?

1683
00:43:59,400 --> 00:43:59,780
We'll see.

1684
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,620
It might be in the works.

1685
00:44:00,621 --> 00:44:01,290
We don't know.

1686
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:01,500

homey.com

1689
00:44:04,670 --> 00:44:06,470
there's a fight companions over.

1690
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:07,370
I'm going back to sleep.

1691
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:07,791
I'm proud of,

1692
00:44:07,791 --> 00:44:08,624
you know,

1693
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:10,340
falling asleep.

1694
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:11,240

1695
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,980
I did fall the second in
between the fourth and fifth.

1696
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,180
You zoned out for a little while.

1697
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:17,781
I went,

1698
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:18,170
boom.

1699
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,003
I said Shinzen

1700
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,261
nobody's looking.

1701
00:44:21,261 --> 00:44:22,640
I looked over at Aubrey and my kid,

1702
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,531
he's zoned out,

1703
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:24,364
but I wouldn't know.

1704
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,221
Nobody noticed.

1705
00:44:25,221 --> 00:44:25,431
Right.

1706
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:25,671
Okay,

1707
00:44:25,671 --> 00:44:26,270
cool.

1708
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:27,020
I did go out.

1709
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:28,010
We've got up here.

1710
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:31,950
We got up here at seven o'clock in the
morning and did a four was almost four

1711
00:44:31,951 --> 00:44:32,120

Damn good.

1715
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,560
We talked about two fights

1716
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:39,930
and team.

1717
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,711
That's one thing.

1718
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,660
Like in the beginning when
we first started doing these,

1719
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,411
people get pitched.

1720
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:43,761
You guys ready?

1721
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,060
If you're talking about the fights now,

1722
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:45,960
they never do that.

1723
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:46,360
You,

1724
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,193
they've given up.

1725
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,080
I'll fuck these guys.

1726
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,670

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,073
real radio.

1857
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,790
I tried to go to sleep.

1858
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,413
What is it?

1859
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,970
$5?

1860
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:26,913
Yeah.

1861
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:32,610
Well a GT three r that's a race card.

1862
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,720
That's not a real car.

1863
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,820
They're making it available.

1864
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,400
Holy Fuck.

1865
00:48:39,030 --> 00:48:39,863
How much horsepower?

1866
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:42,210
506 speed transmission.

1867
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:43,670
Wait a minute,

1868
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,880
cause everything else is
a six speed transmission.

1869
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:49,010
Hold on.

1870
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:53,020
So that means it's a
manual versus six weeks,

1871
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:55,000
not a road car.

1872
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:55,833
Dude.

1873
00:48:57,360 --> 00:48:58,400
Those ours,

1874
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:59,930
they used to be called Rs.

1875
00:48:59,931 --> 00:49:00,430
Rs.

1876
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:01,263
That's the race.

1877
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:03,070
That's a real racing,

1878
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,600
but you can get the gt
three s that orange one,

1879
00:49:05,601 --> 00:49:05,991
what is it?

1880
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:08,510
The Gt three you don't talk about,

1881
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,131
it's like yours,

1882
00:49:10,131 --> 00:49:11,120
but then it's race.
