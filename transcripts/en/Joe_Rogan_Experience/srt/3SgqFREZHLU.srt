1
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,840
Ooh,

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,580
that's not bad.

3
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,490
Oh,

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,333
this,

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:25,980
can you get a little power?

6
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,060
Oh,

7
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,920
is bra?

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:40,150
What's the rest of,

9
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:40,720
I don't know,

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,920
something in heavenly peace.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,851
Holy infant.

12
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:43,684
So tender and mild.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,400
Oh,

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,243
please.

15
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,560
Eh.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,000
I went immediately to the bag singer
voice that whispery I know you did,

17
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,730
but you know what you tried

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:09,881
to do?

19
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:10,480
I think you were,

20
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,201
he was tuned,

21
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:14,010
wasn't he Jamie entering key?

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,750
Anybody who talks to you like that.
