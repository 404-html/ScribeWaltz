1
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:09,733
All we'll live.

2
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,063
You called that a,
you get that bar and your teeth are you 

3
00:00:14,141 --> 00:00:19,141
good thing stick.
They stick those green belly meal bars.

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,410
So,
uh,

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:21,243
first of all,
man,

6
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:23,950
your documentary,
Icarus is a,

7
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:27,300
I see I say that wrong all the time.
I say a chorus,

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:28,950
but it's ICARUS.
ICARUS,

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,823
yeah.
That's the guy with the wings that flew 

10
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,740
too close to the sun.
Exactly.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,540
Um,
it's fucking amazing.

12
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:36,130
It's an amazing documentary.
Um,

13
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,630
uh,
I had contacted you,

14
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,464
we'd gone back and forth a little bit on
twitter and then I finally sat down and 

15
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,570
watched it the other day and I was like,
Holy Shit.

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,680
The extent of the coverup and the,
the first of all for,

17
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,940
for folks who don't know what it's 
about,

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,360
the documentary started off just kind of
about doping.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,283
Right?
And then it became about the state 

20
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:02,980
sponsored Russian doping program and 
then it all imploded.

21
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,390
While you were doing the documentary,
the documentary,

22
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,860
how long did it take you to put this 
together?

23
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,163
A three and a half years.
And so what was the initial idea behind 

24
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:13,680
it?

25
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,410
So the initial idea,
I guess,

26
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,080
uh,
I'll,

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,570
I'll say it's a,
it's streaming on Netflix right now.

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,433
They've released it a month ago and uh,
the initial idea had come to me 

29
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:24,773
essentially when Armstrong confessed and
I'd been a lifelong cycling fan and I 

30
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:31,170
had followed him for,
you know,

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,690
my,
my whole journey with him.

32
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,973
And uh,
and what struck me the most about his 

33
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,250
confession was that if you talk to 
anybody outside of the sport,

34
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,450
they all thought that he got caught.
But the reality is,

35
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,400
is he actually never got caught.
I mean,

36
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:51,780
to this day this guy is passed,
500 anti-doping controls clean.

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,520
So I'm going,
wait,

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,713
not what's wrong with Armstrong?
What's wrong with this global 

39
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:03,561
anti-doping system that they can't catch
the most tested athlete on planet earth?

40
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,000
And I'm going,
wait,

41
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,840
he's tested clean 500 times.
Who should we be mad at?

42
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:14,841
Should we be mad at Armstrong or should 
we be upset at this system?

43
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,803
That is essentially making an athlete 
not have a choice as to what they do or 

44
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,664
not do.
If they actually want to have a 

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,913
possibility of winning,
if the system itself is not able to 

46
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:27,500
catch them,
well that's a big

47
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,231
factor,
right?

48
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,280
I mean that is really an important thing
to talk about it in the high level world

49
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,114
of cycling when they took away 
Armstrong's victories in the Tour de 

50
00:02:35,941 --> 00:02:36,774
France.
I think the person who got who did not 

51
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:45,660
test positive in any tests before that,
I think it was like 18th place.

52
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,660
Is that correct?
Someone I don't

53
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,980
remember exactly,
but yeah,

54
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:53,480
but there was,
there was no one and then even after a,

55
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:54,763
his confession,
if you remember how they get them to 

56
00:02:56,391 --> 00:03:00,100
confess as essentially the,
the feds come in on

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,933
a criminal investigation and they 
basically go to all of his teammates 

58
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:04,774
over the years that he had raised some 
basically point guns at their head and 

59
00:03:07,851 --> 00:03:08,684
say,
Hey,

60
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,630
uh,
did you dope or did you not dope?

61
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,890
Now if you tell us that you doped and 
that Armstrong doped,

62
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,610
you go free and we weren't going to 
punish you,

63
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,550
but if you lie to us,
there's gonna be a price to pay.

64
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,743
And in doing that,
all of his teammates who did the exact 

65
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,380
same thing that he did ratted him out in
exchange for their own immunity.

66
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,440
And um,
and the rest is history,

67
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,771
do it too,
right?

68
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,604
Like he was actually suing people that 
were saying that he was doping and he 

69
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:42,730
was going after them and threatening 
them with lawsuits and which,

70
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,783
you know,

71
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:44,783
and that's,
you know why before I ever picked up a 

72
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:50,020
camera,
um,

73
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,090
I had named the film Icarus and I had 
named it icarus because of what I deemed

74
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:01,510
the Armstrong story,
which was a story of a guy who just kept

75
00:04:02,601 --> 00:04:03,434
pushing the boundaries and pushing the 
boundaries and pushing the boundaries 

76
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,733
until he flew too close to the sun and 
his wings burn and he plummeted to the 

77
00:04:10,761 --> 00:04:14,390
earth.
And that to me was the story of,

78
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,860
you know,
uh,

79
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,980
ambition that wouldn't stop and having 
no filter on how far you went to win and

80
00:04:24,021 --> 00:04:24,854
what you were willing to do and who you 
were willing to destroy in that process 

81
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,240
to win.
And to me,

82
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
um,
you know,

83
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,070
when you take the doping out of it,
that's,

84
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,330
you know,
uh,

85
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,890
the problem that,
you know,

86
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,740
I would have on a,
on a,

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,340
on a personal kind of level with the 
lance of it that,

88
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,470
you know,
it's one thing if you're doing something

89
00:04:45,471 --> 00:04:46,304
that everybody else is doing,
but it's another thing when you 

90
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,880
literally are going out and destroying 
other people's lives to,

91
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,310
um,
to try to protect your own lies.

92
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,741
Yeah.
I mean,

93
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:59,620
I kind of see his position,
I see how he got caught up in it and the

94
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:02,830
momentum of it all just sort of brought 
them to this place where it was almost.

95
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,230
No,
there's no way to do it either,

96
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,213
you know,
you go after these people and try to 

97
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:07,684
silence them or you come clean.
And eventually he was forced to come 

98
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:11,680
clean.
You knew though.

99
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,993
Um,
and most people did that he was doing 

100
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,460
something.
Yeah.

101
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:16,294
I mean,
I had

102
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,040
always felt that he was doing something.
Um,

103
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,883
but I also,
having been kind of deeply involved in 

104
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:23,764
the sport,
believed that everybody else was doing 

105
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,224
something also.
So his confession to me wasn't really 

106
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,020
the shocker,
what was,

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,913
what was the shocker and what set me out
on this journey was like in the Public 

108
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,543
Court of opinion and what you saw going 
on in the news was it was essentially 

109
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:43,900
like,
you know,

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,620
we've got Gadi,
we've got Al Capone,

111
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:50,560
we've got the ringleader,
we've got the,

112
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:51,603
you know,
the biggest criminal and the history of 

113
00:05:53,171 --> 00:05:54,004
sport essentially.
And we finally got him and to me it was 

114
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,220
getting Al Capone

115
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
on tax evasion.
You didn't get him because the system 

116
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,930
didn't work to get him.
And so I started looking at,

117
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,783
forget about cycling.
I was looking at what does this mean in 

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,433
all sports?
What does this mean in terms of the 

119
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,343
Olympics?
What does this mean in terms of 

120
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:18,770
basketball and football and baseball 
and,

121
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,963
and all these other sports.
If the most tested athlete on planet 

122
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,630
earth can't be caught.
And um,

123
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,553
and that's what set me out on a to make 
the film initially was to explore using 

124
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:36,800
kind of just the Armstrong story as the 
framework,

125
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:37,634
but to explore what was,
what was wrong with the Anti doping 

126
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:45,920
system in sport and essentially use 
myself as a,

127
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,783
as a human Guinea pig to explore that 
and then along that way kind of show 

128
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,143
whether or not this system worked and 
then essentially present hypothetical's 

129
00:06:57,441 --> 00:06:59,900
about what could be done or what 
couldn't be done.

130
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,230
Um,
and whether or not we as a society care,

131
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,730
uh,
about,

132
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,260
you know,
drug use in sport and,

133
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,520
and that was the original concept and 
construct of the film.

134
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,293
Well,
drug use in sport is very complicated 

135
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:17,054
because it's,
it's so prevalent and it's almost 

136
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,400
impossible to separate the two when you 
think about it,

137
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,680
particularly the Tour de France,
right?

138
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:26,210
And professional cycling.
I mean,

139
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,640
it is just a dirty sport.
Well,

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,600
I,
I think that,

141
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,434
um,
from what I know is over the last 

142
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,540
several years,
it's really cleaned up quite a bit,

143
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,190
quite a lot.
Um,

144
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,560
and if you start looking at the times 
also they've,

145
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,230
they've started to come down and slow 
down,

146
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,160
um,
but I think that we're probably in a,

147
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
um,
what I would call it,

148
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:51,620
I don't know,
a glory period,

149
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,763
uh,
between the science kind of catching up 

150
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:59,330
to the cheaters in some way.
And then the cheaters basically figuring

151
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,210
out how to out science the science 
again,

152
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,830
so they're in like a holding pattern,
I feel like in the world of cycling,

153
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,520
um,
at least that's going on to some extent.

154
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,900
You just get caught just a couple days 
ago with a,

155
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,750
an engine in his bike.
Oh,

156
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:15,700
that's the new thing.
Yeah,

157
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,320
they're,
they're putting engines and bikes.

158
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,270
Um,
I've read that a,

159
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:23,810
they're now figuring out how to 
replicate a epo,

160
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:24,644
withrow,
poblete and at the genetic level 

161
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:30,460
basically how to make yourselves 
naturally create more withrow po eaten.

162
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:35,470
So there's always going to be something 
on that cusp of,

163
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,690
of medical technology.
Um,

164
00:08:38,691 --> 00:08:39,524
and human evolution.
I'm trying to outsmart the system and 

165
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:46,360
the testing.
So when you contacted the,

166
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,600
uh,
the Russian gentleman,

167
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,040
what was his name again?
Gregory.

168
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:54,041
Rich Chenko and Gregory is the guy and 
he's right now in the witness protection

169
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,280
program.
Protective protective

170
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,460
custody.
Now how did you get ahold of him and how

171
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,770
did you set that up?
Because it was fascinating.

172
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:04,800
Once you shoot your ass full with like 
100 different kinds of steroids.

173
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:08,370
I mean it was just how much,
how many different things did you take?

174
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,860
It took a lot

175
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,160
over how much of a period of about nine 
months.

176
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,040
About nine months.
And in what had,

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,780
what had happened is,
is.

178
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:24,614
So I decided that I was gonna go on this
supersize me as journey into the world 

179
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:30,614
of performance enhancing drugs and I 
spend about a year doing all this 

180
00:09:35,001 --> 00:09:36,110
research,
uh,

181
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,290
shortly after Armstrong confesses,
which is 2013,

182
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,670
early 2013 and I actually picked up a 
camera in May of 2014.

183
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:44,504
And,
and over this year I start talking to 

184
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:51,551
all these scientists and I'm contacting 
people on a global level and Switzerland

185
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:54,530
and Germany and the UK and all over the 
US.

186
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,740
And essentially each one of these 
scientists I'm asking,

187
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,280
I'm essentially the same questions.
I'm saying,

188
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,143
Hey,
do you believe they anti-doping system 

189
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:09,260
in sport works?
And every single one of them said no,

190
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,173
and I said,
do you believe that you can catch an 

191
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:17,060
athlete who is doping?

192
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,620
And every single one of them told me no.
I said,

193
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,454
do you believe that you could still 
essentially do what Lance Armstrong did 

194
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,210
and get away with it with the proper 
advisors?

195
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,060
And every one of them said to me,
yes,

196
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,510
and then I would pose the question to 
each one of these guys.

197
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,000
I said,
are you able,

198
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,223
would you have this knowledge to advise 
me how to essentially a evade positive 

199
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:48,950
detection?
And the vast majority of them said yes,

200
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,590
and I said,
but will you do that?

201
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,693
And they said no.
And they said the biggest variable was 

202
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:00,320
it you've got to get your samples into a
water lab,

203
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:01,154
a World Anti Doping Agency lab.
And that becomes very difficult because 

204
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:08,150
if you can just get your samples into 
water lab,

205
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,890
amateur professional,
anybody,

206
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:14,090
right?
Well you can start figuring out all the,

207
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,093
you know,
loopholes and what you can do and what 

208
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:17,504
you can't do.
If you can essentially know how to be 

209
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:19,874
tested.
So the variable was how is going to get 

210
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,114
my samples into a Wada lab and I start 
talking to a scientist here by the name 

211
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:29,624
of Don Catlin and Los Angeles and he's 
considered the grandfather of 

212
00:11:33,531 --> 00:11:34,364
anti-doping.
He created all the tests for the first 

213
00:11:38,451 --> 00:11:41,660
test for steroid detection and sport.
And he actually,

214
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,810
uh,
is the first guy who did the testing for

215
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:45,644
the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles,
which was the first time they ever did 

216
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,170
anti-doping,
testing and sport.

217
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,160
So caitlin has developed all these tests

218
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:54,993
and,
and I get in touch with Catlin and he's 

219
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,920
retired.
He's still alive,

220
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,310
I think he's about 80 years old and he 
retired,

221
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,870
I don't know,
five,

222
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,704
six years ago.
And I quickly realized in talking to 

223
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,960
Kaitlin that he's,
he's very frustrated.

224
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,003
He basically is,
felt that he spent his entire life and 

225
00:12:14,471 --> 00:12:15,304
career in a system that he was never 
going to win at and that no matter what 

226
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:22,384
he did and he would develop one 
methodology to catch somebody the very 

227
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,120
next day there'd be another way around 
it.

228
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,223
And then he would develop another 
methodology and then the very next day 

229
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:31,984
there'd be someone around it or he would
propose that the league or the NFL or 

230
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:43,360
baseball or wherever he wants say should
use this test to catch,

231
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,673
you know,
this sort of substance abuse and the 

232
00:12:46,781 --> 00:12:51,781
leagues would not use that test 
intentionally or he would find positives

233
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,760
and report the positives and then be 
told basically to,

234
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,073
you know,
pretend that there wasn't a positive 

235
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:03,730
because his job was simply to report not
to police.

236
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,210
And he had spent an entire career with 
this.

237
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,600
And um,
and so he has a,

238
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,533
you know,
I think a lot of frustrations with the 

239
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:14,884
anti-doping system.
And he said that he wouldn't help me do 

240
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:19,564
it because they,
he would've had to prescribe me drugs 

241
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,440
and he didn't want to be liable for 
that.

242
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,753
B,
he didn't know how he was going to get 

243
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:29,470
my samples into a water lab because he 
doesn't have access to that anymore.

244
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,760
And he was worried about his legacy.
He didn't want to,

245
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,120
as much as he felt all the fallacies and
the system,

246
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,360
he didn't want to be out there.
You know,

247
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,730
basically almost in a way,
making a mockery of,

248
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:45,400
of all of his work.
And he says,

249
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,650
Hey,
I know this scientists in Russia,

250
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,400
Gregory Rick Cheng cough,
he runs the water lab,

251
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:52,234
the World Anti Doping Agency lab for all
of Russia and I think he might help you 

252
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,753
and you know,
essentially you said that because he 

253
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,740
knew that the Russians had always been 
kind of trying to,

254
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,300
to,
uh,

255
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,820
to figure out ways to game the system.

256
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,400
And uh,
and he had met Gregory,

257
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,293
uh,
in like 1983 and that's a whole other 

258
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:19,870
story because Gregory had basically come
to the United States as a spy,

259
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,243
a to figure out what the Americans were 
going to beat them against in the 1984 

260
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,120
Olympics,
which I can talk about later.

261
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,313
But,
um,

262
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,720
uh,
I get in touch with gregory,

263
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,554
connects us through email and I start 
emailing gregory and we spend about 

264
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,330
eight months back and forth on emails,
calls.

265
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,120
At the time he had just done the Sochi 
Olympics.

266
00:14:43,121 --> 00:14:43,954
So he was doing all the testing for the 
Sochi Olympics and he invites me out to 

267
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:51,230
Oregon.
And this is July of 2014 to go meet him.

268
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:52,130
He's lecturing at this

269
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,720
symposium and he doesn't know at the 
time that I want a dope.

270
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,920
He just thinks that I'm an American 
filmmaker making a documentary,

271
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:02,960
exploring the anti-doping system in 
sport.

272
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,483
So I go out to Oregon and I make a 
decision that I'm not going to bring my 

273
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,133
camera crews.
I'm not going to do anything other than 

274
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:14,420
to just meet him.
Um,

275
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,583
and we start talking and I say to 
Gregory and he had just finished the 

276
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,270
Sochi Games.
I said,

277
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,103
do you believe that a medal in the 
Olympics can be one without performance 

278
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:30,260
enhancing drugs?
And he goes,

279
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,380
no.
And I say,

280
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,150
why?
And he says,

281
00:15:35,151 --> 00:15:38,540
well,
I should believe I tried to believe,

282
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,763
but I don't believe a medal in the 
Olympics can be one without performance 

283
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:46,130
enhancing drugs.
And then he takes this pause,

284
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,350
I'll never forget this.
And he goes,

285
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,080
I don't know,
maybe I'm a bad man.

286
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,460
And he says to me.
And um,

287
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,820
and that was this moment where I went,
okay.

288
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:02,870
Clearly there is a,
a deeper story here that the,

289
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,440
the head of the anti-doping laboratory 
in Russia's telling me that a,

290
00:16:08,571 --> 00:16:12,250
he doesn't think you can win an Olympic 
medal cleanly and be,

291
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,493
um,
he doesn't know whether or not he's a 

292
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,190
bad man.
And um,

293
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,460
what was going through your head?
It was like a,

294
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:25,490
I think I just hit the motherload for,
for,

295
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,353
for uh,
what will be a riveting film and not 

296
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,810
just Manhattan changes mobile story and,
and um,

297
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:42,080
and I say to him and we really bonded 
and I really liked the guy,

298
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:42,770
like just,
just,

299
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,900
he's as you see in the film,
I mean he's impossible not to like,

300
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,680
you know,
and I liked him to.

301
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,100
I liken him Kinda like Bryan Cranston 
and breaking bad.

302
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:54,650
I mean there's this guy who's living 
this,

303
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,813
you know,
you love him and at the same time he's 

304
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,170
doing things that he shouldn't be doing.

305
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,483
Um,
and he'd been living this double life 

306
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,450
his entire life was living a double 
life,

307
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,250
which is a,
which is insane.

308
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,520
And he agrees that he is going to help 
me.

309
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,410
I'm dope and avoid detection.
But before this,

310
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,650
he agrees,
but he's not admitting to anything.

311
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:20,150
No,
not admitting to anything.

312
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,340
It's just showing you how it just says.
But he,

313
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,450
but he,
but he says,

314
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,170
look,
you know,

315
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,830
you're an amateur cyclist.
Um,

316
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:29,810
you're not a professional.
And in his mind,

317
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,540
even though I was quote unquote 
cheating,

318
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,990
I wasn't cheating anyone out of 
anything.

319
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,540
And you were doing it very openly.
Yeah.

320
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,800
And I was doing it very openly and,
and so he viewed it as kind of like,

321
00:17:42,801 --> 00:17:43,730
hey,
this is,

322
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,760
this is a cool project to get involved 
in.

323
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,320
And in his mind I think he also looked 
at it as,

324
00:17:49,321 --> 00:17:50,040
hey,

325
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,873
what's the big deal if I expose the 
fallacies and the anti doping system 

326
00:17:54,631 --> 00:17:59,631
because maybe they'll actually do 
something about it if I show a,

327
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,280
you know,
essentially how it doesn't work.

328
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,473
So he agrees that he's going to be my 
doping advisor and this is now July 

329
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:11,100
2014.
But I had to do the race clean first.

330
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:14,400
I then had to go and you know,
through this whole thing.

331
00:18:14,401 --> 00:18:15,234
And I wasn't going to actually start 
doping until essentially the beginning 

332
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:21,990
of,
of the next year and beginning of 2015.

333
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,180
So you got to do the race clean to get a
base.

334
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,170
Yeah.
To do.

335
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,940
And because my whole premise was,
hey,

336
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:30,180
I'm going to do this race twice.
I'm gonna go in and do an clean,

337
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,253
see how good I do.
And then the next year I'm going to go 

338
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:36,900
in just dope to the gills with the hope 
that I'm going to win it.

339
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,853
Now.
How much cycling had you done before 

340
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:39,564
this?
A lot.

341
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,570
A lot.
I grew up racing when I was 13,

342
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,040
a race seriously ties 19.
But then I moved out to La at,

343
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:50,700
um,
I was in a huge,

344
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:55,440
like a horrific bike crash and as 19 and
a race and that essentially,

345
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,720
I guess,
um,

346
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,130
I didn't have the balls after that I 
went back and race to not happen here,

347
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,361
uh,
last,

348
00:19:03,361 --> 00:19:04,290
uh,
eight teeth.

349
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,583
All of these were shattered.
This one was knocked out entirely and 

350
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,860
uh,
and it was like,

351
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,100
it was a bad wreck.
And um,

352
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,650
I was 19.
I just,

353
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,493
um,
my freshman year in college and some 

354
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,660
went through college basically with 
plastic teeth in my mouth as I was going

355
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,330
through essentially reconstructive 
dental work,

356
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,643
um,
and it made me really think twice about 

357
00:19:27,511 --> 00:19:30,360
being a professional athlete or pursuing
cycling.

358
00:19:30,361 --> 00:19:35,361
And I came back to it the following year
and as you know,

359
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,060
in any sort of competitive realm in 
sport,

360
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,090
you can't be thinking about whether or 
not you're going to get injured.

361
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,730
You can't be thinking about what those 
risks are.

362
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:45,564
You have to be fully committed or you're
going to lose or you're going to get 

363
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:49,104
dropped.
And,

364
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,150
and I found myself,
you know,

365
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,580
not following the,
we'll close enough.

366
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,470
I found myself holding back on 
descendants.

367
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:57,660
I found myself like in my mind of Oh my 
God,

368
00:19:57,661 --> 00:19:58,494
what if this crash happens again?
And so I decided to stop racing and 

369
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,130
moved out to la.
I got into the entertainment business is

370
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:09,630
doing standup comedy originally.
And um,

371
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,810
but cycling remained like my passion in 
life.

372
00:20:12,811 --> 00:20:15,630
So it's just like my life's therapy.
Like,

373
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,250
you know,
I'm stressed out,

374
00:20:17,251 --> 00:20:20,640
I go on the bike and,
and so I've always rode.

375
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,590
But I stopped racing,
um,

376
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,080
but uh,
to go back and do this,

377
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,490
it was like,
okay,

378
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,730
it was a part of me where I'm going to 
kind of go relive my,

379
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:34,500
my youth or the idea of how good I could
possibly be.

380
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,530
And um,
and the bigger element was it is.

381
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:41,220
I thought it was going to be a 
compelling film and something that would

382
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:44,670
be very interesting not for cycling,
you know,

383
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,000
people that were into cycling but into 
sports and curious about,

384
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,243
you know,
drug use in sport and performance 

385
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:53,860
enhancing drugs and what they do and 
what they don't do.

386
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,680
So the first run at it,
you had been off cycling for how long?

387
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,193
I had been a,
I had still been training and writing 

388
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:03,370
and writing,
but the first ride out at,

389
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:04,204
I mean I like radically amped up my 
training program for like six months 

390
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:09,874
ahead of time because I was going to do 
this thousand mile race through the 

391
00:21:12,551 --> 00:21:14,890
French Alps.
And in Europe the race called,

392
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,970
called the Haute route.

393
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,270
So you get ready for this now.
When you say clean,

394
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,580
are you taking any supplements?
Multivitamins,

395
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,750
do anything?

396
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,780
Let's say can vitamins has taken the 
Korea team,

397
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:30,720
but I was always doing protein shakes.
I was doing,

398
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:33,420
um,
you know,

399
00:21:33,421 --> 00:21:37,020
all sorts of recovery drinks and you 
know,

400
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,880
essentially training,
uh,

401
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:39,743
you know,
getting my blood monitored and eating 

402
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:43,900
super,
super healthy and you know,

403
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,020
essentially training is as you know,
as scientifically as I could,

404
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,063
um,
without using any sort of illegal 

405
00:21:53,491 --> 00:21:54,324
substances.
And so what kind of results did you get 

406
00:21:57,271 --> 00:22:01,200
the first race?
I got 14 out of 440 guys.

407
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,760
That's pretty damn good.
It was pretty good.

408
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,460
I was destroyed after it,
but it was pretty good.

409
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,040
So then the race is over.
How long after that do you start doping?

410
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,330
Um,
six months.

411
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,700
So you wait six months.
Six months.

412
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:15,534
I wait six months.
Are you training at all during the 

413
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:17,500
interview?
Just really.

414
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:19,530
I'm training,
I'm training,

415
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,393
but I'm filming,
I'm filming interviews because I was 

416
00:22:22,561 --> 00:22:26,130
filming,
I probably had 50,

417
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:26,964
60 interviews that never made it into 
the film because the film took this 

418
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:31,374
pivot.
Have you thought about releasing those 

419
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:36,620
in some way or something like that?
You know,

420
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,530
I've thought about,
you know,

421
00:22:37,531 --> 00:22:38,364
it's,
it's Netflix technically would have the 

422
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,310
rights to that are,
you know,

423
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,350
at least the first right to it.
Um,

424
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,091
so,
you know,

425
00:22:45,091 --> 00:22:48,210
perhaps I would do like a,
a side series.

426
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,103
I'm behind decorous right.
Could you roll out all these various 

427
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,500
interviews because I interviewed so many
interesting people.

428
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,740
Yeah.
Because I was so compelled by the end of

429
00:22:57,741 --> 00:22:58,011
it.
Uh,

430
00:22:58,011 --> 00:22:59,750
you know,
it could have been a series,

431
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,190
I could have,
you could have kept going with it.

432
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,860
Um,
so six months after then you,

433
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:07,130
you get back together with Gregory.

434
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,540
Yeah.
And so I get that exactly.

435
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:14,541
So I get back to Greg Gregory and in the
film you see this skype call and um,

436
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,640
so in a creative filmmaking process,
editorially,

437
00:23:20,641 --> 00:23:22,860
you're always faced with decisions of,
okay,

438
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,113
do I spend 10 minutes of this film on 
all these emails back and forth to 

439
00:23:28,351 --> 00:23:31,500
Gregory before we see him on skype?
Well,

440
00:23:31,501 --> 00:23:33,960
that's not as dynamic is,
boom,

441
00:23:33,961 --> 00:23:35,280
you see I'm on skype.
So,

442
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,520
so,
uh,

443
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,353
that very first call,
which was the very first time I had had 

444
00:23:39,661 --> 00:23:40,494
him on skype and,
and it was the first time that I'd seen 

445
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:46,250
him since Oregon in July,
2014 and now on beginning

446
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:51,250
my protocol and there he is shirtless 
and willing to help me.

447
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:56,830
And at almost that very moment,
this German television,

448
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,220
a show comes out like a 60 minutes 
piece.

449
00:24:01,221 --> 00:24:02,054
I'm called a ard as the station.
And this German investigative reporter 

450
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:10,260
Hio separate who unbenounced to me at 
the time.

451
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:11,094
It had been following the story of 
essentially the possibility of Russia 

452
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,920
having a state sponsored doping program 
had already interviewed Gregory.

453
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,460
And he puts together this like 30 minute
explosive,

454
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,294
like 60 minutes show alleging that 
Russia has a state sponsored doping 

455
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,674
program and that he's working with these
two whistleblowers that basically fled 

456
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:35,930
Russia to go work with him in Germany 
and tell their story.

457
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,890
And these two whistleblowers and now 
like enemies of the state.

458
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,060
And they're worried about their lives 
and there's threats to their lives.

459
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,373
And they essentially start bringing 
forward information about a state 

460
00:24:49,161 --> 00:24:50,060
sponsor program.

461
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,630
And the information is so compelling 
that water,

462
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:56,954
the world antidoping agency launches and
investigation into the claims behind 

463
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:06,350
this German television show and there's 
a backstory to that,

464
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,633
which is the water had had this 
information for four years and they sat 

465
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:17,570
on it because they're essentially embed 
with the IOC and the Olympics.

466
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,793
So the only reason why they finally 
acted on this information out of Russia 

467
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,023
was they were forced to because it was 
now in public and this German show had 

468
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,024
done kind of the equivalent of putting 
it on the front page of a New York 

469
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,440
Times.
And so they had to take action.

470
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,933
So water launches this investigation,
it's now January 2015 and I'm just 

471
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,910
working with Gregory and Gregory shows 
me,

472
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:44,571
he says,
Hey,

473
00:25:44,571 --> 00:25:46,940
have you seen this television show on 
me?

474
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:50,360
And at the time I hadn't.
And I've watched this show.

475
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,340
And there it is.

476
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,433
Areas being alleged as essentially the 
guy who was doping all the Russian 

477
00:25:58,011 --> 00:25:58,844
athletes that he knows everything.
There's athletes on camera saying that 

478
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,740
Dr [inaudible] is the guy you go to.
And,

479
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,023
uh,
and it was a major pivot point in the 

480
00:26:10,941 --> 00:26:14,750
story,
but for me at the time,

481
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,170
I made a very,
very,

482
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,970
uh,
succinct decision which was I'm going to

483
00:26:19,971 --> 00:26:23,000
continue behind the scenes to follow 
this story,

484
00:26:23,001 --> 00:26:25,240
this investigation,
because I didn't know where it was going

485
00:26:25,241 --> 00:26:27,530
to go,
but in the meantime,

486
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,550
I have gregory,
this Moscow scientist,

487
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,850
he's helping me to avoid detection and 
that's the movie that I set out to me.

488
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,020
And so I'm going to stick on that 
journey wall wall,

489
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,153
doubling down on the other side of the 
story should this side of the story 

490
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,340
ended up truly being something.
And so this is essentially a year.

491
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,730
And so he's doping me this entire year 
while he's under investigation wall.

492
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,090
I'm literally going to guys like Dick 
Pound,

493
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,420
who,
who founded water and Richard Mclaren,

494
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,283
who's investigating him and,
and the guys within water and different 

495
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,140
guys in,
in global anti-doping.

496
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,400
And I'm saying,
Hey,

497
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,563
um,
what do you know about this Russia 

498
00:27:17,231 --> 00:27:20,250
investigation?
What do you think of this proves true?

499
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,400
Why do you think Gregory [inaudible] 
involved?

500
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,773
And um,
and none of these people that I'm 

501
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:29,400
interviewing know that I'm working with 
Gregory,

502
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:30,263
they have no idea that I'm doping.
They have no idea that I know Gregory 

503
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,490
and so I'm getting these very,
very candid,

504
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:40,491
honest responses and,
and we cut to November 2015,

505
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,790
um,
and this 335 page report breaks and it's

506
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,624
alleging that he's the mastermind of the
state sponsored doping program in 

507
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:54,120
Russia,
but again,

508
00:27:54,121 --> 00:27:57,810
it's all smoke and mirrors and it's 
mandated to track and field.

509
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,753
And uh,
and that's when things got incredibly 

510
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:05,940
serious.
Putin gets on state television.

511
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,710
It's a huge worldwide story.
Denies that any of this is true,

512
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,440
but he makes a statement stating that if
any of this is true,

513
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,453
that it will be the individuals that are
held accountable and that punishment 

514
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:26,601
will be absolute.
And that was essentially Gregory's death

515
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:27,504
sentence.
And we were skyping and we were talking 

516
00:28:30,511 --> 00:28:31,344
during this entire period as this crisis
is unfolding in Russia and he's forced 

517
00:28:35,341 --> 00:28:38,640
to resign from the lab.
The lab is shut down.

518
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,690
Everybody's let go.
Russia is suspended from world track and

519
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:46,770
field.
Gregory tells me that the KGB,

520
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:50,070
the FSB,
have plotted a suicide,

521
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,160
uh,
a plan to make it look like he's,

522
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,700
that he's killed himself and that he 
needs to get out of Russia.

523
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,950
And how did he know that they had 
planned that?

524
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,290
So Gregory had,
um,

525
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:06,410
FSB clearance because he was essentially
fsp,

526
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,213
he was part of a secret operation by 
Russia to essentially dope all of its 

527
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:16,320
athletes,
have them avoid detection,

528
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,760
swap urine,
etc.

529
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,600
And so gregory was,
you know,

530
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:20,453
had high clearance and other people 
within the fsb that liked him basically 

531
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:25,764
said,
hey,

532
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,610
you got to get out.
And um,

533
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,310
so,
uh,

534
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,410
I got him a plane ticket.
I put them,

535
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:37,050
I put it on my credit card and he 
arrives in los angeles.

536
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:38,790
This is November,
2015 years,

537
00:29:38,791 --> 00:29:41,680
let him fly.
So this,

538
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:46,740
I am sure a to putin and the russian 
ministry officials.

539
00:29:46,901 --> 00:29:49,430
This has probably been the,
uh,

540
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,650
behind closed doors screaming,
shouting matches.

541
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,650
I'm going to cut your head off.
How did you allow this to happen?

542
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,813
Conversation.
But he gets out of Russia five days 

543
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,390
after this,
uh,

544
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,253
335 page report breaks.
And he had been working with the 

545
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:09,730
ministry,
so a,

546
00:30:09,731 --> 00:30:11,920
they didn't consider him a flight with 
b,

547
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:12,754
he was still going to the lab every day 
to clean up the mess and see he had a 

548
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:21,130
visa to come to the United States to 
lecture,

549
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,370
but they weren't thinking that he had a 
visa at that moment.

550
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,233
They weren't viewing him as a flight 
risk even though they put to fsb agents 

551
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,340
living in his home to guard him.
Um,

552
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,500
and it was,
and it was a blip,

553
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,140
was a blip.
They hadn't tagged.

554
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:41,900
his passport had happened so fast.
He had this visa and he,

555
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,730
and you bought the ticket.
So they didn't.

556
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,583
They knew.
They didn't know that he had a ticket 

557
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:46,870
probably.
That's right.

558
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:50,980
Wow.
And he gets out and he gets out.

559
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:52,200
And I'm sure that,
I mean,

560
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,073
there's

561
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:55,400
probably been endless,
uh,

562
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,963
uh,
you know,

563
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,560
uh,
people getting their,

564
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,670
you know,
jobs lost in Russia because this guy was

565
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:05,460
able to get out at the least.
Yeah.

566
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,060
now,
uh,

567
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,090
and that's at the least is a very 
important point because at least one guy

568
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:13,580
wound up dead to,
to what,

569
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,830
what,
and what was the circumstances like very

570
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:17,360
suspicious circumstances,
right.

571
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,180
So,

572
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,013
uh,
so gregory arrives to a los angeles and 

573
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,093
he brings with him a three hard drives 
and on these hard drives essentially is 

574
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:37,150
the irrefutable evidence of essentially 
russia's state sponsored doping program.

575
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,460
And this system,
um,

576
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,650
when I began to truly understand what 
this was,

577
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,053
I mean this upends all of world sport,
this changes whether the olympics want 

578
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,710
to acknowledge it or not.
This changes all oF olympic hiStory.

579
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,750
It changes the last 40 years of the 
olympics Because it basically shows that

580
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:08,590
pretty much every metal ever won by 
Russia in olympic competition was,

581
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,093
was,
was one through a illicit means that 

582
00:32:15,561 --> 00:32:16,394
gregory was behind a state sponsored 
doping program where essentially pretty 

583
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:26,111
much every athlete on the russian 
national team was a,

584
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,074
you know,
an employee of the russian state and 

585
00:32:28,971 --> 00:32:31,870
that Russia had,
um,

586
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,983
you know,
went into each one of these olympic 

587
00:32:34,551 --> 00:32:37,550
games and world competition cheating,
uh,

588
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:42,610
to use sport as a way to assert itself 
geopolitically and as a way to,

589
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,000
to show itself as a strong country.

590
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,590
And we forget.
Um,

591
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,600
I think in the us,
I mean a,

592
00:32:50,601 --> 00:32:53,720
I mean a sport is what people care about
on this planet.

593
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,153
But you know,
orwell said it best at sport is war 

594
00:32:58,911 --> 00:32:59,744
without the weapons.
And if you look at what these olympic 

595
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,640
games are every two years,
it's,

596
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:05,474
it's every country on planet earth 
coming together under the illusion of 

597
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,933
peace and goodwill and harmony.
While the governments are looking at 

598
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:20,120
this as a way to assert geo political 
power and strength.

599
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,373
So if you're China coming into the 
olympics like they did in those beijing 

600
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:29,291
olympics and they swept those beijing 
olympics and from the information that I

601
00:33:29,511 --> 00:33:30,344
have,
the essentially did the same thing that 

602
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:35,000
Russia did in the sochi olympics.
But if you're looking,

603
00:33:35,001 --> 00:33:38,390
let's say at China in those 20 2008 
beijing games,

604
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,643
they spend billions of dollars.
the world has never seen an olympic 

605
00:33:42,981 --> 00:33:43,814
games like those beijing games,
the opening ceremonies and closing 

606
00:33:45,741 --> 00:33:46,490
ceremonies.

607
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:50,540
What that was was that was China showing
the world war first world power.

608
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:54,110
We can kick your ass.
We are have nukes.

609
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,213
We are a global economic force and look 
what we can do world because the entire 

610
00:34:00,351 --> 00:34:04,700
world's eyes are on the olympics being 
watched by billions of people.

611
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,080
You think thAt china's a great country.
Look what we're able to do.

612
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:10,303
And on top of that they needed to win 
because it's not enough just to show 

613
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,390
this infrastructure they can build.
It's also we can,

614
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,224
when we are superior,
and that is what countries have been 

615
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:26,870
doing for the last 40 years in the 
olympic games,

616
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:31,871
just like hitler did in the 1936 games 
that helped unify his power and help,

617
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,730
you know,
bring Germany together.

618
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:35,923
And so this is what the history of the 
olympic games have been shrouding under 

619
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:44,540
this mask of peace and goodwill and 
unity and handshakes.

620
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:45,703
This is countries around the world going
in and showing the rest of the world 

621
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,620
their strength and power and Russia,
uh,

622
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,790
certaInly has viewed that,
uh,

623
00:34:56,090 --> 00:35:00,620
every two years as a platform for Russia
to assert itself geopolitically.

624
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,900
And,
and in so doing,

625
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,520
they put together a state sponsored 
doping program to help you know,

626
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,890
a advance russia's geopolitical goals 
and,

627
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,033
and show itself as a world power.
Is there any evidence that china's done 

628
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:15,944
the same thing or it's just a 
speculation that they've got a state 

629
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,540
sponsored program as well?
Well,

630
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,573
uh,
I personally don't have the evidence 

631
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:28,030
according to gregory and I have no 
reason to doubt gregory,

632
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,903
uh,
especially in light of everything that 

633
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:32,780
he has said has proven to be true.
Uh,

634
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:37,410
he was at the 2008 patient games and 
according to him,

635
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:41,430
what would happen different than what 
Russia did in sochi,

636
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,264
but according to him,
what would happen is that the chinese 

637
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:44,394
athletes,
and if you look at the metal count out 

638
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:48,120
of beijing,
China swept,

639
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,110
swept those olympics just like Russia 
swept their own olympics.

640
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,730
Um,
and,

641
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,350
and,
and,

642
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,490
uh,
accordIng to gregory,

643
00:35:56,491 --> 00:35:57,440
what the russian,
uh,

644
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,770
what the chinese athletes would do is 
they would show up for their,

645
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,993
you know,
their doping test and certain 

646
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,920
collectors,
meaning when the athlete shows up,

647
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,560
they have to be chaperoned and they're 
basically chaperoned.

648
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,540
Nat chaperone,
watches them pee into,

649
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,770
you know,
a contaIner.

650
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,610
And then they put the p in these two 
different bottles.

651
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,400
And this is the whole safeguard system.
According to gregory,

652
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:24,234
what was happening in China is that the,
the collectors were actually chinese 

653
00:36:29,701 --> 00:36:33,420
government agents essentially like 
secret service for China.

654
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,370
And that the athlete would go in to have
his urine collected and this agent would

655
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:41,910
give the athlete a bag of,
of his clean urine,

656
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,010
and the athlete would put that urine 
under his armpit and then collect,

657
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,140
collect the urine.
and,

658
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,463
uh,
and that's apparently what China did in 

659
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:53,544
the beijing olympics according to 
gregory and he had knowledge of a hat 

660
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,000
and that is where the idea started to 
come,

661
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,293
uh,
for how to put into place what they 

662
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:06,070
ultimately did in sochi,
um,

663
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:09,090
where they swapped out clean urine for 
dirty urine.

664
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,650
But they did it in a much more 
complicated matter because of the camera

665
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:14,484
systems,
because of all the technology that was 

666
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,460
in place.
Um,

667
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,130
Russia took it to a whole other step 
further.

668
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,113
Those lids that they had used,
those supposedly unbreakable lids or 

669
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:26,300
anon removable lids.
Yes.

670
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,530
Um,
had they been in pLace before sochi?

671
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,030
Yes.
Yes.

672
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:30,750
So,
um,

673
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:31,890
uh,
uh,

674
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:35,100
whAt,
what we're talking about is in the um,

675
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,230
in when an athlete reports for a drug 
test in sport,

676
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,230
um,
they pinned a one like,

677
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:43,801
like,
uh,

678
00:37:43,801 --> 00:37:44,620
you know,
a,

679
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,760
uh,
a cup and then they separate their urine

680
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:49,650
between an,
a sample and a b sample.

681
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,143
And These two bottles are made by the 
swiss company called berlinger and they 

682
00:37:54,961 --> 00:37:58,350
are kind of the fort knox of urine 
collection bottles.

683
00:37:58,351 --> 00:37:59,184
They've created this tamper proof top.
It seals like it's a vault aNd this has 

684
00:38:04,021 --> 00:38:04,854
been considered the global standard.
There it is right there we can see on 

685
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,070
the screen and these are considered the,
the,

686
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,100
the global standard in world sport and 
they're unpenetrable.

687
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,930
And if you see here on these,
on these bottles,

688
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,960
the a be a sample is allowed to be 
opened by the lab,

689
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,580
right?
So they have the machine,

690
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:30,660
it's this special machine and it cracks 
the top and then you can test it.

691
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:36,250
The beast sample is sealed forever.
It's only to be opened

692
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,143
if the,
a sample turns positive and that b 

693
00:38:39,371 --> 00:38:42,610
sample was put into longterm storage for
10 years.

694
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:46,810
Basically should testing evolve or 
whatever or something come up,

695
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:47,943
they have this b sample to go back and 
test that athlete urine of up to 10 

696
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:55,000
years in the olympic vault in the 
olympic,

697
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,460
you know,
uh,

698
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,750
labs where they've whole holding these 
samples.

699
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:04,740
So basically what Russia figured out is 
that they needed to swap out both the,

700
00:39:05,171 --> 00:39:06,004
a urine and the urine,
but in order to get into those be 

701
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:12,940
samples,
they had to break into these bottles.

702
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,163
So through a couple of years of testing 
and the fsb got involved in a program 

703
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,120
where they figured out using these 
tools,

704
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:26,080
how to essentially break into these 
bottles undetected,

705
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,930
dump out the dirty,
dirty piss,

706
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,930
put in clean piss and reseal these 
bottles.

707
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,063
So both the,
a sample would be negative because that 

708
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:35,944
was swapped and the beast sample had 
been swapped and it was in longterm 

709
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:39,730
storage.

710
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:40,563
So be a sample because if so if they 
removed the top of the bc and they swap 

711
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:45,304
that out,
what do they do with the sample while 

712
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,600
the a sample they.
They were,

713
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:52,770
they were legally able to open it for 
teSting but it was supposed to be tested

714
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:54,730
under,
you know,

715
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,690
a bunch of other people watching.
so what they would do,

716
00:39:58,691 --> 00:40:01,390
and thIs gets into,
into detail into the film,

717
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:06,280
is that they would take basically the,
a sample that was already in this room.

718
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,080
They'd smuggle in the samPle.
The sample shouldn't even been there and

719
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:15,220
they would crack open the a sample,
like they were allowed to crack open for

720
00:40:15,221 --> 00:40:17,440
testing but they would do this at like 
2:00

721
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:22,270
in the morning and they would bRing this
a sample and the sample through a secret

722
00:40:22,271 --> 00:40:23,104
hole in the wall of the room.
Were there or were they were allocating 

723
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,060
the urine.

724
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,893
There's,
there's the holes in the wall and they 

725
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:33,550
would pass these bottles through the 
hole in the wall.

726
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,690
And once they got through the hole in 
the wall on the other side,

727
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:38,524
in this makeshift room,
which was a looked like a storage 

728
00:40:41,171 --> 00:40:42,004
closet,
but there were no cameras in there and 

729
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:44,740
they had designed the whole lab for 
this.

730
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:45,574
I mean this was,
there was a lot of thinking that went 

731
00:40:47,231 --> 00:40:48,610
into this blueprint.
I mean,

732
00:40:48,611 --> 00:40:50,740
gregory showed me the blueprints.
I mean this was,

733
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,590
this was thought out years ahead of time
how to do this.

734
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,993
And they would swap.
They'd bring the bottles into the 

735
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:57,674
storage room.
They would dump out the dirty urine of 

736
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:02,134
the a sample because that was open.
They would put in the clean urine at 

737
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:09,100
that same athlete that they had 
collected about a year earlier.

738
00:41:09,101 --> 00:41:09,934
They would.
They took all the athletes off the drug 

739
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:13,210
and what had them collect clean samples.

740
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:18,810
And Then the b bottle would go out a 
secretly to a kgb building,

741
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,883
an fsb building that was about 100 yards
across the street from where the lab 

742
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:24,820
was,
a secret building.

743
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,330
And there they would open up this b 
sample.

744
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,860
They would dump out the urine,
bring it back to gregory sitting in this

745
00:41:32,861 --> 00:41:33,694
room.
Gregory would then put that same clean 

746
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:38,660
urine into that be bottle,
reseal the be bottle,

747
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,850
put the tuba holes through the hole in 
the lab.

748
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:43,670
They then take the sample,
smuggle it into,

749
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,950
uh,
into where it was supposed to be,

750
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,690
the longterm storage container and all 
the athletes says it negative.

751
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:55,370
Wow.
Now what do they do in the past?

752
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,160
If they did that in sochi,
what did they do in beijing?

753
00:41:58,161 --> 00:42:00,200
What do they do in all the previous 
olympics also?

754
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,110
That's where it,
it's uh,

755
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,690
it's interesting because,
and this is kinda the,

756
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,553
the lance armstrong of it,
or you want to call a v anti-doping 

757
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,440
system,
evasion of it.

758
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,760
Where in the past it was always about 
the science,

759
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:17,630
right?
Which is,

760
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:18,770
okay,
what can you take?

761
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,990
What can you not take?
How long will you wash out?

762
00:42:20,991 --> 00:42:22,360
How long were you,
you know,

763
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:23,760
what can you know?
And,

764
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:26,450
and at what time would you be positive 
and negative?

765
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,580
And that goes into the weeds.
Like,

766
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,473
you know,
hgh is hard to detect after 12 hours if 

767
00:42:32,001 --> 00:42:35,330
you take micro doses of epo,
there's all these,

768
00:42:35,331 --> 00:42:37,100
you know,
different ways around it.

769
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,563
And they were essentially doing that,
but they were doing it on a higher 

770
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:46,610
level.
I'm gregory and this is just again,

771
00:42:46,611 --> 00:42:51,020
the incredible to lives that he was 
leading his.

772
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:54,350
So he's the head of the anti-doping lab 
in Russia.

773
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,333
So he's responsible for testing all of 
russian athletes and international 

774
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,970
athletes coming into Russia,
uh,

775
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:01,903
for competition at the same time he is 
developing test to catch these athletes 

776
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:11,390
and he develops a test called the 
longterm metabolite test.

777
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,603
And what this test does is it increases 
the detection window to detect steroids 

778
00:43:17,661 --> 00:43:18,494
in the blood of athletes.
So prior they could essentially detect 

779
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,660
steroids,
use a about,

780
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,450
it was about a six week window,
something about that,

781
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:29,841
right.
If,

782
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,390
once you hadn't been taken steroids for 
about six weeks,

783
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:33,224
you weren't going to test positive.
He develops this test that is able to 

784
00:43:36,621 --> 00:43:41,000
detect steroid use up to like seven or 
eight months in the system.

785
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,010
and this is different types of steroids.
correct?

786
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:46,430
Because some steroids have a long life 
inside the body,

787
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,080
they're fat soluble.
Exactly.

788
00:43:48,081 --> 00:43:48,914
So he's able to determIne a to,
to develop a test that the longterm 

789
00:43:51,621 --> 00:43:55,490
metabolites that to basically see that 
you took these drugs,

790
00:43:55,491 --> 00:43:56,324
you know,
even if you hadn't taken them for six 

791
00:43:57,561 --> 00:43:58,394
months,
but at the same time that he develops 

792
00:44:00,321 --> 00:44:01,154
this test and this has now been adopted 
on a global level and specifically at 

793
00:44:07,101 --> 00:44:09,560
the,
like the london olympics of 2012.

794
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:10,671
Um,
and,

795
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:12,620
and I think,
don't quote me on this.

796
00:44:12,621 --> 00:44:16,700
I think this test really got approved in
like 2011,

797
00:44:16,701 --> 00:44:17,534
somewhere around there.
And so he puts out this longterm 

798
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:20,803
metabolite tests that's catching all 
these athletes from all over the world 

799
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:25,640
because now they can catch them up to 
six,

800
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,503
seven months.
He figures out the antivenom to his own 

801
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:30,824
tests and what he develops as a three 
drug cocktail where he is able to 

802
00:44:35,821 --> 00:44:40,110
dissolve the steroids in,
in a solution of either vermouth,

803
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,720
martini for the women,
for the men,

804
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:46,650
whiskey for the men.
And He would give the athletes basically

805
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:50,190
the steroids in like a shot in the 
solution of alcohol.

806
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:51,383
And what he figured out through the 
sciences that if the steroids were 

807
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:57,360
taking with alcohol,
they wouldn't actually go into the blood

808
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,970
system.
So you would get all the benefits of the

809
00:44:59,971 --> 00:45:02,580
steroid,
but your body would pass it out.

810
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,840
And I'm very,
very quick time.

811
00:45:03,841 --> 00:45:05,540
And so you were undetectable.
Wow.

812
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:09,330
Yeah.
Wow.

813
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,880
How did he figure that out?
Because he's a genius.

814
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,620
So.
Wow.

815
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,510
So,
so,

816
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,730
so this guy is,
you know,

817
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,770
essentially,
you know,

818
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:21,010
at one time,
you know,

819
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:21,853
so he's figuring out.
So all the russian athletes are 

820
00:45:24,601 --> 00:45:27,790
basically knowing,
you know,

821
00:45:27,810 --> 00:45:28,643
they're on his system.
And so there's taken steroids while the 

822
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:32,874
other athletes,
if they were doing the same thing on a 

823
00:45:34,171 --> 00:45:35,004
global level or getting caught.
And the world system is using the 

824
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,210
methodology the gregory developed.
Wow.

825
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,010
Uh,
and so,

826
00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:49,310
so this was the cat and mouse game going
on for very long time.

827
00:45:49,901 --> 00:45:51,600
And,
and you know,

828
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,250
before that it's,
you know,

829
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,440
it's the microdosing,
it's the lance of it,

830
00:45:55,441 --> 00:45:56,730
it's all the,
the,

831
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,500
how do you,
how do you get away with it?

832
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,570
Um,
but what they did for sochi is they just

833
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:04,051
said,
well,

834
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:05,610
hey,
screw that,

835
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,640
you know,
we don't want to take any chances.

836
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,560
We're going to have our athlete dope,
full tilt so they can be at their very,

837
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:18,210
very best and they're going to be dirty 
as hell,

838
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:21,360
but we're going to swap out their urine.
So there's no,

839
00:46:21,690 --> 00:46:25,110
because in sochi,
Russia controlled the lab,

840
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,600
they basically own the keys to the 
vault.

841
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,010
They were the policemen,
they,

842
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,610
they were the judge,
the jury and the executioner.

843
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:35,510
They had full control and they had a 
record number of goals,

844
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,353
right?
They had a reCord number that they won 

845
00:46:37,090 --> 00:46:39,960
13 goals in sochi,
33 overall metals,

846
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,810
which was the highest of any country.
And,

847
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,970
and for him,
for putin and Russia.

848
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,270
Um,
I think when you go into,

849
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,420
you know,
what's going on in the us and Russia is,

850
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:53,370
there's the,
the cold war is never really ended.

851
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:58,371
It's the illusion of a cold war ending.
And what you're seeing is,

852
00:46:58,830 --> 00:46:59,990
is,
you know,

853
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,950
a country where economically,
um,

854
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,220
it's always Been,
you know,

855
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,150
you have a lot of wealth in a very,
very small number of hands,

856
00:47:09,151 --> 00:47:12,720
but the rest of the country is pretty 
much living in second world conditions,

857
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,653
you know,
once you get out of moscow and st 

858
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,400
peteRsburg and where the,
where the main money is.

859
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,660
But rush on a global level is always 
wanting to assert itself as a,

860
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:24,210
you know,
as a world geo political power.

861
00:47:24,211 --> 00:47:25,830
They have nukes,
they have a lot of,

862
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,980
you know,
uh,

863
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,460
resources,
resources.

864
00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:32,830
And in the case of,
of sochi,

865
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,890
this was a way for essentially putin to 
show like China did on a global level.

866
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,270
Look what we're able to pull off in 
these olympics.

867
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:45,940
They spent $50,
billion dollars on those olympics.

868
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:46,774
Nobody had ever done that.
His approval rating had been on the 

869
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:52,690
decline.
But if he could win the olympics,

870
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,640
he could unify Russia just like Germany 
winning the world cup or any,

871
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,474
you know,
this is because this is what sports is 

872
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:01,930
on a global level,
or you know,

873
00:48:01,931 --> 00:48:03,660
the denver broncos winning the 
superbowl.

874
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:07,510
The patriots winning the super bowl and 
every single person in new england shows

875
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:09,280
up for a parade,
people care,

876
00:48:09,850 --> 00:48:14,850
and so the olympics were putin's way to 
basically show the world that Russia was

877
00:48:15,161 --> 00:48:17,360
an economic power,
superpower,

878
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,440
geopolitical power.
And if those russian athletes could win,

879
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:23,260
that's the same thing of going to war.
That showing that,

880
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,401
that they are,
you know,

881
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:29,200
that Russia is strong.
And so the mandate was win at all costs.

882
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:30,483
Gregory was the mastermind behind that 
program and right after they win those 

883
00:48:34,801 --> 00:48:35,634
sochi olympics,
putin's approval rating sores to 95 

884
00:48:38,681 --> 00:48:43,681
percent and he uses that approval rating
to go into the Ukraine and to,

885
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:46,600
uh,
and to go into war with Ukraine.

886
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,970
I'd never connected those together until
your documentary,

887
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,983
when you were talking about them 
invading crimea instantaneously made me 

888
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:57,733
reconsider the,
the impact of sports like geo 

889
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,600
politically.
Like I really didn't think about it that

890
00:49:02,601 --> 00:49:07,601
way before that movie and a after the 
movie was what stuck with me the most.

891
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:09,043
And one of the most disturbing things is
I remember the news where they were 

892
00:49:11,361 --> 00:49:12,194
talking about kicking them out of Brazil
where they were saying that the 

893
00:49:15,441 --> 00:49:19,550
international olympic committee was 
going to remove all the russian athletes

894
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,593
from competing in Brazil.
And I saw the story and I think we 

895
00:49:23,871 --> 00:49:25,760
probably even talked about it on the 
podcast.

896
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,990
I was like,
this is insane.

897
00:49:26,991 --> 00:49:28,490
Like I'd never.
This is unprecedented.

898
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:29,503
And then

899
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,800
it went away.
Then it went away.

900
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:32,963
And,
and what you see in the film and what's 

901
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:35,634
going on right now,
which is so upsetting in the state of 

902
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,273
the world that we're in right now is his
first is in the film from this 

903
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:51,270
investigation that gets launched from a 
gregory,

904
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,193
uh,
going to the New York times and us 

905
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:54,384
presenting all this evidence.
They launched this a three months 

906
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,310
investigation.
And,

907
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:00,623
um,
I'm essentially behind the scenes kind 

908
00:50:02,461 --> 00:50:05,310
of as a puppet master because gregory 
can't talk.

909
00:50:05,311 --> 00:50:06,144
He's in protective custody.
And so I'm the guy with his lawyers 

910
00:50:09,151 --> 00:50:13,470
helping facilitate all the evidence,
helping to decipher all the documents.

911
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:16,650
And we had hired on a whole team of 
people to do this.

912
00:50:17,130 --> 00:50:21,330
And that's that scene in the movie where
you see where I'm sitting at the table,

913
00:50:21,331 --> 00:50:24,210
but the leaders of water basically,
you know,

914
00:50:24,211 --> 00:50:28,250
telling them that the easter bunny and 
claus and the tooth

915
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,150
fairy don't exist all at the same time.
And uh,

916
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,553
and,
and so this investigation goes on for 

917
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:39,530
two and a half months.
And during this investigation,

918
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,393
richard mclaren gets the samples,
the sochi samples out of the longterm 

919
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,720
storage from the olympics,
the ioc and luzon.

920
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:53,030
They do forensics on these bottles and 
they see the scratches on the bottles.

921
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,390
They see how the bottles were open,
they bring in,

922
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,313
um,
interpol and other agencies and they 

923
00:50:58,911 --> 00:50:59,744
figure out the tools,
how Russia gets into the bottles and 

924
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:04,970
they see all the evidence on the 
bottles.

925
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,910
And then they also find,
um,

926
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:08,880
an,
uh,

927
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:09,713
an,
an extraordinary amount of salt content 

928
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:13,190
in the urine because what gregory was 
doing,

929
00:51:13,191 --> 00:51:14,024
which we don't get into the film,
is in order to make the clean urine 

930
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:19,910
match,
he also had to adjust the gravity of the

931
00:51:19,911 --> 00:51:20,744
urine.
And he would use human table salt to do 

932
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:23,750
that.

933
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,310
And so when they went back and they have
the,

934
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,360
yeah,
when you,

935
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,260
when you,
when you,

936
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,600
when you pee,
depending on how hydrated you are,

937
00:51:29,601 --> 00:51:31,910
dehydrated you are what you ate that 
day.

938
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,133
The gravity,
essentially the weight of your urine 

939
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:38,330
changes.
Basically what the content of what,

940
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,450
what's what,
what your body is dehydrated.

941
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:43,060
People have dark urine,
exact.

942
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:44,830
Is that a thicker urine?
Is that what exactly?

943
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,270
It's like a heavier urine,
right?

944
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,670
So,
so every athlete,

945
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:52,640
when they would give their sample part 
of the doping control forms,

946
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,520
they mark the specific gravity.
Essentially the weight,

947
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,650
the biologic of the airport.
Is it a part of it?

948
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:58,603
A different.
Because the biological passport is 

949
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:01,290
blood,
uh,

950
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:02,930
that's.
And that's measuring blood,

951
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,183
but so,
so they're just measuring the weight of 

952
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:06,200
the urine.
Well,

953
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,103
they're,
they're measuring part of when they do 

954
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:11,990
the intake form on the urine,
they way,

955
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,800
oh,
I see a eloquent.

956
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:14,683
And so that.
So that it's also another thing against 

957
00:52:16,701 --> 00:52:17,534
fraud because okay,
so your specific gravity as I'm making 

958
00:52:21,051 --> 00:52:24,980
this up point o two o.
And that's in that sample will.

959
00:52:24,981 --> 00:52:29,720
So if they were to go back and retest 
that sample and the specific gravity was

960
00:52:29,721 --> 00:52:30,554
wrong,
will they know that something was 

961
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,290
something was up.
So part of swapping the uranus,

962
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,870
he would also adjust the specific 
gravity with table salt.

963
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:43,700
He figured out that salt salt would 
would change the gravity of urine.

964
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:48,230
So because he's trying to match on the 
doping control forms.

965
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,900
exactly.
You know what's in these bottles,

966
00:52:50,901 --> 00:52:54,620
he puts in table salt and when they go 
back and test these samples,

967
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,670
sure enough,
in 100 percent of the samples they test,

968
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:02,600
they find evidence of the scratches,
they find evidence of tampering and they

969
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:07,601
find the table salt in the urine.
So this is,

970
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:13,010
this is like,
I mean this is beyond a reasonable doubt

971
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:18,160
that this system,
this is a slam dunk and it's now the rio

972
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:20,780
olympic games and we're sitting there 
and going,

973
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:21,614
well,
every country in the world is calling 

974
00:53:23,631 --> 00:53:24,860
for Russia to be band.

975
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:30,000
Every antidoping agency around the world
is calling for Russia to be band.

976
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:34,230
Every op-ed and New York times and paper
from around the world is saying you have

977
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:38,940
to ban Russia from rio and thomas bach,
the president of the olympics,

978
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:44,510
essentially a has the aUdacity to call 
these findings and all this evidence,

979
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:49,770
um,
uh,

980
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:54,830
allegationS and does not banned Russia 
from the rio olympics,

981
00:53:55,831 --> 00:53:56,664
allows them in so 281,
I think number 390 athletes go to rio 

982
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,843
and the only athletes that are banned or
the world track and field team because 

983
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:10,680
he kicked the buck down to the sports 
federations to decide what to do.

984
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:11,963
And because this investigation had 
started in track and field track and 

985
00:54:15,631 --> 00:54:19,830
field and sebastian coe upheld the ban 
for the rio games.

986
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,293
And here we are now a year and a couple 
months later and now the olympics are 

987
00:54:28,951 --> 00:54:29,784
trying to decide whether or not to allow
Russia into the next winter olympic 

988
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:34,314
games.

989
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:35,873
And not only have they essentially 
removed richard mclaren from this 

990
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:43,463
investigation.
And he was able to continue the work 

991
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,440
through december.
And in december of,

992
00:54:49,441 --> 00:54:51,000
um,
of last year,

993
00:54:51,001 --> 00:54:54,240
2016,
he is able to release his full findings.

994
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:55,074
And these full findings have 1200 
documents of evidence of emails between 

995
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:04,780
gregory and the ministry emails between,
uh,

996
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,663
you know,
on and on that had been forensically 

997
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:10,350
proven using medidata where these emails
were coming from,

998
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:15,060
the spreadsheets of what every single 
athlete was taking when they were taking

999
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,440
it.
The bottle collection numbers,

1000
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:17,274
I mean,
you're talking because I've seen the 

1001
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:19,500
evidence,
I mean,

1002
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:21,330
it is,
it's a graveyard,

1003
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:22,233
it's mind boggling.
And richard mclaren concludes that over 

1004
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:27,624
1000 athletes across all sports were 
involved in this state sponsored doping 

1005
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,300
operation and the olympics until a 
couple weeks ago,

1006
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:43,950
uh,
had done essentially nothing,

1007
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,263
uh,
with this information they have only 

1008
00:55:48,241 --> 00:55:49,074
trying to figure out essentially how to 
push it under the carpet and pretend 

1009
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:54,990
that this didn't happen.

1010
00:55:55,410 --> 00:56:00,410
How to allow Russia into the next winter
olympics by finding loopholes.

1011
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,520
By saying that you can't,
uh,

1012
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:03,030
you know,
that,

1013
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:05,250
that it should be the individual 
athletes,

1014
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:06,084
right,
etc.

1015
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:06,933
Etc.
and they have an investigation going on 

1016
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:12,170
right now,
uh,

1017
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,013
which is the investigation to 
investigate richard mclaren's 

1018
00:56:15,361 --> 00:56:18,840
investigation,
which was already forensically proven.

1019
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,450
Everything was already shown bond a 
reasonable doubt.

1020
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,170
But to essentially figure out,
um,

1021
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:29,410
whether or not they are going to allow 
Russia into the winter olympics,

1022
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:30,623
um,
and they are finally reaching out to 

1023
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:35,470
gregory even though he has been 
available,

1024
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:36,543
uh,
for a year and three months to speak to 

1025
00:56:39,701 --> 00:56:42,220
them.
They are finally reaching out to him,

1026
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:43,493
uh,
to have him provide the same evidence 

1027
00:56:46,751 --> 00:56:49,290
that he provided to richard mclaren,
uh,

1028
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,163
and the investigators on that team.
So they're very reluctantly pursuing 

1029
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:59,101
this or very reluctantly even 
contemplating banning Russia.

1030
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,830
I think what we're seeing is we're 
seeing,

1031
00:57:03,050 --> 00:57:04,520
um,
you know,

1032
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,120
I,
I set out making a movie,

1033
00:57:07,121 --> 00:57:10,000
exploring the anti-doping system and 
sport and,

1034
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:15,740
and I uncovered essentially the biggest 
scandal in sport history,

1035
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:17,823
but behind that scandal is I'm seeing 
essentially the geopolitics and the 

1036
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:23,374
business interests of all these 
organizations that basically stand for 

1037
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:28,294
one thing.

1038
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,130
They say that they're for something and 
that they're doing everything to protect

1039
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:33,964
their own business interests and do the 
exact opposite of what they say that 

1040
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:37,804
they stand for.
And it calls into question that if the 

1041
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:43,450
olympics are up there going,
play clean,

1042
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,310
be true,
be fair,

1043
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,350
don't do this.
Play by the rules,

1044
00:57:47,351 --> 00:57:49,810
come into this,
to these competitions,

1045
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:50,953
uh,
you know,

1046
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:51,751
uh,
and,

1047
00:57:51,751 --> 00:57:56,751
and respect fellow athletes and then 
they're presented with a scandal on epic

1048
00:57:57,401 --> 00:57:58,234
proportions,
a scandal that changes its entire 

1049
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:05,821
history that has been forensically 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

1050
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:06,993
And then they don't uphold their own 
rules and they don't act or have a 

1051
00:58:10,031 --> 00:58:11,800
punishment for this.
I mean,

1052
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:13,930
you have to ask what's the point of the 
olympics?

1053
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,300
Why even had the olympics?
What,

1054
00:58:16,301 --> 00:58:17,134
why,
why should any athlete on planet earth 

1055
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:19,984
who is competing cleanly,
who's training their whole lives to go 

1056
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:23,464
into these games with the belief that 
they are on at least a level playing 

1057
00:58:27,731 --> 00:58:29,380
field,
uh,

1058
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,550
theoretically.

1059
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,893
Um,
and then you have the organization 

1060
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:38,800
itself not protecting the rights of 
clean athletes.

1061
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:41,080
You have to call into question why,
why,

1062
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:43,090
why have the olympics?
Why?

1063
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,980
What's,
what's the point of it if,

1064
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,050
if this kind of behavior is allowed and 
it's,

1065
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:51,070
and it's an punishable,
what do you think is going on?

1066
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,283
I think that you have billions and 
billions and billions of dollars at 

1067
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,620
stake.
Um,

1068
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,400
you know,
look,

1069
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:03,430
I mean Russia is hosting the world cup 
this summer,

1070
00:59:03,870 --> 00:59:06,550
uh,
vitaly mutko who was the sports minister

1071
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:10,570
who was elevated to essentially the vice
president oF ruSsia,

1072
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,433
the,
the deputy prime minister after this 

1073
00:59:14,711 --> 00:59:17,920
doping scandal to Basically because 
putin took him out of harm's way.

1074
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,680
Um,
you know,

1075
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:24,590
he was sitting on the board of fifa.
He helped Russia get the world cup bid,

1076
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:25,483
you know,
so that they were hosting the world cup 

1077
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:28,370
next year.
This is billions of dollars,

1078
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:29,653
you know,
a pollutant and bach are known to be 

1079
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:32,540
very good friends.

1080
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,430
I mean,
back and the olympics,

1081
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,503
you know,
brought in billions and billions of 

1082
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:40,760
dollars from Russia hosting those sochi 
games.

1083
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,073
You know,
this is,

1084
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,150
this is business.
There is no,

1085
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:48,070
there is no interest in essentially 
just,

1086
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:49,003
you know,
knocking over the apple cart in the 

1087
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:56,021
protection of a fair sport or athletes,
right or fair play.

1088
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,363
And you know,
and the athletes that are essentially 

1089
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:00,883
the victim of,
of a countries geopolitical interests 

1090
01:00:04,430 --> 01:00:06,110
and business interests.
And,

1091
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,600
and I mean we see this across all 
sports,

1092
01:00:08,601 --> 01:00:12,740
but this is a case where it's night and 
day and,

1093
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,280
and you're literally sitting at,
at,

1094
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,400
at evidence that is so staggering in its
scope and scale and an organization that

1095
01:00:23,481 --> 01:00:24,314
is basically like unable to,
to act in any sort of ethical or moral 

1096
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:31,514
capacity to implement any sort of 
justice against what has been thousands 

1097
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,630
and thousands and thousands of athletes 
stolen.

1098
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,793
ThoUsands and thousands and thousands of
metals stolen from clean athletes all 

1099
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:49,610
over the world.
Not just american athletes,

1100
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:50,444
but I mean any athlete and went into 
those games a clean and a rush and beat 

1101
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:55,934
them.
They basically got their metal stolen 

1102
01:00:57,291 --> 01:00:58,124
from them.

1103
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:01,273
Are they hoping that this is just going 
to be swept under the rug and that 

1104
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:08,150
there's going to be more news that sort 
of drowns us out

1105
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:13,280
in my personal opinion.
That's how I see it.

1106
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:14,570
Um,
you know,

1107
01:01:14,571 --> 01:01:19,571
I'm gregory a rut jancov.
He wrote a op-ed to the New York times.

1108
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,530
It was published last week and the head,
um,

1109
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,780
um,
his attorneys,

1110
01:01:26,781 --> 01:01:27,614
because he's in protective custody,
we're able to facilitate this op-ed to 

1111
01:01:31,431 --> 01:01:34,220
the New York times and in the op ed,
if you read it,

1112
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:39,640
he goes into detail about the evidence 
that he's provided a,

1113
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:45,580
the ios sees lack of interest in doing 
anything and essentially,

1114
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:49,800
you know,
his opinion on russia's cover up.

1115
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:50,703
and here we are.
I'm not once has Russia accepted any 

1116
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,730
responsibility for this.
Um,

1117
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,430
in fact,
they've denied that this ever happened.

1118
01:02:01,490 --> 01:02:06,260
They're continuing to blame gregory,
that this is like a solo act.

1119
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:10,520
How could this man have pulled off this 
system,

1120
01:02:10,521 --> 01:02:12,970
this huge elaborate system,
uh,

1121
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:16,100
by himself.
And then in so doing,

1122
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:20,160
after the New York times op ed Russia 
issues

1123
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:24,000
an arrest warrant for gregory,
uh,

1124
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,230
and there's already been criminal 
charges against him in Russia.

1125
01:02:28,530 --> 01:02:31,860
they've seized all of his property and 
assets in Russia.

1126
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,330
They've taken a,
in the process of taking a,

1127
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,460
a,
a,

1128
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,303
a home that he bought for his daughter.
They're trying to take his wife's 

1129
01:02:40,261 --> 01:02:41,094
property.
They took his dacha and this is all a 

1130
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:44,484
man who was working for the russian 
ministry who had the backbone to become 

1131
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:55,190
a whistleblower and we're still in this 
cycle of fake news and denial and I,

1132
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:59,690
and I'm witnessing this on a,
on a daily basis and it's a,

1133
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,133
and it's unbelievable because when you 
look at this story and then you draw a 

1134
01:03:06,661 --> 01:03:11,661
line which is so easy to draw onto the 
current us political climate and what is

1135
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:15,450
going on with russian meddling in our 
election.

1136
01:03:15,451 --> 01:03:16,284
You go,
well,

1137
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:17,273
if Russia was willing to do tHis for the
last 40 years and we have all the 

1138
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:21,744
evidence now that they actually did this
and they have denied it and continue to 

1139
01:03:25,831 --> 01:03:28,140
deny it and don't take any 
responsibility.

1140
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,153
and not only that,
anybody who is who is spoke out against 

1141
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:36,780
them ends up dead or you know,
or they end up in jail or they end up,

1142
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,700
you know,
in a fake news cycle.

1143
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,680
I think it's pretty.
You know,

1144
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:41,514
I,
I think there can be a straighten 

1145
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,610
analogy into,
you know,

1146
01:03:44,611 --> 01:03:46,980
if there's any question as to whether or
not,

1147
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:48,241
uh,
our,

1148
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:53,241
our election was meddled with or whether
or not Russia is able to,

1149
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,940
uh,
to assert its power geo politically.

1150
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:01,380
I think this film answers that question 
and then I'm hoping that,

1151
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:02,633
that,
that our country is gonna wake up and 

1152
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:04,981
go,
hey,

1153
01:04:04,981 --> 01:04:08,010
we're not going to tolerate this.
This is not acceptable.

1154
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:12,510
We're not going to allow a foreign power
to metal into,

1155
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,873
uh,
into our election process or into the 

1156
01:04:17,341 --> 01:04:19,440
potential leadership of this country.
I mean,

1157
01:04:19,441 --> 01:04:20,274
it's,
uH,

1158
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:21,293
it's pretty,
it's pretty scary when you think of the 

1159
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:23,514
bigger implications of,
of what this scandal is an was on a 

1160
01:04:29,371 --> 01:04:32,450
global level.
And then looking at what that means,

1161
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:33,720
you know,
even for America.

1162
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:34,843
Well,
it's essentially highlighting the 

1163
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:36,344
intentions and what the russians are 
willing to do a in sport that the 

1164
01:04:41,361 --> 01:04:42,194
evidence though of doping is so far and 
beyond the evidence that we have so far 

1165
01:04:46,701 --> 01:04:48,380
about election tampering.
Right?

1166
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:49,393
We have evidence of election tampering.
But what you're telling me is just so 

1167
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,163
ridiculously undeniable.
And what your documentary shows is so 

1168
01:04:58,010 --> 01:05:02,720
ridiculously undeniable,
it's just stunning that they're allowing

1169
01:05:02,721 --> 01:05:04,100
the russians to compete.
I mean,

1170
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:04,934
it's,
it's really scary when you really think 

1171
01:05:06,681 --> 01:05:07,880
about it that way.
Meaning like what is,

1172
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:09,200
are they being threatened?
I mean,

1173
01:05:09,201 --> 01:05:11,630
what is it just a simply a money thing 
as you're saying?

1174
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:12,913
I mean when we're talking about 
thousands and thousands of athletes and 

1175
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:18,213
over who knows?
I mean there was recently a couple of 

1176
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:25,290
russian wrestlers had their metals taken
away after the fact because they had new

1177
01:05:27,461 --> 01:05:30,460
detection methods,
I believe it was from,

1178
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:34,120
I want to say 2008 or 2012.
Yeah,

1179
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:35,043
right.
Yeah.

1180
01:05:35,690 --> 01:05:39,420
They're finding a lot of positives in 
2012,

1181
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,750
2008.
It's been a little bit harder because of

1182
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:47,010
statute of limitations on the retesting 
of samples and for,

1183
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,123
for a lot of reasons,
the ioc doesn't really want to go in 

1184
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:50,874
there and get all those samples to 
retest and what there's been so much 

1185
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:56,820
that it proves that the olympics are a 
fraud,

1186
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
but there's been so much in the past.
There's been so many,

1187
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,910
so many allegations of deception and 
fraud.

1188
01:06:02,911 --> 01:06:04,530
When it came to the olympics in the 
first place,

1189
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,010
there's always been some brewing behind 
the scenes,

1190
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:13,280
but you must have been stunned in the 
process of making this documentary about

1191
01:06:14,191 --> 01:06:18,000
one thing.
And then while thiS is happening,

1192
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,420
you know,
just completely,

1193
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:26,070
I mean,
it seems like synchronicity or something

1194
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:30,240
like you just tapped into it at the very
moment that this,

1195
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,560
this dream was becoming a raging river 
public.

1196
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,210
Really.
It was a weird moment because I,

1197
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:39,230
uh,
uh,

1198
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:40,940
like I,
I like Russia,

1199
01:06:40,941 --> 01:06:43,970
I love russian,
have tons of Russia to Russia.

1200
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,370
I've really day guys.
I really do.

1201
01:06:46,371 --> 01:06:46,971
I mean,
you know,

1202
01:06:46,971 --> 01:06:48,030
I mean,
it's god.

1203
01:06:48,031 --> 01:06:48,864
I mean,
I,

1204
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,511
I mean,
I,

1205
01:06:49,511 --> 01:06:52,340
I jusT did.
It's for anybody who's been to Russia.

1206
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,174
I mean,
it's,

1207
01:06:53,370 --> 01:06:54,590
it's pretty awesome.
I mean,

1208
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:59,300
moscow and st petersburg or world class 
cities have so many russian friends,

1209
01:06:59,301 --> 01:07:00,170
so,
you know,

1210
01:07:00,171 --> 01:07:02,450
so we're,
we're caught back up into these cold war

1211
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:06,740
politics where essentially all of us 
individuals,

1212
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,750
you know,
on an individual level,

1213
01:07:08,751 --> 01:07:09,171
go,
hey,

1214
01:07:09,171 --> 01:07:09,980
I,
I,

1215
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:11,660
I love Russia,
I love russian site.

1216
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:13,670
And russians go,
I love americans.

1217
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:17,420
And yeT we're caught up into the 
geopolitics like we were in the cold war

1218
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,553
between our leaders and the government 
workings and the ministry that we have 

1219
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,020
nothing to do with it.

1220
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,890
And,
and what was shocking to me is,

1221
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:29,263
you know,
I think over the last 20 years we've 

1222
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:35,480
viewed Russia as our friend,
that they're,

1223
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,430
you know,
that there are friend.

1224
01:07:37,820 --> 01:07:42,820
And what we're learning now is that it's
been a,

1225
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:49,680
it's been a pretend pat on the back 
while we're seeing the government,

1226
01:07:50,690 --> 01:07:53,460
um,
uh,

1227
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:58,510
do things and we're learning things of,
of russian tampering and involvement,

1228
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,210
um,
that I think that americans,

1229
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:03,920
a year or two ago,
couldn't,

1230
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:05,510
couldn't have imagined.
And,

1231
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:06,913
and the fact that this story that I 
uncovered then collides with the 

1232
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:16,130
election meddling and hacking

1233
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:20,510
and,
and a russian involvement into Syria,

1234
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:21,650
etc.
Etc.

1235
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:23,060
Um,
and that,

1236
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:25,700
those things were all coming together at
the same time.

1237
01:08:25,701 --> 01:08:28,160
I'm in a,
I couldn't have imagined because even as

1238
01:08:28,161 --> 01:08:32,690
I uncovered this scandal and worked to 
expose us,

1239
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:34,130
uh,
and bring it forward,

1240
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:37,010
um,
I had no idea at the time,

1241
01:08:37,430 --> 01:08:38,870
um,
that there would be,

1242
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,800
um,
claims of that,

1243
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:43,520
uh,
that our election was hacked.

1244
01:08:44,110 --> 01:08:47,030
That was never even a discussion before 
this cycle.

1245
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:49,730
That was never even a discussion.
I can imagine that

1246
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,590
now when,
when you,

1247
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,380
when this all came out and you put this 
all together,

1248
01:08:56,381 --> 01:08:59,230
I mean you had to think to yourself 
like,

1249
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,093
what I've just made is going to change 
sports is what I think your documentary 

1250
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,850
is the most powerful anti-doping 
documentary ever made.

1251
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:11,013
I really do.
And I Think what you've done 

1252
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:14,613
fortuitously,
for you to be involved in this and be 

1253
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:21,640
involved with gregory as this was all 
going down.

1254
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:22,983
I mean,
it's really crazy how the two coincided 

1255
01:09:24,761 --> 01:09:28,060
together and produced this staggering 
result.

1256
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:29,373
When you're sitting there at the table 
with all these water guys and you're 

1257
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:33,123
discussing everything,
it's almost like they didn't want to 

1258
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:36,520
hear it.
It's Almost,

1259
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:41,700
it's almost like what you were doing was
exposing incompetence and corruption and

1260
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:42,940
indefensible way.

1261
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,510
That's right,
that's right.

1262
01:09:45,700 --> 01:09:46,840
They,
um,

1263
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:48,383
they didn't want to hear it because it 
basically showed that their system had 

1264
01:09:54,421 --> 01:09:57,990
been utterly ineffective at catching 
cheaters.

1265
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,150
It showed that,
that,

1266
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,660
that they,
it caught them with their pants down.

1267
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:09,000
And um,
and as I got into the weeds on this,

1268
01:10:09,390 --> 01:10:10,223
you know,
you realize that that water essentially 

1269
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,074
as co funded by the olympics have 50 
percent of waters budget is through the 

1270
01:10:17,371 --> 01:10:19,030
olympics.
So they're,

1271
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,580
they're in bed together.
They Are,

1272
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,370
they don't want to do anythIng that's 
going to hurt the other.

1273
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,240
You also realize that there are um,
many board members have water or part of

1274
01:10:29,461 --> 01:10:32,580
the ioc.
So like craig reedy who is the president

1275
01:10:32,581 --> 01:10:37,581
of water,
is also the vice president of the ioc.

1276
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,863
Dick pound who founded water was running
for the presidency of the ioc and was a 

1277
01:10:44,731 --> 01:10:46,980
vice president of the ioc.
So,

1278
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:51,240
so the olympIcs and water or totally 
interconnected to each other.

1279
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,180
And,
and in my opinion,

1280
01:10:54,181 --> 01:10:56,820
or at least what what grigory has told 
me,

1281
01:10:56,821 --> 01:11:01,821
is that water was essentially 
established as an arm of the ioc to help

1282
01:11:03,721 --> 01:11:04,554
protect a sponsorship dollar and to end 
to make the olympics appear as clean as 

1283
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,170
you as up to their

1284
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:18,210
olympic ideals.
So you know what you're seeing it within

1285
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:19,044
these organizations is,
is water has no power to actually do 

1286
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:23,514
anything.
So all that they can do is observe and 

1287
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:26,400
report.
So in the case of,

1288
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,980
of this,
the scandal gets uncovered.

1289
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:34,250
They then do an investigation,
they corroborate everything as truth,

1290
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:39,650
and then they advise the olympics water,
bless their heart,

1291
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:40,763
advise the olympics,
that they should be banned Russia from 

1292
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:46,650
the summer games in rio,
and that they should ban Russia from the

1293
01:11:46,651 --> 01:11:47,484
winter games coming up and launching 
water that was waters recommendation to 

1294
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:54,960
which the olympics did not take that 
recommendation.

1295
01:11:55,470 --> 01:12:00,390
And water doesn't have any power to 
actually enforce punishment.

1296
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:01,613
So in case of,
in the case of Russia and talking to 

1297
01:12:04,531 --> 01:12:05,364
people inside of water that we're 
dealing with this over those four years 

1298
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:11,190
as they're getting all this information 
from Russia.

1299
01:12:11,790 --> 01:12:14,880
but ultimately what is going,
we don't have the budget,

1300
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:16,740
we don't really have the money to do 
this.

1301
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,573
They have like a $25,
million dollar a year global budget for 

1302
01:12:20,131 --> 01:12:23,130
the entire world.
So we don't have the budget to do this.

1303
01:12:23,430 --> 01:12:24,263
We don't have the manpower to do this.
And ultimately we don't have the power 

1304
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,510
to do anything anyway.
Um,

1305
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:32,700
and how are we going to go take on 
Russia?

1306
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:33,534
So they sat on the information realizing
that they were ultimately going to be 

1307
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:40,860
powerless to do anything.
So,

1308
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:41,611
you know,
it's a,

1309
01:12:41,611 --> 01:12:46,611
it's a,
it's a very complicated system because,

1310
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:47,603
you know,
at least from what I've seen is there's 

1311
01:12:49,021 --> 01:12:52,230
so much politics and geopolitics around 
it,

1312
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,490
uh,
that,

1313
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:58,190
that keeps these operations essentially,
um,

1314
01:12:58,390 --> 01:12:59,223
you know,
ineffective and actually really doing 

1315
01:13:00,541 --> 01:13:05,541
something and the anti-doping sport and 
in a almost becomes an ethical and moral

1316
01:13:06,481 --> 01:13:08,080
decision.
Uh,

1317
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:08,933
if the organizations and leaders 
themselves are not really trying to do 

1318
01:13:12,451 --> 01:13:14,000
anything about it.
Wow.

1319
01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,823
Now do you think the banning of the 
track and field team was just a slap on 

1320
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:22,050
the wrist or was that a compromise that 
was reached where they decided,

1321
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,730
look,
we have to do something with,

1322
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,750
what should we do?

1323
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,460
Well,
what had happened is,

1324
01:13:26,461 --> 01:13:27,294
is um,
so the first report was all track and 

1325
01:13:31,231 --> 01:13:32,064
field mandated and,
and there was so much evidence in 

1326
01:13:35,581 --> 01:13:38,040
regards to track and field more than 
other sport,

1327
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:39,743
more than other sports because there was
an individual investigation that only 

1328
01:13:43,771 --> 01:13:44,604
focused on track and field.
And even after they released this 

1329
01:13:47,851 --> 01:13:50,280
investigation,
all of these athletes are saying,

1330
01:13:50,281 --> 01:13:50,820
well,
wait,

1331
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:54,650
you got to go investigate biathlon.
You couldn't go investigate bobsled.

1332
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:55,493
You kind of go investigate speed skating
and wrestling and wrestling and soccer 

1333
01:13:59,341 --> 01:14:01,640
and basketball and everything.
But,

1334
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:04,330
but they didn't do that.
And um,

1335
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:08,190
so there was so much in,
in the track and field investigation,

1336
01:14:08,191 --> 01:14:11,320
the athletics investigation that the 
iwf,

1337
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,040
the international

1338
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:14,320
athletics federation dealing with her 
own scandal.

1339
01:14:14,321 --> 01:14:15,154
If you remember this a few years ago,
the head of the iwf was arrested on 

1340
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:22,510
bribery and lou lamonte dsac and his 
son.

1341
01:14:22,511 --> 01:14:23,620
I'm,
it's a whole thing.

1342
01:14:23,621 --> 01:14:28,621
And sebastian coe became president and 
there was all this proof that the I was,

1343
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,613
had been taking bribes for years and 
years and years to cover up positive 

1344
01:14:32,771 --> 01:14:34,240
results.
And it's,

1345
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,860
that's a whole other story.
Yeah.

1346
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:36,933
So the,
so the iwf upholds the ban and they 

1347
01:14:41,051 --> 01:14:42,500
uphold the ban,
um,

1348
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:43,563
because of gregory's evidence.
So they were trying to figure out 

1349
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:51,481
whether or not to uphold the band and it
was on the eve of the rio olympics and a

1350
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:56,020
gregory through the authorities that he 
was been working with,

1351
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:57,243
uh,
was able to get that evidence and 

1352
01:14:58,481 --> 01:14:59,314
information to the iwf.
The iwf was able to see that and they 

1353
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:07,690
upheld the ban for russia's track and 
field team,

1354
01:15:07,691 --> 01:15:08,700
which you know,
is a,

1355
01:15:08,701 --> 01:15:10,510
is a pretty,
pretty big,

1356
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,050
um,
you know,

1357
01:15:12,130 --> 01:15:12,963
punishment.
At least it's at least it's taking a 

1358
01:15:14,741 --> 01:15:16,810
stance of,
um,

1359
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:19,300
you know,
this kind of behavior is not going to be

1360
01:15:19,301 --> 01:15:20,134
tolerated.

1361
01:15:20,300 --> 01:15:21,410
Some,
some.

1362
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:22,970
Yeah.
Now,

1363
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:28,330
gregory,
what are courageous and bold move on his

1364
01:15:28,551 --> 01:15:29,384
part and what a sacrifice to come forth 
with all this evidence to risk his life 

1365
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:35,930
and to.
I mean,

1366
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:37,910
essentially blow the lid off all of 
this.

1367
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,590
I mean,
if it wasn't for him,

1368
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:40,670
what would you have?

1369
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:42,310
Nothing.
You know?

1370
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:44,260
Um,
it's been,

1371
01:15:44,261 --> 01:15:45,340
uh,
uh,

1372
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,590
you know,
I worry about him every day.

1373
01:15:47,650 --> 01:15:50,880
I'm sure I don't,
I'm not able to talk to them.

1374
01:15:50,881 --> 01:15:52,280
I'm not in contact with them.

1375
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:57,800
You get any messages from anyone else to
him or her or him to you?

1376
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:03,030
I've been told by his attorneys that 
he's healthy and he's in good spirits.

1377
01:16:05,050 --> 01:16:05,883
Um,
I know he's continued to work and 

1378
01:16:07,381 --> 01:16:09,850
provide information to water.
Uh,

1379
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:11,240
apparently,
uh,

1380
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,113
the ioc,
he will be providing information to the 

1381
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:18,990
olympics as part of their investigation.
Um,

1382
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:20,003
I've been told that he's worked with 
global authorities and global police 

1383
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:27,840
agencies to help provide information 
because he has so much information,

1384
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:28,973
not just about Russia but of all sorts 
of other things that were going on of 

1385
01:16:32,820 --> 01:16:36,750
bribes and payments being made.
And you know,

1386
01:16:36,751 --> 01:16:38,490
I'm not a,
you know,

1387
01:16:38,570 --> 01:16:41,070
I don't know what evidence in that 
regard that he has,

1388
01:16:41,071 --> 01:16:42,420
but he at least has the,
you know,

1389
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:43,553
you know,
he knows so much and I know that he has 

1390
01:16:46,141 --> 01:16:46,974
been working.
I'm a effoRtlessly through his legal 

1391
01:16:51,601 --> 01:16:52,434
counsel to provide this information and 
to work with global authorities to work 

1392
01:16:56,641 --> 01:16:57,810
with water.
Uh,

1393
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,610
now hopefully,
uh,

1394
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:01,410
the ioc,
the olympics,

1395
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:03,720
um,
us authorities.

1396
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:04,943
Um,
but,

1397
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:06,203
you know,
I don't know what his life's gonna be 

1398
01:17:08,191 --> 01:17:08,761
like.
Yeah.

1399
01:17:08,761 --> 01:17:09,970
that's,
I

1400
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,350
don't know if in one hole ever be able 
to see his,

1401
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,520
uh,
his family.

1402
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,560
Um,
we launched,

1403
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:16,473
uh,
a month or so ago if anybody's 

1404
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:21,550
interested on my,
um,

1405
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:23,980
on my twitter page,
uh,

1406
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:27,400
we launched a go fund me for gregory,
uh,

1407
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:29,510
through an organization called fair 
sport.

1408
01:17:30,070 --> 01:17:33,290
Um,
that fair sport was launched by,

1409
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:36,650
uh,
one of the producers on my film and,

1410
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,800
uh,
uh,

1411
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:38,723
and a guy by the name of johann koss 
who's been a huge advocate and 

1412
01:17:41,991 --> 01:17:42,824
anti-doping and spirit fair sport was 
basically launched to help other 

1413
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:50,090
whistleblowers in sport come forward 
with information,

1414
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:53,120
but also to help,
uh,

1415
01:17:53,150 --> 01:17:53,983
gregory in this ongoing battle.
We're being told that we need to get 

1416
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:02,960
that he needs to get money to his wife 
for a,

1417
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:04,640
for an attorney,
for legal help.

1418
01:18:04,910 --> 01:18:07,670
And she's stuck in russian passport 
awaY.

1419
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,980
They won't let her leave.
That's what we're being told,

1420
01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,990
uh,
we're,

1421
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:14,930
you know,
so he has a,

1422
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,580
you know,
incredible legal bills and other,

1423
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:21,830
uh,
help that he needs.

1424
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,430
ANd so we've launched this go fund me to
try to,

1425
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:30,030
to try to provide him a lifeline over 
the next years,

1426
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:33,860
years.
um,

1427
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,290
because,
um,

1428
01:18:35,830 --> 01:18:36,710
you know,
his,

1429
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,170
his future is so uncertain.
I mean we're,

1430
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:41,450
where's he going to live,
how's he going to live,

1431
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,020
how's he going to pay his bills?
And,

1432
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:46,590
and he wants to continue to,
um,

1433
01:18:47,330 --> 01:18:48,920
um,
you know,

1434
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:50,260
be,
you know,

1435
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,890
kind of frank aboriginal,
you know,

1436
01:18:52,010 --> 01:18:52,843
a guy who had committed wrong doings,
but he was under the orders of the 

1437
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,234
ministry,
but he has a lot of information that he 

1438
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,590
risked his life to bring forward to the 
world because he felt a,

1439
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:07,640
a,
a,

1440
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:12,320
a huge burden to,
to do this and he wanted to do this.

1441
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:14,870
This was his,
this was his doing.

1442
01:19:14,871 --> 01:19:19,871
And ultimately he entrusted me as his,
a conduit to bring this story forward.

1443
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:23,113
And,
and also gregory has attempted suicide 

1444
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:27,690
in the past.
So you're,

1445
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:30,650
you're an under much less dire 
circumstances.

1446
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:31,573
Yeah.
He's essentially a wanted man right now 

1447
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,700
with no freedom.
I mean he,

1448
01:19:37,701 --> 01:19:38,534
uh,
he's in hiding and the russians most 

1449
01:19:42,321 --> 01:19:43,000
likely

1450
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,260
dead absolutely.
Um,

1451
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:50,530
you know,
you see on this response to his New York

1452
01:19:50,531 --> 01:19:53,450
times op ed that they would,
um,

1453
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:57,070
there had been a lot of,
a few followed the news and Russia.

1454
01:19:57,071 --> 01:19:59,770
They had already taken lots and lots of 
action against him to,

1455
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:01,660
you know,
kind of silence him to,

1456
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:07,110
to make him irrelevant in the film.
I think one of the most moments

1457
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:10,950
and um,
was as a,

1458
01:20:11,010 --> 01:20:13,500
at the end of every year a putin gives 
a,

1459
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,730
a huge press conference with hundreds of
journalists and,

1460
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,310
and the doping scandal gets brought up 
of course.

1461
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,320
And he goes,
and this is just,

1462
01:20:22,321 --> 01:20:23,820
you know,
six months ago goes,

1463
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:26,370
oh,
the guy who defected,

1464
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:29,040
the citizen who defected,
uh,

1465
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:32,820
the scientists,
I don't even remember his name.

1466
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,170
And you're literally going there.
Are you kidding me?

1467
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:41,190
putin just says he doesn't remember 
gregory's name yet.

1468
01:20:41,490 --> 01:20:46,020
Yet gregory dominated russian news for 
the past year.

1469
01:20:46,021 --> 01:20:50,400
He has been front page story for first 
solid year.

1470
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:55,320
This has been the single biggest scandal
and sport and in russian history,

1471
01:20:55,321 --> 01:20:56,154
he's arguably the biggest whistleblower 
in the history of Russia and you have 

1472
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:00,653
the president of a country saying he 
doesn't even remember his name and what 

1473
01:21:04,081 --> 01:21:07,710
that is is that's george orwell,
1984.

1474
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:12,480
That's double think.
That's essentially fake news.

1475
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:13,343
That's pretending that by not 
acknowledging you know him is not to 

1476
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:22,980
acknowledge the truth and that is what 
is going on in this world.

1477
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:27,450
And so here you see the potent look 
straight to the camera and say,

1478
01:21:27,451 --> 01:21:28,284
I don't even remember gregory's name.
I mean that would be the equivalent of 

1479
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:32,933
of,
of asking an american who's our 

1480
01:21:35,011 --> 01:21:37,740
president right now,
and somebody saying,

1481
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:40,500
I don't.
I don't remember his name.

1482
01:21:41,070 --> 01:21:44,790
I mean that is that as the level of lies
and deception,

1483
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,073
and then you see their reaction to the 
New York times op ed by issuing an 

1484
01:21:49,801 --> 01:21:54,801
arrest warrant for gregory to again 
paint him as a criminal to again pretend

1485
01:21:55,741 --> 01:21:57,330
that this didn't happen.
To again,

1486
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:58,164
try to obstruct the truth and shift the 
focus away from the truth and the 

1487
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:02,724
punishment and what all this evidence is
in his bravery of coming forward and 

1488
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:09,960
instead try to turn him into,
into a criminal.

1489
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,730
Uh,
so it's,

1490
01:22:11,731 --> 01:22:12,550
um,
it's,

1491
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:16,200
it's startling and it's a.
And it's incredibly upsetting.

1492
01:22:16,201 --> 01:22:18,660
It was one of the reasons why we,
you know,

1493
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,523
really latched onto 1984 orwell in the 
film because everything that is that is 

1494
01:22:25,891 --> 01:22:29,040
gregory's life was double thing,
but everything that's going on in our,

1495
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,090
in our geo political cycle and with 
Russia and putin,

1496
01:22:33,091 --> 01:22:34,560
it's,
it's double think it's,

1497
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:37,380
it's the,
the truth is no longer the truth.

1498
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,273
And you don't know what,
what news to believe or what not to 

1499
01:22:40,741 --> 01:22:41,210
believe.

1500
01:22:41,210 --> 01:22:43,110
This is obviously very unexpected for 
you,

1501
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:43,963
mean you set out to do one documentary 
and another thing reveals itself in the 

1502
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:49,820
middle of it and something incredibly 
serious.

1503
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,130
Well,
what is the impact of this been like for

1504
01:22:52,131 --> 01:22:52,964
you?
I mean the weight of this all carrying 

1505
01:22:54,741 --> 01:22:55,700
this around with you?

1506
01:22:58,450 --> 01:23:00,390
It's been a lot,
uh,

1507
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:02,583
from the,
from november of last year when gregory 

1508
01:23:05,410 --> 01:23:06,243
to

1509
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:11,550
los angeles to us ultimately going to 
the New York times and um,

1510
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:14,830
in may of last year,
May,

1511
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:15,551
2016,
uh,

1512
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:19,570
there was about a seven month period 
where myself and my,

1513
01:23:20,050 --> 01:23:23,050
uh,
my producing partner,

1514
01:23:23,051 --> 01:23:27,250
dan cogan with impact partners and uh,
uh,

1515
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:28,690
uh,
my other producers,

1516
01:23:28,691 --> 01:23:31,570
jim swartz and david fiasco,
um,

1517
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:32,613
we had this information in the 70 
[inaudible] and we knew what this was 

1518
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:37,923
and we knew how big it was.
And so was this period of about seven 

1519
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:46,090
months of a daily crisis navigation of 
a,

1520
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:50,020
how do we keep this information 
protected?

1521
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,290
We moved our production offices three 
times.

1522
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:55,740
We moved gregory into different safe 
houses.

1523
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:56,683
You move into production offices.
Could we didn't know if we were under 

1524
01:23:59,921 --> 01:24:00,754
surveillance?
Did you feel like you're under 

1525
01:24:01,421 --> 01:24:03,820
surveillance?
Felt like we were under surveillance?

1526
01:24:03,821 --> 01:24:06,340
Yeah.
What was giving you in done indication?

1527
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,900
It was,
you know,

1528
01:24:07,901 --> 01:24:09,550
we'd see like a car.

1529
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:13,690
I'm gregory who was not in protective 
custody at the time,

1530
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:14,813
uh,
was getting information from his people 

1531
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:18,070
out of Russia that they were,
you know,

1532
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,440
that they were looking for him,
that they were,

1533
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,020
you know,
a concerned,

1534
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:25,000
um,
and,

1535
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:28,900
and we knew the gravity of what this was
like.

1536
01:24:28,901 --> 01:24:29,734
I,
I,

1537
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:34,880
I underStood once I dove into this 
evidence with gregory how big this was,

1538
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:35,980
like,
what,

1539
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,190
what this truly meant.
Um,

1540
01:24:38,191 --> 01:24:39,490
and,
and,

1541
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:41,110
uh,
and that I felt that,

1542
01:24:41,130 --> 01:24:43,270
you know,
Russia and the olympics,

1543
01:24:43,271 --> 01:24:47,050
but Russia would probably do anything at
all costs to try to,

1544
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:48,573
you know,
not have this come forward because what 

1545
01:24:49,871 --> 01:24:50,704
this meant and it meant that their 
olympic games were fraud and that they 

1546
01:24:53,801 --> 01:24:58,801
had been cheating global sport for the 
entire modern history.

1547
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:00,970
Um,
and uh,

1548
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:05,710
and that it showed the extent to which 
Russia and the ministry was willing to,

1549
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:06,940
you know,
to,

1550
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:10,210
to tamper in international affairs,
not just sport.

1551
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:13,390
And so I,
I understood that and gregory understood

1552
01:25:13,391 --> 01:25:16,150
that.
And so it was a daily crisis management.

1553
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:17,733
We went through about five months where 
we couldn't even get them a lawyer 

1554
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:22,053
because every law firm that we would go 
to would have some sort of confLict of 

1555
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:26,590
interest with russiA.
Um,

1556
01:25:27,370 --> 01:25:30,130
we uh,
couldn't.

1557
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:33,010
It was,
it was a really,

1558
01:25:33,070 --> 01:25:35,740
really intense.
And during that time,

1559
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:41,160
two of his friends die within two weeks 
of each other of heart attacks at age 52

1560
01:25:41,621 --> 01:25:45,610
and 59.
And nikita kumbaya of who's 52 years old

1561
01:25:45,611 --> 01:25:49,210
and he's running,
he had resigned from running the russian

1562
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,650
antidoping agency.
So,

1563
01:25:51,010 --> 01:25:51,843
so technically the russian anti-doping 
agencies shouldn't be working with 

1564
01:25:54,551 --> 01:25:57,280
gregory's lab,
the water,

1565
01:25:57,281 --> 01:26:00,490
the world antidoping agency lab,
those should be two independent things.

1566
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:05,770
But these two were working together 
because there was never any anti-doping.

1567
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:08,930
Russia was the anti anti doping system.

1568
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:14,030
Posing is anti-doping.
So nikita is still in Russia.

1569
01:26:14,031 --> 01:26:17,720
he's been forced to resign and gregory 
and him are still talking via,

1570
01:26:17,830 --> 01:26:19,820
uh,
via skype.

1571
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:24,890
And nikita tells gregory that he's going
to go,

1572
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:29,120
but he's writing a book and that he's 
been in contact with David Walsh.

1573
01:26:29,121 --> 01:26:33,680
And David Walsh is the sunday times 
journalists that chased armstrong for 10

1574
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:34,514
years.
He's probably one of the most renowned 

1575
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:40,700
famous sports journalists in the world.
The stephen frears film,

1576
01:26:40,701 --> 01:26:41,534
the programs based on David Walsh and 
send to kieta had reached out to David 

1577
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,050
Walsh and him and David Walsh.
We're making a plan to meet.

1578
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,060
And nikita had told gregory that,
you know,

1579
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,540
he was going to meet with David Walsh.
Gregory was like,

1580
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:54,830
this is,
you can't do this.

1581
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:57,080
You're still in Russia and nikita,
you're still in Russia.

1582
01:26:57,081 --> 01:26:59,840
What are you doing?
And a day later,

1583
01:26:59,841 --> 01:27:04,550
nikita dies of a heart attack.
And this was a guy who was healthy.

1584
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:07,220
A had never had a heart problem in his 
life,

1585
01:27:07,221 --> 01:27:09,140
was a,
it was a lifelong athlete.

1586
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,063
Never when he was 50 2:52,
and apparently he died over about three 

1587
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:14,990
and a half hours.
Well,

1588
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:19,310
a nikita's wife was on the phone to 
gregory crying.

1589
01:27:20,020 --> 01:27:20,853
Uh,
so this is a really have any suspicion 

1590
01:27:23,571 --> 01:27:25,630
of how they did it.
Um,

1591
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:27,860
you know,
gregory goes out and they just,

1592
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:30,860
you just die of a heart attack.
They poisoned yo whatever they,

1593
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:33,530
you know,
I don't know how they do it,

1594
01:27:33,531 --> 01:27:34,970
but you know,
Russia isn't like isis.

1595
01:27:34,971 --> 01:27:37,680
They don't do something and then take 
responsibility for obviously,

1596
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,823
you know,
there's been so many stories like in 

1597
01:27:39,891 --> 01:27:43,400
buzzfeed last year,
then have the 14 deaths in london,

1598
01:27:43,401 --> 01:27:44,720
all tied to,
you know,

1599
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,093
various had the series of Russia.
There's been multiple books written on 

1600
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:49,700
it.
Um,

1601
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:51,460
even,
uh,

1602
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:53,600
you know,
which was not widely reported.

1603
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,393
The russian agent that offered a,
apparently the trump dossier with the 

1604
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,130
[inaudible],
the former of my six agent,

1605
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:02,533
uh,
he was found dead in the back of alexis 

1606
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:08,330
about five months ago outside of moscow.
Um,

1607
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,070
so,
you know,

1608
01:28:10,610 --> 01:28:11,980
clearly they,
they,

1609
01:28:12,070 --> 01:28:14,060
they,
they play by a diffeRent set of rules.

1610
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:14,953
And,
um,

1611
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:15,803
so this is all going on as we're 
figuring out how to bring this story to 

1612
01:28:19,641 --> 01:28:21,230
the world.
and,

1613
01:28:21,640 --> 01:28:22,970
um,
the,

1614
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:24,170
our,
our government,

1615
01:28:24,171 --> 01:28:27,650
the us government gets involved with 
department of justice and fbi.

1616
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:33,040
They started investigating and um,
we realized that,

1617
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:34,093
uh,
that we have to bring this story public 

1618
01:28:36,110 --> 01:28:41,110
and that it's the best way for gregory 
to hopefully be protected and uh,

1619
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:43,490
and that once it's public,
it's,

1620
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,890
it'll be in the world.
And,

1621
01:28:45,891 --> 01:28:46,760
uh,
so we brought,

1622
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:47,873
uh,
to the New York times with gregory and 

1623
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:53,690
sat with them for three days and then 
they broke the story and then,

1624
01:28:54,110 --> 01:28:55,280
uh,
as a film,

1625
01:28:55,281 --> 01:28:59,810
we then followed that story as it,
as it unraveled.

1626
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:00,673
But,
um,

1627
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,400
yeah,
it's been a,

1628
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,000
it's been very,
it's been very heavy and uh,

1629
01:29:06,520 --> 01:29:11,520
I'm very worried about gregory and also 
a incredibly frustrating to see that,

1630
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,583
um,
what you kind of read about conspiracy 

1631
01:29:19,831 --> 01:29:24,570
novels and you read about and you know,
all these guys who believed that,

1632
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:25,740
you know,
uh,

1633
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:26,760
everybody,
uh,

1634
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:31,620
you know of how the system works and 
then getting to witness this firsthand.

1635
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:32,873
Uh,
and also I think as an athlete having 

1636
01:29:34,621 --> 01:29:35,454
kinda my olympic ideal of what the 
olympics is being shattered and seeing 

1637
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:42,780
that this organization really has no 
regard for,

1638
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,510
for anything other than their own 
business interests.

1639
01:29:46,750 --> 01:29:47,583
Now,
how much time does gregory hAve in 

1640
01:29:51,131 --> 01:29:52,420
protective custody?
they do.

1641
01:29:52,421 --> 01:29:57,421
They have a determined time period where
they're willing to protect him.

1642
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,023
I mean,
it's the us government is protecting 

1643
01:30:00,181 --> 01:30:01,014
him,
I assume,

1644
01:30:01,390 --> 01:30:03,820
um,
to my understanding,

1645
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:05,680
um,
you know,

1646
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:09,190
that is a,
that that is the case.

1647
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:10,083
But,
um,

1648
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:14,710
I am not being given a updates,
um,

1649
01:30:14,950 --> 01:30:16,930
and uh,
and I don't,

1650
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,110
you know,
I,

1651
01:30:18,110 --> 01:30:20,570
I don't want to have that informatIon.
Um,

1652
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,633
but,
uh,

1653
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,730
you know,
uh,

1654
01:30:23,770 --> 01:30:24,603
I,
I'm very optimistic that whole continue 

1655
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:30,250
to be okay and that,
uh,

1656
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:33,160
and that also with,
if something were to go wrong,

1657
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:37,710
we'll be able to help him with that,
um,

1658
01:30:37,900 --> 01:30:39,910
you know,
through his counsel and team.

1659
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:41,950
Um,
but it's,

1660
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,340
it's certainly very concerning.
um,

1661
01:30:45,090 --> 01:30:46,660
you know,
I think he,

1662
01:30:46,661 --> 01:30:47,494
you know,
he clearly understood the risks before 

1663
01:30:48,941 --> 01:30:50,730
coming forward.
Um,

1664
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:51,603
we had tried to get his family out of 
Russia and they didn't understand the 

1665
01:30:54,551 --> 01:30:56,360
gravity of the situation,
um,

1666
01:30:56,430 --> 01:30:58,870
which I'm sure they do now.
and,

1667
01:30:58,871 --> 01:31:00,240
um,
you know,

1668
01:31:00,250 --> 01:31:01,001
I don't,
I don't,

1669
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:02,410
uh,
I don't know.

1670
01:31:02,411 --> 01:31:03,640
I mean,
he's a,

1671
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:04,660
uh,
you know,

1672
01:31:04,661 --> 01:31:06,160
in the film,
you fall in love with them.

1673
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:10,270
You just fall in love with this guy and 
you see him for who he is,

1674
01:31:10,271 --> 01:31:15,271
whIch was incredibly important for me as
the filmmaker and as his friend was.

1675
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:18,183
I knew that it would be very easy to 
paint him into an illusion of somebody 

1676
01:31:21,611 --> 01:31:25,390
that he wasn't some despicable guy doped
all the russians,

1677
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:26,643
and then what you see in the film is 
truly this loving kind character who 

1678
01:31:33,610 --> 01:31:38,610
essentially is caught up in a,
in a system that he helped perpetuate,

1679
01:31:41,381 --> 01:31:42,214
but he certainly didn't create and that 
he is ultimately an employee of the 

1680
01:31:46,511 --> 01:31:48,880
russian government.
And uh,

1681
01:31:48,881 --> 01:31:51,760
and he was doing his job and that was 
his job.

1682
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:55,290
It's a,
it's such a complex issue.

1683
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,950
And when you put all the pieces out on a
table and you just,

1684
01:31:58,020 --> 01:31:58,853
you've taken into account all the 
different variables with doping and 

1685
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:05,050
trying to catch these people and what 
the future holds.

1686
01:32:05,051 --> 01:32:07,330
And then what you were talking about 
with epo,

1687
01:32:07,331 --> 01:32:08,164
with some sort of a biological way to 
get your body a genetic way to get your 

1688
01:32:10,871 --> 01:32:13,330
body to reproduce the same sort of 
chemicals.

1689
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:17,470
It,
it seems like there's no real solution.

1690
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:18,363
Like you,
you'll lay it all out and you look at 

1691
01:32:19,810 --> 01:32:20,643
what happened in sochi.
You look at what's going on right now 

1692
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:25,840
with the olympics,
allowing the russians still competing in

1693
01:32:25,870 --> 01:32:29,460
the brazilian games.
Even after all this and just not.

1694
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:31,570
It doesn't seem like,
Oh,

1695
01:32:31,571 --> 01:32:33,170
this has to happen.
Or oh,

1696
01:32:33,171 --> 01:32:35,890
you just put this over there.
You just look at this big mess.

1697
01:32:36,220 --> 01:32:36,801
And he go,
where,

1698
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:37,720
where does this go?

1699
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,343
you know,
I,

1700
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:42,260
I think that that is a,
a valid question.

1701
01:32:42,261 --> 01:32:46,020
And because when you,
when you start to look at where it goes,

1702
01:32:46,830 --> 01:32:51,600
first of all,
I really believe in,

1703
01:32:52,290 --> 01:32:54,870
you know,
the concept behind clean sport.

1704
01:32:54,871 --> 01:32:55,704
Like I really,
I really believe in that and I believe 

1705
01:32:57,331 --> 01:32:58,650
that,
um,

1706
01:32:59,070 --> 01:33:01,920
that,
that athlete should go and,

1707
01:33:02,380 --> 01:33:05,640
uh,
and compete clean because those,

1708
01:33:05,970 --> 01:33:07,380
those are the rules.
I mean,

1709
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:08,250
you know,
you know,

1710
01:33:08,270 --> 01:33:08,731
you,
you,

1711
01:33:08,731 --> 01:33:11,070
you come from bma world and all men,
you know,

1712
01:33:11,100 --> 01:33:14,760
you're going into a fight.
You at least it's enough of a fight.

1713
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:18,150
It's a fight that had at least,
you know,

1714
01:33:18,151 --> 01:33:18,984
you want to believe that you're shaking 
the guy's hand and that and that if he 

1715
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:24,960
kicks you out,
if he kicks your ass,

1716
01:33:24,961 --> 01:33:27,630
he kicks your ass.
But he did it through hard work,

1717
01:33:27,740 --> 01:33:29,970
through hard work and planned by the 
rules,

1718
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:30,804
you know,
and,

1719
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,290
and that's the,
the,

1720
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:33,153
the concept I think that fans go into 
watching sports and that athletes in 

1721
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:37,890
general go,
go into,

1722
01:33:37,950 --> 01:33:38,940
go into sport.

1723
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,130
Um,
and,

1724
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:44,520
and,
but we have the flip side of that,

1725
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:46,380
which is,
you know,

1726
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:51,920
human beings are in a constant.
We're not done evolving.

1727
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:53,920
Um,
there's a,

1728
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,340
a great,
a philosopher,

1729
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:58,110
futurist,
but he's also an investor.

1730
01:33:58,111 --> 01:34:02,010
His name's juan and rica as if you've 
seen his ted talks and stuff and,

1731
01:34:02,580 --> 01:34:03,300
and,
uh,

1732
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:05,970
really interesting.
And he geTs into how,

1733
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:07,313
uh,
and he makes this whole scientific 

1734
01:34:08,671 --> 01:34:11,580
argument about how human beings are not 
done evolving.

1735
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,040
The,
we're just not done involvement.

1736
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:13,883
We believe that we've done involving,
but he shows through history how we're 

1737
01:34:17,431 --> 01:34:20,280
not done evolving just like we went 
from,

1738
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,173
you know,
frOm neanderthals and humans and done 

1739
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:25,093
it,
you know,

1740
01:34:25,130 --> 01:34:28,260
and he goes through the whole history of
it and he shows how basically humans are

1741
01:34:28,261 --> 01:34:29,094
not done evolving and part of that not 
being done evolving as we're constantly 

1742
01:34:32,881 --> 01:34:35,160
figuring out how to live longer.
We're,

1743
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:36,233
I sat with a guy yesterday who said the 
problem isn't whether or not human 

1744
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:42,120
beings are going to start living to 110 
or 120 years old.

1745
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:44,370
The problem Is,
is that we're figuring out how to,

1746
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:45,383
how to keep our body healthy,
but we haven't figured out how to keep 

1747
01:34:48,571 --> 01:34:49,404
our minds healthy and that all of these 
people that are going to be living 

1748
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:55,470
longer lives.
There's the problem with alzheimer's now

1749
01:34:55,471 --> 01:34:58,100
and dementia that you know,
even though you live longer

1750
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,880
life,
your,

1751
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,530
your brain is still deteriorating.
The point being is that we're in it.

1752
01:35:02,570 --> 01:35:03,403
We're in an age of,
of medical and scientific technology 

1753
01:35:06,771 --> 01:35:09,530
that every single day is another 
invention.

1754
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:13,100
Another advance and you know,
for $200,000

1755
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:15,440
or whatever it is right now,
uh,

1756
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:18,050
in the embryo,
you can change your kid's eye color.

1757
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:19,033
You can go in and decide that your kid 
is going to be six foot and I'm five 

1758
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:22,890
[inaudible] eight,
you know,

1759
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:23,631
I mean,
wow,

1760
01:35:23,631 --> 01:35:27,260
I would have loved my parents do have to
have to have seen to it that,

1761
01:35:27,690 --> 01:35:29,300
that,
that I was six feet tall,

1762
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:30,710
um,
you know,

1763
01:35:30,711 --> 01:35:33,440
and all these kinds of things that are 
going on right now.

1764
01:35:33,441 --> 01:35:37,220
And in the medical science and 
technological advancement world,

1765
01:35:37,690 --> 01:35:39,980
um,
there were also things that the world is

1766
01:35:39,981 --> 01:35:40,814
going to have to start figuring out what
they do on the fields of play and 

1767
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:48,350
athletic because the humans of the 
future,

1768
01:35:48,970 --> 01:35:53,360
um,
are going to be better versions of,

1769
01:35:53,780 --> 01:35:56,210
of what we have right nOw just through 
science,

1770
01:35:56,211 --> 01:35:57,044
just through technology.
And then the question again goes into 

1771
01:35:59,661 --> 01:36:02,150
the world of what's clean,
what's not clean,

1772
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:03,710
what's,
you know,

1773
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:06,770
what's anti-doping,
how do you police sport.

1774
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:09,440
And those are very hard questions to 
answer.

1775
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:10,620
Yeah,
they really are.

1776
01:36:10,770 --> 01:36:13,800
And you don't.
On one hand,

1777
01:36:13,801 --> 01:36:17,670
you don't want to stop medical 
technological progress,

1778
01:36:17,880 --> 01:36:19,710
right?
You don't want to stop people from being

1779
01:36:19,711 --> 01:36:20,544
able to cure diseases and it's almost 
like some of the technology that they 

1780
01:36:26,521 --> 01:36:27,354
use for aerospace makes its way into 
everyday use or some of the technology 

1781
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:36,630
that they're going to use for all these 
different medical innovation.

1782
01:36:36,631 --> 01:36:39,600
So there's different ways to cure 
diseases and increase human performance.

1783
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:40,623
They're gonna make their way into 
athletics and it's going to be a very 

1784
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,520
blurry line.
But you know what is natural,

1785
01:36:44,521 --> 01:36:45,870
what's not natural.
I mean,

1786
01:36:45,871 --> 01:36:46,704
if your parents decide to genetically 
all to you in the womb and change you 

1787
01:36:50,341 --> 01:36:52,260
into a super athlete,
is that your fault?

1788
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:54,810
And if it's not your choice or your 
fault,

1789
01:36:54,811 --> 01:36:55,644
should you be allowed to compete.
That was always the argument about 

1790
01:36:57,721 --> 01:36:59,160
carolyn,
you know,

1791
01:36:59,270 --> 01:37:02,040
alexander and his parents were like 
five,

1792
01:37:02,041 --> 01:37:03,600
five and five,
six.

1793
01:37:03,810 --> 01:37:04,643
They were these tiny people and he was a
fucking giant and a gorilla and they 

1794
01:37:09,811 --> 01:37:13,350
used to call him in Russia.
They used to call him the experiment and

1795
01:37:13,351 --> 01:37:16,020
if you look at corella and you look at 
him physically,

1796
01:37:16,021 --> 01:37:16,854
I mean there's very few athletes you're 
ever going to see that look like that 

1797
01:37:19,591 --> 01:37:20,490
guy.
I mean,

1798
01:37:20,491 --> 01:37:22,890
he was close to 300 pounds,
move like a cat,

1799
01:37:23,220 --> 01:37:26,730
and would literally launch grown men 
through the air.

1800
01:37:26,731 --> 01:37:27,564
They were so terrified of his physical 
prowess that grown men used to flatten 

1801
01:37:32,071 --> 01:37:32,904
out on their stomach and literally try 
to cling to the earth to avoid being 

1802
01:37:36,211 --> 01:37:37,740
thrown by him.
Are you aware of him?

1803
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:39,750
No.
Look at this motherfucker.

1804
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:44,210
Yeah.
He was undefeated in,

1805
01:37:44,230 --> 01:37:48,570
in the olympic games up until rulon 
gardner beat him who was an american and

1806
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:50,910
who to go to that picture which shows us
full body,

1807
01:37:51,120 --> 01:37:52,830
which shows his legs and that image.

1808
01:37:53,190 --> 01:37:56,860
There's a black and white that have up 
there now that there,

1809
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:59,190
uh,
several,

1810
01:38:00,180 --> 01:38:02,760
I forget when he took.
This is all.

1811
01:38:02,980 --> 01:38:03,540
No,
no.

1812
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:04,660
Go to the.
There's a full,

1813
01:38:04,980 --> 01:38:07,680
full image of that.
Jamie [inaudible] try to find that image

1814
01:38:07,681 --> 01:38:08,514
on the right.
but there's a full one where you get to 

1815
01:38:09,421 --> 01:38:12,360
see his entiRe build.
I mean,

1816
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,223
he was a fucking freak and so his thing 
was throwing these men and he's a 

1817
01:38:18,811 --> 01:38:21,210
heavyweight,
sO these guys are 300 plus pounds.

1818
01:38:21,540 --> 01:38:26,540
He would throw them through the air like
in a way that very few people could do.

1819
01:38:27,061 --> 01:38:29,220
Look at that picture of him with his arm
raised right below that,

1820
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:33,540
the black and white.
He was fucking monstrous.

1821
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:36,240
Wow.
And without a doubt,

1822
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:38,460
choose to the tits.
I mean,

1823
01:38:38,461 --> 01:38:39,294
no question about especially given the 
information that was disclosed in your 

1824
01:38:42,961 --> 01:38:45,630
documentary.
I mean this was all,

1825
01:38:45,631 --> 01:38:48,270
I believe.
I believe he was through the eighties or

1826
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:51,900
the nineties and into the early two 
thousands when he retired.

1827
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:54,143
But um,
I mean he was a freak of all freaks and 

1828
01:38:56,940 --> 01:39:01,470
the most terrifying man and all of a 
russian amateur wrestling for sure.

1829
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:02,453
Everybody was afraid of him.
This is him standing above the greatest 

1830
01:39:06,211 --> 01:39:07,980
mixed martial arts heavyweight of all 
time.

1831
01:39:07,981 --> 01:39:09,080
Fader,
a million ankle.

1832
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:11,120
And you'd see how much bigger he is in 
fader.

1833
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:14,290
The,
he was a fucking giant with the cv.

1834
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:15,990
You could find a picture of him with his
parents

1835
01:39:16,120 --> 01:39:16,953
because it was the.
And the story was always that he was 

1836
01:39:18,131 --> 01:39:19,390
basically a genetic mutant.

1837
01:39:19,610 --> 01:39:20,900
well,
the day did something,

1838
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,540
I mean,
no one mean it was so long ago.

1839
01:39:23,541 --> 01:39:26,270
It's very difficult to ascertain what 
was capable,

1840
01:39:26,690 --> 01:39:27,523
what was possible back then.
But his performance in wrestling was 

1841
01:39:32,781 --> 01:39:35,180
just stunning.
I'm obviously trained hard,

1842
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:36,860
obviously very skilled.
I mean,

1843
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:38,083
one of the things about russian 
wrestlers is not just the fact that 

1844
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:43,730
their physical prowess,
but they're incredibly technical.

1845
01:39:43,910 --> 01:39:48,680
Some of the most technically advanced 
wrestlers in the world in terms of their

1846
01:39:48,681 --> 01:39:49,514
tactics and the way they would drill.
I mean they really had it down to a 

1847
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:57,410
science and there was so much gravity to
it all.

1848
01:39:57,411 --> 01:39:58,700
It was so,
so important.

1849
01:39:59,150 --> 01:39:59,983
And on top of that choose to the tits.
So there was so many factors that came 

1850
01:40:03,591 --> 01:40:05,150
into play.
And uh,

1851
01:40:05,210 --> 01:40:10,210
when you're talking about this state 
sponsored russian doping program,

1852
01:40:11,060 --> 01:40:11,893
I mean,
you have to really think and include 

1853
01:40:13,131 --> 01:40:15,980
corella and in that because he was just 
a massive,

1854
01:40:15,981 --> 01:40:17,400
massive part of it.
Yeah.

1855
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,253
I'm sure you know when people have 
always speculated for for many years 

1856
01:40:22,131 --> 01:40:22,964
like fate or who is arguably the 
greatest heavyweight of all time was a 

1857
01:40:26,660 --> 01:40:27,493
competing and pride,
which was an openly dirty leak when 

1858
01:40:30,291 --> 01:40:31,124
pride was opposite the ufc.
The ufc had very rudimentary testing at 

1859
01:40:34,281 --> 01:40:35,114
the time.
What they would essentially do is do 

1860
01:40:35,871 --> 01:40:40,871
urine testing at the way in which a 
victor conte famously said is just a.

1861
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:42,210
An intelligence

1862
01:40:42,210 --> 01:40:42,930
tests.
I know,

1863
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:43,970
I know victor.
Yeah,

1864
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:45,150
well,
I got to meet him.

1865
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:46,770
I got to know him pretty well through 
this.

1866
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:49,680
He had victory to the podcast a few 
years back and was talking about,

1867
01:40:49,681 --> 01:40:52,830
and this is pre usada now the ufc is 
hired,

1868
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:53,793
saw to individ ski and jeff novitsky has
done a fantastic job and unfortunately 

1869
01:40:57,530 --> 01:41:01,150
just caught John Jones who won.
We won the title,

1870
01:41:01,151 --> 01:41:01,984
knocking out daniel cormier.
They stripped him of his title and now 

1871
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:06,190
cormier is going to be the champion 
again.

1872
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:07,024
That's.
It's so fucking confusing and distorted 

1873
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:10,900
because in,
in mixed martial arts,

1874
01:41:10,901 --> 01:41:13,540
as opposed to any other sport,
even wrestling,

1875
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,070
wrestling,
your health is on the line,

1876
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:17,680
but nowhere near as much as it is in 
mixed martial arts.

1877
01:41:17,860 --> 01:41:18,693
So the cheating,
it's not a matter of a guy getting 

1878
01:41:19,811 --> 01:41:20,644
across the finish line faster than you.
It's a matter of a guy landing blows or 

1879
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:28,900
woman lending blows that they would not 
have been able to land had they not been

1880
01:41:28,901 --> 01:41:31,120
cheating.
And it gets very,

1881
01:41:31,121 --> 01:41:31,954
very tricky because you're talking 
essentially about not just illegal 

1882
01:41:34,691 --> 01:41:35,950
activity,
not just cheating,

1883
01:41:36,490 --> 01:41:39,550
but potentially assault.
And what if someone dies,

1884
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:40,593
like,
what if someone is doping and it's 

1885
01:41:42,701 --> 01:41:43,534
proven that they're doping and the 
beating they give their opponent leads 

1886
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:46,864
that opponent dying.
You can make a real argument that 

1887
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:53,080
manslaughter charges at the very least 
should be filed if not murder.

1888
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:54,721
Yeah,
I mean,

1889
01:41:54,721 --> 01:41:55,320
uh,
I mean,

1890
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:58,550
uh,
it's certainly the implications are met.

1891
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:01,690
So you could certainly make that 
implication and you know,

1892
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,260
and in this story,
even the,

1893
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:05,393
the idea wheRe you have thousands of 
athletes essentially waking up and 

1894
01:42:10,411 --> 01:42:11,244
going,
wait,

1895
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:12,593
maybe I would've,
I would've gotten metal and how diana 

1896
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:16,103
metal,
what would be different in my life 

1897
01:42:18,511 --> 01:42:20,340
today,
which changed their whole world.

1898
01:42:20,341 --> 01:42:21,840
It's changed the whole world.
It's,

1899
01:42:21,841 --> 01:42:23,280
it's,
it's,

1900
01:42:23,281 --> 01:42:25,180
and that is why you know,
this,

1901
01:42:25,190 --> 01:42:26,023
this problem is so I think hard and 
difficult to combat because when you 

1902
01:42:30,211 --> 01:42:32,130
look at what is at stake,
the,

1903
01:42:32,131 --> 01:42:34,350
the economics at stake,
but you know,

1904
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:36,680
the,
the box of wheaties essentially that,

1905
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:37,561
that,
you know,

1906
01:42:37,561 --> 01:42:40,720
going in and nobody remembers,
remember second place.

1907
01:42:40,721 --> 01:42:42,330
It doesn't mean anything to me.
Anything.

1908
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:45,150
It means nothing.
It's all one win or you don't.

1909
01:42:45,210 --> 01:42:46,170
Yeah,
you win or you lose.

1910
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:49,200
And if you win comes all the,
you know,

1911
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:51,540
uh,
spoils.

1912
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:54,660
And if you'Re not the winter,
you might as well have almost never been

1913
01:42:54,661 --> 01:42:54,900
there.

1914
01:42:54,900 --> 01:42:55,733
Well in indifferent than the other 
athletic endeavor endeavor because 

1915
01:42:58,261 --> 01:43:01,470
essentially it is their life,
but it's not professional.

1916
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:05,810
Which is a really weird thing because 
you have so much money involved.

1917
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:06,663
the olympics,
billions and billions of dollars are 

1918
01:43:07,951 --> 01:43:10,890
going into the hands of people who don't
even fucking compete,

1919
01:43:11,190 --> 01:43:13,890
which is insane.
It's unlike any otheR athletic pursuit.

1920
01:43:14,130 --> 01:43:19,130
If you look at professional sports,
I mean whether it's the nba or boxing or

1921
01:43:19,621 --> 01:43:20,454
what have you.
The vast majority of the money goes to 

1922
01:43:22,951 --> 01:43:27,000
the athletes themselves right now,
not in the olympics and the olympics.

1923
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:28,740
Fucking zero.

1924
01:43:28,890 --> 01:43:29,870
No,
it's just insane.

1925
01:43:29,871 --> 01:43:32,040
It's like college basketball.
It's insane.

1926
01:43:32,041 --> 01:43:32,874
Oh,
it's purely an honor to be in the 

1927
01:43:36,451 --> 01:43:40,950
olympics to go to the olympics and the 
athletes themselves,

1928
01:43:41,310 --> 01:43:42,143
you know,
and this is why it's actually you're 

1929
01:43:43,621 --> 01:43:46,080
able to understand a state sponsored 
system,

1930
01:43:46,081 --> 01:43:46,914
which I think the american mentality is 
hard to understand because here we're 

1931
01:43:49,441 --> 01:43:50,274
looking at $205,000,000
nba contracts and sport is privatized 

1932
01:43:55,611 --> 01:43:56,444
and the athletes get paid and that even 
when you go to the olympics as an 

1933
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:03,680
american athlete,
you might be competing for America,

1934
01:44:03,950 --> 01:44:07,430
but America is not paying your way to 
the olympics.

1935
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:08,264
You're nOt on the us payroll.
Michael phelps is not being paid by the 

1936
01:44:11,571 --> 01:44:14,480
us government to go compete in the 
olympics,

1937
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:17,300
but in China,
in Russia,

1938
01:44:17,690 --> 01:44:21,640
in a an any essentially,
you know,

1939
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:23,750
post communist,
communist,

1940
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,180
any,
any sort of country like that.

1941
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:31,400
The athletes are employees of the 
Government and they're essentially state

1942
01:44:31,401 --> 01:44:32,234
employees and their job is to go and 
compete for their country and they're 

1943
01:44:35,511 --> 01:44:36,530
being paid to do so

1944
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:40,840
and the the spoils are so incredibly 
large for the athletes,

1945
01:44:40,841 --> 01:44:41,674
even in America that people are still 
going to be willing to put it on the 

1946
01:44:44,201 --> 01:44:45,034
lawn and compete because you could be 
that Michael Phelps guy that winds up 

1947
01:44:47,351 --> 01:44:50,560
getting incredibly rich and famous from 
winning the olympics.

1948
01:44:50,590 --> 01:44:51,423
So people are willing to compete and 
essentially risk their physical body 

1949
01:44:56,740 --> 01:44:59,020
risk all of their time,
their effort,

1950
01:44:59,021 --> 01:44:59,854
their dedication to try to accomplish 
something that all the world's going to 

1951
01:45:03,961 --> 01:45:04,794
be watching,
massive profits being made and they 

1952
01:45:07,271 --> 01:45:09,940
don't see a fucking penny of it unless 
they win.

1953
01:45:10,090 --> 01:45:11,840
That's right.
When they.

1954
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,020
It's a consequence of them winning that 
they see that.

1955
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,760
Exactly.
But if a win,

1956
01:45:16,690 --> 01:45:20,560
if you're simone biles,
if you're phelps,

1957
01:45:20,561 --> 01:45:25,390
if you're any one of these athletes and 
basically sport that people don't really

1958
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,210
watch and there's money behind any 
other,

1959
01:45:28,480 --> 01:45:30,850
any other time of the year other than 
the olympics,

1960
01:45:30,851 --> 01:45:33,820
every four years people care about 
gymnastics.

1961
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:36,250
They don't care about gymnastics any 
other time.

1962
01:45:36,251 --> 01:45:38,660
But once every four years,
everybody cares about jim.

1963
01:45:38,661 --> 01:45:40,450
Now who's watching swimming.
Exactly.

1964
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,260
Nobody gives a fuck.
Nobody cares about swimming.

1965
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:44,440
But once every four years they care 
about swimming.

1966
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:46,960
And if you can go in and capitalize on 
that,

1967
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:51,130
you have a live.
It's just so if you don't,

1968
01:45:51,260 --> 01:45:52,093
you don't.
I mean that's the whole kind of 

1969
01:45:54,910 --> 01:45:59,910
armstrong a basketball player for the 
Australia team.

1970
01:46:00,111 --> 01:46:02,980
He's actually an mba player putting 
together a shower curtain for his.

1971
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:05,560
Wherever he was staying in on the side 
here,

1972
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:08,800
describes the 196,
a cabin,

1973
01:46:08,801 --> 01:46:12,340
nine index super ship that the men and 
women's us basketball teams were staying

1974
01:46:12,341 --> 01:46:15,490
on and had 250 police officers watching 
them.

1975
01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:21,910
And I didn't say who paid for that 
either.

1976
01:46:22,970 --> 01:46:24,500
Well enough.
They paid for their own know.

1977
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:25,633
Who knows?
But the point being that the olympics 

1978
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:32,480
are essentially a professional endeavor 
where the athletes,

1979
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:37,130
the ones who people are watching are not
getting any of that money and it's a,

1980
01:46:37,131 --> 01:46:40,130
it's a dirty organization in that regard
because this is not amateur.

1981
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,110
It was amateur.
The world would see it for free.

1982
01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:45,290
I mean it's not.
you have to pay some money.

1983
01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:48,360
I don't know how many billions and 
billions and billions of dollars.

1984
01:46:48,540 --> 01:46:49,373
I can't.
The contract could staggering what nbc 

1985
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:55,530
paid for the olympic rights for the next
however many games it is.

1986
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:56,453
Yeah.
And what they get paid from the 

1987
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:59,180
advertiser.
And that's just the us.

1988
01:46:59,210 --> 01:46:59,750
Yeah.

1989
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:01,910
That's just you.
So on a global level,

1990
01:47:01,911 --> 01:47:06,911
this is the most watched sporting.
This is the most watched event on planet

1991
01:47:07,131 --> 01:47:07,964
earth.
Nobody world cup soccer and the 

1992
01:47:10,131 --> 01:47:10,964
olympics,
but the olympics even more so most 

1993
01:47:12,651 --> 01:47:15,920
watched event on planet earth.
And it's,

1994
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,960
there it is,
seven point seven,

1995
01:47:17,961 --> 01:47:19,880
$5,
billion through 20,

1996
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:20,723
32

1997
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:22,510
bc paid.
Wow.

1998
01:47:23,050 --> 01:47:24,490
stunning.
I mean it's,

1999
01:47:24,491 --> 01:47:26,310
I don't know what the solution is,
but it never.

2000
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:30,160
It never sent set right with me.
I always felt like it was gross.

2001
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:31,263
I mean,
it just didn't make any sense that 

2002
01:47:31,901 --> 01:47:33,670
everyone is getting paid,
but the athletes,

2003
01:47:34,150 --> 01:47:35,410
it's a,
it's essentially,

2004
01:47:35,411 --> 01:47:38,260
they've,
they've managed to keep it this way.

2005
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:42,400
They had this situation in place a long,
long time ago,

2006
01:47:42,730 --> 01:47:47,730
and then it became this massive global 
business is huge empire and they managed

2007
01:47:48,371 --> 01:47:51,650
to keep the athletes out of the loop.
It's,

2008
01:47:51,710 --> 01:47:53,890
it's really,
it's really a mess.

2009
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:55,380
And,
and not only that,

2010
01:47:55,470 --> 01:47:56,303
there were so many people that have 
profited to the tunes of millions and 

2011
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,113
millions of dollars through the 
essentially bribery of other countries 

2012
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:07,583
into,
you know,

2013
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:08,753
all the politics behind that to protect 
their athletes so that the athletes can 

2014
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:13,620
continue to,
to win medals.

2015
01:48:13,700 --> 01:48:18,700
I'm gregory told me a story,
Um,

2016
01:48:19,170 --> 01:48:20,003
whIch i,
I wonder when this will come true 

2017
01:48:21,930 --> 01:48:22,763
because I certainly can't verify it,
but he told me a story of a former 

2018
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:28,440
olympic medical director and the guy 
apparently,

2019
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:29,783
uh,
was the head medical director of the 

2020
01:48:31,141 --> 01:48:34,950
olympics for like 15 years or something.
And according to gregory,

2021
01:48:34,951 --> 01:48:37,100
this gUy liveS in a,
uh,

2022
01:48:37,140 --> 01:48:40,380
an Incredible chateau,
a somewhere in,

2023
01:48:40,410 --> 01:48:41,550
uh,
in Switzerland.

2024
01:48:41,910 --> 01:48:44,930
It's like a mind boggling house.
And um,

2025
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:49,890
um,
and he's lIke an orthopedic doctor,

2026
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:53,580
but he's the head medical director of 
the olympics and according to gregory,

2027
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:58,560
he's accepted millions and millions and 
millions of dollars in bribes,

2028
01:48:58,970 --> 01:48:59,803
uh,
through different countries to conceal 

2029
01:49:01,231 --> 01:49:06,231
positives over all these various olympic
games that whatever it was,

2030
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:07,074
you know,
uh,

2031
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:09,510
uh,
Slovakia or whatever,

2032
01:49:09,511 --> 01:49:10,344
there'd be a positive in this guy would 
get a half a million dollars to conceal 

2033
01:49:13,681 --> 01:49:13,840
it.

2034
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,530
There's a positive here and he'd take 
the money and conceal it.

2035
01:49:17,130 --> 01:49:19,280
And uh,
and uh,

2036
01:49:19,281 --> 01:49:20,114
I wouldn't be surprised if that's,
I'm sure it's just the tip of the 

2037
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:24,714
iceberg because this is huge money in 
these countries are willing to pay this 

2038
01:49:28,471 --> 01:49:33,471
big money because for a country like 
Russia or China or,

2039
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:37,410
you know,
even Jamaica,

2040
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,303
right to win medals,
what that does for its country on a 

2041
01:49:42,391 --> 01:49:44,670
world level.
All of the sudden when jamaica's winning

2042
01:49:44,671 --> 01:49:46,350
medals,
everybody's going,

2043
01:49:46,351 --> 01:49:47,184
wait,
we,

2044
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,000
we want to go to Jamaica.
I mean,

2045
01:49:49,300 --> 01:49:50,133
just what that jamaican team did 
probably did for tourism dollars to 

2046
01:49:54,431 --> 01:49:56,590
Jamaica,
if you could add.

2047
01:49:56,620 --> 01:49:57,940
I mean,
it's staggering,

2048
01:49:58,170 --> 01:50:01,420
right?
It made Jamaica and victor conte,

2049
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:02,680
we'll talk about this,
you know,

2050
01:50:02,681 --> 01:50:07,000
in detail how the fast five fastest 
runners on planet earth are jamaican and

2051
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:10,630
content will go right.
And don catlin goes,

2052
01:50:10,631 --> 01:50:11,464
yeah,
right.

2053
01:50:11,680 --> 01:50:13,490
But,
but look at the money that,

2054
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:18,220
that had to have brought Jamaica of the 
tourism,

2055
01:50:18,221 --> 01:50:19,580
of advertising,
of,

2056
01:50:19,930 --> 01:50:21,910
of interest of everybody's going,
wait,

2057
01:50:21,911 --> 01:50:22,990
I want to go to Jamaica.
Oh,

2058
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:24,550
I should go to Jamaica.
I should go see,

2059
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:25,950
you know,
where,

2060
01:50:25,970 --> 01:50:27,490
where,
where did these peOple come from?

2061
01:50:27,610 --> 01:50:28,900
Yeah.
where did they come from?

2062
01:50:28,901 --> 01:50:30,010
Yeah.
You know,

2063
01:50:30,011 --> 01:50:30,844
when a fader was the king of the world 
as far as the heavyweights in mixed 

2064
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:35,044
martial arts,
I,

2065
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:39,820
putin was regularly at his fights and it
was always like this big deal that putin

2066
01:50:39,821 --> 01:50:42,370
was there and fado with smash these 
people,

2067
01:50:42,371 --> 01:50:45,710
especially when fate or fought in Russia
and um,

2068
01:50:46,030 --> 01:50:46,781
you know,
I mean,

2069
01:50:46,781 --> 01:50:47,614
it's a massive,
massive deal to have a top fighter or 

2070
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:54,310
top athlete representing your country.
I mean,

2071
01:50:54,311 --> 01:50:58,060
it's just a huge deal for,
for you to have the number one guy.

2072
01:50:58,440 --> 01:50:59,880
Oh,
absolutely.

2073
01:50:59,881 --> 01:51:00,714
I mean,
you look at,

2074
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,750
you know,
I'm like a sharapova,

2075
01:51:03,810 --> 01:51:04,930
you know,
and uh,

2076
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:06,490
um,
you know,

2077
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:09,090
gregory would,
would tell me stories of,

2078
01:51:09,091 --> 01:51:12,510
you know,
how many he knew for years would,

2079
01:51:12,540 --> 01:51:13,980
would,
what she was taking,

2080
01:51:13,981 --> 01:51:17,460
what she was up to.
He was advising her family.

2081
01:51:17,461 --> 01:51:20,910
I'm just a according,
according to him,

2082
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:24,090
she even lied about her age.
I don't,

2083
01:51:24,190 --> 01:51:25,023
uh,
that apparently the age that she was 

2084
01:51:26,641 --> 01:51:30,270
playing at that she is reported as a,
uh,

2085
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,133
as a couple of years younger that,
that was all part of Russia helped with 

2086
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:35,790
that.

2087
01:51:35,790 --> 01:51:36,623
WAsn't there a situation with serena 
williams were the testers came to her 

2088
01:51:39,631 --> 01:51:43,020
house and she locked herself in a safe 
room and called the police.

2089
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:44,520
Oh,
I didn't hear that one,

2090
01:51:44,521 --> 01:51:45,241
but yeah,
it was,

2091
01:51:45,241 --> 01:51:49,260
it serena or venus was serena.
See if he could find that story.

2092
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:50,393
Yeah.
The task force showed up at her house 

2093
01:51:51,391 --> 01:51:52,350
and she's like,
not now,

2094
01:51:52,360 --> 01:51:56,040
motherfucker click locked yourself in a 
safe room.

2095
01:51:57,180 --> 01:52:00,480
You got to think about the amount of 
money that's involved in these things.

2096
01:52:00,481 --> 01:52:02,380
And you know,
if you know that other people,

2097
01:52:02,381 --> 01:52:06,870
serena williams lOcks herself in panic 
room and drug test mix up.

2098
01:52:07,740 --> 01:52:09,240
Oh,
it's just a mix up.

2099
01:52:09,241 --> 01:52:11,610
Ladies and gentlemen,
that our los angeles manchin,

2100
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:13,750
no worries.
Mansion.

2101
01:52:13,780 --> 01:52:14,613
The tennis legends assistant at 6:00
AM local time last wednesday and told 

2102
01:52:19,111 --> 01:52:19,944
the emergency operator that a prowler 
had been spotted at the luxurious 

2103
01:52:23,431 --> 01:52:24,264
property.
She retreated to her panic room and a 

2104
01:52:26,611 --> 01:52:31,410
bid to protect herself for that is where
they are Giving her every benefit of the

2105
01:52:31,411 --> 01:52:32,244
doubt.
and that one,

2106
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:35,130
I mean it's,
it's hard.

2107
01:52:35,190 --> 01:52:37,060
It's really.
But the intruder train hold on,

2108
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:38,993
turned out to be a random drug test who 
stopped by unannounced for a urine 

2109
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:46,821
sample to.
Well you the cops responded on them on.

2110
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:50,090
But the quickly left the property when 
the misunderstanding was discovered,

2111
01:52:50,091 --> 01:52:52,550
it was not known whether or not william 
submitted to the drug test.

2112
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:54,560
Well that's.
yeah,

2113
01:52:54,620 --> 01:52:55,453
I mean she didn't.
If it's not known that means she didn't 

2114
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:02,400
or potentially in the panic room,
but lots of saline solution.

2115
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:06,183
But I couldn't imagine if you're 
thinking about the amount of money that 

2116
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:13,490
a certain person who is a world renowned
athlete in whatever sport it is,

2117
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:16,310
I mean the amount of money that's 
involved as fucking staggering.

2118
01:53:16,311 --> 01:53:18,500
And if you have stringent drug testing,
you know,

2119
01:53:18,550 --> 01:53:19,383
that's why the John Jones,
it was so disheartening because jon 

2120
01:53:22,250 --> 01:53:24,320
jones,
who's arguably,

2121
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:27,620
if not the greatest mixed martial arts 
fighter of all time,

2122
01:53:27,621 --> 01:53:29,240
he's number two,
you know,

2123
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:30,733
maybe mighty mouse is number one.
But you would say that mighty mouse is 

2124
01:53:32,811 --> 01:53:34,970
not faceless kind of competition that 
john has.

2125
01:53:35,090 --> 01:53:37,460
So that would put john into number one,
a lot of people's eyes.

2126
01:53:37,970 --> 01:53:41,780
But to have him test positive like that 
was so disheartening for people and just

2127
01:53:41,781 --> 01:53:46,040
such a heartbreaker because people had 
just hoped and prayed that,

2128
01:53:46,041 --> 01:53:48,050
you know,
him coming back and winning that way.

2129
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:50,090
Like maybe he'll get his shit together.
You know,

2130
01:53:50,091 --> 01:53:50,924
when you see a guy with massive 
potential and he's been involved in all 

2131
01:53:52,911 --> 01:53:56,150
these fuck ups in the past.
Maybe finally he's got his shit together

2132
01:53:56,650 --> 01:54:01,650
or maybe what happened is he is.
He came back and he realized that he was

2133
01:54:03,101 --> 01:54:03,934
never going to be what he was going to 
be and that whole psychology kicked in 

2134
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:12,450
and I think he,
you know,

2135
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:14,530
you see that in,
in,

2136
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:15,373
in so many guys.
I think that once you've been on that 

2137
01:54:17,291 --> 01:54:21,010
program or you understand that program,
I think it's probably very,

2138
01:54:21,011 --> 01:54:23,980
very hard psychologically to go off of 
it.

2139
01:54:23,981 --> 01:54:25,330
And also,
you know,

2140
01:54:25,350 --> 01:54:27,550
you're always going to be pushing those 
limits.

2141
01:54:27,551 --> 01:54:29,620
It's always the,
the icarus story.

2142
01:54:29,710 --> 01:54:31,150
Um,
there's um,

2143
01:54:31,450 --> 01:54:31,940
you know,
an,

2144
01:54:31,940 --> 01:54:33,380
an armstrong,
uh,

2145
01:54:33,700 --> 01:54:37,300
in 2009 when he staged that comeback.
Um,

2146
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,011
you know,
I,

2147
01:54:38,011 --> 01:54:38,844
I believe that he was trying to do it 
clean and then all of a sudden realize 

2148
01:54:43,601 --> 01:54:46,330
he was gonna get his ass kicked,
doing a clean.

2149
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:47,373
And you look at that comeback here,
which is so interesting that contador 

2150
01:54:51,040 --> 01:54:56,040
who beat him set the all time fastest 
times in that year.

2151
01:54:57,100 --> 01:54:59,560
And that was supposed to be the clean 
tour.

2152
01:54:59,561 --> 01:55:03,250
That was the redemption tour.
That was the tour to approve that.

2153
01:55:03,251 --> 01:55:05,380
It's clean.
And yet in that tour,

2154
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:09,520
a contador set the all time,
fastest times.

2155
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:14,440
And funny enough that year were 
armstrong got third,

2156
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:15,893
um,
had he been doing the tour any other 

2157
01:55:17,921 --> 01:55:20,530
year,
the watts per kilo that he had put up,

2158
01:55:20,531 --> 01:55:25,510
the power that he had put up,
it was actually his best tour ever,

2159
01:55:26,410 --> 01:55:29,260
ever.
So he came into that tour going,

2160
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:30,513
I'm gonna win it.
And yet his teammate got the door and 

2161
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:37,990
schleicher I'll open them essentially.
And it was the end.

2162
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:40,840
And so had it been any other year,
he would have won that tour.

2163
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:43,740
It's so crazy.
And now with crispr,

2164
01:55:43,970 --> 01:55:46,260
you know,
now with this new technology that allows

2165
01:55:46,261 --> 01:55:50,130
people to essentially,
I mean it's the,

2166
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:53,460
it's on the table what the potential is 
going to completely play out,

2167
01:55:53,461 --> 01:55:54,294
but other countries are using it right 
now and embryos and know whether or not 

2168
01:55:56,550 --> 01:55:57,790
humans,
uh,

2169
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:58,763
in the United States whether they're 
going to use it and you're going to see 

2170
01:56:01,411 --> 01:56:04,440
these children.
It's not when or it's not.

2171
01:56:04,470 --> 01:56:05,303
If rather it's more like when,
as this technology progresses and it 

2172
01:56:08,821 --> 01:56:09,654
gets better and better,
if you find out that your children have 

2173
01:56:11,461 --> 01:56:15,290
the genetic markers that could 
essentially lead to alzheimer's down,

2174
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:16,051
uh,
down the road.

2175
01:56:16,051 --> 01:56:17,730
Why would you want your children to have
alzheimer's?

2176
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:18,870
You wouldn't,
you wouldn't,

2177
01:56:18,871 --> 01:56:20,010
you would edit them.
You would say,

2178
01:56:20,011 --> 01:56:20,760
well,
they'll say,

2179
01:56:20,760 --> 01:56:22,140
well,
it's just a simple procedure.

2180
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:25,740
It's no more dangerous than,
you know,

2181
01:56:25,741 --> 01:56:27,570
other medical procedures that we do 
every day.

2182
01:56:27,630 --> 01:56:29,280
We're just going to do it.
It'd be real simple,

2183
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:31,950
by the way,
which you have a preference.

2184
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:35,220
Do you like your child to have a 
ridiculous,

2185
01:56:35,230 --> 01:56:38,170
a vo two max?
Would you,

2186
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:41,970
would you like your kid to be one of the
most ridiculous mesomorphs the world has

2187
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:43,860
ever known?
Do you want to herschel walker type body

2188
01:56:43,861 --> 01:56:44,694
for your child?

2189
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:45,660
Well,
they can do it.

2190
01:56:45,660 --> 01:56:46,680
Yeah,
they can do it.

2191
01:56:47,220 --> 01:56:49,170
The technology's there right now.
It's,

2192
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:50,133
well,
it's close.

2193
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,593
Technology's there right now.
I was reading all these articles right 

2194
01:56:55,381 --> 01:56:56,840
now,
which is a funny.

2195
01:56:56,850 --> 01:56:59,220
silicon valley did a show with the blood
bags.

2196
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:01,940
If you saw that episode where,
uh,

2197
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:05,430
uh,
the gavin belson television show is,

2198
01:57:05,431 --> 01:57:06,264
uh,
is having his blood swapped out by like 

2199
01:57:08,011 --> 01:57:11,190
a 21 year old and really good looking 
kid.

2200
01:57:11,340 --> 01:57:13,930
Peter teal does that on a regular basis 
and that was the,

2201
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:14,783
and that was the lampooning of it,
but they've been doing all this test in 

2202
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:17,994
mice that if you take an old mouse and 
give it the blood of a young mouse that 

2203
01:57:24,271 --> 01:57:27,000
the old mouse starts,
you know,

2204
01:57:27,001 --> 01:57:27,834
basically reverse aging and if you give 
the old mouse blood to the young mouse 

2205
01:57:32,070 --> 01:57:34,290
that the young mouse turns into an old 
mouse.

2206
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:36,780
So I mean,
this is,

2207
01:57:36,810 --> 01:57:39,540
this is on the,
on the horizon.

2208
01:57:39,541 --> 01:57:40,830
I mean this is,
this is there.

2209
01:57:40,831 --> 01:57:42,010
So the question is what,
what,

2210
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:43,260
what do you do about it?
I mean,

2211
01:57:43,261 --> 01:57:44,850
you're,
you're like a,

2212
01:57:45,330 --> 01:57:48,030
you know,
your urine enthusiasts and you're in the

2213
01:57:48,031 --> 01:57:51,330
sports that you care about or dangerous 
violent sports.

2214
01:57:51,450 --> 01:57:52,580
So how,
what do you,

2215
01:57:52,610 --> 01:57:53,460
what do you do about it?

2216
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:54,770
it's a real question,
you know,

2217
01:57:54,990 --> 01:57:56,880
it's like all those things we were 
talking about earlier,

2218
01:57:56,881 --> 01:58:00,270
you put all the pieces on the table and 
you try to imagine what's the solution?

2219
01:58:00,271 --> 01:58:01,104
I don't see the solution.
I don't know what it is because I don't 

2220
01:58:02,431 --> 01:58:05,370
think we were talking about this with 
some friends.

2221
01:58:05,371 --> 01:58:08,280
We were saying like if everybody decides
to stay clean,

2222
01:58:08,520 --> 01:58:12,780
but yet the technology becomes viable 
for the average person.

2223
01:58:13,050 --> 01:58:13,883
You're going to have a mailman that 
looks like the incredible hulk and 

2224
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:18,360
you're going to be watching these 
scrawny guys fight in the ufc.

2225
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:20,380
No one's going to tolerate that.
You know?

2226
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:24,030
We're just going to have to assume at 
some point in time that all these people

2227
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:24,864
are enhanced.
We're just going to assume that it's 

2228
01:58:26,941 --> 01:58:27,774
more than just dedication and hard work 
and honestly it's going to be a sad day 

2229
01:58:31,951 --> 01:58:32,784
when that happens because when that does
happen and we just accept the fact that 

2230
01:58:36,001 --> 01:58:39,120
we've created these genetic freaks,
they're not going to be special.

2231
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:41,920
It'S not going to stand out.
Like when you saw Mike Tyson,

2232
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:43,143
it was a special thing because it was 
the 19 eighties and there was really 

2233
01:58:45,971 --> 01:58:47,650
nothing.
I mean who knows?

2234
01:58:47,680 --> 01:58:48,513
It's probably.
There was probably some steroids 

2235
01:58:49,481 --> 01:58:50,314
involved in that too.
I mean there's the steroids involved in 

2236
01:58:51,671 --> 01:58:52,504
a lot of different things that we've 
just assumed there weren't little just 

2237
01:58:55,331 --> 01:58:58,060
leave that on the table,
but it wasn't genetics,

2238
01:58:58,440 --> 01:59:00,910
which you saw as a guy who was born that
way,

2239
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,400
who was born with that freakish power 
and speed.

2240
01:59:03,810 --> 01:59:04,643
You didn't get it from a laboratory.
You didn't get it from somebody's 

2241
01:59:07,031 --> 01:59:07,864
literally taking the embryo and altering
the genetiCs and the embryo and making 

2242
01:59:12,251 --> 01:59:16,690
him a destruction machine,
making him a violent force of nature.

2243
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:17,524
Like Mike Tyson was in his prime.
The idea that yOu could take a regular 

2244
01:59:20,021 --> 01:59:20,854
person like young jamie over there and 
turn them into some sort of crazy freak 

2245
01:59:25,451 --> 01:59:26,700
athlete.
It's just.

2246
01:59:27,190 --> 01:59:29,680
It's weird because when a freak athlete 
comes along,

2247
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:31,360
you see them and you go,
wow,

2248
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:33,130
that guy's a freak.
This is crazy.

2249
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:35,980
No one can do that.
I've never seen anybody do that before,

2250
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:39,490
but then you look at the money behind it
now and then you look at,

2251
01:59:39,910 --> 01:59:43,450
as in this film,
you see all of a sudden the geo politics

2252
01:59:43,451 --> 01:59:44,284
behind it,
but in the us or whatever were we're 

2253
01:59:46,691 --> 01:59:48,850
looking at it on the,
you know,

2254
01:59:48,851 --> 01:59:49,684
the $40,
million dollar a year contract level of 

2255
01:59:51,581 --> 01:59:54,880
it and whether or not that's ethical and
what do we do about that.

2256
01:59:54,881 --> 01:59:59,881
All of a sudden we have athletes has 
genetic mutants and what is that future.

2257
02:00:00,190 --> 02:00:01,023
But then when you look at it on the geo 
political level and what a country is 

2258
02:00:03,671 --> 02:00:04,504
willing to do to win and what it means 
for their athletes to win an assert 

2259
02:00:08,831 --> 02:00:11,140
power.
I mean like I rememBer when,

2260
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:12,053
you know,
a couple of years ago when Germany won 

2261
02:00:13,091 --> 02:00:16,470
the world cup.
I mean it was a.

2262
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:20,820
I mean,
german pride had to have been at a,

2263
02:00:21,130 --> 02:00:23,560
at a staggering level.

2264
02:00:23,560 --> 02:00:24,190
I mean,
you,

2265
02:00:24,190 --> 02:00:25,023
I mean,
you probably could have went and went 

2266
02:00:26,111 --> 02:00:28,270
into any bar in Germany and said 
something,

2267
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:31,060
you know,
and you would've got your face speeding.

2268
02:00:31,090 --> 02:00:34,810
I mean,
it is because of the emotion that people

2269
02:00:34,960 --> 02:00:35,793
get connected to with their athletes and
their sports team and I think 

2270
02:00:39,110 --> 02:00:44,110
governments and in the case of icarus 
and you understand what that is,

2271
02:00:44,730 --> 02:00:47,320
that this is,
this is so far beyond,

2272
02:00:47,730 --> 02:00:49,030
you know,
it goes into,

2273
02:00:49,330 --> 02:00:50,163
into global power and how do you 
consolidate power and sport in many 

2274
02:00:54,371 --> 02:00:55,570
ways.
Is that,

2275
02:00:56,020 --> 02:00:58,270
is that vehicle I see it.

2276
02:00:58,400 --> 02:00:59,061
Yeah,
certainly as.

2277
02:00:59,061 --> 02:00:59,894
I mean it's such a huge part of the 
recreation of the people and giving 

2278
02:01:02,391 --> 02:01:05,180
people something to be excited about.
Now when you,

2279
02:01:05,200 --> 02:01:10,200
you do take into consideration this new 
technology that's on the horizon crisper

2280
02:01:10,341 --> 02:01:12,350
and,
and who knows what's after crispr,

2281
02:01:12,351 --> 02:01:13,184
right?
And then you look at what Russia has 

2282
02:01:14,661 --> 02:01:17,420
been unwilling to do with their state 
sponsored doping program.

2283
02:01:17,630 --> 02:01:19,700
You've got to think they were already 
involved in that.

2284
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:20,870
You gotta think they're already.

2285
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,373
Well,
you know greg gregory said something to 

2286
02:01:23,251 --> 02:01:26,340
me interesting is he says,
well,

2287
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:30,120
you know,
whatever they put on that water list,

2288
02:01:30,570 --> 02:01:31,403
meaning whatever banned substances they 
put on the list we've already got in 

2289
02:01:36,061 --> 02:01:36,894
Russia,
we've already got another 10 or 20 that 

2290
02:01:39,620 --> 02:01:42,080
messing with.
If you remember last year,

2291
02:01:42,081 --> 02:01:42,914
the whole meldonium scandal with 
sharapova and all these assets as the 

2292
02:01:47,341 --> 02:01:49,290
ufc gets freaked out for them,
they'll donate them.

2293
02:01:49,291 --> 02:01:50,124
Well,
that was a substance that Russia had 

2294
02:01:51,861 --> 02:01:52,694
been,
you know,

2295
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:55,940
messing with for years knowing that it 
wasn't on the pan,

2296
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:56,833
on the banned list.
And then they essentially put it on the 

2297
02:01:59,031 --> 02:02:02,090
banned list like that.
And then they started testing for it and

2298
02:02:02,091 --> 02:02:03,290
they did it as a,
you know,

2299
02:02:03,620 --> 02:02:04,453
it was,
it was very intentional to go catch 

2300
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:09,190
everybody on meldonium.
But you know,

2301
02:02:09,250 --> 02:02:10,850
according to,
to gregory is,

2302
02:02:10,851 --> 02:02:11,840
there's,
you know,

2303
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:12,674
they've already,
they're already figuring out the next 

2304
02:02:14,901 --> 02:02:15,651
thing,
the next thing,

2305
02:02:15,651 --> 02:02:16,850
the next thing,
the next thing

2306
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:18,133
well spent.
Especially when you have a state 

2307
02:02:18,901 --> 02:02:19,734
sponsored program and there are no state
sponsored programs that we know of like 

2308
02:02:22,831 --> 02:02:23,664
that in America.
I mean that would give them a massive 

2309
02:02:25,561 --> 02:02:26,394
advantage.

2310
02:02:26,900 --> 02:02:27,441
No,
we don't.

2311
02:02:27,441 --> 02:02:29,780
We don't know of any program where.
I mean,

2312
02:02:29,781 --> 02:02:34,781
when you think about what that is,
it would be like the equivalent of obama

2313
02:02:35,391 --> 02:02:36,710
or trump,
you know,

2314
02:02:36,711 --> 02:02:37,760
going,
hey,

2315
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:42,170
american athlete,
you need to be on this program.

2316
02:02:42,230 --> 02:02:45,800
If you're going to be on the national 
team and represent America,

2317
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:48,920
you go on this program and if you don't 
want to be on this program,

2318
02:02:48,921 --> 02:02:52,480
well you're not on the team and uh,
and,

2319
02:02:52,481 --> 02:02:53,314
and what gregory was doing,
which was part of the whole ethical and 

2320
02:02:56,181 --> 02:02:57,014
moral conundrum,
which is an interesting thing which we 

2321
02:02:58,551 --> 02:02:59,384
never get into in the film,
is he was constantly being forced to 

2322
02:03:02,421 --> 02:03:05,840
sacrifice athletes.
So part of this system,

2323
02:03:05,841 --> 02:03:09,620
the only way that it would work is you 
had to have lamps.

2324
02:03:10,040 --> 02:03:12,260
If nobody ever tested positive,
right?

2325
02:03:12,530 --> 02:03:13,363
Well,
it would look like there's something 

2326
02:03:14,721 --> 02:03:15,650
wrong with the system.

2327
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:16,723
So they had to have positive tests and 
they would consistently have positive 

2328
02:03:21,291 --> 02:03:23,690
tests.
And the guys who would test positive,

2329
02:03:24,080 --> 02:03:24,913
what they would do is they were the guys
who either were past champions that the 

2330
02:03:29,241 --> 02:03:30,860
ministry looked at and said,
hey,

2331
02:03:30,861 --> 02:03:32,900
you're not going to go and win another 
gold medal.

2332
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:35,780
You're not know you're not who you are 
anymore.

2333
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:39,560
Or it was an athlete who they believed 
could be a champion,

2334
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,210
never lived up to his potential and was 
on the state program.

2335
02:03:44,211 --> 02:03:45,044
So they would sacrifice athletes along 
the way to make it appear that the 

2336
02:03:48,471 --> 02:03:52,370
system was catching them and,
and,

2337
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:53,263
and that was a whole a conundrum for 
gregory because he got to know a lot of 

2338
02:03:58,190 --> 02:04:01,250
these guys and,
and these athletes would think that they

2339
02:04:01,251 --> 02:04:02,084
were being protected because they 
thought that they were on the state 

2340
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,233
state program.
So they think that they're being 

2341
02:04:06,591 --> 02:04:07,424
protected and all of a sudden they're 
positive and they're banned and they're 

2342
02:04:11,331 --> 02:04:12,070
going,
wait,

2343
02:04:12,070 --> 02:04:14,900
wait,
you told me you told me to take this and

2344
02:04:14,901 --> 02:04:16,760
um,
and what do you mean on band?

2345
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:17,593
You told,
you told me I'd,

2346
02:04:17,670 --> 02:04:22,060
I'd be negative.
Be like your positive jesus.

2347
02:04:22,150 --> 02:04:24,740
Well they were always positive so it was
just a matter of,

2348
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:25,903
of,
of who to sacrifice and whether or not 

2349
02:04:29,091 --> 02:04:31,160
they would,
they would swap the urine.

2350
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:34,130
He had this.
We never get intO,

2351
02:04:34,131 --> 02:04:35,330
into the,
into the film,

2352
02:04:35,331 --> 02:04:40,331
but this is mind blowing to.
So he had developed right after the,

2353
02:04:40,620 --> 02:04:41,453
the london olympics.
They figure out how to break into the 

2354
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:45,931
bottles.
Right.

2355
02:04:45,931 --> 02:04:46,764
So they,
they figure out how they can break into 

2356
02:04:48,241 --> 02:04:53,241
these bottles and swapped the urine.
But he personally was never doing that.

2357
02:04:53,521 --> 02:04:57,520
what he would do is the fsb,
these guys would come in,

2358
02:04:57,550 --> 02:05:00,390
they had this device and like once a 
week,

2359
02:05:00,391 --> 02:05:01,224
whenever they needed to do it,
they'd come in and swap out all these b 

2360
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:06,170
samples that they'd keep in storage,
you know,

2361
02:05:06,240 --> 02:05:07,620
just for safe keeping.
And the,

2362
02:05:07,621 --> 02:05:09,330
a sample was always swapped.

2363
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:12,000
But the b sample,
they would like,

2364
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:12,893
you know,
there wasn't going to be a need to 

2365
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:14,694
retest it right that moment.
So they'd keep it for a week or 

2366
02:05:16,621 --> 02:05:19,170
whatever.
And then the guys would come in and they

2367
02:05:19,171 --> 02:05:20,004
would swap out all the samples.
So part of this system was as he kept a 

2368
02:05:24,840 --> 02:05:29,840
urine database,
so he had 16,000

2369
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:31,223
matching urine samples that he was 
holding in the laboratory that they 

2370
02:05:35,401 --> 02:05:38,580
should have all been disposed of after 
three months according to the code.

2371
02:05:38,850 --> 02:05:39,683
So any international athlete that would 
come into Russia to compete in the 

2372
02:05:42,121 --> 02:05:43,620
games,
kids,

2373
02:05:43,650 --> 02:05:45,960
gymnast,
anybody competing in Russia.

2374
02:05:46,200 --> 02:05:50,250
And if they tested clean,
Russia would hold their urine,

2375
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:54,090
put it down for the specific gravity,
the steroid profile,

2376
02:05:54,091 --> 02:05:56,850
keep it in a database,
you know,

2377
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:57,713
the urine is being kept frozen so they 
would always have samples to swap for 

2378
02:06:01,051 --> 02:06:01,884
any of the russian athletes at any time,
even if they didn't have a clean sample 

2379
02:06:06,301 --> 02:06:07,350
for that athlete.

2380
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:11,700
So because most of the russian athletes,
they were on the program in sochi,

2381
02:06:11,701 --> 02:06:12,534
they took extraordinary precaution.
They collected clean urine of each of 

2382
02:06:15,961 --> 02:06:19,590
the athletes on the program.
But outside of that,

2383
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:21,660
what they were doing was just going,
hey,

2384
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:25,140
we have 16 thOusand samples to choose 
from.

2385
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:29,610
So whatever is going to best match the 
russian athlete to swap with,

2386
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:32,400
we can take the urine of another 
athlete,

2387
02:06:32,610 --> 02:06:33,530
you know,
a,

2388
02:06:33,590 --> 02:06:34,423
a clean athlete and make it look pretty 
much identical to that russian athletes 

2389
02:06:39,361 --> 02:06:41,490
because they could choose from 16,000
samples.

2390
02:06:41,550 --> 02:06:42,383
Wow.
So they had it all index as far as the 

2391
02:06:44,311 --> 02:06:45,144
weight and index everything because they
have a color profile and everything was 

2392
02:06:48,271 --> 02:06:48,980
crazy.
I,

2393
02:06:48,980 --> 02:06:49,813
I got to see a spreadsheet and then on 
the eve of this investigation breaking 

2394
02:06:54,820 --> 02:06:55,653
and,
and water's going to go raid this 

2395
02:06:57,451 --> 02:07:01,260
laboratory and there's thousands of 
missing samples and,

2396
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:02,323
and then the report,
this report that's 335 page report 

2397
02:07:06,340 --> 02:07:11,340
tryIng to remember it was something like
1400 samples are missing or 1400 samples

2398
02:07:12,301 --> 02:07:13,134
were destroyed.

2399
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:18,410
Will the real number was 8,200
something.

2400
02:07:18,541 --> 02:07:20,360
It was truly 16,
18,

2401
02:07:20,400 --> 02:07:22,530
8,000
samples matching in two bottles,

2402
02:07:22,531 --> 02:07:23,364
16,000
samples and they had to bring in these 

2403
02:07:25,531 --> 02:07:29,340
containers,
industrial trash containers and the dark

2404
02:07:29,341 --> 02:07:30,174
of night operation,
emptying out the lab and bringing all 

2405
02:07:33,151 --> 02:07:33,984
these bottles to some industrial trash 
where they dumped them and crushed them 

2406
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:39,250
and incinerated them.
Wow.

2407
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:41,860
And so it was,
I mean this was,

2408
02:07:41,890 --> 02:07:42,723
this was a pretty nutty operation going 
on and they did this for the collegiate 

2409
02:07:48,311 --> 02:07:49,540
competition.
So the.

2410
02:07:49,870 --> 02:07:52,900
So the world junior track championships 
were in Russia.

2411
02:07:53,170 --> 02:07:54,003
They did it for that.
They did it for the swimming 

2412
02:07:55,181 --> 02:07:57,550
championships.
They did for everything.

2413
02:07:57,551 --> 02:07:59,770
So they were.
These were kids to any,

2414
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:02,230
any of the,
any of the collegiate athletes.

2415
02:08:02,380 --> 02:08:04,690
It's amazing that all the athletes kept 
her mouth shut,

2416
02:08:05,090 --> 02:08:08,260
no athlete got a bad conscience and 
psych are,

2417
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:09,280
can't do this anymore.

2418
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:11,170
I need to come clean.
Well,

2419
02:08:11,980 --> 02:08:13,630
there's been athletes that have come 
forward.

2420
02:08:13,650 --> 02:08:14,470
yeah,
I mean there's been,

2421
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:17,080
whistleblowers has been.
There's been multiple ones,

2422
02:08:17,081 --> 02:08:18,130
but I think,
you know,

2423
02:08:18,620 --> 02:08:22,990
what you start seeing in that system,
which is very hard,

2424
02:08:22,991 --> 02:08:26,380
I think for an american to understand.
Um,

2425
02:08:26,710 --> 02:08:31,630
and we talked very openly against our 
government.

2426
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:32,493
You know,
what's going on in the current 

2427
02:08:33,161 --> 02:08:34,210
administration.
You know,

2428
02:08:34,211 --> 02:08:35,910
people are very,
you know,

2429
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:40,780
anti trump or,
or pro trump or anti obama,

2430
02:08:40,781 --> 02:08:41,960
whatever that mean.
That's what,

2431
02:08:42,610 --> 02:08:43,810
as americans,
we,

2432
02:08:43,840 --> 02:08:44,673
we do that and we had that mentality 
won't in China and in Russia and other 

2433
02:08:49,841 --> 02:08:52,780
countries like this go through communism
and everything.

2434
02:08:53,140 --> 02:08:53,973
That mentality neveR goes away.
The mentality is always that the state 

2435
02:08:57,011 --> 02:08:59,470
can take everything from you.
They can put you in jail,

2436
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:02,110
they can take your passport,
they can see your assets.

2437
02:09:02,111 --> 02:09:04,000
They can launch fake news against you.

2438
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:07,510
They can put you in jail just like they 
did to gregory just like they're doing.

2439
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:11,110
And so everybody,
no matter how powerful they all had that

2440
02:09:11,230 --> 02:09:15,070
fear of the government in their mind and
what you See,

2441
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:20,080
because I saw this firsthand in Russia 
where I have some very wealthy,

2442
02:09:20,141 --> 02:09:25,141
very powerful russian friends and they 
will never talk bad about the government

2443
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:30,430
in public everywhere now off camera or 
you know,

2444
02:09:30,431 --> 02:09:32,700
or whatever.
And closed doors one-on-one.

2445
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,281
There'll be like,
yeah,

2446
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:33,701
yeah,
yeah,

2447
02:09:33,701 --> 02:09:34,534
I dOn't,
you know,

2448
02:09:34,890 --> 02:09:36,370
they'll,
they'll tell you how it is.

2449
02:09:36,550 --> 02:09:37,383
But in public,
if among their friends in a social 

2450
02:09:39,401 --> 02:09:40,234
setting,
there's always this belief that 

2451
02:09:41,831 --> 02:09:42,664
somebody's watching you or somebody 
might rat you out or somehow you're 

2452
02:09:45,761 --> 02:09:46,594
going to lose your wealth or,
or you're going to cross the paths of 

2453
02:09:49,871 --> 02:09:51,250
wrong person.
And that's what we've,

2454
02:09:51,640 --> 02:09:55,810
what we've seen in all these stories 
year after year after year out of,

2455
02:09:56,170 --> 02:09:56,950
out of Russia.

2456
02:09:56,950 --> 02:09:58,390
And certainly,
you know,

2457
02:09:58,391 --> 02:09:59,970
other countries are,
you know,

2458
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,680
the mysterious death of,
of kim jong,

2459
02:10:02,681 --> 02:10:04,000
il's brother,
et cetera.

2460
02:10:04,700 --> 02:10:08,320
They are operating under a system that's
ancient.

2461
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:09,100
I mean,
it's,

2462
02:10:09,100 --> 02:10:13,660
this is the way people have Been 
dictators for thousands of years,

2463
02:10:13,870 --> 02:10:16,330
but they're just doing it in the age of 
information.

2464
02:10:16,331 --> 02:10:18,220
And they're doing it right under 
everyone's nose.

2465
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:19,630
Fake news.
Fear,

2466
02:10:19,690 --> 02:10:20,950
yeah.
They did a,

2467
02:10:20,951 --> 02:10:21,430
uh,
this,

2468
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:23,800
this was interesting about two weeks 
ago,

2469
02:10:24,240 --> 02:10:25,073
uh,
russia's trying to get reinstated for 

2470
02:10:26,111 --> 02:10:28,390
the winter olympics or will not,
not reinstated.

2471
02:10:28,391 --> 02:10:30,490
They're trying to make sure that they 
can go to the winter olympics.

2472
02:10:30,760 --> 02:10:34,250
So they release the story through 
sputnik news and rt,

2473
02:10:34,251 --> 02:10:35,210
the russian,
you know,

2474
02:10:35,570 --> 02:10:36,403
times Russia today.
And they released this story that 

2475
02:10:38,841 --> 02:10:39,674
mclaren,
the investigator in the film behind all 

2476
02:10:41,931 --> 02:10:44,350
the gregorys evidence,
uh,

2477
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:46,370
that mclaren is willing to forgive 
Russia,

2478
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:49,280
that he believes that there's errors in 
his report,

2479
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:50,413
um,
and that water believes that Russia 

2480
02:10:52,041 --> 02:10:55,190
should be reinstated and allowed to go 
to the winter olympics.

2481
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:59,180
None of this is true and this is piCked 
up by worldwide media.

2482
02:10:59,181 --> 02:11:01,880
It's picked up by papers all over the 
world.

2483
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:03,553
And Russia just put this out there 
basically to fuel the fuel of the 

2484
02:11:06,921 --> 02:11:07,970
propaganda.
And then,

2485
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:09,970
you know,
next day mclaren's out there,

2486
02:11:10,220 --> 02:11:10,701
you know,
going,

2487
02:11:10,701 --> 02:11:14,030
that's not true,
but his press release was picked up by a

2488
02:11:14,031 --> 02:11:18,650
handful of outlets where the,
where the Russia released because of how

2489
02:11:18,651 --> 02:11:21,200
they're able to disseminate news went 
global.

2490
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,550
I always watch a guy like that.
And I wonder like,

2491
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:28,370
you look at the russian administration,
it's in right now and you went,

2492
02:11:28,371 --> 02:11:29,204
how long can they keep that going?
And you would look at it in terms of 

2493
02:11:31,581 --> 02:11:33,440
America,
like americans would revolt.

2494
02:11:33,830 --> 02:11:35,490
But like you were saying in Russia,
I mean,

2495
02:11:35,491 --> 02:11:38,950
our remember the story aBout some 
russian oligarch who,

2496
02:11:38,951 --> 02:11:39,784
um,
spoke ill of putin and I don't remember 

2497
02:11:42,881 --> 02:11:44,470
what the deal was that he was 
discussing,

2498
02:11:44,471 --> 02:11:45,304
but they stripped him of all his money,
took his company away and put them in 

2499
02:11:47,651 --> 02:11:48,160
jail.

2500
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:48,911
Oh,
it wasn't that,

2501
02:11:48,911 --> 02:11:49,744
um,
uh,

2502
02:11:49,840 --> 02:11:50,673
not,
not met aveva I know who you're talking 

2503
02:11:52,971 --> 02:11:53,651
to.
What's his name?

2504
02:11:53,651 --> 02:11:56,930
Is very famous as famous case.
Well,

2505
02:11:56,980 --> 02:11:58,000
he was the richest man in.
Yeah,

2506
02:11:58,030 --> 02:12:00,810
Russia at the time.
They just took his entire fortune,

2507
02:12:01,020 --> 02:12:03,330
locked them in a cell,
kept in there for years.

2508
02:12:03,331 --> 02:12:06,150
Then eventually released in,
which isn't even bolder move.

2509
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:07,111
They're like,
look,

2510
02:12:07,111 --> 02:12:10,200
we just dismantled you and now we'll 
just let you Go.

2511
02:12:10,800 --> 02:12:14,250
Now you're not going to do shit.
It's terrifying.

2512
02:12:14,970 --> 02:12:15,960
What do you,
what do you think?

2513
02:12:15,961 --> 02:12:18,660
Uh,
and after seeing the film and,

2514
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:22,240
and what your salmon.
The brushes once richest man,

2515
02:12:22,241 --> 02:12:26,540
he had his last 170 million hit his last
million because it was the saint.

2516
02:12:26,550 --> 02:12:27,383
Go back to the top of the title jamie.
How hid his last hundred and $70 

2517
02:12:31,451 --> 02:12:32,284
million.

2518
02:12:33,810 --> 02:12:34,870
So we,
uh,

2519
02:12:34,900 --> 02:12:36,900
you know,
how do you say his name for the other 14

2520
02:12:36,901 --> 02:12:37,734
point $8 million?
It's only money just fried after 10 

2521
02:12:41,221 --> 02:12:42,054
years in jail.
Told journalists at a press conference 

2522
02:12:43,351 --> 02:12:46,530
in berlin two days ago that he didn't 
know how much money you had left.

2523
02:12:47,340 --> 02:12:48,173
leah need berber.
She do ski columnist for the russian 

2524
02:12:53,131 --> 02:12:57,900
editorial edit addition to have dish.
And a forbes thinks he has an idea.

2525
02:12:58,260 --> 02:12:59,093
I don't know how to say his name.
Cote d'or called ski khodorkovsky grew 

2526
02:13:04,441 --> 02:13:07,470
rich in Russia.
Freewill in the 19 nineties by acquiring

2527
02:13:07,471 --> 02:13:08,304
state oil assets due to do one point he 
was ranked 15th and the forbes 

2528
02:13:11,911 --> 02:13:16,260
billionaire list with a personal net 
worth $15,000,000,000.

2529
02:13:16,930 --> 02:13:17,970
Hmm.
So yeah,

2530
02:13:17,971 --> 02:13:21,330
This is the guy and they put them in 
jail for quite a long time.

2531
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,890
Ten years,
10 years in jail.

2532
02:13:22,891 --> 02:13:24,760
And just let them go.
Yeah.

2533
02:13:24,761 --> 02:13:25,510
Don't,
don't,

2534
02:13:25,510 --> 02:13:26,530
don't mess with Russia.

2535
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:30,010
But even the letting go thing,
it's just amazing that they just decided

2536
02:13:30,011 --> 02:13:32,130
to let them go.
Like they put them in jail,

2537
02:13:32,131 --> 02:13:33,700
took all his money and then go,
yeah,

2538
02:13:34,140 --> 02:13:35,060
the fuck out of here.
Yeah.

2539
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:37,020
Well once he was no longer a threat.
Yeah.

2540
02:13:37,021 --> 02:13:39,270
But it's just.
And it's also a learned his lesson.

2541
02:13:39,450 --> 02:13:42,360
It's a let everybody know like this can 
happen to you.

2542
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:43,140
Yeah,
exactly.

2543
02:13:43,140 --> 02:13:47,370
And by freeing him but also like lets 
them know like you see what happens,

2544
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:50,070
you don't want to mess with us,
you're gonna pay the price.

2545
02:13:50,110 --> 02:13:51,540
Stunning.
What,

2546
02:13:51,590 --> 02:13:52,170
what,
what do you,

2547
02:13:52,170 --> 02:13:53,880
what do you make of what's going on in 
the,

2548
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:55,223
in the us right now with all the 
allegations after seeing the film or 

2549
02:13:59,071 --> 02:14:00,310
were.
Where's your head at?

2550
02:14:00,390 --> 02:14:01,223
Well,
I didn't put the two of them together 

2551
02:14:02,191 --> 02:14:03,024
because when I was watching the film 
essentially I was just thinking about 

2552
02:14:04,621 --> 02:14:06,510
the anti-doping ramifications.

2553
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:07,793
Um,
but I mean it's pretty obvious that if 

2554
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:13,100
they're doing this,
they're.

2555
02:14:13,410 --> 02:14:14,243
And there's seems to be a lot of 
evidence that they have at least 

2556
02:14:17,671 --> 02:14:19,450
attempted.
I mean there's a,

2557
02:14:19,500 --> 02:14:21,720
there were sOme new thing recently about
facebook ads,

2558
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:23,130
facebook,
twitter at.

2559
02:14:23,131 --> 02:14:23,964
Yeah,
I mean there's definitely something 

2560
02:14:25,111 --> 02:14:27,600
going on,
but we're doing it too,

2561
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:29,220
you know,
we're doing it to them.

2562
02:14:29,250 --> 02:14:30,083
They're doing it to us.
It's essentially been a part of global 

2563
02:14:31,531 --> 02:14:33,030
politics forever.
I mean,

2564
02:14:33,031 --> 02:14:36,330
we influence their elections and not 
just there as we influence the elections

2565
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:39,000
of countless countries all over the 
world.

2566
02:14:39,210 --> 02:14:41,040
It's a look.
It's Gross.

2567
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:41,933
It's disgusting.
and the only thing that I can think is 

2568
02:14:43,141 --> 02:14:47,310
that with the information age that we're
currently experiencing,

2569
02:14:47,370 --> 02:14:50,520
I think I feel like we're in the 
adolescence of this and that.

2570
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,530
What's,
what seems to highlight this age is that

2571
02:14:56,010 --> 02:14:56,843
the distance between people and 
information just keeps getting shorter 

2572
02:14:59,311 --> 02:15:02,850
and shorter and the aBility to hide 
things,

2573
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:07,590
hide devious acts and hide money and 
hide influence.

2574
02:15:07,590 --> 02:15:12,590
And hide manipulation seems to be,
it seems to be able to.

2575
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:17,250
The people seem to be able to find out 
things quicker and quicker now.

2576
02:15:17,750 --> 02:15:20,900
And I was having a conversation about 
this the other day where,

2577
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:23,120
where if it's,
you know,

2578
02:15:23,140 --> 02:15:25,680
I mean look at the instagram age and 
facebook and everything.

2579
02:15:25,681 --> 02:15:26,514
Everybody seems to know everything about
everyone and that anything eventually 

2580
02:15:31,051 --> 02:15:32,670
comes out in the end.
I think,

2581
02:15:32,671 --> 02:15:33,504
again,
we're experiencing the adolescents of 

2582
02:15:35,161 --> 02:15:35,994
this.
I think there's gonna come a point in 

2583
02:15:36,961 --> 02:15:37,794
time with an.
I believe it's going to be through 

2584
02:15:38,731 --> 02:15:39,564
technological innovation that we're 
gonna be able to read each other's 

2585
02:15:41,221 --> 02:15:43,110
minds.
I think it's inevitable.

2586
02:15:43,200 --> 02:15:44,033
I think the idea of the internet,
if you went to someone in the 18 

2587
02:15:46,231 --> 02:15:47,910
hundreds and told them one day you're 
gonna,

2588
02:15:47,911 --> 02:15:49,500
be able to talk to your phone and ask 
your phone,

2589
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:50,633
you know,
a bunch of different questions that are 

2590
02:15:51,831 --> 02:15:53,040
literally give you the answer.

2591
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:55,440
They would go with the fuck as a phone.
Like,

2592
02:15:55,441 --> 02:15:56,670
what are you talking about,
man?

2593
02:15:56,820 --> 02:15:59,190
Like what are you crazy?
This guy's a crazy person.

2594
02:15:59,191 --> 02:16:00,880
You're talking about witchcraft.
No,

2595
02:16:00,890 --> 02:16:01,191
no,
no,

2596
02:16:01,191 --> 02:16:02,024
no.
I'm talking about all the world being 

2597
02:16:02,761 --> 02:16:04,440
connected and you'll be able to share 
photos.

2598
02:16:04,650 --> 02:16:05,483
What's a photo will be able to capture 
time with a small device in your pocket 

2599
02:16:08,790 --> 02:16:09,623
and video as well with perfect sound and
you'd be able to download hundreds of 

2600
02:16:14,580 --> 02:16:16,860
hours,
hundreds of hours of music and put it on

2601
02:16:16,861 --> 02:16:18,330
your phone.
You'll be able to listen to that.

2602
02:16:18,660 --> 02:16:22,170
They'd be like recorded music.
The fuck are you talking about?

2603
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:23,940
This is just a couple of hundred years 
ago.

2604
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:26,250
I mean,
what are we goinG to experience a couple

2605
02:16:26,251 --> 02:16:27,084
of hundred years from now?
I think we're going to be able to read 

2606
02:16:28,291 --> 02:16:31,300
each other's minds.
I think the idea that we're a way,

2607
02:16:31,301 --> 02:16:35,590
the way we operate now,
our operating system of language,

2608
02:16:35,860 --> 02:16:40,060
the way we communicate with each other 
through mouth noises and that you have a

2609
02:16:40,090 --> 02:16:40,810
dictionary.

2610
02:16:40,810 --> 02:16:44,080
We understand what the noises are and we
are.

2611
02:16:44,081 --> 02:16:46,750
You say some things like the entire time
you've been talking here,

2612
02:16:46,920 --> 02:16:47,753
I have referred to my database of 
information so I know exactly what he's 

2613
02:16:50,801 --> 02:16:53,240
saying and yell.
Brian means this and he means,

2614
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:54,423
as you're talking,
all the people that are listening are 

2615
02:16:55,421 --> 02:16:56,254
doing the exact same thing.
I think it is entirely possible that in 

2616
02:16:58,811 --> 02:17:02,020
the future we will swap that out for 
some sort of universal system,

2617
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:03,063
some sort of universal system that is 
neurologically connected that we're 

2618
02:17:07,301 --> 02:17:10,210
going to have something that is either 
embedded into our minds,

2619
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:12,490
embedded into,
into our brain itself,

2620
02:17:12,491 --> 02:17:15,550
embedded into our neurological system.
That's minority report.

2621
02:17:15,610 --> 02:17:16,443
Yes.
I mean it's just inevitable if 

2622
02:17:18,281 --> 02:17:19,114
technology keeps going and We keep 
progressing and there's no reason to 

2623
02:17:21,881 --> 02:17:25,030
think other than some sort of a natural 
disaster or some sort of a human created

2624
02:17:25,031 --> 02:17:25,864
disaster that it doesn't.
It doesn't keep going the way it's 

2625
02:17:27,731 --> 02:17:28,900
going.
we're going,

2626
02:17:28,901 --> 02:17:31,570
we're going to get to someplace where we
can see each other's minds.

2627
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:35,470
We're going to be able to read each 
other's thoughts and for good or bad,

2628
02:17:35,530 --> 02:17:39,020
and I tend to think both.
Both good and bad.

2629
02:17:39,050 --> 02:17:40,270
we're going to long for the good old 
days.

2630
02:17:40,271 --> 02:17:41,104
When you have some privaCy going along 
for the good old days of you can keep a 

2631
02:17:43,181 --> 02:17:43,930
secret.

2632
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:44,201
No,
I mean,

2633
02:17:44,201 --> 02:17:45,034
because right now we're already in an,
in an era where almost anything is 

2634
02:17:48,401 --> 02:17:49,980
discoverable,
anything,

2635
02:17:49,981 --> 02:17:51,730
you know,
nothing,

2636
02:17:51,820 --> 02:17:52,653
nothing is private anymore and there's 
always something to come out and then 

2637
02:17:56,681 --> 02:17:58,930
there's some sort of electronic trail of
it.

2638
02:17:59,360 --> 02:18:01,930
I mean even in the oe,
which we don't,

2639
02:18:01,990 --> 02:18:03,110
which I,
I,

2640
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:06,250
you wouldn't know about the film,
but the way that,

2641
02:18:06,251 --> 02:18:07,084
that evidence was truly corroborate it 
was the electronic trail and here's the 

2642
02:18:10,661 --> 02:18:13,120
amazing thing,
which people probably don't realize it.

2643
02:18:13,121 --> 02:18:15,840
So like gregory,
when he comes to the us,

2644
02:18:15,850 --> 02:18:20,850
he had erased all of his phones because 
he was under the ministry order to erase

2645
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:21,930
everything.
And,

2646
02:18:21,930 --> 02:18:22,763
and what was happening was the athletes 
were snapping a photo of their doping 

2647
02:18:25,841 --> 02:18:29,250
control forms.
So that's how gregory would know what,

2648
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:31,510
what number corresponded to what 
athlete.

2649
02:18:31,511 --> 02:18:32,344
I mean,
this was very intricate how this was 

2650
02:18:33,431 --> 02:18:36,250
going down because nobody in the lab,
you know,

2651
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:37,533
which you know,
if you're the scientist and you're 

2652
02:18:38,441 --> 02:18:41,290
getting armstrong sample,
you don't know what's armstrong sample.

2653
02:18:41,290 --> 02:18:42,850
It's numbered.
It's got a seven,

2654
02:18:42,910 --> 02:18:45,250
eight digit number on.
It's just a random number.

2655
02:18:45,640 --> 02:18:49,090
But so What the russians were doing,
they were snapping a photo of her doping

2656
02:18:49,091 --> 02:18:50,890
control form,
which only they could do,

2657
02:18:51,490 --> 02:18:54,460
right?
and then they were sending this photo to

2658
02:18:54,870 --> 02:18:55,840
a,
um,

2659
02:18:56,110 --> 02:18:56,943
an fsb agent who was also a coach and 
she would send the photo to gregory and 

2660
02:19:02,230 --> 02:19:03,063
the kgb guy in the,
in the lab who was assisting him and so 

2661
02:19:06,851 --> 02:19:09,340
that they would know that that number,
number one,

2662
02:19:09,341 --> 02:19:10,151
one seven,
four,

2663
02:19:10,151 --> 02:19:13,390
four,
corresponded to this athlete,

2664
02:19:13,810 --> 02:19:16,930
right?
The point that I'm getting at is that,

2665
02:19:16,931 --> 02:19:17,764
so he was erased all of that.
They told them to erase it all from his 

2666
02:19:20,951 --> 02:19:22,540
phone,
all the computers,

2667
02:19:22,541 --> 02:19:23,760
everything.
And when he comes here,

2668
02:19:23,761 --> 02:19:27,920
he brings his old computer and he brings
his old phones because this guy,

2669
02:19:28,280 --> 02:19:32,660
he just knows and when he turns over all
the evidence to,

2670
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,300
to water and the,
uh,

2671
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:36,320
and the,
uh,

2672
02:19:36,650 --> 02:19:37,483
and the us authorities and interpol,
what they're able to do is they're able 

2673
02:19:42,441 --> 02:19:43,274
to get all this erased information,
all of this array stuff that was on his 

2674
02:19:48,261 --> 02:19:49,730
phone and computer and retrieve it.

2675
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,333
Wow.
And that's like a massive portion of 

2676
02:19:56,961 --> 02:19:58,360
this evidence.
Uh,

2677
02:19:58,520 --> 02:20:01,700
What they were also able to do is what 
we probably don't realize,

2678
02:20:01,701 --> 02:20:04,700
and this goes into what you're saying is
when you send an email,

2679
02:20:05,600 --> 02:20:07,330
if you've got the,
the,

2680
02:20:07,440 --> 02:20:08,273
the metadata behind it.
So like he was getting emails sent 

2681
02:20:11,181 --> 02:20:13,160
through the russian ministry.
So you're sitting there going,

2682
02:20:13,161 --> 02:20:16,100
well how do you know where this came 
from?

2683
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:17,533
They can go back in the actual,
through the metadata that is being sent 

2684
02:20:21,441 --> 02:20:25,880
into computer and show exactly from what
computer,

2685
02:20:25,890 --> 02:20:30,890
where date time that email was sent and 
that's how they were able to corroborate

2686
02:20:31,341 --> 02:20:35,750
all his evidence through,
through basically forensics of,

2687
02:20:35,800 --> 02:20:36,680
you know,
whatever,

2688
02:20:36,710 --> 02:20:39,900
whatever that study is of,
of electronic forensics.

2689
02:20:39,901 --> 02:20:42,200
So When you talk about reading minds and
that kind of stuff,

2690
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:45,530
I mean half of that technology is,
is already there.

2691
02:20:45,890 --> 02:20:46,401
I mean,
any,

2692
02:20:46,401 --> 02:20:48,890
any photo you take on your phone,
even if you delete it,

2693
02:20:48,891 --> 02:20:52,370
they can get it back and they can figure
out exactly where you were,

2694
02:20:52,371 --> 02:20:54,020
where it was,
said how it was sent,

2695
02:20:54,021 --> 02:20:57,890
the spot that you sent it from where 
it's nuts and it's going to get crazier.

2696
02:20:58,010 --> 02:20:58,910
Just going to get crazier.

2697
02:20:58,970 --> 02:20:59,803
I mean,
for sure there's gonna be some new 

2698
02:21:00,741 --> 02:21:01,574
technologies to couple of years from now
that's going to make it even easier to 

2699
02:21:03,921 --> 02:21:04,754
do than that.

2700
02:21:05,560 --> 02:21:06,960
And,
and when you read about,

2701
02:21:06,961 --> 02:21:07,794
you know,
there's all these apps with encryption 

2702
02:21:08,731 --> 02:21:12,600
software and stuff and a maverick given 
up the idea that,

2703
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:14,940
that I,
you know,

2704
02:21:14,941 --> 02:21:17,490
that you can be essentially invisible or
they can,

2705
02:21:18,180 --> 02:21:19,230
uh,
you know,

2706
02:21:19,231 --> 02:21:21,000
that if somebody wants to get your 
information,

2707
02:21:21,001 --> 02:21:22,110
they're going to get your information.

2708
02:21:22,690 --> 02:21:24,100
Yeah.
Unquestionably.

2709
02:21:24,370 --> 02:21:25,203
And you know,
another thing that's really interesting 

2710
02:21:26,081 --> 02:21:26,914
is that we're looking at photos when 
we're looking at video and email and 

2711
02:21:30,281 --> 02:21:32,650
we're assuming that is going to be in 
the future,

2712
02:21:32,980 --> 02:21:35,230
more access to photo,
more access to email,

2713
02:21:35,231 --> 02:21:37,150
more access to video.
But what,

2714
02:21:37,230 --> 02:21:39,340
what is coming down the pipe?
I mean,

2715
02:21:39,341 --> 02:21:40,750
what,
what is the new thing?

2716
02:21:41,140 --> 02:21:41,641
I mean,
there,

2717
02:21:41,641 --> 02:21:42,474
there,
there could be something that's even 

2718
02:21:43,121 --> 02:21:43,954
fucking crazier than video.
I mean we're just assuming that it's 

2719
02:21:47,321 --> 02:21:50,590
going to stay video,
it's going to stay photos like why those

2720
02:21:50,591 --> 02:21:52,480
things didn't even exist a couple of 
hundred years ago.

2721
02:21:52,730 --> 02:21:53,563
Well,
everything that's going on now is going 

2722
02:21:54,531 --> 02:21:56,400
into this world of vr.
Yes.

2723
02:21:56,600 --> 02:21:58,020
Where essentially,
you know,

2724
02:21:58,040 --> 02:21:59,180
the,
you know,

2725
02:21:59,181 --> 02:22:00,014
the idea is,
is that as you can see things and you 

2726
02:22:01,971 --> 02:22:02,804
can create your own reality.
I mean there's lots of discussion even 

2727
02:22:05,901 --> 02:22:07,940
in the,
in the world of sex that,

2728
02:22:07,941 --> 02:22:08,774
you know,
the sex of the future is why do you 

2729
02:22:10,491 --> 02:22:12,380
really need a,
a,

2730
02:22:12,381 --> 02:22:13,214
another human.
You can essentially simulate that and 

2731
02:22:16,770 --> 02:22:19,860
program it and make it everything you 
wanted and more.

2732
02:22:19,890 --> 02:22:21,560
I never know the difference.
Oh,

2733
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:22,471
well,
I mean,

2734
02:22:22,471 --> 02:22:25,140
whether it's through augmented reality,
virtual reality,

2735
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:27,210
robots.
I mean we're,

2736
02:22:27,211 --> 02:22:31,620
we're just a few steps away from all 
this stuff and if it's not 10 years from

2737
02:22:31,621 --> 02:22:32,610
now,
it's 50.

2738
02:22:32,930 --> 02:22:34,380
If it's not 50,
it's 100.

2739
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:38,310
I mean it's inevitable.
Human beings don't destroy ourselves.

2740
02:22:38,311 --> 02:22:39,144
We stay alive long enough.
We're going to see a complete desolving 

2741
02:22:43,381 --> 02:22:44,610
of reality as we know it.

2742
02:22:44,990 --> 02:22:45,823
Which I think even goes into like the 
whole anti-doping world of it in sports 

2743
02:22:50,421 --> 02:22:51,450
where he,
you know,

2744
02:22:51,451 --> 02:22:52,284
a,
you actually just made me think about 

2745
02:22:53,301 --> 02:22:55,700
like terminator,
where you're sitting there going,

2746
02:22:55,701 --> 02:22:59,480
well wait,
you think it's a real person and,

2747
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:01,880
and,
and it's a terminator,

2748
02:23:02,150 --> 02:23:02,983
but you think of all the technologies 
that are going on right now and why 

2749
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,823
won't there be a chip in,
in yOur brain that basically takes away 

2750
02:23:11,571 --> 02:23:13,580
pain so that you can,
you know,

2751
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:17,630
persevere in an mma fight that takes 
away your,

2752
02:23:17,631 --> 02:23:18,880
you know,
all,

2753
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:22,160
all these different technologies that 
are essentially create,

2754
02:23:22,161 --> 02:23:23,780
you know,
controlling your synapses,

2755
02:23:23,781 --> 02:23:26,630
controlling your reflexes all it's all 
there.

2756
02:23:27,210 --> 02:23:29,060
And how is that not gonna happen?

2757
02:23:29,150 --> 02:23:32,030
And then obviously in enhancing the 
human body itself,

2758
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:32,893
I mean there was a technology that we've
been talking about recently where they 

2759
02:23:34,941 --> 02:23:35,774
were trying to combine spider silk with 
human skin tissue to make an artificial 

2760
02:23:41,841 --> 02:23:44,090
skin a replacement skin that's 
bulletproof.

2761
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,500
Wow.
That just blew my mind.

2762
02:23:48,530 --> 02:23:50,510
Yeah.
That just blew my mom there.

2763
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:53,180
They're going to genetically engineer 
human skin,

2764
02:23:53,181 --> 02:23:54,014
so it'll look like humans scan.
It'll have much of the same properties 

2765
02:23:56,421 --> 02:23:57,254
of human skin,
but it'll be bulletproof because it'll 

2766
02:24:00,590 --> 02:24:02,030
be you,
it'll be you.

2767
02:24:02,110 --> 02:24:03,530
You'll replace your skin,

2768
02:24:04,790 --> 02:24:05,623
and then how do they stop?
I'm in the power of that bullet would 

2769
02:24:07,821 --> 02:24:09,260
still be up.

2770
02:24:09,440 --> 02:24:10,050
It did.
Well,

2771
02:24:10,050 --> 02:24:10,883
sure.
You could do some some tissue trauma 

2772
02:24:12,831 --> 02:24:17,270
underneath the surface,
but the actual skin itself won't break.

2773
02:24:17,390 --> 02:24:19,790
It'd be like having a bulletproof vest 
all of your body.

2774
02:24:20,030 --> 02:24:21,680
I mean,
that's what kevlar essentially is.

2775
02:24:21,920 --> 02:24:22,753
What cavalera is is a material that is 
so dense and so it's so thick and so 

2776
02:24:28,011 --> 02:24:28,844
impenetrable that when You shoot a 
regular bullet into the regular bullet 

2777
02:24:31,521 --> 02:24:32,354
hits,
it does not go through it and just 

2778
02:24:33,860 --> 02:24:34,693
spreads out and expands.
It's still very painful for the person 

2779
02:24:37,041 --> 02:24:37,874
who gets shot,
but it protects your life and we could 

2780
02:24:40,251 --> 02:24:43,490
easily see that happen with entire 
body's made out of that stuff.

2781
02:24:43,990 --> 02:24:44,823
I mean,
you got to believe it's priority out 

2782
02:24:45,731 --> 02:24:47,500
there.
Like in some secret lab,

2783
02:24:47,530 --> 02:24:52,530
they are like develop the skin and 
sitting in like a in like a petri dish.

2784
02:24:52,781 --> 02:24:54,100
That's bulletproof skin.

2785
02:24:54,230 --> 02:24:55,063
Yeah.
If I'm reading it on a sCience website 

2786
02:24:56,420 --> 02:24:57,253
for sure,
I'm not the first one to get the 

2787
02:24:58,011 --> 02:24:58,791
information.
I mean,

2788
02:24:58,791 --> 02:25:01,010
this is getting to the highest level.
I mean,

2789
02:25:01,220 --> 02:25:02,750
where is the real money?
Right?

2790
02:25:02,780 --> 02:25:05,240
It's the real question is,
and I don't know this answer,

2791
02:25:05,630 --> 02:25:09,440
is the top scientists in the world,
the top innovators in the world.

2792
02:25:09,441 --> 02:25:11,150
I mean,
when do they scoop those people up?

2793
02:25:11,151 --> 02:25:12,800
When does the government come in with 
some,

2794
02:25:13,340 --> 02:25:15,600
some black ops money and say,
hey,

2795
02:25:15,950 --> 02:25:16,783
we would like to hire you and give you x
amount of money to create this and this 

2796
02:25:21,021 --> 02:25:23,710
is what we know so far about that and 
you know,

2797
02:25:23,711 --> 02:25:24,544
here we're going to take you to groom 
lake out in the middle of Nevada and 

2798
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:28,810
show you some lab that you didn't even 
know existed.

2799
02:25:28,890 --> 02:25:29,820
Yeah,
but you got to beLieve it.

2800
02:25:29,821 --> 02:25:34,740
That's already way into going on because
there's nothing that we spend more money

2801
02:25:34,741 --> 02:25:38,790
on than military basically defense than 
that.

2802
02:25:38,791 --> 02:25:42,870
This is what we spend money on.
That is actually,

2803
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:43,860
you know,
I think,

2804
02:25:43,860 --> 02:25:45,780
uh,
as you probably know the,

2805
02:25:45,860 --> 02:25:48,570
uh,
I've read that the single biggest export

2806
02:25:48,660 --> 02:25:51,700
of the United States is our weapons.
Yeah.

2807
02:25:52,050 --> 02:25:54,990
That's what we make and sell to the rest
of the world.

2808
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:55,860
Yeah.
We saw them and stuff.

2809
02:25:55,861 --> 02:25:57,440
It's not as good as the stuff we're 
making right now.

2810
02:25:57,480 --> 02:26:00,280
Right now we sell the world our weapons 
and that's,

2811
02:26:00,690 --> 02:26:01,523
and that is what is employing like 
millions and millions of people in this 

2812
02:26:05,821 --> 02:26:07,430
country is,
is basically the,

2813
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:10,500
our military and our defense and 
ultimately,

2814
02:26:10,820 --> 02:26:12,660
you know,
developing spider skin.

2815
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:13,793
YeAh,
I mean this and this is what we're 

2816
02:26:14,521 --> 02:26:15,181
seeing,
right?

2817
02:26:15,181 --> 02:26:16,014
This is what we get to see and look at 
who knows how many different programs 

2818
02:26:18,421 --> 02:26:22,290
are going on right now as we're speaking
that we have no knowledge of whatsoever.

2819
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:25,470
I mean when they released the stealth 
bomber and a couple other,

2820
02:26:25,471 --> 02:26:28,930
there's these like a sort of,
um,

2821
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:33,150
experimental vehicles where they were 
putting together these things once they,

2822
02:26:33,230 --> 02:26:35,730
they actually released them when they 
actually put,

2823
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:37,890
had press conferences and showed people 
the,

2824
02:26:38,100 --> 02:26:39,720
they had been working on these things 
forever.

2825
02:26:40,230 --> 02:26:40,720
It means

2826
02:26:40,720 --> 02:26:43,960
under wraps for like 20 years and all of
a sudden you see the singer like,

2827
02:26:43,990 --> 02:26:46,420
whoa.
Have you ever seen one person a stealth?

2828
02:26:46,660 --> 02:26:47,493
Yeah,
no,

2829
02:26:47,630 --> 02:26:48,463
I was in palmdale and that's near 
edwards air force base and we were 

2830
02:26:51,741 --> 02:26:52,574
filming fear factor out there and this 
was right after September 11th and so 

2831
02:26:55,491 --> 02:26:56,324
they were doing all these exercises and 
these things were flying over the 

2832
02:26:57,921 --> 02:27:00,020
desert.
It was like being in star wars.

2833
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,090
I mean once you see them in real life,
you're like,

2834
02:27:02,091 --> 02:27:04,490
holy shit,
that's a fucking ufo.

2835
02:27:04,850 --> 02:27:09,020
this black thing not shaped like any 
plane you've ever seen before,

2836
02:27:09,230 --> 02:27:12,460
flying across the sky and you just look 
at it a little.

2837
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:14,840
What the fuck is that thing?

2838
02:27:15,210 --> 02:27:16,950
Yeah.
That's like 20 years old now.

2839
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,053
All the shit.

2840
02:27:19,130 --> 02:27:20,210
oh yeah,
for sure.

2841
02:27:20,240 --> 02:27:21,073
I mean about what's out there now.
I mean they probably have some 

2842
02:27:22,641 --> 02:27:25,700
ridiculous stuff and then there's some 
theoretical ideas.

2843
02:27:25,701 --> 02:27:26,534
You know,
the magnetic drives they're trying to 

2844
02:27:27,801 --> 02:27:28,730
put together.
There's some.

2845
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:30,033
I mean there's,
there's a bunch of speculation about 

2846
02:27:32,241 --> 02:27:33,860
different types of weapons that they're 
trying to,

2847
02:27:34,400 --> 02:27:37,610
to anti-matter weapons.
Some things that are going to be able to

2848
02:27:37,611 --> 02:27:40,310
just completely annihilate anything they
touch,

2849
02:27:40,340 --> 02:27:42,260
whether or not they're going to go 
completely through the earth.

2850
02:27:42,261 --> 02:27:46,580
If you hit things and who knows,
who knows what's on the horizon.

2851
02:27:46,610 --> 02:27:47,443
I mean they're just going to keep 
getting better and better at blowing 

2852
02:27:49,251 --> 02:27:50,750
shit up.
You know what I mean?

2853
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:51,603
The,
the amount of power that we have with 

2854
02:27:53,181 --> 02:27:54,014
the nuclear arsenal today and the amount
of power and the weapons in comparison 

2855
02:27:57,171 --> 02:28:02,171
to the weapons that we used in hiroshima
and nagasaki is insane.

2856
02:28:03,110 --> 02:28:03,943
It's not even close.
I mean there are hundreds and hundreds 

2857
02:28:06,051 --> 02:28:06,950
of times more powerful.

2858
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:07,873
No,
it's staggering to kind of understand 

2859
02:28:10,061 --> 02:28:13,390
what kind of destruction is possible and
the like.

2860
02:28:13,570 --> 02:28:15,280
Nothing.
I don't think on the level of what we're

2861
02:28:15,281 --> 02:28:17,940
seeing in natural destruction of what 
nature can do alone,

2862
02:28:17,941 --> 02:28:18,440
but.

2863
02:28:18,440 --> 02:28:20,900
But it's also fascinating when you think
about the,

2864
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:22,160
that your,
your,

2865
02:28:22,160 --> 02:28:26,360
your film is sort of brought to light is
that a lot of this destruction,

2866
02:28:26,361 --> 02:28:27,770
like when you were talking about the 
Ukraine,

2867
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:31,070
a lot of this destruction and a lot of 
this,

2868
02:28:31,290 --> 02:28:35,670
the confidence that they have to go into
these places and,

2869
02:28:35,671 --> 02:28:38,960
and use these weapons is kind of 
dependent upon public opinion.

2870
02:28:38,961 --> 02:28:40,340
That's dependent upon sport,

2871
02:28:40,470 --> 02:28:41,303
rIght?
And be dependent on basically kicking 

2872
02:28:42,691 --> 02:28:43,524
somebody else's ass without the weapons.
And then that allows you to almost like 

2873
02:28:47,881 --> 02:28:51,780
weaponized because you have the,
the power of the country behind you,

2874
02:28:52,100 --> 02:28:52,770
you know,
it was a,

2875
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:57,470
what was interesting is,
is um,

2876
02:28:57,780 --> 02:29:02,780
after sochi and putin's a rating goes up
to 95 percent or something like that,

2877
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:04,723
that,
that everybody in Russia supported him 

2878
02:29:07,171 --> 02:29:09,120
going into Ukraine too.
It was,

2879
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:11,390
this was a good idea.
We're,

2880
02:29:11,660 --> 02:29:13,080
we're strong,
we're powerful.

2881
02:29:13,081 --> 02:29:14,900
Let's go in and,
and take back,

2882
02:29:15,130 --> 02:29:16,750
you know,
a part of territory that,

2883
02:29:16,751 --> 02:29:17,584
that,
that,

2884
02:29:17,610 --> 02:29:19,110
that we lost.
So let's go do it.

2885
02:29:19,380 --> 02:29:20,130
And,
and,

2886
02:29:20,130 --> 02:29:21,480
and you see that,
that,

2887
02:29:21,510 --> 02:29:22,343
that,
that sort of nationalistic pride is 

2888
02:29:25,231 --> 02:29:26,700
real.
I mean,

2889
02:29:26,970 --> 02:29:28,590
I,
I grew up in,

2890
02:29:28,591 --> 02:29:30,030
um,
in Colorado,

2891
02:29:30,031 --> 02:29:30,811
which is,
you know,

2892
02:29:30,811 --> 02:29:35,811
denver bronco territory and uh,
I mean people would paint and they still

2893
02:29:36,361 --> 02:29:36,991
do.
I mean,

2894
02:29:36,991 --> 02:29:37,770
you know,
around football.

2895
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:41,120
So you driving around the city,
you see thousands of houses painted it,

2896
02:29:41,130 --> 02:29:43,260
orange and blue people are in orange and
blue.

2897
02:29:43,261 --> 02:29:44,970
I mean it's,
it's literally,

2898
02:29:44,971 --> 02:29:46,860
it's a religion.
It's a cult.

2899
02:29:46,890 --> 02:29:49,590
It is,
it is an ethos.

2900
02:29:49,650 --> 02:29:52,230
It is.
and it's something to even fight about.

2901
02:29:52,890 --> 02:29:56,090
Like I'm in a,
you talk bad about the broncos were.

2902
02:29:56,100 --> 02:29:56,933
I mean that,
that's,

2903
02:29:57,020 --> 02:29:58,020
that's,
that's a,

2904
02:29:58,110 --> 02:29:59,750
that's a point of fight.
And,

2905
02:30:00,050 --> 02:30:00,960
and I remember,
you know,

2906
02:30:00,961 --> 02:30:01,794
the few years ago when the broncos won 
the super bowl and you're looking at 

2907
02:30:04,140 --> 02:30:04,973
like,
the statistic was something like 85 

2908
02:30:08,701 --> 02:30:12,270
percent of the city of denver showed up 
for a parade on a monday.

2909
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:15,660
I'm like,
whoa,

2910
02:30:15,870 --> 02:30:19,790
this is crazy and this is what.
And this is what people.

2911
02:30:19,800 --> 02:30:22,710
So if you don't believe that that the 
governor or whatever,

2912
02:30:22,711 --> 02:30:25,980
the governor of Colorado that day could 
have been like,

2913
02:30:25,981 --> 02:30:28,860
hey,
we're going to go seize Montana,

2914
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:31,920
Wyoming,
Arizona and Utah.

2915
02:30:32,270 --> 02:30:34,890
Everybody had state of Colorado would 
have been like,

2916
02:30:35,430 --> 02:30:37,260
hell yeah,
go broncos.

2917
02:30:38,940 --> 02:30:39,830
Yeah,
I mean,

2918
02:30:39,880 --> 02:30:42,020
and that is,
that is what,

2919
02:30:42,140 --> 02:30:45,470
what this is masking behind,
you know,

2920
02:30:45,480 --> 02:30:47,040
a playing field.
I mean,

2921
02:30:47,041 --> 02:30:47,874
look at it,
it's just people care about this 

2922
02:30:49,590 --> 02:30:54,270
[inaudible] you're basically beating 
somebody else without weapOns.

2923
02:30:54,350 --> 02:30:56,180
See,
you're manipulating their opinions.

2924
02:30:56,181 --> 02:30:59,450
you're manipulating the way people feel 
and public opinion.

2925
02:31:00,370 --> 02:31:01,870
What do you think should be done?
What?

2926
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:02,580
How do you.

2927
02:31:02,580 --> 02:31:05,100
This is what I was sayinG before.
If you put all the pieces on the table.

2928
02:31:05,101 --> 02:31:06,900
I don't.
I feel like we're,

2929
02:31:06,910 --> 02:31:10,260
we're at a.
I don't think you can stop technology.

2930
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:10,941
Right?
And I,

2931
02:31:10,941 --> 02:31:12,500
I don't,
I just don't think I,

2932
02:31:12,620 --> 02:31:14,080
I think it's what we do.
I mean,

2933
02:31:14,100 --> 02:31:16,860
I think if you,
if you looked at human beings as a whole

2934
02:31:17,610 --> 02:31:21,000
and you look at what we to be versus 
what we are now,

2935
02:31:21,001 --> 02:31:21,834
if you were some sort of an objective 
life form from another planet that 

2936
02:31:25,471 --> 02:31:30,410
didn't have any vested interest in 
understanding our culture and just tried

2937
02:31:30,411 --> 02:31:34,380
to examine us as a super organism,
what do we do?

2938
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:36,930
We make better sHit every year.
That's what we do.

2939
02:31:36,960 --> 02:31:37,793
We're always going to make better shit.
We're always gonna make better shit as 

2940
02:31:39,451 --> 02:31:40,284
long as we stay alive.
As long as we don't get hit by an 

2941
02:31:41,821 --> 02:31:45,780
asteroid killed by a hurricane,
swamped and an earthquake or tsunami,

2942
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:47,220
we're going to continue to make better.

2943
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:50,010
We're going to continue to become better
humans technically,

2944
02:31:50,011 --> 02:31:52,320
tactically,
not maybe from,

2945
02:31:52,321 --> 02:31:54,570
hey.
I think even from a moral standpoint,

2946
02:31:54,571 --> 02:31:55,980
I think we're better now than we were 
before,

2947
02:31:56,010 --> 02:31:58,200
which is why things like putin are so 
disturbing,

2948
02:31:58,410 --> 02:31:59,243
which is what you know,
if you go back to like the gang is con 

2949
02:32:00,960 --> 02:32:01,980
era.
It was the norm,

2950
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:04,200
right?
That was how dictators ran.

2951
02:32:04,201 --> 02:32:06,760
That's how kings ran and emperors ran 
their,

2952
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:07,603
their dynasties.
It's more uncommon now and more 

2953
02:32:10,381 --> 02:32:13,650
disturbing because the main superpower 
doesn't do it that way.

2954
02:32:13,700 --> 02:32:16,680
The United States of America,
and that's one of the reasons why people

2955
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:20,610
are so patriotic about America because 
when you look back at human history,

2956
02:32:20,611 --> 02:32:25,050
we are the fucked up as we are 
undeniably fucked up as it is.

2957
02:32:25,890 --> 02:32:26,723
We are the shining example of what's 
possible in the future that we can keep 

2958
02:32:31,111 --> 02:32:35,310
going and eventually create some sort of
a system that's different.

2959
02:32:35,340 --> 02:32:36,173
Some sort of a experiment in self 
government has different than has ever 

2960
02:32:39,301 --> 02:32:40,134
existed before where you can get to a 
point where a fucking reality show 

2961
02:32:42,781 --> 02:32:43,614
president or a reality show host becomes
the president of the United States of 

2962
02:32:47,550 --> 02:32:48,383
America for good or for bad.
It opens people's eyes to the 

2963
02:32:51,091 --> 02:32:52,080
possibility like,
wow,

2964
02:32:52,081 --> 02:32:54,870
like this.
This is a new thing like this.

2965
02:32:54,900 --> 02:32:57,030
In terms of human history,
this is a new thing.

2966
02:32:57,210 --> 02:32:58,043
This whole experiment,
this whole thing called the United 

2967
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:01,283
States.
It's only a few hundred years old is a 

2968
02:33:01,891 --> 02:33:05,130
very new thing.
If you looked at us objective,

2969
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:05,993
lee,
if you were something from another 

2970
02:33:06,601 --> 02:33:08,160
planet,
you would say,

2971
02:33:08,161 --> 02:33:09,030
well,
what are they?

2972
02:33:09,031 --> 02:33:11,700
What's the end game with these fuckers?
What are they trying to do?

2973
02:33:11,730 --> 02:33:13,350
Well,
what they're trying to do is make better

2974
02:33:13,351 --> 02:33:14,184
and better stuff and I think the real 
issue with that is artificial 

2975
02:33:16,891 --> 02:33:19,950
intelligence because we look at 
artificial intelligence,

2976
02:33:19,951 --> 02:33:20,784
we say the word artificial intelligence,
and we think of it as like a thing that 

2977
02:33:25,201 --> 02:33:26,760
we can turn on or turn off.

2978
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:29,100
We think of it as a,
a device,

2979
02:33:29,101 --> 02:33:31,440
a vcr,
or fucking television.

2980
02:33:31,441 --> 02:33:32,274
We think of it as a piece of equipment 
that a human has created that may be 

2981
02:33:35,731 --> 02:33:38,580
able to think for itself.
I think it's a life form.

2982
02:33:39,060 --> 02:33:39,893
I think it's just a life form that 
exists from parts and pieces that we're 

2983
02:33:44,040 --> 02:33:44,873
designed to put together.
I think our entire thing about being 

2984
02:33:49,411 --> 02:33:53,580
attached to materialism are are constant
thirst for innovation.

2985
02:33:53,581 --> 02:33:56,670
We always want the iphone eight is 
albert iphone 10 is around the corner.

2986
02:33:56,671 --> 02:33:59,310
Do you hold out or to get the new one?
Now you have two options.

2987
02:33:59,580 --> 02:34:01,050
No one's going to stick with the iphone 
seven.

2988
02:34:01,051 --> 02:34:02,310
Fuck that man.
You know?

2989
02:34:02,311 --> 02:34:03,360
Well,
you're going to get the update.

2990
02:34:03,361 --> 02:34:05,460
The update is going to make it slower.
You know that happens,

2991
02:34:05,461 --> 02:34:06,294
right?
I mean,

2992
02:34:06,300 --> 02:34:08,130
we're,
we're thirsty for this shit,

2993
02:34:08,160 --> 02:34:08,993
but we'll.
We're fueling is innovation and 

2994
02:34:10,321 --> 02:34:13,530
innovation will inevitably lead to a new
life form.

2995
02:34:13,910 --> 02:34:15,960
It's Going to lead.
We're calling it artificial color,

2996
02:34:15,961 --> 02:34:17,740
whatever you want.
It's fucking real.

2997
02:34:17,770 --> 02:34:18,603
It's not artificial.
It's just a life form that's not based 

2998
02:34:20,411 --> 02:34:23,590
on blood and bones,
so life form that's based on circuits.

2999
02:34:23,800 --> 02:34:27,600
A lifelong is based on something that 
human beings have created and once it,

3000
02:34:28,270 --> 02:34:30,880
once it can think for itself,
it's going to make better life forms.

3001
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:33,130
It's going to make something way,
way different than us.

3002
02:34:33,131 --> 02:34:35,260
It's going to make something that 
doesn't have any emotions.

3003
02:34:35,410 --> 02:34:38,260
It's going to make something that 
doesn't have any biological needs.

3004
02:34:38,560 --> 02:34:39,393
It doesn't have any weird jealousy or 
weird issues that have been holding us 

3005
02:34:41,891 --> 02:34:43,540
back forever.
And what do you do with that?

3006
02:34:43,930 --> 02:34:44,920
Exactly when,
what?

3007
02:34:44,921 --> 02:34:46,410
What is it's motivation?
What?

3008
02:34:46,460 --> 02:34:49,420
Why does it even exist?
Why does it even want to do anything?

3009
02:34:49,460 --> 02:34:52,390
There's a lot of questions involved in 
this and you know,

3010
02:34:52,420 --> 02:34:54,250
maybe it can find some sort of 
motivation.

3011
02:34:54,251 --> 02:34:55,084
Maybe you can figure out some reason to 
exist and to innovate and to keep going 

3012
02:34:57,731 --> 02:34:59,800
better and better,
but we're.

3013
02:34:59,890 --> 02:35:00,723
We're limited.
We're limited by the scope of our 

3014
02:35:02,531 --> 02:35:03,364
evolution.
When you look at and you're talking 

3015
02:35:03,971 --> 02:35:06,210
about human beings haven't been run out.

3016
02:35:06,430 --> 02:35:08,380
Well,
that's getting into with,

3017
02:35:08,400 --> 02:35:11,320
with one henriquez which is,
which is,

3018
02:35:11,380 --> 02:35:12,213
you know,
we're his argument and I'd actually 

3019
02:35:13,901 --> 02:35:14,734
interviewed him for the film and ended 
up not using it because of where the 

3020
02:35:17,141 --> 02:35:17,974
story went,
but his argument was not the moral 

3021
02:35:20,891 --> 02:35:23,920
ethical argument around anti-doping and 
sport.

3022
02:35:23,921 --> 02:35:26,770
It wasn't anything.
It was just purely the argument of,

3023
02:35:26,920 --> 02:35:28,840
hey,
look at evolution,

3024
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:31,600
look at reality,
look at where we're gOing,

3025
02:35:31,601 --> 02:35:36,601
look at where human beings are 
essentially transcending to and then how

3026
02:35:39,191 --> 02:35:44,191
do you ever have the basis of what is 
the concept behind like clean sport more

3027
02:35:48,100 --> 02:35:49,930
or you know,
even transcending sport,

3028
02:35:49,931 --> 02:35:53,410
whatever you want to call it,
as being a pure ethos.

3029
02:35:53,470 --> 02:35:54,303
Because there are so many technoloGical 
and really evolutionary variables that 

3030
02:35:59,291 --> 02:36:00,124
are,
that seem to make that a fundamentally 

3031
02:36:03,371 --> 02:36:04,100
difficult

3032
02:36:04,100 --> 02:36:05,930
and were resisting the future.
I mean,

3033
02:36:05,931 --> 02:36:06,764
it's almost like resisting performance 
enhancing drugs is is futile in the 

3034
02:36:10,671 --> 02:36:11,504
first place.
It's like foolish because these 

3035
02:36:12,831 --> 02:36:15,140
performance enhancing drugs represent 
technology.

3036
02:36:15,141 --> 02:36:17,750
The represent our ability to manipulate 
our bodies recover.

3037
02:36:18,110 --> 02:36:19,850
Yeah.
And manipulate our biology.

3038
02:36:19,880 --> 02:36:21,680
Biology too.
Not just recover,

3039
02:36:21,860 --> 02:36:25,430
but also to grow at a rate that we've 
never been able to grow before.

3040
02:36:25,431 --> 02:36:28,340
It's not just recover.
If it was just about recovery.

3041
02:36:28,670 --> 02:36:31,380
Some steroids allow you to grow at a 
rate.

3042
02:36:31,580 --> 02:36:34,190
Look at bodybuilders like look like 
freaks.

3043
02:36:34,191 --> 02:36:36,040
Like lee haney,
like when he was in his prime.

3044
02:36:36,110 --> 02:36:37,480
Yeah.
There's this,

3045
02:36:37,500 --> 02:36:40,160
that's not just about recovery.
That's also about growth.

3046
02:36:40,190 --> 02:36:41,023
It's also about,
I mean the speed that ben johnson had 

3047
02:36:43,311 --> 02:36:45,800
when he won the gold medal and he tested
positive,

3048
02:36:45,801 --> 02:36:48,170
but it turns out that Carl Lewis was on 
some shit too.

3049
02:36:48,320 --> 02:36:49,840
And they hid that.
I mean there's.

3050
02:36:49,850 --> 02:36:50,070
Yeah.

3051
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:50,903
Camp catlin in 1984.
There were nine samples that went 

3052
02:36:54,030 --> 02:36:56,190
missing to this day.
Yes.

3053
02:36:56,220 --> 02:36:59,730
And the story behind that is that the u,
s,

3054
02:36:59,740 --> 02:37:04,740
o c a came to,
came to don catlin because ca catlin had

3055
02:37:05,191 --> 02:37:10,191
found the positives and basically those 
nine samples just vanished.

3056
02:37:10,980 --> 02:37:13,770
And you remember when ben johnson tried 
to compete clean after that?

3057
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:15,320
It was hilarious.
Yeah,

3058
02:37:15,350 --> 02:37:16,100
forget it.
It's like

3059
02:37:16,100 --> 02:37:19,370
you're looking at a regular guy trying 
to race against superstars.

3060
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:20,061
forget it.
He's like,

3061
02:37:20,061 --> 02:37:20,960
if I was running,

3062
02:37:21,240 --> 02:37:22,950
here's a.
Here's an interesting story.

3063
02:37:23,070 --> 02:37:26,490
I'm slightly off topic,
but on the topic of ben johnson.

3064
02:37:26,491 --> 02:37:29,220
So I'm dick pound Richard Powell.

3065
02:37:29,290 --> 02:37:30,190
What a great name.
By the way,

3066
02:37:30,400 --> 02:37:31,600
dick pound.
I mean,

3067
02:37:31,780 --> 02:37:32,613
how do you ever.
You cannot mess with a guy by the name 

3068
02:37:34,391 --> 02:37:35,224
of dick cow.
Why did the fuck did he ever go with 

3069
02:37:36,641 --> 02:37:37,474
dick when his name was richard?
Because I chose pound is that it does 

3070
02:37:40,090 --> 02:37:41,560
what to it?
And just been like,

3071
02:37:42,440 --> 02:37:43,091
yeah,
hey,

3072
02:37:43,091 --> 02:37:48,091
I'm dick pound back in the day like dick
nixon just go through your life.

3073
02:37:50,921 --> 02:37:53,830
a video.
You introduce yourself to a girl like,

3074
02:37:53,831 --> 02:37:55,120
hey,
but you named dick pound.

3075
02:37:55,180 --> 02:37:58,630
But still they call it dick back in the 
seventies and the sixties I think.

3076
02:37:58,631 --> 02:38:00,790
Yeah,
I mean Richard Nixon wasn't a dick.

3077
02:38:00,900 --> 02:38:01,733
No,
I guess all was his friends called him 

3078
02:38:02,471 --> 02:38:03,320
dick nixon.
Yeah.

3079
02:38:03,321 --> 02:38:03,851
something.
Yeah,

3080
02:38:03,851 --> 02:38:05,380
buT that's not my point.
My point is,

3081
02:38:05,410 --> 02:38:08,110
was a penis called a dick?
I don't know

3082
02:38:08,110 --> 02:38:08,890
when.
When a.

3083
02:38:08,890 --> 02:38:10,190
When a.
When a penis became.

3084
02:38:10,191 --> 02:38:10,320
Okay.

3085
02:38:10,320 --> 02:38:10,861
Dick.
Yeah,

3086
02:38:10,861 --> 02:38:12,150
exactly.
I don't know.

3087
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:13,513
I wonder if dick pound adopted the name 
prior to penises or if he or when he 

3088
02:38:19,351 --> 02:38:21,330
started calling himself dick pound.
Right.

3089
02:38:22,100 --> 02:38:25,320
he knew that it was a dick and then or 
if he adopted it,

3090
02:38:25,321 --> 02:38:28,260
you know,
like post daycare or at what point?

3091
02:38:28,261 --> 02:38:29,370
He basically said,
yeah,

3092
02:38:29,371 --> 02:38:30,520
I'm going to be dick pound.
Well,

3093
02:38:30,690 --> 02:38:32,790
richard to dick is always a weird one 
too.

3094
02:38:32,791 --> 02:38:35,700
It's not as weird as john did.
Jack.

3095
02:38:36,030 --> 02:38:37,620
John.
Jack is the weirdest one.

3096
02:38:37,710 --> 02:38:40,200
I mean kind of fucked you get richard 
should be rich.

3097
02:38:40,260 --> 02:38:41,270
Yes.
Rich.

3098
02:38:41,360 --> 02:38:42,510
Rich.
Go from.

3099
02:38:42,570 --> 02:38:45,420
Yeah.
How do you go from richard dick?

3100
02:38:45,690 --> 02:38:50,070
How do you go from john to jack?
Jack kennedy is John F.

3101
02:38:50,070 --> 02:38:51,900
Kennedy.
It makes no sense.

3102
02:38:51,901 --> 02:38:54,720
It doesn't make sense at all.
What about Jack Johnson?

3103
02:38:54,721 --> 02:38:57,120
Is he John Johnson?
I think he was jack.

3104
02:38:57,180 --> 02:39:00,210
I think his name was actually jack,
like you can have a name.

3105
02:39:00,211 --> 02:39:01,044
Jack johnson.
I'm not wearing it right now is we're 

3106
02:39:02,371 --> 02:39:03,204
going to.
Earlier today I was wearing a Jack 

3107
02:39:04,230 --> 02:39:05,063
Johnson t shirt.
This morning was funnier when you said 

3108
02:39:06,001 --> 02:39:07,820
that I thought I still had it on.
So like this.

3109
02:39:08,010 --> 02:39:08,850
Hi.
So,

3110
02:39:08,910 --> 02:39:09,850
so,
uh,

3111
02:39:09,990 --> 02:39:10,823
dick pound,
a richard pound who actually founded 

3112
02:39:14,551 --> 02:39:15,384
water at the time.
He's basically within the ioc and he'd 

3113
02:39:18,320 --> 02:39:20,580
talk about a crazy conflict of interest 
here.

3114
02:39:20,581 --> 02:39:22,970
So,
so richard pan was an,

3115
02:39:23,100 --> 02:39:25,250
an athlete,
a swimmer in olympics one.

3116
02:39:25,251 --> 02:39:26,084
We're actually.
And then he gone into being in the ioc 

3117
02:39:29,370 --> 02:39:30,203
and he's a lawyer and his law firm has 
been representing the olympics for the 

3118
02:39:35,431 --> 02:39:37,410
last,
I don't even know how many years.

3119
02:39:37,411 --> 02:39:38,244
Thirty years in all of their sale of the
olympics to the entire world is Richard 

3120
02:39:44,071 --> 02:39:46,230
pounds.
Lawford law firm,

3121
02:39:46,231 --> 02:39:47,064
striking pound number.
Japan is also the vice president of the 

3122
02:39:49,951 --> 02:39:53,170
ioc and richard pound,
um,

3123
02:39:53,640 --> 02:39:58,140
establishes water.
He's the first head of water in 1999.

3124
02:39:59,130 --> 02:40:04,130
I'm now an interesting stories.
He's canadian and he is essentially like

3125
02:40:05,011 --> 02:40:05,844
the ambassador to Canada during the time
that ben johnson test positive and ben 

3126
02:40:13,501 --> 02:40:14,280
johnson test

3127
02:40:14,280 --> 02:40:19,280
positive and Canada sends richard pound 
in there to basically see if they can do

3128
02:40:20,461 --> 02:40:24,270
something to make this go away.
Is this true?

3129
02:40:24,300 --> 02:40:25,970
Can they,
is there some,

3130
02:40:26,100 --> 02:40:26,933
some way that basically ben johnson 
cannot be positive and dick pound as he 

3131
02:40:32,161 --> 02:40:33,960
will tell you was,
was,

3132
02:40:33,990 --> 02:40:38,130
was there essentially trying to 
negotiate,

3133
02:40:38,131 --> 02:40:43,131
find a loophole on behalf of Canada that
ben johnson would not be positive,

3134
02:40:43,800 --> 02:40:44,633
but that apparently he was just so 
radically positive and there was just 

3135
02:40:48,161 --> 02:40:48,994
like,
there was nothing that anybody could do 

3136
02:40:50,731 --> 02:40:52,430
about it.
It was just like a,

3137
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:55,170
hey,
we'd really like to help you,

3138
02:40:55,171 --> 02:40:57,630
but this is really,
really bad.

3139
02:40:57,670 --> 02:41:01,350
there's a lot of drugs.
I remember an article that described the

3140
02:41:01,351 --> 02:41:02,184
whites of his eyes being yellow because 
his liver was overwhelmed trying to 

3141
02:41:07,441 --> 02:41:09,960
process the amount of steroids,
women's body.

3142
02:41:10,270 --> 02:41:12,330
uh,
I mean he argues that the coaches,

3143
02:41:12,331 --> 02:41:14,640
you know,
that he had no idea that they had always

3144
02:41:15,300 --> 02:41:16,440
just kept telling them to just,
you know,

3145
02:41:16,441 --> 02:41:17,580
it's fine,
you're fine.

3146
02:41:17,580 --> 02:41:21,060
Don't worry about it.
Might be true,

3147
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:22,163
but I wonder what they really did think 
was gonna happen or how they thought 

3148
02:41:24,271 --> 02:41:25,690
they would pull it off.
Well,

3149
02:41:25,730 --> 02:41:26,563
I mean,
it was these kinds of scandals that 

3150
02:41:27,781 --> 02:41:28,614
forced the ioc to create water.
The world antidoping agency [inaudible] 

3151
02:41:32,381 --> 02:41:33,214
they looked at a brand and crisis.
And how were they gonna regain public 

3152
02:41:37,501 --> 02:41:39,060
trust?
Because the year was this.

3153
02:41:39,290 --> 02:41:42,900
This was a lot.
It gets established in 1999.

3154
02:41:43,800 --> 02:41:47,040
If I remember ben johnson was a.
That was the,

3155
02:41:47,050 --> 02:41:48,690
uh,
not the 84 olympics.

3156
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:50,700
It might've been the first olympics 
where they tested.

3157
02:41:50,701 --> 02:41:51,534
Yeah,
that was the 84 olympics were ben 

3158
02:41:52,591 --> 02:41:54,400
johnson was a,
uh,

3159
02:41:54,510 --> 02:41:56,430
was tested positive.
So maybe they just did,

3160
02:41:56,431 --> 02:41:57,264
but all the americans.
But according to everybody that I've 

3161
02:42:00,061 --> 02:42:00,894
talked to,
the entire american team was positive 

3162
02:42:02,791 --> 02:42:03,624
too,

3163
02:42:05,320 --> 02:42:08,710
was just so positive.
Too far.

3164
02:42:09,440 --> 02:42:11,800
You just,
you just pushed away to fuck.

3165
02:42:12,010 --> 02:42:14,200
But he looked like a freak to.
He was so jack,

3166
02:42:14,201 --> 02:42:16,000
he's so big.
It looks so different.

3167
02:42:16,001 --> 02:42:16,870
That stuff.
I mean,

3168
02:42:17,140 --> 02:42:17,973
we had a,
I think we have some footage of him in 

3169
02:42:19,301 --> 02:42:20,620
the,
in the film at the end.

3170
02:42:20,621 --> 02:42:23,140
I mean he,
I mean he is a machine.

3171
02:42:23,200 --> 02:42:24,033
Yeah.
He looks so different than the other 

3172
02:42:24,611 --> 02:42:27,190
track and field sprinter.
He has just a machine.

3173
02:42:27,191 --> 02:42:28,130
Yeah.
He looked like,

3174
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:29,313
like an mma fighter.
I mean it was just fucking look at a 

3175
02:42:31,990 --> 02:42:34,390
shocked look at that.
Guys still get Carl Lewis.

3176
02:42:34,391 --> 02:42:35,081
It's like,
shit,

3177
02:42:35,081 --> 02:42:39,980
I need a betteR doctor.
I mean he was jack.

3178
02:42:40,030 --> 02:42:41,470
Listen,
look at his shoulder there.

3179
02:42:41,590 --> 02:42:42,580
Everything.
Yeah.

3180
02:42:42,640 --> 02:42:46,270
shredded.
I mean Carl Lewis,

3181
02:42:46,750 --> 02:42:50,080
look at johnson and Carl Lewis was on 
some shit too.

3182
02:42:50,110 --> 02:42:50,943
That's what's really crazy.
It's like all these guys were on some 

3183
02:42:53,351 --> 02:42:56,290
shit.
I mean we have this idea like xyz.

3184
02:42:58,200 --> 02:43:02,980
Aida is a wearable for something like,
my god.

3185
02:43:03,310 --> 02:43:04,143
I mean we,
we have this idea that you'd be able to 

3186
02:43:05,411 --> 02:43:07,930
tell looking at someone whether or not 
they're on steroids.

3187
02:43:07,931 --> 02:43:09,880
That was always the idea.
Like the sniff test.

3188
02:43:09,910 --> 02:43:12,000
Well gregory,
the thing is I was

3189
02:43:12,010 --> 02:43:15,970
working with him over his son.
He'd run into guys and he'd be like,

3190
02:43:17,410 --> 02:43:19,370
he's on the hgh.
She's on hgh.

3191
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:21,250
Hgh.
Oh definitely.

3192
02:43:21,251 --> 02:43:22,084
I mean he could.
Gregory could just look at somebody and 

3193
02:43:24,161 --> 02:43:27,760
know whether or not they were like 
toping and there were a time,

3194
02:43:27,761 --> 02:43:29,470
you know,
because I was on this program for a year

3195
02:43:29,471 --> 02:43:30,370
and he looks at me,
he's like,

3196
02:43:30,830 --> 02:43:33,190
but I ended up taking too much hgh 
really.

3197
02:43:33,191 --> 02:43:34,190
So he cAn tell,
look,

3198
02:43:34,270 --> 02:43:37,210
do you know,
he is like looking at me and he's like,

3199
02:43:37,211 --> 02:43:39,060
you know,
seeing like your,

3200
02:43:39,061 --> 02:43:40,030
your,
your joel.

3201
02:43:40,050 --> 02:43:41,880
It's getting a little bigger,
your forehead,

3202
02:43:41,881 --> 02:43:42,860
these like you need to cut

3203
02:43:43,010 --> 02:43:46,900
down the dose voices perfect.
I mean he would,

3204
02:43:46,920 --> 02:43:49,570
it was just a,
you know,

3205
02:43:49,580 --> 02:43:50,400
he could just look at it

3206
02:43:50,400 --> 02:43:52,740
somebody and know,
like he just,

3207
02:43:52,741 --> 02:43:53,820
he,
he,

3208
02:43:53,821 --> 02:43:57,060
just,
anybody he knew and we would meet people

3209
02:43:57,061 --> 02:43:58,650
over that year.
Um,

3210
02:43:59,480 --> 02:44:00,313
was a funny story when I was in moscow,
when I go to meet him after this haute 

3211
02:44:05,410 --> 02:44:06,243
route,
whoa,

3212
02:44:06,360 --> 02:44:07,370
whoa.
Race and I,

3213
02:44:07,470 --> 02:44:09,150
and I bring with me,
which again,

3214
02:44:09,151 --> 02:44:11,130
we don't get into the film.
It's pretty crazy.

3215
02:44:11,131 --> 02:44:11,964
I'd had figured out essentially because 
I wasn't going to be tested every day 

3216
02:44:15,330 --> 02:44:16,960
that I was going to simulate the 
protocol.

3217
02:44:16,961 --> 02:44:19,080
So during this,
the second race,

3218
02:44:19,600 --> 02:44:24,600
I'm pinging every single night into 
ziploc bags and basically the ceiling,

3219
02:44:25,321 --> 02:44:26,154
the ziploc bag,
and storing this frozen urine unlike a 

3220
02:44:28,231 --> 02:44:29,064
little thermos.
And the idea is as I'm going to bring 

3221
02:44:31,141 --> 02:44:31,974
all my frozen urine with me to moscow 
and I had all these blood tests done to 

3222
02:44:36,031 --> 02:44:36,864
before,
after to build the biological passport 

3223
02:44:39,121 --> 02:44:41,130
and the,
and the steroid profile.

3224
02:44:41,960 --> 02:44:43,710
Um,
so I bring him,

3225
02:44:43,800 --> 02:44:44,790
you know,
like all my,

3226
02:44:44,880 --> 02:44:47,210
all my frozen urine,
uh,

3227
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:51,510
to moscow and uh,
and he had went into the process of,

3228
02:44:51,870 --> 02:44:53,110
of literally,
you know,

3229
02:44:53,250 --> 02:44:54,780
testing this,
this,

3230
02:44:54,840 --> 02:44:55,673
this urine that I'd brought them in,
ziploc bags that had smuggled with me 

3231
02:44:58,830 --> 02:45:00,420
into,
into Russia.

3232
02:45:00,870 --> 02:45:04,050
And um,
and the second part of the investigation

3233
02:45:04,051 --> 02:45:09,051
comes out before he's able to covertly 
test all of my urine within his lab,

3234
02:45:09,451 --> 02:45:13,680
which he shouldn't have been doing.
But I go to this birthday party and it's

3235
02:45:13,681 --> 02:45:15,450
the.
And in the film,

3236
02:45:15,451 --> 02:45:16,370
it's the,
it's.

3237
02:45:16,371 --> 02:45:17,204
I shot it on my iphone,
that scene of chaos with the birthday 

3238
02:45:20,191 --> 02:45:22,710
party.
And he's there and he's singing and he's

3239
02:45:22,711 --> 02:45:25,890
introducing me and he's doing karaoke 
and he's dancing.

3240
02:45:26,310 --> 02:45:30,300
So that party was for like a,
a russian gold metal,

3241
