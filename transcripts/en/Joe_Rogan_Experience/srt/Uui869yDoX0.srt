1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,100
Okay,
boom,

2
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:08,680
and we're live with joy ideas and Tj 
English.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,710
Uh,
Joey turned me onto you a long time ago.

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,130
Mr English.
Uh,

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:17,740
he gave me a copy of the westies right?
What year was that?

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,660
Ninety eight.
Ninety nine.

7
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:21,220
Long time ago.
He gave me that book.

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,150
It's fantastic.
Really fascinating stuff.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,420
First Book I published wasn't really 
westies yeah,

10
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:30,550
1990.
How'd you guys find out?

11
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:31,990
I'd be each other.
He wrote book

12
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,893
book.
A friend of mine turned me onto a book 

13
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:34,864
name Havana Nocturne that was a small 
book of fascinating read and I was just 

14
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:40,244
blown away by him and I went to a party 
one night and there was a literary 

15
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:44,630
agent,
Stan and I go,

16
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,400
you fucking guys read the van like 
during like an option that I was like,

17
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:50,234
that's fucking,
that's going to be a great book with 

18
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,304
just,
uh,

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,590
it broke down the,
the uh,

20
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,520
how Fidel took over it from three 
different cities,

21
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:02,090
how it was going down in three different
categories.

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,553
And then I heard that he was writing a 
book about West New York and you city 

23
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,940
Cubans where I grew up and I emailed him
and I told him who I was,

24
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:11,774
that my mother had a bar and I grew up 
in that shit and he hit me back and we 

25
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,140
became friends.
He came to a show and

26
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:19,920
yeah,

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,281
yeah.
Joe,

28
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,950
he reached out to me,
you know,

29
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,470
unfortunately when I was just about 
finishing this book,

30
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,520
so I had done most of the work and it 
was down on paper,

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,660
but it was a trip.
It was like he was,

32
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,523
he was like a character who walked out 
of the book and I wished I'd met him 

33
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,390
earlier because I hadn't met too many 
characters like him.

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,653
You need city's amazing place.
I don't think people realize that it's 

35
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,640
one of those little enclaves happens to 
be Cuban.

36
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,280
It's like a Mafia neighborhood,
but it was Cubans,

37
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,770
not Italians or it was like hell's 
kitchen,

38
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,710
which I wrote about in the Westies,
which was an Irish neighborhood,

39
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,540
very intense neighborhood.
A high premium on loyalty.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,873
I'm young males running loyalty games on
each other all the time from the age of 

41
00:02:06,571 --> 00:02:10,150
six,
so we didn't know how far you'll go turn

42
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,830
this sucker up.

43
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,230
How far?
How far will you go for me?

44
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,153
Uh,
you know,

45
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,230
uh,
what are you willing to do for me in the

46
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:20,820
case of Hell's kitchen in the westies it
was cut up bodies was not only would you

47
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,910
kill somebody for me,
but will you make the potty disappear?

48
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,373
And they tested each other with,
with the cutting up of the bodies and 

49
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,150
union city.
A lot of it was,

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,130
was political.
Some of it was political.

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,320
How antifa Idella you,
how badly do you want to kill,

52
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,213
you know,
Fidel and help us reclaim our last 

53
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,820
homeland.
That was kind of behind a lot of things.

54
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,654
It wasn't spoken about a lot,
but it was sort of the hidden 

55
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,180
motivation.
Westies was a really fantastic book.

56
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,463
Like you,
you went deep into that whole sort of 

57
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
sub scene.
You know,

58
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:57,954
it's a,
it's a very interesting crime infested 

59
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:00,814
area.

60
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,043
Well,
what,

61
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:05,410
what I try to do with these books is to 
tell the macro story.

62
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:10,470
The larger historical sociopolitical 
story and then get intimate and tell the

63
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,234
interpersonal stories between the 
characters that actually lived this 

64
00:03:16,281 --> 00:03:18,370
story.
That's a challenge.

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,233
You've got to find people who are 
willing to talk to you and share 

66
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,923
information with you that they've kept 
quiet probably most of their lives and 

67
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:28,144
then you get at the interpersonal stuff 
because these stories really are just 

68
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,730
human beings caught up in something 
that's bigger than them.

69
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,133
And how long when you,
when you're writing a book like the 

70
00:03:36,191 --> 00:03:37,024
corporation,
which is your new book or Westies are 

71
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,454
any of your books,
how much time do you spend doing the 

72
00:03:41,831 --> 00:03:44,260
research and how much time do you spend 
actually writing the book,

73
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,363
uh,
takes about three years to do these 

74
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:51,880
books on average and an n two of those 
years is research probably.

75
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,080
Wow.
Yeah.

76
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,990
So you do bring this to the Book 
Company,

77
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,850
the publisher and you say,
Hey,

78
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:01,450
this is what I want to write a book.
You do a proposal and I do very,

79
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:04,210
very detailed proposals for the 
corporation.

80
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:08,230
I did a proposal,
it was 125 pages long and it's a chapter

81
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,064
by chapter breakdown.
It's almost like a condensed version of 

82
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:16,411
the book and you get more money from a 
publisher that way as an advance because

83
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:19,630
you're showing them the whole thing 
practically.

84
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:22,390
They can see the finished product 
almost.

85
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,180
And also,
you know the movie interests.

86
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,630
There was movie interest in this one,
the corporation based on that,

87
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,940
on that proposal.
Interesting.

88
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,960
Yeah.
It was option to,

89
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:34,870
based on that proposal before I even 
started writing the book.

90
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,680
Real.
Yeah.

91
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,680
So what is the corporation about the 
corporation,

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,553
the story of the Cuban American 
organized crime organization that began 

93
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:48,610
in the mid 19 sixties and existed all 
the way to the end of the century and it

94
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:52,210
was led by this mobster named Jose 
Miguel battle,

95
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,313
who was kind of a legendary figure in 
Cuban American circles because he was a 

96
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:59,620
hero from the Bay of Pigs invasion.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,800
The,
uh,

98
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,910
the attempt to reclaim Cuba take back 
Cuba,

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,073
the invasion in 1961,
which was a disaster for everyone 

100
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:10,960
involved,
battle wound up in prison along with the

101
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:14,860
rest of the brigade.
And when he got out and came back to the

102
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:19,861
US,
he was determined to get Castro and take

103
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:20,824
back Cuba.
So he set up this criminal thing and it 

104
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,861
was based on a one racket primarily 
Bolita the number,

105
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,793
the lottery,
the illegal lottery for the lottery was 

106
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,783
illegal.
It was illegal and it was controlled by 

107
00:05:34,541 --> 00:05:37,240
organized crime.
And it was a huge moneymaker,

108
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,660
big money maker for the mob going back 
to the 19 twenties.

109
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,850
Everyone.
That's the number of little old ladies,

110
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,610
but the number of priests,
cops,

111
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,140
you know,
you can bet a nickel,

112
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,080
you can bet a dime.
You can bet $10,000,

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,220
hugely profitable for whoever controls 
and organizes it.

114
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,054
Well,
the Cubans controlled and organized it 

115
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,064
on the eastern coast of the United 
States from New Jersey and New York all 

116
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,730
the way down to Miami.

117
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,900
And the guy who controlled it was battle
and he became legendary.

118
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,734
Based on that,
they controlled the whole number system 

119
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:11,190
because I know there's a lot of Italians
that were involved.

120
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,760
They went to the Mafia.
One of the first things battle.

121
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,490
That battle had been a cop of ice cop in
Havana in the 19 fifties.

122
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,740
During the.
For the turnover.

123
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,593
Yeah.
During the era when the mob joey was 

124
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:26,180
talking about Havana Nocturne.
That's what that book was about.

125
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,910
The era of the mob in Havana in the 
fifties.

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,803
Meyer Lansky Santa traffic content and 
how they controlled that until Castro 

127
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:34,854
came along and spoiled the party and the
revolution happened and they got chased 

128
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,343
out of their battle.
Had been a vice cop in Havana during 

129
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,170
those years.
And he knew all those,

130
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,590
uh,
high ranking mobsters in effect.

131
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,443
He was a bag man who delivered money 
from the Skimm at the casinos in Havana 

132
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,530
to the presidential palace.

133
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,970
So battle knew how the world went round 
and he made those connections.

134
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:02,090
And when he finally gets to the US and 
wants to start his own thing,

135
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,340
first thing he does is go to Santa 
Traffic.

136
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,174
Content says,
can you make the proper introductions 

137
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:08,234
for me?
Profit content introduces him to fat 

138
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:15,140
Tony Salerno in New York City who 
controls the numbers racket for all five

139
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:17,480
families and battle says,
look,

140
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:21,140
things are changing in Cuba over the 
next couple of decades.

141
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:21,974
You're going to have tens of thousands,
if not hundreds of thousands of Cubans 

142
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:28,400
coming to live in the United States.
They all bet the number.

143
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,773
That's a huge market.
If you let me take over this thing and 

144
00:07:32,901 --> 00:07:35,030
organize it,
you will get a piece of,

145
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,390
you will get your piece of everything.
And the Mafia said yes.

146
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,440
And so the Cubans took over and they 
control everything.

147
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:43,274
I mean,
in New York City in the seventies and 

148
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:45,854
eighties,
there were probably 200 to 300 belita 

149
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,260
spots where you could go bet the number.

150
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,810
That's the Cubans call it bullying a 
little ball.

151
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,560
And uh,
so they controlled it and they took care

152
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:02,561
of the mafia and everybody was got fat 
and happy for awhile until it turned bad

153
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:05,390
and they started killing each other.
Now,

154
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,980
when Joey,
when you heard about this book,

155
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,843
this is something that you were very 
intimately involved in when you were a 

156
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:10,900
kid.
Very,

157
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,710
you know,
I come on your show and I'll tell you,

158
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,330
there's 100 stories I could tell you 
there's a thousand dollars I can't.

159
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,710
And when he told,
when I read the thesis for this book,

160
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,560
I just knew,
I just fucking know,

161
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,013
you know,
I grew up in numbers when I went to 

162
00:08:27,411 --> 00:08:32,411
Catholic school on Saturdays when I came
home on Fridays and Saturdays at the age

163
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,390
of Eight,
I was sent to different locations in the

164
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:36,320
city,
the bronx,

165
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,650
Brooklyn and I will make $50 going to 
the errands,

166
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:41,870
running numbers.
Go tell this guy.

167
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,630
The first number of the day is to,
you know.

168
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,583
So I grew up in it.
I grew up in a house where the bookie 

169
00:08:48,231 --> 00:08:51,830
would call my mother by 3:00 and go,
what's the numbers for the day?

170
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,930
And My mother would give him a fucking 
laundry list,

171
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,800
you know.
And uh,

172
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
it's very interesting in this book he 
also covers the mysticism of the number.

173
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,733
So if I'm at your house and your 
daughter walks in with a hockey shirt 

174
00:09:07,651 --> 00:09:10,380
and her number is 13,
I'll look at you and go,

175
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,214
Joe,
give me a number from zero to nine five 

176
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,970
and pick up the phone.
I bet.

177
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:15,870
Five,
13.

178
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,590
If I look out my window and the cop cars
is five.

179
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,580
Oh six.
I put $5 on five or six.

180
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,270
If I have a dream about an eagle,
when I go down to the belief that spot,

181
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,730
there's books that they sell,
books or dreams.

182
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,530
And I take that book and I look up Eagle
Eagles number eight.

183
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,660
I pay eight.
13.

184
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:37,951
It's,
you know,

185
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:38,784
you,
you were mentioning a couple months ago 

186
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:43,290
that your grandmother took numbers.
Grandmother was Sicilian.

187
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,130
Sicilian people have the same,
uh,

188
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,320
everyday they live today's today.
Yesterday's the day.

189
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,153
Joe Rohde.
Yup.

190
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,950
Today's the day.
I'm hitting the number.

191
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,160
I'm not getting.
You know,

192
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,810
she talks about that dream,
that dream.

193
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,763
Again,
we're going back with the immigrant 

194
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,400
mentality.
But those three numbers today,

195
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,250
if God wants,
if God is real,

196
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,750
what he says,
it's true.

197
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:11,870
Might number's gonna come out today.
One is my ship going to come in that you

198
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:13,644
work a plain Jane dream you wrote,
you're a blue collar person and on the 

199
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:19,720
way home,
every day by 3:30 you put the number and

200
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,230
that's it.
That's what you do.

201
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:27,260
Something to believe in.
Something believe in numerology and with

202
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:30,870
q and a.
It was very mystical.

203
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,763
It was tied into a dreams and belief.
The idea was you bet the number and you 

204
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:40,860
try to make your dreams come true.
That's literally what you're doing.

205
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,360
You're trying to make your dreams come 
true,

206
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,640
and the belief that guides the bullied 
thoreau's the ones who control it there,

207
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,483
the dream makers,
they're the guys who are making it 

208
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,210
possible for your dreams to come true.

209
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,400
So they had tremendous stature in the 
community community.

210
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,560
Every dream solver.
So you work t j's Jose battle and you're

211
00:11:00,631 --> 00:11:01,464
an independent booking.
Your job is to sit at a bar and lounge 

212
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:10,020
in western New York from 10 to three 
drinking and all day long people come in

213
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,830
and go,
Joe,

214
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:13,260
give me five slash 17,
$3.

215
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,891
Give me three.
Oh,

216
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:17,460
three one doll at 3:00,
3:30 a number comes up.

217
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,670
If that number wins,
if I give you $500,

218
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,863
you get $3,000 from battle.
You give me 2,500 so you make $500 off 

219
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,170
the top.
And then I tip.

220
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,004
Yet,
the thing that battle did was he didn't 

221
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:32,244
take 10 points.
He let you run your independent action 

222
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,940
unless you called it in to him,
you know,

223
00:11:38,941 --> 00:11:40,920
it's very,
you'll watch the movie.

224
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:42,330
Uh,
uh,

225
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,130
what's smooth Mickey Rourke and the 
train these people a year,

226
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:48,990
the Dragon,
great fucking movie,

227
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,590
great movie.

228
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,170
When he says,
you know,

229
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,013
for years the Chinese will bring it into
heroin and they were selling it to the 

230
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:55,690
Italians,
you know,

231
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,553
$50,000 investment to make you $500,000.
Chinese weren't saying that like they 

232
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,880
weren't seeing that.
Why?

233
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:06,100
Because they didn't have,
they couldn't bring it out,

234
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,263
they couldn't sell it.
Black people and Spanish people bitch 

235
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,744
slap them to death.
So the same thing happened with Bolita 

236
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,710
Fat Tony Salerno knew that he had a big 
thing coming with the Cubans.

237
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,990
The Cubans want to put a bedroom with 
Cubans.

238
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,543
Hm.
Yeah.

239
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,383
Do you understand the Italians?
They want to put a bedroom with 

240
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,610
Italians,
Puerto Ricans.

241
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,330
They want to put a better than with a 
Puerto Rican.

242
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,040
It's not a big thing.
That was with the numbers.

243
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,700
It was that there was a community thing.
Let's talk about the numbers.

244
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,973
Like the lottery is some sort of a 
government funded thing and it seems 

245
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,030
like it's got a lot of red tape and 
official and there's no wiggle room.

246
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,203
The,
the numbers seemed to be closer to like 

247
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,300
the community,

248
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,620
especially with Latinos.
Especially with lucky.

249
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,040
Yeah.
It was the,

250
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,933
in some ways the core of the community,
the number of spots where everybody 

251
00:12:55,701 --> 00:12:57,020
would hang out.
You go to here,

252
00:12:57,021 --> 00:13:02,021
the neighborhood lobola and the gossip 
in the streets.

253
00:13:02,221 --> 00:13:04,310
He'd go there and here in the 
neighborhood gossip.

254
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,650
Uh,
yeah.

255
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,683
And,
and it was never meant to be violent 

256
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,200
back in Cuba.
Belita was not violent.

257
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:15,680
It was illegal,
but it wasn't violent and it turned very

258
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:20,681
violent in the United States.
The corporation became so profitable.

259
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,673
I mean,
we're talking about millions of dollars 

260
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:24,374
on a monthly basis,
billions of dollars over the course of 

261
00:13:27,351 --> 00:13:28,184
the life of this organization,
billions of dollars more than they 

262
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:32,990
could.
The artist thing they had was what to do

263
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:34,310
with the money.
I mean,

264
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:34,851
they,
they,

265
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:35,684
they would literally strap money to 
people to as money couriers to try to 

266
00:13:39,891 --> 00:13:40,724
get it out of the country to get it into
getting into offshore bank accounts and 

267
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:45,790
launder the money.

268
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,240
They had more money than they knew what 
it was.

269
00:13:47,241 --> 00:13:50,060
A license to print money,
which hugely profitable.

270
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,313
That's what made it violent.
Then you started having gangsters vying 

271
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:57,560
for territory,
territorial disputes,

272
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,180
greed,
greed took over.

273
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,290
And it got very ugly nose.
This between Cubans,

274
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:06,320
between Cubans,
between the Cubans and the Italians.

275
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,573
See,
this guy battle was very charismatic 

276
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,780
leader,
uh,

277
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,543
with some great leadership qualities.
He'd been a hero in the Bay of Pigs 

278
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,830
invasion.
He saved some guys lives.

279
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,590
Um,
when I first heard that story,

280
00:14:21,591 --> 00:14:22,640
I didn't.
I said,

281
00:14:22,641 --> 00:14:23,474
I got to verify that maybe this is just 
the story I got told about himself to 

282
00:14:27,141 --> 00:14:27,974
burnish his legend.
So I found the guys that he saved and I 

283
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:33,914
found the guys,
two brothers who went with him to save 

284
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,423
that,
the guys that he saved and I went to 

285
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:42,770
Cuba,
to the Bay of pigs to the exact location

286
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,400
where he saved these guys to verify this
story.

287
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,020
And it was absolutely true.
He and in an act of incredible heroism,

288
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,530
he saved the life of a number of his 
platoon members.

289
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,540
And so that was his reputation.
From then on,

290
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,393
he was revered in the community.
He was a hero and people defended him 

291
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:02,834
even even when it turned ugly.
And he became a ruthless boss who was 

292
00:15:06,621 --> 00:15:07,454
killing people left and right.
He had his defenders because of his 

293
00:15:10,611 --> 00:15:15,611
legend as a hero in the community.
And so the power that he had.

294
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,490
But he also had this,
uh,

295
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,810
joey and I were talking about this 
tubing tab.

296
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,040
This Latinos have this.
Everybody has it,

297
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:30,041
but Cubans have a desire for revenge.
This guy,

298
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,513
you know,
the Bay of Pigs invasion was an attempt 

299
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,110
that revenge to get revenge against 
Castro.

300
00:15:36,111 --> 00:15:38,630
And they were humiliated by that 
process.

301
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,823
And a lot of the guys from that 
generation had an unfinished agenda for 

302
00:15:44,631 --> 00:15:45,170
revenge.

303
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,310
So if you wrong this guy battle in any 
way he was going to get you,

304
00:15:49,311 --> 00:15:51,740
even if it took years and years of 
calculation.

305
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,960
I mean,
there are stories in the book about this

306
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,520
one guy who killed his brother named 
Pilou.

307
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,853
He took,
it took nine years and 12 attempts 

308
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,180
before they finally killed this guy 
polluted.

309
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,510
They shot him in his hospital.
He was in the hospital,

310
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:06,344
they shot him,
had an assassin dressed up as a male 

311
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:08,954
nurse and go into the hospital and shoot
him between the eyes because there had 

312
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,710
been so many failed attempts.
They weren't going to fail this time.

313
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,330
And that's embattled for 12 years.
I took night and kissed his ass.

314
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,900
No,
never caught him.

315
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,620
No,
no bank disappeared.

316
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,410
And I believe the assassin got killed 
later because he was talking about it,

317
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,630
having done it.
And so battle had him killed.

318
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,980
Wow.
Yeah.

319
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,473
So that the revenge motive,
the revenge motive Kinda drove battle 

320
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,390
off the deep end.
And uh,

321
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,460
somewhere along the line he broke bad,
so to speak.

322
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,470
I mean,
I don't know if he was ever good and had

323
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,304
to break bad,
but he started doing internal killings 

324
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:50,780
that really had nothing to do about 
business.

325
00:16:50,781 --> 00:16:52,940
They're all about revenge.
Well,

326
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,210
this is a theme that happens a lot with 
organized crime people.

327
00:16:56,211 --> 00:16:57,044
Right?
It's like they just get a taste of 

328
00:16:57,711 --> 00:16:58,040
killing

329
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,850
people and it becomes easier and easier.
And then that was the thing about murder

330
00:17:01,851 --> 00:17:02,684
machine,
right?

331
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,660
About Roy Demeo.
Yeah.

332
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,910
It just was killing people.
Nothing to it.

333
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,660
After awhile.
And that's another book you gave me.

334
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,653
I was reading all those books on the 
road because I was auditioning for so 

335
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:17,960
many Italian roles.
I never really knew the history of it,

336
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,143
so I was just trying to read all those 
books just so when I went in I had an 

337
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:25,010
idea of what these characters and who 
they were.

338
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,490
I saw them growing up.
I saw these guys,

339
00:17:28,491 --> 00:17:29,450
you know,
growing up,

340
00:17:29,451 --> 00:17:30,284
I just didn't.
The interesting thing about this book 

341
00:17:32,241 --> 00:17:36,830
was talking to the Bay of Pacers that 
they knew that they were coming,

342
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,970
like for dumb,
no common.

343
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,380
He put Bob wire or something and his 
quarterly,

344
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,390
the soldiers all slashed their feet as 
they were landing.

345
00:17:47,391 --> 00:17:49,860
There was four battalions.
Uh,

346
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:50,010
I

347
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,800
think the 250,
you know what happened when they landed,

348
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,860
there were Klieg lights set up on the 
beach.

349
00:17:55,861 --> 00:17:56,411
Yeah.
They knew that.

350
00:17:56,411 --> 00:17:59,430
They landed,
they flipped the lights on and it lit it

351
00:17:59,431 --> 00:18:01,680
up like a movie set.
Right?

352
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:04,830
When these guys landed Jesus,
they got slaughtered,

353
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,083
they got slaughtered,
and they felt they'd been betrayed by 

354
00:18:08,611 --> 00:18:10,320
Kennedy,
you know,

355
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:13,710
that they were supposed to be air cover 
and the air cover never came.

356
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,290
And why was that?
Because Kennedy,

357
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,303
Kennedy always had this operation was 
started by the Eisenhower 

358
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:23,940
Administration.
And the CIA was a CIA operation.

359
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,240
Kennedy inherited it and he never 
really.

360
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,280
He always had mixed feelings about it.
I mean,

361
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:31,830
it was illegal.
It was a,

362
00:18:31,831 --> 00:18:33,960
uh,
an illegal secret,

363
00:18:33,961 --> 00:18:38,370
covert operation and attempt to 
overthrow a government.

364
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,650
It would have been seen as an illegal 
activity,

365
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,503
the eyes of the world to do it.
So Kennedy was trying to do it so it 

366
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,004
could be done in such a way that it 
could never blow back on his 

367
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:51,330
administration,
and so he,

368
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,270
he withheld air cover at a crucial point
in that,

369
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,620
in that war lasted three days and they 
got slaughtered and they got in,

370
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,180
they got imprisoned and they had a lot 
of resentment towards Kennedy.

371
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,223
I mean,
I go into the book though a little bit 

372
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:10,410
about the Kennedy assassination and the 
belief that a lot of that,

373
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,244
a handful of those Cubans may have been 
involved in the Kennedy assassination 

374
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:14,844
along with the Italians,
with the mob because they were working 

375
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:21,030
hand in hand with the CIA.
Yeah.

376
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:21,864
That was one of the leading conspiracies
outside of the CIA killing him and even 

377
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:29,090
the CIA killing him was a part of the 
bay,

378
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,203
the Bay of pigs conspiracy and also the.
The idea that he wanted to disband the 

379
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,284
CIA.
There was a really interesting article 

380
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,830
recently.
There was dismissing almost every single

381
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,890
conspiracy theory about the Kennedy 
assassination.

382
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,380
They said,
except the CIA one,

383
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:47,190
there's legitimate possibilities that 
the CIO.

384
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,920
Well,
you can bet your ass that if the CIA was

385
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:53,160
involved in Cubans orange.
Now let me ask something in the book.

386
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,130
You speak about Fidel's Mr.

387
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,623
Yeah.
He got one with her at this particular 

388
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:00,750
one.
Merita.

389
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:04,410
She had gone to New Orleans or the 
Dallas.

390
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,660
My Retail Lorena.
This is very interesting,

391
00:20:06,661 --> 00:20:08,550
notorious figure.
She had a child with him,

392
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,413
uh,
and had an abortion and didn't have the 

393
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,230
child.
She got pregnant with Fidel.

394
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,180
In fact,
Castro admitted as much.

395
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,220
She got pregnant with Castro.
She had a,

396
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:22,490
she had an abortion and then the CIA 
used her to try to assassinate Castro.

397
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,860
She had was supposed to slip him a pill 
and she put it in her face cream and the

398
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,144
pill dissolves in her face cream and 
that was the pill she was going to try 

399
00:20:35,881 --> 00:20:36,714
to slip to Castro her.
Her case agent was a guy named frank 

400
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:44,340
sturgeous who wound up being one of the 
Watergate burglars.

401
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,590
See the thing about Bay of pigs and the 
Cubans,

402
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,343
the Bay of Pigs invasion is the key to 
understanding the whole ladder part of 

403
00:20:52,871 --> 00:20:56,740
the 20th century politics in the United 
States.

404
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,550
The Cold War,
because the alliance between the CIA and

405
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:01,384
the Cubans rears its head constantly 
throughout the latter part of the 20th 

406
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:07,930
century.
The Watergate burglary,

407
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,480
five out of seven of the burglars were 
Cubans.

408
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,100
Bay of Pigs Veterans Day had been 
recruited by a guy named Ed Howard Hunt.

409
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,820
CIA agent who was one of the 
orchestrators of the Bay of pigs.

410
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:19,654
Invasion was also one of the people that
on his deathbed said that he was 

411
00:21:22,391 --> 00:21:24,010
involved in the assassination of 
Kennedy.

412
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,270
Yes.
This.

413
00:21:25,271 --> 00:21:27,490
So the CIA would come to these Cuban 
exiles,

414
00:21:27,491 --> 00:21:29,200
the militant exiles,
and they'd say,

415
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,350
go do this operation,
go do this burglary at the,

416
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,020
at the Watergate,
and then we go get fidel,

417
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:38,650
go do this assassination.
And then we go get fidel.

418
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,543
And the Cubans were always ready and 
willing because it was all leading back 

419
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,630
to getting.
It was all leading back to.

420
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,450
Did you ever see the images of what they
said was Ed Howard Hunt?

421
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,020
He was one of the people that was 
arrested.

422
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,850
There was a series of,
um,

423
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,773
uh,
there was a bunch of guys that were 

424
00:21:53,321 --> 00:21:54,154
arrested that were on trains that were 
calling them hobos were all very well 

425
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,774
dressed,
right,

426
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,900
that were near where the grassy knoll 
men on the grass.

427
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,680
Oh,
there's lots of rumors about that,

428
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:05,514
that Howard hunt was one of those men.
There was even a reference that Jose 

429
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,833
Miguel battle was one of those men,
but that couldn't have been the case 

430
00:22:12,641 --> 00:22:16,480
because he was in the army at the time 
of the US army.

431
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,910
Um,
no,

432
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,570
so,
so it's like a,

433
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:24,610
it's like a subterranean narrative that 
runs through the latter part of the 20th

434
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,444
century,
the CIA and right wing elements in 

435
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,003
American politics using the Cuban 
Americans to do all kinds of dirty 

436
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,104
covert deeds.
And we're talking about terrorist 

437
00:22:37,061 --> 00:22:37,894
activity.
Assassination of an ambassador from 

438
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:41,284
Chile,
right in Washington DC blew up his car 

439
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,820
because he was sympathetic to Castro.

440
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,043
A bomb planted on a Cuban,
a jetliner flying from Panama City to 

441
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:51,904
advantage 73 people killed.
Innocent people occluding the fencing 

442
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:57,970
team from Cuba.
Young people,

443
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:03,050
a dirty war,
a dirty war was waged by the anti-castro

444
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,760
underground,
uh,

445
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,310
in combination in partnership with the 
CIA and this,

446
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,030
we know about it now because a lot of it
has been declassified and it's come out,

447
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:16,150
we didn't know about it at the time it 
was taking place,

448
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:21,100
why they blow up the plane,
just an act of terrorism against Cuba to

449
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:21,934
uh,
to show them that it could be done to 

450
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:27,220
instill fear and paranoia in the queue.
The,

451
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,183
the concept was to destabilize the Cuban
government so they'd be vulnerable and 

452
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:34,210
then you could take them over.
So any,

453
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,420
any act against Cuba.
I mean asking why blow the plane would,

454
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,860
is asking like why fly planes into the 
World Trade Center?

455
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,160
You know,
it was just a destructive act.

456
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,020
It's pretty amazing how resilient Castro
was.

457
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,190
I mean,
unbelievable.

458
00:23:49,191 --> 00:23:53,780
The guy's 90 miles away from Miami and 
just ran shit through the sixties,

459
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:55,130
the seventies,
the eighties,

460
00:23:55,131 --> 00:23:55,964
the nineties into the 2000.
They say there was something like 632 

461
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:05,730
known plots to over over the course of 
four or five decades to kill category.

462
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,760
Incredible.
Six hundred and 32,

463
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,910
that's 101 ways to kill Fidel.
And he went to,

464
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,220
he got a little train in New York and 
they're like,

465
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,063
are you fucking crazy?
And they checked the see the other 

466
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,870
bullet proof vest anomalies.
Like,

467
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,020
no,
he took the train to you.

468
00:24:21,021 --> 00:24:23,990
Went wow.
Like he's fucking nuts.

469
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,780
He was fucking nuts.
So,

470
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:27,830
so,
um,

471
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,263
what makes this,
this gangster story of the corporation 

472
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:35,690
so interesting and different is this 
political context,

473
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:36,763
the framework that all this shit was 
taking place against the backdrop of 

474
00:24:40,911 --> 00:24:43,730
this desire to kill Castro and take 
back,

475
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,863
take back the homeland and anyone who 
was involved in that was seen as a hero 

476
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:49,580
within the community.

477
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,280
Joey can tell you about that.
Union city,

478
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:56,720
New Jersey and Miami where the hotbeds 
of the anti-castro movement.

479
00:24:56,721 --> 00:24:57,554
There were,
where it was an organization in Union 

480
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,200
city called Omega seven and there was 
one in Miami called Alpha 66.

481
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,363
These were terror organizations,
secret organizations that existed to 

482
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,003
plant bombs.
They would plant bombs at embassies in 

483
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:13,761
the united,
you know,

484
00:25:13,761 --> 00:25:15,890
in New York City.
They would put,

485
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,860
they would put bombs at Lincoln Center 
when a,

486
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,723
when a,
when an orchestra from Cuba was making 

487
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:22,694
an appearance,
they were trying to shut down any 

488
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,323
relationship between the US and Cuba and
governments that were sympathetic to 

489
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:32,180
Cuba.
They would,

490
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,660
they would do actions against them.
And this went on for like 40 years.

491
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:36,950
Man.
That's unbelievable.

492
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,800
You mentioned for dome the Seventies in 
Union city,

493
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,440
like a joke.
It's not a joke.

494
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,180
Don't even don't even bring them up dog,
because you will get some mad now.

495
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,470
Was there any pro for Dell support 
amongst Cubans?

496
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:54,380
There was and bad things would happen to
them.

497
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,260
Um,
in the United States and Cuba though.

498
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:00,550
What about in Cuba Pro Castro,
India.

499
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,550
Oh yeah,
sure.

500
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,830
I mean,
was it real or was it out of?

501
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,570
Fear is real.
It's real.

502
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,520
I mean,
I've been there numerous times,

503
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,040
you know,
the killing people made a choice,

504
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,263
uh,
and the revolution I believe would have 

505
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:19,061
happened with or without Fidel Castro.
I'm the guy who was in power bi.

506
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:22,490
Tiesta had taken over the government and
the coup d'etat,

507
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,360
he wasn't elected,
so he was kind of a fraudulent president

508
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,613
and there was an ever since he got in,
people knew it was a fraudulent 

509
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,750
president and there was attempts to try 
to ouster him and that's why he was such

510
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,790
a dictator.
He knew they wanted the house to him,

511
00:26:37,791 --> 00:26:38,624
so he used the military to repress any 
kind of movement against him and it was 

512
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:46,710
ugly and the people rose up against it.
That's what happened.

513
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:47,544
It wasn't so in my belief,
the revolution in Cuba happened for a 

514
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:55,380
very legitimate reason.
After it happened in power,

515
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:59,430
it was revealed that Castro and Che 
Guevara were communists.

516
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,720
He casta was very cagey about that.
During the revolution,

517
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:07,740
they never talked about Marxism and 
being communists or any of that,

518
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,200
and in fact,
fidel came to union city,

519
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,423
came to the United States to raise money
for the revolution while it was going 

520
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:15,630
on.
Got arrested.

521
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,760
My friend's mom,
the escalades,

522
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,420
says,
she says,

523
00:27:21,421 --> 00:27:22,254
she still remembers taking the bus in 
the morning in union city and Fidel's 

524
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,770
welcome to underwhelm talking to you.
How you doing?

525
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,920
Susan,
what's going on?

526
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,370
Wow.
He got in a bar room room.

527
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,120
He got in a bar room argument in a union
city and he got arrested over what,

528
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,990
a probably politics.
I'm sure it was a political discussion.

529
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,420
Um,
so,

530
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,470
so then the revolution happened and,
and you know,

531
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:52,010
Cuba becomes a repressive communist 
Stalinist dictatorship.

532
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:56,730
But a lot of Cubans,
the way they saw it as,

533
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,400
that was the choice they made to go with
Fidel.

534
00:27:59,401 --> 00:28:02,250
He did have a,
I think the,

535
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,143
the,
uh,

536
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,030
popularity of the people following of 
the people.

537
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Some people are quite proud of Castro 
standing up to the United States.

538
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,913
Cubans are very proud people and they 
take a lot of pride in the fact that 

539
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,810
even though there's so much hardship 
there that um,

540
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,490
it's a choice they made to go in this 
direction.

541
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:26,460
At least they have their,
their self pride,

542
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,230
uh,
which is more in the,

543
00:28:29,231 --> 00:28:33,990
can be said in some ways about Puerto 
Rico and Jamaica and Dominican Republic,

544
00:28:33,991 --> 00:28:38,991
all these other countries in that region
that are just as poor as Cuba.

545
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,690
Um,
so he has his supporters.

546
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:44,880
He always had his support.
Obviously.

547
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:48,600
He also had his detractors even within 
Cuba.

548
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,563
Um,
most of those people are the ones who 

549
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:55,581
got on rafts and tried to leave the 
island at great risk to themselves to do

550
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:56,904
anything to get out of there because 
they realize fidel was so popular from 

551
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:01,824
within the country.
You are never gonna be able to take him 

552
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:04,824
down.
So they made the decision to go out in 

553
00:29:06,721 --> 00:29:07,554
the ocean and try to brave the risks of,
of either swimming or sailing or across 

554
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,660
the Florida Straits,

555
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,773
what the fuck happened with Che Guevara.
How did Che Guevara all of a sudden 

556
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,963
emerge as this leftist political icon,
but in this really weird sort of 

557
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:28,594
clueless way.
Like they really didn't understand his 

558
00:29:30,281 --> 00:29:31,114
background,
really didn't understand who he was and 

559
00:29:32,231 --> 00:29:34,870
what he had done and the atrocities that
he had committed.

560
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,730
But these fucking tee shirts that all 
these dopey liberal kids,

561
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,800
those fucking things.
That's fucking crazy.

562
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:43,390
If you find out who that guy is,
your,

563
00:29:43,391 --> 00:29:48,391
you're wearing a mass murderers t shirt,
like he was a fucking ruthless cut.

564
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:54,030
And these people are wearing this shirt 
is if he symbols symbolizes like liberty

565
00:29:54,941 --> 00:29:58,160
or freedom from an oppressive government
or something like that.

566
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:58,994
It's.
But it was a long period of time where 

567
00:30:01,061 --> 00:30:01,894
you didn't have any Che Guevara.
There was no discussion of it and that 

568
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:08,320
it seems like somewhere in the two 
thousands it picked up.

569
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,154
Am I right?

570
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,180
Yeah.
Eight.

571
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:14,200
Let me tell you something.
It was so personal for awhile.

572
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,343
Like I have Argentinian friends,
but in the seventies there was a rift 

573
00:30:19,511 --> 00:30:23,980
between Argentenians in Cuba.
That's how personal it is.

574
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,900
Argentinians is Argentina and there was 
a rift like because of him,

575
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,793
because of him like Cuban.
Is the FEC data here really welcomed 

576
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:35,490
that extra the fuck?
What is that?

577
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,600
They talk how they talk to Phillip?
Yeah.

578
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:49,330
What humans would go off and union city 
of you were Argentinian really?

579
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:52,540
That's how deep age and read Cuban 
Spanish.

580
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,440
How did the list thing,
where did that come from?

581
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,360
Why?
I don't know.

582
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,040
It's just a regional,
regional thing and they.

583
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:06,910
They're the number one on the top.
Like if a,

584
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,170
if a Cuban what?
Look.

585
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,430
Look at Cuba's,
the is considered the that were the Jews

586
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:15,850
of the Caribbean,
but Spain as one old,

587
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:16,933
like people,
like my father's family was from Spain 

588
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,580
and I went there one time and never went
back.

589
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,850
Really get one time to meet my 
grandmother.

590
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:25,990
Never went back.
Why?

591
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:31,000
Because she was talking shit.
No one at five talk to me.

592
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:36,001
That shit about my mother got me hooked 
up to my mother.

593
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,700
She Spain is the colonial powers,
the colonial often,

594
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:44,500
often Spaniard to look down on the 
Cubans and Mexicans I'm sure as well.

595
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,030
So I went over there one time.
My mom took me to meet my grandmother in

596
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,870
like 10 minutes and would call my 
mother,

597
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:50,890
you fucking cunt.

598
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:52,923
My mother came over and goes,
what happened and what this fucking 

599
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:58,510
bitch is talking about.
She was about five.

600
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:01,930
My mother cursed her out.
My relationship.

601
00:32:01,931 --> 00:32:03,010
She was like,
my father was,

602
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,133
your father is going to be at that 
because she was from Cama way so that 

603
00:32:07,271 --> 00:32:10,720
shit didn't stink.
My mom was a peasant from Havana,

604
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:13,930
so she was at.
My son had big dreams until he met your,

605
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,040
your that animal.
Fuck you.

606
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:22,790
You fucking like she made my mother 
moved in with him in Cuba.

607
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:26,950
They learn how to cook the dishes.
Cc'd Spaniard would be offended.

608
00:32:26,951 --> 00:32:29,650
Just by the way Cubans speak Spanish.
Yes,

609
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,440
but really like a lot of people tortured
me when they did the.

610
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,070
I don't speak Cuban Spanish.
I speak.

611
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,420
I speak the Spanish or the streets.
That Spanish.

612
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:43,810
I picked up in union city that streets 
by.

613
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,590
Let me stop me now when I'm on.

614
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,433
Huh?
Anybody that gave you a hard time about 

615
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:48,800
translating.
This is what I always tell people.

616
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,350
I'll talk in English.
Repeat what I said.

617
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,120
Good luck in English.
Yeah,

618
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,630
it's fucking hard.
It's hard to remember what someone said.

619
00:32:56,631 --> 00:33:00,100
Especially Yoga was speaking to these 
long sentences and you were translate.

620
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,100
You did a great job,
but my Spanish is.

621
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,020
Instead of giving me $5,
I want to mold a mold.

622
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,930
That means or none.
We don't say nothing because in my world

623
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,090
attend spot is a.
I forget what it is.

624
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,310
There's a name for it.
Yeah,

625
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,153
for everything.
I learned how to speak Spanish and code 

626
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,383
a peeler.
That means keep your eyes open and put 

627
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,370
your batteries in your.
When I say to you,

628
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,090
that means you got to put your batteries
in.

629
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,830
So I learned that street.
Is this a Bergen County street thing?

630
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,191
No,
no,

631
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:34,340
no.

632
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,470
This is Hudson county.
It's a Cuban.

633
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,780
I word my.
Yeah,

634
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:43,940
but it INA,
we talking Cubans in the US or like when

635
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:47,210
I talk,
when I talked to my sister on the phone,

636
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,790
I have no idea what you said.
Really.

637
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,860
Like when she gives me an address and 
shit.

638
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,590
Anyway,
the ours and all that.

639
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:58,190
I took Italian in high school.
I didn't take basic Spanish.

640
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:01,700
I learned how to read Spanish in the 
house by reading different things,

641
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,163
but I learned how to speak Spanish.
Like I remember going as a Cuban 

642
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:06,854
person's house once and you didn't city 
when I was about 12 and they told their 

643
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,070
son,
don't bring this kid over here.

644
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,200
He's a street fucking SPEC.

645
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,250
St's back.
I learned.

646
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,550
I'll say they get on a long time though.
I didn't learn that traditional Spanish.

647
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,970
My Spanish is a lot of hands.
Segment was oil.

648
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:31,100
I see.
I see the people,

649
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,653
that means watch him,
watch him and don't fucking not watch 

650
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:37,940
them a lot.
It's a lot of street shit.

651
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,240
I was never allowed to walk home the 
same way.

652
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,400
You had to walk on different directions,
different directions to keep the car.

653
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,890
Don't,
don't put it in my mother's operation.

654
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,090
I could never just walk home on Burger 
line to walk to New York Avenue.

655
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,490
We'll walk down just to see if I saw a 
suspicious car.

656
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,420
Now.
That's smart.

657
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,740
Were you remembering?
You remember?

658
00:34:57,741 --> 00:35:00,680
We were in San Francisco about 15 years 
ago and we had the Cru,

659
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,180
tate,
Eddie,

660
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,363
uh,
you may Red Duncan and Redman will 

661
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,670
walking down the street in San 
Francisco.

662
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,820
As we approached and I saw a drug deal 
go down.

663
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,100
I hit already going.
I already look at that drug.

664
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:14,720
Do you guys were looking at the whole 
thing?

665
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:20,170
Not One of you saw it already goes.
How the fuck did you see that?

666
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:22,123
Because I was raised like that.
I was raised to go out and look for 

667
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:25,964
cars.
I was never allowed to walk home the 

668
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,600
same way twice.
Yeah.

669
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,730
Because of the lead the business.
Now,

670
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:32,564
let me ask you about that because w,
is this an instinct you learned on your 

671
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:38,010
own or were you actually.
I was.

672
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,100
When I became a numbers runner,
as a child,

673
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,360
I was always.
My mom would put a.

674
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:47,640
When I was a kid and I came from Cuba,
my mother put up a big gold chain on me.

675
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:48,743
You know why?
Because she did you to take it off my 

676
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,060
sheet.
My mother wanted you to take that chance

677
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,060
so I wouldn't have to fight.

678
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,880
Really?
Yeah,

679
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,713
so I remember one time Mr. softy.
He came and he looked at my goal thing 

680
00:36:01,021 --> 00:36:04,020
and my mother yelled from the window,
don't let them touch your fucking chain.

681
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Yesterday I went to Glendale and my 
daughter was throwing hoops hoop and she

682
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,120
was chasing them all four of them by 
herself.

683
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,983
She's an only child,
so it was other kids there and the red 

684
00:36:18,991 --> 00:36:22,410
hoop fell through the thing and some 60 
year old took it from that.

685
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,210
My daughter went to put her head down.
I go,

686
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,030
Oh yeah,
go take it back.

687
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,740
Go take it back.
And she just looked at me and the parent

688
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:33,480
was like,
that's an effective way of parenting.

689
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,733
She got back from your daughter.
Don't ever stay hitting my fucking 

690
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,070
house.
Wait a minute though.

691
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,310
The mom of the kid that took it was 
giving you shit.

692
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:41,790
Oh yeah.

693
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,610
Because this is today's America,
my America.

694
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,420
We don't come home at what did.
What did the mom wants you to do?

695
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,570
Mom and the dad to Glendale fucking 
gentiles.

696
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,893
The Dad said,
that's an effective way of of whatever 

697
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:56,760
box saying nothing bitch.
Your daughter.

698
00:36:56,761 --> 00:36:57,594
A couple of weeks ago,
a little girl took the swing from my 

699
00:36:58,861 --> 00:37:01,610
daughter.
Take the swing back.

700
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:04,740
My wife's like,
what are you doing?

701
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,380
That's how Cubans raised their kids.
I was raised to always have my eyes open

702
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:10,223
because I knew what they did.
I was at a young age if I hung out with 

703
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:16,320
Joe Rogan,
Joe Rogan's dad,

704
00:37:16,321 --> 00:37:18,630
so coke.
I knew Joe Rogan's Dad.

705
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:20,670
So Coke Jolen.
What?

706
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:24,360
I would never tell you.
I came from a house where it was.

707
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,210
Yeah,

708
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,680
right.
But you know,

709
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:27,800
here's the thing.
If a.

710
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,710
If they wanted to get at your mother,
they had come after the kid.

711
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,630
Yeah,
they come in.

712
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,890
It was very common.
Again,

713
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,640
kidnapped the kid.
That's how you.

714
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,930
That's how you got to somebody.
Well,

715
00:37:38,931 --> 00:37:40,000
that's how you get to everybody

716
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,210
mean this is a.
This trump thing was stormy daniels.

717
00:37:43,211 --> 00:37:44,650
Do you see?
One of the things that she said that one

718
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:46,210
of the reasons why she came a lot about 
this.

719
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,343
Somebody came up to her in a parking lot
when she was holding her infant 

720
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,250
daughter.
I don't know if this is true.

721
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,860
This is what she says.
Someone came up to her and said,

722
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,783
you have a beautiful daughter.
It'd be a shame if anything happened to 

723
00:37:56,951 --> 00:37:57,784
her mother.
Now stop talking about president trump 

724
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,340
wasn't president trump at the time.
Stop talking about Mr Trump,

725
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,230
and she was like,
oh,

726
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,420
fuck you.
Or fuck this,

727
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:09,070
and then you know.
Then she really,

728
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,350
really geared up or animosity towards 
them.

729
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,723
Imagine that Shit.

730
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,680
Hey,
in the narco world,

731
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:19,060
there's cases of what they would do is 
they will do a video tape.

732
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,980
There was somebody they wanted to 
intimidate.

733
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,180
They'd videotape their kid being taken 
to school every morning,

734
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,780
being dropped off for school,
picked up after school.

735
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,793
They videotape the daily routine of the 
child and then they'd send the video 

736
00:38:33,091 --> 00:38:35,980
tape to that person and I,
I need to

737
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,890
know where your kid is every,
every minute of the day.

738
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:43,960
Do what we tell you to do.
He doesn't fuck with me though.

739
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:49,080
I was never fucked with.
I was never really a and a no,

740
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,800
no.
I was never fucked with.

741
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:53,550
I was just raised to understand what 
they were doing it.

742
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:57,430
There's consequences and I was allowed 
to repeat it.

743
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,090
So when I would come to you and you will
be talking about whatever.

744
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,940
Even if I knew you were wrong,
I would never correct you.

745
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,150
So that's how I was raised.
I would never correct you.

746
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,520
He would if I knew you were talking shit
because how do you know?

747
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,473
How do I know?
I was just at the fucking bar and they 

748
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:12,874
were talking about I tried to fuck.
I know my mom didn't hide nothing from 

749
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:16,624
me growing up.
That's good and bad that it had good 

750
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:22,180
things for me,
but a lot of bad things to me,

751
00:39:22,181 --> 00:39:23,014
you know,
one of the things that he touched upon 

752
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:28,360
this book was not only about Jose 
battle,

753
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:33,050
but the political corruption that came 
with it in 20 years.

754
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,790
Have I ever talked to you about bottling
things to ever.

755
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,880
I wouldn't listen to politics if you 
paid me because it's all bullshit.

756
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:45,000
I saw it and I and a micro level,
you know when you,

757
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,200
when you a president who do you get 
donations from?

758
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,510
Big Farm guns,
whatever.

759
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:53,860
When you're a small mayor who they get 
donations from the pharmacy,

760
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,590
the pizza place,
the numbers.

761
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,803
So I came from a society where those 
numbers are controlling everything and 

762
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,580
in North Bergen,
union city and West New York,

763
00:40:06,581 --> 00:40:11,380
and we remember that Shit's a felony in 
Jersey misdemeanor in New York.

764
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,150
Really?
Numbers.

765
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,940
It used to be misdemeanor.
As a matter of fact,

766
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,440
they would call you never go Joe 
Lieutenant.

767
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,210
We wouldn't say that because the phones 
would take.

768
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,800
He would just call you and go,
you're getting a visit today.

769
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,200
That means if you've got $5,000 in your 
pocket and give it to Jamie,

770
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:33,040
cleaned out the house,
leave some paperwork at 2:00,

771
00:40:33,041 --> 00:40:34,570
I come,
I handcuff you,

772
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,853
I take your money,
I write your summons and bring it down 

773
00:40:38,891 --> 00:40:39,580
to the station.

774
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,680
We get go.
And then after I let you,

775
00:40:41,681 --> 00:40:44,370
how did I meet you around the corner?
You had $2,500.

776
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,860
I'll give you 1250 [inaudible] and 
that's a cost of doing business.

777
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,553
You know,
there's a funny line in Goodfellas when 

778
00:40:50,651 --> 00:40:51,484
he goes,
how can I go to school with all that 

779
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,240
goody,
goody bullshit and salute the flag.

780
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:56,820
When I left,
I was the same one.

781
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,570
Like I saw what happened.
I saw the political system.

782
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:02,404
I saw two cops coming in,
one detective once a week and one big 

783
00:41:06,801 --> 00:41:07,634
guy.
My mom would give him a drink and an 

784
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:09,780
envelope.
Yeah.

785
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:13,030
I don't know what my grandmother did,
what she was involved,

786
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,670
but I told her she went to jail,
the jail for running the numbers.

787
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,160
She went to jail because she wouldn't 
give anybody up.

788
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,000
They wanted her to give up.
Whoever the fuck was at the other end of

789
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:22,834
the organization,
and so for like six months we were 

790
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:26,374
always trying to like,
where the fuck is grandma still all 

791
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,020
she's visiting her sister who was 
always.

792
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,420
She's visiting Aunt Josie and just 
knowing for bookmaking

793
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,560
and Jersey six,
five months,

794
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,483
right.
Then they put you on house arrest and 

795
00:41:38,571 --> 00:41:41,110
you had done.
She would knit sweaters and shit for the

796
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:44,810
fucking guards in jail.
Well,

797
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:47,000
a lot of times battle would own the 
judges.

798
00:41:47,001 --> 00:41:49,140
So you wouldn't do any time,
you might get it,

799
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,993
you might get a summons,
you go before a magistrate judge and 

800
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,330
they let you go.
What's fascinating to me is about,

801
00:41:56,331 --> 00:42:00,980
this is all so fascinating about the job
itself was that a lot of it is basically

802
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:05,090
dissolved that all this came from 
immigration and that this,

803
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:05,924
uh,
this melting pot of the United States 

804
00:42:08,031 --> 00:42:12,290
and they all came from all these other 
places and all this organized crime sort

805
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:16,010
of like was running the,
the cities in the east coast.

806
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:19,370
But most of it is kind of gone the 
wayside.

807
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,350
I would dispute that a little bit.
I think traditional organized crime,

808
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:27,500
as we knew it in the 20th centuries,
gone by the wayside,

809
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,730
Italian,
Irish,

810
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:32,390
Jewish,
that sort of assimilated into the system

811
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:36,410
and has dissipated,
but there's new generations,

812
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:40,430
immigrants that are playing this out,
Jamaicans to make Americans,

813
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:41,720
Chinese,
Russians,

814
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,680
Mexicans.

815
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,640
It's happening.
And I further make the argument that the

816
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:50,960
corruption that was created during 
prohibition in the 19 twenties,

817
00:42:50,961 --> 00:42:54,950
that's where the system was created 
during prohibition in the 19 twenties,

818
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,090
the,
uh,

819
00:42:56,090 --> 00:42:58,700
alliance between the underworld and the 
upper world,

820
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,730
the connection between the political 
apparatus,

821
00:43:01,731 --> 00:43:04,520
law enforcement and the criminal 
rackets.

822
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:09,350
That template was laid down during 
prohibition and it was an effect for the

823
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:13,040
next 100 years.
I think that templates still exists.

824
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:18,170
You pick up a newspaper in any US city,
large or mid sized city.

825
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,570
And what are you going to see on the 
first couple of pages,

826
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,553
some local representative who just got 
indicted for taking money from some 

827
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:26,263
criminal element to see that they got a 
law passed or that they got some 

828
00:43:30,051 --> 00:43:32,410
municipal contract.
Uh,

829
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,630
that hasn't gone away.
That still exists everywhere.

830
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:40,010
What happens is there's an ebb and flow.
Certain rackets come and go,

831
00:43:40,011 --> 00:43:42,890
it was illegal booze and it was labor 
racketeering.

832
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,430
Now it's narcotics.
It was Belita at one time.

833
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,530
There's always something,
you know,

834
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:51,650
as long as there's commerce being done 
on a large scale,

835
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,513
there's always room for corruption as 
long as there's things that are illegal 

836
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:58,770
with this market for like marijuana 
argument.

837
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,541
Yeah,
right.

838
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:00,374
The big argument about marijuana laws,
the United States is if they made it 

839
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,140
legal,
it would severely limit the power to the

840
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:08,850
cartel in Mexico has cut all that 
violence out.

841
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,750
Basically the same shit that was going 
on with Al Capone and,

842
00:44:11,751 --> 00:44:16,360
and everything during the liquor there.
Time with liquids.

843
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:17,703
Yeah.
Because the criminal rackets feed the 

844
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,904
system.
Human beings are flawed human beings at 

845
00:44:22,731 --> 00:44:24,980
every level of the system.
Dirty cops,

846
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,050
cops on the take.
I mean,

847
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:29,660
is it more difficult now for them to 
pull something like this off?

848
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,890
It's less systemic,
you know what I mean?

849
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:33,180
I mean,
back in the day,

850
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,920
you know,
uh,

851
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,970
you'd have corruption that was all the 
way through the chain of command,

852
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,190
you know,
and everyone was sort of in on it.

853
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,720
Now you see the seven five.
Yes,

854
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,554
I did.
I also saw your interview with Michael 

855
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:47,610
Dell.
Fascinating.

856
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,930
Yeah,
that was fascinating.

857
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:50,910
Um,
yeah,

858
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:51,863
I mean he,
he,

859
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,793
he,
and that was 20 years after the nap nap 

860
00:44:54,811 --> 00:44:58,080
commission which revealed that level of 
corruption.

861
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,750
Um,
yeah,

862
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,890
no,
see there's,

863
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:04,590
you have social systems and you will 
have corruption.

864
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,980
You have a money making system like 
capitalism,

865
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,830
you will have corruption that doesn't go
away.

866
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,030
Organized crime has the face of 
organized crime has changed quite a bit,

867
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:19,380
but the core of,
of that corrupt relationship between the

868
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:21,540
underworld and the upper world still 
exists.

869
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,900
So is it the most disenfranchised sort 
of members of the community,

870
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,810
the most recent immigrants?
Like what,

871
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:30,530
what is it that.

872
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,510
Yeah,
I've written about this a lot,

873
00:45:32,511 --> 00:45:33,344
you know,
two different books and through 

874
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:38,210
journalism I've come to believe that 
it's the American story.

875
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:40,483
This process of going through organized 
crime and gangsterism before you become 

876
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:48,390
accepted as a full blown American.
Um,

877
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,393
every,
almost every ethnic group has gone 

878
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:55,100
through some version of it in the US and
it's still an is still going through it.

879
00:45:55,101 --> 00:45:58,940
It's part of the American process.
You get here as a group,

880
00:45:59,150 --> 00:45:59,983
your your cutout of access,
a immediate access anyway to to power 

881
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:07,603
and so you create your own path and 
initially in these organizations it's 

882
00:46:12,471 --> 00:46:14,750
usually those ethnic groups praying on 
their own,

883
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:16,273
preying on each other.
That's usually the first stage of this 

884
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:19,843
and then it becomes a creating a system 
to try to deal with larger system of 

885
00:46:25,251 --> 00:46:27,110
corruption.
I mean Jose Miguel battle.

886
00:46:27,111 --> 00:46:31,970
What he did was so brilliant by creating
the corporation is he created a path for

887
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:32,804
himself within American organized crime 
which was controlled primarily by the 

888
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:37,874
mafia and he created an alliance with 
the mafia that made it possible for the 

889
00:46:42,051 --> 00:46:45,710
Cubans to have their thing and and fly 
below the radar.

890
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:49,280
I mean while he Italians were getting 
busted left and right.

891
00:46:49,281 --> 00:46:50,840
The Cubans,
the Cubans.

892
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:51,674
This corporation existed for 40 years 
because they didn't really get messed 

893
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:54,890
with with

894
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:57,060
much.
Why is that like what was it the.

895
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:59,960
The way the Italians there were so 
flashy,

896
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:02,810
like particularly when you got the God 
he was the most ridiculous,

897
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,650
were pretty damn flashy too.
Some of them.

898
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,500
Some of this,
some of them I,

899
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:14,501
I till this day I detest nice cars.
I had the test show calling attention to

900
00:47:16,971 --> 00:47:20,000
yourself because I saw too tight,
like right now,

901
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,893
like I would love to talk to the 
producers of this film because they're 

902
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:26,860
going to miss a lot of authentic stuff.
I'm sure that we'll have.

903
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,240
In fact,
I have a present for you.

904
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:31,270
I ordered you the same shirt,
Bruce Lee,

905
00:47:31,271 --> 00:47:33,880
war and fist of fury.
They called.

906
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,820
Cami said,
that's Chine US Cubans.

907
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:37,654
When you,
when you were a success memo and Tony 

908
00:47:40,451 --> 00:47:42,890
goes into see his mother Mama success.
I,

909
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,050
I read that like gastro.
When you become a success in union city,

910
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:48,593
the Chinese tee is your first sign of 
success because it has three buttons 

911
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:53,980
here,
right?

912
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:57,610
So you cut the buttons off and young.
What's your middle name?

913
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:58,923
James.
So it's Joseph James Rogan in diamond 

914
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,973
initials.
You putj j dot and that's when you've 

915
00:48:05,981 --> 00:48:09,490
reached success and they need that.
They,

916
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:10,001
they,
they,

917
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:12,070
that's part of their,
you know,

918
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,890
like there's so many little things that 
Cubans did,

919
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,480
but taken down like one for example,
my stepfather.

920
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:22,270
Brilliant,
brilliant.

921
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,910
You know Paulie didn't talk on the 
phone.

922
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:27,570
Well move for anybody.
Paul,

923
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:31,710
he had his message is delivered.
Then in 1970,

924
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:32,563
I'm looking at both of you gentlemen and
I'm telling you that one would not even 

925
00:48:35,591 --> 00:48:36,424
have a conversation if there was a phone
in the room and it was hung up because 

926
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:43,290
in his mind that phone was fucking 
tapped,

927
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,790
right?
He was a genius.

928
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,810
If he had a meet Joe Rogan for a meeting
at nine at 5:30 in the morning,

929
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:51,123
he'd come and put a gun under a car just
in case there was a problem with Joe 

930
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,030
Rogan.

931
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,810
He will hug you and you searched him.
He would hug you and tap your back for a

932
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:03,650
wire and tell you you will lose some 
weight and rub your belly at all.

933
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:08,230
Then they hug you,
but that feeling you for a pink one.

934
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,123
When my mother died,
he still had the same car that he had 

935
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:16,501
when he died with $5 million cash and he
lived in a four story walk up.

936
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,390
When he died,
one of his friends said,

937
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,780
what a miserable life to make money and 
have to hide it like that one would walk

938
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:29,740
around with jeans and t shirts the same 
shit every day.

939
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:34,060
And a wad of hundreds like this.
The hidden one.

940
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:37,060
The other one was single.
So you thought he was broke.

941
00:49:37,630 --> 00:49:39,730
If he talked to you,
he talked to you in English.

942
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,090
Once the cops came.
Me.

943
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:42,860
No biggie.
You know,

944
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,193
who was the interpreter for all the 
attorney meetings where all those high 

945
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,014
level guys.

946
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:49,960
Me Really?
So I'd be at school,

947
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:50,794
I'd be at home when my mom would go 
tomorrow you have to go with child to 

948
00:49:53,951 --> 00:49:55,210
the Lucas Office.
Sam,

949
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:58,360
they'll Luca and Sam.
The local will look at you and go,

950
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,610
I don't Joe,
great to see you today.

951
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:05,680
You'd have to bring him a suit.
He loves suit Sam de Luca.

952
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,200
So the more suits you brought them,
the better.

953
00:50:08,201 --> 00:50:10,540
He was like the other guy,
the guy that had the thing,

954
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,230
but Sam would treat you just like this 
Joe Rogan.

955
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:15,850
We ain't okay.
You're going to interpret.

956
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,833
This was how fast the conversation was.
You got busted for conspiracy of 

957
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:22,223
bookmaking.
That's two years listening to this 

958
00:50:24,371 --> 00:50:25,900
judge.
She's a motherfucker,

959
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,980
but thank God I know the

960
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,310
prosecutor.
So Day one I'm going to do for $300,000.

961
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,760
We lose the episodes for 200,000 a year 
for 100,000.

962
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:44,900
You get probation and you do a year and 
a half way house for 50,000.

963
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:48,580
He just gives you a menu when you decide
what you want to do,

964
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,650
get back to me.
Always a pleasure to see you and you had

965
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:54,470
a week to decide what you were going to 
do.

966
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,960
Wow.
So you gave him that amount.

967
00:50:56,961 --> 00:51:00,140
He knew his way through the court 
system.

968
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:02,480
You didn't do no time.
There's no time.

969
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,090
I know for a fact that if you get caught
with a gun to New York,

970
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,380
you get.
What's the law?

971
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:07,890
He.
Yeah,

972
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:12,040
there was some mandatory mandatory.
There's no goal.

973
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:15,190
There's no trial and take you right to 
my stepfather.

974
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,140
Wong got caught with a gun.
He was under the next day.

975
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:20,510
The Lucas don't play game Deluca.

976
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,993
Don't play games now.
Now and answer Joe and answer to your 

977
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:25,334
question about the Cubans and why they 
existed for so long and didn't get 

978
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:29,600
busted,
you know,

979
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:34,610
the rumor was that they had a certain 
mystique because of this CIA,

980
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:40,190
a pedigree and that they were 
untouchable and in factor.

981
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,880
I mentioned it in the book,
there's a case where the FBI is thinking

982
00:51:43,881 --> 00:51:47,480
about making a case against battle.
This is way back in the sixties.

983
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,793
They contact the US Treasury Department 
because they figure he's not paying 

984
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:55,820
taxes and they can make some kind of 
case against him and a tax violation.

985
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,810
They got a letter from the Treasury 
Department saying,

986
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,063
we're not going to go after this guy 
because he's anti-castro and he's a 

987
00:52:04,161 --> 00:52:07,520
veteran of the Bay of pigs invasion.
It's right there in a,

988
00:52:07,521 --> 00:52:09,980
in a,
in a letter from the Treasury Department

989
00:52:09,981 --> 00:52:11,330
to the FBI.
Wow.

990
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,253
So there were elements within the 
government that we're protecting these 

991
00:52:15,261 --> 00:52:17,270
guys,
particularly bay of Pigs veterans.

992
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:19,610
We will not prosecute them.
That's incredible.

993
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,830
And so he had that kind of protection 
with a name too,

994
00:52:22,831 --> 00:52:25,220
Huh?
Jose battle bottling.

995
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,660
Yeah.
His name is Spanish.

996
00:52:26,661 --> 00:52:29,150
Was bothy a bat l,
l e,

997
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,010
and he changed it to balance a good one,
right?

998
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,873
If you're,
if you're a writer and a novelist and 

999
00:52:33,501 --> 00:52:34,334
you're trying to think of a good name 
for the character that she can't do any 

1000
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:37,424
better than.
I grew up with a kid named major battle 

1001
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:42,200
God to taekwondo.
His name was major battle.

1002
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:43,543
That motherfucker too bad.
Motherfucker named major battle was his 

1003
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:48,640
middle name.
Bad mother fucker.

1004
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,580
Major bad mother.
But it was.

1005
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,700
It was a black belt state champion and 
the only reason why they existed,

1006
00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,980
they were very careful.
They have a systemized union city,

1007
00:53:00,981 --> 00:53:01,814
Ran Union city becomes Jersey City and 
hoboken you didn't see ran seventh 

1008
00:53:06,921 --> 00:53:07,754
street to 88th street to white castle,
but the Cubans really controlled seven 

1009
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:15,280
to 48th street Bergen line.

1010
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,510
And then when you went to New York 
Avenue,

1011
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:19,663
they control from $50 up to about 60th 
street and they kept to themselves and 

1012
00:53:25,111 --> 00:53:29,370
they didn't have social clubs and it 
didn't play cards outside.

1013
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,340
And if you want them to the bar,
they wore dress very,

1014
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:34,700
moderately before.
From what?

1015
00:53:34,701 --> 00:53:35,534
Bookies.
And they only stayed there till 3:00 

1016
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:38,873
because that's when the number goes in,
so you have from nine in the morning to 

1017
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:43,374
three to play that number.
But there's also a thing called a 

1018
00:53:46,381 --> 00:53:49,500
singular number,
which the odds are a little less.

1019
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,040
That started about 12.
So I'll see you at 12 and go for it.

1020
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:57,330
Normal it.
Make a mother fucker.

1021
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:00,150
I'll never listened to that fucking kid 
of mine again.

1022
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,790
Now I got to go back to the booking and 
bet the second number,

1023
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,910
call that.
That's one number at a time.

1024
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,940
So I have an optimization putting down 
$100,000 on,

1025
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,270
on what the number five is.

1026
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:13,223
What is the number of year,
the potential numbers talking single 

1027
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:18,270
digits on.
I can play three digit.

1028
00:54:18,271 --> 00:54:19,081
Read that.
You Bet.

1029
00:54:19,081 --> 00:54:21,330
Three digit.
So why would it be a single number?

1030
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:23,590
Well,
that was just a different one.

1031
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,980
A different one.
Different systems,

1032
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,690
different systems.
Certain ways you can do it.

1033
00:54:27,691 --> 00:54:29,850
But let's explain this where the number 
comes from.

1034
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,773
Okay.
The total mutual handle at the race 

1035
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:38,160
track is published in the newspaper 
every evening and again and again in the

1036
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:41,090
morning.
How much money was bet total at the race

1037
00:54:41,091 --> 00:54:43,800
track that day?
The last three numbers.

1038
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:48,540
That's the daily number.
So everyone you know has the same number

1039
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:49,374
for everybody.
You know what it is as soon as it comes 

1040
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,850
out in the newspaper and that's how it's
determined.

1041
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:58,200
So you have,
you have the individual numbers and then

1042
00:54:58,201 --> 00:55:01,650
you have the early number with which is 
called welcome come out of Brooklyn,

1043
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:06,240
guest Saleo in Brooklyn and then you 
will have the late number.

1044
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,073
What's The New York number?
That's number in the New York number 

1045
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,463
side.
Like what it would be based on that was 

1046
00:55:12,901 --> 00:55:16,650
decided probably a hundred years ago by 
some by some,

1047
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:21,180
you know a Guinea who ran,
who ran it for the Italians and maybe it

1048
00:55:21,181 --> 00:55:22,410
came from Sicily.
Whatever.

1049
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:24,960
The origins of it.
You couldn't have fixed that though.

1050
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:28,680
It's like it's gambling so it can't fix 
it.

1051
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,090
Why isn't it?
Because it's the.

1052
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,610
I don't know what the track is going to 
make that.

1053
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:33,583
Fix that.
How would you say you fixed the last 

1054
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:36,900
three numbers?
Checked this out.

1055
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:39,780
Certain organizations like the 
corporation,

1056
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:40,693
part of the reason people wanted to bet 
with them and like to bet with them is 

1057
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,320
they would have somebody at the race 
track,

1058
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,580
so the minute that number was posted,
they'd know the number.

1059
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,593
So you'd get your,
you didn't have to wait around for a 

1060
00:55:52,901 --> 00:55:56,450
newspaper or for sports,
you had to call sports.

1061
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,830
Uh,
nobody remembers that.

1062
00:55:58,831 --> 00:56:00,660
You remember that Tj,
how are you doing?

1063
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:02,360
Welcome.
This is Joe Rogan.

1064
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:03,203
You just called sports live.
You've got to sit by a payphone and put 

1065
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:08,170
thirty five cents and they would run all
right that,

1066
00:56:08,171 --> 00:56:11,730
that child and after the scores and they
give you the score,

1067
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:12,810
but whatever.
You Bet.

1068
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:14,660
What's the last fucking thing?
Oh,

1069
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:16,620
so you had to sit there and take that 
whole.

1070
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:19,770
We have beat mother fucker.
Give it to me.

1071
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,830
And then when it came to them saying the
number,

1072
00:56:22,831 --> 00:56:24,030
the subway go by and

1073
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,830
you're just lost another thirty five 
cents.

1074
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,013
But the whole number system,
like my mother was a degenerate numbers 

1075
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:34,173
and then she will kill the,
with the Yankees and the red sox later 

1076
00:56:36,281 --> 00:56:39,370
on.
But her game was the numbers,

1077
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:43,060
the three numbers didn't do your track 
and now let's get greedy.

1078
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,390
Why don't we go to Otb?
Yeah.

1079
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:46,293
Now see this is where.
Why don't we just go to old beat a 

1080
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:52,360
really complete your fucking day?
You degenerate the brilliance of battle.

1081
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:53,253
And his organization was,
he didn't do sports betting and in fact 

1082
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:00,280
his arrangement with the Italians,
with the mafia was you get Belita,

1083
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,190
you get numbers,
but you don't get sports betting and you

1084
00:57:03,191 --> 00:57:06,100
don't get these other things.
And so there was a.

1085
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:08,500
there's an.
There's an example in this book of a,

1086
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,790
of a member of the corporation who 
starts against battles.

1087
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:15,550
Wishes starts playing,
doing sports,

1088
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:17,590
betting at that guy wound up dead.

1089
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:18,903
A battle killed himself because he was 
going against the agreement going 

1090
00:57:21,551 --> 00:57:22,384
against the rule,
going against the rules that could turn 

1091
00:57:23,741 --> 00:57:25,660
them off against them and bring the 
whole thing down.

1092
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:26,494
Right,
right.

1093
00:57:27,790 --> 00:57:29,050
Wow,
that's amazing.

1094
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:32,680
Now and answer your question about how,
how they came up with that number.

1095
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:34,870
You got to remember,
it's all gambling.

1096
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,180
This is the culture of gambling.
You know,

1097
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:38,260
you're at the race,
track,

1098
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:41,860
your bedding card games,
you're bedding petting the number,

1099
00:57:42,010 --> 00:57:42,843
so it's logical that somewhere in that 
universe would be how the number was 

1100
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,233
determined.
So it came from the race track and then 

1101
00:57:49,571 --> 00:57:54,140
you also have the Puerto Rican lottery 
and that comes and paperwork.

1102
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,140
It's different.
That's completely different.

1103
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:57,520
Paperwork,
paperwork,

1104
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:58,923
paperwork that comes a lottery tickets.
My mother would buy the whole fucking 

1105
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:04,570
sheet.
It's like $10 a thing,

1106
00:58:04,571 --> 00:58:07,060
but you could just buy the sheet.
And what is it?

1107
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,013
It's a Puerto Rican.
Them now you know that the corporation 

1108
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,940
use the Puerto Rican lottery to launder 
their profits.

1109
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,900
Yeah.
So you hit the number.

1110
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,183
You're my friend.
What are you gonna win 20,000 by the 

1111
00:58:20,891 --> 00:58:24,100
time they give it to you.
Let me just give you 18.

1112
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,380
Do you know that's how Whitey bulger 
laundered money,

1113
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:27,243
right?
That's how Sammy the bull one lottery 

1114
00:58:28,541 --> 00:58:32,020
tickets to Whitey bulger won the lottery
twice.

1115
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:32,950
Twice.
People.

1116
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:36,540
The neighborhood won the lottery and he 
bought the ticket from them,

1117
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,650
gave him money or whatever the fuck he 
gave him.

1118
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,720
Check this one out.
Today's paper.

1119
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:45,890
A front page of USA Today,
confessions of a lottery scammer.

1120
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:48,580
I brought this along.
I taught if he interest lottery scam.

1121
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:50,380
This is a guy,
big fat guy,

1122
00:58:50,381 --> 00:58:51,214
trainer pounds sitting on his ass in 
Iowa or somewhere who was on his device 

1123
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:56,943
who figured out some way to intrude on 
some algorithm and he started scamming 

1124
00:59:01,451 --> 00:59:02,284
different states.
He scammed the state of Colorado out of 

1125
00:59:04,121 --> 00:59:07,510
four point $8 million dollars.
And uh,

1126
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,690
there is uh,
a total of 16 point five.

1127
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:11,920
Boy,
you guys are good.

1128
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:13,053
A 16 point $5 million.
I'm now I'm thinking if this guy had 

1129
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:22,070
scammed the corporation led by Jose 
Miguel battle,

1130
00:59:22,070 --> 00:59:22,561
he,
he,

1131
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:23,720
he'd be,
he'd be dead.

1132
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:28,520
He wouldn't be on the be beyond the 
obituary section.

1133
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:32,390
Look what it says here was never my 
intent to start a full out ticket scam.

1134
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:34,610
Yeah,
yeah.

1135
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,660
His sentence up to 25 years old years 
old.

1136
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:39,260
Not Scam,
organized crime in this way.

1137
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:42,950
How do you skim lottery?
Like you figure out,

1138
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:43,933
you figure out how the number is 
determined and then you're able to play 

1139
00:59:46,761 --> 00:59:49,040
with it.
You're able to play with it.

1140
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:49,940
See,
in organized crime,

1141
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:52,400
you couldn't do understand that.
How could he like,

1142
00:59:52,401 --> 00:59:55,610
isn't there just a random system,
a computer program or something?

1143
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:57,590
Yeah.
He found some way to,

1144
00:59:57,930 --> 00:59:58,763
to,
uh,

1145
00:59:58,940 --> 00:59:59,773
to tap into that computer system to tap 
onto me to hack into a hack into it and 

1146
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,950
can alter the number.
Oh,

1147
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:08,300
wow.
That's crazy.

1148
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,350
Wow.
That is crazy.

1149
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:14,300
What is fascinating to me is this,
what you were talking about earlier when

1150
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,280
we're talking about,
about like that this was,

1151
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:20,090
it gave them an opportunity for hope and
that it was a part of the community.

1152
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:22,940
We're missing that in the west coast,
the west coast,

1153
01:00:23,090 --> 01:00:24,200
like offtrack,
betting.

1154
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,063
There's no fucking here.
There's a few Weirdos that go to the 

1155
01:00:27,321 --> 01:00:29,270
Hollywood park,
but that's gone now.

1156
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,760
You know what I mean?
There's nothing in the west coast.

1157
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,290
Never had this,
does nothing.

1158
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,710
Yeah.
There's nothing like seeing that.

1159
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:37,573
Like,
I saw that and I saw what goes with it 

1160
01:00:39,471 --> 01:00:42,890
and it may sound he spoke it in most 
people,

1161
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,740
but it's not who you spoke to.
The people who are really,

1162
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:49,280
really Sicilian people who are normal 
Cuban.

1163
01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,110
When you're a Sicilian in that culture,
there's women that you go to them,

1164
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,430
they tell you things that witches,
the Sicilian witches,

1165
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:00,200
whatever the fuck you want to and 
sleepers remember,

1166
01:01:00,201 --> 01:01:01,800
he goes,
bring the eyeballs.

1167
01:01:01,801 --> 01:01:02,634
So this lady,
what sleeper sleepers is a movie about 

1168
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:09,960
for Irish kids that lay there was 
bullshit because of a woman.

1169
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,590
You remember that movie?
It's about the four kids narrow place.

1170
01:01:12,591 --> 01:01:13,730
A priest,
priest,

1171
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:18,731
but a Brad Pitt grandson.
Okay.

1172
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,900
There it is.
Barry Levinson movies.

1173
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,500
Then they got the guy on the leather 
men.

1174
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:27,960
Then he started backtracking like Steven
Seagal by the CIA involvement.

1175
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,430
Lorenzo Carter.
He later on became.

1176
01:01:32,450 --> 01:01:34,670
It was a true story and it was not a 
story.

1177
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,810
It was based.
But uh,

1178
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:38,953
if you look at it one,
two for those two kids were supposed to 

1179
01:01:42,171 --> 01:01:43,450
grow up to be west.
Yeah.

1180
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,320
But it wasn't bullshit.
It's bullshit.

1181
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:46,940
Like they,
the two other,

1182
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:48,760
the four of those guys.
What are we talking about?

1183
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,850
Talking about?
Well,

1184
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,930
you were talking dollar witches.
He,

1185
01:01:53,931 --> 01:01:56,000
you know,
in the Cuban world,

1186
01:01:56,001 --> 01:01:59,830
it's the same thing.
I want my kid to go to Catholic school,

1187
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,810
right?
If I play this fucking number today,

1188
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:04,610
this is gonna.
Save me.

1189
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:05,361
We,
you know,

1190
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:06,194
we don't.
When you're a comic you have that hope 

1191
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,630
tonight I'm going to go to the Improv.
Just Sasha was going to be that.

1192
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,740
Maybe you know,
just made it.

1193
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:14,613
It's a,
but it's an ethnic hope that comes back 

1194
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:20,460
from your country.
It's hard to describe.

1195
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:24,000
You understand that because your 
grandmother was a fucking booky.

1196
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,163
But if you talked to her on a daily 
basis about it and why she would play 

1197
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:31,860
that particular number.
Like my mom played five slash 17.

1198
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:35,790
Those are the last three numbers on my 
dad's gravestone,

1199
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:37,643
you know,
604 with some other fucking 

1200
01:02:39,181 --> 01:02:40,590
hallucinogenic.
She had.

1201
01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:44,490
If I go like this,
if I go like this and I go,

1202
01:02:44,491 --> 01:02:45,324
you know what,
you're looking good today and they'll 

1203
01:02:47,101 --> 01:02:47,934
take a yard stick.
Most Cuban is look at it and go give me 

1204
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:55,480
$5 on to fifth grade because it's the 
last three numbers of 20.

1205
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,570
You fucking gave me.
Now is this still going on?

1206
01:02:57,630 --> 01:02:59,130
Oh yeah.
The numbers are still going on.

1207
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:00,820
Not In a,
not as a,

1208
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:06,080
not as a 10 minute head office.
When I was a kid it was a 10 man office.

1209
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:08,390
You went downstairs,
you had a bodega,

1210
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,233
me and you ran the Bodega is use and 
yesterday's paper always selling the 

1211
01:03:13,591 --> 01:03:17,670
book of dreams and then you come in and 
you give me six.

1212
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:19,290
Oh,
four slash five slash 17.

1213
01:03:19,291 --> 01:03:23,220
It's comes on three sheets of paper with
with copy paper.

1214
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:27,030
So right away I ripped the top one.
I give it to you.

1215
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:28,343
I keep the other one and the other one 
goes upstairs to the department where 

1216
01:03:30,721 --> 01:03:35,721
now there's a big wall with zero to nine
on the wall and I parked that.

1217
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:37,703
So Joe just came up and played 2:19.
There's two and all of a sudden there's 

1218
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,170
a list that goes down.
I'm a board guy.

1219
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,573
I just worked the board.
I got six guys with phones yelling 

1220
01:03:47,011 --> 01:03:48,180
numbers on me.
Oh Hey.

1221
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:51,450
At rogen fucking just put $100 and that 
number,

1222
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:52,523
that motherfucker killed me last week 
sometime send $50 of that to Miami 

1223
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:59,160
because I got unloaded to create the 
Utopia.

1224
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:01,110
You know when you.
When I take a sports,

1225
01:04:01,111 --> 01:04:04,470
but I'm taking $500 on Pittsburgh,
Pittsburgh's plain New England.

1226
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:08,520
I can't take 10,000 on Pittsburgh and 
$5,000 New England.

1227
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,330
That's not called a utopia.
I'm going to make money on the vig.

1228
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,560
The 10 points from you losing.
So if you bet 10,000 on somebody and you

1229
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,394
bet five.
I unload five a to another bank 

1230
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:23,420
somewhere across town.
So this is how an.

1231
01:04:23,550 --> 01:04:24,383
I mean when I was a kid,
my mother had a bank in the Bronx and 

1232
01:04:27,361 --> 01:04:28,194
the guy that cooked was black Mike.
He was a Vietnam vet and I was five and 

1233
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:33,110
he would give me 10 bucks to go get 
them.

1234
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,730
Blackberry,
brandy black.

1235
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:39,110
Mike cooked Italian food.
That was so fucking good.

1236
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:42,060
It was 1970.
Even if you hate a black we,

1237
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:43,683
you waited his spaghetti.
Even Italians came to eat his spaghetti 

1238
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,270
on Wednesdays.
He could corn beef on Wednesdays.

1239
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:52,104
He made Cuban food.
They have an office and every phone has 

1240
01:04:55,051 --> 01:04:58,110
a little tape recorder with a wire 
connected to the phone.

1241
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,140
So you can't call me and say you played 
two eight.

1242
01:05:00,150 --> 01:05:01,230
Yeah,
it's recorded.

1243
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:02,093
Fucking busted your way to tape for you.
So every hour the tapes come around the 

1244
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,953
same and those get destroyed the week 
after or that night after everything 

1245
01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:13,263
settled,
but the CEO's offices in action when 

1246
01:05:16,381 --> 01:05:18,490
you're a kid and I'm going to get 
cigarettes

1247
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,640
and they'd give me a 10 to go get a 
three donald pack of cigarettes.

1248
01:05:21,641 --> 01:05:24,430
I keep seven now.
Did you ever see the money?

1249
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:26,013
What do you mean?
The moral of the money that was 

1250
01:05:26,651 --> 01:05:27,484
gathered?
I saw how the money would be taken to a 

1251
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,710
separate location.
I will be a separate location room now.

1252
01:05:32,711 --> 01:05:35,020
There's also they move locations every 
week.

1253
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:36,453
You also have to stay ahead of the cops.
So every week you got a guy like Joe 

1254
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:40,713
Rogan that just rents apartments woman.
So every week we moved locations so 

1255
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:47,770
nobody ever gets comfortable with three 
months at one place than what?

1256
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:49,290
Three months in another place.
Then what?

1257
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,133
Three months in the other place,
because not only will you have to worry 

1258
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:51,994
about cops,
you got to worry about Jamie getting a 

1259
01:05:53,531 --> 01:05:54,364
little fucking cocky.
Jamie found out from Joe does that they 

1260
01:05:56,811 --> 01:05:59,710
make $40,000 a day,
Jamie's two guns,

1261
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,123
two guns and try to go up there and see 
what happens because they got two guys 

1262
01:06:02,801 --> 01:06:06,250
on the third floor that just got two 
guns waiting for idiots like you to come

1263
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,390
upstairs to the fourth floor.

1264
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,500
It was surreal.
It was surreal.

1265
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:12,334
So in the morning is my mom would go,
you want to go to school or you want to 

1266
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,380
color match and go,
yeah,

1267
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,473
I go,
I'm going with you because he's bookies 

1268
01:06:21,011 --> 01:06:22,660
will all give me 20,
40 bucks.

1269
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:24,700
It's part of that good.
Now check this out.

1270
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:28,020
At the end of the day,
every day that this is going on there,

1271
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:28,893
because betting is going at every day,
seven days a week and the system that 

1272
01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:34,240
joy's talking about,
so money's coming in,

1273
01:06:34,270 --> 01:06:37,000
a lot of money's coming in.
It goes to the accounting rooms,

1274
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,800
so at the end of the day you got a lot 
of money and like two,

1275
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:43,990
300 different locations all around the 
New York area.

1276
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,213
What they would do is they have people 
whose responsibility it was to come 

1277
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,024
around and collect the money.
That money would go into a van and that 

1278
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:53,914
van would have a police escort as it 
left New York City went through the 

1279
01:06:58,301 --> 01:06:59,134
tunnel and in New Jersey it was met by 
New Jersey police who picked it up and 

1280
01:07:03,641 --> 01:07:04,474
escorted from there into the apartments 
or the houses in union city where the 

1281
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:10,520
money was crazy.

1282
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:12,910
Wow.
So the cops got paid.

1283
01:07:12,911 --> 01:07:15,220
So how can I tell you this?
At the age of 10,

1284
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:17,450
I knew this,
but I could never tell.

1285
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,650
You wouldn't believe me,
so I had to keep it to myself.

1286
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,513
Well,
most of the kids wouldn't be able to 

1287
01:07:21,881 --> 01:07:26,050
shut the fuck up.
I was talking about not the corner I see

1288
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,770
in my world.
I didn't win.

1289
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:30,480
What were your Saturday?
We played handball all day.

1290
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,500
I had to go to a play with my uncle,
the youngest.

1291
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:37,510
You worked for a sports betting place to
later on as I got older,

1292
01:07:37,511 --> 01:07:39,400
but when I got out of high school,
I was such a loser.

1293
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,430
Then I went to 118th street.
The guy's name was Chad,

1294
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:45,100
Jose Torres and the son.
I went through them like a man.

1295
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:46,473
They were around the block to this guy 
named Raleigh and Miguel and they ran a 

1296
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:53,200
complete different operation from the 
cooperation.

1297
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,530
Raleigh still around.
If I had any balls left,

1298
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:57,364
I go put a bullet and Riley's had 
because Raleigh was tight with my 

1299
01:08:00,011 --> 01:08:00,844
mother.
My mother helped get Raleigh started on 

1300
01:08:02,201 --> 01:08:05,110
118th street.
When my mother died,

1301
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:08,680
he got tight with my stepfather.
When my stepfather died,

1302
01:08:08,681 --> 01:08:11,430
he took that money and gave it to my 
stepfather.

1303
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,060
Sister.
That money belonged to me.

1304
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,190
So today I'm still pissed off

1305
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,023
at Raleigh because when I was a kid,
I just want to Raleigh every fucking 

1306
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:21,200
day.
He gave me 50 bucks.

1307
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,800
Every time I went over there,
those guys lived their life.

1308
01:08:23,801 --> 01:08:28,040
I'm a Karma based life,
so whenever they see Joe Rogan come in,

1309
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,840
feel man,
you know how many things I did with your

1310
01:08:29,841 --> 01:08:32,960
father to come in as $100.
Go Get your Dick sucked.

1311
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:37,300
My mother would drive me crazy.
Like how much money did you get to?

1312
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,233
200.
Could give me $100 of that because I 

1313
01:08:39,621 --> 01:08:42,860
used to buy knives and fucking stars to 
throw at people,

1314
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:47,410
but that's there with.
They're very generous Joe Rowe,

1315
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:49,413
you know,
you can't do that when you come over to 

1316
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,640
my house with your daughters.
I can't.

1317
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,840
First thing is they do is put a 50 and 
everybody's here.

1318
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,330
So now the girls know whenever they 
would come over uncle Joey's,

1319
01:08:59,331 --> 01:09:00,164
they get a 50.

1320
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:01,753
So even after you're not around,
they'll come over when they're 14 and 

1321
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:07,490
they going to go to Hollywood.
They'll come over by uncle joe,

1322
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:09,140
Uncle Joey.
When you girls,

1323
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,243
you girls got money is 50.
So I had people giving me money because 

1324
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:15,590
it's a car.
I'm a base business.

1325
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,203
The more I,
my mother would hit the number for 

1326
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,510
$10,000 to give away.
Really?

1327
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:21,823
Yeah.
Because that's the generosity part of 

1328
01:09:23,751 --> 01:09:25,760
it.
It's part of the community.

1329
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:27,500
It's part of the.
That's the thing.

1330
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:28,334
You were talking about the communal 
communal and I think that was even more 

1331
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:32,414
pronounced with the Cubans because of 
the history of Bollito and the cultural 

1332
01:09:35,691 --> 01:09:38,270
significance of belief going back to 
Cuba.

1333
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:42,920
That's something they brought with them 
to the United States and that was just,

1334
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,050
you know,
like I said,

1335
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:47,570
it wasn't seen as a,
as a criminal thing.

1336
01:09:47,571 --> 01:09:49,730
It wasn't seen as a violent criminal 
thing.

1337
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:54,500
Now what happens with Jose Miguel battle
is at a certain point in 1985,

1338
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,543
he moves from union city to Miami and he
moves the hierarchy of the organization 

1339
01:10:00,111 --> 01:10:03,350
to Miami,
but the money is still being made in New

1340
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,700
York City.
The organization is as strong as ever in

1341
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,534
the money's being made in the five 
boroughs of New York and it's being 

1342
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:12,200
shipped down to Miami where this guy now
lives like a,

1343
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,640
a gentleman farmer on an estate.
He surrounds himself with mamay trees,

1344
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:21,590
a mamay.
Is it fruit from Cuba that he associates

1345
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:22,630
that?
The Shaker here?

1346
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,583
He goes,
sure.

1347
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,700
Oh yeah.
They did wonderful fruit.

1348
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:27,050
Beautiful.
The great military.

1349
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,943
So he associated with his childhood.
So the first thing he does is he 

1350
01:10:30,321 --> 01:10:31,154
surrounds his estate down in Miami with 
this fruit from his childhood and he 

1351
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:39,200
lives down there now far removed from 
New York.

1352
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,730
Meanwhile,
back in New York,

1353
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:42,193
a war breaks out between the Italians 
and the Cubans over this thing called 

1354
01:10:44,631 --> 01:10:45,710
the two block rule.

1355
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:48,380
When the Cubans and the Italians form 
their alliance,

1356
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,750
they established a rule that you 
couldn't,

1357
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:51,853
nobody could open up a believer to spot 
closer than two blocks to a preexisting 

1358
01:10:55,401 --> 01:10:58,370
bullied to spot somebody violated that 
rule.

1359
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:00,350
I don't even know,
after investigating and who,

1360
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:04,100
who violated that rule.
But that rule got violated and it turned

1361
01:11:04,101 --> 01:11:06,110
into a nasty,
a war.

1362
01:11:06,111 --> 01:11:06,944
And arson war,
they started firebombing each other 

1363
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:11,930
spots and a lot of innocent people got 
killed.

1364
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:14,580
Man incinerated,
a four year old girl got killed.

1365
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,920
Uh,
it became horrific.

1366
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:17,813
Lasted for about eight or nine months.
There was something like 70 murders may 

1367
01:11:21,121 --> 01:11:26,121
be 25 fire bombings at different spots.
It got so ugly,

1368
01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:27,413
it brought down the heat of the feds.
Nobody could ignore this corporation 

1369
01:11:31,411 --> 01:11:32,244
thing anymore.
So it brought a lot of unwanted 

1370
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:37,530
attention to.
They know who initially started it off.

1371
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,460
Who violated.

1372
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:39,000
Yeah,
yeah.

1373
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,470
He became a snitch and told the whole 
story.

1374
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:43,850
The guy who violated it.
Oh nothing.

1375
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:44,693
I violated it.
But the guy who became the number one 

1376
01:11:46,561 --> 01:11:50,250
arsonist set up the whole campaign of 
arson.

1377
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:52,970
He became a snitch and told the whole 
thing,

1378
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:53,813
chapter and verse.
So it's basically just one cocky person 

1379
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,950
just decided,
fuck this to blow.

1380
01:11:57,990 --> 01:12:02,640
He was probably authorized by his bosses
to do it.

1381
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,230
Yeah.
Go over and burn that spot.

1382
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:05,064
We'll show them.
And then that happened and then the 

1383
01:12:06,871 --> 01:12:08,880
response was,
well,

1384
01:12:09,030 --> 01:12:10,980
we'll show them.
Go burn his spot.

1385
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,400
But burning the spot came out of someone
violating the original deal.

1386
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:15,890
Yeah,
two blocks away.

1387
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:18,210
That was the reason.
The first burning half.

1388
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:21,240
Do they know who the guy was?
That started the first day to sit down.

1389
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:24,180
They had a sit down about it.
Here's how failed.

1390
01:12:24,181 --> 01:12:24,600
It was.

1391
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:29,130
The Italians and the Cubans had a major 
sit down about it to discuss it,

1392
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:32,760
to try to resolve it,
to keep it from exploding into war.

1393
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:34,103
At that sit down,
they didn't resolve anything and after 

1394
01:12:36,571 --> 01:12:39,060
they came out of the restaurant where 
the sit down took place,

1395
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:40,223
a drive by shooting occurred and one of 
the Cubans got shot at the restaurant 

1396
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:47,370
coming out of the sit down and then the 
war was on.

1397
01:12:47,371 --> 01:12:48,840
Man.
It was on like battle said,

1398
01:12:48,841 --> 01:12:49,674
we're at war with the Italians.
That's what he said with his people and 

1399
01:12:52,651 --> 01:12:54,030
battle was ready for it.
Man.

1400
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:55,630
He was good to go.
I mean he,

1401
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:57,930
he was ready for that war.
He seemed to want it.

1402
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:59,303
He seemed to cherish the idea that they 
were going to go to war with the 

1403
01:13:01,861 --> 01:13:06,150
Italians and so they were ordering all 
these horrific and you know how they did

1404
01:13:06,151 --> 01:13:09,330
the arsons they'd get these Mama Luke's 
to fill up a,

1405
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,760
a pail with gasoline.

1406
01:13:12,670 --> 01:13:13,950
Not,
not even a can,

1407
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:16,950
not even a closed Canon Open Pale and 
you know,

1408
01:13:16,951 --> 01:13:21,951
they could spill and they took that pail
of gas and they'd walk into a Bodega,

1409
01:13:22,220 --> 01:13:24,930
bullied the spot and they dump it on the
floor and light it on fire.

1410
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:28,620
And whoever happened to be in there too 
bad for them.

1411
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:32,310
And people would die a horrible death 
that got incinerated.

1412
01:13:32,311 --> 01:13:35,310
I have some pictures in the book that 
are almost too horrific.

1413
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:38,190
I had others that were so bad.
I didn't want to use them in the book.

1414
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,113
Really?
You put something in that book that 

1415
01:13:40,231 --> 01:13:41,064
really blew my mind.
You said that in 1975 or 76 in the 

1416
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:47,860
Hudson county where I'm from,
there was 40 car bombings.

1417
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,590
Oh Man.
Forty car.

1418
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:51,900
Well,
I remember one bombings,

1419
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:56,490
not all car bombing in Hudson county 
from seventh street.

1420
01:13:56,491 --> 01:13:58,590
The 88th street there.
Will you have bail?

1421
01:13:58,650 --> 01:13:59,780
Oh,
bulking up.

1422
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,070
There was 41 car bombings.
There was a time in the seventies in the

1423
01:14:05,071 --> 01:14:09,240
US were bombings.
Homemade bombs were like the preferred a

1424
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,100
weapon of organized.
There were.

1425
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:13,293
There was a.
There was a bombing war in Cleveland 

1426
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:16,840
over this Irish gangster in the 
seventies.

1427
01:14:16,841 --> 01:14:18,660
It was.
It was pretty common to.

1428
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,533
They made a bomb with the males.
The guy who had gotten the Sicilians 

1429
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:25,870
were good.
They did make a movie about Danny Green.

1430
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:27,180
Yeah,
yeah,

1431
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:27,760
yeah.
Yeah.

1432
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,310
What was that movie called?
Kill the kill the Irishmen.

1433
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:31,203
And now that we're doing it again while 
they're doing the Irishman different 

1434
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:35,110
movie.
Yeah.

1435
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:37,510
It's fascinating stuff,
man.

1436
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,030
Now,
did anything surprise you when you were,

1437
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:40,893
you were putting me in.
Obviously you're well versed in 

1438
01:14:42,551 --> 01:14:45,970
organized crime and well versed and 
these kinds of things.

1439
01:14:46,030 --> 01:14:47,110
I think,
uh,

1440
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:47,993
the dominant feeling people will have 
when they're reading this book is the 

1441
01:14:50,801 --> 01:14:52,900
dominant feeling I had when I was 
researching,

1442
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,700
which was why don't I know this shit.

1443
01:14:55,240 --> 01:14:56,680
I mean,
this is really,

1444
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:00,880
this is not only a great story really 
interesting,

1445
01:15:00,881 --> 01:15:01,714
but it's really important history,
all this political connection to 

1446
01:15:04,901 --> 01:15:05,734
anti-castro movement and the role that 
the US government might have played in 

1447
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:10,054
it.
And the idea that this criminal 

1448
01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:12,393
conspiracy organization was allowed to 
go on for 40 years because certain 

1449
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:17,584
elements in theU ,
s government didn't want to go after 

1450
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:24,050
them because they were afraid it would 
open the lid on the Cuban relations with

1451
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:27,310
the,
the anti-castro relations with the CIA,

1452
01:15:27,311 --> 01:15:28,960
the politics of it.
That's,

1453
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,030
that's,
that's not only interesting history.

1454
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:31,864
It's important history to understand a 
certain social political relationship 

1455
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:40,750
between the US and Cuba,
the Bay of Pigs,

1456
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:41,584
the residue of the revolution that way,
the way that shaped the cold war shaped 

1457
01:15:45,221 --> 01:15:48,700
us politics over a period of about 50 
years.

1458
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,950
So I was like,
why don't I know this?

1459
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:51,880
This is amazing.

1460
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,830
This is like almost like a hidden 
history.

1461
01:15:54,040 --> 01:15:57,310
I mean I knew what got reported in the 
newspapers,

1462
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:59,400
but you know,
you lift up the rug and you,

1463
01:15:59,530 --> 01:16:03,220
you look underneath the rug and you 
start to get into the details of it.

1464
01:16:03,221 --> 01:16:04,054
It just makes me so aware that what 
we're receiving as information on a 

1465
01:16:08,141 --> 01:16:08,974
daily basis from the meat,
mainstream media and everything is a 

1466
01:16:12,491 --> 01:16:13,324
version of what's happening.
There's a whole other version of what's 

1467
01:16:16,631 --> 01:16:17,464
happening that we don't see and you 
usually only find out about it 30 years 

1468
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,510
later,
30 years after the fact,

1469
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,300
and that's a good thing to know.
Yeah.

1470
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,940
I mean,
it sounds to me like this is A.

1471
01:16:28,020 --> 01:16:28,630
I mean,
I've,

1472
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:31,630
I haven't heard a peep about this.
When you brought this up to me,

1473
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:33,160
joey and I was like,
what?

1474
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:36,070
The Cuban organized crime,
the corporation.

1475
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,540
What?
What is this like?

1476
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:40,600
This is not discussed.
It's just not.

1477
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:42,550
Well,
hopefully this will change.

1478
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:45,970
I grew up in it and I never talked about
it because like I said,

1479
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:49,410
I have a hundred stores we go for around
a buzzfeed.

1480
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,070
Right,
right,

1481
01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:50,540
right,
right.

1482
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:54,100
There's a lot of shit.
I was saying that I don't say it because

1483
01:16:54,101 --> 01:16:55,420
number one,
you're not going to believe me,

1484
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,660
and number two,
it's not my position.

1485
01:16:58,690 --> 01:17:01,650
I was raised as nothing me to say.
Do you remember that?

1486
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,493
Yes,
but I saw that as a child and then what 

1487
01:17:04,181 --> 01:17:06,730
made it worse for me,
it was moving to North Bergen.

1488
01:17:08,410 --> 01:17:09,950
Once I moved north Bergen,

1489
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:15,220
I saw what they were doing in union city
in a bigger way,

1490
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:20,540
which is all political.
I saw things that are make it tone drop.

1491
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,033
That's why I don't give a fuck about 
politics and the one when I see people 

1492
01:17:24,771 --> 01:17:27,440
talking about politics,
I want to go up to them and go,

1493
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:31,670
if you knew what you were talking about,
you wouldn't say a word because you have

1494
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:36,671
no idea what real politics means.
How it works if it works like that and a

1495
01:17:37,971 --> 01:17:42,971
micro system I can't imagine.
And a real.

1496
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:45,720
So I don't want to pay attention to 
join.

1497
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:49,730
Let me ask you a question because I,
I joined and I connected when I had more

1498
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,240
or less written this already.
Um,

1499
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,970
if I had come to you way back at the 
beginning of this,

1500
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,610
out of the blue,
all of a sudden this Guy Tj English,

1501
01:17:58,611 --> 01:17:59,980
I don't know you because you knew the 
westies.

1502
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,820
So you knew who I was.
He knew I was legit.

1503
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:06,980
If I had contacted you and said,
will you talk to me about this history?

1504
01:18:06,981 --> 01:18:11,981
Would you have done it with everything?
It would take us a week to debrief me.

1505
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,650
So you would have been ready in will.
I would have told you.

1506
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:16,543
Now you see what's interesting,
that thing I would have known because 

1507
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:20,510
somebody has.
Yeah.

1508
01:18:20,511 --> 01:18:23,000
Here,
this fucking story.

1509
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:24,163
He opened up the door for me.
I have a responsibility now that I have 

1510
01:18:28,041 --> 01:18:29,540
another story that,
to this.

1511
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,403
Yes he does.
I have the nuts and bolts of how this 

1512
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:33,374
works.
Have you thought about in addition to 

1513
01:18:34,641 --> 01:18:35,474
this?
I think there's going to be a number of 

1514
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:40,640
spin off books from this.
This is really a book that comes from.

1515
01:18:40,641 --> 01:18:44,210
This is going to tell their personal 
story shot.

1516
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,470
I will end up dead.

1517
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:47,570
Really.
I will end up dead.

1518
01:18:47,780 --> 01:18:50,420
Not because of the.
Because of what I'm exposed to.

1519
01:18:50,660 --> 01:18:52,550
We know who did it in.
In a,

1520
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:53,660
in a.
You know,

1521
01:18:53,780 --> 01:18:54,613
I grew up when I was growing up,
the power in that Hudson county was the 

1522
01:18:59,001 --> 01:18:59,834
waterfront Digi.
That picture in New York City that 

1523
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:03,284
people see.
Thousands of people died for that 

1524
01:19:06,381 --> 01:19:07,214
waterfront.
That waterfront was controlled by 

1525
01:19:10,911 --> 01:19:11,744
wheelock and.
But everybody wanted a piece of it and 

1526
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,250
North Bergen,
one of the pieces of it.

1527
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:19,370
So my eighth grade teacher was the 
weehawken man.

1528
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,200
You ever have a teacher?
That was a man.

1529
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:23,660
Why would a teacher be a mayor of a 
town?

1530
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:25,431
What?
Why,

1531
01:19:25,431 --> 01:19:26,264
why?
Who's ever had a teacher tweet that was 

1532
01:19:29,151 --> 01:19:31,700
the mayor of a town at the same time I 
did.

1533
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,040
And guess what?
At the end of my eighth grade,

1534
01:19:34,041 --> 01:19:37,550
did atf come in and pull them out of 
that real?

1535
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,540
He did 11 years.
Okay.

1536
01:19:40,541 --> 01:19:43,690
I was doing,
he was selling the waterfront.

1537
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:48,470
He all that,
that they knew that there's a particular

1538
01:19:48,471 --> 01:19:52,700
family that I will not mentioned because
I won't even make it to the four.

1539
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:53,534
Oh,
five.

1540
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:57,090
And they were buying that property up 
change 60?

1541
01:19:57,370 --> 01:19:58,150
No,
no,

1542
01:19:58,150 --> 01:19:58,983
no,
it will buying that property up in the 

1543
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:02,420
sixties.
They were posing as politicians.

1544
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:07,440
They chop up $30 million a month now 
between four and then it.

1545
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:08,520
No,
no,

1546
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,353
no.
This is from all of the property they 

1547
01:20:10,351 --> 01:20:12,420
own in Hudson county.
They bought everything.

1548
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:16,260
Jersey City hoboken.
And they make their profit selling it?

1549
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:16,891
No,
no.

1550
01:20:16,891 --> 01:20:19,590
They made their profit renting it or 
renting it.

1551
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,890
So the four of them before brothers,
Chubb $30 million.

1552
01:20:22,891 --> 01:20:25,590
They go their own ways every month.
They chopper 30 million.

1553
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:26,873
So I started from North Bergen.
When I tell you stories about columbine 

1554
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:30,090
bows,
Zana,

1555
01:20:30,090 --> 01:20:30,923
he was a cop.

1556
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:36,590
He was a cop to that I got invited into.
He opened up his home to me.

1557
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:39,630
Then his son died,
the one that was my age,

1558
01:20:39,631 --> 01:20:40,464
so I became a pseudo sun.
So here I am running with the Cubans 

1559
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:44,064
during the week.
They're talking about numbers and drugs 

1560
01:20:46,531 --> 01:20:48,660
and everything,
and I'm growing up in a cop's house.

1561
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:54,480
That's also the driver for the mayor and
he would do whatever,

1562
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:58,420
like I still owe him handcuffed dudes 
and throw Beaton's on them and they call

1563
01:20:58,421 --> 01:21:01,340
them the tour.
They call them combine the torch Mazano,

1564
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:04,170
because his job was to burn your 
building down.

1565
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:06,360
The last one he burned down.
Kids were like,

1566
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,370
Mr. Mr that smoke,
and he's like,

1567
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,040
here's $10.
Who can ice cream?

1568
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:13,140
I'll call the fire department.
He never called him.

1569
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:16,730
He faked a heart attack.
So you don't have to talk to reporters.

1570
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:20,880
First thing you do is you fake a heart 
attack because you don't have to talk to

1571
01:21:20,881 --> 01:21:21,714
reporters.
That gives you two days to get your 

1572
01:21:23,611 --> 01:21:28,410
story straight with the attorney that 
you have no idea what I know now.

1573
01:21:28,640 --> 01:21:29,473
Now the reason I asked,
showing the question about whether he 

1574
01:21:31,401 --> 01:21:32,234
would have been willing to talk is a lot
of people reached out to me early in 

1575
01:21:36,501 --> 01:21:37,790
this book process.
The,

1576
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:38,500
uh,
the,

1577
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,333
the,
the movie rights were options before I 

1578
01:21:41,241 --> 01:21:43,460
even wrote the book based on the book 
proposal.

1579
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:44,983
And I got a lot of media attention and I
started getting emails from nieces and 

1580
01:21:49,521 --> 01:21:54,170
nephews have sons and daughters of key 
characters in the story,

1581
01:21:54,650 --> 01:21:59,650
and these were people like joey who had 
kept us personal family history,

1582
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:03,920
bottle cap,
hadn't talked to anybody about it,

1583
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:04,963
and now they saw I was doing this book 
and they and they needed to get it off 

1584
01:22:08,001 --> 01:22:10,160
their chest.
They needed to talk about it.

1585
01:22:10,161 --> 01:22:11,630
I would go.
I met these two,

1586
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:15,620
these two girls who were daughters of 
one of the guys who became a snitch,

1587
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:16,663
testified against the corporation.
The family went into the witness 

1588
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,970
protection program.
These girls had never talked to anybody.

1589
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,220
When I met,
went to meet with them in a bar.

1590
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,470
They weren't even sure they were going 
to talk to me.

1591
01:22:27,471 --> 01:22:31,040
We were just meeting to talk about 
whether they were going to talk to me.

1592
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,233
I got to meet them.
They talk nonstop for three hours and 

1593
01:22:34,431 --> 01:22:37,610
once they thought they could trust me,
they just,

1594
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:38,503
they couldn't stop talking about it.
They had all the stuff they needed to 

1595
01:22:41,751 --> 01:22:43,060
get off their chest.
Wow.

1596
01:22:43,730 --> 01:22:48,040
Raised.
Not to say God's God's the first raid.

1597
01:22:48,041 --> 01:22:49,660
I saw my mother,
I was five.

1598
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:50,613
They sat me on the couch and read.
My mother had already thrown the coke 

1599
01:22:53,381 --> 01:22:54,214
off about the until the lady downstairs,
the landlord had already called her and 

1600
01:22:58,090 --> 01:22:59,830
said,
the cops are on the way out the door.

1601
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:04,210
We lived on the west side,
terrorists facing a new New Jersey,

1602
01:23:04,570 --> 01:23:05,403
and the lady,
she would pay her rent and tell a hold 

1603
01:23:08,020 --> 01:23:09,400
this bag.
My mother through it,

1604
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,780
they came up,
sat is down.

1605
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:13,060
They asked the subway,
went to Ada Street,

1606
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:14,530
88th street.
We never got raided.

1607
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,700
When I moved to North Bergen,
I would get raided before I got ready to

1608
01:23:18,820 --> 01:23:19,653
the phone would ring and become.
I know that your mom had cleaned the 

1609
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:23,224
house.
I'd wake my mom up to clean the house 

1610
01:23:25,451 --> 01:23:26,284
and come over here.
I don't want you to see what's going to 

1611
01:23:27,401 --> 01:23:28,234
happen.

1612
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:29,163
Cops would come and arrest my mother.
I would walk the columbines obs with my 

1613
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:35,440
basketball right past the cops and it 
was that easy.

1614
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,080
It was that easy.
Wow.

1615
01:23:38,230 --> 01:23:40,810
Do you wish you ran into joey before you
started writing this?

1616
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,710
It would've been a different book.
He wanted.

1617
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:43,653
Why I enjoyed this book so much is 
because no matter how much history this 

1618
01:23:47,681 --> 01:23:52,681
motherfucker dropped on you,
he let you know Jose Battle was.

1619
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:58,120
He kept you.
Remind them who's Jose Battle was.

1620
01:23:58,150 --> 01:23:58,983
That's big for an author.
He never got away from Jose battle and 

1621
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:05,680
when you read the book,
no matter what type of person you are,

1622
01:24:05,710 --> 01:24:09,950
you kind of get mad at Jose battle,
but there's something about Jose battery

1623
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,610
life cause you.
You want that guy in your corner.

1624
01:24:13,030 --> 01:24:16,570
If you knew Jose battle and you knew 
that he got in the truck and say,

1625
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:17,404
I'm going out there for my men,
that's the guy I want with me all the 

1626
01:24:19,961 --> 01:24:20,794
time.
What am I going to hang out with this 

1627
01:24:21,431 --> 01:24:23,230
fucking idiot?
He gets scattered.

1628
01:24:23,231 --> 01:24:24,064
If an ambulance goes by,
this guy actually went out and saved 

1629
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:27,673
that guys.
So he had that Cuban loyalty that Anti 

1630
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:32,830
Castro Cubans.
Shit.

1631
01:24:32,830 --> 01:24:36,250
That's big.
So growing up there was so many things I

1632
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:40,240
wasn't allowed to.
I wasn't even allowed to talk about.

1633
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,310
Now,
here's how ruthless this guy.

1634
01:24:42,311 --> 01:24:42,821
Well,
let me,

1635
01:24:42,821 --> 01:24:43,320
let me,
let,

1636
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:46,640
let you answer the question though.
Do you wish that you would run into joe?

1637
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:48,560
Ah,
yes I do,

1638
01:24:48,590 --> 01:24:52,490
but the thing that fears me,
there was so much research to do in this

1639
01:24:52,491 --> 01:24:53,960
book.
If I would have met Joey,

1640
01:24:53,961 --> 01:24:54,794
I would have gone down a rabbit hole 
with joey stories and that might've 

1641
01:24:58,520 --> 01:25:02,000
taken me off this specific research I 
was doing,

1642
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:06,200
so I almost joey joey's thing is like a 
separate thing.

1643
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:11,390
It's almost like a a sequel to or a sub 
or a son.

1644
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:12,373
The son of the corporation,
sort of a spinoff of it and there's a 

1645
01:25:15,351 --> 01:25:16,184
lot of people probably who have their 
version of it like joey does that they 

1646
01:25:19,641 --> 01:25:23,060
could tell,
so yeah.

1647
01:25:23,061 --> 01:25:25,100
But let me say about battle because Joey
St,

1648
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:26,023
very interesting thing.
How charismatic he was and how you 

1649
01:25:28,310 --> 01:25:31,190
partly liked him and admired him,
which was was the,

1650
01:25:31,330 --> 01:25:33,050
is the case of any good leader,
right?

1651
01:25:33,051 --> 01:25:36,260
That's what you want from a leader.
But here's how ruthless this guy was.

1652
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:39,350
He had a guy in his organization or 
Nesto Torres,

1653
01:25:39,460 --> 01:25:42,200
Ernesto,
who he met in Spain.

1654
01:25:42,201 --> 01:25:43,034
Battle was on the run in Madrid for a 
brief period of time when he'd been 

1655
01:25:45,471 --> 01:25:48,710
indicted on gambling charges and there 
were a bunch of Cubans living over there

1656
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:53,810
and they all hung out together and he.
He discovered this 19 year old kid named

1657
01:25:53,811 --> 01:25:58,340
Ernesto Torres,
who was sort of an orphan and one day he

1658
01:25:58,341 --> 01:26:00,650
tells the kid he's going to mentor the 
kid.

1659
01:26:00,651 --> 01:26:01,670
One day,
tells the kid,

1660
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:04,640
I've got a guy coming this afternoon to 
the apartment.

1661
01:26:04,641 --> 01:26:07,370
I want you to watch.
He owes me $10,000.

1662
01:26:07,730 --> 01:26:09,830
I'm going to scare the shit out of this 
guy.

1663
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:10,664
I want you to see what you do,
how you treat somebody who owes you 

1664
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:14,624
money,
show them that they can't play around 

1665
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:19,070
with you.
So he's waiting for the guy to come over

1666
01:26:19,530 --> 01:26:20,363
battle and he's sitting in his apartment
and here's a pop pop from out in the 

1667
01:26:23,301 --> 01:26:23,840
street.

1668
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:25,250
He goes down,
he goes out.

1669
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:28,730
Earnest Eco.
Nineteen year old is there with a gun in

1670
01:26:28,731 --> 01:26:31,880
his hand.
He's shot the guy in the backseat of the

1671
01:26:31,881 --> 01:26:34,760
cab arriving to meet with battling,
killing him.

1672
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:36,660
And he says,
uh,

1673
01:26:36,830 --> 01:26:38,090
Padrino Godfather.
He says,

1674
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:39,980
you'll never have a problem with this 
guy again.

1675
01:26:39,981 --> 01:26:42,500
I took care of it and battles looking at
it going,

1676
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,810
Ugh,
you just cost me $10,000.

1677
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:47,700
I didn't want the guy dead.
Uh,

1678
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,360
but then again,
he looks at her and he thinks I can use.

1679
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:53,060
I can use this guy,
I can use this guy.

1680
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,660
So earnest ego becomes what he calls his
protocol son.

1681
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,020
And he grooms this guy to maybe be the 
next Godfather.

1682
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:03,350
When they come back to New Jersey,
they come back to union city.

1683
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,610
He,
he sends this Guy Ernest,

1684
01:27:05,611 --> 01:27:09,620
he go out there and no one else in the 
corporation can understand battles.

1685
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:12,470
Affection for this guy they think are in
a tequilas thug.

1686
01:27:12,680 --> 01:27:14,300
He's a killer.
He's a street dog.

1687
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:16,370
Yeah,
the organization can use guys like that,

1688
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,010
but you don't put him in positions of 
authority.

1689
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,470
Battle scene have a soft spot for this 
guy.

1690
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:26,830
He makes earnest tico a banker.
He makes the other bankers bank roll,

1691
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,183
uh,
put up $10,000 each so that earnest can 

1692
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:32,240
be a banker.
They don't like it.

1693
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:35,060
Most of them don't like it,
but they go along with a couple of them.

1694
01:27:35,061 --> 01:27:38,150
Don't go along with it.
Ernest ego doesn't have the brains to be

1695
01:27:38,151 --> 01:27:40,850
a banker.
He fails miserably as a banker.

1696
01:27:41,150 --> 01:27:43,700
He's humiliated by that.
And so what he does,

1697
01:27:43,701 --> 01:27:48,020
he starts kidnapping bankers from the 
organization and holding them for money,

1698
01:27:48,740 --> 01:27:52,400
very self destructive thing to do.
He turns against the organization.

1699
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:55,490
He goes rogue.
One of them is shoots a banker.

1700
01:27:55,491 --> 01:27:57,500
He kidnaps and shoots happens to be 
paddles,

1701
01:27:57,510 --> 01:28:00,790
brother-in-law.
The bankers come to Jose Miguel battle.

1702
01:28:00,790 --> 01:28:01,400
They say,
you,

1703
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,590
you created this,
this fucking monster.

1704
01:28:03,890 --> 01:28:05,930
You brought this kid in.
You created them.

1705
01:28:06,110 --> 01:28:08,720
You got to take care of it.
That'll be in the man.

1706
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:10,400
He is.
Realizes that that's true.

1707
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:11,653
It's his responsibility.
He hires a few assassins to try to take 

1708
01:28:14,901 --> 01:28:15,710
her in St.
Cloud.

1709
01:28:15,710 --> 01:28:19,610
They bomb his car in union city.
They tried to kill him.

1710
01:28:19,611 --> 01:28:20,444
They can't get the job done.
Battle decides he's got to do the thing 

1711
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,700
himself.
By this time,

1712
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:26,534
Ernest Tico has fled to Miami.
He's hiding out with his girlfriend in 

1713
01:28:29,001 --> 01:28:31,430
OPA.
Locka battle gets together,

1714
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,353
his brother,
one of his brothers and another 

1715
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:38,630
assassin,
Chino Akuna and a day go down to.

1716
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,410
They go down to Miami and in the middle 
of the afternoon they burst in this guy,

1717
01:28:42,411 --> 01:28:44,330
they find out where he as a person,
his apartment,

1718
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,433
they engage in a wild shootout with her 
and it's Tico and they shoot him in the 

1719
01:28:48,711 --> 01:28:51,080
closet of his bedroom at battle,
goes in,

1720
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:53,150
grabs him by the hair and shoots him 
right ripe.

1721
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:56,510
It puts a bullet right between his eyes.
Now that's a boss.

1722
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:57,463
I mean,
aside from the horrible nature of the 

1723
01:28:59,061 --> 01:29:00,680
act,
that's a leader.

1724
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:02,070
That's a guy who

1725
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,100
takes matters into his own hands.
He wants something done.

1726
01:29:05,101 --> 01:29:10,101
He goes and does it himself and uses 
that as an example for the organization.

1727
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:14,250
He comes back to the bosses,
the bankers in New York.

1728
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:16,073
He says,
you're not going to have a problem with 

1729
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:18,090
with ernest eco anymore.
He says,

1730
01:29:18,091 --> 01:29:20,220
you know what?
He died like a lion.

1731
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,980
He fought to the death.
He empty.

1732
01:29:22,981 --> 01:29:25,860
He fought until he'd empty his gun and 
shot him in the closet.

1733
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:29,670
So he's telling all the other backers,
I still admire the kid.

1734
01:29:30,210 --> 01:29:32,550
He fought like a lion,
but I took care of it.

1735
01:29:32,551 --> 01:29:34,650
It's done.
And you know the other,

1736
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:35,513
the other belief the bankers were in.
We're in awe of this guy because he had 

1737
01:29:38,461 --> 01:29:43,200
a certain ability to do that,
that they didn't have this in the book.

1738
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,981
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

1739
01:29:43,981 --> 01:29:48,480
There's pictures of it in the blue.
What was the logic to take this thug and

1740
01:29:48,481 --> 01:29:49,950
tournament to a banker in the first 
place?

1741
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:52,770
He had a soft spot for him.
Battle was a sentimentalist.

1742
01:29:52,771 --> 01:29:55,730
He took in stray dogs.
He drive around this.

1743
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:56,653
He'd drive around and he'd see a dog on 
the street and he'd open the door and 

1744
01:29:59,731 --> 01:30:01,230
he'd say,
come if the dog come.

1745
01:30:01,231 --> 01:30:05,310
He took the dog in and in his home in 
Miami as a state in Miami.

1746
01:30:05,311 --> 01:30:07,760
He had like 25 stray dogs.
Wow.

1747
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:08,723
And uh,
they said Ernest Tico is like a stray 

1748
01:30:10,231 --> 01:30:11,064
dog.
He had a soft spot for the kid before I 

1749
01:30:13,111 --> 01:30:15,100
piss real quick.
Don't.

1750
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:19,760
Cube with a dog is a big symbol.
My toys was real big circle care.

1751
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:22,860
When Michael Vick got convicted,
there was a lot of jails.

1752
01:30:22,861 --> 01:30:23,694
He couldn't be center because they had 
an adequate population and they don't 

1753
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:32,130
play when it comes to dog because the 
devotion is to St Laszlo Way.

1754
01:30:32,131 --> 01:30:32,964
St Lazarus who got these,
the ones with the crutches that got his 

1755
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:41,010
licks and,
and then his by there was a lot like you

1756
01:30:41,011 --> 01:30:41,844
bro,
when people would say that whether you 

1757
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:43,884
bring art and Joel is on the real 
because I love these motherfuckers and 

1758
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:46,750
fuck you.

1759
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,410
You got a problem for you.
You know what I'm saying?

1760
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:53,220
That's what he was.
He was very loyal and uh,

1761
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,460
until you,
until you turned onto the attorney.

1762
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:58,190
But you know,
they almost canceled the sopranos.

1763
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:00,540
The HBO got really pissed at the 
Sopranos.

1764
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:01,553
Episode seven when he drives his 
daughter to the school and he kills the 

1765
01:31:04,531 --> 01:31:09,531
guy personally because hbo felt that 
bosses should never do heads.

1766
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,060
That was,
he did that over time.

1767
01:31:12,090 --> 01:31:14,510
Hbo Film,
Hbo felt they were,

1768
01:31:14,511 --> 01:31:16,970
that they were that chase.
Fuck this Ross Greenberg.

1769
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:22,310
They will chase and said,
we don't think in real life a boss maybe

1770
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,610
went and he picked up the guy by his 
neck when he drove a whatever,

1771
01:31:26,611 --> 01:31:27,444
willow,
the college that the hbo threatened the 

1772
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:35,220
Sopranos,
not the add that episode to cut that,

1773
01:31:35,221 --> 01:31:38,850
to make somebody else killed a guy that 
wasn't the only guy.

1774
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,680
Was that because they wanted Tony 
Soprano.

1775
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:42,490
They still wanted them to be some sort 
of a hero.

1776
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:45,780
They didn't understand that he wanted to
keep your hands clean.

1777
01:31:45,810 --> 01:31:46,643
Then the ridiculous because that was one
of the more appealing things about that 

1778
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:52,180
show that show he was a murderer.
But you still like no,

1779
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:57,200
at the end that he killed Pilou to uh,
he tried to cut his leg off me.

1780
01:31:59,151 --> 01:32:00,280
Tell you a little on fire

1781
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:01,960
and tell you that.
Let Me Go pee real quick.

1782
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,870
The police story,
political killed battles brother.

1783
01:32:04,871 --> 01:32:07,710
His youngest brother in a dispute shot 
him in a,

1784
01:32:08,160 --> 01:32:11,350
in a bar in Washington heights.
Very public murder.

1785
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:14,290
I mean as an insult to the battle 
family.

1786
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:18,190
So now Jose Miguel battle is fucking 
livid.

1787
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:22,720
And at the funeral in union city,
he gathers his men together and he says,

1788
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:24,010
you know,
I want this guys,

1789
01:32:24,570 --> 01:32:26,410
I want this guys head on the wall.
I want,

1790
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,750
I want to be able to mount this guy's 
head on my wall.

1791
01:32:29,080 --> 01:32:30,080
And uh,
he,

1792
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,390
he puts out a hit on this guy for 
$100,000 and this is in the seventies.

1793
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:37,090
So you know,
that's probably a million.

1794
01:32:37,091 --> 01:32:37,924
It's probably a million dollars.
A earnest equals the one that takes on 

1795
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:45,470
ernest take on another assassin are the 
ones that take on that contract and they

1796
01:32:45,471 --> 01:32:46,870
go out trying to get pilou.

1797
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,243
I mentioned before,
there's something like nine attempts or 

1798
01:32:51,251 --> 01:32:52,084
12 attempts on Palooz life.
They had a shoot out in central park 

1799
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:57,970
with machine guns in the middle of the 
afternoon.

1800
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:58,833
Holy Shit,
guys with machine guns shooting with 

1801
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:05,560
mothers with baby carriages and stuff.
Palooza got shot up so bad.

1802
01:33:05,561 --> 01:33:06,394
He loses his leg.
He winds up having to have a prosthetic 

1803
01:33:08,621 --> 01:33:11,320
leg.
They still go after Pilou.

1804
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:12,663
One pilou goes to prison.
They hire a killer to stab him in the 

1805
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:18,790
prison yard twice,
two separate times.

1806
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:22,750
And He survived that.
He keeps surviving and he survived.

1807
01:33:22,751 --> 01:33:24,610
So many of these assassination attempts,
they,

1808
01:33:24,930 --> 01:33:26,560
they,
they think he's not human.

1809
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:27,603
They come to believe that he's got some 
sense santeria spirit who's protecting 

1810
01:33:30,581 --> 01:33:32,570
him.
So when you think someone has this,

1811
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:34,030
I was still,
he was here for this.

1812
01:33:34,390 --> 01:33:38,350
When you have someone you think has a 
Santeria spirit protecting them,

1813
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:40,570
you have to counter that with a center.

1814
01:33:40,570 --> 01:33:41,403
He a spirit of your own.
You have to have what's called the 

1815
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:44,680
Bombay,
where you were,

1816
01:33:44,681 --> 01:33:46,890
you were.
You create a,

1817
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:50,500
a kind of Voodoo energy to kill this 
guy.

1818
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:53,050
So they.
So they continue to go after poodle.

1819
01:33:53,051 --> 01:33:56,560
Finally battle as he did with Ernest 
[inaudible] says,

1820
01:33:56,800 --> 01:33:58,480
I'm going to take matters into my own 
hands.

1821
01:33:58,481 --> 01:34:00,490
I'm going to.
I'm going to be there on this one.

1822
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:01,743
They find out where Pilou is in the 
Bronx and they go on one night and they 

1823
01:34:05,771 --> 01:34:08,000
trap him.
They see cars come from all sides.

1824
01:34:08,001 --> 01:34:09,940
They trap him.
He gets out of his car,

1825
01:34:09,941 --> 01:34:13,270
they shoot him in the street,
they shoot them full of 11 bullets.

1826
01:34:13,271 --> 01:34:17,860
He falls in the street,
a bleeding loaded with gunshots.

1827
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:23,050
The last thing he sees is Jose Miguel 
battle standing over him,

1828
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:23,973
laughing at him,
and then he goes unconscious in the 

1829
01:34:26,321 --> 01:34:27,640
street.
They think,

1830
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:28,451
great,
he's dead.

1831
01:34:28,451 --> 01:34:29,284
They're almost ready to celebrate.
The following morning they find out now 

1832
01:34:32,630 --> 01:34:35,080
polluted was rushed to the hospital.
He's not dead.

1833
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:37,990
He's recovering now.
They're beside themselves.

1834
01:34:37,991 --> 01:34:39,900
What corneal.
They've tried everything.

1835
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:41,510
They've tried everything.
Uh,

1836
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,730
they say,
you know what?

1837
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:46,480
We're not going to give up.
They hire an assassin.

1838
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:50,200
Dress him up as a male nurse.
He goes into the hospital,

1839
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:51,093
shoots Pilou in his,
in his hospital bed right between the 

1840
01:34:54,251 --> 01:34:56,560
eyes and it got to.
They got the job done.

1841
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,070
He was talking when you were gone,

1842
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:02,150
about how if you felt like a guy had a 
Santa Ria spirit protecting them,

1843
01:35:02,450 --> 01:35:06,060
you had to have your own Santa Maria to 
come back to combat it.

1844
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:10,250
Santa Ria became a scam after.
Well,

1845
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,280
like I was raised in Santa Maria from 
the age of five.

1846
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,400
I had little disturbances when my dad 
died.

1847
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:18,290
I was weak.
I didn't.

1848
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:21,070
They didn't put me into Santa Ria to be 
a witch.

1849
01:35:21,071 --> 01:35:23,000
Doctor explained Santa Maria to people 
who don't know what,

1850
01:35:23,001 --> 01:35:25,550
it's a religion that originated in 
Africa,

1851
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:26,393
Nigeria,
and then the slaves brought it over to 

1852
01:35:27,861 --> 01:35:28,694
Cuba.
They hit it from the plantation owners 

1853
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:35,480
through Catholicism,
so that's why there's a lot of cross.

1854
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:38,720
It's kind of a mixture of African 
Catholic Catholic religion.

1855
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:39,943
When I was five I was brought up to 
148th street and this lady had a collie 

1856
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,930
dog and I loved the Cali.
I love dogs and I was allergic to them,

1857
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:49,273
so while I was playing with the dog,
she would talk to me and I fell in love 

1858
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:52,874
with this woman.

1859
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:57,050
I fell in love with her.
She was like my mother and then as I got

1860
01:35:57,051 --> 01:35:58,460
older,
one that they asked me,

1861
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,170
do you want this?
Do you want that?

1862
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:03,180
Do you want to get like,
wow.

1863
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:05,820
Which is the first one you get at like 
Wildo Goon,

1864
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:07,813
Yoel Romero.
Those are the first things you get and 

1865
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:14,240
you put them by your door and they 
guarantee you know your safety.

1866
01:36:14,241 --> 01:36:15,074
For me it was health.
That big black woman who is my 

1867
01:36:17,271 --> 01:36:18,680
godmother.
Okay.

1868
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:22,140
And then after that,
when I was six,

1869
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:22,993
they finally said they were going to 
initiate me and my mother because my 

1870
01:36:29,211 --> 01:36:31,640
spirit took my father.
Wow.

1871
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:35,660
So they wanted my godmother.
They wanted me and my mother to be twins

1872
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:36,883
in the Santa Maria.
So I made st 148th street and Broadway 

1873
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:41,653
and.
But for me it wasn't to be a killer or 

1874
01:36:43,371 --> 01:36:44,450
would it be anything like that?

1875
01:36:44,450 --> 01:36:48,590
I can't carry guns.
I can't go in cars with strange people.

1876
01:36:48,591 --> 01:36:51,680
I can't do business with three people.
I can't say.

1877
01:36:51,681 --> 01:36:55,550
I hope Jamie fucking gets hit by a car.
I'm not allowed to say all those things.

1878
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:56,384
I don't use it the way in the late 17 
you do business with three people 

1879
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:02,750
because two of them will sidle up 
against you.

1880
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:04,820
And that's the same thing that happened 
to me on my kidnapping.

1881
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:08,350
I rob somebody with three people.
I can't stay in everything.

1882
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:12,110
I look at my life now look at my life 
when I was a white powder,

1883
01:37:12,530 --> 01:37:16,130
my st in my head is controlled.
Like that's why I always wearing a white

1884
01:37:16,131 --> 01:37:17,990
t shirt on Mondays.
It's a day of this.

1885
01:37:18,890 --> 01:37:20,860
You always wear a white t shirt or 
Monday.

1886
01:37:21,870 --> 01:37:25,040
Look at my shoes.
White on white.

1887
01:37:25,610 --> 01:37:30,140
Always when I step out of the shower I 
walk on totally on our mat everyday,

1888
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:31,460
everyday,
everyday.

1889
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:32,633
I'm still very Santa Maria in my head.
I wasn't when I was doing the coke 

1890
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:37,573
because I knew I wasn't allowed to.
What happened in the in the mid 

1891
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:45,530
seventies with St Dharia was I would pay
you to tell me what you wanted to hear.

1892
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:47,263
Listen,
I got a big cargo coming in from 

1893
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:52,970
Columbia with 100 kilos.
What will the St say I do?

1894
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:57,780
It's fucking religion.
They don't fucking transport blow,

1895
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:03,120
but these people got enamored with it,
so it was like,

1896
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:06,600
you know a Dj,
you know,

1897
01:38:06,601 --> 01:38:07,434
I want to kill Joe Rogan.
Let me put a spouse and you're supposed 

1898
01:38:09,211 --> 01:38:10,044
to write your name on a thing and then 
take a tongue and put it in the cow's 

1899
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:13,974
tongue.
Like there was a big story when I was a 

1900
01:38:15,721 --> 01:38:19,890
kid for dotty.
One of a story that he's in the book.

1901
01:38:19,891 --> 01:38:22,110
He's Omega Seven.
I didn't know this growing up.

1902
01:38:22,710 --> 01:38:23,543
He went to court one time and his 
godmother made a powder and before the 

1903
01:38:26,971 --> 01:38:27,804
judge went to make a verdict,
she splayed the power and the thing and 

1904
01:38:31,951 --> 01:38:35,700
the judge fucking couldn't remember what
the fuck he was about to say,

1905
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:39,600
dismissed the case and she became a star
after that.

1906
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:43,080
Every fucking criminal wanting to give 
her thousands of dollars.

1907
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:45,540
What was the powder like a thing they 
made.

1908
01:38:45,541 --> 01:38:46,374
There's a movie they called years ago.
It was a the devil's advocate with a 

1909
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:51,933
with Keanu reeves and Pachino and 
there's one scene where he has to go 

1910
01:38:55,381 --> 01:38:57,690
protect the guy.
The guy's a Santa Ria guy.

1911
01:38:58,020 --> 01:39:02,160
New York is prosecuting him because he's
killing animals without a license and he

1912
01:39:02,161 --> 01:39:03,030
goes,
watch this.

1913
01:39:03,180 --> 01:39:05,190
He takes a tongue and he puts the tongue
down.

1914
01:39:05,191 --> 01:39:08,040
He blasts the tongue with like a thing 
and then he says.

1915
01:39:08,041 --> 01:39:09,780
He asked the guy what's the judge's 
name?

1916
01:39:10,590 --> 01:39:11,423
And the judge gave him his name and he 
took the tongue and they roll it with 

1917
01:39:13,531 --> 01:39:15,900
nails and then they put it away and they
go,

1918
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:18,810
don't worry about tomorrow.
The next day at court,

1919
01:39:18,811 --> 01:39:22,050
the judge starts to fucking talk and he 
goes and pull up coughing.

1920
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,140
Spring.
He can't fucking talk.

1921
01:39:25,650 --> 01:39:26,483
Now that person looks like a hero.
These are all subtle coincidence that 

1922
01:39:31,591 --> 01:39:36,591
these fucking specs for fueled by now.
So now I gotta I got have a big week.

1923
01:39:37,291 --> 01:39:38,124
Joe Rogan.
What is the St say you get four pieces 

1924
01:39:40,381 --> 01:39:41,214
of coconut.
You throw them on the floor and the St 

1925
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:46,680
say this is going to be your week.
Let me give you a $20,000.

1926
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,190
So now drug dealers started doing it 
with Noriega got busted.

1927
01:39:50,191 --> 01:39:54,750
He had Santa Maria in his closet.
Fidel was well known for Santa Maria and

1928
01:39:54,751 --> 01:39:57,140
his closet dudes.
Well,

1929
01:39:57,150 --> 01:39:58,660
they have a.
You have a special moment.

1930
01:39:58,740 --> 01:39:59,573
You have an altar.
I made a promise when I lived in that 

1931
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:03,000
apartment that have got.
If about the law,

1932
01:40:03,010 --> 01:40:04,530
got me a house,
he would have his own room.

1933
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:08,910
Go to my house.
My St isn't my office right behind me.

1934
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:14,220
I'm not an author and I also have a few.
If you get into the Cuban thing,

1935
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:16,470
it will get you.
We'll get it will get you.

1936
01:40:16,471 --> 01:40:19,690
It's so cute from reading this book I 
have.

1937
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:22,400
I haven't to have an.
You have to have like,

1938
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:24,950
why's my.
He's a little boy.

1939
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,200
You do this.
It's a belief system.

1940
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,213
Why did you do?
Because you can't really understand a 

1941
01:40:30,781 --> 01:40:33,240
culture unless you embrace it on some 
level.

1942
01:40:33,241 --> 01:40:34,074
You understand it and live it.
Unless you continued even after the 

1943
01:40:36,721 --> 01:40:37,554
book.
Oh yeah.

1944
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:38,413
I've had people talk to me when I've 
thrown cards or by you throwing cards 

1945
01:40:42,151 --> 01:40:44,490
about when people have done my readings.

1946
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,310
They have mentioned you in my readings 
really that you're around the euro.

1947
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,313
A lot of sun all the way to the end.
What does that mean about the lives on 

1948
01:40:52,141 --> 01:40:55,870
the old wise,
he has 24 different passages.

1949
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:59,140
He goes my passages or Jago?
Nah,

1950
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,453
that's the one you don't want around 
because they were supposed to push out 

1951
01:41:02,921 --> 01:41:05,680
and go in my head,
but the time me down,

1952
01:41:05,681 --> 01:41:07,690
I wish I chunk.
Chunk.

1953
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:11,110
Go means thunder.
Whenever you see thundery shit,

1954
01:41:11,111 --> 01:41:14,200
that's Chango.
Chango is a bad and a woman.

1955
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:15,453
You can't kill mice around him.
They beheaded them because a mouse woke 

1956
01:41:18,551 --> 01:41:21,210
him up and he woke up and Oh,
it's fucked.

1957
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:25,240
You have no idea.
And is the drum the Conga drum,

1958
01:41:25,300 --> 01:41:27,700
which is to thunder.
Summoning the thunder.

1959
01:41:27,701 --> 01:41:28,534
Yeah.
So they put a box in my head to calm me 

1960
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:32,110
down.
I'm not supposed to carry weapons.

1961
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:35,470
I can't have knives on me.
I can't get into arguments.

1962
01:41:36,850 --> 01:41:38,540
My mother in the same dot,
Chung.

1963
01:41:38,630 --> 01:41:41,530
She's just a whore.
She's just a tune.

1964
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:44,040
Is the horror of the same.
She gave him a kid.

1965
01:41:44,041 --> 01:41:45,550
So yeah,
my Yada res.

1966
01:41:46,090 --> 01:41:49,240
If you have problems with your stomach 
or you want to have a kid,

1967
01:41:49,241 --> 01:41:50,074
you have to pray it or chew you know.
But the women's saints have worse than 

1968
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:55,474
the male saints.
You don't fuck around with the women 

1969
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:02,380
sayings because they will fuck your 
world up tune is probably Mary Magdalen.

1970
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,310
Yes.
And My.

1971
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,640
I sent a message to my mother.
My Mother didn't do it.

1972
01:42:05,670 --> 01:42:07,810
My mother died,
you know,

1973
01:42:08,140 --> 01:42:10,460
he says that there's a,
a,

1974
01:42:10,530 --> 01:42:11,363
another side to the story and you know,
like I told him the last time we have 

1975
01:42:15,791 --> 01:42:18,250
this Michael,
my mother had made for years.

1976
01:42:18,970 --> 01:42:21,040
They sent me the sacred heart school for
boys.

1977
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:23,560
Yeah,
she sent me that a good education,

1978
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:26,650
but she sent me that because it was a 
lot of shit she didn't want me to say at

1979
01:42:26,651 --> 01:42:31,651
that time and when I got a Catholic 
school I was introduced to it and one of

1980
01:42:32,111 --> 01:42:35,590
the things I got introduced in one night
was the end of union city.

1981
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:41,550
The end of that political era where 
everything was running smooth came to an

1982
01:42:41,651 --> 01:42:43,150
end,
like in 76.

1983
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,980
That's when allegations started to come 
up because there was two cops that would

1984
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:50,290
shake my mother down.
Very decent people.

1985
01:42:50,980 --> 01:42:52,870
They would come in when I came well 
dressed,

1986
01:42:52,871 --> 01:42:54,850
would have a drink,
talk to my mother in Spanish.

1987
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:58,540
My mother would feed him.
It was a price of doing business,

1988
01:42:58,541 --> 01:42:59,410
Joe Rogan.
Now,

1989
01:42:59,411 --> 01:43:04,411
here's how I knew joey was legit because
when we first started communicating,

1990
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:08,230
he mentioned the name of one of these 
cops and that name is in the book,

1991
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:10,160
uh,
Frank Mona,

1992
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:14,200
a well known cop in union city at the 
time,

1993
01:43:14,201 --> 01:43:18,580
so I knew right away to your house and 
you had $200,000,

1994
01:43:18,910 --> 01:43:21,130
only 100,000 dollars and make it to the 
police station.

1995
01:43:21,460 --> 01:43:23,980
So my step father Juan wanted to kill 
him.

1996
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:28,480
He confiscated ones lecture to 25.
That was like,

1997
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:29,240
for,
you know,

1998
01:43:29,240 --> 01:43:32,260
like when Tony Montana picks up Michelle
five and he goes,

1999
01:43:32,261 --> 01:43:35,080
what is God lack,
let me tell you.

2000
01:43:35,081 --> 01:43:35,914
So you could put a porsche,
the best portion of the world and the 

2001
01:43:39,911 --> 01:43:40,744
1975 cadillac makes to a Cuban and he's 
going to take the cadillac because 

2002
01:43:45,401 --> 01:43:47,830
that's,
that's a scheme that's radical.

2003
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:49,720
That's what it is to be fucking.

2004
01:43:51,820 --> 01:43:52,653
When Mona took that Cadillac from one,
he didn't shut up about that for 10 

2005
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:58,460
years.
He wants to shoot that fucking cop.

2006
01:43:59,600 --> 01:44:00,433
But that cop was a clean cut.
There was a dirty cop and he always 

2007
01:44:03,291 --> 01:44:04,124
busted my mother's balls,
but he wouldn't come in for the 

2008
01:44:06,690 --> 01:44:10,970
shakedowns.
It was two other guys thought about 76.

2009
01:44:10,971 --> 01:44:14,120
This guy started coming out and that 
kind of looked like a,

2010
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:16,280
like Jim Morrison,
Cuban,

2011
01:44:16,281 --> 01:44:17,114
good looking dude when another white 
partner and they would come in and they 

2012
01:44:20,331 --> 01:44:23,510
would yell at my mother and my mom had a
bar,

2013
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,020
the pool table on the back and then she 
had a main office.

2014
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:30,980
If she had to take a number or somebody 
might have to play a number.

2015
01:44:30,981 --> 01:44:32,810
She rented an apartment.
She owned the building,

2016
01:44:33,410 --> 01:44:34,243
so she rented the apartment upstairs 
that had a line to the back so you 

2017
01:44:38,691 --> 01:44:41,870
couldn't follow them saying 10 so you 
could choose to the back office.

2018
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:42,913
I was in that back office one day and I 
heard yelling and I came outside and 

2019
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:47,960
this cop was pressuring my mother 
saying,

2020
01:44:47,961 --> 01:44:50,600
fuck you.
We know what the fuck you're doing.

2021
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:53,180
We want our money.
Now.

2022
01:44:53,181 --> 01:44:55,790
At that time,
union city ran from seven to 48th street

2023
01:44:55,791 --> 01:45:00,791
and there was a bunch of bars.
Was a cafe.

2024
01:45:02,450 --> 01:45:07,450
The cafe of artists at Brean d,
these are all well known Cuban book,

2025
01:45:08,111 --> 01:45:12,740
your spot and this guy started torturing
Cubans and the Cubans were like,

2026
01:45:12,741 --> 01:45:16,790
what the fuck is going on?
We pay and all of a sudden this guy,

2027
01:45:16,791 --> 01:45:20,960
but will piss the Cubans off the most 
was that this guy was cute.

2028
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:24,710
His name was nicky Gerardo,
and he was,

2029
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:27,210
you know what happened and this kept on 
and one day I'm in.

2030
01:45:27,290 --> 01:45:31,580
I used to go to Mckinley school and I 
would walk up to my mother's bar and one

2031
01:45:31,581 --> 01:45:32,414
day I walked up there and every one of 
those Cuban owners were in there 

2032
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:40,460
drinking fucking yelling and that Castro
Shit.

2033
01:45:40,490 --> 01:45:43,360
There was one way before the subprime 
was his name was treating.

2034
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:48,350
That means sad pussy.
He owned the club on 35th street.

2035
01:45:48,650 --> 01:45:49,483
Now in union city,
you also have to remember there's a bar 

2036
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:54,560
called the bottom of the barrel and if 
you read any mafia books,

2037
01:45:54,561 --> 01:45:56,600
the bottom of the barrels and every 
mafia book,

2038
01:45:57,160 --> 01:45:59,000
it sounds.
It's where Henry Hill hung out.

2039
01:45:59,030 --> 01:46:01,430
Dominic,
Montego Leo and Nino Gaji.

2040
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:03,290
It's right there.
I'm bergenline avenue.

2041
01:46:03,291 --> 01:46:05,140
So all this was going on and you didn't 
sit.

2042
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:08,480
So he's the real fucking deal.
Okay.

2043
01:46:08,481 --> 01:46:10,600
It's real now.
Fucking.

2044
01:46:10,601 --> 01:46:11,030
Yeah.

2045
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:13,700
Now before we get off Santa Maria.
Uh,

2046
01:46:14,260 --> 01:46:15,093
yeah.
I told you the story about Ernest tico 

2047
01:46:16,701 --> 01:46:21,230
right after an stk who got murdered and 
they searched his apartment.

2048
01:46:21,530 --> 01:46:22,363
They found a bunch of tapes.
He had been taping phone conversations 

2049
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:28,940
with all the people around him and he 
taped some conversations with his mother

2050
01:46:29,030 --> 01:46:29,863
packing Kua.
Ernest Eagle knew he was hunt a hunted 

2051
01:46:32,391 --> 01:46:33,141
man.
He,

2052
01:46:33,141 --> 01:46:33,974
they had been attempts.
He was hiding out in a phone 

2053
01:46:36,711 --> 01:46:39,950
conversation with his mother like three 
days before they got him.

2054
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:42,470
He's talking with his mother and she 
says,

2055
01:46:42,471 --> 01:46:43,850
I know.
I'm worried.

2056
01:46:43,851 --> 01:46:45,740
I know they're trying to get you.
I'm worried.

2057
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:49,260
I knew I'm going to do a bay to try to 
protect you.

2058
01:46:49,590 --> 01:46:50,423
And he says,
yeah,

2059
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:51,390
I need it.
You know,

2060
01:46:51,391 --> 01:46:53,580
he says,
I'm caught in the middle of a war of the

2061
01:46:53,581 --> 01:46:55,530
saints.
I'm caught in the middle of a war of the

2062
01:46:55,531 --> 01:46:56,364
saints.

2063
01:46:56,490 --> 01:46:59,160
And she says,
I need some new names for my mba.

2064
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,740
And he names the people who have been 
been a,

2065
01:47:03,020 --> 01:47:05,210
a ceremony,
uh,

2066
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,113
you know,
a ceremonial summoning of the spirits 

2067
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:13,350
for one purpose or another,
and she was above allow a priestess.

2068
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:14,633
Um,
so he gives her the very people who are 

2069
01:47:17,821 --> 01:47:19,680
after him,
Jose Miguel battle,

2070
01:47:19,710 --> 01:47:20,543
he says a Chino or Konya,
he names all the people who are trying 

2071
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:27,540
to kill him.
So there's mother can use those names in

2072
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:30,540
her ceremony.
So when the cops find this,

2073
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:35,230
obviously the Bombay didn't work because
they killed that,

2074
01:47:35,231 --> 01:47:37,860
got to ernest tico and killed them.
But on the other hand,

2075
01:47:38,190 --> 01:47:39,023
when the cops found this tape,
it was like Ernestine covas speaking 

2076
01:47:42,511 --> 01:47:43,344
from the dead and fingering his,
the people who killed him and they were 

2077
01:47:47,401 --> 01:47:50,790
able to use that as evidence.
They knew exactly who killed him because

2078
01:47:50,791 --> 01:47:53,580
of that tape conversation with

2079
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:54,081
Blah,
blah,

2080
01:47:54,081 --> 01:47:54,914
blah.
So how the fuck do I fit in the Santa 

2081
01:47:56,721 --> 01:47:57,554
Maria?
What do you on a couple of years ago I 

2082
01:48:00,930 --> 01:48:01,763
had to read some guy told me that you 
have a couple of strong above a lot of 

2083
01:48:05,511 --> 01:48:07,810
people in your life and that's 
definitely you.

2084
01:48:07,830 --> 01:48:12,830
You're older and wiser guy.
You're not violent or very controlled.

2085
01:48:13,671 --> 01:48:17,300
You're a lot more controlled than I am,
which is more of A.

2086
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:20,920
I lean towards the jungle phase.
My,

2087
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:26,260
my main thing is a Jago now yoga,
when I was younger by the law,

2088
01:48:26,330 --> 01:48:27,163
he's the one that took a sword and wipe 
it on his chest with red and they asked 

2089
01:48:31,321 --> 01:48:32,690
them why,
uh,

2090
01:48:32,750 --> 01:48:34,310
did he liked to kill him?
He said,

2091
01:48:34,311 --> 01:48:38,660
because blood makes change.
Something stupid.

2092
01:48:38,661 --> 01:48:41,300
He really has,
but I don't practice that.

2093
01:48:41,450 --> 01:48:43,790
I don't.
My brother was very calm,

2094
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,850
but one,
one guy goes,

2095
01:48:45,930 --> 01:48:47,840
Caesar,
he's a bad ass.

2096
01:48:47,841 --> 01:48:50,510
Motherfucker hit mentioned,
didn't mention your name,

2097
01:48:51,410 --> 01:48:53,090
didn't need that.
Don't need to mention that.

2098
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,823
Once they tell me,
I already know what they're talking 

2099
01:48:56,391 --> 01:48:57,224
about,
I already know what they're talking 

2100
01:48:58,911 --> 01:49:01,190
about.
So I still go get readings.

2101
01:49:01,191 --> 01:49:03,430
Like when I go to Miami,
next time I go to my godmother.

2102
01:49:03,530 --> 01:49:04,640
See,
this is the reason.

2103
01:49:04,641 --> 01:49:05,920
One thing I might ask,
I still

2104
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,990
follow it.
This is the reason I still follow.

2105
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,270
You were asking me why,
why I would still follow it.

2106
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:14,710
It's because once you get to an 
understanding of the idea that there are

2107
01:49:14,711 --> 01:49:19,711
certain spirits within you and the 
Orishas represent different spirits,

2108
01:49:20,680 --> 01:49:23,470
once you understand that that's not 
something you throw away.

2109
01:49:23,471 --> 01:49:25,540
Even if you don't follow the religion 
anymore,

2110
01:49:25,541 --> 01:49:27,880
you still,
you still have belief in that.

2111
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,020
He's still believe in that.
So my Orisha is Elegua.

2112
01:49:32,050 --> 01:49:35,140
Elegua is the saint e's.
A trickster.

2113
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:36,063
Elegua is a trickster,
plays little tricks and also the saint 

2114
01:49:39,281 --> 01:49:40,114
of passages.
So people put elegua above their door 

2115
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:43,623
because you're passing from one room 
into another room and so you identify 

2116
01:49:47,440 --> 01:49:48,220
that spirit

2117
01:49:48,220 --> 01:49:51,670
and that becomes part of your identity.
You can whistle in the house.

2118
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:55,030
Why?
Why you can't whistle in the house?

2119
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:55,740
Yeah,
I don't listen.

2120
01:49:55,740 --> 01:49:58,720
You can go in the house because he'll 
leave.

2121
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:03,820
So you can't fuck them whistling.
Can't whistle.

2122
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:05,260
No.
Wow.

2123
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:07,210
When I was a kid,
I'd sit at the table and do.

2124
01:50:07,730 --> 01:50:08,381
Yeah,
you can't wait.

2125
01:50:08,381 --> 01:50:09,214
So my mom was go touch that fucking 
table is gonna wake your fucking head 

2126
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:18,550
because God lives on the table now.
Joe.

2127
01:50:18,940 --> 01:50:19,773
I grew up in it.
They made st to me like the one when I 

2128
01:50:23,381 --> 01:50:26,830
made St Louis in November and they ended
up in the Bronx River,

2129
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:27,933
so they had to break the ice and they 
were dark skinned Cubans and I'll never 

2130
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:31,774
forget that.
They rip your clothes off and then they 

2131
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:36,340
take whatever you're saying.
They hit you with the number of water,

2132
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:37,753
so if you're st is five,
you get hit with five things with water 

2133
01:50:40,450 --> 01:50:41,283
and they dry you out,
you're freezing and when I saw them 

2134
01:50:43,421 --> 01:50:45,580
ripping my mother's clothes on,
I was about five.

2135
01:50:45,580 --> 01:50:46,540
I'm like,
fuck you.

2136
01:50:46,541 --> 01:50:50,050
Black motherfuckers started running down
Bronx Boulevard.

2137
01:50:50,140 --> 01:50:53,290
They had to chase me and bring me back.
I didn't want to do it.

2138
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:57,220
It's an all night ceremony night on a 
Friday.

2139
01:50:57,360 --> 01:50:58,193
It was crazy all night.
Twelve hours long sleep and then Sunday 

2140
01:51:02,651 --> 01:51:03,484
is when they read your future to you and
then for a week you just live in a 

2141
01:51:06,371 --> 01:51:07,320
corner.
White.

2142
01:51:07,650 --> 01:51:09,280
They paint your head,
you're bald.

2143
01:51:09,600 --> 01:51:12,310
I had to go back to school on Monday,
bald with a hat.

2144
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:14,340
They said he's not allowed in here with 
a hat.

2145
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:18,340
My mother gave the principals small 
nickel and I was allowed to wear the hat

2146
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:19,174
from nine to three,
but then at 3:00 I had to go home and 

2147
01:51:20,801 --> 01:51:24,310
change into white clothes for a year,
not allowing for a year.

2148
01:51:24,530 --> 01:51:25,363
I had to dress in white now year,
so for my calls I would just have to 

2149
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:34,210
wear white socks and white tee shirts 
because I was a kid.

2150
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:36,150
I can't keep wearing fucking white every
damn.

2151
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:39,850
I'm ripping shit right so that your hair
has to grow back.

2152
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:40,713
So when I walk into,
I know there's a ton of Santa Maria and 

2153
01:51:43,361 --> 01:51:46,420
La Really,
I don't deal with it at all because it's

2154
01:51:46,421 --> 01:51:48,850
all the same thing.
Like everything else in their life.

2155
01:51:49,390 --> 01:51:53,650
It's a bunch of white people didn't grow
up in it and there's a hot black guy and

2156
01:51:53,651 --> 01:51:56,770
they want to really just suck his dick 
and he's talking about spirits.

2157
01:51:57,200 --> 01:51:59,840
Saw a video today.
I saw a video.

2158
01:51:59,870 --> 01:52:00,870
I'm like,
shame on them.

2159
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:02,073
It's all confused.
It's like those white chicks that 

2160
01:52:04,001 --> 01:52:05,020
sucked.
That Hindu Dick,

2161
01:52:05,021 --> 01:52:05,854
when they go to hot yoga,
that guy that's got a bit grumpy is a 

2162
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:12,060
pig.
You've got is a bunch of white chicks or

2163
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:17,190
hummus flavor in there from something 
that he gets to me inside you.

2164
01:52:19,231 --> 01:52:23,080
You suck that fucking.
That smells like hummus chips,

2165
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:26,330
you know,
and that's what it is in La.

2166
01:52:26,350 --> 01:52:28,030
Like I've been invited to two parties.

2167
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:30,130
First Time I went,
you know who's in there?

2168
01:52:30,190 --> 01:52:35,190
Who fucking the dude from that played in
the Yummy forest?

2169
01:52:37,590 --> 01:52:39,350
Forest,
Whitaker Santa Real.

2170
01:52:39,620 --> 01:52:44,620
Is He really the chick that won Miss 
America for eating pussy from behind the

2171
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:48,360
scenes in the Santa Maria.
Maria.

2172
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:53,120
Oh Vanessa,
my Santa Ria.

2173
01:52:53,660 --> 01:52:57,440
I grew up in a Cuban Santa Ria.
You shut your fucking mouth because it's

2174
01:52:57,890 --> 01:52:59,880
not cute.
Is it Mexican influence?

2175
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:04,010
This is why they're just like,
oh my God,

2176
01:53:05,530 --> 01:53:07,580
look at that.
Look at forest.

2177
01:53:07,610 --> 01:53:12,610
It's very watered down.
And look at the guy from forest whitaker

2178
01:53:12,741 --> 01:53:13,574
dressed up like fucking monks do pop a 
plate that I came up under the very 

2179
01:53:20,901 --> 01:53:22,430
strict.
Shut your mouth.

2180
01:53:22,790 --> 01:53:27,790
Nobody needs to know you fucking 
business to fill a role.

2181
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:31,190
It was his step and this is what it is 
here.

2182
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:34,550
It's more of a of a,
you know,

2183
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:35,743
like whenever at the guy that I,
the guy that gives me the reeds is 

2184
01:53:39,291 --> 01:53:40,124
tremendous.

2185
01:53:40,580 --> 01:53:44,180
I'm going to tell you this man to man.
Tremendous.

2186
01:53:44,420 --> 01:53:47,230
Really tremendous.
I even took Duncan tool.

2187
01:53:47,300 --> 01:53:49,110
Tremendous.
You took Duncan,

2188
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,173
does she?
We had him on the podcast and 

2189
01:53:52,071 --> 01:53:55,550
everything.
The problem with him is I don't like his

2190
01:53:55,820 --> 01:53:58,940
people around him.
He has too many people that don't know.

2191
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:02,560
When I joined this I knew what I was 
getting myself into.

2192
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:03,860
Right.
You know what I'm saying?

2193
01:54:03,861 --> 01:54:05,390
Like I knew,
I knew I liked it.

2194
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:08,580
I had nothing to do with my mother.
I was to do with my godmother and I.

2195
01:54:08,590 --> 01:54:11,480
and it was my relationship with her.
In fact,

2196
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:16,130
my mother couldn't even say shit to me 
in front of my godmother when,

2197
01:54:16,131 --> 01:54:18,770
when an 85 I,
I might,

2198
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:19,663
when I moved in with the vendors,
I couldn't bring my Santa Ria shit with 

2199
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:24,190
them.
They're fucking aliens.

2200
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:26,810
So I left it with this gay guy named 
Martin.

2201
01:54:26,810 --> 01:54:30,560
The fact my thing money go.
You sold coke at night.

2202
01:54:30,820 --> 01:54:31,653
He was,
uh,

2203
01:54:31,790 --> 01:54:32,461
he was,
uh,

2204
01:54:32,461 --> 01:54:35,780
a seamstress in the daytime for a big 
New York play,

2205
01:54:36,210 --> 01:54:37,043
but when I was a kid,
he would go to cbgbs every night and so 

2206
01:54:38,631 --> 01:54:42,460
coke use all these fags walking around 
and Felicia give thanks to Martin.

2207
01:54:43,220 --> 01:54:46,520
He was getting his teeth knocked out and
black eyes back in the seventies because

2208
01:54:46,521 --> 01:54:48,390
he was gay.
But I liked one.

2209
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:53,190
I ended up my,
I left my St Martin and then years later

2210
01:54:53,191 --> 01:54:56,690
they ended up Robin Martin,
my cocaine fucking hell.

2211
01:54:57,140 --> 01:55:00,260
So my godmother asked me in 1,985,
whereas you're saying,

2212
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:02,570
so I go there at Martin's house.
She goes,

2213
01:55:02,571 --> 01:55:04,340
you know,
you're not supposed to have.

2214
01:55:04,341 --> 01:55:07,640
You're saying to the gay man's house.
I'll go get him.

2215
01:55:07,730 --> 01:55:10,520
Listen to me.
I never saw my godmother going have 95.

2216
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:14,330
I did A.
I talked to Duncan about Santa Maria and

2217
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:15,164
some company approached me from London 
and I did the Santa Ria podcasts and I 

2218
01:55:18,981 --> 01:55:20,270
got an email on twitter.

2219
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:22,270
We know who has you,
saints.

2220
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:26,990
They're in Miami.
Thirty four years later I flew to Miami.

2221
01:55:27,410 --> 01:55:29,980
I got my son to get him.
I flew together,

2222
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:31,063
shifting back,
you know how my godmother got him to 

2223
01:55:32,871 --> 01:55:35,480
Miami out on a bus.
Whoa.

2224
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:40,010
So six cases on a bus with all your 
future and your stuff.

2225
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:43,250
I got my notebook.
If you look at my notebook,

2226
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:45,720
I bring my notebook next time.
And you reading your go.

2227
01:55:46,340 --> 01:55:50,260
Joe Knew Shit.
These motherfuckers really?

2228
01:55:50,340 --> 01:55:51,240
Oh yeah.
So you,

2229
01:55:51,241 --> 01:55:51,900
you,
you,

2230
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:56,900
you believe there's something to it.
I till the age of 11,

2231
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:00,660
I thought there were a bunch of Hocus 
pocus motherfuckers,

2232
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:05,010
but there was a lady on 20,
sixth and central and I grew up with her

2233
01:56:05,011 --> 01:56:05,844
kids.
Her husband was that big book in on an 

2234
01:56:07,351 --> 01:56:08,184
Eighteenth Street and once a month she 
passed the spirit and people would go 

2235
01:56:11,671 --> 01:56:12,504
there.
10 people who were invited and I could 

2236
01:56:15,811 --> 01:56:18,180
tell this cop was eating away at my 
mother.

2237
01:56:18,330 --> 01:56:20,520
First of all,
my mother didn't lay down for nobody.

2238
01:56:20,550 --> 01:56:22,590
My mother was going to shoot that 
motherfucker herself.

2239
01:56:23,430 --> 01:56:25,140
She'd,
if she was that type of Cuban woman.

2240
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:28,500
She didn't like being spoken to that way
I could see it in their face.

2241
01:56:28,501 --> 01:56:33,030
It was eating him alive and one night we
went over to this way or these party.

2242
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:36,720
The first time I saw the lady drink a 
bottle of fire water,

2243
01:56:36,721 --> 01:56:37,554
you know,
that hundred and 40 proof Agua dam 

2244
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:41,190
thing.
So I thought,

2245
01:56:41,191 --> 01:56:43,350
this is bullshit.
This is bullshit.

2246
01:56:43,351 --> 01:56:46,500
This is she MCS that bottle out in the 
daytime.

2247
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:47,843
So at night I would watch her bottles 
and they had the label like they were 

2248
01:56:50,251 --> 01:56:54,440
sealed because I had my mother had a bar
so I knew if they were sealed in a pro,

2249
01:56:54,470 --> 01:56:59,470
just women would pass the spirit and 
then tell you what to do and what not to

2250
01:56:59,581 --> 01:57:00,360
do.

2251
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:03,050
On this particular night,
she went up to my mother.

2252
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,530
She goes,
I know what's bothering you.

2253
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,210
And she took a white dish,
took a white dish.

2254
01:57:09,211 --> 01:57:13,770
That was just the way she took a candle 
and she turned it over and she went like

2255
01:57:13,771 --> 01:57:16,080
this,
this circular motion on the camera.

2256
01:57:16,110 --> 01:57:21,110
I was 10 or 11 Joe Rogan at that time 
that I believe I don't believe in Dick.

2257
01:57:22,140 --> 01:57:24,450
I didn't believe in Dick.
I didn't believe in Jesus.

2258
01:57:24,451 --> 01:57:26,210
I don't give a fuck.
It's a story they tell you.

2259
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,863
She flipped over the dish and it was a 
circle with a guy that looked like a 

2260
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:33,330
beer and she goes,
this was bothering you.

2261
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,250
And my mother goes,
yeah.

2262
01:57:35,251 --> 01:57:37,980
She goes,
and she broke the dishes.

2263
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:39,240
She goes,
seven days,

2264
01:57:39,241 --> 01:57:40,530
they will never bother you again.

2265
01:57:42,690 --> 01:57:44,820
Four days later,
go look it up.

2266
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:45,683
Nikki Gerardo was his name.
They shot them a thousand fucking times 

2267
01:57:48,781 --> 01:57:51,810
at a place called Rapido taxi.
It was a front.

2268
01:57:51,811 --> 01:57:55,770
There was a taxi thing that was a front 
for a cocaine.

2269
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,930
They deliver cocaine.
Ropey don't means quick.

2270
01:57:58,580 --> 01:58:01,500
They never had a customer that caps.
He wants to make a collection.

2271
01:58:01,980 --> 01:58:03,950
They were waiting for the one you told 
me about you,

2272
01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:07,080
Geraldo.
They said they got the witness wasn't no

2273
01:58:07,081 --> 01:58:09,080
witness was the union city cops who 
shot.

2274
01:58:09,500 --> 01:58:10,890
Wow.
Because he went by.

2275
01:58:10,891 --> 01:58:11,724
It's like if and you have partners and 
also that come around and start 

2276
01:58:14,731 --> 01:58:18,210
collecting from jail.
That's how corrupt the system.

2277
01:58:18,211 --> 01:58:20,490
And in the papers they said he died to 
hear all that.

2278
01:58:20,491 --> 01:58:23,460
He was shot by a street criminal and he 
was given her heroes.

2279
01:58:23,490 --> 01:58:25,320
Perio.
No.

2280
01:58:25,460 --> 01:58:28,630
And Joey says he was shot by other.
No,

2281
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:30,710
they know.
They always knew the city.

2282
01:58:30,730 --> 01:58:31,563
Was that dirty?
Did you hear this when you were doing 

2283
01:58:32,791 --> 01:58:33,541
your research?
No,

2284
01:58:33,541 --> 01:58:34,374
I didn't.
When I told him that he told me and I 

2285
01:58:36,601 --> 01:58:39,630
did some research on it,
found out that the guy,

2286
01:58:40,170 --> 01:58:41,980
I read the public account of

2287
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:43,690
what happened and it was quite different
than what,

2288
01:58:44,020 --> 01:58:44,853
how joey describes it.
That was the cops and Charlotte because 

2289
01:58:48,160 --> 01:58:48,993
he's taken.
And that's what I was saying before 

2290
01:58:50,091 --> 01:58:50,924
about the what the story we see on the 
surface and then the real story 

2291
01:58:54,561 --> 01:58:55,540
underneath.
See,

2292
01:58:55,550 --> 01:58:58,640
I know all those stores don't like the 
after that,

2293
01:58:58,641 --> 01:58:59,474
the political system.
And in his book he has a section where 

2294
01:59:03,501 --> 01:59:04,334
you actually see battle go to the police
station and to make payoffs like that's 

2295
01:59:11,571 --> 01:59:13,430
how easy it was.
You know,

2296
01:59:13,431 --> 01:59:15,820
battle got arrested in north Bergen in 
my hometown.

2297
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:18,200
So I called one of my friends.
I go do some research on it.

2298
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:20,630
They said they never even put the cops 
on him.

2299
01:59:23,050 --> 01:59:24,670
He owned the town.
He owned the town,

2300
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:28,480
the mayor and the police chief.
And if you all you need to say they both

2301
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:31,990
went to prison eventually for taking 
money from the gambling.

2302
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:32,883
From.
Yeah.

2303
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:35,950
No Mayor Jamie,
when you got a minute.

2304
01:59:36,370 --> 01:59:41,050
No Man has ever left Hudson county.
If it's not through prison,

2305
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:42,880
the whole,
the male,

2306
01:59:42,881 --> 01:59:45,790
the fact Guinea,
he died because it was 800 pounds.

2307
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:48,000
Every other man ends up in jail.
My.

2308
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:53,710
The fact that Mary Union city is up for 
corruption charges as we speak.

2309
01:59:53,711 --> 01:59:56,110
And this is what,
30 years later I read that.

2310
01:59:56,340 --> 01:59:59,110
I read that recently.
It's never stopped Joe Rogan.

2311
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:04,090
It's never ever stopped.
That's why when people tell me stories,

2312
02:00:04,091 --> 02:00:04,924
I wipe my ass.
And also this is when you say organized 

2313
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:10,480
crime is diminished while we're talking 
about organized crime,

2314
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:11,860
right?
It's still there.

2315
02:00:11,890 --> 02:00:16,530
It's deeply rooted in the system in 
certain jurisdictions and it's not going

2316
02:00:16,531 --> 02:00:17,364
to change.

2317
02:00:17,410 --> 02:00:21,790
It's just crazy to me that you got so 
deeply entrenched reading the story that

2318
02:00:21,791 --> 02:00:22,624
you started getting into Santa Maria.
I was actually until I was married to a 

2319
02:00:26,291 --> 02:00:30,320
Brazilian for 10 years.
So they have a center.

2320
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:32,910
It's called my coma.
And what's different about their.

2321
02:00:33,050 --> 02:00:36,150
It's almost exactly the same and they 
have all the same saints.

2322
02:00:36,190 --> 02:00:37,023
It's the same thing.
Same thing because the slave trade came 

2323
02:00:38,591 --> 02:00:40,150
through Brazil,
Africa,

2324
02:00:40,330 --> 02:00:42,790
Catholicism mixing.
They,

2325
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:45,940
they just.
The music is different with the Cubans.

2326
02:00:45,941 --> 02:00:46,774
It's a Roomba.
All this wonderful room by music that 

2327
02:00:49,001 --> 02:00:49,834
you hear.
There's a whole bunch of great music 

2328
02:00:52,211 --> 02:00:53,044
that grows up around it.
So you were married to a Brazilian 

2329
02:00:54,641 --> 02:00:55,474
woman.
You get divorced to keep the religion 

2330
02:00:58,160 --> 02:01:00,160
because that would happen.
Uh,

2331
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:01,410
yeah.
I,

2332
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,273
I was.
I can't go to places like Cuba and 

2333
02:01:04,691 --> 02:01:08,620
Brazil because I get so influenced and 
overwhelmed by it.

2334
02:01:08,621 --> 02:01:13,330
It changes the direction my life really.
I went to Brazil for the first full day.

2335
02:01:13,331 --> 02:01:14,164
I was in Brazil.
I fell in love with the woman that I 

2336
02:01:16,871 --> 02:01:18,940
married and lived with for the next 10 
years.

2337
02:01:19,150 --> 02:01:21,570
Wow.
When I go to Cuba,

2338
02:01:21,970 --> 02:01:26,920
it's dangerous to me because I'm so 
seduced by it.

2339
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:31,540
I'm so intoxicated by Havana.
By Cuban culture.

2340
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:32,553
What is it?

2341
02:01:34,450 --> 02:01:35,350
Well,
first of all,

2342
02:01:35,351 --> 02:01:36,184
it's the most sensual place you have.
Van is the most sensual place I've ever 

2343
02:01:40,581 --> 02:01:42,290
been.
Everyone flirts.

2344
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:45,050
The women flirt.
Doesn't matter if they're married or not

2345
02:01:45,051 --> 02:01:46,130
married.
They flirt with you.

2346
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:51,131
I suppose guys flirt to everyone flirts.
There's like sexual energy everywhere.

2347
02:01:52,850 --> 02:01:57,850
The Sky in the and the climate is just 
kind of sold tree in and sensual.

2348
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:02,090
The music is.
Makes your body move.

2349
02:02:02,230 --> 02:02:05,800
Joe,
would you let me play a video for you to

2350
02:02:05,801 --> 02:02:08,770
show you some of the dancing and Cuba?
Sure.

2351
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:12,430
When women dancing Cuba,
they cover their pussy

2352
02:02:14,390 --> 02:02:19,390
because what I'm trying to do,
the whole dance is me baiting you.

2353
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:24,500
It's the prettiest things you've ever 
seen in your life.

2354
02:02:24,530 --> 02:02:27,260
It's me coming up to you with this 
movement.

2355
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:30,800
Like when I played it like ul,
I was getting nowhere with Joelle.

2356
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:36,170
I was way before the podcast.
He was tightening up so I had a play.

2357
02:02:36,171 --> 02:02:37,004
They'll papinas my size and once he 
heard that I could see Nigeria coming 

2358
02:02:42,951 --> 02:02:43,784
alive.
He even got up and kicked his leg one 

2359
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:46,784
time,
which meant we're on because it's so 

2360
02:02:48,741 --> 02:02:51,650
embedded in your culture,
but in Cuban dancing,

2361
02:02:51,651 --> 02:02:52,484
I'm coming up to you.
Every time I come up and I'll go like 

2362
02:02:55,371 --> 02:02:56,480
this,
and you go like this.

2363
02:02:56,640 --> 02:02:58,460
Yeah,
you got to come and put your ass,

2364
02:02:58,461 --> 02:02:59,294
but the whole time you'll be covering 
your pussy because on the exchange I go 

2365
02:03:02,511 --> 02:03:03,440
to grab your pussy.

2366
02:03:06,190 --> 02:03:10,570
Harvey Weinstein would do phenomenal.
Here's how serious I take it.

2367
02:03:10,571 --> 02:03:11,800
By the way,
what is this?

2368
02:03:11,890 --> 02:03:12,390
Oh,
I,

2369
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:15,700
I love.
I love Afro Cuban music or Latin Jazz,

2370
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:17,013
so I'm hosting,
I'm curating and hosting a Latin jazz 

2371
02:03:19,361 --> 02:03:23,110
series in New York at a bar called sync 
every Thursday night,

2372
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:26,760
Tj English and his Latin jazz 
explosions.

2373
02:03:26,761 --> 02:03:30,040
So I get to choose the music,
the musicians who performed there,

2374
02:03:30,041 --> 02:03:32,830
and I and I host the evening.
Wow.

2375
02:03:32,831 --> 02:03:34,320
You do this every week?
Yeah.

2376
02:03:34,370 --> 02:03:37,690
What we're going to try to just keep.
Keep it going indefinitely.

2377
02:03:37,960 --> 02:03:38,793
That's phenomenal.
So this to you was a natural subject to 

2378
02:03:42,670 --> 02:03:45,460
sort of engross yourself?
Well,

2379
02:03:45,461 --> 02:03:46,294
I had written,
I had published the book Havana 

2380
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:48,753
Nocturne,
which was about the mob in Cuba in the 

2381
02:03:49,781 --> 02:03:50,614
fifties and I really got into it.
Then I made numerous trips to savannah 

2382
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:59,620
for extended periods.
So this book was almost like a sequel to

2383
02:03:59,621 --> 02:03:59,830
that.

2384
02:03:59,830 --> 02:04:00,663
Yeah,
it was a nice way to revisit that 

2385
02:04:01,991 --> 02:04:06,380
culture.
Pick up the thread of that story because

2386
02:04:06,430 --> 02:04:10,330
this one is sort of an answer.
You get to the end and a Havana nocturne

2387
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:12,430
and you ask yourself,
so then what happened?

2388
02:04:12,431 --> 02:04:14,710
What happened after the mafia got chased
out of Cuba?

2389
02:04:15,100 --> 02:04:17,550
What was their response?
How did they take it?

2390
02:04:17,620 --> 02:04:19,740
I want to show you this.
The Cuban dancing.

2391
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,230
What does it say?
What's the name of the watch?

2392
02:04:26,231 --> 02:04:29,110
To see how everything is.
Look,

2393
02:04:29,111 --> 02:04:31,780
look at this.
Uh,

2394
02:04:33,710 --> 02:04:35,240
yeah.
Just keeps buzzing.

2395
02:04:35,290 --> 02:04:37,950
So it was always about navy.

2396
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:40,980
Watch him move.
So talking about genes,

2397
02:04:41,220 --> 02:04:44,910
about what was it with your health.
See he went to grab a pussy.

2398
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:47,340
So the dance,
a seduction,

2399
02:04:47,550 --> 02:04:49,360
seduction,
they're both there.

2400
02:04:49,570 --> 02:04:54,570
They're engaged in a mutual seduction.
This is a crazy dance.

2401
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:58,160
Jamie,
what's the name of this?

2402
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,410
Show it to me.
Grandma.

2403
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:06,750
Say that co is the rhythm is the real 
you a whole lot more.

2404
02:05:11,550 --> 02:05:16,550
And Ketos Ketos,
m u n e Q,

2405
02:05:16,971 --> 02:05:21,670
u I t o s d,
my times up times.

2406
02:05:21,680 --> 02:05:23,830
This is the province that.
Wow.

2407
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:26,330
Watch how she grabs a pussy.
Every time he comes close

2408
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:31,410
now that mute,
grab it,

2409
02:05:32,460 --> 02:05:33,870
grab it.
And she blocked it.

2410
02:05:33,900 --> 02:05:35,370
Oh yeah,
they don't fuck around.

2411
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:36,233
That's hilarious.
So the drumming you're hearing and the 

2412
02:05:38,821 --> 02:05:39,654
use of what's called the Shaker Array,
that Gord there and the chanting that's 

2413
02:05:42,511 --> 02:05:43,344
going on that you would all,
you would hear all that in Santeria 

2414
02:05:45,930 --> 02:05:47,370
ceremony.
Wow.

2415
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:50,400
This grabbing the pussy shit is 
hilarious.

2416
02:05:50,500 --> 02:05:51,930
Hilarious.
Hilarious.

2417
02:05:52,740 --> 02:05:53,573
Yeah.
He kept trying to grab his junk to 

2418
02:05:54,991 --> 02:05:56,370
occasionally,
occasionally.

2419
02:05:56,371 --> 02:05:58,650
But he's probably just checking how are 
we doing down there?

2420
02:05:59,170 --> 02:06:00,003
See like he's grabbing it.
He's like squeezing it to see if it's 

2421
02:06:01,611 --> 02:06:02,790
hard to say.
He's just playing with it.

2422
02:06:03,090 --> 02:06:05,070
He just threatened the grab and she 
grabbed it.

2423
02:06:05,790 --> 02:06:08,550
That's hilarious.
So it's very playful.

2424
02:06:08,850 --> 02:06:11,670
Flirtatious.
And this is the culture there.

2425
02:06:11,671 --> 02:06:12,720
That's Cuba.
You know,

2426
02:06:12,721 --> 02:06:13,554
it's funny.

2427
02:06:13,630 --> 02:06:14,463
And Five.
I lived in a building in Fort Lee and 

2428
02:06:16,661 --> 02:06:21,661
there was a Panamanian woman and she 
told me that she went to Cuba twice as a

2429
02:06:21,671 --> 02:06:24,940
young girl and she wasn't surprised what
was going on in Cuba.

2430
02:06:24,941 --> 02:06:27,880
That was God's punishment.
She goes,

2431
02:06:27,881 --> 02:06:32,881
it was such a disgusting fucking place.
And then it was weird.

2432
02:06:34,010 --> 02:06:36,990
Couple of days after I'm talking to Tj,
a,

2433
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:38,023
somebody on facebook.
I did a joke for my CSO special about 

2434
02:06:40,541 --> 02:06:43,110
club 38.
The owner name was Willie Vandy,

2435
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:44,553
and his claim to fame was that his 
grandfather had the biggest dick in 

2436
02:06:46,931 --> 02:06:47,764
Cuba.
I grew up with two kids that her claim 

2437
02:06:49,821 --> 02:06:50,860
to fame.
One of them,

2438
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:55,360
his dad was the best pool player in Cuba
and Americans will go down and he'd beat

2439
02:06:55,361 --> 02:06:56,194
the fuck out of him and pull you play.
They played Chicago eight ball whenever 

2440
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:01,660
Chicago.
The other.

2441
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:05,560
His claim to fame was that his 
grandfather was the guy in godfather two

2442
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:07,053
who had the big Dick and they called him
superman and on Saturday nights at club 

2443
02:07:11,531 --> 02:07:14,920
38 in union city.
He would on Saturdays,

2444
02:07:14,921 --> 02:07:19,921
he recreated and he had people come down
and it'd be like a comedy show.

2445
02:07:20,260 --> 02:07:21,093
$10 ticket in 200 people.
He would get some out chick tire up to 

2446
02:07:25,271 --> 02:07:28,980
Cubans like that would play the congas 
and he come out and fuck the lady and

2447
02:07:30,050 --> 02:07:35,050
go crazy with the biggest dick in the 
world and my job fucker in public.

2448
02:07:35,351 --> 02:07:36,530
That was the whole thing.
I was like,

2449
02:07:36,970 --> 02:07:37,450
fuck,
show.

2450
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:38,283
That was a public fuck show.
But it went all the way back to Cuba to 

2451
02:07:41,531 --> 02:07:46,010
like 55,
like the name of the place was Shanghai,

2452
02:07:46,160 --> 02:07:50,950
the Shanghai Theater,
and the Godfather to Michael takes.

2453
02:07:50,951 --> 02:07:52,930
They take Michael there and all of a 
sudden he goes,

2454
02:07:52,931 --> 02:07:55,990
I would have never found this place if 
it wasn't for Johnny Ola.

2455
02:07:55,991 --> 02:07:59,320
And that's when Michael finds out that 
he betrayed them.

2456
02:07:59,321 --> 02:08:01,570
So they don't show the guys that have 
been simpler.

2457
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:02,493
If the guy with the big Dick was also 
the greatest pool player because he 

2458
02:08:05,201 --> 02:08:06,330
could just,
Oh my God,

2459
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:10,690
that would have been perfect.
So they did this article about two weeks

2460
02:08:10,691 --> 02:08:11,524
ago.
It's on my facebook and it's called in 

2461
02:08:12,851 --> 02:08:13,684
search of Superman Joe Rogan.
It was the most disgusting article 

2462
02:08:18,020 --> 02:08:18,853
rather than my life that these white 
dudes went on a 50 year looking for 

2463
02:08:23,381 --> 02:08:24,170
superman.

2464
02:08:24,170 --> 02:08:26,020
The legend of the guy with the big 
thick.

2465
02:08:26,440 --> 02:08:28,420
In fact,
do vow went to Cuba,

2466
02:08:29,050 --> 02:08:31,570
to the location,
even though it's closed,

2467
02:08:32,080 --> 02:08:32,913
just to see where it was and what the 
story is that us as Americans will go 

2468
02:08:36,801 --> 02:08:37,634
down to every week.
And that was our first time to see this 

2469
02:08:40,511 --> 02:08:41,344
big black Cuban dude.
Fuck the shit out of some poor white 

2470
02:08:43,751 --> 02:08:44,590
chick,
you know,

2471
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:48,400
yelled and screamed.
The place was sold out every night.

2472
02:08:48,401 --> 02:08:49,870
I mean,
the guy was a gardener.

2473
02:08:50,110 --> 02:08:52,600
The article is sensational if you could 
find it.

2474
02:08:53,020 --> 02:08:58,020
It's called in search of Superman and 
they is it better than superman.

2475
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:03,100
But when it came out the same week that 
they said,

2476
02:09:03,240 --> 02:09:05,020
what are you fucking crazy.
They ain't no fake.

2477
02:09:05,320 --> 02:09:07,210
That's real.
That's why they call him superman.

2478
02:09:07,211 --> 02:09:08,690
Afraid of the know.
I saw.

2479
02:09:08,710 --> 02:09:13,120
I saw a video of Superman when I was 
researching Havana Nocturne.

2480
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:14,433
Uh,
I found out that Santo traffic content 

2481
02:09:17,501 --> 02:09:20,530
had a lawyer named Samara Ghana since 
deceased.

2482
02:09:21,090 --> 02:09:21,923
But Samara,
Ghana used to take a lot of super eight 

2483
02:09:23,351 --> 02:09:26,260
videos when he'd go down to Cuba.
His son,

2484
02:09:26,290 --> 02:09:27,123
who's currently a lawyer in Tampa told 
me that he had super eight footage of 

2485
02:09:31,960 --> 02:09:34,780
superman that his father had made in the
fifties,

2486
02:09:35,140 --> 02:09:38,890
superman at a private sex show.
Fucking a girl.

2487
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:40,030
And I said,
oh,

2488
02:09:40,210 --> 02:09:41,710
I got to see that.
Could I see that?

2489
02:09:41,770 --> 02:09:42,603
I mean,
I think that's the only existing video 

2490
02:09:44,501 --> 02:09:47,080
footage anywhere of Superman and he 
said,

2491
02:09:47,081 --> 02:09:48,730
yeah,
but I'm not going to give it up.

2492
02:09:48,731 --> 02:09:51,520
You've got to come to Tampa and I'll 
show it for you.

2493
02:09:51,820 --> 02:09:54,280
So I go down there.
I'll never forget.

2494
02:09:54,281 --> 02:09:55,114
He's a lawyer too.
He says you got to come at 6:00 after 

2495
02:09:56,801 --> 02:09:57,634
the.
After the office closes so then we can 

2496
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:03,730
watch it and I get there and the 
cleaning lady is still there,

2497
02:10:03,910 --> 02:10:06,600
so he brings me into the conference room
where he's going to show me the family.

2498
02:10:06,640 --> 02:10:07,473
We got to sit there and wait until the 
cleaning lady's done because he didn't 

2499
02:10:09,971 --> 02:10:12,970
want to put this film all the while.
The cleaning ladies in the room,

2500
02:10:13,570 --> 02:10:14,403
so he puts it on the plate.
Stuff is completely empty and he shows 

2501
02:10:18,431 --> 02:10:19,264
me this footage and his father had 
scored it to like Wagner or beethoven 

2502
02:10:24,221 --> 02:10:26,980
like triumph and classical music and 
it's.

2503
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,620
It's at a private show.
It's in somebody's home.

2504
02:10:30,010 --> 02:10:30,843
They had private sex salons in Havana 
where you'd go to like some rich 

2505
02:10:33,171 --> 02:10:34,040
person's house.

2506
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,400
You'd pay some money,
you had cocktails,

2507
02:10:37,550 --> 02:10:38,383
and then someone had clap at a certain 
time and you knew that was time for the 

2508
02:10:40,371 --> 02:10:45,260
show and everyone would sit down and 
superman would come out and he,

2509
02:10:45,290 --> 02:10:46,310
he,
he fucked this,

2510
02:10:46,311 --> 02:10:49,670
a Cuban woman who was,
who was small,

2511
02:10:49,671 --> 02:10:50,504
he was begging,
she was small and he's banging her from 

2512
02:10:52,881 --> 02:10:53,714
every conceivable angle.
It was the least sexy thing you've ever 

2513
02:10:57,321 --> 02:10:58,490
seen in your life.
I mean,

2514
02:10:58,491 --> 02:10:59,324
it looked like a,
it looked like some kind of torture 

2515
02:11:02,130 --> 02:11:03,640
really.
Uh,

2516
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:06,110
and that was it.
And this guy had this footage,

2517
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:10,160
which is probably worth a lot of money.
Big was the Dick.

2518
02:11:10,240 --> 02:11:11,360
The Dick was big.

2519
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:15,230
It wasn't.
No,

2520
02:11:15,231 --> 02:11:18,860
I say that because it wasn't like,
it wasn't a,

2521
02:11:18,980 --> 02:11:21,470
I'm not sure it was even the biggest 
stick I've ever seen.

2522
02:11:21,770 --> 02:11:23,140
I mean,
it was bigger than my dad's.

2523
02:11:23,160 --> 02:11:25,820
Bigger than normal.
It was bigger than the guys today.

2524
02:11:25,821 --> 02:11:30,470
It's almost like athletes,
like if you go back and look at when Jim

2525
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:32,180
Brown was playing football,
he was very impressive.

2526
02:11:32,181 --> 02:11:34,250
But was he Herschel Walker?
You know what I'm saying?

2527
02:11:34,520 --> 02:11:37,370
Like athletes have today's era or 
different.

2528
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:39,290
And if you go back and look at John 
Holmes,

2529
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:40,280
yeah,
he had a big Dick,

2530
02:11:40,310 --> 02:11:43,070
but was it Lexington steel,
you know,

2531
02:11:43,100 --> 02:11:43,933
like these guys have bigger dicks now.
But the people on the board vets people 

2532
02:11:47,961 --> 02:11:48,794
are growing.
The thing that freaked me out of the 

2533
02:11:50,631 --> 02:11:55,631
human species is advancing fancy.
But then that about Santo that I enjoyed

2534
02:11:56,811 --> 02:12:01,340
from your first book event in October 
and I wanted to tell Joe to stories that

2535
02:12:01,341 --> 02:12:06,341
one time Kennedy went to cast a Cuba as 
a senator and they were having some type

2536
02:12:06,441 --> 02:12:10,680
of meeting but fucking Kennedy can focus
right?

2537
02:12:12,740 --> 02:12:13,573
And that they like,
what the fuck is wrong with him in St 

2538
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:17,120
Louis for Cathy goes,
I know exactly what's wrong.

2539
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:18,043
Come on.
And they tapped him on the shoulder and 

2540
02:12:19,581 --> 02:12:20,414
they bring them in a room.
He's embellishing this a little is 

2541
02:12:24,590 --> 02:12:25,423
better.
This is what I remember I read and that 

2542
02:12:27,650 --> 02:12:28,483
I guess Santo,
he's sic them onto women candidates 

2543
02:12:30,460 --> 02:12:32,030
while he set up a.
They filmed it.

2544
02:12:32,130 --> 02:12:34,250
He said no,
they didn't film it.

2545
02:12:34,850 --> 02:12:36,770
They wish they wish they had filmed 
that.

2546
02:12:36,771 --> 02:12:37,604
They said they set him up in a room with
a two way mirror and they watched it 

2547
02:12:40,731 --> 02:12:42,620
happening and then one of them turned 
the other and said,

2548
02:12:42,621 --> 02:12:43,940
Shit,
we should've filmed this.

2549
02:12:44,180 --> 02:12:45,980
This would make great blackmail 
material.

2550
02:12:46,010 --> 02:12:47,280
Right?
Like,

2551
02:12:47,470 --> 02:12:48,930
Santo is kind of a freak.

2552
02:12:50,960 --> 02:12:53,500
JFK,
the freakiest the freaks,

2553
02:12:53,501 --> 02:12:54,210
right?
Yeah.

2554
02:12:54,210 --> 02:12:55,043
Well,
but you got to keep in mind he wasn't 

2555
02:12:56,151 --> 02:12:57,920
married.
He was a young senator.

2556
02:12:58,070 --> 02:12:58,903
He used to get this senator from Florida
named George Smathers and the two of 

2557
02:13:02,811 --> 02:13:06,560
them would go down to Havana and this 
was around 1955,

2558
02:13:06,570 --> 02:13:09,740
56 when the whole thing was in its 
heyday.

2559
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:12,350
And that was a big part of a van,
uh,

2560
02:13:12,351 --> 02:13:16,280
politicians and businessmen with going 
junkets to Havana,

2561
02:13:16,281 --> 02:13:17,114
like,
you know,

2562
02:13:17,270 --> 02:13:20,360
paid for by the company,
weekend retreat,

2563
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:21,373
go to Havana.
And they'd go to the Shanghai theater 

2564
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:26,210
and they have Tris,
sexual Triste,

2565
02:13:26,211 --> 02:13:28,580
and they'd go crazy.
And it was out of sight,

2566
02:13:28,581 --> 02:13:30,470
out of mind.
It was the original,

2567
02:13:30,471 --> 02:13:31,860
you know,
what happens in Havana,

2568
02:13:31,861 --> 02:13:32,250
stays

2569
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:33,083
in van.
It was all different country wasn't 

2570
02:13:34,161 --> 02:13:34,994
going to make the newspapers.
So they go there and they'd rub elbows 

2571
02:13:37,561 --> 02:13:41,400
with Santa traffic content in Meyer 
Lansky and they loved it.

2572
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:43,260
It was exciting.
It wouldn't.

2573
02:13:43,261 --> 02:13:45,300
It wouldn't do them any damage back 
home.

2574
02:13:45,880 --> 02:13:46,830
No.
It's amazing.

2575
02:13:46,831 --> 02:13:47,664
When my mother died in [inaudible] 79 
and whenever I did something like if I 

2576
02:13:50,941 --> 02:13:55,260
call my head differently or if I wore 
like a orange shirt,

2577
02:13:55,261 --> 02:13:57,240
my mom will go,
what are you fucking rock Hudson?

2578
02:13:58,840 --> 02:14:00,770
And I go,
what the fuck are you talking about rock

2579
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:01,670
Hudson,
you know,

2580
02:14:02,010 --> 02:14:04,500
one day I asked,
why do you always call me a rock Hudson?

2581
02:14:05,270 --> 02:14:06,340
And she goes,
because rock Hudson,

2582
02:14:06,350 --> 02:14:08,260
I don't money go.
And I go,

2583
02:14:08,261 --> 02:14:12,780
what the fuck are you talking about?
She told me she died in [inaudible] 79.

2584
02:14:12,810 --> 02:14:13,643
My Mom told me in 1978 flat out to my 
face that fucking he was gay as could 

2585
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:19,393
be.
And I'm like,

2586
02:14:20,100 --> 02:14:20,933
you don't want.
I've heard I'm sick and tired of you 

2587
02:14:22,741 --> 02:14:23,574
fucking Cubans because Cubans,
like they used to tell me when I was a 

2588
02:14:25,981 --> 02:14:29,720
kid that they smacked Bruce Lee and Cuba
one time that he went down there talking

2589
02:14:29,780 --> 02:14:30,000
shit.

2590
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:30,833
And one of my uncles smack them in the 
Cubans ally to you just to fucking fuck 

2591
02:14:35,401 --> 02:14:37,810
with you.
So I thought my mother was fucking me.

2592
02:14:37,830 --> 02:14:41,070
She's like a rock concert is as gay as a
$3 bill.

2593
02:14:41,610 --> 02:14:43,530
And I go,
what the fuck are you talking about?

2594
02:14:43,531 --> 02:14:43,950
She goes,
I mean,

2595
02:14:43,950 --> 02:14:46,170
what I'm talking about right when I was 
a little girl,

2596
02:14:46,670 --> 02:14:49,180
Rock Katrina would come to Cuba and we 
would all go to the hotel.

2597
02:14:49,181 --> 02:14:50,940
You like when Michael Jackson goes to a 
hotel,

2598
02:14:51,210 --> 02:14:54,450
come outside and they clapped and he 
shook the kid outside the window.

2599
02:14:54,690 --> 02:14:57,140
We would be out there like waiting to 
see rock coaching.

2600
02:14:57,750 --> 02:14:58,583
But the hotel guy would tell us he was 
up there in a room with a man and I 

2601
02:15:01,081 --> 02:15:01,914
would go,
Ma,

2602
02:15:02,430 --> 02:15:04,470
are you fucking crazy?
Like I didn't believe her.

2603
02:15:04,740 --> 02:15:07,520
My mother died in [inaudible] 79 85 
rockets and comes on.

2604
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:08,393
Says he's gay.
Like Campbell was just a hiding place 

2605
02:15:11,491 --> 02:15:12,220
for people.

2606
02:15:12,220 --> 02:15:15,280
Did your mother know that the Marlon 
Brando was fucking Richard Pryor?

2607
02:15:15,390 --> 02:15:18,630
No.
I found out from this article,

2608
02:15:19,440 --> 02:15:21,300
if we will have scrolled down a little 
bit,

2609
02:15:21,301 --> 02:15:22,134
it says it,
that they asked his neighbors and the 

2610
02:15:23,641 --> 02:15:24,690
neighbors were like,
no,

2611
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:25,853
he was bisexual and his number one guy 
that was known every time he came to 

2612
02:15:30,061 --> 02:15:30,894
Cuba was Marlon Brando.
He was Marlon Brando was walking there 

2613
02:15:33,721 --> 02:15:34,554
with to showgirls and then him and 
fucking superman would leave by 

2614
02:15:37,471 --> 02:15:38,304
themselves.

2615
02:15:39,360 --> 02:15:42,170
Well,
Brando loved the music he played,

2616
02:15:42,230 --> 02:15:46,260
but he was really into it.
Well,

2617
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:47,203
Pryor's wife was saying that back then,
they were doing so much coke that 

2618
02:15:49,291 --> 02:15:52,740
everybody just fucked everybody.
Everybody that's so crazy.

2619
02:15:52,741 --> 02:15:56,520
He couldn't make Jack Fuck somebody like
David Garrison.

2620
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:57,623
That was one of the Mick Jagger's wife 
said she caught David Bowie in bed with 

2621
02:16:00,780 --> 02:16:02,190
Mick Jagger.
Know a lot of coke,

2622
02:16:02,191 --> 02:16:04,260
but I never wanted to fuck you up the 
ass Joe Rogan.

2623
02:16:04,261 --> 02:16:05,900
You know what I'm saying?
Like I never did a lot of.

2624
02:16:05,990 --> 02:16:08,060
Whenever I want to fuck another guy in 
the,

2625
02:16:08,190 --> 02:16:11,580
in the story Brando who is bisexual took
off with superman,

2626
02:16:11,610 --> 02:16:14,620
ditching the dancers.
So Superman was a bisexual too.

2627
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:17,670
In fact,
I heard he had died of gangrene.

2628
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:19,080
Gangrene,
yeah.

2629
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,120
And here it says infected.
Yeah.

2630
02:16:21,121 --> 02:16:24,630
He died with a lover from sex.
Oh,

2631
02:16:24,631 --> 02:16:25,464
he slept around but gangrene from sex.
How hard you got to fuck to get 

2632
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:29,883
gangrene.

2633
02:16:30,060 --> 02:16:30,893
Maybe.
Fuck this chick that got shot in the 

2634
02:16:31,991 --> 02:16:35,530
ass.
He might've fucked animals.

2635
02:16:36,520 --> 02:16:37,740
Yeah.
Wow.

2636
02:16:38,010 --> 02:16:38,550
Yeah,
yeah,

2637
02:16:38,550 --> 02:16:39,560
yeah,
yeah,

2638
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:40,050
yeah,
yeah,

2639
02:16:40,050 --> 02:16:40,883
yeah,
yeah.

2640
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,940
Dirty Bro.
Cuba was dirty.

2641
02:16:42,941 --> 02:16:44,360
It was dirty.
Oh Gee.

2642
02:16:44,390 --> 02:16:46,270
Let me say something else that's 
another,

2643
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:47,733
that whole society that he hasn't 
touched in on that I know he knows 

2644
02:16:51,581 --> 02:16:53,700
about.
And that's the Aba Society.

2645
02:16:53,730 --> 02:16:55,630
What's the requirement?
That's a complete.

2646
02:16:55,631 --> 02:16:58,420
That's the,
that's the Brotherhood of men in Cuba.

2647
02:16:59,010 --> 02:17:01,720
You will see.
So as you see them at mcguire,

2648
02:17:01,721 --> 02:17:05,920
you know you're dealing with them.
Doesn't talk that day.

2649
02:17:05,950 --> 02:17:08,410
The whole goal.
They don't.

2650
02:17:08,650 --> 02:17:11,260
What does that mean?
Like I fuck with you.

2651
02:17:11,320 --> 02:17:12,153
A couple of years ago you were living in
Colorado and I saw a kid with a balloon 

2652
02:17:15,581 --> 02:17:18,040
and I call you balloons and we,
me and Eddie,

2653
02:17:19,210 --> 02:17:21,850
you come up to,
I call him his nickname.

2654
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:25,720
You got a different situation.
It'll pull you aside and go,

2655
02:17:25,721 --> 02:17:26,554
I don't know you and don't you ever 
fucking call me that outside the circle 

2656
02:17:30,221 --> 02:17:34,510
again and when they get mad at you,
okay to prove their manhood,

2657
02:17:34,830 --> 02:17:36,130
they beat you.

2658
02:17:36,790 --> 02:17:37,623
Throw you on the floor,
pull your pants down and slice your ass 

2659
02:17:40,241 --> 02:17:43,960
with a straight razor.
That's the worst fucking mad one.

2660
02:17:43,961 --> 02:17:44,794
Did that to two or three people.
My mother's wake guy couldn't come in 

2661
02:17:47,771 --> 02:17:49,400
because one,
it's sliced his ass.

2662
02:17:49,410 --> 02:17:50,243
I'm like,
oh no.

2663
02:17:50,500 --> 02:17:52,360
This guy took me to baseball games.
One,

2664
02:17:52,361 --> 02:17:53,860
get the fuck out.
He stand.

2665
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:56,260
That's their thing.
They only pussy.

2666
02:17:57,070 --> 02:18:00,190
They can't be in a room if another man 
is gay in the room.

2667
02:18:01,030 --> 02:18:02,800
Wow.
Oh yeah,

2668
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:04,120
but guess what?
Your Romero.

2669
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:06,370
Tomi,
it's sold dissolved.

2670
02:18:06,371 --> 02:18:10,450
Now that this gay man and I bought 50 
years ago,

2671
02:18:10,510 --> 02:18:12,280
bro,
Bro.

2672
02:18:12,370 --> 02:18:14,680
Some people would call that advanced 
joey.

2673
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:15,900
That's progress.
What's that?

2674
02:18:15,940 --> 02:18:17,470
That now there's getting.
Well,

2675
02:18:17,471 --> 02:18:17,860
yeah,
yeah.

2676
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:18,500
No,
no.

2677
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:20,700
It's the surprise.
They had gay man,

2678
02:18:21,100 --> 02:18:24,850
but 50 years ago one of that went to her
room.

2679
02:18:25,450 --> 02:18:28,840
You had to be on your best behavior.
They don't speak Spanish.

2680
02:18:31,090 --> 02:18:32,920
They have their own line.
They have their own language.

2681
02:18:33,010 --> 02:18:34,090
Oh,
I know it.

2682
02:18:34,091 --> 02:18:35,200
I know it.
Wait a minute.

2683
02:18:35,320 --> 02:18:37,440
They have their own language.
That's the wrong way.

2684
02:18:37,441 --> 02:18:39,700
Which in Spanish it's a.
it's like a Patois.

2685
02:18:39,890 --> 02:18:44,340
It's like a patois based on African 
Monina and I said it.

2686
02:18:44,710 --> 02:18:47,420
It had some Spanish.
When call you Monina.

2687
02:18:47,440 --> 02:18:50,980
That's my brother and that thing.
What's the Organization of this group?

2688
02:18:51,010 --> 02:18:54,250
I mean is it is.
It shows that a long shore man,

2689
02:18:54,400 --> 02:18:57,160
that the man of Cuba,
they don't even eat pussy.

2690
02:18:57,161 --> 02:18:59,130
That's such a man,
but they.

2691
02:18:59,410 --> 02:19:01,960
And they can fuck other men and other 
men could suck.

2692
02:19:02,050 --> 02:19:04,510
They're begging.
They're big in prison systems.

2693
02:19:04,530 --> 02:19:07,600
They got pregnant system.
They can fuck other men.

2694
02:19:07,870 --> 02:19:08,703
Oh yeah,
I can.

2695
02:19:08,780 --> 02:19:09,613
I can pick you out and go joe,
you're no longer joe or Josephina will 

2696
02:19:12,911 --> 02:19:15,040
get a wig and put lipstick on.

2697
02:19:15,100 --> 02:19:18,790
Pining away and I'll fuck you in the ass
and you're going to suck my dick.

2698
02:19:19,450 --> 02:19:23,170
Don't you fucking think you're going to 
fucking kiss me and touch?

2699
02:19:23,230 --> 02:19:24,310
Yeah,
and they beat you.

2700
02:19:24,560 --> 02:19:26,950
You shut up.
You fucking whore.

2701
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:30,360
You can find somebody else,
but you can't be fucked.

2702
02:19:31,060 --> 02:19:31,893
Fucked by another man.
That's for if a man wants to suck your 

2703
02:19:34,910 --> 02:19:35,743
Dick Slums.
I remember one night but quite used to 

2704
02:19:36,871 --> 02:19:40,190
tell me a guy sucked my big one time 
when ice cubes in his mouth.

2705
02:19:40,640 --> 02:19:41,630
It was tremendous.
I'm,

2706
02:19:41,900 --> 02:19:45,210
what the fuck are you talking about?
Well,

2707
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:47,200
that was the fourth grade I was 
surrounded with.

2708
02:19:48,470 --> 02:19:52,670
You say hello is certain way.
I'll show you a video.

2709
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:54,350
How do you spell it?
A,

2710
02:19:54,351 --> 02:19:56,510
b,
u k,

2711
02:19:56,511 --> 02:19:59,330

It may be a k,

2712
02:19:59,340 --> 02:20:04,340
u l what is it?
Pulling up.

2713
02:20:04,770 --> 02:20:05,603
There's a bunch of hair on youtube.
I'll show you the dance one is the one 

2714
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:13,331
you have to see how they dance.
How they move about quite you,

2715
02:20:13,530 --> 02:20:14,660
ruble,
whatever.

2716
02:20:16,350 --> 02:20:17,183
No,
no,

2717
02:20:17,190 --> 02:20:18,810
no.
This is the second one.

2718
02:20:18,870 --> 02:20:19,770
Go to that second one.

2719
02:20:20,710 --> 02:20:21,543
Hour long

2720
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:27,940
and so these are just serious dudes.
They just put in and then put in y o r u

2721
02:20:30,700 --> 02:20:32,120
Ba and let me tell you what.
See what comes up.

2722
02:20:32,150 --> 02:20:37,150
It's also African base also after the 
musical elements right there.

2723
02:20:38,120 --> 02:20:39,470
Right there.
There you go.

2724
02:20:39,530 --> 02:20:41,250
Okay.
Let me show you what it is.

2725
02:20:42,460 --> 02:20:44,480
And they're all dressed in white.
They're all dressed in white,

2726
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:48,070
still dressed in white.
No women allowed.

2727
02:20:49,420 --> 02:20:50,980
No nothing.
Place them in this,

2728
02:20:51,010 --> 02:20:52,030
Jamie,
so we could hear it.

2729
02:20:56,080 --> 02:20:56,913
No women.

2730
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:58,260
No,
no.

2731
02:20:58,260 --> 02:21:03,260
This woman is second.
A woman named will will dance.

2732
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:07,110
So you see the woman on the road?

2733
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:08,173
Yeah.

2734
02:21:10,730 --> 02:21:12,760
I'll see how the guy shows up.
That's an Aba.

2735
02:21:13,090 --> 02:21:14,180
Look at this bucket.
Beauty.

2736
02:21:14,840 --> 02:21:16,610
The colors are white and red,
right?

2737
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:20,410
You will see red.
That's the guy that's the there.

2738
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:25,440
The take the tin man from the window.
Was there the,

2739
02:21:26,570 --> 02:21:29,000
you know,
just saying that could get a break.

2740
02:21:29,001 --> 02:21:31,110
They're going to salute with your elbow.
Hit him back.

2741
02:21:31,240 --> 02:21:32,440
Get a bad you.
You,

2742
02:21:32,560 --> 02:21:36,260
you could suffer like this.
Making fun of making fun of it.

2743
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:37,303
Wow.
If I see him like that's how I do like 

2744
02:21:39,261 --> 02:21:40,270
this,
don't let me know.

2745
02:21:40,280 --> 02:21:43,650
But you touch elbows.
Touch,

2746
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:44,600
bow.
Wow.

2747
02:21:44,810 --> 02:21:48,800
And now there's actually gay men.
Now it's diluted so much.

2748
02:21:49,640 --> 02:21:53,640
It's been diluted over the years.
But when I met Juan and Leo,

2749
02:21:53,690 --> 02:21:58,400
they were two.
Ob was a Taco tico or Latin band,

2750
02:21:59,120 --> 02:22:01,060
not the cube.
That the Conga player,

2751
02:22:01,160 --> 02:22:03,180
the singer.
He was about quarterly.

2752
02:22:03,190 --> 02:22:05,600
So if you were,
you just,

2753
02:22:05,630 --> 02:22:08,870
there was a code way.
You've very manly code.

2754
02:22:08,871 --> 02:22:09,704
I come over here,
there's a gay man and he I call you out 

2755
02:22:11,841 --> 02:22:13,090
of the room like,
Oh,

2756
02:22:13,100 --> 02:22:15,320
do me a favor.
Get that motherfucker out of the room.

2757
02:22:15,321 --> 02:22:17,750
Or if not,
you can't talk to them.

2758
02:22:17,751 --> 02:22:18,584
You can approach them a certain way.
Cuba experienced a lot of progressive 

2759
02:22:22,400 --> 02:22:23,650
ideology.
Like is it.

2760
02:22:23,660 --> 02:22:26,040
If they changed it,
it's very progressive

2761
02:22:26,720 --> 02:22:27,553
thoughts.
What's caused this because they really 

2762
02:22:30,130 --> 02:22:34,710
didn't progress changing thing from.
Yeah,

2763
02:22:35,220 --> 02:22:37,560
but their progress.
I mean they are so isolated.

2764
02:22:37,890 --> 02:22:39,270
They didn't have the Internet,
right?

2765
02:22:39,300 --> 02:22:40,430
They don't have the Internet.
No,

2766
02:22:40,620 --> 02:22:41,453
no.
I think certain places and they're 

2767
02:22:42,131 --> 02:22:44,070
getting it now.
I think certain places.

2768
02:22:44,071 --> 02:22:45,810
Yeah,
he can get it here and there.

2769
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:46,673
It's not great.
It's frustrating when you go there 

2770
02:22:48,660 --> 02:22:49,493
because he can't.
What's what's Nice is you go to Havana 

2771
02:22:51,571 --> 02:22:55,560
and you kind of disengage from modern 
technology.

2772
02:22:55,561 --> 02:22:56,394
I love it.
I mean you couldn't live there because 

2773
02:22:57,901 --> 02:23:02,490
he can't really do business there,
but you just kind of disengaged from.

2774
02:23:02,550 --> 02:23:05,940
And is it easy to travel there now as 
far as flights in America?

2775
02:23:06,210 --> 02:23:10,590
Just legal like a motherfucker like 
hilarious.

2776
02:23:11,070 --> 02:23:13,480
I remember when I was a kid,
like if you had a Cuban cigar,

2777
02:23:13,481 --> 02:23:17,220
I was like a big deal.
I don't tell anybody we got Cubans.

2778
02:23:17,720 --> 02:23:20,100
Well that's still,
that's still illegal.

2779
02:23:21,080 --> 02:23:23,220
Some of them,
the embargo still exists.

2780
02:23:23,240 --> 02:23:24,440
Yeah.
But you could have some cigars.

2781
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:26,520
You're allowed to have some Cuban 
cigars.

2782
02:23:26,521 --> 02:23:28,110
Right.
You ever see if you,

2783
02:23:28,111 --> 02:23:29,830
uh,
what is the amount of.

2784
02:23:29,910 --> 02:23:32,730
I think you're allowed to have like 10.
You can't bring them back.

2785
02:23:32,731 --> 02:23:33,340
Yeah,
yeah,

2786
02:23:33,340 --> 02:23:34,173
yeah.
You can't sell them here or if you can 

2787
02:23:35,911 --> 02:23:37,260
sell them here,
you can't sell a lot.

2788
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:41,660
Something like that.
Now I'm happy rose's book because a,

2789
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:44,010
I knew the story was out there.
Joe.

2790
02:23:44,140 --> 02:23:45,750
I like,
we haven't even touched.

2791
02:23:46,400 --> 02:23:50,250
Like I was raised by Omega seven guy.
Like he grew up with my father.

2792
02:23:51,060 --> 02:23:51,893
So I told Joey when I first met him and 
I was sort of almost done with this 

2793
02:23:56,131 --> 02:23:56,964
book.
I said,

2794
02:23:58,770 --> 02:24:00,180
I said,
when you read it,

2795
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:03,000
you're going to need to sit down because
for a guy like him,

2796
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:09,180
he knew a lot and I knew he would come 
across names that he knew,

2797
02:24:09,990 --> 02:24:10,823
but there's no way you could have been 
part of this and known the whole thing 

2798
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:14,513
right now.

2799
02:24:14,610 --> 02:24:16,120
Right.
So you,

2800
02:24:16,121 --> 02:24:18,030
you like,
you knew who he was.

2801
02:24:18,031 --> 02:24:18,864
You knew he was back.
He didn't know it was a professional 

2802
02:24:21,151 --> 02:24:24,180
assassin for Omega seven.
I knew todd that you killed.

2803
02:24:24,181 --> 02:24:26,250
My mother warned me.
My mother used to go,

2804
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:27,353
when he picks you up at school,
please don't get in the car with them 

2805
02:24:29,340 --> 02:24:31,680
because it's going to get shot one day 
and I don't want to interrupt people.

2806
02:24:31,681 --> 02:24:34,440
New Battle.
And they knew some things about him,

2807
02:24:34,470 --> 02:24:36,840
but they didn't know no one who was part
of it.

2808
02:24:37,320 --> 02:24:40,000
They thought they knew the whole story,
but there's no way you couldn't.

2809
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:43,650
You couldn't know.
It blew my fucking mind.

2810
02:24:43,890 --> 02:24:44,723
I went to a dance with my daughter and I
came home and the book was waiting for 

2811
02:24:46,831 --> 02:24:47,850
me.
You know,

2812
02:24:47,851 --> 02:24:48,684
Amazon drops it off in front of the 
house and they had ripped it and there 

2813
02:24:51,541 --> 02:24:55,350
was other kids,
other moms with my wife and I don't like

2814
02:24:55,351 --> 02:24:57,780
to do put it in my office.
I want to open that.

2815
02:24:57,930 --> 02:25:02,930
I saw Dorothy and Mancini and my fucking
knee dropped like it had hit me.

2816
02:25:04,110 --> 02:25:07,650
He kept texting me as you were reading 
at 12:00 at night and I go,

2817
02:25:07,651 --> 02:25:08,484
you have no idea,
but I didn't know that this guy used to 

2818
02:25:11,971 --> 02:25:14,730
go away every six months and his wife 
was tight.

2819
02:25:14,970 --> 02:25:18,110
You know the story I told you about.
My mom would play cards and then I would

2820
02:25:18,111 --> 02:25:18,944
put tidy whities honors dance for the 
women of shots of Tequila and make me 

2821
02:25:22,051 --> 02:25:24,070
dance.
Nina was in that

2822
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,200
book.
Nina is in that book.

2823
02:25:26,201 --> 02:25:28,420
When my mother died,
I gave Nina my dog.

2824
02:25:28,421 --> 02:25:29,254
I couldn't take that dog,
so I used to go to Nina's house on 51st 

2825
02:25:32,021 --> 02:25:35,530
street and cry in the dog house like 
this is my dog.

2826
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:36,483
So soon as I saw it,
I knew he was onto something because 

2827
02:25:40,091 --> 02:25:44,230
dorothy was my father's friend and he 
was type of guy that would come visit me

2828
02:25:44,231 --> 02:25:49,231
every week just because he was my 
father's friend and give me 50 bucks and

2829
02:25:49,241 --> 02:25:53,110
take me to the city and get haircuts.
But his claim to fame was in the seventh

2830
02:25:53,111 --> 02:25:54,340
grade.
My mother told him,

2831
02:25:54,341 --> 02:25:55,300
I don't know what I'm going to do with 
them.

2832
02:25:55,990 --> 02:25:58,330
He's got some fucking girlfriend.
He won't even talk to me.

2833
02:25:58,690 --> 02:25:59,523
This guy came to my house and gave me a 
capsule and right in front of me he 

2834
02:26:02,711 --> 02:26:04,570
filled it up with coke and he goes,
let me tell you something.

2835
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:07,200
Seventh grade,
seventh grade,

2836
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:09,140
he goes,
next time this girl comes over here,

2837
02:26:09,750 --> 02:26:12,090
your sprinklers,
coke on a pussy and you look at.

2838
02:26:12,091 --> 02:26:12,924
And I'm like,
I didn't even like a pussy that I had 

2839
02:26:15,570 --> 02:26:16,403
outside of genes.
That coke capsule was in my drawer for 

2840
02:26:19,871 --> 02:26:23,410
like a year,
like in the back of my nightstand,

2841
02:26:23,470 --> 02:26:24,550
right?
I didn't,

2842
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:25,700
you know,
I wasn't at,

2843
02:26:25,710 --> 02:26:26,800
it wasn't a drug,
nothing.

2844
02:26:27,150 --> 02:26:30,460
And One night my mom came home with 
three cocktails and then she's like,

2845
02:26:31,330 --> 02:26:35,830
I got fucking news today from topic that
he gave you cocaine.

2846
02:26:35,831 --> 02:26:38,050
Where the fuck is I go to my drawer,
I didn't use it.

2847
02:26:38,620 --> 02:26:39,970
She fucking smack me.
She goes,

2848
02:26:39,971 --> 02:26:43,180
don't you ever fucking thing drugs?
And then she went and did it.

2849
02:26:44,440 --> 02:26:47,080
She went and did the blast.
But that guy,

2850
02:26:47,081 --> 02:26:51,170
when I was in the seventh grade,
gave me a capsule of wow and said put it

2851
02:26:51,171 --> 02:26:56,171
on her pussy or drive a fucking crazy.
Like that's how that meant that he was

2852
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:58,113
the text.
I remember getting from you as you were 

2853
02:26:59,621 --> 02:27:01,930
reading the book.
I was getting every,

2854
02:27:01,931 --> 02:27:02,764
every,
every 30 minutes or so I'd get a text 

2855
02:27:04,531 --> 02:27:07,270
from him and be another name like I 
can't believe you have this name.

2856
02:27:07,420 --> 02:27:08,253
Finally the last one was the texts said 
Naynay Cordero with an exclamation mark 

2857
02:27:12,761 --> 02:27:15,670
and a comment and said,
you bad motherfucker.

2858
02:27:16,770 --> 02:27:18,760
He couldn't believe some of the names 
that were in there.

2859
02:27:18,761 --> 02:27:21,130
And I know that he must have been 
emotional.

2860
02:27:21,131 --> 02:27:22,630
I said,
this is going to be tonight.

2861
02:27:22,750 --> 02:27:23,760
I was crying because

2862
02:27:23,910 --> 02:27:25,530
that was two banks.
When I was growing up,

2863
02:27:25,531 --> 02:27:27,140
there was Raleigh,
Amea Alito,

2864
02:27:27,390 --> 02:27:29,730
and there were partners with child 
Miguelito.

2865
02:27:29,731 --> 02:27:33,140
People used to goof on him.
He had a pigeon toe and they would go on

2866
02:27:33,141 --> 02:27:34,410
them in front of my mother and go,
you know,

2867
02:27:34,411 --> 02:27:38,340
he could be Coco's father,
so mega lethal always duped me 100 bucks

2868
02:27:38,341 --> 02:27:40,220
and they're writing them,
but he had a Puerto Rican white,

2869
02:27:40,221 --> 02:27:41,054
but his name was Martin Marlana.
That was fucking hot and I guess the 

2870
02:27:44,911 --> 02:27:48,510
name mark has had an affair with her and
he went in.

2871
02:27:48,511 --> 02:27:50,910
The name mark has was the barber.
Yeah.

2872
02:27:53,030 --> 02:27:53,863
And when I was a kid I remember someone 
made a lethal shot and naked railroad 

2873
02:27:56,540 --> 02:27:57,373
and the foot.
He walked right into the bar and that's 

2874
02:27:59,370 --> 02:28:02,770
joe it big and become the wild west.
Yeah,

2875
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:06,630
like union city had become.
If I shot Jamie,

2876
02:28:06,930 --> 02:28:08,700
ain't no.
The only person who didn't come after me

2877
02:28:08,701 --> 02:28:10,560
as Joe.
You know what I'm saying?

2878
02:28:10,561 --> 02:28:12,950
Like there's no cops.
Wow.

2879
02:28:13,140 --> 02:28:15,200
There was no cops involved and it's like
that today.

2880
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:16,360
Still.
I don't know about.

2881
02:28:16,580 --> 02:28:17,401
No,
no,

2882
02:28:17,401 --> 02:28:17,781
no,
no,

2883
02:28:17,781 --> 02:28:18,614
no.
This was the seventies when still 

2884
02:28:20,131 --> 02:28:22,170
corruption.
Oh yeah.

2885
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:25,670
They robbed from fucking everything.
They just went.

2886
02:28:25,671 --> 02:28:26,504
I went home last week.
There was problems with Doug Burgum 

2887
02:28:27,860 --> 02:28:30,290
right when I was home.
I stayed in edgewater,

2888
02:28:30,291 --> 02:28:33,050
so I didn't even go up there.
When the book came out,

2889
02:28:33,051 --> 02:28:36,300
I got a call from battles.
Long time lawyer,

2890
02:28:36,301 --> 02:28:38,300
a guy named Jack Blumenfeld.
Wonderful Guy.

2891
02:28:38,310 --> 02:28:40,190
Interviewed him numerous times for the 
book,

2892
02:28:40,370 --> 02:28:41,203
new battle as well as anybody a defended
him in a number of different cases over 

2893
02:28:45,951 --> 02:28:48,140
the years.
I knew a lot about him.

2894
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:50,810
Uh,
I sent the book to him.

2895
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:53,510
He called me.
I don't know him that well,

2896
02:28:53,511 --> 02:28:54,344
so he was a little stiff and first we 
corrected some factual things in the 

2897
02:28:58,371 --> 02:29:00,860
manuscript and then he got real quiet.
He said,

2898
02:29:01,340 --> 02:29:02,360
you know,
this was very,

2899
02:29:02,361 --> 02:29:05,420
it was very emotional for me to read 
this book.

2900
02:29:05,450 --> 02:29:06,283
He said,
cause just all kinds of things kept 

2901
02:29:08,691 --> 02:29:09,524
flooding back.
You would use a name or you describe an 

2902
02:29:11,841 --> 02:29:14,810
incident and all of a sudden it would 
flood my memory.

2903
02:29:14,810 --> 02:29:16,910
Same thing that was happening to you 
when you read it,

2904
02:29:17,430 --> 02:29:19,430
the little detail would go,
oh my God,

2905
02:29:19,431 --> 02:29:23,090
it was almost like an outer body 
experience and that's the power.

2906
02:29:23,180 --> 02:29:24,520
That's the power of literature,
man.

2907
02:29:25,010 --> 02:29:25,843
That's the power of like losing yourself
in a book to where it engages your 

2908
02:29:29,720 --> 02:29:33,480
memory and your imagination that you're 
almost reliving it as you're reading and

2909
02:29:33,481 --> 02:29:36,140
you talk about 39 slash 11 Kennedy 
Boulevard,

2910
02:29:36,141 --> 02:29:40,190
the home of Charlie's project,
only basketball games.

2911
02:29:40,400 --> 02:29:41,233
I went into those projects.
I used to go there at seven in the 

2912
02:29:42,771 --> 02:29:46,430
morning and shoot 300 jump shots because
there'd be nobody there.

2913
02:29:47,210 --> 02:29:50,540
So imagine you're reading a book and you
come across that address in.

2914
02:29:50,541 --> 02:29:54,080
It reminds you of what he's saying.
It was down the block,

2915
02:29:54,140 --> 02:29:54,973
up the block,
down the block was a bond named Bernice 

2916
02:29:56,690 --> 02:29:59,460
in north Bergen for years or you have to
have.

2917
02:29:59,460 --> 02:30:01,160
You ran out of beer at five in the 
morning.

2918
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:05,120
You went to earnings and you're pounding
on the door and they would go,

2919
02:30:05,121 --> 02:30:06,290
what the fuck?
You want?

2920
02:30:06,650 --> 02:30:07,840
I want beer,
or I write,

2921
02:30:07,930 --> 02:30:09,130
what do you want me to get?
Three,

2922
02:30:09,140 --> 02:30:09,990
eight packs.
I right,

2923
02:30:10,040 --> 02:30:10,873
you should have said so what do you,
when you getting emotional for you can 

2924
02:30:13,640 --> 02:30:14,473
be testing already would sell you 
business and there was the coldest beer 

2925
02:30:17,421 --> 02:30:18,254
in town.
That was his reputation when we were in 

2926
02:30:20,901 --> 02:30:22,970
high school.
Five in the morning early.

2927
02:30:22,971 --> 02:30:23,804
Open up you fucking SPEC.
Fuck you better open up and you better 

2928
02:30:27,230 --> 02:30:29,780
at least one full cases.
Now I want to get the fuck.

2929
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:33,470
He would always say the two,
but I grew up in those projects.

2930
02:30:33,471 --> 02:30:35,270
Not a,
I didn't live there.

2931
02:30:35,780 --> 02:30:36,613
I don't know how many times I went there
to play basketball with him and Ernie 

2932
02:30:39,201 --> 02:30:42,220
was probably a personal friend of the 
mayor's already.

2933
02:30:42,260 --> 02:30:42,851
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

2934
02:30:42,851 --> 02:30:44,840
You know what I mean?
That's everything was connected.

2935
02:30:44,841 --> 02:30:45,674
Joe and I both know Joe doesn't remember
about who was running north Bergen at 

2936
02:30:50,481 --> 02:30:53,060
the time and like I said,
when my,

2937
02:30:53,330 --> 02:30:57,080
when my I became,
I fell into that house.

2938
02:30:57,410 --> 02:30:59,450
So where they,
they got his kids.

2939
02:30:59,990 --> 02:31:01,730
I got.
They were really talents.

2940
02:31:02,840 --> 02:31:04,780
So do you understand like if I went to 
your house,

2941
02:31:04,820 --> 02:31:06,920
whatever the girls get I.
Who does that anymore?

2942
02:31:07,460 --> 02:31:08,293
They got a motorcycle.
I got an Indian motorcycle if they went 

2943
02:31:10,851 --> 02:31:13,610
to Montauk for the weekend and I got the
Montauk for the weekend.

2944
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:16,420
If they got a no show job,
I got a little short job.

2945
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:17,503
I remember having a no show job in Irish
man when I was like in the seventh 

2946
02:31:20,251 --> 02:31:21,084
grade.
The Janet is hated me because that 

2947
02:31:22,801 --> 02:31:23,634
would,
that would get that and have all the 

2948
02:31:24,301 --> 02:31:27,510
desk on top of Shit and they'd be 
buffing floors,

2949
02:31:27,530 --> 02:31:30,790
not just walk past and will get my $80 
check and they're like,

2950
02:31:30,930 --> 02:31:32,070
are you ever going to do anything?

2951
02:31:32,070 --> 02:31:33,720
I'm gonna combine though.
I do what I want.

2952
02:31:33,721 --> 02:31:37,150
I knew you were connected.
I knew I do not want to call my boss.

2953
02:31:37,360 --> 02:31:40,320
I did whatever I wanted to.
Wow.

2954
02:31:40,350 --> 02:31:41,580
So listen,
let's wrap this up.

2955
02:31:41,581 --> 02:31:43,740
This book is out right now,

2956

2957
02:31:46,650 --> 02:31:50,100
