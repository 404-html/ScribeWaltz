1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,500
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,191
So listen,

3
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:02,431
man,

4
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:03,540
last time you were here,

5
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,790
there's a fucking story
about the Russian mob.

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,260
We tease these bitches.

7
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,480
We let these people right now on Twitter,

8
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,740
they have been going crazy all day.

9
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:14,220
Do not let Bert Kreischer get out of
there without the Russian mob story,

10
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:14,910
man.

11
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,170
Tell us what the fuck happened.

12
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,390
All right,

13
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,390
this is in 1993 probably I
think is what I went to Russia.

14
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,250
I was taking Russian
classes at Florida state.

15
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:30,050
I thought they were Spanish classes
because I thought has been this classes

16
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,920
because I was a noon class and I signed
up and then I was like fucking sweet

17
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:34,850
Spanish at noon.

18
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,210
I get phone that in and then I get there
and they start writing a new language,

19
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,961
a new alphabet.

20
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:39,291
And I'm like,

21
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:39,800
all right,

22
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,940
this clearly isn't Spanish.

23
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,200
So then I said it,

24
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:42,651
I'm going to leave.

25
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:43,520
And the teacher's like,

26
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:44,150
listen,

27
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,970
don't leave.

28
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,803
Um,

29
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:46,700
because if you leave,

30
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,100
we can't have a class and I
can't get my master's degree.

31
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:49,491
So,

32
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,390
but if you stick around,

33
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,471
I'll talk to,

34
00:00:51,471 --> 00:00:52,220
you have to have class.

35
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,060
I get done the end of class.

36
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:53,894
She was like,

37
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:54,351
listen,

38
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:54,711
don't,

39
00:00:54,711 --> 00:00:55,310
uh,

40
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,700
you know,

41
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,860
if you don't leave when I
want to show up at class,

42
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:58,694
I'll give you a c.

43
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,480
I was like,

44
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,170
done,

45
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:00,800
done.

46
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,790
So I took Russian,

47
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,721
I took Russian one,

48
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:02,901
two,

49
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:04,360
and three because these kids need it.

50
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,500
Another guy in the class
to take these classes.

51
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:07,820
So then finally I take rush,

52
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:09,440
I'd take her out and
four and we go to Russia,

53
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,550
we go to Russia.

54
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,391
But this is Rochelle.

55
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:13,370
Like when the mob ran Russia,

56
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,413
like are you,

57
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,580
are you guys aware of that?

58
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:17,570
Okay.

59
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,440
In like the 90s,

60
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,800
late nineties mid nineties the mob ran
everything that had to do with Russia.

61
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,330
So when going over to Russia,

62
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,164
you had to,

63
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,820
you had to literally pay off the
mob in order to go and study abroad.

64
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:34,090
So we paid off the mob and they gave us
in return to banditos too young mobsters

65
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,750
who would go everywhere with us.

66
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,040
They lived in our hotel,

67
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,390
they stayed with us.

68
00:01:38,391 --> 00:01:39,710
They went on tours with us.

69
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:40,190
They weren't,

70
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,270
they were did everything with us.

71
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,100
Their names are eager and
Sasha and when we got are,

72
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,081
our teaser was like,

73
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,411
listen,

74
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,430
this is Igor and Sasha.

75
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,710
They will be ghosting us with my
teacher who was there with me.

76
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,850
It was like during the fucking mob,

77
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,271
Igor,

78
00:01:50,271 --> 00:01:53,510
inside you go inside and they were
guy named Bruce and they were like,

79
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:53,960
and they were,

80
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,201
oh,

81
00:01:54,201 --> 00:01:55,034
it gets worse.

82
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,691
So they were like,

83
00:01:56,691 --> 00:01:57,081
listen,

84
00:01:57,081 --> 00:01:58,250
whatever you do to our class,

85
00:01:58,251 --> 00:01:59,210
do not talk to them.

86
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,200
Do not interact with them.

87
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,120
Do not engage them.

88
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,590
They're only here to shadow us.

89
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:04,341
So in my head I'm like,

90
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,170
fucking get to know these guys,

91
00:02:06,171 --> 00:02:06,710
right?

92
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,820
Like get a bottle of vodka,

93
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:08,740
a six pack of Baltic,

94
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,130
go knock on their door.

95
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:10,941
Now mind you,

96
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:12,140
I speak no Russian at the time,

97
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:14,180
no rushing because I had never
studied in any of the classes.

98
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,600
So first night there and knock on Igor
in Sasha's room and they're having a

99
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,820
party in there like fucking all
their friends are in their room.

100
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,680
They lived right next to me and Kendra,

101
00:02:21,681 --> 00:02:22,141
my teacher,

102
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:23,390
and lived across the hall from Igor.

103
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,920
So knock on their door,

104
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,311
eager,

105
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,220
opens the door and he
looks like a fucking thug.

106
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,940
He's got,

107
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,700
he's got like a wife
beater on a cigarette,

108
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,740
a beer and he just looks at
me in Russia and he just goes,

109
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,140
Shh,

110
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,973
store.

111
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,760
And now as the second he
says that I start panicking.

112
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,140
All the phrases I had in my head that I
was trying to say all disappear and all

113
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:45,560
I say that you are in
Russian is I am the machine,

114
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,150
you know?

115
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,900
And so,

116
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,561
but I just said,

117
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:52,394
Ya machine though.

118
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,820
And he went stall and that
now I don't know what I said,

119
00:02:55,821 --> 00:02:56,061
I'm like,

120
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:56,210
did it,

121
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,721
what did I just say?

122
00:02:56,721 --> 00:02:57,554
I'll fuck you up.

123
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:57,801
Like,

124
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,250
and I go,

125
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,491
I go,

126
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,230
I am the machine.

127
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,920
And he goes,

128
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,700
say it again.

129
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:00,971
I said,

130
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,804
I have let me see him.

131
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,760
And then he starts laughing and he
brings me into the room and he's like,

132
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,450
hold on,

133
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,140
say it again.

134
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,070
And so I say it to the room,

135
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:06,940
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.

136
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,170
I'm like,

137
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,260
Oh,

138
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,901
I'm the machine.

139
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,231
And they're like,

140
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,090
you're the machine.

141
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,540
I'm like on the machine.

142
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,190
I said that all fucking
night with these guys.

143
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,960
That's the communication we had.

144
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,230
As I said on the machine and Igor
and Sasha and I became best friends,

145
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:17,710
right?

146
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,850
We did everything together.

147
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:19,990
If we went on a field trip,

148
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,500
they would tell me,

149
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,881
machine,

150
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,110
you don't need to go on the field trips.

151
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
Come drink with us.

152
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,240
So now,

153
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,200
uh,

154
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,280
cut to one day,

155
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,110
we have to take a train to Moscow.

156
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,190
No different mob.

157
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,840
Ran The train to Moscow and a driven Tro,

158
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,410
tro Marbury and Moscow and Igor or Sascha.

159
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,060
We're not allowed to cross
boundaries and it's all me.

160
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,361
They said,

161
00:03:37,361 --> 00:03:38,050
listen,

162
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,801
we're not going to go with you,

163
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,670
but we've taken care of you.

164
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:44,110
We've talked to the mobsters on the
train and in Moscow because we had to pay

165
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,640
them too.

166
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,310
They had,

167
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,570
they weren't allowed to come with you.

168
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,470
There weren't allowed to come with us.

169
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,680
And we're paying a different mob
now to protect us on the train,

170
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:53,050
make a different mob to
protect us in Moscow.

171
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,891
Holy Shit.

172
00:03:53,891 --> 00:03:55,000
So they said,

173
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,721
we've taken care of it,

174
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,411
don't worry about it.

175
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:00,310
So they take me to the train and
they introduced me to our tune.

176
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:00,401
Who?

177
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:00,911
Gangsters?

178
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:01,330
Igor.

179
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,163
Igor.

180
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:03,820
Igor.

181
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,050
Where do you three words
at a Ford Dude's Igor.

182
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,300
And there's not a lot of names in Russia.

183
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:07,721
It's Alex.

184
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,554
Igor or Sascha.

185
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,130
What about fuel?

186
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,963
So,

187
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,973
so Igor,

188
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,003
Igor,

189
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,390
my Igor says,

190
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,224
so these are yours.

191
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,490
This is the machine.

192
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,690
If you give them alcohol,

193
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,590
you'll have a great time.

194
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,870
So even when you are
like through the roof,

195
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:20,170
they're like,

196
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,680
awesome.

197
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,041
Don't worry,

198
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,880
we've taken care of you.

199
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,560
We were sitting in first class.

200
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,730
You're not sitting with your class,

201
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,320
you're sitting in first class to Moscow.

202
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,280
And I'm like,

203
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:27,851
Holy Shit.

204
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:28,690
This is what I'm talking about.

205
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:29,620
And I bring another guy,

206
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:30,340
John Bolshoi,

207
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:30,821
big John.

208
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:34,000
I bring him with me to go sit
in first class and sure enough,

209
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:34,151
man,

210
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm wearing fucking FirstClass.

211
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,370
Just meet these two.

212
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:36,651
Igor,

213
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,260
is John the conductor?

214
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,500
I shit you not the conductor
before the train takes off.

215
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:42,700
Comes into the room.

216
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,720
I swear to you,

217
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,110
rips off the band on this thing says
this is a present for the machine.

218
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,940
It would be an honor
to do a shot with you.

219
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,631
And I'm like,

220
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:50,320
Whoa,

221
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,250
this is a fucking right.

222
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,170
So I do a shot with its conductor and we
pound this vodka within like fucking 30

223
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:56,831
45 minutes.

224
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,251
We're done.

225
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:01,720
All the vodka in the room were drinking
hard and my classes all in coach and I'm

226
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:04,570
sitting in first class and even
Negro like let's go get more vodka.

227
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,450
And I'm like done.

228
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,620
They,

229
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,850
these guys run the fucking train.

230
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,661
So we get up,

231
00:05:07,661 --> 00:05:10,870
we walk into the bar cart
and a biggie or says machine,

232
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,880
Grandpa Paulo grab,

233
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,990

234
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,411
And I'm like,

235
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:15,244
that's bread.

236
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm understanding Russia.

237
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,110
He's like,

238
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,531
grab some,

239
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,580
see it as cheese.

240
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,210
I'm like,

241
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,050
I'm learning Russian.

242
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:20,411
I'm looking at,

243
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:21,340
John is standing behind me.

244
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:21,590
He's like,

245
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,300
Eh.

246
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:22,930
He's like gratified.

247
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,261
Can I go?

248
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:23,921
I know that one.

249
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:24,670
And he's like,

250
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,510
grab all the money,

251
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,560
grab all the approvals.

252
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:26,861
And I go,

253
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:27,670
what?

254
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,980
I look around and were
robbing the bar cart.

255
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,920
What the,

256
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,680
the bartender standing like this.

257
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,830
Everyone's standing against the wall
and I'm sitting behind the bar with a

258
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:38,260
handful of rubles of Bollenbach
in a thing of bread going,

259
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,460
holy fuck.

260
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,511
John looks at me.

261
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:41,200
And he's like,

262
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:41,651
just take it.

263
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,840
Let's go take all the fucking
cash out of the bar cart,

264
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,320
not making eye contact.

265
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,433
And they're their lunches.

266
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:49,900
It's the mob.

267
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,670
They ran everything in Russia.

268
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:52,330
Everything.

269
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:52,780
Wow.

270
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,320
And so we get done and we'd go back to
our room and it's a totally different

271
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:56,710
energy,

272
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,360
like very like very sketchy,

273
00:05:59,390 --> 00:05:59,830
you know.

274
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,790
And I'm free talks.

275
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,091
I'm like,

276
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:02,420
fuck,

277
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,430
I just robbed the car like no
one else saw anyone rubbed.

278
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,870
The bark are except for me.

279
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,890
And my teacher vow,

280
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,480
who's at the time was our chaperone,

281
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,470
didn't speak any Russian.

282
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,940
She comes to our first class cart,

283
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,800
opens the door and says,

284
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,030
I need to talk to you right now.

285
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,410
And I was like,

286
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:15,751
listen.

287
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:16,041
And she goes,

288
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,960
I told you that you're in big trouble.

289
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:18,530
You I,

290
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,170
my classmate,

291
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,360
your classmates had told me what happened.

292
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,860
Big Ego.

293
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,740
It takes a sip of vodka,

294
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,790
spits in her eyes and goes,

295
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,350
no one talks to the machine like that.

296
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,040
I'm like,

297
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,880
whoa.

298
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,630
He spit vodka in her eyes,

299
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,180
fucking it is,

300
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,210
and then shuts the door and
then looks at me and he says,

301
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:32,960
don't worry,

302
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,793
I got you.

303
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,480
When it gets dark,

304
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,380
we're going to have a lot of fun.

305
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,240
And he pulls out a thing of keys.

306
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,070
He's got keys to the whole
fucking train and he's like,

307
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,750
we're going to rob everyone when the,

308
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,430
when it gets dark now I'm like,

309
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,971
fuck,

310
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:44,804
what did I get myself?

311
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,610
Like this is bad news,

312
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,600
bad fucking news.

313
00:06:47,601 --> 00:06:50,180
So we get stark and sure enough,

314
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,130
then we start robbing the train,

315
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,810
go through my class first and
we'd fucking open the door,

316
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,700
the little eagle rock crawl
and pull the bags out.

317
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,760
John and I would go through them and
try not to steal like anything important

318
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,290
and Biggie or would stand guard.

319
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:01,370
And if anyone woke up,

320
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,340
he'd take us civil vodka
and spit it in their face.

321
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:05,780
And it was,

322
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:05,961
I mean,

323
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:06,621
it's sketchy now.

324
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,161
It's sketchy.

325
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:07,840
It's not even fun.

326
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,590
They low are these guys aren't fucking no,

327
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:09,711
no,

328
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:09,861
no.

329
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,431
They're loaded though.

330
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:10,971
They're hammered.

331
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:11,804
Piss drunk.

332
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,040
We robbed my whole class.

333
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,641
And then,

334
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,240
uh,

335
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,740
and then we ended up,

336
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,560
they ended up taking off and going into
the car and me and John are sitting in,

337
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,551
in the first class,

338
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,091
conscious thinking,

339
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:20,511
we're fucked,

340
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:20,721
man.

341
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:21,111
We're fucked.

342
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,980
We robbed the train.

343
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,220
We've probed the bar cart and they come
back and they're just fucking angry.

344
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:25,491
Drunk,

345
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:25,971
like Piss,

346
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:26,804
angry drunk.

347
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,850
We pull in a Moscow and my teacher,

348
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:29,570
Val,

349
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:29,870
uh,

350
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,501
comes to the door,

351
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,334
opens it and said,

352
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:32,001
I'm just sending,

353
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:32,181
you know,

354
00:07:32,181 --> 00:07:33,050
we've called the police.

355
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:33,921
So it was like,

356
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:34,700
fuck.

357
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,690
So Igor,

358
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,141
Igor,

359
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:36,441
Igor,

360
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:36,651
like,

361
00:07:36,651 --> 00:07:37,070
fuck it.

362
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,461
Don't worry.

363
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:38,001
Fuck the police.

364
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:38,481
Fuck the police.

365
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,200
This is Russia.

366
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,370
Who the fuck she thinks she is?

367
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,300
This isn't America.

368
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,140
This is Russia.

369
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,973
We run everything.

370
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,690
I'm like,

371
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,210
Ugh,

372
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm going to fucking go to the gulag.

373
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,113
Sure enough.

374
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:47,991
Sure enough,

375
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:48,380
man.

376
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,000
The cops are sitting on the,

377
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,893
on the middle,

378
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,610
like the middle,

379
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,001
you know,

380
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:54,560
were people get off the train,

381
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:55,550
that little receiving area.

382
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,720
My class is sitting there,

383
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,381
my whole class,

384
00:07:57,381 --> 00:07:58,101
or in the pajamas,

385
00:07:58,101 --> 00:07:58,850
they're crying.

386
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,600
Their bags had been gone through their
fucking giving statements to the cops and

387
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,830
the cops are writing them down.

388
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,890
And I'm sitting with Igor and
eager and John in the fucking car,

389
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,540
and they're just still drinking
and smoking and they're like,

390
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,200
fuck this,

391
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:09,441
fuck,

392
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:10,550
this will take you
there to this right now.

393
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,330
They walk outside out to the cops
and start yelling at the cops.

394
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,661
And I'm like,

395
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,494
motherfucker,

396
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,150
this is not how I would've
taken care of this.

397
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:17,780
Just,

398
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,180
I don't know.

399
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,130
I don't even know what they're saying.

400
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,960
But they were just shouting and
the cops were shouting back.

401
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,540
And then finally biggie or just
starts pointing at me and I'm like,

402
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,751
oh,

403
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:25,310
he's been in this whole
fucking thing on me.

404
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,500
Like I'm going down for the whole thing.

405
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,960
And then the cop starts pointing
to me and telling me exists,

406
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,350
is it?

407
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,441
Yeah,

408
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:31,730
it's by the ocean or whatever he's saying,

409
00:08:31,731 --> 00:08:32,630
come here right now.

410
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,400
So I fucking walk out.

411
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:37,370
And it's that moment where you
find the hash on your body.

412
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:37,731
You know,

413
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:39,530
they find it and you're
going to jail forever.

414
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,800
Is that that moment that walk we were
asshole gets cold and you're like,

415
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:43,634
this is it.

416
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,720
Express fucking.

417
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,613
That's the moment.

418
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,900
And I walk all the way across
this little fucking trailer,

419
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,400
get to him.

420
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,580
I get right up to the cop and
the cop looks at me and he goes,

421
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,650
I understand you're the machine.

422
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,591
I was like,

423
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:55,741
yeah.

424
00:08:55,741 --> 00:08:56,071
And he goes,

425
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:56,401

426
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:57,360
you party with us.

427
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,450
So then we went out and
partied with these cops.

428
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,800
So the cops did nothing.

429
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:02,634
Fucking nothing.

430
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,140
They were so excited to meet the machine.

431
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:04,821
What it,

432
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:05,700

433
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:06,211

435
00:09:06,551 --> 00:09:07,384
it was,

436
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,130
it was a nickname there.

437
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,410
No one funny in Russia.

438
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,273
Is that what it is?

439
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:11,850
No,

440
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,360
there was no,

441
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,260
there was no humor.

442
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,780
There was no so thing with you.

443
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,810
Is that what it is?

444
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,890
Is No one funny.

445
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,510
And then you come along
and you're hilarious.

446
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:18,931
So they like,

447
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:19,730
we're partying with you.

448
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:19,951
Yeah.

449
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:20,251
And I was,

450
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,120
and I was just loud.

451
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,650
Like there's not a lot
of Lao people like you.

452
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,650
Would you be willing to move to
Russia to be their bitch and to like,

453
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,550
Nah Dude,

454
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,140
those guys scared me one night the
guy did you party with these guys?

455
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,530
I partied with Igor and you were on the
train only and then I partied with the

456
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:39,531
cops in Moscow with John and then for one
night then we hid from them cause they

457
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:40,260
want it.

458
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,093
They like the cops.

459
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,170
The cops were,

460
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:43,800
were scary.

461
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,480
More scary than the gangsters because
they could not get in trouble like that.

462
00:09:48,481 --> 00:09:48,561
You,

463
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,100
they were like crying my
cop car and you're like,

464
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,240
what the fuck drive my comp cost.

465
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:54,710
Fucking do they drive on the
left side of the right side?

466
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,853
Same side as us.

467
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,300
I don't remember.

468
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,980
I was there for three months.

469
00:09:58,981 --> 00:09:59,814
You'd think I'd know.

470
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:00,721
I have no idea.

471
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:02,460
I was drawing on the same side as us,

472
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,370
but I mean like the whole
experience in Russia was just amuse.

473
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,130
Just,

474
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,160
I remember one time we
[inaudible] going to,

475
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:14,370
Sasha had said they were going to get a
boat for us for Russian may day or Labor

476
00:10:14,371 --> 00:10:15,000
Day.

477
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,511
And they're like,

478
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:15,601
yeah,

479
00:10:15,601 --> 00:10:16,434
we got to,

480
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,513
um,

481
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,770
they're going to have a big
boat for our whole class.

482
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:20,700
We're all going out in the boat.

483
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,350
So I get up early for the day,

484
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:25,110
we're going out of the boat and I go
over to eagers room and Igor is eating

485
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:25,771
dried fish,

486
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:26,910
drinking beers.

487
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:27,901
And I was like,

488
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:28,260
what's better?

489
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,591
And he's like,

490
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:29,220

491
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,461
I go,

492
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:29,581

493
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:29,821
And he goes,

494
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:30,654
we got no boat.

495
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:31,021
Like,

496
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,411
what do you mean?

497
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:31,621
He goes,

498
00:10:31,621 --> 00:10:31,920
I've,

499
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,210
I've tried everything
to try to get a boat.

500
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:34,170
I can't get a fucking boat.

501
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,100
And we've promised the class of boat
for the tour is supposed to have a boat.

502
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,000
And so we're like,

503
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,431
oh fuck.

504
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:39,811
And he goes,

505
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:41,550
and then all a sudden the
phone rings and he goes,

506
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,413
we got a boat.

507
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,201
I go,

508
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:43,680
we do.

509
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:43,951
And he goes,

510
00:10:43,951 --> 00:10:44,460
yeah.

511
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,230
So we start walking to the dock,

512
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,810
we're carrying a fucking big case of beer,

513
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,050
my whole class cameras and fucking do
their little passports around their neck.

514
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,940
And one of his buddies just
walks up and he's like,

515
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,451
hey.

516
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:54,781
And he's like,

517
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,614
hey.

518
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:58,890
And then we just get to the dock and
there's a boat there and we just get on it

519
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:02,340
and take off and halfway
through we realize like I
just stole the fucking boat.

520
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:03,960
He just stole the boat.

521
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:07,470
And he was like rushing
must be just fucking crazy.

522
00:11:07,471 --> 00:11:08,310
Insane.

523
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,070
We went to,

524
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,010
went to a big mob boss party
one night and he was like,

525
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,641
tells them my boss.

526
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:14,130
He goes,

527
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,911
this is the machine,

528
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:15,744
this is the guy.

529
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,190
Does this all happen?

530
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,031
It just was loud.

531
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:18,330
And then,

532
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,040
and then I was partying with Eagle
and Sasha so much that like that.

533
00:11:23,041 --> 00:11:24,390
And they just tell their friends,

534
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:24,481
oh,

535
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:25,320
you gotta meet this guy,

536
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,191
you gotta meet this guy.

537
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:27,024
He's so funny.

538
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,610
We're going to have to drink
with you and then moved it down.

539
00:11:29,611 --> 00:11:31,080
We're going to do shots
with Bert Kreischer.

540
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,891
You gotta be careful,

541
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:32,180
man.

542
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,470
You.

543
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,950
You are selling yourself as
this incredible fun party
guy and everyone's going

544
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:37,790
to want to do shots with you.

545
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:37,980
Oh,

546
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,310
I don't,

547
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,531
I'm,

548
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,364
I'm fucking,

549
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,190
are you friends with Igor on Facebook now?

550
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:41,460
Have these,

551
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,293
I tried to find them

552
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:44,680
on Twitter.

553
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,270
[inaudible]

554
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,170
Alrighty.
