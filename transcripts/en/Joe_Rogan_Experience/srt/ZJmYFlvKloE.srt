1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,760
We're good.
We're live art.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,540
What does that echo thing going on 
anymore?

3
00:00:06,541 --> 00:00:08,880
We'd killed that were good.
Nick,

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,870
how are you buddy?
Pretty good.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:12,180
Well thank you.
So you've got this hat on.

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,720
Nick.
Curse on that.

7
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,810
I'm saying not last name.
Curtis in Carson.

8
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,420
Yeah,
like Chris and have you.

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,480
You train a Hofeld Osan.
Joe's a Russell on providing the cough 

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,570
and you've got his hat on roofs.
Salons hat on.

11
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,620
It says what does it say again?
Ratzy bowler hats and in Russian I 

12
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:34,190
believe that translates to something 
like young warrior or young fighter,

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,260
something like that.
That's funny because I ran into a couple

14
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:42,261
of Russians the other day and asked them
if they knew what it meant and they 

15
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:42,261
didn't even know.
They just need.

16
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:44,110
The last part was fighter and they 
didn't know that the first apartment.

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,180
So I don't know.
That guy is a character providing the 

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,180
crops.

19
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,780
One of my favorite fighters to watch 
because he can't be in a boring fight.

20
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,830
He doesn't have it at him.
I mean that guy fights like the most 

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,320
exciting style of fighting inboxing to 
that.

22
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:01,020
It just comes at you.
You know,

23
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:03,550
he's just an animal.
Unfortunately.

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,400
He takes a little too much punishment 
though.

25
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,010
Yeah.
Well he's almost too brave.

26
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,960
Yeah.
You know,

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,530
almost two brave in too tough,
but fucking not fight with Matisa.

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,330
Oh my God.
That was insane.

29
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:17,190
Oh my God.
That was what everybody was hoping.

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,530
Floyd Mayweather.
It would be made with a pack.

31
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:24,531
Yeah,
that's what everybody was hoping it 

32
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:24,531
would be.
I was like,

33
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:24,531
you know,
you guys are out of your mind.

34
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:25,380
You don't know what you're about to 
watch.

35
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,240
You guys are spending millions of 
dollars.

36
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,800
It's going to be like the biggest gate 
ever.

37
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:33,801
And what you're going to watch is a 
floyd mayweather exhibition on movement 

38
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:37,140
and Jabbing and straight rights lead.
Right?

39
00:01:37,141 --> 00:01:39,570
Hands clench.
Get out of the way.

40
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,040
I mean,
that's what you're going to say.

41
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,750
That's,
that's exactly what it was.

42
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:44,430
But providing a cough.
God,

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,810
how do you think the guys feel the,
uh,

44
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,500
tuned into the child's junior fight that
night and miss the Monica?

45
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:52,710
They were silly.

46
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,400
I watched both.
I mean,

47
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,540
that's the beautiful thing about dvrs 
Chavez Jr.

48
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,230
Looks like he's phoning it in.
Yeah.

49
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,560
He just does not.
Look like the same guy like daddy 

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,540
wouldn't when he was younger and much 
more exciting and just looked,

51
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,900
looked like a real promising future 
champion.

52
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:12,120
He just doesn't,
doesn't have the volume anymore.

53
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,690
Doesn't look like he's in shape.
Fighting much heavier,

54
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,590
right?
Yeah.

55
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,530
I'm a tsa and providing a cup fight with
something else.

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,630
So you're a strength and conditioning 
coach.

57
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,850
And one of the reasons whY I wanted to 
call you and here is because I am 

58
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,500
absolutely fascinated by the marina 
bitches,

59
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,620
right?
The guys who taught you a lot of what 

60
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:33,800
you know.
And um,

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I'm also fascinated by just tHe 
boundaries of human potential when it 

62
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,800
comes to strength and conditioning 
because as,

63
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,430
as an analyst,
as a guy who sits there and watch his 

64
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,221
fights and I've seen,
I don't even know how many fights would 

65
00:02:49,221 --> 00:02:51,870
have probably professionally called 
several thousand fights at this point.

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,460
I don't even know how many it's been 
really.

67
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,240
It's been at least 1500 or something of 
the best fights ever.

68
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:02,450
Right.
And you start seeing things over and 

69
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,821
over and over again.
And occasionally there's these outliers 

70
00:03:05,821 --> 00:03:10,650
and these outliers are guys who just 
have way more gas than anybody else.

71
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:17,010
Guys who have way more ability to push 
deep into the fourth and fifth rounds 

72
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,230
and you just wonder,
like how much of what we're seeing in 

73
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,240
terms of what a fighter can do inside 
the octagon or inside the ring,

74
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:28,270
how much of it is,
how much endurance they have.

75
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:31,030
And I maintain that.
It's a significant amount.

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,770
AbsoLutely.
I think it's,

77
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,950
I think it's everything.
It might be 90 percent of it or 

78
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,741
something like that at least because it 
seems like everybody is pretty skillful 

79
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:45,210
once they get to the upper levels of the
ufc when you're dealing with a pedes or 

80
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,800
a dose on joe's or all,
all across the board.

81
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,620
When you,
when you hit those high level guys,

82
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:55,860
they're all very skillful and some are 
better at certain aspects of fighting 

83
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,041
than other.
But it seems like the ones who can win 

84
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,300
and win the way,
the way pedis and dos just went down the

85
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,020
way.
Dos anjos just dominated paddocks,

86
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:08,021
right?
You have to have a fucking insane gas 

87
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:08,021
tank.
Absolutely.

88
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:12,370
Um,
I don't know if you've see my instagram 

89
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,370
and seeing some of the videos I did.
Oh yeah,

90
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:12,370
yeah.
I'm,

91
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,990
I'm a fascinated by it.
So yeah.

92
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,580
Rafael,
when he first came to me,

93
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,090
this was after the [inaudible] fight.
He'd tried several other strength and 

94
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,720
conditioning coaches as we came to me 
about two or three workouts in.

95
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,290
He's like,
wow,

96
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:25,570
this is already amazing.
I feel the difference.

97
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,350
And that's when I began to assess like,
like a longterm plan.

98
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
So like when I first get a new athlete,
I don't just look at the immediate 

99
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,010
fight,
I look where I want,

100
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,451
I want them to be about a year from now,
six months from now and three or four 

101
00:04:39,451 --> 00:04:39,451
fights from that,
whatever.

102
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
But I kind of knew like some things that
were holding him back and areas that 

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,090
weren't trained properly that we needed 
to rectify.

104
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,610
What do you see when you,
when you start working out with a guy,

105
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,670
like how do you,
how do you first of all realize it?

106
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,820
you know,
what I'd like to do,

107
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:56,821
like this is something that the 
marinovich has did with bj penn was the 

108
00:04:56,821 --> 00:04:57,610
first thing they did was they got a 
heart rate monitor on them,

109
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,940
so,
and then they put them through sparring 

110
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,381
to find out what areas tax them the most
and then that's what they would kind of 

111
00:05:04,381 --> 00:05:07,670
designed the camp towards.
So if wrestling taxes you the most,

112
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,300
so that's the energy system we need to 
train the most for you.

113
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:11,500
So,
you know,

114
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:16,501
like with bj,
he never had any problem with his 

115
00:05:16,501 --> 00:05:18,541
longterm arabic.
It was always as anaerobic energy 

116
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:18,541
systems.

117
00:05:18,541 --> 00:05:19,640
So it was always sprinting.
Exactly.

118
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,570
The big burst,
short burst and long bursts.

119
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,640
So entire amount.
The issue was the recovery from short 

120
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:27,640
burst.
Absolutely.

121
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,480
And uh,
yeah,

122
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,510
exactly.
So if,

123
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,530
if your,
if your anaerobic systems aren't chain 

124
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,631
properly,
you won't get that recovery in between 

125
00:05:36,631 --> 00:05:38,491
the burst and some guys will go their 
entire career without ever correcting 

126
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:42,931
that.
And you're always exactly in this weird 

127
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:43,510
limbo state where you're scared to push 
it too hard.

128
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,890
Right?
Exactly.

129
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,190
Now you take a guy like hoffeld dos 
anjos that has beaten donald cerrone.

130
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,070
So when he came to you,
who's already world class one of the 

131
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,341
best fighters in the division,
I think it was ranked 10th when I 

132
00:05:59,341 --> 00:05:59,341
started with

133
00:05:59,341 --> 00:05:59,341
him.
So he's a good fighter.

134
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,270
And that time we began training for the 
roost.

135
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:07,271
Um,
he was scheduled to fight roost on copy 

136
00:06:07,271 --> 00:06:07,970
of exactly and we did a pretty much a 
full training camp.

137
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:12,971
We did six weeks of training and then 
colby law pulled out I think two weeks 

138
00:06:12,971 --> 00:06:15,080
prior to the fight with a hurt finger or
something.

139
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:20,590
And so,
so then we had a break for about three 

140
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,170
weeks in between and then he got the 
news that he's gonna fight khabib.

141
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:26,120
So he did another full training camp and
prior to the cubby fight I actually left

142
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,570
for weeks before the fight.
So we stopped strength and conditioning 

143
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,901
for weeks.
So he missed the complete peak to peak 

144
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:35,630
fanny,
a peak training phase of the,

145
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,760
of the conditioning program.
And I think that's one of the reasons 

146
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:40,760
why you lost that.
Partially.

147
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:45,681
Yeah.
I feel a little bit of a responsibility 

148
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:45,681
for that.

149
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:45,681
Sure.
But,

150
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:48,841
uh,
also you have to admit habib number 

151
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:48,950
grumet off is a fucking monster.
He is.

152
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,910
He's a monster.
He's a,

153
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,240
he's a good fighter.
uh,

154
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,410
I think,
and I hate to make excuses,

155
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,800
but I think if people understood like 
what referral went through before that 

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,460
fight,
they would be a little more accepting of

157
00:07:01,461 --> 00:07:04,240
the fact that he might kick khabib's ass
next time they fight.

158
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,260
You know,
a lot of people are already saying 

159
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,741
kebabs.
A new champion I did roughly almost had 

160
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:14,321
his fricking eye gouged out.
THe whites of his eyes like this was 

161
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:18,011
during the training camp.
So he had to take another couple of 

162
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:18,011
weeks off in the middle of the training 
camp.

163
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:20,810
The whites of his eyes were literally 
hanging down from guys fingernails where

164
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,740
he though they're sparring,
they got poked his finger nails into his

165
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:29,741
eyes and the whites of the eyes were,
were stripped of it were hanging down 

166
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:29,741
below his eyelid.

167
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:29,990
Oh god.
Yeah.

168
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,340
And then so what they do to fix that,
I guess they just trimmed it off and 

169
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:35,960
yeah,
I just turned it off.

170
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:37,000
And then let.
Yeah,

171
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,520
wait a minute.
You could trim the whites of your eye 

172
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,520
level.
Apparently.

173
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:42,650
God,
yeah.

174
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:48,190
Rafael is a monster.
Like people don't understand is because 

175
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,130
the guy had fingernails.
Fingernails.

176
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:54,131
Exactly.
And there's farming and he went to push 

177
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:57,230
them back or something.
Two fingers went right into his eye and 

178
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:58,980
know,
you know,

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,730
obviously he's not going to put that out
there on the internet and show people,

180
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,690
hey,
look at my fucked up.

181
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:06,530
I or she should not.
Have you seen his ear?

182
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,040
I don't know if you saw the picture of 
his ear recent.

183
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,530
Uh,
no.

184
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,500
This is the same thing leading up to the
khabib fight.

185
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,930
Prior to that,
his ear was ripped off in the cage.

186
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:20,320
So it got stuck in between.
A couple of the links have seen that 

187
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,230
picture and his ear was hanging on by a 
thread.

188
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,510
It is jesus christ.
So this is all going on during training 

189
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,340
camp.
Wow.

190
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,700
One thing after the other.
And then I leave for weeks out.

191
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,780
Not to mention he switched to a vegan 
diet.

192
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,530
What's?
Yeah,

193
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,910
for that fight.
Why did he do that?

194
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:40,040
I have no idea who told,
told him to do that.

195
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:43,130
No idea.
Do you have any response?

196
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,010
I just ate vegan lunch by the way.
So talking shit.

197
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,250
I eat a lot of vegan food.
I talk a lot of shit about vegans,

198
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:50,350
but my,
my,

199
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:55,620
my diet consists mostly of vegan meals 
and murdered animals are combined those 

200
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,160
two.
That's pretty

201
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,470
interesting.
I just,

202
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,480
I feel like you can't get.
It's very difficult to get everything 

203
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,441
you need from just vegetables,
but I feel like you really can't eat 

204
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,861
enough vegetables.
I think vegetables are super important 

205
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:10,200
for you.
I think that it's one of the main issues

206
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:14,370
that people suffer from when it comes to
health anD nutrition.

207
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:19,371
even a lot of vegan people,
they too much breads and pastas and rice

208
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:24,771
and things along those lines.
And I think you need a lot of 

209
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,931
vegetables.
I think it's super important for it to 

210
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:26,931
change is the way I think and feel.

211
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:27,350
Have you ever tried to supplement called
dim?

212
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,820
What is it?
Dim?

213
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,580
No,
what is it?

214
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,550
What does this diane doll me thinking?
Hmm.

215
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,920
And it's supposedly like a concentration
all the cruciferous vegetables,

216
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,050
but it helps lower like estrogen levels.
Scott phytoestrogen.

217
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,090
So it helps.
It helps your body metabolize estrogen.

218
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,400
And I tell you what,
it actually works.

219
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,740
It gives you gnarly gas,
but it works.

220
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,620
I don't know if I'm willing to make that
trade off.

221
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,170
I did.
It's worth it.

222
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,370
Take it on an empty stomach.
Back room.

223
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,320
Yeah.
Jesus.

224
00:10:01,321 --> 00:10:02,280
Crazily.
Yeah.

225
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,020
Don't tell certain people that I know 
that.

226
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:09,021
Not blowing Farts on folks.
The other night my fiance and my baby 

227
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:13,431
woke me up.
He was laughing or that,

228
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,520
that poop?
No,

229
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,010
it was very funny.
So,

230
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,140
so who talked a dos anjos into going 
vegan?

231
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,130
Uh,
you know,

232
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,930
I don't know to be honest.
I don't remember.

233
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,770
I think he just kinda something he 
wanted to try and his own and,

234
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,520
and,
and if you notice in that fight he looks

235
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:34,521
quite a bit smaller too.
Like his shoulders look smaller and he 

236
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:34,521
looks

237
00:10:34,521 --> 00:10:34,670
loss of muscle mass.
Well,

238
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,320
you know,
there's some health benefits to eating a

239
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,610
lot of vegetables.
I just don't,

240
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:41,690
I don't think there's enough evidence to
promote veganism.

241
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,170
I just don't think it's worth the.
I think the,

242
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:47,960
the tradeoff is too significant and I 
think your body,

243
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:53,010
I mean we're omnivores,
it's just the way it is and especially 

244
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,901
when you're dealing with high level 
athletes that are blowing down a lot of 

245
00:10:55,901 --> 00:11:00,581
muscle tissue on a regular basis.
So a lot of recovery that needs to be 

246
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:03,861
done.
If you're just a regular person going 

247
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:03,861
through life without any significant 
stress on your body,

248
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:04,420
you probably can get,
get through,

249
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,490
fine with it.
But I think for high level athletes are 

250
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:09,590
very difficult to find a vegan,
high level athlete,

251
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,050
especially in an explosive combat 
sports.

252
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,930
Um,
so you don't have anything to do with 

253
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:17,930
the diet stuff.

254
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:17,930
If a guy needs my help,
then yeah,

255
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:22,891
I'll do it.
But a lot of these guys now have 

256
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,361
nutritionist,
so that kind of takes a lot of work off 

257
00:11:24,361 --> 00:11:24,430
of my back workload off my back.
But

258
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,940
it's funny because fighters have a short
window of time to be the best,

259
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,340
right?
I mean a fighter's career,

260
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,970
like somebodY pointed it out once,
I think it was on mixed martial arts.com

261
00:11:34,971 --> 00:11:38,690
that there's like a nine year period 
where a guy can really fight great.

262
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,040
RIght.
And then after that,

263
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:45,550
excuse me,
the wheels just sorta start to fall off 

264
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:45,800
and just the body can only take so much 
finding.

265
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,110
Great.
You think that's a mental Thing though?

266
00:11:48,111 --> 00:11:49,910
Do you think they get too comfortable 
and they loSe it?

267
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,520
It's possible thAt I think that's 
absolutely.

268
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,710
I think why gsp quit at the right time.
You know what I mean?

269
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,770
He's got all these like gq magazine 
things coming up and I don't know how 

270
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,470
much money that guy's work now,
but he doesn't need to fight.

271
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:04,480
Yeah.
Maybe the same thing happened with bj.

272
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:06,760
Maybe he quit a little too late,
but yeah,

273
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:09,380
I think once they get too comfortable,
I think then it's,

274
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:09,830
that's it.

275
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,760
Silver.
It is possible.

276
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:16,380
I think the mental strain of camps is 
absolutely brutal on these guys.

277
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:18,660
I mean,
you would know as good as anybody,

278
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,780
you know,
I've,

279
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:24,781
I've been to high level training camps,
I've watched guys go out and I've 

280
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:26,820
watched guys go do their strength and 
conditioning routines and it's fucking,

281
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:32,170
it's an ungodly.
I barely can get through a fucking yoga 

282
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:32,170
class,
you know,

283
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,840
these,
these guys are doing two a days and 

284
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:35,840
strength and conditioning in the 
morning,

285
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,480
beating the fuck out of each other at 
night and going home and exhausted.

286
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:43,481
And then one of the things that bj said 
about training with the marinda bitches 

287
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:43,560
was,
it was just too much.

288
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,410
Like his performances were legendary,

289
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,280
legendary.
So was,

290
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,690
was it the training really too much read
bj had enough.

291
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:51,920
that's the question to ask.

292
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:53,810
That's a good point.
You know what I mean?

293
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,710
By the time the has got a hold of him,
he'd already had a 10 plus year career.

294
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,030
Exactly.
You know?

295
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,220
Exactly.
You look at that diego sanchez fight,

296
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,370
I maintain.
There's very few people ever that fought

297
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:09,371
at 1:55.
You could fuck with bj when he was in 

298
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:09,830
that mode.
Goddamn he waS a killer.

299
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,290
That.
Exactly.

300
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,900
It's funny because I just talked to 
[inaudible] about this the other day.

301
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,100
No,
I,

302
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:21,101
just to clarify why,
what happened with us and it came down 

303
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:24,761
to what gary explained to me was they'd 
reached a point in training where they 

304
00:13:24,761 --> 00:13:25,430
were doing their strength training in 
the morning.

305
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:30,850
Then they had the spine was going on in 
the afternoons and pj approach them and 

306
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:35,890
you know,
he wasn't like a dick about it or 

307
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:35,890
anything.
It's totally cool.

308
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:35,890
Like,
hey,

309
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:35,890
like,
you know,

310
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,830
how would you guys feel if we did the,
uh,

311
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,970
strength training on another day so that
I can do my sparring,

312
00:13:40,971 --> 00:13:42,230
you know what,
I'm fresh for sparring.

313
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,620
And I think marvin gary took that as,
you know,

314
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:51,250
he wasn't ready for that.
He wasn't at that level yet or they're 

315
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,250
ready to back off the air conditioning 
training.

316
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,560
They don't do that.
so I mean there's a method behind their 

317
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,351
training and it's very rational.
So I think the fact that he was 

318
00:13:59,351 --> 00:13:59,750
questioning them at that point was just 
like,

319
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,400
enough.
Maybe there's some other stuff goIng on.

320
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:06,401
I don't know.
But I think the questioning of their 

321
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:11,050
abilities as trainers at that point,
like as if they didn't know what they 

322
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:12,610
were doing was enough to turn them off 
and kinda well wish.

323
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,130
I think what the,
the mindset of fighters when it comes to

324
00:14:16,131 --> 00:14:21,131
strength conditioning versus versus 
skill work is that it's very important 

325
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:25,250
to stay sharp with the skill work.
It's very difficult to do that if you're

326
00:14:25,251 --> 00:14:27,200
already exhausted from strength and 
conditioning.

327
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,090
Right.
So how do you find that balance?

328
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:34,091
Is it,
is it smarter to do the skill work in 

329
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:36,851
the morning and then the strength and 
conditioning later on the evening or 

330
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:36,851
like how,
how do you,

331
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:40,670
how do you find that balance?
Are we talking about in general here?

332
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,820
Are we talking about general?
What I would perceive for,

333
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,320
for bj either are either we're like if,
if I was closer and closer to my side,

334
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,110
if I was,
is a,

335
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,980
I probably would've done the same thIng 
and maybe

336
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,440
tone down the sparring a little bit 
already.

337
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:59,441
Phenomenally skilled.
Maybe the one of the most skilled 

338
00:14:59,441 --> 00:14:59,840
fighters we've ever seen in the ufc.
I was a fan of his before.

339
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:04,841
He was even in the ufc,
I told people this dude when I saw him 

340
00:15:04,841 --> 00:15:05,630
at tournament's as a blue belt,
black belt in jujitsu,

341
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,710
by the way.
Uh,

342
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,490
so I've seen these guys from the start.
I said,

343
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:12,020
this kid's going to be freaking 
phenomenal.

344
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,840
You said the same thing about nick diaz 
two years ago,

345
00:15:14,841 --> 00:15:16,040
and I was,
when he was a purple belt,

346
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,840
I'd seen him at tournament.
It was a blue belt even.

347
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,160
I'd be like,
this guy,

348
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:24,161
when he gets you watch,
he's going to be a fighter and he's 

349
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:24,161
going to be phenomenal.
Like tear these guys up.

350
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:27,680
So pj skill has never been in question 
right there that tells you,

351
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,740
hey,
conditioning has always been the issue 

352
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:32,740
with bj.

353
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,710
I've never seen him outclass like skill 
wise by anybody,

354
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:39,210
you know.
It's always been a strength and 

355
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,210
conditioning.
That's,

356
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:39,210
that's costume.
His fights.

357
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,450
What did you think when you saw his last
fight with frankie edgar?

358
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:46,451
Would he adopted that?
Very strange blown away at how stupid 

359
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:46,451
that was?
Well,

360
00:15:46,451 --> 00:15:47,630
I mean that was just ridiculous.
Like why would you.

361
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,660
You're pretty much.
I just had this conversation with 

362
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:55,121
freddie roach about a month ago.
he told me bj penn was one of the best 

363
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,271
boxers he's ever trained.
Really like even out of the boxers in 

364
00:15:58,271 --> 00:16:01,241
the gym.
Bj penn was one of the best natural 

365
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:01,241
boxers he's ever trained for folks who 
don't know what

366
00:16:01,241 --> 00:16:06,120
we're talking about.
Bj had adopted this very strange style 

367
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,570
that I'd never seen before.
Whereas feet were very close together 

368
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,260
and he was just moving really ending up,
right?

369
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:16,261
Like iT's a raf almost completely 
straight up instead of like the classic 

370
00:16:16,261 --> 00:16:19,210
style of a stand up fighter.
I mean there's various it,

371
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,960
there's variables when it comes to 
standup fighting for mma because you,

372
00:16:22,961 --> 00:16:27,961
you have a more squared off stance 
because you want to have your hips in 

373
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,751
place to take down defense.
But the classic stances shoulders or a 

374
00:16:30,751 --> 00:16:33,610
pi hands are right by the face,
you know,

375
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:38,030
head movement.
Bj did this weird thing where it just,

376
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,080
he looked like,
like almost like a guy playing 

377
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,250
pretending to be a fighter.
Like he was doing this weird and he had 

378
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,100
said afterwards,
which really bothered me.

379
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,410
He said that he did it to conserve 
energy.

380
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,540
That is again,
conserved energy.

381
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:58,570
There it is again.
I thought he said because his trainers 

382
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,500
really felt that he generated more 
forced that way.

383
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,410
There's no way.
That's insane,

384
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:07,700
but I love whatever conditions there.
You don't need to worry about concerns.

385
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,910
Right,
right.

386
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:14,780
Okay.
So what was the consensus that made them

387
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:19,781
part ways because the performances that 
he put on with them or individuals war 

388
00:17:19,781 --> 00:17:21,830
legendary really work some of the best 
of.

389
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:26,890
WhAt was it?
It florian and then they did the diego 

390
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,401
sanchez fight and then they left about 
five weeks out from the frankie edgar 

391
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:31,310
fight.
Really?

392
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,370
Yeah.
So five weeks at this type of training 

393
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:36,370
needs to be done pretty much up until 
the day of the fight.

394
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,570
So they did train him a little bit for 
the frankie edgar,

395
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,900
three weeks,
maybe four weeks at the most and what 

396
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,971
happened and that's when they had the 
dIscussion about changing up the 

397
00:17:45,971 --> 00:17:49,901
program,
like a can we do the conditioning on 

398
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:50,190
different days and so they just decided

399
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,060
to walk away.
Yeah.

400
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Wow.
It just felt it wasn't going the way 

401
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,640
they want it,
I think.

402
00:17:56,641 --> 00:17:57,750
Yeah,
I think they were.

403
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,990
They respected frankie edgar is that 
this guy's going to be trouble.

404
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,240
This guy's coming to fight,
has got a gas tank.

405
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,010
He's,
he's no pushover,

406
00:18:05,011 --> 00:18:06,630
you know,
and who's a motherfucker.

407
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,020
He's a relentless motherfucker which 
shows you how god damn good uriah 

408
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,060
favorites because they,
you know,

409
00:18:12,061 --> 00:18:17,061
right.
Your rise to fighting one weight class 

410
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:17,061
up,
right.

411
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:17,061
You know,
usually fights it.

412
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:17,910
One 35 finding 1:45
and they,

413
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:21,990
they went five rounds and I mean frankie
won a decision,

414
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:24,840
but there was no point in that fight 
where he was going to finish your Ohio.

415
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,180
No point where you.
I was in significant trouble,

416
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,490
you know,
they were pretty much gone blow for 

417
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,161
blow,
but frankie was getting an edge and 

418
00:18:34,161 --> 00:18:36,611
basically every round,
I think frankie is one of the best 

419
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:40,551
condition guys and I would love to find 
out what he does for his strength and 

420
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,400
conditioning because he's never fucking 
tired.

421
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,550
He's always able to push that same pace 
every round.

422
00:18:44,551 --> 00:18:49,551
And that seems to be what separates the 
greats that truly grades from everybody 

423
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:50,370
else underneath them.

424
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,170
No,
it's funny.

425
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,500
It's a lot of people are talking about 
the dust angeles pettis fight,

426
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,620
but between me and the yield and the 
rest of the world,

427
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,370
in my opinion,
rafael is in better conditioning,

428
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,800
better shape for the benson henderson 
fight.

429
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,820
Really?
Yeah,

430
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,290
absolutely.
He wasn't a fight.

431
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:10,220
He was injured so three weeks out he 
injured his knee and aspiring accident.

432
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:13,220
And so we had to change things up.
We couldn't do any more field work,

433
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:15,080
we couldn't do any writing or anything 
like that.

434
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,650
So we had to kind of modify it.
And that's when you see,

435
00:19:18,651 --> 00:19:23,651
I got them during the sprints on the 
airdyne bicycle and only pretty much 

436
00:19:23,651 --> 00:19:23,870
something safe,
you know,

437
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,870
and uh,
but I had him at like 12,000

438
00:19:26,871 --> 00:19:29,600
feet elevation,
gradually built them up to that.

439
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,590
so we're at high altitude

440
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,280
to the benson henderson fight was 
incredibly impressive because he was the

441
00:19:34,281 --> 00:19:39,281
first guy to ever stopped.
Benson was strikes and benson is just 

442
00:19:39,281 --> 00:19:41,270
notoriously durable,
unbelievably tough,

443
00:19:41,271 --> 00:19:45,240
big for the weight class and,
and dos anjos just jumped all over him.

444
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,450
He had destroyed him,
was a big fight.

445
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,840
It was a big like,
like,

446
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,020
whoa,
this guy's on another level right now.

447
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:56,021
That's why it kind of blew my mind,
like why people pay to keep reminding 

448
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:56,021
you,
but it closer to get sentenced.

449
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,560
I,
it sounds good to us,

450
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,620
but the recording is weird.

451
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,800
I got you.
Sorry.

452
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,590
Don't need to repeat anything.
No,

453
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,300
it's fine.
Okay,

454
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,450
well,
like I said,

455
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,570
I think he was in better shape for the,
for the benson henderson fight,

456
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:14,571
you know,
I don't know why people couldn't see 

457
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:14,571
this coming,
you know,

458
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:14,571
like get a good sense.
Just so good.

459
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,720
Pete.
Me look at how he handled that.

460
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,230
Right.
You know,

461
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,370
brendan,
that she is fucking huge and a killer.

462
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,280
I kids big see how big that is in real 
life.

463
00:20:23,281 --> 00:20:25,140
He's fucking big.
He's a big.

464
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,790
He's,
he's a good size one.

465
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:27,750
80 five.
Right.

466
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,470
and as a seventies fucking huge.
And benson handled him.

467
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,990
Yeah.
So I think people just thought,

468
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,190
hey,
this is a great fight.

469
00:20:35,191 --> 00:20:38,850
I mean I didn't,
I didn't necessarily count dosantos out,

470
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,540
but I certainly didn't think he was 
gonna stop them the way you just fucking

471
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,530
beat his ass.
Yeah,

472
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,920
I thought it was gonna.
I thought it was gonna be a really good 

473
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:48,920
fight.
That's what I thought.

474
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:48,920
I mean

475
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,610
hence pharma champion,
been there with some of the best ever.

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You know,
I've thought this is gonna be a great 

477
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,000
fight.

478
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah,
that's interesting.

479
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,641
I didn't,
I kinda knew like at the end of the 

480
00:20:59,641 --> 00:20:59,641
training camp,
the different sites,

481
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:04,080
the difference we've made in that 
training camp in terms of speed and 

482
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,441
power and his stamina.
I just knew like I knew where he was 

483
00:21:07,441 --> 00:21:09,640
before and I knew where he was after and
I said he's just going to destroy him.

484
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Like I hope I almost wanted it to go 
five rounds so he could show like what 

485
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,640
it was capable of.
Wow.

486
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,210
Well,
that's pretty crazy that he,

487
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:23,211
you know,
when we found out after the pettis 

488
00:21:23,211 --> 00:21:25,221
fight,
where he won the title and just one by 

489
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:28,140
just dominating the champion and a guy 
who dana white had been pretty public 

490
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,080
saying he thought was the best pound for
pound fighter in the sport.

491
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,060
and you know,
I didn't,

492
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I didn't agree with that necessarily,
but I'd certainly did take the kid was 

493
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:38,120
spectacular.
I mean,

494
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,090
the way he stopped donald cerrone,
the waist up,

495
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:41,790
joe lozan,
I mean he was capable of just unleashing

496
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,940
these kicks out of nowhere to put people
away.

497
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,150
He just fucking good way arm barred 
benson.

498
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,390
I mean he's just in the way he caught 
gilbert to mean called gIlbert and good 

499
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:53,390
team.
He's fucking good.

500
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:54,150
And you think he

501
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,990
gilbert in that or do you think it was 
almost.

502
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:01,110
I mean,
not saying that fight was rig or 

503
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,110
anything,
but gilbert made a terrible mistake.

504
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,360
I mean he's sitting on his knees with 
his head up.

505
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,760
He had been tagged.
Yeah,

506
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,550
that's what it was.

507
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,030
Been hurt.
He,

508
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,530
if you watch that fight,
I've watched it several times.

509
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:12,770
A pet his had caught him several times,
some pretty hard shots when gilbert was 

510
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,690
coming in because he knew gilbert 
strategy was.

511
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,820
It was no secret.
Gilbert was just gonna stay on the 

512
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:18,990
outside a little bit,
press hIm up against the cage.

513
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,570
Who's this to the clay guido strategy 
essentially.

514
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,180
Yeah,
it was.

515
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:24,160
Which was his first loss.
I mean,

516
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,130
that was pegasys first loss in the 
octagon.

517
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,430
You know,
when he first came to the ufc,

518
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,850
he was the wec champion and clay gui to 
beat him.

519
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:33,540
And everybody's like,
well,

520
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,610
welcome to the ufc dude.
Right.

521
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:37,260
And everybody kind of knew,
okay,

522
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:42,261
well this guy,
at least at this stage of his career is 

523
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,380
vulnerable to something like this.
Yeah.

524
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:48,870
But gilbert just didn't have the same 
tools that dosantos house until sandra 

525
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,040
says much faster,
much faster.

526
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,330
He's,
he's a fucking.

527
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:53,430
He's a dangerous dangerous right now.
Yeah,

528
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:58,431
he's extremely dangerous.
And his conditioning was off the charts 

529
00:22:58,431 --> 00:23:02,751
and then when you tell me that he was 
knee was hurt three weeks out and he 

530
00:23:02,751 --> 00:23:02,751
couldn't do anything but airdyne 
sprints.

531
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,680
That's incredible.
I mean,

532
00:23:04,681 --> 00:23:05,370
that's amazing.

533
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,180
Well,
they're at high altitudes,

534
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,870
so that's pretty,
uh,

535
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,400
how's he doing it at a highlight?
Have the,

536
00:23:10,401 --> 00:23:13,790
I have an altitude simulator.
I have the hypoxic altitude simulator,

537
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:18,791
not the little velcro masks,
but this is the actual one that thins 

538
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:19,640
the air and,
and changes your blood oxygen levels.

539
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So,
I mean it takes time to build up to 

540
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,000
that.
I wouldn't recommend anyone go try it at

541
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,430
12,000
feet right now.

542
00:23:25,431 --> 00:23:26,990
You're going to have like a seizure or 
something,

543
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,910
you know what I mean?
Maybe I aneurism,

544
00:23:28,911 --> 00:23:33,911
I don't know.
But it took probably three weeks to get 

545
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,840
them to that point where he was able to 
sprint on that thing.

546
00:23:35,841 --> 00:23:40,841
So I mean we'd been building up for 
awhile and then there's things.

547
00:23:41,031 --> 00:23:46,031
Obviously I can't tell you on the air 
because I don't give away too many 

548
00:23:46,031 --> 00:23:46,160
people that I tell

549
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:51,160
you it was rigorous and there was,
there was times when I would watch and 

550
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:51,980
I'd want to pull the plug and be like,
hey,

551
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,080
you know what I mean?
but you gotta listen to your gut.

552
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:59,550
And uh,
just keep pushing them and know what 

553
00:23:59,550 --> 00:23:59,550
they can take.
Is that a factor,

554
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,611
a big factor when you're working with an
athlete that you have to know what this 

555
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,690
athlete is capable of and where were you
going to break them that?

556
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:10,710
Absolutely.
I think that's probably the most 

557
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,491
critical factor.
I think you hit it right on the head 

558
00:24:12,491 --> 00:24:13,430
because it seems like you're.
You're dancing that line,

559
00:24:13,431 --> 00:24:18,431
man.
He was a thin line man and that's the 

560
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:18,431
way you get a guy better,
right?

561
00:24:18,431 --> 00:24:19,790
You gotta get them right to that fucking
ads and then pull them back.

562
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,620
How have you seen the movie whiplash?
Yes.

563
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,020
That's basically sums it up.

564
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:29,020
Right?
And then that teacher was so good at 

565
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:29,020
what he did.
He brought out the best.

566
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,120
I've got the wrong move in my head.
You're talking about the movie.

567
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,180
I'm not going to tell you,
don't tell me about it,

568
00:24:35,181 --> 00:24:37,400
but I saw the ads are screaming and 
yelling at somebody.

569
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:39,830
I was confused.
I'm like,

570
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:44,831
how does that factor in?
That was the thing in a totally 

571
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:44,831
different movie,
but it is,

572
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:44,831
it's the,
uh,

573
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:48,490
I was thinking,
fuck,

574
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,790
is he going to make this a.
No,

575
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,530
no,
but that's it.

576
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:59,531
The intuition and the I,
I believe that I as the most important 

577
00:24:59,531 --> 00:24:59,960
in what you see and what your athletes 
doing,

578
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,810
you see the speed deteriorate,
then you've gone too far.

579
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:08,330
You need to know how to get your,
got a peak In every exercise and then 

580
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,891
cut it off.
And what's the variability as far as 

581
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:11,891
recovery?

582
00:25:11,891 --> 00:25:11,891
Does everybody,
I mean,

583
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:14,450
people must recover at different rates.
Absolutely.

584
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,840
Uh,
it also depends on their past like 

585
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:19,840
conditioning too,
you know what I mean?

586
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,711
So like if a guy's never had a certain 
type of aerobic or anaerobic training 

587
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,050
and of course it's going to take a few 
more days to recover,

588
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,820
that's going to take a lot longer to 
develop.

589
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,430
That was one of the things that you 
arrive,

590
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:34,670
faber said was one of the reasons why 
his team,

591
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:39,671
the team alpha male has so few injuries.
So like there's some camps that have 

592
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:41,970
amazing records,
uh,

593
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:44,220
as far as their fighters fighters when 
grape,

594
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,820
but they have a giant amount of 
injuries.

595
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,860
But his,
his camp team,

596
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:50,330
alpha male,
occasionally guys get hurt.

597
00:25:50,331 --> 00:25:53,570
LIke tj had to pull out of the head and 
brow fight because of a broken rib,

598
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:56,900
but those are just bones,
just like you can only take so much.

599
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,900
You know,
your bone is like benevidez said it 

600
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:01,900
best.
He's like a rib at the end of the day is

601
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,040
just a rib and it can only take so much 
and when it breaks it breaks.

602
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,980
Um,
but those guys are always in shape.

603
00:26:06,981 --> 00:26:11,981
And you're,
I was saying that it's like a lifestyle 

604
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:11,981
thing that they never get out of shape.
they're always training very hard.

605
00:26:11,981 --> 00:26:14,600
They're always in peak condition.
So it's not about getting,

606
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,820
having to get into shape already in 
shape.

607
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:21,970
Well,
I'd also wonder what kind of strength 

608
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:21,970
and strength training they're doing.
And to this day,

609
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,541
I mean,
if they're doing heavy weight lifting 

610
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:25,541
and you're doing that,
you're around,

611
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:25,700
you're going to get fucked up.
It's just going to happen.

612
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,780
It destroys the muscular equilibrium.
And that's been proven.

613
00:26:29,781 --> 00:26:34,781
So if he,
if you got a good program and it helps 

614
00:26:35,001 --> 00:26:38,230
maintain the health of the athletes and 
you know that's something.

615
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:43,540
No,
when you say that heavy weightlifting 

616
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:43,950
destroys the equilibrium of the athlete,
would exactly do you mean by.

617
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:49,090
so what I mean by that is let's say a.
Let's say you're doing bicep curls for 

618
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:50,050
example,
and you're.

619
00:26:50,051 --> 00:26:53,400
You're doing a heavy weight lifting,
you're doing heavy bicep curls,

620
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,020
you're shortening that bicep,
right?

621
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,060
We know the one that has a muscle gets 
bigger,

622
00:27:00,061 --> 00:27:01,860
it gets shorter because of the 
cross-bridging.

623
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,370
So when you shorten one muscle,
you lengthen the opposite muscle and 

624
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:09,120
that puts the joint and the tendons and 
ligaments are at risk for injury.

625
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,040
Hm.
So if you do like,

626
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:14,290
say if you're doing something along the 
lines of bicep curls,

627
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,620
it must be critical that you do tricep 
extensions or dips or something along 

628
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:19,620
those lines.

629
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,960
Absolutely.
But what's more,

630
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,620
what's even more important is to engage 
the tendons and ligaments,

631
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,200
the elastic components of,
of the,

632
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,280
of the connective tissue.
So the musculaR attending unit as a 

633
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:32,330
whole,
and now that's on a,

634
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,790
that's a whole nother level.
ThAt's like a.

635
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,590
It requires a certain amount of 
essential overload.

636
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,540
Essentially it would be like the 
movement coming downward,

637
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:41,000
like when you do a bench press,
the negative portion of that,

638
00:27:41,001 --> 00:27:46,001
that's the eccentric portion of the lift
has to come down with approximately 40 

639
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:51,011
percent greater force downward.
Then it goes up to maintain muscular 

640
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:52,250
equilibrium.
How do you do that?

641
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,580
Well,
biometrics biometrics are a perfect 

642
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:57,580
example of that.
So like

643
00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,260
do you,
you would not just incorporate bench 

644
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,260
press,
you would do

645
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,260
like a plow metric.
Manage press.

646
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,660
How's that work?
Uh,

647
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,860
I don't know if you have video or 
anything that,

648
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,710
um,
you can,

649
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,130
you can probably see on my instagram.
Uh,

650
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,340
you probably seen bj penn doing it too,
so.

651
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:17,100
Well,
so plyometric bench press?

652
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:22,130
Yeah.
As opposed to a traditional bench trust 

653
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,260
on what happens with that is I can 
describe it when,

654
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,290
if he brings it out.
Okay.

655
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,260
I can describe it now if you like,
you see anything on this room?

656
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,800
Is it a speed of sport?
Yeah.

657
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,950
Instagram,
speed of sport.

658
00:28:31,951 --> 00:28:34,370
And then if you scroll down you might 
see one I hope finally here,

659
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,260
here go plyometric ballistic bench 
press.

660
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,880
I don't know if I'd use that one to be 
honest.

661
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,260
No,
I don't know.

662
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,720
Let's check it out.
Is that somebody else?

663
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,430
It's not me.
No.

664
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,540
Okay.
Let's see.

665
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:50,541
This guy.
He's throwing it a little too slow on 

666
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,371
the way down.
You get typed in speed of sport on 

667
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:56,570
youtube and you can find it too.
Okay,

668
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,290
there we go.
Click.

669
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,540
If you click on that one right there.
Here we go.

670
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:05,290
You'll see a couple of random bits.
Trina's still see a couple of other 

671
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,290
guys.

672
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:05,650
Whoa.
Serious fucking jumps.

673
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,160
Is that a girl?
Yeah.

674
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:11,260
Really,
because it's a dude with crazy hair.

675
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,680
I was like,
that's the most bad ass chick of all 

676
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:16,680
time.
If you took a jump like that.

677
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:20,941
Yeah.
That's like the ronda rousey of box 

678
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:20,941
jumpers,
right?

679
00:29:20,941 --> 00:29:21,550
Yeah.
That looks like a girl.

680
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,330
Yeah,
up until you go.

681
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:28,350
Wait,
what is she even doing with our 

682
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:28,350
endocrine system?
Exactly.

683
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,120
Like jesus christ.
These are crazy jumps,

684
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:31,540
man.

685
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,740
Yeah,
these are.

686
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:38,741
This kid came to me.
This was about five weeks after a grade 

687
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:41,171
two ankle sprain,
so you can see this heels don't even 

688
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:41,171
touch there.
It's just All balls of the feet,

689
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:43,150
the toes.
So this is similar to what,

690
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:45,130
like an ice have a,
excuse me,

691
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:46,660
a plow plow metric,
um,

692
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,020
bench press would look like,
but they,

693
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,620
we're doing with the feet right there.
So these jumps,

694
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,280
I'm like your,
your big obviously on explosive 

695
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:56,280
movements,
plyometrics.

696
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,050
So this thing is,
I've seen this on the ba bj penn 

697
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,200
training things.
He said this kid is sitting with his 

698
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,200
back,
he's lying on his back rather,

699
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,400
but it's but,
but has a bounce ball under it.

700
00:30:06,401 --> 00:30:09,130
And then there's this padded thing above
him that he keeps kicking up.

701
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,880
and what's the philosophy behind that?
First of all,

702
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,620
you learn how to control your limb 
better.

703
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,990
When you're upside down like that and 
there's no load.

704
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,650
You get greater control of your limb at 
the same time you can,

705
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,930
you can work the full extension of the 
foot,

706
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,470
which is crucial in pretty much every 
sport.

707
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,950
So he's catching these,
these guys,

708
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,790
these things for arms to now and so 
that's.

709
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,800
So that's like a plant metric movement 
right there for the upper body right 

710
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:35,800
there.
so it's explosive.

711
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,220
Now,
what's interesting is that these,

712
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,310
other than this particular exercise,
those are machines and a lot of people 

713
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,790
right here.
This when joe right there.

714
00:30:42,791 --> 00:30:44,260
Okay,
so this is the bench?

715
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:45,940
Yeah.
Okay,

716
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:47,820
so it's.
You catch it with your hands.

717
00:30:47,821 --> 00:30:50,390
There's pads,
so he's throwing it off so he.

718
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,670
He's maximizing this contraction as it 
comes off him.

719
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,600
He's not shortening his reach.
He,

720
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,780
he's got to produce a great amount of 
force to throw that off his fingers.

721
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,690
That last thing he did was crazy balance
ball thing.

722
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,510
This is nuts.
That's some incredible movement.

723
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,570
He's a kids.
I'm a three time national champion for 

724
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,450
taekwondo.
Jesus christ.

725
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,270
Yeah.
That kid is ridiculously flexible.

726
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:16,240
Look at that fucking leg.
What's that kid's name?

727
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,250
Ryan tucker.
Wow.

728
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,620
Where's he out of torrance.
Torrance,

729
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:22,900
California.
And he's in national taekwondo champion.

730
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:23,990
Yeah,
that's.

731
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,630
Taekwondo has its fault,
but god was.

732
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:32,670
When it comes to leg dexterity,
some of those guys have the most 

733
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,260
unbelievable leg dexterity and if you 
could teach them all the other skills,

734
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,300
thai wrestling,
all this stuff,

735
00:31:37,301 --> 00:31:39,190
they have such a weird advantage with 
their legs.

736
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,570
Right?
Like looking at that guy.

737
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,000
Fucking people can do that.
Not many.

738
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:45,130
That's not what that kind of range of 
motion.

739
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,390
And he's doing it with ankle weights on.
Is that what going?

740
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,220
Yeah.
How many,

741
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,030
how much pounds?

742
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,860
Probably like two and a half pounds.
just very light.

743
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,890
Yeah,
just enough to get a stretch out of the 

744
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:55,890
muscle.
So that's what we're trying to do.

745
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:55,890
Yeah.
The whole method.

746
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,480
Here's the stretch shortening cycle.
So you want to stretch the muscle before

747
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:06,331
you shorten it,
so stretch it before you can track that 

748
00:32:06,331 --> 00:32:06,490
plan metrics through the same thing.
They put the tendons,

749
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,270
ligaments and muscles stretch and I just
snapped back with greater force.

750
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,700
So that's called the stretch shortening 
cycle.

751
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:18,180
So now the benefit of that is it trains 
fast twitch at a speed also that's 

752
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:23,880
relevant to the sport.
So if you're not training at the speed 

753
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:23,880
of sport,
you're training any slower than that.

754
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,790
you're training slow twitch,
you're training,

755
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:28,630
you're doing a detrimental a exercise 
for your sport.

756
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:33,730
So anytime you're doing like a heavy 
lift that slow.

757
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,980
Right?
You think that that's bad for the sport?

758
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,480
Absolutely.
Without a doubt.

759
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:37,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

760
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,940
That's interesting.
and it's,

761
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:43,990
well it is,
but it makes sense if you look at the 

762
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,710
best athletes are the ones that have the
highest rate of forced development,

763
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:50,970
the ones that can produce the greatest 
amount of force in the least amount of 

764
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:50,970
time.
Okay.

765
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,240
So that means like a guy that can,
you know,

766
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,780
I don't know,
jump and touch his head on the ceiling 

767
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:58,780
versus a guy that,
you know,

768
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,300
in a split second person,
the guy who would take him three or four

769
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:04,301
seconds to get up there.
So that will be a comparison between a 

770
00:33:04,301 --> 00:33:07,781
plyometric band trust.
Like I just showed you on the video 

771
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:09,350
there as compared to like a 225,
250 pound bench press.

772
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,490
So you're a biG fan of doing everything,
just exploded everything.

773
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Absolutely.
That's interesting because there is a 

774
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,400
school of thought,
especially along with jujitsu guys,

775
00:33:19,401 --> 00:33:23,750
were they like a super super slow 
training where they'll do like a chin up

776
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,850
and each chinup takes like 15,
20 seconds.

777
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,020
You seen that?
Yeah.

778
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,150
Do you think about that?
That's just a pretty much,

779
00:33:29,151 --> 00:33:34,151
that's an isotonic contraction.
I don't see how that even helps jujitsu 

780
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:34,151
at all either.
well,

781
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:36,920
the idea is that if you get someone's 
back and you're working the choke,

782
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,840
you,
you know your arms might gas out,

783
00:33:38,841 --> 00:33:41,660
but this way they won't match up.
I'll tell you right now,

784
00:33:41,661 --> 00:33:46,661
as soon as the whole thing with bj penn 
opened my eyes to so many different 

785
00:33:46,661 --> 00:33:50,441
things and what I felt when I was 
training with him was there was no 

786
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,160
strength.
His technique was so precisely time that

787
00:33:52,161 --> 00:33:54,030
he needed absolutely no,
no strength.

788
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,430
Literally.
No,

789
00:33:55,431 --> 00:34:00,431
sorry.
It was more about timing and the speed 

790
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:01,250
at which he moved and so if you're 
squeezing the guy,

791
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:03,490
maybe you need to brush up on your 
technique a little bit,

792
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:05,060
you know what?
Do you know what I mean?

793
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,400
Like when you've trained with john.
Jock I ticket.

794
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,440
Yup.
Okay.

795
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,760
When I started jujitsu,
I started with hixon gracie.

796
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:15,761
I was there for three years.
I got my blue belt from hixson and then 

797
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:17,510
I went to the machado school in redondo 
beach and I went there at a time.

798
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:19,910
When you show up on saturdays,
john,

799
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:21,170
john,
john,

800
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,430
he again,
haji,

801
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:24,440
and they're all on the mat.
There are training with the students.

802
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,480
Plus you have bob bass,
you have rick williams,

803
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:31,481
you have all these great black belts 
underneath them where are training with 

804
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:32,760
all the students deaf and so how can you
beat that role?

805
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,710
I mean,
that's like amazing.

806
00:34:33,950 --> 00:34:38,950
You know what I mean?
So there's like these guys have these 

807
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:38,950
red things on their black lady,
like,

808
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:39,200
what the heck is this man?
I'm like,

809
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:39,830
I don't even know.
Like,

810
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,180
what planet is this?

811
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:46,310
Are these guys good luck.
Yeah,

812
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:50,420
but you've trained with john jockey.
You feel how he just effortless whatever

813
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,430
you do,
you do it to yourself.

814
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,980
You know what I mean?
It was the same thing with bj penn.

815
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,200
It's like I was a decent black belt.
I was okay when I first got my black 

816
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,330
belt and then after training with bj and
those guys,

817
00:35:02,331 --> 00:35:03,140
man,
being in a,

818
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,790
in that training camp,
it completely opened my mind to fuck.

819
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,370
I've been doing everything wrong for the
last 20 years.

820
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,010
How so?
Forcing things.

821
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:15,200
I was forcing everything,
my workouts,

822
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,540
I was forcing everything.
I was pushing myself to the limit.

823
00:35:17,541 --> 00:35:18,920
I was lifting heavy weights.
Money.

824
00:35:18,921 --> 00:35:21,800
I could squat 425 pounds.
I can bench three.

825
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:26,801
Oh five.
I weighed 168 pounds so people can talk 

826
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:27,230
to me all they want about weightlifting,
but I tell you right now,

827
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,710
I am far more far stronger than I've 
ever been.

828
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,720
Like I might not look it,
but like,

829
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,610
just great.
Don't be hard on yourself.

830
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,230
Thanks man.
Come on.

831
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:40,270
You don't think I needed a nose job or 
anything but,

832
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,810
but uh,
it's just,

833
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,710
it's the way the body moves as a unit as
compared to weightlifting,

834
00:35:46,711 --> 00:35:49,560
which,
which actually fragments muscle groups.

835
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,620
So things along the lines of like bench 
presses and curls and absolutely it's in

836
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,730
a sensitivity training is training the 
body.

837
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:02,040
But what about like guys who want to 
bulk up,

838
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:07,070
like I say,
like what meckey shall stone when he 

839
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,471
trained evander holyfield to get them up
to heavyweight and he had them do all 

840
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:10,920
this crazy weightlifting stuff.
What do you think about that?

841
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,250
A lot of that's genetics really.
Yeah,

842
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:14,130
absolutely.
I think,

843
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,570
oh,
that's mexican supplements.

844
00:36:15,571 --> 00:36:18,240
Could be.
It could be very well,

845
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
but I think,
I think genetics play a huge role in 

846
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:23,720
that and what's your frame can handle.

847
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,950
There's an optimal size for your frame.
You know what I mean?

848
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:30,690
My guys I've seen ultimately times guys 
would put on more muscle than their body

849
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:32,520
can handle on their performance 
deteriorates.

850
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,980
Sure.
Vanda was a fairly big guy.

851
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:40,060
Yeah.
And so he can handle it with this frame 

852
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,060
plus,
yeah,

853
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:40,060
you have to look at the genetics of the 
athlete too,

854
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,810
but if you take a guy like I'm perfect 
example,

855
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:46,770
maybe like Michael Jordan when Michael 
Jordan was playing against the pistons,

856
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,800
right?
Like one of the things that he realized 

857
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:51,800
like,
jesus,

858
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:51,800
fuck,
I'm getting pushed around and getting my

859
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,210
ass kicked.
I got to bulk up when a guy wants a bulk

860
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:59,211
up.
There's very few ways to bulk up other 

861
00:36:59,211 --> 00:36:59,211
than lifting heavy,
right?

862
00:36:59,211 --> 00:37:01,920
Um,
I would say no,

863
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,360
I would.
First of all,

864
00:37:03,361 --> 00:37:03,850
let me,
let me,

865
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:08,860
let me say this,
I think there's too much of an emphasis 

866
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,550
on getting bigger and it might've been 
more advisable to train your body.

867
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:16,580
Maybe there were certain weaknesses in 
his hips or his feet or lower back or 

868
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,511
obliques that were making him weaker.
I've seen plenty of guys whose whose 

869
00:37:20,511 --> 00:37:22,530
bodies are working as a unit,
like with my,

870
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:27,590
with the type of training that I offer a
that can literally bullied like guys 

871
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,220
that are way bigger,
more muscular,

872
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,820
and it all comes down to the efficiency 
of the movement.

873
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,460
You know what I mean?
But a guy like,

874
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,340
here's a good example,
a guy like brock lesnar,

875
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:43,520
you can't get that fucking big and less.
You're throwing some really heavy shit 

876
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:45,460
around.
Yeah.

877
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,800
Or taking mexican style bowl a little 
bit.

878
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,250
A little bit of it.
Yeah.

879
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,720
No,
you're absolutely right.

880
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:53,060
I mean there is,
there is,

881
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:57,000
but again,
it then again,

882
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:01,530
haines,
Alaska as who beat him with more or less

883
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:03,150
the bj penn approach.
Exactly.

884
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,070
Look at cain when cain is thrown a 
punch,

885
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,890
you never see like there's no tension.
There's no efficiency.

886
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Yeah.
that's actually a good point because 

887
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,880
that's been proven,
that repetitive bouts of absolute 

888
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,601
strength training,
which is like your maximum strength 

889
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:20,601
training,
like maximum bench press,

890
00:38:20,601 --> 00:38:23,850
the heavy lifts will deteriorate a 
boxer's punching power and accuracy.

891
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:29,270
Really,
that's been proven by the russians to 

892
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:31,720
erie.
That's fast and it can last for up to 

893
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,870
several months still.
Whoa,

894
00:38:32,871 --> 00:38:33,570
whoa,
whoa,

895
00:38:33,571 --> 00:38:34,470
whoa.
Okay.

896
00:38:34,471 --> 00:38:36,070
So,
so like say if

897
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,820
a guy goes through your conventional 
strength program,

898
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:45,270
a dead lifts bench press,
that can deteriorate his punching power

899
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:48,400
because it deteriorates the speed.
Strength qualities.

900
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,950
There's different types of strength.
Speed.

901
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:53,740
Strength is one that emphasizes speed 
with.

902
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,530
It would be like maybe like 60 percent 
speed,

903
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:59,730
40 percent strength.
Like if I had to put a ratio on,

904
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:05,010
the emphasis is primarily on speed.
Every sport is one by a fraction of a 

905
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,140
second.
Just About,

906
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,710
you know what I mean?
Like even like a basketball team that's 

907
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,691
domInating the entire season,
there's something about every play that 

908
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:16,861
might be 1000th of a second faster than 
the other teams that's making them 

909
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:18,250
better.
and then at the end it's cumulative.

910
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,270
You know,
It all adds up and it compounds on top 

911
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:23,270
of each other.
So at the end of the game it's,

912
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,520
it's a mismatch.
Wow.

913
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:29,530
So even though the pettis fight was 
closer than people think it was a 

914
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:32,620
fraction of a second difference between 
rafael striking and,

915
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:38,150
and strike every time,
every time and that compounds and 

916
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,150
compounds and how.

917
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,660
that's a funny way to look at it,
but I think you're right.

918
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,790
You know,
when he lAnded that straight left in the

919
00:39:42,791 --> 00:39:46,450
first round crack and you see pedis,
his head snapped back.

920
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,840
I was stunned first of all,
by the speed in which he threw that 

921
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:51,840
shot.
Right.

922
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:51,840
um,
I'm,

923
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:56,170
I was very impressed with the speed,
but also that,

924
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:01,320
you know,
he was able to keep that speed up 

925
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,540
through the fourth and fifth rounds.
I mean,

926
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:04,660
when he nailed them in the first round,
I mean petta said from then on,

927
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:05,930
he was having a hard time seeing out of 
that.

928
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:09,250
It was getting pretty much fucked from 
then on that.

929
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,290
That was super impressive because if you
go back and watch his earlier fights,

930
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:18,330
like go back and watch them against 
Jeremy Stevens were early in his career 

931
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,560
where he lost by knockout though the 
stevens highlight reel.

932
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,390
Um,
he just was different guy,

933
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,880
different fucking human being.
I mean,

934
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:29,881
very few guys when you look at their 
early ufc career and then look at their 

935
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:32,230
peak performance,
which dos anjos clearly is in his peak.

936
00:40:32,231 --> 00:40:35,380
He just won the title against one of the
best guys ever in that division.

937
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,320
But he's a different human being all 
around.

938
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:44,020
The funny thing is I don't really read 
too much on the internet and I that I 

939
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,020
had to have this one,
you know,

940
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,480
people sayIng pdds and all this shit.
Uh,

941
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:52,270
and others I see comments,
there's no strength training program 

942
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:52,580
that can do that.
If he look,

943
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:53,930
it's been going on for a year,
you know,

944
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,180
we've been building it up.
Uh,

945
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,950
so if you,
if you compare,

946
00:40:57,951 --> 00:40:59,480
like I said,
like his fight with serone,

947
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:00,880
he's really stiff.
he,

948
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,420
he told me himself by the third round he
was gas.

949
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,460
He goes,
fatIgue.

950
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,030
And so this doesn't like one training 
camp,

951
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:13,031
I mean this has been going on for a year
of really good trading where he and I 

952
00:41:13,031 --> 00:41:13,400
are trading like three or four times a 
week.

953
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:14,140
I mean,
you know,

954
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,850
granted that separate the times in 
between fights when he,

955
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,900
he's got his downtime.
But I mean,

956
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,660
it,
he's been very consistent with it.

957
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,660
And uh,
you get after about three months of this

958
00:41:23,661 --> 00:41:28,661
as when you see the tendons,
ligaments and everything really start 

959
00:41:28,661 --> 00:41:29,570
working as a unit.
And that's when it really,

960
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,150
the power and everything really come 
into play.

961
00:41:32,151 --> 00:41:33,620
So,
so safe.

962
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:34,010
He took a

963
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,420
guy like,
um,

964
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,240
let's just,
what's this?

965
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:39,290
Pull a guy out of the roster.
Let's go with matt mitrione.

966
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:43,330
Big heavyweight fast guy moves really 
well for a heavyweight.

967
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,350
What would you do with a guy like that?

968
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,900
First thing,
the guy comes to me the first day,

969
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,140
I'm going to do muscle tests on them and
find out what's going on with his body 

970
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,710
and find out if there's any types of 
weaknesses in his feet.

971
00:41:54,711 --> 00:41:57,680
And the rotational power,
his hips lower back,

972
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,470
especially a big guy,
lower back and lower abdominal cavity.

973
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,840
A flexibility his shoulders.
I can't stress that enough for punching 

974
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,581
power.
There is an optimal range of motion 

975
00:42:09,581 --> 00:42:11,780
where you produce the greatest amount of
force in all of your joints.

976
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,280
So does that mean that pretty makes is 
pretty easy to understand,

977
00:42:16,281 --> 00:42:16,700
right?
Like,

978
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:19,010
so if my shoulder flection or my 
shoulder,

979
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,500
uh,
flexibility is,

980
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:21,950
is,
is here,

981
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,980
I'm going to lose speed.
If it's,

982
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,820
if it's.
If it's.

983
00:42:25,821 --> 00:42:26,420
Yeah,
exactly.

984
00:42:26,421 --> 00:42:28,400
If it's too short,
you're going to lose speed too long.

985
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:30,340
You're going to lose speed to islam.
Yeah.

986
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,190
There's two flexible acts really just 
too much slack in the muscle.

987
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,430
So.
So how would a guy get to flexible?

988
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,470
Some people are born with that and you 
know what I mean,

989
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:45,471
that's,
that can be a genetic thing or like 

990
00:42:45,471 --> 00:42:46,110
swimmers tend to have a lot of 
flexibility in the shoulders.

991
00:42:46,111 --> 00:42:47,490
But I mean for that support their 
support,

992
00:42:47,491 --> 00:42:50,280
that's okay because they're kind of 
dragging that resistance,

993
00:42:50,281 --> 00:42:52,500
that slower resistance.
But for,

994
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,020
for a snap in the muscle,
there's gotta be a little,

995
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:59,320
just the right amount of tension in 
order for that muscle to activate as,

996
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:00,480
as,
as quickest.

997
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,270
So if it's too long,
imagine like a rubber band.

998
00:43:03,271 --> 00:43:04,790
If it's,
if they're slacking the rubber band,

999
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,960
you can't,
you can't get the snap out of it.

1000
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:07,810
Okay,
I see.

1001
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:08,860
I see.
And then is that,

1002
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:11,230
does that make one more prone to 
injuries as well?

1003
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,020
Absolutely.
Can cause joint instability or 

1004
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,330
impingement?
All kinds of stuff.

1005
00:43:17,331 --> 00:43:19,610
Like I've heard of that with knees.
Absolutely.

1006
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:22,340
And that goes back to the muscular 
equilibrium thing I was talking about.

1007
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,760
So let's imagine you're doing heavy 
front squats every day for like three 

1008
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:27,760
times a week,
you know,

1009
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,050
80 percent of your one rep max or 
whatever,

1010
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,230
and you're doing your max is on one 
every other week or whatever.

1011
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,000
You're developing those quadriceps at 
the expense of the hamstrings.

1012
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,190
It's not even a running movement,
really just a front squat.

1013
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:45,191
That's just a movement up and down.
That's good for like putting groceries 

1014
00:43:45,191 --> 00:43:45,191
on a top of a shelf or something like 
that.

1015
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,940
Okay.
So yeah,

1016
00:43:46,941 --> 00:43:48,950
you're going to shorten those quadricep 
muscles,

1017
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:49,640
you're gonna,
you're gonna,

1018
00:43:49,641 --> 00:43:54,641
you're gonna.
Build them and make them bigger and 

1019
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:54,641
shorter.
And what happens with the hamstring,

1020
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:59,471
it gets longer and weaker.
So now you've got an imbalance between 

1021
00:43:59,471 --> 00:43:59,471
the two.

1022
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:02,360
So if someone was going to do front 
squats,

1023
00:44:02,361 --> 00:44:04,580
they would have to do something to 
compensate for that.

1024
00:44:04,581 --> 00:44:08,120
Like maybe some sort of a dead lift,
straight leg dead lift or something that

1025
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:09,110
hamstring oriented

1026
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,990
again.
Then you're training the hampshire 

1027
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:14,990
depends,
you know,

1028
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:14,990
let's put it this way.
It depends on the sport they're going to

1029
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:15,340
do,
but if it's.

1030
00:44:15,341 --> 00:44:18,300
If it's a fighter fighter,
I'm not going to have him doing that.

1031
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,350
No,
no squats,

1032
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:20,310
no.
No fronts,

1033
00:44:20,311 --> 00:44:25,311
but it's not practical for the sport.
One of the most vital elements for 

1034
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,680
fighting in my opinion and is neglected 
his feet.

1035
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:30,990
Like,
like yoU hear mark talk about the Feet.

1036
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:36,330
I talk about the feet all the time.
The strength in the feet and what it 

1037
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:40,230
does for the nervous system are Crucial 
for athletic performance.

1038
00:44:40,231 --> 00:44:42,600
And yet it's like one of the most 
neglected areas.

1039
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:48,000
The feet like the neural impulses.
So the sensory and motor nerves are very

1040
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:50,730
highly active in the forefoot.
Okay?

1041
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
And this can,
this can actually help speed up your 

1042
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,170
reflexes by type or training the feet on
different planes like balance exercises 

1043
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:04,461
and stuff like that will actually speed 
up that circuitry between the reaction 

1044
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:06,420
between the foot and the spinal cord 
through,

1045
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,050
uh,
you know,

1046
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,080
as you speed up the neural impulses 
speed up the neural impulses by 

1047
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:14,940
strengthening the feet by,
without like reactive,

1048
00:45:14,941 --> 00:45:15,840
uh,
exercises,

1049
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,830
balance exercises on like slant boards 
and,

1050
00:45:18,831 --> 00:45:22,410
and disks and stuff that forced the feet
to stay reactive.

1051
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:23,730
Like is,
for example,

1052
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,360
it can actually,
that reaction can kind of relay into the

1053
00:45:27,361 --> 00:45:28,050
whole body,
you know,

1054
00:45:28,051 --> 00:45:33,051
can can affect the entire body.
Like if you've ever been ice skating or 

1055
00:45:33,051 --> 00:45:34,800
something and you slip like your hands 
are already like,

1056
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:36,120
well,
you know what I mean?

1057
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:41,121
They're already reacting before your 
brain even has time to think because 

1058
00:45:41,121 --> 00:45:44,901
it's processed in the spinal cord.
It doesn't even get processed in the 

1059
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:48,261
brain.
Your reaction from your lower limbs can 

1060
00:45:48,261 --> 00:45:50,421
actually be processed in the lower 
portion of your spinal cord and right 

1061
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:51,690
back out to your limbs.
So you're like a safety mechanism.

1062
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,720
I see.
So you bought as sort of a fail safe 

1063
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:56,720
act.
Exactly.

1064
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:56,720
So it's like,
hey,

1065
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,020
there's no weight on the feet.
put your fucking hands out dude.

1066
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,130
Exactly.
Okay.

1067
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,430
Can you put your brain doesn't even know
that's going on too late?

1068
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,750
It would.
If it did,

1069
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:04,380
it would.
Exactly.

1070
00:46:04,381 --> 00:46:05,100
Okay.
I see.

1071
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,220
So by hyper training the feet,
you keep the body in sort of a ready 

1072
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:13,860
state for reaction and you know,
it's like manipulating the safety device

1073
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,760
to increased sports performance.
The guys at the ana Jim were telling me,

1074
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:21,120
the cub swanson does virtually all of 
his workouts on a balance board.

1075
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,640
It does either a balance board or 
balanced ball,

1076
00:46:23,641 --> 00:46:25,770
like everything he does and he's 
extremely athletic.

1077
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:26,640
Yes.
Yeah.

1078
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,530
So when you're doing these heavy,
heavy lifting it dead ends.

1079
00:46:31,531 --> 00:46:35,860
That impulse,
it slows it down and not.

1080
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:37,950
Not to mention you're neglecting the 
forefoot.

1081
00:46:37,951 --> 00:46:40,620
All these exercises are pretty much done
on the ball on the hill.

1082
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:44,580
I was squatting,
I remember I was taught to press through

1083
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:46,860
the heel,
deadlifting the same thing,

1084
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,680
so your,
your,

1085
00:46:47,681 --> 00:46:52,681
your training over and over these 
movements that are not practical for a 

1086
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:56,451
sports movement,
which pretty much every sport is played 

1087
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:56,451
on the forefoot.
Yeah,

1088
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:57,450
that's true.
Like you never really in a sport.

1089
00:46:57,451 --> 00:47:00,090
You very rarely push off the back of the
foot.

1090
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:03,830
So kind of moving forward when you're 
punching the back heels around.

1091
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,040
Absolutely.
And so knoWing that it's kind of like,

1092
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:10,500
why are we doing this?

1093
00:47:12,790 --> 00:47:15,450
It's improper training.
I mean it really makes sense.

1094
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,510
Has been preaching this for years and I,
you know,

1095
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:21,470
and people kind of scoff at it and you 
see,

1096
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:26,500
oh no,
I gotta get my heavy back squat and 

1097
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:26,500
that's fine,
but maybe this can help you with it,

1098
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,570
you know,
start training the feet,

1099
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,650
looking at,
looking at what we're talking about here

1100
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,800
and the sequence of muscles that you're 
going to start firing when you do start 

1101
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,791
training the feed,
like how is this a better option for 

1102
00:47:38,791 --> 00:47:43,020
squatting would be a front squat.
And now let's say you take a couple of 

1103
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,610
45 pound plates and you put them onto 
the balls of your feet.

1104
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:51,150
So now you're engaging more of a sports 
movie and you're on the balls of your 

1105
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:51,270
feet and you're loading up the front 
instead of the back,

1106
00:47:51,271 --> 00:47:54,490
which is the back squat is technically a
lower back exercise.

1107
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,710
It really hits the lumbar and his lower 
back.

1108
00:47:56,711 --> 00:48:01,711
A lot of front squats going to hit more 
quadricep muscles require for jumping,

1109
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:07,050
you know what I mean,
as well as the core and stabilizing the 

1110
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:07,660
spine with the abdominals and 
everything.

1111
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:10,870
So that's just a thought like maybe you 
can do that.

1112
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,880
You think like,
start thinking in that process where 

1113
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,300
you're training from the feet up the 
forefoot up,

1114
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:21,301
not just the heels of the forefoot up 
and you'll start connecting different 

1115
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:22,580
muscles require for sports movements.
Um,

1116
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:27,660
uh,
we were talking before the podcast that 

1117
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:28,840
I'm really getting into yoga recently,
last couple of weeks I've been into it,

1118
00:48:28,841 --> 00:48:33,841
like in one of the things that is really
shocking to me is how much my feet hurt.

1119
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:39,630
Like all the bouncing on my feet give 
out before a lot of other stuff and.

1120
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:41,800
But I do so many things barefoot.

1121
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:46,090
I lift barefoot box all jujitsu,
all that stuff's barefoot.

1122
00:48:46,091 --> 00:48:47,800
Right?
But for whatever reason,

1123
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:53,070
like just standing there,
holding your foot up in the air and 

1124
00:48:53,070 --> 00:48:55,020
stretching out my foot is the one that's
having a hard time dealing with it.

1125
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,960
It's kinda.
Yeah.

1126
00:48:55,961 --> 00:49:00,961
It's very interesting.
Obviously I've weak feet in some weird 

1127
00:49:00,961 --> 00:49:01,210
way.
Yeah,

1128
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,470
it's a.
It's just.

1129
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:05,860
It never was.
It was never tested before.

1130
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,190
The problem with that is when you do 
have weakness in the feet,

1131
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,560
other things start to compensate.
Like your hips,

1132
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,200
your hips start to compensate for the 
weaknesses and the feet.

1133
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,650
I'd say a lot of guys have flat feet.
They have poor hip abduction and 

1134
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,471
adduction or tight hamstrings.
Flatfooted guys almost always are a 

1135
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:25,300
little hamstring dominant when they're 
sprinting.

1136
00:49:25,301 --> 00:49:27,280
They're good at like the acceleration 
phase,

1137
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:30,310
but the tops the tops be.
is it lacking?

1138
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:31,300
I have flat feet.

1139
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,400
Do you?
Do you get tight in the hamstrings?

1140
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,510
Not really.
No.

1141
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:35,560
No.
I mean he might be.

1142
00:49:35,561 --> 00:49:38,130
The exception to the rule will have very
flexible hamstrings.

1143
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:42,470
Probably the weed weed my hamstrings.
Nah,

1144
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,420
I'm just kidding.
No,

1145
00:49:43,421 --> 00:49:45,610
I just uh,
grew up doing taekwondo.

1146
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,590
I have a lot of.
So for whatever reason I don't,

1147
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,360
I don't have tiging back there,
but um,

1148
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,720
it,
it,

1149
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,390
I definitely a flat fee.
Can we start?

1150
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,320
You know,
kelly,

1151
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:58,060
uh,
he wrote that book,

1152
00:49:58,061 --> 00:49:59,650
the sub sea.
The crossword guy.

1153
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,350
Yeah.
Yeah.

1154
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:05,510
He,
he wrote a book called the supple 

1155
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:05,510
leopard.
He,

1156
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:06,160
he doesn't even believe in flat feet.
He said he thinks it's like you said,

1157
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:11,280
it's like you're sort of almost like 
learning from people around you to walk 

1158
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,601
and stand a certain way and it's almost 
like a laziness of the posture of your 

1159
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:16,030
foot.
To paraphrase him,

1160
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:16,770
I don't know.

1161
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:21,250
I'd have to read it thoroughly and he 
thinks that you could retrain someone to

1162
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,520
have a hierarchy.
You can't.

1163
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:23,590
ABsolutely real.
Yeah.

1164
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:27,080
Done it really from a guy like me 
because I guy like,

1165
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:32,320
like I said,
like the balance balancing type 

1166
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,430
exercises we have and the foot 
strengthening modalities that we use.

1167
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:35,690
Well,
definitely,

1168
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,420
man,
I,

1169
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,270
I challenge you to try this.
If you try like a calf raise,

1170
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:46,290
like or you can go on like a seated 
seated a leg press and don't put any 

1171
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:48,560
weight on there,
just do a few of your shoes on.

1172
00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:54,010
Okay.
Then take your shoes on and try a few 

1173
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:54,260
without your shoes and really 
accentuated the movement and the toes to

1174
00:50:54,261 --> 00:50:56,690
the tip of the toe and not just to the 
pad of the toe,

1175
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,540
but to the tip of the toe and see the 
difference you feel on your achilles and

1176
00:50:59,541 --> 00:51:00,230
your calves.

1177
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:05,950
Okay.
I guarantee you it's going to blow you 

1178
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:07,811
away.
A tremendous difference when you just 

1179
00:51:07,811 --> 00:51:10,901
use that little bit,
that little extra inch of your toes and 

1180
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:15,581
you feel it all through the arch of the 
foot and you fill it all the way up 

1181
00:51:15,581 --> 00:51:16,290
through the calf.
it's really police something else.

1182
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,590
that's where I always have pain in my 
foot.

1183
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,390
Yeah.
It's always like a.

1184
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:25,391
I got pain there from skiing.
I get pain there from sometimes hiking 

1185
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:27,320
gives me some pain there.
Yeah,

1186
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,330
that's fixable.
Interesting.

1187
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:30,950
Okay.
we'll talk about me later in that,

1188
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,190
but that a lot of people have issues 
with that.

1189
00:51:33,191 --> 00:51:35,290
A lot of issues with flat feet.
Um,

1190
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:38,780
do you find that fighters ever have 
issues plotting,

1191
00:51:38,781 --> 00:51:43,781
like say if you get a guy and like maybe
he's kind of lumbering like we all know 

1192
00:51:43,781 --> 00:51:46,220
fighters that just,
they just don't move well on their feet.

1193
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:49,460
For example,
roselawn has the flattest feet I've ever

1194
00:51:49,461 --> 00:51:54,320
seen an athlete really actually maybe 
top three and so,

1195
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:59,410
but surprisingly after this training 
camp he had a little bit more strength 

1196
00:51:59,901 --> 00:52:02,660
than I noticed that less of a drop in 
the arches of his foot.

1197
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,860
And so that says something about what 
we're doing and there were points in the

1198
00:52:06,861 --> 00:52:11,861
fight where you can see him bouncing 
around on his feet and he looks pretty 

1199
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:14,591
quick.
I think even like the 10th or 11th 

1200
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:16,211
round,
he was popping around on his feet and 

1201
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:16,211
the announcer said,
what is this?

1202
00:52:16,211 --> 00:52:16,940
He's bounced around his feet.
It looks quick.

1203
00:52:16,941 --> 00:52:21,941
What's he doing now?
Is this some kind of strategy or 

1204
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:21,941
whatever?
And uh,

1205
00:52:21,941 --> 00:52:25,420
no.
So we made incredible gains in like the 

1206
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:25,420
strength of his feet and his cast,
you know,

1207
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:28,730
unfortunately he fights flatfooted.
He comes at you head first and you know,

1208
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:29,630
that's just the style.

1209
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,530
But yeah,
he was coming on in the later rounds.

1210
00:52:33,531 --> 00:52:36,740
Matina was cracking him early in that 
fight.

1211
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:40,460
That was a war to comment of the best 
I've ever seen could be,

1212
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,230
could very well be.
He did get hurt.

1213
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,660
He got hurt one of the rounds and it 
slowed him down.

1214
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,810
It's hard to not say throws bombs.
Yeah,

1215
00:52:47,811 --> 00:52:52,811
he was,
he was really pleaseD with his 

1216
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:52,811
conditioning though.
He came out,

1217
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:53,080
he actually came by on the way to the 
packet.

1218
00:52:53,081 --> 00:52:55,760
I'll fight.
He flew into lax and he stopped by my gm

1219
00:52:55,761 --> 00:52:57,890
And he wanted to give me a bonus.
He's like,

1220
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:59,390
I've never felt like that.
Am I in a fight?

1221
00:52:59,391 --> 00:53:02,090
Even though I lost like that's the best 
I've ever felt.

1222
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:03,620
Like it's awesome.
And I said,

1223
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:04,300
uh,
like,

1224
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:09,600
you know,
I looked as managers and actually like 

1225
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:09,600
maybe we should just wait until you win 
little accent,

1226
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:10,580
you know,
we'll,

1227
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,600
we'll take care of when it.

1228
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:14,180
When on a winning day.
so did you see the,

1229
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:15,940
a urine sample that he gave?
Yeah.

1230
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:17,090
Tasty,
huh?

1231
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,800
Yeah.
For folks who don't know,

1232
00:53:18,801 --> 00:53:22,820
if you look on providing a coughs,
a instagram page was a photo of his,

1233
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,470
his urine sample looked like coca.
Yeah.

1234
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,390
It,
we've showed it a bunch of times in this

1235
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:29,370
podcast because it's so fucking crazy.
Yeah.

1236
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,590
I've never,
I've heard of that before.

1237
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:34,320
Guys who do like ultra marathons,
my friend cameron hanes,

1238
00:53:34,321 --> 00:53:36,970
he's done an ultra marathon.
He said pop like coke,

1239
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:41,250
breaking down muscle and dehydration and
all that and kidneys,

1240
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:42,510
kidney problems,
you know,

1241
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:47,511
who knows.
So to that fight was just that fucking 

1242
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:47,511
brutal.
It was insane.

1243
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:47,520
I'll tell you what,
one of the first,

1244
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,470
I mean,
first of all,

1245
00:53:49,471 --> 00:53:51,390
I have so much respect for both of those
guys.

1246
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,540
Like when tesa and rose on honor,
both in my top five,

1247
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,590
top 10 fighters with tcs punching power 
is freaking ridiculous.

1248
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,910
Ridiculous.
I don't remember,

1249
00:53:59,911 --> 00:54:01,050
I was in there and I was like,
where am I,

1250
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:01,980
where am I going to sit?
I,

1251
00:54:01,981 --> 00:54:03,360
you know,
I was going to be originally going to be

1252
00:54:03,361 --> 00:54:08,361
in a corner and then I ended up getting 
a seat at ringside and I turned my back 

1253
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:09,090
and I'm,
there's a first round,

1254
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:14,091
10 seconds in.
I'm already hearing the punches behind 

1255
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:14,091
me.
I'm like,

1256
00:54:14,091 --> 00:54:16,940
oh fuck,
I got to run around and get my ass over 

1257
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:16,980
there as quick as I can because it's go 
another round.

1258
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:22,330
You know,
you're in a good fight and you can hear 

1259
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:22,650
those punches landing.
It's just ridiculous like the power that

1260
00:54:22,651 --> 00:54:24,350
they generate.
But tisa is a monster.

1261
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,610
Puts those,
a monster.

1262
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:30,630
He's the way he keeps coming and coming 
and moving and throwing bombs.

1263
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,640
But jesus would've fight.
That was.

1264
00:54:33,060 --> 00:54:33,750
And the,
and the.

1265
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,400
And the cool thing about that was I like
roselawn at,

1266
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,200
but the last,
the fights year prior to that,

1267
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,010
you know,
he attended,

1268
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:44,790
had a tendency to fade after three or 
four rounds and whatever that was,

1269
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,710
you know,
focus or conditioning,

1270
00:54:46,711 --> 00:54:47,220
I don't know.

1271
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,520
But even if his mental focus,
you need to condition that as well.

1272
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,820
And so this training camp,
I really dedicated a lot of time to 

1273
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,490
learning how to push him into the later 
rounds and get into bringing it more and

1274
00:54:59,491 --> 00:55:00,990
more as a,
as a fiber grass.

1275
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,410
Now I'm freddie roach trained sim as 
boxing.

1276
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:08,580
Yeah.
And what was like freddy's assessment of

1277
00:55:08,581 --> 00:55:13,581
like the difference in his performance 
from training with you is what we can 

1278
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:16,920
get out of him in the gym.
He looked great.

1279
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,980
Everybody was pleased with his barring.
Like this time they said this is the 

1280
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:24,711
best he's ever looked in inspiring,
like phenomenal and a renaissance of 

1281
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:25,860
kind,
kinda like a robot.

1282
00:55:25,861 --> 00:55:30,861
Like whatever he does inspiring,
he's pretty much going to do on the 

1283
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:30,861
fight.
And so even in sparring he would come on

1284
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:33,690
a little slow and then pick it up 
towards the later rounds of sparring.

1285
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,410
And uh,
so I,

1286
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:37,350
I don't think it surprised anybody in 
the performance.

1287
00:55:37,351 --> 00:55:38,760
Like freddy,
he even said in the beginning,

1288
00:55:38,761 --> 00:55:39,960
you know,
it's a 50 slash 50 fight,

1289
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,400
like I don't know who's going to win 
this.

1290
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,050
And uh,
to be honest,

1291
00:55:43,051 --> 00:55:48,051
that fight went down exactly how I 
thought I would exactly in the dressing 

1292
00:55:48,051 --> 00:55:50,630
room before we walked out.
I said to the ra,

1293
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,290
I pulled the ref aside and I asked him,
you know,

1294
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:57,291
hey,
look what happens if he gets head 

1295
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:57,810
butting in like first or second round,
I shit you not.

1296
00:55:57,811 --> 00:55:59,340
I asked him that.
Wow.

1297
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:01,230
And I said,
are you going to stop the fight?

1298
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:03,270
He going to have him check it or You 
gonna let him keep fighting.

1299
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:04,080
If there's blood,
you know,

1300
00:56:04,081 --> 00:56:06,840
I just want to get some things clear 
because I kind of had this weird feeling

1301
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,630
and uh,
sure enough,

1302
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:12,350
second round and I had a feeling matina 
is going to win by decision and I just,

1303
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,280
sometimes you just get that weird 
feeling,

1304
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:16,320
you know,
there's an aura and a,

1305
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,170
you can put all the work and you want.
But you know,

1306
00:56:19,171 --> 00:56:22,170
like if it's not your night and it's not
your night and there's just something.

1307
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:24,220
So there now provided

1308
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,810
a cough.
What kind of diet does that guy follow?

1309
00:56:26,811 --> 00:56:30,640
Because I'd read some crazy shit about 
like until he was like,

1310
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:31,600
yeah,
he had,

1311
00:56:31,630 --> 00:56:34,950
he'd only eaten raw meat and now he 
still eats raw meat.

1312
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,470
Really not when he's here.
He has a,

1313
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:42,510
he has a nutritionist here,
but where does he like when he's inside 

1314
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:42,640
barrier barrier?
Yeah.

1315
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,770
What is it?
They sell it like in his talent.

1316
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:46,330
I guess they sell it in restaurants and 
shit.

1317
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,920
Like you can go into a restaurant and 
just go,

1318
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,060
hey,
I'll have a moose heart.

1319
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,540
Really?
Yeah.

1320
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,510
So they all,
they're all used to eating raw meat.

1321
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,880
They're like eskimos.
You know what I mean?

1322
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,580
They're really,
they're really ahead of the times.

1323
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,420
Well there's something to be said for 
those genetics,

1324
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,180
I'll tell you that.
Yeah.

1325
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:10,470
Because those are some fucking stout 
human beings and that diet has got to be

1326
00:57:10,721 --> 00:57:12,940
like incredibly nutrient dense protein.

1327
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,040
absolutely.
If you're in as long as you're eating,

1328
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:17,140
you know,
game animals and not predators,

1329
00:57:17,141 --> 00:57:19,030
you know,
you can pretty much get away with that.

1330
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:21,820
They were eAting bear.
Obviously you couldn't eat it raw,

1331
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:24,390
but eating a caribou or something like 
that.

1332
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,930
Raw.
you're reading it fine.

1333
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,700
I've eaten cariboU before.
Yeah.

1334
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,760
Yeah.
No,

1335
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,990
I'd be interested to try that.
It's very.

1336
00:57:31,991 --> 00:57:35,380
It's reindeer reindeer.
Like santa has reindeer.

1337
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:37,210
There's caribou.
Elk.

1338
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,130
Elk is delicious.
I've had a.

1339
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:44,770
I've had raw horse in montreal.
I had a horse tartare.

1340
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:50,460
Yeah.
The ground up this raw horse and served 

1341
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,050
it with like egg on it and everything.
Like raw egg on it.

1342
00:57:51,051 --> 00:57:52,430
It was a manager saying,
yeah,

1343
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,340
there's thIs place called joe beef and 
montreal.

1344
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,100
Is that fresh?
Oh yeah,

1345
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,220
yeah,
they do that.

1346
00:57:57,230 --> 00:57:59,020
Do they kill the whole,
I don't know.

1347
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:01,300
Fresh.
You'd think that they'd killed the whole

1348
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:06,301
horse and some little would spoil or do 
they just like take off limbs at a time 

1349
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:06,520
and then like is a good question?

1350
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,890
I don't know.
I mean the thing I don't know,

1351
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,230
when you buy beef that you buy from the 
stores fresh,

1352
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,730
they're not freezing your stakes for the
most part.

1353
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:20,731
Some fish is frozen,
but almost all beef you're buying is 

1354
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:22,870
been killed fairly recently.
Some of it's dry aged,

1355
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,910
but this was,
this horse was,

1356
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,170
you know,
I guess I actually,

1357
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:31,171
they killed a horse in America,
but you can't sell it in America in 

1358
00:58:31,171 --> 00:58:34,861
stores,
but you can kill them in America and 

1359
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:34,861
then they export them to,
to Canada.

1360
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,310
It's very tricky,
you know,

1361
00:58:36,311 --> 00:58:40,660
because people have very strong 
attachments towards them as animals,

1362
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:41,860
as pets.
yeah.

1363
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:45,520
But a delicious.
Although weird,

1364
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:47,320
you know,
I don't have any horse horse,

1365
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,350
you know,
I'm not about to eat a dog provider.

1366
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,520
Worse.
Might trip me out.

1367
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:53,650
Yeah.
What's with the cats?

1368
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:55,570
I think I saw a picture of your cats or 
something.

1369
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:59,400
You got cats,
girl.

1370
00:59:00,430 --> 00:59:02,500
I've always had cats.
I have a 19 year old cat.

1371
00:59:03,270 --> 00:59:04,780
I've had her since she was a baby.
Yeah.

1372
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,340
is that bad?
no.

1373
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:11,060
So it's just different when you try to.
Seemed like a macho guy.

1374
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,920
I'm balanced.
I got to get in touch with the feminine 

1375
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:16,920
side.
Touch with my feminine side.

1376
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,340
I like little dogs too.
Is that okay?

1377
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,150
Yeah.
That's great.

1378
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,050
What if I have a little dog in a purse?
I carry it around.

1379
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,110
Batman.
Think you're pushing.

1380
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,060
Chuck liddell does.
Desi,

1381
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,970
chuck odell was a little tiny chihuahua.
He used to take with them everywhere.

1382
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,290
Nobody said shit.
exactly.

1383
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:33,380
Iceman

1384
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:36,350
cats,
man.

1385
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:37,960
My daughters love cats.
Yeah,

1386
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:40,290
they're cute.
You got daughters.

1387
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:40,800
Oh,
that's rIght.

1388
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,990
Yeah.
You want to soft shoulders,

1389
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:46,770
which was a comedy,
a comedy club in hermosa few years ago.

1390
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:47,670
Oh,
the comedy magic.

1391
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,760
Fucking phenomenal guy.
I never saw it before.

1392
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:55,470
I remembered you from the.
Was it the sitcom news radio news radio.

1393
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,080
I thought that was pretty funny there.
And then I saw you at the thing.

1394
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,390
My buddy got us tickets and I was just 
like blown away.

1395
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,960
Oh,
thanks for the thing about the daughters

1396
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:04,750
in her hand.
That's true.

1397
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,380
Story resonates in my mind.
Really did,

1398
01:00:07,381 --> 01:00:08,000
man.
Yeah.

1399
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:10,590
She's lIke,
I want to go to bed.

1400
01:00:11,070 --> 01:00:13,660
Mad dogged me.
Does a total true story.

1401
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,650
I had to figure out how to react like 
this is.

1402
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,510
You don't want to freak out about this 
because this.

1403
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,200
Then she'll know that you can get a 
ride.

1404
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,010
The other day I made a mistake.
I swore in front of my kid.

1405
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:28,450
He's going to be two on a few weeks and 
I said that I was frustrated.

1406
01:00:28,451 --> 01:00:33,451
I was tired.
I want to get in the shower and I'm 

1407
01:00:33,451 --> 01:00:33,451
holding him in one arm and I hit the 
dimmer on the light switch.

1408
01:00:33,451 --> 01:00:38,131
It doesn't work properly,
so you're always messIng with it to get 

1409
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:38,131
it to work.
It's a fucking lights.

1410
01:00:38,131 --> 01:00:38,530
It just said,
brad,

1411
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,830
I love it and I try to get this thing to
work.

1412
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,570
my son goes fucking light.
Okay,

1413
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,060
that's great.
Now everything.

1414
01:00:48,090 --> 01:00:49,260
No,
it's still going on.

1415
01:00:49,261 --> 01:00:51,810
This is like a month and a half ago.
It's still going on.

1416
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:55,020
Fucking uncle rudy.
Fucking garbage car.

1417
01:00:55,070 --> 01:00:57,390
You know,
as soon as you give it like a,

1418
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:59,070
a response,
then it's like,

1419
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,120
oh,
their eyes light up.

1420
01:01:00,170 --> 01:01:02,140
Like you don't have to say anything.
I mean it.

1421
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:04,260
Your eyes just kind of latch on is like,
oh dude,

1422
01:01:04,261 --> 01:01:07,250
did you just say that?
So two days ago,

1423
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:12,260
a mommy and me class,
kids are singing twinkle twinkle little 

1424
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:15,921
star.
I shit you not fucking lights fucking 

1425
01:01:15,921 --> 01:01:17,400
lights.
I feel like such a bad dad.

1426
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:22,430
No nonsense.
Don't let those people fuck with your 

1427
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:22,430
head.
I'm not cares.

1428
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,750
You're a grown adult.
Your fork and knife.

1429
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:28,020
He Said fork and knife and you go,
but don't even lie about it.

1430
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:30,570
Is there anything wrong with saying 
those words today?

1431
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:33,270
You and I are together.
Two gRown adults.

1432
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,760
So stop.
Everybody stopped.

1433
01:01:36,770 --> 01:01:39,780
My wife always says that.
My wife gets mad if I swear on the kids,

1434
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,310
you know,
just like stop with the language.

1435
01:01:41,311 --> 01:01:46,311
I like pushing bitch.
Fuck you think I make a living and make 

1436
01:01:46,311 --> 01:01:46,800
a living with this language.
This is called english.

1437
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,110
It's called american english.
And occasionally we say,

1438
01:01:49,111 --> 01:01:51,150
fuck jesus.
Don't say that's cool.

1439
01:01:51,151 --> 01:01:53,550
Kids.
My three year old,

1440
01:01:53,970 --> 01:01:55,620
when she was three rather we were 
skiing.

1441
01:01:55,621 --> 01:01:57,490
I took them skiing from the time they 
were really little,

1442
01:01:57,491 --> 01:01:59,010
like my kids have been skiing since they
were two.

1443
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,260
And um,
uh,

1444
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:04,230
when she was three,
we're packing all the stuff up.

1445
01:02:04,231 --> 01:02:09,231
We're getting ready to leave.
We're leaving the trip and we're in the 

1446
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:09,231
hotel and uh,
you know,

1447
01:02:09,231 --> 01:02:12,050
she's got her little bag is zipped up 
and my wife goes,

1448
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,670
we forgot to put the helmet in the bag 
and the little kid,

1449
01:02:14,671 --> 01:02:15,420
she's three,
she goes,

1450
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:20,070
shit,
my

1451
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:25,070
wife looks at me and her eyes,
her eyes light up and I had a fucking 

1452
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:28,190
turned my face and run out of the room 
because I couldn't stop laughing.

1453
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,610
I laughed.
It was funny,

1454
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:34,670
but I didn't want to like,
make sure she finds something that's 

1455
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:35,130
funny,
like she loves being funny because I'm a

1456
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:37,650
big laugh.
So when she says funny shit,

1457
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:42,860
I just fucking fall overlap.
So I had to be real careful about that 

1458
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,670
when she was three,
but it was just something funny,

1459
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:46,920
but she wasn't even doing it to get 
attention or anything.

1460
01:02:46,921 --> 01:02:49,710
She's just looking her suitcase.
My wife has the helmet.

1461
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:51,000
She realized the helmet's not a 
suitcase.

1462
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:52,380
He goes,
shit,

1463
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:59,630
tiny,
tiny first and say shit is fucking like 

1464
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:05,990
if we were,
it was just you and I forgot your 

1465
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:05,990
senior.
How might you be like,

1466
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:05,990
gosh,
that would be normal.

1467
01:03:06,190 --> 01:03:07,940
That was normal to her.
Yeah,

1468
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:09,470
I just,
I don't buy this.

1469
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:12,900
It's something wrong with kids swearing.
It's fucking stupid.

1470
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:18,230
Dumb.
Well there's a certain age when it's 

1471
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,230
okay.
What's that age 19.

1472
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,470
Because then when they start fucking 
isn't when they drink.

1473
01:03:19,471 --> 01:03:24,471
Like when,
when is it okay to swear like we're 

1474
01:03:24,471 --> 01:03:26,421
babies with our fucking language and 
it's so dumb because it's all just by 

1475
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:30,320
television.
It's all like the censorship that we've 

1476
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,500
imposed upon ourselves with television 
is the same censorship that we bring 

1477
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,100
into the household and you expect from 
kids at school.

1478
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:37,460
Like I don't give a fuck about language.
I,

1479
01:03:37,461 --> 01:03:42,461
I,
w I appreciate how people treat each 

1480
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:42,461
other.
How do you,

1481
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:42,461
how do you talk to me?
Are you nice?

1482
01:03:42,461 --> 01:03:44,430
Are you friendly?
If you're friendly and you say,

1483
01:03:44,431 --> 01:03:46,110
fuck,
I feel good about talking to you.

1484
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:51,590
You know,
if you're a rude person and you don't 

1485
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,460
use bad language or you're uncomfortable
or you're,

1486
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:55,090
you're not kind or considerate,
then I,

1487
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:56,820
then I feel gross about talking to you.

1488
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:59,080
But if you're a normal person you say,
fuck what?

1489
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:04,130
What kind of a weirdo cares about that?
But we've imprinted it into our brains 

1490
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:08,250
and the same retarded shit.
We pass it down from parent to child and

1491
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:09,880
parent,
the child and the widow.

1492
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,320
When does that stop?
When?

1493
01:04:11,330 --> 01:04:15,330
When do we stop giving so much power.
These stupid fucking words.

1494
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,460
It's dumb.
Just dies.

1495
01:04:17,461 --> 01:04:19,110
A parent.
It drives me fucking crazy.

1496
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:24,290
Drives me crazy because I know that it's
not like when people are alone,

1497
01:04:24,721 --> 01:04:26,100
when they're comfortable,
when they're together,

1498
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:28,920
when they're out drinking,
when they're at a bar or restaurant,

1499
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:31,380
they swear and it's fun.
It's freeing.

1500
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,840
It's liberating.
But you're in an office.

1501
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:35,790
Everybody's dressed like a fucking 
penguin.

1502
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,230
Some weird stupid outfits.
You know?

1503
01:04:38,231 --> 01:04:39,210
It's,
it's dumb.

1504
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,240
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't mean it's a weird habit that 

1505
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:44,950
we're stuck in that people think is 
like,

1506
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:50,240
oh,
you've got a lot of class with your 

1507
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:50,240
language.

1508
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:50,240
Fuck you.
Shut up.

1509
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:53,580
This is stupid.
So dumb way to express yourself.

1510
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,620
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Yeah.

1511
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:59,190
I don't really think that much about.
It drives me nuts.

1512
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:01,050
It drives me nuts,
man.

1513
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:06,230
Because I've had people come on my 
podcast and I'm like the podcast,

1514
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:11,631
like someone will say it was a great 
podcast except for rogan's language and 

1515
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:14,070
my language like he.
He asked great questions.

1516
01:05:14,071 --> 01:05:15,990
If you get past the language,
it was a great conversation.

1517
01:05:15,991 --> 01:05:17,500
If you say it in like a foreign 
language.

1518
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:19,390
Yeah,
right.

1519
01:05:19,391 --> 01:05:21,760
Some the word french,
french word for fuck.

1520
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:23,450
It's just silliness.
It's,

1521
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:28,660
it's infant tile.
It's like it's self imposed infantile 

1522
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,280
behavior and one year the adult,
when you're a grown person,

1523
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:32,080
you're a fully grown adult.
You t,

1524
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:35,530
you pay your own bills,
you feed yourself the whole deal.

1525
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:40,531
You decide when you go to bed,
like the idea that you were imposing 

1526
01:05:40,531 --> 01:05:40,531
this stupid language restriction.

1527
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:45,690
The only language I care about is 
language that expresses like human 

1528
01:05:45,690 --> 01:05:45,690
interaction.
Yeah.

1529
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,120
I.
I care about derogatory language.

1530
01:05:49,121 --> 01:05:51,610
I care about offensive,
evil language,

1531
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:53,620
racist language.
That kind of stuff bugs me,

1532
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:56,920
but just saying fuck the.
The type of people that do that.

1533
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,220
The good thing about that is if you find
someone who cares about that,

1534
01:06:00,221 --> 01:06:01,810
you know you're,
you're around an idiot.

1535
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:05,860
Just avoid that dummy.
I got a little excited,

1536
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:09,490
I got a little carried away with that.
That thought we got off track.

1537
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:12,430
That's why this podcast is.
We should change the name of it too.

1538
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,210
Off track.
What do you see in the store on sunset?

1539
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,430
Pinches tacos.
You know what that means?

1540
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:20,280
No fucking tacos.
Really?

1541
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:21,090
Yeah.
Good,

1542
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:24,190
good,
good.

1543
01:06:24,191 --> 01:06:27,820
I hope somebody protests.
I hope some social justice warriors have

1544
01:06:27,821 --> 01:06:29,480
it closed down because it's racist or 
something.

1545
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:30,430
I hope white people on it.

1546
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,120
I don't know.
Fun.

1547
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:35,110
Google.
Yeah.

1548
01:06:35,111 --> 01:06:36,820
I don't know man.
I just think we're.

1549
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,860
We're very childish when it comes to 
language.

1550
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,510
That's not the point.
This podcast,

1551
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,140
the point is pocket.
I have just so many questions for you.

1552
01:06:44,141 --> 01:06:46,300
I'm sure I'll get back to this because 
it's really fascinating.

1553
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:51,580
What do you think when you watch those 
countdown shows and you see like guys do

1554
01:06:51,581 --> 01:06:56,581
with the battle ropes and there's like a
bunch of very specific things that you 

1555
01:06:56,581 --> 01:06:58,300
see.
You see like guys pushing sleds,

1556
01:06:58,301 --> 01:07:03,301
that's a big one.
The weight sled pushing that fucking 

1557
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:03,301
sled.
Um,

1558
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:08,011
you see like all these different ways of
training.

1559
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,810
What is like the biggest mistakes that 
you see

1560
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:16,540
or what you feel are based mistakes?
Obviously they exercise modalities like,

1561
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:21,070
I don't know how pushing a sled is even 
relative to like mma.

1562
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:23,980
I mean if we're talking about mma guys 
up against the cage,

1563
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:27,370
what if you get pushing them?
Are you holding him?

1564
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:32,630
Well,
if you're trying to push the guy up 

1565
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,630
against the cage,
say if you get,

1566
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,630
you get in a collar tie,
right,

1567
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:32,670
and you want to push the guy up against 
the cage,

1568
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:37,671
you want to work your entire.
You want to work needs to the body that 

1569
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:37,671
seems

1570
01:07:37,671 --> 01:07:38,210
that would be more about leverage of the
leg,

1571
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,650
the leg,
the placement of the leg,

1572
01:07:39,651 --> 01:07:41,240
and the leverage and the power of the 
foot,

1573
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:43,160
which I take it,
which we go back to.

1574
01:07:43,161 --> 01:07:46,160
The strength and the feet.
The feet of the strength of the foot can

1575
01:07:46,161 --> 01:07:51,161
not be understated.
They've done studies like on olympic 

1576
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:53,950
weight lifters that show that the force,
uh,

1577
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:58,990
excuse me,
the foot actually produces the greatest 

1578
01:07:58,990 --> 01:07:58,990
amount of force and the olympic weight 
lifts.

1579
01:07:58,990 --> 01:07:58,990
So real.
Yeah,

1580
01:07:59,350 --> 01:08:02,180
it's the actual foot.
If you look at the leverage of the joint

1581
01:08:02,181 --> 01:08:03,650
there,
it's just such a short lever.

1582
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:07,460
So the pushing off the ground for clean.
Exactly.

1583
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:10,670
That produces more forced than,
than,

1584
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,980
than the quadricep.
Even even the hip.

1585
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,150
That's amazing.
Yeah.

1586
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:15,450
So,
um,

1587
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:18,160
are you opposed to cleans and presses 
and things along that?

1588
01:08:18,180 --> 01:08:23,120
I'll have my guys do them and I'm not 
going to say there are terrible.

1589
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:25,340
I think if you start going too heavy 
then yeah,

1590
01:08:25,341 --> 01:08:30,341
you're overloading your spine and you're
doing a disservice to the rest of your 

1591
01:08:30,341 --> 01:08:31,340
body.
But like what's too heavy?

1592
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:35,540
I think something that you can't do 
quickly and incorporate the stretch,

1593
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,270
the stretch shortening cycle.
Like I said,

1594
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,670
plyometrics in my opinion are the king 
for strength,

1595
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,450
for strengthening the body.
So box jumps,

1596
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:50,140
those type of exercises.
Were you doing the descending exact 

1597
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:53,630
press and catching it?
Anything where the muscles being put on 

1598
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,980
stretch and then firing back at a,
at a faster rate.

1599
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:58,190
So you can even do that manually.
Like to exercise for the hips.

1600
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,520
You can do that with a hand throwing the
leg down and work it in different 

1601
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,220
angles.
So imagine strengthening every muscle in

1602
01:09:04,221 --> 01:09:09,221
your body plan metrically.
Then you've got like a fast twitch 

1603
01:09:09,221 --> 01:09:09,221
animal.
It's highly trained.

1604
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:15,070
Can you take a guy who's slow and you 
can make them fast solutely there's 

1605
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,180
through the stretch shortening cycle 
again,

1606
01:09:17,181 --> 01:09:20,100
which is the neural neural impulses,
uh,

1607
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:23,720
that go through the muscle and the 
stretch shortening cycle actually,

1608
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,820
like,
let me give you an example of this.

1609
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:29,480
So imagine you go to the doctor and 
you're sitting in the doctor's chair and

1610
01:09:29,481 --> 01:09:31,460
he comes up and he hits you in the knee,
you know,

1611
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:34,640
he does the patellar tests to kick test.
That's a stretch shortening cycle.

1612
01:09:34,641 --> 01:09:35,570
And what,
what he's doing,

1613
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:39,530
he's testing for any kind of 
abnormalities like that might be in your

1614
01:09:39,531 --> 01:09:42,140
spine or,
or might show up in your nervous system.

1615
01:09:42,141 --> 01:09:44,300
It could be some other kind of disease 
or whatever.

1616
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:47,390
But what it's doing is it's sending a 
neural impulse through the,

1617
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,030
through the tendon.
Okay.

1618
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:51,230
All the way up through the,
through the muscle,

1619
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:56,231
into the spine,
and then inhibits the hamstring so it 

1620
01:09:56,231 --> 01:09:56,450
switches the hamstring off.
Okay.

1621
01:09:56,451 --> 01:10:01,451
And that's why your leg jerks without 
you even having to try to do anything 

1622
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:01,451
right there.
So like,

1623
01:10:01,451 --> 01:10:01,550
you know,
you just sit there,

1624
01:10:01,551 --> 01:10:04,020
you're not making a kick.
So that's what's going on.

1625
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:06,230
Exactly.
So exactly.

1626
01:10:06,231 --> 01:10:07,840
So if you,
if you hit the hand,

1627
01:10:07,880 --> 01:10:09,760
if he hit the right in the patellar 
tendon,

1628
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:14,920
your leg kicks,
it's actually switching off your 

1629
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,460
hamstring simultaneously at the same 
time.

1630
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:19,640
It's activating the quadricep so you get
a greater,

1631
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:22,790
you get a greater contraction now,
the quadricep without even trying.

1632
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:25,280
That's where the efficiency that you've 
been talking about comes in.

1633
01:10:26,030 --> 01:10:28,610
So by training the stretch shortening 
cycle,

1634
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:33,850
you can,
you can duplicate that throughout the 

1635
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:34,040
entire body as long as you're training 
every muscle like that.

1636
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:39,670
So do you have like a standard mma 
fighter protocol that you follow or does

1637
01:10:39,891 --> 01:10:43,820
it vary depending upon what the athlete 
brings to you in the first place?

1638
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:47,960
Do or do you try to get them to a place 
and then work from there?

1639
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,220
Yeah,
absolutely.

1640
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,460
Like I said,
we start with muscle testing to 

1641
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:54,460
determine weaknesses like the feet and 
the hips.

1642
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:55,070
What,
how do you do this muscle?

1643
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,730
Manual testing per,
you know,

1644
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:58,790
for example,
all hold your toes and I'll have you try

1645
01:10:58,791 --> 01:11:02,170
to push me back and I'll feel like it's 
like a manual muscle test like something

1646
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:07,180
a chiropractor might do or our physical 
therapists and looking for weaknesses 

1647
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:12,250
and then the hips.
You can test the abduction and 

1648
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:12,250
adduction.
You can turn the person over and you can

1649
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,890
test the rotation of their hip here 
which is.

1650
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:18,570
And all these things play into the 
mechanics of sporting movement,

1651
01:11:18,571 --> 01:11:21,360
so the rotational muscles of the hip.
If you've got,

1652
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:26,361
let's say you're right handed and you've
got weak rotational muscles in the eye 

1653
01:11:26,361 --> 01:11:28,140
and the left and your left leg,
that's going to affect your left hook,

1654
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,270
right?
Same with the right hand,

1655
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,110
straight,
right hand.

1656
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,480
If you got a weak gluten ham 
contraction,

1657
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:38,780
you're going to have a a weakness in 
your straight right hand if you're 

1658
01:11:38,780 --> 01:11:43,191
punching from the hip,
I mean assuming you're punching with 

1659
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:43,191
good mechanics,
right?

1660
01:11:43,191 --> 01:11:45,450
And so all these factors play into where
we want to get them.

1661
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:49,440
So first you would remediate the weakest
link first.

1662
01:11:49,860 --> 01:11:51,960
So 99 times out of 100,
it's the feet.

1663
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:56,961
And the hips with the guys and then like
usually the lower back and the 

1664
01:11:56,961 --> 01:11:57,570
shoulders.
So you get like,

1665
01:11:57,571 --> 01:12:02,571
watch the video that I remember gary I 
think is explaining it when he trained 

1666
01:12:02,571 --> 01:12:02,750
bj penn,
like you know,

1667
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:07,790
first we fixed his feet and then his 
hips and it's the same strategy for 

1668
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:08,810
remediating weakness.
Like you want to,

1669
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:14,340
you want to strengthen all these weak 
links first to get the kinetic chain 

1670
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:14,370
working,
you know all the way through.

1671
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:14,790
So.

1672
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:20,350
So if you get a guy and say the guy has 
lower back issues is really common with 

1673
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:21,900
bj players,
brazilian jujitsu guys that work,

1674
01:12:21,901 --> 01:12:26,901
the guard.
Especially a lot of them have lower 

1675
01:12:26,901 --> 01:12:26,901
eddie bravo.
Right.

1676
01:12:26,901 --> 01:12:27,810
He's just serious lower back problems.
What would you do

1677
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,320
that.
First of all I'd probably want to turn 

1678
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:36,200
them over and fill with his spine.
Feels like and feel for,

1679
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,900
for what the vertebraes lined up like 
and his hips.

1680
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,270
And then I.
And then I do

1681
01:12:40,420 --> 01:12:42,500
visual assessment of his lower back and 
tests.

1682
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:44,200
He's extremely flexible guy,
right?

1683
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:46,180
In some ways.
Tight hamstrings.

1684
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,470
So tight hamstrings.
Yeah.

1685
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,210
He's,
he's a guy that's fucked up.

1686
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:50,920
I can probably fix them up.
No problem.

1687
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:51,940
You think so?
Absolutely.

1688
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,680
Guaranteed.
Eddie bravo.

1689
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:54,280
Yeah.
Where are you?

1690
01:12:54,281 --> 01:12:54,850
Gonna?
Call nick.

1691
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,450
Let's go.
Eddie.

1692
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,000
I think I trained with him a long time 
ago,

1693
01:12:58,001 --> 01:13:00,100
man.
He used to wear the head gear and like a

1694
01:13:00,101 --> 01:13:01,630
wetsuit thing on.
Yeah,

1695
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:03,650
yeah,
yeah,

1696
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:06,030
yeah.
This was probably like 15 years ago when

1697
01:13:06,031 --> 01:13:08,730
he had really long hair.
He used to tuck in a wetsuit.

1698
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:10,810
Yeah,
it was pretty cool guy.

1699
01:13:11,450 --> 01:13:12,340
Yeah,
he's awesome.

1700
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:14,350
He's a character,
but his,

1701
01:13:14,351 --> 01:13:16,750
uh,
his flexibility's very unusual.

1702
01:13:16,751 --> 01:13:19,060
His leg dexter is very unusual in the 
hips.

1703
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,630
His ability to,
you know,

1704
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:24,100
like when you called jail break,
like say if you have them inside control

1705
01:13:24,101 --> 01:13:29,101
him,
he can pick his foot up without even 

1706
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:29,101
grabbing with his hand.

1707
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:29,101
Bring it across like that.
Yeah.

1708
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,300
Get a deep butterfly hook and in turn 
and face you.

1709
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,860
Yeah.
It's amazing.

1710
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:36,120
It's an amazing dexterity that he has 
now.

1711
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:41,121
I guarantee I can fix it.
I fixed nfl player's backs and those 

1712
01:13:41,121 --> 01:13:44,701
guys have the worst backs.
So savvy guy get a guy who's got some 

1713
01:13:44,701 --> 01:13:45,400
bulging disks,
a bunch of shit going on.

1714
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:51,190
That's kind of sketchy,
like I don't want to be sued for 

1715
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:51,190
anything,
you know what I mean,

1716
01:13:51,190 --> 01:13:55,261
and like,
but there are some tricks like traction 

1717
01:13:55,261 --> 01:13:57,511
stretches,
you can do like some manual therapy 

1718
01:13:57,511 --> 01:13:57,511
stuff that I've learned from a very 
like,

1719
01:13:57,511 --> 01:13:57,850
uh,
well,

1720
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,260
like,
well respected,

1721
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:01,870
um,
neurologist and physiologists,

1722
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:07,060
crazy russian guy scientists and uh,
so we've implemented a lot of that stuff

1723
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:08,650
to,
for the health of the spine.

1724
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,360
And uh,
yeah,

1725
01:14:10,361 --> 01:14:11,980
there's some stuff you do to relieve the
pressure

1726
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,600
there because back and neck,
those are really common with grapplers.

1727
01:14:16,601 --> 01:14:19,300
So I know so many wrestlers who have 
fused disks,

1728
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:22,270
like tito ortiz,
I think he's got three fused.

1729
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:27,510
He's got one in his neck fuse and I 
think he's got to and it's back one of 

1730
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:28,930
his lumbar and maybe one thoracic or 
something like that.

1731
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
Yeah,
I had to have the steroid injections in 

1732
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:34,000
my neck.
Dji herniated discs,

1733
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,850
five gen,
pretty aggro back then.

1734
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,510
And so I had the cortisone.
Yeah,

1735
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,240
exactly.
What are they,

1736
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:42,730
the,
they put you to sleep for that?

1737
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:43,720
Is that the cortisone?
Yeah,

1738
01:14:43,721 --> 01:14:44,520
I dunno.
Yeah,

1739
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:45,910
they put me under for it,
man.

1740
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:46,970
And it was,
it was,

1741
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:52,380
it was.
I couldn't sleep for three weeks before 

1742
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:52,380
I had the shots.
I mean I was up in so much pain.

1743
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,820
My atrophied,
it looked like a wet noodle.

1744
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,520
Yeah.
So you had a pretty good one.

1745
01:14:57,550 --> 01:14:59,060
What happened to your neck?
Uh,

1746
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:03,400
I got thrown into a wall and jujitsu and
I just crunched,

1747
01:15:03,401 --> 01:15:06,400
but I think it was more like years and 
years of building up,

1748
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:11,401
you know,
and then they found there's like a bone 

1749
01:15:11,401 --> 01:15:13,621
spur in there that like irritates the 
nerve and so they have to go in there 

1750
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:14,860
and take the bone spur out.
But I probably will one day,

1751
01:15:14,861 --> 01:15:19,150
but not yet.
I have so many friends that have atrophy

1752
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:22,920
issues with the neck where their arm 
shrinks.

1753
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:24,460
Yeah.
Bas rutten.

1754
01:15:24,461 --> 01:15:26,550
He had his neck fused.
He,

1755
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,530
he actually had some significant neck 
problems for years.

1756
01:15:29,710 --> 01:15:33,250
And then he was on thinkers on sons of 
anarchy,

1757
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,280
one of those shows where he was doing a 
stunt and they throw them on his head 

1758
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,760
and just cried,
man.

1759
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:44,770
Yeah.
And his arm just went foreign and then 

1760
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:44,770
it shrunk up.
Boy calls it baby arm.

1761
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:46,150
He's got one arm,
it's still to this day,

1762
01:15:46,151 --> 01:15:47,290
hasn't romoland.
Yeah,

1763
01:15:47,291 --> 01:15:50,890
he had several operations.
He has disc fused in his neck.

1764
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,430
He uh,
he had um,

1765
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:55,030
the,
the nerve opening.

1766
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,820
They go in there and they sort of carve 
it out,

1767
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:02,960
clear,
clear the opening to relieve the 

1768
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:05,341
pressure on the nerve and even that,
like he probably did it all too late in 

1769
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:10,861
his arm,
had been atrophied for so many years 

1770
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:10,861
that it just,
uh,

1771
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:13,480
it's a long process to rebuild the 
neuromag I know about that.

1772
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,040
There's out for you.
Yeah,

1773
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:18,310
well I was in a car accident till where 
I was actually rear ended.

1774
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:19,990
That guy was going about 100 miles an 
hour.

1775
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:21,130
Geez.
Yeah.

1776
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,220
So shattered my pelvis,
broke my hip.

1777
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:26,110
I've got a plate in there now.
Like a steel plate.

1778
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:27,070
Whoa.
Yeah.

1779
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:29,560
And so I was in a wheelchair for like 
six months,

1780
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:33,820
but the nerve,
like apart from all the muscular,

1781
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,160
you know,
rebuilding the muscular,

1782
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:38,680
the muscles and all that,
the nerve pain from the recovery was the

1783
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:39,250
worst.

1784
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,320
I mean I still have like right now I can
fill it up my foot.

1785
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:46,350
This is like 10 or 12 years ago and I 
just felt like animals were eating my 

1786
01:16:46,350 --> 01:16:50,371
toes off man.
I remember waking up one night like 

1787
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:52,651
screaming in pain,
like fuck did my foot as something 

1788
01:16:52,651 --> 01:16:54,220
eating my foot and I looked down there 
and the toes are kind of moving on their

1789
01:16:54,221 --> 01:16:56,860
own and that was the nerve waking back 
up.

1790
01:16:56,990 --> 01:16:59,290
Wow.
And it was excruciating.

1791
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:01,930
I mean even like I said,
even to this day I still feel it,

1792
01:17:01,931 --> 01:17:03,790
you know,
get some issues in my toes with that.

1793
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:07,510
But that's why a lot of guys didn't have
back pains and women as well.

1794
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,150
Obviously they,
they get really hooked on pain pills.

1795
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:13,680
It's like it gets to a point where I got
hooked on them,

1796
01:17:13,681 --> 01:17:18,681
man.
I'm not gonna lie to the point where I 

1797
01:17:18,681 --> 01:17:20,970
would take my pain pills and then I 
would take a laxative because this shit 

1798
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:20,970
makes you constipated.

1799
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,150
So like I was taking a lot of those 
things,

1800
01:17:23,151 --> 01:17:28,151
like on a daily basis,
you're doing that for four or five 

1801
01:17:28,151 --> 01:17:28,151
months,
man.

1802
01:17:28,151 --> 01:17:30,420
You're going to get hooked.
How'd you get off a?

1803
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,540
My will.
I think that was it.

1804
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:34,550
Yeah.
I'm weird like that,

1805
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:38,180
like I don't get addicted to things,
but like when I go too deep,

1806
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:39,830
if I feel like something bad's gonna 
happen to me,

1807
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:42,350
like emotionally or I can snap out of 
it,

1808
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:45,030
but yeah,
that's self preservation man.

1809
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,390
I got when I used to think about taking 
them,

1810
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:50,090
I get that taste like under my tongue,
like it candy,

1811
01:17:50,091 --> 01:17:52,000
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

1812
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:54,980
I mean it was brendan schaub said the 
same thing.

1813
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,590
A sharp didn't even realize he was 
hooked on him.

1814
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:02,591
He was taking them every day for like 
three or four months and then his 

1815
01:18:02,591 --> 01:18:04,310
friends apparently intervened and said,
hey dude,

1816
01:18:04,311 --> 01:18:06,320
you're fucking whacked out all day.

1817
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,690
You got to get off.
These pills were were the pills?

1818
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:13,960
They went to his house,
cleaned out his bathroom cabinet and 

1819
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:13,960
said,
enough,

1820
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,050
do we just did that with my buddy like 
two weeks ago?

1821
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,710
He had a dirt bike accident.
His fucking bone.

1822
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:22,280
Can I tell you a quick story?
Okay.

1823
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:27,340
You know what those things are.
Have you ever seen a razor scooter with 

1824
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:29,560
a cage around on either built to crash?
Oh no.

1825
01:18:29,700 --> 01:18:34,700
Fuck no.
I think I'm looking at a different 

1826
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,281
thing.
It's kinda like an atv but a little 

1827
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:36,281
bigger and two guys came like a dune 
buggy,

1828
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:38,390
like a miniature dune buggy with a cage 
around it and guys go up hills.

1829
01:18:38,391 --> 01:18:40,400
Like you can see all these fucking guys 
in the south.

1830
01:18:40,401 --> 01:18:45,401
Love them and yeah.
So you know where I'm going with this 

1831
01:18:45,401 --> 01:18:46,700
fucking gnarly.
So this guy killing my buddies,

1832
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:48,530
buy a brand new and they're like,
come on out.

1833
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:49,970
It'll be a great weekend,
man.

1834
01:18:49,971 --> 01:18:51,800
Let's go fucking writing this weekend.
Whatever.

1835
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:55,220
Long story short these guys ended up in 
the hospital,

1836
01:18:55,221 --> 01:18:58,020
they flipped the thing and one guy 
busted his scalpel open.

1837
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:00,050
He's got a whole like size of a golf 
ball,

1838
01:19:00,230 --> 01:19:05,230
broke his arm.
My other buddy broke his arm and like 

1839
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:06,260
four places just had surgery.
So our third friend who went with him,

1840
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,610
he called me.
He's like,

1841
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:08,990
man,
these guys have been in an accident.

1842
01:19:09,190 --> 01:19:14,190
The next day he sent someone,
sends me a text of him laying down with 

1843
01:19:14,190 --> 01:19:16,490
a bone popping out of his fucking go 
indian burial ground.

1844
01:19:16,491 --> 01:19:17,780
Dude,
what the fuck is this shit?

1845
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,130
You know what I mean,
like all these kids got made.

1846
01:19:22,131 --> 01:19:23,510
Yeah,
it's a great weekend guys.

1847
01:19:23,511 --> 01:19:28,511
Thanks.
But one of them got really hooked on 

1848
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,911
the,
on the pain meds and he went from being 

1849
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:30,911
a super active guy too,
just staying home all day,

1850
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:34,190
being hooked on pain meds and we were 
like really worried about him.

1851
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:35,810
Like he was calling us like crying like 
dude,

1852
01:19:35,811 --> 01:19:37,310
I'm going to do something bad.
I'm going to on.

1853
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:41,270
And we got this thing called bro chat on
facebook.

1854
01:19:41,271 --> 01:19:46,271
A bunch.
A group of our old buddies got together 

1855
01:19:46,271 --> 01:19:46,271
and we started a group chat like 
probably like two months ago.

1856
01:19:46,271 --> 01:19:50,830
I everyone who has practically been 
kicked off facebook for it for one 

1857
01:19:50,830 --> 01:19:52,250
reason or not sending pictures,
you can imagine the shit.

1858
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,520
But man,
we all got together on umbrella chat and

1859
01:19:55,521 --> 01:19:58,160
we saved his life to broach.
That saves.

1860
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:01,070
It,
saves it.

1861
01:20:01,071 --> 01:20:03,540
It pisses off wives because I swear to 
god,

1862
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,040
every one of us is on there until like 
1130 at night laughing our ass off.

1863
01:20:08,490 --> 01:20:12,540
All the girls are putting the babies to 
sleep the fucking flow,

1864
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,730
man.
You can get a girlfriend or something.

1865
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:20,220
A honey.
I'll give you a blow job if you get off 

1866
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:20,220
the phone.
I fucking wow.

1867
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:24,000
Hilarious.
Some bros before blowjobs like,

1868
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,340
yes,
not me.

1869
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:30,960
I'm the first one off.
I just go in there to save you,

1870
01:20:30,961 --> 01:20:31,650
man.
That's it.

1871
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:35,620
I've had several friends that have had 
like serious pill issues.

1872
01:20:35,621 --> 01:20:36,460
Uh,
it's,

1873
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:41,470
it's,
it's weird how prevalent they are and 

1874
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:41,470
how easy it is to get them.
Yeah.

1875
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:42,620
You know,
I had my nose fixed.

1876
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:44,850
I had a deviated septum so they cleared 
it all out,

1877
01:20:44,910 --> 01:20:48,990
cut the turbinates out.
Stretched open though the openings,

1878
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:54,020
like put splints in there and shit,
and actually kind of widened the 

1879
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,690
physical look of my nose and kind of 
changed a little bit because it was like

1880
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:58,020
a little more sucked in like nasal 
breathing.

1881
01:20:58,350 --> 01:20:59,100
Anyway.
Point is,

1882
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:01,500
it wasn't fucking painful.
Really mean.

1883
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:03,750
It was when it was over,
it was over and I need that.

1884
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:08,100
I have a deviated septum is one of the 
best things I've ever done.

1885
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:13,310
I didn't do it till I was like,
I think it was 39 or something like 

1886
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:13,310
that,
but once I did it was like,

1887
01:21:13,310 --> 01:21:15,140
yeah,
I get this big.

1888
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,190
Rafael just had that done.
Did he?

1889
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,400
Yeah.
He because of,

1890
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:21,960
I don't know if that had been going on 
for a long time.

1891
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:24,320
Like he had it so bad he couldn't even 
breathe that junior.

1892
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,660
Joe santos did as well.
Huh?

1893
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,300
Interesting.
Well it's just fighting,

1894
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,070
you know?
Yeah.

1895
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:31,230
I had my nose broken for the first time 
when I was five.

1896
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:34,770
I fell down a flight of stairs and it 
was always kind of crooked,

1897
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:37,100
like the bones kind of weird.
And it was inside.

1898
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:42,110
It was always fucked up.
But then years of just getting smashed 

1899
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:42,360
in the face,
he just gets awful.

1900
01:21:42,450 --> 01:21:47,450
It's a point like,
you remember vandelay would vandelays 

1901
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:47,450
knows you slipped from flat to his face.
Yeah,

1902
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,980
just smushed down.
No cartilage at all.

1903
01:21:49,981 --> 01:21:52,520
Everything just mushed.
And every bumper door,

1904
01:21:56,810 --> 01:21:58,870
farc the farc.
Right.

1905
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:00,210
Um,
he,

1906
01:22:00,211 --> 01:22:05,211
uh,
he had his fixed and he went deep the 

1907
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,551
other way.
You've got like an extra big nose so he 

1908
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:07,551
could breathe better.
Like they constructed,

1909
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:09,090
it knows out of his rib.
Let's see.

1910
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,260
Yeah,
it looks really.

1911
01:22:11,370 --> 01:22:13,380
How dare you.
I dare you.

1912
01:22:13,381 --> 01:22:15,150
I see you're being sarcastic.
Well,

1913
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,390
I mean for practical purposes,
you want to be a fighter,

1914
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:19,980
really smarter,
which shows a lack of vanity.

1915
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:22,830
It does.
And he didn't try to look at all.

1916
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:25,070
He cut out all the scar tissue in his 
neck,

1917
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:26,330
that eyebrows,
you know,

1918
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:27,540
because he was getting that.

1919
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:30,000
There's another thing that fighters get,
is that sort of relaxed,

1920
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:32,380
it impedes vision.
Absolutely.

1921
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:35,940
In some guys have it so bad that you can
see there are lids.

1922
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:41,180
Yeah.
Because I guess it's from punishment 

1923
01:22:41,180 --> 01:22:43,940
from getting hit repetitive scar tissue,
scar tissue and also like the relaxation

1924
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:46,260
of the muscle.
That new nurse probably.

1925
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:49,380
Yeah.
So it starts to fall over the eye and it

1926
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:51,570
actually gets in the way.
It's vandelay,

1927
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:53,880
but that's vandelay before he got fucked
up.

1928
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,890
That's vandelay.
That's when he was young.

1929
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:59,070
Probably like 2003.
That's uh,

1930
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:04,100
that's the early days of annually.
That's vandelay when he was the pride 

1931
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:05,610
channel and labeled knows number one.
Well,

1932
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:09,220
you got to see vandelay in like,
that's what he looks like now.

1933
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,390
I mean his eyes are different,
but that's not what it looked like right

1934
01:23:13,391 --> 01:23:18,391
after the surgery.
Like that's his face with cat woman 

1935
01:23:18,391 --> 01:23:18,500
after the surgery.

1936
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,280
Right.
He came onto the scales,

1937
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,270
uh,
at the,

1938
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:24,880
uh,
at the ufc and he was cornering.

1939
01:23:24,881 --> 01:23:28,270
Somebody stepped up to the cage.
Like that's him.

1940
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,190
You see where the pink tape on his 
gloves.

1941
01:23:30,370 --> 01:23:32,560
That's him and his,
his best.

1942
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,500
That's before his nose was fucked up.
That's when,

1943
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:38,530
that's probably him in 2001 or something
like that.

1944
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:41,890
I mean that was a,
that was vandelay in his prime.

1945
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:46,891
I want to say that looks like it was 
right before rampage jackson or 

1946
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:46,891
something like that.
Two thousand one,

1947
01:23:46,891 --> 01:23:47,980
2002.
His nose was fine.

1948
01:23:48,130 --> 01:23:50,230
And then if you see like vandelay versus
chocolate dell,

1949
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:52,990
I have a poster on my wall in my gym at 
home,

1950
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:58,290
have a vandelay versus chocolate.
Dell and vandelays knows is just 

1951
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:00,640
smashed.
It's just like flattened to his face.

1952
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:06,230
And that was a,
like that one where his arms are up in 

1953
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:06,230
the air.

1954
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:06,230
Jamie,
see that picture up there,

1955
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:08,380
like click on that.
Go go large on that.

1956
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:11,330
You could see in that one.
I think that's,

1957
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,340
that's it seems like after the 
[inaudible] fight that it's tough to 

1958
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:16,340
tell there.
But for a lot of tHe fights,

1959
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:18,640
like his nose was just useless.
He couldn't breathe out of it.

1960
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:23,760
So he went the other way and he got this
fucking crazy nose job where they gave 

1961
01:24:23,831 --> 01:24:25,660
them a bigger nose so he could breathe 
out of it.

1962
01:24:25,661 --> 01:24:27,610
Yeah.
so you see like knows number three,

1963
01:24:28,250 --> 01:24:30,070
like that image right there.
Yeah.

1964
01:24:30,330 --> 01:24:31,580
Look,
look how much bigger is this?

1965
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:37,200
But that's smart.
It's like he did that so he could 

1966
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:37,200
breathe out of it better.
There's a lot bigger,

1967
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:41,410
like the bone or the cartilage,
you could see it like goes lower.

1968
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,860
Like when you're talking to them it went
lower to like sort of like he has a big 

1969
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,900
accentuated cartlidge there.

1970
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,110
That guy has taken some fucking 
punishment.

1971
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,900
You want to talk about a warrior for 
christ.

1972
01:24:56,590 --> 01:25:01,390
I mean that guy has been in fucking wars
like down there.

1973
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:06,420
You see all those images.
Look at that one where he's got the 

1974
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:06,420
white tank top right there,
to the right of that,

1975
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:06,420
right below.
That it right there.

1976
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:09,730
That's where you could see a tough now,
not even at his worst.

1977
01:25:10,430 --> 01:25:12,910
It's not even at its worst.
At its worst was right before we got the

1978
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:17,911
operation.
I think it was just completely that 

1979
01:25:17,911 --> 01:25:20,221
after the operation right there.
I think that might be photoshop him.

1980
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:26,190
He was jimmy duranti for halloween,
but that's a dated right there.

1981
01:25:26,351 --> 01:25:28,450
Right there.
That black one in the black shirt.

1982
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:29,920
Oh man.
Yeah.

1983
01:25:29,940 --> 01:25:32,560
His nose pretty smashed there,
but that might be after a fight.

1984
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:36,490
Yeah,
I mean that's not even at the worst.

1985
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:41,491
I mean he's.
That guy has taken some fucking insane 

1986
01:25:41,491 --> 01:25:43,450
damage in his career and we've watched 
his face alter because of that damage.

1987
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:48,400
Out of all the fighters in the ufc and 
in pride and in mma in general.

1988
01:25:48,401 --> 01:25:51,160
His face as altered the most because of 
punishment.

1989
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:54,480
[inaudible] probably second close.
Yeah,

1990
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:58,150
but mandalay's more than anybody because
he's the one that got it fixed.

1991
01:25:58,180 --> 01:26:03,180
He's the only.
Only one of those guys that got it 

1992
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:05,131
fixed.
Nick diaz had some stuff done to his 

1993
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:05,131
eyebrows

1994
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:06,040
till you said he had so much scar tissue
that had.

1995
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:10,060
He actually had his bone shaved down to 
because it's the edges of his bones.

1996
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,860
I'll cut you.
A couple of guys.

1997
01:26:12,861 --> 01:26:15,890
I trained in the Philippines like that.
They're pretty susceptible to cut.

1998
01:26:15,940 --> 01:26:17,330
You want to see some boxers,
man.

1999
01:26:18,380 --> 01:26:20,600
He's like,
did you see the genetic,

2000
01:26:20,601 --> 01:26:22,950
lufkin and chocolate?
Yeah,

2001
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:23,750
totally.
Dude,

2002
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:25,910
you want to go see getting a glove can 
this weekend at the forum?

2003
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:26,540
They got me.
I said,

2004
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:27,470
no,
I want to go see chocolate.

2005
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:29,960
Tito.
Tito is a bad dude.

2006
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:33,410
He is.
One of my guys fought him in Japan about

2007
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:37,160
maybe six months ago and I did a hell of
a lot better than the other guy.

2008
01:26:37,980 --> 01:26:39,070
Kind of stopped short.
we,

2009
01:26:39,140 --> 01:26:41,900
I don't think we would want to.
We probably wouldn't have won that fight

2010
01:26:41,901 --> 01:26:42,650
either way.
You know,

2011
01:26:42,700 --> 01:26:44,000
chocolate tito's amazing.

2012
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,480
But uh,
these lighter weight division is 1:12

2013
01:26:47,481 --> 01:26:52,481
division and the [inaudible] eight 
division right now are like exciting 

2014
01:26:52,481 --> 01:26:55,601
divisions and I'm,
I'm just stoked that they got some 

2015
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:56,890
coverage in the us,
like on hbo shows.

2016
01:26:56,891 --> 01:26:59,090
Like I mean it's,
it's really a stacked.

2017
01:26:59,091 --> 01:27:00,890
If you really look into it.
THe lighter weight man,

2018
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:02,740
it's really stacked and there's a lot of
action,

2019
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,010
a lot of knockouts,
as long as they have short referees,

2020
01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:11,400
like a jockey that'd be sick.
He didn't like.

2021
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,300
If you have a 108 pound fighter,
you got to have a little tiny reference.

2022
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:15,110
Right.
You know,

2023
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,300
and maybe slower the ropes a little bit 
too.

2024
01:27:17,301 --> 01:27:20,120
Like you did a good move.
I really thought about that.

2025
01:27:20,121 --> 01:27:25,121
The last fight you see better,
but I got a guy who I trained in the 

2026
01:27:25,121 --> 01:27:26,510
Philippines,
daunting yet says noni,

2027
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:31,870
and yet he's the longest reigning 
filipino champion of all time and this 

2028
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,110
guy is such an exciting fighter.

2029
01:27:33,110 --> 01:27:34,680
He moved,
his nickname is aha.

2030
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:37,670
Switch in the gulag means snake.
Oh.

2031
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:40,850
So he moves like a snake in the ring.
Like his head movement.

2032
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:43,670
He,
his speed and timing are just on another

2033
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:48,671
level,
but he's got one punch knockout power 

2034
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:48,671
for 100,
eight pound fighter.

2035
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:50,410
It's ridiculous.
The power of this sky generates whatever

2036
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:51,710
happened in novato,
dinair.

2037
01:27:51,770 --> 01:27:56,770
He's a.
I'm actually gonna be seeing him in a 

2038
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:56,770
few weeks in the Philippines.
He's a,

2039
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:01,720
I worked with him for one flight and I 
actually ended up having to leave like 

2040
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:01,970
maybe like three or four weeks before 
the fight,

2041
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:03,500
you know,
some things,

2042
01:28:03,501 --> 01:28:04,780
whatever.
But um,

2043
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,330
he kinda,
I think my personal opinion,

2044
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,790
I liked the guy as a person.
He's a fucking great guy.

2045
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,720
Did like a really cool person.
Seems very cool.

2046
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:14,540
He really is.
But I think what he got that fighter the

2047
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,360
year thing I maybe went to head a little
bit and then,

2048
01:28:17,361 --> 01:28:18,590
you know,
I'm sure you're probably hearing this.

2049
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:21,560
Oh sorry did.
But I think it went to his head a little

2050
01:28:21,561 --> 01:28:26,561
bit and maybe the ego got in the way and
he kind of stopped listening to the 

2051
01:28:26,561 --> 01:28:28,100
coaches and it was evident in the 
walters fight,

2052
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,300
you know,
he even said like,

2053
01:28:29,301 --> 01:28:34,301
I stopped listening to my dad,
I should have been listening to my dad 

2054
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:34,301
on the corner and look what happened.
You know,

2055
01:28:34,301 --> 01:28:37,100
and I said this in the training camp,
some people in his entourage.

2056
01:28:37,101 --> 01:28:37,730
I said,
you know what?

2057
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:39,740
He's not listening to me.
He's not,

2058
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:42,290
he's coaching his dad like had to train 
him like,

2059
01:28:42,900 --> 01:28:46,010
you know,
this guy could potentially be one of the

2060
01:28:46,011 --> 01:28:51,011
best boxers we've ever seen.
If he just listened and I was at this 

2061
01:28:51,011 --> 01:28:51,011
rate,
something's going to happen.

2062
01:28:51,011 --> 01:28:52,250
He's going,
they're going to get knocked out or he's

2063
01:28:52,251 --> 01:28:57,251
going to get hurt and then everybody's 
going to snap it and they're going to 

2064
01:28:57,251 --> 01:28:57,251
say,
hey,

2065
01:28:57,251 --> 01:28:57,620
we should have fucking done this or we 
should've done that.

2066
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,020
You know what I mean?
And now he's doing it.

2067
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,130
He's,
he's back and he's dedicated

2068
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,140
to late.
How old is he now?

2069
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:05,670
He's 30.
I think he's 31,

2070
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,970
but I have a really lightweight.
He's fighting a 1:22

2071
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:09,770
I think now.
Right?

2072
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:12,110
Is that right?
I think so killed.

2073
01:29:12,450 --> 01:29:15,060
Did he like the guys in his division?
He'll destroy them.

2074
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:16,350
Yeah,
he started to.

2075
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,400
It just seems like that at that age,
at the lower weight classes,

2076
01:29:21,930 --> 01:29:25,870
age is like if he was 32 years old and 
he was fighting and heavyweight,

2077
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:26,320
I was like,
oh,

2078
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:28,080
he's going to keep going.
Yeah,

2079
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:31,110
I mean those.
It seems like heavyweights mature later.

2080
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,850
Do you agree with that?
Uh,

2081
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:33,960
you know,
I don't know to be honest.

2082
01:29:33,990 --> 01:29:36,340
Maybe I was wondering about that.
Actually.

2083
01:29:36,341 --> 01:29:37,830
One of the things I wanted to ask you 
about is it,

2084
01:29:37,890 --> 01:29:42,030
is it because like a guy like vladimir 
klitschko,

2085
01:29:42,031 --> 01:29:45,150
so just this massive person,
I always wondered like,

2086
01:29:45,151 --> 01:29:50,151
does it take longer to develop 
efficiency of movement and the ability 

2087
01:29:50,761 --> 01:29:53,400
to move your body better to 
understanding your body if you have more

2088
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,600
of it to,
to learn.

2089
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:58,500
If you're,
say if you're dealing with a much larger

2090
01:29:58,501 --> 01:30:00,420
frame,
much more body mass.

2091
01:30:00,450 --> 01:30:03,030
Yeah.
So is it more gravity?

2092
01:30:03,031 --> 01:30:08,031
You're dealing with more gravity,
you're dealing with the influence of 

2093
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:08,031
that gravity.
It slows you down.

2094
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:08,910
You're obviously slower in a lighter way
person.

2095
01:30:08,911 --> 01:30:12,570
Is it more difficult to develop mastery 
of skill?

2096
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:16,390
Yeah,
I think that's a good question,

2097
01:30:16,391 --> 01:30:17,860
joel.
I think there is some,

2098
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:21,250
maybe some truth to that.
Like the length of the limb requires the

2099
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:24,490
leverage that you get on the muscles.
It's going to be a lot greater.

2100
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:29,500
Like the torque you need to generate out
of the smaller muscles to control the 

2101
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:29,830
larger lamb.
Of course,

2102
01:30:29,831 --> 01:30:34,831
that's gonna play a big role,
so the length of the limb can determine 

2103
01:30:34,831 --> 01:30:36,460
how much,
how much force you can produce also,

2104
01:30:36,550 --> 01:30:39,670
so it'll play a role on the mechanics.
But I think uh,

2105
01:30:39,730 --> 01:30:40,700
yeah,
I think uh,

2106
01:30:41,110 --> 01:30:44,710
I think it is maybe a little bit harder 
for some of those big guys just strictly

2107
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:45,580
like on the,
on the,

2108
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:49,360
I don't know,
maybe it's the relative strength,

2109
01:30:49,930 --> 01:30:50,620
you know,
I don't know.

2110
01:30:50,621 --> 01:30:51,970
I really can't answer that.
I don't know.

2111
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:55,830
I always felt like they're just,
they're dealing with more gravity.

2112
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:58,770
Like it seemed to me that like lighter 
weight guys,

2113
01:30:59,070 --> 01:31:04,070
especially back in the kickboxing days,
I had noticed that the lighter weight 

2114
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:06,690
guys seem to learn quicker.
They seem to pick up the skills quicker.

2115
01:31:06,740 --> 01:31:08,610
There are obviously always faster

2116
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:14,040
be a higher degree of relative strength 
to like your strength to bodyweight 

2117
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:14,680
ratio.
So,

2118
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:14,840
or

2119
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:20,670
could have something to do with it 
because the other thing is you never see

2120
01:31:20,830 --> 01:31:23,650
a guy at heavyweight that can move like 
mighty mouse,

2121
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:25,570
right?
Like they just don't exist now.

2122
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:26,650
I mean,
you look at,

2123
01:31:26,860 --> 01:31:29,170
if you watch mighty mouse,
demetrius johnson,

2124
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,710
the ufc flyweight champion,
the guy who my opinion is best pound for

2125
01:31:32,711 --> 01:31:37,711
pound fighter in the world.
I think when it comes to taking the 

2126
01:31:37,711 --> 01:31:41,641
least amount of punishment,
the ability to make great fighters look 

2127
01:31:41,641 --> 01:31:44,821
average,
the ability to impose his skillset and 

2128
01:31:44,821 --> 01:31:48,210
never runs out of gas and is always 
technically he's always in the best 

2129
01:31:48,210 --> 01:31:48,970
position.
He's always doing the right thing.

2130
01:31:48,971 --> 01:31:50,650
Like he's really,
really well trained.

2131
01:31:51,010 --> 01:31:56,010
I don't,
I've never seen a fucking heavyweight 

2132
01:31:56,010 --> 01:31:58,260
even remotely move like that.
Like the best heavyweight in the world 

2133
01:31:58,260 --> 01:31:59,740
is cain velasquez obviously,
and he's to beat purdue.

2134
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:00,040
It's

2135
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:05,040
tough fight.
Very tough fIght because his big 

2136
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:05,570
strength is taking guys down,
you know,

2137
01:32:05,690 --> 01:32:07,660
take down.
You're in a world of shit.

2138
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:10,540
Yeah.
That guy is no joke off his back.

2139
01:32:10,570 --> 01:32:15,570
His fucking guard is head and shoulders 
above anybody that cane has ever faced 

2140
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:16,480
without a doubt.
Absolutely.

2141
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:18,400
I don't know who he brought in to train 
with it,

2142
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:19,930
but they're not good enough.
No.

2143
01:32:19,990 --> 01:32:21,940
Who the fuck are you going to bring it?
Unless you bring it in,

2144
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,030
you'd have to bring in a vinny 
magallanes,

2145
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:29,280
someone who is a go really and only 
specifically work the ground aspect of 

2146
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,110
it because vinny can't hang with volume 
on the feet.

2147
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:33,990
Right.
BecAuse hafez,

2148
01:32:33,991 --> 01:32:38,991
al has done an amazing job of of taking 
those guys and turning them into 

2149
01:32:40,181 --> 01:32:41,930
kickboxers.
I mean he's.

2150
01:32:41,950 --> 01:32:43,630
He's just fucking.
He's a master.

2151
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:46,650
Hockfield codero.
One of the original guys for shoot box,

2152
01:32:46,660 --> 01:32:51,660
the original brazilian berzerker camp at
occurred t but Brazil are fucking 

2153
01:32:51,660 --> 01:32:51,790
animals,
man.

2154
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:55,360
They were just the most feared camp ever
at the time,

2155
01:32:55,361 --> 01:33:00,361
you know,
but he's so smart and so skIllful at 

2156
01:33:00,361 --> 01:33:03,280
taking those like grapplers and turning 
them into elite strikers.

2157
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:08,610
You look at dosantos,
you look at verdugo for doom out 

2158
01:33:08,610 --> 01:33:12,001
kickbox,
travis fucking brown and chris travis 

2159
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:12,001
brown's and animal,
you know,

2160
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:16,251
you figure if we're doing is going to be
travis browne was going to take them 

2161
01:33:16,251 --> 01:33:16,251
down,
submit them,

2162
01:33:16,251 --> 01:33:16,251
right?
No,

2163
01:33:16,251 --> 01:33:17,860
he kicked his ass standing.
I mean that was crazy.

2164
01:33:18,050 --> 01:33:21,290
Watch him double jab travis brown,
you know,

2165
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:26,670
being that was crazy to watch.
When you go back to his fight with 

2166
01:33:26,670 --> 01:33:30,930
junior dos santos or even before that,
his fights and pride and you see the 

2167
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:33,430
rudimentary striking he had back then 
and then you look at his abilities now.

2168
01:33:33,700 --> 01:33:34,860
Pretty god damn impressive.

2169
01:33:34,980 --> 01:33:38,550
Cornell has a great striking coach and a
humble guy too.

2170
01:33:38,551 --> 01:33:39,900
Really,
really nice.

2171
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:41,700
He's a great guy.
I love that dude.

2172
01:33:41,970 --> 01:33:46,970
But if you.
You look at the best fighters in the 

2173
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:46,970
world,
the two best guys,

2174
01:33:46,970 --> 01:33:49,260
the two best guys in the heavyweight 
division currently the best of all time.

2175
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:53,360
I kinda gotta go with fader.
I just think fade or.

2176
01:33:53,430 --> 01:33:55,440
Yeah,
I think he's the best of all time in the

2177
01:33:55,441 --> 01:33:57,080
heavyweight division.
I just don't,

2178
01:33:57,180 --> 01:34:02,180
I mean maybe became with a beat him.
I would've loved to seen them about the 

2179
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:02,180
natural.
Um,

2180
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:05,790
randy is really a light heavyweight and 
heavyweight.

2181
01:34:05,850 --> 01:34:08,160
He was undersized.
I mean he was a great,

2182
01:34:08,161 --> 01:34:11,160
great fighter,
but I think honestly,

2183
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:13,320
pound for pound,
I just don't.

2184
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,970
I mean fado easily could have been two.
Oh,

2185
01:34:15,971 --> 01:34:16,890
five,
two by the way.

2186
01:34:17,330 --> 01:34:18,150
No,
he waSn't a,

2187
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:23,270
it wasn't a like when you see a guy like
that's carrying around all that extra 

2188
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:23,270
fat,
what do you think about that?

2189
01:34:23,270 --> 01:34:24,180
Like cain carrIes around extra.

2190
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:25,410
Yeah.
Uh,

2191
01:34:26,730 --> 01:34:27,920
I think as long,
you know,

2192
01:34:28,410 --> 01:34:28,980
again,
that's,

2193
01:34:28,981 --> 01:34:31,620
that's uh,
doesn't matter,

2194
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:34,420
obviously not,
but it does it mean,

2195
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:35,850
look,
he's obviously a monster,

2196
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,830
but would it be better if he had very 
little muslin?

2197
01:34:40,770 --> 01:34:41,820
No,
not necessarily.

2198
01:34:41,821 --> 01:34:46,821
No,
because that goes back to what we're 

2199
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:46,821
saying about the rate of force 
development and how,

2200
01:34:46,821 --> 01:34:51,270
if you look how explosive fader is 
despite not being looking like hercules.

2201
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:52,160
Right,
right.

2202
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,730
That goes back to what we're talking 
about,

2203
01:34:53,731 --> 01:34:55,950
the rate of forced development and how 
the nervous system,

2204
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,400
you know,
plays the greatest role In how much 

2205
01:35:01,400 --> 01:35:02,300
force you produce,
so how explosive you are.

2206
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:07,510
He's an interesting case too,
in that he started off his career early 

2207
01:35:07,510 --> 01:35:08,240
on.
He was into heavy kettle bells,

2208
01:35:08,241 --> 01:35:10,220
did a lot of lifting,
and he was a thicker,

2209
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,010
bigger guy.
And then as time went on,

2210
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:18,160
he,
he talked about how he didn't lift 

2211
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:18,160
weights anymore and he just relied on 
skill training.

2212
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:23,460
He just would wrestle.
And sambo and kickboxing and all that 

2213
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,270
stuff.
I don't remember you asking.

2214
01:35:24,290 --> 01:35:26,990
I think I heard a show you're asking,
you know,

2215
01:35:26,991 --> 01:35:28,550
you're wondering what the russian guys 
are doing.

2216
01:35:28,551 --> 01:35:29,840
Like these wrestling guys.
I'm like,

2217
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:31,250
what are they doing for their 
conditioning?

2218
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:34,850
The truth is not much.
They're not doing weights.

2219
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:36,290
a lot of them,
they're just wrestling.

2220
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:38,500
I know this because a,
I don't know if you know,

2221
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:40,530
I train aaron peko.
Are you familiar with their agenda?

2222
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:42,050
Yeah.
So he's one of my guys too.

2223
01:35:42,550 --> 01:35:47,550
Um,
so I trained him and he goes out there 

2224
01:35:47,550 --> 01:35:49,511
for months at a time and changes with 
the russians and the ukrainian national 

2225
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:49,511
teams and he says,
no,

2226
01:35:49,511 --> 01:35:49,970
they're just wrestle.
That's it.

2227
01:35:50,030 --> 01:35:51,410
No strength and conditioning.
Not really.

2228
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,350
Wow.
What do you think?

2229
01:35:53,351 --> 01:35:54,890
I'm gonna do some running and stuff like
that.

2230
01:35:55,190 --> 01:35:57,770
I think uh,
well they've got great wrestlers.

2231
01:35:58,040 --> 01:36:01,070
So I would almost rather have that than 
have a detrimental thing.

2232
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:03,500
And they're like heavy weight lifting or
something like that.

2233
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:04,720
So you'd have.
Yeah.

2234
01:36:04,820 --> 01:36:09,820
I would rather have them just focusing 
all their energy on their skill and 

2235
01:36:09,820 --> 01:36:14,111
doing some cardiovascular training.
Have you ever seen the workouts that 

2236
01:36:14,111 --> 01:36:15,950
cain velasquez don't know how you want 
to throw up?

2237
01:36:16,490 --> 01:36:17,440
Sure.
Okay.

2238
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:19,850
Yeah.
I don't mean a good way to say it out.

2239
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:24,920
Cain velasquez has some weight lifting 
routines that he has some guy working 

2240
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:25,820
out with them.
I showed it to steve maxwell.

2241
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:27,470
Steve maxwell got angry.
Really?

2242
01:36:27,500 --> 01:36:28,460
Yeah.
Let's check it out.

2243
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:29,510
It's like got a video.
Yeah.

2244
01:36:29,511 --> 01:36:34,040
Show show I'm kettle bell swings.
He's doing like really heavy kettle bell

2245
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:35,870
swings.
I'm not lying.

2246
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,150
Maxwell got angry.
You really get angry.

2247
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,100
Steve maxwell the kettlebell and master,
rIght?

2248
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:43,400
Like I been do it for a long time now,
but he's not just kettlebell master.

2249
01:36:43,401 --> 01:36:48,390
He says like an overall fitness guru.
He understands the human body.

2250
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:51,770
He's like a real student of all sorts of
different modalities.

2251
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:53,420
Like watch this,
watch this.

2252
01:36:53,870 --> 01:36:56,980
He's got this giant kettle bell.
Look at this.

2253
01:36:59,030 --> 01:36:59,830
He's like,
kinda.

2254
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:03,400
It's almost like he's doing like tend is
look at.

2255
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:07,070
It's not really a swing because he's 
kind of pulling it up more like a,

2256
01:37:07,140 --> 01:37:08,960
like almost like a dead lift.
yeah,

2257
01:37:09,400 --> 01:37:11,480
I mean it's got got to make them 
stronger,

2258
01:37:11,481 --> 01:37:16,340
but the lower back thing he's doing is 
not swing like he's popping it up.

2259
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:20,600
Right.
Whereas every other kettle bell swing,

2260
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:22,120
you'll see.
I just fell off.

2261
01:37:22,140 --> 01:37:27,140
I don't.
I have no idea how it's gonna help in 

2262
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:27,140
the new ufc,
ms.to

2263
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:27,950
make them stronger.
I guess it's wrong or it's going to make

2264
01:37:27,951 --> 01:37:32,951
them stronger at doing kettlebell.
I bet about it lay some pipe like a 

2265
01:37:32,951 --> 01:37:36,011
motherfucker,
see if he can find a correct technique.

2266
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:44,290
Double-handed kettlebell swing online,
like maybe maxwell has a video or 

2267
01:37:44,290 --> 01:37:46,350
someone or mike mauler is very good at 
that and he.

2268
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:51,430
He's a.
He's a great instructor as far as like 

2269
01:37:51,430 --> 01:37:56,350
proper fundamentals,
but there's a bunch of those that he 

2270
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:56,350
has.

2271
01:37:56,350 --> 01:37:59,830
Like one of them is leg extensions.
I'll show you the cain velasquez leg 

2272
01:37:59,830 --> 01:38:02,481
extension one.
You'll throw up at that one too because 

2273
01:38:02,481 --> 01:38:05,181
he's doing like 300 pounds.
Leg extensions needs to happen.

2274
01:38:07,620 --> 01:38:10,050
Crazy.
Both shoulders blown out,

2275
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:12,150
shoulders repaired.
See this guy,

2276
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:17,151
this guy's using three pounds.
It's might not be the best guy to look 

2277
01:38:17,151 --> 01:38:17,730
at it,
but this is how it's supposed to look.

2278
01:38:18,610 --> 01:38:23,610
Right.
He's popping his hips forward and the 

2279
01:38:23,610 --> 01:38:26,300
arm swings.
That's why it's called the kettlebell 

2280
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:26,300
swing phase two,
like 10,

2281
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:28,440
15 years ago.
You were early adopter.

2282
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:29,940
Yeah.
I love them.

2283
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:32,260
My favorite thing to work out with,
you know what I like,

2284
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:33,730
uh,
for an athlete I wouldn't have them do.

2285
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:34,650
Um,
to be honest.

2286
01:38:34,830 --> 01:38:39,830
Yeah.
But for guys like you and me as we're 

2287
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,591
getting older and I'm going to be 42,
like I need to keep the muscle along a 

2288
01:38:42,591 --> 01:38:42,591
little bit.

2289
01:38:42,591 --> 01:38:43,350
So yeah,
for general fitness,

2290
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:45,780
I don't think there's anything wrong.
Performance wise.

2291
01:38:46,350 --> 01:38:47,910
Like I said,
the movement pattern there.

2292
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:50,100
You're sitting back on your heels,
you're training.

2293
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,660
Excuse me.
You're sitting back on your heels,

2294
01:38:51,661 --> 01:38:53,790
you're training yourself to,
to.

2295
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:59,420
I felt that affect me.
Like I've been in that position where 

2296
01:38:59,420 --> 01:38:59,420
I've been training with guys and I'm 
like,

2297
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,850
fuck,
why is this guy taking me down?

2298
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:05,860
I'm way better than this dude,
but he's beating me to the punch every 

2299
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:06,060
time because I was sitting back on my 
heels.

2300
01:39:06,061 --> 01:39:08,340
I was in that kettlebell posture when 
I'm standing there,

2301
01:39:09,620 --> 01:39:12,930
I'm standing there with my back then and
my heels are flat on the ground.

2302
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:16,740
Why couldn't I get off my toes?
Because I've trained my body to sit back

2303
01:39:16,741 --> 01:39:18,600
on the heels.
That's interesting.

2304
01:39:18,601 --> 01:39:20,040
So you,
your Body.

2305
01:39:20,041 --> 01:39:22,560
I automatIcally went into that posture.
Exactly.

2306
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:24,150
So you can retrain that though.

2307
01:39:24,150 --> 01:39:26,040
That's the good thing.
It takes some time,

2308
01:39:26,041 --> 01:39:28,090
but he trained the forefoot.
So you're quick around.

2309
01:39:28,590 --> 01:39:30,180
How many times have you heard it in 
sports?

2310
01:39:30,181 --> 01:39:31,770
Man,
these guys are on their toes now.

2311
01:39:31,771 --> 01:39:34,200
They really looked great in there.
You know?

2312
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:36,480
What do you think about like turkish 
getups from grappling?

2313
01:39:36,510 --> 01:39:39,670
I'm a big fan of those.
I just,

2314
01:39:40,530 --> 01:39:42,270
I don't know how that plays into 
grappling.

2315
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:45,090
Just being able to lift heavy weight off
of you,

2316
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:48,660
get up off your back,
have that ct scan like,

2317
01:39:48,661 --> 01:39:49,990
I don't know.
I think at a high proof,

2318
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,980
really proficient level of jujitsu,
you're not going to lift anything off.

2319
01:39:52,990 --> 01:39:55,230
You're going to move around it.
You know what I mean?

2320
01:39:55,231 --> 01:39:57,840
like maybe the best shoulder stability,
maybe.

2321
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:01,630
Does it help them that way?
It's only going to help wherever,

2322
01:40:01,710 --> 01:40:02,850
you know what I don't know.

2323
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:07,870
This problem with my back and this guy 
gave me advice.

2324
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:12,550
This guy was a strength and conditioning
coach to do a lot of windmills.

2325
01:40:12,730 --> 01:40:14,580
He was like windmills,
you know,

2326
01:40:14,630 --> 01:40:18,550
kettlebell wind like dropping down like 
that and really good for stabilizing the

2327
01:40:18,551 --> 01:40:21,310
spine,
stabilized in the shoulder joint and you

2328
01:40:21,311 --> 01:40:25,580
know that.
Anything that is in the thoracic area,

2329
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:29,470
in the cervical area as well?
Yeah.

2330
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:31,630
What do you think about neck exercises?

2331
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:35,530
I love him.
Do you think on like the neck bridging?

2332
01:40:35,531 --> 01:40:38,080
I think that the desks are so small and 
the nac,

2333
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:43,110
that man I used to do like 45 pound 
plates on my chest and do the neck 

2334
01:40:43,110 --> 01:40:44,190
bridge is on the back of my head.
Real.

2335
01:40:44,191 --> 01:40:49,191
It's just stupid.
I've got this exercising machine straps 

2336
01:40:49,191 --> 01:40:50,920
on your head.
I mean you look like a retard,

2337
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:55,690
like isn't that a good way machine?
Is that or is it a different thing?

2338
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:57,790
Yeah.
Maybe I have a picture or something.

2339
01:40:57,791 --> 01:41:00,130
I don't know if I have a picture on my 
instagram or not,

2340
01:41:00,131 --> 01:41:01,220
but no,
it's.

2341
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,220
What's it called?
Do you call it halo?

2342
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:04,570
Oh,
I've seen that.

2343
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:09,600
Have you got a strap under the chin and 
a velcro strap on the top and you pump 

2344
01:41:10,301 --> 01:41:12,340
it up with air and it's like this big 
metal thing.

2345
01:41:12,341 --> 01:41:17,341
I mean you look,
you look ridiculous wearing it and what 

2346
01:41:17,341 --> 01:41:17,341
do you do?

2347
01:41:17,341 --> 01:41:18,010
And you can exercise in all ranges of 
motion.

2348
01:41:18,011 --> 01:41:23,011
It has like an elastic band that you'll 
attach to a wall so you can put just a 

2349
01:41:23,011 --> 01:41:26,611
little bit of tension,
tension on it to see if we can find 

2350
01:41:26,611 --> 01:41:26,611
that.
Jeremy.

2351
01:41:26,611 --> 01:41:26,611
If not,
I have a video on my phone.

2352
01:41:26,611 --> 01:41:29,310
I don't know if he can show that on 
there but probably will.

2353
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:32,140
But it's pretty cool.
If you could email it to him,

2354
01:41:32,141 --> 01:41:35,500
he could show it.
Don't give out no battery or though.

2355
01:41:35,860 --> 01:41:38,970
No,
you don't have a battery charger.

2356
01:41:39,130 --> 01:41:41,220
So I'm sure that's an iphone.
Yeah.

2357
01:41:41,450 --> 01:41:42,550
It's.
Or this thing.

2358
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:46,540
Is this it right here?
A similar to that halo?

2359
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:52,740
No,
this one is a little more hardcore than 

2360
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:52,740
When I got this.
about like seven or 800 bucks.

2361
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:57,040
Does it have a um,
so it has a rubber band?

2362
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:02,100
yeah,
it's got like a band attachment to that 

2363
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:02,100
man,
I think we're saying.

2364
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:03,160
Yeah.
And I'll show you.

2365
01:42:03,250 --> 01:42:05,650
Is there a uh,
there's a plug back there somewhere,

2366
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,070
but behind you.
That's it right there.

2367
01:42:09,110 --> 01:42:09,370
Oh,
okay.

2368
01:42:09,540 --> 01:42:10,750
Take this thing out.
Oh,

2369
01:42:10,751 --> 01:42:15,751
whoa.
Look at this fucking thing spaceship 

2370
01:42:15,751 --> 01:42:15,751
looking thing.
yeah.

2371
01:42:15,751 --> 01:42:16,660
okay.
So this,

2372
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:20,980
I really rotates around.
He can hit every angle.

2373
01:42:22,120 --> 01:42:24,460
Okay.
And that's the pump up a little.

2374
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,740
So you put it on.
Oh,

2375
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:28,180
I have seen this.
Okay.

2376
01:42:28,510 --> 01:42:33,510
I've seen this very video.
So he has this thing on and it's just a 

2377
01:42:33,510 --> 01:42:34,930
rubber band.
That's the resistance.

2378
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:36,520
Yeah,
exactly like that.

2379
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,120
Or you can use it with like a,
like,

2380
01:42:38,150 --> 01:42:38,630
uh,
wait,

2381
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:40,870
uh,
so he's moving his head,

2382
01:42:40,871 --> 01:42:43,120
in fact running around in a circle.
Yeah.

2383
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,010
So you can exercise at all different 
angles.

2384
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:50,160
What is the resistance though?
Is the resistance the spinning of his 

2385
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:50,160
head?
So is it pulling a.

2386
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:52,370
It's a combination of the two,
so looks like.

2387
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:58,110
So if you see it's pulling right there,
he'll be exercising the side of his 

2388
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:58,110
head.
If he faces it,

2389
01:42:58,110 --> 01:42:58,450
he'll be exercised in the back of his 
neck.

2390
01:42:58,480 --> 01:43:03,480
Excuse me,
on the back side of his neck that he 

2391
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:04,040
looks like he's got a steel cable,
like he's doing a lat pull.

2392
01:43:04,140 --> 01:43:05,770
Yeah,
he's probably got it hooked up to like a

2393
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:09,270
cable machine,
but I have a guy on training right now.

2394
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:14,440
We're actually,
he's actually going to Mexico next week 

2395
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:16,351
for a title fight,
but he put on two inches in the last 

2396
01:43:16,351 --> 01:43:19,230
month published because that good great.
One hundred,

2397
01:43:19,640 --> 01:43:22,420
eight pounds with a 16 inch neck.
She has christ.

2398
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:27,930
It's called the iron neck dynamic neck 
strengthening rotary cable attachment 

2399
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:31,930
gives pointers as he takes a college 
football player through the iron neck.

2400
01:43:31,931 --> 01:43:33,590
Basic workout.
Huh?

2401
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:37,660
So you have this guy,
he puts this exact thing on that you got

2402
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:42,661
right here.
And then what do you have them do with 

2403
01:43:42,661 --> 01:43:42,661
this similar stuff to what you just saw 
right there,

2404
01:43:42,661 --> 01:43:44,620
like rotational exercises other than the
neck.

2405
01:43:44,660 --> 01:43:49,660
Uh,
and it's all like circular movements,

2406
01:43:50,051 --> 01:43:52,010
all different movements.
And that

2407
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:56,630
doesn't fuck with the discs or anything 
because it's a very lightweight.

2408
01:43:56,720 --> 01:44:01,720
Well yeah,
if you're going to go on there and put 

2409
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:01,720
like 80,
90 pounds,

2410
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:05,590
100 pounds or something.
And what do you think about those 

2411
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:08,140
traditional ones that people use those 
leather things and I'm not a big fan of 

2412
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:11,150
them and I think because it's too,
it's too linear and again,

2413
01:44:11,151 --> 01:44:13,970
you don't really get the,
the stretch out of the muscle.

2414
01:44:14,150 --> 01:44:19,150
It's just like an isotonic contraction.
So that's just the same weight going up 

2415
01:44:19,150 --> 01:44:22,691
and down over and over right now,
would you recommend something like that 

2416
01:44:22,691 --> 01:44:22,691
to somebody who had a neck injury?
They're trying to,

2417
01:44:23,560 --> 01:44:25,640
you know what?
I think actually I believe they use them

2418
01:44:25,641 --> 01:44:28,050
at the disc institute or the spine,
the,

2419
01:44:28,360 --> 01:44:29,270
the place in la,
you know,

2420
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:34,300
marina del rey,
the spine or whatever disk or something 

2421
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,300
like that.

2422
01:44:34,300 --> 01:44:34,300
Yeah,
I think they have it there.

2423
01:44:34,430 --> 01:44:36,380
So they use that for rehabilitation?
I believe so,

2424
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:38,950
yeah.
Because there's a lot of um,

2425
01:44:39,530 --> 01:44:40,790
different.
Uh,

2426
01:44:40,820 --> 01:44:42,830
kelly started again.
I hate to bring him up again,

2427
01:44:42,831 --> 01:44:43,970
but he,
he,

2428
01:44:43,971 --> 01:44:48,971
uh,
he hates a lot of these machines that 

2429
01:44:48,971 --> 01:44:51,551
are out there.
I like those machines where you can say 

2430
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:51,551
neck flexion,
extension and all that stuff.

2431
01:44:51,551 --> 01:44:53,390
You hate those things too.
I don't hate,

2432
01:44:53,540 --> 01:44:56,470
but I just don't use them.
Yeah,

2433
01:44:56,550 --> 01:45:00,620
I think it's to the pattern of the 
movement is to linear,

2434
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:03,290
it's not efficient enough for like 
sports and stuff,

2435
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:08,340
right.
So it doesn't mimic how you would use 

2436
01:45:08,340 --> 01:45:10,631
the neck in real life.
Seemed like a squat or maybe a bench 

2437
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:10,631
press,
you know what I mean?

2438
01:45:10,631 --> 01:45:13,430
So I think if there would be a way to 
strengthen your neck up,

2439
01:45:14,030 --> 01:45:16,160
that would be really crucial for 
striking sports.

2440
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:19,340
Anything where your head's getting 
jolted back more than it should.

2441
01:45:19,790 --> 01:45:21,920
And then the endurance of the neck as 
like,

2442
01:45:21,921 --> 01:45:23,210
you know,
you're in a longer bout,

2443
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:24,260
you know,
it's,

2444
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,470
you can't resist anymore and pop your 
head flies back.

2445
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:31,520
Absolutely kind of doing their thing has
been shown to reduce concussion.

2446
01:45:31,550 --> 01:45:34,240
Like the damage from head injuries.
Sure.

2447
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,710
So that line,
we use that frequently.

2448
01:45:36,711 --> 01:45:38,630
You can do it also with like an exercise
ball,

2449
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:40,100
you can put it against the wall and 
roll,

2450
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:41,450
roll your head against it,
you know,

2451
01:45:41,790 --> 01:45:43,800
there's a lot of different ways you can 
use a towel.

2452
01:45:43,801 --> 01:45:48,801
And so,
I mean I've got a lot of different 

2453
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:48,801
modalities I use.
Um,

2454
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:48,801
but yeah,
we,

2455
01:45:48,801 --> 01:45:48,960
we,
we,

2456
01:45:49,060 --> 01:45:54,060
we really focus with roselawn like 
durability for this training to really 

2457
01:45:55,161 --> 01:45:58,970
building the abdominals and the obliques
and lower back and the neck.

2458
01:45:59,300 --> 01:46:04,300
And what do you,
what kind of exercises do for the 

2459
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:04,300
abdominals?

2460
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:04,300
Yeah,
I like the,

2461
01:46:04,640 --> 01:46:09,640
we call it the horse,
but the glute ham machine can do a lot 

2462
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:11,420
of abdominal exercises on there.
You can like the russian twist.

2463
01:46:11,421 --> 01:46:13,820
I like that exercise.
I like a lot of medicine ball,

2464
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:16,910
rotational medicine ball throws.
So the glute ham machine,

2465
01:46:16,911 --> 01:46:19,080
you're like leaning back.
So yeah,

2466
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:21,270
I back on the,
the big pattern.

2467
01:46:21,470 --> 01:46:22,370
Exactly.
That one.

2468
01:46:22,371 --> 01:46:23,630
Yeah.
Why do you,

2469
01:46:23,631 --> 01:46:25,210
why do you like that one particularly?
Uh,

2470
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:28,770
it's,
it's pretty versatile I think for,

2471
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:33,800
for how basic it is,
I think it's pretty versatile as far as 

2472
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:36,521
like the amount of exercises and the,
the how specific you get with each 

2473
01:46:36,521 --> 01:46:38,850
muscle group.
Like if I want to target your obliques,

2474
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:42,590
like I can hit that oblique so easily 
just by turning your hip a certain way,

2475
01:46:43,100 --> 01:46:48,100
you know what I mean?
And I can find all these little weak 

2476
01:46:48,100 --> 01:46:50,081
areas in the abdominals and the feet 
lock in on sort of a similar way to like

2477
01:46:50,341 --> 01:46:52,620
an old school like sit up bench.

2478
01:46:52,620 --> 01:46:53,430
Yeah,
exactly.

2479
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:56,850
And when you do house those old school 
set up benches of those,

2480
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,160
you know,
and I don't think so.

2481
01:46:59,161 --> 01:47:01,020
I think you can get some good work done 
on those.

2482
01:47:01,021 --> 01:47:01,890
Believe it or not,
like yeah,

2483
01:47:01,891 --> 01:47:04,390
I'm not,
but they're not as good as the uh,

2484
01:47:04,810 --> 01:47:06,960
no,
my preferences is the glue.

2485
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:08,850
I like that better.
That's the glute ham.

2486
01:47:08,910 --> 01:47:09,540
Yeah,
exactly.

2487
01:47:09,541 --> 01:47:10,740
Yeah.
And that's,

2488
01:47:10,770 --> 01:47:13,450
that's a guy facing forward.
You haven't faced backwards as well.

2489
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:14,520
Go both ways.
Yeah.

2490
01:47:14,521 --> 01:47:16,760
Lower back.
You want to get back in there and,

2491
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
and um,
and that machine seems like it would 

2492
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:22,000
give you some spinal decompression as 
well.

2493
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,120
It's phenomenal for,
for the lower back.

2494
01:47:24,121 --> 01:47:29,121
And,
and is that guy holding a weight in his 

2495
01:47:29,121 --> 01:47:30,060
chest when he's doing that?
If you look up that those two guys doing

2496
01:47:30,061 --> 01:47:32,490
on the right,
they're banging what to do it.

2497
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,640
If you're in a bad guy.

2498
01:47:34,110 --> 01:47:35,340
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

2499
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:38,450
That's the same guy.
Two different phases.

2500
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:39,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2501
01:47:39,960 --> 01:47:42,750
I know.
It's kind of banging his buddy.

2502
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,640
That's how you do it.
It was pretty interesting.

2503
01:47:44,641 --> 01:47:49,641
You know how that was a,
you know how the machine was invented 

2504
01:47:49,641 --> 01:47:52,180
was the russians took a pommel horse and
they moved it up to the law.

2505
01:47:52,181 --> 01:47:56,430
They took a two by four on the wall and 
they just put their feet on the wall and

2506
01:47:56,930 --> 01:47:59,010
back extensions over it.
No shit.

2507
01:47:59,070 --> 01:47:59,760
Yeah.
Pretty cool.

2508
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:01,140
Huh?
That is pretty cool.

2509
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:03,200
Have you seen the reverse hyper?
Uh,

2510
01:48:03,210 --> 01:48:03,690
yeah,
I have.

2511
01:48:03,720 --> 01:48:04,880
What do you think about that?
Uh,

2512
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,930
I think it's good.
I think there's one of those back there.

2513
01:48:07,490 --> 01:48:08,490
I love that thing.
Yeah.

2514
01:48:08,491 --> 01:48:09,750
I think there's some.
Is that better?

2515
01:48:09,990 --> 01:48:14,990
Do you think through the glute ham?
I think the way you do the exercise is 

2516
01:48:14,990 --> 01:48:15,480
the most important.

2517
01:48:16,410 --> 01:48:19,020
That's the key to what's cool about the 
reverse.

2518
01:48:19,021 --> 01:48:21,370
Hyper is on the descending.
It's,

2519
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:24,600
it's got like an active decompression.
It's like releasing.

2520
01:48:24,690 --> 01:48:25,260
Oh,
is that right?

2521
01:48:25,261 --> 01:48:26,250
Yeah.
Well you feel.

2522
01:48:26,251 --> 01:48:26,660
Yeah.
Yeah.

2523
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:31,670
Like fully on your lower back slightly 
and then you lifting up and 

2524
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:31,670
strengthening all that.
Yeah.

2525
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:36,480
So now this like for sports performance,
the speed of which you do that would be 

2526
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:40,551
a crucial factor.
You want to feel the stretch out of the 

2527
01:48:40,551 --> 01:48:43,401
tendons and ligaments before it fires 
back up and the weight that you would 

2528
01:48:43,401 --> 01:48:44,020
put on it.
How much weight put on.

2529
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:48,230
Maybe maybe start off with two and a 
half pound ankle weights first.

2530
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:48,980
Real.
Yeah.

2531
01:48:49,110 --> 01:48:49,970
See it,
you know,

2532
01:48:50,170 --> 01:48:53,740
and just build it up.
So you would explode up lower down.

2533
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:59,290
I don't load guys up with weight unless 
the quality and the speed of the 

2534
01:48:59,290 --> 01:49:02,700
movement and the speed will not be 
compromised.

2535
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:05,120
So if that's compromised and there's no 
sense in moving it up,

2536
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:08,250
for me it's all about getting the guy 
faster.

2537
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,070
I'm producing more forced.
So.

2538
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:16,280
So do you,
when you have a guy like dos anjos and 

2539
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:16,280
you obviously got them in incredible 
shape,

2540
01:49:16,500 --> 01:49:20,730
do you incorporate any traditional 
exercises that people are familiar with?

2541
01:49:20,731 --> 01:49:25,230
Like say hill sprints or sand bags or 
anything and he'll like,

2542
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,200
he'll sprinting is kind of like old 
school,

2543
01:49:28,201 --> 01:49:30,210
you know,
like I used to do that shit like crazy,

2544
01:49:30,211 --> 01:49:32,640
but fuck man,
I pushed myself to the limit.

2545
01:49:32,641 --> 01:49:35,070
Like,
oh my heart rate's like 190.

2546
01:49:35,071 --> 01:49:36,750
Wow.
I'm really pushing it out.

2547
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:40,050
$100.
But it slows you down.

2548
01:49:40,051 --> 01:49:43,440
You just sprinting should be for done,
for speed again.

2549
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,720
So running up a hill.
Why would you try to go fast?

2550
01:49:45,740 --> 01:49:47,250
You're,
you're running against resistance,

2551
01:49:47,260 --> 01:49:52,260
you're making yourself slow.
It's actually been shown that it's 

2552
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:52,260
proven.

2553
01:49:52,260 --> 01:49:52,840
You can look this up on the strength and
conditioning manuals,

2554
01:49:52,841 --> 01:49:55,280
whatever.
That a downhIll ski,

2555
01:49:55,310 --> 01:50:00,310
downhill sprinting has been shown to 
increase the top speed and sprinters 

2556
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:03,661
performance downhill because 
decelerating that because because it's 

2557
01:50:03,661 --> 01:50:05,590
forcing your body to adapt to a higher 
speed.

2558
01:50:06,790 --> 01:50:09,100
You know what I mean?
So instead you're going up hills,

2559
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:11,470
you're forcing your body to adapt to a 
slower speed,

2560
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:16,000
but you feel like you're going to 
fucking face plant at any moment.

2561
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:21,020
Right.
I think the biggest misconception with 

2562
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:24,511
all the resistance type training is that
somehow you're going to put the weight 

2563
01:50:24,511 --> 01:50:25,860
down and you're going to move faster,
right?

2564
01:50:26,260 --> 01:50:27,860
People believe that,
but why?

2565
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:32,820
Because you can lift the heavier weight 
and so your muscles are stronger.

2566
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,560
It makes you faster at exactly that.
it doesn't work that one out.

2567
01:50:35,650 --> 01:50:40,650
it doesn't work that way.
some sort of a study on power lifters 

2568
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:41,730
that they found out the power lifters 
that increase their,

2569
01:50:41,740 --> 01:50:46,740
their ability to do vertical leaps and 
all sorts of other different explosive 

2570
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:47,710
exercises just because of power lifting.

2571
01:50:47,740 --> 01:50:50,650
there might be some truth to that and 
olympic lifting as well.

2572
01:50:50,651 --> 01:50:55,651
They found their good sprinters,
but you would say that that 

2573
01:50:55,651 --> 01:50:55,651
strengthening of the feet,
uh,

2574
01:50:55,651 --> 01:50:59,900
I'd say that has a lot to do with it,
but also the strength of the quadriceps 

2575
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:00,460
and relation to the,
you know,

2576
01:51:00,461 --> 01:51:02,380
the lag in relation to the rest of the 
body.

2577
01:51:02,381 --> 01:51:07,381
But how do they Move laterally?
How do they move rotationally that's 

2578
01:51:07,381 --> 01:51:08,300
where they're deficient.
Well,

2579
01:51:08,310 --> 01:51:13,310
when you see a really big bulky guy in 
the ufc becomes super obvious when they 

2580
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:15,040
fight,
a guy who can move moves real good.

2581
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:17,890
They're almost like stuck in mud.
Exactly.

2582
01:51:17,980 --> 01:51:20,000
You know,
when you seat,

2583
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:23,050
but for some guys like their style,
but like who's smart?

2584
01:51:23,051 --> 01:51:24,350
Paul harris,
you know,

2585
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:29,580
he's a guy where that big beefy fucking 
build he always tried to do is grab a 

2586
01:51:29,591 --> 01:51:30,730
hold of your leg and rip it apart.

2587
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:36,000
So it's like,
it's almost for him it seems to benefit 

2588
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,290
him to be like really over muscular and 
super strong because he's,

2589
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:43,680
he's about that very small movement or 
they're very small group of movements 

2590
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:48,301
rather.
It's pretty interesting because I'm 

2591
01:51:48,301 --> 01:51:48,301
actually training another guy from the 
ufc.

2592
01:51:48,301 --> 01:51:48,460
I just started working with him aBout a 
month ago.

2593
01:51:48,461 --> 01:51:53,461
Ricardo dementia.
A braille cyborg.

2594
01:51:54,090 --> 01:51:55,780
No,
ricardo,

2595
01:51:56,250 --> 01:52:01,250
ricardo brain.
He's this guy is another really good 

2596
01:52:01,250 --> 01:52:02,520
jujitsu guy from Brazil,
but this guy is on the ufc a,

2597
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:05,290
I don't know how many fights he has now.
Maybe this will be the second or third.

2598
01:52:05,291 --> 01:52:10,291
I think he's Pretty new.
I think of a cyborg or fighting on the 

2599
01:52:10,291 --> 01:52:10,890
june.
Sixth garde.

2600
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:12,470
I think there's one,
right?

2601
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:14,680
Uh,
probably the fight night.

2602
01:52:14,690 --> 01:52:15,280
Yeah.
Yeah.

2603
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,290
He's fighting on that one.
Oh,

2604
01:52:17,291 --> 01:52:18,160
there he is.
Yeah.

2605
01:52:18,161 --> 01:52:22,650
That's him.
How many fights in the ufc a?

2606
01:52:23,500 --> 01:52:25,960
Just want one fight night.

2607
01:52:25,960 --> 01:52:29,530
rear naked choke.
He fight what nurse?

2608
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:31,540
Okay.
He's another guy.

2609
01:52:31,541 --> 01:52:34,410
I mean you look at this guy and he's 
just like freakishly bill.

2610
01:52:34,770 --> 01:52:38,140
He was in the Brazil card,
the meo chick versus maldonado car.

2611
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:43,560
Really good jujitsu to the hydro gracie 
and all those guys and it's like really?

2612
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,790
But he is classic case of a guy who's 
lifting.

2613
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:51,970
I mean he's huge but just ripped a.
he's lifting all these heavyweights 

2614
01:52:51,970 --> 01:52:52,850
slowly.
Hey,

2615
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:55,430
I got them out to their first day 
sprinting.

2616
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:58,420
I couldn't believe how slow forgot was 
slower.

2617
01:52:58,430 --> 01:53:00,320
Molasses.
Blew my freaking mind.

2618
01:53:00,321 --> 01:53:03,740
Here's this gigantic muscle bound guy 
and the guy couldn't.

2619
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,900
It looked like he was jogging.
really?

2620
01:53:05,901 --> 01:53:10,901
Yeah.
I take it slow because you thought 

2621
01:53:10,901 --> 01:53:12,851
you're going to torture him.
Now did go slow to get that time and 

2622
01:53:12,851 --> 01:53:14,420
then I have them do like a,
like a throw off,

2623
01:53:14,421 --> 01:53:17,420
like what I showed you with the 
plyometric bench press type movement,

2624
01:53:17,460 --> 01:53:20,230
like maybe like 45 pounds,
right?

2625
01:53:21,140 --> 01:53:24,020
Guy can barely throw it off six inches.
Really?

2626
01:53:24,050 --> 01:53:29,050
Yeah.
Because his muscles are trained to be 

2627
01:53:29,050 --> 01:53:30,851
short and slow here.
So the body remembers the movement 

2628
01:53:30,851 --> 01:53:31,820
pattern and the speed,
not just,

2629
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:37,600
you know what I'm saying?
So you're training slow twitch and now 

2630
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,590
already a month later,
like getting huge gains.

2631
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:43,700
Getting explosive.
Like friday was a breakthrough day,

2632
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:45,530
you know,
a month later.

2633
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:47,300
Yeah.
That's interesting.

2634
01:53:47,560 --> 01:53:48,620
Yeah.
That's interesting.

2635
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:51,350
So you would take a guy like that.
He's a good example.

2636
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:54,530
Fic fairy,
obviously fricking huge.

2637
01:53:54,531 --> 01:53:55,000
Right?
Right.

2638
01:53:55,010 --> 01:53:57,010
Yeah.
So what do you do with a girl like that?

2639
01:53:57,020 --> 01:54:00,590
Like what's the first thing you do?
First thing I do is get a moving dynamic

2640
01:54:00,591 --> 01:54:05,591
movements,
getting him to move a little quicker on 

2641
01:54:05,591 --> 01:54:06,350
his feet,
learning how more coordination exercises

2642
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:11,740
but keeping him loose and dynamic rather
than anything that's tense and going to 

2643
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:15,761
tighten them up.
So like even the shadow boxing a month 

2644
01:54:15,761 --> 01:54:15,870
ago,
it was just like,

2645
01:54:15,871 --> 01:54:17,360
like it looks like slow motion now.

2646
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:18,830
It looks,
it looks pretty good.

2647
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:22,580
Like that's amazing.
You can do such so much progress or make

2648
01:54:22,581 --> 01:54:24,950
so much progress happen in such a short 
period of time.

2649
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:25,790
Yeah,
it is.

2650
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:27,500
And uh,
yeah,

2651
01:54:27,501 --> 01:54:28,160
it's really,
it's,

2652
01:54:28,161 --> 01:54:30,680
I'm not gonna say it was easy because 
this is one of the harder cases.

2653
01:54:30,681 --> 01:54:33,350
Usually it takes about two weeks before 
I start seeing a difference.

2654
01:54:33,830 --> 01:54:35,090
But uh,
but no,

2655
01:54:35,091 --> 01:54:37,790
once you get that breakthrough and you 
start seeing them moving differently and

2656
01:54:37,791 --> 01:54:38,420
quicker,
man,

2657
01:54:38,421 --> 01:54:40,370
it's,
it's on from there it's like okay,

2658
01:54:40,371 --> 01:54:45,371
now we can start really progressing and 
hitting the nervous system with really 

2659
01:54:45,371 --> 01:54:46,940
like intense plyometrics and stuff like 
that.

2660
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:50,390
How cutting edge is this style of 
training?

2661
01:54:50,391 --> 01:54:54,020
I mean marinovich did he invent all 
tests or marv?

2662
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:57,980
Marv did was,
he took a scientific studies from,

2663
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:03,010
from what the russians had developed 
back during the cold war period and he 

2664
01:55:03,010 --> 01:55:05,330
translated into his,
his exercises.

2665
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:10,750
And so I'd say at least 80 percent of 
what I'm doing is stuff that he's come 

2666
01:55:10,750 --> 01:55:12,630
up with 80 percent.
Yeah,

2667
01:55:12,650 --> 01:55:13,490
maybe 75,
80.

2668
01:55:13,491 --> 01:55:14,600
Yeah.
But something like that.

2669
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:17,420
And how did you do?
Did you do like an internship with him?

2670
01:55:17,421 --> 01:55:20,900
Like how to do that and even if it's not
what he's doing,

2671
01:55:20,930 --> 01:55:22,810
it's something along the lines,
you know,

2672
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:25,670
it's something similar.
It's very heavily influenced by what the

2673
01:55:25,671 --> 01:55:28,430
russians came up with and their studies 
of the nervous system.

2674
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:31,810
And uh,
so mark took these things and translated

2675
01:55:31,820 --> 01:55:34,310
in exercises and it's just been 
phenomenal.

2676
01:55:34,311 --> 01:55:34,880
Like,
you know,

2677
01:55:34,881 --> 01:55:37,550
it's just,
it's really,

2678
01:55:37,551 --> 01:55:38,750
uh,
he got to try it,

2679
01:55:38,751 --> 01:55:39,420
man.
I,

2680
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:42,020
I believe you can work out with me for 
two weeks.

2681
01:55:42,021 --> 01:55:44,070
I changed your life,
but you're way the fuck down

2682
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:45,690
there.
Where are you?

2683
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:48,240
I'm in woodland hills.
Oh look,

2684
01:55:48,241 --> 01:55:50,790
you're here right now.
Burbank.

2685
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:51,180
We're all.
Well,

2686
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:52,570
let's do this.
Okay.

2687
01:55:52,650 --> 01:55:54,060
Do it.
I would love to.

2688
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,310
I would love to.
Your life.

2689
01:55:55,410 --> 01:55:58,360
You're a guy with an open mind.
He'd be blown away at the differences.

2690
01:55:58,380 --> 01:56:03,380
Well,
I would love to just from the point of 

2691
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:03,380
view,
first of all for a person always,

2692
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:04,540
I'm always trying to work on,
you know,

2693
01:56:04,650 --> 01:56:08,520
different things and improve different 
things about my performance physically,

2694
01:56:08,521 --> 01:56:12,210
but I also as a commentator,
I think it would help.

2695
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:16,010
I figured that's one thing I really 
liked joe,

2696
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:21,020
is how you've educated the fat and this 
is something I think maybe boxing needs 

2697
01:56:21,020 --> 01:56:24,090
a little bit more of is like educating 
the fans on the different techniques and

2698
01:56:24,091 --> 01:56:26,720
strategies of the fighters.
You remember that one fight?

2699
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:29,430
I think it waS who was anderson silva 
and the crowd was bullying.

2700
01:56:29,460 --> 01:56:31,470
I think it was anderson facility one and
crowds bullying.

2701
01:56:31,471 --> 01:56:32,380
You're like,
why are you building?

2702
01:56:32,540 --> 01:56:36,240
That was like a great performance,
like fucking strategic performance.

2703
01:56:36,540 --> 01:56:38,760
Well I loved floyd mayweather versus 
pack.

2704
01:56:38,761 --> 01:56:39,570
Yeah.
He didn't know.

2705
01:56:39,571 --> 01:56:42,930
Yeah,
I mean I love skill.

2706
01:56:43,050 --> 01:56:44,880
Yeah.
I mean very important to me.

2707
01:56:44,970 --> 01:56:46,500
I didn't love it.
I respect it.

2708
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:49,470
Like I respect me whether skill.
Like he's a phenomenal boxer.

2709
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:52,110
I just would've liked to see it for 200 
million bucks.

2710
01:56:52,120 --> 01:56:57,120
Like go for the kill.
Did you know that guy's tired on the 

2711
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:57,570
twelfth round?
Put a little something out there for the

2712
01:56:57,571 --> 01:56:58,510
fans.
I,

2713
01:56:58,620 --> 01:57:03,620
I loved it,
but I didn't love it as much as I love 

2714
01:57:03,620 --> 01:57:03,620
canelo alvarez.
James kirkland.

2715
01:57:03,770 --> 01:57:06,590
that was more or matisa and provide the 
cost.

2716
01:57:06,780 --> 01:57:09,990
That was more my mean,
that was definitely more crazy and watch

2717
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,840
one of my favorite fights of all time in
the ufc.

2718
01:57:12,840 --> 01:57:14,580
I mean there's been a few favorite 
fights,

2719
01:57:14,581 --> 01:57:18,240
but dan henderson versus shogun,
which was just phenomenal.

2720
01:57:18,241 --> 01:57:19,880
I just watched that the other day,
man.

2721
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:24,980
Oh my god.
I couldn't be brain damaged just 

2722
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:27,231
watching it.
The other one I watched the other day 

2723
01:57:27,231 --> 01:57:29,091
was the don frye bush versus a takiyama 
that exchange,

2724
01:57:31,510 --> 01:57:36,510
two of them were in the corner and we're
just color tie haymaker haymaker out of 

2725
01:57:37,970 --> 01:57:38,970
his eyeball.
Man.

2726
01:57:38,971 --> 01:57:40,500
that was insanity.
I love that.

2727
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:45,560
That was crazy.
Some of those pride fights were fucking 

2728
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:45,560
absolutely nuts.
But um,

2729
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:50,490
I'm a fan of skill.
Like that's why I said mighty mouse is 

2730
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:53,481
like one of my favorite guys to watch.
But vanderbilt is probably my all time 

2731
01:57:53,481 --> 01:57:54,060
favorite,
although vendor skillful.

2732
01:57:54,270 --> 01:57:59,270
What I loved about vandelay,
which juSt you knew you're going to see 

2733
01:57:59,270 --> 01:58:00,330
some fucking chaos and that guy got in 
and started rolling his knuckles.

2734
01:58:00,630 --> 01:58:05,630
You're going to see some shit.
I'm so happy that he got that lifetime 

2735
01:58:05,630 --> 01:58:07,880
ban rescinded and I don't know whether 
or not he was on.

2736
01:58:07,890 --> 01:58:12,890
I don't know what the fuck he was on,
but I do know that the vast majority of 

2737
01:58:12,901 --> 01:58:17,901
those guys are doing something to help 
them recover in and when you take a guy 

2738
01:58:17,901 --> 01:58:19,980
and you take away his livelihood 
forever,

2739
01:58:20,010 --> 01:58:23,340
you see you can never fight again.
That to me is just disgusting.

2740
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:26,490
It's disgusting.
You can't do that to come lead to right.

2741
01:58:26,720 --> 01:58:28,450
Or then they send it back or something.
No,

2742
01:58:29,180 --> 01:58:33,570
they were going to give him a one year,
so suspended a one year suspension.

2743
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:36,780
They were going to give him nine months 
and they tried to shift it to one year.

2744
01:58:36,781 --> 01:58:40,590
He had agreed to nine months and then 
when they try to shift it to one year,

2745
01:58:40,591 --> 01:58:42,040
that's when he started hearing

2746
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,540
all these people on the internet that 
were saying that the tests that they did

2747
01:58:46,570 --> 01:58:51,570
were not proper,
couldn't handle either ms dot handled or

2748
01:58:51,581 --> 01:58:54,130
what it wasn't.
The protocol wasn't estaBlished.

2749
01:58:54,131 --> 01:58:58,300
So what the ufc did is they kind of 
overstepped their ability,

2750
01:58:58,630 --> 01:59:00,880
you know,
like if you're going to have someone get

2751
01:59:00,910 --> 01:59:05,910
tested,
you really have to have some water type 

2752
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:09,090
organization come in and handle it.
People that have been doing that 

2753
01:59:09,090 --> 01:59:12,391
forever,
the people that handle the testing did 

2754
01:59:12,391 --> 01:59:13,480
not do the best job so that the results 
were in question.

2755
01:59:13,481 --> 01:59:18,481
They would not have probably held up in 
court and the ufc had a stand down and 

2756
01:59:18,481 --> 01:59:22,381
so now calmly is involved in some crazy 
lawsuit with the ufc and he's a part of 

2757
01:59:22,381 --> 01:59:26,611
the whole class action lawsuit thing.
But I think he was also kind of on his 

2758
01:59:26,611 --> 01:59:26,611
way out.
You know what I mean?

2759
01:59:26,611 --> 01:59:29,410
I think it's a bit of a money grabbing 
certain ways.

2760
01:59:30,100 --> 01:59:31,050
But I think,
um,

2761
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:33,880
the,
the bisping fight was,

2762
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:36,670
it was an interesting fight because con 
looked great.

2763
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:38,230
It was ripped,
chiseled,

2764
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:41,260
and that's why people are like,
what the fuck is going on with that guy?

2765
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,930
What is he up to?
He gets these tests,

2766
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:49,270
the results in question,
but the tests apparently showed very 

2767
01:59:49,270 --> 01:59:51,370
high growth hormone rates,
like unusually high.

2768
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,620
But yeah,
when the tests are in question,

2769
01:59:54,250 --> 01:59:56,440
I'm obviously not a doctor or a 
scientist.

2770
01:59:56,441 --> 01:59:57,820
I don't know what the fuck really 
happened.

2771
01:59:58,330 --> 02:00:02,920
Guy looked awesome at 40 something for 
the first time I ever talked to jack.

2772
02:00:03,140 --> 02:00:08,140
Pretty good transformation.
Kind of like a one one mark as when he 

2773
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:08,140
fought.
Pack out that.

2774
02:00:08,140 --> 02:00:09,500
Yes.
Yeah.

2775
02:00:09,501 --> 02:00:13,070
That was an interesting one too.
Same gym or something was packet.

2776
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,070
I was guy packing.
I was old guy.

2777
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:15,570
Alex.

2778
02:00:17,460 --> 02:00:20,070
There's a lot of that going on.
You know what,

2779
02:00:20,090 --> 02:00:25,090
when you hear okay,
we kind of talked about this slightly 

2780
02:00:25,090 --> 02:00:27,471
but you didn't touch on it.
There was a bunch of like Bobby Green 

2781
02:00:27,471 --> 02:00:31,640
was accusing hockfield hassan joe's 
fighters high level fighter in the ufc 

2782
02:00:31,741 --> 02:00:33,180
lightweight division.
What's he ranked?

2783
02:00:33,181 --> 02:00:34,740
You know,
he's highly ranked.

2784
02:00:34,770 --> 02:00:35,510
Is he?
Yeah,

2785
02:00:35,540 --> 02:00:37,980
he's,
if he's not 10 or top 15,

2786
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:40,080
I don't know what rank is,
I'll find out,

2787
02:00:40,770 --> 02:00:43,280
but he's a very good fighter,
but he,

2788
02:00:43,420 --> 02:00:46,080
his,
I think he's exact quotes were pedes got

2789
02:00:46,110 --> 02:00:49,170
played by a ped cheat.
That's what he said.

2790
02:00:49,860 --> 02:00:52,290
That's interesting.
But it's just speculation right?

2791
02:00:52,300 --> 02:00:52,580
Immediately.

2792
02:00:52,800 --> 02:00:53,970
Yeah.
The referral trained with,

2793
02:00:54,230 --> 02:00:59,230
I don't know,
one I think and I think they train 

2794
02:00:59,230 --> 02:01:01,411
together,
didn't he told me about a guy running 

2795
02:01:01,411 --> 02:01:02,160
his mouth and then he came up to raphael
was all humble.

2796
02:01:02,161 --> 02:01:04,130
I wanted to train with them and then 
they started training.

2797
02:01:04,160 --> 02:01:06,780
the guy was complaining,
don't kick me here.

2798
02:01:06,781 --> 02:01:08,490
Don't keep me there.
Oh reAlly?

2799
02:01:08,550 --> 02:01:08,940
Yeah.
It's,

2800
02:01:08,941 --> 02:01:10,680
I think it's the same guy.
Hmm.

2801
02:01:10,950 --> 02:01:12,900
But uh,
what do I think about that?

2802
02:01:13,220 --> 02:01:14,610
You know,
I think the guy,

2803
02:01:14,611 --> 02:01:17,550
if he's not top three and he's saying 
that he's probably just trying to make a

2804
02:01:17,551 --> 02:01:21,960
name for himself and um,
it's pretty disrespectful to rafael,

2805
02:01:22,410 --> 02:01:24,780
but it's kind of complimentary to me.
LIke,

2806
02:01:24,781 --> 02:01:25,540
okay,
cool.

2807
02:01:25,541 --> 02:01:27,360
It's like stuck anything.
It's that good.

2808
02:01:27,361 --> 02:01:27,960
All right.
Come on,

2809
02:01:27,961 --> 02:01:32,961
sign up.
See what the body does not look that 

2810
02:01:32,961 --> 02:01:32,961
much different.
It doesn't look.

2811
02:01:32,961 --> 02:01:32,961
If you're a,
you know,

2812
02:01:32,961 --> 02:01:37,510
if you're juicing,
you're going to have traps up to your 

2813
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:37,510
ears.

2814
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:37,510
You're going to look like a freak people
out.

2815
02:01:37,510 --> 02:01:38,990
I always look at lance armstrong,
lance armstrong,

2816
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:44,100
but he's taken epl.
You just take an epo and testosterone 

2817
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:44,100
and a bunch of other things as well.
Yeah,

2818
02:01:44,100 --> 02:01:48,440
I called cocktail wrote to be honest,
I'm not that educated on this stuff,

2819
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:51,170
but I'll tell you this,
if I've got him at 12,000,

2820
02:01:51,171 --> 02:01:54,990
500 feet altitude doing sprints,
I'm not going to have.

2821
02:01:55,010 --> 02:02:00,010
I'm going to make damn sure he's clean.
Cause if you're taking any kind of 

2822
02:02:00,010 --> 02:02:00,110
stuff,
I don't know what the hell that could do

2823
02:02:00,111 --> 02:02:02,720
to your body and your blood up or 
something like that and you want to keep

2824
02:02:02,721 --> 02:02:03,260
you.
Yeah,

2825
02:02:03,261 --> 02:02:04,880
absolutely.
Could you imagine that?

2826
02:02:04,881 --> 02:02:07,010
And then and then you're taking 12,000
feet,

2827
02:02:07,011 --> 02:02:09,170
that's like ridiculous.
Bobby green or whoever you are,

2828
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:14,740
come and go through a workout and See 
what he does and then you'll see why 

2829
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:14,740
he's the best.

2830
02:02:14,740 --> 02:02:17,390
Do you think that this sport has an 
issue?

2831
02:02:17,391 --> 02:02:22,391
I mean,
it seems to at least a perception that 

2832
02:02:22,391 --> 02:02:23,540
there's an issue with ped.
Do I think it does.

2833
02:02:23,630 --> 02:02:25,700
I'm sure there is.
I'm sure there's an issue.

2834
02:02:25,730 --> 02:02:30,730
Why do you think that exists?
Do you think would exist because of 

2835
02:02:30,730 --> 02:02:31,340
improper training or because guys want 
to get an edge.

2836
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,800
I think that man,
joe,

2837
02:02:33,870 --> 02:02:38,870
if you and I are trying to reach for 
that cup of coffee and you take 

2838
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:39,530
something and I and I know you took it 
and I want the coffee,

2839
02:02:39,531 --> 02:02:41,900
I'm going to take it to if I need,
it's going to give me a benefit.

2840
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:47,110
Right.
It's totally understandable if if one 

2841
02:02:47,110 --> 02:02:49,841
guy,
if you don't have proper training and 

2842
02:02:49,841 --> 02:02:50,120
you feel slow and you need to take some 
shit to to feel stronger,

2843
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:52,700
you're going to do it because you know 
the other guys doing it.

2844
02:02:53,060 --> 02:02:54,780
You know what I mEan?
Like what did you.

2845
02:02:54,830 --> 02:02:59,830
What did you think about the whole 
testosterone replacement therapy 

2846
02:02:59,830 --> 02:02:59,990
debacle?
Which I think is a real debacle.

2847
02:03:00,020 --> 02:03:02,630
I think the way they handled it was just
ridiculous.

2848
02:03:02,631 --> 02:03:05,210
They gave it to people.
They allowed it for a few years.

2849
02:03:05,540 --> 02:03:09,420
You had these staggering perform like 
[inaudible] is the poster boy for,

2850
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:14,560
for testosterone replacement.
You know what I think if it's a medical 

2851
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,890
thing and like you've been to a doctor 
and they say,

2852
02:03:15,891 --> 02:03:16,520
hey,
did this,

2853
02:03:16,521 --> 02:03:21,521
is it?
I think if it's regulated to the point 

2854
02:03:21,521 --> 02:03:22,910
where it doesn't put you above an 
average level of testosterone,

2855
02:03:23,630 --> 02:03:26,210
then I don't see what,
how it should be a problem to you.

2856
02:03:26,240 --> 02:03:28,610
I mean what benefits you?
It gives you more quicker.

2857
02:03:28,611 --> 02:03:30,710
Recovery allows you to train harder.
Right?

2858
02:03:30,711 --> 02:03:33,560
But I'm saying as long as it's not above
an average level,

2859
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:38,590
so if you're deficient,
let's say your total testosterone was 

2860
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:41,270
100 and the doctors are moderate,
like they're monitoring it thoroughly 

2861
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:43,820
and you show up every week and they're 
doing a test and they can show like,

2862
02:03:43,821 --> 02:03:45,480
hey,
this is his thing and it's 300.

2863
02:03:45,540 --> 02:03:48,530
That's it.
Then I don't know if that would be.

2864
02:03:48,531 --> 02:03:53,531
I'm not condoning drugs,
but I'm just saying maybe that would be 

2865
02:03:53,531 --> 02:03:54,020
an acceptable way to let it in.
I agree with you.

2866
02:03:54,080 --> 02:03:57,370
In a perfect world,
I think there's too many variables.

2867
02:03:57,500 --> 02:03:59,780
If your testosterone is low,
you probably shouldn't be a fighter.

2868
02:03:59,930 --> 02:04:04,930
Yes.
And also probably it's inter indicative 

2869
02:04:04,930 --> 02:04:07,970
of one or two things,
pituitary gland damage or,

2870
02:04:08,150 --> 02:04:12,990
or gonad damage or you took steroids and
now you're not producing.

2871
02:04:12,991 --> 02:04:14,270
Yeah.
And your body shut down.

2872
02:04:14,271 --> 02:04:14,600
And that's,
uh,

2873
02:04:14,700 --> 02:04:16,340
that's,
that's what a lot of guys were doing.

2874
02:04:16,610 --> 02:04:18,560
They were taking it.
And then when you,

2875
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:21,410
when you add in exogenous,
as I say it,

2876
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:24,860
I guess I'm testosterone.
Your body goes,

2877
02:04:24,861 --> 02:04:26,480
all right,
we've got plenty of this and it stops.

2878
02:04:26,481 --> 02:04:31,481
It's natural production.
And so then you would do that and then 

2879
02:04:31,481 --> 02:04:32,210
go get tested.
And then the doctor would say,

2880
02:04:32,211 --> 02:04:34,100
oh,
your natural production is way down.

2881
02:04:34,130 --> 02:04:36,430
Way down Testosterone.
Yeah.

2882
02:04:37,420 --> 02:04:41,460
And that's what a lot of guys were 
getting away with it.

2883
02:04:41,530 --> 02:04:46,020
You don't need it with a great diet.
Like raphael liked the guy saying that I

2884
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:51,021
don't know who he is,
but you have to understand there's a 

2885
02:04:51,021 --> 02:04:53,940
reason he's the champion and it starts 
with his mind and his discipline and his

2886
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:56,550
dedication to the fighting.
He came here with nothing.

2887
02:04:56,551 --> 02:04:58,550
Did like,
uh,

2888
02:04:58,710 --> 02:05:02,430
his diet is impeccable.
His training is impeccable.

2889
02:05:02,460 --> 02:05:04,370
I mean,
he drives two hours to train with media.

2890
02:05:04,410 --> 02:05:07,830
That's dedication,
like do all the pds and what you want.

2891
02:05:07,831 --> 02:05:11,280
If you're not willing to make those 
sacrifices to beat him,

2892
02:05:11,281 --> 02:05:13,470
like the same sacrifice that he makes,
you're not going to beat him.

2893
02:05:13,950 --> 02:05:18,950
so when he goes down and train with you,
how many days a week does he do this 

2894
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:18,950
for?
Three to four days.

2895
02:05:18,950 --> 02:05:19,670
Three to four days,
depending upon how he's.

2896
02:05:19,820 --> 02:05:21,000
Sometimes I'll go down there.
Yeah,

2897
02:05:21,001 --> 02:05:22,290
exactly.
Or how he feels,

2898
02:05:22,291 --> 02:05:23,640
you know,
sparring so really hard.

2899
02:05:23,641 --> 02:05:25,270
Or he's got something in the next day,
you know,

2900
02:05:25,760 --> 02:05:27,780
that we'll take it off.
but yeah,

2901
02:05:27,781 --> 02:05:29,910
I really think it's kind of 
disrespectful to him.

2902
02:05:29,911 --> 02:05:32,160
Did he put in so much work?
How many?

2903
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:34,290
Five flights in the last year or 
something like that,

2904
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:39,291
but six training camps.
When you look at the guyS who's beaten 

2905
02:05:39,291 --> 02:05:41,160
to eating some table guys.
Exactly.

2906
02:05:41,210 --> 02:05:42,810
And towards the end we're not going to 
lie.

2907
02:05:42,811 --> 02:05:47,811
It started to take its toll.
I'm looking at a partial tear of the 

2908
02:05:47,811 --> 02:05:50,151
mcl.
He was getting worn down and now he 

2909
02:05:50,151 --> 02:05:52,581
really needed a break.
So the other thing is the guy walks 

2910
02:05:52,581 --> 02:05:54,240
around with like one 81 probably about 
[inaudible] 91 93.

2911
02:05:54,940 --> 02:05:56,520
Yeah.
You've seen him wiTh the weight cuts,

2912
02:05:56,521 --> 02:06:00,510
you see how holly macerated,
he is the guys fighting in an aca state.

2913
02:06:00,510 --> 02:06:05,510
He's probably fighting about one 72,
maybe [inaudible] 73 when he fight 

2914
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:09,471
night.
So imagine you take a guy who's one 

2915
02:06:09,471 --> 02:06:11,440
night and strip off 20 pounds.
Of course he's going to look ripped and 

2916
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:11,760
lean like we all look like that 
underneath,

2917
02:06:11,761 --> 02:06:15,030
you know.
So these accusations are kind of like,

2918
02:06:15,230 --> 02:06:20,230
they're very disrespectful I think.
But people think it because we have the 

2919
02:06:20,230 --> 02:06:22,110
stamina,
stamina for sure.

2920
02:06:22,140 --> 02:06:23,670
He's just,
he's just a monster.

2921
02:06:23,700 --> 02:06:24,250
You know,
when,

2922
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:27,330
whenever you see someone who excels at a
very high level,

2923
02:06:27,331 --> 02:06:28,220
people go,
hmm,

2924
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:29,670
how's he doing?
I do that too.

2925
02:06:29,671 --> 02:06:34,671
Like I questioned some guys too,
like there's some guys in the ufc I 

2926
02:06:34,671 --> 02:06:36,810
question and it's because their bodies 
have changed a lot over time,

2927
02:06:37,030 --> 02:06:38,980
you know what I mean at the time.
But uh,

2928
02:06:39,310 --> 02:06:41,040
there's some guys you look At it and go,
okay,

2929
02:06:41,041 --> 02:06:41,820
what,
like,

2930
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:43,800
what did hector lumbar tested positive?

2931
02:06:43,890 --> 02:06:44,960
Nobody went,
what?

2932
02:06:46,070 --> 02:06:48,450
No,
that doesn't even make sense.

2933
02:06:48,840 --> 02:06:50,880
Right?
Hector lumbered had muscles that weren't

2934
02:06:50,881 --> 02:06:53,460
even in books.
You go like medical books and they go,

2935
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:54,720
what the fuck is that?
What does that.

2936
02:06:54,721 --> 02:06:56,790
ThAt is not even a human muscle.
What?

2937
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:59,580
I don't even understand what drug he 
would need to take to.

2938
02:06:59,581 --> 02:07:04,581
How like raphael,
I don't even know what drug he would 

2939
02:07:04,581 --> 02:07:05,790
need to take to have great stamina.
That's easily trainable.

2940
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:11,000
The problem is all these guys are doing 
such improper training that they're 

2941
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,420
making me look even better.
You know what I mean?

2942
02:07:12,840 --> 02:07:15,900
So if you took a guy that had poor 
stamina,

2943
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:18,570
like okay,
let's take bj penn.

2944
02:07:19,230 --> 02:07:21,480
Bj was on pds when he fought diego 
santa.

2945
02:07:21,490 --> 02:07:22,770
No.
Why?

2946
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:24,660
Why watch this training and.
Well first of all,

2947
02:07:24,661 --> 02:07:25,680
beaches,
one of those guys.

2948
02:07:25,860 --> 02:07:27,600
That was only a few guys.
Yeah,

2949
02:07:27,601 --> 02:07:32,601
he wouldn't even take an fucking ivy for
the frankie edgar fight and wouldn't 

2950
02:07:32,601 --> 02:07:32,650
even rehydrate with an iv,
which I think is crazy.

2951
02:07:32,650 --> 02:07:37,650
Huh?
But beach is one of those guys where I 

2952
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:37,650
don't think he's done anything ever.
I don't either.

2953
02:07:37,650 --> 02:07:39,610
I don't think he would either.
Why do people think raphael house?

2954
02:07:39,611 --> 02:07:41,410
Because he's brazilian.
You know,

2955
02:07:41,650 --> 02:07:46,650
that's one reason.
Not like the most handsome dude in the 

2956
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:46,650
world.
Sorry,

2957
02:07:46,650 --> 02:07:46,650
raphael,
what are you trying to say?

2958
02:07:46,970 --> 02:07:47,860
No,
but you know what I mean.

2959
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:49,750
He's not going to be on the cover of a 
wheaties box.

2960
02:07:49,751 --> 02:07:50,230
Like,
yeah,

2961
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,890
he's from Brazil.
The dude comes here to fight.

2962
02:07:52,900 --> 02:07:54,610
I mean,
he's a fighter.

2963
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:56,230
That's how fighters look.
Sorry.

2964
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:57,170
You know?
Yeah.

2965
02:07:57,490 --> 02:08:00,540
Well,
I mean he'S obviously done it.

2966
02:08:00,660 --> 02:08:05,660
Even if he had done any sort of ped,
there's no fucking ped in a world that 

2967
02:08:05,660 --> 02:08:06,580
makes you that good.
No,

2968
02:08:06,650 --> 02:08:09,250
that's hard work.
Hard work and dedication.

2969
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:10,450
One hundred percent.
Not only that,

2970
02:08:10,451 --> 02:08:13,150
but they did blood and urine testing for
the fight.

2971
02:08:13,970 --> 02:08:14,210
No.

2972
02:08:14,340 --> 02:08:16,480
you know what I mean?
Like I think it was three weeks out from

2973
02:08:16,481 --> 02:08:17,690
the fight like.
Right,

2974
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:23,100
right.
And then they did urine testing after 

2975
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:23,100
urine.
I mean they can detect some stuff.

2976
02:08:23,100 --> 02:08:26,731
From what I understand,
like I'm not a master of mexicans 

2977
02:08:26,731 --> 02:08:26,860
supplements,
but I know a little bit.

2978
02:08:27,850 --> 02:08:28,720
And so,
uh,

2979
02:08:28,930 --> 02:08:29,560
yeah.
I don't know,

2980
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:31,660
I just keep bringing the compliments 
man.

2981
02:08:31,700 --> 02:08:34,560
I like it.
So if you took a guide,

2982
02:08:34,561 --> 02:08:37,940
like a guy that was known for not having
the best stamina in the world,

2983
02:08:37,941 --> 02:08:39,810
the guy who fades,
um,

2984
02:08:39,850 --> 02:08:43,420
how much time would you need to get him 
to a point where he had a fight?

2985
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:47,080
Like say he's fighting a title fight,
like it's taking a guy who's a known.

2986
02:08:47,320 --> 02:08:50,170
Here's a good example,
tyron woodley was one of the best,

2987
02:08:50,171 --> 02:08:52,850
170 pound fires and world carries a lot 
of muscle memory.

2988
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:53,070
Right?

2989
02:08:53,320 --> 02:08:56,170
He'll get tyron.
He's fucking huge.

2990
02:08:56,171 --> 02:08:57,190
I mean,
it's amazing.

2991
02:08:57,191 --> 02:08:59,950
That guy makes one 70 and they're guys 
yoked as fuck.

2992
02:09:00,220 --> 02:09:02,320
And when he gets in the cage,
I don't know how much it weighs,

2993
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:03,980
but it ain't one 70.
Right.

2994
02:09:03,990 --> 02:09:07,090
You know,
and he's known for being very fast,

2995
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:12,100
very strong in the first round,
but slows down a little bit in the 

2996
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:12,100
second one.
Right.

2997
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:13,240
How much time would you need with a guy 
like that?

2998
02:09:13,241 --> 02:09:16,270
And what would your advice be to a big 
muscular guy like that?

2999
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:18,010
Three weeks?
probably about three weeks.

3000
02:09:18,011 --> 02:09:19,300
I think that's it.
Yeah.

3001
02:09:19,490 --> 02:09:21,270
I can probably get them gone through 
weeks.

3002
02:09:21,460 --> 02:09:23,680
Three weeks.
How come you only need that much time?

3003
02:09:23,980 --> 02:09:26,980
Uh,
I'm just kind of trying to base that off

3004
02:09:26,981 --> 02:09:31,981
of like past experiences.
I'd say about three weeks to get them 

3005
02:09:31,981 --> 02:09:31,981
ready for about five rounds.

3006
02:09:33,910 --> 02:09:35,410
He might struggle a little in the fifth 
round,

3007
02:09:35,411 --> 02:09:37,180
but you made a full training camp with a
guy.

3008
02:09:37,181 --> 02:09:39,090
He'll do like seven or eight rounds.
Heart,

3009
02:09:39,110 --> 02:09:40,450
no problem.
Seven,

3010
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:42,430
eight were not humble.
What is a full training camp for you?

3011
02:09:42,431 --> 02:09:43,030
Look,
if you.

3012
02:09:43,031 --> 02:09:48,031
Ideally roughly eight weeks.
So if you had a guy and you wanted to 

3013
02:09:48,031 --> 02:09:51,010
get a guy to the best possible shape for
five rounds,

3014
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:53,740
he say he's going to be fighting robbie 
lawler for the title.

3015
02:09:54,080 --> 02:09:56,530
You've got to go five rounds through 
fucking hell.

3016
02:09:58,090 --> 02:10:00,730
How long would it take?
It depends who it is and again,

3017
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:03,820
what he's had in the past.
So I'd have to assess them first.

3018
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:06,730
So if you give me a guy who's got good 
cardio and he,

3019
02:10:06,790 --> 02:10:11,230
his stamina has been in,
his stamina is not known for stamina.

3020
02:10:11,410 --> 02:10:14,800
He's not known for selling.
I could have him ready for probably like

3021
02:10:14,801 --> 02:10:15,670
four or five weeks.

3022
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:19,150
then once you take a guy like that who's
got a lot of extra muscle,

3023
02:10:19,730 --> 02:10:21,040
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry to interrupt,

3024
02:10:21,041 --> 02:10:26,041
but again,
he did have to prioritize that in this 

3025
02:10:26,041 --> 02:10:29,250
training,
so something else might have to be 

3026
02:10:29,250 --> 02:10:30,010
substituted it because training energy 
systems is very taxing.

3027
02:10:30,011 --> 02:10:35,011
So let's say we're doing sprints or 
we're doing something to train the 

3028
02:10:35,011 --> 02:10:39,071
energy systems one day.
Then he might have to shorten his 

3029
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:39,071
wrestling.
He did.

3030
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:39,071
He'd have to be willing to make a 
sacrifice,

3031
02:10:39,071 --> 02:10:40,040
shortened his wrestling.
You know what I mean?

3032
02:10:40,820 --> 02:10:42,480
yeah.
You've got to find a,

3033
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,530
an even trade off where you don't 
compromise,

3034
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:48,410
um,
all the aspects of the,

3035
02:10:48,411 --> 02:10:50,270
of the,
of what the athlete needs.

3036
02:10:50,540 --> 02:10:55,540
So the skills,
the skill work almost takes second 

3037
02:10:55,540 --> 02:10:57,440
place.
If the guy's conditioning is bad,

3038
02:10:57,441 --> 02:10:58,970
you have to look at the athlete as a 
whole.

3039
02:10:58,971 --> 02:11:01,580
So if the guy sucks at wrestling,
but he's got great stamina,

3040
02:11:01,581 --> 02:11:06,581
then you need to devote more time to the
wrestling or striking a fist striking 

3041
02:11:06,581 --> 02:11:06,710
socks.

3042
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:08,630
and he's good at jujitsu and he's good 
at wrestling.

3043
02:11:08,930 --> 02:11:13,930
He's got no stamina.
Then you've got to devote your time to 

3044
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:13,930
this a little more time to the stamina 
and the striking.

3045
02:11:13,930 --> 02:11:15,440
They try to build that up,
but again,

3046
02:11:15,441 --> 02:11:20,441
with the skill,
there's only so much you can do on a 

3047
02:11:20,441 --> 02:11:20,930
train in one training camp that's more 
like a year long process.

3048
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:26,400
No.
Do you hook you guys up with 

3049
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:26,400
nutritionists?
If they don't have one?

3050
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:27,070
Do you have someone that you know,
you don't.

3051
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:30,410
Usually they have their own guys and but
if they asked me then I'll help him,

3052
02:11:30,470 --> 02:11:31,650
you know what I mean?
But you know,

3053
02:11:31,820 --> 02:11:34,730
I'm not a licensed nutritionist or 
anything like that,

3054
02:11:34,731 --> 02:11:39,731
but an older they're raphael's use and 
george lockhart who's getting kind of 

3055
02:11:39,731 --> 02:11:42,650
popular and he's pretty happy with him 
and I think ricardo's using him to.

3056
02:11:43,160 --> 02:11:48,160
A lot of these guys,
they get their meals prepped way in 

3057
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:48,160
advance.

3058
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:50,590
They get them in like little tupperware 
boxes and they keep them in the fridge 

3059
02:11:50,590 --> 02:11:52,750
and then heat them up before each meal.
Son some girl or something like that.

3060
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,310
They delivered to your house.
Oh really?

3061
02:11:55,340 --> 02:12:00,340
Yeah.
There's one son foods or something like 

3062
02:12:00,340 --> 02:12:02,321
that.
They can deliver and it's all athlete 

3063
02:12:02,321 --> 02:12:02,321
prepared stuff they can do.
They can.

3064
02:12:02,321 --> 02:12:04,310
You can tell him what you want and got 
like a menu or something like that.

3065
02:12:04,311 --> 02:12:09,311
I think.
I think it's called sun foods or 

3066
02:12:09,311 --> 02:12:10,901
something because I would think that the
more things you could take out of the 

3067
02:12:10,901 --> 02:12:13,010
athlete's mind that they have to think 
about the more happy sources they have.

3068
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:13,940
Right?
Yeah,

3069
02:12:14,060 --> 02:12:15,250
absolutely.
Yeah.

3070
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:23,930
How did one marina ventures when they 
developed this sort of style of 

3071
02:12:23,930 --> 02:12:26,480
training?
Was this met with skepticism?

3072
02:12:27,230 --> 02:12:28,520
Still is.
Still is.

3073
02:12:28,550 --> 02:12:33,550
Yeah.
There's going to be a lot of haters on 

3074
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:33,550
the comments on youtube.
I don't know.

3075
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:33,550
I'm sure.
Chance squat.

3076
02:12:33,550 --> 02:12:35,030
What do you mean you can't do a dead 
lift?

3077
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:37,630
You know what I mean?
Like unless you can prove it,

3078
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:41,540
show us that the proof in what you're 
saying.

3079
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:43,280
Like we,
we already know the proof is out there.

3080
02:12:43,281 --> 02:12:44,900
You just have to to,
to,

3081
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:47,690
to read the fine tax of the nervous 
system training.

3082
02:12:47,750 --> 02:12:52,750
You know the,
the records that they have on the 

3083
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:52,750
nervous system training.
I mean,

3084
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:55,190
I think my theory is that this whole 
thing with the weight lifting came about

3085
02:12:55,191 --> 02:12:59,750
because they needed like a universal 
measurement,

3086
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:04,810
you know what I mean?
Like they needed to be able to put a 

3087
02:13:04,810 --> 02:13:06,671
number on improvement and so they would 
use weights because it's universal so 

3088
02:13:07,491 --> 02:13:11,180
that can kind of show regardless of 
whether or not it's good for sports.

3089
02:13:11,180 --> 02:13:13,340
It's just showing an improvement in 
strength.

3090
02:13:13,820 --> 02:13:18,820
You know what I mean?
That's before they have all the fancy 

3091
02:13:18,820 --> 02:13:20,591
monitors.
Athletes in the us now are gravitating 

3092
02:13:20,591 --> 02:13:20,780
farther and farther away from weight 
lifting.

3093
02:13:21,170 --> 02:13:24,050
A lot of the football guys,
they do it because they have to.

3094
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:29,051
They don't like to do it.
They don't like the way it makes them 

3095
02:13:29,051 --> 02:13:29,051
feel.
The boxers hate it.

3096
02:13:29,051 --> 02:13:30,050
Like I haven't met a boxer yet that has 
told me,

3097
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:31,290
yeah,
I want to hit the weights.

3098
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:34,530
They don't like it because it makes them
too stiff and it makes them to slow.

3099
02:13:34,860 --> 02:13:39,860
Marquez was lifted in a lot of weights 
for their pacquiao fight when they 

3100
02:13:39,860 --> 02:13:40,910
showed that 24 slash seven or whatever 
the fuck hbo corner.

3101
02:13:41,300 --> 02:13:43,920
So what it is 24 slash seven.
When they showed his routine,

3102
02:13:43,921 --> 02:13:46,710
I mean a lot of it was like weight,
like weight lifting,

3103
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:48,000
dumbbells,
heavy dumbbells.

3104
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:49,530
Yeah.
Pretty crazy.

3105
02:13:49,531 --> 02:13:50,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

3106
02:13:50,610 --> 02:13:53,490
But he wasn't clean for that.
I mean it's just.

3107
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:56,220
No,
it's just like I showed it looked like a

3108
02:13:56,221 --> 02:13:58,980
24 year old beach model man.
You know what I mean,

3109
02:13:58,981 --> 02:14:02,180
like 41 mexican,
you know,

3110
02:14:02,260 --> 02:14:03,360
like been through wars,
like,

3111
02:14:03,790 --> 02:14:05,710
you know what I mean?
It's like you guys shut up.

3112
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:07,480
That was ridiculous.
I mean,

3113
02:14:08,070 --> 02:14:09,090
yeah.
And it might be.

3114
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:10,580
That might've been a fight.
We're packed.

3115
02:14:10,581 --> 02:14:13,460
Y'all was cleaned for the first time,
you know.

3116
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:16,500
Well there was always a lot of 
speculation about him as well.

3117
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:17,460
Right.
And then,

3118
02:14:17,480 --> 02:14:22,480
you know,
he found jesus in a very deep and 

3119
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:22,480
meaningful way for awhile.
Right.

3120
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:26,750
And his body changed a little bit.
His body changed quite a lot of 

3121
02:14:27,150 --> 02:14:28,260
divisions.
It will,

3122
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:29,890
the titles,
different ways.

3123
02:14:29,900 --> 02:14:31,350
Divisions.
That's pretty crazy.

3124
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:36,380
Yeah.
And kept his knockout power all the way 

3125
02:14:36,380 --> 02:14:38,661
up to.
That's just about it actually hasn't 

3126
02:14:38,661 --> 02:14:38,661
knocked anyone out though in the last 
what,

3127
02:14:38,661 --> 02:14:39,180
five yeaRs or something like that or 
like,

3128
02:14:39,240 --> 02:14:39,850
I don't have any many.

3129
02:14:40,040 --> 02:14:41,600
You got to be thinking about who he's 
fighting.

3130
02:14:41,630 --> 02:14:45,090
No fighting world class competition.
You guys are very different.

3131
02:14:45,460 --> 02:14:48,200
Very difficult to hit me in the last big
k.

3132
02:14:48,201 --> 02:14:48,930
I was like,
what?

3133
02:14:48,931 --> 02:14:50,130
Ricky hatton.
YEah,

3134
02:14:50,190 --> 02:14:52,320
but he fucked up.
Chris algieri.

3135
02:14:52,350 --> 02:14:54,800
I mean he knocked him down.
That was pretty badly hurt.

3136
02:14:55,470 --> 02:14:57,720
He looked great in that fight.
Chris algieri though.

3137
02:14:57,721 --> 02:14:58,770
He's,
he's got it.

3138
02:14:58,771 --> 02:15:01,790
Some balance issues and his feet and 
this I can tell and it doesn't buy.

3139
02:15:01,810 --> 02:15:02,920
Absolutely.
You know,

3140
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:07,560
you can tell by looking at a guy's caps.
So the gas,

3141
02:15:07,690 --> 02:15:10,380
the two calf muscles on the side of the 
other calf right there.

3142
02:15:10,381 --> 02:15:11,940
If they're really underdeveloped,
the guys,

3143
02:15:11,941 --> 02:15:14,150
chances are the guys got poor balance 
[inaudible] let's do it.

3144
02:15:14,350 --> 02:15:16,800
Sort of fast twitch muscles that control
your balance.

3145
02:15:17,250 --> 02:15:19,950
So like packouts footwork is fricking 
amazing,

3146
02:15:19,960 --> 02:15:24,960
right?
You see the size of his cast or 

3147
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:24,960
watermelons.
Exactly.

3148
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:29,210
So that plays a crucial role iN lateral 
movement and footwork.

3149
02:15:29,430 --> 02:15:31,710
So he took a guy.
You look at one more kids,

3150
02:15:31,770 --> 02:15:34,740
doesn't have great footwork,
but have you seen his kaz?

3151
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:37,380
They're like noodles.
What about jon jones?

3152
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:39,550
Jon jones is another guy.
He's really skinny cow.

3153
02:15:39,600 --> 02:15:41,610
He doesn't have very good footwork.
He's quick,

3154
02:15:41,611 --> 02:15:43,950
His upper body is quick and he's got 
quick leg kicks,

3155
02:15:43,951 --> 02:15:45,800
but he doesn't have the greatest 
footwork,

3156
02:15:45,810 --> 02:15:46,920
I don't think.
Really?

3157
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:48,030
Yeah,
I don't think so.

3158
02:15:48,270 --> 02:15:52,050
Rafael has pretty good footwork now.
He's in and out real quick.

3159
02:15:52,080 --> 02:15:54,030
You know what I mean?
You see thAt in the henderson fight?

3160
02:15:54,031 --> 02:15:55,050
For sure.
For sure.

3161
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:57,240
Yeah.
Uh,

3162
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,640
who else?
Pianist.

3163
02:15:58,710 --> 02:16:00,540
I haven't been following the ufc that 
much.

3164
02:16:00,610 --> 02:16:04,380
Your work with dos anjos is what got me 
excited about talking to you.

3165
02:16:04,730 --> 02:16:06,720
have a lot of fighters started 
contacting,

3166
02:16:06,721 --> 02:16:09,120
you know,
I've been contacted by a lot of guys,

3167
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:10,500
you know,
I'm very like,

3168
02:16:10,501 --> 02:16:12,200
uh,
I'm,

3169
02:16:12,420 --> 02:16:14,250
I'm very choosy about who I trained.

3170
02:16:14,790 --> 02:16:17,190
So only so many hours in the day.
not only that,

3171
02:16:17,191 --> 02:16:19,140
but there's,
there's Different personalities,

3172
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:19,540
man.
It's,

3173
02:16:19,541 --> 02:16:22,190
it's exhausting.
Like guys,

3174
02:16:22,290 --> 02:16:25,350
you don't want to listen or they don't 
want to have time for that anymore.

3175
02:16:25,351 --> 02:16:27,270
I'm done with that.
Like I did that in the beginning.

3176
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:28,920
I did a lot of shit and had to deal with
it.

3177
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:32,020
Now it's like,
if I sense right off the bat,

3178
02:16:32,021 --> 02:16:33,070
you're not serious.
I'm just,

3179
02:16:33,160 --> 02:16:38,160
we're done.
And that's how the marinovich is 

3180
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:38,160
treated.
Bj and the sec.

3181
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,580
This camp with frankie,
I think.

3182
02:16:39,700 --> 02:16:40,720
Yeah,
but I think,

3183
02:16:40,740 --> 02:16:42,940
you know,
miriam is really cared about bj.

3184
02:16:42,941 --> 02:16:43,490
Dude,
it's,

3185
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:48,500
it's a funny thing when you're working 
with a guy that close you really get 

3186
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:52,051
attached to them.
You really care about their wellbeing 

3187
02:16:52,051 --> 02:16:52,051
and I think they took it aS kind of like
a,

3188
02:16:53,050 --> 02:16:55,660
like an insult and kinda like,
almost like a,

3189
02:16:55,720 --> 02:16:56,200
like,
um,

3190
02:16:57,310 --> 02:16:59,910
almost like a stab in the back when he 
questioned their,

3191
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:05,540
their,
their intelligence as far as training 

3192
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:05,540
goes,
like,

3193
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:05,540
you know,
their,

3194
02:17:05,540 --> 02:17:08,731
their programming,
the way they programmed the training 

3195
02:17:08,731 --> 02:17:08,731
camp.

3196
02:17:08,731 --> 02:17:08,890
So I think that,
I think they were hurt by that,

3197
02:17:08,891 --> 02:17:10,210
you know,
to this day.

3198
02:17:10,211 --> 02:17:11,170
I mean,
gary and marv,

3199
02:17:11,171 --> 02:17:12,280
you know,
if he talked to them,

3200
02:17:12,730 --> 02:17:14,680
uh,
they're still saying,

3201
02:17:14,681 --> 02:17:16,580
you know,
I just can't figure out why he,

3202
02:17:16,650 --> 02:17:17,710
he had it.
He,

3203
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:20,420
he,
he knew how he felt after the training.

3204
02:17:20,421 --> 02:17:23,740
And why would you get rid of it?
Why was hard,

3205
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:29,320
you know,
it's also when you're that good and you 

3206
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:29,320
have so many.
Yes,

3207
02:17:29,320 --> 02:17:29,320
men around you.
That's the problem.

3208
02:17:29,321 --> 02:17:32,410
It's very hard.
That's the biggest problem I was staying

3209
02:17:32,411 --> 02:17:33,340
in Hawaii,
man.

3210
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:34,660
All the hawaiians is gonna.
Hate me now,

3211
02:17:35,170 --> 02:17:40,170
but stay in Hawaii.
The reason why I stayed in Hawaii 

3212
02:17:40,170 --> 02:17:40,230
because Hawaii is fucking awesome.
Fucking great.

3213
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:45,400
Don't get me wrong.
I wouldn't just do the same training 

3214
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:46,990
partners over and over.
That's just monotony kills athletes.

3215
02:17:47,140 --> 02:17:50,680
It does and also being the baddest 
motherfucker in the room has to be.

3216
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:52,270
Yeah,
you got to be challenged.

3217
02:17:52,300 --> 02:17:55,450
Even here with the root ca training when
they're at the root of training camp for

3218
02:17:55,451 --> 02:17:57,830
the diego sanchez and we had amazing 
guys in there,

3219
02:17:57,831 --> 02:17:59,470
like I was in there training with them 
everyday.

3220
02:17:59,880 --> 02:18:04,880
A benson henderson was in there for an 
escadera who just won the ultimate 

3221
02:18:05,231 --> 02:18:08,680
fighter that year.
A lot of other guys,

3222
02:18:08,681 --> 02:18:11,850
division one wrestlers.
Bj just tore through everybody like they

3223
02:18:11,851 --> 02:18:13,780
are nothing.
I didn't see one person.

3224
02:18:13,781 --> 02:18:15,180
You get the better of him.
Wow.

3225
02:18:15,220 --> 02:18:17,620
Imagine a cage filled with like 15 of 
these intense,

3226
02:18:17,621 --> 02:18:21,100
like hardcore lightweights and bj just 
walking through all of them.

3227
02:18:21,101 --> 02:18:24,340
His timing was so precise.
Elastic energy in his muscles,

3228
02:18:24,341 --> 02:18:28,510
he elastic strength that he had his 
explosive power was just remarkable.

3229
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:33,600
His take down the fence when he was at 
his very best was absolutely retarded 

3230
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:34,750
too.
He'd be able to hop around on one leg.

3231
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:37,420
I mean it just is.
Flexibility is ridiculous.

3232
02:18:37,540 --> 02:18:40,670
I tried to take him down many times to 
no avail.

3233
02:18:40,690 --> 02:18:45,550
Look kind of flexibility to that guy.
Have ridiculous dynamic flexibility.

3234
02:18:45,700 --> 02:18:49,330
He'd do a lot of stuff with like rubber 
straps and stuff.

3235
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:52,750
Pulling on them and resisting and 
stretching this camp.

3236
02:18:52,751 --> 02:18:55,270
He was doing all the same stuff that 
basically that I'm doing,

3237
02:18:55,290 --> 02:19:00,290
you know,
that I do in my guys like the dynamic 

3238
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:00,290
stretching,
you know the,

3239
02:19:00,290 --> 02:19:03,740
a lot of the exercises on the stability 
ball and workouts in the pool.

3240
02:19:03,820 --> 02:19:07,480
Stuff they use for rehabilitation,
but you can progress that and use it for

3241
02:19:07,481 --> 02:19:10,570
performance as well.
So if it's good for rehabilitation,

3242
02:19:10,571 --> 02:19:12,220
you know,
you take it to another level,

3243
02:19:12,221 --> 02:19:17,221
it's got to be good for performance.
What is your education background when 

3244
02:19:17,221 --> 02:19:20,971
it comes to this stuff?
I went to continuation school and high 

3245
02:19:20,971 --> 02:19:21,760
school,
got obsessed with weird things.

3246
02:19:21,860 --> 02:19:23,440
That's about It.
It's continuation school,

3247
02:19:23,441 --> 02:19:28,441
you know,
you get kicked out of high school to go 

3248
02:19:28,441 --> 02:19:28,441
to like had to go to continuation

3249
02:19:28,441 --> 02:19:28,670
school.
I didn't,

3250
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,270
I've never heard that before.
Yeah,

3251
02:19:31,130 --> 02:19:34,340
you have an informal background training
background.

3252
02:19:34,380 --> 02:19:35,300
You know,
it's funny.

3253
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:40,580
Mark did to marv.
Marv majored in fine arts from usc.

3254
02:19:40,880 --> 02:19:41,720
Really?
Yeah.

3255
02:19:41,870 --> 02:19:46,870
And that was my,
that was my major in junior college was 

3256
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:46,870
fine.
Arts and psychology,

3257
02:19:46,870 --> 02:19:50,750
so everything you learn,
you sort of learn along the way from 

3258
02:19:50,750 --> 02:19:51,610
reading studies and data.

3259
02:19:51,860 --> 02:19:55,140
Rehabilitating my own body after the car
accident that waS,

3260
02:19:55,150 --> 02:20:00,150
that was big.
I went to supposedly the best physical 

3261
02:20:00,150 --> 02:20:02,891
therapists in the area and six months 
later I've got a huge bill and no 

3262
02:20:02,891 --> 02:20:04,570
results so I just took it into my own 
hands,

3263
02:20:04,571 --> 02:20:08,330
started researching it,
I now what to do and then within a month

3264
02:20:08,331 --> 02:20:10,360
or two I'm,
I'm already back at work on.

3265
02:20:10,430 --> 02:20:15,430
Great.
So then how long have you been training 

3266
02:20:15,430 --> 02:20:15,430
fighters now?
How many fighters?

3267
02:20:15,430 --> 02:20:19,840
You know,
like a before I started training the 

3268
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:19,840
fighters and strictly doing 
conditioning,

3269
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:23,381
you know,
I was also working with like football 

3270
02:20:23,381 --> 02:20:23,450
athletes in soccer.
I've got A ton of college athletes,

3271
02:20:23,451 --> 02:20:28,451
you know,
I don't think I can talk about them 

3272
02:20:28,451 --> 02:20:30,071
because the ncaa rules or whatever,
you can't use them for reference from 

3273
02:20:30,071 --> 02:20:30,071
promotion.
Exactly.

3274
02:20:30,071 --> 02:20:32,030
But um,
some pretty high level ones,

3275
02:20:32,090 --> 02:20:37,090
a lot of high school athletes,
but prior to that I had a jujitsu 

3276
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:38,190
academy also.
And um,

3277
02:20:38,600 --> 02:20:43,600
so I was always,
I've always been in the mix with like 

3278
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:43,910
the jujitsu scene and mac,
stuff like that.

3279
02:20:44,300 --> 02:20:49,300
So then I just had so much more success 
with the conditioning that I had just 

3280
02:20:49,300 --> 02:20:49,940
gone that direction.

3281
02:20:50,310 --> 02:20:55,310
Well,
one of the things I like about this 

3282
02:20:55,310 --> 02:20:56,901
conversation is there really is no 
straight consensus about what's the 

3283
02:20:56,901 --> 02:21:00,630
right way to train athletes and fighters
and especially fighters.

3284
02:21:00,870 --> 02:21:04,200
I think when it comes to strength and 
conditioning fighters,

3285
02:21:04,201 --> 02:21:08,460
I think did,
it is probably the most varied.

3286
02:21:08,580 --> 02:21:12,360
I mean I think the nfl kind of has an 
idea of how to train football players.

3287
02:21:12,650 --> 02:21:15,510
The nba players train very similar 
fashion,

3288
02:21:15,511 --> 02:21:18,240
bUt with the fighters man,
it's across the meanness.

3289
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:20,760
It saw the cain velasquez,
cain velasquez,

3290
02:21:20,761 --> 02:21:23,970
that motherfucker on the planet and you 
saw what he's going through.

3291
02:21:24,330 --> 02:21:26,460
And I want to see his leg extensions 
now.

3292
02:21:26,520 --> 02:21:31,520
Yeah,
you do pull up cain velasquez leg 

3293
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,990
extension 100 pounds.
I'm just wondering how good this guy 

3294
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:33,990
could be with good training.
Yeah.

3295
02:21:33,990 --> 02:21:34,800
You know what I mean?
Well,

3296
02:21:34,801 --> 02:21:38,330
he's got great wrestling training and 
great kickbox training conditioning.

3297
02:21:38,340 --> 02:21:41,010
Let me say that.
I'm just wondering how good he can be.

3298
02:21:41,011 --> 02:21:43,370
Like with that.
His fucking conditioning is.

3299
02:21:44,180 --> 02:21:46,680
his stamina is insane.
But his speed and his

3300
02:21:46,800 --> 02:21:48,060
coordination.
I don't know.

3301
02:21:48,090 --> 02:21:50,220
Maybe it can be even at another level.
Who knows?

3302
02:21:50,380 --> 02:21:51,720
Wow.
You know what I mean?

3303
02:21:52,290 --> 02:21:53,510
Let's put it this way to this.

3304
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:58,420
Oh look at this.

3305
02:21:59,250 --> 02:22:01,650
Three hundred pounds on the lakes 
extension machine.

3306
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:11,050
What do you think about this?
So it's nice getting help.

3307
02:22:11,690 --> 02:22:14,240
I don't know what that's going to help.
I don't know what it's going to build up

3308
02:22:14,241 --> 02:22:15,560
his quads.
I guess.

3309
02:22:15,710 --> 02:22:18,130
I don't know what part of your extension
on muslim,

3310
02:22:18,530 --> 02:22:20,360
I don't know.
Desire to help,

3311
02:22:20,440 --> 02:22:25,440
like throw leg kicks or anything now 
it's just all caveman shit he looking 

3312
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,040
at.
This is not even cave man.

3313
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:29,490
This is like nautilus,
like jack lalaine type stuff.

3314
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:32,700
I used to work at a place that I used to
teach people how to do that.

3315
02:22:34,840 --> 02:22:39,840
Yeah.
I worked at a place called the boston 

3316
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:40,500
athletic club in south boston to teach 
people how to lift weights.

3317
02:22:40,610 --> 02:22:41,570
Yeah.
Uh,

3318
02:22:41,660 --> 02:22:43,960
so when I see that,
I just wonder how much better they could

3319
02:22:43,990 --> 02:22:45,650
be.
Good training.

3320
02:22:45,710 --> 02:22:46,210
I mean,
I know,

3321
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:48,320
I know it works.
I've been around this stuff for 15,

3322
02:22:48,321 --> 02:22:49,030
20 years,
you know,

3323
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:52,520
strength and conditioning and seeing 
what works and it just,

3324
02:22:53,570 --> 02:22:57,140
I know it works like marv to him and his
brother combined.

3325
02:22:57,141 --> 02:22:58,940
Seventy years of experience,
maybe more.

3326
02:22:59,210 --> 02:23:02,150
Maybe it's 80 now and they've seen 
everything.

3327
02:23:02,151 --> 02:23:05,330
Marv was one of the guys responsible for
designing the combine,

3328
02:23:05,331 --> 02:23:07,370
the football combine,
you know,

3329
02:23:07,480 --> 02:23:09,650
for about 40 years ago.
Amazing.

3330
02:23:09,800 --> 02:23:14,800
Yeah.
So he's seen everything to argue with 

3331
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:15,890
him about it would be just ridiculous.
Like you're way out of your league,

3332
02:23:15,920 --> 02:23:20,920
you know,
it's like talking to helio gracie about 

3333
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:22,781
jujitsu,
like there's nothing you're going to 

3334
02:23:22,781 --> 02:23:22,781
bring to the table that he hasn't seen,
you know,

3335
02:23:22,781 --> 02:23:24,980
despite all the monstrous monster 
stories that you hear.

3336
02:23:24,981 --> 02:23:27,650
Like on espn,
he was one of the worst sports father.

3337
02:23:27,651 --> 02:23:30,290
It's all this media did.
It's bullshit.

3338
02:23:30,291 --> 02:23:35,120
He's actually one of the most generous 
fucking guys in the training of trainers

3339
02:23:35,121 --> 02:23:37,820
that I've met.
He's one of the most generous and it was

3340
02:23:37,821 --> 02:23:39,680
one of the most transparent guys I've 
ever met.

3341
02:23:40,370 --> 02:23:42,110
Honest guy.
That's awesome.

3342
02:23:42,111 --> 02:23:43,610
I think all about the product.

3343
02:23:43,750 --> 02:23:46,990
The problem,
the problem with the espn documentary,

3344
02:23:46,991 --> 02:23:50,770
we said his son went off the rails and 
when the sun goes off the rails,

3345
02:23:50,771 --> 02:23:54,160
everybody looks for someone to blame.
You know that he was too strict,

3346
02:23:54,470 --> 02:23:56,680
didn't give his son sugar.
He didn't even let it sunny meet,

3347
02:23:56,681 --> 02:23:57,690
right?
Uh,

3348
02:23:57,940 --> 02:23:58,840
I think he did.
I don't know.

3349
02:23:58,841 --> 02:24:00,780
I don't know about that.
It was something on the documentary.

3350
02:24:00,810 --> 02:24:05,810
They were saying,
well it didn't let him have wheat 

3351
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:05,810
gluten.
I think.

3352
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:05,810
Really?
Yeah.

3353
02:24:05,810 --> 02:24:07,160
Even back then I think they were saying 
meet.

3354
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:10,330
I saw it really recently.
Maybe it was certain types of meat.

3355
02:24:10,420 --> 02:24:11,800
Yeah.
When I knew I was going to talk to you.

3356
02:24:12,070 --> 02:24:13,660
I think that's when I watched it.
Um,

3357
02:24:14,050 --> 02:24:15,850
but uh,
it's just,

3358
02:24:15,910 --> 02:24:20,910
it's fascinating to see a guy with that 
much knowledge take a sun and turn them 

3359
02:24:20,910 --> 02:24:22,450
into this fucking super freak athlete.
I mean,

3360
02:24:22,490 --> 02:24:27,280
as in certain ways it was sort of,
I mean it was vindicated.

3361
02:24:27,700 --> 02:24:32,700
His techniques and strategies have been,
look how good is god damn son was until 

3362
02:24:32,700 --> 02:24:33,970
you go crazy with the drugs and the 
partying and all that stuff.

3363
02:24:34,970 --> 02:24:38,110
The idea was that the discipline was too
much and he couldn't take it anymore and

3364
02:24:38,111 --> 02:24:39,730
then he had to start it.
And

3365
02:24:40,340 --> 02:24:42,340
do you want drugs?
You know,

3366
02:24:42,810 --> 02:24:45,630
you can blame it on whatever you want 
and only put the stuff into his mouth.

3367
02:24:45,870 --> 02:24:46,290
You know what I mean?

3368
02:24:46,340 --> 02:24:47,660
Right.
That's a good point.

3369
02:24:48,020 --> 02:24:53,020
And you could get 10 different 
personalities when you know you have a 

3370
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:53,020
son,
if you have more kids.

3371
02:24:53,020 --> 02:24:53,870
I have three.
They're all,

3372
02:24:53,900 --> 02:24:56,360
they come out of the box completely 
different.

3373
02:24:56,820 --> 02:24:58,760
You know,
they just worried about math.

3374
02:24:58,790 --> 02:25:02,570
Like I love my son so much,
I don't know anything different,

3375
02:25:02,571 --> 02:25:03,170
you know,
it's,

3376
02:25:03,171 --> 02:25:04,760
believe me,
I have two.

3377
02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:07,250
My two youngest are completely 
different.

3378
02:25:07,251 --> 02:25:09,650
I love them equally.
They're totally different,

3379
02:25:09,950 --> 02:25:11,720
but there they have their own little 
thing going on.

3380
02:25:11,721 --> 02:25:15,950
But the point being that it's a 
different children,

3381
02:25:15,951 --> 02:25:20,951
different humans will react differently 
to different forms of diversity that 

3382
02:25:20,951 --> 02:25:22,610
they face and there's only so much you 
could do as a parent,

3383
02:25:22,670 --> 02:25:24,090
you know,
you can't really

3384
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:28,180
totally protect them and shield them.
And it seemed like his son has come back

3385
02:25:28,181 --> 02:25:30,130
from all that stuff and he's okay now,
right?

3386
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:32,600
Yeah.
But just as an artist man,

3387
02:25:32,630 --> 02:25:35,230
his arts pretty bitch until now.
I guess he's living up in Oregon,

3388
02:25:35,231 --> 02:25:36,700
you know,
I don't really know todd very well,

3389
02:25:36,701 --> 02:25:39,040
but I've actually never even met todd.
So.

3390
02:25:39,460 --> 02:25:40,570
But uh,
yeah,

3391
02:25:40,571 --> 02:25:42,940
I guess he's living up in Oregon and 
it's got some killer art man.

3392
02:25:43,210 --> 02:25:47,400
And there's also the reality that when 
you push your son or your daughter,

3393
02:25:47,410 --> 02:25:49,180
anyone,
any human being,

3394
02:25:49,480 --> 02:25:52,240
they,
people have a resistance to some of that

3395
02:25:52,241 --> 02:25:54,520
shit and they don't want to do what you 
want them to do.

3396
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:56,680
And they developed a distaste for 
something,

3397
02:25:56,681 --> 02:25:59,740
even something that they're really,
really talented at.

3398
02:25:59,741 --> 02:26:01,780
Yeah.
That's possible as well.

3399
02:26:01,781 --> 02:26:02,590
Yeah.
Well,

3400
02:26:02,591 --> 02:26:07,591
you know what the funny thIng is,
did you ever read that story about his 

3401
02:26:07,591 --> 02:26:10,450
son run into like a tenncare something 
when he was four years old?

3402
02:26:10,510 --> 02:26:15,510
No,
they didn't really like an eight minute 

3403
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:15,510
mile or something when he's four years 
old.

3404
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:16,870
And I asked them about that one day.
I said,

3405
02:26:16,871 --> 02:26:18,410
mom,
what the hell is that like,

3406
02:26:18,430 --> 02:26:20,350
you know,
like an eight minute mile.

3407
02:26:20,351 --> 02:26:21,420
He's like,
so yeah.

3408
02:26:21,421 --> 02:26:22,450
You know what?
I can't figure out.

3409
02:26:22,451 --> 02:26:24,610
Nick is why everybody thinks I made him 
do it.

3410
02:26:26,110 --> 02:26:28,790
I didn't make him do it.
That's what he said he wanted to do it.

3411
02:26:29,320 --> 02:26:31,570
So he had that drive and that intensity 
that,

3412
02:26:32,530 --> 02:26:37,530
you know what I mean?
So it's kinda like shed some light on 

3413
02:26:37,530 --> 02:26:37,530
some things right there.
Well,

3414
02:26:37,810 --> 02:26:38,800
hey man,
you know,

3415
02:26:38,920 --> 02:26:41,350
whenever someone comes out in a weird 
way,

3416
02:26:41,480 --> 02:26:46,480
you use a lot of people are trying to 
point blame and a lot of different 

3417
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:46,480
areas,
whether it's the fram,

3418
02:26:46,480 --> 02:26:51,150
the friends of the family or the seemed 
like just college coaches had a real 

3419
02:26:51,150 --> 02:26:51,150
issue with him as well,
right?

3420
02:26:51,150 --> 02:26:52,450
Yeah.
Put them in a box.

3421
02:26:52,660 --> 02:26:54,970
Yeah,
that's a.

3422
02:26:55,810 --> 02:26:58,730
Yeah.
And then he kind of took over and worked

3423
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:04,400
for.
I was made the coach look foolish and 

3424
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:04,400
they didn't like that either.
Right.

3425
02:27:04,400 --> 02:27:05,740
um,
what is the name of that documentary?

3426
02:27:05,820 --> 02:27:09,520
But he wants to watch it like a 30,
30,

3427
02:27:09,521 --> 02:27:12,100
and 30 or some of the project.
Wasn't that it?

3428
02:27:12,340 --> 02:27:17,340
I think that was at a mars in the 
beginning talking about he's an 

3429
02:27:17,340 --> 02:27:18,610
undefeated wrestler,
undefeated boxer.

3430
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:23,850
That's great man.
A lot of people don't know that about 

3431
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:23,850
him.
He was a football player too,

3432
02:27:23,850 --> 02:27:24,700
you know?
Uh,

3433
02:27:24,701 --> 02:27:29,701
but he was also an undefeated boxer and 
wrestler through the army and college 

3434
02:27:29,701 --> 02:27:29,701
and stuff.
And his,

3435
02:27:29,701 --> 02:27:34,321
just,
his fascination with training athletes 

3436
02:27:34,321 --> 02:27:34,321
was more powerful than his fascination 
with competing.

3437
02:27:34,330 --> 02:27:35,290
Well,
he wAs.

3438
02:27:35,291 --> 02:27:40,291
So I guess mara was sold into 
weightlifting and he felt the destroyed 

3439
02:27:40,291 --> 02:27:44,881
his athleticism once he went to the 
raiders and he was competing with the 

3440
02:27:44,881 --> 02:27:47,821
guys in the weight room human,
he's squatting a thousand pounds and he 

3441
02:27:47,821 --> 02:27:49,740
said his athleticism had never been 
worse.

3442
02:27:49,800 --> 02:27:54,800
It was the,
when he was doing that and that just 

3443
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:54,800
destroyed his professional career.
That's interesting.

3444
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:55,630
Yeah.
Wow.

3445
02:27:56,110 --> 02:27:58,060
And so that,
that was in the sixties,

3446
02:27:58,061 --> 02:27:59,880
right?
Like it's got to be in the sixties.

3447
02:27:59,881 --> 02:28:03,190
So he figured he had that awakening s 50
years ago.

3448
02:28:03,460 --> 02:28:04,750
Wow.
And you know,

3449
02:28:04,780 --> 02:28:06,460
he's been developing this stuff for 
years.

3450
02:28:06,520 --> 02:28:09,170
So nick,
