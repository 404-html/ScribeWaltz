1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,930
Four three, two, one

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:07,590
and

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,150
we're live, this is a bummer of a fight
week, but also an awesome fight week.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,170
I'm very excited. Did you see the, the
latest count down? What does it, uh,

5
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:19,220
all access? What do they call
it? No embedded. Embedded. Yeah.

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,230
Most try to call it with the
name of those. It's really
sad. They're all the same,

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:26,250
but yeah, all access embedded 24
seven. That is very good. I should,

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,190
I should remember the name. It's very
good. They're all, yeah, they're on this.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,200
This new one is really good cause it's
got Max Holloway running on a treadmill,

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,490
two treadmills over from Nigga Madoff
who's also running on a treadmill and

11
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:40,710
they're fucking very cool to each other.
It's very interesting.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,890
It could be thanked him for taking
the fight when she should. She should.

13
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:47,900
Thanks for taking the fight. And then
they have the same weight coach. Yeah.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,510
That's crazy. Lockhart.
Right? It's the card is d.

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,350
This is Lockhart working with
number of command on both of them.

16
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,920
So Lockhart was like,
Lockhart is legit.

17
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,490
Like he goes over calculations
of how much you weigh,

18
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:05,160
how much water you're going to take,
and he's weighing things out.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,150
It took them an hour and a half to do
the calculations. It wasn't like, hey,

20
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,850
we're going to wing this. It's like,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:16,500
We're going to do this
weight cut correctly, and
he's got it down to the day,

22
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,170
you know, like it's six days to lose. He
think he was one 71 is that, is that the,

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,950
I was wondering what it,
what did he start at?

24
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,890
Is it one 71 so I think
he's got to lose 16 pounds.

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,600
What's crazy is when Max was on my show,

26
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:33,360
I was talking to him a little bit off it
and this is on record, on that spilled.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,230
Anything that he didn't say,
but he just goes with the injury.

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:42,270
Jesus credit embedded I think is
better than that. UFC, not UFC,

29
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:45,810
the HBO ones. I think it's been
24 seven yeah. How dare you?

30
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,730
I think it's better than one four seven
when there's a big fight. Yeah. You know,

31
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,330
Washington generals or
blah. I think, well,

32
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:53,520
I think in general they're better
because they do more of it.

33
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,360
But a 24 seven they're like, they're
good. They're fucking good. Very good.

34
00:01:57,361 --> 00:02:01,080
Liev Shriver. Oh, I'd love that
Bro. Watch her work on that guy.

35
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,920
But I like these better. Remember
I only cat leaves driver. Yeah.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,790
Was like night here with angle, but
it was nowhere near as it say. Yeah.

37
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,500
It was horrible because there's
almost no narration, right?

38
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,350
Yeah. It's almost just, it tells a story.
Footage. I want to see the footage.

39
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,110
I would have liked the video of
when they called Max with the fight,

40
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,380
cause from what I heard, he goes, it
could be that stuff's got in the world.

41
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,540
Fuck yeah, let's go. What?
Just insane. I was like,

42
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,370
why don't they have a video of that? But
no one knew. I don't think they knew,

43
00:02:29,371 --> 00:02:30,960
you know, to, to turn the video on.

44
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,080
I don't think Max knew
whether they were calling him.

45
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:37,080
Amazing video of him
isn't actually if he wins.

46
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,800
This is my thing with
Max is I think could be,

47
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,910
is the toughest fight in
the world on six days.

48
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:45,570
Notice I'd rather fight anybody else
in the world and could be one six days

49
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:50,490
because this style, just his tenacity.
But with, for Max win, lose or draw,

50
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:53,490
whatever happened Saturday night,
if you don't respect.

51
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:57,550
And like him even more after this,
you're a moron, you're a physician.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,980
Champions on a bra and like

53
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,880
Max Holloway's on that would be willing
to take this fight on six days notice.

54
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,810
And also I should say coming
off of a broken foot. Correct.

55
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,900
So he had a pull out of a fight with
a broken foot with Frankie Edgar.

56
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,880
What's just happened? So I mean, how
healed dizzy. And like it said on my show,

57
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,260
he was saying, you know, I've, I've been
doing some Jujitsu in the swing of things.

58
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,050
For me it's good because I haven't
been balls deep into training.

59
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,810
I've been just been a little
just to get a light workout,

60
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,800
but it gives me time with my
family. And he goes, which NGOs,

61
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,680
you know this in camp, you're present but
you're not, which is true. And he goes,

62
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,130
you know, so I'm going through it.
I'm, I'm with my son in the family.

63
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,720
But I'm thinking about something else.
He goes,

64
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,530
so this has been good for me to really
focus on my family. That was what,

65
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:44,970
two weeks ago? Three weeks ago. Wow.
So then pay him you're fighting.

66
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,770
Could be even the reason why he wants
to fight Khabib is cause he thinks could

67
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,180
be the best pound for pound
fighter in the world. Yeah.

68
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,320
And which is nuts because you know
when you look at, it could be resume.

69
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:56,170
It's good. It's, it's, it's,
it doesn't blow your hair back.

70
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,370
He's 25 and Oh for God's sake it's good.
But it's not like all this crazy,

71
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,870
you know, big names on his rag. Right.
But you talked, I was just in San Jose.

72
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,070
John Fitch goes, dude, and this is John
Fitch. Yeah. It could be, you know,

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,240
welterweight goat. He's fucking not
cope. He's got damn good. He goes,

74
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,230
I've never seen anyone my
lifetime like could be. He goes,

75
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:20,560
I fought GSP in his prime. He would
beat him. That's how good he is.

76
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,150
DC said he's the pound for pound.

77
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:25,840
Greatest fighters ever seen DC
said that he had fights with them.

78
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,670
Like dcs was the heavyweight Strikeforce
champion. He said, he goes, dude,

79
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,650
we go to war.
We go to war war.

80
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,270
Like imagine that [inaudible] Gar Willa,
he's jacked.

81
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:41,810
I mean DC's got some body fat on him.
He's strong as a fucking ox.

82
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:45,560
You see soak at downtown.
So fun. It's fun to watch.

83
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,150
When DC throws Josh Barnett through
the air, when they fought Strikeforce,

84
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:49,661
she just go,

85
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:54,430
Jesus [inaudible] fight was offensive.

86
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:56,710
That goddamn American,
it was offensive.

87
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:02,010
He ragdolled Hendo and couldn't be a
cooler guy like the nicest guy ever.

88
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:04,540
You see might be the
nicest fighter of all time.

89
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:06,430
One of my favorite people here in Max,
they're up there.

90
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,670
I love him for nicest fires. I don't know
Max as well as I would know. Do you see,

91
00:05:09,671 --> 00:05:11,110
because I've done so many shows with them,

92
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,410
but for DC as good as he is to
say that him and Khabib go to war.

93
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,070
I'm like, that's crazy to Josh
Thompson is the cap ne Kay said,

94
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,760
you know Ed Ruth Penn state and
three time national champion freak.

95
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:28,270
Just start doing MMA main belt
door, complete freak wrestling. He,

96
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,390
I was in San Jose and he, yeah,
I did a show with him and I go,

97
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:33,430
what were you doing? He goes,
I just came from practice.

98
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:36,250
Could be second class practice and
go, what was he doing? He goes, oh,

99
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,120
just straight wrestling. I said, who is
your son? He was Ed Ruth. I go, oh my God,

100
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:44,050
the Penn state like legend. He goes, yeah
man, how's that go down? And he's like,

101
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,420
the only one of them's gone down
and it could be like, what Ruth?

102
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:52,570
And he goes, oh, he goes, bro it,
I've never seen anything like it.

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,640
So there's just this legend of five.
They skipped when they tell me that,

104
00:05:56,641 --> 00:05:57,880
it scares me like Jesus.

105
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,360
Well, what do we get to see it in
action? When you saw the Barboza fight,

106
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,030
he's walking towards him like a Zombie
gets a hold of them. And just rag dolls.

107
00:06:07,031 --> 00:06:08,090
I'm just rag dolls.

108
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,000
But this is what's great about this
fight and that's what makes our sport so

109
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:13,310
specialists. Yeah, I'm super bummed.

110
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,890
I've been in deep depression
because Ferguson fell out,

111
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,690
and we've talked about this off here,

112
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,280
but our sports so special because
what Max Holloway has the chance to do

113
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:25,820
Saturday night, if he can beat him,
if he can somehow pull that out.

114
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:28,850
There's nothing like in professional
sports, there's nothing like it.

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,080
If Lebron goes out, the team still goes
on. It's whatever. If Tom Brady gets hurt,

116
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:36,830
it sucked. But they still
play here. You know man,

117
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:40,820
Max has a huge chance now are the
odds stacked against him? Good God.

118
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:43,990
Are they ever there couldn't be
a worst matchup for him, but it,

119
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,150
what's the one Achilles heel
if there is one for Khabib,

120
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,430
a guy who can strike going backwards.

121
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,270
Max Salaries Pretty fucking good
at going backwards. Yeah, it's,

122
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,500
it's a fascinating fight.
If there was no controversy,

123
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,490
if it wasn't like six day
time period for and all,

124
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,860
it's kind of cool. Do you don't
have to fight. It's been like,

125
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,440
that was a Nate when Nate
took on Connor and the first,

126
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,410
here's the difference though.
Nate's the bigger guy, right?

127
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:13,760
Nate and the bigger guy, the more seasoned
guy there. So for Nate, it's like, yeah,

128
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:17,340
it was short notice, but that's a
rough matchup for Connor. Connor.

129
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:20,030
It should be an underdog in that fight.
They wouldn't find the same weight class.

130
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:23,480
So that makes a little more sense.
But wait a minute. They do Nate.

131
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,710
Nate fights in 55 uh, before
that though, he's fighting
that 70, right? Oh No, no, no.

132
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:29,030
He only fought three times at seven.

133
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,220
But he saw that seventies the point he
fired a college never fought at 70. Right.

134
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,740
But if con when Carter fought him
at 70, that was Saturday. Yeah.

135
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,600
[inaudible] 70 pounder.
Right. But I mean, Nate,

136
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,900
when he fought 70 it didn't go
well. I mean, who did he fight?

137
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:46,190
He fought Rory Macdonald. 70
tough. Who else did he fight?

138
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,020
We will see if I had 70 his fights
at 70 I think wasn't great at, no,

139
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:54,170
he didn't lose all of them. Wasn't great
one. Yeah, it wasn't great at 70 house.

140
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,890
But the thing is, he's the bigger
man. He's a, he's a much bigger guy.

141
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,560
But if they agreed to fight at one 55
and he would make the one 55 weight,

142
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,840
100% yes.

143
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,320
It's like there was all this talk about
him being so much bigger than Conor. Oh,

144
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:09,620
he's bigger for sure. It's taller.
He's taller, he's a pizza maker.

145
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,410
He's a bigger guy.
It's around heavier when he gets heavier,

146
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,930
but when they fight at
55 he makes that weight.

147
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,090
And Connor makes that weight tough too.

148
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,270
They both struggled to make one 55 it's
a much easier cut for counter at 55 it's

149
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,350
not the hardest cut.

150
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,020
But when you look at the difference
between how he looks physically when he

151
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:31,760
fought Nate at one 70 and how he looks
when he's, you know, one 45 he was awful.

152
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,480
I was going to say he's on down one week
one 45 Nate could nav. I mean there's,

153
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,380
there's no show me could've made it
intimate fighter when he was killed a leg

154
00:08:39,381 --> 00:08:40,940
off.
You don't have to like real list.

155
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:44,150
He's not making five very thin
during the ultimate fighter days.

156
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,880
Remember we fight fighter,
right?

157
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:49,410
So you have to make weight
basically three times in a row. Why?

158
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:52,220
Just think he filled in too.
I mean he was really young back then.

159
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,680
100% but you have to
maintain a lower weight.

160
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,840
That's the closest fight to it though.
I agree that fight,

161
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:03,240
the same kind of balls that nade
has is like what? What it, but Max,

162
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,260
the difference is that like Max has
taken on a guy that everybody's avoiding.

163
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,770
No one's been able to
solve the riddle of Khabib.

164
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,960
No one's even ever even put them in
jeopardy like he's like a Johnson hit him.

165
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,810
But that really wasn't
what was going a bit.

166
00:09:18,811 --> 00:09:19,920
We were talking about that the other day.

167
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,650
Who knows what was going on in that fight
because that was a fight where he had

168
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,860
the same issue cutting weight that
he did when he had to pull out of the

169
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:29,070
Ferguson fight where his body shut down.
So who knows?

170
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,580
He had that same issue with the Michael j.

171
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,300
He might've been severely compromised in
that fight even though he beat the fuck

172
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:37,650
out of. Agree. The difference between
Mcgregor and Diaz is the both.

173
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,140
Keeping on the feet really, right? Yeah.

174
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,450
He has a phenomenal boxer comes
phenomenal striker, Max Holloway.

175
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,390
Phenomenal striker could be
phenomenal grappler. So it's a,

176
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:49,530
it's even more of a task because could
is not going to sit there and strike with

177
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:52,880
him. That's your one way to win. Cool.
I'm the best grappler on earth. Yeah.

178
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,490
He'll entertain it for a little bit,
but if you, if you want you down,

179
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,710
there's literally no
one in the world from,

180
00:09:58,711 --> 00:10:03,630
I'll say one 55 to one 70 he's not
going to take them. I want to see,

181
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,090
I really want to see him in some
straight grappling competition to,

182
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,640
you're hearing this, hearing that about
how amazing he is in the training room.

183
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,390
I'll take it from a guy
like DC. I know, and and,

184
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:18,600
and Fitch and you're talking about in
the hall, pioneers of the sport animals.

185
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,550
I want to see him against Woodley 70 I
think 70 is his natural way. Plus, yeah,

186
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,830
I think he'd probably be a lot healthier.
Imagine that.

187
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,790
Imagine being stronger and healthcare.
It Woodley and Khabib. Jesus. What?

188
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,930
But Woodley's at different thing, man.
You, you miss. You, you fuck up and you,

189
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:36,960
you leave yourself in a position to get
hit with one of those nuclear bombs.

190
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,823
Oh knock you out.

191
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,490
Woodley could put people to sleep and
he can grab was acid rap his ass off,

192
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,580
hard to take down and puts
people to sleep with one shot.

193
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,440
I don't think woody gets his due and I
think the best evidence is the two fights

194
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:53,160
that people point to where they say that
like Woodley should have done better.

195
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,670
Those are the Thompson fights.
The end of my fight, my fight.

196
00:10:56,671 --> 00:10:58,910
But Maya never got hurt like he,

197
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,580
he hit my a bunch of times but it
was uneventful cause he was hurt.

198
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,130
Woodley was her early in the
first round with the shoulder.

199
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,180
He fucked his shoulder up.
Mile the, we should fight my,

200
00:11:08,181 --> 00:11:11,670
if you don't want to go to the ground
100% but my point is in those two fights

201
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,490
with Thompson Woodley was
the one who hurt Thompson.

202
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:19,170
He hurt him that bad in both fights.
Almost stopped him in both fights. Yeah.

203
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:21,700
I don't see them ever fight again.
But I hear you. Great flood. Yeah,

204
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:27,190
I'll pass hard pass. It was a
crazy UFC 200 card that was on it.

205
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:32,130
I wouldn't be mad. I mean he's one of
the dough as a main event. I get it.

206
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,910
I get it. I like when people
twice. Wow, cool. Yeah. No,

207
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:39,900
that's a super calm kid.
Upset, upset though.

208
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,500
They're just not good dance part and
the same thing. If they just said no,

209
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,210
this time it's going to be different.
I'm going to war. I'm going to call her,

210
00:11:46,211 --> 00:11:47,044
fuck you.

211
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,720
And then two rounds and you like
bastard is circling each other.

212
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:55,860
That's like Dana on Ferguson and Khabib.
He's like, that fights never happened.

213
00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:00,220
A fifth time not happening. I'm
like, I get it. I get it man.

214
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,920
It's such a bummer though.
Let's talk business like,

215
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,470
I don't know how many paper
views this was going to do,

216
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,260
but for the hardcore fans,
this was a big one.

217
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,890
This was a big one because this is the
first time Khabib is finding a guy that's

218
00:12:11,891 --> 00:12:15,430
super versatile that can fight. Standing
up, can knock you out with one shot.

219
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,690
Tough is fuck has incredible endurance
and can grab off his back and the most

220
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:21,650
dangerous guy could be will ever face.
Yeah.

221
00:12:21,651 --> 00:12:26,651
Tony Ferguson has the perfect style to
test what was so we could really find out

222
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:30,970
where it could be exact cause we know
we're Tony's at we and we kind of know

223
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:33,280
where could bebes at,
do we? We kind of do.

224
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:37,030
We said the Barboza fight in my opinion
was the best example of it. Dos Anjos.

225
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,270
Dot. Los Angeles was great. It's
old school dos Anjos, that's a dose.

226
00:12:40,271 --> 00:12:43,570
Angeles also compromise to
make one 55 right dose Angeles.

227
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:46,390
They want 70 different animal.
That's a different fucking animal.

228
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,980
That's a totally different piece.

229
00:12:47,981 --> 00:12:52,900
And I think dos Anjos is one of those
guys where you point to a perfect example

230
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:57,400
of a guy whose body just was not allowing
him to compete at one 55 he's an,

231
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,320
he's a fucking animal in his mind. I mean
he, no one works harder than that guy.

232
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:05,150
You've seen that guy trained, but
yes, I have you seen in person, right?

233
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,210
This monster.
However,

234
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:12,100
how about he's fighting Colby Covington
in Brazil and Brazil. Troy that Colby,

235
00:13:12,101 --> 00:13:13,780
good luck. Call me. Good God.

236
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,110
Security security to
super hard to take down.

237
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,630
Real hard to take down and pour rootle
leg kicks and I don't know. He said,

238
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,600
well I fucking what? 90 minute but
video he's been doing every day,

239
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,360
but his legs are gigantic.
Grumpy,

240
00:13:28,361 --> 00:13:32,770
romp that Brazilian shit
or on of his chest. He,

241
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:35,470
I don't know what squats,
front squats, dude,

242
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:37,120
I don't know what kind
of crazy shit he's doing.

243
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,880
I know he did some training
in the past a lot with nick.

244
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,870
Curse on at a speed of sport. Nick
helped him quite a bit. Nicks,

245
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:48,250
you know that Marvin Marinovich a disciple
and he does all that crazy shit that

246
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:51,940
Marv had. Bj doing. He was doing, he's
got a ton of videos online though.

247
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,990
Is he working with Perello? Jason
Parillo? Yeah. I don't know.

248
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:59,300
Is they still Sanchez and PR?
I got to think Ese. I remember,

249
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,340
I remember seeing him at the Ruca.
Jason Parillo the greatest coach of all.

250
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,720
Like he's like, you're having
problems with your career, come here.

251
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,400
And just being cyborg. I mean just
these monsters and you know what?

252
00:14:09,401 --> 00:14:13,090
Good Dude,
great gun and doesn't want the spotlight.

253
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,450
You doesn't want to be out on camera.
Doesn't want anything done.

254
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,110
When I was telling him, I think he's
doing a great job, dude. Shakes your hand.

255
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,590
Looks you in the eye. Like he's right
there. He's right there. Thank you.

256
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,830
He's like write to anyone won't
work with just tenure either,

257
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,860
which is what I like.

258
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,790
I like what he did with Bisping help
Bisbing a lot became world champion. Yeah.

259
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:35,170
I mean he's, he's a fucking great code.
Back to Khabib. You know who I think,

260
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,030
and I'm not just saying this
because he's my boy of known for it,

261
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,120
but you knew who I think
could be his Achilles heel.

262
00:14:40,121 --> 00:14:43,060
Who matches up better with them than
anyone who everyone's overlooking.

263
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:45,880
Brian Ortega. Ooh, that's a good point.

264
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,320
Brian would take is a big dude at 55 easy
weight cut for him and let him on the

265
00:14:50,321 --> 00:14:53,930
ground on the ground. He's
the most dangerous guy in
the world right now. Yeah,

266
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,560
I think so too. I think the way he locks
up submissions, it's very different.

267
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:01,100
It's like if everybody else is hitting
it at a seven or an eight or take is

268
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:03,560
hitting a 10 where you watch and you go,
oh,

269
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:06,510
that's different and you haven't seen it.
So for could be who he's,

270
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,770
how long he's grappled fricking
grizzly bears since he was four.

271
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,910
He and he's seen Sabo, he seen black
belt Jujitsu, he's seen all this stuff.

272
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:15,610
You're not going to catch
them with Ortega take,

273
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:18,770
it's a little different and he actually
encourages you to go with the ground and

274
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,350
he's, he's dangerous on his feet,
but on the grounds where he thrives,

275
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,920
isn't it funny how that thing about going
to the ground, what does a bride says?

276
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,180
Tag wrote for the record.

277
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:28,880
Dana called me yesterday to see if I
had stepping against Khabib since Max

278
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,290
hadn't responded yet.
I said yes.

279
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,320
Eventually Max Supply and
Gay Dana gave him the fight.

280
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:38,000
If all goes according to plan, I'll get
my turn at both of them. Whoo. To Phnom,

281
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:42,440
no fight, fire. But just
stylistically I own it. And if
I'm could be, could be goes,

282
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,090
why would I fight our taste?
Phenomenal fighter.

283
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:47,190
But he didn't have a belt in a big name
and it's the most dangerous site form I

284
00:15:47,191 --> 00:15:50,210
think. And it's, it's also mean or tag,

285
00:15:50,211 --> 00:15:53,200
it became a much bigger star
with the Frankie Edgar knockout,

286
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,230
much bigger star but is a ways to go.
Yeah.

287
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,240
Max Holloway is one of the
best fighters on the planet.

288
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,390
That's a really interesting fight.
Tor or take has got,

289
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,990
there's something about his Jujitsu man.
It's like it's on,

290
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,220
it just ramped up and
sharpened down to like such a,

291
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:14,540
just a razor's edge man.
When he grabs a hold of stuff you like,

292
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:17,070
you have very little room to get out,
you know,

293
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:20,600
and he sets it up from the clinch and
it's a very unconventional and the head

294
00:16:20,601 --> 00:16:23,210
snap switch or like Tony Ferguson and
the dark jokes where he scene, you know,

295
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:27,830
snap city. However, why I wanted
to see him. This Ferguson,

296
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:31,940
Khabib fight with the snap city is
like Josh Thomson Fitch or like, oh no,

297
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,410
we've never seen could be because his
neck snapped down ever that it's for him.

298
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:39,560
It's a pride thing. Grown up where he
grew up there. No one snaps his neck down.

299
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:42,210
He'd known snapping them down.
It doesn't work.

300
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,120
Well that's Tony Steam.
They go watch, watch.

301
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,370
No one's ever snap at his neck down.
Avar wow. Yeah. That's so crazy.

302
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:54,870
I've never seen him lose around like why?
What are we doing?

303
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,060
These goddamn legends is people like
this and I'm drinking the Koolaid.

304
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm drinking it too. I'm so
into this coalition. Well,

305
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,280
wear that hat Saturday night. So
yeah. Damn. I'm, I'm fascinated.

306
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,660
I'm fascinated by this fight.

307
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:12,120
I'm always fascinated when could be fights
because you're always wondering like,

308
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,440
what's the first guy that's going to be
able to give him something different?

309
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,930
See, I look at it different.
I look at like, all right,

310
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:21,850
I hear all this crazy talk about could
be, let's see it. Like, I wanna see,

311
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,610
I wanna see that pound for
pound greatness out of them.

312
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,250
Let me get it when you don't, you think
you saw it in the Barboza fighting? No.

313
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,360
I think Barboza is one dimensional.
I think, uh, I think we did see,

314
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,660
and I think people are taken for granted
how good could be both a grappler is,

315
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:38,450
cause you talked to Frankie
talked to Eddie Alvarez. I go,

316
00:17:38,451 --> 00:17:40,850
how hard is it take down Barboza they go,
oh,

317
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,620
it's damn near impossible and training.

318
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,490
Like we don't get them down very easily
and they're bad asses. Right? So you'll,

319
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,810
what could be did we didn't
think he was gonna be able to do.

320
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:50,850
And if you look at that third
round with Barboza is like,

321
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,080
he gets taken down and he's like kind
of cage crawl and you look at his face,

322
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,620
he looks like,
get me the fuck out of here.

323
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,500
Like there's sheer panic and that's the
difference during could beam and the

324
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:02,340
rest of these fighters.

325
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,310
That's why it's the worst of fight them
on short notice because it's not going

326
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:09,560
to be fast. You know, it's not going
to be fun for you. It's a smashing it.

327
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,530
I feel like the brightening, we've seen
the pound for pound greatness in him,

328
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:17,820
like the potential for it, but we need to
see him against pound for pound greats.

329
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,880
Well that's how you get get there.
But show up Connor Aldo. Right,

330
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:27,450
right. That quick knockout
or DC Gustin Jon Jones, DC,

331
00:18:27,451 --> 00:18:30,990
like there are certain times in your
career where you have the signature wins.

332
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:33,090
He doesn't have a
signature win. Right. Well,

333
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,190
I think the Barboza is
as close as you can get,

334
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,550
but Barbara was his lost to
a few guys. He lost it. Tony.

335
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,560
He got dark choked and
plus cowboy. Yup. Yup.

336
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:45,240
But he's also very one dimensional.
Yeah. Phenomenal on the ground.

337
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,040
He's a good anti wrestler. His striking
is phenomenal, but overall package.

338
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,020
Yeah. And that, that is
the difference, right.

339
00:18:52,021 --> 00:18:55,440
Is the really good guys always
threatened takedowns always threatened

340
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:57,090
submissions.
He just doesn't do that.

341
00:18:57,310 --> 00:19:01,360
He stands up and he's a
specialist standup, but I mean,

342
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,350
standup is wicked and he's got some of
the best stand up in the world for sure.

343
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,650
Uh, in MMA. I mean Barboza
so fast to such a wonder boy.

344
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,280
Barboza the write up there during until,
yeah,

345
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:15,480
Darren till in Wonderboy is
going to be a mother fucker.

346
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,870
How about wonder boy?
I saw a quote coming in here we goes,

347
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:21,570
who's been not that impressive?
Dare until who is he? I'm like,

348
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,020
did you learn nothing from the cowboy
fight? Even I learned from that.

349
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,390
I talked to you. I was like,
man, why would cowboy take this?

350
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,070
I don't really know who Darren till is.

351
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:33,420
And then my inbox just flooded with shit
and even did until went off on me and I

352
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:36,150
look at my like, oh my God, this
guy's a monster. He's an animal,

353
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,690
doesn't have a gorilla
tattoo or something. Does he?

354
00:19:39,691 --> 00:19:44,030
He's got gorillas all over is like uses
it and his screen name and Twitter. Well,

355
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:47,980
he's a gorilla. He's a girl ever pool
group. Gorilla is a bad motherfucker.

356
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,440
Wonderboy who's rehabbing is thumps and
it's just like, alright, if you want this,

357
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,320
and then what happens if one,
let's say Wonderboy were to win,

358
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,660
which I don't think he is unfortunately.

359
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:00,390
Let's say I don't you think I'm on the
sales till you get them? I just, yeah,

360
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:04,450
I think there's this kind of Darren till
decried a little bit right now. Ron,

361
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:09,590
hard Dick Riding on Khabib till there's
a few guys DC always Conroy's always

362
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:17,370
Brian or Tayga. I did ride
mighty mouse for sure. Yeah,

363
00:20:17,371 --> 00:20:20,520
you do dick ride that guy.
I think he's been that way forever.

364
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:25,530
I think he's the best. I mean, that's
fair. He needs a guy is a challenge him.

365
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,450
Is He fighting? So Hutto again. Who I
love so who don't, but it's like that.

366
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,430
Do you guys hate fucking money?
That shit's ridiculous. I mean,

367
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:36,750
so who knows a beast? No doubt about
it. And I love what, so who did, uh,

368
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:40,170
against uh, Wilson Hayes. I was like,
Holy Shit. There's like a different,

369
00:20:40,171 --> 00:20:42,690
so who does it looks like a karate
champion. Yeah, I get all that.

370
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,270
Did you see what mighty mouse did? He
went right through him. Oh, you, oh,

371
00:20:46,271 --> 00:20:50,080
you're black belt. Cool. Jewish on bar and
bar. And what he did to, so who does, oh,

372
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:53,740
you like to clinch. Check these out to
take all the Olympics. That's very cool.

373
00:20:53,741 --> 00:20:58,480
Check this knee. Ouncer needs the
body as fat. I grabbed him once.

374
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:01,930
Just joking around. Plan. He hit me
in the body with a niece so fast.

375
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,760
He was confusing. It was a confused.
Where'd that come from? Like I go, I go,

376
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,790
I got ya. He turns out, hey man,

377
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:14,140
that's not supposed to go that quick
like this supposed to be. I see you move.

378
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,220
I get to think that this might come my
way. Here it is. No, it was already there.

379
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:22,500
I realized he was doing it.
He's so fucking fast. Why did,

380
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,900
do we know why the TJ fights aren't
going down? Dude? I don't know,

381
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:29,740
but that one bums me
out. That one. That is a,

382
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,510
that's a fucking gigantic super fight.
Like why wouldn't he take that fight?

383
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:38,140
Well, first of all, mighty mouse right
now is rehabbing a shoulder surgery,

384
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,650
so it's going to be a while. He was
doing those, you know that both thing.

385
00:21:41,651 --> 00:21:42,790
They do that flexy thing.

386
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,820
He was doing some of those exercises
the other day on Instagram.

387
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:48,100
I'm looking at him like, okay,
that's a guy that's got like,

388
00:21:48,101 --> 00:21:51,460
he's got some scar tissue to work out.
Like that's not, that's not healed up.

389
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:52,600
Did he get surgery or no?
Yeah,

390
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:56,350
he got surgery so he's out for a little
bit and Tj probably doesn't want to wait.

391
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,610
I don't know if that's what the case is.
I don't know what the case is.

392
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,190
You know I mean shoulder surgery, six
months. I mean, so you wait three months,

393
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,220
then you have a three month camp,
you know?

394
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,470
I mean if they wouldn't announce it yet,
right. No, I mean I don't even know.

395
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,730
You can't even say that
because teachers have to go on,

396
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,790
you might not be able to go if you,

397
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,400
Matt Hume and mighty mouse are about
as smart as it gets when it comes to

398
00:22:18,401 --> 00:22:19,234
preparation.

399
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:22,840
So there's no way they would take that
fight of his shoulder wasn't 100% or any

400
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,230
fight and risk his legacy because he
loses that fight and was like told Ya and

401
00:22:26,231 --> 00:22:29,860
they wouldn't go hard early to test it.
They would let it.

402
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,570
We'll look at Willie's been out a little
bit because of his shoulder. Yeah,

403
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,490
he was in here like right after he got it.
He said he's going to heal up quick.

404
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:44,740
Yeah. And he might PRP all that.
Yeah. He's going to do all the PRP. A,

405
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:48,100
you know this as much different therapies.

406
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,550
Cryo I'm sure it was probably still
takes a while even with all our advanced

407
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:54,730
stem cell, but not now.
He's forced to fight and I,

408
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,330
I see what the UFC is doing
where they do interim belt.

409
00:22:57,331 --> 00:23:01,150
Tween Colbian dos Anjos
where the interim belt.

410
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,990
So now Woodley, you literally
have to fight the winner of this.

411
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,450
Do you have to fight them?
It's a very sneaky may have a belt.

412
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,060
What are you gonna do you want a
super fight? Nope. This guy's a belt.

413
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,570
I get both sides here.
If it stills Angeles,

414
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,080
Los Angeles Beats Colby dos Santos,
lightweight champion,

415
00:23:17,081 --> 00:23:20,260
now welterweight champion.
But to me it takes me right.

416
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,460
Dos Anjos sitting there with
two belts on shoulders. I mean,

417
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:27,340
and then what do you do with Dan until
let's say he, for whatever reason,

418
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:30,760
walks through Wonderboy, which
is, you know, tough to do,

419
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:33,550
but to say walks through it, which would
lead, you know, struggled a little bit,

420
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,710
walks through them and one of boys,

421
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:39,500
the number one guy not there until jumps
up to number one or his dose central

422
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,790
work that way because the
ratings are fucking screwy, man.

423
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,980
Sometimes I see a guy who,

424
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,860
a guy and then the guy who he
beat is still ranked ahead of him.

425
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,280
They're a nightmare. All they
are, all the ratings do now.

426
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,610
It almost hurts if you're a guy like
Sean Shelby or Dana trying to make these

427
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:59,180
matchups cause guy who's at
fourth year, hey, wanting to
fight seven. He's like, no,

428
00:23:59,181 --> 00:24:01,790
he's seven. I have nothing to gain
from that. Where before it was like,

429
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,450
he wants you to fight this guy. He's a
name, he's on some fight, win streak.

430
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,110
We don't know what ranking is,
but we know he's damn good. Right.

431
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,300
So you guys were more willing to
take it now they, nope, he's seven.

432
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:15,620
What I want a number one. Exactly right.
I need three, four, you know? Yeah,

433
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,610
that's weird. It hurts us. That's
also weird. Like the UFC could just,

434
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,640
did they just decide who's fighting?
I mean, it's the whole thing.

435
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,470
The business is so interesting because
it's like they decide who's fighting.

436
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:30,260
They decide who's champion. They decide,
Tony, you're not champion anymore.

437
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,770
I'm going to strip yet.
It's like put it, I fell.

438
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,110
I don't want this to happen. Fox
Studios, I just do, I twist my knee.

439
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,830
But he was working for the UFC when
he fell. I mean, he's doing his,

440
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,620
his obligations,
his press obligated.

441
00:24:45,621 --> 00:24:48,680
It's very strange to strip them
of a belt when he never lost it.

442
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:52,370
And he the longest winning
streak and then and mean.

443
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,590
But also you has no belt can
because there's no belt can be,

444
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,810
was going to take the belt.
They're gonna make up a belt.

445
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,970
And then Connor has the belt at 55
so what do you do with that belt?

446
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,250
Well what they're planning on doing,
I believe,

447
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,760
and now they've kind of let the cat out
of the bag because they said it's going

448
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,030
to be for the world lightweight title.

449
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:12,650
They were going to strip Connor the
moment something happened like the moment

450
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:15,770
the fight started. That's when they
were going to trip Connor. Yeah,

451
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,230
because if they'd stripped him beforehand,

452
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,290
then what happens if Tony doesn't
make weight or something totally mix.

453
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,560
They with cope out of
Khabib doesn't make weight.

454
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,930
Then what the fuck do you check concern?
They didn't have nothing.

455
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,090
I mean you already stripped him.
We're going to give it back to him.

456
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,730
I'm going to give it back to him now.
If he wants to fight again now,

457
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,580
he's not the champ anymore.
The fuck kind of Shit is strange.

458
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,380
So they waited and the idea was to wait,

459
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:39,540
but now they're in a desperado situation.
Strange Desperado

460
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,960
that'll yet fucking April fool's.
April fool's day, it happens.

461
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,660
I didn't believe a God damn word of it.
Jimmy Smith's starts texting me. I'm like,

462
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:50,540
fuck that dude. I'm not falling
for it. Jamie texted me. I'm like,

463
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:55,280
I'm not falling for it. You texted me, you
go, Bro, it's April fools. I'm like, no.

464
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,110
But Dana, I sent dated, released
a video and he's listening.

465
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,940
I'm sure he likes a
good April fool's joke,

466
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:05,240
but what he likes more his money and
pay per view buys. You can't honey dick.

467
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:09,080
The fans are like psych. It's back
on. People are going to be pissed.

468
00:26:09,081 --> 00:26:12,170
And that's a good point. I
didn't buy it. I still was like,

469
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,850
maybe it's just an elaborate PR scam.

470
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:16,250
I didn't even tweet about it
until the next day. I know.

471
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:18,620
I was tweeting about other shed.
People were like, what the fuck, Bro?

472
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,920
This is go down. You're not even tweeting
them out. And I'm like, I'm not, I'm not,

473
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:25,550
I'm not gonna do it. I'm, I check it. I
checked with you. And then I checked with,

474
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:30,130
uh, Josh Thompson who works closely
with, uh, could be, and then I,

475
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,860
so boom, there's my two main guys.
And I went, all right, Ariel,

476
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:37,520
that's all aerial tweet. I'm like,
God, he's like journalist. I'm a,

477
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,380
I'm an ass clown. He's a legit
journalist. Like he has the credibility.

478
00:26:43,381 --> 00:26:46,890
So I went, Bro, is this really
goes, I would never joke
around like that. Brennan.

479
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,270
I'm like, he's right. Well, I went
straight to his Jujitsu coach.

480
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:53,930
I called Eddie, talked to
him on the phone. Yeah.

481
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,710
So an Eddie gave me the full
rundown of what happened with Tony.

482
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,660
It's like he saw somebody and
he turned to say hi to somebody,

483
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,530
didn't see some wires on the ground,

484
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,260
tripped over some wires
and just blew his shit out.

485
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,730
And Eddie was on the podcast yesterday
and Eddie was saying that Tony wanted to

486
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:15,660
fight or day before yesterday. Tony wanted
to fight. They wouldn't let him fight.

487
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,430
Yeah. His, his ligament is torn
LCL around the bone, which is rare,

488
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:24,810
which is hard to do. I don't want, where's
that one? Lateral, lateral, whatever.

489
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,220
Collateral Ligament, some shit.
Anyways. But do you think,
uh, it would, uh, if, if,

490
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,810
if it went tripping off that,

491
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:33,600
is that a freak accident or do you think
it would have went during the fight?

492
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,010
It's hard to say. Oh, I bet it was a
freak accident, right. To associate LCL.

493
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,110
I mean the way they said it, but first
of all with Dana said was very savage.

494
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,870
What'd he say? Dana said,
uh, he wears her sunglasses,

495
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,660
indoors doors that should happen to
everybody that wears sunglasses indoors.

496
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,290
That's the Larry David, the
light of your glory, David quote.

497
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,020
Cause there's only two types of
people that wear sunglasses indoors.

498
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,280
Blind people and assholes.
It's true. It's so true.

499
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,420
It's so weird thing man.
Especially at night,

500
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:10,050
like what are you doing so hard to see?
What does this, what are you doing?

501
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,450
I've seen a guy in a club
when I used to go to clubs,

502
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,220
he does his glasses on and
then people walk, laid,

503
00:28:14,221 --> 00:28:16,740
lift them up to look around and put
it back down and you can't see shit.

504
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,570
The biggest tools where glass assist to
fights and wear sunglasses and they sit

505
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:25,020
there with her fucking sunglasses. Not
like, especially celebrities that do that.

506
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,180
It's like flurries do it. It's like
get it, get a grip however we meet.

507
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,480
That's like when you know you fucked up,
you got two famous,

508
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:34,100
you have to wear sunglasses at a
fight that sit in the front row.

509
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,350
It's Sunglass and your boys are
just like, no, I like it man. Yeah,

510
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,190
we're those indoors.
That makes complete sense.

511
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,430
It same if you were like a peacock coat
and your boys like, that's all good.

512
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:45,410
I'm gonna Start Doing podcasts.
Like that stresses me out for now.

513
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,980
That stresses me out. Sam. We did
a podcast like this. Did you say,

514
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,800
what did you say something to him like
what are we doing? And I put mine on,

515
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,660
I put mine on and we, we've done it before
with the sunglasses with NASA outfits.

516
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,830
That's hilarious. Deleted. Did our put,
did the fight and the kid with sunglasses.

517
00:29:01,831 --> 00:29:04,380
I don't. I go, Bro, you got to
take the sunglasses off. He goes,

518
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,160
my future's too bright.
Oh fuck mine too.

519
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,800
And the calendars. Shit. I'll have my
sunglasses. Yeah. It's a weird thing.

520
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:18,270
Sunglasses. That's a hilarious quote by
Dana though. Yeah. Hilarious. Hilarious.

521
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,470
And especially considering how much money
he's losing on this. Can you imagine?

522
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,030
Can you imagine getting a call
that close and be like, what?

523
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:31,140
What keeps happening? It keeps
happening. It keeps happening.

524
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,300
Does it tap into this Mac
temps typing a bunch of times?

525
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:38,820
Just one limb and may God to like you
morons. I'm trying to do you a favor.

526
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,860
Who was the most recent
one where that happened?

527
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,340
Where cyborg stepped in last minute.
This close. Yeah, so the last one,

528
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,440
Cyborg stepped in. Who? Oh, that was Max
Holloway. Max Holloway. Frankie acres.

529
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,360
But then there was the Ferguson one with
Khabib where Khabib's liver shutdown.

530
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,280
They had to take him to the
fucking hospital. It was a bummer.

531
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,590
That was a bummer because this
happened a ton of times though.

532
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,550
It was the worst one.

533
00:30:00,551 --> 00:30:05,551
Jon Jones do UFC 200 DC where the
right literally the day before.

534
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,320
You're like,
what?

535
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,470
But I would if that's better for
the UFC shitty business either way,

536
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,500
but is it better for the UFC because
people we've waste seen the hype or a

537
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:19,210
bought in and then like the next day like
what the f where's John like, oh yeah,

538
00:30:19,211 --> 00:30:20,170
you didn't hear that.
Like,

539
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:24,580
does that help them more or does this
week at least app can promote a little bit

540
00:30:24,581 --> 00:30:25,330
with Max Holloway,

541
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:28,960
you could promote a little bit with Max
Holloway and it's an interesting fight.

542
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,090
It's a very interesting fight.
Yeah.

543
00:30:31,091 --> 00:30:33,850
There's a lot of those men that
happened to you. Like what?

544
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,490
Which one was the Jon Jones DC one.
UFC 200 and that,

545
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,330
what was the thing that John did? Which
one was that? Remember that the coq one B,

546
00:30:43,331 --> 00:30:47,170
I think there was a coke when coke
was, he goes, this was dick pills.

547
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,660
You remember these? He was
like, Hey, we got strip up.

548
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,020
We had to pull them from the card
and then DC fight dash and Silva.

549
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,610
That's right on like [inaudible] Anderson
and then DC didn't winning fans that

550
00:30:57,611 --> 00:31:02,230
cause he just kind of, yeah. Yeah. He just
waits. Fight. He just wrestled him in his,

551
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,690
whatever. It's still one the
front kicked him in the gut too.

552
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:08,740
And I think you heard him.
He has messed up. Yeah.

553
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,700
But it happens in sports. This, this is
what I think makes fighting so great.

554
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,451
So great.

555
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:16,690
Max has an opportunity that no one
else in the world in sports can have.

556
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,550
And then, you know, then look at Canelo
triple g. It's in, in combat sports.

557
00:31:21,551 --> 00:31:24,310
This is what we deal with. Yeah. Canela
it's a biggest fight of the year.

558
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,330
Biggest fight ever wants to see the
rematch of the year and then tainted meat.

559
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,300
Do you buy the tainted
meat? Absolutely not, sir.

560
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,510
I've had many Tacos in Mexico
and I am not swell. Yeah,

561
00:31:34,511 --> 00:31:38,950
but you're not getting tested for trace
amounts of Clenbuterol. You don't know.

562
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,440
Maybe I have to go and Snitch,
come to my house just for the fuck of it.

563
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:48,760
And just dripping. I'm still
in the testing protocol.
Interesting. No, I, yeah, maybe.

564
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:52,810
I don't know. But I would see some sort
of change. But even triple g's camp goes,

565
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,740
uh, last fight. He was on it. What
else is new now? Why didn't your book,

566
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,950
why do you think they said that?
He, I don't know. I'm sure. Listen,

567
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:04,420
I'm sure Gonad has been in there with
what? Over 500 people now. 400 people.

568
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:09,280
And you just said in his experience he
can tell who's on pds and who's not.

569
00:32:09,281 --> 00:32:13,390
And he thought Canelo was,
do you buy that?

570
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,720
I do cause that a fighter as a fighter.

571
00:32:16,721 --> 00:32:20,880
This guys I fought who I assumed were
okay, but what about Woodley Woodley?

572
00:32:20,881 --> 00:32:24,760
He has tremendous genetic. He's always
been like that. Always been like that.

573
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,050
But so it was Kanella no you, you look
at it, he's gotten pretty swollen now.

574
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:31,090
He's getting older though.
So it could be that too.

575
00:32:31,091 --> 00:32:34,840
He's just as you get older you but I'm
more size. Well the big one was Manny.

576
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,050
Manny was the one that everybody was
always accusing and man he was the first,

577
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,760
I mean Manny went up eight weight classes
and kept his knockout piece fighting

578
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,270
as a little boy and then just was like
crazy. I mean and kept the knockout power.

579
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,500
True. And most people thought
that man he was on ped. Correct.

580
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,200
And then they thought that that man had
got off p ds when he fought Juan Manuel

581
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,980
Marquez and he got starched. But there's
two, there's two side of the story there.

582
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:00,680
He got off PDS and also
found Jesus Christ.

583
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,920
So he stopped going to the Strip clubs.
He stopped hanging out with girls,

584
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:08,060
but he stopped having fun and then got
serious about Jesus and got knocked the

585
00:33:08,061 --> 00:33:11,660
fuck out. Yeah, Jeannie saw Jesus
and that Jesus is like, listen,

586
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,690
if you want to be a savage, you got
to live like a savage. He's like,

587
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:17,540
I'm not even advising this man.
Do your thing.

588
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:22,160
Can I go take them steroids? It's
like, listen, I made steroids. Okay,

589
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,470
I'm Cara run God. That wheat grass
ain't going to help your son.

590
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,570
That's good for you, but you
need good, but you need this too.

591
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,750
It depends on what you are. I mean, if
you want to be 147 pound knockout artist,

592
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,300
but Marquez is no stranger to the,
uh, not just getting supplements. No,

593
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,190
no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Well, his,

594
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,840
they had the same strength and
conditioning coach when Manny found Jesus,

595
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:51,560
his old strength and conditioning
coach went over to the doctor,

596
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,130
wet mat warm and Mel Marcus, he's always
on the dark state on the dark side.

597
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,900
That dude was always in the dark.
What was he going now? He blinks Alex.

598
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:03,710
Alex. Oh, Riza. Yes. Good call
brother. Yeah, he knows his shit, man.

599
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,730
He knows his shit and I don't know
whether or not he'd got anybody on ped,

600
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:07,760
so they're just blaming him.

601
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,610
He knows his shit is a strength and
conditioning coach. That guy's very,

602
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:12,380
very good. I would have worked
with them if I was sweating.

603
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,900
I saw the stuff that he was doing
with wine. My Mom Marquez, I was like,

604
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,520
this guy's,
he's super legit.

605
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,700
And he brings those guys up to
like modern levels are correct.

606
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,480
Not The old school shit. It's some
of the old school shit to this day.

607
00:34:23,481 --> 00:34:27,140
I think chopping wood, that's all
legit man. Sledge hammers on tires.

608
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:29,360
I think it was good. And I agree.
I think it's good to add in.

609
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,040
I think dead lifts all that stuff.

610
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,420
But I think you mix that with the new wave
of technology. Now you got some, well,

611
00:34:35,421 --> 00:34:38,690
what, what I was saying about nick curse
on and that Marvin Marinovich method,

612
00:34:38,691 --> 00:34:43,310
it's all, it's playas man. Everything's
like junk box jumps and movement. Yeah,

613
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:46,220
left right. Left, right, left,
right. You know, curse on sits on.

614
00:34:46,221 --> 00:34:49,100
Very interesting to me when I said like,
what do you think fighters are missing?

615
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:52,940
Most like strength condition wants to
that foot strength. That makes sense.

616
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,500
Totally makes sense.
You know who's,

617
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,620
who's been on that ball since God
since I've known him as Lauren Landau,

618
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,710
who I worked with in Denver and
now he just got the Gig as the,

619
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:03,910
he's the head condition coach
of the Denver Broncos. Wow.

620
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:08,000
But he was making us work out barefoot
for Avar even as football players.

621
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,410
Steve Maxwell was always on that too.
I was kettle bell workouts,

622
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,310
those guys who it's like,
oh, this is all new.

623
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,440
And then you talked to like a
Lauren or that Max will gather. Uh,

624
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,020
we've been doing this for like 20 years.

625
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,860
You guys are just now finding out about
it. Well, so many people, you know,

626
00:35:21,861 --> 00:35:26,390
you see so many people working out with
like high thick ass running shoes that

627
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:29,960
are all spongy on the bottom. Yeah. It'd
be one of them. Yeah. A lot of people do.

628
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,860
But you're not training for a fight
right now? No. No. But if you were,

629
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,290
you tried to optimize
everything wouldn't you? Yeah,

630
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:38,390
I used to wear those five finger

631
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:41,250
to, I'd wear those to run, I'd
wear those on the track had,

632
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,410
were those during most of my stuff.

633
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,070
So now you just wear regular running
shoes for comfort, regular running shoes.

634
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,560
And then w I had a knee prompt,

635
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:51,060
I was putting so many miles on
it and now I'm on a bike. I got,

636
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,900
I got one of Pelotons so those are dope.
But it's, it's been good. Those uh,

637
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,800
it's good because it's, you could play
along and go along with the class. Yeah,

638
00:35:58,801 --> 00:36:02,340
it's cool. I don't know if it's the answer
do every day, but I like you, I need,

639
00:36:02,341 --> 00:36:05,430
I need to mix it up man. I'm getting,
I'm just bored as fuck with working out.

640
00:36:05,431 --> 00:36:09,060
So Deco bike, those are dope. I want
to get one of those in the crib.

641
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:09,770
Got Our callbacks,

642
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,690
but I like to waking up cause my
Mondays and Tuesdays are a nightmare.

643
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,350
I have to be on set at 7:00 AM so I'm
waking up at like five just doing that

644
00:36:16,351 --> 00:36:18,720
Pelton for an hour if that I'm
off. Oh, that's good. Yeah,

645
00:36:18,721 --> 00:36:21,750
we're before I'd have to try and go
to the gym. I was missing my workouts.

646
00:36:21,751 --> 00:36:22,830
It drives me nuts,
dude.

647
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:25,890
He helped to start the day with
a sweat and then I get going.

648
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,150
You know what kicked him on the
versaclimber. Those are a nightmare.

649
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,420
I went to the gym the other
day and I did 150 meter sprint.

650
00:36:33,421 --> 00:36:34,440
At the end of the workout,

651
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:37,140
the trainer had me do 150 meter
sprint on their first climb.

652
00:36:37,141 --> 00:36:41,640
I feel like passing out. Holy Shit. It's
hard. Holy Shit. When you get off man,

653
00:36:41,641 --> 00:36:44,880
like you're barely older on before.
Yeah, but I haven't been doing it now.

654
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,860
I'm getting one in here now.
I May.

655
00:36:46,861 --> 00:36:50,520
It might be the toughest thing as far
as cardio wise. Again, Loren Landow,

656
00:36:50,521 --> 00:36:53,670
you still have even as football
players all the time, and I was like,

657
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:57,240
what the fuck are we doing
man? This is awful. Is by far.

658
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,630
He'd have these circuits and it always
end on that. I remember everyone,

659
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,850
if he's like, here's your
circuit, then you ended on versa.

660
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:06,990
Some of the best athletes in the
world, just like, oh my God, man,

661
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,410
what are we doing? Yeah, but
that's what they do with this.

662
00:37:09,411 --> 00:37:12,660
This gym that I've been working at, he
likes you to do a circuit in the circuit.

663
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,880
You get on the versa climber
and you sprint and it's,

664
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:17,220
you know how much time
to get to 150 meters.

665
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,100
I've been doing a rose with my trainer.
Oh yeah, I do that too. I do wrote,

666
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,790
we get a thousand meter row and I'm like,
what's a good time?

667
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,160
So we looked up the top times.
I'm like,

668
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,050
I think I'm top 300 in the
world right now. A bit. You
know, I got to do some work.

669
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:31,821
There's a big,
yeah,

670
00:37:31,821 --> 00:37:35,550
there's big difference between top 300
and then the top hundred. Yeah, but dude,

671
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:38,400
you're top 300 in the world with a
row. With a row. Yeah, look it up.

672
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:41,370
That's pretty fucking sweet.
It's all right. I mean,

673
00:37:41,371 --> 00:37:46,170
it's a row machine and the top
85 million. I mean, the hold up,

674
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:50,190
you're the, hold on, hold on. Let's just,
I would that, that was the humble brag,

675
00:37:50,191 --> 00:37:52,170
but let's just be serious here.
You're the,

676
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,080
you're the hardest kicker ever on
that Goddamn UFC machine. Well,

677
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,200
I call it the Francis Machine. Well, I,
there's a video of me doing 152 right.

678
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:03,810
Right now you only see the one that me
kicking it and with my jeans on and that

679
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:08,310
what got to one 35 stretchy jeans.
Yeah, barbell jeans. Basically. PDS.

680
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:11,640
PDS. Yeah. He's like sweatpants,
man. So I'm dude burned me,

681
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,340
burned me from the audience and he goes,
hey man,

682
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:17,670
how long did it take you to
paint on those genes? And I went,

683
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,360
oh my goodness sir,
you just scorched me.

684
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:26,100
Theo bunk did me dirty, brought weird
clown on each other. We'd call each other.

685
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,660
I said, you look like an extra
from the waterboy setting. He goes,

686
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,000
he goes, no, fuck. I'm like,
he goes, Bro, you like you,

687
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:40,810
you look like you work at Nordstrom's
rack and you're a mechanic. Like fuck.

688
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:46,540
He talking about. He's so good. He's
one thing, but that fucking pants man,

689
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:48,070
these pants are the shit.
These are different.

690
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:51,280
These right now I have on there similar,
they're called Mott and bow is a no,

691
00:38:51,281 --> 00:38:53,500
those are good company. Yeah,
those are like legit jeans.

692
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:57,010
They'd like more feel like jeans where
the barbell jeans are like they look like

693
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:59,590
jeans to touch them and I go, hey,
what's going on here? Like sweat,

694
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:03,110
sweat pants on Sun. No, those are,
that's it. A good company to Jacob.

695
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,780
Just so bind you up a little bit more.

696
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:08,110
If you were trying to kick
somebody a little bit more.
So what did you do though?

697
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:12,430
Record setting. Kickup barbell jeans.
This is the, I did the record on.

698
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:16,780
This is the record one. That dos
Anjos rump. Let's see. You saw my,

699
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:19,240
he'll run in man.
My ass is way bigger.

700
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
A lot of people have been
complimenting me on it.

701
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,630
Nothing wrong with a night off like that.
Fat Belly though. I'm so fat right now.

702
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,150
You are not fat for me.
One 52

703
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,370
and what's the hardest?
Definitely fatter than I usually am.

704
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,610
I been cheating on my died way too much.
I hear you man sheet and wait. You my,

705
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,000
well, it's also, I can't,

706
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:44,050
there's certain things I can't do in
the gym right now and I got this man,

707
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,970
this dildo that I got here.
Yeah. This is for, uh, you know,

708
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:53,890
I've Golfer's elbow. I have this
tendonitis on Heather. Fuck Dude.

709
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,740
I've never had tendinitis before.
Have you ever had it? Yeah. Not Fun.

710
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,920
It takes forever. Forever.
Like way more than a muscle.

711
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,990
I got PRP, I got Regena
keen, I got stem cells.

712
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,920
I had a bunch of shots.
This, this Dildo I'm holding.

713
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,790
This helped me more than any of them.
I only did two weeks in two weeks.

714
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:15,910
Is things helping dry needling? It did
seem like it should have fixed everything.

715
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,370
What did the dry needling?
Oh yeah.

716
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:24,270
I had dry needling where
they used electricity and
these zapped it and they get

717
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,020
pollster to do nothing for me. It
didn't help. This helped. This is cheap.

718
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:33,490
You buy it on Amazon. It's called the
theraband. And what do you do with it?

719
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:38,130
And my friend Brian told me about this.
Callan, no, no, no. Brian from, um,

720
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,720
I'll give you his last name. He's
Vinny shoreman, his buddy from Fontana,

721
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:46,630
California. I think.
What does this his thing,

722
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:51,590
double Deuce Moitai tie is that his,
uh, his place here? Hold on. Sorry.

723
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:55,330
It's a great shirt by the
way. Jamie, Brian Doppler. Um,

724
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:00,280
and Brian is a great Moitai coach himself.
So when he do,

725
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:02,920
he had, he had a issue and he told
me this is the thing that fixed him.

726
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,670
You take it, you hold it out like
this right in front of you, right.

727
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,750
Then you twist, this is the arm that's
injured, the bottom arm. So you hold out,

728
00:41:10,751 --> 00:41:12,100
you twist it,
what the other one,

729
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,630
and then you hold it straight and then
you let it untwist with this arm slowly.

730
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,210
And I've been doing this shit
all the time. I do it in my car,

731
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:20,650
I take it with me at home,

732
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,630
but I'm twisting the shit out of it and
then slowly untwisting it with my right

733
00:41:25,631 --> 00:41:28,960
side to helping out too.
And it makes a big impact.

734
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:33,590
It makes a big impact because it's
strengthening it, strengthening this,

735
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:36,340
this little particular area,
but it's also getting a ton of blow.

736
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,670
You hold it like that,

737
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,880
like palm palm out and then twist
it right and now straightened out.

738
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:47,710
Now unwind it with this hand
with the injured hand. There
you go. Just like, yeah,

739
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,050
and you just do that slow and
I'll do that for like five,

740
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:54,440
10 minutes at time and then I'll
leave it alone. Game Combat,

741
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,130
game changer dude.
A lot better.

742
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,560
I mean obviously I've had a
lot of other shit done to it.

743
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:04,490
Like the Regena keen was like uh,
might help a month or so ago.

744
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:05,870
I'm sure it helped,
but that's good.

745
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,000
This once I started doing it almost
immediately within a few days.

746
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:14,810
Sorry, feeling better basics
then. Yeah, but I can't,

747
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:17,480
there's a lot of shit I can't do.
Like I can't do chin ups right now.

748
00:42:17,481 --> 00:42:20,270
Have been able to do chin ups.
I could do rows,

749
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,940
but I can't go have you
then like 50 pounds.

750
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:28,330
Like everything has to be all about
preserving this little ligament and your

751
00:42:28,611 --> 00:42:32,120
trainer knows that. Yeah. As
a new trainer? Yeah. Yeah.

752
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:35,120
As long as they're a good trade, as they
usually know how to adapt. But even here,

753
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,050
like when I'm training here,

754
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,810
he can't do it with so much shit I can do
and can't do anything on the rings. No,

755
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:44,210
no. I can throw straight punches. Yup.
No, no hooks, uppercuts. But it's getting,

756
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,370
it's getting much better just in two
weeks of using this fucking thing,

757
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,410
thinking about resting it maybe
just not doing Amy thing sir. Hmm.

758
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,730
That's how I got fat. Well you could,
you could still get up. You're crazy.

759
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:00,680
You're crazy. For me to put together
a diet, so I have to add to uh,

760
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,010
have a meal specialist, like delivering
my meals on that guy right now.

761
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,960
I'm usually really good at it,
but,

762
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,500
but one thing this has done
is ramped up my hill running.

763
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,680
So I've been doing just go, oh, are
you the type of dude though? Well,

764
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,410
we see you late night. You're always
posting. You know, you get that Fedex.

765
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,270
I would see when Ph vet,

766
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,080
I see when a at night when you
come home from the comedy store,

767
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:22,370
you always posting like
protein and veggies.

768
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,840
Are you really eating
that or are you like,

769
00:43:23,841 --> 00:43:27,710
there's that and then you
have a Mcdonald's on the
side? I'm not saying Donald,

770
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,430
if I cheat, it's pasta have
to be lasting a whole pizza.

771
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:35,510
The other day I can give it up
Buller from, it was at a restaurant.

772
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,470
I worked with the, with the misses and
we ordered some other stuff and I said,

773
00:43:39,471 --> 00:43:41,990
let's just get a pizza too. Right?
That's how it's done. She's like,

774
00:43:41,991 --> 00:43:44,830
I'm not really into this. I'm like,
good for power. That's me, man.

775
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:47,890
I walked the whole pizza down eight,
that whole fucking,

776
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,410
I'm so disappointed in myself. I had
these, I had these meals. Man, I've,

777
00:43:51,411 --> 00:43:54,440
I've been strict on it. When I'm
on the road it's the fucking tough.

778
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,650
Or when if I might get in the sleep.
My buddy crave sugar and carbs,

779
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,800
but I always say, and
I'm like, I just want,

780
00:44:00,801 --> 00:44:05,530
and then one I just can't stop myself.
It's hard. And then last night my, my,

781
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,780
my son this pasta and of course I have
to try it and I'm gonna make sure it's

782
00:44:08,781 --> 00:44:10,120
not poisoned.
I tried,

783
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,630
I'm like that's fucking way better than
my meal that they eat so I just fired up

784
00:44:14,631 --> 00:44:17,270
some Tortellini.
It's hard.

785
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,590
It's also hard when you work hard
because I wore, I do a lot of things.

786
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:25,700
I'm always busy and it's like sometimes
it just want to go off with food.

787
00:44:25,701 --> 00:44:29,150
Like that's my indulgence. That's the
one thing that I can get loose on men,

788
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:33,300
but most of the time I'm
very strict most of the time.

789
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,540
But it's been hard with this injury it
just because I thought it was going to be

790
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,970
healed by now so it's been frustrating.
The shit out of me.

791
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,470
There's certain things I want to do,

792
00:44:40,471 --> 00:44:45,471
like I was on this heavy chin up kick
and heavy cleans and presses kick and

793
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:50,790
that's probably where I want to do it
because I felt some twinges instead of

794
00:44:50,791 --> 00:44:53,970
just working on it and
like letting it heal up,

795
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,850
push through it for months.
That's the athlete in you.

796
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,200
That's the idiot in me for months. I
pushed it. But that's how it works.

797
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:03,810
When you're an athlete. I'm sure when
you're doing taekwondo or Jujitsu,

798
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,260
you get hurt. It's not like, oh, let
me take months off to make this bad.

799
00:45:07,261 --> 00:45:08,950
It's none of that. Yeah, that,

800
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:12,330
and that's what Eddie said about Tony is
it like Tony when he gets hurt and he's

801
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:15,150
like, whatever I'm hurt, just
works around it. Whatever it is.

802
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,110
He doesn't stop working out
ever, ever. Yeah. But this is a,

803
00:45:19,111 --> 00:45:24,000
an eyeopener for me. This, this theraband
thing is like always keep searching.

804
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:24,461
There's,
Oh,

805
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:27,060
and another thing I have is this other
thing that I put my fingers in this

806
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,260
rubber thing and I expand my fingers.
Right?

807
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,760
Because it's very difficult to expand.
You know, it's easy to contract,

808
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:35,550
you're always doing that.
But how much strength do you
have this way? Very little.

809
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:38,700
It's kind of shine. Do you ever
do it? Never. Never. Never.

810
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,610
But this rubber thing is
really good and I think I read,

811
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,760
I think it was Jim still panty,
who's a bodybuilder guy online.

812
00:45:44,761 --> 00:45:48,750
He's got a bunch of supplements and
shit. And, uh, he's uh, he's also super,

813
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:49,411
super smart,

814
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:53,160
educated guy and he was recommending
that for people with tendonitis.

815
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:57,570
There's a lot of different things you
could do with bands. And this one,

816
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:02,310
this is the strongest ones they have
to shaking like a Dick Rubber Dick.

817
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:05,190
Do you think if you would've
went to a physio therapy,

818
00:46:05,191 --> 00:46:07,950
they would have shown me all this stuff
before he injected yourself with all

819
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:12,500
these needles and stuff? I feel like that
a lot of it's physical maybe. Yeah. No,

820
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:16,440
you live, you learn. Most of them
were just saying ice it and rest.

821
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,740
It was like damn. Well the rest,
yes, but the rest of they want,

822
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:21,300
it's just not what I want to do.
Yeah.

823
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,830
Well it's also when your body is so used
to going hard and then going hard and

824
00:46:27,841 --> 00:46:32,470
then your body like, okay, let's find
some problem to kill us. It's still,

825
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,090
it's like one, I'm lazy and that
respect, they feel like a bitch.

826
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:41,820
I know, but like I said, it's increased
my Ba donk. Donk. Yeah. That's funny.

827
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:45,150
Oh Man. Dude, the missus likes it
or she wants you to turn it down.

828
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,630
She's happy with it. No one likes the
flat ass. No one likes vanilla guy. Yeah,

829
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,310
no one.
That might be the worst thing.

830
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:53,640
You feel flat and I want to grow a small
deck girl wants a flat ass cause she

831
00:46:53,641 --> 00:46:56,180
knows the guy is not going
anywhere. Correct. Yeah. Look,

832
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,310
look at him when it's flat.
Right.

833
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:03,920
Flat Ass fucking Shitty gene
loafers on Gucci Loafer.

834
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:08,580
Gucci loafers.
No socks gets tired.

835
00:47:08,581 --> 00:47:13,581
Walking upstairs to imagine if all of
a sudden you had someone's flat ass and

836
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:17,220
then you had to like walk around
and you gotta to realize, Oh my God,

837
00:47:17,221 --> 00:47:20,370
it's so hard to walk up hills.
How to get around,

838
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:24,690
get around flat out carrying up the
grocery bags up the stairs. That's out.

839
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:27,110
How about when you you,

840
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,940
I've seen it where it might one
of the easiest muscles to build.

841
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,810
Like there's some girls with flat asses.
Then you see them on Instagram.

842
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:38,320
These Instagram models who do like dead
lifts or something and then just over

843
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,890
time,
boom that ash grows like a tomato.

844
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,600
If they really are motivated, you can
get your ass to grow. Little Winnie,

845
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:49,690
little fucking little of that for sure.

846
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,140
There's a lot of that going on
with girls, man. When straws,

847
00:47:53,141 --> 00:47:55,270
what we're talking about folks who
don't know what [inaudible] I wasn't

848
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:58,800
referring to Winnie the Pooh. I'm
talking about when Straw. Yeah.

849
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,240
A lot of those fitness girls are doing
steroids. They just do a little bit,

850
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:05,720
just a little bit, just a little
bit changes in Moran Bit. The jaw.

851
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,110
You look at the shoulders,
they get manly anytime to anytime counts.

852
00:48:10,111 --> 00:48:14,730
He's a rip curl, use steroids and
literally everything. Steroids. My God.

853
00:48:14,731 --> 00:48:17,230
Damn Bro. They keep that
shit though. They keep it.

854
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:21,460
That's what's weird to keep the manly
parts like the like they don't just keep

855
00:48:21,461 --> 00:48:25,060
the muscles when they get off the shit.
If their face, it's still hard. Yeah.

856
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:27,490
They're structured like their face
structure's a little different.

857
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:28,720
As a lady who lives in my neighborhood,

858
00:48:28,721 --> 00:48:33,670
she used to be a big Ole Miss Olympia and
see her walking around and it's weird.

859
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:38,640
She's, she's, she's looks like a man.
Not just in her face, but in her, her,

860
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,740
the way she carries herself
everything. Right. So like, you know,

861
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:43,600
I mean that sounds weird to say,

862
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,830
but there's a certain masculine
quality that the, the people,

863
00:48:47,831 --> 00:48:51,490
the women that take massive
amounts of steroids, they develop.

864
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:56,020
They just develop the, they look
different. They will, they're wider. Yeah.

865
00:48:56,021 --> 00:49:00,310
They don't look like they're gonna take
care of you. You know what I'm saying?

866
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,270
I don't, I'm not attracted to that. I
don't know. Listen to each is sweet.

867
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:13,450
Then I can be the best moms. What
I'm saying, it's like, it's not,

868
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:17,860
that's a, that's a, that's even
bad. But it's, but if you want that,

869
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,120
I'll suck those career women will be
mad at you. Like if you want a soft,

870
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,770
if you want a soft, sweet,
caring woman who likes to cut on,

871
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:30,200
it's going to be a good mom and it's
just sweet to be around kind of.

872
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:33,400
You mean the opposite of us? Yeah. Yeah.

873
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,900
But a lot of career women will
get mad at you. I know that goes,

874
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:39,170
that's what you want. You want a woman
to just can't take care of her salary.

875
00:49:39,171 --> 00:49:43,150
You don't want it to be equal. No
badge. I Day Brian Callahan. I'm good.

876
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:46,540
I talked to a week, I'm Brian if I
wanted that. Well that equal stuff.

877
00:49:46,541 --> 00:49:50,500
It's like equal. How? How's how? Oh,
you just can't date your equal. You Go,

878
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,810
you go date some cartoon like all right,
okay.

879
00:49:52,811 --> 00:49:54,970
But they want to be a woman
in some respect. Right?

880
00:49:54,971 --> 00:49:55,721
They don't want to be an equal,

881
00:49:55,721 --> 00:50:00,721
they're not claiming they're
like is strong as you or
as funny as you or is know

882
00:50:01,151 --> 00:50:06,100
as much about pussy.
Good. Where are you equal?

883
00:50:06,101 --> 00:50:10,300
You're not an equal, you're a woman.
You're just, you're just an aggressive,

884
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,230
successful, powerful woman. But
cause you, but you're not a man.

885
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,840
Like if you were an equal,
I'd bigay correct.

886
00:50:16,841 --> 00:50:21,420
We'd be two dudes like high five
and in Buttfuck it together. Yeah,

887
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,990
that's fine. That's cool. But like this
whole one, an equal like why do we have,

888
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:29,060
why are we playing math games?
Yeah. Why can't we just be chill?

889
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:32,690
Can we just like each other? Why don't
we have to be equal? What is that?

890
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:37,400
I don't know.
It's weird when I have run from it.

891
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:39,410
He so successful. Who? Who? Who Was it?

892
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,440
Who said there can only be one headshot
and household and we heard that.

893
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,380
That's good though. You can only
have one head shot in the household.

894
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,630
It's not going to work out if you
both want to be famous. You know,

895
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:51,020
George Harrison once said,
he said, um, he said,

896
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,200
all I need from a woman
is to be attracted to her.

897
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:58,040
Everything else I get from
a man, it's like, wow,

898
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,460
we're going to get shit for that. Well,
what did you say that I didn't say? No,

899
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,640
I would never say that. I would
not either. I would. I knew with,

900
00:51:04,641 --> 00:51:08,270
I knew all that cool, equal,
equal, right. Equal pay,

901
00:51:08,271 --> 00:51:12,050
the rent a bitch and I need someone who
calls me on my shit and yells at me all

902
00:51:12,051 --> 00:51:15,910
the time and throws things
out and even makes fun of me.
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

903
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,730
That's what I want. That's exactly what
just comes home with a sick back then.

904
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:22,280
Rips a huge fart.
Like this female bodybuilder,

905
00:51:22,281 --> 00:51:26,630
Candace Armstrong steroid habit made
her grow a penis and facial hair. Whoa,

906
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:29,690
that's she's a dude.
Well, sure. That's real.

907
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:34,400
She's on that Gold's gym.
Dial. What? See the Dick?

908
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,980
Come on. Whoa. Oh Wow. Yeah. See
she turned into a man. Oh Wow.

909
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:43,910
And the heavy Whitehead. That's
a giant white. So white must've.

910
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,390
They must've put makeup on her too.
How are they letting that Whitehead go?

911
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:52,130
That staff, why wouldn't they cover
that up to she's so jack later hands.

912
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:56,150
Oh my God. Look at her arms to she
should [inaudible]. That's a dude.

913
00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:01,250
That's a dude. Come on. Is this a joke?
It was, might be a judge like criss angel.

914
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,170
She doesn't even look like Jack.
Yeah,

915
00:52:03,171 --> 00:52:06,200
but w the sides of her hands
looks proportionate to like,

916
00:52:06,201 --> 00:52:09,590
she doesn't look like a girl. Shit.
There's nothing feminine about that woman.

917
00:52:09,770 --> 00:52:13,690
Look at her back. Holy Shit. Look
at those back picks. Same Person.

918
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:17,280
Oh sure. Oh my God. That's photo shoot.

919
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:21,290
That's a dude with a nice set of here.
Well,

920
00:52:21,291 --> 00:52:23,660
some girls can be jacked and muscular,

921
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,390
but still look like a
woman like Felice Herrick.

922
00:52:26,391 --> 00:52:29,030
Do you see Felice Herricks
she's fighting this bodied,

923
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,470
but you see the picture her do
a double biceps from the back.

924
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,660
Some pictures she did it.
The UFC press thing,

925
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:37,940
you're like Cha tractive young lady.

926
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:42,200
There's a few who are jacked.
He would attract. She's jacked,

927
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,460
but she's Jack like a woman. She Jack
like a woman who lifts weights. Yeah.

928
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:49,070
It doesn't look artificial. No.
This lady that we just saw. Yeah,

929
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:53,150
that's a good picture. But that's
just her looking fit. There's a,

930
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:55,520
there's a picture of her just Google,

931
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:59,750
like her image double bicep or
something like that. [inaudible]

932
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,820
they see it,
but she shreds city.

933
00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:06,500
That's a shredded fit woman.
But there's,

934
00:53:06,530 --> 00:53:08,510
that looks like a woman
like look at her arms.

935
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:10,910
It looks like a powerful
woman's arm who's in shape.

936
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:15,120
His balls as shit in shape is fuck.
But that other lady that didn't,

937
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:20,810
I didn't mean to shaping the county.
I understand. We get shit online.

938
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:24,170
She's a tank fire shop.
He said balls. Yeah,

939
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:28,560
we can't fire for your own thing. If they
fire you from showtime, it'll be like,

940
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,950
they use the force against themselves.
They'll just make you stronger.

941
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,980
I do see a lot of crazy shit though.
He could do that show on your own.

942
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:38,350
You can do all or anything like
that you could do on your own. Yeah.

943
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:41,460
I think it's great that you're on
showtime. It's a fun show too. Yeah.

944
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:44,490
What I like about it is you're
being you on that show. Yes,

945
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:47,610
I see you on that show. I'm like,
oh, they let him be himself.

946
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:51,420
Like you say about your silly
shit laughing. There's a
lot of cracking ops. Yeah,

947
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:54,200
I have fun. They let me do my
thing. The first one, it was like,

948
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:57,500
there's a lot of teleprompter and I was
like, God, that's really not my thing yet.

949
00:53:57,501 --> 00:54:00,380
Let me go. And they listen to me.
That's the great thing about showtime.

950
00:54:00,381 --> 00:54:02,390
They listened to me,
but the fans like, man,

951
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:05,580
this isn't why we listened to Brendan
to be another fricking sports show.

952
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:08,750
Like you gotta let them go. And then
literally they all were like, all right,

953
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:11,810
here you go, man. Here's your point. Do
what you want to do. I'm like, really?

954
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:16,790
But then they edit it so I don't
get in trouble like, oh my God,

955
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:22,460
which is why they're showtime and um,
what I do,

956
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:26,700
well that means this were we we talked
about the other day with Eve Edwards.

957
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:29,640
He was in here. That was,
that's one of those things like,

958
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:34,320
and I was saying when you talk as much
as we talk, we both, I talked too much.

959
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:36,060
You talk too much. We
talked too much. Yes.

960
00:54:36,090 --> 00:54:38,600
When you talk too much shit
comes out of your mouth.

961
00:54:38,601 --> 00:54:43,230
You guys step in some shit and then you're
scrambling and trying to like make it

962
00:54:43,231 --> 00:54:43,940
make sense.

963
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:48,160
Joe and I can't,
I didn't listen to the podcast with these.

964
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,590
I like these,
we don't know each other that well.

965
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:55,000
The thing that bothers me about this is
I couldn't even tell you the point I was

966
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,670
trying to make as soon
as I give us $1 million.

967
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,220
Tell us the point you're
trying to make money. I forget.

968
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:04,690
I remember I'd Kevin Leon and then I
remember before that I was 20 minutes deep

969
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:05,920
into explain why,

970
00:55:05,921 --> 00:55:09,520
think DC's the greatest of all time
as beside you as a commentator.

971
00:55:09,521 --> 00:55:13,300
Why is the future of the sport?
And then before that show,

972
00:55:13,301 --> 00:55:17,620
me and Brian were talking about
something with race and men and women and

973
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:22,170
somehow that entered my brain and I
have no animosity toward it this way.

974
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,880
It doesn't make sense.
I have no animosity towards UFC tonight.

975
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:28,300
Two of my favorite shows. I've worked
with Karen Bryant for over 10 years.

976
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:32,350
She's a good friend, Woodley
DC, Kenny Florence, get friend.

977
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,020
Brisbane's a good buddy. Uh, I don't know,
ease. I work with the team on UFC light.

978
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,710
I love those guys. I just had Jimmy Smith
in and on my show who works, you know,

979
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,670
there it does,
it makes zero sense.

980
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:47,500
And then I was in Saint Louis and I
started to get texts from so involved in

981
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:49,690
that show. I won't say their
name and he goes, hey man, uh,

982
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,060
some people are upset here about what
he said. And I'm like, what? I see,

983
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,050
I can even tell you what I said. And he
tells me like what? And then Chin goes,

984
00:55:56,051 --> 00:55:59,450
hey man, I'm seeing online about some of
the stuff. He goes, should I edit it out?

985
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,190
No, we never do that again.
Don't edit. Let me deal with
it. Let me see what I say.

986
00:56:03,191 --> 00:56:04,990
Cause that makes me look even worse.
If you cut it out,

987
00:56:04,991 --> 00:56:08,690
it looks like I was saying something
that I wasn't meant to say. And uh,

988
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:12,760
then you know, ease was upset and then
me and Eve's texts back and forth again.

989
00:56:12,761 --> 00:56:13,480
I don't know him.

990
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,510
Brian works with them a little bit
uncertain stuff for help or something like

991
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:19,300
that for shows where we've tried to do,
which is great.

992
00:56:19,301 --> 00:56:22,720
Everyone should talk to Brian, you know,
if you're friends with them. And then, um,

993
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:27,550
I sent eva tech says number from a Brian
and I thought it was over squashed.

994
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,480
And then,
uh,

995
00:56:28,481 --> 00:56:32,680
I was doing PR for my pull the belt show
in New York and someone brought it up.

996
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:35,140
I'm like, oh man. Again, I
went and I meant, no offense,

997
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,120
I come up with about 10 hours of content
a week. I can tell you what I say,

998
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:42,340
and I messed up. Um, whoever
had, uh, problems with it.

999
00:56:42,341 --> 00:56:46,090
If it's Eve Edwards, um,
that's his own insecurities,

1000
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:50,470
which is so stupid because I couldn't
tell you what he should be insecure about

1001
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,620
it. That makes sense. And then as
soon as I get done that I interview,

1002
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:55,780
I get texted, my brother is
this, he goes, you're an idiot.

1003
00:56:55,990 --> 00:56:58,660
You resurface that story.
I'm like, oh my God.

1004
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,870
And so I texted him again and
then come down here, right.

1005
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:08,980
And then I haven't listened
to it. And then, uh, you know,
I texted, he's like, dude,

1006
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,620
I don't want to keep going through this.
I meant zero fence.

1007
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:16,930
I've texted Karen Bryant, DC Woodley,
literally anyone that you'll see tonight,

1008
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,620
I this business, especially in
entertainment, you notice better anyone.

1009
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:25,060
It's impossible to be successful in
this business. It's a fucking monster.

1010
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,720
I'm, I'm willing to help them out. I want
to help. You know what I'm saying? I,

1011
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:31,450
I don't want to criticize people.
That's not what I do.

1012
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,740
That's not what I signed up for this.

1013
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:37,300
I just got caught on a path when
you started talking about, yeah,

1014
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,670
and then one of the things that we do,

1015
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,020
the best part about it is there's
no script. The best and the worst.

1016
00:57:44,021 --> 00:57:47,410
It's the worst because I could deal with
this. Sometimes he goes haywire. Yeah,

1017
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,810
but it ain't go haywire.
My biggest issue is,

1018
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:55,200
is whenever someone was hurt by my
words or are upset by something I said,

1019
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:00,370
then I'm like, I again, I don't know Eve's
that well at all, but I lost sleep over.

1020
00:58:00,371 --> 00:58:03,490
I'm like, oh my God, what am I
doing? I have respect for him.

1021
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:05,590
He's a pioneer at one 55 again,

1022
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:07,720
I love all the people you've seen
tonight and I've watched the show all the

1023
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:11,190
Goddamn time there.
My makes zero sense doc and you,

1024
00:58:11,191 --> 00:58:15,220
you tried to just make sense
of your words. It makes no
sense. I Apologize Steve.

1025
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,080
It's, it's all good. I told him,

1026
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:19,670
open door policy ones come on the
show we can talk about on there,

1027
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:23,010
but I put my foot in my mouth and I hate
to tell you three and a half. And again,

1028
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,650
I wish I could say it's not,
it's probably happening.

1029
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:29,730
It's part of what makes it fun is that
you are really working without a filter.

1030
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:33,490
Working without a net. You're just,
you're trying to have fun. So yeah,

1031
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:34,440
I mean that's,

1032
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:39,220
sometimes you just take some swings and
you miss things that I came to ball,

1033
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,100
I was trying to hit. I came to tell you
I was taking swings at balls. I was,

1034
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:46,630
even though it was hitting. So sometimes
that shit happens, but it happens.

1035
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,360
Yeah. It's just one of
those things. I mean,

1036
00:58:49,361 --> 00:58:52,210
I've done it a hundred times
on this podcast, said some
shit and I'm, I was like,

1037
00:58:52,211 --> 00:58:53,920
what the fuck?
Can I even say that for?

1038
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,710
I don't even know what
was going on in my mind.

1039
00:58:56,860 --> 00:58:59,350
And sometimes like when you're
trying to form a sentence,

1040
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:00,850
like right now I'm trying to
form a sentence, right? Like,

1041
00:59:00,851 --> 00:59:04,320
sometimes while you're thinking about it,
you're like, this isn't going so good.

1042
00:59:04,370 --> 00:59:07,000
I know. Let me try to make
it sound better. All right,

1043
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:10,930
let me try to see if I could rescue this
for the people that are listening and

1044
00:59:10,931 --> 00:59:11,561
make some sense.

1045
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:16,030
And then it just makes it more clout
and more fun and it's hard for people to

1046
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:19,810
fall. And you just like, God, I speak for
a living. Have you ever been on stage?

1047
00:59:19,870 --> 00:59:24,320
He was going through my set and I was,
I've been doing it so much lately.

1048
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:28,430
I'll be in the middle of it and in my
mind on fast forward to already the next

1049
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:30,740
bit. And I'm thinking about
that bit while I'm doing this.

1050
00:59:30,741 --> 00:59:34,520
One of you had done that or am I curious
about that? I know cause I'm not,

1051
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:37,810
I'm not present. Don't do that. You
know what happened is I missed, I,

1052
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,230
I skipped over a part that was new and
I thought it was gonna be a home run.

1053
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:46,640
I skipped over it. Yeah. And I went back
and cause I record it. Right. And, um,

1054
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:50,780
and I didn't realize I was doing the
moment. And I listen, I go, oh my God.

1055
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:56,090
And I remember in my head
going, dude, you're here on
third. You're on first base.

1056
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:59,570
You're looking at third already. You
Miss Second Pace. You're not even,

1057
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,920
you're not even the moment.
That's hard because there's like a,

1058
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,480
you never know how you should
think when you're on stage.

1059
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,180
You're doing the bit and you're just
trying to perform the bit, right?

1060
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,540
And if it's going well, then you start
thinking, okay, this is going well.

1061
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,160
What am I going to lead into next?

1062
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:16,850
But while you're still talking about
the original, you can't do that. I know.

1063
01:00:16,851 --> 01:00:20,270
Have you done that before though?
Yeah, no, I've definitely done it. You,

1064
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,470
he was so disappointed in myself,
man. The big thing about comedy,

1065
01:00:24,471 --> 01:00:28,550
one of the big things is the audience has
to know that you are honestly thinking

1066
01:00:28,551 --> 01:00:29,600
about that subject.

1067
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,250
Like even if you've talked about it a
hundred times when you're talking about it

1068
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:37,970
that day in front of those
people they want, they,

1069
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:39,290
they're hearing it for the first time.

1070
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:43,700
They want you to be tuned into that
subject 100% and present. Yeah,

1071
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:46,960
if you're not, they can sense it.
I know. I was so disappointed.

1072
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,360
I've never done it before. And it
was, it was very strange too because,

1073
01:00:50,361 --> 01:00:54,890
and this is what hurts me about the eve
Edward situation is the guys I looked up

1074
01:00:54,891 --> 01:00:58,490
to yourself, Gary Shandling, like
they always help people, man.

1075
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,890
You don't put anyone down.
They always help people.

1076
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,630
And I don't have the same
platform you guys have,

1077
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:05,750
but I like to think one day I will.
And I want to help people,

1078
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:10,640
like you guys help people like the 60
degrees of separation and you look at all

1079
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,490
the lives you've touched and
Garry Shandling and it's insane.

1080
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,420
That's so inspirational to me. And I was
watching the Garry Shandling doc. I went,

1081
01:01:17,421 --> 01:01:21,470
man, that's so cool. And that's why
this Edwards situations fucking me up.

1082
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:24,080
Cause I'm like, damn man, it's
not, I don't want to hurt anyone.

1083
01:01:24,290 --> 01:01:28,100
But with back to the comedy, I was so
excited because the Garry Shandling stuff,

1084
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:31,670
when they, whenever they be channeling,
whenever they show comedy store stuff,

1085
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:33,680
it's just,
I'm so into it man.

1086
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,190
And he was talking about the comedy
store and I got super inspired and I was

1087
01:01:37,191 --> 01:01:39,560
like, let's do this. I'm never
been more pumped to hit the stage.

1088
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:43,250
And then that happened. I
was so disappointed. You're,
you're still getting it.

1089
01:01:43,251 --> 01:01:45,460
I mean, think about like how
long you've been doing standup.

1090
01:01:45,461 --> 01:01:47,040
You'd been doing it less than two years.
Yeah.

1091
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,040
This is a thing that's going to come up
and it's like, you know, it's like, uh,

1092
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,190
like when you're, you know, you're
doing a certain move and you'll,

1093
01:01:55,191 --> 01:01:57,110
you'll leave yourself open for
an arm bar, you know, like,

1094
01:01:57,111 --> 01:01:59,150
how the fuck am I still doing that?
It's just,

1095
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,490
you just have to submit it into your
head. It's a craft, you know what I mean?

1096
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:09,110
You're, you're, you got a great work
ethic and you're a funny dude and you're,

1097
01:02:09,111 --> 01:02:12,950
you're very good at going off
the cuff and you're impulsive.

1098
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:15,080
Like those are all great
qualities for comedy.

1099
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:19,680
And you also doing the work and to
involved like you're listening to tapes,

1100
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,160
you going over notes, you're doing
things. A lot of comics don't do,

1101
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:24,930
cause a lot of comics are fucking lazy.

1102
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:27,870
Like I've had conversations
with dudes and I'm like, Hey,

1103
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:32,340
you did a fucking special last August
or last October and you're already

1104
01:02:32,341 --> 01:02:36,470
recording another one. And I'm like,
yeah I work. I fucking work that stuff.

1105
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:40,740
Like I really work like I
get home from a comedy store,

1106
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:45,390
I'll get home, it's 1230 at night. I'll
just sit in front of the fucking TV.

1107
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:49,590
I'll put something on just for background
and I pull out the laptop and I start

1108
01:02:49,591 --> 01:02:52,380
writing when he come back from the
semester. Right. I started writing.

1109
01:02:52,381 --> 01:02:55,260
This time I go over, I go
over subjects, I'll put a,

1110
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:57,870
I mean I sometimes I just have something
in the background just for a visual.

1111
01:02:57,871 --> 01:03:00,270
I just like to be stimulated
by something back.

1112
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:03,720
Or sometimes I'll just sit by
myself at my desk, just nothing,

1113
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,180
just nothing but that
fucking screen staring at it.

1114
01:03:06,330 --> 01:03:11,200
And when I do that every two or three
days I'll come up with a great line. Yup.

1115
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:15,000
Every two or three days,
which is nuts. This is nuts,
which is a lot of work. Yeah.

1116
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:19,020
And cause usually I'll come home,
you know, it's late at night,

1117
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:23,910
I'll just take one little hit
to sit down and go over.

1118
01:03:23,911 --> 01:03:27,540
The idea is give those ideas their time.
You're the stuff you already have. Yeah.

1119
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,300
Give those ideas their time.
And then maybe I have a new idea,

1120
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:32,250
maybe of a new idea.
I'll flesh that out too.

1121
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,200
And then I'll come back and look
at that again tomorrow night.

1122
01:03:34,201 --> 01:03:37,380
And then I have a whole list. I started
using this program called scrivener.

1123
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:42,300
You've ever heard of scrivener on
the IPAD? Well you can use it on Mac.

1124
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:48,410
Um, it'll work on an iPad or you
could use it on a windows too. Um,

1125
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,530
I've been writing on windows. I write,
I liked that. I like actual paper,

1126
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:57,300
uh, papers. Good. But I can't write
with my hands as fast as I can type

1127
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:02,010
the phone version. Oh, they got a phone
version two. Is that for Android as well?

1128
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,780
It says features for Ios. So what
exactly do you do with this Joe? Well,

1129
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:11,640
this one is, this is different show the
cork board thing, the corkboard things.

1130
01:04:11,641 --> 01:04:14,640
Interesting. Um, what,

1131
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,850
what they do is just see if you could
yeah, right there. Pull that up.

1132
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:21,840
So they have it like this. This is like,
you could do it in different colors,

1133
01:04:21,841 --> 01:04:24,420
so you've got to have different,
each one of those things,

1134
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,410
those little windows can be like a box.

1135
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,940
So that's cool that you know that
that doesn't look like a cork board.

1136
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:30,571
But sometimes you can,

1137
01:04:30,571 --> 01:04:33,840
you can change the background and shit
and it make it actually look like a cork

1138
01:04:33,841 --> 01:04:36,570
board.
But what it is is basically a board,

1139
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:40,950
a bulletin board where you've taken an
index card and you put it up there and

1140
01:04:40,951 --> 01:04:45,240
the index card has the subject. That's
sweet. So I'll do that in real life too.

1141
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:50,100
I have a real cork board and I put index
cards on the Cork Board. Like if, uh,

1142
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:53,580
I'm doing like Vegan cat, I'll do
that bit, I'll put it up right there.

1143
01:04:56,100 --> 01:05:00,450
I can't wait for that line and I put
all these different things on the cork

1144
01:05:00,451 --> 01:05:04,760
board and then I'll look at them and
I'll pick one and then I'll do it.

1145
01:05:04,940 --> 01:05:09,480
It really, all these different
things, it's just about
making the time, making the,

1146
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:10,540
putting the focus.

1147
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:14,640
That's what you do and that's why you're
getting better so quick and all these

1148
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:17,040
are the guys like what the fuck?
He's where we're doing an hour.

1149
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:21,400
What the fuck is touring the road? He
works, he listens to those recordings.

1150
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:23,200
Nobody listens to the recordings,
man.

1151
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,720
They record them and they never
listened to them. I listen.

1152
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,410
You gotta listen half too. It sucks to
hear your voice, right? It's not good.

1153
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:32,270
They're the worst. That's what it
looks like. Oh, that's sweet man. Yeah,

1154
01:05:32,380 --> 01:05:36,190
so it's set up like that I like,
we're literally looks like,

1155
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,090
so I have that on my laptop
and so I come home, I'll,

1156
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:43,600
I'll pause to open a card and I'll pick
a subject and I'll start going and if

1157
01:05:43,601 --> 01:05:46,120
something else comes to
mind while I'm on that,

1158
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:48,070
I'll just start talking about
that and just keep going.

1159
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:52,780
It's all just about opening up the flood
gates. But really I just about giving,

1160
01:05:53,620 --> 01:05:57,130
giving everything more time, giving
everything more, more attention.

1161
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:00,580
You're more focused, you know, and not
just skimming through it and over done.

1162
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:03,730
What's good is a moment like this where
you fucked up and you were thinking

1163
01:06:03,731 --> 01:06:05,170
about one bit while you're
thinking about another,

1164
01:06:05,171 --> 01:06:08,080
now you know that that can happen.
Yeah. So that's like a lesson.

1165
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,910
So just look at it as a good thing.
Like now you're set,

1166
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:14,020
we'll be stronger because of that.
Yeah. Whenever I have a bad set,

1167
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:18,400
the one good thing that it
says to me, it's like, okay,
I know how bad that feels.

1168
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:22,540
I know where I went wrong.
I know it meets live comedy.

1169
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:27,250
Man Live is crazy. It's just,
there's so many factors. It's so,

1170
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,990
it's so loose and wild. It's just,
it's a crazy way to perform. You know?

1171
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:35,440
And sometimes it doesn't go right, but
purest way to perform. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

1172
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,230
but it everyone I know like as far as
who's just the tip of the spear as French

1173
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:44,470
comedy, like you bur deleah
there's one thing in common.

1174
01:06:44,471 --> 01:06:48,220
All you guys work, man. Gotta
work relentless. Constantly.

1175
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:51,550
Got to be doing sets all the time.
You know, I'll do sets three,

1176
01:06:51,551 --> 01:06:56,200
four nights a week, um, at the, at
the least a good week. I'll do five,

1177
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,980
like wrapping up from my special do
five and your specialty paper. Yeah.

1178
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:06,070
Yeah. It, uh, Wilbur Boston. Yeah. Hell
yeah. 20th and 21st can't wait man.

1179
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,840
Great. Is that room the
best? That room is crazy,

1180
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:15,310
right for me that I highlight that one.
Like as far as lifetime achievements,

1181
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:17,110
the Wilbur for a guy like me to sell it,

1182
01:07:17,111 --> 01:07:21,490
the Wilbert Wyatt and then you open and
we kept it a secret. I'm a chatty Cathy.

1183
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:25,150
I was so proud of myself. That was
great. That was great. Good Beth man.

1184
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:29,030
Well also that places like three
comedy clubs. Yes. It's like there.

1185
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:32,800
Everyone's so close to you, even though
it's like 1100 people, 1200 people,

1186
01:07:32,801 --> 01:07:35,410
whatever it is.
They're stacked up so close to you.

1187
01:07:35,411 --> 01:07:38,320
It's like 500 on the bottom and then,
yeah.

1188
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,580
You know it's like that in the fight world
is the poems. Yeah. When I thought Roy,

1189
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:46,480
I was like, God, get off of me man.
Get out of town. I didn't like it.

1190
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:50,530
The palms was great. Yeah, pumps is great.
They're not doing it anymore, right? No,

1191
01:07:50,620 --> 01:07:54,060
I think doesn't Lorenzo on the palms
now? Didn't they buy the palms? Yeah,

1192
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:58,090
they did. Yeah. Hashtag
Bolan taken over. Yeah,

1193
01:07:58,091 --> 01:08:02,100
because the 27 casinos just isn't enough.
Like now let's keep it going. Yeah.

1194
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:04,000
They own all those station casinos.

1195
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:07,510
Those fuckers are everywhere
ever stayed at Olin, don't

1196
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,790
I stayed at, they made me stay at that
Palestinian casino when I was getting,

1197
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:16,270
before I went on the ultimate fighter,
the worst whole diversity

1198
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,710
of my life. Really the
worst. The worst. Hands down.

1199
01:08:18,711 --> 01:08:22,280
I've never stayed in the worst hotel.
Now at the time is under construction,

1200
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,280
is off the strip and of
course there's a hooker.

1201
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,630
Been smacked around the other room.

1202
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:29,300
I've told this story when I thought
I was going to be a captain.

1203
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:31,820
Save a hoe and they get pulled out a gun.
I ran my underwear,

1204
01:08:31,821 --> 01:08:34,280
almost got kicked off the
ultimate fighter. I've told
this story on here, I think,

1205
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:39,150
but that's power station casino
guy pulled a gun on you. Well, uh,

1206
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:42,230
it was the night before, uh,
the ultimate fighter, right?

1207
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,840
Sorry if you've already heard this.
It was the night for the ultimate fighter.

1208
01:08:44,841 --> 01:08:45,080
And they,

1209
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:48,350
they put all the fighters in there and
they tell you the production staff goes,

1210
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:51,320
do not leave this room.
If you leave this room,

1211
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:53,450
you will be kicked off the
show before even begins.

1212
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,790
You're not allowed to leave this room.
We're taking your phone.

1213
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,450
Everything all you have is what you bring
in the house. Do not leave this room.

1214
01:08:59,451 --> 01:09:01,100
We'll bring you food, any
food you want, call down.

1215
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,520
So I called had myself Nice Caesar Salad
Cause I was worried about my figure on

1216
01:09:04,521 --> 01:09:06,650
the ultimate fighter.
And the next day and uh,

1217
01:09:06,651 --> 01:09:11,030
I finally fall asleep and I hear this
arguing next door and the walls are paper

1218
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:13,040
thin.
It's pallet station for God's sakes.

1219
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,970
And I hear this guy in this girl arguing
on mine. It's waking me up. I'm like,

1220
01:09:16,971 --> 01:09:17,804
what the fuck?

1221
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:22,220
And then she's just going off them and
I hear him slap the piss out of her.

1222
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,020
Oh my card. And then there in, then I
hear, keep going and him hit her again.

1223
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:29,240
I'm like, Aye man. So I'm like fuck this.

1224
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:33,620
So I get up in my and under Roos to like
stop this because I just thought it was

1225
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:36,860
a regular dude hitting a girl. I'm not
flying. I'm not cool with that man.

1226
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:41,840
I get up and salt. I'd get on my door and
I hear another do go, Nah man, Nah man,

1227
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:46,640
fuck this bitch. I'm going to shoot
her and I hear a gun clock, Amal. Uh,

1228
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:50,510
definitely not going in there now.
Fuck that noise. And I'm like, God,

1229
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:52,430
it's so quiet. I'm like, I
don't want him to hear me.

1230
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:57,550
So I'm army calling my undies till the
door cause I'm afraid fucking gunfire.

1231
01:09:57,961 --> 01:10:01,940
It's going to go off. I get to my
door and I hear him go, hold up dog.

1232
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:06,220
Hold up someone's next door. I'm
like, Oh shit. So you'll see that,

1233
01:10:06,221 --> 01:10:07,730
I'm sure there's video
of this power station.

1234
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:12,140
Me just booking down the hallway
and I run to the casino and the,

1235
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,760
the staff was like game when something,

1236
01:10:13,761 --> 01:10:16,700
they see me go run by and went to go get
security or underwear in my underwear

1237
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:21,170
and I went to go get security. But all
the production staff saw me. They're like,

1238
01:10:21,171 --> 01:10:24,080
what the fuck is shop doing?
So I told her, I'm the k,

1239
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,110
some girls are about to get shot next
door. I don't know what's going on.

1240
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:31,460
But she was hip before. There's two dudes
in there and there's a lady in my room,

1241
01:10:31,461 --> 01:10:36,030
two 13 and like, all right, so you'll
show us. So I go up there, I'm watts,

1242
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:40,040
it's there and then they just,
they go, go to your room.

1243
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,230
But I'm in my room like look
and see what's going on.

1244
01:10:42,350 --> 01:10:45,290
And like a whole crew
of them go in fucking,

1245
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:50,060
the girl starts defending
the dude attacks. Security.
They have to taste the dude,

1246
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,650
the other guy who was going to shoot her,

1247
01:10:51,651 --> 01:10:56,150
they put in handcuffs and it's too large,
you know, black dudes. And I'm like,

1248
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:56,841
I'm like fuck this.

1249
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:59,320
So they bring me down the hallway
cause just in case he's going down,

1250
01:10:59,330 --> 01:11:00,163
they're bringing down the hallway,

1251
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,900
but I'm like this with the
crew and I hear the guy go,

1252
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:07,860
I see you white boy fucking snitch.
We'll be back and we'll ah, so that,

1253
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:12,230
and I was like, can I get another room
that I like? No, there's no more rooms.

1254
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:14,070
I'm like,
well they know where I'm staying,

1255
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,820
man. I'm supposed to start a show
tomorrow. Like what this is. I mean,

1256
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:20,190
what do you want us to do?
And like anything else.

1257
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:23,640
And I had to stay and I got
zero zero winks of sleep.

1258
01:11:23,670 --> 01:11:27,780
Literally Zero Shiro Mesh.
I was so scared.

1259
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:31,230
And that's more than when they knocked
as a gas. Yes, I'm here. I'm here.

1260
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,760
Put me in the ultimate fighter house.
Yeah,

1261
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:37,050
that guy got out of jail like quick
or guarantee. Oh for flapping up.

1262
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:40,830
And she was a prostitute. I did not
know that, but still eat the pimp.

1263
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:44,100
It was a pimp and a prostitute. And then
some John is in that. She's a woman.

1264
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,910
She's a woman. She's my equal.
She's your equal. She's my equal.

1265
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,170
I like how you thank you. Think
you're a feminist. Ah Man.

1266
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:56,910
I swear I can turn this
into that as a joke.

1267
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:59,760
That's just showing
your belly. I know, man.

1268
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:03,580
This whole me too movement and it's,
I dunno.

1269
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:07,290
It's a tricky situation. It is.
You think is going to bounce back.

1270
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:12,600
I think the game's changed for forever.
I do. I think if you're a creep,

1271
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,630
you can get sought out and found out.
However,

1272
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,720
I think men in power and position and if
there's an attractive young lady in the

1273
01:12:20,941 --> 01:12:23,100
office or the studio,
there's,

1274
01:12:23,101 --> 01:12:25,710
this is always going to be the
dynamic because I think there's,

1275
01:12:25,740 --> 01:12:28,440
I think there's some attractive
young ladies out there who are like,

1276
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,790
I don't have a problem with it. They did?
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. He's an attractive dude.

1277
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:35,780
Just happens to have some power
and get me a movies whenever,

1278
01:12:35,790 --> 01:12:39,930
but actually liked him. You know, I'm not
being forced to do this. Well, there's,

1279
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:43,650
there's a new option now. It's almost
like a new element is in the game.

1280
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:46,080
Like if you're playing a game and then
all of a sudden someone found like a new

1281
01:12:46,081 --> 01:12:49,470
magic power,
you can end careers now.

1282
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:54,420
If you are like a woman who was sexually
abused by a guy like Harvey Weinstein

1283
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:58,140
used to just have to take it. Now you
have a new power, which is all about.

1284
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:58,831
However,

1285
01:12:58,831 --> 01:13:02,530
some will take advantage of that power
and pull that card when it's not real and

1286
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:06,840
dude's are losing their jobs. Like, whoa.
Yeah. There's people that are crazy, like,

1287
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:09,510
look, that video that we were
watching before the podcast today,

1288
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:14,160
or that lady was shot up youtube.
We're watching her, her online videos,

1289
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,750
one of the worst youtube
videos I've ever seen.

1290
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:19,530
She's fucking nuts and there's going to
be people like that and there's going to

1291
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:23,040
be people like that that take advantage
of the me too movement. It's just,

1292
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:24,840
it's just going to be,
I mean,

1293
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:28,860
there's no way you can deny that there's
just a part of human nature that's with

1294
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:30,060
anything though, right? Yeah.

1295
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:34,620
But it's extremely ultimately where
it's going to shift as people have to be

1296
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:37,170
nicer to each other and they can't
get away with shit like that.

1297
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:41,730
And that's what Weinstein was
doing was nothing but crime.

1298
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,560
It's just crime. He's a bad dude. He's a
bad dude and I'm glad that happened. Yeah,

1299
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,780
I really am. I'm glad he got sought out
and he's scrutiny should be screwed.

1300
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:49,860
You imagine being a chicken,

1301
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:53,280
you have to suck that fat guy's Dick
nor to getting a movie. Hey Harvey,

1302
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:56,510
he's there Amy way. You could just
look a little more attractive now.

1303
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:59,160
Do you have to be so hideous?
There's nothing he can do at this point.

1304
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:02,610
They would have to cut chunks of his
face and pull it back to kids. The money.

1305
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,560
He's got this blah, blah. What about the
Diet? It's part of the whole thing, right?

1306
01:14:07,561 --> 01:14:10,950
It's like he's a glutton.
Would girls complain if you
look like Brad Pitt though?

1307
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,580
Tony Hinchcliffe

1308
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:14,780
has a bit. Oh, it doesn't want
to. I meant to tell you that my,

1309
01:14:14,781 --> 01:14:19,000
that I wasn't trying to screw us bit.
He doesn't use that as an example,

1310
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:20,740
but it's a great bit.
You have to see it.

1311
01:14:20,741 --> 01:14:23,620
I don't want to even paraphrase you give
it away. No, no, no, no, you didn't.

1312
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:28,000
It's a great bit. It actually involves
a Louis C. K it's a great, I love it.

1313
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:30,010
It's really fucking funny.
Tony's brilliant.

1314
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:33,130
I don't want to tell you where it
goes because it goes even crazier off.

1315
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,730
Are you gonna see him tonight?
Yeah, he's at the store.

1316
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:40,540
I'm at the store to him or heard or I
took them in the row with me this past

1317
01:14:40,540 --> 01:14:44,890
week. He's a killer and murderer and he
murdered them in Nashville. Murdered,

1318
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:49,160
murdered them in Charlotte. A
lot of rednecks. Ackland Woo.

1319
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:53,530
Tony had to go to war because
Gluck heckling Tony. I mean,

1320
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:58,090
he's a writer for the roast for guts.
He's so witty. I fucked up one time.

1321
01:14:58,091 --> 01:14:59,710
It had let my shield down.

1322
01:14:59,740 --> 01:15:02,530
It's tell them I almost started crying
and comedy central and I just feel as

1323
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,080
neck gets stiff and go
and ride when I'm like,

1324
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:09,040
oh Harry coms.
And then he was like,

1325
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:12,520
you almost cried and comedy central and
just roasted me for basically the rest

1326
01:15:12,521 --> 01:15:14,920
of the show. Why would you, why did
you almost cry on comedy central?

1327
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:18,790
Just cause it's full circle for Gallic
Miyubi on county central doing stand up.

1328
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:22,060
You know, it was just a special
night for me and I, and during this,

1329
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:22,811
the story that I tell,

1330
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:25,330
I talked about how I realize
that's never become UFC champ.

1331
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:30,040
But being on comedy central and a Judd
Apatow is one of the books I've read when

1332
01:15:30,041 --> 01:15:30,874
a super,
you know,

1333
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:34,870
concern and comedy and that day at App
Towel on my show that night did comedy

1334
01:15:34,871 --> 01:15:36,040
central,
I don't know,

1335
01:15:36,041 --> 01:15:39,670
it just hit me in that moment was on
stage at a strip club where they shoot it

1336
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:41,740
and I don't know, I got
emotional. I was like,

1337
01:15:41,741 --> 01:15:44,560
do you need to get your shit together man?
You gotta get your shit together,

1338
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:47,080
you're happy. I was happy.
I was emotional man.

1339
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:51,580
And then he said that on the
pockets, feel close, Nico,

1340
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:55,540
Nico, and I was like, oh fuck. He's like,

1341
01:15:55,541 --> 01:16:00,340
this isn't comedy central in 2010 and
just went nuts man. Well, Hey Ange,

1342
01:16:00,341 --> 01:16:03,350
because I've always had a thing with
comedy central. Whatever reason. Yeah.

1343
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,770
For whatever it's going to
burn his side about them.

1344
01:16:05,771 --> 01:16:09,370
Like they didn't appreciate him.
He's a very underrated guy man.

1345
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,060
Like right now he's still to this day,
he's right now, he's underrated. I agree.

1346
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:16,810
And I think with your show and we
were, he was close I think. Got, yeah,

1347
01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:20,450
I mean he's a monster in our show.
Uh, the most underrated guy who I,

1348
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:22,750
who should be selling out
theaters just feel Vaughn,

1349
01:16:23,530 --> 01:16:28,480
well we were talking about that
before. He has got, he hit a stride,

1350
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,290
like within the last year,
he had a stride where he just like,

1351
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:34,270
sometimes you'll see dudes,
they,

1352
01:16:34,271 --> 01:16:38,290
they're doing really well and then for
whatever reason they figure something out

1353
01:16:38,291 --> 01:16:41,410
and they take it to the next breakthrough.
And that's where Theo is right now.

1354
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:47,260
He's just, he's a, and he's a unique
guy. Like his comedy is so unique.

1355
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:49,600
Like it wouldn't work with anybody.
You don't see it anywhere else.

1356
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,870
Sometimes I'll watch other
comedians and I'll go,

1357
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:56,050
I can see how they came up with that
idea and I watched the, I'm like,

1358
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:58,870
what the fuck? What the fuck you
smoking? Yeah. Where are you coming up?

1359
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:02,670
Where were you raised?
How old?

1360
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:05,560
How was that race?

1361
01:17:05,870 --> 01:17:08,470
By a fucking pack of
crocodiles in New Orleans.

1362
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:12,860
Did you come up with this? Yeah, he's,

1363
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:17,930
but even just hanging around with him
like offstage. He's just a weird dude.

1364
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,480
Oh Bro. He pulled up oh, fun.
All of this dude yesterday.

1365
01:17:20,481 --> 01:17:25,010
And you just got a new car. I
don't, I won't say car. Nice
car. We'd like it. And uh,

1366
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:28,790
he, I go, dude, you're killing
it man. That your car is. Yeah.

1367
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:31,880
And he has some homosexual. Bumped
into the back. Can Be there.

1368
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:35,750
Why is he a homosexual? He's like,
cause he was, I'm like, all right.

1369
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,980
It just happened. Yeah, it's,
yeah. He's like just having a beat.

1370
01:17:38,780 --> 01:17:42,440
He's just so hilarious, man. Yeah,
there's a lot of good guys right now.

1371
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,030
I was talking about,
uh,

1372
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:48,710
watching that Garry Shandling stuff and
doing all the stuff Judd's document.

1373
01:17:48,711 --> 01:17:52,160
That's Judd Aptos documentary.
It's brilliant on his
process and stuff like that.

1374
01:17:52,220 --> 01:17:54,250
I got emotional on that as well.
I don't know if guys know this,

1375
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:56,240
obviously I'm a complete bitch.
Uh,

1376
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,260
but guess Shannon talks about how his
goal through going through everything was

1377
01:18:00,261 --> 01:18:03,380
to get on the tonight show and then he
does it and he walks backstage and kills

1378
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:07,200
it. Right. But that was his goal and he
starts crying. He falls in a Bob Sag.

1379
01:18:07,201 --> 01:18:08,870
It's arms starts crying.
Right? Cause that was his goal.

1380
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:11,690
But he's talking about the comedy store
and like he's talking about all the big

1381
01:18:11,691 --> 01:18:13,100
names there. And I was thinking, God,

1382
01:18:13,101 --> 01:18:16,070
that must've been cool to be involved
in that back then around all this big

1383
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:20,090
names. I was talking to Brian, Brian
Goes, man, right now the comedy store,

1384
01:18:20,420 --> 01:18:23,720
some would argue it's better and we
think about it. I'm like, God, it is.

1385
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,170
When you think about all the
fucking just legends, man,

1386
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:31,470
you [inaudible] you got married and
got delete. I mean just, he keeps,

1387
01:18:31,650 --> 01:18:34,980
the list goes on and on and on.
I'm like, oh my God, it's bad, man.

1388
01:18:35,270 --> 01:18:36,230
It's a crazy time.

1389
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:40,700
It's certainly the best time at the
store in terms of like the amount of time

1390
01:18:40,701 --> 01:18:43,010
that I've been there and I started
going there in [inaudible] 94.

1391
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:47,630
It's a long time. It's a long ass time.
So in 24 years that I've been going there,

1392
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:50,570
it's better now than ever before.
But when you think about it,

1393
01:18:50,571 --> 01:18:54,310
I mean obviously there's the seller in
New York, but as far as like on a Gig,

1394
01:18:54,350 --> 01:18:58,430
you go there on a Tuesday
night and Wednesday night.
I mean it's fricking, yeah,

1395
01:18:58,431 --> 01:19:01,870
they're very similar. They're
very similar in a way. Um, but,

1396
01:19:02,350 --> 01:19:05,690
and they're also very similar in that
they become big tourist traps to like

1397
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,200
comedy store.
People take vacations for comedy,

1398
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,960
they do comedy vacations
and they fly from Australia,

1399
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:15,780
getting a lot of people from Australia.
But because you know, if you show up, uh,

1400
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:18,050
you're going to see bill
burr, Rogan, Mark Marin,

1401
01:19:18,051 --> 01:19:20,030
and delete in the same
night almost every week.

1402
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:24,590
One of us is there sounds at least unless
someone's on tour so it's off. Yeah.

1403
01:19:24,890 --> 01:19:27,910
Yeah. I ended a lot of
times you are on tour. Um,

1404
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,900
but shit on any given Tuesday, Dave
Chappelle might stop it. Correct.

1405
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:36,920
And then Chris Rock's rock,
maybe Louis don't make us come back there.

1406
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:37,970
I hope he does.

1407
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:43,310
I'm going to lose people like come on,

1408
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:48,620
come on. You like people watching me beat
off. I mean this is worth shit. Come on.

1409
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,950
Yeah. Just need someone to come up.
Someone has to do some much more horrible,

1410
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,280
you know, calen shooting his
special I think in July. No,

1411
01:19:58,550 --> 01:20:02,900
he is through uh, some, I
forget who's who's shooting it,

1412
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:05,030
but definitely not as buddy
works for ESPN this time.

1413
01:20:05,031 --> 01:20:07,980
So they're doing it right there.
He's doing it right time. But I,

1414
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:11,040
they're going to go out there and try
and sell it, but he's ready to go.

1415
01:20:11,370 --> 01:20:14,550
I just hope it works out for count as
far as Netflix or showtime or somewhere.

1416
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:17,880
You got to land somewhere. So is he going
to sell it and then bring it somewhere?

1417
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:21,170
Is that the move? I think so. I don't
want to misquote Brian, but I'm,

1418
01:20:21,190 --> 01:20:22,021
I'm most positive,

1419
01:20:22,021 --> 01:20:26,370
but he has someone who I think he shot
girls and a bunch of other guys stuff

1420
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,140
like it's someone who knows
what the hell they're doing.

1421
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:33,030
Where's he going to do it? Uh, I think
Chicago. Ooh, Chicago was in July. Yeah.

1422
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,350
That's a good spot. I'm
there for the UFC. June.

1423
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:42,060
I'm doing the Chicago theater. June
7th or some shit. I love Chicago.

1424
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:47,070
Ooh, what theater? That sounds. I did
Chicago theater. Chicago. Yeah. Yeah.

1425
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:51,510
It's great. It's beautiful. Beautiful
place to, yeah. Chicago's awesome man.

1426
01:20:52,300 --> 01:20:55,650
Doesn't get enough love to weird place,
right? It does it not get enough love.

1427
01:20:55,651 --> 01:20:57,560
I feel like everyone
fucking loves Chicago there.

1428
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:00,870
Pizza people won't shut up about
not really pizza. It's casserole.

1429
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,210
It's the casserole. Correct. Yeah.

1430
01:21:03,390 --> 01:21:06,420
It's like a wrap calling that a Pete and
that's not a pizza. If you took large,

1431
01:21:06,421 --> 01:21:09,330
thick square, that would be a
casserole. Where I come from.

1432
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:12,150
Have you ever hamburger and
you roll it up in a Tortilla?

1433
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:15,540
Is that still a hamburger?
No. That's the Tortilla wrap.

1434
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:20,220
That's a Burrito out proteins.
That's lettuce.

1435
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:24,640
We call that out. Let us cargo. That's
a lettuce wrap. Chinese food place,

1436
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:30,210
chicken, chicken wrapped.
See the differences the way
you make it. It's rolled up.

1437
01:21:30,211 --> 01:21:33,660
Look, you could take a piece of pizza
and flatten it out and fold it over,

1438
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:36,240
over and over again,
and then it'll become folded pizza.

1439
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:40,080
But if it starts out folded, what are you
selling me? It's a cal zone. You sell?

1440
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:44,800
Yeah, he saw me a Goddamn cal zone. I love
the cows. I'm a fan. I'm a fan of cows.

1441
01:21:44,810 --> 01:21:48,450
And we had to get thick piece of pizza
from a basic casserole from Chicago

1442
01:21:48,451 --> 01:21:52,650
though. Yeah. Oh yes. You've
ever had though is very good.
The best you've ever had.

1443
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,280
What did, where's the place we
go to? So what is it called?

1444
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:00,330
Might've been, you know, who
makes a nice square piece?

1445
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,330
Is King's in New York or have
you ever heard of a Ah, fuck.

1446
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,660
Can we get the artichoke
pizza in New York?

1447
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:10,500
Artichoke P it's called artichoke pizza
of Dev ripped pants to get in there.

1448
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:14,580
No Sir. No Sir. People
kept telling me go there.

1449
01:22:14,850 --> 01:22:18,090
When I was in New York working
with showtime, I tried one slice,

1450
01:22:18,091 --> 01:22:21,580
you know Postmates, Postmates what
makes me fat now? Because I was posting,

1451
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:25,230
I was at the, we'll get food
drops it off to your hotel room.

1452
01:22:25,850 --> 01:22:29,160
So I get done after a long day of
PR. I'm like, pizza would be great.

1453
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:33,890
So I get two slices. I'm like, next time
like fuck, that was delicious. I see. No,

1454
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,740
my God,
I fucking love handles and a chin.

1455
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:40,050
Isn't it weird how like when you're tired,
you want carbs,

1456
01:22:40,380 --> 01:22:44,700
you want sugar and carbs. I wonder why.
I think it's like my willpower is weak.

1457
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:45,301
Yeah.

1458
01:22:45,301 --> 01:22:50,301
Like I want like I never fuck with egg
mcmuffins or McGriddles mouse water.

1459
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:54,880
But if I'm at the airport and
I'm on a fucking 7:00 AM flight,

1460
01:22:56,490 --> 01:23:00,930
you and I together. I never eat that shit.
You and I did together. It was so good.

1461
01:23:00,931 --> 01:23:03,570
For the brief moment. It was in my mouth.
Dude. You know what I was thinking?

1462
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:07,270
I'm like, I'd love and be Grillo, but
I don't wanna be judged right now.

1463
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:11,860
I'm going to wait to see if he goes to
that fucking weird place on the breakfast

1464
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:14,590
spot on the right or is he getting going
to Mcdonald's when we started leaning

1465
01:23:14,591 --> 01:23:18,490
over there, I went and I want to be,
I wouldn't be mad at egg mcmuffin.

1466
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:23,190
And you've looked at yes. Fuck
this. Let's do this. Yes. That's I.

1467
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:26,410
Before I saw you guys, I thought
you would skip it. Oh, that's fine.

1468
01:23:26,780 --> 01:23:30,130
You want to be the guy who
pulls the trigger. You don't
wanna be judged, man. Yeah.

1469
01:23:30,131 --> 01:23:33,520
Most of the time I'm going to
not pull the trigger, but it's,

1470
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:35,020
I feel like that's part of the thing.

1471
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:37,870
It's like pulling that trigger every
now and then for the fuck of it.

1472
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:41,140
I have some fun. Get chicken
and Waffles, go to Roscoe's,

1473
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:45,070
go to Roscoe's in and her that mother
fucker with maple syrup and butter.

1474
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:47,110
You just can't do it every day.
You can't do it every day,

1475
01:23:47,500 --> 01:23:51,790
but you do it one day a week. I agree.
Rock his, his Instagram, like those,

1476
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:56,170
the pictures of him eating stacks
of cheat meal. Stacks of pancakes.

1477
01:23:56,171 --> 01:23:58,780
Definitely a photo shoot. Yeah, I
hear you. You Ain't you and all that.

1478
01:23:58,781 --> 01:24:02,560
So you think so? No, that's definitely
says a giant, you know one thing.

1479
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:05,180
He eats all that shit. Yeah. He's
not a jerk. I mean he, he, he's,

1480
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:07,720
he's on different supplements than I am.
We're about very similar size,

1481
01:24:07,721 --> 01:24:12,480
different supplements, different
supplements, supplements, Supplement pays,

1482
01:24:12,481 --> 01:24:15,930
and they come from south of the border.
I'm sure he's eating the same top case.

1483
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:17,140
You ain't the same tacos

1484
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:25,360
and you see, he came out to,
he has depression. I think
he's, it's football thing,

1485
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:29,530
man. I think. Um, and then also
pro wrestling, all that slamming.

1486
01:24:29,630 --> 01:24:34,370
I like getting slammed around. This is
my take on this, I think. I mean you,

1487
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,180
I'm sure you've dealt with depression,
right? You have bummer days,

1488
01:24:37,181 --> 01:24:39,430
Jamie Haft bummer days,
right? Shit happens.

1489
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:44,050
I think there's a difference between
having a depression period in your life or

1490
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:45,640
events in your life. And then, you know,

1491
01:24:45,641 --> 01:24:49,570
you're normally a happy dude and there's
people with severe depression who has

1492
01:24:49,571 --> 01:24:52,660
to be medicated. There's a scale.
Yeah. And he's not on that scale.

1493
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:56,200
Now he's on that scale. Makes news cause
he goes, Hey, I've been sad to before.

1494
01:24:56,210 --> 01:24:59,530
Like yes,
rockets sat two different sad.

1495
01:24:59,531 --> 01:25:01,990
We're not talking all you should fear
depressed here. You know what I'm saying?

1496
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:05,580
Right. He was talking about his mom was
Ari Shaffir depressed out. Mike Royko,

1497
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:08,500
his mom walked into traffic and I'm,
and I'm not throwing shade at Ari.

1498
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:11,230
We've talked about already having
depression before and he takes medication.

1499
01:25:11,231 --> 01:25:12,550
That's why I said that he doesn't anymore.

1500
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:17,330
He's off medication better and he's
hilarious magically. Oh, weird. Yeah.

1501
01:25:17,331 --> 01:25:21,670
He's a phenomenal comic and successful
and he's not depressed. Also,

1502
01:25:21,671 --> 01:25:24,580
he got off Propecia cal calls portion.

1503
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:28,330
I council taking Propecia like their
skittles and he's the happiest man I know.

1504
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,210
Yeah.
But it's not necessarily like universal,

1505
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:34,810
like some people can take penicillin
and then all of a problem.

1506
01:25:34,990 --> 01:25:36,880
Other people are allergic to it.
Yeah.

1507
01:25:36,881 --> 01:25:40,270
But I think it's a rare case where he'd
take Propecia and get depressed. Oh,

1508
01:25:40,271 --> 01:25:43,810
things are rare. If you look at the
studies and this come from countless,

1509
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:47,080
I mean look, this is bro. Science
count just wants that hair,

1510
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:50,880
wants to keep that hair so bad.
I'll do anything. You know what?

1511
01:25:50,890 --> 01:25:54,910
I think you should wear wig.
Oh, good fat one red one. Yes.

1512
01:25:54,911 --> 01:25:58,990
Just go crazy so I can yank it off
and I want to wear a wig so bad.

1513
01:26:00,140 --> 01:26:03,990
Like one of those, uh, those mesh
net ones, just like the little bronze

1514
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,620
sprayed on looks almost looks
like a Pittsburgh Steeler helmet.

1515
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:10,780
Ron Still doing that? Yeah,
kind of. Yeah, definitely.

1516
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:12,730
You just got to let it go.
Question on this stuff.

1517
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,970
Wouldn't you take from Kesha because
you're a little depressed because your

1518
01:26:16,971 --> 01:26:20,600
hair's falling out and if it didn't work,
you're going to stay correct.

1519
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:24,230
A little depressed still fucks
with your Dick game? Yeah, maybe,

1520
01:26:24,231 --> 01:26:28,490
but I think what they're saying is
like suicidal depression that there's

1521
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:33,520
something about the DHT inhibitor
dihydrotestosterone which is derivative of

1522
01:26:33,981 --> 01:26:37,400
testosterone is what causes
you to have your hair fallout.

1523
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:42,730
The DHT inhibiting factors
in Propecia with some people,

1524
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:46,600
it adds to it. It's a low percentage
though. I'm pretty sure might be

1525
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:48,430
the study of this comes from,
which I just,

1526
01:26:48,431 --> 01:26:53,360
I googled it might've been more than
one study was in 2012 and it was only 61

1527
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:56,510
men. Oh the only did 16 one
minute. How many got depressed,

1528
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:00,950
said a 61 man who formerly use Propecia
who experienced more than three months

1529
01:27:00,951 --> 01:27:03,580
of sexual side effects and
had no history of depression.

1530
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:05,030
Sexual problems of any sort.

1531
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:09,100
Yeah. I don't know, Dude. If I'm losing
my hair and my Dick won't get up,

1532
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:10,670
I'd be depressed too.
Yeah.

1533
01:27:12,020 --> 01:27:15,590
And then also you've got to figure like
what's happening in your love life.

1534
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,390
If you're depressed and your Dick doesn't
work correct. But also philosophy,

1535
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:24,830
if you had a nine to five job you hate
and that pay the bills and then you got

1536
01:27:24,831 --> 01:27:26,030
family drama,

1537
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:30,950
11% of those, I guess 11% of the 61
which would be what? Six of them,

1538
01:27:30,951 --> 01:27:34,520
five or six had mild symptoms,
symptoms of depression.

1539
01:27:34,521 --> 01:27:37,400
28 had moderate and 36 had severe.

1540
01:27:37,730 --> 01:27:40,490
Whoa.
36 had severe.

1541
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:44,280
Uh, I mean, so that's also then when
you're asking them, so it's like,

1542
01:27:44,281 --> 01:27:44,910
what does the study,

1543
01:27:44,910 --> 01:27:48,000
what was the study on the
second you say 61 people,

1544
01:27:48,001 --> 01:27:51,650
36% had severe depression.
Yes.

1545
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:55,680
I found that 44% of the men had
experienced thoughts of suicide.

1546
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:59,470
Hold on. I'm already hold
on. Jesus Christ be 4%

1547
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,740
right. But that's what I'm also
going in. Like what were they,

1548
01:28:01,800 --> 01:28:04,410
did they just ask them like, have
you ever thought of it? Because

1549
01:28:04,690 --> 01:28:06,460
well, did they call, it's
the scientific study.

1550
01:28:06,461 --> 01:28:08,660
I'm sure there's some sort of
protocol they have to follow.

1551
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,060
Let me understand this though.

1552
01:28:10,061 --> 01:28:14,920
66 people were randomly out of Iran.
How many people took it,

1553
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:18,660
right? It says that the Journal of
Clinical Psych, psychiatric psychiatry,

1554
01:28:18,661 --> 01:28:21,810
I'm sorry, study included
61 men. That's what it,

1555
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:26,080
so what does that like 28 dudes wanted
to kill themselves. That's fucking crazy.

1556
01:28:26,081 --> 01:28:29,540
Lay off that property show. Fuck that.
I'll just, I'll just don't ball Jude.

1557
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:33,550
Ari said it like it was like almost
instant and he never put the two of them

1558
01:28:33,551 --> 01:28:36,490
together. Never put the
dough in depression with the,

1559
01:28:36,491 --> 01:28:41,010
with the suicidal thoughts like it,
all of it came like white when he got out.

1560
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,741
I'm like,
you know,

1561
01:28:41,741 --> 01:28:46,390
he had had some issues in the past
with being depressed after breakups.

1562
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:50,170
Normal shit, like everybody has,
but it wasn't, that's not the case.

1563
01:28:50,171 --> 01:28:54,760
I know want to kill me. Didn't, he
didn't, Ari's kind of a stoic dude.

1564
01:28:55,570 --> 01:28:58,510
He's very proud and he doesn't
talk a lot about stuff.

1565
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:03,630
And so it took like me and him hanging
where he like wasn't talking and I was

1566
01:29:03,631 --> 01:29:07,980
like, okay, what's the matter? And
he's like, dude, it's just hard.

1567
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:12,870
It's hard to just not kill myself. He
said that to you? And I went, what? Yeah,

1568
01:29:12,871 --> 01:29:17,040
so we were playing pool at my house and
I was like, what? I go, what's going on?

1569
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:19,730
So he starts telling me,
um,

1570
01:29:19,770 --> 01:29:23,520
they put him on medication
and the medication didn't
work and then they put him

1571
01:29:23,521 --> 01:29:27,060
on another medication and then that
didn't work. And you know, he's with Sag,

1572
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:31,470
it's sag after insurance, not the
best insurance. And he's like,

1573
01:29:31,471 --> 01:29:34,080
I don't know what to do.
Um, and I'm like, okay,

1574
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:37,680
this is one of my best friends
and he's reaching out. I'm like,

1575
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:42,090
[inaudible] and I don't have any
experience with that. I mean,

1576
01:29:42,091 --> 01:29:44,610
I've had some bomber moments in my life,

1577
01:29:44,611 --> 01:29:46,860
but I would never say that I
was depressed. I'm, I'm pretty,

1578
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,660
pretty happy person depressed though, if
that bad moments. But I'm not a, I'm not,

1579
01:29:51,661 --> 01:29:54,990
I've never gone through depression.
I've never been down for like six months.

1580
01:29:54,991 --> 01:29:57,080
Couldn't get out of bed or
thought about suicide. No,

1581
01:29:57,081 --> 01:29:59,700
this is a scale of that shit.
He was,

1582
01:29:59,910 --> 01:30:04,230
he was on the dark end of the scale
and that's what he was thinking about

1583
01:30:04,231 --> 01:30:09,170
killing himself and trying to,
trying to not do it. So, um,

1584
01:30:09,240 --> 01:30:12,390
I just started making some
phone calls and I found, um,

1585
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:17,320
my business manager found the
best psychiatrist, like you said,

1586
01:30:17,321 --> 01:30:21,420
like this guy is a wizard. He's dealt
with a bunch of my clients before. He's,

1587
01:30:21,421 --> 01:30:24,810
he's helped out a lot.
It was very expensive.

1588
01:30:25,350 --> 01:30:28,740
So I just paid for it. Not to say just
to life. I just told Paul, no, I mean,

1589
01:30:28,741 --> 01:30:31,810
I'm thinking about it that way. I mean
for Ari, he couldn't afford it at all.

1590
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:35,430
So I always like, yeah, I'm sure a great
option. I can't afford this. You know,

1591
01:30:35,431 --> 01:30:36,810
he was getting by,

1592
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:41,560
I'm winning poker tournaments and getting
the occasional commercial goes this

1593
01:30:42,570 --> 01:30:46,620
quite a few years ago. I want
to say like 2000, I dunno,

1594
01:30:47,610 --> 01:30:51,240
it was quite a few years ago,
2004 some shit like that. I Dunno,

1595
01:30:51,390 --> 01:30:52,223
I don't remember when it was,

1596
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:56,700
but it was far enough back
where [inaudible] was really
struggling as a comedian.

1597
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,760
I mean I used talked about this publicly,
the otherwise I wouldn't talk.

1598
01:31:00,450 --> 01:31:02,370
That's why I brought it up that
he's talked about it publicly.

1599
01:31:02,371 --> 01:31:06,840
I'm not airing dirty laundry out there.
I love art.

1600
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:08,880
I mean,
I don't know what caused it.

1601
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:13,450
If it was that I can't stop
coughing today. Like my,

1602
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,640
my kids are sick as fuck my youngest
one and everyone gets it. Yeah.

1603
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:23,010
Um, he just, his career wasn't
going well cause he was, you know,

1604
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:27,100
it was just getting the ballroom really.
But I really think it was the show.

1605
01:31:27,340 --> 01:31:31,320
He don't you think he was the
perfect storm Propecia career?

1606
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:35,250
Who knows what's going on with his girl
and then it's just this fucking perfect

1607
01:31:35,251 --> 01:31:39,390
storm. The Propecia is making you
even more depressed. Like, dude,

1608
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:43,350
I'll think about killing myself. What the
fuck is going on right now? But anyway,

1609
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:47,670
so he pulled out of it, got
off the prepuce show, um,

1610
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:51,930
and then his career took the fuck
off. Right. He got on good medication,

1611
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,590
whatever the medication,
his new psychiatrist got him on,

1612
01:31:55,620 --> 01:32:00,370
worked like a charm and like he
was better. And like couple months,

1613
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:03,700
a couple months, he was like back
to Ari fucking around laughing.

1614
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,530
Then oddly enough,

1615
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:11,020
when it started working really well for
him, then his career started taking off.

1616
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:14,830
Right. Of course. That's how it works. I'm
a standup started taking off his career,

1617
01:32:14,831 --> 01:32:16,810
started taking off,
he became happier,

1618
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:21,010
got off the Propecia and then
weaned himself off the drugs.

1619
01:32:21,430 --> 01:32:24,790
And now he's good. Now he's good.
Yeah. That was great to see.

1620
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:27,550
But he smokes a lot of weed
and I always wonder like,

1621
01:32:27,790 --> 01:32:30,640
how much of that is self
medicating? Yep. But it's okay,

1622
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:33,940
but you smoke a ton of weed. It's not
a self medicating though, right? No,

1623
01:32:33,941 --> 01:32:37,840
I like it. I just like doing it then.
You're not a doctor. It makes you,

1624
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,260
it makes you vulnerable. It makes you
think about shit. It makes you nervous,

1625
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:41,830
like see,

1626
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:45,460
like makes you pause and you don't just
take things for granted when you get

1627
01:32:45,461 --> 01:32:48,340
high, you start thinking about, my
problem is I smoked the other night.

1628
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,620
I couldn't sleep in US
thinking about a lot of things.

1629
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:55,570
And then I got this thought in my head,
cause some weird shit man.

1630
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,380
Let's talk to uh, a thing I was
telling calendars that hate when my,

1631
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,430
when I think like this,

1632
01:33:01,270 --> 01:33:06,160
but I was in San Jose and I saw this mom
with two homeless kids and the it and

1633
01:33:06,220 --> 01:33:10,750
um, I was at the store and I was going
to buy an expensive sweater and I felt so

1634
01:33:10,751 --> 01:33:11,584
guilty.

1635
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:16,740
So when he got cash and gave this mom
bunch of cash and she started crying and

1636
01:33:16,941 --> 01:33:17,890
I'm like,
fuck man.

1637
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:22,630
And there's like this weird guy around
the kids and the kid was about my son's

1638
01:33:22,631 --> 01:33:26,260
age, about two sitting there, this
little girl. And I thought, I thought,

1639
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:29,140
I don't know why I had this random thought
once he grabbed her by the lake and

1640
01:33:29,141 --> 01:33:31,990
spiked on the ground. I don't
know why. I know, I know.

1641
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:35,670
And then I didn't and I gave her the cash
felt better cause there's more people

1642
01:33:35,671 --> 01:33:37,090
around. I'm like, no one's
gonna let that happen to a kid.

1643
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:40,060
And so that whole night fucked up at
it and its own reached out to him like,

1644
01:33:40,061 --> 01:33:42,880
dude, that's her side hustle. She does
that all the time. She's actually not,

1645
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:44,830
we've seen her like raise
those kids on the street.

1646
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:47,710
She gets picked up by her husband. It's
a shitty deal. So I'm like, all right,

1647
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:50,160
that's fine. Then I smoked
weed. Right. And I'm,

1648
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:54,040
I'm laying in bed and then I had this
visual so don't do that to my son.

1649
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,330
I got to sleep. I felt sick to my
stomach. Yeah, I know. It's weird.

1650
01:33:58,331 --> 01:34:00,610
Like sometimes we'd,
I can think if I think about a bid,

1651
01:34:00,611 --> 01:34:02,590
I think that some are
good on this cool road.

1652
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:06,680
But then if that creeps in there and
then it's like it get, it kept coming.

1653
01:34:06,681 --> 01:34:10,180
And it was so visual and I was like
sick to my stomach. I mean it's,

1654
01:34:10,181 --> 01:34:13,780
my son woke up at five and I fucking
beelined to his room and just like squeeze

1655
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:17,170
the fuck em for the rest of the morning.
It's hard man.

1656
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:21,310
Nobody knows how much you love a person,

1657
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:25,930
how much you can love a person until you
have a kid. Correct. Once one says that,

1658
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:29,020
everyone says that and I'm
like, okay, okay everyone.

1659
01:34:29,021 --> 01:34:31,150
I know you told me that Brian
till everyone told me this,

1660
01:34:31,570 --> 01:34:34,870
but then once you have a kid it's like,
I don't know man.

1661
01:34:34,871 --> 01:34:39,790
It's just a different animal where
now like when I see the shootings,

1662
01:34:39,940 --> 01:34:44,200
when I see, you know, the,
the, the nuclear war talk
with North Korea and Russia,

1663
01:34:44,410 --> 01:34:49,030
I think God and I see that a
lot of negativity on social
media, stuff like that.

1664
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:49,301
I'm like,

1665
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:52,810
the world is such a kind of a fucked
up place if you want to look into that

1666
01:34:52,811 --> 01:34:55,990
stuff. And when I have a kid, I
think about him like, God, man,

1667
01:34:56,410 --> 01:35:00,110
what's it going to be like when he's
like 16 or 18 like what kind of world is

1668
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,300
going to be when he's 18 of
I think too hard about it.

1669
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:05,810
That's when I'll get depressed. Well,
I think the world's going to be okay.

1670
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:09,340
I mean for sure. I don't mean to bring
this spot just down a bummer. No,

1671
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:11,810
but horrible things are going to
happen no matter what. Correct.

1672
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:16,460
But you know it changes who you are.
When you have a kid, it really does.

1673
01:35:16,700 --> 01:35:20,200
You're or you're a piece of shit
or you're sociopath and he's such.

1674
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:23,060
Just if you're around the kid enough,

1675
01:35:23,061 --> 01:35:25,620
it changes who you are and
if you're not around the kid,

1676
01:35:25,621 --> 01:35:28,550
it changes who you are because then you
realize you're not around the kid that's

1677
01:35:28,551 --> 01:35:32,600
going to take a piece out of who you think
you are. But you know what? If, if you,

1678
01:35:32,601 --> 01:35:36,470
if, and we have friends who aren't great
dads or whatever and you could see it in

1679
01:35:36,471 --> 01:35:38,060
their kids. I can I, and I'm,

1680
01:35:38,061 --> 01:35:41,090
I'm not slowing up psychologists
or I'm some expert in parenting,

1681
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,510
but if I go to a person's house and I see
the way the kids treat the pants, I go,

1682
01:35:44,720 --> 01:35:47,150
you're not around enough
man. I can, I promise you.

1683
01:35:47,151 --> 01:35:50,230
I can tell my son doesn't act
like that. Yeah, cause one thing,

1684
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:51,980
I bet you can call me whenever you want,
whenever you want.

1685
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:55,490
One thing I am is a beast of a dad. I
know that. I don't know if I'm get comic.

1686
01:35:55,700 --> 01:35:56,960
I don't know if I was a good fighter.

1687
01:35:57,080 --> 01:35:59,420
I don't want from good podcasts
are that's all up for debate.

1688
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:03,910
One thing I know is I'm a fucking good
dad man. Good for you man. That's a,

1689
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:08,540
it's a very, very, very, very
important quality and that quality.

1690
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:10,040
When your kid becomes an adult,

1691
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:14,660
that's going to be just a major factor
in how you get along. Know I give you,

1692
01:36:14,661 --> 01:36:15,650
I mean,
even parents,

1693
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,210
I know friends had had bad relationships
with their parents when they live with

1694
01:36:20,211 --> 01:36:22,430
them and then once they got out,
their parents were nice to them,

1695
01:36:22,670 --> 01:36:24,440
but the parents were shitty
to them when they were kids.

1696
01:36:24,560 --> 01:36:26,360
And they always hold it
against a whole week.

1697
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:28,310
They always have that shit in
the back of their head. Like,

1698
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,990
why were you a dick when I was 12?

1699
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:32,060
You know that that shit
is always in their head.

1700
01:36:32,061 --> 01:36:34,370
It's like that Avatar horse
when you're young, you,

1701
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:38,120
you mixed together and if you don't mix
together when you're young it, yeah.

1702
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:40,910
And I was talking to someone,
a, a therapist. They're saying,

1703
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,400
I think it's from like two,
they're three.

1704
01:36:43,610 --> 01:36:47,330
If you don't make that
connection when you're like,
oh, when they're for like, oh,

1705
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:50,720
I'll do it now. It's almost
too late because they already
developed these, this,

1706
01:36:50,721 --> 01:36:52,490
these brain pathways were like,
Nope,

1707
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:57,350
my dad's an ass and there's really
nothing I can do to fix it. Yeah, man.

1708
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,380
I went to the movies yesterday
with my kid, my movie. Uh,

1709
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:05,430
we went to see the GNOMEO and Juliet.
Oh yeah. What is it? A Sherlock gnomes.

1710
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:08,540
Yeah. That's you're like, no, I'm so
cute. Little movie. Yeah, but you know,

1711
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:11,420
we went to that synopsis place
where you know, you lean back,

1712
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:14,870
you know those things. Seats, lean
back, good food, and you take the uh,

1713
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:19,400
the seat rest down. And she just, my
seven year old just snuggles with Macbeth.

1714
01:37:19,550 --> 01:37:22,160
They're snuggling watching a movie.
I'm like, I couldn't be happier.

1715
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:25,700
I don't want to see the stupid fucking
movie. No, but I don't care. She wants to,

1716
01:37:25,850 --> 01:37:29,030
so I'm, I couldn't be happier.
I sat there and watched us.

1717
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:33,110
Silly knows shit movie. Yeah.
She just a little snuggle bunny.

1718
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:36,590
I've watched her last baby nine
times by time. Not a bad mood.

1719
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:39,200
And like a week though, that's pretty
funny movie then. I'm boss. Baby's great.

1720
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:43,210
Alcohol is the voice I watched like
nine times, but my son, whenever watch,

1721
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:45,710
he snuggled up when usually
this is why I want a daughter.

1722
01:37:45,711 --> 01:37:48,680
That's why I'm jealous you have daughters
because daughters loved their dads.

1723
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:53,750
My son. I'm like, you
little traitor mommy, mommy.

1724
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:56,080
Like, dude, it's me
every morning. Your car

1725
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:58,080
for your mom.
Crozer like that too.

1726
01:37:58,081 --> 01:38:03,081
And a lot of ways it's just you got to
accept the fact that the mom is not just

1727
01:38:03,121 --> 01:38:07,710
the soft sweet woman in the house,

1728
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:12,160
but she's also the person who made
them in her body and there's chemical

1729
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:17,040
connection of her body. Man. There's
no like I had to deal with my wife.

1730
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:19,980
Like I'm not naming any kids.
I go, I got veto power. I go,

1731
01:38:19,981 --> 01:38:24,750
but you do way more work. Like it's
way harder to make the person I go.

1732
01:38:24,751 --> 01:38:27,480
As long as you tried to call the kid
applesauce or something fucking stupid.

1733
01:38:27,481 --> 01:38:28,800
Yeah.
You know,

1734
01:38:28,801 --> 01:38:32,970
I just don't feel like
it's not even proposition.

1735
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,180
Oh I did this fucker,
we're going to do anyways.

1736
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,420
But now we all deal with the
seed. You know, you got a bonus,

1737
01:38:40,530 --> 01:38:44,190
a bonus overtime for you.
It is kinda crazy though,

1738
01:38:44,191 --> 01:38:48,930
that sex is how you make people I know
and everybody wants just wants to fuck

1739
01:38:48,931 --> 01:38:50,690
all the time and you want
to fuck a bunch of people.

1740
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:53,490
A lot of people don't want
kids. No. Hell No. You know,

1741
01:38:53,491 --> 01:38:56,030
who opened my eyes like in a big way,
uh,

1742
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:59,820
in a podcast recently that's really
been making me think a lot about this is

1743
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:04,070
Bret Weinstein. He's the, the professor
that gotten that. Do you know the, the,

1744
01:39:04,260 --> 01:39:07,860
you know, he is controversy with the
Evergreen universities and all that,

1745
01:39:07,861 --> 01:39:11,370
and they were taking the day,
it wasn't a pronoun thing.

1746
01:39:11,371 --> 01:39:14,400
It was the day of absence. They wanted
all the white people to stay home.

1747
01:39:14,401 --> 01:39:17,880
And he's like, that's racist.
Yeah. Anyway, he was on,

1748
01:39:17,881 --> 01:39:20,760
you said there's two different
things that men are attracted to.

1749
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:26,030
They're attracted to a woman that they
think would be a great companion and a

1750
01:39:26,491 --> 01:39:29,190
great mother.
And like someone who,

1751
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:32,310
he said there's a difference
between hot and beautiful. Correct.

1752
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:35,820
Like some women are beautiful and like
they're loving you want to be around them.

1753
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:36,871
I goes,

1754
01:39:36,871 --> 01:39:41,871
but then there's other women who are
just hot and in males that very receptive

1755
01:39:43,351 --> 01:39:45,570
woman who doesn't require any commitment,

1756
01:39:45,870 --> 01:39:50,010
was an opportunity for men to spread
their seed with someone who they didn't

1757
01:39:50,011 --> 01:39:52,110
have to be around for. Wow. Yeah.

1758
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:55,530
So there's literally like a
programming in a man's mind.

1759
01:39:55,710 --> 01:39:59,940
So you see a girl with big giant tits
and a little waist and a fat ass hanging

1760
01:39:59,941 --> 01:40:03,480
out of her shorts and she's got sloppy
makeup on and she looks at you and you're

1761
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:07,140
like, oh, okay, let's do
this. But that's what that is.

1762
01:40:07,141 --> 01:40:09,930
It's not like I live with her.
Right. You let, you're not saying,

1763
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,580
I would like to start a relationship
with you. It's like, no,

1764
01:40:11,581 --> 01:40:15,090
I want to shoot my load into you and then
you raise my kid when I'm nowhere near

1765
01:40:15,091 --> 01:40:19,580
you because it's an opportunity
for my DNA to propagate. Wow. Mike.

1766
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:21,270
So much sense.
It makes so much sense.

1767
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:24,720
I literally never considered it until
he brought it up on the podcast. I went,

1768
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:29,580
oh Duh. Me Neither. I just
thought she's hot. She's just hot,

1769
01:40:29,790 --> 01:40:34,710
dirty in a dirty way. Attracted to that.
Why is she so dirty? I told my girl,

1770
01:40:34,711 --> 01:40:37,970
Joe, I told my girl, Joe,
probably four weeks into it,

1771
01:40:37,971 --> 01:40:41,670
five weeks we were getting serious and
she got this job offer to go to Miami and

1772
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:44,460
she was talking about career
and stuff like that. And I
went, no, that's all cool.

1773
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:47,610
It's all I know one's career first
more than me. However, uh, you know,

1774
01:40:47,611 --> 01:40:49,230
you're put on the search to be a mom,
right?

1775
01:40:49,260 --> 01:40:52,380
Like you're going to be such a
beast of a mom. I guarantee you,

1776
01:40:52,381 --> 01:40:56,200
because I saw interact with Callan's
kids. I want, I can guarantee you,

1777
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:58,720
you might be the greatest
host in the world,

1778
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:02,110
but you're going to be the best mom I've
ever seen. And then she's like, really?

1779
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:06,830
I'm like, I guarantee you fucking Bam
Bam. Well that's just those qualities.

1780
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:10,810
They can see it's something. And when
someone's not, when someone's a bad mom,

1781
01:41:10,811 --> 01:41:13,750
it's such a depressed man.
Nothing worse.

1782
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:18,130
So depressing to be around women was like
really short with her kids and shitty

1783
01:41:18,131 --> 01:41:19,840
with them and like,
oh well even as a kid,

1784
01:41:19,841 --> 01:41:22,800
if I had friends who like talk back to
their parents are mean to their pants and

1785
01:41:22,801 --> 01:41:24,610
like, Oh God, what's wrong with you?

1786
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:27,370
If I was dating a girl she'd
like bad mouth their mom.

1787
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:29,940
Like what's wrong with you girl
on the hard thing is that pattern.

1788
01:41:29,941 --> 01:41:31,900
It's hard to break.
It's hard to break.

1789
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:35,710
Those kids may very well have that same
kind of behavior towards their heads.

1790
01:41:36,040 --> 01:41:39,670
Like when they become adults,
it's a hard pattern to break.

1791
01:41:39,671 --> 01:41:41,410
Sometimes you need the
right person in your life.

1792
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:44,930
It's like a good person in
your life that you, you know,

1793
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,130
a wife or husband or whoever it is.
You know when you,

1794
01:41:47,131 --> 01:41:50,500
you match up with that person,
I, it changes who you are too.

1795
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:54,570
That's what I always say that one of
the most important things about um,

1796
01:41:55,330 --> 01:41:59,440
community, like your community of friends.
Yeah. It's when you have good friends,

1797
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:02,770
those people change you.
Like you react.

1798
01:42:02,830 --> 01:42:07,720
Like everyone is your tribe.
You react like everyone's your friends.

1799
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:10,990
So you want good for them. You
love them, you care about them.

1800
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:15,020
They change who you are. They change
if they inspire you or they like it,

1801
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:18,010
whether they inspire you with being
smart or their kindness or what their

1802
01:42:18,190 --> 01:42:22,270
ambition, whatever it is that
we're, we're not individuals.

1803
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:26,140
We're a piece of a community
always and that community,

1804
01:42:26,141 --> 01:42:28,120
even if it's a small community
that you call a family,

1805
01:42:28,660 --> 01:42:32,100
that piece is dependent upon
who you do that piece with. A,

1806
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:37,090
you might be an amazing dad with the
right woman, but with the wrong woman,

1807
01:42:37,240 --> 01:42:41,440
you might be so frustrated with the
relationship that you're not as good a dad

1808
01:42:41,441 --> 01:42:43,990
is right now. There might be
chaos going on all the time.

1809
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:47,170
You might be situations you put the kid
in when you're yelling and screaming at

1810
01:42:47,171 --> 01:42:51,460
each other the kitchen and see all these
different factors that are dependent

1811
01:42:51,461 --> 01:42:55,360
upon your relationship with this other
person and they changed you and you

1812
01:42:55,361 --> 01:42:57,760
change them like you might
be the wrong person for them.

1813
01:42:57,910 --> 01:43:00,700
They might be super cool
and calm with someone else,

1814
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:04,190
but with you it's just not a mish.
It doesn't hit buttons for the reason.

1815
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:08,070
A woman saying to you, uh, you know,
you don't want an equal like, well,

1816
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:11,620
I don't want this. I don't want this. No,
I don't want this. You might be right,

1817
01:43:11,621 --> 01:43:13,630
but I know for sure I don't want that.
You're threatened.

1818
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:16,720
You threatened by a strong woman. No,
I'm threatened by you. You're just,

1819
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:18,280
you're aggressive for no reason.

1820
01:43:18,310 --> 01:43:21,700
Who the fuck has ever said
that you threatened by strong
man run by a strong man.

1821
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:26,470
Like shut up. Was he calling yourself
a strong man? Get the fuck Outta here.

1822
01:43:26,471 --> 01:43:31,120
Any guy who calls himself a strong man
like that shop most likely's up pitch.

1823
01:43:31,390 --> 01:43:33,510
Most likely.
It's just trying to prop himself.

1824
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:37,060
And I feel the same way about women who
say that women who were like, you know,

1825
01:43:37,061 --> 01:43:41,590
you're scared of a strong
woman. Like, okay, am I really
or are you a cocked? Yup.

1826
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:44,830
Oh, are you a call? Just a
raging cause this can talk.

1827
01:43:44,831 --> 01:43:49,480
This sounds like this guy can't talk
around. Again, super uncomfortable.

1828
01:43:49,481 --> 01:43:52,250
I don't know what got us to this,
but whatever I did

1829
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:55,490
please, I'll apologize. But
I also feel like in, in,

1830
01:43:55,491 --> 01:43:59,930
in this community of friends that were
talking about if you are a shit father,

1831
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:05,180
it would show elsewhere in your life
around us or if we're at the comedy store

1832
01:44:05,401 --> 01:44:08,300
where a restaurant or in your,
in your social media,

1833
01:44:08,301 --> 01:44:11,960
it's going to come out one way or another,
you know, tough to be in that group.

1834
01:44:12,020 --> 01:44:16,040
You know the expression, how you do one
thing is how you do everything. Yes. Yeah,

1835
01:44:16,580 --> 01:44:18,560
yeah.
I think there's something to that.

1836
01:44:18,561 --> 01:44:21,320
I mean obviously there's people that
are really good at one thing and suck at

1837
01:44:21,321 --> 01:44:25,070
other things. So it's not a, it's
not always a hundred percent correct.

1838
01:44:25,071 --> 01:44:29,540
But you know, if you're a
shitty dad, you're going to
be a shitty friend. I agree.

1839
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:31,750
And if you're a shitty friend, you're
probably going to be shitty. Dad and I,

1840
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:32,900
and I say this too,

1841
01:44:32,901 --> 01:44:37,610
with like with due to our shitty
debt dads, it's like right.

1842
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:40,520
If you're willing to do that to your,
literally your connect to this person,

1843
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:44,030
chemically, they're, they're made of your
DNA. If you're on a treat him like that.

1844
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:47,530
When the going gets rough for me, where
the fuck are you going to be? Right.

1845
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:51,350
There's no way I want you to my
foxhole. Yeah, that's big man.

1846
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:54,440
And then people that don't,
they don't understand that.

1847
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:58,450
They don't understand what they're doing
wrong. That's rough too. The bummer.

1848
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:01,610
The people that can't see it and he tried
to explain it to them and they can't

1849
01:45:01,611 --> 01:45:05,990
see it. The one thing people will put up
with those, and I would never do this,

1850
01:45:05,991 --> 01:45:08,960
but if you give someone parenting
advice, just doesn't, there's just,

1851
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:11,240
there's certain things you can't
talk about. Usually politics,

1852
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:12,530
religion and parenting.

1853
01:45:12,650 --> 01:45:17,650
The only way I think parenting advice
works ever is if you talk about one great

1854
01:45:18,471 --> 01:45:22,220
thing that you found that you do with
your kid without criticizing another pass,

1855
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:23,080
you can,

1856
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:27,230
you could give them advice but not give
them advice by like you can relay your

1857
01:45:27,231 --> 01:45:31,940
personal positive experiences and
either they take it or they don't.

1858
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:33,260
But as soon as you start saying,
hey man,

1859
01:45:33,261 --> 01:45:35,360
I see how you talk to your
son and you're like, what?

1860
01:45:35,510 --> 01:45:39,440
What the fuck did you say people
get? Your son is uh, you know,

1861
01:45:39,441 --> 01:45:42,470
he's an individual man. You treat
her like an object. Like fuck,

1862
01:45:42,471 --> 01:45:46,040
I don't fucking treat my son
like all the time came over.

1863
01:45:46,070 --> 01:45:48,640
He's not even listening. What
you said you're all ramping. I A,

1864
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:52,880
my son was one and a half at the
time and I was taken to this,

1865
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:54,860
this play area and he,
you know,

1866
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:58,400
he did not express himself and everyone
was older and you hit kids and he's a

1867
01:45:58,401 --> 01:46:02,090
big kid. He's a 99% tile
for size and all that stuff.

1868
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,850
And he would hit kids and the,

1869
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,290
the place where I was taking him in
Brentwood knew I was a former fighter.

1870
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:11,480
One of the guys who works
front desk as a fan.

1871
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:16,040
I've talked MMA with them and they
took me to the side and said, you know,

1872
01:46:16,041 --> 01:46:20,360
we got a bit of a problem because tiger
is a hitting kids and we think it's in

1873
01:46:20,361 --> 01:46:23,890
direct correlation of you let
them watch fights. And from,

1874
01:46:25,100 --> 01:46:28,080
I just started laughing, you
guys are silly as fuck. Hey,

1875
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:32,320
I'm never bring them back. B. He's
one to a half. Anyone else in there?

1876
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:34,310
Three. I mean, yeah,

1877
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:36,690
he cold cocked that kid with a
left hook and I'm proud of them.

1878
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,690
I could took his toy. However, it's
just, this is what kids do. They hit man.

1879
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:44,800
It's nothing that we, and I tell him,
no, I'm stay on top of my helicopter.

1880
01:46:44,801 --> 01:46:46,960
The parent the fuck get him
when he's in there, but these,

1881
01:46:46,970 --> 01:46:50,610
these one and a half there were
some are older and have, trust me.

1882
01:46:50,611 --> 01:46:55,090
He's not watching UFC.
It's not has nothing to the side.

1883
01:46:55,620 --> 01:46:59,820
This lady was like that. You have fc or
whatever you're getting into. I was like,

1884
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:02,610
oh my God,
this is some Brentwood shit lady.

1885
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:06,720
There's a lot of shit right now. All
right, yellow, yellow, meet dirt.

1886
01:47:06,810 --> 01:47:08,190
If they hit each other,
they hate each other.

1887
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:13,020
We're concerned that you
constantly reaffirming his
gender without him choosing

1888
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:14,790
were concerned.

1889
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:19,770
I was reading something about some lady
on a three year old trans kid. I'm like,

1890
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:23,010
oh my God.
How about are you sure?

1891
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,650
Are you positive and not
just a kid? You're three. Oh,

1892
01:47:25,651 --> 01:47:27,150
you mean the how he's into cars this week.

1893
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:30,300
Next week he's me and trolls and he went
chop his dick off while they were like,

1894
01:47:30,301 --> 01:47:34,840
this article was like really
super positive about it. Ah, ah.

1895
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:39,240
Bringing the kid to therapy and
shit and aiding his transition.

1896
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:43,050
My keys fucking three in this. I just
read this like two days ago. I was like,

1897
01:47:43,051 --> 01:47:45,740
this is so nuts. There's so much
that it's going on right now. Yeah.

1898
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:48,340
And I want to be a transformed when
us three you don't see my dad punched

1899
01:47:48,350 --> 01:47:50,280
fucking mechanicals arms on me.

1900
01:47:50,340 --> 01:47:55,050
Imagine if I was three arms mean
I'm 19 like what the Fuck Dad?

1901
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:58,770
Why am I a robot now? Well, when you're
three told us you wanted to be a robot,

1902
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:03,780
it's the same shit. It's the same shit.
It's crazy. It's insane. It's so weird.

1903
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:07,770
It's so weird that people are just
openly jumping into this and it's these

1904
01:48:07,771 --> 01:48:10,370
weirdo super,
you know,

1905
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:12,840
ideological progressive people that just,

1906
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:17,340
they're locked into this idea that it's
amazing to have a trans kid and you know,

1907
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:22,350
the kid shows any sign whatsoever of being
inclining to be female or inclined to

1908
01:48:22,351 --> 01:48:26,910
be mailed. They're pushing
it. I'm like, Oh God, I feel
like this actually bad. Well,

1909
01:48:26,911 --> 01:48:29,490
it's also very dangerous because they
start wanting to fuck with the kids

1910
01:48:29,491 --> 01:48:34,190
hormones. Like you got to let the child
develop. There's no real science and,

1911
01:48:34,191 --> 01:48:36,810
and what the fuck happens when
you put hormone blockers new,

1912
01:48:36,811 --> 01:48:38,940
a three year old and try to
transition them into a girl,

1913
01:48:38,941 --> 01:48:41,940
but also the real doctors,
you know what the hell they're doing.

1914
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:44,700
They're not going to inject that kid
with hormones. So we can say, listen,

1915
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:48,570
if you want to do this when you're
1819 even then it's a little too early.

1916
01:48:48,571 --> 01:48:51,660
But when you're 21 which is
again, it's too early. The,

1917
01:48:51,661 --> 01:48:54,810
and I've seen this on some of the
bullshit reality TV shows that much,

1918
01:48:54,811 --> 01:48:57,210
but these legit doctorial then
I'm willing to help you out.

1919
01:48:57,300 --> 01:49:00,420
But before then get out of here.
No, get out. Let's see where yet.

1920
01:49:00,420 --> 01:49:02,340
When you're 16th there's a market for it,

1921
01:49:02,341 --> 01:49:05,460
which is a cruel thing to say
in a weird way to describe it,

1922
01:49:05,461 --> 01:49:07,980
but here's the problem, John. We
were, we were talking about, you know,

1923
01:49:07,981 --> 01:49:10,470
on the spectrum,
for some of those kids,

1924
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,910
they do feel like they're trapped
in a woman's body, you know?

1925
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:15,750
And I feel for them that must suck to
go through high school and all that.

1926
01:49:16,050 --> 01:49:18,540
But isn't that the exception?
You know what I'm saying?

1927
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:20,770
Like is that kit the
exception that feels like,

1928
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:24,840
and they should have access to it. How
could you do that with a three year old?

1929
01:49:24,870 --> 01:49:28,410
I know. I mean, how do you know? I mean,
you just don't, and anybody says he do.

1930
01:49:28,411 --> 01:49:32,530
Your crazy people change. You change
when hormones get entered into your body.

1931
01:49:32,531 --> 01:49:34,470
And maybe you won't be the most
masculine man in the world.

1932
01:49:34,471 --> 01:49:37,110
And maybe you will turn
into a woman someday maybe,

1933
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:41,100
but give yourself a goddamn
chance to just exist.

1934
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:43,350
Do you see the high school wrestler?
Yes.

1935
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:47,290
The girl just beaten up right in that
and then she waved to test booze like gay

1936
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:48,133
motherfucker.

1937
01:49:48,550 --> 01:49:49,420
I know it's not fair.

1938
01:49:49,570 --> 01:49:52,780
She should be able to out to a Russell
Ball or he should be allowed to wrestle

1939
01:49:52,781 --> 01:49:55,960
boys, you know? But you know,
whatever, man. It's crazy. You're,

1940
01:49:55,961 --> 01:49:58,660
you're taking a high school girl and
you're filling her up with testosterone,

1941
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:01,270
with injections,
what?

1942
01:50:01,650 --> 01:50:05,140
It's nuts and then you're allowing
her to wrestle girls that aren't on

1943
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:07,450
testosterone. It's fucking cheating. Okay.

1944
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:12,540
If she was just a girl and she wasn't
like trying to transition into a man and

1945
01:50:12,971 --> 01:50:16,570
they found out that she was winning the
state championship as a woman or as a

1946
01:50:16,571 --> 01:50:20,090
girl, rather by taking steroids,
they would take it away from it.

1947
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:23,260
She would say she's cheating. Sued.
They'd be, there'd be an uproar,

1948
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:28,030
but some shit not let her
wrestle. Yes. Not let her wrestle.

1949
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,500
Wrestle at all levels.
If they go,

1950
01:50:29,501 --> 01:50:32,830
we can't wrestle with the boys
and just can't rest that all,

1951
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:36,910
we'll get to wrestle. The boys don't
wrestle. I would say she, that's what she,

1952
01:50:36,911 --> 01:50:40,700
he wants he, what's the
rest of the boys? They

1953
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:47,020
zero reserves. Um, yeah.
I, I think it, hey, if you,

1954
01:50:47,021 --> 01:50:51,220
if you're going to choose to go that
path of this transitioning to a female,

1955
01:50:51,550 --> 01:50:54,640
then you give up your right to wrestle
because we don't have a division for that

1956
01:50:54,641 --> 01:50:56,520
vet and get,
and we don't have enough wrestling.

1957
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:00,680
She's transitioning to he and
it's just, it's not fair. It was,

1958
01:51:00,681 --> 01:51:01,780
if it was the other way,

1959
01:51:01,781 --> 01:51:06,130
it would be more fair because like if
you're a man and you're transitioning to

1960
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:09,670
be a woman and they make you wrestle
men while you're going to be at a

1961
01:51:09,671 --> 01:51:14,110
disadvantage because you are
taking hormone blockers or
you're getting castrated,

1962
01:51:14,111 --> 01:51:16,810
you're losing your test to goals,
your whatever, whatever it is,

1963
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:19,620
you are at a disadvantage in that aspect.
Yeah.

1964
01:51:19,660 --> 01:51:22,420
He's at a disadvantage
now transitioning to,

1965
01:51:22,540 --> 01:51:26,480
I mean he's at an a massive advantage
right now. Transitioning to a man there.

1966
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:29,000
He's on steroids.
You going up the kids on steroids?

1967
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:32,530
100% and probably a lot of them probably
a lot of it because they're trying to

1968
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:35,680
turn him into a man.
Correct. It's all nuts.

1969
01:51:35,681 --> 01:51:37,540
But I know like where
was this 30 years ago?

1970
01:51:37,541 --> 01:51:40,690
It was it just like a silent epidemic.
There's everyone just under cover.

1971
01:51:40,691 --> 01:51:43,600
It was like, God, I feel like a woman,
you know, there was a few of those.

1972
01:51:43,660 --> 01:51:46,400
There was like that one guy,
Renee Richards that uh,

1973
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:50,050
the tennis player that
wound up transitioning.

1974
01:51:50,051 --> 01:51:52,060
He was a terrible male tennis player,

1975
01:51:52,270 --> 01:51:56,560
transitioned to a female tennis player
and start dominating that Joanna man,

1976
01:51:56,710 --> 01:52:00,160
that's the plot of Joanna man
tennis addition. Now that movie, No,

1977
01:52:00,161 --> 01:52:02,170
it was do you want them to want a man?
Was the guy who couldn't,

1978
01:52:02,171 --> 01:52:05,680
he get suspended from like the Lakers, the
fake Lakers in the movie. So he's like,

1979
01:52:05,681 --> 01:52:07,990
God, I want to play basketball. So
like you could make the women's team,

1980
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:11,950
he just wore a wig and put TVs on
us. Started dunking on bitches. Well,

1981
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:16,360
that does happen today. There was a guy
who was ready for this 50 years old.

1982
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:20,050
He was six foot four or five,

1983
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:25,530
played women's college basketball
because he played as a man.

1984
01:52:25,900 --> 01:52:30,820
But now he's not a man anymore. Now this
fool is a fucking woman. He's a fool.

1985
01:52:30,920 --> 01:52:34,540
And you went back and you're 50 years
old and you're pretending to be a college

1986
01:52:34,541 --> 01:52:38,110
girl and be like, I'm in a
fantasy. Where is my fantasy?

1987
01:52:38,290 --> 01:52:41,890
And she's a giant and she's swatting
basketballs out of people's hands.

1988
01:52:41,950 --> 01:52:43,690
There's Joanna man.
Yeah.

1989
01:52:44,170 --> 01:52:49,170
See if you could find guy who played it
was 50 type in 50 year old transsexual

1990
01:52:50,091 --> 01:52:52,670
man,
transsexual plays,

1991
01:52:52,940 --> 01:52:56,990
women's college bath in America, right?
Yeah. In America. Well, here's the thing.

1992
01:52:57,650 --> 01:53:02,650
Imagine if your kid is on a team with
that person and that person takes your

1993
01:53:04,731 --> 01:53:08,930
kids scholarship, takes your
kids. Look at that right there.

1994
01:53:10,240 --> 01:53:11,660
Aw,
seriously.

1995
01:53:11,950 --> 01:53:16,950
Gi Yak jacked and got 50 year old knows
on them and became a college basketball

1996
01:53:18,771 --> 01:53:23,120
player at fucking might get the
fuck out of here. 52 excuse me,

1997
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:26,510
Gabriel Ludwig [inaudible] 52.
Okay.

1998
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:30,770
Two years old than me goes
to college and she ball. Uh,

1999
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,890
I think she played as a man.
Look at that size difference.

2000
01:53:34,010 --> 01:53:38,510
Now imagine your kid is competing
against her and it can't get a shot off.

2001
01:53:38,540 --> 01:53:41,090
Can't get a Shaquille O'Neal
and it's just bullshit.

2002
01:53:41,091 --> 01:53:43,610
It's like if Shaquille O'Neal
was playing on that other team,

2003
01:53:43,820 --> 01:53:47,390
if Shaquille O'Neal transition to be a
woman and decided to go back to college,

2004
01:53:47,660 --> 01:53:51,770
this college would let her play as
a woman. That's Shaquille O'Neal.

2005
01:53:51,771 --> 01:53:56,420
I was a woman. What colleges? That
douche bag university. I Dunno.

2006
01:53:56,490 --> 01:54:00,200
I don't wanna I don't want to give
him any press. Press makes me sick.

2007
01:54:01,650 --> 01:54:06,650
I mean that's a giant man with tits.
It's straight nonsense.

2008
01:54:06,740 --> 01:54:09,510
It's straight nonsense.
This is where she good ball play.

2009
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:13,520
This is where progressiveness
goes down the rabbit hole.

2010
01:54:14,360 --> 01:54:17,180
What does it mission college.
That's probably a juco. Huh?

2011
01:54:17,630 --> 01:54:19,850
I don't know what it is but it gets,
it could suck it.

2012
01:54:20,090 --> 01:54:24,510
It can suck a nonexisting ticket.
Well interesting thing.

2013
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:27,530
She played college basketball for
30 years ago as a man. I said,

2014
01:54:27,560 --> 01:54:30,590
how does she still have eligibility? Cause
she's a woman now. That's what I said.

2015
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:33,830
But she'll transition. They let
her, they let her transition.

2016
01:54:34,010 --> 01:54:37,160
And when you're transitioning,
you go back. Now you're a woman.

2017
01:54:37,161 --> 01:54:38,840
You don't have a history
of playing as a woman.

2018
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:42,190
So now you're allowed to play it again
for five more years of college. Yep, Yep.

2019
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:44,450
Too. I feel like a lot more
ask you got to do this.

2020
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,930
There's a few that would do
it. Oh, hundred percent. Oh,

2021
01:54:47,931 --> 01:54:50,400
Dana White was joking around about
that. Like, I know a few guys,

2022
01:54:50,401 --> 01:54:53,480
if it could be a world champion, they'd
cut the dick off. There's a few gaps.

2023
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:58,130
There are some guys who by all means
this too, it's crazy to even suggest,

2024
01:54:58,340 --> 01:55:00,440
but so is walking into youtube,

2025
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:03,820
shooting a bunch of people
and then shooting yourself
in the chest. That's crazy.

2026
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:07,730
Suggest too, that he fucking mind. That
bitch was definitely out of her mind.

2027
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,670
And also if you saw U two video, no one
or you can made no fucking money lead.

2028
01:55:11,671 --> 01:55:16,610
Those videos were terrible. Well, there's
something wrong with that ladies brain.

2029
01:55:16,640 --> 01:55:20,150
How about her dad goes, uh, warned the
police. I can guess need to check her out.

2030
01:55:20,151 --> 01:55:22,820
She didn't do something bad to youtube.
There's some, some issues here,

2031
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:26,900
but if you're a cop and they did find
her the night before at 2:00 AM cause she

2032
01:55:26,901 --> 01:55:29,060
went missing. They found
her and they're like, yeah,

2033
01:55:29,061 --> 01:55:31,070
she doesn't seem like she's gonna
hurt herself or anyone else.

2034
01:55:31,071 --> 01:55:33,980
I don't know where you want us to do.
Like we found her, she sits, she's good.

2035
01:55:33,981 --> 01:55:36,260
She's sleeping in her car
until someone does something.

2036
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:39,770
It's so hard to do anything about it.
Like they um,

2037
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:44,760
they sent that one college kid, they're
sending him back. They found, uh,

2038
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:47,130
his roommates. I was, we were
talking about it yesterday.

2039
01:55:47,131 --> 01:55:49,980
His roommates were talking about and
there were seriously worried about him.

2040
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:54,540
He had bleached his hair,
blonde start stockpiling ammunition,

2041
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:55,501
bought an assault,

2042
01:55:55,501 --> 01:56:00,501
gone and then the cops came to
visit him and after the cops left,

2043
01:56:00,571 --> 01:56:03,840
he went out and bought another ar and
they're like, okay, okay. That's it.

2044
01:56:03,980 --> 01:56:05,640
And they are, we got it. We
got to do something about this.

2045
01:56:05,641 --> 01:56:06,810
His roommates are freaking out.

2046
01:56:06,811 --> 01:56:08,220
Like people are freaking
out being around the guy.

2047
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:12,720
And they sent him back on a technicality
because he wasn't going to school cause

2048
01:56:12,721 --> 01:56:15,300
he stopped going to class.
So what can you do a student visa?

2049
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:19,800
What the fuck can you do? They deported
them. Oh really? Yeah. Oh perfect. Yeah.

2050
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:22,590
And they said, we think we prevented
the tragedy. I love that. Yeah,

2051
01:56:22,620 --> 01:56:25,140
that's exactly what they should
do. But however, would this lady,

2052
01:56:25,141 --> 01:56:26,730
let's say they stopped
at two in the morning,

2053
01:56:26,731 --> 01:56:31,320
she's in a car and the PA and the
Dad, the dad who, you know, uh,

2054
01:56:31,330 --> 01:56:35,670
she came from, his seat goes, listen,
she, she, she's going to do something bad.

2055
01:56:35,850 --> 01:56:39,090
We think we've seen signs.
We've known her since she was a day old.

2056
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:41,970
You guys should do something about it.
I don't think you should go out.

2057
01:56:41,971 --> 01:56:45,640
We talked to her, it seems
all right. Maybe take her
in for the night. Do though.

2058
01:56:46,070 --> 01:56:47,100
Talk to the therapist.

2059
01:56:47,101 --> 01:56:50,490
But if she doesn't do anything and
then she does like people are so

2060
01:56:50,491 --> 01:56:53,970
unpredictable and get those eyebrows and
class or in jail for that video of her

2061
01:56:53,971 --> 01:56:55,530
doing those squats and the jumps,

2062
01:56:55,531 --> 01:56:59,700
the workout video to hairball of
those eyes crazy that she's not there.

2063
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:03,210
She was a different plant horror movie
and then, but then, and then she's mad.

2064
01:57:03,211 --> 01:57:06,800
She's not getting fricking revenue
from the Youtube and youtube like ah,

2065
01:57:06,810 --> 01:57:09,090
your videos suck lady.
We have nothing to do with it.

2066
01:57:09,630 --> 01:57:13,650
You didn't come up in the open mic circuit
so you don't have a phd in Psychos.

2067
01:57:15,640 --> 01:57:17,310
Like he,
Tony Hinchcliffe,

2068
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:20,520
all these dudes that have been
in the grind like I remember

2069
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:25,620
a long time ago,
but they're fucking crazy people.

2070
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:29,160
There's a certain amount of open Microsoft
think that they're really funny and

2071
01:57:29,161 --> 01:57:32,200
they can't get work and they're angry
about it and they're really fucking crazy.

2072
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:34,590
Get on killed Tony, when I've
been in like two, three times.

2073
01:57:34,591 --> 01:57:37,740
Perfect example till Tony is a primary
example. You go there and you're like,

2074
01:57:37,741 --> 01:57:39,200
what in the fuck am I watching?

2075
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:42,360
And if someone tries to tell that person
like maybe you should connect more with

2076
01:57:42,361 --> 01:57:47,280
the crop. I connect, we get mad. This
is my best bit. He's pitcher. Good bits.

2077
01:57:47,281 --> 01:57:50,220
And the people were like, what in the Tony
told one guy like, dude, you're bombing.

2078
01:57:50,221 --> 01:57:51,930
He goes, they were
laughing. They're laughing.

2079
01:57:51,931 --> 01:57:53,100
They laughing at you until you those,

2080
01:57:53,300 --> 01:57:56,730
they're laughing cause you're fucking
terrible and we're making faces behind.

2081
01:57:56,731 --> 01:57:59,540
He goes, that's laughing. You don't know
what the fuck you're talking about, Tony.

2082
01:57:59,541 --> 01:58:04,320
He's like, get off the stage. He's like,
make me. It's like, oh my God, boy.

2083
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:08,490
Yeah, but you see, you see
that too on American idol,

2084
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:11,520
there'll be some crazy dude like,
my mom thinks I'm the best,

2085
01:58:11,521 --> 01:58:12,354
you know the best things,

2086
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:17,040
Lionel Richie and they get up and it just
completely bomb and they cock shit to

2087
01:58:17,041 --> 01:58:19,920
the experts. You guys just
don't know what you want. Well,

2088
01:58:19,921 --> 01:58:22,730
you have to look at people as a whole.
Right now,

2089
01:58:22,731 --> 01:58:25,320
if you look at people as a
whole, like physically, right?

2090
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:27,870
There's people that have built like you
and there's people that have built like

2091
01:58:27,871 --> 01:58:32,250
Vern Troyer. That's just a fact. It's,
it's tough. It's tough. It's tough.

2092
01:58:32,660 --> 01:58:36,300
It's also brilliant mind.
But my point is it's come on seven.

2093
01:58:36,330 --> 01:58:38,400
It's a roll of the dice.
That's the same thing with everything.

2094
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:43,060
It's the same thing with your mind as
well. It just is. The mine varies widely.

2095
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:47,790
It varies racially. It varies
interracially it varies. Uh,

2096
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:48,680
age wise.

2097
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:53,590
Like you can have a 50 year old black
guy that's a smart guy you ever met in

2098
01:58:53,591 --> 01:58:56,770
your life and you're going to have a
50 year old white guy who is a fucking

2099
01:58:56,771 --> 01:59:00,880
moron and you're going to have a 50
year old woman who is out of our fucking

2100
01:59:00,881 --> 01:59:05,740
mind and you're going to have a 50 year
old woman who's a brilliant physicist

2101
01:59:05,741 --> 01:59:08,350
and you're gonna have everything.
You have, every combination,

2102
01:59:08,530 --> 01:59:10,760
every combination of smart and stupid and,

2103
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:13,660
and the tall and thin people vary.

2104
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:18,490
But they also vary with how crazy
they are. But also that's a variable.

2105
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:22,090
I think some people are crazy and then
they find a passion. They run with it.

2106
01:59:22,091 --> 01:59:23,380
Maybe it's music,
comedy,

2107
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:28,480
but then some of those crazy people who
are different than the others in high

2108
01:59:28,481 --> 01:59:29,440
school get made fun of,

2109
01:59:29,441 --> 01:59:33,040
get bullied and then that craziness turns
into darkness and then they get ahold

2110
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:36,490
of Ak 47 then that's when you
get the mass shootings. Oh yeah.

2111
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:39,520
Cause there's experiences with those
crazy people and maybe they turned the

2112
01:59:39,521 --> 01:59:42,250
right direction and they do
something great. Write great songs,

2113
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:45,670
come up with a great bid or come up
with a great TV show or that person gets

2114
01:59:45,671 --> 01:59:48,550
bullied so bad, the direction
they go. It's dark. It's fun.

2115
01:59:48,551 --> 01:59:53,140
Hundred percent crazy mind does crazy
stuff. Yeah. So 100% physical abuse,

2116
01:59:53,141 --> 01:59:57,210
sexual abuse along with that medications.
Sure.

2117
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:58,580
Medications can do it and it's all,

2118
01:59:58,650 --> 02:00:00,940
I mean every single mass
shooters on medications.

2119
02:00:01,240 --> 02:00:03,940
But when you look at the combination
of all the different factors,

2120
02:00:03,941 --> 02:00:07,660
it's like when you see that lady crying
in her car to clock in the morning,

2121
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:09,520
you're a cop, you don't know
what to do. What do you,

2122
02:00:09,521 --> 02:00:11,080
what do you think you
think she's going to like?

2123
02:00:11,081 --> 02:00:13,660
I knew when I looked at her that she
was going to go on to youtube and shoot

2124
02:00:13,661 --> 02:00:16,030
that place up. Now there's no way,
you know, there's no way. Nope.

2125
02:00:16,220 --> 02:00:17,740
How close cruise kids,
same thing.

2126
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:21,430
They came to see him two years before
they decided he wasn't a threat.

2127
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:25,060
And the people like the
FBI's and competent know 24
months later, first of all,

2128
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:28,870
he probably got fucking crazier,
crazy, right? In 24 months.

2129
02:00:28,930 --> 02:00:31,630
His mom wound up dying like
six months before that.

2130
02:00:31,631 --> 02:00:34,570
So that probably fucked him up too.
There's probably a whole host of factors.

2131
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,760
Right.
But he never did it before.

2132
02:00:36,761 --> 02:00:40,710
How the fuck can you predict
these random shooters? It's how,

2133
02:00:40,830 --> 02:00:42,100
I don't know what you're going to do.

2134
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,640
The only thing with the Youtube
thing is if the dad goes, listen, my,

2135
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:50,080
you can do something crazy and
they find her near the Youtube, uh,

2136
02:00:50,110 --> 02:00:53,320
northern California offices, we should
at least take her in for the night,

2137
02:00:53,321 --> 02:00:57,820
talk to her. And that's the leash.
You're not gonna lose anything.

2138
02:00:57,850 --> 02:01:00,820
Taxpayers be happy to pay for a night in
there, you know, it's all, it's all good.

2139
02:01:01,060 --> 02:01:03,520
Yeah. I mean, I don't know if
that would do it though. You know?

2140
02:01:03,521 --> 02:01:08,360
It's like that lady just seemed fucking
nuts, man. Someone saw and said, uh,

2141
02:01:08,470 --> 02:01:11,710
someone posted it and said,
be ready to never sleep again.

2142
02:01:14,350 --> 02:01:19,210
That'd be didn't scare me that much. Yeah.
50 I went, oh, she's bat shit crazy. Yeah.

2143
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:23,560
Like super duper batshit crazy.
Youtube was out for,

2144
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:27,100
cause she was,
her views were lowering one video though.

2145
02:01:27,101 --> 02:01:32,090
She had 45 views. It's like, come
on man. It's fucking bananas, man.

2146
02:01:32,170 --> 02:01:35,170
I'm sure they pull her youtube
pages by now, Jamie. Yeah.

2147
02:01:35,620 --> 02:01:39,010
And how if you're going to go out,
right? Most people do it to the head.

2148
02:01:39,260 --> 02:01:40,190
She shot herself

2149
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:41,480
in the chest.

2150
02:01:44,490 --> 02:01:48,750
That's dot savage. That's dark.
That's a dark way to go. Okay.

2151
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:50,071
The people have done that.

2152
02:01:50,071 --> 02:01:54,120
I guess people that knew they were brain
was going to get junior say I did that

2153
02:01:54,121 --> 02:01:55,560
show himself in the chest because he goes,

2154
02:01:55,561 --> 02:01:57,390
I want you to stay in my
brain because it's not good.

2155
02:01:58,490 --> 02:02:00,080
Fuck yeah.

2156
02:02:00,470 --> 02:02:04,160
I can't feel good. No, I feel like
the brain bee was, yeah, we went dark.

2157
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:05,990
We can we talk. We got to bring
it back. We've gotten dark,

2158
02:02:05,991 --> 02:02:08,060
this punk to bring it back.
Let's bring it home.

2159
02:02:08,120 --> 02:02:11,820
It's bring him home on a positive thing,
but you don't stop roles, Doug Rau.

2160
02:02:11,821 --> 02:02:14,960
That's a fight. No one's talking
about you, Ana rose. Hey Jamie.

2161
02:02:14,961 --> 02:02:19,430
Tell 'em homeboys got to watch the
Monitor. All right. Yeah. Um, yeah.

2162
02:02:19,431 --> 02:02:23,150
Talk rose. It's being overshadowed.
Yeah, it has been overshadowed.

2163
02:02:23,151 --> 02:02:24,140
It's a crazy one,
right?

2164
02:02:24,160 --> 02:02:28,640
It's because nobody expected it to go
down the way it did in the first one,

2165
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:34,250
you know, not at all. And the rematch
you on is on weight. She's way lighter.

2166
02:02:34,310 --> 02:02:38,420
She was one 22 last week, you know,
so she's just a few pounds away.

2167
02:02:38,450 --> 02:02:43,090
Here's my problem with this
fight and uh, I hit, I might,

2168
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:45,320
I might stop making pigs.
I sat on a podcast yesterday.

2169
02:02:45,340 --> 02:02:47,540
It doesn't make me feel good
when I pick gets people,

2170
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:50,210
it doesn't make me feel good.
I feel like I have to do it.

2171
02:02:50,720 --> 02:02:52,850
A lot of people don't do pigs
and they come to me for pigs.

2172
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,840
What do you think's gonna Happen?
Uh, for a long time I thought,

2173
02:02:57,870 --> 02:03:01,260
oof. Rose Rose, she's a monster
and I know rose right from Denver.

2174
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:04,980
She landed that left Hook
and Trevor teaches that and
Pat Barry teaches that and

2175
02:03:04,981 --> 02:03:08,990
that's exactly one to do. Amazing
fight. I bet they fight, you know,

2176
02:03:09,030 --> 02:03:11,670
three or four times,
but if they do a rematch,

2177
02:03:11,671 --> 02:03:14,360
which they should give you
on the immediate rematch, me,

2178
02:03:14,361 --> 02:03:17,010
a little bit of trouble cause
you on is a fucking machine.

2179
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:20,820
Here's the caveat to that. When I see
you on a do interviews and she goes,

2180
02:03:20,970 --> 02:03:24,450
it was my nutritionist. It was this
person, it was this, it was this.

2181
02:03:24,660 --> 02:03:27,660
She never once has she owned it
and taking credibility. I go,

2182
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:31,470
that's not the way a world champion
speaks. That's not the way it all.

2183
02:03:31,471 --> 02:03:35,040
Someone talks and when I see
a bunch of excuse go, Oh shit,

2184
02:03:35,340 --> 02:03:37,350
you have a hole in your boat and your cow,

2185
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:40,590
you're masking it with duct tape and
you're trying to get back to this point.

2186
02:03:41,070 --> 02:03:42,560
You're just math.
You're not solving that.

2187
02:03:42,570 --> 02:03:46,440
Actually patching that up and so
you're susceptible again and now you,

2188
02:03:46,620 --> 02:03:50,060
you're talking like that never
happened. It was a fluke. Yeah.

2189
02:03:50,190 --> 02:03:52,910
Rose is pretty fucking good. And
if you don't respect her, again,

2190
02:03:52,920 --> 02:03:55,440
you think it's your nutritionist
is why he left that fight,

2191
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:58,700
you're probably gonna lose again. You
might be right. He might be right.

2192
02:03:58,701 --> 02:03:59,640
It's only thing that bothers me,

2193
02:03:59,641 --> 02:04:01,860
I think you on is one of the greatest
games of all time when the greatest

2194
02:04:01,861 --> 02:04:04,830
fighters. But it's just when I see them
like, oh you're, you're just going,

2195
02:04:05,010 --> 02:04:06,840
you're going about the wrong
way. And she goes, you know,

2196
02:04:06,841 --> 02:04:09,810
I even talked to Rhonda and you know,
she said she had to wait, come like,

2197
02:04:10,470 --> 02:04:14,610
no one's dealt with loss is worse than
Rhonda. You don't want to preface that.

2198
02:04:14,611 --> 02:04:16,700
You don't want to reference that at all.
Right.

2199
02:04:16,890 --> 02:04:21,210
I don't want to see that out of you, Ana.
She has so much more work to do. Yeah,

2200
02:04:21,211 --> 02:04:25,140
well it's also,
you want to had a long career in Moy Tai,

2201
02:04:25,290 --> 02:04:28,610
a long career. You know,
like a lot of fights, tons,

2202
02:04:28,680 --> 02:04:32,400
lot of a kickboxing sparring,
a lot of MMA sparring.

2203
02:04:32,730 --> 02:04:36,660
Sometimes your changes goes, I
mean, this is a, this is a real,

2204
02:04:37,350 --> 02:04:38,120
sometimes you change,

2205
02:04:38,120 --> 02:04:41,640
just go. You didn't get the Chin thing?
I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I see.

2206
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:44,280
I think it's too early to call for that.
Especially at that weight class.

2207
02:04:44,281 --> 02:04:45,690
I think for her it's more,

2208
02:04:45,720 --> 02:04:49,200
she just wasn't being respectful of rose
[inaudible] she's gonna walk through

2209
02:04:49,201 --> 02:04:52,500
and all the shit talking and she was
doing and roses a different animals. She,

2210
02:04:52,590 --> 02:04:56,610
she reminds me of Brian Ortega a little
bit where, where she's very dangerous on,

2211
02:04:56,611 --> 02:04:59,760
on conventional and the certain
spots you can't train for.

2212
02:04:59,770 --> 02:05:04,350
So she's that type of animal with
similar Brian Ortega. But with Yolanda,

2213
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:09,870
a gun to my head, I'd say you
ana winds by decision. But again,

2214
02:05:09,871 --> 02:05:14,520
I hate bacon. Pigs makes me feel
badly. Yeah, making picks is tough man.

2215
02:05:14,521 --> 02:05:18,170
Because you know you're going to piss
people off and you know, they, oh,

2216
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:20,350
we're fucking route niggers.
That's no,

2217
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:23,970
you have to look at the
analysis of it before the fight.

2218
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:26,610
I thought rose was in
trouble. I'm like, you want,

2219
02:05:26,611 --> 02:05:30,180
it's very hard to take down to her.
Stanhope is world class and I think she's,

2220
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:33,350
she could very well pick
rows apart and you know, and,

2221
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:34,710
and crack or she's coming in.

2222
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:39,350
But when she hit her with that left and
she hit her before that and hurt her,

2223
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:42,900
but when she hit her with that left
hook, I was like, Gee, explosive too.

2224
02:05:43,200 --> 02:05:44,310
She looks good man.

2225
02:05:44,520 --> 02:05:49,520
And rose like a on the embedded rose was
a pat Barry takes a giant box of tennis

2226
02:05:51,391 --> 02:05:55,440
balls and throws tennis balls at her and
she's popping tennis balls in the air

2227
02:05:55,441 --> 02:06:00,000
and she, she looks fucking solid and rose
to her ceilings. We're just seeing it.

2228
02:06:00,040 --> 02:06:04,230
It's just so much room for growth to
show young pat just Trev around her.

2229
02:06:04,410 --> 02:06:07,590
And now forever people are like,
you're going to be world champion.

2230
02:06:07,650 --> 02:06:10,560
And when everyone tells,
coaches tell fives all the time,

2231
02:06:10,750 --> 02:06:14,580
but what actually happens? You Go,
Oh shit, they're not bullshitting.

2232
02:06:14,610 --> 02:06:17,880
They're not just saying this.
And I think when she actually believes it,

2233
02:06:18,030 --> 02:06:19,860
now you're dealing with
different thug rose.

2234
02:06:19,861 --> 02:06:21,390
You're dealing with different Yolanda,
you,

2235
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:24,540
Ana doesn't think she's the
greatest gift to the MMA world.

2236
02:06:24,630 --> 02:06:26,310
So that kind of combination.

2237
02:06:26,311 --> 02:06:29,190
It's such a fascinating and no
one's talking about it. Yeah,

2238
02:06:29,191 --> 02:06:33,330
well everyone was so caught up in this
cancellation and the Ferguson could be

2239
02:06:33,331 --> 02:06:36,540
fight was so huge for
the hardcores for sure.

2240
02:06:36,900 --> 02:06:41,370
But it's also one of those things where
with rose coming into this fight now and

2241
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:44,220
you want to make an excuses
for the last fight, you know,

2242
02:06:44,221 --> 02:06:47,780
I'm really interested to see what
happens when they square off.

2243
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:48,720
I can't wait for that fight.

2244
02:06:48,740 --> 02:06:52,590
Each other is yawn again and do the same
talk and again and roads 10 reciting

2245
02:06:52,591 --> 02:06:54,480
the Bible. I don't think
she can. I don't think,

2246
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:57,240
I don't think you'll want to can
do the same talk and you don't.

2247
02:06:57,241 --> 02:07:00,190
You don't think she goes, this was a
fluke. I'm doing the exact same thing. No,

2248
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:03,120
I think rose going to stare right through
her fucking soul again. I'd be like,

2249
02:07:03,121 --> 02:07:03,820
I'm the champion.

2250
02:07:03,820 --> 02:07:07,860
When you talk a gang of shit at someone
and they just stare right through you

2251
02:07:07,861 --> 02:07:09,660
and then they merch
you in the first round.

2252
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,230
It's very tough to talk all
that shit the second time.

2253
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:15,900
It's going to be interesting.
I think that's a sign if you want.

2254
02:07:15,910 --> 02:07:19,770
It isn't respecting rose again. If she
gets up there and start talking that shit.

2255
02:07:19,980 --> 02:07:23,700
I would put a ton of money on rose.
Yeah. If I see her doing the same things,

2256
02:07:23,701 --> 02:07:26,250
I'm like, Oh shit. You learn
nothing. Go there. Nothing.

2257
02:07:26,580 --> 02:07:29,070
Well it's whether or not
rose can clipper again.

2258
02:07:29,250 --> 02:07:34,250
If rose charges in eclipse or again it's
also the thing about a striker always

2259
02:07:34,411 --> 02:07:36,070
worried being taken

2260
02:07:36,070 --> 02:07:40,480
down is more likely to get hit with a
shot like Kevin randomly when he knocked

2261
02:07:40,481 --> 02:07:41,640
out Mirko Cro contract.

2262
02:07:41,740 --> 02:07:45,670
Same thing like Kevin was
the threat as a wrestler.

2263
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:48,490
Leaps in with a left hook and
catches him right on the chin.

2264
02:07:48,491 --> 02:07:52,960
Knocked him the fuck out. I think there's
a, there's a real correlation there.

2265
02:07:53,020 --> 02:07:57,190
I wouldn't be surprised if you on a so
focused on improving her stand up and you

2266
02:07:57,191 --> 02:07:58,610
know it's like kind of
got caught this time.

2267
02:07:58,630 --> 02:08:00,490
Just get overwhelming or to stand up.
She gets submitted.

2268
02:08:00,730 --> 02:08:04,210
She overlooked the submission
game of rose, which is
actually Rose's best weapon.

2269
02:08:04,240 --> 02:08:05,590
That's what I was thinking.
I was thinking, Bro,

2270
02:08:05,860 --> 02:08:07,990
we might see rose throw a flying arm.
Correct.

2271
02:08:08,010 --> 02:08:12,220
We might see rose wild shit doesn't
care about being on her back. Oh No.

2272
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:16,330
And she's fast. She, she
goes for shit. She like,

2273
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:19,390
she's a wild explosive person,
you know,

2274
02:08:19,391 --> 02:08:23,650
and she's a really interesting thinker
too. You know. She had a tough life man.

2275
02:08:23,670 --> 02:08:23,950
Yup.

2276
02:08:23,950 --> 02:08:28,950
Tough life growing up and develop this
very strong mind because controlled chaos

2277
02:08:29,171 --> 02:08:31,160
is what I taught and she's brilliant at.
Yeah.

2278
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:34,900
I think what else about fascinating
about this? Not that fight, definitely.

2279
02:08:34,920 --> 02:08:37,210
I'm more, almost more excited
for that fight. Anything now.

2280
02:08:37,211 --> 02:08:41,020
But what's fascinating to me is everyone
talks about Conor Mcgregor, right?

2281
02:08:41,021 --> 02:08:44,380
Especially when you're talking about
one 55 and with Connor and Max Holloway,

2282
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:48,270
Connor's never looked back.
Went af fight that guy back there.

2283
02:08:48,271 --> 02:08:50,620
Even though I'm better than the thing
that gets caught her out of bed,

2284
02:08:50,621 --> 02:08:53,050
I think is the challenge
and making history.

2285
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:57,550
And I think if Khabib or Max where to win,
that would be a new challenge.

2286
02:08:57,551 --> 02:09:00,100
And he'd been the underdog.
It's could be even when Max Holloway,

2287
02:09:00,101 --> 02:09:03,760
the you have a history at 55
especially if could be where to win.

2288
02:09:03,790 --> 02:09:07,420
I think we see connotate that fight now
cause he goes, that's about frown. Great.

2289
02:09:07,690 --> 02:09:10,120
Well I'm the best at moving
backwards hitting dudes.

2290
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:12,340
I bet you I can beat that guy.
And we see him.

2291
02:09:12,400 --> 02:09:15,870
I think we see him take that fight
and I've never said that before. I've,

2292
02:09:15,871 --> 02:09:18,500
I've always, I know Dana said, oh they're
going to fight in Russia. I'm like, God,

2293
02:09:18,501 --> 02:09:20,300
why would kind of fighting him
and then I think we're like,

2294
02:09:20,420 --> 02:09:23,350
when you think of all the challenges and
college career and what gets him going,

2295
02:09:23,380 --> 02:09:25,380
it's not people behind him.
It's always when people go,

2296
02:09:25,480 --> 02:09:29,240
that is the best of you was cool. Give me
that guy. Very similar. Max Holloway. Mm.

2297
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:34,030
Yeah.
If Max wins for sure they have a rematch.

2298
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:39,060
100% a hundred percent the thing about
Khabib is you always got a wonder who

2299
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:44,170
avoiding him. There's a difference
there. It did see the differences.

2300
02:09:44,260 --> 02:09:49,000
Max is one of the best fighters on the
planet. No doubt. He's one of my top,

2301
02:09:49,060 --> 02:09:52,750
one of my top guys. Maybe you just
ever top featherweight of all time,

2302
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:57,120
but people aren't avoiding him.
No. It's like I said, can be,

2303
02:09:57,121 --> 02:10:00,610
it's a different animal.
Like aerifying referenced this I said,

2304
02:10:00,940 --> 02:10:04,540
I said if you gave me a choice to make
the walk against Francis or could be,

2305
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:08,140
I'm cherry picking Francis Cause it's
a quick death and not the head in the

2306
02:10:08,141 --> 02:10:10,420
third row, but it's quick. It could be,

2307
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:14,500
but it's like an isis videos can be long
drawn out and to be a fucking nightmare

2308
02:10:14,501 --> 02:10:18,880
that you're not going to forget. Yeah,
he's going to beat your body into a pulp.

2309
02:10:18,910 --> 02:10:23,350
But the worst is he breaks you where
it's like, oh you are good at this.

2310
02:10:23,351 --> 02:10:26,320
And people thought you were
mentally strong. Watch this.

2311
02:10:26,350 --> 02:10:29,920
Now your entire family and friends going
to see how much of a pussy you are as a

2312
02:10:29,921 --> 02:10:34,100
bash. Your brains in round after
round, after round after round. You see

2313
02:10:34,100 --> 02:10:35,330
him break guys too though.

2314
02:10:35,360 --> 02:10:37,820
You see like there's something
happens to them when they just,

2315
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:42,860
they give in to the inevitability of
getting ragdoll. He's just better. Yeah.

2316
02:10:42,950 --> 02:10:45,080
Oh, the only person that's going
to beat him. It's not a person.

2317
02:10:45,081 --> 02:10:48,800
It's a fucking grizzly bear. You know?
It's like, fuck this man, and you see,

2318
02:10:48,801 --> 02:10:52,670
you can't see it in their eyes where
it just changes were just like, no,

2319
02:10:52,730 --> 02:10:57,290
not happening. Now, how many
rounds for four more rounds
of this? This is terrible.

2320
02:10:57,320 --> 02:11:01,790
If he wins and he beats Holloway,
I guarantee you he's calling out McGregor.

2321
02:11:02,840 --> 02:11:06,890
He wants the GSP fight.
Khabib wants GSP.

2322
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:09,920
Holy Shit. That's what I hear. Whoa.

2323
02:11:10,730 --> 02:11:15,290
That's the one 70 whoa.
What a great fight, right?

2324
02:11:15,410 --> 02:11:19,850
It's a perfect time to do it right
now. Right? GSP wins by rear naked,

2325
02:11:19,851 --> 02:11:22,580
choke against Bisping at one 85
says he doesn't want to fight it.

2326
02:11:22,580 --> 02:11:26,610
A five again here, take
your belt, suck it cs it.

2327
02:11:26,640 --> 02:11:30,970
Just go suck it. Take you. No,
I told you I'd fight their soc.

2328
02:11:30,971 --> 02:11:32,330
Do whatever you want to do with that belt.

2329
02:11:32,510 --> 02:11:33,990
I'm going to just get to do
whatever the fuck I want.

2330
02:11:33,991 --> 02:11:35,030
I made a couple million bucks.

2331
02:11:35,420 --> 02:11:38,510
I'm gonna kick back for Awhile
and now you get party who? Oh,

2332
02:11:38,540 --> 02:11:42,860
you fancy yourself a grappler.
GSP. Me Too. Let's party.

2333
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:46,520
That's a really interesting, if I can
make a super fight. If I was like Dana,

2334
02:11:46,521 --> 02:11:50,610
scrooge McDuck, there's sit on top, all
these gold coins. I call it Ben African.

2335
02:11:50,611 --> 02:11:55,160
I'm like, Yo, any interest in
fighting Khabib at one 70 fuck yes.

2336
02:11:55,220 --> 02:11:58,940
Fuck. What's up bro? That's
what I'm talking about. Yes.
That's the call your boy.

2337
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,330
Oh my boy. I'm going to tell you
blocked by calls. We call your boy.

2338
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:03,173
He block your call.

2339
02:12:03,410 --> 02:12:06,050
I don't call him but I'm sure he
collected into him this weekend.

2340
02:12:06,080 --> 02:12:08,330
I want to talk to him this weekend.
Dad would be the fight,

2341
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:11,390
but you know what have
been asked for and wins.

2342
02:12:11,391 --> 02:12:15,860
He starts talking Shit Calling Dana.
Perfect. Perfect egg head. It works.

2343
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:20,200
It sells papers. It's the bottom
line. Yeah, but then you ruin.

2344
02:12:20,270 --> 02:12:22,080
Could be if Ben asking.
It could be,

2345
02:12:22,130 --> 02:12:26,540
I think you give Ben ass grin a
guy who's a good fighter. GSP.

2346
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:30,710
Well you haven't seen it.
Most people don't know who Ben Askern is.

2347
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:35,030
The problem is he fought in Bellator for
so long and then even when bell tours

2348
02:12:35,031 --> 02:12:38,150
gotten bigger on Spike TV,
he was off in one FC,

2349
02:12:38,180 --> 02:12:42,560
which you have no one are huge Ben
asking fans now, but we are hardcore,

2350
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:45,260
like the casual fan has no idea.

2351
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:48,590
Like who is this guy with the curly
hair they're sending to his death,

2352
02:12:50,020 --> 02:12:52,910
but we can sell it because he speaks well.

2353
02:12:52,911 --> 02:12:57,650
He's a beast on the mind and then you pin
if it gets hit an Olympian, he's never,

2354
02:12:57,670 --> 02:13:02,090
who's undefeated never been
hit against Khabib. Yeah,

2355
02:13:02,220 --> 02:13:05,750
and we call it the Cold War. I
think in the UFC, particularly me.

2356
02:13:05,930 --> 02:13:06,763
Well I'm a big Ben,

2357
02:13:06,790 --> 02:13:10,300
her Dick Rider and Jimmy Smith who's
also a big Ben Aspirin Dick, right?

2358
02:13:10,330 --> 02:13:14,090
I think we're all Dick Writers.
We could sell the shit out of it.

2359
02:13:14,091 --> 02:13:17,750
I can hype the shit out to be
100% honest in the process.

2360
02:13:17,930 --> 02:13:21,230
I think he's something special I
think is grappling is very unusual,

2361
02:13:21,231 --> 02:13:22,490
very difficult to prepare for.

2362
02:13:22,491 --> 02:13:27,491
And if you're going to deal with Khabib
against a guy who can neutralize his

2363
02:13:27,531 --> 02:13:31,680
stuff and then we see like, what did we
see Khabib on his back? Ben Asked Grin.

2364
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:32,370
Fucking

2365
02:13:32,370 --> 02:13:35,860
would a knee across the belly punching
Khabib and the face. We like, no.

2366
02:13:35,861 --> 02:13:39,750
What about Beneski right? We could be
just doing the ground and pound, right.

2367
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:44,520
There's these trait crazy scrambles and
the grappling communities can be like,

2368
02:13:45,380 --> 02:13:48,780
it would be amazed is terrible.
Striking good blocks on that Uncle Dana.

2369
02:13:49,060 --> 02:13:52,020
Uncle don't think somebody for,
for, for, for, for fuck you.

2370
02:13:52,270 --> 02:13:56,850
He's going to slam that phone
down. Fuck you. He would
have to have, he's like, sir,

2371
02:13:56,851 --> 02:13:59,400
I'm trying to finalize cm punk Floyd here.

2372
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:02,790
You're talking about Penn
aspirin could be, how dare you.

2373
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:05,670
He would have to have a good relationship
with Ben asked her and they would have,

2374
02:14:05,671 --> 02:14:09,450
no, he does not. He's I disagree or
he doesn't know. He can go, all right,

2375
02:14:09,451 --> 02:14:12,780
I'm gonna make money off this
kid I have for $50 million.

2376
02:14:12,781 --> 02:14:14,820
They make money off this kid.
Let me do this.

2377
02:14:14,850 --> 02:14:17,850
Don't you think you'd have to put Ben
asked her in in a UFC fight though,

2378
02:14:17,851 --> 02:14:21,360
against some money to show everybody
what he's capable of. Nope.

2379
02:14:21,540 --> 02:14:25,710
He has all those belts. Undefeated
Olympian. We're just promo the shit.

2380
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:30,090
He's on embedded. He's on Uca night.
He's on below the bellies on jre.

2381
02:14:30,180 --> 02:14:33,630
We go on this campaign,
he's dressed in oak flag and he's like,

2382
02:14:33,631 --> 02:14:37,980
watch me beat the shit out the
pound for pound grain Russian.

2383
02:14:38,100 --> 02:14:42,540
Who else don't like
Russia all? Yeah, Maca.

2384
02:14:42,780 --> 02:14:47,760
Maca. Great. Ooh, I like it.
It's never happening. Probably
that's never happening.

2385
02:14:47,761 --> 02:14:49,550
Know what you sold me.
Thank [inaudible].

2386
02:14:49,560 --> 02:14:53,010
Just get Daniel or listened
to this video. Dana, Uncle d,

2387
02:14:53,220 --> 02:14:55,770
if you just have him fight
someone who's really good,

2388
02:14:56,160 --> 02:14:59,670
like Neil Magni or Carlos condit,

2389
02:14:59,910 --> 02:15:04,910
have him up like fucking Kobiashi talk
squash that introduction fight and who

2390
02:15:05,791 --> 02:15:10,680
knows? Nope, this is a one shot. Hell
Mary. We're selling the fuck out of it.

2391
02:15:12,240 --> 02:15:14,930
I'm interested because then what happens
to be fighting to a mega CROs Kinda and

2392
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:19,110
just like rape some humps on for three
rounds people. If that's sucked, man.

2393
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,060
I know, but he probably won't
be able to do like Khabib.

2394
02:15:21,110 --> 02:15:22,050
So you've gotta watch that one.

2395
02:15:22,110 --> 02:15:25,740
We missed the boat style is so much
more suited to one fc because they allow

2396
02:15:25,741 --> 02:15:28,550
those knees to the head on the ground.
True soccer kicks in,

2397
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:30,630
but they still are soccer
kicks in when I've see it.

2398
02:15:30,631 --> 02:15:33,510
Did they stop it after Brandon bear?
Like almost an excuse to dude,

2399
02:15:33,511 --> 02:15:36,420
I thought or maybe I think they still do
it. How about the Roger worked at one.

2400
02:15:36,450 --> 02:15:37,283
Oh my God.

2401
02:15:37,410 --> 02:15:40,530
I've got head kicked by the time about
Roger Work does fight and Ben Henderson

2402
02:15:40,531 --> 02:15:44,310
this weekend that's flying under the
radar. It is fine under the way. Well,

2403
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:45,750
it's like,
you know,

2404
02:15:46,440 --> 02:15:50,610
worked out was the first ever MMA fighter
on the cover of sports illustrated.

2405
02:15:50,670 --> 02:15:53,690
People forget that.
People forgot that back in the day was,

2406
02:15:53,691 --> 02:15:57,660
this is like 2000 twoish threeish
he was coming up right before that.

2407
02:15:57,870 --> 02:15:59,940
I forget who we beat. Then you're
supposed to fight Kenny Florian.

2408
02:15:59,941 --> 02:16:04,190
If you remember, he was like the front
cover. What year was that? 2004 two,

2409
02:16:04,191 --> 02:16:08,670
nine five no two.
Then six.

2410
02:16:09,310 --> 02:16:13,590
Dot. Six six was to say, Oh
yeah, here's the head kick.

2411
02:16:14,250 --> 02:16:17,040
So the dude uh, is, is already beaten him.

2412
02:16:17,190 --> 02:16:21,690
He rag dolls hortus down and look at this.
This is horrible.

2413
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:25,020
Oh, I mean, that was one of the
worst head kicks you'll ever see.

2414
02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:28,770
That was horrible. Let's see. I don't
want to see that. I don't want that in my,

2415
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:30,010
that's horrible.

2416
02:16:30,010 --> 02:16:31,510
That one's horrible.
Like that guy was,

2417
02:16:31,720 --> 02:16:35,230
he was already hurt and
out of it before that. Um,

2418
02:16:35,620 --> 02:16:40,620
well the average casual
adult soccer player can kick
a ball with a thousand foot

2419
02:16:41,441 --> 02:16:42,460
pound force.

2420
02:16:42,970 --> 02:16:47,080
The average professional soccer player
can kick it about 1,200 foot pound force.

2421
02:16:47,620 --> 02:16:48,490
My educated guesses,

2422
02:16:48,520 --> 02:16:51,550
elite highly trained martial arts
perform very similar to the professional

2423
02:16:51,610 --> 02:16:52,690
segment.
I'll tell you what,

2424
02:16:52,850 --> 02:16:55,360
if you put somebody down in their hands
and knees and I kicked him in the head

2425
02:16:55,361 --> 02:16:59,710
like that can be a lot more than that.
They're fucked. He broke and killed a guy.

2426
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:01,060
You know, you don't want
to see them. You could,

2427
02:17:01,090 --> 02:17:02,350
you could kill somebody doing that.

2428
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:05,290
You literally could snap their
neck is no doubt about it.

2429
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:07,210
When was that sports
illustrated cover though Jamie.

2430
02:17:08,010 --> 02:17:08,530
Okay.

2431
02:17:08,530 --> 02:17:11,560
Cause you met Roger where he worked
at sports illustrated illustrated.

2432
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:13,210
I want to and it says is Emma,

2433
02:17:13,211 --> 02:17:17,140
is the UFC the next emerging sport or
is it just a fad or something like that?

2434
02:17:17,141 --> 02:17:21,670
I want to say 2006 two I'm thinking six.
I think it's post.

2435
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:26,440
Um, it's post tough. Yeah,
it's post Stephan Bonner.

2436
02:17:26,441 --> 02:17:31,240
Forrest Griffin. Agree. And that
was 2005 maybe seven, maybe seven.

2437
02:17:32,660 --> 02:17:33,160
Yeah.

2438
02:17:33,160 --> 02:17:35,120
Um,
but remember Roger work to,

2439
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:40,130
he got all that notoriety and then he
tried big Dick in the UFC when now I want

2440
02:17:40,241 --> 02:17:41,740
this, this and this though. It cool.

2441
02:17:41,770 --> 02:17:44,740
We're going to sit ya and then give
you the worst matchup possible.

2442
02:17:44,741 --> 02:17:49,720
Here's gray Maynard. Yeah. May
28th, 2006. Oh there it goes.

2443
02:17:51,420 --> 02:17:55,870
Ah, mother. So we're in the neighborhood.

2444
02:17:55,930 --> 02:17:58,090
They were closed.
So this was a,

2445
02:17:58,180 --> 02:18:02,680
you know Roger where it was like
the poster board, Handsome Hispanic,

2446
02:18:02,880 --> 02:18:07,420
Latino, bad motherfucker. I remember
watching her work to beat that dude up.

2447
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:11,040
That punched a chick in the face like a
guy named [inaudible] in Austin, Texas.

2448
02:18:11,041 --> 02:18:15,370
He's a big football player, black
player, sucker punch to grow in the face,

2449
02:18:15,371 --> 02:18:19,630
in front of everybody dropped her and
then Roger where to takes his shirt off

2450
02:18:19,631 --> 02:18:22,210
and fuck this dude up.
There's a scramble.

2451
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:24,520
You see the dude squaring off
Roger's way smaller than him.

2452
02:18:24,670 --> 02:18:28,570
Cut to a few seconds later.
See Roger Soccer kicking him.

2453
02:18:29,620 --> 02:18:30,453
Here it is.

2454
02:18:30,790 --> 02:18:31,170
Okay.

2455
02:18:31,170 --> 02:18:35,430
So Roger is standing back here
and this guy steps into this girl,

2456
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:40,490
TMZ son. Did you show the
first beginning of it? Yeah,

2457
02:18:41,080 --> 02:18:44,130
but the beginning of his, when he steps
in and punches the girl in the face,

2458
02:18:44,920 --> 02:18:47,520
all right there, we'll drop the
girls go to right to the beginning.

2459
02:18:47,550 --> 02:18:49,050
Knocked the girl out
right to the beginning.

2460
02:18:49,660 --> 02:18:50,493
Okay.

2461
02:18:51,080 --> 02:18:54,130
It doesn't play the whole thing. So the
guy, the the guy in the orange shirt,

2462
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:58,420
big ass dude drops a girl, female
girl face look work to look at them.

2463
02:18:59,520 --> 02:19:00,353
Yeah.

2464
02:19:03,160 --> 02:19:05,560
Good luck.
Colon back does talking shit.

2465
02:19:07,120 --> 02:19:10,420
He's saying that's a girl man. He's so
much smaller. This guy is like, fuck you.

2466
02:19:10,421 --> 02:19:11,440
I'll fuck you up to.

2467
02:19:11,860 --> 02:19:14,870
We're always had good fashioned
to just want the other there.

2468
02:19:15,250 --> 02:19:19,090
There's another video this week. Hear more
volume when I'm talking to each other.

2469
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:22,210
This might be the only one I've
ever seen. Oh, there it goes.

2470
02:19:22,211 --> 02:19:23,230
Work to take your shirt off.

2471
02:19:23,231 --> 02:19:27,710
And he's pissed guy who had girl Roger
where I took their shirt off. Okay.

2472
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,520
They got some titties with a sub.
Roger chases him down.

2473
02:19:32,720 --> 02:19:34,950
Well Roger was fast as
fuck too that Oh yeah,

2474
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:38,060
no idea what he's doing before he knew
animal that before he knew what that

2475
02:19:38,061 --> 02:19:41,530
dude's getting punched in the face and
at the end you see Roger's got the dude

2476
02:19:41,531 --> 02:19:44,650
in the ground sock kicking them. No,
it's like, it's like jumping into the,

2477
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:47,300
into the water and there's a
crocodile in there before you know it,

2478
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:54,080
look, get Roger, boom, he's out cold.
You're not. And that's justice, isn't it?

2479
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:58,790
It needs to be JC. He's
basically a Mexican Batman
there. If he kept kicking him,

2480
02:19:58,791 --> 02:20:01,650
it had been justice. I mean it was
justice for sure, but fuck that guy.

2481
02:20:01,651 --> 02:20:05,660
I know some guy's cock sucker
punching your daughter. Big giant,

2482
02:20:05,661 --> 02:20:08,990
250 pound football player.
Sucker punches her daughter face.

2483
02:20:08,991 --> 02:20:12,640
It'd be hard not to kill. Very hard. Not
Super. Not to very lucky he's alive. Yeah.

2484
02:20:12,670 --> 02:20:13,161
Very lucky.

2485
02:20:13,161 --> 02:20:16,400
He's alive and he probably shouldn't
be if he doesn't feel remorse for that

2486
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:18,770
sucker.
Punching a girl in the face like that.

2487
02:20:19,070 --> 02:20:22,820
It's a special kind of piece of shit.
Big Dude too. It's a giant. Yeah.

2488
02:20:22,910 --> 02:20:25,700
I mean who knows what the fuck was
going on in his head, but then again,

2489
02:20:25,850 --> 02:20:29,090
who knows what the fuck is going on
with a lot of football players that have

2490
02:20:29,091 --> 02:20:31,670
suffered a lot of head trauma.
True. Or he could just be a bad guy.

2491
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:34,670
That could be a bad guy. Maybe he was
raised around that, thinks it's okay.

2492
02:20:35,300 --> 02:20:37,910
Maybe who knows what the
girl did? Either way. Never.

2493
02:20:37,911 --> 02:20:41,810
Okay to hit a girl fuck like that too.
It's, that's a hard thing to watch.

2494
02:20:42,410 --> 02:20:46,610
It's a horrible thing to watch is gets
off that guy punching a guy like you is

2495
02:20:46,611 --> 02:20:49,880
horrible but punching a girl in the face.
Horrible man.

2496
02:20:50,330 --> 02:20:52,460
There's a lot of fucking shit
of humans out there, man.

2497
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:58,420
A real unfortunate part about us,
but keep going. Dark dots hard,

2498
02:20:58,450 --> 02:21:02,570
tough not to when you watch something like
that. But the Roger, Roger, Sarah Day,

2499
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:06,410
he did man superhero style.
I bet that guy s but his friends,

2500
02:21:06,411 --> 02:21:07,244
I remember that time yet.

2501
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:11,930
Burke by Roger worked up and really it's
tiny thought 155 pounds and your giant

2502
02:21:11,931 --> 02:21:15,200
ass is all juiced up in the God damn
weight room every day and you still got

2503
02:21:15,201 --> 02:21:18,860
knocked out for hitting a girl.
Remember that asshole every day.

2504
02:21:18,861 --> 02:21:22,280
Ever lived that down? Nope. Even now, I'm
sure people will find them on Instagram.

2505
02:21:22,281 --> 02:21:23,200
Be like,
hey Rogen shove,

2506
02:21:23,201 --> 02:21:27,050
we're talking mad shit about you man Mir
that we'll never get to live it down if

2507
02:21:27,051 --> 02:21:29,870
he never went to jail for that.
That's the punishment. Correct.

2508
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:32,870
He never went to jail for that. You're
supposed to go to jail for that. Yeah.

2509
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:35,900
That's supposed to put you in jail for a
long time and hopefully he doesn't have

2510
02:21:35,901 --> 02:21:38,960
kids.
Stark.

2511
02:21:40,060 --> 02:21:43,520
We won't talk again.
Wait, go dark sometimes.

2512
02:21:45,210 --> 02:21:49,400
What else is on this car
this weekend yet? Uh, Pedis.

2513
02:21:50,520 --> 02:21:53,490
That's a fun one.
Everybody's dad slept on that fight.

2514
02:21:54,210 --> 02:21:57,960
It's another one that's gone under
the radar. She has both pet dies.

2515
02:21:57,990 --> 02:22:02,760
Very interesting man. Jessa man, he
fucking submitted by Neil Dariusz.

2516
02:22:03,240 --> 02:22:07,890
He gets your back, your Foxville. Remember
he got submitted by Kevin Lee? He did,

2517
02:22:07,891 --> 02:22:12,810
but he didn't. He didn't. He didn't get
submitted. The referee stopped it. I know,

2518
02:22:12,811 --> 02:22:17,190
but he was saying he was good. He look,
he was tightening up his neck. Yeah.

2519
02:22:17,191 --> 02:22:20,040
It wasn't me that you got to let the
guy go out. I'll come on brother.

2520
02:22:20,100 --> 02:22:23,360
100% he was done. Felder,
outlier Quinta. Whoo.

2521
02:22:25,070 --> 02:22:25,903
Woo

2522
02:22:26,060 --> 02:22:29,730
catered. Did you see he's a monster.

2523
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:34,020
Calvin cater and a Meu Cano.
That's a good fight to at the undercard.

2524
02:22:34,021 --> 02:22:37,410
You got bored. You got Joe
Lozan got caught run on quarter.

2525
02:22:38,850 --> 02:22:42,480
Calvin cater and not to a more economy.
That's a great fans fight.

2526
02:22:42,540 --> 02:22:45,240
Fight of the night. Written
all over it. All over it. God,

2527
02:22:45,241 --> 02:22:48,420
there's fucking five excellent
fights in that main card.

2528
02:22:48,450 --> 02:22:51,570
Like your boy fleets hit or look
at your girl fleets hearing. Yeah,

2529
02:22:51,930 --> 02:22:54,500
ver versus Carolina. Yes. Lena.

2530
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:59,540
Kickball Kovich and then I'm not even
mad at the fight. Pass, fight the uh,

2531
02:22:59,710 --> 02:23:04,110
your boy Bruce Leroy Leboeuf
low Bob who's off the team.

2532
02:23:04,111 --> 02:23:06,750
Connor and then team could saw
each other and they got into it.

2533
02:23:07,050 --> 02:23:08,130
They think the other team,

2534
02:23:08,131 --> 02:23:11,550
Connor and then the team could bebes got
brilliant to it cause Kimmy obviously

2535
02:23:11,551 --> 02:23:15,240
as for Connor, when Tony fell out and date
and was like, come on, let's get real.

2536
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,070
Yeah,
you can't put that better shot

2537
02:23:18,580 --> 02:23:23,580
a video supposedly have a low voc calling
him a coward and he was calling them

2538
02:23:23,641 --> 02:23:27,360
out to say it to his face.
Oh Wow. Those guys from uh,

2539
02:23:28,130 --> 02:23:30,300
Pakistan. This is Dagestan, right? Yeah.

2540
02:23:30,301 --> 02:23:35,070
You know how many people he must've seen
get killed shit. Now Margaret Madoff,

2541
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:37,590
like mentally,
he's in a completely different space.

2542
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:41,760
Goddamn Mike can be in color as to why.
Why don't they have Mike Rodriguez?

2543
02:23:41,820 --> 02:23:45,880
It's Mike and Black and white. White.
Is He in Dad's ashes? This bullshit.

2544
02:23:45,900 --> 02:23:48,630
What is this bullshit? They didn't
even, it didn't even allow them to flex.

2545
02:23:48,660 --> 02:23:53,660
God Damn my car hit the fucking regular
Russell shorts on that you get in gym

2546
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:58,260
class. Fuck Mike. Oh Man. Oh
Joe Lowe's ons on the car too.

2547
02:23:58,320 --> 02:24:03,210
Mike slow. Mike Rudd. Re that's not
a great nickname. Uh, slow Mike.

2548
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:07,100
That's not good. That's
a trek as fast. So fast.

2549
02:24:07,101 --> 02:24:10,380
It couldn't get them a color picture.
Um, light heavyweight. Look at that one,

2550
02:24:10,381 --> 02:24:14,700
two Oh five and one 92. What
is that? What's that shit?

2551
02:24:15,310 --> 02:24:16,610
This is not real weight.

2552
02:24:16,810 --> 02:24:21,210
Is it always in one night to one of
them is two oh five ones. One 92.

2553
02:24:21,211 --> 02:24:22,440
That doesn't even make any sense.

2554
02:24:23,590 --> 02:24:26,790
Like unless they're fighting an 85
and they caught them before the wake.

2555
02:24:26,850 --> 02:24:29,940
That makes zero sense. That
makes zero sense. One guys,

2556
02:24:29,941 --> 02:24:33,480
13 pounds heavier weight class. They
finding it. I mean no, I know that's,

2557
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:36,420
that's light heavyweight.
But what Mike?

2558
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:39,450
Mike Rodriguez with Shane's
name for black black dye.

2559
02:24:39,480 --> 02:24:43,710
Last name Mike or Rodriguez Cuban
maybe. Um, his name's Mike though.

2560
02:24:43,711 --> 02:24:47,130
Slowmo Mike. But um, if he just
fortunate he had a picture,

2561
02:24:47,131 --> 02:24:50,190
cause usually this throw up a shadow
if they don't have it right this time

2562
02:24:50,191 --> 02:24:51,860
though. You know what? You're
not going to shout out.

2563
02:24:51,860 --> 02:24:52,780
We're going to black and white for him.

2564
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:57,100
We're going to let people know that you
haven't really fought in the UFC before,

2565
02:24:57,990 --> 02:25:01,620
but we're still getting pictures. What
do you think about [inaudible] and Pedis?

2566
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:06,720
Ah, man Pedis, right? It's just
bad streak. He's on a rough streak.

2567
02:25:06,721 --> 02:25:09,840
He won his last one, right? But then
him find a 45 whoever told him, dude,

2568
02:25:09,841 --> 02:25:13,470
that's insane. So it's tell Holloway
got his belt. But I'm a Kevin Lee Fan,

2569
02:25:13,860 --> 02:25:18,810
but I say he did not submit Michael. Yes,
you're out. They should have let him.

2570
02:25:18,870 --> 02:25:20,880
They should have let them go
out and he would have won,

2571
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:25,450
but they didn't and he didn't. Okay.
Zuora, we're in the same boat. However,

2572
02:25:25,451 --> 02:25:29,440
if it would have kept going on, he had
been choked unconscious. Not, maybe not.

2573
02:25:29,441 --> 02:25:31,630
I've been doing Jujitsu maybe too long.
Not to know.

2574
02:25:31,760 --> 02:25:34,090
The PS is like Hicks and Gracie.
Hixon Gracie,

2575
02:25:34,091 --> 02:25:37,450
let's black belts take his back with
full rear naked choke. And it's like,

2576
02:25:37,451 --> 02:25:41,210
go ahead. I know. Crazy. Right to
chocolates. That's, that's you know,

2577
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:43,390
you know what Gracie, we're talking
that takes and for Gosh Sakes,

2578
02:25:44,460 --> 02:25:48,490
I love Chia Aza.
That's a far cry from Hicks and Gracie.

2579
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:53,110
But also he went to go tap. Have you
look at the video, look at the video. He,

2580
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:55,460
he panics a little bit and now he's a,
he's a,

2581
02:25:55,740 --> 02:25:59,020
he's a black belt I think he said
he knows what the fuck he's doing.

2582
02:25:59,021 --> 02:26:00,760
He was going to and trading on his neck.

2583
02:26:00,761 --> 02:26:02,680
If you hear him talk about
it that he tightened,

2584
02:26:02,681 --> 02:26:05,290
he put all his focus on his neck and
he let his hands go and it's just

2585
02:26:05,291 --> 02:26:06,810
tightening it.
Oh yeah.

2586
02:26:06,850 --> 02:26:11,710
You have Kevin Lee who's a fucking
anaconda around your neck and has previous

2587
02:26:11,711 --> 02:26:14,920
winds of rear naked choke. I
don't buy it. I agree with you.

2588
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,300
They should have let it go on.

2589
02:26:16,301 --> 02:26:18,370
I think we'd been choked
unconscious to let it go on.

2590
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:19,630
You have to you to let it go on.

2591
02:26:19,910 --> 02:26:23,590
The only worse rest I've seen was the
ref in the, uh, Joseph Parker fight.

2592
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:27,470
I didn't see the judge. The Ref would
not fucking let these guys fight.

2593
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:30,790
Anytime they even got close, he jumped
in their own, push them away. Hmm.

2594
02:26:30,820 --> 02:26:32,230
Who Do you think that favored?
They,

2595
02:26:32,231 --> 02:26:34,900
I think they thought it was going
to favor Anthony. Joshua for sure.

2596
02:26:34,901 --> 02:26:38,950
They want him to win but
actually favored. Um, yeah,

2597
02:26:39,870 --> 02:26:44,260
they, yeah. Well you agree with the
decision. Yes. Parker definitely lost.

2598
02:26:44,261 --> 02:26:46,600
But I can only agree
where people are like,

2599
02:26:46,630 --> 02:26:49,520
oh Auntie Joshua look batty an off
night. No, no, you morons. The,

2600
02:26:49,610 --> 02:26:53,080
and Polly mentioned this, the distance
they fall in such a high level,

2601
02:26:53,081 --> 02:26:58,000
no one got hit. And Parker is such a
good boxer. His Jab is so goddamn good.

2602
02:26:58,210 --> 02:27:00,790
It was just a battle
of straight skill man.

2603
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:03,880
And I thought it was so impressive
and people walk away from gun man,

2604
02:27:03,881 --> 02:27:05,710
Anthony Joshua is not that good on it,
man.

2605
02:27:05,711 --> 02:27:07,660
He's better than I
thought he can box waiver.

2606
02:27:07,661 --> 02:27:10,350
And I thought well it's cause you
understand the people that say what?

2607
02:27:10,360 --> 02:27:14,140
It's not that good cause he didn't win
by spectacular knockouts like Deontay

2608
02:27:14,141 --> 02:27:18,130
wilder. Correct. Wilder.
That's uh, that's interesting.

2609
02:27:18,190 --> 02:27:22,000
The wilder fight is very interesting
because while their talks a ton of shit,

2610
02:27:22,330 --> 02:27:27,040
he's exciting. He's brash, he's
got serious knockout power. Crazy.

2611
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:32,020
He, he's fun to watch, man.
And he's like a brash American,
you know, that's a great,

2612
02:27:32,021 --> 02:27:35,530
it's a great fight. What are they
going to do that it was wilder.

2613
02:27:35,531 --> 02:27:36,580
I have to fight somebody first.

2614
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:40,510
It sounds like Josh was going to fight
someone else and Wilders gun fight song.

2615
02:27:40,510 --> 02:27:43,290
Why are they doing that? That's so
stupid. So stupid. Not boxed in this.

2616
02:27:43,570 --> 02:27:44,560
It's so stupid.
Well,

2617
02:27:44,561 --> 02:27:48,760
they build it up to make this big giant
event and when it comes off like, look,

2618
02:27:48,761 --> 02:27:51,910
it comes off. It comes off like
Pacquiao versus Mayweather was giant.

2619
02:27:51,970 --> 02:27:54,620
It's the number one problem with boxing.
Give us the matchups.

2620
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:55,473
Everyone wants to see.

2621
02:27:55,540 --> 02:27:58,730
That's why the UFC gain so much
ground because usually Dane,

2622
02:27:58,731 --> 02:28:02,410
besides the aspirin can be usually
when there's a fight, Danny goes, boom,

2623
02:28:02,411 --> 02:28:06,250
there you go. Super. You want
see steep ADC. Boom. There
you go. Yup. Colorado. Boom.

2624
02:28:06,251 --> 02:28:09,370
There you go. So we get all
the Connor. There you go.

2625
02:28:09,430 --> 02:28:13,390
So we had these super fights
in boxing like, no, no, listen,

2626
02:28:13,391 --> 02:28:15,070
we want to do this and
this guy's a mandatory.

2627
02:28:15,190 --> 02:28:18,220
I managed this guy and this
guy's PBC bucks and sky showtime.

2628
02:28:18,250 --> 02:28:23,240
So saw this red tape. It'd be a phenomenal
fight. It'd be a phenomenal fight.

2629
02:28:23,270 --> 02:28:26,390
Phenomenal fight. It's going
to happen. I think it happens.

2630
02:28:26,391 --> 02:28:27,620
I don't know if happens under this year,

2631
02:28:27,621 --> 02:28:32,621
but I just can't believe triple g and
Canelo are not going to fight that such a

2632
02:28:33,081 --> 02:28:37,190
both. I feel like it's not even, I
mean what is today date is April 5th.

2633
02:28:37,340 --> 02:28:41,810
It's a month away and they haven't even,
they haven't even put the, uh, the,

2634
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:44,800
the hearing together, the hearing is
like what the 18th there's some CML.

2635
02:28:44,810 --> 02:28:47,740
It backed out. Why did he
back out? I just don't the,

2636
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:50,630
I think he knew the odds were against
him and backed out and then, you know,

2637
02:28:50,631 --> 02:28:53,540
triple g still planning
on finding May 5th wow.

2638
02:28:53,541 --> 02:28:56,110
Still going to fight and I was
hoping he cause he gonna fight.

2639
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:57,980
I'd love it if he fought
Billy Joe Saunders.

2640
02:28:57,981 --> 02:29:01,720
But Joe Saunders can't fight till
June. So why Triptan uh, cause he has,

2641
02:29:01,740 --> 02:29:04,070
he's coming off a hand injury
but he's like, I'm ready in June,

2642
02:29:04,071 --> 02:29:06,170
let's do it in June. If I'm
cooking, if I'm tripleG ,

2643
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:11,710
I'm not finding May 5th you're going to
sell 30 paper views when Canelo drops

2644
02:29:11,931 --> 02:29:14,570
out, whoever the replace with,
it's not going to be a huge name.

2645
02:29:14,571 --> 02:29:17,830
I'm sure it's gonna be a tough guy. It's
going be a worthy opponent to be tough.

2646
02:29:17,870 --> 02:29:20,690
You know it's not gonna make you bank.
You make bank up your paper view.

2647
02:29:22,530 --> 02:29:26,810
Just fight and fight and fight fucking
Billy Joe Saunders in June for us. Yeah,

2648
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:30,290
but the problem is they don't have the
date in June when you look at a venue

2649
02:29:30,320 --> 02:29:32,930
like the tee ball mill arena in Vegas,

2650
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:35,760
that motherfucker is booked
up for UAA and advanced. Yeah.

2651
02:29:36,860 --> 02:29:40,970
Except for the Mayweather. Mcgregor
fight. The Mayweather Mcgregor fight.

2652
02:29:40,971 --> 02:29:42,320
They found an opening.
I said,

2653
02:29:42,321 --> 02:29:44,840
let's do it because now you're dealing
with the box and commission. Yeah.

2654
02:29:45,050 --> 02:29:47,810
Didn't have to pay.
They have to pay ice cubes.

2655
02:29:47,810 --> 02:29:49,750
Basketball league had a
books that it had paid,

2656
02:29:49,751 --> 02:29:53,060
like he's keeps basketball league.
How much do we have a league?

2657
02:29:54,200 --> 02:29:59,150
I heard 6 million. 6 million to w and
then they didn't like the parking lot,

2658
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:04,180
but it's three on three basketball for
so ice cube, get the fuck out the way.

2659
02:30:04,370 --> 02:30:06,140
I'll watch three on three at the rack.

2660
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:09,320
I'm not trying to see these old basketball
players play three on three get the

2661
02:30:09,321 --> 02:30:13,940
fuck out so we can watch
Conor versus Floyd. Don't give
us any hassle. Basketball.

2662
02:30:13,941 --> 02:30:15,580
This is three and three league.
It is.

2663
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:18,860
It have a bunch of old like college
players and some old NBA players and they

2664
02:30:18,861 --> 02:30:21,800
play a three on three
half court game put on TV.

2665
02:30:21,801 --> 02:30:24,810
It was like done every week and a
different city and like a table,

2666
02:30:24,811 --> 02:30:25,820
a four point shot.

2667
02:30:26,150 --> 02:30:30,740
It's like if there is a master's leak
and you could only use your left jab,

2668
02:30:30,741 --> 02:30:35,600
that's what it's like in the
sons of bitches. Karate is back.

2669
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:38,540
New World, full contact.
Karate Combat League kicks off.

2670
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:41,570
Is this with the Bas Rutten just
announced today? Yeah. Yeah.

2671
02:30:41,571 --> 02:30:45,260
Bas Rutten is the a commentator.
Commentator. He's coming on.

2672
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:47,300
He might have something to
do with the organization.

2673
02:30:47,301 --> 02:30:51,470
Two bosses coming on next week to
talk about it. El Guapo in the house.

2674
02:30:52,340 --> 02:30:55,400
Love boss too. They play in a pit
or they fight rather in a pit.

2675
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:59,300
It's a shape like Sam. Pick at
it. Look at it, see it. Oh Bro.

2676
02:30:59,360 --> 02:31:02,600
Chuck Norris did this shit and
it's the way to go, man. Oh yeah.

2677
02:31:02,610 --> 02:31:05,390
Worked out great for chuck.
Look at what did work out great.

2678
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:09,400
He had a lot of successful shows
and have a fight booked. April 20th

2679
02:31:11,530 --> 02:31:15,110
Wonderboy flat fight with
karate pants onto it looks like.

2680
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:18,650
So they're fighting with little gloves on,
but they're wearing karate pants.

2681
02:31:18,780 --> 02:31:20,160
It's going to be in the Olympics,
not this

2682
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:23,810
exact thing, but cries and Olympics for
the next Friday's in the Olympics. Yeah.

2683
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:26,100
I'll tell you right now, all
these fives better. Pray to God.

2684
02:31:26,101 --> 02:31:27,330
Wonderboy doesn't get a feather up.

2685
02:31:27,331 --> 02:31:32,100
His ass decide to join this league or
Raymond Daniels. Yes. Worldclass guys. Oh,

2686
02:31:32,101 --> 02:31:34,450
you're shooting now.
Can you kick to the legs on it?

2687
02:31:34,970 --> 02:31:38,820
You better be able to kick the
legs. You can fuck it for sure.

2688
02:31:38,821 --> 02:31:43,020
Find a sandpit though.
They should fight in a basketball court.

2689
02:31:43,050 --> 02:31:45,900
Oh God Nah. Stop that. We can't,

2690
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:49,170
I can't say fight in a
basketball court period.

2691
02:31:49,920 --> 02:31:52,050
Don't let him get too close to the fans.

2692
02:31:52,850 --> 02:31:56,040
Don't want him to do go three rounds
of three minutes, three minutes.

2693
02:31:56,130 --> 02:31:58,890
Offensive techniques scored more
highly than counter strikes.

2694
02:31:59,010 --> 02:32:00,240
This is karate is back.

2695
02:32:00,241 --> 02:32:03,660
Approximately 50 million Americans have
participate in crowded some point in

2696
02:32:03,661 --> 02:32:06,930
their lives and then I, and then I grew
the hall. You got to stop with that.

2697
02:32:06,931 --> 02:32:08,820
I grew the fuck up. Then I realized, oh,

2698
02:32:08,821 --> 02:32:12,420
I'm not learning shit that John Claude
did in the movies and this isn't fun

2699
02:32:12,421 --> 02:32:13,140
anymore.
Yeah.

2700
02:32:13,140 --> 02:32:16,600
When someone says that karate
approximately 50 million
Americans and participate

2701
02:32:16,610 --> 02:32:17,880
in karate at some point they're like,
yeah,

2702
02:32:18,030 --> 02:32:21,550
little kids taking fucking karate classes.
My seven year old's awesome man.

2703
02:32:21,720 --> 02:32:24,570
Correct? Yeah. That's great. I
was a yellow duck out of here.

2704
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:29,130
The problem with karate is we already
know about MMA and we already know about

2705
02:32:29,131 --> 02:32:29,964
Muy Thai,

2706
02:32:30,030 --> 02:32:34,910
but ng Jitsu would I do like is if they're
allowed leg kicks and they have the

2707
02:32:34,920 --> 02:32:38,580
small gloves on, it's basically like
it's MMA fight, but I'll stand there.

2708
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:41,790
It's all standing, but also
then I can allow low kicks. God,

2709
02:32:41,791 --> 02:32:46,110
it got a lot leg kicks.
That's a huge fuck up.

2710
02:32:46,111 --> 02:32:48,580
If they know a lot like cake boss
just to calm Taylor, he's in on it.

2711
02:32:48,590 --> 02:32:51,360
I know it was promoter. I don't know how
I'm going to want to find out next week,

2712
02:32:51,870 --> 02:32:54,180
but I would,
I would hope that they allow leg kicks.

2713
02:32:54,510 --> 02:32:59,490
I don't even like the glory doesn't
allow elbows. I feel like I agree.

2714
02:32:59,700 --> 02:33:02,580
I think that's the sport. The sport
is, if you're going to stand up,

2715
02:33:02,730 --> 02:33:06,170
it should be more time. I mean that, that
to me is the sport. The rules of Morita.

2716
02:33:06,180 --> 02:33:09,210
You could throw a wheel kicks in Muay
Thai, you get through a flying side kicks,

2717
02:33:09,211 --> 02:33:10,260
you do whatever the fuck you want,

2718
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:14,160
but you also can do Moitai like
needs the body, elbows to the face,

2719
02:33:14,161 --> 02:33:18,570
all those super effective close range
techniques that glory doesn't allow,

2720
02:33:18,571 --> 02:33:20,970
but I think they're worried about what
the elbows guys aren't going to be able

2721
02:33:20,971 --> 02:33:24,480
to fight, you know, close together because
they almost cause the cuts. However,

2722
02:33:24,481 --> 02:33:26,390
I'd rather deal with that
then not allow it. Oh,

2723
02:33:26,430 --> 02:33:28,380
well I don't like the guys
fighting close together.

2724
02:33:28,381 --> 02:33:29,610
I think that's super dangerous,

2725
02:33:30,750 --> 02:33:33,030
but when you have guys fight
more than one time and at night,

2726
02:33:33,060 --> 02:33:35,970
I think that is fucking crazy.
When you have guys fight two,

2727
02:33:35,971 --> 02:33:39,930
three times a night like Joe Schilling
did in the La last man standing event

2728
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:44,010
that is bananas like you are,
you're taking a giant chance.

2729
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:47,820
You're hoping that someone doesn't get
severely concussed even in a win and

2730
02:33:47,821 --> 02:33:50,280
their first fight and then come back
and fight in the Senate and make it fun

2731
02:33:50,281 --> 02:33:52,020
though. Like that's kind
of the nature of the game.

2732
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:55,250
Like what about wrestling against the
double A's? Those guys, Russell filtering,

2733
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:57,240
head kicked,
they're cutting massive way.

2734
02:33:57,241 --> 02:33:59,520
They are cutting massive weight but
they're not getting head kicked,

2735
02:33:59,730 --> 02:34:02,990
getting getting head kicked in the first
round and getting up at the count of

2736
02:34:03,000 --> 02:34:08,000
seven later and fighting and then
getting head kicked again an hour later.

2737
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:12,440
It's nuts. It's crazy. I just
don't like it. It's just to,

2738
02:34:12,450 --> 02:34:17,450
and also you don't get the best guy
versus the best guy in an even right.

2739
02:34:17,921 --> 02:34:18,040
Like

2740
02:34:18,040 --> 02:34:19,780
if one guy wins by first round knock out,

2741
02:34:19,781 --> 02:34:22,290
the other guy has a four round
war like Joe Schilling doing.

2742
02:34:22,300 --> 02:34:26,920
He fought Simon Marcus,
right? Crazy fight. They go
to three rounds. It's a draw.

2743
02:34:26,921 --> 02:34:30,670
They go to the third and Joe had been
knocked down I think in that first.

2744
02:34:30,671 --> 02:34:35,110
And then Joe's arched him in the fourth.
Isn't that crazy? If you know the sport,

2745
02:34:35,111 --> 02:34:37,600
you're like, Damn, look how
these guys just get through this.

2746
02:34:37,601 --> 02:34:40,540
They've dealt with this and
now it's kind of cool but,

2747
02:34:40,660 --> 02:34:41,890
but we know the repercussions.

2748
02:34:41,891 --> 02:34:45,790
Most people don't write well then the UFC
should bring back a tournament to then.

2749
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:49,540
I'm not mad at that. The pride
tournaments, it's so old school it's in.

2750
02:34:49,541 --> 02:34:51,280
People are probably gonna
die cause guys so good now.

2751
02:34:51,281 --> 02:34:55,480
But it's what you sign up for with the
problem as if one guy goes through three

2752
02:34:55,481 --> 02:34:58,840
rounds of hell and the other guy just
lands like a Connor straight left hand

2753
02:34:58,841 --> 02:35:03,190
they did on Aldo and wins in 13 seconds.
It's just not fair. I know and you know,

2754
02:35:03,500 --> 02:35:03,810
but,

2755
02:35:03,810 --> 02:35:08,500
but however that guy pulled off that 13
second knock out another guy had a war.

2756
02:35:08,530 --> 02:35:11,770
It's true. It's true. It's
true. It's true. I mean,

2757
02:35:11,771 --> 02:35:14,920
Gloria is the only organization right
now that's mainstream where you could

2758
02:35:14,921 --> 02:35:18,160
watch guys fight more than once in the
night. I do it all the time. Here's the,

2759
02:35:18,180 --> 02:35:21,550
here's the point. Why do
UFC is never going to do it
and most sports won't do it.

2760
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:25,690
It's hard to a, it's, it's a long show. B,

2761
02:35:25,780 --> 02:35:28,390
it's hard to market that it
shouldn't be sanctioned. No,

2762
02:35:28,540 --> 02:35:31,450
I mean there's a reason why it's not your,
you're in the right here.

2763
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:33,550
There's a reminder tonight,
I play devil's advocate,

2764
02:35:33,551 --> 02:35:36,340
but the reason why it's not is because
the math is they're like, well,

2765
02:35:36,341 --> 02:35:38,920
Attison it were just saw,
get kicked in the face fighting again.

2766
02:35:38,950 --> 02:35:42,220
They sanctioned it for kickboxing,
but they don't sanction that for MMA.

2767
02:35:42,221 --> 02:35:45,520
Isn't that weird?
Because like last man standing was in la.

2768
02:35:45,580 --> 02:35:49,810
We saw that at the fucking forum.
That was, uh, that was right here.

2769
02:35:50,230 --> 02:35:52,330
The whole,
the whole rules are where the judge,

2770
02:35:52,331 --> 02:35:55,150
and we've talked about this before and
that's why I was so intrigued about the,

2771
02:35:55,350 --> 02:36:00,340
uh, Tony First and fight, and this is
why I, I did a standup at, uh, this,

2772
02:36:00,440 --> 02:36:04,360
uh, San Jose Improv and in the front
row and I didn't know that there can be,

2773
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:05,560
there was all of teammate Kay,

2774
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:09,340
John Fitch Thompson and stuff
like that and a after the show.

2775
02:36:09,341 --> 02:36:13,480
So in front of them asked me this before
first and dropped them at Ferguson

2776
02:36:13,481 --> 02:36:16,570
could be who's going to win? And
I, I, it was a toss up for me,

2777
02:36:16,571 --> 02:36:20,500
but because I thought Tony was gonna do
work off his back when he was going to

2778
02:36:20,501 --> 02:36:23,230
land crazy amount of elbows
and fucked up could be face,

2779
02:36:23,410 --> 02:36:27,670
but because it could be was on top,
he'd get the wind via decision and I said,

2780
02:36:27,671 --> 02:36:29,890
the losers are going to be the judges
because they won't know how to judge that

2781
02:36:29,891 --> 02:36:33,640
fight and say that in front
of the AK team was awkward.

2782
02:36:34,030 --> 02:36:38,590
Depends upon how it plays out, but if it
plays out the way you described it, yeah.

2783
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:43,390
If, if Tony is landing big shots from
the bottom, submission threats, elbows,

2784
02:36:43,391 --> 02:36:45,730
his face getting bloody,
but Khabib's doing work on top,

2785
02:36:45,731 --> 02:36:49,540
but Tony's still threatened
elbows, elbows, this fucking
them up. It's possible.

2786
02:36:49,541 --> 02:36:51,940
But if could be malls, him,
which should be real clear.

2787
02:36:52,900 --> 02:36:55,780
We don't judge them when we got it.
I see that now. And that is a sin.

2788
02:36:55,840 --> 02:36:59,650
That's a sin against humanity. They says
we won't. That says we will never see it.

2789
02:36:59,680 --> 02:37:03,210
He said, he said crazy shit like John
Jones never be in a main event again.

2790
02:37:03,220 --> 02:37:04,600
He said a lot of crazy shit true.

2791
02:37:05,020 --> 02:37:08,020
He says this pushing gets a title
shot and then someone else does.

2792
02:37:08,440 --> 02:37:10,810
I think he's emotional. He's
upset. I'd be pissed too.

2793
02:37:10,930 --> 02:37:14,170
But also thinking about money, he's
missed out on it. That'd be it.

2794
02:37:14,290 --> 02:37:16,610
If they tried it again and be the
fifth time trying to promote this,

2795
02:37:16,670 --> 02:37:17,660
is that also really,

2796
02:37:17,780 --> 02:37:20,660
this is the fourth they've dropped out
or if they've tried to make this fight,

2797
02:37:20,661 --> 02:37:23,990
that's in Sean Shelby and
Josiah was trying to make
this fight before he retired.

2798
02:37:24,170 --> 02:37:27,140
The one five you want to make never
happen. So if you're Dana, you're like,

2799
02:37:27,141 --> 02:37:31,520
hold up, how much money have we
put in marketing to these fox?

2800
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:35,390
And it just doesn't happen for us.
We're down in. That does happen.

2801
02:37:35,450 --> 02:37:36,650
You gotta do it.
You know,

2802
02:37:36,651 --> 02:37:39,410
you said that you didn't believe it was
going to happen until you saw the door

2803
02:37:39,411 --> 02:37:42,740
bolt and they're standing next to each
other and here we are. Yeah, you're right.

2804
02:37:43,010 --> 02:37:44,030
It's such a shame.

2805
02:37:45,500 --> 02:37:47,840
You're the first person I texted when I
saw it cause we were talking about how

2806
02:37:47,841 --> 02:37:50,900
sad we'd be.
It's a jet bomber,

2807
02:37:51,260 --> 02:37:55,460
but this is the next best thing.
No, the next best thing is Connor.

2808
02:37:55,850 --> 02:37:57,800
This is the next best. Next, the next.

2809
02:37:58,130 --> 02:38:01,160
This the next best thing on
a six days' notice. Yeah.

2810
02:38:01,161 --> 02:38:05,810
You would never get Connor on six days.
No, it is. No, but if Connor would have,

2811
02:38:05,811 --> 02:38:09,260
Connor was scheduled to fight. See the
thing about a Connor at this stages,

2812
02:38:09,500 --> 02:38:13,530
there's no tuneup fights.
It's, there's never, it's never
going to happen again. No.

2813
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:15,440
Like every fight is just giant.

2814
02:38:15,441 --> 02:38:18,500
Only fight where where it'd be a level
playing field would be Nate Diaz cause

2815
02:38:18,501 --> 02:38:21,530
he's been out just as long.
So you're both going to be,

2816
02:38:21,570 --> 02:38:23,810
have a little bit of ring rust.
You're both can be out for a long time.

2817
02:38:23,811 --> 02:38:26,750
You're both going through the same thing.
You find a guy like Khabib.

2818
02:38:26,870 --> 02:38:30,290
Do you think they offered it to Nate?
Who Do think they offered it?

2819
02:38:30,291 --> 02:38:32,990
So we know they offered
it to the Ortega Ortega.

2820
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:37,700
Eddie Alvarez and Alvaris had no,
right? Yeah. Why did he say no?

2821
02:38:37,701 --> 02:38:41,360
I'm not sure right now. Oh yeah,

2822
02:38:41,361 --> 02:38:43,970
he's one 90 he's been doing it too
long. He said he's like, one night,

2823
02:38:44,090 --> 02:38:47,720
I'm not making that son. He said,
I'm all of one night. I love Alvarez.

2824
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:52,640
Imagine losing 35 fucking pounds.
How much? And if you know,

2825
02:38:52,641 --> 02:38:53,900
please say it for everyone,

2826
02:38:53,990 --> 02:38:57,700
how much you think they paid Max Holloway
to take this site? Six Day notice.

2827
02:38:57,701 --> 02:39:02,650
And they go, Bro, we know you're a champ
at one 45 here's the offer. Oh wait,

2828
02:39:02,730 --> 02:39:03,980
we're just giving you this much.

2829
02:39:04,010 --> 02:39:07,670
All I know is what Eddie told
me on the podcast about Tony,

2830
02:39:07,970 --> 02:39:09,470
you said he was going to make millions.

2831
02:39:11,220 --> 02:39:13,340
So if that's what we know,
we've got,

2832
02:39:13,360 --> 02:39:17,820
assume there's a big paycheck and it
for Max Holloway, I told Brian Goes,

2833
02:39:17,821 --> 02:39:19,890
how much you think he's in
pain? I said, if I'm Max,

2834
02:39:19,920 --> 02:39:22,750
I don't take that fight for
under 4 million. I know they're,

2835
02:39:22,760 --> 02:39:26,220
they're in a tough position and they
need a big name and then trying to recoup

2836
02:39:26,250 --> 02:39:28,770
the paper views.
So I got them backed in a corner.

2837
02:39:28,890 --> 02:39:33,190
I'm on the longest winning streak.
I'm saying 4 million or bust. Ooh,

2838
02:39:33,270 --> 02:39:34,440
you're a bold man.

2839
02:39:34,890 --> 02:39:38,520
I'd say two till after taxes.

2840
02:39:39,090 --> 02:39:43,130
That's not worth it. That's fucked
that out when you're fighting Khabib.

2841
02:39:43,740 --> 02:39:48,720
Now why? Ah, I need a
million for every day.

2842
02:39:48,721 --> 02:39:52,560
So six days. So he said,
you know, you know,

2843
02:39:52,920 --> 02:39:57,810
Max can submit people, but
we don't anticipate him.
Surbiton could be. It just,

2844
02:39:57,811 --> 02:40:01,620
it seems like cubbies grapplings
on a higher level than Max.

2845
02:40:01,800 --> 02:40:06,240
It seems like the way Max can win this
fight is by pacing because Max is,

2846
02:40:06,720 --> 02:40:10,950
even if Max is not in shape, he's in
phenomenal shape. I mean he's just,

2847
02:40:10,980 --> 02:40:15,980
he's got an incredible cardio
and he really knows how
to pace himself very well.

2848
02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:21,260
Pacing if it's more of a style of fight
and if it's at his temple to beep goes

2849
02:40:22,320 --> 02:40:26,010
watch a tempo and just throws
in a blender. Yeah, he's so,

2850
02:40:26,011 --> 02:40:28,830
and it's a six day notice and it's
a Max who was taking time off,

2851
02:40:28,831 --> 02:40:33,030
spend time with his family. So all the
chips are stacked against Max, all of it.

2852
02:40:33,300 --> 02:40:35,250
And it's a weight class
above his weight class.

2853
02:40:35,251 --> 02:40:40,251
It's a Khabib who's a huge one 55 it's
arguably the best grappler in the UFC.

2854
02:40:43,630 --> 02:40:47,100
And the other promise,
he really doesn't attain the standup game.

2855
02:40:47,101 --> 02:40:49,590
So your chance of the one,
the home run shot,

2856
02:40:49,620 --> 02:40:53,130
it's even dropped even lower.
That's what I'm saying for mill.

2857
02:40:53,190 --> 02:40:57,240
Did you hear what he said about it?
He said thank you too for taking fights.

2858
02:40:57,540 --> 02:41:01,580
I don't think you'll ever be the
same again. Oh, I said I have foss.

2859
02:41:01,830 --> 02:41:05,210
I don't think of that'd be the
same again and pry not aligned.

2860
02:41:06,120 --> 02:41:09,390
That's a dark thing to say to not just,
Oh my God,

2861
02:41:09,660 --> 02:41:13,530
I'll never be the same again.
Ah, it breaks my heart.

2862
02:41:13,560 --> 02:41:16,230
Did we might say hope he's wrong
and you know, you know I do.

2863
02:41:16,440 --> 02:41:18,030
If I was in Max's corner and if,

2864
02:41:18,031 --> 02:41:21,340
and if it's like halfway through
the second round and I'm like, damn,

2865
02:41:21,341 --> 02:41:24,930
Maxx looks exhausted. He's not in shape.
He's just taken a beaten. He's so tough.

2866
02:41:24,931 --> 02:41:27,090
He's probably last five rounds.
I've thrown that towel.

2867
02:41:27,210 --> 02:41:28,650
I'm going to take all the shit for the,

2868
02:41:28,651 --> 02:41:32,220
from the fans because I don't want Max
dealing with this because this isn't,

2869
02:41:32,310 --> 02:41:35,550
this isn't his fight to be honest.
This isn't his fight. This isn't,

2870
02:41:35,551 --> 02:41:38,310
his path was going to make
4 million round hopefully.

2871
02:41:38,440 --> 02:41:41,550
And he's gonna be set for life financial
if he's smart with his money. However,

2872
02:41:41,790 --> 02:41:45,600
this isn't his path. We did this
to help out the UFC. He made bank.

2873
02:41:45,960 --> 02:41:48,330
There's a towel. Fuck you. I know
you're, you're in hate me Max.

2874
02:41:48,450 --> 02:41:52,500
We'll talk in Hawaii over bull of
a Ahi tuna. That's not a bad idea.

2875
02:41:52,800 --> 02:41:56,430
Well if we know we,
I think with a could fight,

2876
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:59,550
one of the things is after the first round
you kind of know how it's going to go.

2877
02:41:59,790 --> 02:42:01,800
Well No,
and split the thing too from act suit.

2878
02:42:01,801 --> 02:42:05,760
If he had 12 weeks and he's in phenomenal
shape and he gets taken down all a

2879
02:42:05,940 --> 02:42:08,880
kind of Chad Mendez, Conor McGregor
when cargo tank. Now we're like,

2880
02:42:08,881 --> 02:42:11,310
it's just matter of time where Mount
Mount of time you're going to catch him.

2881
02:42:11,550 --> 02:42:14,440
But with this could be in better shape.
He's had more time.

2882
02:42:14,440 --> 02:42:17,490
He's been preparing for a guy
who's insane cardio shape.

2883
02:42:17,760 --> 02:42:22,110
So it's just the odds are so
fucked for Max. Crazy, crazy,

2884
02:42:23,130 --> 02:42:24,240
really quite stressed.

2885
02:42:25,710 --> 02:42:30,210
So stressed as I was unexplained
myself, I'm stressed out. Wow.

2886
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:32,130
It's going to be interesting to me.
Interesting man.

2887
02:42:32,190 --> 02:42:34,410
That's going to be a good one.
So we were talking before it,

2888
02:42:34,411 --> 02:42:36,120
lets wrap this up but before
talking about for this,

2889
02:42:36,360 --> 02:42:37,560
we want to do a fight companion,

2890
02:42:37,561 --> 02:42:40,380
but there's no fights that were all
around for a fight companion. So let's,

2891
02:42:40,590 --> 02:42:41,820
let's do a fight companion.

2892
02:42:42,030 --> 02:42:46,380
Get all the boys in here and put on
some fights during the random night or

2893
02:42:46,381 --> 02:42:49,330
something like that. Ran like a
fucking Tuesday or some shit. And My,

2894
02:42:49,331 --> 02:42:51,600
maybe you were a compete us.
Yeah.

2895
02:42:52,080 --> 02:42:56,100
I'm hearing pizza right now and then
we'll wait. We'll save for a cheat meal.

2896
02:42:56,200 --> 02:42:59,900
How about neither one of his cheat until
that night. Okay. Deal. It's a deal deal.

2897
02:43:00,210 --> 02:43:02,220
I'll get the pizzas.
Let's wrap this bitch up.

2898
02:43:02,900 --> 02:43:07,290
Brendan Schaub a big brown breakdown.

2899
