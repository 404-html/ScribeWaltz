1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,290
Package is supposed to be out with you.
Five,

2
00:00:03,291 --> 00:00:04,430
four,
three,

3
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,623
two.

4
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,480
Ben Greenfield is gentlemen and Robo.
So it's been a lot of fun hanging out

5
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:15,780
with you for the last 44 minutes.
A sick game you out.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,780
Yeah,
it's pretty fun,

7
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,070
right?
I need to build a really,

8
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:21,080
really big like 67 yard long living room
to,

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,050
to put my big screen in now.
Yeah.

10
00:00:23,051 --> 00:00:24,370
That thing is crazy.
This,

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,400
we're talking about this game called
techno hunt that were just so,

12
00:00:27,401 --> 00:00:27,941
dude,
you,

13
00:00:27,941 --> 00:00:31,030
you are an interesting fucking guy.
You do a lot of weird shit.

14
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,740
I would no,
thank you.

15
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:33,820
I think,
yeah,

16
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,570
no,
it's good.

17
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,510
Yes.
It's a compliment when I say yeah,

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,670
interesting is a good thing.
But your,

19
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,890
um,
like your background,

20
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,230
you were just telling me this is very
fascinating.

21
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:47,650
Like you,
you live way the fuck out in the middle

22
00:00:47,651 --> 00:00:49,240
of nowhere.
Well,

23
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:50,050
it's Kinda,
it's Kinda,

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,790
I mean it's spokane,
spokane,

25
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:52,900
ha.
I mean we have like a theater.

26
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,760
You're off the grid and we have
restaurants.

27
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,080
They're actual people there who
restaurants.

28
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,230
Yeah.
And there's a theater there.

29
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,460
There's a little five and dime store.
At a general store,

30
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,380
a spoke cans,
a normal place.

31
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:03,340
It's pretty normal.
You're,

32
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:05,410
you're totally off the grid.
Well,

33
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:06,610
up at our house we are,
you know,

34
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:08,680
we're,
we're in solar panels and,

35
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,620
well,
and the way I have it set up is we eased

36
00:01:11,621 --> 00:01:15,340
in power from the local municipal power.
But if that goes out then it hits the

37
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:18,140
solar inverters and we're full solar.
So then there's that.

38
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:21,040
There's like a battery power in the
garage that stores a solar because we're

39
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,810
on a,
we're on like a north facing slope,

40
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,920
so you get sun from 10 to two.
So we can't collect a lot of solar,

41
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,600
but you stored in the battery.
So it's,

42
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,880
it's there.
So you've gotta be very judicious with

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,610
your laptop use.

44
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,690
Yeah,
well we do want to go off the grid.

45
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,910
It's a stupid home.
So there's,

46
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,280
there's no Wifi,
there's no bluetooth.

47
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,620
So everything's like,
it's,

48
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,360
it's hardwired metal shoulder,
the ethernet cable that's through the

49
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:46,180
whole house because I don't like to have
like Wifi signals bouncing around.

50
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,650
I just really,
I don't feel good.

51
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,090
I've always wondered about that.
What is that doing to us?

52
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,610
Well,
apparently I just actually just read,

53
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:56,110
there's a,
there's a really good new book that came

54
00:01:56,111 --> 00:02:00,840
out is called like that the non tin foil
hat guide to Emf I think is,

55
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:05,110
is the full title of the book.
But it goes into this idea of what are

56
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:08,920
called voltage gated calcium channels on
your cell membrane and all those

57
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:12,460
actually get affected by Wifi.
And apparently you see like a,

58
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,810
like a change in the electro chemical
balance across the actual membrane in

59
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,010
response to things like Wifi.

60
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,090
Apparently Bluetooth affects red blood
cells and I haven't seen,

61
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,420
I haven't seen a lot of like actual,
you know,

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,750
in Vivo research on that.
But I know that I feel better when I

63
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:31,060
don't have like the Wifi router going
or,

64
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,540
you know,
I,

65
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,960
I turn off all my,
all,

66
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,900
everything at night.
There's kill switches and all the

67
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:36,300
bedrooms.
So it's bait.

68
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,650
You walk into the house and it's just
super clean.

69
00:02:38,651 --> 00:02:41,050
Oh,
everything's HEPA air filters,

70
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,330
negative ion generators,
no Wifi,

71
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:46,450
no bluetooth.
We structure all the water that comes in

72
00:02:46,451 --> 00:02:47,021
from the,
well,

73
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:48,940
so it's the same now,
Scott like that.

74
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:50,080
Uh,
have you heard of structured water

75
00:02:50,081 --> 00:02:52,510
before?
I just heard about it because Eddie

76
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,280
Bravo just got that installed in his
jet.

77
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,070
It's kind of cool.
I mean the idea behind it,

78
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,150
there's this,
this cat up at University of Washington

79
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:03,240
named doctor Gerald and he has done this
research that shows like in plants or

80
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:09,541
vessels like blood vessels for example,
there's an exclusion zone of water.

81
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,450
I mean there's like a positive charge on
the inside and a negative charge on the

82
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:16,420
outside and that might be backwards.
It might be positive on the outside,

83
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:20,350
negative on the inside.
But either either way it causes fluid to

84
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:25,351
move through vessels in a way that
allows it to move more easily.

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,430
Like,
like the water is actually charged.

86
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,610
So apparently when you drink structured
water hydrates the sell a little bit

87
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,630
better,
Huh?

88
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,010
Yeah,
it sounds like,

89
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:34,140
and that's,
that's apparently how,

90
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:37,210
how water moves through plants.
That's one of those things that you hear

91
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,190
and then like you talked to a scientist
and they go,

92
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,680
no.
Yeah.

93
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,130
And they get mad.
Well,

94
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,840
I interviewed that,
I interviewed that guy,

95
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:46,090
Gerald Pollack.
And he has compare basically what he's

96
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:49,720
compared to like how it moves in,
in glass tubes and how can you structure

97
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:53,020
it and you watch it like the water moves
up through the glass tube way,

98
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:53,854
way better.

99
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,800
And then I interviewed this guy,
uh,

100
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,960
Thomas Cowan and he talks about how the
heart is not really a pump or it doesn't

101
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:04,180
act as much like a pump as we're led to
believe.

102
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,150
And so if you,
if you drink structured water,

103
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,310
apparently the blood moves better
through the vessels.

104
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:12,280
So I haven't seen a ton of research on
it,

105
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:14,380
but I structured my water just in,
cause it's cheap.

106
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,600
It's like a,
it's like this tiny little like plastic

107
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:19,300
piece that you put on on your,
on your water.

108
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,750
What exactly is it doing?
So the water passes through a series of

109
00:04:22,751 --> 00:04:25,660
glass beads like vortex is it?
So after it.

110
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:27,970
So it comes out of my,
well and I've got,

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I tested my water and I've got a like a
bacteria based iron and high levels of

112
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:33,881
manganese.
Like,

113
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:36,040
I thought,
well water was just all like pristine,

114
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:36,850
clear,
like,

115
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,500
you know,
like if you drink out of a spring on top

116
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,060
of a mountain,
but,

117
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,160
uh,
apparently there's,

118
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,020
there's crap in the well water.

119
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,750
So I filter it and then after it all
filters,

120
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:49,210
it passes through the structured water
filter.

121
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,200
I would ask that you would get some
stuff in the water because if somewhere

122
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:56,350
along the line there's like a dead
animal or beaver fever.

123
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,700
Yeah.
Was dead animals all over my head,

124
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:00,250
just piled everywhere.
Carcasses.

125
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,390
Careful not,
but well then the other thing is like

126
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,760
what I get concerned about is,
you know,

127
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:09,820
you see like glyphosate and herbicides
and pesticides,

128
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,370
they get spread over the crops and I
live in farmland territory,

129
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,710
right?
So I'm on this north facing slope and

130
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:18,370
there's all like these farms above me.
So I figure if that's dropping down

131
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,220
through the ground into that water,
I might be getting some of it.

132
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,450
So I filter.
Yeah,

133
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:25,570
that totally makes sense.
I know a guy who got bone cancer because

134
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:30,571
he lived off of a golf course and uh,
the golf course is constantly spraying

135
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,270
stuff on the golf course and it got into
the water supply and a bunch of powder.

136
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,370
They select getting bone cancer.
Oh really?

137
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,680
Like it happened to more people at a ton
of people in the neighborhood got

138
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:39,760
cancer.
Wow.

139
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,940
Yeah,
that's scary.

140
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,040
Sharese know what I tell people is um,
like people who don't have a well and

141
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:47,080
you just live off the municipal water
supplies.

142
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,930
You use a reverse osmosis water filter
cause it's a really,

143
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:52,330
really fine filtration but it takes
everything out.

144
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,220
Like it takes the bad stuff and the good
stuff out.

145
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,950
So you want to add minerals back in
after you filter the water.

146
00:05:57,951 --> 00:05:59,960
So you get a reverse and you could buy
these on like Amazon.

147
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:04,490
So like a reverse osmosis filter with
what's called re mineralization or you

148
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:08,430
can just use reverse osmosis and then
use like trace liquid minerals or you

149
00:06:08,431 --> 00:06:10,340
know,
sea salt or anything else to add

150
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,710
electrolytes back into.
A lot of people will put like a pinch of

151
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,544
Himalayan salt.

152
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,630
I go through so much salt.
I use this,

153
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,170
this stuff called Mexican Salt Kalema
salt.

154
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,400
I have in my,
I was actually at a steak house last

155
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,530
night.
People make fun of me cause I pulled up

156
00:06:21,531 --> 00:06:24,680
my big white bag of salt and I just
sprinkle it on everything.

157
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,000
But I'm a,
I'm a fiend for salt.

158
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,800
I love salt.
It's very good for you.

159
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,040
And unfortunately there's been a
terrible myth.

160
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,740
It's been perpetrated a long time ago.
That song gives you high blood pressure

161
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,750
and it kills you.
And that's a,

162
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:38,960
that's a real tragedy because that's one
of those ones that it was,

163
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,870
it was spread in like probably,
what was it,

164
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:44,510
the sixties or seventies when they
started telling people that salt causes

165
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,240
high blood pressure and no clue.
People still repeated today and they

166
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,890
don't understand that it's an essential
mineral.

167
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,190
Well there's a,
there's a new book out about this.

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
I forget the name of the book about
something.

169
00:06:53,521 --> 00:06:54,950
Have you heard of this book?
I've heard of the book,

170
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:58,030
but I don't know the name,
but it depends too because um,

171
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:02,240
I used to do racing 14 timex.
I used to these iron man triathlons and

172
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:06,500
they'd bring people in to test us and
they would do sweat sodium analyses

173
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,980
where you actually get a patch put on
your skin and it measures the amount of

174
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:12,530
sodium released over x surface area of
skin.

175
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:16,520
And then there's an algorithm that terms
like how much total sweat you lose say

176
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,450
per hour during exercise and,
and some people lose a copious amount of

177
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:23,000
sodium in their sweat and some lose
barely any at all.

178
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,450
So you have like a sodium conservation
mechanism that differs from person to

179
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:29,210
person.
So there might be some people who store

180
00:07:29,211 --> 00:07:32,180
salt really well who might actually get
higher blood pressure if they,

181
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,380
if they consume a lot of salt.

182
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,050
So if you're in a massive excess of salt
and your time,

183
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:39,050
and my numbers were off the charts
though in terms of how much sodium was I

184
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:40,760
was losing,
which is probably why it feels so good.

185
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,830
Well that makes sense.
So you're sweating so much,

186
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:44,090
right?
I mean it's just going right through

187
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,430
your body now going to,
it tastes amazing.

188
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,650
Yeah,
I'm happy to die of high blood pressure

189
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,080
just because of this salt.
Just a big fan.

190
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,410
I love kosher so I used to at least to
pay it and they pay like Roman soldiers

191
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:55,810
and sure.
And so I don't,

192
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,330
if we went to war for salt,
I take salt.

193
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,530
I mean it's really kind of amazing.
Then it was just less than a 200 years

194
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:07,310
ago that they figured out how to like
make refrigerators and I mean as a

195
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,470
frigerator from the 1930s I think it was
when,

196
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:12,890
when did they first invent those things
and then before that they had ice boxes.

197
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,540
You'd have to get a chunk of ice from
somewhere,

198
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,880
right.
Have to get me to store stuff.

199
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:20,060
And before that they just use salt.
And I've heard,

200
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:24,320
I don't know if this is true,
but I heard that if you come from an

201
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,710
area,
like if your ancestry is from an area

202
00:08:27,711 --> 00:08:29,900
where they did a lot of that fermenting,
pickling,

203
00:08:29,901 --> 00:08:31,040
curing,
salting,

204
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,340
that you have more robust sodium loss
mechanisms like which would make sense

205
00:08:36,481 --> 00:08:38,290
for me.
Like I'm northern European heritage.

206
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,980
I did a lot of like pickling,
salting,

207
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:42,680
curing.
So I would lose more salt than somebody

208
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:47,060
who might've come from let's say like a
sub Saharan African or South East Asian

209
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:49,550
or somewhere where they might not have
been using so much salt.

210
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,750
Yeah,
that totally makes sense.

211
00:08:50,751 --> 00:08:52,670
Yeah.
So this Wifi thing,

212
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:53,920
I want to go back to that.
Um,

213
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,720
cause I've always wondered there's,
there's not a long history of use of

214
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:58,890
human use of Wifi.

215
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,170
And one of the things sounds so stem
cells,

216
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:04,830
we're talking about a lot,
a lot of studies on that other 90 year

217
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,510
old dad is running around.
They've been doing himself,

218
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,440
right,
exactly.

219
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:08,820
Yeah.
But the Wifi,

220
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,920
like when it sounds hippy dippy,
but if you go somewhere like Prince of

221
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,410
Wales,
Alaska and you're on a mountain top,

222
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,600
it feels different.
Oh it totally does.

223
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:20,310
No radio.
There's no Wifi,

224
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,980
there's no direct TV's getting to you.
There's nothing and that fee,

225
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,070
it feels different up there.
You're also,

226
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,610
I mean like your grounding and earthing,
right.

227
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:30,980
And you're,
you're uh,

228
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,380
you're breathing a lot more negative
ions cause you're outside in the fresh

229
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,200
air.
And we don't have all the emails jumping

230
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,230
out from your inbox.
There's,

231
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:41,090
there's a lot of confounding variables.
But I mean,

232
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,300
all I know and I test a,
you're,

233
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,030
you're retested heart rate variability.

234
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,080
No,
it gets the,

235
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,130
um,
do you know what that is?

236
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,030
HRV.
A lot of athletes use it,

237
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,250
but I don't know much about what does it
miss the Inter beat individuality,

238
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:56,700
like the variation in the amount of time
in between each beat of your heart.

239
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,460
So it's not like how fast your heart is
beating and how much time is in between

240
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:02,300
each heartbeat.
So you can measure that and you're

241
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,510
supposed to have like slight beat to
beat variation in how much time is

242
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,700
between each heartbeat.
And if you have that,

243
00:10:08,701 --> 00:10:12,780
that's high heart rate variability.
So you can use that to track your

244
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:15,300
readiness to train your recovery.
Right.

245
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:17,910
So I use,
I use like a ring like this or I'll do

246
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:21,660
like a heart rate strap in the morning.
So aura or a ring actually,

247
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:23,880
have you heard of this thing?
No,

248
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:28,020
but do just going out of my a cracker
jack box.

249
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,160
It's a,
it's a power.

250
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,840
It's a power ring.
So mood ring.

251
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,210
I've seen one of those,
someone,

252
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,460
someone sent me something,
they don't just use rings,

253
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,320
right?
There's like other methods of measuring

254
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,650
it as well.
Or like you can use a bluetooth enabled

255
00:10:40,651 --> 00:10:42,150
heart rate monitor strap.
That's what it,

256
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:43,830
that's what I used to do is you wake up
in the morning,

257
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:46,590
you put on the stopping and test your
heart rate variability and it tells you,

258
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,480
you know,
if it's low you might say,

259
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:52,830
okay well today is going to be like a a
yoga day or an easy swim or walk in the

260
00:10:52,831 --> 00:10:56,610
sunshine and if it's high then that
would be a day where you'll do like

261
00:10:56,611 --> 00:10:59,580
kettle bell training or a wad or
whatever is it you're going to do.

262
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,600
And then the other thing you could use
it for is if you,

263
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,410
you'll sometimes purposefully get it
low,

264
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,710
like have some athletes that I train
where we'll work them into a state where

265
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:09,690
they've got really low heart rate
variability.

266
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,360
And then what happens is you taper,
right?

267
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,650
Like you recover,
you rest,

268
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,740
you super compensate.
So you see a bounce back of nervous

269
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:20,100
system recovery.
And you can use that to purposefully

270
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,910
adjust the training.
Yeah.

271
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,630
And if you train through a low hrv for
too long,

272
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,590
you can predict illness.
You can predict injury.

273
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,100
So it's a cool way to track training and
you can even,

274
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,540
you can look at,
um,

275
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,840
there's a high frequency in a low
frequency when you're saying you could

276
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:37,850
predict illness and injury meaning
meaning like my hrv is low but,

277
00:11:37,851 --> 00:11:39,600
but screw it,
I'm going to go train anyways.

278
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,330
But you do that day after day you get
injured.

279
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:45,750
And the weird thing is that you can have
no musculoskeletal soreness,

280
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,670
right?
Cause a lot of time that subsides,

281
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:49,200
you know,
delayed onset muscle soreness.

282
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:51,120
You see that disappear after like 48
hours.

283
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,490
And if you've crushed yourself like a,
we could talk about this letter if you

284
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:55,720
want,
but I've been doing a single set to

285
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,290
failure or a single set to failure
exercises where it's just like a 15

286
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,930
minute long workout,
but it's just full on isometrics.

287
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:05,380
As hard as you can go for 60 seconds to
two of metrics isometrics.

288
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:06,460
So you're pushing against,
it's a,

289
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:10,810
it's like this force plate machine that
you push against and you just generate

290
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:15,811
as much force as you can and it ties to
your iphone and it alerts you when

291
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:20,200
you've dropped off 60% of what you
originally producing at the beginning of

292
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:23,050
the set.
And then that's it sets done game over.

293
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,660
So you might do deadlift,
squat,

294
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,430
press overhead,
press pull down,

295
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,620
and that's the whole workout.
And then you're just recovering in

296
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,540
between each of those sets.
So this plate,

297
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,550
I mean how you doing a dead lift with a
plate?

298
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,450
It's a force plate.
So for example,

299
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,810
you're standing in Ohio like a bar,
okay.

300
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,370
That you're holding onto and the bar is
attached to the force plate via two

301
00:12:42,371 --> 00:12:46,120
stands on either like two pillars on
either side of the bar and you pull the

302
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:49,300
bar and then the force plate detects how
much force you're polling and what

303
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,180
positions.
Let's say you're standing on top of the

304
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,220
force plate,
you're supposed to choose the hardest

305
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,940
position of each exercise.
So like half,

306
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,670
if I'm,
if I'm bench pressing,

307
00:12:57,671 --> 00:13:02,650
it's like my elbows are slightly bent.
Just near the top or a squatting.

308
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,410
It's like the knees are bent that about
30 40 degrees.

309
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,270
So,
so you get into that position,

310
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,990
then you generate as much force as
possible for 60 seconds or not.

311
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,640
When I first did it,
I was at 30 seconds,

312
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,600
now I can go a little bit over a minute
where I can continue to generate as much

313
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:20,980
force as possible before it drops off to
just 60% of what I was originally

314
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:21,320
produced.

315
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,941
It's a,
it's a cool,

316
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:25,330
efficient way to train,
but you don't get that sore afterwards.

317
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,490
Right?
So musculoskeletal soreness is not a

318
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:29,980
good indicator of recovery in many
cases.

319
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,280
And that's where this hrv thing comes in
is your nervous system,

320
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,480
right?
Your central nervous system,

321
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:38,950
your neuromuscular system can be really
beat up after a workout even if the

322
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:41,740
soreness has subsided.
So that's where you use something like

323
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,360
hrv and you can say,
okay,

324
00:13:43,361 --> 00:13:45,670
well I'm not sore but my hrv is still
low.

325
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,320
So this is going to be an easy day for
me.

326
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,580
I'm sorry to act like a moron,
but explain that one more session.

327
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,590
So if your um,
if your body is not sore but your hrv is

328
00:13:55,331 --> 00:13:56,500
low,
it's,

329
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:58,240
what is it showing?
What's an indication of?

330
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:01,270
So if your body is not sore but your hrv
is low,

331
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,520
Hrv is measuring your nervous system
recovery.

332
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,780
Right?
So,

333
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,080
so you might not be fully recovered.
So what I'm saying it's like

334
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:13,081
musculoskeletal soreness or discomfort
is not necessarily the best indicator of

335
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,850
whether you're fully recovered.
You have to test the nervous system too.

336
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,630
That's so weird.
That's what I'm hearing.

337
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,650
Someone that can edit jarvey measurement
comes in and and coming full circle.

338
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,370
I've noticed when I do those morning
measurements and I'm traveling or I've

339
00:14:24,371 --> 00:14:28,420
got the Wifi enabled at my house,
my hrv is low so it's affecting my

340
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:32,170
nervous system somehow is the why do you
think the Wifi is a mind fuck.

341
00:14:32,171 --> 00:14:33,550
Do you think it's really doing something
too?

342
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,270
I think is doing something but then
there's in this room there's the placebo

343
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,230
effect.
I feel it.

344
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,040
I feel real say that's trying to feel
it.

345
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,440
That's why you're a moron right now.
You've got the Wifi going,

346
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,430
what's going on Jamie?

347
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,670
What do you got the hrv off of my eye.
Oh you just t what'd you use?

348
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,940
The fingertip.
My Apple Watch the Apple Watch tests.

349
00:14:52,941 --> 00:14:55,010
Your hrv.
So it's been doing it for the whole time

350
00:14:55,011 --> 00:14:57,230
I've had it on,
but it's paradoxical because the apple

351
00:14:57,231 --> 00:15:01,640
watch is making Wifi so it's so
confusing.

352
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,381
Yeah,
no,

353
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,161
that's what I was talking about.
This,

354
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,670
this ring,
uh,

355
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,810
bought this in Finland like three years
ago because I wanted like a body

356
00:15:08,811 --> 00:15:11,510
tracking device.
I want to track my hrv and I want to

357
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,150
track my sleep cycles.
But I don't like sleeping all night

358
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,420
cause like I sleep with my kind of like
my hand tucked down by my Dick,

359
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:18,061
you know,
like in,

360
00:15:18,061 --> 00:15:18,830
in,
by my cry.

361
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,960
I don't want something just like sleep
like this.

362
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,040
I kinda,
I sleep on my side,

363
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,320
my hands tucked underneath me and there
and lily would be like,

364
00:15:27,321 --> 00:15:31,730
my right hand is right down around my
bowls basically while I'm sleeping and I

365
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,280
didn't want something just like blasting
me.

366
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,580
That makes sense.
Sleeping.

367
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,540
So cause it was,
if it was on my wrist or on my finger or

368
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,910
wherever.
So this has like a built in computer and

369
00:15:40,911 --> 00:15:44,300
you can put it in airplane mode and
it'll still collect all the hrv data and

370
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,650
everything else.
Then when you want to take it out of

371
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,250
airplane mode and sync it to your phone
and upload all your sleep data or your

372
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:50,960
hrv data or anything else,
you can do it.

373
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,800
So,
so that's,

374
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,690
that's why I wear this ring instead of
like a fitbit or jawbone or,

375
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,550
or,
or Jamie's stupid Apple Watch.

376
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,780
I never know whether or not being
ridiculous with this stuff.

377
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,410
Like with worrying about phones being a
man like,

378
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,200
but cancer,
you know,

379
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,290
cause it's somebody,
some dude told me that once that he got

380
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,930
cancer,
I think it was testing the cancer side

381
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,330
and the guy was saying,
do you keep your phone in your right

382
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:14,690
pocket?

383
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,620
He's,
I guess I do.

384
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,360
The doctor was telling him that.
I was like,

385
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:20,750
how the fuck does the doctor know?
Like this is not proven stuff.

386
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,120
This is all real speculation,
right?

387
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,750
I mean it's tricky because,
I mean you can say about the bone cancer

388
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,740
on the golf course,
right.

389
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:28,950
But,
but a lot of people that,

390
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,800
I think there's a class action lawsuit
it there,

391
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:34,100
cause I think they tested the water and
there was whatever the fuck the stuff

392
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:38,030
that they use for fertilizer or
pesticides.

393
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,630
That's what I was telling you.
I was concerned about the,

394
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:44,631
the Dick cancer thing because those stem
cells like a stem cells into your Dick.

395
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,100
Well,
for the past three,

396
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,290
so men's health magazine just had me
write this article called New Year New

397
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,200
Dick where they have me,
I'm sorry.

398
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,400
So you get them.
It's got a,

399
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,630
it's the issue with Marky Mark Wahlberg
on the [inaudible] on the cover.

400
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,870
How appropriate.
Yeah.

401
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,810
Yeah.
Like how to make a small Dick Bigger.

402
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,010
Right.
But marky mark on the,

403
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,650
on the cover and now he can,
he can beat me with his,

404
00:17:03,651 --> 00:17:06,070
with his four foot tall.
Fisticuffs uh,

405
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,080
anyways though.
So they have me go around and doing

406
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:13,760
everything that I could do to enhance
sexual performance or increase the size

407
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:16,870
of your deck or increased blood flow or
increased orgasm quality or you know,

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,180
they just wanted to find out where
everything from like fricking gas

409
00:17:20,181 --> 00:17:23,030
station,
Dick Pills to which by the way,

410
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,520
those things do not have it.
And then what they say they have in

411
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:26,510
them.
What do you think?

412
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,380
So,
so they,

413
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,170
you know,
they say like epimedium and your role

414
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:34,030
come a long jack and they're really
horny goat weed Algebra.

415
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,410
Yeah.
It's basically for consult benefil

416
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,060
right.
The active ingredient in Cialis or

417
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:41,150
Viagra and then a,
a Phaedra and copious amounts of

418
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:41,984
caffeine.

419
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,300
So I would take these things and just a
little,

420
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:45,220
I feel like my head was gonna explode.
I mean it's,

421
00:17:45,221 --> 00:17:47,870
it's like drinking 10 cups of coffee.
Yeah.

422
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,190
We have a,
a friend of ours who predicted

423
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:53,750
accurately that Jon Jones was taken
those things when he pissed hot cause he

424
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,230
was like,
those things have everything in them.

425
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,570
And he's like a John Jones does coke.
He goes,

426
00:17:57,571 --> 00:18:01,220
I guarantee he's taken dick pills
actually entertaining to read because

427
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,030
it's all like the like,
it's like arena,

428
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,510
Chinese fortune cookie,
right?

429
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,340
Maximum Potency Vigara and everything's
spelled wrong.

430
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,750
Uh,
but the,

431
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:11,160
uh,
so they have me doing that.

432
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,310
They did analysis of the ingredients.
Did you actually get it tested?

433
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,520
No,
no.

434
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,920
We,
we went to all these labs.

435
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:21,000
They wouldn't let us actually test,
but apparently the FDA has tested them.

436
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:24,260
And if you go to the fda.gov website,
they have like these,

437
00:18:24,261 --> 00:18:26,910
these warnings out about the actual
ingredient.

438
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:28,710
We took,
the five that they had warnings about

439
00:18:28,711 --> 00:18:31,960
and tested them and the day and day,
um,

440
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,863
yeah,
you don't feel well.

441
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,340
You feel like your head's gonna explode
and your hands get all cold and clammy.

442
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:36,630
And some of them say,
I don't know why,

443
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:38,070
but they say to take them in the
morning.

444
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,620
Right.
Which doesn't to me makes sense.

445
00:18:40,621 --> 00:18:43,900
But you take him in the morning and so
you just feel completely screwed up like

446
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,340
the whole morning.
It's like you're just mainlining coffee.

447
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,080
So they did that.
They did.

448
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,310
Um,
have you heard of this?

449
00:18:50,311 --> 00:18:52,440
Like acoustic sound wave therapy for
your Dick.

450
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:57,090
I'm serious.
So you're going to answer,

451
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,510
no,
no,

452
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,490
I haven't said this.
This is a clinic in Florida.

453
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,380
It was called gainswave and you'd go
down to Florida.

454
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:05,730
We go down there and uh,
and I walk in and the first thing they

455
00:19:05,731 --> 00:19:08,700
do is they hand me this like syringe
full of the numbing cream and I'm

456
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:10,320
supposed to just like put it everywhere.

457
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,670
And so I,
I smeared it,

458
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:12,810
you know,
my balls,

459
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:15,120
my like I just went everywhere cause I
didn't really know what they were,

460
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,700
what they were going to do and I wanted,
I want it all,

461
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:20,280
all shields activated going to go to,
into this thing.

462
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,700
So I walk into the room and,
and my Dick's all numb.

463
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,160
They had me lay down and so my legs are
splayed.

464
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:30,330
I'm on this exam room table and this gal
comes in and she's got like this giant

465
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:33,540
won attached to a machine and they do
this for women too by the way.

466
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,880
They put like a condom on the end of it
and,

467
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,610
and she just basically goes to town for
like 20 minutes.

468
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:43,611
Like a Jackhammer was like everywhere
around 20 minutes supposedly.

469
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:46,530
Yeah.
Supposedly it breaks open old blood

470
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:51,531
vessels and builds new blood vessels and
once the numbing cream wears off you're

471
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:53,520
supposed to to perform a lot better.

472
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:55,800
And then they combine this,
you know how we were,

473
00:19:55,801 --> 00:19:58,560
we were talking about like with your
shoulder if you inject it you should do

474
00:19:58,561 --> 00:20:02,760
like electro stammer vibration or
something to get the injection deeper

475
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:05,130
into the tissue.
So you think same thing with this,

476
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:08,220
they do the PRP.
So they do prp into your deck and then

477
00:20:08,221 --> 00:20:10,740
they followed up and you get,
you get a nerve block first.

478
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,450
I actually,
I thought,

479
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:15,720
I don't know why I thought they put the
needle just like right in the pee hole,

480
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,140
which to me made sense but it doesn't
really,

481
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:22,860
I mean you want it in the actual tips.
So they actually go like up where the

482
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,690
dick attaches like the tissue at the
top,

483
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,250
two nerve blocks on either side and then
the prp and later on,

484
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,050
like a couple months later,
the Hemi do stem cells.

485
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,710
They actually extracted like four months
later from my back and we did a stem

486
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:35,310
cell injection.

487
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,030
But this acoustic sound wave therapy,
uh,

488
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,640
with the PRP,
like it wears off and you literally just

489
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:43,710
like get boners all the time,
like,

490
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,070
like all night long for like a month.
So the acoustic sound therapy's supposed

491
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:51,460
to be breaking up.
Blood vessel breaks open old board

492
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:55,600
vessels,
gainswave procedure breaks up plaque

493
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,240
formation in blood vessels and
stimulates the growth of new blood

494
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:01,980
vessels in the penis,
low intensity extra Kapore iol shockwave

495
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,630
therapy.
That's going to sell a lot of,

496
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,620
uh,
of procedures.

497
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,900
I like the drawing we shot before and
after.

498
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,780
Before your veins real tired.
Yeah,

499
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,690
before it looks like,
like an old hunched over man.

500
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:17,170
Then all of a sudden vigor.
It looks like a bodybuilding saying.

501
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,090
Yeah,
I used to do bodybuilding.

502
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,090
So is that horrible sport?
Do you think it's real?

503
00:21:22,091 --> 00:21:23,590
Do you think that's really doing
something?

504
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:26,680
I have worked for me and I worked for me
in the,

505
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,090
um,
so yeah,

506
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:28,841
the,
the gas station,

507
00:21:28,841 --> 00:21:31,030
Dick Pills,
they do the acoustic sound wave therapy,

508
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,420
but the [inaudible] injections,
they had me do like the,

509
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,550
uh,
knowledge stem cells with about stem

510
00:21:36,551 --> 00:21:37,270
cells,
stem cells.

511
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,280
But that mean that not everybody's going
to be able to do that,

512
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:41,320
but that was the best bar.
None.

513
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:44,650
Like they,
so I went down to Florida and again,

514
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,780
Florida,
I don't know what I think is cause all

515
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:50,720
the old people live in Florida.
Like Dale,

516
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,810
all the people like hunched over the
steering wheel is there,

517
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,820
but all the guys have great Dick's.
They can't drive.

518
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,380
They have their blinker on for like two
miles before they turn,

519
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:01,150
but their dicks are primed.
So the,

520
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:04,450
um,
the stem cell thing was that the US stem

521
00:22:04,451 --> 00:22:09,451
cell clinic in Florida and I went in
there and they extract all the fat for

522
00:22:09,581 --> 00:22:11,410
me.
They took the fat on my back.

523
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,380
And what they do is they,
they have,

524
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,490
um,
it's called an enzymatic process where

525
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,520
they use something that breaks down the
Collagen in the fat and then they have

526
00:22:24,221 --> 00:22:27,160
the stem cells that get separated from
the fat.

527
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,290
And apparently it's a very,
very high in these angiogenic like,

528
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:34,100
like vascular vessel building,
uh,

529
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,390
compounds.
And so then you get that it,

530
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:38,320
it's high in the,
um,

531
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,600
Mesenchymal,
the MSC,

532
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,770
the MSC cells,
which,

533
00:22:41,771 --> 00:22:45,040
which are supposedly the very good ones
to inject in.

534
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,100
So I injected those,
um,

535
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,250
or I had a doctor in spokane,
so they shipped him to spokane on ice

536
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,870
and they show up at my house at like
7:00 AM right.

537
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,600
Because you got to get them delivered
the same day.

538
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,270
And then I had my appointment at the
doctor at 9:00 AM and I went to the

539
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:00,010
doctor and you know,
very,

540
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,440
it was like Deja Vu from Florida.
Like I go and do the,

541
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:03,640
do the numbing.
Yeah,

542
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:04,151
no,
no,

543
00:23:04,151 --> 00:23:05,560
you're going to do this.
Oh yeah.

544
00:23:05,561 --> 00:23:08,110
I called him and I want it was kind of
friends with the doctor.

545
00:23:08,111 --> 00:23:08,891
Yeah.
Yeah.

546
00:23:08,891 --> 00:23:10,840
There's a picture,
I think there's a picture of him in the

547
00:23:10,841 --> 00:23:12,130
mega,
cause they put all sorts of crazy

548
00:23:12,131 --> 00:23:14,440
pictures in the magazine because they
haven't given like infrared light on my

549
00:23:14,441 --> 00:23:14,950
balls.

550
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,640
And I have look this big thing called
the [inaudible] that they had me

551
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:21,860
standing in front of every day.
Like I Jack my light,

552
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,410
I'll tell you about the stem cells and
I'll tell you what's the chance that,

553
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,170
because it's crazy.
Um,

554
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,200
so the uh,
the stem cells,

555
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:33,370
I went to this doctor in spokane and he
injected these,

556
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,380
these stem cells from my fat after
they've grown for like several in this

557
00:23:38,381 --> 00:23:39,700
case,
I think they were down there for like

558
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,580
eight weeks,
but I mean they,

559
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,420
they can do same day injections.
But for me,

560
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,130
I didn't have enough fat cause for me it
was right in the middle of,

561
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,170
I raced professionally and also of
course racing.

562
00:23:48,171 --> 00:23:50,480
So I'm just like lean as hell as I go in
there.

563
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:51,950
So they could,
they could barely get enough fat,

564
00:23:51,951 --> 00:23:53,750
so they had to grow them for a longer
period of time.

565
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,930
A lot of times they can inject same day.
So I went into spokane,

566
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,580
uh,
at this clinic and Spokane,

567
00:23:58,581 --> 00:23:59,960
La,
new integrative clinic.

568
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:02,270
It's like this osteopathic medical
clinic with all these,

569
00:24:02,271 --> 00:24:04,070
you know,
nice receptionist when you walk in the

570
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:04,904
door.
And this,

571
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,380
this,
this doctor who,

572
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:08,570
uh,
he's done stem cell injections before,

573
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,460
but he never actually injected them into
someone's deck.

574
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,380
So it was kinda like the Guinea pig for
this.

575
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,260
Do you have to explain to him what areas
you're supposed to do?

576
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,950
He researched it and I think he actually
talked to the folks at the stem cell

577
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:21,440
clinic beforehand and make sure that
they were on the,

578
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,930
on the same page.
Then when I fly all the way back down to

579
00:24:23,931 --> 00:24:26,240
Florida,
it's super inconvenient and it's just a

580
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:27,074
deck,
right?

581
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,940
They'll make more Sunday.
They're growing kidneys and ears.

582
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:33,680
They'll grow Dick Someday.
So I'm,

583
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,520
so I got an injected and that was,
um,

584
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,370
uh,
first of all look like it got like run

585
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:43,610
over by a semi truck for like two days.
It was like all black and blue or the

586
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:45,260
injection you serve was,
yeah,

587
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,280
yeah,
yeah.

588
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,270
I'd be super nervous.
Like,

589
00:24:47,271 --> 00:24:50,030
what do we got infected?
It could've gotten infected.

590
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,800
Cancer.
I've had Marissa and I would not wish

591
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,730
Murcia on your Dick.
I need get mercy a triathlon.

592
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,380
I,
I got it.

593
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,570
This was at though at the wildflower
triathlon,

594
00:25:02,571 --> 00:25:05,360
like coming back,
my flight got delayed and I was covering

595
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:07,970
all these kids like an off road
triathlon and I had all these scrapes

596
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:11,600
and wounds and I think,
I think my layover was in Vegas,

597
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,940
I don't remember where,
but I had to check into hotel flight got

598
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:17,420
delayed and I slept in this hotel room
that I swear like there must've been

599
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:20,570
something on the bed cause within a few
days like it was all,

600
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,310
you know,
it gets all nasty and cakey and then it

601
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:25,040
was eating a whole,
I wrote a whole blog post about this on

602
00:25:25,041 --> 00:25:26,720
my website and they see,
you can see,

603
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,170
pull up the hole in the back of my leg.
It's nasty,

604
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:31,230
scares the shit out of him.

605
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,900
Just,
just search for like Ben Greenfield

606
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,550
staff and,
and you'll see the pictures.

607
00:25:34,551 --> 00:25:37,330
But it was eating a whole in the back of
my leg and my,

608
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,930
my kids' role now,
once a week.

609
00:25:38,931 --> 00:25:40,400
And I buy on,
I get the,

610
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:42,860
the defense soap from on it and as soon
as they come,

611
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,610
as soon as they come back in the door,
I'd,

612
00:25:44,611 --> 00:25:47,780
I'd have them go into the shower
upstairs and defense and race down.

613
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,760
Yeah.
They sent a bunch of different wipes and

614
00:25:49,761 --> 00:25:52,210
stuff for people that train in a place
that doesn't have a,

615
00:25:52,211 --> 00:25:53,690
a shower.
Yeah.

616
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:55,780
You gotta be careful that end,
uh,

617
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,120
thieves essential oil.
Like it's like going to a whole bunch of

618
00:25:59,121 --> 00:26:02,270
companies make this version of essential
oil called thieves.

619
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:06,350
It's like clove and roads named after
these thieves who apparently never got

620
00:26:06,351 --> 00:26:09,200
clove cinnamon,
Eucalyptus,

621
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:10,780
which is really good for staff and
Rosemay.

622
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,120
It's actually named that there's like
the story of like these four thieves

623
00:26:14,121 --> 00:26:18,310
that apparently traveled around the
world and they would rob Holmes and,

624
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,140
and uh,
and they never got sick.

625
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:23,850
Like that's basically the story.
I'm sure this was,

626
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,590
this was some board table at a,
at a multilevel marketing essential oils

627
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:29,990
company.
Somebody came up with this story or it

628
00:26:29,991 --> 00:26:30,950
could be true.
I don't know.

629
00:26:30,951 --> 00:26:32,870
But the um,
yeah,

630
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:34,700
the,
the stem cells into the Dick that,

631
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:36,800
that was an interesting one,
but it did.

632
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,550
Um,
I think from what I can tell,

633
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,260
looking in the mirror,
it got bigger.

634
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,980
I'm pretty,
how much?

635
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:45,230
So half inch.
Oh,

636
00:26:45,231 --> 00:26:49,560
like maybe that much,
like enough to tell and my erections got

637
00:26:49,561 --> 00:26:52,500
bigger and my orgasms got a lot better
for how long they,

638
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,010
they're still like that still.
Yeah.

639
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,620
So it fits.
So I think the stem cell,

640
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:57,000
it's kind of like stick with you.

641
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,580
Um,
well last week I got them,

642
00:26:59,581 --> 00:27:03,460
I told you I'm training for the RKC
Kettlebell cert and I was doing the,

643
00:27:03,461 --> 00:27:07,110
the hundred reps in five minutes snatch
test with a,

644
00:27:07,111 --> 00:27:10,470
with a one and a half food.
And I felt something just go,

645
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,590
I was at 84 reps and I felt something go
in my back and I got stem cells injected

646
00:27:15,841 --> 00:27:18,060
all up and down my ql,
my multifidus,

647
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:22,770
my rector spinae into my so ass.
But then they also sent them to me,

648
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:26,670
to my house and I did that same vat sell
the stuff that's rich and the

649
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,280
Mesenchymal stem cells into the
bloodstream.

650
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,620
So I did a push ivy into the
bloodstream.

651
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,040
That's the one that you would have to go
out of the country to do a,

652
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,240
normally you're not supposed to do that.
Like that's tech.

653
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,510
It's technically not legal for someone
to inject you with your own stem cells

654
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:43,470
into your bloodstream.

655
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,160
But if you get your stem cells extracted
and they're stored and they send them to

656
00:27:47,161 --> 00:27:49,380
you,
you can technically inject them.

657
00:27:49,381 --> 00:27:52,320
If you do it yourself where you're like,
have a friend who's a nurse or whatever

658
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,360
and you,
it's literally just like a push ivy.

659
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,030
It was like 30 seconds.
We,

660
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:58,950
we caught it on video for a men's health
films,

661
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,750
so they'll publish a video at some
point.

662
00:28:00,751 --> 00:28:03,060
But I was super nervous because it's
like a few thousand dollars worth of

663
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:04,530
stem cells that,
you know,

664
00:28:04,531 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm,
I'm trying to hit the vein and make sure

665
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,920
that they go in the right way and
inject.

666
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:09,330
It's a very,
very small amount.

667
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,480
What you had to be the most nervous
getting them shut in your Dick though.

668
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:14,310
No,
I was kinda nervous.

669
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:15,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

670
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:19,760
That's super experimental.
I do a lot of that though.

671
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,630
I mean like that.
That's kind of my shtick.

672
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:25,470
Like I do a lot of immersive journalism,
a lot of self experimentation and a lot

673
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:27,680
of a lot of Guinea pig type stuff.
Uh,

674
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,280
and I'm,
I'm not dead yet and I still have my

675
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:30,930
deck so I,
you look great.

676
00:28:30,931 --> 00:28:31,440
I'm happy.
Yeah.

677
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,430
Thank you.
Look very healthy.

678
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:35,850
I'm 22 I'm actually,
oh yeah,

679
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,140
that's,
is that,

680
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,093
yeah.
Is that,

681
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,210
that's one of them.
That is,

682
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,650
yeah.
That's an image from my website that's

683
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:43,170
not as deep as it got.
I don't think that's the worst photo.

684
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,230
The worst one I've ever seen.
He's Kevin randomness stuff it with

685
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,670
iodine.
Like they have you got a sore?

686
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,210
No,
they have like these long iodine strips

687
00:28:51,211 --> 00:28:54,540
when you get the [inaudible] and it's
like it's flesh eating bacteria.

688
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,890
Yeah,
that's me too.

689
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,470
And they stuffed see that hole in the
middle.

690
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,860
They stuff like iodine.
It's like a stick in there,

691
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,770
like a strip that has,
but they literally stuffed it in there

692
00:29:04,771 --> 00:29:05,604
and you can feel it.

693
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,290
You got,
you were telling me you got dry needling

694
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,930
done and you know like that weird
pressure.

695
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,200
It's not like pain,
but it's like a weird pressure from dry

696
00:29:13,201 --> 00:29:15,720
needling.
This is like that except pain,

697
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,580
right?
Like it's both the pain and the PR.

698
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,020
It was horrible,
horrible.

699
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:23,220
Like I've had some falls and [inaudible]
staff in their leg where they have like

700
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,120
all small golf ball size holding their
leg and they literally had a packet full

701
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:30,300
of that kind of gauze covering.
I don't like how you say a small golf

702
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,660
golf balls,
a big hole for the back of the leg golf

703
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,860
ball,
but it's like smaller than a golf ball

704
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,410
or go large marble.
Any hole in the back of the leg.

705
00:29:37,411 --> 00:29:39,270
And my opinion is too big I've ever
seen.

706
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,500
It's Kevin Randleman.
See if he could find Kevin randleman

707
00:29:41,501 --> 00:29:43,660
staff.
He had open holes.

708
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,480
We could see his muscle structure under
his armpit.

709
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,830
It was horrific.
Gosh,

710
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,420
he would,
he never really recovered.

711
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,670
He was dying.
He died.

712
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,520
He died young from that.
Who knows what he died from.

713
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:56,800
But look at the whole,
I think I still have it.

714
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,060
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.

715
00:29:58,061 --> 00:30:00,540
That's uh,
that's his muscle tissue around it.

716
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,320
What body part is that?
That's his underarm.

717
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,900
Oh my goodness.
Oh my goodness.

718
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,430
Yeah.
That's how bad it was.

719
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,740
That looks like he got shot.
He does.

720
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,240
Yeah.
He was rotting away.

721
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,380
And I don't know if he didn't treat it
quickly enough or I don't know if it was

722
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:18,820
just really aggressive,
but it's a real common thing in gyms.

723
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,950
And then once you get it,
it stays with you.

724
00:30:20,951 --> 00:30:23,140
Like it stays in your bloodstream.
Like I still,

725
00:30:23,141 --> 00:30:27,180
like I have an essential oil diffuser on
my desk and I put thieves in it everyday

726
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:30,340
and I just diffuse essential oils in the
air while I'm working into the,

727
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,320
yeah,
it's like a nebulizing essential oil

728
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,920
diffuser and I just,
just,

729
00:30:33,921 --> 00:30:34,840
just to play it safe.

730
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,970
Right.
I just want to be breathing that in one

731
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:37,900
day,
just in case.

732
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,711
Fuck.
That's,

733
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,360
um,
and that's the other thing is I stand in

734
00:30:40,361 --> 00:30:42,040
front of this light,
this infrared light,

735
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:46,150
and this is that Dick Light.
Yes.

736
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,520
It's called a Jew.
And,

737
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,850
um,
so it,

738
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,330
they've,
they've done these studies on testicular

739
00:30:52,331 --> 00:30:55,810
and sperm production and they've found
that there's a wavelength that's like

740
00:30:55,811 --> 00:31:00,811
600 to 800 nanometers wavelength of
light that if you expose the testicles

741
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:04,270
to that for five to 20 minutes a day,
it's based on this concept of photo

742
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:08,320
biomodulation.
So I originally got into this whole

743
00:31:08,321 --> 00:31:10,870
photo biomodulation thing when this
company,

744
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,520
cause I,
cause I blog and people just send me

745
00:31:12,521 --> 00:31:17,140
these weird things to my doorstep to,
to try and they sent me this like nasal

746
00:31:17,141 --> 00:31:20,860
probe that you put up your nose and it's
got like a helmet on it.

747
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,330
You could,
you could look it up Jamie,

748
00:31:22,331 --> 00:31:23,070
if you want us,
call them,

749
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,040
uh,
via light.

750
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,390
And it produces this light that
supposedly activates a part of your

751
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,210
metrics.
So you have like your electron transport

752
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:34,450
chain in your Mitochondria and there's a
part of that called the cytochrome c

753
00:31:34,451 --> 00:31:39,160
oxidase and it apparently activates more
activity in the cytochrome c oxidase to

754
00:31:39,161 --> 00:31:41,950
produce more ATP in this case in neural
tissue.

755
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:45,070
Cause you have it on your head.
And they were using this in dementia and

756
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,620
in Alzheimer's patients.
But it turns out it's almost like a,

757
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,630
like a nootropic for your head.
Yes.

758
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:52,900
That's me at my desk back,
back when I was back when I was a young

759
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:54,340
Chinese woman,
my desk,

760
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,800
um,
up your nose on your head.

761
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,120
I like how that guy is just like looking
pensively it's cross rate of the well

762
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,220
and she's reading a book like he's
reading twilight.

763
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,570
That's what I originally did.
They sent me just the nose one and I

764
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:06,900
felt shorted because a,
they had like the full head.

765
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:11,250
So ask him for the full head one and
fucking weird and you can feel like

766
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,170
Holtz it.
And uh,

767
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:14,020
and uh,
what's the um,

768
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:18,460
it was I think it was MPR.
It was either radio lab or um,

769
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,310
let's see.
Other science when the end,

770
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,430
I think it think it might be radiolab.
They did a study on that or a,

771
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,900
or a story unlike this 10 to 40 hertz
frequency know,

772
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,200
talked about us.
That's tdcs oh nine volts trans

773
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,640
stimulation.
I have one of those to the Trans direct

774
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,640
cranial stimulation,
that halo device that you wear before a

775
00:32:36,641 --> 00:32:39,440
workout and use that thing.
No one at a time,

776
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,800
one at a time.
So this photo biomodulation I'm putting

777
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:45,110
this thing,
you know the probe in my ear and you're

778
00:32:45,111 --> 00:32:49,460
not even supposed to use it too much
because it produces so much atp that if

779
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:52,040
you amp up cellular activity in neural
tissue too much,

780
00:32:52,041 --> 00:32:54,230
you produced too many reactive oxygen
species.

781
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,690
Like that's a byproduct of cellular
metabolism.

782
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,930
It's just like if you eat too much,
you produce a lot of byproduct of making

783
00:32:59,931 --> 00:33:03,080
energy and that's why it's one of the
reasons why fasting is good for you.

784
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,200
Like it cleans up the system and you
don't make as many free radicals.

785
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,120
The same reason like Ketosis is good for
you,

786
00:33:08,121 --> 00:33:09,710
right?
You're not burning as much glucose,

787
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:12,740
you don't produce as many free radicals.
Same concept with this.

788
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,260
You don't want to use it all the time
because you get too much activity.

789
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,740
You produce too many free radicals are
too many reactive oxygen species,

790
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:21,560
but every other day use it.
So New Year,

791
00:33:21,561 --> 00:33:22,400
new you,
new Dick.

792
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:24,140
How often did you,
well,

793
00:33:24,141 --> 00:33:27,230
this is from my head and I,
and this was like a couple of years ago,

794
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,600
same thing a couple of years,
and it was like a cup of coffee for my

795
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,070
brain.
Like every time I'd wake up,

796
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,420
I put this thing out when I'm working at
my desk.

797
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,060
So then,
um,

798
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,980
this company that makes these lights
that are very similar,

799
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:42,010
activate cytochrome c oxidase,
activates a release of nitric oxide.

800
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,400
But if you do it on your testicles,
specifically the cell that it works on

801
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:49,190
is the Leydig cells in the testes,
which are responsible for producing

802
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:51,020
testosterone.
So you're basically stimulating the

803
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:55,040
leydig cells in the testes the same way
that you'd stimulate like neural tissue

804
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,830
using this one for your head.
So I'd had success with the thing for my

805
00:33:57,831 --> 00:34:00,170
head.
So I tried this one for the balls and

806
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:02,510
the Dick.
And what I did was I would just Jack my

807
00:34:02,511 --> 00:34:05,510
pants down for five to 20 minutes a day
while I'm saying that,

808
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:05,691
what?
Yeah,

809
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:08,390
I'm diffusing my essential oils that I
got to pick on my head.

810
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,710
And,
um,

811
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,530
and it works like you actually get more
blood flow.

812
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:13,080
I mean,
I,

813
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,250
I didn't do a control study just pulling
my pants down and standing there for

814
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,390
five to 20 minutes south.

815
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,430
It without the light on.
I should,

816
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,980
I should do that at some point.
Cause maybe it's just like the whole,

817
00:34:21,981 --> 00:34:24,850
you know,
it's like supposedly going combat style

818
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,320
is supposed to be good for your Dick to
combat style.

819
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,170
So there's you,
that's me balls out.

820
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,630
I'm standing on standing on my wobble
board.

821
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,680
I got my ball of light and um,
that's actually not my office.

822
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,600
I wasn't one of my friend's houses cause
he had one.

823
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,580
And uh,
anyways,

824
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,540
uh,
and um,

825
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,450
obviously I'm not naked,
but normally I would,

826
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,860
I would,
I would be nude and uh,

827
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
yeah.
And,

828
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,520
and you just basically new your balls.
Yeah.

829
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,090
And it's like a warm teddy bear.
Increased vascularity,

830
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,590
better size,
better orgasms.

831
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,090
I mean like,
like all this stuff.

832
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,340
It seemed to have a,
so all of this stuff seems to make your

833
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:00,860
day had some kind of where it had some
kind of an effect.

834
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,600
Yeah.
So,

835
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,290
um,
PRP injections,

836
00:35:03,291 --> 00:35:05,330
acoustic sound wave therapy,
stem cells,

837
00:35:05,331 --> 00:35:07,220
the infrared light,
a gas station,

838
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:09,410
Dick Pills.
And that's the one I would not repeat.

839
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,900
Um,
and then they had me do some ayurvedic

840
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,820
stuff,
like the no ejaculation thing.

841
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,310
We just kind of like where,
where Tantra have sex.

842
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:20,150
But you pull out the river like the uh,
it's a book,

843
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:24,500
it's called the the multiorgasmic men.
So I read that and learned how to like,

844
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:25,520
you know,
pull back,

845
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:28,070
like,
like not actually orgasm and you're like

846
00:35:28,071 --> 00:35:30,770
pull it inside and then you finish up
and you're just like pissed off the rest

847
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:33,050
of the day.
He tell he can't sleep at night because

848
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,070
you're all,
you're just thought why?

849
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:38,340
So you could see how it would work.
But for me it's like I got kids and my

850
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:40,820
wife and I sneak away to get it on.
Like I wanna I want,

851
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,130
I want the full meal deal.

852
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,420
So I didn't like that.
The,

853
00:35:44,421 --> 00:35:48,870
the no ejaculate reverse orgasm thing.
But it's supposed to do like when you

854
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:52,260
internalize the orgasm,
when you keep it inside.

855
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:56,190
So this is all based on Chinese medicine
principles.

856
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,560
Like your,
I think it's called your gin or your

857
00:35:58,561 --> 00:36:00,360
Djing or something like that,
but

858
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,690
you have this,
this energy,

859
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,291
you know,
your,

860
00:36:04,291 --> 00:36:07,560
your ci or your Pronto,
your Chakra,

861
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:11,770
your life force.
And apparently orgasming is an in and

862
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,840
coming like ejaculating is supposedly
one of the ways that you give some of

863
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:18,660
that life force away.
Like you release some of your vitality

864
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:23,750
and by having sex but then not coming,
you're actually creating that same

865
00:36:23,941 --> 00:36:27,570
hormonal response of oxytocin and
testosterone and all these things that

866
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:30,240
we release when we're having sex.
One way ejaculate,

867
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:33,120
but without actually giving up that,
that vitality,

868
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,750
that life force there was even like I
found,

869
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,710
I found like a tables were like based on
your age,

870
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,490
there's a certain frequency with which
you're supposed to ejaculate.

871
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,020
Like,
like the younger you are,

872
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:44,760
it's like every two days,
every three days.

873
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:46,780
And the older you get,
like it gets to a certain point where

874
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:48,270
you're like 70 years old and it's like
every,

875
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,970
every month or something like that.
And so it's,

876
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:52,380
it's,
it's kind of interesting.

877
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:53,340
But again,
I don't,

878
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,710
I don't like that.
Like I want,

879
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,820
I want,
I want to finish.

880
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,750
But again,
preconceived prejudice that you have

881
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,370
though.
Like a wonder if you just went into it

882
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:04,770
like completely objectively would have
some sort of a benefit.

883
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,660
Uh,
or maybe you'd just get like mineral

884
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,900
depleted and you lose all your zinc and
everything else you need to make sperm

885
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,030
and you'll start to cramp up.
I Dunno.

886
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,710
To me,
you'd have to be ejaculate in a lot,

887
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,450
I think.
So when you were doing all these

888
00:37:15,451 --> 00:37:16,950
different things,
how much of a time,

889
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,400
like how much of a buffer did you give
yourself in between each thing?

890
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,410
So it was not a well controlled
experiment at all.

891
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,700
It was like three months.
It's just like,

892
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,210
Hey,
do that.

893
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,230
Hey,
why don't we try this?

894
00:37:25,231 --> 00:37:25,681
Let's say,
hey,

895
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,020
the articles coming out soon,
we should toss this in there too.

896
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,720
So they probably compounded,
it was not a well controlled experiment

897
00:37:30,721 --> 00:37:33,420
and I did a lot over three months.
Like it would have been a lot better and

898
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,760
just try one thing at a time.
But I,

899
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,610
but I,
but I am well hung and very vascular

900
00:37:38,611 --> 00:37:40,110
now.
Credulous will experiment.

901
00:37:40,111 --> 00:37:41,190
So,
so there's that.

902
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,390
Um,
so yeah,

903
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:43,740
it's called New Year,
so new year,

904
00:37:43,741 --> 00:37:45,630
new deck.
And it really did make your Dick Bigger.

905
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,450
So do you think there's any help out
hope out there?

906
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,370
Asking for a friend,
guys who have microdex micro,

907
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,090
what's a micro Dick [inaudible] small
penis.

908
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,960
I would imagine there's whole pantry.
They could be like great politicians or

909
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,240
influential and that there's gotta be
some kind of trade off,

910
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:03,660
right?

911
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,300
Like if you,
if you have sickle cell anemia,

912
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:08,160
apparently it keep protected from
malaria.

913
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:11,280
So maybe if you have a small Dick,
it protects you from some kind of

914
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:14,070
horrible accident later on in lighting.
So I don't think so.

915
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:16,920
I just wonder like,
if there's a way to fix that and people,

916
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,890
if maybe this was the way it was.
I've always felt like that's gotta be

917
00:38:19,891 --> 00:38:21,610
one of the saddest things yet.
Um,

918
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,330
again,
like you never know.

919
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:27,140
There could be a bunch of nine year old
man walking around with Dick Cancer 60

920
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:30,090
years from now who heard this?
And I went and got injected.

921
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:32,730
So I will not attest to the safety of
it,

922
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,060
but kind of test the efficacy of it.
Um,

923
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:37,510
so some of those things would work for
that.

924
00:38:37,511 --> 00:38:39,370
For All those people walking around
there.

925
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,790
All of your listeners have small dicks
gave them salvation.

926
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,380
There's old fellows.
There's hope.

927
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,011
So.
So yeah.

928
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:49,050
That's um,
is that like you're,

929
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,420
you're saying it's still works.
Like it's,

930
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:54,030
how long ago did you do this experiment?
Oh,

931
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,500
I mean like the,
the magazine is still on the shelves.

932
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,660
Like it just kept going.
He said,

933
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,880
how long is it was like [inaudible] was
like starting,

934
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:05,940
I got the stem cells extracted in August
of 2017 so this is like the end of

935
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,000
January,
eight weeks later I got those shot into

936
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:11,890
the deck and we only made a couple of
weeks,

937
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,700
months later after they really grow in a
lot of these Mesenchymal mesenchymal

938
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,250
stem cells.
I got them injected into my bloodstream

939
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:21,190
and in the like that injury that I'm
fighting in my back right now.

940
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:24,190
Um,
and I'd done some other things before

941
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,530
that for,
for the backend,

942
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,610
for tissue like peptides like this,
uh,

943
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,910
the bpc one 57 that we were just talking
about before.

944
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:31,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

945
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,280
Which is really interesting stuff.
I mean,

946
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:36,790
it's not,
it's not intended for human consumption,

947
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,760
but it's also not banned by water.
I mean it's,

948
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,610
it's,
it actually it's legal to use and it's a

949
00:39:42,611 --> 00:39:44,230
peptide.
Um,

950
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:49,450
it's called body protection compound bpc
one 57,

951
00:39:49,451 --> 00:39:53,110
and the one 57 refers to like the
sequence of amino acids that makes up

952
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:57,730
the actual compound.
But you can buy it and reconstitute it.

953
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,780
And then if you inject it into an area,
and it doesn't even have to be like a

954
00:40:01,781 --> 00:40:05,290
painful intramuscular injection,
it can be like a subcutaneous injection.

955
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,850
BPC supposedly stimulates angiogenesis
and it's an,

956
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:11,920
it's a natural compound.
You find it in the human gut.

957
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,560
So they took this same thing that helps
to heal the human gut,

958
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:17,740
which is why if you were to consume this
and drinking water,

959
00:40:17,741 --> 00:40:20,110
it supposedly,
and this is an in rodent models,

960
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:23,200
it apparently works to like heal up an
inflamed gut,

961
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,520
Colitis,
ibd,

962
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,690
ibs,
stuff like that.

963
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,940
But you can inject it into a joint or
subcutaneously into an area around the

964
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,490
joint.
And it's supposedly stimulates the,

965
00:40:33,491 --> 00:40:35,650
uh,
I feel like this is a repetitive phrase

966
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:37,570
on this show.
The growth of new blood vessels.

967
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,180
So angio,
angiogenesis,

968
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,410
and then there's another one called tb
500 that they use in race horses,

969
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:46,810
the thymus in Beta.
That one is banned by water,

970
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,190
but same similar principle except that
one acts on the actin and myocin fibers

971
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,470
and actually causes regeneration of
those.

972
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:56,440
So you could do both and he get
angiogenesis and then also fiber

973
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:57,160
regrowth.
And that,

974
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,620
that's,
that's a strategy that would be like

975
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:01,810
pennies on the dollar compared to stem
cells.

976
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,891
And also,
you know,

977
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:05,770
a far less,
I'm far less intensive procedure in

978
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:07,510
terms of collecting your stem cells.
Right?

979
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:08,830
Yeah.
And then there's,

980
00:41:08,831 --> 00:41:10,210
um,
so there's,

981
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:12,850
there's a fat for the stem cells and
from what I understand,

982
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:16,060
if you're going after the anti aging
effect,

983
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,750
like the bone is better like the mirror,
like a bone marrow.

984
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,800
So I had mine,
I had my bone marrow extracted at this

985
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:26,770
place called forever labs in Berkeley,
California.

986
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,280
And they store that.
And then what I can do is I can just

987
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:35,310
inject the 35 year old me into my body
every year or every five years or

988
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:38,600
whenever I want to put that back in.
So I've got bone marrow and fat marrow

989
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:42,560
stored.
So they take the bone marrow and how do

990
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:45,480
they have enough to just keep going?
Do they replicate it?

991
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:48,340
I don't know.
The protocol that used to grow this

992
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:49,400
stuff,
like I know the fat one,

993
00:41:49,401 --> 00:41:53,600
they use like a collagenase procedure
that enzymatically breaks down the

994
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:58,070
college and from the fat and somehow
concentrates the stem cells and you can

995
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,260
actually grow them.
Like you can actually multiply them.

996
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:05,290
I'm assuming it's something similar for
bone and the bone would be more for like

997
00:42:05,811 --> 00:42:10,370
longevity and anti aging and in the fat
would be more for for joints.

998
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,310
I know a lot of people got the bone
marrow done for injuries.

999
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,390
Yeah,
yeah,

1000
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,340
yeah.
And it's supposed to be too painful.

1001
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:18,530
Was it painful for you and they
extracted the bone?

1002
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,770
Not compared to the Dick injections.
It's all relative.

1003
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,863
But I,
I'm,

1004
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,700
I've been,
I've been obstacle course racing and

1005
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,650
that was,
I was triathlete before that and did

1006
00:42:27,651 --> 00:42:29,990
body build.
So I've always done all this masochistic

1007
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:31,190
shit.
So getting,

1008
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:32,690
I think my pain tolerance is,
is,

1009
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,820
hi Don.
Uh,

1010
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,720
the,
the bone marrow,

1011
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:36,760
it didn't hurt that much.
No,

1012
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,820
it was that day.
They numb it.

1013
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:39,200
They go in.
Um,

1014
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,150
the Dick one was where there was like
that weird pressure.

1015
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:43,940
A little bit of pain.
I would say that the iodine packing into

1016
00:42:43,941 --> 00:42:45,500
the staph infection that you're talking
about,

1017
00:42:45,501 --> 00:42:46,790
that was,
that was up there.

1018
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,280
Daniel Cormier,
Yang Ufc light heavyweight champion,

1019
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:52,100
had it done with the bone marrow and he
was telling me it was painful as hell

1020
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,170
and he's about as tough name getting
a's.

1021
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:57,290
I checked it again and just hanging out.
So I mean it's,

1022
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,230
it's a big needle.
It was limping around.

1023
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,460
He said for awhile when I did the stem
cell injections,

1024
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:04,220
that was cool cause they used,
they used a digital thermography.

1025
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,660
She can,
it's like an ultrasound.

1026
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,460
It's like what you would use to look at
a baby.

1027
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,750
Yeah.
But you can't,

1028
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:11,310
you can see the tissue,
you can see the areas where there's

1029
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,420
swelling or there's like a black area
where,

1030
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,360
where the tissue is torn up or whether
there's a Dema or inflammation and you

1031
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:18,820
can and,
and um,

1032
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,140
uh,
he showed me the video after he did all

1033
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:23,900
the injections.
You can see the needle like going into

1034
00:43:23,901 --> 00:43:24,590
the,
you can,

1035
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,640
you can micro target exactly.
Exactly where you want to put the cells.

1036
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,301
Yeah,
I've done it.

1037
00:43:29,301 --> 00:43:30,410
Very,
very cool procedure.

1038
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:31,370
Don't want to use that.

1039
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,360
Cool.
Thermography.

1040
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:33,020
Yeah.
Yeah.

1041
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,150
It's a cool procedure.
Have you ever done Regena keen?

1042
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,770
No.
You're aware of it.

1043
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,480
You know what it is.
It's a,

1044
00:43:38,481 --> 00:43:41,390
it's one of the things that a lot of pro
athletes are going to Germany to get

1045
00:43:41,391 --> 00:43:42,260
done.
It's a,

1046
00:43:42,261 --> 00:43:46,610
it's a form of platelet rich plasma
where the heat it up and by heating up

1047
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:47,391
the,
uh,

1048
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,420
the plasma,
it produces this radical

1049
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:53,270
anti-inflammatory property.
It's like they extract it into this

1050
00:43:53,271 --> 00:43:55,490
yellow serum.
They spin it in a centrifuge.

1051
00:43:55,730 --> 00:43:58,190
So if you're going to get it done,
I've had it done on how is that

1052
00:43:58,191 --> 00:44:00,290
different than just normal prp?
More powerful.

1053
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:02,450
More poorly because it's it up.
Yeah.

1054
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,720
Cause some PRP before.
Yeah.

1055
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,670
I have as well.
Yeah.

1056
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,320
It's,
I mean,

1057
00:44:06,321 --> 00:44:07,580
obviously I'm not doctor,
but,

1058
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:10,490
uh,
according to these doctors that do it,

1059
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:13,940
and there's a place in Santa Monica that
does it called lifespan medicine.

1060
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:15,860
I've had it done really for the longest
time.

1061
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:19,040
You had to go to Germany,
like Dana white flew to Germany to get

1062
00:44:19,041 --> 00:44:23,060
it done because it was illegal.
They hadn't,

1063
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,220
yeah,
they had an interest,

1064
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:26,990
but can go on a,
I'm going over to,

1065
00:44:26,991 --> 00:44:27,800
uh,
to,

1066
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,000
uh,
Venice beach.

1067
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:30,980
I'm going to be done by there.
I'm going to these cats.

1068
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,550
The uh,
that place I was talking about the human

1069
00:44:32,551 --> 00:44:34,540
garage.
That's an interesting place.

1070
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:36,360
I really want to talk to the guy who
does it.

1071
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,960
My friend Doctor Ben [inaudible],
he is the guy who performed the

1072
00:44:39,961 --> 00:44:41,160
procedures down there.
He's a great guy.

1073
00:44:41,161 --> 00:44:42,210
He would love to talk to you too.
Yeah,

1074
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,140
sure.
Cool.

1075
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:44,670
You'd get a kick out of it.
It's pretty interesting.

1076
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,620
Some day I'll run out of stuff so you
inject it into joints,

1077
00:44:46,621 --> 00:44:49,350
but for now,
for me it really helped me heal a

1078
00:44:49,351 --> 00:44:50,640
bulging disc in my neck.

1079
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,530
Rarely they go right into the spinal
cord.

1080
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:56,340
It's great for people that have pretty
serious neck injuries and back injuries.

1081
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,530
Have you tried this thing?
I think it's,

1082
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:00,840
it's pet AECON is a company that makes
it,

1083
00:45:00,841 --> 00:45:05,841
but it's like a neck traction device.
I have one hanging him that in a yoga

1084
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,720
trapeze and so all your hands and you're
all hanging by the neck.

1085
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,270
I do this when I get up,
I get up and I put like a bunch of

1086
00:45:12,271 --> 00:45:16,170
magnesium on my neck and my back to
relax all the tissue.

1087
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,090
And once you get really relaxed and have
this,

1088
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:18,840
uh,
this,

1089
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,520
this vibrator,
it's a,

1090
00:45:20,521 --> 00:45:24,480
it's like a car buffer for your body so
you can vibrate your neck and your back

1091
00:45:24,481 --> 00:45:27,900
and then you get really,
really relaxed and it's perfect for,

1092
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:29,730
you know,
for like doing your own deep tissue

1093
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,320
therapy but it,
but it vibrate.

1094
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,750
So I'll do that on my body and I go hang
from this neck thing and you get all of

1095
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,360
these pops up and down in your neck.
And I,

1096
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:39,690
and it apparently realigns the atlas and
the axis and some of the cervical

1097
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:42,570
vertebra and there's probably a bunch of
chiropractic docs who are,

1098
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:43,660
who are,
uh,

1099
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,070
really,
uh,

1100
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:47,940
pissed off right now because I'm
describing this incorrectly.

1101
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:49,290
But it,
it feels amazing.

1102
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:52,350
Like it just adjusts everything.
And then I hang from the yoga trapeze

1103
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,970
and,
but when it definitely seems like five

1104
00:45:53,971 --> 00:45:54,780
minutes.
Yeah,

1105
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,100
definitely.
Decompresses your,

1106
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:57,660
I don't know about all that other
nonsense,

1107
00:45:57,661 --> 00:46:00,300
but it definitely,
it's stretching out those muscles and

1108
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:03,360
alleviating some of the stress that
comes from bad posture.

1109
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:07,650
And for me it was a lot of grappling
getting your neck cranked and squished

1110
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:10,020
and resisting thing.
It's like,

1111
00:46:10,021 --> 00:46:12,940
um,
it's kinda similar to traction and I

1112
00:46:12,941 --> 00:46:14,130
really been getting into that.

1113
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,570
Have you heard of [inaudible]?
E?

1114
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:16,051
L?
D?

1115
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:16,560
O?
H?

1116
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,460
No,
it's like a form of stretching where I

1117
00:46:20,461 --> 00:46:24,210
actually had a guy come to my house for
two days and he stayed in my basement.

1118
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,060
And the way we wake up,
I've done this a few times,

1119
00:46:27,061 --> 00:46:29,670
we'll have people come over to me and
just like teach it.

1120
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:31,830
There's,
there's another guy who mashes it like

1121
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,350
use a walker and just like mash up and
down your body.

1122
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,840
And uh,
but this is El Della,

1123
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:40,470
so l Doa,
you'll like push a joint out this way

1124
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:44,310
and then out this way and then your feet
will be splayed in both directions.

1125
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:46,140
There's like 20 different poses that you
do,

1126
00:46:46,141 --> 00:46:48,630
but it's a form of self traction.
Right.

1127
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:49,890
So it's like,
um,

1128
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,090
it's similar to like if you were to use
a monster band to traction a join,

1129
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:54,810
have you ever done that?

1130
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:57,150
Like traction,
you're hip with a real tie,

1131
00:46:57,151 --> 00:47:02,151
a monster band around your hip and then
attach it to I have not potassium and

1132
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:03,361
joint apart.
Yeah.

1133
00:47:03,361 --> 00:47:07,200
That's all Doa.
Is that Adam from mine pump that is that

1134
00:47:07,201 --> 00:47:09,000
the mind pump that he,
and I think that's my buddy Adam.

1135
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,120
It says spinal health l.
Dot.

1136
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,860
O.
N.

1137
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:13,860
E.
L.

1138
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:13,920
O.
D.

1139
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,870
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

1140
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,440
So that,
that's one of the ones I do in the

1141
00:47:16,441 --> 00:47:18,480
morning.
And that's l five s one so that,

1142
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:21,960
so they all work on a specific,
like part of the back,

1143
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,340
the part of the body,
let me say it again.

1144
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:28,370
Eld [inaudible] l five or l five,
I forget what it stands for.

1145
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:30,890
It was invented by this guy named
[inaudible].

1146
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,770
Yay.
A French guy.

1147
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,540
And uh,
dude,

1148
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,400
you feel amazing.
You,

1149
00:47:35,401 --> 00:47:38,650
you hold these poses for like a minute
and it introduces a bunch of new blood

1150
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:39,340
flow to the joint.

1151
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,150
They see how he's doing that.
He'll like put his hand up and traction

1152
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,820
the Fascia.
And so he's getting this intense poll.

1153
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,220
If you're to do this,
you get this intense poll on your back.

1154
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,470
I do this one cause I get it.
I could show it to you after,

1155
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,060
but you feel amazing.
I do this when I wake up now and uh,

1156
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,740
who knitted this vertical farming
stressing this goes back.

1157
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,510
This is like some,
some French guy invented it and uh,

1158
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,300
I don't remember how I heard about it
but,

1159
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:03,520
or I uh,
uh,

1160
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,510
interview this guy named Jacob Shawn on
my podcast and he taught me all these

1161
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:10,090
moves and getting my house and uh,
it's,

1162
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:12,400
it's another one of those really cool
forms of stretching.

1163
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,540
It's like you do yoga.
I have a,

1164
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:17,680
uh,
of a sauna.

1165
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:19,990
You Do,
you have do like an infrared sauna.

1166
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,420
We have a regular sauna.
I use,

1167
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,081
uh,
like,

1168
00:48:23,081 --> 00:48:25,660
uh,
like a near far infrared sauna.

1169
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,070
And I go in there,
cause you're,

1170
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,130
your tissue gets very pliable and hot.
So I had a,

1171
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,690
I had a crane drop a 19 foot and endless
pool out in the forest back behind my

1172
00:48:34,691 --> 00:48:38,590
house.
And I keep this thing just like super

1173
00:48:38,591 --> 00:48:39,580
duper cold,
right?

1174
00:48:39,581 --> 00:48:41,620
So it's like 45,
50 degrees.

1175
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:45,460
So that's like my,
my cryotherapy cold water immersion.

1176
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:47,980
Well during the,
during the winter and the fall just

1177
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:49,690
stays that cold.
I just keep the lid off.

1178
00:48:49,691 --> 00:48:52,510
And then during the summer when I'm
coming back home and I'm going by the

1179
00:48:52,511 --> 00:48:54,700
gas station up the up the hill before my
house,

1180
00:48:54,701 --> 00:48:56,980
I stopped and I buy ice bags and I just
dumped them in there.

1181
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:59,860
So it's so it stays relatively cold.
And uh,

1182
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:04,110
what I do in the mornings when I'm home,
as I do this sauna and you asked about

1183
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,730
yoga,
I go in there and this is when I do a

1184
00:49:06,731 --> 00:49:07,480
lot of this stuff,
right?

1185
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:10,570
Like I'll do some of my yoga moves,
some of my elders.

1186
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:14,350
There was another really good form of
stretching called core foundation,

1187
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,810
uh,
doc named Eric Goodman.

1188
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,670
And it's like a form of decompression
for the spine.

1189
00:49:19,671 --> 00:49:22,420
And he works with a lot of athletes,
kind of like turns on your glutes

1190
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:24,540
decompresses your spine.
So I,

1191
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:28,840
I just use a mash up of all these little
moves and I'll be in my sauna for like

1192
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:31,180
30 minutes.
So I'm producing all the,

1193
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:34,090
all the heat shock proteins.
I'm getting the nitric oxide,

1194
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:36,730
get in the blood flow and you just feel,
you feel good.

1195
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:40,970
We did a sauna,
so I get all sweaty and I get kind of,

1196
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:44,770
we will sprinkle essential oils in there
and I'll burn like Palo Santo incense

1197
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:47,350
and you know,
put on burn incense inside the song

1198
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:47,921
feeds.
Yeah,

1199
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:49,600
it smells really nice.
And again,

1200
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,070
it's like,
yeah,

1201
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:52,190
like binaural beats.

1202
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,680
So there's this,
this guy named,

1203
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:55,390
um,
Michael Tyrrell,

1204
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,560
and he makes these,
these cds and these tracks that you said

1205
00:49:59,561 --> 00:50:00,630
his name,
you load your vote.

1206
00:50:00,631 --> 00:50:05,380
When Michael Tyrrell retirees,
he's amazing tracks and they're,

1207
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:06,310
uh,
they,

1208
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,400
they vibrate at specific hertz
frequencies right there.

1209
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:11,810
So there's this whole idea that like
your root Chakra,

1210
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:15,610
like your fourth chalky,
your heart shock or vibrates it 528

1211
00:50:15,611 --> 00:50:16,780
hertz.
And there's,

1212
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:19,720
there's different hertz frequencies
associated with different positive

1213
00:50:19,721 --> 00:50:21,540
aspects of,
of euro.

1214
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,391
You know,
it's this,

1215
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:23,500
uh,
it's like,

1216
00:50:23,501 --> 00:50:24,240
uh,
uh,

1217
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,680
a Chakra like oh shit.
I mean,

1218
00:50:26,681 --> 00:50:28,550
have you tried to debunk any of that?
I feel really good.

1219
00:50:28,551 --> 00:50:29,080
I'm trying to,
good.

1220
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,330
If I feel good,
I'm going to try to be deep us to do it.

1221
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:32,090
Yeah.
My notes.

1222
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,040
Are you doing this with headsets on?
No,

1223
00:50:34,041 --> 00:50:36,250
that song it has like surround speakers
and so I just,

1224
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,730
I play that through the speakers.

1225
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,380
No Bluetooth and no Wifi.
Jay May just like,

1226
00:50:40,460 --> 00:50:44,660
it's just like my little shitty little
ipod shuffle that I plug it and play.

1227
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,930
And um,
so I play that while I'm in the sauna

1228
00:50:47,931 --> 00:50:51,950
and I'm doing all my moves and then I
walk out of my house,

1229
00:50:51,951 --> 00:50:54,050
go through my office,
walked through the forest and I go and

1230
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:56,490
jump in the pool and swim in there for
like fights,

1231
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:00,560
like 50 yards.
It's not jumped the other one to the

1232
00:51:00,561 --> 00:51:03,980
other and no,
it's too much to go back and forth.

1233
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,620
Like I've tried to just,
I got to keep things somewhat cause this

1234
00:51:06,621 --> 00:51:09,440
is getting kind of complex between like
the light in the balls and the essential

1235
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:11,510
oils.
Like you gotta you gotta draw the line

1236
00:51:11,511 --> 00:51:14,690
somewhere ourselves.
Sometimes I'll have friends over and,

1237
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,860
and we'll vapor will smoke in the sauna
and then we'll go out to the pool and

1238
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:20,060
then go roll around in the snow.

1239
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,920
They get back in the pool and go back in
the sauna.

1240
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,370
And My,
I do this and my wife is inside making

1241
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:27,460
dinner and we just feel amazing.
I,

1242
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:29,660
we got the hot,
we got the cold and then we'd go in and

1243
00:51:29,661 --> 00:51:31,250
we eat dinner and it's,
it's amazing.

1244
00:51:31,251 --> 00:51:32,660
It's my favorite thing to do with my
friends.

1245
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:35,670
Wow.
But in the morning and do the sauna and

1246
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,060
the ice and then or there or the cold
pool.

1247
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:41,630
And then I finished with a quick dip in
the hot tub out in the trees cause I put

1248
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:45,080
a hot tub next to the cold pool and
everything's like super clean.

1249
00:51:45,081 --> 00:51:47,150
You know,
it's cleaned with ozone and minerals

1250
00:51:47,151 --> 00:51:49,280
instead of chlorine.
And so you just feel really,

1251
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,620
really clean.
And I walk in and start my day.

1252
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,820
I feel like wow.
Blocks.

1253
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,440
So I do yoga.
Yeah.

1254
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,580
But it's in the,
it's in the song.

1255
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,720
Well,
it sounds like you're just stretching,

1256
00:51:56,721 --> 00:51:59,660
you know,
doing like the strengthening I do actual

1257
00:51:59,661 --> 00:52:01,920
like,
well what do you mean like standing

1258
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:06,980
boyer one warrior two or three like like
standing bow pose,

1259
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:11,390
head to knee pose.
I do strenuous doing like old person

1260
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,580
yoga.
I do that legit shit.

1261
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,090
I'm not in a questioning.
I do a headstand.

1262
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,430
I'm just wondering what you're doing
actually in the sauna.

1263
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,130
Yeah,
I'd make it up as I go.

1264
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:23,280
I don't have like,
um,

1265
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,670
I was just based on how you feel while I
was speaking in,

1266
00:52:25,671 --> 00:52:27,290
in code.
That's why I'm down here and speak in

1267
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:30,920
Costa Mesa and a couple of days ago and
there was like this,

1268
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:33,260
this banquet dinner as part of the event
and I'll sit next to this guy.

1269
00:52:33,261 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm like,
well what do you do for your fitness

1270
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:35,834
routine?
Et cetera.

1271
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:39,290
He does Bikram Yoga every day,
but like the Bikram Yoga,

1272
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,920
like all of the poses that are part of
bigger meal because it's a set series of

1273
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:43,700
routines.

1274
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,870
You've done bikram before?
Yeah,

1275
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:48,910
he has like 90 minutes and he does that
every single day at nine days in a row.

1276
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:49,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

1277
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,430
No,
he's been doing it for like years every

1278
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:53,151
day.
I'm impressed.

1279
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:54,980
Cause we did it.
We did sober October,

1280
00:52:54,981 --> 00:52:57,590
we had to do 15 about a month mean a
bunch of my friends.

1281
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,810
Yeah.
I wanted to burn it out.

1282
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:03,620
So the last nine days,
well I had a few days to go but for nine

1283
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:05,300
days I just said let me just get these
out of the way.

1284
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:07,730
And Yeah,
every day I did 90 minutes and it was

1285
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:09,740
like wow.
But it's interesting because you realize

1286
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:14,150
that your body can do that.
I don't like to Overdo it though because

1287
00:53:14,151 --> 00:53:17,350
it's static stretching.
We know that that can decrease forced

1288
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,310
potential.
Like it can decrease power production

1289
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,590
for the calm too pliable,
flexible.

1290
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:26,190
Isn't that the case though?
Preworkout like well the workout,

1291
00:53:26,191 --> 00:53:29,460
but chronically,
if you elongate tissue,

1292
00:53:29,730 --> 00:53:32,430
and I don't know if they've actually
done any studies on people who have done

1293
00:53:32,431 --> 00:53:35,420
yoga for a really long time and compared
like their,

1294
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,710
their vertical jump right before and
after.

1295
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:41,970
But I just feel almost too stretchy if I
get too into it.

1296
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:45,210
Like I feel like when I run it's a
little bit more like gumby running

1297
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:49,390
versus limiting the amount of here.
That's interesting.

1298
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,620
That's definitely,
definitely static stretching prior to

1299
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:55,120
force production is not a good idea.
Right.

1300
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,410
Like prior to things like squats or
something like that.

1301
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,700
It was like when the,
when the lights went out during the

1302
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:01,500
superbowl a few years ago,
you remember that.

1303
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,460
And you could see on TV,
both teams were just like standing on

1304
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:08,520
the sidelines or setting on the silent
doing these long hamstrings,

1305
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:12,570
static stretches and Anne and I wondered
why they were doing it because they were

1306
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:16,440
about to get back in and,
and engage in a very powerful explosive

1307
00:54:16,441 --> 00:54:18,090
sport.
So yeah,

1308
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:19,800
it's,
it's a dynamic stretching.

1309
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,410
Definitely price prior to force
production activities.

1310
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:23,131
Yeah.
Yeah.

1311
00:54:23,131 --> 00:54:25,080
I wonder why they're doing,
maybe they just have really old school

1312
00:54:25,081 --> 00:54:28,340
trainers or something like that are not
aware or maybe they just doing it on our

1313
00:54:28,341 --> 00:54:30,570
own before I do that isometric training.

1314
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,400
Um,
for,

1315
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,120
for power production,
I've got two things.

1316
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,630
I bought this stuff called them those
torque on Amazon.

1317
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,480
You heard this stuff's towards like
smelling salts on steroids.

1318
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:43,210
No,
power lifter told me about it and he

1319
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,670
would sniff it before he'll go like,
you know,

1320
00:54:44,671 --> 00:54:47,510
rip a 700 pound bar off the ground and
you,

1321
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,240
you snort that,
you open up the cap on this stuff and

1322
00:54:51,241 --> 00:54:55,410
it's just like releasing a wild animal
into the room and it released the cap.

1323
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:58,740
It's like smelling salts on steroids and
you smell and you just want to go kill

1324
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:00,230
somebody or find somebody.
Yeah.

1325
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:04,460
It's called nose,
nose torque or knows Turk toward however

1326
00:55:04,461 --> 00:55:06,600
it's something like that.
Like no knows torque.

1327
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,840
Yeah.
Tork Tork yeah,

1328
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,800
there you go.
And so I do that.

1329
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:14,190
And then the other one that I just made
as you can buy this for like pennies on

1330
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,360
the dollar on Amazon.

1331
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:17,010
Yeah.
You can get these essential oil

1332
00:55:17,011 --> 00:55:19,320
inhalers.
So there's some guy just smelled it.

1333
00:55:19,321 --> 00:55:19,980
Here we go.
Yeah.

1334
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,290
Oh he can't even get it near his face.
He's got it.

1335
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:22,651
Yeah.
Oh,

1336
00:55:22,651 --> 00:55:24,530
it's,
it's hard like gift packs of Bud.

1337
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,220
Did he just do it or is he getting ready
to do it?

1338
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:28,530
It's opened it up.
It's like smelling.

1339
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:29,570
So it's ammonia.
So,

1340
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:33,810
uh,
I don't know chemically like I would

1341
00:55:33,811 --> 00:55:37,230
imagine it just put your sympathetic
nervous system into overdrive when you

1342
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:40,170
sniff all that ammonia.
[inaudible] he's been really ginger.

1343
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,320
He's like,
Oh,

1344
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,030
I've got to get some of my friends at
restaurants.

1345
00:55:45,031 --> 00:55:47,630
I carried around some times.
Jesus going into a restaurant.

1346
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:49,230
I have smelt my bouquets.
Actually.

1347
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:50,640
You could smell it.
Go get it.

1348
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,150
Um,
right now you want to,

1349
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,450
you want to sniff it right now?
All right,

1350
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,400
let's do it.
Alright.

1351
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:56,910
Knows torque.
It's out in the car.

1352
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,450
I was in the car.
It's an,

1353
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,230
you know what we'll do,
we'll do it after.

1354
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:01,980
It'd be boring.
Podcasting.

1355
00:56:02,190 --> 00:56:03,710
Plus if people weren't really want to
try it,

1356
00:56:03,711 --> 00:56:05,840
they can just buy it on Amazon.
Um,

1357
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:09,630
the other one is up and excites you and
allows you to,

1358
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,750
so they should be on the field doing
that before they,

1359
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:14,640
uh,
I don't know if I would recommend that.

1360
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,250
You're probably seeing guys like
nosebleeds and heart attacks.

1361
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,210
They,
um,

1362
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:24,940
the other one is a peppermint.
Have you ever used like peppermint oil

1363
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,710
in it?
And they've done studies on this,

1364
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:28,870
on peppermint oil and athletic
performance.

1365
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:30,990
And what I have is this little,
uh,

1366
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:32,990
it,
it looks like a little Tampon or you can

1367
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:35,920
buy these on Amazon.
They're called aroma therapy inhalers

1368
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,700
and it's like this little cotton wick
and you put it,

1369
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:41,830
you put essential oil on the cotton
wick,

1370
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:44,500
right?
So it absorbs into the wic and then you

1371
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,620
put the cap on and you can carry this
around in the gym in your pocket.

1372
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,160
Or I played tennis on Wednesday night,
so I bring it to my tennis matches and

1373
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,500
while I'm playing tennis,
I'll stop sometimes and sniff this

1374
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:55,920
thing.
Kind of say like awake and alert and do

1375
00:56:55,921 --> 00:56:58,150
it like it is just peppermint,
just peppermint.

1376
00:56:58,151 --> 00:56:59,770
But it has this amazing effect.

1377
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:01,650
It's like this wakefulness promoting
effects.

1378
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:03,850
Peppermint.
Peppermint is amazing.

1379
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,620
I put like if you get bloating or gas,
you can smear that around your,

1380
00:57:06,621 --> 00:57:10,690
your stomach and it makes it go away.
It goes one of my favorite oils to use.

1381
00:57:10,691 --> 00:57:12,940
Yeah.
How it gets absorbed through the skin.

1382
00:57:13,170 --> 00:57:13,991
I mean,
you know,

1383
00:57:13,991 --> 00:57:17,680
this is skin is skin is a out,
but a lot of the internal organs,

1384
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:21,640
I don't know if it actually goes into
the actual stomach like in like like

1385
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,040
through the,
through the epithelial lining and into

1386
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,960
the end of the actual intestine.
But like it,

1387
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:29,350
it has an effect for sure.
In terms of what I just started using

1388
00:57:29,351 --> 00:57:34,350
recently is topical cbd,
Topical Cbd and the lack a role on

1389
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,850
almost like a deal on rent roll on kind
of a thing.

1390
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,200
It's amazing.
The CBD,

1391
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:39,490
there's a,
there's one,

1392
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,550
um,
I used this stuff called bio cbd and

1393
00:57:42,551 --> 00:57:47,551
it's Tumeric or curcumin with CVD and
and yeah,

1394
00:57:48,341 --> 00:57:49,000
it's same thing.

1395
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,620
It's like a topical,
they also do a thc like thc roll-ons

1396
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:54,270
yeah,
they do that.

1397
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,330
Another thing,
speaking of the,

1398
00:57:55,331 --> 00:57:58,810
of the sexual performance thing,
you can actually buy like thc,

1399
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,260
sex lube and I mean it's like a high for
your crotch.

1400
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,360
Literally.
You apply it locally and it's like your

1401
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:07,600
crotch gets a high and you can do,
you can do the same thing with these

1402
00:58:07,601 --> 00:58:09,010
little uh,
coconut oil.

1403
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,620
THC suppository,
while they're not suppository,

1404
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:13,510
their demand for swallowing in the
mouth.

1405
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,110
That's a normal route of delivery,
but you can shove them up your butt like

1406
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:21,580
30 or 40 minutes before you have sex and
you actually get like this amazing high

1407
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,280
for your crotch.
I was just like these thc coconut oil

1408
00:58:24,281 --> 00:58:26,350
capsules.
I just find out about that.

1409
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,880
Just
put it up there.

1410
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:34,540
The actual path salts,
not bath salts like the drug,

1411
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:37,300
but the stuff that you put in the bath
now that's thc.

1412
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,030
Really?
Yeah.

1413
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:39,670
They're doing everything out here now.
It's crazy.

1414
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:42,820
They've gotten hogwild because out here
like California,

1415
00:58:43,710 --> 00:58:44,650
Washington,
Washington,

1416
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,790
Washington's liberal.
But I'm the guy that I get my stuff from

1417
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,580
in California.
It just started giving me this stuff to

1418
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:52,810
put in the bath.
Yeah.

1419
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,561
And he just,
he's like,

1420
00:58:53,561 --> 00:58:54,830
you gotta be careful though because
yeah.

1421
00:58:54,970 --> 00:58:58,420
Way Too high in your bag.
I believe it is with skin absorption.

1422
00:58:58,421 --> 00:58:59,430
Yeah.
You're literally like,

1423
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:03,280
just like bathing in it like people bay
than in wine and these fancy spas.

1424
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:05,790
Yeah.
What they bathed in wine.

1425
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:06,940
You have wine bags?
Yeah.

1426
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,010
There's this place I go to in New York
City.

1427
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,650
Uh,
it's called Ra spot,

1428
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,910
a IRA and they had like one of the
options to go there.

1429
00:59:12,911 --> 00:59:16,510
You can just take a bath and one that
sounds so like calligraphy,

1430
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:21,990
the wine and a few versions and some
feed,

1431
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,833
make grades.

1432
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,600
She's taking a drip of this bow is wide.
Oh,

1433
00:59:26,601 --> 00:59:28,310
that's so strange.
It's kind of cheesy though.

1434
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:30,590
She she looks like a news anchor.
Like yeah,

1435
00:59:30,591 --> 00:59:31,341
it does.
Yeah.

1436
00:59:31,341 --> 00:59:32,360
This is like for,
yeah.

1437
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,130
Oh my gosh.
Grapes and there we go.

1438
00:59:34,131 --> 00:59:36,050
I called it the grapes.
You could say yeah,

1439
00:59:36,051 --> 00:59:38,450
that it's actually a cool spa.
I've never done the wine,

1440
00:59:38,451 --> 00:59:39,350
but it sounds,
why,

1441
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,200
I don't know if you'd get drunk from the
wine.

1442
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:44,450
I don't know if it would actually wind
up in your,

1443
00:59:44,451 --> 00:59:46,860
in your set,
but they use antioxidant rich temper neo

1444
00:59:46,861 --> 00:59:49,940
grapes.
Well how could you not get some sort of

1445
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:53,270
absorption?
I'm sure you would get something about

1446
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:56,270
the sensory deprivation tank is that
through the epsom salts,

1447
00:59:56,271 --> 00:59:58,140
your body absorbs a lot of magnesium.
Right?

1448
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:02,580
I like the magnesium chloride,
like using actual magnesium and said,

1449
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,040
and I like that cause you can get it
for,

1450
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,110
I mean that's what they used to melt
ice.

1451
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,670
Like you can just buy this stuff like
rocks hall.

1452
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,790
I know you guys don't melt a lot of ice
in California,

1453
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:13,470
but like in Washington state you can buy
magnesium chloride about like a fricking

1454
01:00:13,471 --> 01:00:16,370
like concrete size bag,
know concrete mixed size bag of it.

1455
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:19,790
And it's the same stuff that they sell
on these expensive websites as like

1456
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:22,700
magnesium salts.
It's just magnesium chloride and you can

1457
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:25,160
dump that into your year,
way more magnesium than you get from

1458
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:27,470
epsom salts.
Well that's really what you want is the

1459
01:00:27,471 --> 01:00:29,980
magnesium.
Like that's displacing the calcium.

1460
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:31,630
That's pretty soon the relaxing effect
that's,

1461
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,091
you know,
it's,

1462
01:00:32,091 --> 01:00:34,520
it's,
maybe I should add that to my tank

1463
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:39,140
magnesium because I've already got
themselves first to make sure it's not

1464
01:00:39,141 --> 01:00:41,810
going to mess up the,
is there like a filtration mechanism on

1465
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:43,760
the 10 yeah,
there's some pretty heavy filtration

1466
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:46,120
system,
but it filters out the epson salts have

1467
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:47,480
an idea for float tanks.

1468
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,920
You know her my idea of course,
because that's where I just get it.

1469
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:55,200
I get really bored and float tanks.
So yeah,

1470
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:57,680
I just said,
and I,

1471
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,740
uh,
no,

1472
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:01,190
that's the mail going to the edibles.
You went out before.

1473
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:03,260
I've only done it three times every time
in Austin,

1474
01:01:03,261 --> 01:01:05,070
Texas.
And it's always been like I've been on a

1475
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,550
wife.
Yeah.

1476
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,020
Charlie with a lot of people do with
ketamine don't die.

1477
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,180
That's the,
um,

1478
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,860
the guy who invented it.
John Lilly's method.

1479
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:17,450
Yeah.
I have an edible that I make at home,

1480
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,490
uh,
with,

1481
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:21,440
with Kratom,
which is an opioid painkiller that's

1482
01:01:21,441 --> 01:01:23,810
freaking amazing.
It induces this euphoria like,

1483
01:01:23,811 --> 01:01:27,350
hi,
and then I add CBD Thc,

1484
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,840
Copaiba Oil,
if you've heard of this.

1485
01:01:29,930 --> 01:01:32,660
No.
Copaiba oil acts on the endocannabinoid

1486
01:01:32,661 --> 01:01:36,650
receptors very similarly to thc and cbd,
but it has what's called like an

1487
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:40,370
entourage effect,
meaning it enhances the effects of CBD

1488
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:40,910
and thc.

1489
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,920
So like if you're,
if you're vaping,

1490
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:46,370
you can add like a couple of drops of
oil over the top of the herbs,

1491
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:49,340
um,
or you can mix it into like an edible

1492
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,500
cakes that you make.
Yeah,

1493
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,370
I saw.
Amazing.

1494
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:55,880
Wow.
My sister accidentally took one last

1495
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,860
week and said she had the best night of
sleep of her life.

1496
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,260
Really?
And uh,

1497
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,630
I don't travel with them cause they just
smell like you just open up a,

1498
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:03,890
a what?
Bass can full of weed.

1499
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,180
So it's,
you know what,

1500
01:02:05,570 --> 01:02:07,590
you don't want those in the bouquets
when you're traveling dogs.

1501
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:08,810
Yeah,
exactly.

1502
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:11,990
Every time I pull line of dogs,
follow me through the airport.

1503
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:14,450
We're like Oj Simpson.
Anyways though,

1504
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:16,130
the um,
the,

1505
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:17,660
the uh,
mix.

1506
01:02:17,661 --> 01:02:21,720
I use coconut oil and g and dark
chocolate and a little bit of Stevia.

1507
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,940
Like I have this butterscotch toffees
Stevia.

1508
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:24,690
It's amazing.

1509
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,400
I travel everywhere.
I put it in sparkling water.

1510
01:02:26,401 --> 01:02:29,070
I put it in coffee.
It's like an organic butter,

1511
01:02:29,071 --> 01:02:31,830
Scotch toffee,
Stevia addicted to it.

1512
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,000
It's a,
it's a company called,

1513
01:02:33,001 --> 01:02:34,350
oh,
Micah organics.

1514
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:36,600
I actually get it.
I get a three pack.

1515
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:39,300
O,
m I c a I get off Amazon is,

1516
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:42,480
was vanilla butterscotch toffee and
plane.

1517
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,580
Like if you just don't want,
if you want to sweeten something but you

1518
01:02:44,581 --> 01:02:46,990
don't want those extra flavors,
best best dba.

1519
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:50,400
So I put all this in the edible and I
have this countertop immersion blender

1520
01:02:50,401 --> 01:02:51,290
called the,
uh,

1521
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:55,250
a magical butter machine.
And you,

1522
01:02:55,251 --> 01:02:58,740
you blend this and it blends on top of
your counter for like eight hours and

1523
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:01,770
all this stuff that makes us together.
And then you pour it into molds and you

1524
01:03:01,771 --> 01:03:03,300
can just put it in the,
in the freezer.

1525
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:06,840
And then I keep it in these like little
Miron glass jars so it doesn't degrade

1526
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,060
and it's just like the best,
best edible.

1527
01:03:09,390 --> 01:03:11,770
So I should try something before float
tanks.

1528
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:14,730
Yeah.
Returned to my float tank idea.

1529
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:18,810
Okay.
So I get these ideas when I'm in the

1530
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:22,620
float tank and I want to,
and usually it's like five or 10 minutes

1531
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:26,030
in.
So I spend the next 50 minutes trying to

1532
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:27,060
remit like,
don't forget this,

1533
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:28,710
don't forget it.
And I try to like these little mnemonic

1534
01:03:28,711 --> 01:03:30,900
techniques where you imagine like,
Eh,

1535
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:31,871
you know,
the,

1536
01:03:31,871 --> 01:03:34,080
the,
like an image of what you remembered is

1537
01:03:34,081 --> 01:03:36,600
waiting for you outside the door as soon
as you opened the float tank.

1538
01:03:36,601 --> 01:03:38,700
So it,
it might work for you to remember and,

1539
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:43,350
but basically it just kind of screws up
my whole ability to be able to just like

1540
01:03:43,351 --> 01:03:47,040
let thoughts come and go and relax.
So my idea is this,

1541
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:51,940
why not have some kind of a recorder
going forward or you thought we made a

1542
01:03:51,941 --> 01:03:53,450
record and you can get those shit?

1543
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,580
I was the first one to the wall.
No,

1544
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:57,070
screw it.
I've been doing,

1545
01:03:57,071 --> 01:03:57,710
okay,
so,

1546
01:03:57,710 --> 01:03:59,550
so like a voice activated recording.
Yeah.

1547
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:01,980
Do you have one like I never did
because,

1548
01:04:02,370 --> 01:04:05,150
and then you walk out and you just get
an MP three play buck.

1549
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,200
Yeah.
Thought of.

1550
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:08,400
I,
I've been trying to figure out what a

1551
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:12,270
good one would be and how to set it up
in there with all the salts and not have

1552
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:15,960
it degrade.
But I think you could figure it out.

1553
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:18,210
I mean my thoughts are,
I thought is a Velcro,

1554
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:22,530
velcro patch.
Slap it in when you go in there and then

1555
01:04:22,531 --> 01:04:24,690
activate it.
You ever see those voice activated ones

1556
01:04:24,691 --> 01:04:26,700
with a red light and seeing voice
activated recorders?

1557
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:27,690
Yeah.
I don't want to break the lie.

1558
01:04:27,691 --> 01:04:29,130
You super easy.
Yeah.

1559
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,500
Well they make these led.
Um,

1560
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:32,590
uh,
you know,

1561
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:33,391
they're,
they're like,

1562
01:04:33,391 --> 01:04:34,081
uh,
you know,

1563
01:04:34,081 --> 01:04:35,580
cause I,
when I travel I don't like to get all

1564
01:04:35,581 --> 01:04:38,190
the blue light and the hotel rooms and
I'll unplug things.

1565
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:39,680
Try to make the hotel room dark.
Right?

1566
01:04:39,681 --> 01:04:41,400
Cause when you flip off the lights in a
hotel room,

1567
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:43,290
it's just like fricking Vegas,
right?

1568
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:47,400
There's blue lights on the TV and stuff
flashing all over the place.

1569
01:04:47,401 --> 01:04:49,250
So they make these,
and I had it for awhile.

1570
01:04:49,290 --> 01:04:51,300
I don't travel with it any more,
but it's like a black tape you can put

1571
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:53,910
over over things that light up in a
room.

1572
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:54,780
You're,
you,

1573
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,360
something like that.
It's like,

1574
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:58,141
uh,
uh,

1575
01:04:58,141 --> 01:04:59,400
you can,
uh,

1576
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:03,090
they're like led light blockers.
It's like tape basically,

1577
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,750
but you just put it over the cover of
anything that lights up.

1578
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,030
You can use something like that on the
digital recorder.

1579
01:05:09,210 --> 01:05:11,250
Wow.
Get to sell this for millions of

1580
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,500
dollars.
Well I think the digital recorded thing

1581
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:15,900
is a really good idea and someone needs
to,

1582
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,010
I need to think,
and I have my idea.

1583
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:18,933
It was not your idea.

1584
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:21,760
I thought at first,
when did you first start doing it all?

1585
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:26,130
I thought it was like two years ago and
they had one of them.

1586
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:28,220
I've had a tank since 2002 early.
Yeah.

1587
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,380
Yeah,
I agree.

1588
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:33,760
I raced an ironman triathlon for eight
years and just got tons of sensory dep

1589
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:36,100
in the water.
Just staring at that black line at the

1590
01:05:36,101 --> 01:05:38,680
bottom of the pool.
It's hard for me to just like get in

1591
01:05:38,681 --> 01:05:41,590
water and relax and not feel like you
have to swim or I just,

1592
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,330
I've never been able to get that
relaxed.

1593
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:44,261
No,
that's interesting.

1594
01:05:44,261 --> 01:05:48,010
So you associate like water with the
movement because associate water with

1595
01:05:48,011 --> 01:05:48,821
swimming.
I like,

1596
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:50,840
I get in water and I won it and I love
water,

1597
01:05:50,841 --> 01:05:51,430
right.
Like I,

1598
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,340
I free dive and I spear fish.
I read this book,

1599
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:56,680
um,
deep by James Nest Door,

1600
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,820
amazing book about all these cool things
that going when you go down deep and he

1601
01:06:00,821 --> 01:06:03,580
talks about how Olympic athletes are
using this now to enhance the

1602
01:06:03,581 --> 01:06:06,430
performance because your spleen
compresses and you produce more

1603
01:06:06,431 --> 01:06:08,410
renewable,
eaten more red blood cells.

1604
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:09,850
Same thing that you produced.
Actually,

1605
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:10,690
if you,
if you sauna,

1606
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,450
like if you do a workout and you get
really hot and then you go in the sauna

1607
01:06:13,451 --> 01:06:16,900
after they've done studies on this and
they found that 30 minutes of heat

1608
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:18,940
therapy after you've already gotten the
body hot,

1609
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,380
you produce hipo the same as if you were
to use the performance enhancing drug.

1610
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:24,610
It's like,
that's interesting because there was a

1611
01:06:24,611 --> 01:06:28,020
statistic just came out about
cryotherapy and this is this echo

1612
01:06:28,021 --> 01:06:31,240
something that Rhonda Patrick was saying
that if you do Cryo,

1613
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:36,540
her advice was you should wait at least
an hour after a workout before you do it

1614
01:06:36,821 --> 01:06:40,210
and allow your body to have some sort of
effect,

1615
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,320
uh,
from,

1616
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,720
from the exercise.
But Sauna,

1617
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,270
they're saying you should do almost
immediately after.

1618
01:06:46,271 --> 01:06:47,650
So the,
the idea with this,

1619
01:06:47,651 --> 01:06:50,710
and there was a brand new study that
just came out like three days ago where

1620
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:55,090
they showed that heat post exercise
enhanced the effects of exercise,

1621
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:58,680
whereas cold blunted the hormetic
response to exercise,

1622
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,530
which makes sense.

1623
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:01,400
It's the same thing side of a window
though.

1624
01:07:01,770 --> 01:07:03,030
It's a window of time.
So,

1625
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:05,320
so the deal is you don't want to blunt
the hermetic response.

1626
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,710
Sexualized high dose antioxidants,
cryotherapy,

1627
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:11,680
cold immersion,
all of that can do this.

1628
01:07:11,681 --> 01:07:15,070
That's a problem with but fighters cause
a lot of fighters are getting into cold

1629
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:19,540
immersion like immediately afterwards.
Exactly what you'd want to wait until

1630
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:22,480
later on in the day.
There's no research on the amount of

1631
01:07:22,481 --> 01:07:25,360
time.
For me what I do it same thing when I do

1632
01:07:25,361 --> 01:07:28,480
like a hard afternoon and work out a way
to couple hours afterwards cause you get

1633
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:33,460
a bigger testosterone and growth hormone
response when you wait after work out to

1634
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:34,870
eat.
I was uh,

1635
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:37,780
actually actually mark Sisson was the
first guy who told me about this and it

1636
01:07:37,781 --> 01:07:40,960
turns out that there actually is a
better hormonal response when you fast

1637
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:41,794
post exercise.

1638
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:46,030
Same thing with antioxidants and there
were a couple of exceptions I can tell

1639
01:07:46,031 --> 01:07:49,450
you about.
Same thing with a cryotherapy,

1640
01:07:49,690 --> 01:07:54,430
not the same time.
If you finish up a hard afternoon or

1641
01:07:54,431 --> 01:07:55,990
especially like an early evening
workout,

1642
01:07:55,991 --> 01:08:00,580
you have a very high body temperature.
So my theory is that a brief dose of

1643
01:08:00,581 --> 01:08:02,050
cold,
like all jump in the cold pool and get

1644
01:08:02,051 --> 01:08:05,110
out and not if not a phone call,
just enough to decrease the core body

1645
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:07,090
temperature,
which is one of the ways that you

1646
01:08:07,091 --> 01:08:10,330
enhanced deep sleep cycles.
So I also sleep on this thing called the

1647
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:14,520
chilly pad that circulates like cold
water underneath my body wirelessly

1648
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,140
start sent me one of those things.
And the cool thing is like your partner

1649
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:21,200
can put their temperature on and I can
put my temperature on and you can,

1650
01:08:21,201 --> 01:08:23,800
you can sleep or whatever temp you want.
So I sleep with this thing as cooking

1651
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:25,340
oil at 55 degrees.

1652
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:25,880
Yeah,
but it's not,

1653
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,020
it's like background noise cause I sleep
with all these binaries and everything.

1654
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:32,330
Anyway.
I use the strict codes called sleep

1655
01:08:32,331 --> 01:08:34,220
stream.
It's like a Dj for sleep.

1656
01:08:34,221 --> 01:08:37,370
So I put my phone in airplane mode and
then I have these,

1657
01:08:37,371 --> 01:08:40,040
these noise blocking headphones.
And if you're a side sleeper,

1658
01:08:40,041 --> 01:08:41,810
you can use these things called sleep
phones,

1659
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:43,880
which is like a headband that goes
around your head.

1660
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:46,820
Um,
anyways though back to the,

1661
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:49,550
to the not doing the cold after
exercise.

1662
01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:52,550
So you wait a little while.
But I think decreasing the body's core

1663
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:55,010
temperature is good.
So like a cold shower,

1664
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,910
cold water immersion also beats out
crowd therapy because yeah,

1665
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:01,370
it's actually more.
And there was a study they did last

1666
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,110
month on this,
that cold water immersion was very

1667
01:09:03,111 --> 01:09:06,680
effective in reducing postworkout muscle
soreness and that inflammatory response

1668
01:09:06,681 --> 01:09:09,260
to exercise compared to cryotherapy.

1669
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,880
But again,
you should wait a little bit before you

1670
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:12,170
do it each way a little bit before you
do it.

1671
01:09:12,171 --> 01:09:15,530
But I think part of that is due to you
get like this hydrostatic pressure of

1672
01:09:15,531 --> 01:09:17,060
water against the skin,
right?

1673
01:09:17,061 --> 01:09:19,940
So it kind of pushes the cold against
the skin a little bit better.

1674
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:22,310
Uh,
and then the other reason is that when

1675
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:24,920
your head gets wet,
when you're head goes under,

1676
01:09:24,950 --> 01:09:26,240
you know,
same thing as you would get with a cold

1677
01:09:26,241 --> 01:09:28,310
shower.
You get like this Mammalian dive reflex,

1678
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:31,880
right?
Like that sharp intake of breath and

1679
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:35,990
that activates your vagus nerve.
So we talked about HRV and heart rate

1680
01:09:35,991 --> 01:09:39,260
variability tracking.
Anytime you do something like that that

1681
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:43,100
improves the tone of the Vegas nerve,
you would actually improve your ability

1682
01:09:43,101 --> 01:09:45,140
to recover and improve the strength of
your,

1683
01:09:45,141 --> 01:09:48,020
of your nervous system.
And they sell like vagal nerve

1684
01:09:48,021 --> 01:09:53,021
stimulators and they've looked into like
chanting humming a singing,

1685
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,790
uh,
jaw,

1686
01:09:56,020 --> 01:09:59,840
they call it jaw realignment therapy
apparently removes the pressure that the

1687
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:02,150
trigeminal nerve can place on the vegas
nerve.

1688
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:05,750
There's all these things you can do to
enhance the health of the vegas nerve

1689
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:09,110
and that's one of the things that
improve your hrv or your heart rate

1690
01:10:09,111 --> 01:10:12,080
variability allows your sympathetic and
your parasympathetic nervous system

1691
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,780
tone.
Like what do you mean by that?

1692
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:16,930
The tone of the nerve?
Uh,

1693
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,500
it would basically be synonymous with
like the,

1694
01:10:19,501 --> 01:10:21,200
the health of the nerve.
I don't know what,

1695
01:10:21,201 --> 01:10:22,400
what's actually,
I don't know if it's,

1696
01:10:22,401 --> 01:10:24,070
if it's changing like the,
uh,

1697
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:24,890
you know,
what,

1698
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,780
what do you call them?
The myelin sheath of the nerve or

1699
01:10:26,781 --> 01:10:27,770
something like that.
When,

1700
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:29,720
when you're increasing the tone of the
nerve,

1701
01:10:29,721 --> 01:10:33,200
but more or less,
it's healthy for the vegas nerve when

1702
01:10:33,201 --> 01:10:35,570
you get,
when you get your head wet or

1703
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:37,520
underwater.
So when I go in my cold pool,

1704
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:40,550
after workout,
I put my head under and then come up

1705
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:43,190
like five or 10 times just to go up and
down and up and down.

1706
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,190
Then I get out and if I'm going to do a
longer cold soak,

1707
01:10:46,220 --> 01:10:48,890
it's not right after a workout.
The,

1708
01:10:48,891 --> 01:10:53,270
um,
the two studies I found on antioxidant

1709
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:55,220
use after workout,
right?

1710
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:57,500
High dose antioxidants like vitamin C,
vitamin E,

1711
01:10:57,501 --> 01:10:59,600
et Cetera,
that's supposedly blunts the hermetic

1712
01:10:59,601 --> 01:11:02,930
response to exercise.
But there was one study that shows that

1713
01:11:02,931 --> 01:11:06,860
green tea polyphenols don't do that.
So green tea would allow you to fight

1714
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:09,890
off the inflammatory effects of exercise
without blunting.

1715
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,530
For example,
satellite cell proliferation or of new

1716
01:11:13,531 --> 01:11:16,380
Mitochondria are all of the things that
you want to happen.

1717
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,190
And the other one was a,
and this is,

1718
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:22,170
this is a new thing,
like not a lot of people are talking

1719
01:11:22,171 --> 01:11:24,570
about this now,
but it's like hydrogen rich compounds.

1720
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,940
Like,
they call it hydrogen rich water.

1721
01:11:26,970 --> 01:11:29,640
And there's these companies now,
there's like four or five of them.

1722
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:33,220
They sell like these tablets that you
can dissolve in water and there's a,

1723
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,060
uh,
the molecular hydrogen foundation,

1724
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:40,050
they do research on,
on this hydrogen and they're not,

1725
01:11:40,051 --> 01:11:42,420
they don't have a financial affiliation
with any of these companies.

1726
01:11:42,421 --> 01:11:46,020
So I respect some of the research that
they do and they've found that it

1727
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:49,980
actually blunts the,
or it allows for antiinflammatory and

1728
01:11:49,981 --> 01:11:53,010
antioxidant effects to shut down,
like the inflammatory response to

1729
01:11:53,011 --> 01:11:55,720
exercise without blunting the hormetic
response.

1730
01:11:55,721 --> 01:11:59,220
So it'd be like green tea and molecular
hydrogen would be the two things that I

1731
01:11:59,221 --> 01:12:04,221
know of that you could do postworkout to
blunt that inflammatory response without

1732
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:05,910
actually,
um,

1733
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:10,170
blunting the hormetic response to
exercise so it'll enhance without

1734
01:12:11,310 --> 01:12:12,360
exactly.
Exactly.

1735
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,520
Have your cake and eat it too.
One of the things that I think that's

1736
01:12:14,521 --> 01:12:17,280
probably really good about cold
immersion therapy also,

1737
01:12:17,281 --> 01:12:21,840
I think there's a meditative aspect of
getting into that incredible cold and

1738
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:23,760
just relaxing and calming.

1739
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,530
And I think it does something for your
mind.

1740
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:28,470
It does.
And it's the nervous system right?

1741
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:30,660
Like what I tell people is you have a
strong,

1742
01:12:30,661 --> 01:12:33,360
and I take my kids out that right.
And I've trained them at a very early

1743
01:12:33,361 --> 01:12:35,760
age to go out there,
the jump in the cold pool,

1744
01:12:35,910 --> 01:12:39,720
but they'll stand in front of the cold
pool and calm their nervous system,

1745
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,970
call them their heart rate.
I'll have them visit like one of them

1746
01:12:41,971 --> 01:12:43,770
visualizes a sea otter,
right?

1747
01:12:43,771 --> 01:12:45,550
And the other one does a polar bear.
So,

1748
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:49,530
so they'll visualize these animals that
are just like impervious to cold,

1749
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,450
right?
And then they get in the water and they

1750
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:53,640
know there's no sharp intake of breath.
There's no

1751
01:12:55,180 --> 01:12:56,940
like,
like people do when they take a cold

1752
01:12:56,941 --> 01:12:59,820
shower a lot of the time.
If you can get your body that point,

1753
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,750
I think that it probably has a pretty,
it's a good indicator that you're

1754
01:13:03,751 --> 01:13:06,030
building that nervous system resilience,
right?

1755
01:13:06,030 --> 01:13:08,520
Like if you can just get in cold and not
freak out.

1756
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:10,500
Right.
So that's what I think people who do

1757
01:13:10,501 --> 01:13:12,810
cold should train themselves to be able
to do.

1758
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:15,000
I've heard that argument about the sauna
as well.

1759
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:19,590
It also builds like a mental toughness
to be able to just sit in there and calm

1760
01:13:19,591 --> 01:13:23,940
yourself and get used to the adverse,
get to the point where you want to bang

1761
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,920
down the door and climb out.
And yeah,

1762
01:13:25,921 --> 01:13:29,040
that's what I like to get myself to in
the song because obviously you get a

1763
01:13:29,041 --> 01:13:32,010
bigger expression of heat shock protein
and more blood flow when you get really

1764
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:33,030
hot.
But yeah,

1765
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:35,310
there's a mental effect too.
Same thing with the water is talking

1766
01:13:35,311 --> 01:13:38,130
about that book,
but the book deep and how I got into

1767
01:13:38,131 --> 01:13:40,310
like free diving and spear fishing.
God,

1768
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,360
Dph,
I think you would love to do it.

1769
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,620
I told you I'm going to go hunt down.
He was telling me that it's like hunting

1770
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:47,630
underwater.
Yeah.

1771
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,260
Um,
uh,

1772
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:50,461
actually,
yeah,

1773
01:13:50,461 --> 01:13:52,560
Aubrey and I,
Auburn and I spear fished in a,

1774
01:13:52,561 --> 01:13:53,910
and Kona,
uh,

1775
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:55,380
last year,
uh,

1776
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,290
he and Whitney and I went down there and
we were just using like the little three

1777
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:01,020
pronged guns.
It wasn't full on like 80 feet deep.

1778
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:03,330
You know,
big ass guns after Mina,

1779
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:06,030
after tuna.
Jesus Christ.

1780
01:14:06,031 --> 01:14:07,410
People go out there like dee,
I've,

1781
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,420
I've never done deal,
I'm not good enough.

1782
01:14:09,421 --> 01:14:12,390
Like I'm under water.
I attached to a tune a high,

1783
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:16,660
well what you do is you have a real and
real is attached to a float,

1784
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:19,450
right?
And so after you shoe and you spiro big

1785
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:21,430
fish like a tuna,
it's not dragging you.

1786
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:24,610
It's dragging the float.
So all you have to do is wait for that

1787
01:14:24,611 --> 01:14:27,010
float to pop back up wherever it's going
to pop up.

1788
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,780
And that's how,
but I haven't done that.

1789
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:31,030
But that's like on my bucket list.
Big Time.

1790
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:34,480
I'm going back to Kona,
I'm going back to Kona in April and

1791
01:14:34,481 --> 01:14:36,430
that's going to be more shallow water,
spear fishing.

1792
01:14:36,431 --> 01:14:38,680
And we're going to hunt for a scrub
cattle.

1793
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:40,810
Sheep go,
you know the pig there was amazing.

1794
01:14:40,830 --> 01:14:42,650
They have a scrub cat.
Yeah.

1795
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:46,960
And the pig feet on like macadamia nuts
and avocado and explaining the old scrub

1796
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:49,600
catalyst and scrub calendar this.
But apparently it tastes amazing.

1797
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,110
What's Grub Bulls are,
they're essentially domestic cattle that

1798
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:56,470
have gone feral.
So some time in the past,

1799
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,600
whether it's 10,
20 generations back,

1800
01:14:58,601 --> 01:15:00,760
whatever it was,
they busted through some fences and now

1801
01:15:00,761 --> 01:15:02,500
they're wild.
And uh,

1802
01:15:02,501 --> 01:15:06,370
in Australia they hunt and they are very
dangerous.

1803
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:09,310
Apparently they are the most aggressive
bowls bringing on,

1804
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:13,480
I can't wait gotta be real careful.
Adam Green trees buddies got gored real

1805
01:15:13,481 --> 01:15:16,240
bad and you had to be medivaced out of
there.

1806
01:15:16,270 --> 01:15:19,630
He was in the the northern country.
I'm just going to play a Shitload of

1807
01:15:19,631 --> 01:15:21,970
techno hunt.
So,

1808
01:15:22,330 --> 01:15:23,380
so,
so the book,

1809
01:15:23,410 --> 01:15:26,730
I read this book by James Nest Door and
in,

1810
01:15:26,780 --> 01:15:28,270
I had him on my podcast and I'm like
dude,

1811
01:15:28,271 --> 01:15:29,380
I want to learn how to do this.
I want,

1812
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:32,620
I want to learn how to like compress the
spleen and go under and learn how to

1813
01:15:32,621 --> 01:15:35,400
hold my breath and get all these nervous
system benefits,

1814
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,110
spleen.
The spleen just gets compelling.

1815
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,520
I'll learn how to get deep enough cause
I couldn't even as an Ironman

1816
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,210
triathlete,
I couldn't go deeper than 15 feet

1817
01:15:43,211 --> 01:15:44,720
without freaking out.
Cause like my,

1818
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:46,690
my ears,
we'd get the pressure in them and I

1819
01:15:46,691 --> 01:15:48,070
could do the,
what do you call it,

1820
01:15:48,100 --> 01:15:49,030
the,
um,

1821
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:52,870
when you equalize,
not the Frenzel technique but the,

1822
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,530
it's the,
uh,

1823
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:54,010
you know,
when you,

1824
01:15:54,010 --> 01:15:55,210
when you go,
yeah,

1825
01:15:55,630 --> 01:15:57,190
I'm forgetting the name of pop your
ears,

1826
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:01,090
pop your ears technique that most people
do when they get into the water.

1827
01:16:01,091 --> 01:16:04,180
But there's another technique called the
Frenzel technique where you'll,

1828
01:16:04,450 --> 01:16:06,190
you'll pull the,
it's like,

1829
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:09,310
and you,
so you're doing it just to see like your

1830
01:16:09,311 --> 01:16:12,400
dose by dose goes out like that.

1831
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,590
You do that,
you can equalize it like 20 feet,

1832
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:19,120
30 feet,
40 feet.

1833
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,610
So I said,
who can I go learn from?

1834
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:21,911
He,
he's like,

1835
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,780
you gotta go see this cat down in Fort
Lauderdale named Ted Hardcore.

1836
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,530
It's Florida and got to go back to
Florida.

1837
01:16:26,531 --> 01:16:30,460
Everything absolutely explains Dick
shocks to the stem cells.

1838
01:16:30,730 --> 01:16:32,170
Got to learn how to do the splitting
thing.

1839
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:33,700
So I go to,
fortunately,

1840
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:35,320
my grandmother lives in Florida,
so I,

1841
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:38,920
I have a place to stay when I go there.
So there's that at least.

1842
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,860
Uh,
and I take this free diving course and

1843
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:46,270
he gets me from holding my breath for
about a minute and 45 seconds.

1844
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:49,510
He got me up to four 45,
four magnum breath for five seconds.

1845
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:54,010
It took me from 15 fee over five days
down to 80 feet where you're like trout,

1846
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,970
you,
you actually,

1847
01:16:54,971 --> 01:16:59,430
they put a rope in the water and you go
vertical and you have like your bit,

1848
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,500
you know the big thins,
like you have the big fins and you have

1849
01:17:02,530 --> 01:17:05,020
Hamas that,
I've seen those on people,

1850
01:17:05,050 --> 01:17:07,750
but they're,
they're like path as long as that flag,

1851
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:08,380
what's that like?

1852
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,740
Like three,
four feet.

1853
01:17:09,741 --> 01:17:10,191
But that,
yeah,

1854
01:17:10,191 --> 01:17:11,840
they're like these big carbon fans.
And I said,

1855
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:13,640
dude,
just tell me all of the best things to

1856
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:15,570
buy.
And I contacted the editor of carbon,

1857
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:18,920
so they're stiff and their car when
they're stiff and you just swim soul

1858
01:17:18,921 --> 01:17:21,770
fast in them.
And I contacted the editor of spearing

1859
01:17:21,771 --> 01:17:23,810
magazine and asking me what's the best
gun to buy,

1860
01:17:23,811 --> 01:17:24,670
what are the best fans?
But,

1861
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:26,960
so I,
I got outfitted with all this stuff and

1862
01:17:26,961 --> 01:17:29,660
then I went down there,
learn how to hold my breath,

1863
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:34,670
learn how to equalize.
And now when I spear fish and I still,

1864
01:17:34,671 --> 01:17:35,840
again,
I haven't got to the point where I've

1865
01:17:35,841 --> 01:17:37,640
gone,
like I go after the group or,

1866
01:17:37,850 --> 01:17:40,100
and the parrot fish and like the,
the little ones,

1867
01:17:40,101 --> 01:17:41,690
I haven't gotten to the point now where
I'm hunting.

1868
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:46,691
The big fish is very similar to,
I know the very first time I went after

1869
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:49,190
my,
I got two at once to groupers at once

1870
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,110
and apparently it wasn't group per
season,

1871
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:53,300
so they had me put him,
put him back.

1872
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:56,550
It's not as big of a deal is like if you
shoot an elk and you know,

1873
01:17:56,551 --> 01:17:57,384
I'm a tag,
I mean like,

1874
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,130
but,
but yet they have a group person.

1875
01:17:59,210 --> 01:18:01,190
I mean not put them back.
I didn't like take them down to their

1876
01:18:01,191 --> 01:18:03,790
little group or nest and them away.
But they're dead.

1877
01:18:03,791 --> 01:18:04,980
So you can,
yeah,

1878
01:18:04,990 --> 01:18:05,760
you just leap.
Yeah.

1879
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,280
You just lead them.
That seems ridiculous.

1880
01:18:07,281 --> 01:18:09,590
Well,
I mean it just didn't want to get fine.

1881
01:18:09,591 --> 01:18:10,940
They didn't want to get in trouble.
All right,

1882
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:12,670
so,
so anyways,

1883
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,960
the spearfishing,
amazing.

1884
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:16,670
And this whole like free diving,
you know,

1885
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:18,350
we,
we got on this topic from the float

1886
01:18:18,351 --> 01:18:20,060
tanks,
similar experience.

1887
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,130
Like you're just at peace under the
water.

1888
01:18:22,460 --> 01:18:24,230
You're not wearing all the scuba
equipment.

1889
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:28,130
So fish swim up to you and you can kind
of like lay on the bottom of the water

1890
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:30,070
and you know,
shoot something as it comes.

1891
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:33,170
I go with my kids and they like sit on
the shore with like buckets and and

1892
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,580
dives and you know,
they'll help,

1893
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,590
help bring the fish and then we'd take
it back.

1894
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:39,590
And you have like fish cook offs and
it's amazing.

1895
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:43,310
He's very similar to but very similar
field of bow hunting except it's like

1896
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:47,930
that peaceful setting in the water.
It's probably intensely physical while

1897
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,560
it's a great workout cause you're not on
there,

1898
01:18:49,570 --> 01:18:51,080
you're cold.
So you're getting all the benefits of

1899
01:18:51,081 --> 01:18:52,340
cold thermogenesis,
you know,

1900
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:55,730
like the white adipose to Brown fat
conversion and the,

1901
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:58,010
and the shivering and the,
and the calorie burning.

1902
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:01,250
And you know that angiogenesis and all
the stuff you get from cold.

1903
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,140
But then you're also,
you're freaking hunting,

1904
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:05,780
right?
We're not sitting on the edge like with

1905
01:19:05,781 --> 01:19:07,640
a,
with a fishing pole over a boat,

1906
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:09,230
which I find intensely boring.

1907
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,790
You're actually in there and you're
doing all while you're holding with the

1908
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,490
fish,
doing it all while you're holding your

1909
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:16,010
breath.
Now Scuba equipment and people will do

1910
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:17,680
like,
like I do breath hold walks.

1911
01:19:17,980 --> 01:19:19,820
All right,
well go on a walk and every time I pass

1912
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,040
a telephone pole,
I'll just like take a breath and I'll

1913
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:23,760
hold my breath as long as possible in a
pasta.

1914
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:26,810
Tell it when I passed the telephone pole
and they'll breathe through my nose to

1915
01:19:26,811 --> 01:19:28,160
recover.
And then when I get to the next

1916
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:29,690
telephone pole,
I'll hold my breath.

1917
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:33,260
Probably gonna die some day like next to
a bus stop.

1918
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:36,890
Like a car blue in the face.
But yeah,

1919
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:38,180
spear fit.
Like you'd like it.

1920
01:19:38,270 --> 01:19:39,410
I'm sure.
I would think you'd dig it.

1921
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,420
Yeah.
It seems like an interesting mental

1922
01:19:41,421 --> 01:19:44,050
exercise table because you have to keep
your shit together while you're at the

1923
01:19:44,051 --> 01:19:45,710
water and you're wanting to take a
breath.

1924
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:47,120
You do.
And people die.

1925
01:19:47,121 --> 01:19:49,520
People do shallow water blackout and
this is what I learned.

1926
01:19:49,640 --> 01:19:52,310
That's why I,
this guy sent me down to Fort Lauderdale

1927
01:19:52,311 --> 01:19:54,410
because this guy,
he teaches safety,

1928
01:19:54,411 --> 01:19:56,330
right?
You don't do like the Wim Hoff breathing

1929
01:19:56,331 --> 01:19:59,360
and blow off all the carbon dioxide so
you can hold your breath longer,

1930
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,490
which is great for holding your breath
longer.

1931
01:20:01,491 --> 01:20:04,490
But carbon dioxide is your body's signal
to take a breath.

1932
01:20:04,850 --> 01:20:06,230
If you're real,
all of your carbon dioxide,

1933
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:09,280
then here,
so you have to have walk out.

1934
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,840
So for example,
you're floating on the water before

1935
01:20:12,841 --> 01:20:15,450
you're going to take a dive down.
She kind of like watching the water,

1936
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:20,630
you're watching the fish and you might
do like a two count breath in to count

1937
01:20:20,671 --> 01:20:24,180
hold and then 10 count breath out to
count hold.

1938
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:26,190
And you're just like getting the heart
rate down.

1939
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:28,740
You're getting the nervous system calm.

1940
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:32,580
You're not even supposed to do like a
lot of caffeine which jacks up the

1941
01:20:32,650 --> 01:20:35,130
[inaudible] system and cause you to not
be able to hold your breath as long

1942
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:37,920
dairy makes the mucus more thick and so
you,

1943
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,540
you can't hold your breath as long as
you do a of dairy.

1944
01:20:39,541 --> 01:20:41,850
So you don't do a lot of dairy,
you don't do a lot of caffeine and then

1945
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:43,650
you just dive down.
And I did,

1946
01:20:43,651 --> 01:20:46,140
uh,
I brought ketones down because a lot of

1947
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:48,890
like a dominique d'agostino has,
has,

1948
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,450
you know,
he's done research on like a divers and

1949
01:20:51,451 --> 01:20:55,530
reducing a lot of the effects of like
reduced a reduced flow of oxygen to the

1950
01:20:55,531 --> 01:20:58,920
brain that apparently these,
these navy seal divers get and he does

1951
01:20:58,921 --> 01:21:02,010
research on,
on the use of Ketosis and ketones.

1952
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:03,600
And one of the days that we were out
there,

1953
01:21:03,601 --> 01:21:07,470
I actually took a key tones and the
increased my breath hold time just using

1954
01:21:07,471 --> 01:21:09,450
like these,
these exogenous ketones.

1955
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:11,460
So apparently they have an effect as
well.

1956
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,590
I don't know if it's because the brain
is using more,

1957
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:17,130
more of the ketones and the glucose,
but they increase breath hold time that,

1958
01:21:17,131 --> 01:21:17,650
yeah,
they,

1959
01:21:17,650 --> 01:21:19,620
they came up with that for rebreathers.
Right.

1960
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:22,950
Like that's when they started getting
people maybe seal divers when they're

1961
01:21:22,980 --> 01:21:25,700
using rebreathers apparently in a
certain percentage of them are

1962
01:21:25,701 --> 01:21:27,250
susceptible to seizures.
Yeah.

1963
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:30,420
And they use a,
well two things,

1964
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:31,650
you know,
ketosis and,

1965
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,110
and cbd are two things that are used for
the,

1966
01:21:34,111 --> 01:21:36,280
for like epilepsy and seizures.
Yeah.

1967
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,520
Yeah.
Ketosis supposedly has an amazing effect

1968
01:21:38,521 --> 01:21:40,900
with kids,
kids and did a seizures.

1969
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:45,950
I did 12 months of like strict Ketosis,
a four study for a lab study in Florida.

1970
01:21:48,390 --> 01:21:49,000
No,
I'm just kidding.

1971
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,000
That's a university of Connecticut.
This guy named um,

1972
01:21:54,970 --> 01:21:56,070
uh,
Jeff Volak.

1973
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:00,720
He does a lot of like ketone research
and he had one group of athletes follow

1974
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:05,640
just a normal and Darren's athlete Diet
for 12 months and another group follow

1975
01:22:05,641 --> 01:22:10,230
like a high fat low carb Ketogenic Diet
for 12 months because he wanted to see

1976
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:15,180
if you would maintain your glycogen
levels and if you would,

1977
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:17,400
uh,
if your performance would be synonymous

1978
01:22:17,401 --> 01:22:19,320
to the group that did not eat the high
fat,

1979
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:22,050
low carb Diet,
what would happen to inflammatory

1980
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:22,560
markers?

1981
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,090
What would happen to the gut microbiome?
So,

1982
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,930
but he wanted like a lot of these
studies on high fat,

1983
01:22:27,931 --> 01:22:30,900
low carb diets.
They'll follow people for like two weeks

1984
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:32,700
or three days and have meat like high
fat,

1985
01:22:32,701 --> 01:22:36,630
low carb and then see what happens when
they go jam on a bike for 30 minutes or

1986
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:38,660
exercise.
But they want to do like a longterm

1987
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:43,670
study to see if the body can adapt to
burning fats as a fuel with long term

1988
01:22:44,310 --> 01:22:48,090
utilization of a high fat diet,
which I don't do any more by the way.

1989
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:48,950
I,
I like,

1990
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:50,790
I save all my carbohydrates for the
evening.

1991
01:22:50,830 --> 01:22:52,470
Then I eat a bunch of carbohydrates in
the evening.

1992
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:54,450
What kind of carbs you eat?
Oh,

1993
01:22:54,451 --> 01:22:56,960
like a red wine.
Dark chocolate too.

1994
01:22:56,961 --> 01:22:58,170
Or starches,
yams,

1995
01:22:58,171 --> 01:22:59,070
sweet potatoes.
You my,

1996
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,470
my wife's a cook,
so she does like this amazing like slow

1997
01:23:01,471 --> 01:23:04,930
fermented sourdough bread,
which pre digest all the gluten and the

1998
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:05,200
doors.

1999
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:09,490
The glycaemic index,
like pretty much keen wa Amaranth,

2000
01:23:09,491 --> 01:23:11,320
millet.
I don't follow a specific diet in terms

2001
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:15,280
of like restricting certain food groups.
My philosophy is you just make them

2002
01:23:15,281 --> 01:23:19,780
digestible,
eating carbs at night that it's good

2003
01:23:19,781 --> 01:23:23,440
thing to relax you as well.
Technically you're more insulin

2004
01:23:23,441 --> 01:23:28,441
sensitive in the morning,
but you can make yourself more insulin

2005
01:23:28,841 --> 01:23:33,010
sensitive in the evening and the
advantage of that is if you consume a

2006
01:23:33,011 --> 01:23:35,110
bunch of your carbohydrates in the
morning when you're in an insulin

2007
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:37,540
sensitive state,
what are you going to rely upon as your

2008
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:41,110
primary fuel during the rest of the day?
Karma hydrates,

2009
01:23:41,111 --> 01:23:42,580
right?
Instead of teaching your body how to be

2010
01:23:42,581 --> 01:23:45,430
a fat burning machine and tap into fats
and generate ketones.

2011
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,150
So you save your carbohydrate intake for
the end of the day.

2012
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:52,690
But I also saved my hard workout for the
end of the day,

2013
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:56,170
which is when your body temperature
peaks and your grip strength peaks and

2014
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:57,440
uh,
you,

2015
01:23:57,460 --> 01:23:58,271
you,
you,

2016
01:23:58,271 --> 01:23:59,770
you can do a hard workout.

2017
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,410
And anybody who's rolls out of bed and
tried to do a crossfit wad versus doing

2018
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:02,810
it,
you know,

2019
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:05,530
the 5:00 PM the afternoon knows this.
Like you can do it pretty good hard

2020
01:24:05,531 --> 01:24:08,110
workout like in the later afternoon or
the evening when you're warmed up.

2021
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:12,160
But that also upregulates insulin
sensitivity and the activity of these

2022
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:16,180
glute four transporters that can shove
glucose in the muscle tissue for

2023
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:18,880
example.
And so then you can have your cake and

2024
01:24:18,881 --> 01:24:19,590
eat it too,
right?

2025
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:22,090
You,
you create your own insulin sensitive

2026
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:25,500
state and then you go off and,
and typically I'll finish that workout

2027
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:27,190
around like six,
six 30 right?

2028
01:24:27,191 --> 01:24:29,710
And like I mentioned,
I don't eat dinner for a couple hours

2029
01:24:29,711 --> 01:24:34,060
after the workout is like a eight 30 we
sit down to a family dinner and I'll

2030
01:24:34,061 --> 01:24:37,120
just use as many carbohydrates as I want
because I'm in an insulin sensitive

2031
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:40,060
state by the next morning and I tested
this for a while.

2032
01:24:40,060 --> 01:24:42,340
I did like the blood ketone and the
breath ketone testing.

2033
01:24:42,341 --> 01:24:45,370
I'm back in a fat burning state by the
next morning,

2034
01:24:45,550 --> 01:24:49,720
but also with the bread,
I've also replenish my glycogen stores

2035
01:24:49,721 --> 01:24:53,650
and my liver and my muscle to be able to
do the next days.

2036
01:24:53,770 --> 01:24:54,910
Hard workout.
Right?

2037
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:58,240
So I like this strategy for athletes
because they can get all the benefits of

2038
01:24:58,241 --> 01:25:00,850
a fat burning state.
The reduced free radical production from

2039
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:04,530
excess glucose intake,
the reduced young glycaemic variability,

2040
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,360
which is honestly a,
it's a,

2041
01:25:06,390 --> 01:25:09,010
it's a pretty big marker for in my
opinion,

2042
01:25:09,011 --> 01:25:12,940
like like your risk factor for a host of
chronic diseases like spiking your blood

2043
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:16,060
glucose multiple times during the day.
So instead you just don't eat

2044
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:18,700
carbohydrates all day,
do a hard workout at the end of the day

2045
01:25:18,790 --> 01:25:21,790
and then have your carbohydrates to
replenish all your energy levels.

2046
01:25:21,791 --> 01:25:24,700
Then you go into the next day.
And then what's your primary food source

2047
01:25:24,701 --> 01:25:25,120
during the day?

2048
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,150
Like what do you do?
You have like standards so you,

2049
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:30,880
we,
we have a lot of like really good wild

2050
01:25:30,881 --> 01:25:32,470
plants that grow up in the,
on our land.

2051
01:25:32,471 --> 01:25:34,870
So I have 10 acres up there in
Washington state and we've got like

2052
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:38,020
wild,
not all and meant and plantation and

2053
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:41,230
Oregon grape root and comfrey and all
these amazing plants.

2054
01:25:41,231 --> 01:25:46,020
So we also have eight raised garden beds
where we grow Kale and Bok Choy,

2055
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:48,620
Swiss chard.
And so raise them so that they don't

2056
01:25:48,621 --> 01:25:50,620
learn.
They're not as obsessed stubble to

2057
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:53,680
ground frost or like when you raise a
garden bed,

2058
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:57,330
you can just add whatever type of soil
that you want versus digging down,

2059
01:25:57,340 --> 01:26:00,220
cause my wife does a lot of composting
because we have chickens and goats.

2060
01:26:00,221 --> 01:26:02,980
So she used a lot of the,
a lot of the dung from the chickens and

2061
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,790
the goats.
And the leftover food from inside and

2062
01:26:04,791 --> 01:26:05,780
does composting.

2063
01:26:05,780 --> 01:26:08,450
And so we use a lot of this and the
raised garden beds.

2064
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,400
Nice.
I started gardening this year.

2065
01:26:10,430 --> 01:26:12,650
Indoors,
I'm growing something called spilanthes,

2066
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:14,210
which I can tell you about later.
It's amazing.

2067
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:17,000
I found an inquiry.
But the um,

2068
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,970
the what I do during the day and eat a
lot of wild plants,

2069
01:26:20,030 --> 01:26:20,481
right?
So,

2070
01:26:20,481 --> 01:26:23,360
so I'll come in when I'm coming in from
like that cold pool in the morning.

2071
01:26:23,361 --> 01:26:27,050
I like gathering some plants and I throw
those in a blender with like some,

2072
01:26:27,051 --> 01:26:29,750
some fats like coconut milk or coconut
oil,

2073
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:30,831
uh,
all the,

2074
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:35,450
like some bone broth and some lemon
because when you mix the vitamin C with

2075
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:38,030
college and you make the college and a
lot more absorbable.

2076
01:26:38,270 --> 01:26:40,250
So I'll mix the vitamin C with bone
broth.

2077
01:26:40,251 --> 01:26:43,230
I'll put that into the blender.
A whole bunch of superfoods.

2078
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,890
Don't blend it for like two minutes.
Cause if you blend it for a long time,

2079
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,960
it gets like a texture,
like a Wendy's frosty.

2080
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,030
So it's like,
and you can like eat it with,

2081
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:50,541
with,
you know,

2082
01:26:50,541 --> 01:26:52,720
one of those long you've had a wendy's
frosty for,

2083
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:53,390
right?
Yeah.

2084
01:26:53,390 --> 01:26:55,340
You look confused when I said Wendy's
fries.

2085
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:58,480
Strange.
What kind of horrible life you led.

2086
01:26:58,481 --> 01:27:01,490
What did your parents do to you?
You never had a wendy's frosty,

2087
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,530
so,
so it gets like this Wendy's frosty like

2088
01:27:03,531 --> 01:27:05,810
consistency.
It's just a bunch of wild plants and

2089
01:27:05,811 --> 01:27:08,210
fats.
And I put like that Stevia in there.

2090
01:27:08,450 --> 01:27:10,500
I put a little bit of mccowen there.
Uh,

2091
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:12,380
sometimes we'll do like a little bit of
whey protein,

2092
01:27:12,381 --> 01:27:15,290
like a good like grass fed whey or some
kind of protein source.

2093
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:20,800
And then I put like a crunchy things and
so I put it all in a bowl with a spatula

2094
01:27:22,100 --> 01:27:23,090
crunchy.
Yeah.

2095
01:27:23,091 --> 01:27:26,200
Like coconut flakes and could count
hibbs and uh,

2096
01:27:26,270 --> 01:27:29,660
like I use like these little spiralina
and chlorella tablets.

2097
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:34,280
And so it's like eating a,
it's like when you go to a yogurt store

2098
01:27:34,281 --> 01:27:36,440
and you get the yogurt and you get the
toppings on top of it,

2099
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:40,130
but it's like this amazing Kenogenic
superfood rich meal.

2100
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:43,790
And by blending it all together and
blending the fats with all the,

2101
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:45,830
all the ingredients,
you're actually enhancing the

2102
01:27:45,831 --> 01:27:47,540
absorption.
And so,

2103
01:27:47,541 --> 01:27:50,060
so that's what I have for breakfast.
You should open a cafe.

2104
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,270
So that sounds good.
Well I'm trying to like,

2105
01:27:53,271 --> 01:27:55,330
I'm trying to make it into like a,
uh,

2106
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:58,460
like a drinkable,
a drinkable form.

2107
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,330
Something that is the same thing that
um,

2108
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,060
yeah,
I'm going over to see,

2109
01:28:02,061 --> 01:28:02,840
uh,
uh,

2110
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:06,290
Rick Ruben after this over in Malibu and
he does the same thing for breakfast.

2111
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:09,350
And that's actually one of the things
we're talking about how we can make this

2112
01:28:09,351 --> 01:28:10,910
no so random.
Like we,

2113
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:14,120
we go sauna together over there in
Malibu and we were,

2114
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:17,300
uh,
we both do the same thing.

2115
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:18,051
Like his,
his,

2116
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:19,740
his,
his is a little bit different.

2117
01:28:19,741 --> 01:28:22,640
Like he put some different things in it
at the same thing and it's an amazing

2118
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:25,910
breakfast cause you can sit there and
like I do a lot of dictation on my

2119
01:28:25,911 --> 01:28:27,770
computer,
so I'll sit there and I'll dictate

2120
01:28:27,771 --> 01:28:29,260
emails.
But while I'm eating my,

2121
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:31,460
my smoothie with a spoon,
it's amazing.

2122
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,700
And then I do a salad for breakfast or
for lunch,

2123
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:35,990
a big ass salad.
Again,

2124
01:28:35,991 --> 01:28:39,170
whole bunch of wild plants and I'll put
like sardines,

2125
01:28:39,171 --> 01:28:40,280
seeds,
nuts,

2126
01:28:40,310 --> 01:28:40,611
you know,
just,

2127
01:28:40,611 --> 01:28:42,380
just good,
good fats on them.

2128
01:28:42,950 --> 01:28:44,070
And,
uh,

2129
01:28:44,180 --> 01:28:46,550
then I have like these Nori wraps,
right,

2130
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:48,740
which is like a seaweed wrap.
You're really good in iodine.

2131
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:51,260
Really nutrient dense.
And I'm gonna use miracle noodles.

2132
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:53,020
Have you had miracle noodles?
No.

2133
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,580
So they're made out of Japanese Yam,
they called them.

2134
01:28:55,581 --> 01:28:56,570
Sure.
Talky noodles.

2135
01:28:57,260 --> 01:28:59,870
It's in my kids make pad Thai out of
this and they have like a cooking

2136
01:28:59,871 --> 01:29:02,490
podcast where they do all these crazy
crazy meals.

2137
01:29:02,730 --> 01:29:04,950
And one of the things they use a lot of
are these shirataki noodles.

2138
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:09,510
So I make these Japanese Yam and it was,
I put him on top of the salad and then I

2139
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,490
roll that up and like a noi,
Burrito wrap.

2140
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:14,880
And I eat that like a Burrito for lunch.
And then dinner,

2141
01:29:14,881 --> 01:29:15,810
like I mentioned,
it's just,

2142
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,910
you know,
whatever my wife happens because dinner

2143
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:19,080
is Mike,
my free mail.

2144
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:20,610
Right.
It's just whatever I want to have.

2145
01:29:20,611 --> 01:29:24,330
But for this study for Jeff Volek Slab
is 12 months strict ketosis and they

2146
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:26,190
brought us into the lab.
Uh,

2147
01:29:26,191 --> 01:29:28,770
they had me in the,
in the group of Kenogenic athletes and

2148
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:31,230
also the whole group of,
of endurance athletes following a

2149
01:29:31,231 --> 01:29:34,080
traditional carbohydrate rich diet,
uh,

2150
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,780
do a vo two Max test the night that we
got there.

2151
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:39,900
And then the next morning they punched a
bunch of holes and our thighs with

2152
01:29:39,901 --> 01:29:43,500
needles and did a biopsy of the muscle
to see how much glycogen was in the

2153
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,334
muscle.

2154
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,040
And then with these big holes in our,
in our muscles,

2155
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,960
we had to go run on a treadmill for
three hours.

2156
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:53,240
So I ran 22 miles on the,
on the whole like look up,

2157
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:54,720
like wanting to see how much do they
want to see,

2158
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:56,910
how much glycogen they pull.
It's like a muscle biopsy.

2159
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:58,920
It's like a little bleak Ghia team.
That's a big deal,

2160
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:02,790
especially when you go pound on the
treadmill after you've had these,

2161
01:30:02,791 --> 01:30:06,570
these needle biopsies and your thighs.
And then they did fat biopsy because

2162
01:30:06,571 --> 01:30:09,300
they wanted to look at fat content up on
either side of the hips.

2163
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:13,290
And then I ran for three hours on this
treadmill and it was horrible.

2164
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:15,020
There was like no TV.
There's no,

2165
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:17,850
no,
there's a white wall on the treadmill.

2166
01:30:17,851 --> 01:30:18,610
But they,
and,

2167
01:30:18,610 --> 01:30:21,050
and I was hooked up to like a a,
you know,

2168
01:30:21,060 --> 01:30:21,910
like,
like a,

2169
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,050
a blood collection device because it
was,

2170
01:30:25,500 --> 01:30:28,270
what am I in the night I had a Walkman
and a,

2171
01:30:28,330 --> 01:30:30,030
I had my,
I had my mouth,

2172
01:30:30,031 --> 01:30:34,770
my aerobics socks on like Jane Fonda
back in the day.

2173
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:35,730
Exactly.
Yeah.

2174
01:30:35,731 --> 01:30:37,950
And my running,
so you just running single hour staring

2175
01:30:37,951 --> 01:30:40,550
at the walls around for three hours.
Stats gotta be the worst part of it is

2176
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,393
horrible.
Yeah.

2177
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,320
I didn't know going in,
I walked in the room and I'm like,

2178
01:30:43,321 --> 01:30:45,000
Oh shit.
Cause I would have brought,

2179
01:30:45,030 --> 01:30:47,460
you know like yeah,
just something to watch.

2180
01:30:47,461 --> 01:30:52,461
But I ran and they were testing fat
oxidation rates at rest and an exercise.

2181
01:30:52,801 --> 01:30:54,360
So I'm wearing this,
this mask,

2182
01:30:54,370 --> 01:30:56,010
it's,
it does what's called indirect

2183
01:30:56,011 --> 01:30:59,070
calorimetry where based on the carbon
dioxide that you breathe out,

2184
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,130
the oxygen that you consume,
it approximates your carbohydrate and

2185
01:31:02,131 --> 01:31:02,990
your fat burning.
Right.

2186
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:05,830
It's Kinda like the gold standard of,
of metabolic testing in laboratory

2187
01:31:05,831 --> 01:31:08,760
testing situations like in an exercise
physiology lab.

2188
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,880
And so you're,
you're testing how much fat you're

2189
01:31:11,881 --> 01:31:14,130
burning during exercise,
how much carbohydrate you're burning

2190
01:31:14,131 --> 01:31:15,680
during exercise,
something called your,

2191
01:31:15,681 --> 01:31:17,520
your respiratory exchange ratio.

2192
01:31:17,570 --> 01:31:22,410
Is that what it's called?
And the prevailing uh,

2193
01:31:22,530 --> 01:31:27,510
research and the literature suggests
that you can burn about 1.0 grams of fat

2194
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:30,660
per minute during exercise.
Like that would be about how much fat

2195
01:31:30,661 --> 01:31:32,550
you would burn 1.0 grams of fat per
minute.

2196
01:31:32,910 --> 01:31:35,280
When they tested,
this was called the faster study f.

2197
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:36,450
A.
S.

2198
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:36,450
T.
E.

2199
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:38,190
R.
They found that the folks who fall at a

2200
01:31:38,191 --> 01:31:41,400
high fat diet like me and these other
people who were eating high fat diet,

2201
01:31:41,401 --> 01:31:46,080
we were burning 1.5 to 1.7 grams of fat
per minute during exercise.

2202
01:31:46,081 --> 01:31:49,140
During this three hour treadmill run.
We had no deficit in performance.

2203
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:53,760
Our Vo Two max is we're just as high and
we maintained our levels of muscle

2204
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:56,730
glycogen.
And so basically there was no,

2205
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:58,770
we didn't go any faster,
but I'm not saying like,

2206
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,630
like a Kenogenic diet is going to keep
better at endurance sports cause I've

2207
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:03,220
never seen any evidence that that's
going to happen.

2208
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:07,900
But we did go just as fast and we
actually burnt,

2209
01:32:07,901 --> 01:32:11,140
we turned our bodies into fat burning
machines over the course of 12 months.

2210
01:32:11,141 --> 01:32:14,050
It was actually a really cool study.
So the benefits would not be necessarily

2211
01:32:14,051 --> 01:32:17,180
performance,
but the benefits are more health tips.

2212
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,550
It's like,
you know,

2213
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:22,630
a lot of people like they get gut rot
and fermentation from eating a lot of

2214
01:32:22,631 --> 01:32:25,180
fermentable carbohydrates.
Some people get small intestinal

2215
01:32:25,181 --> 01:32:26,920
bacterial overgrowth.
Um,

2216
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,650
some people get blood glucose
fluctuations.

2217
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:30,640
Uh,
you see,

2218
01:32:30,641 --> 01:32:32,560
uh,
you see a drop in what's called the

2219
01:32:32,561 --> 01:32:35,170
first phase insulin response.
Like normally you're supposed to produce

2220
01:32:35,171 --> 01:32:38,650
a lot of insulin when you eat a meal or
at least enough to be able to shove that

2221
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:42,280
sub straight into storage tissue.
And normally you'd be able to produce

2222
01:32:42,281 --> 01:32:44,260
this.
And by getting a lot of glycaemic

2223
01:32:44,261 --> 01:32:47,230
variability during the day,
you eventually produce insulin

2224
01:32:47,231 --> 01:32:48,130
insensitivity,
right?

2225
01:32:48,130 --> 01:32:51,730
Like you don't have that normal first
phase insulin response and you can,

2226
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:52,653
you can restore it.
You know,

2227
01:32:52,660 --> 01:32:55,860
you can use things like bitters and chew
your food a lot and you know,

2228
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,270
strength trained before you eat a
carbohydrate rich meal and you know,

2229
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:00,850
things like that.
But ultimately,

2230
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:02,380
uh,
yeah,

2231
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,030
it's more of like a health and longevity
thing.

2232
01:33:04,031 --> 01:33:07,030
It's not like a like eating low
carbohydrate makes you faster.

2233
01:33:07,031 --> 01:33:10,360
It's just that you avoid a lot of the
potential issues,

2234
01:33:10,390 --> 01:33:13,810
the potential health issues that would
come with a large amount of glucose

2235
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:17,620
fluctuations.
But there's exceptions to that rule.

2236
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:20,470
Or like you could go get your genetics
tested and you might find out,

2237
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:22,870
you have,
let's say familial hypercholesterolemia,

2238
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:25,540
right?
In which case if you eat like a key

2239
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:28,330
topic diet,
you'll produce a lot of like oxidized

2240
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:30,190
and you'll see people with cholesterol
like 400,

2241
01:33:30,191 --> 01:33:34,570
500 and really high lp,
little a and all these issues with a

2242
01:33:34,571 --> 01:33:39,220
high amount of fat consumption because
their bodies are unable to deal with

2243
01:33:39,221 --> 01:33:40,810
that amount of cholesterol.

2244
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:42,670
Um,
that's a big point.

2245
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,980
That's a big point.
The customers can't stress that enough.

2246
01:33:44,981 --> 01:33:46,450
Is it human beings?
Very so.

2247
01:33:46,580 --> 01:33:47,830
And the huge,
yeah,

2248
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:49,000
huge amount.
Like a,

2249
01:33:49,020 --> 01:33:51,790
there's a great book that Brian Count
turned me onto that I'm reading right

2250
01:33:51,791 --> 01:33:56,560
now called Sapiens,
the origins of human beings.

2251
01:33:56,590 --> 01:33:58,870
It's completely fascinating.
It's crazy.

2252
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:00,880
There's another book called biochemical
individuality.

2253
01:34:00,910 --> 01:34:02,710
It's like an old book,
but I was looking through,

2254
01:34:02,711 --> 01:34:05,230
it's fascinating like,
like there's like 12 different shapes of

2255
01:34:05,231 --> 01:34:08,590
the stomach and like seven different
ways that the hardest shaped and certain

2256
01:34:08,591 --> 01:34:13,300
people will excrete copious amounts of
vitamin D and need a lot more vitamin D

2257
01:34:13,301 --> 01:34:17,590
intake and other people develop vitamin
D toxicity in response like the 2000 and

2258
01:34:17,591 --> 01:34:20,230
4,000 international units that a lot of
people are popping in these days.

2259
01:34:20,231 --> 01:34:23,920
Certain people develop high cholesterol
and high triglycerides and high

2260
01:34:23,921 --> 01:34:28,540
inflammation in response to to a
ketogenic diet and some people don't.

2261
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:33,720
And so like we live in an era where it's
like it's cheap to get your genes tested

2262
01:34:34,150 --> 01:34:35,800
and it's only going to get cheaper.
Well,

2263
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:39,190
it's also theirs.
You'd have to really find a good expert

2264
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:42,030
that really understands what the
difference in the genetic variability

2265
01:34:42,031 --> 01:34:42,570
is.
Our,

2266
01:34:42,570 --> 01:34:44,740
yeah,
I mean like otherwise you're just

2267
01:34:44,741 --> 01:34:46,870
testing,
like you're trying to ketogenetic diet,

2268
01:34:46,930 --> 01:34:49,300
testing out your blood work and trying
to figure it out.

2269
01:34:49,301 --> 01:34:52,450
It's very complicated to the,
for the lay person it is.

2270
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:54,850
But I mean like in very simplistic
terms,

2271
01:34:54,851 --> 01:34:57,470
I've told some people that that's right.
You could at least test your genetics

2272
01:34:57,680 --> 01:35:00,150
and there's actually a really good book
about this called uh,

2273
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:03,320
um,
the jungle effect by Doctor Daphne

2274
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,000
Miller.
And she goes into how like she'll put

2275
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:07,730
like her,
her Hispanic clients on like a

2276
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:11,090
traditional Mexican diet comprised of
like,

2277
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:12,110
you know,
uh,

2278
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:15,380
soaked and sprouted legumes and low
glycemic index,

2279
01:35:15,381 --> 01:35:18,770
you know,
tortillas and non gmo corn and take them

2280
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:21,020
back to what their ancestors would have
eaten.

2281
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,410
Like she'll literally take like what the
Tar Mahara Indian drive is eating and

2282
01:35:24,411 --> 01:35:26,870
South America and put her Hispanic
clients on that.

2283
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:31,900
Or she'll put like her African American
clients on a fiber rich fermented like

2284
01:35:31,941 --> 01:35:35,600
Cambodian diet and,
and you could easily do it like it's not

2285
01:35:35,601 --> 01:35:36,351
rocket science,
right?

2286
01:35:36,351 --> 01:35:37,580
You go,
your genetics tested,

2287
01:35:37,581 --> 01:35:41,330
you see where your ancestors came from
and you try to approximate,

2288
01:35:41,770 --> 01:35:45,830
and obviously we're a genetic melting
pot in America and there's gonna be some

2289
01:35:45,831 --> 01:35:47,750
people who are just like,
oh crap I came from,

2290
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:51,710
I come from Japan and Europe and
Ethiopia.

2291
01:35:51,711 --> 01:35:53,420
You know,
like there's some people who come from

2292
01:35:53,421 --> 01:35:55,100
all over the place,
in which case you would have to take a

2293
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:55,970
deeper dive,
right?

2294
01:35:55,971 --> 01:35:58,130
You can get blood work,
you can get,

2295
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,910
what I tell people is get your genes
tested like a comprehensive blood

2296
01:36:01,911 --> 01:36:04,490
analysis.
Get your gut tested,

2297
01:36:04,491 --> 01:36:04,700
right?

2298
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,770
So you could look at your bacterial
balance,

2299
01:36:06,771 --> 01:36:08,420
presence of parasites,
yeast,

2300
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:10,410
fungus,
all those kinds of little things that

2301
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:14,810
that affect gut health and personality
and everything else at the microbiome

2302
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:16,160
affects.
Uh,

2303
01:36:16,220 --> 01:36:18,260
and then like a,
like a urine test for hormones,

2304
01:36:18,261 --> 01:36:19,970
which is more accurate than a blood
test.

2305
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,460
That's a lot of testing.
But if you really,

2306
01:36:22,461 --> 01:36:26,060
really truly want to dial things in its
genetic testing,

2307
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:28,700
it's blood testing,
urinary testing for hormones.

2308
01:36:28,730 --> 01:36:29,840
There's a test called a,
the,

2309
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:32,540
the Dutch test.
It tests like your testosterone all

2310
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:35,330
throughout the day.
The metabolites of testosterone and your

2311
01:36:35,331 --> 01:36:38,060
cortisol all throughout the day,
the metabolites of Cortisol.

2312
01:36:38,061 --> 01:36:40,030
So you could actually see like,
you know,

2313
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:43,550
do I really have high cortisol or am I
just not breaking it down quickly

2314
01:36:43,551 --> 01:36:44,600
enough?
For example,

2315
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,050
I just wish there was a place that you
could go that was very comprehensive

2316
01:36:48,051 --> 01:36:51,200
that the average person go to where they
could do all this stuff for you and

2317
01:36:51,201 --> 01:36:52,190
break it down for you.

2318
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:54,630
That seems like there's more and more of
a market of that test.

2319
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,100
Every thousand dollars.
It's the Hue.

2320
01:36:56,330 --> 01:36:57,860
Actually.
There is a place like it's like the

2321
01:36:57,861 --> 01:36:59,260
human,
there's,

2322
01:36:59,290 --> 01:37:00,560
you know,
some of these guys who were like trying

2323
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:01,420
to live forever.
Like,

2324
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:03,110
uh,
I think one of them is,

2325
01:37:03,111 --> 01:37:05,120
is Peter Diamandis.
Uh,

2326
01:37:05,121 --> 01:37:09,320
Craig venter I think is another guy.
He's like the human human longevity

2327
01:37:09,321 --> 01:37:10,850
institute,
I think it's called.

2328
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:11,961
Yeah,
like some of these,

2329
01:37:11,961 --> 01:37:13,100
some of these rich dudes,
right?

2330
01:37:13,420 --> 01:37:15,860
Like a lot of these billionaires,
they're going to this place as and in

2331
01:37:15,861 --> 01:37:17,910
getting like the comprehensive blood
testing done.

2332
01:37:17,930 --> 01:37:20,270
I,
I do a lot of that myself just by

2333
01:37:20,271 --> 01:37:21,320
ordering it,
you know,

2334
01:37:21,321 --> 01:37:24,650
from like direct labs are these little,
you have a deep understanding and

2335
01:37:24,651 --> 01:37:27,260
knowledge about all this stuff.
It's different than the average price on

2336
01:37:27,261 --> 01:37:31,070
injecting stem cells into the mind.
But I think for the average person

2337
01:37:31,071 --> 01:37:32,390
that's listening to this,
it's uh,

2338
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:36,620
it's a little confusing and maybe a
little frustrating because it would be

2339
01:37:36,621 --> 01:37:38,000
nice if there was a place that you'd go
with the,

2340
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:40,220
like the dentist,
you go to the dentist,

2341
01:37:40,221 --> 01:37:41,520
Hey bob,
you've got a cavity.

2342
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:45,150
It's all pretty straight.
Exactly that will,

2343
01:37:45,170 --> 01:37:47,020
there's companies working on that right
now.

2344
01:37:47,030 --> 01:37:49,220
Like,
like an actual dashboard where you get a

2345
01:37:49,221 --> 01:37:53,210
home test kit done and they're like,
they're actually like microneedles now

2346
01:37:53,510 --> 01:37:56,610
that you can attach to the scan that you
patch it on yourself,

2347
01:37:56,760 --> 01:37:58,890
you send off a tiny,
tiny amount of blood and you'd get a

2348
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:03,300
host of blood values back and then you
would be able to see like what you have

2349
01:38:03,301 --> 01:38:05,940
deficits in.
And I could totally see them pairing

2350
01:38:05,941 --> 01:38:08,760
that with like food delivery companies
are like,

2351
01:38:08,761 --> 01:38:09,870
you know,
even just like printouts.

2352
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:10,800
So like,
here's your protein,

2353
01:38:10,801 --> 01:38:12,130
carb fat ratio.
Right?

2354
01:38:12,780 --> 01:38:13,890
It'll happen.
Now,

2355
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:16,500
when you were on the strict Ketogenic
Diet for 12 months,

2356
01:38:16,501 --> 01:38:19,190
what was your diet like?
What did you basically eat?

2357
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:20,513
No Italian.

2358
01:38:22,690 --> 01:38:24,370
Great.
When you got off,

2359
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:30,390
I remember what I was like my
bodybuilding days where like you go way

2360
01:38:30,391 --> 01:38:34,440
in like in the morning before the show
and then the rest of the day you eat

2361
01:38:34,441 --> 01:38:39,441
like freaking ice cream and bread and
you look like just like an Olympic God

2362
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:41,790
when you get up on stage cause
everything's popping right.

2363
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:44,280
Like all that glycogen gets restored
after about eight hours.

2364
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:45,690
Uh,
the,

2365
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:47,620
how does that work on my first meal?
Well,

2366
01:38:48,060 --> 01:38:51,510
when you don't eat many carbohydrates,
you upregulate levels was something

2367
01:38:51,511 --> 01:38:54,660
called glycogen synthase,
which is an enzyme responsible for

2368
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:56,640
helping to get glycogen in the muscle
tissue.

2369
01:38:56,641 --> 01:38:58,320
This would be a process that you would
do before,

2370
01:38:58,530 --> 01:39:02,430
like Aj and depletion followed by
glycogen restoration causes this big

2371
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:05,610
surge in glycogen plus going into a
show,

2372
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:10,530
you're restricting carbohydrates anyways
because it's hard to get very,

2373
01:39:10,531 --> 01:39:13,560
very low body fat.
That's why you see bodybuilders eating

2374
01:39:13,660 --> 01:39:15,590
fricking like chicken and Broccoli,
right?

2375
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:16,860
So,
um,

2376
01:39:17,070 --> 01:39:18,840
the,
the same thing.

2377
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:20,520
It's something I did when I did
triathlon.

2378
01:39:20,521 --> 01:39:22,410
Right.
You'll like carbohydrate deplete the

2379
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:24,480
weekend before a race.
And then I used to do this.

2380
01:39:24,481 --> 01:39:29,481
You'd eat no carbohydrates on Saturday
and Sunday for a race that follows the

2381
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:32,220
next Sunday.
And then Monday you'd start to eat more

2382
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:35,910
carbohydrates Tuesday even more.
And by like Saturday before the Ray

2383
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:38,680
Street and like 90% carbohydrate.
This is what I did before I kind of

2384
01:39:38,690 --> 01:39:40,040
trained my body to like,
you know,

2385
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:42,780
ketosis and function while on a low carb
diet.

2386
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:44,130
But it,
you're just,

2387
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:47,880
I mean you're jacked up chock full of
glycogen cause you upregulate that

2388
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:49,710
enzyme.
It's called a,

2389
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:51,030
what's it called?
Carbohydrate.

2390
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:52,720
Let's just basically carbohydrate
depletion,

2391
01:39:52,750 --> 01:39:55,620
carbohydrate loading.
So was there any benefit of that

2392
01:39:55,621 --> 01:39:57,840
performance wise versus what you're
doing now?

2393
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:01,860
Um,
there's,

2394
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:07,790
there's not necessarily a benefit in
that you,

2395
01:40:09,180 --> 01:40:12,480
uh,
you go faster if you've trained your

2396
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:15,570
body how to operate well on a low
carbohydrate diet.

2397
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,220
I've never,
like I said,

2398
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:21,300
seen any evidence that like a low
carbohydrate ketogenetic diet makes you

2399
01:40:21,301 --> 01:40:26,250
go faster than if you were eating like a
regular like carbohydrate rich diet.

2400
01:40:26,700 --> 01:40:30,360
But I also haven't seen that.
If you do like I did and follow it

2401
01:40:30,361 --> 01:40:33,720
strict for a long time.
There's not a lot of evidence that makes

2402
01:40:33,721 --> 01:40:36,090
you go slower either.
So it's kind of like,

2403
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:37,840
it's like even as a kid,
right?

2404
01:40:37,890 --> 01:40:40,950
So it's just a health longevity Ben.
It's more of like,

2405
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:42,990
hey,
if I can live a longer time and feel

2406
01:40:42,991 --> 01:40:47,310
better and produce less reactive oxygen
species by doing this versus the high

2407
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:50,460
carbohydrate intake,
then why not do it?

2408
01:40:50,461 --> 01:40:53,800
And I mean when you look at like the
Nike project and how they were to break

2409
01:40:53,801 --> 01:40:57,880
the marathon record in Italy,
they were using like these crazy

2410
01:40:57,881 --> 01:41:00,970
engineered forms of carbohydrate where
they went way above like these

2411
01:41:00,971 --> 01:41:03,940
Maltodextrin,
fructose blends that a lot of companies

2412
01:41:03,941 --> 01:41:04,360
like,
you know,

2413
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:07,420
like gatorade use and they were using
these super engineered carbs.

2414
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:10,990
It's possible that some of these newer
carbohydrates that are engineered for

2415
01:41:10,991 --> 01:41:14,200
extremely high absorption could,
could beat out.

2416
01:41:14,201 --> 01:41:16,030
Like if we were to study those in like
a,

2417
01:41:16,031 --> 01:41:17,050
you know,
a high fat,

2418
01:41:17,051 --> 01:41:19,990
low carb athlete who had followed that
diet for a long period of time versus

2419
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:23,020
like a traditionally fueled athlete who
was eating these new fangled engineered

2420
01:41:23,021 --> 01:41:25,450
carbohydrates.
It's possible the new fangled engineered

2421
01:41:25,451 --> 01:41:28,630
carbohydrates could make you go faster
button unless your paycheck is on the

2422
01:41:28,631 --> 01:41:31,120
line and you're a pro.
I still say,

2423
01:41:31,610 --> 01:41:34,660
why not get that balance between health
and longevity and speed.

2424
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:39,960
My thyroid though did not like that high
fat ketogenic diet director paired with

2425
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,990
high levels of physical activity.
My testosterone went down were like

2426
01:41:43,991 --> 01:41:46,540
there were some issues.
That's fascinating because usually you

2427
01:41:46,541 --> 01:41:49,060
hear the opposite.
People with thyroid disease,

2428
01:41:49,070 --> 01:41:51,700
they recommend a ketogenic diet to those
people.

2429
01:41:51,860 --> 01:41:52,570
Yeah.

2430
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:56,860
But look at it this way and I explained
this to to a lot of athletes who I work

2431
01:41:56,861 --> 01:41:58,630
with who wanted to do the ketogenic diet
thing.

2432
01:41:58,631 --> 01:41:59,320
You read,
uh,

2433
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,030
you know,
you read a book like a,

2434
01:42:01,031 --> 01:42:02,830
you know,
there's some fantastic ketogenic diets

2435
01:42:02,831 --> 01:42:05,710
out there that are plant rich,
which a lot of ketogenetic diets aren't

2436
01:42:05,740 --> 01:42:07,810
right?
Like there'll be like coconut oil and

2437
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:11,470
butter and that actually creates a lot
of gastric inflammation.

2438
01:42:11,471 --> 01:42:12,850
In the absence of,
of like,

2439
01:42:12,851 --> 01:42:14,320
you know,
high amount of polyphenols and

2440
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:17,410
flavonoids and high fiber and planning
type like you want both.

2441
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:20,770
I wrote an article about this called the
dark side of coconut oil that gets into

2442
01:42:20,771 --> 01:42:22,720
the fact that if you're going to do like
a high fat,

2443
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:26,380
low carb Ketogenic type of diet,
you would want to include a lot of

2444
01:42:26,381 --> 01:42:29,950
plants and like uh,
a Dr. Terry Walls is a book called the

2445
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:32,620
walls protocol that's got a plant rich
kenogenic version it.

2446
01:42:32,650 --> 01:42:34,300
Um,
Steven gundry has his book,

2447
01:42:34,301 --> 01:42:37,930
the plant paradox and he has like a,
he has like a ketogenic version in that

2448
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:40,930
book that's like very plant rich.
So if,

2449
01:42:40,990 --> 01:42:44,860
if you're eating like a,
like a plant rich keto genic diet and

2450
01:42:44,861 --> 01:42:46,780
you're following what a lot of these
people I've written,

2451
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:50,620
you generally be advised he like 30 to
50 grams of carbohydrates per day,

2452
01:42:50,860 --> 01:42:54,130
which is fine if you have thyroid
disease or you have some other issue,

2453
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:55,150
you know,
pre diabetes,

2454
01:42:55,151 --> 01:42:56,470
whatever,
and you're trying to control it with a

2455
01:42:56,471 --> 01:43:00,010
ketogenic diet.
But then once you throw copious amounts

2456
01:43:00,011 --> 01:43:01,540
of physical activity into the mix,
right?

2457
01:43:01,541 --> 01:43:03,970
Your crossfit or you're an Ironman
triathlete and you go read the one of

2458
01:43:03,971 --> 01:43:06,220
these books and you read the supposed to
be 50 grams of carbohydrates,

2459
01:43:06,221 --> 01:43:08,470
well you know,
the authors of those books,

2460
01:43:08,471 --> 01:43:13,230
to my knowledge are not out racing
ironman triathlons and doing marathons

2461
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,460
and copious amounts of physical
activity.

2462
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:18,250
So you have to up the carbohydrate
intake.

2463
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:19,690
So it's all about,
you know,

2464
01:43:19,691 --> 01:43:22,840
so for me personally,
like a hundred to 200 grams of

2465
01:43:22,841 --> 01:43:25,210
carbohydrate,
it's still bad tanky carbohydrate feed.

2466
01:43:25,211 --> 01:43:27,970
At the end of the day I'll still
maintain ketosis.

2467
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,390
And so you again,
you have your cake and eat it too.

2468
01:43:31,420 --> 01:43:33,360
That's a radical physical output though.
You're taking.

2469
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:36,610
Exactly.
So if you have like a thyroid issue and

2470
01:43:36,611 --> 01:43:39,370
you're highly active and you want to
follow Ketogenic Diet,

2471
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,550
then you need to include more
carbohydrates than it would be

2472
01:43:42,551 --> 01:43:46,350
recommended in let's say like a more
sedentary type of ketone giant die

2473
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:50,200
because you're always reading these
diets based on just the average person

2474
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:52,930
and the average person is just not going
to put out that kind of APP.

2475
01:43:52,931 --> 01:43:55,640
You want to include a lot of the things
that that you tend to build up deficits

2476
01:43:55,641 --> 01:44:00,130
in like potassium and magnesium or two
biggies and you dump a lot of glycogen

2477
01:44:00,131 --> 01:44:02,240
and glycogen stores,
a bunch of water and it stores a bunch

2478
01:44:02,241 --> 01:44:02,930
of electrolytes.

2479
01:44:02,930 --> 01:44:06,020
You have to figure out how to replace
that and now people are using,

2480
01:44:06,050 --> 01:44:08,390
you know these,
these exogenous ketones,

2481
01:44:08,830 --> 01:44:13,830
the ketone salts or Ketone esters and
the danger with those is now you can

2482
01:44:14,391 --> 01:44:18,740
like get into ketosis but still also
have high blood glucose and that's

2483
01:44:18,741 --> 01:44:20,090
something that we haven't really
studied.

2484
01:44:20,091 --> 01:44:24,110
Like that's not like our ancestors out
hunting right for that.

2485
01:44:24,140 --> 01:44:28,190
Like it's not like were in ketosis
because they were burning a lot of their

2486
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:30,740
own body fat.
And generating keytones as a byproduct.

2487
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:34,730
And they were,
they were in just like a natural state

2488
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:37,370
cause they weren't eating a lot of food.
Sometimes just,

2489
01:44:37,420 --> 01:44:39,170
you know,
not stuffing their face with

2490
01:44:39,171 --> 01:44:42,560
carbohydrates and glucose.
But now people are able to eat a normal

2491
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:46,580
western diet and like buy one of these
ketone supplements and also be in

2492
01:44:46,581 --> 01:44:48,530
Ketosis.
So you're hyperglycemic and

2493
01:44:48,531 --> 01:44:51,230
hyperkeratotic.
And I've like,

2494
01:44:51,231 --> 01:44:54,020
I did that before race and I felt like I
was on steroids.

2495
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,440
Like it was like rocket fuel because my
blood glucose was jacked through the

2496
01:44:57,441 --> 01:45:00,230
roof.
But so I did a bunch of like fructose

2497
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:02,030
Maltodextrin,
energy based gels,

2498
01:45:02,360 --> 01:45:04,700
and then I drank a bottle of these
ketone esters,

2499
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,150
which basically,
I mean the,

2500
01:45:06,151 --> 01:45:08,210
they have,
if you measure your ketones,

2501
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,070
you'll,
you'll know that this is high.

2502
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:13,310
But within 10 minutes,
my values were above seven millimolar,

2503
01:45:13,311 --> 01:45:15,530
which is just off the charts for
ketones.

2504
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,960
But my blood glucose was also off the
charts.

2505
01:45:18,230 --> 01:45:21,710
And I felt like my cells had like both
forms of fuel they'd ever need,

2506
01:45:21,711 --> 01:45:25,040
both ketones and glucose.
And I felt amazing.

2507
01:45:25,280 --> 01:45:27,410
But all bet,
I mean that's similar like diabetic

2508
01:45:27,411 --> 01:45:28,820
ketoacidosis.
Like,

2509
01:45:28,821 --> 01:45:30,920
if you're in that state all the time and
you're using all these ketone

2510
01:45:30,921 --> 01:45:34,220
supplements and just eating your diet
and using these cause your quote in

2511
01:45:34,221 --> 01:45:36,890
Ketosis Unquote,
I don't think it's healthy.

2512
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:39,500
I wonder if it would be great though
performance wise,

2513
01:45:39,770 --> 01:45:41,570
like for a fight.
It's amazing.

2514
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:44,090
It's amazing.
You feel unstoppable.

2515
01:45:44,150 --> 01:45:47,180
I would think that,
I wonder if athletes I've tried and as

2516
01:45:47,181 --> 01:45:49,280
long as you use that is,
it's like a,

2517
01:45:49,430 --> 01:45:50,570
it's like you use it as a,
you know,

2518
01:45:50,571 --> 01:45:53,390
it's like heard somebody say when it's
like sugars are sometimes drug,

2519
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:55,630
right?
Cause it does like you can feel it and

2520
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:56,660
can give you,
especially if you're,

2521
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:59,330
if you're not fat adapted,
I mean carbohydrates give you a pretty

2522
01:45:59,331 --> 01:46:02,330
big boost in performance and energy
versus not having them on board and

2523
01:46:02,331 --> 01:46:06,440
you're exercising and especial or
exercising hard and this would be like

2524
01:46:06,441 --> 01:46:06,830
that,
right?

2525
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:09,830
Like if you were to use that as a
sometimes drug and be careful with it.

2526
01:46:10,180 --> 01:46:12,260
Um,
I could see that being a huge,

2527
01:46:12,261 --> 01:46:14,060
like it was kind of a bump where you
going to like,

2528
01:46:14,540 --> 01:46:16,010
um,
I didn't quantify it.

2529
01:46:16,010 --> 01:46:17,320
If you try to use it was,
it was,

2530
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:22,580
it was a tough mudder in Vegas and all I
know is I felt way,

2531
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:27,590
way more.like,
like I had the cognitive high that you

2532
01:46:27,591 --> 01:46:29,990
get from ketones,
which was the original reason that I

2533
01:46:29,991 --> 01:46:32,330
started doing,
like I started doing this ketosis thing

2534
01:46:32,331 --> 01:46:35,300
like seven years ago when I was getting
ready to race iron man Canada.

2535
01:46:35,630 --> 01:46:38,480
And I wanted to see what it would feel
like to have those readily available

2536
01:46:38,481 --> 01:46:42,230
fuel sources for the liver and the
diaphragm and the heart and kind of the

2537
01:46:42,231 --> 01:46:45,260
focus that comes with high levels of
ketones when you're on a bike for five

2538
01:46:45,261 --> 01:46:47,750
hours.
And I had that when I took these

2539
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:50,160
exogenous ketones,
but then I also had all the energy that

2540
01:46:50,161 --> 01:46:50,971
you get when you just,
you know,

2541
01:46:50,971 --> 01:46:53,820
like after you've had like a,
like a candy bar,

2542
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:54,150
right?

2543
01:46:54,150 --> 01:46:55,020
So it's,
yeah,

2544
01:46:55,021 --> 01:46:56,760
your high blood sugar and high blood
ketones.

2545
01:46:56,761 --> 01:46:58,770
So you'd,
so you'd just feel focused,

2546
01:46:58,950 --> 01:47:01,920
but you also have high levels of energy.
That sounds amazing.

2547
01:47:02,220 --> 01:47:06,180
That's amazing.
I just like the stem cells in the tech

2548
01:47:06,181 --> 01:47:07,830
cry.
It's amazing.

2549
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:09,240
I hope it's good.
I hope I don't die.

2550
01:47:09,280 --> 01:47:11,700
Yeah.
That sounds like though if you were

2551
01:47:11,701 --> 01:47:15,450
doing a big event and if you didn't do
it up to the like,

2552
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:18,690
I like what you're doing is in terms of
diet wise it seems like it makes sense.

2553
01:47:18,691 --> 01:47:22,080
I've got a really good balance,
but for a big event that sounds like

2554
01:47:22,081 --> 01:47:24,690
it'd be a really good thing to do.
Look it up on carbohydrates,

2555
01:47:24,700 --> 01:47:26,520
load up on the ketone esters.
Right,

2556
01:47:26,820 --> 01:47:29,580
exactly.
Tonessa ketone esters are expensive.

2557
01:47:29,610 --> 01:47:31,270
Yeah,
and a lot of these ketone salts you

2558
01:47:31,310 --> 01:47:32,820
don't like about the ketone salts too
is,

2559
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:36,210
I haven't seen a lot of resources at the
ketone esters are necessarily that much

2560
01:47:36,211 --> 01:47:36,480
better.

2561
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,280
And the ketone salts,
you get electrolytes with them too.

2562
01:47:38,420 --> 01:47:39,270
Right,
and that's one of the things that you

2563
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:40,110
get depleted on.
I'm like,

2564
01:47:40,111 --> 01:47:43,630
what ketogenetic do you know what,
what brand you're using for your ketone

2565
01:47:43,631 --> 01:47:44,970
supplements?
Dude,

2566
01:47:44,971 --> 01:47:48,270
I told you I'm like,
as a blogger I get these packages sent

2567
01:47:48,271 --> 01:47:50,070
to my house every day.
Just like you probably get the same

2568
01:47:50,071 --> 01:47:52,080
thing.
It's like cardboard boxes full of boxes

2569
01:47:52,370 --> 01:47:55,020
and occasional little paper bag.
It was something that somebody made in

2570
01:47:55,021 --> 01:47:58,890
their kitchen that they sent,
somebody gave me.

2571
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:00,570
Uh,
so when we gave me,

2572
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:01,650
when I was,
this was,

2573
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:03,810
where was,
I think it was an Asheville doing a race

2574
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:07,590
and Asheville,
North Carolina at Asheville fricking

2575
01:48:07,591 --> 01:48:10,440
great fat is oh,
crazy little spot.

2576
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:12,240
I,
one of my clients took me to this place

2577
01:48:12,241 --> 01:48:15,300
called karate.
It's like a shark coolray like a fine

2578
01:48:15,301 --> 01:48:16,530
shark,
a restaurant.

2579
01:48:16,650 --> 01:48:19,020
Amazing me.
Amazing.

2580
01:48:19,320 --> 01:48:22,620
Apparently like a president,
President Obama's like favorite

2581
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:26,710
restaurant wasn't Asheville and he'd go
there and you go up and down the street

2582
01:48:26,711 --> 01:48:28,270
and just,
I went there during the yoga festival

2583
01:48:28,271 --> 01:48:30,660
and there's like people sitting up in
trees playing banjos and like,

2584
01:48:31,050 --> 01:48:31,950
it's crazy.
It's amazing.

2585
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,090
I definitely want to go back there.
Yeah,

2586
01:48:34,110 --> 01:48:36,810
the International Yoga Festival in
Asheville,

2587
01:48:36,900 --> 01:48:39,330
but the um,
shout out to Ashville,

2588
01:48:39,990 --> 01:48:42,630
Ashville,
baby Hashtag Asheville somebody gave me

2589
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:45,150
like wine that they infused with
cannabis,

2590
01:48:45,570 --> 01:48:48,240
like at like this big bottle,
like cannabis infused wine.

2591
01:48:48,241 --> 01:48:51,720
But it was like one of those old school
like Kombucha bottles,

2592
01:48:51,721 --> 01:48:54,320
like the glass and you're just like,
I don't know where this has been.

2593
01:48:54,321 --> 01:48:56,280
[inaudible] I don't know what's in here.
Nope.

2594
01:48:56,640 --> 01:48:58,560
Um,
it was a cool idea,

2595
01:48:58,561 --> 01:48:59,250
but,
uh,

2596
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:02,820
no offense to whoever gave me that,
but I didn't actually consume that.

2597
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:03,930
But the,
uh,

2598
01:49:03,930 --> 01:49:06,910
the ketone salts and the ketone esters,
um,

2599
01:49:07,260 --> 01:49:07,861
honestly,
dude,

2600
01:49:07,861 --> 01:49:10,100
I've tried like all of them,
uh,

2601
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:13,270
you know,
key genics and uh,

2602
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:16,860
Kito I forget what the enteral Kido
something Keith keep genics and went to

2603
01:49:16,861 --> 01:49:19,620
school in Nashville and uh,
he said that they started giving the

2604
01:49:19,621 --> 01:49:24,180
cows a certain diet to kill the silicide
mushrooms that grow in their shit

2605
01:49:24,510 --> 01:49:29,220
because too many kids were climbing
fences and early and plucking mushrooms

2606
01:49:29,460 --> 01:49:30,030
out of the cow.

2607
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:31,380
Shit.
You ever do that?

2608
01:49:31,430 --> 01:49:35,700
You ever do like the silicide been
microdosing thing that people are doing

2609
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:39,330
for cognition?
I have silicide microdosed I've taken

2610
01:49:39,331 --> 01:49:41,820
and it gives you a nice feeling.
I like it gives you,

2611
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:46,500
I have a friend who's a world champion
kickboxer who micro doses every day and

2612
01:49:46,501 --> 01:49:49,810
he says it him almost telepathic,
you says it makes his,

2613
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:53,500
his response time to sparring.
He said he sees things before they

2614
01:49:53,501 --> 01:49:57,160
happen or sensory perception,
especially in nature settings,

2615
01:49:57,670 --> 01:49:58,091
right?
Like,

2616
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:00,400
there's this,
there's like this synthetic chemical,

2617
01:50:00,401 --> 01:50:03,070
ella chemical,
LSD or pls.

2618
01:50:03,071 --> 01:50:05,650
LSD is like the one a lot of people are
using now cause you get it for a lot

2619
01:50:05,651 --> 01:50:08,850
less expensive and it,
it has the same effect as,

2620
01:50:08,851 --> 01:50:10,030
as LSD.
It's just,

2621
01:50:10,031 --> 01:50:11,890
it's,
it's a lot cheaper and you get both and

2622
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:14,420
you don't like these websites where you
use cryptocurrency to,

2623
01:50:14,421 --> 01:50:15,790
to purchase the compound.

2624
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:18,290
But the FBI sent it to you.
Exactly.

2625
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:21,880
They dunt dunt dunt Duh.
You,

2626
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:25,180
uh,
it's very synthetic and there's like a

2627
01:50:25,181 --> 01:50:27,790
merging of the left and right
hemispheres of the brain and you get

2628
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:30,940
very creative and focus simultaneously
doses you,

2629
01:50:30,941 --> 01:50:32,350
uh,
for Lsd,

2630
01:50:32,650 --> 01:50:35,680
you,
you want to volume metrically dose,

2631
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:38,020
which means like if you get a blotter of
Lsd,

2632
01:50:38,021 --> 01:50:40,720
it's like a hundred micrograms.
I'm like a square.

2633
01:50:40,721 --> 01:50:43,030
And a lot of people will cut that into
like 10 pieces.

2634
01:50:43,031 --> 01:50:45,190
So that one piece would be 10
micrograms.

2635
01:50:45,191 --> 01:50:48,610
But you don't know if that piece has
like 20 or five on it.

2636
01:50:48,670 --> 01:50:52,840
Right?
So you take a hundred a hundred

2637
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:55,660
microgram tab and you put that in like a
little like a,

2638
01:50:55,690 --> 01:51:00,520
like a glass dropper bottle and then you
would add like 10 milliliters of

2639
01:51:00,521 --> 01:51:03,670
everclear or vodka or some kind of
alcohol to it.

2640
01:51:04,090 --> 01:51:09,090
And then you know that for every one
milliliter of alcohol in that little

2641
01:51:09,311 --> 01:51:13,120
dropper bottle that you consume,
you're getting exactly 10 micrograms of

2642
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:17,860
LSD and about 10 to 20 micrograms,
like one to two dropper bottles full.

2643
01:51:18,100 --> 01:51:20,440
That would be considered a microdose for
most people.

2644
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:24,550
But you don't like returning to
psilocybin.

2645
01:51:24,760 --> 01:51:28,750
Silicide produces like this sensory
perception,

2646
01:51:29,140 --> 01:51:31,730
very natural feeling,
uh,

2647
01:51:32,170 --> 01:51:35,510
improvement in your,
in your cognition and your senses that,

2648
01:51:35,520 --> 01:51:37,590
that it just feels more natural rights.
Like you,

2649
01:51:37,890 --> 01:51:41,630
you would take it before you go on on a
hike or you would take it when you're in

2650
01:51:41,631 --> 01:51:42,960
like a very,
very natural,

2651
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:47,770
like a nature setting.
Like for something like a day at the

2652
01:51:47,771 --> 01:51:49,570
office.
Like it seems like Lsd is like a more

2653
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:51,310
natural choice.
But suicide is really interesting for

2654
01:51:51,311 --> 01:51:51,850
like,
you know,

2655
01:51:51,850 --> 01:51:53,390
nature based setting,
hiking.

2656
01:51:53,500 --> 01:51:55,430
Well,
the thing about it is you feel like you,

2657
01:51:55,490 --> 01:51:58,690
you're getting readings from trees and
plants.

2658
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,060
Yeah.
Get a weird feeling from the,

2659
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:04,690
you don't normally get like,
oh now I'm tuned into whatever frequency

2660
01:52:04,691 --> 01:52:07,720
you guys are operating and they,
they feel alive.

2661
01:52:08,110 --> 01:52:11,110
Whereas trees just feel like trees.
Normally I walk by like they look

2662
01:52:11,111 --> 01:52:13,870
beautiful and,
but I don't feel them write the same

2663
01:52:13,871 --> 01:52:14,704
sentence.
Right,

2664
01:52:14,710 --> 01:52:15,531
exactly.
And,

2665
01:52:15,531 --> 01:52:16,510
and I mean,
you don't want to,

2666
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:19,660
you don't want to make yourself
dependent on finding a tree beautiful by

2667
01:52:19,661 --> 01:52:22,470
whether or not you have silicide even a
beautiful turn blood stream.

2668
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:24,550
Like it's communicating with you.
You know what I'm saying?

2669
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:27,850
It's like exactly like they're giving
you information,

2670
01:52:27,880 --> 01:52:30,520
you save it for those settings when you
want nature to be really special.

2671
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,710
Because my wife gives me a hard time
sometimes she was like,

2672
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:34,320
you know,
why do you gotta take psilocybin for,

2673
01:52:34,321 --> 01:52:35,350
I got to go on a hike.
Like,

2674
01:52:35,351 --> 01:52:37,540
why don't you just go on a hike?
And I told her,

2675
01:52:37,541 --> 01:52:39,070
you know,
sometimes it's more interesting.

2676
01:52:39,071 --> 01:52:41,170
Sometimes you see things you wouldn't
normally otherwise see.

2677
01:52:41,700 --> 01:52:42,820
So,
you know,

2678
01:52:42,821 --> 01:52:47,780
I go to bed and I've got like my
binaural beats and my sleep mask and you

2679
01:52:47,781 --> 01:52:49,160
know,
I've got like that little grounding

2680
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:54,090
earthing device under my body and my
chilly pad and uh,

2681
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,170
you know,
blue light blocking glasses and,

2682
01:52:56,230 --> 01:52:58,670
and you know,
I get in bed with all these wires

2683
01:52:58,671 --> 01:53:01,910
sticking up out of my head and my wife
just gets in bed and just like sleeps

2684
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:03,480
cause just got nothing on her side.

2685
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:05,990
So we're very yin and Yang.
But you're still involved like

2686
01:53:05,991 --> 01:53:07,610
everything you're doing,
you're very involved.

2687
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:10,370
Does it ever feel overwhelming that you
have all this stuff?

2688
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:12,240
I mean obviously it's what you do cause
you,

2689
01:53:12,241 --> 01:53:14,000
you systematize it,
right?

2690
01:53:14,001 --> 01:53:17,090
Like when I walk into my office,
it's not like I'm spending 20 minutes

2691
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:21,170
like turning on the turning on the Jews
of light and putting on the essential

2692
01:53:21,171 --> 01:53:24,370
oil diffuser and um,
uh,

2693
01:53:24,410 --> 01:53:25,420
you know,
I've got like a,

2694
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:27,230
this,
this device that creates like special

2695
01:53:27,231 --> 01:53:28,820
water that you breathe.
Well,

2696
01:53:28,821 --> 01:53:31,280
you know,
humidifies the water that you breathe

2697
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:34,130
while you're working.
And I've got like,

2698
01:53:34,131 --> 01:53:35,840
you know,
blue light generating devices on the

2699
01:53:35,841 --> 01:53:38,000
ceiling and all this stuff in my office.
But when I walk in there,

2700
01:53:38,001 --> 01:53:38,811
it's just like click,
click,

2701
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:41,300
click,
and I go to work right it with the thing

2702
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:42,230
on my head or whatever.

2703
01:53:42,230 --> 01:53:43,820
So it's,
once you systematize it,

2704
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:46,970
it's not exhausting.
It's not like you're doing a lot to

2705
01:53:46,971 --> 01:53:51,560
actually improve your body or you don't
say Bilac your body while you're,

2706
01:53:51,590 --> 01:53:53,900
while you're at work during a lot of
stuff just become systematized,

2707
01:53:53,930 --> 01:53:55,070
right?
It's like putting on your pants in the

2708
01:53:55,071 --> 01:53:57,980
morning.
The words about done,

2709
01:53:58,040 --> 01:54:02,090
I'm about done with that word.
Biohack were beaten up that word.

2710
01:54:02,150 --> 01:54:04,820
Now what I would consider to be
biohacking is,

2711
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:07,010
you know,
these dudes that like in jet chlorella

2712
01:54:07,070 --> 01:54:09,650
into their eyes so that they could get
night vision.

2713
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:11,540
You should pull that up.
Or,

2714
01:54:11,541 --> 01:54:12,320
or like,
uh,

2715
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:13,470
Kevin,
Kevin Warrick,

2716
01:54:13,471 --> 01:54:17,730
like he was like the original Cyborg guy
who got like a chip implanted under the

2717
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:21,770
skin or the people who will inject like
magnets in their fingertips to be able

2718
01:54:21,771 --> 01:54:25,130
to interact with devices.
So they would use the human body is what

2719
01:54:25,131 --> 01:54:27,120
they call wet ware and then install
hardware.

2720
01:54:27,170 --> 01:54:32,170
Like to me that's a true biohacker for
me to blend like curcumin with olive oil

2721
01:54:33,801 --> 01:54:35,690
and bone broth and vitamin C and my
smoothie.

2722
01:54:35,691 --> 01:54:37,430
That's not like a biohack.
That's just a health,

2723
01:54:37,530 --> 01:54:38,740
just like making a meal,
right?

2724
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:39,583
Like it's,
it's like,

2725
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:40,790
yeah.
Yeah.

2726
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:45,140
So I took it too.
There are trending through bio hackers

2727
01:54:45,141 --> 01:54:50,141
out there who actually hacked their
biology but injecting chlorella in your

2728
01:54:50,871 --> 01:54:51,910
eyes.
Yeah,

2729
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:54,440
it seems super risky actually.
You know,

2730
01:54:54,450 --> 01:54:56,270
I think its chlorophyll,
which is the,

2731
01:54:56,360 --> 01:55:00,350
which is the green active component that
you would find something like Chlorella,

2732
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,290
but his eyes were all black.
It's really where you should pull it up,

2733
01:55:03,291 --> 01:55:05,150
Jamie.
Like dude injected ever.

2734
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:09,080
I'm assuming.
I mean I don't think he could suck the

2735
01:55:09,081 --> 01:55:12,920
chlorophyll back out,
but he has night vision now or the guy

2736
01:55:12,921 --> 01:55:14,830
who is goat man.
Did you hear about Goldman?

2737
01:55:15,210 --> 01:55:15,410
No.

2738
01:55:15,410 --> 01:55:16,101
Hold on.
Let's one,

2739
01:55:16,101 --> 01:55:18,370
one step at a time.
You're almost manic and it's like,

2740
01:55:18,380 --> 01:55:19,570
I've got another one.
I got another one.

2741
01:55:19,590 --> 01:55:23,870
Hold on.
So this guy has permanent black in his

2742
01:55:23,871 --> 01:55:26,450
eyes and he can see like sorta like a
deer,

2743
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,920
like nocturnal.
Oh yeah,

2744
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,630
that's him.
That's okay.

2745
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:35,300
Making science more available to the
public have been testing of chemicals

2746
01:55:35,450 --> 01:55:37,850
that allows humans to see in the dark
and it works.

2747
01:55:38,300 --> 01:55:39,560
That's a true bio.
Ha.

2748
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,360
That's a correct use of the term
biohacking.

2749
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:46,110
It's got some other people.
Then you can get like,

2750
01:55:46,111 --> 01:55:47,010
uh,
what's this on?

2751
01:55:47,011 --> 01:55:48,450
Nerdist.
Yeah.

2752
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:51,330
nerdist.com there it goes straight into
the eye.

2753
01:55:51,331 --> 01:55:54,660
I'm not going to do that.
I will stop at the stem cells into my

2754
01:55:54,661 --> 01:55:56,340
Dick.
I'm not going to know things.

2755
01:55:56,370 --> 01:55:59,910
The speculum holding my eyes open was by
far the worst part.

2756
01:56:00,720 --> 01:56:03,120
Even the effects themselves were very
subtle.

2757
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:04,050
It wasn't like,
oh my God,

2758
01:56:04,051 --> 01:56:05,790
I have Predator vision.
Nothing like that.

2759
01:56:05,940 --> 01:56:07,860
You don't get super powers.
This is a tweak,

2760
01:56:07,861 --> 01:56:10,260
not an overhaul.
It's kind of disappointing that you go

2761
01:56:10,261 --> 01:56:11,820
through all that for just the tweak.
Yeah.

2762
01:56:11,821 --> 01:56:14,970
Well your whole fucking eyes into that
shit.

2763
01:56:14,971 --> 01:56:18,150
I want Predator vision.
I want the full meal deal.

2764
01:56:18,660 --> 01:56:20,670
I want to be able to hunt animals in the
darkness.

2765
01:56:21,880 --> 01:56:25,770
Works by binding to ops and proteins in
your retina where it's excited by light

2766
01:56:26,220 --> 01:56:28,500
transformational process to occur in the
protein segment.

2767
01:56:28,890 --> 01:56:30,270
See,
there you go,

2768
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,200
Huh?
Yeah.

2769
01:56:31,740 --> 01:56:34,890
So you could get the blue light blocking
glasses or you could just inject

2770
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,890
everything into your eyes.
Allowed him pick to pick up figures in

2771
01:56:37,891 --> 01:56:40,770
the dark with 100% accuracy.
We're non treated test subjects.

2772
01:56:40,771 --> 01:56:43,560
You'd only make out to about 30% pretty
significant.

2773
01:56:43,590 --> 01:56:45,080
Well that would be really good.
And I liked it.

2774
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:47,970
I liked how the author doesn't know
which percentage signed to use the

2775
01:56:47,971 --> 01:56:50,040
actual percentage sign or the word
percent.

2776
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:52,510
Right.
They got to work on their,

2777
01:56:52,530 --> 01:56:54,090
on their editing.
That's interesting.

2778
01:56:54,091 --> 01:56:57,540
Your writer,
50 meters.

2779
01:56:57,590 --> 01:57:01,350
To go back to that Jamie,
we're talking 50 meters over 160 feet

2780
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:02,250
apart.
Oh Wow.

2781
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:06,140
That's actually really significant.
The following morning his eyes returned

2782
01:57:06,141 --> 01:57:07,710
to normal.
Oh,

2783
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:11,220
I right.
Just say that right there is returned to

2784
01:57:11,221 --> 01:57:13,230
normal and side effects.
Oh Wow.

2785
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,390
So he's not like that.
They're not injecting.

2786
01:57:15,391 --> 01:57:17,220
They're dropping.
They using drops.

2787
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:21,600
So this would be like we were talking
about bow hunting about elk hunting.

2788
01:57:21,630 --> 01:57:23,550
Like,
like when you're in sort of low light,

2789
01:57:24,210 --> 01:57:28,360
that might be the mood,
could pack your speculum into your case,

2790
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:32,280
drop them in there,
make sure that you have a hunting buddy

2791
01:57:32,281 --> 01:57:35,250
who is well versed in the addition of
chlorophyll,

2792
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,830
rubber gloves,
rubber gloves.

2793
01:57:37,860 --> 01:57:41,070
You've got all that stuff to feel dress
anyways and just go to town on your

2794
01:57:41,071 --> 01:57:42,810
eyes.
How did you get into bow hunting?

2795
01:57:43,620 --> 01:57:45,420
Uh,
my buddy,

2796
01:57:45,470 --> 01:57:46,440
uh,
canton,

2797
01:57:46,441 --> 01:57:50,180
Claremont up in Washington state,
he was running these trained to

2798
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:54,930
competitions which are really bad.
I also of course racing with a weapon,

2799
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,950
it's a ton of,
and you could do it out here and like,

2800
01:57:57,050 --> 01:57:59,040
cause you have a,
like you could carry sandbags,

2801
01:57:59,041 --> 01:58:01,410
do like cones and suicides,
prints and all sorts of stuff with this

2802
01:58:01,411 --> 01:58:05,550
technical hunt set up that you have.
But that trying to hunt like uh,

2803
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:07,290
the,
the first competition that I did you,

2804
01:58:07,300 --> 01:58:10,740
you show up and it starts off with like
a four or five hour traditional three d

2805
01:58:10,741 --> 01:58:12,120
shoot.
And for people who don't know what a

2806
01:58:12,121 --> 01:58:13,620
three d shoot is,
it's a bunch of targets,

2807
01:58:13,621 --> 01:58:15,120
you know,
like Reinhardt targets or whatever that

2808
01:58:15,121 --> 01:58:15,900
are set up.

2809
01:58:15,900 --> 01:58:18,260
Well explain that they different
locations to a jetty.

2810
01:58:18,330 --> 01:58:20,790
Look Robert Hill,
they look like animals are going to be a

2811
01:58:20,791 --> 01:58:24,090
fox or an or an elk or you know,
whatever.

2812
01:58:24,091 --> 01:58:24,924
You know,
uh,

2813
01:58:25,070 --> 01:58:28,020
uh,
a bedded animal or a standing animal and

2814
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:31,470
they're spread throughout this course
that you're walking.

2815
01:58:31,471 --> 01:58:33,420
You can think of it almost like golfing,
you know,

2816
01:58:33,421 --> 01:58:36,420
for people who,
who don't bow hunt and you'll,

2817
01:58:36,450 --> 01:58:39,090
you know,
one shot might just be like a simple 25

2818
01:58:39,091 --> 01:58:41,800
yard shot at a Fox where if you get
vitals,

2819
01:58:41,801 --> 01:58:46,030
you'll get the five points.
And if you hit a body shot then it might

2820
01:58:46,031 --> 01:58:50,200
be three points.
And if you miss it's zero.

2821
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,990
And if you get like a wound,
it's actually a negative score.

2822
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:54,160
Right.
Which it should be like,

2823
01:58:54,161 --> 01:58:56,530
it's like a night.
Cause if you wound an animal that's,

2824
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:59,050
that's really much,
much worse than missing an animal.

2825
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:02,200
Right.
So some of the shots are pretty complex.

2826
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:05,170
It might be you got to get off two shots
in 10 seconds,

2827
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:06,670
which is actually kind of hard to do.
You know,

2828
01:59:06,671 --> 01:59:09,610
two shots in 10 seconds and one animals
at 20 and one animals at 40.

2829
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:11,950
All right.
Which is why I use like a three pin side

2830
01:59:11,951 --> 01:59:16,210
on my ball because you don't even have
time to adjust the dial after you've

2831
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:18,610
taken one shot to the yardage for the
second shot.

2832
01:59:19,090 --> 01:59:21,910
Um,
you might have a shot that's like run up

2833
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:24,250
this hill.
There is a target up there.

2834
01:59:24,251 --> 01:59:29,020
We won't tell you the distance,
but you have 30 seconds to make it the

2835
01:59:29,021 --> 01:59:31,840
25 yards up that up,
that goalie.

2836
01:59:31,900 --> 01:59:35,340
And then you're going to have a shot at
the top and you got to run up the goal

2837
01:59:35,341 --> 01:59:38,230
he site and get your shot off in those
30 seconds.

2838
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:38,780
Right?
So,

2839
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,810
so it's not like a traditional three d
shoot.

2840
01:59:40,811 --> 01:59:42,250
It's very active,
you know,

2841
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:46,030
and some shots are,
are you draw lunging and then you stand

2842
01:59:46,031 --> 01:59:48,160
and then you got to walk around the tree
and then take your shots.

2843
01:59:48,161 --> 01:59:50,710
So it's actually pretty fun.
It's way different than just like

2844
01:59:50,711 --> 01:59:55,150
standing out of the range,
shooting a target and you get a certain

2845
01:59:55,151 --> 01:59:57,160
score coming out of that,
right?

2846
01:59:57,161 --> 02:00:01,270
Like you might have a mass x number of
points or or lost x number of points and

2847
02:00:01,271 --> 02:00:03,520
then you go into,
um,

2848
02:00:03,550 --> 02:00:04,650
and they actually,
they,

2849
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:07,510
this year they've kind of like changed
it because a lot of people were like

2850
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:09,760
getting hurt and blowing out their knees
with this next part.

2851
02:00:09,761 --> 02:00:11,290
But you do what's called like a meat
pack,

2852
02:00:11,650 --> 02:00:15,370
which is a hundred pounds in your pack
and it's two to four mile course that

2853
02:00:15,371 --> 02:00:17,410
you got to boogie across as fast as
possible.

2854
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:20,650
People were running.
And the problem with it was people like

2855
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:23,560
when you pack out,
like you're taking it on time,

2856
02:00:23,561 --> 02:00:26,290
you're not running,
you're not like racing your buddy but

2857
02:00:26,320 --> 02:00:28,330
this,
and it was like the most painful thing

2858
02:00:28,331 --> 02:00:32,050
of really ever done in terms of like how
high my heart rate got and the amount of

2859
02:00:32,051 --> 02:00:34,520
lactic acid.
Like just try to go two miles fast.

2860
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,860
You can with a hundred pounds in your
pack.

2861
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:39,250
Sounds very not only you've got to spend
like I would spend copious amounts of

2862
02:00:39,251 --> 02:00:41,950
times like making sure the pack was
adjusted properly and I'll put like the

2863
02:00:41,951 --> 02:00:44,620
bubble wrap in the bottom of the pack.
So it moves the weight that you're

2864
02:00:44,621 --> 02:00:46,930
using,
which are typically sandbags up to the

2865
02:00:46,931 --> 02:00:50,200
center of the pack.
And I worked with this company called

2866
02:00:50,770 --> 02:00:55,770
[inaudible] that makes like these facts.
Yeah they make a jump back Aaron.

2867
02:00:56,170 --> 02:00:58,900
Um exactly.
And you know he did some skype sessions

2868
02:00:58,901 --> 02:01:02,170
with me where he taught me exactly cause
you don't set it up the way that you

2869
02:01:02,171 --> 02:01:03,820
would if you were just going to pack out
in animal,

2870
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:06,700
you have to put it super duper tight up
in the shoulder so it's not bouncing

2871
02:01:06,701 --> 02:01:08,590
around.
And then you put the weight down in the

2872
02:01:08,591 --> 02:01:11,500
hips.
So it works for running two miles really

2873
02:01:11,501 --> 02:01:13,750
hard.
But it's super uncomfortable and it's

2874
02:01:13,751 --> 02:01:17,650
not biomechanically favorable sucks but
it's good to have it running.

2875
02:01:17,830 --> 02:01:20,800
Yeah.
So they call that the meat pack right.

2876
02:01:20,980 --> 02:01:24,310
And have to do it that way or is it just
a matter of how much weight you have on

2877
02:01:24,311 --> 02:01:26,620
your back?
Like if you could use one of those atlas

2878
02:01:26,621 --> 02:01:28,750
packs,
have you seen those atlas things from

2879
02:01:28,780 --> 02:01:33,760
outdoors means it's essentially it's a
pack frame with a traditional Olympic

2880
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:36,280
boats on the end of it where you put the
plates on it.

2881
02:01:36,460 --> 02:01:39,890
What are those things called and then
the end of a weight bar or the white

2882
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,840
wait slide on them.
What would you call that?

2883
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:43,740
The end of a weight borrower.
The weights.

2884
02:01:43,850 --> 02:01:45,320
Like a barbell?
Yeah,

2885
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:48,410
the end of the bar bar around the end of
the bar.

2886
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:50,900
Well they have one of those I post,
I guess you've got to post.

2887
02:01:50,901 --> 02:01:51,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

2888
02:01:51,800 --> 02:01:53,690
They have one of those.
It's hanging out in the back.

2889
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:56,090
See if you can find it.
It's called the atlas trainer Jamie

2890
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:58,290
outdoorsman.
[inaudible] dot com um,

2891
02:01:59,310 --> 02:02:02,150
as a PAC.
It's PAC frame with a,

2892
02:02:02,151 --> 02:02:04,910
I hiked with it on this.
Is it a picture?

2893
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:06,490
It's pretty dope.
Whoa.

2894
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:07,833
Okay.
Yeah,

2895
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:08,783
yeah,
yeah.

2896
02:02:11,550 --> 02:02:13,820
Cool.
You could use whatever you want as long

2897
02:02:13,821 --> 02:02:14,680
as,
as long as you have waiting it.

2898
02:02:14,681 --> 02:02:16,700
You just have to figure out how to,
cause everybody has to use a standard

2899
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:19,100
weight so you have to use the sandbag
that they issue to you.

2900
02:02:20,190 --> 02:02:24,530
Your use the same object that so
everybody's using a sand bag just so you

2901
02:02:24,531 --> 02:02:29,531
don't come in with your own weight.
I was just saying if he did that that

2902
02:02:29,610 --> 02:02:33,000
you like that you painted a 45 pound
logo on um,

2903
02:02:33,590 --> 02:02:36,530
anyways though she didn't meet,
pack in and he gives her amount of time

2904
02:02:36,531 --> 02:02:38,090
for that.
And then you do the obstacle course

2905
02:02:38,091 --> 02:02:39,890
which is the real hoot and which they
still do,

2906
02:02:39,920 --> 02:02:42,050
which is cause I think got rid of the
meat pack.

2907
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:45,680
But the obstacle courses me pack it.
Well it's not,

2908
02:02:45,710 --> 02:02:46,820
it doesn't make sense,
right?

2909
02:02:46,821 --> 02:02:49,310
Like they designed this whole
competition to simulate hunting,

2910
02:02:49,311 --> 02:02:53,930
to prepare a hunter to hunt and to train
a hundred a hundred properly and it just

2911
02:02:53,931 --> 02:02:55,940
flew in the face of everything that is
hunting,

2912
02:02:55,941 --> 02:02:59,690
which is jacked up nervous system,
you know,

2913
02:02:59,691 --> 02:03:02,510
rushing through the woods with a giant
package.

2914
02:03:02,540 --> 02:03:05,480
You just,
you don't pack out an animal like that.

2915
02:03:05,950 --> 02:03:08,330
Then they'd have to figure out a way to
put like a speed limiter on like,

2916
02:03:08,390 --> 02:03:09,710
Oh hey,
you're not allowed to run.

2917
02:03:10,210 --> 02:03:13,050
So you guys got there.
What makes sense?

2918
02:03:13,490 --> 02:03:14,930
But people were getting hurt and it just
didn't,

2919
02:03:14,980 --> 02:03:17,270
didn't make sense.
I'd be jacked up my back and like it,

2920
02:03:17,660 --> 02:03:19,520
it's cool.
Like I get it.

2921
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:21,920
I kind of wish they still had it because
I was good at that part.

2922
02:03:21,950 --> 02:03:24,440
Cause like I'm going to doors halfway
and I'm kind of strong so for,

2923
02:03:24,441 --> 02:03:26,640
so for me it worked out pretty well.
Uh,

2924
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:30,470
and then they have the obstacle course,
which is like crawling under barb wire

2925
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:33,080
stand shoot.
And then you're doing like,

2926
02:03:33,140 --> 02:03:35,180
um,
you know like sand bag over the

2927
02:03:35,181 --> 02:03:38,330
shoulder,
20 reps shoot 30 burpees and for the

2928
02:03:38,331 --> 02:03:41,480
obstacle course you have a 50 pound pack
or a 40 pound pack on your back.

2929
02:03:41,690 --> 02:03:44,600
They kind of adjust the pack weight
based off which division that you're in.

2930
02:03:44,601 --> 02:03:47,140
But so you're using a smaller packs.
So I use the kefauver packet.

2931
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:48,920
They again,
they just had like a smaller pack.

2932
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,370
Same thing.
You've got to sand bag.

2933
02:03:50,371 --> 02:03:52,850
It was a lighter sandbag.
So you carrying that through the whole

2934
02:03:52,851 --> 02:03:54,680
course,
but you're stopping and shooting along

2935
02:03:54,681 --> 02:03:55,850
the way.
So it's like you're,

2936
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:59,600
you're learning how to,
just imagine if you,

2937
02:03:59,630 --> 02:04:02,900
if you were like rushing up a hill and
we got to the top of the hill and he got

2938
02:04:02,901 --> 02:04:05,420
to calm your heart way,
call him your nervous system very

2939
02:04:05,421 --> 02:04:07,970
quickly and get your shot off.
And granted,

2940
02:04:08,090 --> 02:04:11,360
you're not necessarily going to be hall
on a sandbag up that hill and doing a

2941
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:14,660
bunch of burpees,
but it's kind of simulating that of

2942
02:04:14,661 --> 02:04:17,150
shooting with your heart rate elevated.
Um,

2943
02:04:17,320 --> 02:04:18,860
and it's,
it's a hard course.

2944
02:04:18,860 --> 02:04:21,980
I mean like there are like legitimate,
you know,

2945
02:04:21,981 --> 02:04:24,890
hardcore crossfitters and athletes that
do this,

2946
02:04:24,891 --> 02:04:28,010
but it's a combination of being able to
shoot well and being able to,

2947
02:04:28,070 --> 02:04:29,210
to fitness.
Well,

2948
02:04:29,211 --> 02:04:30,930
that's the interesting thing about
bowhunting,

2949
02:04:30,980 --> 02:04:33,080
is it bow hunting really does require
fitness.

2950
02:04:33,110 --> 02:04:35,630
Well when I did that high country,
yeah,

2951
02:04:35,730 --> 02:04:37,700
I was,
I was wearing this,

2952
02:04:37,800 --> 02:04:41,640
this ring we were talking about when did
the hunt in Hawaii and I did it like 46

2953
02:04:41,641 --> 02:04:46,170
miles over the course of five days,
just like crawling and walking and

2954
02:04:46,171 --> 02:04:48,120
hiking and sprinting.
I mean that's,

2955
02:04:48,121 --> 02:04:53,040
that's why I like bow hunting is it's
the challenge and the uh,

2956
02:04:53,041 --> 02:04:54,460
the train to hunt Guy,
uh,

2957
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:56,880
Kenton,
he told me about these competitions and

2958
02:04:56,881 --> 02:04:59,280
I was watching them and I'm like,
I really want to try this.

2959
02:04:59,281 --> 02:05:01,650
Cause at that point I'd firearms hunted
for two years.

2960
02:05:01,680 --> 02:05:02,610
I didn't grow up hunting.

2961
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:07,050
I grew up homeschooled playing chess and
playing the violin,

2962
02:05:07,270 --> 02:05:10,110
reading books and playing world of
warcraft.

2963
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:10,973
Like I,
I was,

2964
02:05:11,190 --> 02:05:14,070
I was not like a hunter kid growing up
and neither of my parents,

2965
02:05:14,071 --> 02:05:15,750
right.
Like we'd occasionally go fishing for

2966
02:05:15,751 --> 02:05:18,120
trout and that was about it in the,
in the stock pond.

2967
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:22,020
So hunting when it was new for me,
I'd been hunting for two years.

2968
02:05:22,740 --> 02:05:25,350
Totally self taught.
Like I feel dressed my first animal with

2969
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:29,400
the little youtube video on the iphone.
You following along?

2970
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:32,700
I've got my knife and I'm watching the
video because that's the way I was being

2971
02:05:32,701 --> 02:05:33,360
homeschooled.
Right?

2972
02:05:33,360 --> 02:05:36,570
Like I like to teach myself things.
I just grew up as a very independent

2973
02:05:36,571 --> 02:05:39,300
learner so I'll,
all of my hunting was salt type benefit.

2974
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:40,260
Yeah.
It,

2975
02:05:40,740 --> 02:05:43,560
there's,
there are drawbacks to being very

2976
02:05:43,561 --> 02:05:45,690
resistant to learning from others or
having mentors.

2977
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:48,630
I think that you also don't play well
with others.

2978
02:05:48,631 --> 02:05:49,640
Right?
Like I grew up as it,

2979
02:05:49,650 --> 02:05:53,340
when I got to college I was very poor.
Like the team activities you did weren't

2980
02:05:53,341 --> 02:05:57,420
socialized very good at creating at
leading edge,

2981
02:05:57,421 --> 02:05:59,640
thinking outside the box at,
at,

2982
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:00,570
you know,
kind of,

2983
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:02,780
kind of being a lot more independent
rather.

2984
02:06:02,790 --> 02:06:05,520
That's fascinating cause that's what
we're doing.

2985
02:06:05,770 --> 02:06:08,280
That's what you did is what I wound up
doing.

2986
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:13,140
And also I read a copious amount.
I wrote a copious amount and that's

2987
02:06:13,141 --> 02:06:16,410
still what I do because that's what I,
that's what I kind of grew up doing.

2988
02:06:16,411 --> 02:06:17,740
Homeschooled.
Uh,

2989
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:20,250
and it was really tennis that got me
into fitness.

2990
02:06:20,280 --> 02:06:23,970
Like I played tennis in college and I
got big into tennis in high school and

2991
02:06:23,971 --> 02:06:25,980
in,
in Idaho where I was at the time,

2992
02:06:25,981 --> 02:06:29,220
there is a rule that homeschooled kids
could play sports at the local public

2993
02:06:29,221 --> 02:06:29,880
school.

2994
02:06:29,880 --> 02:06:31,950
So I played tennis and that really got
me into sports.

2995
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:35,300
And then I studied exercise physiology
and biomechanics in college and,

2996
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:37,260
and here I am,
but this,

2997
02:06:37,261 --> 02:06:41,790
I'm like going from being homeschooled
to hanging out with public school kids.

2998
02:06:43,110 --> 02:06:46,440
Really Awkward.
Like I because you're not,

2999
02:06:46,650 --> 02:06:48,960
you're not in class with them,
you're not at the prom,

3000
02:06:48,961 --> 02:06:50,820
you're not,
you're not doing any of the social

3001
02:06:50,821 --> 02:06:52,470
things that they're doing.
But then you might show up at like,

3002
02:06:52,500 --> 02:06:54,240
you know,
tennis practice or whatever and same

3003
02:06:54,241 --> 02:06:56,040
thing we get to college.
You're just not used to,

3004
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:58,410
I mean like do,
I went off the deep end in college

3005
02:06:58,411 --> 02:07:01,350
because I graduated,
I was 15 and I didn't do like a gap year

3006
02:07:01,351 --> 02:07:01,981
or anything,
right?

3007
02:07:01,981 --> 02:07:06,870
Like I just started college when I was
16 and I did not have good self control

3008
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:11,880
around sex and alcohol and drugs and all
these things that all of a sudden I was

3009
02:07:11,881 --> 02:07:13,410
immersed in in college.

3010
02:07:13,410 --> 02:07:15,210
So no one was there to tell,
you know?

3011
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:18,900
Yeah.
The way I raised my kids is they,

3012
02:07:18,990 --> 02:07:20,070
for example,
there are,

3013
02:07:20,100 --> 02:07:22,350
there are really no rules in our house,
right?

3014
02:07:22,351 --> 02:07:25,980
Like they can try Ramin Scotch and
whiskey and they can take a hit off the

3015
02:07:25,981 --> 02:07:27,900
vape pen that they can,
they're nine.

3016
02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:33,290
But they also have been educated about
what that might do to their liver or to

3017
02:07:33,991 --> 02:07:36,820
the gray matter in their,
or we don't say no gluten.

3018
02:07:36,821 --> 02:07:38,830
I tell them you'll gluten is gonna
affect your test stores.

3019
02:07:38,831 --> 02:07:42,340
Cores creates neural inflammation,
can create some gastric inflammation.

3020
02:07:42,550 --> 02:07:44,500
You get to choose when you go to the
birthday party,

3021
02:07:44,501 --> 02:07:46,870
whether you're going to have the gluten.
And sometimes it comes back to bite me

3022
02:07:46,871 --> 02:07:49,540
because we'll go out to a restaurant and
they'll bring the bread out to the

3023
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:50,620
restaurant and they boys would be like,
no,

3024
02:07:50,621 --> 02:07:51,460
no,
we don't want the,

3025
02:07:51,490 --> 02:07:52,180
we don't want the bread.

3026
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:54,940
And I'm like,
but I kind of wanted a little kind of

3027
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:59,740
did on my little piece of bread here.
So that I think that's a better way to

3028
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:00,521
raise a child.
Right?

3029
02:08:00,521 --> 02:08:04,540
You educate them about the consequences
of their decision and then you let them

3030
02:08:04,541 --> 02:08:07,660
make the decision themselves.
You equip them rather than creating a

3031
02:08:07,661 --> 02:08:09,820
bunch of forbidden fruit,
which is the way that I was kind of

3032
02:08:09,821 --> 02:08:11,650
raised Riley.
So,

3033
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,360
so yeah,
it was a little tricky,

3034
02:08:13,361 --> 02:08:15,010
the whole college thing.
Um,

3035
02:08:15,220 --> 02:08:17,740
but uh,
back to back to bow hunting,

3036
02:08:17,770 --> 02:08:21,250
it was this train hunting and Kenton
came up to my house and I asked him

3037
02:08:21,251 --> 02:08:22,510
about like kind of like the spear
fishing.

3038
02:08:22,511 --> 02:08:23,770
Like what's,
what's the ball?

3039
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:26,470
What release do I get?
What areas do I get?

3040
02:08:26,471 --> 02:08:28,250
How would I do this?
I went to the,

3041
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,790
my local boat shop.
I took some lessons in shooting.

3042
02:08:31,180 --> 02:08:33,130
Um,
and then I,

3043
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:34,900
my first hunt,
uh,

3044
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:38,710
what was my first hunt side from my
property,

3045
02:08:38,740 --> 02:08:40,850
cause I'm on 10 acres,
maybe like a copious amount of white

3046
02:08:40,851 --> 02:08:42,450
tail.
So I shot my first animal out there.

3047
02:08:42,480 --> 02:08:44,800
My first major hunt was high country,
Colorado.

3048
02:08:44,830 --> 02:08:46,930
We did like a horseback hunt with a
guide there,

3049
02:08:47,390 --> 02:08:49,030
you know,
and that got me hooked.

3050
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:54,060
If this was a,
this was elk came back after seven days

3051
02:08:54,131 --> 02:08:55,780
with nothing.
That was my very first time.

3052
02:08:56,230 --> 02:08:58,420
So,
and then my first actual kill I hunted

3053
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,820
access stare down in Texas.
Amazing.

3054
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,580
Amazing.
Texas is crazy.

3055
02:09:02,581 --> 02:09:04,270
And it tests the,
I was telling you that have like fricken

3056
02:09:04,271 --> 02:09:07,000
zebra as you can look down there.
I know they have everything.

3057
02:09:07,060 --> 02:09:10,660
Yeah.
The came back and Neil Guy and African

3058
02:09:10,661 --> 02:09:14,740
animals and my wife bought us a sausage
maker and me and my boys made made

3059
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:18,130
access deer sausage and the backdrop and
it was amazing.

3060
02:09:18,130 --> 02:09:19,480
And now,
now they're little,

3061
02:09:19,510 --> 02:09:21,960
they're little chef's dude like they uh,
that's cool.

3062
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:26,170
They made like bone broth click made
baked donuts out of breadfruit flour and

3063
02:09:26,171 --> 02:09:29,710
they use bone broth and claustrum and
they made like a cream cheese ginger

3064
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:34,390
frosting and a dark chocolate cow
frosting and it actually tastes like

3065
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:36,910
real donuts.
What was this from a recipe?

3066
02:09:37,050 --> 02:09:37,930
Yeah,
from a restaurant.

3067
02:09:37,931 --> 02:09:42,931
They had like don't have you baking them
colossal doughnut recipe.

3068
02:09:43,241 --> 02:09:45,370
We've made it up.
Yeah.

3069
02:09:45,371 --> 02:09:47,830
And they use breadfruit flour forever.
They did a,

3070
02:09:47,860 --> 02:09:50,590
they do pad Thai,
but they use those Shirataki noodles I

3071
02:09:50,591 --> 02:09:54,280
was talking about.
And they use organic roasted crickets

3072
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:57,640
like instead of shrimp or chicken.
And the crickets actually tastes really

3073
02:09:57,641 --> 02:09:58,474
good.
They'll like,

3074
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,160
yeah,
they're not raising the crickets.

3075
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:04,450
They're not,
uh,

3076
02:10:04,780 --> 02:10:07,120
I think it's called [inaudible] is the
company that they get the crate and

3077
02:10:07,121 --> 02:10:07,720
they're really good.

3078
02:10:07,720 --> 02:10:09,460
They like send you,
these little kids are good man.

3079
02:10:09,490 --> 02:10:10,301
Thanks.
Crickets.

3080
02:10:10,301 --> 02:10:13,020
Yeah.
And they're doing like in Mexico Zilcho

3081
02:10:13,050 --> 02:10:15,490
and yeah.
Crickets or they're actually really

3082
02:10:15,491 --> 02:10:16,510
tasty.
Yeah.

3083
02:10:16,600 --> 02:10:19,330
It was a place to go to Mexico and they
give them to like,

3084
02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:22,810
it's a little appetizers and leaving
your room go to this resort early.

3085
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:23,380
Yeah.
They look,

3086
02:10:23,380 --> 02:10:26,320
it's like a fried cricket.
It's an appetizer.

3087
02:10:26,321 --> 02:10:28,330
It's like,
it's like the resorts you go to with the

3088
02:10:28,331 --> 02:10:30,980
apples and the mango covered and the
cell on the thing,

3089
02:10:30,981 --> 02:10:32,650
but instead it's crickets.
But they have that,

3090
02:10:33,230 --> 02:10:35,480
they have crickets to wow.
And they,

3091
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:38,720
it's very tasty.
They're dark and they're somehow or

3092
02:10:38,721 --> 02:10:40,240
another cooked,
I don't know what their seasons

3093
02:10:40,250 --> 02:10:43,010
stainable mineral rich source of
protein.

3094
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:43,821
Yeah.
Yeah.

3095
02:10:43,821 --> 02:10:46,640
And I don't see the thing about most
people that are like,

3096
02:10:46,641 --> 02:10:50,210
they don't want animals to die.
They don't usually give a shit about

3097
02:10:50,211 --> 02:10:51,044
bugs.

3098
02:10:51,280 --> 02:10:51,910
Yeah.
Yeah.

3099
02:10:51,910 --> 02:10:53,930
Dot.
A lot of people find like a June bug.

3100
02:10:53,931 --> 02:10:56,170
Super Cute and cry when it,
when it gets killed.

3101
02:10:56,180 --> 02:10:59,390
Miskino vegans just slap mosquitoes are
on their arms.

3102
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:01,190
Yeah.
I read a study this morning of gene

3103
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:02,720
editing mosquitoes now.
Yeah.

3104
02:11:02,730 --> 02:11:05,690
You're using crispr technologies to make
the mosquitoes less likely to bite you.

3105
02:11:05,810 --> 02:11:06,860
I saw that.
Crazy.

3106
02:11:06,861 --> 02:11:08,050
Yeah.
It's very bizarre.

3107
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:09,020
Yeah.
And if you,

3108
02:11:09,021 --> 02:11:12,830
there was a little cool little anecdote
from that study to where they found that

3109
02:11:12,831 --> 02:11:16,340
mosquito is actually have like a,
like they learn if you swat at the

3110
02:11:16,341 --> 02:11:18,620
mosquito,
it actually learns to avoid you.

3111
02:11:19,190 --> 02:11:20,900
And so if,
if you,

3112
02:11:20,901 --> 02:11:23,030
you know,
normally I just like put some on my skin

3113
02:11:23,031 --> 02:11:25,970
like cinnamon essential oil or something
that drives a mosquito away.

3114
02:11:25,990 --> 02:11:26,960
Does that work?
But yeah,

3115
02:11:26,961 --> 02:11:27,794
it does.
And you,

3116
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:28,800
you,
you want to,

3117
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,680
you want to dilute it because it's like
a very,

3118
02:11:30,681 --> 02:11:34,250
it's a burning oil,
but cinnamon works amazingly if you ever

3119
02:11:34,251 --> 02:11:34,580
tried it.

3120
02:11:34,580 --> 02:11:37,870
And like Alaska where they have like
really aggressive mosquitoes around.

3121
02:11:37,910 --> 02:11:40,850
I don't know why we're where there's a
lot of mosquitoes,

3122
02:11:41,310 --> 02:11:43,520
different animal and work for me.
But then the Alaska,

3123
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:45,210
no,
that's on my bucket.

3124
02:11:45,211 --> 02:11:48,680
Ours and they swarm you like a pack of
Zhan.

3125
02:11:48,681 --> 02:11:52,460
Laska doesn't seem like a place I would
envision having these like special snow.

3126
02:11:52,610 --> 02:11:54,500
No,
live very long.

3127
02:11:54,501 --> 02:11:56,470
So they're incredibly aggressive.
Hmm.

3128
02:11:56,630 --> 02:11:59,000
I mean I'm telling you,
it's the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

3129
02:11:59,001 --> 02:12:02,180
We went salmon fishing there,
me and my friend Ari and we opened up

3130
02:12:02,181 --> 02:12:05,390
the car door to get out and the time it
take to open the car door,

3131
02:12:05,810 --> 02:12:08,120
a swarm of mosquitoes was inside of the
car.

3132
02:12:08,121 --> 02:12:11,210
And I'm not exaggerating.
Several hundred mosquitoes like goodness

3133
02:12:11,211 --> 02:12:12,830
show.
That sounds like that video that you

3134
02:12:12,831 --> 02:12:15,830
pulled up once we were talking about
this with the clouds of mosquitoes in

3135
02:12:15,831 --> 02:12:16,640
Alaska.

3136
02:12:16,640 --> 02:12:18,720
Fucking crazy.
Sounds like the graph.

3137
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:20,300
Like when I grew up,
I grew up in Lewiston,

3138
02:12:20,301 --> 02:12:23,120
Idaho and we would get these grasshopper
infestations.

3139
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:24,860
They like each year.
Yeah.

3140
02:12:24,861 --> 02:12:27,230
Locus.
And they apparently they plant their

3141
02:12:27,260 --> 02:12:30,920
eggs in the ground and then like in the
spring or the summer they hatch.

3142
02:12:31,470 --> 02:12:33,110
Yeah.
That's mosquitoes and Alaska.

3143
02:12:33,370 --> 02:12:34,460
Wow.
Dude,

3144
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:35,900
I'm telling you.
It's the cray.

3145
02:12:35,901 --> 02:12:40,901
What's a fucking burned by mosquitoes?
It already getting jammed.

3146
02:12:41,901 --> 02:12:44,810
My goodness dude.
I'm telling you I'd never seen anything

3147
02:12:44,811 --> 02:12:48,110
like it and we were covered with ddt and
all that shit.

3148
02:12:48,111 --> 02:12:51,110
But yeah,
the terrible the deet.

3149
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:53,030
Do you know about Therma sells their
sticks?

3150
02:12:53,630 --> 02:12:54,650
I do now.
I think,

3151
02:12:54,651 --> 02:12:55,670
uh,
I,

3152
02:12:55,671 --> 02:12:57,210
uh,
I've been using them cause my,

3153
02:12:57,230 --> 02:12:59,180
my kid's camp outside sometimes,
you know,

3154
02:12:59,181 --> 02:12:59,991
in the,
in the forest.

3155
02:12:59,991 --> 02:13:02,750
And I said to one of those little
thermacell things in front of their,

3156
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:04,003
they're amazing.

3157
02:13:05,950 --> 02:13:07,220
Yeah.
Wow.

3158
02:13:07,790 --> 02:13:11,270
Is that why you're the first like that?
I have no idea that Caribou uh,

3159
02:13:11,271 --> 02:13:13,310
yeah,
the grasshoppers at our house and loosed

3160
02:13:13,311 --> 02:13:16,190
and we would actually go sell them to
pet stores.

3161
02:13:16,191 --> 02:13:18,830
Like that's how we make money in the
summers because it'd be so many of them.

3162
02:13:18,831 --> 02:13:20,810
Me and my brothers would walk around
with cages.

3163
02:13:21,200 --> 02:13:22,850
She's grasshoppers and bringing a pet
stores,

3164
02:13:22,851 --> 02:13:24,830
we'll use them for like tarantulas and
stuff like that.

3165
02:13:25,070 --> 02:13:27,590
And then this army guy who was in the
military came to her house and he showed

3166
02:13:27,591 --> 02:13:30,440
us how they eat grasshoppers.
So we started eating grass hoppers and

3167
02:13:30,441 --> 02:13:31,850
we like it everything,
right?

3168
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:35,370
Like we'd microwave grasshopper,
just figure out every way to kill a

3169
02:13:35,371 --> 02:13:38,070
grass hopper.
And the way that we got rid of him was

3170
02:13:38,071 --> 02:13:42,320
we introduced praying mantis and chicken
to our property and both of those mother

3171
02:13:42,321 --> 02:13:44,520
fuckers a,
a bunch of chickens.

3172
02:13:44,520 --> 02:13:47,150
And then we have chickens at our
property up in spokane now too,

3173
02:13:47,210 --> 02:13:48,620
which I have a chicken.
Eggs.

3174
02:13:48,650 --> 02:13:50,280
Yeah,
Icelandic chickens.

3175
02:13:50,281 --> 02:13:51,480
They're very,
very hardy.

3176
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:52,363
Oh,
the winter.

3177
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:56,820
And then the goats that we have,
our Nigerian dwarf goats and Nigerian

3178
02:13:56,821 --> 02:13:59,860
dwarf goats.
They're very small goat and they produce

3179
02:13:59,861 --> 02:14:04,620
a lot of milk for their actual size.
And they're very hardy in the winter and

3180
02:14:04,621 --> 02:14:08,430
they're small and they're cute.
And we haven't milked them yet because

3181
02:14:08,460 --> 02:14:11,850
they need to be a,
that they have to be pregnant to produce

3182
02:14:11,851 --> 02:14:14,910
the milk.
And we've had some issues with like the

3183
02:14:14,911 --> 02:14:16,530
baby's dying and they'll be like,
we're,

3184
02:14:16,531 --> 02:14:18,300
we're,
we're learning our goat game.

3185
02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:21,180
However,
we did have to tie rubber bands around a

3186
02:14:21,181 --> 02:14:24,120
bunch of their testicles recently to,
to newt or some of the males.

3187
02:14:24,121 --> 02:14:25,650
Once you get them in front of that light
training,

3188
02:14:25,651 --> 02:14:27,390
we're training the males to be pat
goats.

3189
02:14:27,410 --> 02:14:28,870
Yeah.
Or Him.

3190
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:30,750
So you're killing their balls with
rubber bands.

3191
02:14:30,751 --> 02:14:31,800
Right,
exactly.

3192
02:14:32,520 --> 02:14:33,960
It's dude.
Very,

3193
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:36,500
very you guys.
Oh they're adorable.

3194
02:14:36,780 --> 02:14:39,780
There's a little Nigerian dwarf goats
and we have like little tires,

3195
02:14:40,350 --> 02:14:43,340
little tires that they play on.
Their seeds are kids.

3196
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:45,030
My kids love it,
but over each other.

3197
02:14:45,060 --> 02:14:49,410
They named him after candy bars,
like Mnm and caramel and Milky Way and

3198
02:14:49,430 --> 02:14:52,740
toffee.
Did you buy them just for pets or did

3199
02:14:52,741 --> 02:14:54,990
you buy it?
We have a lot them originally for milk

3200
02:14:55,020 --> 02:14:55,980
cause you know,
goat milk,

3201
02:14:55,981 --> 02:14:57,020
it's very,
you know,

3202
02:14:57,060 --> 02:15:00,000
the protein is smaller.
It's very thermodynamically,

3203
02:15:00,030 --> 02:15:02,310
uh,
compatible with the hidden by apparently

3204
02:15:02,311 --> 02:15:05,970
the only one that's better as camel milk
really was a company out of California.

3205
02:15:05,971 --> 02:15:08,370
It was sending me camels,
smoked in my house for awhile and

3206
02:15:08,371 --> 02:15:10,500
apparently it's super duper healthy for
you.

3207
02:15:10,501 --> 02:15:12,660
And it's,
and the protein is smaller,

3208
02:15:12,700 --> 02:15:15,420
more absorbable and,
and it's less hypoallergenic.

3209
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:17,400
And friendly to your immune system?
Well,

3210
02:15:17,401 --> 02:15:22,170
when my daughter was young she could not
digest actual cow milk.

3211
02:15:22,200 --> 02:15:25,260
It just really didn't agree with her.
But goat milk was fine.

3212
02:15:25,810 --> 02:15:27,900
It's one of those we found an I started
drinking goat milk.

3213
02:15:27,930 --> 02:15:29,880
I just,
it just tastes better.

3214
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:32,940
You know what I like is the colostrum
your reuse colostrum.

3215
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:35,060
Oh Jamie shows basically just like
playing,

3216
02:15:35,230 --> 02:15:38,760
what is this goat yoga?
People do yoga with goats.

3217
02:15:38,820 --> 02:15:43,820
They apparently find it relaxing.
I would get so big you can do a down dog

3218
02:15:44,491 --> 02:15:47,380
and he got like a cloven hooves and
you're under cervical.

3219
02:15:48,330 --> 02:15:50,130
It's,
it's really popular.

3220
02:15:50,131 --> 02:15:52,590
Matt.
I think I would get a kick out of that.

3221
02:15:53,150 --> 02:15:54,530
Distract you.
Look at the,

3222
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,130
let's let people,
yeah,

3223
02:15:58,170 --> 02:16:00,720
this looks like something people who
have never been on a farm would do.

3224
02:16:00,721 --> 02:16:03,650
They're like goats yoga.
Yeah,

3225
02:16:03,810 --> 02:16:04,890
exactly.
Yeah.

3226
02:16:04,891 --> 02:16:08,790
Like you walk out of starbucks
Frappuccino and they go sit with the

3227
02:16:08,791 --> 02:16:09,480
goats.

3228
02:16:09,480 --> 02:16:12,720
Exactly.
The great system out there though.

3229
02:16:12,721 --> 02:16:16,230
It sounds awesome.
Wild animals out there.

3230
02:16:16,690 --> 02:16:18,300
Good set up.
And then I have an obstacle.

3231
02:16:18,301 --> 02:16:21,300
I built an obstacle course cause I do
all this obstacle course race and you

3232
02:16:21,301 --> 02:16:24,120
know what's cool is you can take all
these little little bow targets and you

3233
02:16:24,121 --> 02:16:26,630
set them up around the obstacle course.
So you'll like climbing the rope and

3234
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:30,970
come down and then you shoot your bow
and then even do practice like standing

3235
02:16:30,971 --> 02:16:34,450
still though and working on your form
and doing that as well.

3236
02:16:34,451 --> 02:16:35,950
We got tired.
Yeah,

3237
02:16:36,010 --> 02:16:37,090
exactly.
It's,

3238
02:16:37,110 --> 02:16:39,310
it's meditative.
I would like to have John's very

3239
02:16:39,311 --> 02:16:42,550
relaxed,
ugly sit down with you and go over this

3240
02:16:42,551 --> 02:16:45,040
idea cause you also trigger,
shoot,

3241
02:16:45,100 --> 02:16:48,340
you're not,
you're not using a surprise release.

3242
02:16:48,850 --> 02:16:52,420
I haven't.
I took one class at my boat shop on

3243
02:16:52,421 --> 02:16:55,480
surprise release and I like it and I get
it.

3244
02:16:55,510 --> 02:16:59,230
And frankly I feel like there's a lot
less strain in the shoulder when you

3245
02:16:59,231 --> 02:17:01,560
pull back because for a while I was
getting like some of the show,

3246
02:17:01,561 --> 02:17:04,300
like some of the brachialis issues from,
from pulling back.

3247
02:17:04,301 --> 02:17:07,650
Why would it be different?
You know how when you do a lat pull down

3248
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:10,570
and if you grip thumbs off,
used more of the latter.

3249
02:17:10,690 --> 02:17:13,450
If you grip thumbs on,
you use more the more the biceps and the

3250
02:17:13,451 --> 02:17:14,410
forearm muscles.
Right.

3251
02:17:14,470 --> 02:17:17,440
I felt like it was similar to that.
I felt like with the,

3252
02:17:17,470 --> 02:17:20,650
with the surprise release,
I was using more of my back and less

3253
02:17:20,651 --> 02:17:22,750
than my forearm and biceps.
I don't know if there's something to

3254
02:17:22,751 --> 02:17:24,490
that,
but it doesn't make any sense because

3255
02:17:24,491 --> 02:17:27,370
the draw is exactly the same way.
The only difference is to release.

3256
02:17:27,710 --> 02:17:28,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

3257
02:17:28,510 --> 02:17:31,450
It felt a lot different.
The thing about archery is it's like

3258
02:17:31,451 --> 02:17:34,360
martial arts in that if you learn the
wrong way,

3259
02:17:34,361 --> 02:17:36,010
it's very difficult to unlearn.

3260
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:40,300
Like when I was teaching martial arts,
it was way better to get someone who is

3261
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,030
open minded,
who had never had any martial arts

3262
02:17:43,031 --> 02:17:47,530
experience versus someone who had many,
many years in a shitty martial art

3263
02:17:48,070 --> 02:17:51,550
because those people had these deeply
ingrained pathways that were,

3264
02:17:51,551 --> 02:17:55,120
whenever the shit we get weird or they
would get uncomfortable or that it gets

3265
02:17:55,450 --> 02:17:57,040
nervous,
they would go back to their old

3266
02:17:57,041 --> 02:17:57,874
technique.
Yeah.

3267
02:17:58,110 --> 02:17:59,320
Yeah,
it makes sense.

3268
02:17:59,350 --> 02:18:01,150
Yeah.
Treats.

3269
02:18:01,810 --> 02:18:02,980
It's very dirty.
There's,

3270
02:18:03,280 --> 02:18:07,690
there's also a series of a
instructionals that can show you,

3271
02:18:07,691 --> 02:18:10,660
um,
about a surprise at least is that John

3272
02:18:10,660 --> 02:18:14,020
Dudley's done put online and there's a
guy named Joel Turner that has this

3273
02:18:14,021 --> 02:18:19,021
whole dedicated thing to avoiding target
panic and a high pressure situations is

3274
02:18:20,170 --> 02:18:22,540
he's got a website,
it used to be called iron mind hunting,

3275
02:18:22,541 --> 02:18:26,010
but now he calls it shot Iq I think is
an iron mind.

3276
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:29,590
The people to sell the captains of crush
hand grip strengtheners I think that's

3277
02:18:29,591 --> 02:18:31,630
another,
another company.

3278
02:18:31,631 --> 02:18:33,160
But I love those guys.
I have,

3279
02:18:33,161 --> 02:18:36,250
I have a bunch of travel with them.
Those up 197 pounds,

3280
02:18:36,490 --> 02:18:37,080
I don't know,
mine,

3281
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:39,400
I think mine might be like 150 years by
about two things.

3282
02:18:39,401 --> 02:18:40,710
I travel with one of the areas,
uh,

3283
02:18:40,940 --> 02:18:42,730
you know,
it was like those power lungs and then

3284
02:18:42,731 --> 02:18:44,410
you breathe in and out of to strengthen
the,

3285
02:18:44,411 --> 02:18:47,590
the experts in inspiratory muscles and
the diaphragm and then a captains of

3286
02:18:47,591 --> 02:18:48,850
crush.
And so if I'm on long,

3287
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:51,160
like a long road trip and I got to drive
a long time,

3288
02:18:51,460 --> 02:18:54,790
I go back and forth between the hand
grip strengthener and then the lung

3289
02:18:54,791 --> 02:18:56,710
strength.
I'll just like work out for like two

3290
02:18:56,711 --> 02:18:58,820
hours while you're driving.
That's awesome.

3291
02:18:58,821 --> 02:19:01,180
It's amazing you put put on a good book
and the work,

3292
02:19:01,181 --> 02:19:02,230
the grip and work the lungs.

3293
02:19:02,260 --> 02:19:04,270
Yeah.
I'm a big believer in those grip things.

3294
02:19:04,271 --> 02:19:06,400
I mean it just makes your hands so much
stronger.

3295
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,740
And the captains of crush,
I mean they don't fuck around.

3296
02:19:08,741 --> 02:19:11,950
Those are really hard and you combine
that with the apnea so you pass out a

3297
02:19:11,951 --> 02:19:15,550
few times and a super safe,
safe way to drive.

3298
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:19,300
Just like you got to sweat,
you're blue in the face.

3299
02:19:19,301 --> 02:19:21,670
You can't even grip the steering wheel
cause your grips gun.

3300
02:19:21,770 --> 02:19:23,980
Yeah.
Well we're all short on time here,

3301
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:26,740
but I would feel like we could probably
talk for about six days and you would

3302
02:19:26,741 --> 02:19:28,700
never run out of things to talk about.
That's fun.

3303
02:19:28,850 --> 02:19:30,530
Yeah.
How often are you around here,

3304
02:19:30,531 --> 02:19:31,550
man?
We've got to do this again.

3305
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:32,810
Uh,
that often.

3306
02:19:33,080 --> 02:19:34,910
Not that often.
Not that I avoid La.

3307
02:19:36,050 --> 02:19:37,780
I like it up and spoken.
Oh yeah.

3308
02:19:37,990 --> 02:19:41,230
What I do is when I travel like batch
stuff here or like I'm just like back to

3309
02:19:41,231 --> 02:19:43,640
back,
like I shot four documentaries yesterday

3310
02:19:43,641 --> 02:19:44,210
and then,
you know,

3311
02:19:44,210 --> 02:19:47,050
talk the day before,
like I batch a lot of meetings and then

3312
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:47,870
go home.

3313
02:19:47,870 --> 02:19:50,420
So I'll go a,
I'll go out to Malibu tonight and then

3314
02:19:50,421 --> 02:19:52,460
I'm going to go to uh,
uh,

3315
02:19:52,461 --> 02:19:54,890
that,
that human garage treatment on uh,

3316
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:59,360
on the 31st and record a podcast for a
second because I've been following those

3317
02:19:59,361 --> 02:20:02,720
guys online,
the cumin garage and it seems really

3318
02:20:02,721 --> 02:20:04,290
fucking interesting.
Weird.

3319
02:20:05,180 --> 02:20:07,070
It goes back and forth.
Like I've had some people telling me

3320
02:20:07,071 --> 02:20:08,750
like that it's like cultish,
right?

3321
02:20:08,751 --> 02:20:11,330
That cause because you go in there and
you gotta be like a member of their

3322
02:20:11,331 --> 02:20:12,780
tribe and,
and they,

3323
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:15,890
but I have never,
I've never experienced anything like

3324
02:20:15,891 --> 02:20:18,230
that and I,
I'm not quite sure what people mean when

3325
02:20:18,231 --> 02:20:22,340
they say that.
That's also big profile.

3326
02:20:22,341 --> 02:20:26,120
You're a famous fitness guy.
It may be they let you slide,

3327
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:29,030
I don't know,
but I enjoy it.

3328
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:33,440
They like fill you full of like high
dose catechumen before you go in so your

3329
02:20:33,441 --> 02:20:36,440
muscles just like melt and then they
have like four massage therapists

3330
02:20:36,441 --> 02:20:37,940
working on you at the same time.

3331
02:20:38,210 --> 02:20:41,450
And they taught me this how like if
one's like rubbing your head in a

3332
02:20:41,451 --> 02:20:44,840
clockwise direction but the other guys
mashing on your adductor with their

3333
02:20:44,841 --> 02:20:47,570
elbow,
you don't feel the mashing on the addict

3334
02:20:47,571 --> 02:20:51,230
or as much because like the,
the movement on your head is distracting

3335
02:20:51,231 --> 02:20:54,920
you from that and then somebody else is
working on your leg and they have like

3336
02:20:54,921 --> 02:20:58,880
all these essential oils that they fill
the air with their like special oils

3337
02:20:58,881 --> 02:21:02,930
that that causes you to relax and be a
little bit more open to the deep tissue

3338
02:21:02,931 --> 02:21:05,840
work and everybody,
they're like goes through a special

3339
02:21:05,841 --> 02:21:07,340
treat.
I mean I liked it so much.

3340
02:21:07,370 --> 02:21:08,051
I actually,
I,

3341
02:21:08,051 --> 02:21:11,060
I flew one of their guys up to my house
to work on me at my house.

3342
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:12,320
They're doing it right.
That's me.

3343
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:14,500
What is that?
That's it.

3344
02:21:15,810 --> 02:21:17,030
Is that,
yeah,

3345
02:21:17,031 --> 02:21:18,470
that's there.
That's there.

3346
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:19,290
Yeah,
exactly.

3347
02:21:19,290 --> 02:21:22,310
That's scary.
And he like put on the first time I was

3348
02:21:22,311 --> 02:21:23,600
there,
he was like working on my back and he

3349
02:21:23,601 --> 02:21:26,420
worked on my back by putting on a rubber
glove and

3350
02:21:27,990 --> 02:21:30,860
under the,
I actually have had that intro intro but

3351
02:21:30,861 --> 02:21:31,950
massage.
Okay.

3352
02:21:32,070 --> 02:21:33,950
They worked on it.
They know they work on your,

3353
02:21:34,040 --> 02:21:36,590
on your pelvic floor.
It's pelvic floor therapy inside your

3354
02:21:36,591 --> 02:21:38,390
advocates' tight just like anything
else.

3355
02:21:38,391 --> 02:21:40,890
So they go through your asshole to get,
go into your assets.

3356
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:43,300
Something that appropriately a lot of
times we're like,

3357
02:21:44,330 --> 02:21:45,980
no,
I had a girl down in Hawaii do it.

3358
02:21:46,130 --> 02:21:47,380
Uh,
I was uh,

3359
02:21:47,420 --> 02:21:49,550
Gabby racist trainer.
Like she actually,

3360
02:21:49,551 --> 02:21:52,910
she does like dry needling and intra
therapy.

3361
02:21:53,930 --> 02:21:55,210
Yeah.
And uh,

3362
02:21:55,300 --> 02:21:56,360
uh,
she also,

3363
02:21:56,361 --> 02:21:58,760
she had me by like this glass tool so I
can do it myself.

3364
02:21:58,790 --> 02:22:01,730
So I do this and I go in through my butt
and I do massage.

3365
02:22:02,130 --> 02:22:03,710
It sounds weird,
but it actually is,

3366
02:22:05,150 --> 02:22:08,270
that shit gets tight glasses smooth.
I don't know.

3367
02:22:08,330 --> 02:22:09,710
It has these pause,
the metal,

3368
02:22:10,250 --> 02:22:13,130
the fum putting glass in your asshole.
The scene.

3369
02:22:13,140 --> 02:22:15,260
One of those faces of death videos.
Isn't that like,

3370
02:22:15,261 --> 02:22:15,830
what are those?
Uh,

3371
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:19,880
my roommates in college used to run it.
Those so horrible.

3372
02:22:20,510 --> 02:22:21,790
Some would die.
No,

3373
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:24,200
there's a,
there's a video of a guy who stuck a

3374
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:26,340
bottle up his ass.
And then if the bottle breaks,

3375
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:31,350
it's one of those I stop at Thc
suppositories and and actual tissue

3376
02:22:31,351 --> 02:22:32,100
devices.
Yeah,

3377
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:34,070
glass rods.
Um,

3378
02:22:34,260 --> 02:22:35,240
anyways,
the uh,

3379
02:22:35,270 --> 02:22:35,911
yeah,
the human guards,

3380
02:22:35,911 --> 02:22:38,130
they went in through,
through my mouth to work on my back,

3381
02:22:38,160 --> 02:22:39,930
like back through your mind going
through your mouth,

3382
02:22:39,931 --> 02:22:42,600
like [inaudible] old rubber glove and
they're like working on the different

3383
02:22:42,601 --> 02:22:44,730
areas.
You know how to like if you work on like

3384
02:22:44,731 --> 02:22:47,340
your,
your infraspinatus or your Terry's minor

3385
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:49,980
in your shoulder,
it can actually get rid of pain on the

3386
02:22:49,981 --> 02:22:50,820
front of your shoulder.

3387
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:52,440
Like there are certain trigger points.
Yes.

3388
02:22:52,860 --> 02:22:54,810
And it's very similar.
Like there are certain trigger points on

3389
02:22:54,811 --> 02:22:58,890
the head that refer to like the back or
the so ass.

3390
02:22:59,160 --> 02:23:01,840
It's really interesting.
I think this whole idea behind Stasha

3391
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:05,250
and trigger points and how,
what when you're working on one area,

3392
02:23:05,251 --> 02:23:06,780
it actually affects another area.
Well,

3393
02:23:06,781 --> 02:23:11,781
I got rolfing done a few times when I
had some pretty bad back injuries and a,

3394
02:23:11,941 --> 02:23:14,040
I found that to be pretty interesting.
Yeah,

3395
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:15,510
very painful.
Yeah.

3396
02:23:15,780 --> 02:23:20,580
I haven't had any rolfing done.
I had it from a giant dude too.

3397
02:23:20,670 --> 02:23:22,410
I've ever had.
I've ever had rolfing.

3398
02:23:22,411 --> 02:23:25,650
I use a lot of those vibrating foam
rollers and vibrating deep tissue

3399
02:23:25,651 --> 02:23:28,240
devices though I'm a big,
big fan.

3400
02:23:28,260 --> 02:23:30,600
Most of the time you're not going
somewhere to get deep tissue.

3401
02:23:30,750 --> 02:23:35,130
Yeah,
most of the time I do my own and I just

3402
02:23:35,131 --> 02:23:39,540
started to begin to have a massage
therapists come to my house once a week

3403
02:23:39,870 --> 02:23:42,990
cause I think like there there's a
certain amount of relaxation that you

3404
02:23:42,991 --> 02:23:47,010
get when somebody else is working on you
and you're laying down on a table and I

3405
02:23:47,011 --> 02:23:51,060
have like this,
this used to like a bio mat bio mat,

3406
02:23:51,061 --> 02:23:52,260
like purchase a bunch of heat.

3407
02:23:52,500 --> 02:23:56,340
So I laid down on the Bio Mat and I put
on my Michael Tyrrell

3408
02:23:58,050 --> 02:24:01,410
and a diffuse essential oil and have her
work on me for a couple of hours.

3409
02:24:01,411 --> 02:24:02,760
Usually I'll have her come over after
dinner,

3410
02:24:02,761 --> 02:24:05,570
like around seven 38 o'clock and you
know,

3411
02:24:05,580 --> 02:24:07,320
like after the family's kind of wrapped
up and,

3412
02:24:07,321 --> 02:24:09,150
and she'll just work on me at night and
they go to bed.

3413
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,850
Who in?
You're fascinating,

3414
02:24:11,851 --> 02:24:13,530
dude.
I'm glad we got a chance to talk some

3415
02:24:13,531 --> 02:24:16,330
daily cools talk.
That's a,

3416
02:24:16,380 --> 02:24:18,060
that's a sick techno hunt set up.
Yeah,

3417
02:24:18,061 --> 02:24:19,980
it was a lot of fun day.
Thank you very much for doing this.

3418
02:24:19,981 --> 02:24:23,610
Appreciate it.

3419
