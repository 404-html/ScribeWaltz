1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,410
Three.
Two.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,430
One.
Okay.

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,030
Hello Jeffrey.
Hello Joe.

4
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,460
How you doing man?
I'm a young and handsome.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:12,560
You are young and the amps.
Yes.

6
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:14,570
We all are.
If we're not dead.

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,930
I don't know what that means.
It's all good.

8
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:19,700
I'm all jet lagged.
Yeah,

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,810
it's cracking.
And how are you?

10
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:24,950
I'm a big bowl of wonderful.
You're a big bowl.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,700
A big ball of fucking huge bowl of
wonder.

12
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,820
Aggressive with that statement.
I am.

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,030
I am the head.
Don't doubt me with dendrifund.

14
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,680
Don't doubt you.
Yeah,

15
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:36,950
it's good to see you,
man.

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,410
Good to see you too.
What's the latest,

17
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,320
what is the latest,
uh,

18
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:44,570
about to start another season of the
Goldbergs,

19
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,560
another season of curb after working
with the fabulous Brian Cowen.

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,690
I love working with Bryan County.
He makes me laugh all the time.

21
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,980
It's here later.
He's going to guess a two o'clock.

22
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,600
Oh,
so then I'll see him or three.

23
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,770
Yeah,
maybe not.

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,220
But Anyhow,
point being is I dig Brian callen very

25
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,690
much.
And he likes you too.

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,553
Yeah.
That's cool.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,310
That's cool man.
What's the latest,

28
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:07,961
uh,
with the,

29
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:09,740
the standup career?
Uh,

30
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:12,500
see you around the store a lot at the
store.

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,870
On occasion.
I don't do the store that much anymore

32
00:01:14,871 --> 00:01:18,650
because I've stopped doing showcase
spots for the most part.

33
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,350
I just do,
I have a regular show every Friday night

34
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:25,040
at the Improv in the lab and I do,
you know,

35
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,540
an hour,
hour and 10 minutes.

36
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,700
And then occasionally I do flappers,
which is a horrible name yet in Burbank,

37
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,850
but they'll look club but a great room.
A great room.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,610
Yeah.
And I do there on occasion on Sunday

39
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:40,220
nights.
So I do an hour,

40
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,040
uh,
going out of the House for 15,

41
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,050
20 minutes.
Not Worth my time.

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,520
Does it,
um,

43
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,620
do you,
when you do like an hour set,

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:53,120
do you plan your sets out or do you have
like some material that you'd like to be

45
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:53,660
working on in?

46
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,210
Is that why you like the freedom of
having an hour or so you could just kind

47
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:58,970
of fuck around?
I have no preparation whatsoever,

48
00:01:58,971 --> 00:02:00,050
except I may think,
oh,

49
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:03,410
I'll talk about that tonight,
but I have no preparation.

50
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,440
It may bring up a story I've told
before,

51
00:02:06,441 --> 00:02:09,500
but I have no idea.
Literally when I step on stage,

52
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,810
I have no idea what I'm going to talk
about,

53
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,530
what does help me,
what I've done for quite a while now as

54
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,600
I come up to a different song every time
I come up and then I just talk about

55
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,120
that song,
the story of the making of that song,

56
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,690
who sang that song,
what that song means to me and that will

57
00:02:26,691 --> 00:02:29,570
usually lead me to something.
That's all I need.

58
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,780
Yeah.
The reason why I asked is you have a

59
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,980
very unusual style,
like I've seen you a bunch of times at

60
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,780
the store,
very loose,

61
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,150
very loose.
It's a great thing because you have the

62
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:40,940
confidence to do that.
Like a lot of people have to be like

63
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:43,540
super rigid and their preparation
without a doubt.

64
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,374
Yeah.
Same thing.

65
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,360
Set up punchline in the correct order
every night.

66
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,910
I'm only confident in the fact that I'm
funny.

67
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,650
I am not competent.
And any other fact in terms of going on

68
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:56,510
stage that's going to support it is the
most important.

69
00:02:56,511 --> 00:03:00,160
And so I go up with the knowledge that
no matter goes down.

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,370
I am funny and we'll be funny.
Boom.

71
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,930
That's it.
Goodnight.

72
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,920
And Are you doing the road at all?
Hardly ever.

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,070
When I do the road it's,
I did London in December,

74
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:16,360
that a couple of weeks of shows a week,
a couple of weeks at a theater there.

75
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,450
What they did.
Oh,

76
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,480
theater.
It's a small cool theater.

77
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,240
That's like 500 seats or something.
I don't even know.

78
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,970
I don't even pay attention.
How's that?

79
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,690
I've done that.
I've done uh,

80
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,130
leister square.
Have done a couple of different of

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,993
squares.
Good.

82
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:30,910
Yeah,
I just,

83
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,570
I got to London,
I go to New York on occasion and

84
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,360
perform.
I use,

85
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,720
I played everywhere.
I played everywhere from Indianapolis to

86
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:44,410
Seattle to Miami,
like an all points in between,

87
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:46,000
you know,
um,

88
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,100
Tucson,
uh,

89
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,330
you know,
Phoenix,

90
00:03:49,331 --> 00:03:50,500
I mean,
like all over.

91
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:51,520
I mean,
I've done it.

92
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm,
I'm 56 years old.

93
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,190
I've got two TV shows,
I develop a bunch of other stuff.

94
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,580
I'm passionate about my stand up,
I get enough,

95
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,830
I don't know if they earn a living by
going on the road,

96
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:07,831
which I have had to in the past.
So I stay home and do my standup when I

97
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,230
can,
which is every Friday for sure.

98
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,230
Because the thing is it's a very nice
and I've worked towards that and that's

99
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,260
a beautiful thing to work towards
because the thing that does get you is

100
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:22,261
that travel.
Oh you know it was the thing that no one

101
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:27,781
understands is the only joy that you can
possibly get when you travel is the

102
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:32,800
moment when you're on stage.
And if that's troublesome or not fun,

103
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,410
it's a drag.
It's depressing.

104
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:38,980
But those moments on stage,
if they're great,

105
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,330
it's all worth it.
Yeah,

106
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,300
no,
it's the thing that also when you go on

107
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,760
the road,
if you have to do morning radio,

108
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,040
that's your health.

109
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,910
It screws up your time.
You know what time you go to bed.

110
00:04:51,911 --> 00:04:53,530
Cause I,
I like to set,

111
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,300
I don't worry as much on a consistent
basis what time I wake up cause that'll

112
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:02,680
automatic b automatic.
I tried consistently to go to bed at the

113
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:07,681
same time every night.
It's a different approach that a

114
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,530
psychiatrist told me and it has worked
wonders for me.

115
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,980
A psychiatrist told you yeah,
that it's bad because everyone always

116
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,860
focuses on waking up the same time every
day.

117
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,370
He said focus on going to bed at the
same time every night and that'll be

118
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:28,540
more productive for you.
And I do that with a sort of a half hour

119
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,270
bump to fall asleep to maybe read for a
minute,

120
00:05:31,271 --> 00:05:35,170
whatever.
But I'm in bed usually by 10 I've never

121
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:36,980
gone to a psychiatrist,
but a one,

122
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:41,890
one of the shows that it was on,
I was like the only person on the set

123
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,690
that didn't go to a psychiatrist.

124
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,070
And I'm like,
maybe I'm fucked up.

125
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,870
No,
by the way,

126
00:05:46,871 --> 00:05:49,990
if you're functioning in the world,
that's great.

127
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Congratulations.
I have sometimes trouble functioning in

128
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,380
the world.
How's,

129
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:56,900
and,
and,

130
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,160
and a well,
it's like I find going on stage,

131
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,750
I'm fearless and I don't even like
leaving my house.

132
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,990
I prefer to stay home.
I love napping.

133
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,530
Oh,
do I love napping?

134
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,670
If I could smoke some endeca and take a
nap every day.

135
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:19,150
I do transcendental meditation.
I do all the chill things at home and I

136
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:22,160
leave to work.
I don't like going to parties.

137
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,540
I like a good dinner party because that
means I can have an actual conversation

138
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,300
with someone.
But I was just at a party the other

139
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,920
night,
a goodbye party for a friend of mine.

140
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,690
It was a Jeff Ross House and I had the
worst time.

141
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:38,450
I lasted 20 minutes.
The only people I could talk to where

142
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:42,060
Comedians I there were looking to be a
Jeff Ross,

143
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,190
his party,
but comedian,

144
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,470
some people with man buns in the hot
tub.

145
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,040
It was very unsettling and wrong.
I wanted nothing to do with it.

146
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,550
I said my goodbyes to my friend and uh,
uh,

147
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,860
she's moving to Japan.
So I um,

148
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,020
I uh,
said my goodbyes,

149
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:02,060
but I was out of respect to her that I
went,

150
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,070
but out of respect to myself,
I didn't stay long man buns in a hot tub

151
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:08,150
because we never see combination in a
hot tub.

152
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,710
You Go,
I don't belong here.

153
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,620
You don't belong there.
Yeah,

154
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,910
I can't be done.
No,

155
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,770
it's bad.
When did that start happening?

156
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:20,160
When did the man bun stones to me like
in a big way a couple of years ago and

157
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:24,850
was like Samurais and then there was a
big dropoff for a long time and then a

158
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,070
big drop off.
That's exactly it.

159
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,730
I don't get it.
Maybe why grow your hair long if you're

160
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:32,750
going to wear a man bun?

161
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,890
I think either lawyer,
you have the idea,

162
00:07:35,891 --> 00:07:40,010
but it's ridiculous.
I was at a gas station in studio city

163
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,700
and I was seconds away from talking to
this dude.

164
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:49,060
He had a man bond that looked like a
bird's nest with Kaitlyn with a

165
00:07:49,611 --> 00:07:52,160
waterfall on the outside and I just
went,

166
00:07:52,161 --> 00:07:53,890
why?
I just want to pass him.

167
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:58,040
I go on being totally friendly.
I want to make this a conversation.

168
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,410
Why explain?
I don't get it.

169
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,800
I feel like what it is is it's like
they're,

170
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,450
they're letting you know that this is me
when I'm out,

171
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,370
but when I'm at home and I'm feeling
sexy,

172
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,090
I just undo that and let it down.
I don't know what it is.

173
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,100
I just relax and I unwrapped the big
ball,

174
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:15,950
the wrong.
It's a big bouldering and no,

175
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,080
you're not sexy,
Douchey,

176
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:22,370
douchey.
Just what's your hair's ever been mine.

177
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,700
I had like a Jew fro type festival
happening when I was younger.

178
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,100
Like longer curly,
but not like shoulder length.

179
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,010
No,
it's ridiculous.

180
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,820
It's weird that hair grows that long.
Only on your head.

181
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:39,410
That's what's weird.
Rocker arm and you're grown like Robert

182
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,830
Plant's had cool hair.
Like,

183
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,740
go for it.
Don't man bun it.

184
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,730
Yeah,
go for it.

185
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,370
I'm all for long hair.
Rockers of different rules.

186
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,950
I saw a guy last night,
a bay in a band,

187
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,350
a bass player,
a big man bun.

188
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
Big baller wrong.
You know what?

189
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:55,500
I'm uncomfortable with a cel haircut in
a rock band.

190
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,050
Oh,
what are you doing with that fucking

191
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:01,320
button down conservative haircut?
I dig the play in a band.

192
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,650
I think playing against type is a big
bullet.

193
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,160
Delightful.
Nah,

194
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,760
not Angela.
We differ on this one.

195
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,980
We differ on this one.
Yes we did.

196
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,790
I think a group of men,
like I thought David Bowie's band,

197
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,860
tin machine.
I didn't really dig their music,

198
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,790
but I love the look of all of them
wearing the suits with the close cropped

199
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:25,050
hair.
Well Bowie's so odd and so undeniably

200
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,780
creative that he was allowed to get away
with anything and he's allowed to do

201
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:28,680
anything he wants.
But,

202
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,270
but truthfully,
if you have any sort of a confidence you

203
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:36,110
can except the man bun.
There it is right here.

204
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,310
There it is.
History of Bowie's.

205
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,870
Yeah,
but that there should have cut his hair

206
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:42,480
short.
The one with the long hair maybe,

207
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,780
but he's Kinda John Travolta and he cut
it short.

208
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,890
Here is the pressure from the other
three guys got to be too much at tired

209
00:09:49,891 --> 00:09:52,150
of buying shampoo and all that bullshit.
Yeah,

210
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,310
yeah,
yeah.

211
00:09:53,311 --> 00:09:55,650
The upkeep is ridiculous.
Outrageous.

212
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,530
Do to condition their hair.
And they have to leave it in for 10

213
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,100
minutes.
Oh,

214
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,570
that's a big bowl of,
come on man.

215
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,670
Come on Bro.
Yeah,

216
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,430
but for something,
there's some reason why it is okay in a

217
00:10:05,431 --> 00:10:08,820
band,
but it's not okay for comic like a comic

218
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:13,290
with long like led Zepplin here because
you know what happens when a comic does

219
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,660
that.
Their whole act becomes about it and

220
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:16,650
it's like,
dude,

221
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,740
that's just boring.
You remember Jackson Purdue?

222
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,590
I do remember Jackson.
Pretty crazy long hair.

223
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,100
Like a band guy.
A lot of material about his hair.

224
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,580
He did.
I know I just,

225
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,750
you know,
I used to,

226
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,520
when I was younger I went for the
obvious,

227
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,890
I did a lot of material about having a
big head.

228
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,110
Ah,
now it's of no interest to me.

229
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,810
You couldn't also do like the Robert
Plant shirt thing either.

230
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,870
I have,
I have a Robert Plant shirt but not him

231
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:50,220
or like let it open now.
I think it's called nurses do it better

232
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,190
or nurses and some of nursing on its
powder blue.

233
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,500
Uh,
he wore it on one of the zipline tours

234
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,310
in the early seventies,
and I saw it for sale on Amazon and I

235
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,230
bought one.
It doesn't give off the same pie.

236
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,390
Yeah.
It's different with different people,

237
00:11:03,391 --> 00:11:03,781
right?
Yeah.

238
00:11:03,781 --> 00:11:06,360
But I always,
one of my non sequiturs to tell people

239
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,250
all the time is,
you love the nursing industry.

240
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:09,800
I just said to people,
hey,

241
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,030
you know what you love?
You love the nursing industry.

242
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,150
I've said that to nurses.
They say people just chuckle.

243
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,090
They don't know how to make,
what are,

244
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,700
they don't know.
You know?

245
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,690
Nonsequitors laughter,
nervous laughter is a certain things or

246
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:28,260
certain looks that came and went and
people tried to bring back.

247
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,060
Like,
do you remember a few years back they

248
00:11:30,061 --> 00:11:32,880
were trying to bring back bell bottoms?
No.

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,220
Yes.
That's how much of a failure it was.

250
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:40,250
Bill Mary was actually photographed a
couple of days ago at a golf course with

251
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,680
some fabulous bell bottoms.
You see?

252
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:47,520
That's delightful because it's so wrong
that it's beautiful and perfect.

253
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,910
Bill Murray picture look at them.
Oh,

254
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,320
see that.
It's a big ball.

255
00:11:52,321 --> 00:11:54,610
He's so fun that dude,
and he's wonderful.

256
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,500
He is just,
he is so fun.

257
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,320
Look at him.
Rang up South Carolina.

258
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,200
I think it's because of his kids.
That's what it is.

259
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,880
Yeah.
I think it was a family thing.

260
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,450
Oh,
he's a,

261
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,980
a beautiful shot Bourdain's show.
And uh,

262
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,970
bordain interviewed him in his small
town where he lives and it's like,

263
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,200
wow,
look at this guy.

264
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,630
Just kinda hanging out,
being normal.

265
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,430
No girlfriend,
no wife,

266
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,840
just,
just being himself.

267
00:12:19,841 --> 00:12:23,220
Now he doesn't have a girlfriend or he
was talking to him.

268
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,620
It.
Oh,

269
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,490
he was talking about,
yeah.

270
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,470
I don't think he was talking about on
that show was talking about in an

271
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:29,170
interview and he just doesn't want to do
it anymore.

272
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,120
Please leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

273
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,650
Stop.
Delightful.

274
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,420
That's why I liked staying home.
It's nice.

275
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,250
As a matter of fact,
at the end of my shows,

276
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:41,670
I always thank the audience for actually
leaving their homes to come see me

277
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:46,360
because I know what an effort that is,
and I'm so appreciative of it.

278
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,910
So you're just a homebody type
character.

279
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,490
Yeah.
Well,

280
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,710
you know,
it's like my life was extraordinary,

281
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,000
so I want to live an ordinary,
ordinary life as I can.

282
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,990
That makes sense.
You know,

283
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,990
just calm.
It doesn't have to be ordinary down

284
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,420
chilling man.
Yeah.

285
00:13:03,421 --> 00:13:04,211
You need that,
right?

286
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,680
Yeah,
I chaos.

287
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm not big shows.
Like tonight I'm going to an opening of

288
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:09,670
a movie.

289
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,240
My friend wrote it and you know.
Yeah.

290
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,410
Prepare yourself for it.
Here we go.

291
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,280
I'll be cool with it.
Like if I know I'm doing it and why I'm

292
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,240
doing it,
I do it.

293
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,850
You know we saw party whose party?
Jeff Ross,

294
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,320
but you know,
I'd go to a dinner party if he had one.

295
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:26,990
Again,
I'm,

296
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,050
I'm done though with the Jeff Ross
parties.

297
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,800
Jeff at all was a lot of parts.
I know I love Jeff Ross,

298
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,770
but I am not going to anymore of his
parties.

299
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,200
Tell him I'll go by myself.
There was house,

300
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,360
I did have them put two hands on his
shoulders.

301
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,920
Tell him you love him,
but the way I will,

302
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,190
I'm going to talk to him about the man
bun in the pool or like who?

303
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,680
Who are you friends with it as a man?
He's a producer,

304
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:53,410
bro.
He's helping me with a project.

305
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,630
He didn't look like a producer.
Just snap the shoulders go,

306
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,570
I love you.
I can't come to your fucking pool

307
00:13:58,571 --> 00:13:59,550
parties anymore,
Bro.

308
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:01,330
Yeah.
Well it wasn't even a pool party.

309
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,040
That was a thing.
Somebody went,

310
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:07,540
I'm going to bring my suit
and getting the pool and he got in the

311
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,880
pool with these two other people.
I didn't even really notice that man.

312
00:14:10,881 --> 00:14:13,430
But that's unfortunate.
If it's not a pool party and you decide

313
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,000
to get in the pool,
that's always awkward as fuck.

314
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,490
I just didn't belong.
Yeah.

315
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,940
You gotta be like a really comfortable
person to take off your clothes when

316
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:23,090
everybody else has theirs.
Only.

317
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,390
I'm pro naked.
Good for you.

318
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,160
I'm pro naked.
I mean for me,

319
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,540
I'm all comfortable.
Well,

320
00:14:28,541 --> 00:14:31,720
you're fit.
The fact that I'm prone to the kid,

321
00:14:31,721 --> 00:14:32,740
you're angry at me.
No.

322
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,470
By the way,
I saw your little festival here.

323
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,760
You're really,
your passions are comedy and fitness.

324
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,150
That's one thing.
Let's,

325
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,260
yeah,
it's one thing hard.

326
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:42,971
Yeah.
Well,

327
00:14:42,971 --> 00:14:45,670
I'm just an American Werewolf in London.
That's the thing.

328
00:14:45,671 --> 00:14:47,260
In the middle of the day,
I recognize that.

329
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:51,290
I love that movie,
but that's when he was in,

330
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,910
uh,
Trafalgar Square.

331
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,080
Yes.
Yes.

332
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:58,190
I remember that moment of scary.
I'm not happy unless I'm a exercising.

333
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,860
I've tried both ways.
Not Happy unless I'm napping.

334
00:15:00,861 --> 00:15:03,620
So we both have our ways about us.
Yeah.

335
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:06,470
Well everybody's bodies by the way.
But I do exercise.

336
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,980
I eat well.
I eat gluten free,

337
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:14,390
I eat dairy free and I eat sugar free.
That's awesome.

338
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:15,860
That's a good combination.
Yeah.

339
00:15:15,861 --> 00:15:19,940
And I aspire to be more of a vegetarian,
but I'm not obsessed with it.

340
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:24,110
Do you read books on nutrition?
I have read many books on nutrition.

341
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:26,730
Yes.
Some that Brian Cowen even recommended

342
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,040
to me once.
Uh,

343
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,830
I couldn't think of the name I probably
have and where they want to know.

344
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,350
Ryan counts a big recommender books.
Kindle.

345
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,510
Hold on,
I'll tell you what he recommended and

346
00:15:38,511 --> 00:15:39,380
they were good.
I like,

347
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,030
you know,
every one of those kind of books,

348
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,970
even if they're not well written or
whatever.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,860
I learned something from,
I picked him.

350
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,230
I read uh,
a ton.

351
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,000
That's what I do when I'm at home.
I read a lot.

352
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,400
I listened to albums and I read music
and a,

353
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,540
a platelet Tasi albums.
Do you have like a record player?

354
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,090
I have a record player and I have a
thousand albums.

355
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,960
Okay.
Wow.

356
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,100
I'm one of those good thousand albums,
right?

357
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,980
About a thousand.
Holy Shit.

358
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,180
Yeah,
I enjoy it.

359
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,920
Do you have like a room that you go to
and you know,

360
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:09,260
I'm going to,
I'm moving into a new house which will

361
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,930
be able to,
a specific room that I will go into

362
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,730
districtly play guitar and listened to
analog watches.

363
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:18,020
Yeah.
If you,

364
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:19,580
uh,
do you know Henry Rollins at all?

365
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,100
I do know Henry rounds.
Great friends.

366
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:23,150
I mean,
but I do know him.

367
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,540
He's an acquaintance of mine.
He's a fascinating guy.

368
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,670
He's a fascinating guy.
Good man.

369
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,450
Very good dude.
Very inspirational guy to inspires me.

370
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,020
I dig him.
I did an interview with them at Largo.

371
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:40,580
Dig Him big time.
He's got these crazy quarter million

372
00:16:40,581 --> 00:16:44,570
dollar speakers in his house.
You know like there's this speaker room.

373
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,010
Yeah,
you look at this,

374
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,760
this is the room is all these albums and
those,

375
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,290
those gigantic things.
That dude on the right I think as Robert

376
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,990
Hilburn who was the critic for the La
Times.

377
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,610
That's how much I do music.
I think that's Robert Hilburn.

378
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,550
I'm pretty sure.
So Henry gets it.

379
00:17:01,551 --> 00:17:05,810
Henry who obviously became famous,
very Johnny Cash.

380
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,080
He wrote the Great Johnny Cash Book that
came out of here.

381
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,400
It's cause,
cause I saw you dig Johnny Cash by the

382
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,060
pictures on the wall.

383
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:14,120
I love Johnny Cash.
I had a dog named Johnny Cash just died

384
00:17:14,121 --> 00:17:15,530
recently.
Unfortunately.

385
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:19,880
My granddaughter's name is Johnny Kin.
That those still speakers are fucking

386
00:17:19,881 --> 00:17:21,350
crazy.
Look at these speakers he's got,

387
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,940
yeah,
I just got new speakers and they were

388
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,170
like 8,000 for a pair and I thought I
was nuts.

389
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,600
Look at the size of that.
That's ridiculous.

390
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,170
That's like who underground.
It says like 2001 a space odyssey

391
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:32,720
looking speakers.
I want to go over his house,

392
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:36,650
but I don't want to ask.
I don't want to be like henry,

393
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,810
come on Bro.
Let me call your house.

394
00:17:38,811 --> 00:17:42,260
I don't want to be that weird guy.
I'm looking for the day of voids cause I

395
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,180
know I downloaded them.
I didn't want to own them.

396
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,300
But how many people do you think owns
those speakers?

397
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:48,400
I mean,
I thought yesterday,

398
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,520
but that person,
if you have to be wealthy

399
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,070
or that's where you want to put your
money,

400
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,590
click on the yellow one that you just,
what's that?

401
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,330
Oh,
that's the same speaker except in

402
00:17:57,331 --> 00:17:59,490
yellow.
Those are a big ballroom because they

403
00:17:59,491 --> 00:18:02,140
look like plumbing supplies.
Do.

404
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:03,900
They don't look good.
I don't think they look,

405
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,920
oh,
I think they look good.

406
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,930
I think they look futuristic again.
So here we go.

407
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,960
Why we get fat.
I was that by on,

408
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,890
I can't remember the guy's name,
why we get fat and the four hour body.

409
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,270
Oh yeah.
Okay.

410
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,610
Tonight.
It's embarrassed and I learned stuff

411
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:21,441
from both,
but I'm,

412
00:18:21,441 --> 00:18:24,990
so I learned stuff about nutrition and
stuff and I'm in my,

413
00:18:24,991 --> 00:18:28,440
at my most,
I was three 20 and I'm currently in the

414
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:33,090
two forties that's nine.
I'm making the transition now to

415
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:38,091
hopefully low to 30 somewhere in that
two twenties and then building up muscle

416
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,530
and I'll never be fit like you.

417
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,131
And I'm not,
I'm,

418
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:44,280
that's,
I'm not saying that to insult myself in

419
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,780
terms of like,
you know,

420
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:48,660
but you,
this is a passion of yours.

421
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,500
It's not a passion of mine.
I just want to live life at a higher

422
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:54,810
level and a better level.
So I feel good.

423
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,130
I want to feel great and I already do.
So if I can improve on this,

424
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,600
delightful,
the big things,

425
00:19:00,601 --> 00:19:05,601
cutting carbohydrates,
most people eat far too much for me.

426
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,410
That's where the gluten and the sugar
came from and the dairy.

427
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:12,540
I,
and I feel good when my body not having

428
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,460
those things.
I react positively my,

429
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,070
so anything else is okay for me.
Can I exercise to do,

430
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:23,250
I do.
[inaudible] I bodies is fucking hard.

431
00:19:23,251 --> 00:19:24,250
Really hard.
Yeah.

432
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,830
Was Great.
Polonius teacher is great.

433
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,390
I do,
I swim,

434
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,780
I work with a trainer.
I play tennis,

435
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:31,860
playing tennis.

436
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,880
Uh,
tomorrow morning,

437
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,721
today's Wednesday.
Yeah.

438
00:19:33,721 --> 00:19:36,030
Tomorrow morning I'll be playing with my
tennis teacher.

439
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:38,460
I play golf,
which is not that physical.

440
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:40,270
However,
like I went,

441
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:42,060
it was at the store buying stuff the
other day,

442
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:43,020
you know,
at the golf story.

443
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,720
And he wasn't,
the guy was very nice guy helping me,

444
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,290
wanted to sell me something that I have
to bend over to get the ball.

445
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,020
I go,
I think that bending over and as matter

446
00:19:52,021 --> 00:19:53,580
of fact,
stretching my hamstrings,

447
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,100
really,
I don't know the benefit I'd get from

448
00:19:56,101 --> 00:20:00,100
golf if I didn't at leats bend,
he's telling you not to bend well that

449
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:01,770
they have these things so people don't
have to bend.

450
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,390
Well,
that's for people that are like really

451
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:04,170
bad back.
No,

452
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:04,531
no,
no.

453
00:20:04,531 --> 00:20:07,620
It's for lazy people.
That's why I think a lot of people,

454
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,930
so for me it's a matter of pride to
bend.

455
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,340
If you have a bad back,
you probably can't swing either.

456
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,500
You can't swing a lot of you back.
Um,

457
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,860
but I do a lot of different things.
I love sports.

458
00:20:16,861 --> 00:20:20,070
I used to play when I was younger,
I played baseball and football.

459
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,660
Do you ever play golf or tennis rather
with Callan cause he's a tenant's freak.

460
00:20:24,661 --> 00:20:25,530
No,
I should actually,

461
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,810
by the way,
I just started again and played tennis

462
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,210
since I was a kid.
I'm actually going to talk to him about

463
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,710
that.
Hopefully we can play some.

464
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,010
The thing about tennis though is it's a
lot of like going left and right and

465
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:38,410
left and right and putting weird strains
and pressures on rainier.

466
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,420
It's,
but it's great for a bone mass.

467
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,061
Oh,
okay.

468
00:20:43,061 --> 00:20:44,610
It's good for it.
Bone mass.

469
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,510
That makes sense.
Yeah.

470
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,430
It pushes you pushing you pushing.
Yeah.

471
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,310
I dig it

472
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:50,410
and by the way,
I'm not going to play competitive with

473
00:20:50,411 --> 00:20:51,520
them.
I'm going to hit with him.

474
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,290
Right.
Because he could probably beat me.

475
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,560
Also weighs about 70 pounds less than
me.

476
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:58,110
Yes.
So he can move better.

477
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Brian's been playing,
he's very spry.

478
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,230
He's his.
He takes his physical fitness very

479
00:21:02,231 --> 00:21:04,090
seriously.
He doesn't tell you about it.

480
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,170
Oh yeah.
Listen,

481
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,150
I know.
Yeah.

482
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:09,460
He gets very serious about half thing.
Everything.

483
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,700
It gets very serious.
You know what I'm saying?

484
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:16,570
Like he's never going to get,
he's never going to like commit to being

485
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:18,860
like a professional tennis player.
Right.

486
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,930
It'll get pretty serious about kind of
getting into tennis.

487
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,060
Who needs the stress?
Yeah.

488
00:21:28,061 --> 00:21:29,880
When no,
I'm saying it's like a good balance.

489
00:21:29,881 --> 00:21:33,160
I guess he's,
I get obsessed about things.

490
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,790
He gets obsessed about kind of getting
into things,

491
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,990
but then it doesn't go like those
started out doing through.

492
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,820
Exactly.
Exactly.

493
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:47,850
You are a follow through fucking
motherfucking follow through.

494
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,370
All purchases do as a walk around here
and go or look at you.

495
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,370
You're a fucking specimen.
You booked her.

496
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,310
You're a specimen.
Just trying to stay sane.

497
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,153
Jess.
Right.

498
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,980
Do you,
are you married?

499
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,260
You have a girlfriend,
you're married.

500
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,340
Yup.
Yeah.

501
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,520
Your wife must appreciate that.
What the,

502
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,950
the,
the physical illness.

503
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,910
You're a good man but,
but being looking over and going,

504
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:11,750
my husband's not a fat piece of shit.
He's a fit mother fucker and I'm going

505
00:22:11,751 --> 00:22:13,990
to fuck his brains out tonight.
Does she ever say that?

506
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,550
No,
not around me.

507
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,130
At least she should.
Maybe I should start bugging the house.

508
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,600
You Sharon.
When she says when I'm not there.

509
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,460
When you're not there,
I bet you that's what she says to her

510
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:22,390
friend.
He married.

511
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,060
Um,
I can't answer.

512
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,380
Hmm.
Yeah.

513
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,490
Okay.
Yeah.

514
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,260
I don't want to pressure you.
Don't pressure me.

515
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:31,060
That's like a,
I can't,

516
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,550
I can't talk about that right now.
Yeah.

517
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,140
That's probably good.
Transitions.

518
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,180
Healthy.
Yeah,

519
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,200
I like it.
Yeah.

520
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,240
Things are in flux there.
Fluxing I'm going to flux festival.

521
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:44,470
It's not bad.
Yeah,

522
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:44,990
it's,
no,

523
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,600
it's bad.
There's no winning.

524
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,670
Oh yeah.
There was no one in hand before.

525
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:52,000
I love my wife,
but I don't want to go home and I love

526
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,490
being alone,
but being alone blows.

527
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,940
So there's no winning.
There's no winning.

528
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm a sad young man,
but I'm really happy cause I'm

529
00:23:01,601 --> 00:23:03,520
functioning at a high level on eye
level.

530
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,700
I'm rising and rising up.
You know what I mean?

531
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:08,520
I'm,
I'm facing adversity had,

532
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,430
had,
had on,

533
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,070
but uh,
yeah,

534
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:13,420
my wife is a lovely woman.
Lovely woman.

535
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,100
Go down.
That's one of the things that are going

536
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,870
on the road.
You appreciate people when you come

537
00:23:16,871 --> 00:23:17,890
back.
Oh my God.

538
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:18,724
Yeah.
When you're with them.

539
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,530
I appreciate you buddy.
Yeah.

540
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,650
If you're there with them every day
staring at each other.

541
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:27,050
I mean,
no,

542
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,770
I don't care who it is.
Could be your best friend on the planet.

543
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,880
Too much time with somebody except for
rare exception.

544
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,010
Right?
Wow.

545
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:36,040
Is that bad?
Yeah.

546
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,290
It can be terrible.
Yeah.

547
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,520
We terrible.
Almost everybody.

548
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,140
People will,
you know,

549
00:23:41,141 --> 00:23:45,880
you need to be around variety in terms
of like different files.

550
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,350
Most of them.
By the way,

551
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,620
I don't stay home because I'm not like
I'm staying home because I want to avoid

552
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:56,510
experiences.

553
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,600
I like experiences and I'll go have an
experience,

554
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:01,640
but when I,
when I deem that experience,

555
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:05,150
like Jeff's party not good for me,
I leave.

556
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:05,871
Yeah.
But if I'm,

557
00:24:05,871 --> 00:24:09,320
if I'm having an experience that's new
and I'm digging it,

558
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,880
I'll stay.
Does that make sense?

559
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:11,631
Yeah.
Well,

560
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:12,490
you know what?
You liked?

561
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,780
56 years old,
man.

562
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,010
I know.
You're a man.

563
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,320
I'm a man.
I am a man.

564
00:24:18,321 --> 00:24:18,950
Yeah,
man.

565
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,970
I'm,
I'm Jeff Garlin and actualize command.

566
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,843
I'm an actual,
actually,

567
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,810
I'm aspiring to grow all the time.
That's when,

568
00:24:25,811 --> 00:24:28,460
that's my thing to be a wise man.
I aspire.

569
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:32,300
My goal is to be a wise man and I'll
never breach it.

570
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,990
Not that I'm be stupid,
but I'm saying it's always evolving.

571
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,063
I have a friend

572
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:39,040
and many,
many years ago it was at her house and

573
00:24:39,041 --> 00:24:42,760
she had the sign that said enlightenment
is possible in this lifetime.

574
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,920
When I saw that and I went,
Whoa,

575
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,710
wow,
that's,

576
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,710
that's a deep by bobby levels and
putting you at a higher place than you

577
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:53,560
are.
I agree with but true enlightenment.

578
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,570
I,
I'm just Kinda,

579
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:57,240
I'm not cynical.
I'm,

580
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,980
I'm have more of a critical eye.
There you go.

581
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,030
Right.
That's possible.

582
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:03,130
I'm not saying I've never seen it,
I've not seen it,

583
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,160
but it's like I'm not going to deem it
impossible.

584
00:25:06,161 --> 00:25:08,950
Cause then who am I and saw me saying
there's no god.

585
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,890
That's like me saying,
I'll tell you who killed Kennedy.

586
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
I don't know.
Right.

587
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:17,960
And it's also what exactly is
enlightenment and by whose standard by

588
00:25:17,961 --> 00:25:21,190
definition was.
So maybe if you have a very low standard

589
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,670
for enlightenment and your reach,
whatever that level is,

590
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,980
you go,
I did it in my lifetime.

591
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:27,814
Look at me.

592
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,470
If you are,
if you're smoking,

593
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:32,750
Endeca,
listen to great music and having

594
00:25:32,751 --> 00:25:36,830
fantastic sex after a great meal,
and then someone says,

595
00:25:36,831 --> 00:25:37,101
no,
no,

596
00:25:37,101 --> 00:25:38,780
no,
you're just supposed to meditate and

597
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,880
just sit in a room and,
and,

598
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,140
and,
you know,

599
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,640
be mindful.
Okay.

600
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,630
How about fuck you?

601
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,910
How about a big ball of fuck you.
Yeah.

602
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,420
By the way,
can we make that happen for me that I

603
00:25:49,421 --> 00:25:53,470
smoked some Minika listen to some music,
have some great sex after a great meal.

604
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,210
Totally.
It seems that this,

605
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,050
it can be done.
Should,

606
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,240
it can be done.
Garlin it should be done.

607
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,100
Yeah.
That's what a Tony says to me.

608
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:01,810
You're Jeff Garlin.
Tony Hawk.

609
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,890
Hinchcliffe yeah,
yeah,

610
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,120
he's right.
Yeah.

611
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:04,801
Well,
I,

612
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:06,880
I,
I tend to be,

613
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:10,390
I'm confident in my comedic skills,
but he should be.

614
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,290
Yeah.
Funny Guy.

615
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:12,370
Yeah.
But outside of that,

616
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:15,730
I am not lacking in confidence,
but leaving my house is,

617
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:16,660
like I said,
uh,

618
00:26:16,661 --> 00:26:18,130
uh,
quite the effort.

619
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,460
What I'm saying is like,
by whose definition is enlightenment?

620
00:26:21,461 --> 00:26:25,900
Because like say if you wanted to go to
a concert or you wanted to go to a great

621
00:26:25,901 --> 00:26:27,580
movie,
what an enlightened person.

622
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,110
Enjoy a great movie.

623
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,060
I would think my version of an
enlightened person would in fact enjoy a

624
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,190
great movie.
I,

625
00:26:35,191 --> 00:26:39,190
I've been enlightened to the concert.
I saw James Brown when he first got out

626
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:44,191
of prison and I've found that that that
performance he gave was the most

627
00:26:45,241 --> 00:26:49,350
enlightened performance I'd ever seen.
Was this when he was in the car chase,

628
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,270
was that that prison?
Yeah,

629
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:53,730
it was the,
what was the last prison he shot at cops

630
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:55,590
because I believe so.
Yeah.

631
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,550
That one was someone else used his
bathroom,

632
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,170
right?
Isn't that what happened?

633
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,700
Someone took a shit.
Don't know.

634
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,410
I know that he got in trouble with the
cops,

635
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,900
but maybe it was that,
I don't know.

636
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,620
There's a big difference,
but to someone using this toileting is

637
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:14,170
that he had gotten out of prison and
just the idea that James Brown was in

638
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:17,280
prison.
I think w maybe I remembering this

639
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:20,490
incorrectly,
but I think someone used his toilet and

640
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:25,380
then he got mad at that person and shot
at something like either shot the wall

641
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,243
or something.

642
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,020
I don't remember that story,
but I assume you're looking it up right

643
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:33,080
now,
so we'll find out.

644
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,400
I feel like he was in a high speed
chase.

645
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:37,770
They shot his tires out.
They shit.

646
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,910
I don't remember it this way.
Show something in a car though.

647
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,430
Maybe.
I'm pretty sure they shot his tires out

648
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:47,430
and he was driving around on my rims.
He had to have been doing a lot of

649
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,000
blowers and making that agitated.
You know what I mean?

650
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,750
No.
Normal Human Doug.

651
00:27:52,751 --> 00:27:55,920
And we're talking about James Brown.
Is that agitated?

652
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,860
I mean,
who gets that?

653
00:27:56,861 --> 00:28:00,200
And he was Finna fucking phenomenal.
When does he or she was young to state

654
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,270
chase that went up to 85 miles an hour,
involve 14 cars.

655
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:05,160
He said he didn't stop because he feared
for his life though.

656
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:07,500
I don't try to see why it started and I
don't see that.

657
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,360
I feel like that that's what started it.
He was,

658
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,920
he fired off a gun because someone used
his toilet,

659
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,420
by the way,
a two stage chase.

660
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm guessing he lived near the border.
I probably lived in what I was wacky

661
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:19,980
states.
We live it.

662
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,660
We live in Georgia.
Oh,

663
00:28:21,661 --> 00:28:23,070
okay.
Well maybe it's like Georgia,

664
00:28:23,071 --> 00:28:23,830
Florida.
Yeah.

665
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,100
It could be close to each other.
Georgia,

666
00:28:26,101 --> 00:28:27,300
Florida line.
It's not a band.

667
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,193
It is,
right.

668
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,940
It doesn't know.
Wheeler Walker make fun of them.

669
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:33,840
It says you've failed a,
a Beta pullover.

670
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,690
That's all it is.
But I'm pretty sure that's why they were

671
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:39,330
pulling them over.
I think they were going after him.

672
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,070
Um,
I might be wrong about that.

673
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,710
Maybe.
Maybe I'm confusing him with.

674
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,500
Okay.
Chuck Berry was the one who was filming

675
00:28:46,501 --> 00:28:48,570
people go into the bathroom.
Right.

676
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,370
I think he liked to go in the piece like
the PM ladies,

677
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:53,940
I'm pretty sure.

678
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,010
Interesting.
I'm pretty sure,

679
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,170
interesting,
genuine.

680
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:01,350
When I enjoy James Brown's music,
I'm not thinking about his car,

681
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,140
thinking about his other side,
you know,

682
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,120
let's say that your story.
Oh,

683
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,890
really?
It was right.

684
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,223
Oh,
here it goes.

685
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,030
Okay.
He carrying a deadly weapon in a public

686
00:29:12,031 --> 00:29:15,150
gathering and attempt to fleet perise
driving under the influence of drugs.

687
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,290
Okay.
He reportedly stormed into the insurance

688
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:22,590
company next to his office waiting a
shotgun and complaining.

689
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:25,860
That's trainers.
We using his bathroom as time reported

690
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,720
for six miles.
There you go.

691
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,050
Are you kidding me?
Years later this episode would frame the

692
00:29:34,051 --> 00:29:37,260
2014 j brown bio pic.
Okay.

693
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,470
88 on up.
I'm guessing that I saw him after this

694
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,100
cause it was right after

695
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,180
that.
It would be,

696
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,210
uh,
it would be late eighties,

697
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,750
early nineties.
Jesus Christ.

698
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,710
He did six years.
Yeah.

699
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,910
He was in there for a while.
Six fucking years.

700
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:54,550
Yeah.
How about just sober him up?

701
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:59,380
He was on PCP pay.
They gave him a year for each mile.

702
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,160
He drove on his Mac.
Rumors of a PCP habit already surfaced

703
00:30:03,161 --> 00:30:06,340
by the time his erratic behavior came to
a head in September.

704
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,820
Wow.
PCPS,

705
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,900
a tricky one.
Sang in the prison choir.

706
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,480
I bet he did.
Shit.

707
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,330
Imagine you'd go to jail for like
stealing the car and you're fucking,

708
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:18,270
sally is James Brown.
Like,

709
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,320
hey buddy,
what do you want to do?

710
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,310
Something that's a hell of a story.
Yeah.

711
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,760
Help him write some songs,
you know,

712
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,250
get on up.
Yeah.

713
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,540
Did you ever see,
um,

714
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,160
when he opened up for,
um,

715
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:35,440
the Mohammed Ali fight with George
Foreman documentary?

716
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,120
Holy Shit.
Was that incredible?

717
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:37,900
That was incredible.

718
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,430
Yeah.
Incredible.

719
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,520
Yeah.
He had so much power.

720
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,990
There was something about him,
man.

721
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:46,630
He would get on deck age.
It was just power.

722
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,450
Give you an idea.
How much power prince wished for that

723
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:50,290
power fuck yet.
Well,

724
00:30:50,291 --> 00:30:52,270
prince had it,
but he had another way,

725
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,570
different way.
But prince looked up yet.

726
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,750
Oh No.
James Brown was ridiculous and I looked

727
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,500
up to it.
Yeah.

728
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,160
I don't have any musical talent.
It just tells you what a waste all of

729
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:06,040
this was because Elvis had that power
and he didn't use it.

730
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:11,290
He had it early on and then w w he could
never dance like James Brown though.

731
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,900
Or if he did,
he never showed it.

732
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:15,730
It would be different.
It's a different kind of power if he

733
00:31:15,731 --> 00:31:18,580
just took and harness.
Here it is.

734
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:21,580
Look at this.
Look at his dress to get an ice chest,

735
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,990
the fucking pants,
and they show you is God damn.

736
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,070
Drop it down doing splits.
I know.

737
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:29,140
No,
he was not human.

738
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,273
And by the way,
he,

739
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:34,030
he's not even really flexible enough to
do a full split and yet he's still

740
00:31:34,031 --> 00:31:35,950
dropping down on stage.
You know,

741
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:39,850
he was wearing a turtle neck that night
and I said to him,

742
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,810
cut that baby out.
Let's leave a little bit.

743
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,220
Let's put your initials on there.
I think that that was done in advance

744
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,590
what the girls was hanging around with
fucking shame around.

745
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,070
Oh yeah,
look at these giant ass band.

746
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,460
I don't envy those people.
Do you know when you see people with

747
00:31:57,461 --> 00:31:59,500
bands,
Torin got all those people,

748
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,170
all those working pieces have to fall
into place.

749
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,910
Yeah,
they got all that though.

750
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,890
Yeah,
but God damn would a performance.

751
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:08,260
When I saw him and I saw him,
it blew my mind.

752
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:09,610
It literally blew my mind.
Well,

753
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,740
what's interesting too is that,
you know,

754
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,850
prince who died of painkillers,
he died from fentanyl.

755
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:20,020
He blew his hips out.
Dancing like that was,

756
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,280
that was the thing,
you know,

757
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,890
and that that apparently is a very
common thing.

758
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,010
My friend Maynard Maynard Keenan from
tool lead Santa tool,

759
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,030
he just recently had his hip replaced
and he was doing,

760
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,860
he's,
he's big into Jujitsu,

761
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:37,890
loves Jujitsu and he was having a really
hard time doing certain things.

762
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,040
So I went to a doctor to see what's
going on

763
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,450
with his hip and they're like,
dude,

764
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:42,940
your hip is gone.
Sign.

765
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,560
Like it's just two hours.
He functioning at a high level.

766
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:45,910
Yeah,
yeah,

767
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:46,743
yeah,
he's fine.

768
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:50,960
That's the hip replacement is one of the
most unusual ones in terms of like its

769
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:55,961
ability to restore you back to a,
a fairly normal state other than a bride

770
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:59,210
being a comedian as delightful.
And we don't have to do any of that

771
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,010
shit.
No,

772
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,230
there's no up.
And by the way,

773
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,050
when you see someone moving around like
that on stage,

774
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,350
I will bet you every penny I have,
they're not funny.

775
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,990
Callen moves a lot on stage.
He's very funny.

776
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,800
I hate as a move,
like like 20 throws kicked upstairs in

777
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,770
the,
in the telly room and know the Improv

778
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:20,990
upstairs.
You know that Green Room thing?

779
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,930
Okay.
There's a monitor on stage with a thing

780
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,660
and I will turn to our own weather go
funny.

781
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:32,030
Not Funny because like I can watch and
tell how,

782
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:37,100
whether the comedy is coming to them or
whether they're pushing it and most of

783
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:41,270
the move around people are pushing it.
But Jim Carrey was a move around guy.

784
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:44,780
He was always really funny,
but move around in a different sort of

785
00:33:44,781 --> 00:33:45,910
way.
Characters.

786
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,550
Well there's exceptions to all stuff
like that.

787
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,820
The all things,
but in this sort of way I'm done.

788
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:55,670
But when someone just stands there and
talks and then they're doing some sort

789
00:33:55,671 --> 00:33:57,200
of movement,
it's not good.

790
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,880
Jim Carrey,
there was a purpose,

791
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,550
right Brian?
It's part of who we is.

792
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,480
That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about people that just

793
00:34:05,481 --> 00:34:10,481
oversell shit by physicalizing.
What should be just funny the way you

794
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:13,580
say it,
not even what you're saying.

795
00:34:13,581 --> 00:34:16,700
The way you say it,
Thompson or calls it dance moves it.

796
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:19,520
His dance moves thompson girls.

797
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,640
Right.
I'm sick.

798
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,130
Girl is funny.
He's a genius.

799
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,530
He uh,
I used to call it English putting like

800
00:34:24,531 --> 00:34:26,000
English on the two bar.
Yes.

801
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,070
Totally unnecessary.
As is better dance moves.

802
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,980
Damn moves.
And that's what I'm talking about.

803
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:36,820
So Jim Carrey and Brian Cowen do not
have danced with.

804
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,270
Right.
They just are funny.

805
00:34:38,271 --> 00:34:39,290
And they also move.
Yeah,

806
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:42,890
there's a,
there's a reason for their moving moves.

807
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,000
Oh,
come on man.

808
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,710
And you're always so funny.
Years ago,

809
00:34:45,711 --> 00:34:49,850
I remember anytime I saw someone miming
having sex,

810
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,080
you know,
pumping air,

811
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,850
I would just go.
Not Funny.

812
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:54,320
No,
it was just like,

813
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:56,630
it was a sign of like,
well what if there's a bit where you

814
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:59,690
have to mime pumping,
pumping air.

815
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:04,100
There's gotta be a bit pumping air.
You mean like it's gotta be some,

816
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,420
yeah,
some bits.

817
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,550
What?
But who doesn't know what that looks

818
00:35:07,551 --> 00:35:08,630
like?
Why do you need to pump?

819
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,430
Maybe there's a reason it's something.
Unless like you're imitating someone

820
00:35:13,431 --> 00:35:15,720
having a heart attack pumping,
right.

821
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,960
Or you know,
if there,

822
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,120
if the content is about your
physicality,

823
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,480
that's not dancing.
Dancing's when you,

824
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,760
when you put like English,
like when you,

825
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,910
when you're doing this to accentuate
what you're saying,

826
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,650
it's like screw that.
We don't need that.

827
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,480
Well you ever go to open mic nights?
I used to do them up until recently.

828
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,770
Really?
I would just show up and

829
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:40,200
say,
can I go up and do 10 you know,

830
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:42,450
and,
and what was really fun was when the

831
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,370
person who had them didn't know who I
was.

832
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,250
Oh that's great.
And then I watched as other people

833
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:50,430
explained and it was cool cause I didn't
have an attitude,

834
00:35:50,431 --> 00:35:53,240
you know,
and I would do my sets and the audience

835
00:35:53,241 --> 00:35:55,170
has an open,
Mike nights are really,

836
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,020
they're terrible.
Lot of times,

837
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,160
yeah,
they're there to see their friends or

838
00:35:59,161 --> 00:36:03,120
they're tired or whatever or they've
been beaten down by totally unfunny

839
00:36:03,121 --> 00:36:05,970
shit.
Totally unfunny shit over and over and

840
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,350
over again.
So yes,

841
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:11,340
up until about four or five years ago,
I used to go to open my,

842
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:15,270
what's fascinating about open Mike
nights is you're watching people try to

843
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:18,480
figure out how to be funny.
Like you're watching people like,

844
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,500
and you go to the store like tonight and
you'll,

845
00:36:21,501 --> 00:36:22,500
you'll,
you'll go there.

846
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:27,500
It's going to be a packed house.
It's all Chris Delea and fucking Andrew

847
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,310
Santina.
No and Allie Wong,

848
00:36:30,311 --> 00:36:31,710
it's all killers.
You know,

849
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:34,110
and you,
you're seeing high level comedy over and

850
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:36,810
over again.
And so you get you into that vibe and

851
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:38,220
you're like,
oh this is a great place to be.

852
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,180
But if you go to an open mic night,
you're seeing this like primordial ooze.

853
00:36:42,181 --> 00:36:45,660
You're seeing single celled organisms,
things that you really shouldn't be

854
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,550
seeing sometimes.
You know,

855
00:36:47,551 --> 00:36:49,140
because every now and then you see a
little,

856
00:36:49,141 --> 00:36:52,410
I explained to people,
get as much state when you start,

857
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:55,440
get as much stage time as you can
without people seeing you.

858
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,870
That's good too.
That's very good advice.

859
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,050
But you need to go on stage over and
over and over again.

860
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,660
But don't go on stage at any popular
places.

861
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:08,160
Go onstage at the suckiest cause you
only learn from when you suck.

862
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,420
That's a big part of it for sure.
That's why I really admired,

863
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,410
uh,
Charlie Murphy.

864
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:18,790
Cause Charlie Murphy was essentially a
famous open miker and well when he

865
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:22,110
started mean when he started,
he'd never done standup comedy ever.

866
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:25,860
And then he was just a really funny
actor who is the brother of one of the

867
00:37:25,861 --> 00:37:29,280
greatest comics of all time who got on
the Chappelle show and then started

868
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,110
doing stand up.
And you know,

869
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:34,680
Charlie would just just fucking do it.
Just go and do it.

870
00:37:34,681 --> 00:37:37,110
And you know,
he had some rough sets too when he was

871
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,510
famous,
like really famous.

872
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,110
Are you think when I did,
did those things that I didn't eat it

873
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,490
plenty of times open mike nights
everybody.

874
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,860
But,
but what I had was I was in control of

875
00:37:49,861 --> 00:37:52,680
myself and it didn't fall apart.
Right.

876
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,250
If you're an amateur would fall apart.
Yeah,

877
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,010
it does.

878
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:58,690
It doesn't mean I did well,
but of course I remember,

879
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,640
I remember one time dice came into the
store,

880
00:38:02,641 --> 00:38:05,370
this is probably four or five years ago,
maybe five years ago.

881
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,060
And uh,
he came up to me,

882
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,580
goes,
oh,

883
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,170
go up after you,
you know,

884
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,790
it was very respectful,
very nice.

885
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,751
And I said,
no,

886
00:38:12,751 --> 00:38:15,510
I really want to follow you.
I want to see what that's like.

887
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,570
I've never followed you.
Please go up there and go for broke.

888
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,700
Go for fucking broke.
How long are you doing?

889
00:38:20,701 --> 00:38:21,451
He goes,
oh,

890
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:22,560
maybe a half hour.
I go,

891
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,420
great.
Go up there for a half hour.

892
00:38:24,421 --> 00:38:27,570
I've got nowhere to be.
I'm going to watch and the I want you to

893
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,870
just to fucking hold nothing back.
And then I went up after him.

894
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:33,840
You know how I did fine,
didn't do good,

895
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,010
didn't do fine

896
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,400
because I knew how to handle myself,
my professionalism,

897
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,910
the craft of what I know one out,
but there's no following that with what

898
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:48,010
I do,
which is totally different.

899
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,960
And having the audience go,
oh,

900
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:52,240
this takes it to a whole new place.
No.

901
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:54,850
Did you ever listen to the day the
laughter died?

902
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,300
Rick Rubin's with them.
Yeah.

903
00:38:57,301 --> 00:38:57,790
Yeah,
yeah.

904
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,860
Fucking phenomenal.
Great album.

905
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,670
Just eating shit,
right.

906
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,620
Chill hours.
He showed up at danger fields for people

907
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:07,240
who don't know.
It's literally,

908
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,910
I will never forget,
I was just starting out.

909
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,550
I think he did this look this up when
that was,

910
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:16,270
I want to say it was like 1989 1990 no,
it was after that.

911
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,500
It was fairly early.
It was fairly early because I was very

912
00:39:20,501 --> 00:39:22,870
young in my career.
It might've been then cause I was still

913
00:39:22,871 --> 00:39:24,030
living in Boston.
No,

914
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:26,770
no,
it might've been then because 89 yeah,

915
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:29,860
because I was thinking about me living
here now,

916
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,800
but it was the,
it had came out the first time I lived

917
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:33,130
here.

918
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:37,660
Well I was living in Boston and I was
just starting out and there was a great

919
00:39:37,661 --> 00:39:40,470
comedian named Mike Donovan who to this
day,

920
00:39:40,471 --> 00:39:42,190
he's one of the funniest guys I've ever
seen in my life.

921
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,550
And uh,
Mike Donovan was laughing to the point

922
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:50,551
where he couldn't breathe at dice doing
this set while he was doing fucking

923
00:39:51,731 --> 00:39:56,731
stadiums.
I mean dice was doing enormous Nassau

924
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,810
Coliseum.
What's in the bowl,

925
00:39:58,811 --> 00:40:00,230
bitch?
Oh,

926
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,570
20,000 people.
He was the biggest comedian of all time

927
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,860
and he just decides to show up at danger
fields in New York city randomly.

928
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:10,360
And I'll come Monday and a Tuesday
night.

929
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,010
It doesn't tell anybody he's going to be
there.

930
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,160
I mean there's 1320 people in the crowd.
He records two different sets and he has

931
00:40:18,491 --> 00:40:20,920
no material.
I mean fucking none.

932
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:25,690
He's making things up as he goes along
and people are getting angry at him and

933
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:30,490
they're walking out and he did a bit
about Richard Nixon about how he eats

934
00:40:30,491 --> 00:40:33,880
ass and when he eats ass he does it like
Richard Nixon.

935
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,930
He was like,
Oh,

936
00:40:34,931 --> 00:40:38,590
I love this fucking house.
He was doing this Richard Nixon

937
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:41,800
impression of eating ass and for
whatever reason Mike Dunn,

938
00:40:41,801 --> 00:40:43,720
Vin thought it was the funniest thing
he'd ever seen in his life.

939
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,390
He was wheezing,
like couldn't breathe,

940
00:40:46,391 --> 00:40:49,330
talking about dice doing this impression
and I was like,

941
00:40:49,331 --> 00:40:53,020
wow,
this is like comedy for Comedians.

942
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:54,790
But for the people that were in the
audience,

943
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,810
like a guy got up,
he goes,

944
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:57,670
you're about as funny as our glass of
milk.

945
00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:00,700
The Guy said that to him and then left.
That's one of the best things when the

946
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:03,210
album,
these people from like Kansas getting

947
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:03,941
your about.
It's funny,

948
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:07,390
as our class on milk and walking off and
dice shitting on them,

949
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,310
but the two to have them mindset to be
at the,

950
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:17,370
not just the top of his game but
literally the top of standup ever.

951
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,310
No one before him had ever sold out
Madison Square Garden multiple nights in

952
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:28,210
a row the way he did.
I mean guys have done it since then.

953
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,750
You know,
Dane and Louis and this been a bunch of

954
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:35,660
guys who've Aziz,
but no one did it like he did then.

955
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:40,690
He was the first ever to do that and to
do that and then to record these fucking

956
00:41:41,301 --> 00:41:43,640
awful sets and then put it,
uh,

957
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,700
we'll go on a fucking pool.
I guaranteed that was Rick Ruben's

958
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:49,970
ideas.
Do you think so?

959
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,590
Without a doubt.
But you know,

960
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,500
dice,
dice,

961
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:54,180
dice,
and I know Rick Rubin.

962
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:58,570
I bet it was both of their ideas.
Well maybe he didn't fight Rick Rubin up

963
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,220
to ask Rick Ruben next time I see him.
Yeah,

964
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,430
asked,
never asked him that.

965
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:03,890
But that sounds to me like Rick Rubin
going,

966
00:42:03,891 --> 00:42:05,570
let's do this.
Interesting.

967
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:08,720
Yeah.
But it was such a crazy bold move.

968
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,410
I remember thinking at the time,
because I was terrible in 1989 when it

969
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:15,260
came out and I was just like confused.
Like how does one do that?

970
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,860
Like one is so confident they release
something that suck.

971
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:20,550
Cause I had as,
I was a,

972
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,180
when I was 19,
it was me and my girlfriend,

973
00:42:23,181 --> 00:42:28,181
Mark De mi and Marta were sitting in my
car and I had a cassette player and

974
00:42:28,851 --> 00:42:33,140
we're listening to dice.
It was just called dice and w crying,

975
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:34,040
laughing,
crying,

976
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,930
laughing.
It was before I'd ever done standup.

977
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,760
And I remember thinking,
Wow,

978
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,810
this guy is fucking something.
Like what,

979
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:41,730
what?
Like the,

980
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,800
the,
the amount of power that he had like on

981
00:42:44,801 --> 00:42:47,660
stage.
And these are the roars from the crowd

982
00:42:47,661 --> 00:42:51,080
and we're sitting in my car laughing our
asses off to this seat.

983
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,120
This cassette wasn't even cd.
Um,

984
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:57,260
that couple years later he decided I'm
just going to put out something that's

985
00:42:57,261 --> 00:42:58,094
sucks.

986
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:01,610
The day the comedy died.
Did they?

987
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:02,670
Laughter died.
Yeah.

988
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,590
And he's got like one of them fucking
paper Boi hats on the cover.

989
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:08,030
Oh,
it's a,

990
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:12,290
it's a little old man boy.
And there's the little picture of him on

991
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:13,210
there.
Is that what it is?

992
00:43:13,211 --> 00:43:13,660
I can,
yeah.

993
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,640
Small picture I think or maybe it's a
big picture of him.

994
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,920
There it is right there.
I remember was the big picture.

995
00:43:18,921 --> 00:43:20,390
We should get a Oh yeah.
So,

996
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,090
so,
but is small in comparison to the actual

997
00:43:23,091 --> 00:43:24,100
CD?
Yeah.

998
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:27,290
See if we can get Jamie.
Um,

999
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,520
let's get a framed copy of that and put
it on the wall somewhere.

1000
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:34,050
Is it released as an album?
I Dunno.

1001
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:36,980
Guarantee Image.
I guarantee there's vinyl guaranteed.

1002
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,510
Let's get,
find it.

1003
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,220
See if we could buy it.
And Vinyl,

1004
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,880
look on Ebay right now for the day they
did it again.

1005
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,130
Get it three years later.

1006
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,840
I've seen him do that at the store.
I've seen them go up late night at the

1007
00:43:56,841 --> 00:43:57,381
store.
I'm like,

1008
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:57,761
look,
good.

1009
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:02,761
You look at you over there and just
start talking shit to people like mean.

1010
00:44:02,831 --> 00:44:04,970
What does he wear?
Weightlifting gloves whenever.

1011
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,220
He wasn't like touching people's hands.
Is that what it is?

1012
00:44:07,221 --> 00:44:08,054
Yeah,
yeah,

1013
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,310
yeah.
And Big Jay oakerson whereas

1014
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:12,470
weightlifting gloves in Oman.
He does.

1015
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

1016
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:15,831
That's great.
Yeah.

1017
00:44:15,831 --> 00:44:18,020
I was trying to get the two of them
together in a podcast,

1018
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:19,670
but scheduling wise,
it never really worked out.

1019
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,810
Shaking the photo on the final,
Oh,

1020
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,610
for 400 bucks on Amazon.
Oh,

1021
00:44:25,611 --> 00:44:27,170
by that shit.
No,

1022
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,910
no.
We're going to frame hundred bucks.

1023
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,530
I'll go to dice.
He might have it.

1024
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:32,120
Yeah.

1025
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:32,790
Guarantees.
Got It.

1026
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,200
Hey,

1027
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,910
You're pay for lunch.
I'll give you the,

1028
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,200
the,
the album.

1029
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,600
Have you ever seen his instagram?
You a go to dices instagram?

1030
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,980
No,
it's hilarious.

1031
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,300
It's just so random.
It's like an older rich,

1032
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:48,000
famous guy who does whatever the fuck he
wants.

1033
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:51,180
Opposed to had coffee or lunch with them
a million times.

1034
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:54,590
I had never had.
It's one of those things never happen.

1035
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,190
Yeah.
Yeah.

1036
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,024
He,
um,

1037
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:02,150
instagram is him like Wa with a Gold's
gym tee shirt on with crazy sunglasses

1038
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,200
and he'll do like these little sketches,
but there's so random and weird like him

1039
00:45:07,201 --> 00:45:09,780
talking to a girl,
like maybe we should do something later

1040
00:45:09,781 --> 00:45:10,710
in the girl's like,
okay,

1041
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,970
like click on this,
play this.

1042
00:45:11,971 --> 00:45:13,590
This is like his,
this is his whole thing.

1043
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:24,810
I was thinking about it.
We should do that.

1044
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,180
Can you cook dinner for her?
Here's the question.

1045
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:35,080
What are you,
what's your name?

1046
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,500
Nicole.
Nicole.

1047
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,281
All right.
I'll call.

1048
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:40,660
I'll call you.
I've got to go and take care.

1049
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:45,803
Oh,
it's the end of it.

1050
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:47,900
Afterwards he goes,
he's got another one,

1051
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:51,530
a followup when he gets mad at himself
for not doing anything about it.

1052
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,150
Like go to the next video.

1053
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,050
Yeah.

1054
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,730
That's cited.
There's another there.

1055
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,300
Play this way.
What a beautiful night.

1056
00:46:01,301 --> 00:46:02,134
Huh?

1057
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,053
Beautiful.

1058
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,000
It's,
it's just this little beautiful night.

1059
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,980
Eleanor Carrigan.

1060
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,760
Yeah,
they're so random.

1061
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,840
The videos or I guess the text in that
video was like,

1062
00:46:19,841 --> 00:46:21,340
I should've done something was wrong
with me.

1063
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,750
Yeah,
it's,

1064
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,863
but this is him.

1065
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:25,590
Why did I leave?
I'm so dumb.

1066
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,670
But they're so random.
It's like,

1067
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:32,720
what is he doing?
He's just been dice.

1068
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:37,170
He used to do that at the store.
He used to have comics do these little

1069
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:38,370
sketches is,
okay,

1070
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:42,210
you're going to run through the door
there and you're going to knock him over

1071
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:44,010
and you're going to go,
what the fuck?

1072
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,053
Okay,
go.

1073
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:48,720
And the guy would do it and you run into
the door and knock the other guy over

1074
00:46:48,721 --> 00:46:49,790
and go,
what the fuck up?

1075
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:50,970
Perfect.
Do it again.

1076
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,830
And he would just,
he would just film,

1077
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:54,900
this was like vhs tape,
you know,

1078
00:46:54,901 --> 00:46:58,440
I go old school one and then he would
edit it together himself,

1079
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:03,240
but he did nothing with it.
And this was like dice was giant,

1080
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,020
just fucking top of the world giant.
And this is what he's doing to amuse

1081
00:47:07,021 --> 00:47:09,720
himself.
The comics would just do it.

1082
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,640
Oh Jesus Christ.
You're just so happy.

1083
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:14,610
Dice is talking to you.
He's the reason why I started doing the

1084
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:16,980
road.
I would just do the store all the time.

1085
00:47:16,981 --> 00:47:17,820
It was constant.
The store.

1086
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:19,980
One time were in the bag goes,
it's funny,

1087
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,320
you know you should do the row.
I go,

1088
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:23,010
yeah.
He goes,

1089
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:23,821
hey,
he goes,

1090
00:47:23,821 --> 00:47:26,370
you don't want to rely on these fucking
assholes for money.

1091
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,680
He goes,
you could fucking do whatever you want.

1092
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:29,980
Go through road.
I was like yeah,

1093
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,520
why don't I do the road cause I was just
doing tv shows and then you know,

1094
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:36,490
do you do on TV shows?
You kind of trapped in this,

1095
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:40,180
this is how you make your living.
You got to kind of always be acting and

1096
00:47:40,181 --> 00:47:43,150
always be going on auditions.
I was like yeah I was cause I wasn't

1097
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,130
making,
you don't make real money at the store.

1098
00:47:45,131 --> 00:47:47,020
You make like 15 bucks a set or whatever
you make.

1099
00:47:47,021 --> 00:47:50,800
You know I,
I've spent one year I'd ever collected a

1100
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:53,710
check and then they'd ever had them
again at the store.

1101
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,573
Yeah.
I probably,

1102
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,380
I'm guessing that the number of sets I
did probably about $2,500 $5,000

1103
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,510
probably donated.
Donate it back to the club.

1104
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,550
Yeah.
Tony hit it back to the clubs and not

1105
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:06,520
donated to any charity by on behalf of
the store.

1106
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,720
Yeah.
No,

1107
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,850
not a charity.
You're donating to the charity of the

1108
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:12,130
store.
I don't care.

1109
00:48:12,370 --> 00:48:13,203
I don't care.
Yeah,

1110
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,430
that's good.
Good.

1111
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,680
Good donation.
Yeah,

1112
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:21,340
that's a,
a place is a fascinating place really.

1113
00:48:21,341 --> 00:48:26,341
I was gone for seven years and you know,
I've been back for four now and it's,

1114
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,360
uh,
it is,

1115
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:30,970
uh,
I love the original room.

1116
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:31,951
Oh,
it's incredible.

1117
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:35,060
It's the room that's got it going.
The main wildlife,

1118
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,250
all three.
I don't,

1119
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:37,840
they're all different.
The belly rooms.

1120
00:48:37,841 --> 00:48:39,520
Okay.
And the main room,

1121
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:40,210
Eric,

1122
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,040
by the way,
the main room performing in the main

1123
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,900
room does not bother me.
I hate it.

1124
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:46,490
The green room really hate it.
Why?

1125
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,750
No cane piano in the middle of the room
and the best piano.

1126
00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:52,600
Oh yeah.
The point being is most of those people,

1127
00:48:52,601 --> 00:48:53,890
I don't want to see,
oh,

1128
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,320
hey around back there.
Yeah.

1129
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:56,270
They just steer it.
I know.

1130
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:01,150
There's just such a negative vibe.
I think that there's a lot of comedians

1131
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,370
at play there that are a big bowl of
dead weight.

1132
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,510
Wow.
Yeah.

1133
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:06,430
Wow.
But there's a lot on the names,

1134
00:49:06,431 --> 00:49:08,680
but Baba,
if there's a lot that are joyful and

1135
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:11,800
great,
and I dig and I like watching and my

1136
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:15,130
favorite thing to do is laugh at my
fellow Comedians,

1137
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:17,890
but on the flip side,
some people just,

1138
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:18,760
man,
they're there.

1139
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:22,060
Their presence just depresses me.
Interesting.

1140
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:23,350
Yeah.
I don't feel that.

1141
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:27,150
Okay.
Maybe do an impression of

1142
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,660
just mimed my,
no,

1143
00:49:32,661 --> 00:49:33,221
no,
no,

1144
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:33,731
no,
no,

1145
00:49:33,731 --> 00:49:34,750
no,
no,

1146
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,520
no.
But some really,

1147
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:37,810
I think,
yeah,

1148
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,210
because you know the thing,
when I started in comedy,

1149
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:43,600
which is 82 working through comedians,
really,

1150
00:49:43,601 --> 00:49:46,540
we're a group that stuck together.

1151
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:48,090
You don't think that's the case now?
No.

1152
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,620
I think that bridge,
I think for the past,

1153
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:55,950
I think it started changing in late
nineties two thousands to where it was

1154
00:49:57,461 --> 00:50:00,400
every man for himself and a lot of
people,

1155
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:03,280
it wasn't like,
you're part of this fraternity.

1156
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,110
It was like,
fuck you,

1157
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:06,430
I'm going to do this.
You know?

1158
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:11,140
My thing with competition is I go do
your thing.

1159
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:12,670
If the audience digs you more,
great.

1160
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:14,670
If I'm auditioning and you're
auditioning,

1161
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,050
go beat me in the room.
I don't give a crap,

1162
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:22,450
but there's such a competitiveness.
And I know that's part of why Eddie

1163
00:50:22,451 --> 00:50:26,350
doesn't do spots because Eddie Murphy,
Eddie Murphy,

1164
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,980
because when I work with them,

1165
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,270
I would say,
why don't you go?

1166
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,380
He,
he'd say,

1167
00:50:30,381 --> 00:50:32,630
the,
the looks that I get and the vibe that I

1168
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:34,970
get from comics,
it's not pleasant.

1169
00:50:34,971 --> 00:50:36,710
And I go,
I know exactly what he was talking

1170
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:38,450
about.
That's so weird.

1171
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,480
I have the exact opposite feeling about
comedy now and about a particular,

1172
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:47,270
like the store and like the comradery of
that place.

1173
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:48,320
I don't,
I don't get it,

1174
00:50:48,321 --> 00:50:50,600
by the way.
I dig a lot of people there,

1175
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,430
but the people who I dig know I dig them
right.

1176
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:54,630
And I,
and the other one,

1177
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:56,360
so I don't dig,
don't know anything.

1178
00:50:56,361 --> 00:51:01,280
It's not like I spent hours,
but there's lots of guys and gals that

1179
00:51:01,281 --> 00:51:05,150
are great,
but so plenty of them that like please

1180
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,400
step away.
I was just having a conversation about

1181
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:10,850
this with a friend of mine recently who
was living for a while and the place

1182
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:11,684
that he hated.

1183
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:15,470
And he was saying that if you're in a
place where everyone's negative,

1184
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:18,950
you really kind of forget that people
can be positive without a doubt.

1185
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:21,650
Yeah.
So why should I leave the comedy store

1186
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,620
and at least half of the Times I play,
they're leaving.

1187
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:27,650
They're driving home feeling like not
positive.

1188
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,140
That's so weird.
Whereas by the way,

1189
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:33,410
I sometimes now arrange it.
The only set that I do at the comedy

1190
00:51:33,411 --> 00:51:38,411
store now is I sometimes will close the
seven o'clock original room show.

1191
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:41,900
Uh,
cause there's no one after me.

1192
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:44,390
So if I'm five minutes long,
no one's giving you crap.

1193
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,270
Right.
And they've already seen the whole show.

1194
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:50,660
There's no it just,
and I can do that zip and do it and get

1195
00:51:50,661 --> 00:51:53,390
the hell out.
I'll do a benefit in the,

1196
00:51:53,391 --> 00:51:56,630
in the main room or like I did,
uh,

1197
00:51:57,170 --> 00:51:58,610
Tony Show,
right.

1198
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,990
Killed Tony killed.
Yeah.

1199
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:02,960
We're gonna bring into the fold Jeff
Garlin bring wedding to the fitting you

1200
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:06,470
into the fold of the nice people.
By the way,

1201
00:52:06,471 --> 00:52:09,410
I know the Nice,
we have nice conversations with him,

1202
00:52:09,411 --> 00:52:13,700
but the other people are always,
they're hovering hangovers.

1203
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:17,000
I don't like I'll go,
I don't like a hover over is a stopover.

1204
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,020
And Ted is brutal when you're having a
good conversation and if you're not into

1205
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:23,360
a group,
if your group is not about making

1206
00:52:23,361 --> 00:52:24,300
people,
like,

1207
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,780
I don't care whether your political,
social,

1208
00:52:26,781 --> 00:52:31,781
w w how you do your comedy.
But if your ultimate goal isn't to bring

1209
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:37,370
joy into peoples lives,
what's the purpose?

1210
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:42,170
If it's not about the laughs and joy.
And so I find,

1211
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,250
here's the thing,
I don't dig lot of ego running around

1212
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,460
the store when I'm there.
And most of the people I don't like have

1213
00:52:49,461 --> 00:52:50,510
the biggest egos.

1214
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:54,530
Do you think that the most common you
because you're a very accomplished guy,

1215
00:52:54,531 --> 00:52:56,480
so maybe that's why you're getting that
weird vibe.

1216
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,850
Okay.
I've been told that before,

1217
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,770
but if I thought that that would be
weird.

1218
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,380
So I don't maybe,
well that's cause you know,

1219
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,000
there's a great line,
I'm not an,

1220
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:08,480
I'm not an alcoholic,
but I do know this line from the

1221
00:53:08,481 --> 00:53:11,600
program,
which is what you think of me is none of

1222
00:53:11,601 --> 00:53:13,850
my business,
which I love.

1223
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,070
That's a great perspective.
Great perspective.

1224
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:18,680
So what they think of me is none of my
business,

1225
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,780
I just know what they're putting out
there.

1226
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:22,281
That's all.
Yeah.

1227
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,440
I think sometimes people will look at
you and go,

1228
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:25,740
well here's a guy who has been on

1229
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,100
some of the all time greatest television
shows ever.

1230
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:29,890
You know,
your,

1231
00:53:29,890 --> 00:53:33,990
your guy that's got a massive,
like your,

1232
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:35,250
your,
your resume,

1233
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:37,910
your accomplishments as a comic and
performers.

1234
00:53:37,911 --> 00:53:42,911
It's very enviable.
So maybe perhaps a city like this myself

1235
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:46,170
as a generous guy,
I'm every level.

1236
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,410
I like being generous and I like helping
comics,

1237
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,120
you know,
sticking my hand out,

1238
00:53:51,121 --> 00:53:56,121
doing what I can to help.
So I don't feel that I put anything that

1239
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:58,470
they should be fearful of out.
No,

1240
00:53:58,471 --> 00:54:02,310
but I think it's their own issue.
I mean I remember when I was yes,

1241
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,650
but I was starting out.
I would get real uncomfortable when I

1242
00:54:04,651 --> 00:54:06,510
was around really famous people,
I'd be like,

1243
00:54:06,511 --> 00:54:08,910
wow,
this feels weird to be around this guy

1244
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:10,800
in real life.
I mean I get that.

1245
00:54:10,801 --> 00:54:14,310
That can be you.
You've always been very,

1246
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:16,450
very friendly.
That's what I want to do.

1247
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:20,550
I like to be a warm,
thoughtful person who most of the time

1248
00:54:20,551 --> 00:54:23,460
prefers to stay at home.
If I'm going to go out,

1249
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:25,590
if I'm going to go to the farmer's
market,

1250
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:29,310
if I'm going to go to the comedy store,
I'm prepared to talk to people,

1251
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,920
take pictures of people,
be warmed to people,

1252
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:34,980
engage with people.
Cause if I don't want that,

1253
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,120
I stay home.
Right?

1254
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,030
And so if I'm in a negative,
bad mood,

1255
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:42,930
um,
I really will go do my set and get out.

1256
00:54:42,931 --> 00:54:45,960
But that doesn't happen very often.
But I'll stay home.

1257
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:47,490
Yeah.
That's why you need that downtime,

1258
00:54:47,491 --> 00:54:49,980
right?
Cause you gotta be able to recharge.

1259
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:51,780
Gotta be able to recharge.
And I never,

1260
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,110
I used to not allow myself that I used
to be worked so hard.

1261
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,600
I was reading this article yesterday
about Tom Cruise,

1262
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:00,420
about Tom Cruise's life being very
strange.

1263
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:03,390
Jesus Christ,
Jeff Garland has going on with your

1264
00:55:03,391 --> 00:55:04,290
phone.
What was that?

1265
00:55:04,690 --> 00:55:05,880
My brother Ringer.
What does that,

1266
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:09,790
it's a theme to a man and a woman,
but a Duh,

1267
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:12,180
Duh,
Duh.

1268
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:13,480
Do,
do,

1269
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,600
do no.
When a man and a woman is,

1270
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:18,190
I thought it's a French movie.
She's,

1271
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,910
but hold on a second here.
How am I supposed to know that?

1272
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:25,490
But actually I actually sing that with,
you know jeff who plays piano in the

1273
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:28,170
Jeff,
not Jeff,

1274
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,540
Richard,
Chuck Scott,

1275
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:31,500
Scott.
He and I,

1276
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:33,540
I'll start,
I'll look at them and I'll go,

1277
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:35,250
I'm not singing tonight.
And the audience,

1278
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,980
most of the time goes,
ah,

1279
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:40,560
it's if I'm known for a second,
which I make fun of them done in the

1280
00:55:40,561 --> 00:55:42,930
middle of the show,
I'll just look at them and go,

1281
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:47,220
you're Jones said Johnson,
Lyndon more sentimental alone.

1282
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,020
Joan said,
and I sing.

1283
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,290
And then when I'm done,
I tell the audience that I'm in a very

1284
00:55:52,291 --> 00:55:55,020
accomplished at French jibberish,
which is what it is.

1285
00:55:55,690 --> 00:55:56,580
Um,
but yeah,

1286
00:55:56,581 --> 00:55:59,240
it's a great song.
So do you have custom ringtones for

1287
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:00,450
different people call you?
Oh,

1288
00:56:00,451 --> 00:56:03,540
I just have the one and Julian my
ringer's off,

1289
00:56:03,541 --> 00:56:06,390
which is off now last thing,
I was listening to his buddy guy.

1290
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,870
Those is alive and well,
but he guys' newest album,

1291
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,080
he's a,
I think about to turn 82 I'm going to go

1292
00:56:13,081 --> 00:56:15,870
to Chicago for clear out the new album
and just put that too.

1293
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:18,000
And it's a bad ass album.
Of course it is.

1294
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,760
Oh,
he rips it the whole hour.

1295
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:23,220
He said magazines,
but that inspires me to still,

1296
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:24,220
by the way,

1297
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,590
everything about aging is about
relevancy.

1298
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:28,240
How are you contributing?
Right.

1299
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,970
Like George Carlin,
no one would care.

1300
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:31,810
The George Cardinal was,
doesn't matter.

1301
00:56:31,811 --> 00:56:33,580
75 or whatever it was.
Doesn't matter.

1302
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,470
He's relevant.
He's tripping Ireland.

1303
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:40,780
That's what I aspire to.
Relevancy to contribute to mankind,

1304
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:42,430
to my art,
to everything.

1305
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:45,100
So I'll never be like,
you know,

1306
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:50,200
if someone says who's that old dude and
I'm not doing anything based on what I'm

1307
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:52,390
aspiring to do,
that's their issue.

1308
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:52,901
Right,
right.

1309
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:56,260
You know,
because I will be to my best ability.

1310
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:58,360
Relevant.
That's an interesting perspective

1311
00:56:58,361 --> 00:57:00,430
because it's really true,
but it's something that people don't

1312
00:57:00,431 --> 00:57:01,450
think about.
You know?

1313
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:03,490
It's like,
like rock stars in particular,

1314
00:57:03,491 --> 00:57:06,640
like no one looks at Mick Jagger and go,
why is that guy still doing it?

1315
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,260
Because when you watch him do it,
you're like,

1316
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,300
oh Jesus,
he's still doing it.

1317
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,600
He's still doing it.
He's like,

1318
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:13,130
yes.

1319
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,390
Watching them live is ridiculous by the
way.

1320
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:21,190
He really moves.
No kidding around like at the oldest 30

1321
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:22,780
no,
he looks phenomenal.

1322
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:26,470
He's ridiculous.
And he's 70 70 something still shooting

1323
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:29,230
loads into hot models.
He had a baby recently.

1324
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:32,560
That's my stage name by that is it?
That's my band.

1325
00:57:32,590 --> 00:57:34,600
How do you have that state name?
And that's my band's name.

1326
00:57:34,630 --> 00:57:37,780
I didn't license it though,
so I'll give it back to you.

1327
00:57:37,781 --> 00:57:40,310
I put my apologies.
Bruce springsteen's another one

1328
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:43,030
springsteen's in his sixties I saw that
show.

1329
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:46,630
I saw that show and I,
my jaw was on the floor.

1330
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,390
I could not believe that's Broadway show
Broadway show.

1331
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:52,140
It was one of the greatest things I've
ever seen before.

1332
00:57:52,141 --> 00:57:55,690
He turns to Morrow,
Jesus Christ.

1333
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:59,470
And he works out,
I believe twice a day.

1334
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,970
Every day.
Does he really?

1335
00:58:00,971 --> 00:58:05,971
He does yoga and he trains with weights
and see if he could find Mick Jagger

1336
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:08,470
shirtless.
Uh,

1337
00:58:08,530 --> 00:58:10,120
as an other as cotton.
Yeah.

1338
00:58:10,121 --> 00:58:12,490
But I mean like recent,
right.

1339
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:17,490
Well then I would go to tools,
go to tools to the right and,

1340
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,610
and then go to uh,
yeah.

1341
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,800
Time.
Yeah.

1342
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:23,920
There we go.
I know.

1343
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,110
Say right recent.

1344
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:31,810
See if he can find a recent one.
There's a lot of pictures of him on his

1345
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:34,840
clothes off Jesus Christ.
Put a fucking shirt on.

1346
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,190
A hot model.
He's a interesting man.

1347
00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:42,050
That's why I say to you,
there's always exception there.

1348
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:43,600
Far Right.
What do you got there?

1349
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:45,840
That's a model.
Oh,

1350
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,640
that's not Mick Jagger.
You son of a bitch.

1351
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:51,400
That's him at 40 with the beard.
I know that for sure.

1352
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:54,070
So that's the oldest one I seen.
Okay.

1353
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:59,670
Well either way the guy,
he's what is movements or what's amazing

1354
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:04,450
is voice as not.
I think it's still amazing and the way

1355
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:05,620
he moves.
Yeah.

1356
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,900
It's so fluid.
It's so beautiful.

1357
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,870
He does a lot of yoga.
I'm pretty sure Google is workout.

1358
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:15,730
Mick Jagger's workout cause um,
he's incredibly disciplined apparently.

1359
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,680
And then look up,
uh,

1360
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:18,820
Barnaby Jones reunion.
Oh,

1361
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,130
just out of curiosity.
Common

1362
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,690
look at him.
Look at that right there.

1363
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,420
Takes up yoga at 73.
There you go.

1364
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:28,230
I was already did.
Yeah.

1365
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:29,171
Oh I should.
Oh,

1366
00:59:29,171 --> 00:59:32,660
it takes up aerial yoga.
I guess you're doing it on the ground.

1367
00:59:32,661 --> 00:59:36,320
It didn't work for him enough anymore.
Need to take it to a new level.

1368
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,600
That's just ridiculous.
Yeah.

1369
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,700
Incredible.
Mick Jagger at Diet and exercise

1370
00:59:40,701 --> 00:59:41,930
program.
Live long,

1371
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:45,170
long stay young.
What if he only eats peppers?

1372
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:50,810
I was just in Thailand.
And um,

1373
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:53,270
when you go to the bathroom right by the
toilet,

1374
00:59:53,271 --> 00:59:57,710
they literally have one of those garden
hoses that you would wash a car with.

1375
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,980
Play with big days.
Because with those peppers,

1376
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,190
are you eating that Thai food?
Like this kind of splatter that you're

1377
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:06,770
creating that like let's just,
let's be honest.

1378
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:09,860
Toilet paper is not good enough.
You're going to need a hose down.

1379
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:13,370
So funny if there was a guy waiting
outside the bathroom to explain that to

1380
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:15,190
you.
You just walk out,

1381
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,930
he says you,
you're probably a little confused but

1382
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:20,820
toilet papers and I'd explain it or
nothing there.

1383
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,620
There's something that I put up on my
instagram today about a sign that I saw

1384
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,330
that said,
please don't pee on the floor.

1385
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,120
And I'm like,
How many people have to pee on the floor

1386
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:32,330
before you put a sign up that says
please don't pee on the floor.

1387
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,160
And by the way,
if you're a person who pees on the

1388
01:00:34,161 --> 01:00:35,720
floor,
are you really going to go?

1389
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,310
Oh,
I was going to,

1390
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:41,190
but now I'm not at all.
I'm stopping the [inaudible].

1391
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,380
Exactly.
It's like,

1392
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,790
please don't rape.
By the way,

1393
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:48,791
the truth is about Floor Ping.
It it p ends up on the floor.

1394
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:49,910
Some does.
Yeah.

1395
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:51,800
Some done for dudes.
Yeah,

1396
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,700
for dudes.
And the other thing I read that,

1397
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:56,510
that's very honest that I've read that I
agree with.

1398
01:00:56,690 --> 01:01:00,860
Some guy said because of Smartphones,
I pee sitting down much more than I

1399
01:01:00,861 --> 01:01:02,480
would like to admit.
Oh,

1400
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,420
that's a fact.
We did an episode about that on a curb

1401
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:07,080
your enthusiasm.
I sit down like,

1402
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:08,810
well,
just take a shit and if it doesn't come

1403
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,430
out,
I'll just p and I'll read my phone.

1404
01:01:10,490 --> 01:01:11,580
Yeah,
I'll just read.

1405
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,600
Just read stuff you guess?
No,

1406
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,090
I can look at people with their phones.

1407
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:17,901
That's a whole thing.
Yeah.

1408
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:21,080
The a problem with phones as a tool.
No,

1409
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:25,280
I do not.
But as a avoiding being in the present,

1410
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:26,420
I do.
Yeah.

1411
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:28,280
They're addictive.
They're addictive.

1412
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,810
Very addictive.
And by the way,

1413
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:33,230
I gotta be honest,
I don't remember the last show where

1414
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:36,350
somebody didn't pull out their phone the
last show,

1415
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,860
like when people are texting people or
someone is,

1416
01:01:39,861 --> 01:01:44,060
even if it's one person,
I can't even remember somebody not doing

1417
01:01:44,061 --> 01:01:45,380
that.
And that's the ultimate,

1418
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:46,850
that's so disrespectful.
Well,

1419
01:01:46,851 --> 01:01:48,520
one of the things I did before my last,
uh,

1420
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:52,730
Netflix special that I've filmed in
April was I went on tour for three

1421
01:01:52,731 --> 01:01:55,160
months where you had to use those cell
phone back.

1422
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,840
Did those yonder bags?
Yeah.

1423
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:59,070
There a giant fucking pain in the ass.
I,

1424
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,020
by,
by the way,

1425
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:05,560
I play a lot at largo and I would just
make an announcement and then if someone

1426
01:02:07,131 --> 01:02:08,450
does,
you could come out.

1427
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:09,950
No,
I mean some people just feel like,

1428
01:02:09,951 --> 01:02:10,251
yeah,
yeah,

1429
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,050
but I got to just answer this text.
Yeah,

1430
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:13,220
yeah.
But I just got to do this.

1431
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,460
Hey.
But I,

1432
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:16,630
I'm a big fan of it is.
Yeah.

1433
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,430
But,
but my response is yeah,

1434
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:19,710
yeah.
But I'll see a lighter.

1435
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:20,780
Yeah,
there's a,

1436
01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:22,020
there's an issue.
Um,

1437
01:02:22,021 --> 01:02:24,750
but what I was going to say is that it's
a big pain in the ass,

1438
01:02:24,751 --> 01:02:28,740
those yonder bag.
But the show was like 10% better because

1439
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:31,470
no one had their phone and you just sit
there and you would actually be

1440
01:02:31,471 --> 01:02:33,590
connected to the show.
But people are your,

1441
01:02:33,591 --> 01:02:36,060
but waterfall fuck plan leader would
have,

1442
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:38,360
I got a deuce waterfall.
Go to Turks coming in.

1443
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:40,230
What's that character's name?
I don't have one.

1444
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,570
You don't have a name for the care,
Doug?

1445
01:02:41,790 --> 01:02:42,480
Oh,
no,

1446
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,420
but I don't let stand how toby toby.
Okay.

1447
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,760
Toby.
Toby,

1448
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,160
toby.
Fuck him.

1449
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,530
Fuck.
I got a call coming in.

1450
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:52,620
I'm going to leave the show to answer
the phone.

1451
01:02:52,621 --> 01:02:54,480
Tell me what your,
your buyer to the Caribbean movie is

1452
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:55,710
your favorite.
Oh,

1453
01:02:55,711 --> 01:02:57,750
all of them are fucking huge.
Johnny Depp found

1454
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:00,120
one of the reasons,

1455
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,890
it's why I did that because,
um,

1456
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:06,000
cause Chapelle was telling me how much
he enjoys it and Hannibal,

1457
01:03:06,001 --> 01:03:08,490
Hannibal burress who tell me how much he
enjoys using those bags too.

1458
01:03:08,491 --> 01:03:11,580
But another reason was this woman
complained that,

1459
01:03:11,610 --> 01:03:14,220
um,
when she went to my new year show that

1460
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:19,110
some girl behind her made two separate
phone calls and was saying happy new

1461
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:21,630
year to people during the show,
during the show.

1462
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:24,240
She was like,
this stupid fucking bitch was making

1463
01:03:24,241 --> 01:03:26,550
phone calls while the show was going on.

1464
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,480
The way I've,
I've,

1465
01:03:27,481 --> 01:03:31,620
I've been behind in front of next to
that person.

1466
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,060
That's a crazy thing to do.
To me,

1467
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,023
you were at

1468
01:03:34,050 --> 01:03:35,640
form,
it's a live performance and you're

1469
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:39,320
calling people and talking to them or
even answering the phone and talking on

1470
01:03:39,321 --> 01:03:39,700
the,

1471
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:44,700
but I think if you have signs with a
stern language saying you'll be no,

1472
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:46,210
I was like peeing on the floor,
Bro.

1473
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,380
No,
but I gotta be honest with you,

1474
01:03:47,710 --> 01:03:52,630
I really respect my audience and I
really think that that would eliminate

1475
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:57,130
the handful of people that would be
douchey most because I play at Largo a

1476
01:03:57,140 --> 01:04:00,850
lot and at Largo they make the
announcement and I have,

1477
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:05,860
I have never seen anyone during my show.
That's an exceptional place.

1478
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:06,280
Yeah.
But,

1479
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,480
but you can create an exceptional vibe,
but yes.

1480
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,710
In your audience with,
by respecting them.

1481
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:13,190
I certainly agree.
I'm like,

1482
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:14,050
it's like,
you know,

1483
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:16,300
when I go someplace and they want to put
a stamp on my hands,

1484
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:16,961
I just go,
no,

1485
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:17,211
no,
no,

1486
01:04:17,211 --> 01:04:18,044
no,
no,

1487
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:20,890
no.
There'll be no stamps on my hands.

1488
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:22,750
And you're,
the doorman usually says,

1489
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,790
okay,
really?

1490
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,230
Yeah.
So when they do not look,

1491
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,210
I don't really drink alcohol,
so,

1492
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:30,160
but so,
but like if I go to the bar and order a

1493
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:31,840
drink,
the guy who's going to look for my stamp

1494
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:34,000
point being is fuck all that.

1495
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:36,220
I got to have respect for it.
But if you go to like a mythical

1496
01:04:36,221 --> 01:04:38,680
festival,
it's like also when you go to the

1497
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:43,330
bathroom and they have the sinks,
I don't mind the sinks where it senses

1498
01:04:43,331 --> 01:04:45,730
your hand even though it doesn't always
do it.

1499
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,140
But man,
those times,

1500
01:04:47,170 --> 01:04:50,170
those ones where you push down and you
get 10 seconds,

1501
01:04:50,410 --> 01:04:52,750
that's so disrespectful.
It's wrong,

1502
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,250
wrong,
wrong,

1503
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,350
really wrong to mankind,
you know,

1504
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,370
bothers me.
What?

1505
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:00,370
When you wave your hand and a thing and
it gives you a tiny little strip of

1506
01:05:00,371 --> 01:05:01,204
paper,
you know?

1507
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah.
A little stingy ass piece of paper to

1508
01:05:04,001 --> 01:05:07,260
dry your hand wave and the second time
give me a real fucking piece of paper.

1509
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,910
What's great?
Those powerful new blow ones?

1510
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,960
No,
those are no good.

1511
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,180
I'd dig them.
There was an article that I tweeted

1512
01:05:13,181 --> 01:05:14,730
about those things.
What are the problems?

1513
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:19,120
There's like shit dust in the air for
people and all that bacteria by,

1514
01:05:19,121 --> 01:05:19,954
by,
by the way,

1515
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:22,150
let me ask you,
the premise of the shit does.

1516
01:05:22,930 --> 01:05:25,990
So you're saying people take a dump,
wash their ass,

1517
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:26,843
wait,
yes.

1518
01:05:26,870 --> 01:05:29,650
And then don't go to the sink to wash
their hands.

1519
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:33,430
They just go straight for the dryer
thing cause it's fun and let's spread

1520
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,770
this shit around.
The thing is with that,

1521
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:40,980
when you hit that dryer dust from that
the wind kicks up ups.

1522
01:05:41,251 --> 01:05:43,780
This is science.
Scientists are,

1523
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:47,130
there's too much for me to think about
it too much for me to pick up.

1524
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,730
Listen man,
I did no research.

1525
01:05:48,731 --> 01:05:52,960
I just posted an article that I read
said that those things are hygienic and

1526
01:05:52,961 --> 01:05:56,470
then somebody goes,
hey if if joe posted and it must be true

1527
01:05:56,471 --> 01:05:59,230
because he did his research can be very
click baity right.

1528
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,450
They could've just got you some
bullshit,

1529
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:04,480
some bullshit.
Some guy named Bob who's a doctor.

1530
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,460
I'm tone Ya.
They're shit there.

1531
01:06:06,461 --> 01:06:08,590
That's my character of Bob was an angry
doctor.

1532
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,500
Third shouldn't here am I right toby?
Shit dust.

1533
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:12,320
Yeah,
yeah,

1534
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,560
yeah.
I was on the phone and I didn't have

1535
01:06:14,561 --> 01:06:15,740
time.
I'm tired.

1536
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,110
Wash my hands,
hand dryers,

1537
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:20,080
sucking fecal bacteria and blow it all
over your hands.

1538
01:06:20,081 --> 01:06:21,610
Study finds.
See Bro,

1539
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:24,790
we go enjoy.
So I will not be using that anymore.

1540
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:29,350
I wouldn't use the borough dryer and
when I touch the thing to have the tower

1541
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:32,260
will come down.
I know that that's very clean.

1542
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:33,940
Yes.
No,

1543
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:34,661
no,
no.

1544
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:35,700
That's not,
but at least it's not,

1545
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,400
but there's no cool.
Let's just send it.

1546
01:06:37,401 --> 01:06:39,220
Just put it this way.
There's no winning,

1547
01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:40,940
no winning.
No,

1548
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:43,570
but you gotta take a dump in public.
There's no wind.

1549
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,300
Well,
there's also the issue of like becoming

1550
01:06:46,301 --> 01:06:49,090
some ocd person who's fucking completely
crazy.

1551
01:06:49,091 --> 01:06:52,210
Sports rl all over their body everywhere
they go,

1552
01:06:52,211 --> 01:06:54,910
because they're afraid of everything and
they touch and then they don't build up

1553
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:55,750
immunity.
I had,

1554
01:06:55,751 --> 01:06:57,700
that's,
I have a giant issue with,

1555
01:06:57,701 --> 01:07:02,701
with that many people who in auditions
won't shake an actor's hand because

1556
01:07:04,841 --> 01:07:06,070
they've got,
that's not,

1557
01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:07,510
well,
da friends with Hawaii.

1558
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:09,340
Yes.
I know that.

1559
01:07:09,341 --> 01:07:12,000
How he doesn't touch,
he doesn't even bang knuckles anymore.

1560
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:13,560
He was banging knuckles for a while.
He wouldn't.

1561
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:15,940
He even do knuckles anymore.
He's gotten worse.

1562
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:17,590
That's his business.
He's a good man.

1563
01:07:17,710 --> 01:07:20,110
He's a very good man.
He really liked that guy a lot,

1564
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:22,060
but I want to hug him.
I want to go,

1565
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:24,070
come get him on the fuck.
Give me a hug and give me a kiss.

1566
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:24,904
Right on the lips.

1567
01:07:26,850 --> 01:07:31,000
Imagine you said
he's such a nice man.

1568
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:32,920
He's a good man.
He's a very good guy.

1569
01:07:32,921 --> 01:07:36,220
But I want him to get over that because
I think it's insane not going to happen.

1570
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:38,370
Why not?
You think people haven't worked with

1571
01:07:38,371 --> 01:07:40,870
them on it?
It doesn't make any sense to want to

1572
01:07:40,871 --> 01:07:42,540
change Joe.
Ooh,

1573
01:07:43,570 --> 01:07:45,880
your own psychiatrists don't want to
change.

1574
01:07:45,881 --> 01:07:47,590
You're not going to change.
That's true.

1575
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:49,180
And that's what the addiction with
anything.

1576
01:07:49,181 --> 01:07:53,530
If you don't want to do it,
nobody try the way when it comes to

1577
01:07:53,531 --> 01:07:56,410
addiction or behavior,
like how he's,

1578
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:01,600
logic does not enter the right.
You can present your logical cases to

1579
01:08:01,601 --> 01:08:04,270
all those different types of people.
It doesn't matter.

1580
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:05,830
They got to wanna.
Yeah,

1581
01:08:06,220 --> 01:08:09,160
well he um,
he goes so far as that he puts down a

1582
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:14,200
trail of paper towels in his hotel room
so he never has to stay on the carpet.

1583
01:08:14,201 --> 01:08:15,020
So yeah,
I did not know this.

1584
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:16,010
I don't want to know this.
I

1585
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:17,540
don't want to think about how we in
hotels,

1586
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:19,490
sorry,
I want him to be happy in hotels.

1587
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,920
Well I'm sure he's happy once he steps
on that paper towel.

1588
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:24,220
You know what special I loved as a kid.
Well,

1589
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,300
how are we from Maui?
Oh yeah.

1590
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:27,440
It was hilarious.
He told me,

1591
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:28,520
I told him this the other night.
He goes,

1592
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,690
that was shit.
And I go,

1593
01:08:29,691 --> 01:08:30,021
no,
no.

1594
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:32,810
I laughed really hard at that special.
Well,

1595
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:34,850
it's because he's very funny that he's
self critical.

1596
01:08:34,851 --> 01:08:39,650
Every funny person I've ever known
thinks they're the best response is just

1597
01:08:39,651 --> 01:08:41,000
thank you.
Yeah,

1598
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:42,070
that's a good response.
Thanks.

1599
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,510
I'm glad you enjoyed it too.
I feel that way.

1600
01:08:44,630 --> 01:08:46,100
Look,
when people come up to me and they go,

1601
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,650
you're my favorite character on curb
your enthusiasm.

1602
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,660
What I could really do is look them in
the angle.

1603
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:53,870
Really,
really the guy who does all the

1604
01:08:53,871 --> 01:08:54,800
exposition.

1605
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:56,960
Larry,
David's not your favorite.

1606
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:00,410
I think you're wrong by the way.
Every blue moon,

1607
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,710
when somebody says that to me,
I can tell that they mean it,

1608
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:05,870
but all of them wouldn't know the
difference.

1609
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:07,790
Cause I thank say thank you to all of
them.

1610
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:11,180
No one needs to hear that shit.
People do say stupid shit that they

1611
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:13,550
don't really mean just cause they want
you to respond to them.

1612
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:14,361
Yeah.
I want to tell you,

1613
01:09:14,361 --> 01:09:15,830
you're the best famous,
weird.

1614
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:21,220
I learned that when I was at 100% true
and I had this moment where it became

1615
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:26,480
clear to me,
I found myself waiting at valet parking

1616
01:09:26,481 --> 01:09:30,620
with Tony Danza and it wasn't like we
were even looking at each other or we

1617
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:34,910
had an awkward moment together.
I really wanted to say hello and not

1618
01:09:34,911 --> 01:09:37,460
because I'm a big Tony,
Tony fans a fan or any reason.

1619
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:42,080
It was just the fame factor wanting me
to talk to Tony Danza course.

1620
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:43,190
Not even like,
Hey Tony,

1621
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:46,430
I'm Jeff Garlin Wright.
Just Hey Tony Danza oh you know,

1622
01:09:46,431 --> 01:09:47,264
hey.
Right.

1623
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:49,250
And so I thought,
oh this is fucked up.

1624
01:09:49,251 --> 01:09:50,390
Shut up.
I didn't say anything.

1625
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:53,090
He seems very approachable.
He seems like a very nice fella.

1626
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:54,380
But,
but that is not,

1627
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:55,100
yeah,

1628
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,750
when I was a young man,
um,

1629
01:09:56,870 --> 01:10:00,920
I always wished that I was as nice as
Tony Danza.

1630
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,790
Cause when I see Tony Danza on taxi and
all those shows him like he always

1631
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:07,820
seemed so friendly.
Like why can't I be nice and friendly?

1632
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,950
Wouldn't be weird.
As you got into show business,

1633
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:13,960
you found out he was a prick.
But the truth is I've never seen,

1634
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:15,810
I've never heard a bad thing ever said
about him.

1635
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:18,500
There was a fist fight with him at the
comedy store one night.

1636
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:19,231
Oh really?
Yeah,

1637
01:10:19,231 --> 01:10:19,740
yeah,
yeah.

1638
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,500
Long,
long time ago.

1639
01:10:21,590 --> 01:10:26,590
I want to say like it was before my time
and I started there in 94 so someone

1640
01:10:26,751 --> 01:10:29,570
said something stupid to him somewhere
back in the day.

1641
01:10:29,571 --> 01:10:31,960
And Tony Dan's was a professional boxer.
Yeah,

1642
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:35,960
go really good boxer.
He actually took a pro fight in between

1643
01:10:35,961 --> 01:10:40,250
tapings of taxi,
driver of taxi rather when he was a

1644
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:42,290
first season in between first and second
season,

1645
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,610
he was offered a few months.
He's like,

1646
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:44,510
fuck,
I'll have a fight.

1647
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,190
And then he was like,
what am I doing?

1648
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,750
Fucking actor now?
Yeah,

1649
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:50,000
he is,
but he's,

1650
01:10:50,001 --> 01:10:51,500
somebody got mouthy with them.

1651
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,150
Well,
by the way,

1652
01:10:54,151 --> 01:10:56,160
when you see someone like that get into
a fight,

1653
01:10:56,161 --> 01:10:58,020
you know,
whoever approached him really,

1654
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,780
there've been times where I felt like it
was just not worth it.

1655
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:05,780
Yeah.
Because you lose that person,

1656
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:08,250
you lose,
I don't care if someone calls you a Nazi

1657
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:12,700
kike any bad word,
uh,

1658
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,790
just along,
that's the other reaction,

1659
01:11:14,791 --> 01:11:15,990
right?
Like there's some people that would come

1660
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:17,190
up to you,
Jeff Garlin.

1661
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:18,480
Hey boy.
That'd be like,

1662
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,370
Oh,
you fucking think you're all funny cause

1663
01:11:20,371 --> 01:11:25,200
you're on curb your enthusiasm every
like maybe once every two,

1664
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:27,360
three years.
But you're really continuing the

1665
01:11:27,361 --> 01:11:28,720
character.
Was it as is?

1666
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,420
No,
but some guy.

1667
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,670
Was that toby toby?
Yeah.

1668
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:36,150
Jimbo math.
Jimbo was on math.

1669
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:38,010
So sad.
No,

1670
01:11:38,011 --> 01:11:39,330
but,
but I just avoid,

1671
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:40,800
you know,
I don't get into it.

1672
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:44,220
You know what you think of me is none of
my business that includes fame.

1673
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:45,840
Right?
So people come up and say things.

1674
01:11:45,841 --> 01:11:47,880
Thank you.
That's the right thing to say.

1675
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,823
Yeah.
And then,

1676
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:50,610
and then you want to say to them
sometimes,

1677
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:53,640
and you know this one,
could you move along?

1678
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:58,560
Because they just stay.
They just stay there and it's really

1679
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:00,150
awkward.
There was a dude at the comedy store

1680
01:12:00,151 --> 01:12:04,710
scared the hell out of me because he
told me how much I meant to him and then

1681
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:07,140
he didn't leave.
And then he was telling me personal

1682
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:10,680
things about him that were not the,
I'm not going to repeat them because I

1683
01:12:10,681 --> 01:12:12,720
don't want to let them know that I'm
talking to him.

1684
01:12:13,020 --> 01:12:14,430
But he started telling me things like,
oh wow,

1685
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,420
you're really a scary individual and I
want,

1686
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:22,350
I never have said the words move along,
but I actually moved along into an area

1687
01:12:22,351 --> 01:12:25,920
he couldn't enter.
A number was behind the rope,

1688
01:12:25,921 --> 01:12:27,990
you know,
buy the cars or in the bar,

1689
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:30,120
you know,
the something to get away.

1690
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,800
And he still tried,
you know,

1691
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:35,040
it was scary and people get crazy.
You know what bothers me?

1692
01:12:35,041 --> 01:12:38,000
Sometimes you'll be in the middle of a
serious conversation with someone,

1693
01:12:38,001 --> 01:12:39,540
a tea.
They're telling you something like

1694
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,970
really intimate and someone to call
here,

1695
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:42,030
hey man.
Hey,

1696
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:42,421
what?
Buy,

1697
01:12:42,421 --> 01:12:42,751
buy,
buy,

1698
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:43,060
buy,
buy,

1699
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,270
buy
and you're like,

1700
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:47,370
but Tony's just telling me he's
suicidal.

1701
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:50,010
Yeah.
In the middle of a competition thing

1702
01:12:50,011 --> 01:12:52,380
about jumping in front of a bus and you
don't give a fuck.

1703
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:52,921
No,
it's,

1704
01:12:52,921 --> 01:12:56,070
it's,
it's a big bowl or wrong it just because

1705
01:12:56,071 --> 01:13:00,510
really just be respectful and kind.
Anyone that comes up to me as respectful

1706
01:13:00,511 --> 01:13:02,100
and kind,
I'm kind to,

1707
01:13:02,130 --> 01:13:06,560
anyone comes up to me as an asshole.
I'm kind to being an asshole.

1708
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,970
They just don't know cause they are
either you're an asshole,

1709
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:12,240
you're not either or you're not.
But there's also taught,

1710
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:14,420
you have a couple of drinks and you
don't know what to say.

1711
01:13:15,620 --> 01:13:17,370
What's the number one rule with someone
who's,

1712
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:20,250
who's drunk too much,
but telling them that they're drunk.

1713
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:21,900
That's good too.
You know what I'm saying?

1714
01:13:21,901 --> 01:13:22,650
Hey man,
you drunk.

1715
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:23,250
Yeah.
Hey man,

1716
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,080
I didn't really,
I don't really talk to drunk people

1717
01:13:25,410 --> 01:13:27,330
drunk.
Oh always.

1718
01:13:27,630 --> 01:13:28,431
It's the,
it's,

1719
01:13:28,431 --> 01:13:32,310
it's the only goat too.
There's no other goto in that situation

1720
01:13:32,311 --> 01:13:32,990
drive.
I,

1721
01:13:32,990 --> 01:13:33,680
yeah,
I can do it.

1722
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:36,150
Yeah.
And so because whatever it does,

1723
01:13:36,151 --> 01:13:41,151
it really plows into your ego.
And so I just make the quickest

1724
01:13:41,731 --> 01:13:43,230
connection and get,
get out.

1725
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:44,460
Yeah.
That's a good move.

1726
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:45,630
Yeah,
it's true.

1727
01:13:45,631 --> 01:13:47,490
But I'm appreciative when people come up
to me,

1728
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:51,060
I'm appreciative and I treat them the
way.

1729
01:13:51,061 --> 01:13:53,940
If someone I dug,
especially a comedian,

1730
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:58,530
if I told them I dug them,
I treat the people the way.

1731
01:13:58,740 --> 01:14:03,000
And the more the warmer and the more
interesting the person is,

1732
01:14:03,001 --> 01:14:05,070
the more I give them of myself.

1733
01:14:05,130 --> 01:14:07,680
How does Larry David handle it?
He's not bad.

1734
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:08,790
Yeah.
Yeah.

1735
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:09,713
I'm a big fan of,
oh,

1736
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,870
thank you.
You about that.

1737
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:14,680
Yeah.
I've seen them go through,

1738
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:17,650
because it was,
I saw him become famous,

1739
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,100
you know,
he was on Fridays.

1740
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:23,950
He created Seinfeld,
but that still wasn't the fame that he

1741
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:25,870
has now.
So I saw him through curb your

1742
01:14:25,871 --> 01:14:30,871
enthusiasm become truly iconic.
So he's had trouble figuring out how to,

1743
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,620
people want to take a picture of people,
you know?

1744
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:36,700
Well,
how do I do it?

1745
01:14:36,701 --> 01:14:39,520
And it's always changing.
He's never an asshole.

1746
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,950
It's truly one of the greatest comedy
shows of all time.

1747
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:42,900
Well,
thank you.

1748
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:46,300
I 100% and I have to say the new season
we're about to film in October,

1749
01:14:46,570 --> 01:14:51,570
the storyline may be my favorite and
it's really subtle and fun.

1750
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:54,040
It's like one of those things like,
oh,

1751
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:54,940
I,
it's like,

1752
01:14:55,180 --> 01:14:59,560
I think people watching it will feel
that they're living a fantasy and after

1753
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:02,620
the first one airs,
I'm happy to come back and talk about

1754
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:03,160
it.

1755
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,680
You know what I mean?
Because that premise of where we're

1756
01:15:05,681 --> 01:15:10,510
going is delightful.
I love how hbo gives him sort of carte

1757
01:15:10,511 --> 01:15:11,320
blanche.
They're like,

1758
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,790
you know,
take a couple of years off,

1759
01:15:12,791 --> 01:15:14,110
do whatever the fuck you want.
Like,

1760
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:15,970
yeah,
take some pretty great.

1761
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,081
Well,
for Larry,

1762
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,830
it's not about the money.
Of course it's about can I do another

1763
01:15:20,831 --> 01:15:23,620
good show?
And that makes us different than most

1764
01:15:23,621 --> 01:15:25,180
shows in history.
Yeah.

1765
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:26,470
And uh,
he,

1766
01:15:26,471 --> 01:15:29,680
um,
he only wants to do good work and enjoy

1767
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:32,930
himself otherwise there's no reason.
And,

1768
01:15:32,931 --> 01:15:35,800
uh,
an HBO is smart that way.

1769
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,720
Their genius there.
I mean look,

1770
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:42,770
and you think about the show soprano's
fucking game of thrones and now they

1771
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:47,020
know how to let a show be a show.
They,

1772
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:51,670
from what I understand,
they give a lot of notes on their

1773
01:15:51,671 --> 01:15:54,460
pilots,
but once you become a series,

1774
01:15:54,461 --> 01:15:55,630
they kind of leave you alone.

1775
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,020
That's amazing.
You know?

1776
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:02,040
Whereas when you're doing a network show
or from other pay sources,

1777
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:06,250
I've heard that the notes never stopped.
Well when I was on the radio is the

1778
01:16:06,251 --> 01:16:10,000
easiest thing to ruin with notes.
Drama can survive notes.

1779
01:16:10,870 --> 01:16:14,140
Comedy cannot because it's like the uh,
you know,

1780
01:16:14,141 --> 01:16:15,190
doing comedies,
like,

1781
01:16:15,191 --> 01:16:15,631
you know,
the,

1782
01:16:15,631 --> 01:16:18,340
the,
the dominoes and if you take one of

1783
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:20,360
those and just move it a little to the
left,

1784
01:16:20,361 --> 01:16:22,900
to the right,
you're screwing up the whole thing.

1785
01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:25,270
That's very good point.
When I was on news radio,

1786
01:16:25,271 --> 01:16:28,480
we weren't successful and that is when
you get the notes.

1787
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,690
We were,
so my friend Lou Morton,

1788
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:35,410
who was one of the writers,
he would wear a shirt every Monday after

1789
01:16:35,411 --> 01:16:37,030
the ratings would come in with a number
on it.

1790
01:16:37,031 --> 01:16:38,560
It would take a white t shirt and write
it.

1791
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,960
And one day came into the number,
said 88 I go,

1792
01:16:40,961 --> 01:16:42,100
fuck dude.
Really?

1793
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:42,790
He goes,
yeah,

1794
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:44,560
we're 88th I'm like,
fuck.

1795
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,330
I was like,
God damn it.

1796
01:16:46,331 --> 01:16:47,980
I'm going to say three years,
right?

1797
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,210
Five,
five years.

1798
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:52,840
So the point being is that was an
immensely successful show.

1799
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:56,050
Barely,
barely made you stay on the air.

1800
01:16:56,051 --> 01:16:57,460
That's pretty great.
No,

1801
01:16:57,461 --> 01:16:57,761
no,
no,

1802
01:16:57,761 --> 01:16:59,800
for sure.
It's definitely better than being

1803
01:16:59,801 --> 01:17:02,290
canceled.
But the point being is that we were

1804
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:05,290
never a hit,
so we always got notes.

1805
01:17:05,410 --> 01:17:07,720
We're constantly getting notes like we
need a gay neighbor,

1806
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:09,440
we need a black guy,
we need a,

1807
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:09,980
we need

1808
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,060
of this.
We needed that.

1809
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:13,910
We needed a love interest.
We need a fucking watch that show,

1810
01:17:13,911 --> 01:17:15,680
by the way,
the gay neighbor and the Black Guy,

1811
01:17:15,681 --> 01:17:17,360
if that was the name of the show,
I'd be in.

1812
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:20,800
That's what probably good name of
sitcoms gaining black guy was next door,

1813
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:22,160
gay neighbor.
And it's the problems that,

1814
01:17:22,161 --> 01:17:24,320
there's a lot of sitcoms and I don't
want to name names,

1815
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:26,510
but I watched them and I know they're
very,

1816
01:17:26,511 --> 01:17:28,880
very,
very successful and I watched them and

1817
01:17:28,881 --> 01:17:30,980
I'm stunned.
I don't understand it.

1818
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:32,930
It's like they're speaking a different
language.

1819
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:35,480
I don't get it either.
I don't,

1820
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:37,460
I don't,
but I don't watch comedy,

1821
01:17:37,461 --> 01:17:39,290
man.
I'm Erica.

1822
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:42,800
I think there's,
there's something going on with tired

1823
01:17:42,801 --> 01:17:43,634
people.

1824
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:48,290
Here's something that I noticed.
This is something that's recent to that.

1825
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:54,250
Audiences now respond to what they think
is supposed to be funny.

1826
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,940
Like real comedy fans,
dug news radio,

1827
01:18:00,050 --> 01:18:04,640
like people who dug comedy.
I think Doug News radio people did

1828
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:07,610
comedy dig curb.
Do we have other kinds of fans too?

1829
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:12,140
Yes,
but I find that comedy fans really do

1830
01:18:12,141 --> 01:18:15,920
get comedy,
but everybody likes to say they like

1831
01:18:15,921 --> 01:18:19,370
comedy or they watch comedy and they may
not have any sense of humor.

1832
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:22,970
So I find there was a show,
I'll give you an example,

1833
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:26,390
and this one was like the specific,
and I don't care if I'm slamming it,

1834
01:18:26,870 --> 01:18:31,870
it was the something in the girl and the
apartment b or the bitch and something

1835
01:18:32,661 --> 01:18:34,220
be,
it was um,

1836
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:35,870
lead actress.
Very talented.

1837
01:18:35,871 --> 01:18:39,560
But I watched the show and the rhythms
were,

1838
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:41,540
this is what comedy is.

1839
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:45,020
It wasn't funny.
It didn't have a natural vibe to it.

1840
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,540
It had no reason for me to keep watching
it,

1841
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:52,810
but it was done in a style that other
shows have done since where this is how

1842
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:57,920
comedy is done,
this is the way we spend a line or do a

1843
01:18:57,921 --> 01:19:02,921
situation and I don't know why,
but it always involves a lot of that.

1844
01:19:04,010 --> 01:19:08,260
That putting the,
the the spin on the ball or what's the

1845
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,910
dancing in English?
Yeah.

1846
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,630
It has a lot to do with it because even
if you watch a lot of nickelodeon shows,

1847
01:19:14,631 --> 01:19:17,000
her Disney shows,
they tend to do that.

1848
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:21,980
They put the spin on it.
It's never funny enough just to have,

1849
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,290
here's the thing about comedy TV,
comedy.

1850
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,190
I think for the most part you're
supposed to be enthralled with the

1851
01:19:28,191 --> 01:19:30,380
situation,
the situation.

1852
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,220
So the situation Lucy got into a
situation.

1853
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:36,900
Yes.
And you laughed at Lucy dealing with the

1854
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:39,350
situation.
I really,

1855
01:19:39,351 --> 01:19:44,351
I bet in the entire time lucy ran on the
rent on the air that there might've been

1856
01:19:44,601 --> 01:19:48,410
12 great jokes that she said in the
situation.

1857
01:19:48,770 --> 01:19:51,680
You're laughing on how she deals with
the situation.

1858
01:19:51,681 --> 01:19:54,170
Very good point.
And you look at any great comedy and

1859
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:56,810
that's where this,
it's Larry David dealing with a

1860
01:19:56,811 --> 01:19:57,980
situation.
Yes,

1861
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,870
it's,
it's um,

1862
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:01,100
so,
and by the way,

1863
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:03,950
one thing Larry and I are very proud
about with curb your enthusiasm.

1864
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:06,260
If one of us says something funny to the
other one,

1865
01:20:06,261 --> 01:20:08,130
cause we improvise,
we laugh.

1866
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,960
So these shows,
you see people say these lines written

1867
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:16,260
by writers and then the audience laughs
if it's on stage,

1868
01:20:16,530 --> 01:20:18,570
but yet the actors don't laugh at one
another.

1869
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:23,580
So on a lot of levels it's just not
right.

1870
01:20:23,581 --> 01:20:28,510
And then there are shows now that I've
watched for maybe five minutes where Ma

1871
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:33,120
I cannot believe how they're,
how terrible they are and yet they're

1872
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:33,954
successful.

1873
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:35,940
Hugely successful,
hugely successful.

1874
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:37,100
Don't get it.
Yeah.

1875
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:42,290
When you guys do a show,
you don't really have like a full script

1876
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:43,500
in terms of,
no,

1877
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:46,860
we have a very tight outline.
We have seven pages line.

1878
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:52,160
Larry has written the story and in that
story maybe a half dozen things are

1879
01:20:53,371 --> 01:20:56,550
like,
he says this or she says that you have

1880
01:20:56,551 --> 01:21:00,160
to move the story for story purposes.
Not because it's a great joke.

1881
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,880
Right.
And then I play it every time

1882
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:07,830
differently unless I'm told by the
director or I'm one of the producers,

1883
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:10,440
we have a meeting of like we need to get
this across.

1884
01:21:10,441 --> 01:21:12,480
This is not coming across and I'll make
an adjustment.

1885
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,760
But in general,
I try and do it different.

1886
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:17,970
Every single tech that is so crazy and
how many takes we do,

1887
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:22,290
well if it's Larry and I just us,
he and I alone in the scene it we can,

1888
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:24,870
we can have a scene done in less than an
hour,

1889
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:28,290
but if there's a bunch of other people,
could be three hours.

1890
01:21:28,740 --> 01:21:31,110
Wow.
And the idea is just like this is what

1891
01:21:31,111 --> 01:21:33,960
needs to take place.
We know we have to figure out how to get

1892
01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:37,590
across the fact that the refrigerator's
broken and we're going to have to go buy

1893
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:40,710
ice and who's going to buy the ice?
I don't want to drive to buy the ice.

1894
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:42,030
Right.
And then y'all just talking.

1895
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:45,700
It's more in depth than that.
The story is really that.

1896
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:47,910
But yes,
how we approach it.

1897
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:50,610
And sometimes that can change that.
That's one of the reasons why the show

1898
01:21:50,611 --> 01:21:53,610
is so good because it seems so organic
when you guys are talking.

1899
01:21:53,670 --> 01:21:56,370
It is,
well that's what I get out of it.

1900
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:58,470
We don't rehearse.
That's amazing.

1901
01:21:58,471 --> 01:22:00,150
They are so,
um,

1902
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,400
the Goldbergs we don't even do a lot of
rehearsing,

1903
01:22:02,401 --> 01:22:05,820
but I have to stick to the script.
If I want to improvise on the Goldbergs,

1904
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:11,090
I have to let the producers know not to
get permission to let them know this

1905
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:14,130
take,
I'm going to do something different and

1906
01:22:14,131 --> 01:22:15,780
I have to let my fellow actors know.

1907
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,420
Ah,
that's interesting.

1908
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:20,220
I don't,
I still do adjust to go from two

1909
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:23,970
different styles.
I W I don't know that it's difficult,

1910
01:22:24,270 --> 01:22:28,170
but I find the curb your enthusiasm way,
way more enjoyable.

1911
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,033
Oh,
I'm sure.

1912
01:22:29,070 --> 01:22:34,070
But I'm really proud the Goldbergs is
the number one show on tv that families

1913
01:22:34,351 --> 01:22:37,680
watch together.
So I'm very proud of that and I get why

1914
01:22:37,681 --> 01:22:40,080
people dig it.
It's not my style,

1915
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:43,200
but when I watch it occasionally,
I don't watch it very often.

1916
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:47,730
I get why people dig it.
I'm not confused by the show.

1917
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:48,180
Right,
right.

1918
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,340
You know what I mean?
Like these other shows we're talking

1919
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:53,700
about,
I'll be confused as to why they're

1920
01:22:53,701 --> 01:22:55,260
successful,
why they're on there.

1921
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:57,990
But other ones I watch,
like I watch monitor family.

1922
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,970
I get why people dig it.
Right,

1923
01:22:59,971 --> 01:23:00,300
right,
right.

1924
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,060
It makes total sense,
you know?

1925
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:04,660
Um,
so it's,

1926
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:06,100
it,
it's

1927
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:07,780
much more enjoyable during the curb
thing.

1928
01:23:07,781 --> 01:23:11,800
It's edgier and all that.
But I still dig the Goldbergs and I also

1929
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:15,870
dig the crew and I dig the people I work
with and I dig the writer.

1930
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:18,880
So it's a very positive,
wonderful experience.

1931
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:23,290
And I'm lucky I'm on one of the most
popular network comedies and among the

1932
01:23:23,291 --> 01:23:26,470
most popular alternative comedy.
How'd you get to be so lucky?

1933
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:28,360
What,
by the way,

1934
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:31,540
I'm grateful.
I keep on getting told in therapy.

1935
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,760
Don't say lucky so much.
I says,

1936
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:36,970
why is he telling you that?
Because grateful because I do have

1937
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:40,240
something to do with it,
but not from an ego standpoint,

1938
01:23:40,260 --> 01:23:42,670
but like I've worked hard.
I've done this,

1939
01:23:42,671 --> 01:23:46,030
I've done that.
So I'm just incredibly grateful.

1940
01:23:46,550 --> 01:23:48,520
You're lucky too.
I think I'm lucky.

1941
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,650
Grateful.
And by the way,

1942
01:23:50,651 --> 01:23:52,330
what have I told you?
I'm not kidding.

1943
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:54,370
That dude has taught me so much.

1944
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:56,560
That might be the only thing I disagree
with him on.

1945
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,060
Yeah,
he doesn't know shit.

1946
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:59,080
No.
Lucky is good.

1947
01:23:59,290 --> 01:23:59,891
Now,
Roger.

1948
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:03,420
Dot.
Roger Dog Daltrey uh,

1949
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:06,940
always said be lucky.
And it's the cause that means no matter

1950
01:24:06,941 --> 01:24:09,940
how great you are,
no matter how much you have to do with

1951
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:11,440
this or that,
if you look at it,

1952
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:13,440
that you're lucky being hung.
By the way,

1953
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,730
being humble is a big bullet.
People,

1954
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:18,730
the combination of being competent and
being humble,

1955
01:24:19,090 --> 01:24:21,010
you can't beat the being aware that you
know,

1956
01:24:21,011 --> 01:24:23,230
you could be born in Ethiopia.
You could have been,

1957
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:26,110
well Lorne,
that funny in the middle of nowhere.

1958
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:26,861
Yeah,
I,

1959
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:27,910
you know,
could have been fun.

1960
01:24:27,940 --> 01:24:29,350
I'm not big on ego.
Ego.

1961
01:24:29,351 --> 01:24:30,850
Ego screws me.
And by the way,

1962
01:24:30,851 --> 01:24:33,610
I was ignorant enough at one time to
think I can eliminate my ego.

1963
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:36,160
You can't.
You just got to recognize it when it

1964
01:24:36,161 --> 01:24:39,520
pops up,
recognize it and keep it under control

1965
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:40,930
and we'll just say,
hey man,

1966
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:41,793
don't need Ya.

1967
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:43,060
Thank you.
You know,

1968
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:46,990
some not going to ask to do something.
And as I'm thinking about it am my

1969
01:24:46,991 --> 01:24:49,930
saying yes to this out of an ego move.
You know,

1970
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,280
I've definitely done that before.
Yeah.

1971
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:53,290
Yeah.
I think that's,

1972
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,130
well one of the main reasons why
exercise so much just to try to keep my

1973
01:24:57,131 --> 01:24:59,740
body in balance in,
in not in terms of like the way it

1974
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:01,600
looks,
but so it doesn't get in the way.

1975
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,500
And I think that a lot of your body's in
balance then that helps your mind.

1976
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,820
Oh yeah.
And that helps your soul.

1977
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:07,840
Oh,
for sure not.

1978
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:09,640
It's not a vanity thing man.
That's,

1979
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,930
it is too.
I definitely like looking good while,

1980
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,030
but it's also,
but that,

1981
01:25:13,031 --> 01:25:16,830
I think that's more of a uh,
uh,

1982
01:25:17,740 --> 01:25:19,670
respecting yourself.
That's a,

1983
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:22,360
that's a self respecting to me.
There's definitely that,

1984
01:25:22,510 --> 01:25:23,350
but I think,
um,

1985
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:26,620
how new actually,
which is weird.

1986
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:29,470
Why is it weird?
Because that's not something that

1987
01:25:29,471 --> 01:25:31,840
people,
most people generally love.

1988
01:25:31,841 --> 01:25:33,610
They hate going to the gym,
but they go,

1989
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:37,390
you feel at your best when you're
exercising.

1990
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:40,600
That is amazing.
That is awesome.

1991
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:43,960
I wish I could have that for a week.
Just let me broward for a week.

1992
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:44,830
Just,
uh,

1993
01:25:44,830 --> 01:25:49,830
I'd always rather nap then do anything.
I don't mind stand up.

1994
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,310
I liked over napping,
sex over napping.

1995
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:57,570
Uh,
sometimes eating not as much anymore.

1996
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:01,320
It hasn't because it's not a big thing
for me to more so I'd say sex and,

1997
01:26:01,490 --> 01:26:02,640
and,
and,

1998
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:05,060
and,
and stand up and spending time with my

1999
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,900
boys that that takes precedence over at
my boys are 18 to 22.

2000
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:11,510
I'm madly in love with them.
And so,

2001
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:13,700
um,
that takes precedence.

2002
01:26:13,701 --> 01:26:16,140
I'd rather be with them than nab.
Yeah.

2003
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:17,210
By the way,
when they were little,

2004
01:26:17,540 --> 01:26:19,340
when they were little taking a nap with
them,

2005
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:20,240
I was in heaven.

2006
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,830
Yeah.
Cause I knew they were good.

2007
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:22,910
Yeah.
And they'd be laying,

2008
01:26:23,210 --> 01:26:26,510
laying against me.
Goodnight nurse.

2009
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:28,160
Yeah.
That's uh,

2010
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:30,830
the pleasure of having children.
I don't know,

2011
01:26:30,831 --> 01:26:34,850
like having these people that you love
more than you could ever have imagined.

2012
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:36,740
Loving someone more than,
by the way,

2013
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:38,840
that's the thing.
Like when someone's having a kid,

2014
01:26:38,930 --> 01:26:41,030
they're about to have a kid,
whether it's a woman or man,

2015
01:26:41,390 --> 01:26:43,070
I don't say to them,
oh you know,

2016
01:26:43,340 --> 01:26:46,940
because you can't explain it.
It's truly a thing that you can't

2017
01:26:46,941 --> 01:26:50,180
explain and you only sound like an idiot
when you try going,

2018
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,260
well,
here's what it is.

2019
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:54,800
No,
you can't tell me and to be unique to me

2020
01:26:55,130 --> 01:26:59,060
and it's so big,
much bigger than I ever could have

2021
01:26:59,061 --> 01:27:01,310
imagined.
It's a different thing than you can ever

2022
01:27:01,311 --> 01:27:03,380
imagine.
Like you become a different person too.

2023
01:27:03,410 --> 01:27:04,450
There's like a litter,
the,

2024
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:07,910
there's a,
an actual switch that seems to go off

2025
01:27:08,180 --> 01:27:12,290
and the change of course,
let me just say something cause you know

2026
01:27:12,291 --> 01:27:15,440
people at,
I know people were for whatever reason,

2027
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:18,650
that's,
which doesn't go off and they still stay

2028
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:21,200
the most important person in their own
lives.

2029
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:25,400
That's where it's weird and it throws me
and that's somebody I do not want to be

2030
01:27:25,401 --> 01:27:26,570
friends with.
No,

2031
01:27:26,571 --> 01:27:29,360
it's so people that are bad,
parents that don't like their kids.

2032
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:32,390
It's a unfollow area.
Unfortunate thing.

2033
01:27:32,391 --> 01:27:34,220
It's a big bowl of wrong.
It's such a,

2034
01:27:34,221 --> 01:27:36,740
it's so sad.
Painful.

2035
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:38,500
I think there's certain,
I mean I,

2036
01:27:38,650 --> 01:27:42,230
there has to be levels of sociopath's,
right?

2037
01:27:42,231 --> 01:27:44,270
There's levels of it.
I think there is,

2038
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:46,250
I mean that's just me.
I don't know anything about that topic,

2039
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:50,810
but must be UCC pull people with
sociopathic behavior and you just go,

2040
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:51,740
oh,
okay,

2041
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:55,280
well it's also the business that we're
in to the business solves them.

2042
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:59,240
Well for sure they want the ice to do a
joke about it.

2043
01:27:59,241 --> 01:28:04,241
That the problem with actors is that
they have this big hole in their soul

2044
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:07,130
that they need to fill up with other
people's attention.

2045
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:08,920
And I would say not me,
I'm different.

2046
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,490
That's how I am up here with a
microphone.

2047
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:11,421
Right.
Well by the way,

2048
01:28:11,421 --> 01:28:14,420
comedians are completely different than
then for the most part.

2049
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:17,360
Then actors.
But you also know that to be a great

2050
01:28:17,361 --> 01:28:18,800
actor,
you can be dumb as a rock.

2051
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,930
Oh yeah.
It's the only Ari's,

2052
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:22,880
it's the only art form.
Excuse me.

2053
01:28:22,881 --> 01:28:24,180
I had a little hiccup,
something,

2054
01:28:24,181 --> 01:28:27,680
something happened.
It's the only art form and I know plenty

2055
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:32,420
of really intelligent actors,
but I know some that are so talented.

2056
01:28:32,780 --> 01:28:35,480
And if I could never have a conversation
with them,

2057
01:28:35,481 --> 01:28:36,291
I'd be thrilled.
Oh,

2058
01:28:36,291 --> 01:28:38,570
it'd be amazing because they're just so
dumb.

2059
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:43,190
But when the time comes and they said
they can become that person,

2060
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,410
they can,
they can fall into that role and there's

2061
01:28:45,411 --> 01:28:47,240
something,
something wrong with them,

2062
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:49,640
what they could do it like Wayne
Fetterman has a bit about it,

2063
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:52,160
you know about,
unless you for just mentioning Wayne,

2064
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:54,010
Wayne Fetterman.
I love him so much.

2065
01:28:54,011 --> 01:28:56,310
A pilot with him way,
way back in the day room.

2066
01:28:56,690 --> 01:28:59,030
He's just,
he's so funny.

2067
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:02,820
He's a rock man and known him since I'm
20 years old.

2068
01:29:02,821 --> 01:29:04,860
I met when I first started doing comedy.
Oh Wow.

2069
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:06,690
We're from,
I'm from Chicago,

2070
01:29:06,691 --> 01:29:09,300
but I started comedy.
I had moved to Florida with my family,

2071
01:29:09,310 --> 01:29:12,330
south Florida,
and we're from the same little town in

2072
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:15,660
Florida called Plantation Florida
outside of Fort Lauderdale.

2073
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:20,310
We did a pilot together 20 years ago,
1998 I think it was.

2074
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:21,400
I think that was his last one.

2075
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,270
Might be right,
but I love him so much.

2076
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:31,230
He had a bit that he was doing on stage
once about actors and I grabbed him off

2077
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:32,460
stage.
Dude,

2078
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:35,430
you put it,
you said it like the way you said it,

2079
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:38,690
you said it the right cause it's like
also he's free,

2080
01:29:38,710 --> 01:29:40,200
right.
Because you know he's,

2081
01:29:40,230 --> 01:29:42,900
he doesn't have notoriety.
He's not worried about running into

2082
01:29:42,901 --> 01:29:46,470
these people that he talks shit about
onstage so you can be free.

2083
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:47,940
And he was like,
he was like,

2084
01:29:47,941 --> 01:29:50,100
it's not normal to be able to cry on
cue.

2085
01:29:50,340 --> 01:29:51,061
It's like,
yes,

2086
01:29:51,061 --> 01:29:52,530
you can cry on cue.
Yay.

2087
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:55,920
Cause you're fucking broken.
Is something wrong with you?

2088
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:00,060
By the way,
that's another change in the world of

2089
01:30:00,090 --> 01:30:03,810
standup.
The number of people who sew and this

2090
01:30:03,811 --> 01:30:07,500
started from the comedy boom when people
were getting set comes,

2091
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:11,040
actors saw this and they went,
oh,

2092
01:30:11,310 --> 01:30:13,920
if I do stand up,
I'll be discovered.

2093
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,960
Yes.
And um,

2094
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:21,200
so that's brought a lot of people that
aren't truly comedians to a comedy,

2095
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,140
which I can spot them.
There was a dude,

2096
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:26,670
he gets bought bottom.
Oh my God.

2097
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:28,440
Yes.
There was a dude in the laugh factory

2098
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,200
who was actually funny and he was
actually good.

2099
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:33,240
And he said,
if I don't,

2100
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:34,710
uh,
have a sitcom,

2101
01:30:34,711 --> 01:30:36,960
I'm quitting.
And by next year,

2102
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,990
and he didn't and he quit.
Wow.

2103
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,640
I don't remember his name.
Who could otherwise I'd tell you off

2104
01:30:41,641 --> 01:30:42,740
there,
I'll talk to you about it.

2105
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:43,920
Fortunately,
no.

2106
01:30:43,921 --> 01:30:45,840
So,
but the point being is,

2107
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:51,140
is that if you're really a comedian,
it is so part of your DNA.

2108
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,300
It is so part of who you know.
But it was like,

2109
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:56,670
it's not who I am.
No comedians.

2110
01:30:56,790 --> 01:31:00,930
It's part of who we are on a deep,
deep level.

2111
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:06,290
The Passion and caring the comedians
truly have for comedy.

2112
01:31:07,410 --> 01:31:11,340
And that's why I look at other comedians
as my brothers and sisters.

2113
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:15,300
So if you're dealing with ego,
if you're dealing with a,

2114
01:31:15,301 --> 01:31:17,280
you're an actor,
you're trying to get famous.

2115
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:20,520
If you're dealing with the competition
that I got no part of you,

2116
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:25,020
when you look at me and you go,
Jeff Garlin has no choice but to be a

2117
01:31:25,021 --> 01:31:27,240
comedian,
then you're thinking on the same

2118
01:31:27,241 --> 01:31:29,460
wavelength as me because I have no
choice.

2119
01:31:29,461 --> 01:31:31,360
I have to be a comedian.
Yeah.

2120
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:34,260
Some people get very,
very resentful of those actors.

2121
01:31:34,290 --> 01:31:36,930
Like,
why don't I get resentful of him and I,

2122
01:31:37,090 --> 01:31:41,160
there's plenty of room and I remember
some famous actors trying stand up,

2123
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,220
you know,
in anyone would try it.

2124
01:31:43,240 --> 01:31:45,120
And the eighties like,
I remember,

2125
01:31:45,121 --> 01:31:46,250
um,
well she's uh,

2126
01:31:46,290 --> 01:31:48,300
what's her name?
She was Sean Young.

2127
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:49,021
Is that a no?
Yeah,

2128
01:31:49,021 --> 01:31:49,531
yeah,
yeah.

2129
01:31:49,531 --> 01:31:53,340
She was coming into the Improv and I
remember she was doing standup was,

2130
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,320
but hers was full of Shit.

2131
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:58,680
So I was like,
I was the only one there who didn't help

2132
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,580
her.
Everyone bent over backwards.

2133
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:03,220
But she wasn't sincere and she did it
for five minutes,

2134
01:32:03,550 --> 01:32:05,980
but they like being around a famous
woman who is beautiful,

2135
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:08,890
you know,
but the point being is that people

2136
01:32:08,891 --> 01:32:11,020
forgot about it.
Anyone can do whatever they want,

2137
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:13,570
but do me a favor,
if you're going down that path,

2138
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:18,760
don't screw me with your negative shit.
She's an interesting case.

2139
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,640
Um,
I read a whole article about her and

2140
01:32:21,641 --> 01:32:23,980
fame and her struggles with it and you
know,

2141
01:32:23,981 --> 01:32:26,320
you got people forget she was in the
original blade runner.

2142
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,140
She was a phenomenal actress and so
beautiful,

2143
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,360
stunning,
stunning,

2144
01:32:30,490 --> 01:32:32,410
but so good too.
I mean,

2145
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:37,411
just so a probably was a very
intelligent woman and there were flaws

2146
01:32:38,740 --> 01:32:41,290
in her life and flaws and being an
actress.

2147
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:45,130
And by the way,
being in the public eye is not,

2148
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:49,240
especially now with social media,
is the opposite of a walk in the park.

2149
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:53,830
And you,
I am not entitled to any privacy.

2150
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:58,210
I am not entitled to any alone moments
when I'm walking in a park.

2151
01:32:58,270 --> 01:33:00,700
I'm not.
And that saves me to look at it that

2152
01:33:00,701 --> 01:33:01,360
way.
Yeah.

2153
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:05,530
That I'm not entitled to it.
Because if I want to be alone,

2154
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:08,710
I'm going to stay in my living room.
I'm going to sit in my back yard and

2155
01:33:08,711 --> 01:33:11,590
look up at the trees and the breeze,
man,

2156
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:12,550
oh,
I can't see the breeze,

2157
01:33:12,551 --> 01:33:15,780
but I can feel the breeze.
But the point being is they're there.

2158
01:33:15,820 --> 01:33:20,620
The world of any privacy for you in the
public eye gone.

2159
01:33:20,830 --> 01:33:22,690
Yeah.
And you know when I'm at like a

2160
01:33:22,691 --> 01:33:25,720
restaurant or the airport and the TMZ,
people coming with their microphone,

2161
01:33:26,050 --> 01:33:30,670
I don't say a word.
Why help them sell that crap and then

2162
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:33,880
they turn off the mic and they know this
at this point now and I'm very friendly.

2163
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,260
How are you guys doing?
What's going on?

2164
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:39,430
And I know some of them,
but I don't have the right to walk

2165
01:33:39,431 --> 01:33:41,050
through the airport without them in my
face.

2166
01:33:41,051 --> 01:33:44,980
That's part of the thing.
The demand of a get out of those is you

2167
01:33:44,981 --> 01:33:47,830
say something stupid and people get mad
at you like,

2168
01:33:47,831 --> 01:33:51,610
and any board,
they only thing you get out of that is

2169
01:33:51,611 --> 01:33:55,240
saying something stupid and people get
mad at you.

2170
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,160
There's no winning,
there's no time.

2171
01:33:57,161 --> 01:33:59,830
What you're going to say something to
Tmz and people are going to watch it and

2172
01:33:59,831 --> 01:34:02,680
go,
that was so damaged cycle possible.

2173
01:34:02,710 --> 01:34:06,520
It's certainly possible.
You can blow that out of time on long

2174
01:34:06,521 --> 01:34:08,680
shot.
That is such a long shot.

2175
01:34:09,130 --> 01:34:11,140
Specifically tmz.
Yeah,

2176
01:34:11,170 --> 01:34:14,740
but bordain got a shitload of death
threats when uh,

2177
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:18,610
he was at the airport and they said if
you were going to cook dinner for a

2178
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,700
trump and Kim Jong own,
what would you serve?

2179
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:22,990
And he said,
hemlock,

2180
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:24,700
you know,
just a joke.

2181
01:34:24,701 --> 01:34:27,490
He's a funny guy.
He said something funny and uh,

2182
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:28,450
no,
but see that's the thing.

2183
01:34:29,140 --> 01:34:30,340
There's no winning.
Yeah,

2184
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:33,910
there's no winning because by the way,
he could say that at a dinner party.

2185
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:35,650
Right.
You know what I mean?

2186
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,200
Yeah.
And if someone's offended than their

2187
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,043
tool,
right.

2188
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:39,670
You know,
he could say that by the way,

2189
01:34:39,671 --> 01:34:42,910
you could say that in a room full of 11
republicans.

2190
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,320
Yes.
And they will laugh.

2191
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,340
Yeah,
but you're opening yourself when you'd

2192
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:49,960
say that's right.
So I don't say anything.

2193
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:52,300
You know,
you can ask me comments about things

2194
01:34:52,301 --> 01:34:56,920
that go on in the world and I know I'll
have an answer that will not get me in

2195
01:34:56,930 --> 01:34:58,160
trouble.
That's the case

2196
01:34:58,160 --> 01:34:59,270
today with comedy,
right?

2197
01:34:59,271 --> 01:35:01,730
It's like you're opening yourself up to
the world.

2198
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,720
You're not just opening yourself up on
people.

2199
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:08,420
Over.
When I went onstage was ever in fear of

2200
01:35:08,421 --> 01:35:13,421
going down a path where I would say
something that was wildly inappropriate,

2201
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:15,530
not,
well,

2202
01:35:15,530 --> 01:35:17,900
not inappropriate for the standpoint of
taking a risk,

2203
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:22,850
but just because my sense of humor
doesn't go the way to use certain words.

2204
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:27,200
Like I don't use that word.
Not because I'm scared of anything.

2205
01:35:27,470 --> 01:35:29,050
Um,
but uh,

2206
01:35:29,630 --> 01:35:32,050
so people who do that and do that,
it's like,

2207
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,120
like Michael Richards.
Michael Richard.

2208
01:35:35,121 --> 01:35:35,954
Yeah,
the pool.

2209
01:35:36,280 --> 01:35:37,400
By the way,
example,

2210
01:35:37,401 --> 01:35:39,170
by the way,
you know when he walked off stage,

2211
01:35:39,171 --> 01:35:41,990
and I think it might've been Tom Papa
who was standing in the corner,

2212
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:47,470
he went up to him and went a weird crowd
having no idea that his life was over as

2213
01:35:48,471 --> 01:35:49,304
he knew it.

2214
01:35:50,180 --> 01:35:54,350
Because by the way,
I remember being furious because certain

2215
01:35:54,351 --> 01:35:58,100
people that came down to them on the
news like the next day or two where

2216
01:35:58,101 --> 01:36:02,240
people who I had heard say worst things
in their standup and they were talking

2217
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:03,740
shit,
they were talking stuff.

2218
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:06,320
It's like when someone's swimming in a
river of Shit,

2219
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:08,270
you don't throw shit on them.
I agree.

2220
01:36:08,330 --> 01:36:09,560
Let them swim in there.
Shit,

2221
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:12,140
have a good time.
You chose to get in the shit,

2222
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:15,200
you know,
but I'm not going to throw shit.

2223
01:36:15,201 --> 01:36:18,260
And that's loaded with shit how I felt
with Roseanne,

2224
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:20,420
you know,
and this Roseanne Buddy went down,

2225
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:25,460
you need to say anything else except she
really needs some sort of help.

2226
01:36:25,731 --> 01:36:27,740
And support.
Not like,

2227
01:36:27,890 --> 01:36:30,230
oh,
she's a Nazi or she's a horrible person.

2228
01:36:30,440 --> 01:36:30,681
No,
no,

2229
01:36:30,681 --> 01:36:32,240
no.
She needs help.

2230
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:32,780
Yeah,
she,

2231
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:37,490
and that's the whole thing.
Why do I need to do art when Harvey

2232
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:39,530
Weinstein or any of these fuckers come
out?

2233
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,770
I don't have a twitter account because I
also know just like Tmz,

2234
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:45,320
how long until I say something that
pisses somebody off.

2235
01:36:45,321 --> 01:36:47,930
Right.
But there are people,

2236
01:36:48,290 --> 01:36:51,080
and I'm not saying their names,
I don't want to get into a thing who

2237
01:36:51,081 --> 01:36:52,730
will come out and go,
gentlemen,

2238
01:36:52,731 --> 01:36:55,580
that's not the way to behave.
Or you know what I mean?

2239
01:36:55,581 --> 01:36:56,630
Like,
but I really do.

2240
01:36:56,631 --> 01:37:01,631
I need to say rape is bad.
Do I need to say hauling a successful,

2241
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:07,670
accomplished black woman?
Something bad is bad.

2242
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:09,740
No,
you don't need my comment.

2243
01:37:09,950 --> 01:37:13,430
All these people on twitter to think
their comments necessary.

2244
01:37:13,550 --> 01:37:14,870
Oh,
I need to add into this.

2245
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,910
I need to be part of this dialogue.
No.

2246
01:37:16,940 --> 01:37:18,080
Well,
it's virtue signaling.

2247
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:20,860
You know,
it's letting everybody know the suicide

2248
01:37:20,980 --> 01:37:23,230
and I'm on the right side.
It's a bunch of crap.

2249
01:37:23,260 --> 01:37:27,830
But it was a want people to assume that
I making the right choice.

2250
01:37:27,831 --> 01:37:30,500
I want people to assume because they're
not going to hear what my choice.

2251
01:37:30,501 --> 01:37:33,980
So there's a guy who was a journalist
who is angry and he was saying that the

2252
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:38,981
lack of a blow back from other comedians
about Louis C K that they weren't

2253
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:43,280
screening and how horrible this is
speaks volumes.

2254
01:37:43,610 --> 01:37:45,740
And I was like,
[inaudible] don't know what you're

2255
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:48,410
talking about.
That's what speaks volumes about this

2256
01:37:48,411 --> 01:37:50,540
dude.
He doesn't know what he's talking about,

2257
01:37:50,660 --> 01:37:51,210
by the way.
Shit,

2258
01:37:51,210 --> 01:37:53,540
anyone disrespect a woman to mend my
knowledge.

2259
01:37:53,541 --> 01:37:56,040
Never.
Should anyone be sexually forward in

2260
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,630
a room and a woman in an inappropriate
way?

2261
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:01,820
No.
Do I need to say that she ever yell out

2262
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:05,130
and say this is wrong.
No,

2263
01:38:05,131 --> 01:38:06,530
this is,
I'm telling you this is then,

2264
01:38:06,570 --> 01:38:07,403
no,
it's wrong.

2265
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,300
I know.
I know.

2266
01:38:09,330 --> 01:38:13,530
Five days of it coming out of him
admitting that he did it right though.

2267
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:15,060
The whole thing was crazy.
Like you know,

2268
01:38:15,130 --> 01:38:18,780
this guy was accusing all these other
communities of being pieces of shit

2269
01:38:18,781 --> 01:38:21,180
because they are not wrong.
They're not.

2270
01:38:22,030 --> 01:38:25,860
You don't need my opinion designation of
something.

2271
01:38:26,430 --> 01:38:28,500
If someone's swimming in a river of
shit,

2272
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:31,230
I do not need to throw shit in that
river.

2273
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:33,960
It's like,
what are your requirements as a person

2274
01:38:33,961 --> 01:38:35,910
when something happens,
if there's a mass shooting,

2275
01:38:35,911 --> 01:38:38,370
do I need to stand up and say that that
was a bad thing,

2276
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,070
right?
No,

2277
01:38:39,070 --> 01:38:39,871
no.
It's obvious.

2278
01:38:39,871 --> 01:38:40,770
That was a bad thing.

2279
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:43,020
I don't,
why do I need to comment on everything

2280
01:38:43,021 --> 01:38:44,640
that happened?
I need to come in and if that's the

2281
01:38:44,641 --> 01:38:46,890
case,
is there an action I can do to help

2282
01:38:46,910 --> 01:38:49,620
write it or was it just commenting?
Which does nothing.

2283
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:51,300
Nothing.
Nothing.

2284
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:51,871
Oh,
really?

2285
01:38:51,871 --> 01:38:53,430
You're letting us know.
That's what I'm saying.

2286
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:56,940
These certain individuals,
and I'm thinking of two in particular

2287
01:38:56,941 --> 01:38:59,660
who I know and like both of them.
Can you do three of them?

2288
01:38:59,661 --> 01:39:01,480
Are there three of them?
Actually one,

2289
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:03,150
I don't know as well.
No,

2290
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:08,100
but I'll tell you afterwards.
I'm always in these situations.

2291
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,840
Say the obvious like,
yeah,

2292
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,200
who wouldn't believe that?
And I get furious.

2293
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:16,920
Especially,
one of them's a great old friend of mine

2294
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:19,320
and it's just a comment every time and
it's like,

2295
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:21,390
yeah,
I have a friend that does the same

2296
01:39:21,391 --> 01:39:22,140
thing.
Uh,

2297
01:39:22,140 --> 01:39:25,260
who's a an accomplished stand up and
it's always,

2298
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:27,930
how do I word this without giving this
guy away?

2299
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:32,070
It's always about anything that has
anything to do with women.

2300
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,380
And like he's always standing up for
women.

2301
01:39:34,381 --> 01:39:36,540
But meanwhile I knew I was kind of lives
in hell.

2302
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:38,430
I know he lives in hell.
Like his marriage,

2303
01:39:38,431 --> 01:39:41,700
his shit,
he like literally hides like he's,

2304
01:39:41,701 --> 01:39:43,260
he's in hell,
he's in hell.

2305
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:45,000
His wife's a monster.
It's amazing.

2306
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:46,350
It's amazing though,
by the way.

2307
01:39:46,351 --> 01:39:48,000
Isn't that amazing though?
It is.

2308
01:39:48,180 --> 01:39:50,850
It's just like,
they almost like,

2309
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:55,050
he's like holding like when the divorce
comes like down the line,

2310
01:39:55,051 --> 01:39:59,520
which is definitely an come,
like at least [inaudible] guy.

2311
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:02,310
I will have a reverent conversations
with my friends,

2312
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:03,720
drinking coffee,
hanging out.

2313
01:40:04,140 --> 01:40:06,360
Sometimes I'll even talk too loud in the
coffee shop.

2314
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:07,270
Hey,
it's tongue and cheek,

2315
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:08,080
but fun.
But,

2316
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,810
but I will,
I'm not,

2317
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:11,400
by the way,
here's another one.

2318
01:40:11,401 --> 01:40:15,210
You know the worst possible things you
could ever hear.

2319
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:17,940
Comedians at the funeral,
comedian dies.

2320
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,640
What comedians are saying to one
another.

2321
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:26,660
It is stuff that would be unforgiven
unforgiven but it's just the way we deal

2322
01:40:27,031 --> 01:40:30,750
with grief in those situations.
It's also the inappropriate thing at

2323
01:40:30,751 --> 01:40:33,300
that time is very funny to someone like
you or I.

2324
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:34,740
Very,
very fun.

2325
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:39,000
I was sitting right next to Dave Foley
and we went to the emmy's and Phil

2326
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,750
Hartman had just been murdered and he
was nominated for an emmy and he lost to

2327
01:40:42,751 --> 01:40:45,400
this guy from frasier.
And uh,

2328
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,830
Dave looks over at me.
He goes,

2329
01:40:46,831 --> 01:40:48,300
what the fuck's the guy I have to do to
win?

2330
01:40:49,140 --> 01:40:52,560
That's a great,
and we were like crying,

2331
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:54,190
sad.
We're drinking

2332
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,440
and we're just so bummed out.
It is death.

2333
01:40:56,510 --> 01:40:57,980
Right?
And then Dave says that,

2334
01:40:57,981 --> 01:40:59,890
and then he says,
it was like a total straight face.

2335
01:40:59,891 --> 01:41:01,210
What the fuck's going to have to do to
win?

2336
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,480
That's really funny because in the
moment it was just that.

2337
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:10,170
But we say the most inappropriate things
in tragic moments to make each other

2338
01:41:10,171 --> 01:41:11,190
laugh,
to make Jews left.

2339
01:41:11,191 --> 01:41:12,810
But I'm not going to say them on my
twitter.

2340
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,130
No,
I'm not going to say them to other

2341
01:41:14,131 --> 01:41:15,360
people.
By the way,

2342
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:20,450
anytime I've ever tried something sort
of inside with someone not on the

2343
01:41:21,961 --> 01:41:23,430
inside.
In terms of comedy,

2344
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:28,200
it has been a disaster.
Disaster every time.

2345
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:30,960
How about you?
I'm talking to even privately like like

2346
01:41:30,961 --> 01:41:34,680
with at a party or something or what
about with your kids,

2347
01:41:34,980 --> 01:41:36,480
parents,
your kids,

2348
01:41:36,481 --> 01:41:37,530
friends,
parents.

2349
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:42,150
The way the,
the biggest fights with my wife,

2350
01:41:42,330 --> 01:41:46,170
I look back over the years are when we
either went to the principal,

2351
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,430
we went to have the meeting,
we went to the open house.

2352
01:41:49,830 --> 01:41:53,910
Something I said I never left there
unscathed.

2353
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:59,260
The only one that you couldn't get that
mad at me for was I convinced our tour

2354
01:42:00,001 --> 01:42:02,400
of a school that the building was
haunted.

2355
01:42:03,030 --> 01:42:06,900
That was the only time where she went.
That was kind of funny.

2356
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:09,930
But you freaked everybody out,
including the school officials.

2357
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:12,210
So yeah,
inappropriate.

2358
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,630
You're inappropriate,
Jeff Garlin you're my big bowl of

2359
01:42:15,631 --> 01:42:17,680
inappropriate half but,
but,

2360
01:42:17,730 --> 01:42:19,650
but it's sort of how we get through
life.

2361
01:42:19,710 --> 01:42:24,710
We meaning comedians and and,
and the thing is we're wired alike.

2362
01:42:25,021 --> 01:42:26,550
We are,
we share,

2363
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:31,380
I'm not going to say DNA,
but we share something where a brother

2364
01:42:31,381 --> 01:42:35,340
and sister had worked together.
So I remember coming off stage,

2365
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:39,480
this is like a classic one coming off
stage of caroline's doing a benefit and

2366
01:42:39,481 --> 01:42:41,180
they're not coming after waiting to go
onstage.

2367
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:44,490
Cohen's Onstage,
Colin Quinn and he's fucking eating it

2368
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:46,770
and I'm thinking,
this crowd sucks.

2369
01:42:46,771 --> 01:42:49,110
Fuck them,
but I'm going to go do my best.

2370
01:42:49,111 --> 01:42:52,740
It's a benefit.
Some guy comes up to me and he says,

2371
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,000
I can't wait to go up.

2372
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:54,571
I go,
thanks.

2373
01:42:54,571 --> 01:42:56,070
He goes,
this guy again,

2374
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:57,930
I go,
just know you're talking about my

2375
01:42:57,931 --> 01:43:00,900
brother.
My brother is standing up there doing

2376
01:43:00,901 --> 01:43:03,750
that.
You're not complimenting me if you're

2377
01:43:03,751 --> 01:43:05,820
fucking with my brother.
That's what I told them.

2378
01:43:06,150 --> 01:43:07,570
Because it's the truth,
right?

2379
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:10,470
We are together.
We experienced something.

2380
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:14,430
But that's what I'm saying.
There's a uniqueness and a specialist

2381
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:19,470
and not everybody is part of that.
Everybody is an actor trying not,

2382
01:43:19,471 --> 01:43:22,320
I mean a lot of people were actors.
A lot people are any cause their ego,

2383
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,700
their singing voice,
maybe it wasn't good enough.

2384
01:43:24,701 --> 01:43:25,890
Like I'm just saying,
it's like,

2385
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:29,850
and by the way,
the people that I have problems with

2386
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:35,270
almost never are true comedians yet to
where it's the brother,

2387
01:43:35,461 --> 01:43:37,020
you know?
And like we're really,

2388
01:43:37,290 --> 01:43:38,760
when we're together,
you know,

2389
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:41,460
it's almost never,
it's always ego people.

2390
01:43:41,610 --> 01:43:45,150
And it's always people that are doing it
for the wrong reasons.

2391
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:48,000
And by the way,
it's not me sitting in judgment.

2392
01:43:48,270 --> 01:43:52,130
It's me getting what they give me.
And by the way,

2393
01:43:52,131 --> 01:43:54,200
I don't have conflicts with them.
I let them,

2394
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:56,360
you know,
that's something I learned a long time

2395
01:43:56,361 --> 01:43:58,610
ago.
That's ego to put my shit on them.

2396
01:43:58,611 --> 01:43:59,300
Right,
right.

2397
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:02,480
But I drive home feeling sad so I avoid
doing,

2398
01:44:02,520 --> 01:44:04,450
I've learned to not have conflicts.
Took,

2399
01:44:04,540 --> 01:44:05,373
took a while.

2400
01:44:06,090 --> 01:44:07,430
I would disagree with something.
I'd be like,

2401
01:44:07,431 --> 01:44:09,950
fuck you,
but that fuck you doesn't get anywhere.

2402
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:13,630
It's like the same thing as like when
something happens and you complained

2403
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:14,410
about it on twitter,

2404
01:44:14,410 --> 01:44:17,320
but I am not chasing Jane.
Let's talk about change.

2405
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,420
Did you read about that girl from
Sweden,

2406
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:20,740
from Sweden,
maybe.

2407
01:44:21,100 --> 01:44:24,310
Who got on the airplane with the guy who
was both sent to Afghanistan.

2408
01:44:24,311 --> 01:44:28,030
I did read that this morning.
I have never been more,

2409
01:44:28,510 --> 01:44:31,120
I think I was being deported and would
sit down.

2410
01:44:31,150 --> 01:44:33,790
She knew when he gets back he's going to
die.

2411
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:35,440
He's going to be murdered.
This guy,

2412
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:37,060
that was her attitude.
What is the stuff,

2413
01:44:37,061 --> 01:44:40,030
cause I only read the headline of it,
the whole story.

2414
01:44:40,031 --> 01:44:43,840
So she's on the plane specifically
bought a ticket knowing that he's being

2415
01:44:43,841 --> 01:44:45,210
deported.
So she did it on purpose.

2416
01:44:45,211 --> 01:44:47,260
She's an activist.
She's an activist,

2417
01:44:47,261 --> 01:44:49,060
but I don't know what she's done in the
past.

2418
01:44:49,061 --> 01:44:54,061
All I know is she refused to sit down
and at a certain point there was a

2419
01:44:55,091 --> 01:44:57,280
soccer team on the flight,
stood up with her.

2420
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:59,770
There were other people who said we back
you.

2421
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:02,800
But there were also a lot of pieces of
shit.

2422
01:45:03,190 --> 01:45:05,290
Shut down.
You're making us late.

2423
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:10,600
So one's going to die and look at her
putting herself on the line.

2424
01:45:10,840 --> 01:45:13,990
And then she was,
as she and the guy who was being

2425
01:45:13,991 --> 01:45:16,180
deported,
we're finally escorted off the plane

2426
01:45:16,390 --> 01:45:20,710
because she did her research and her
research told her that the captain can

2427
01:45:20,711 --> 01:45:23,170
have them both taken off the plane and
take off.

2428
01:45:23,171 --> 01:45:23,580
Anyway,

2429
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:26,760
so the,
the story was that he was being deported

2430
01:45:26,761 --> 01:45:28,610
because of ice.
Is that what it was?

2431
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:29,550
See,
I did,

2432
01:45:29,550 --> 01:45:32,230
I only read the one either in the gym.
So,

2433
01:45:32,250 --> 01:45:34,860
but he,
they were deporting him and then he was

2434
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:37,200
going to get sent back to Afghanistan
where he was going to be killed.

2435
01:45:37,230 --> 01:45:40,750
Yes.
We live in a weird time when we come to

2436
01:45:42,030 --> 01:45:44,940
start our story,
I was reading about some woman who was

2437
01:45:44,970 --> 01:45:47,370
devastated because her,
um,

2438
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:52,260
her daughter in law was being deported
and choose a trump supporter and her

2439
01:45:52,261 --> 01:45:54,990
daughter in law was being,
she's been in the United States,

2440
01:45:55,310 --> 01:45:57,270
uh,
her whole life and,

2441
01:45:57,271 --> 01:45:59,670
uh,
being deported and you know,

2442
01:45:59,671 --> 01:46:01,090
just couldn't,
couldn't believe it,

2443
01:46:01,230 --> 01:46:01,810
couldn't,
you know,

2444
01:46:01,810 --> 01:46:04,980
came over here as an infant,
that kind of thing that when you're an

2445
01:46:04,981 --> 01:46:07,890
illegal alien that no one gives a fuck.
Have you been here for 30 years?

2446
01:46:07,891 --> 01:46:09,760
You only been alive for 32 they don't
get it.

2447
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:13,140
You get sent back and that's,
that's a disgrace.

2448
01:46:13,410 --> 01:46:14,490
It really is a disgrace.

2449
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:15,361
No,
it's a horrible,

2450
01:46:15,361 --> 01:46:17,190
it's a horrible thing.
And you like,

2451
01:46:17,191 --> 01:46:19,260
well,
why don't you fucking to this young

2452
01:46:19,261 --> 01:46:21,060
girl,
young girl,

2453
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:24,630
but believing so strongly that she
bought a ticket,

2454
01:46:24,990 --> 01:46:28,260
got on the plane and then wouldn't sit
down.

2455
01:46:28,261 --> 01:46:30,990
But what happens now though?
What if the guy's still gets sent back?

2456
01:46:31,350 --> 01:46:32,560
Kill,
but she's still,

2457
01:46:32,760 --> 01:46:34,620
she should do.
She had something.

2458
01:46:34,621 --> 01:46:38,280
She did something and maybe he won't.
You don't know.

2459
01:46:39,180 --> 01:46:41,940
But that's more than just her putting on
her twitter account.

2460
01:46:42,240 --> 01:46:45,960
This is not right being deported.
This is someone actually doing

2461
01:46:45,961 --> 01:46:49,590
something,
doing something that doesn't injure

2462
01:46:49,650 --> 01:46:53,010
somebody else and it can inconvenience
as people,

2463
01:46:53,310 --> 01:46:55,560
but nothing more than that.
What if you had a layover though?

2464
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,630
He had a big gig.
What have I had?

2465
01:46:57,631 --> 01:46:58,250
A layover?
Yeah,

2466
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:00,090
it was a huge drama.
I'm on her side.

2467
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:01,710
I know that from the gift.
Yes.

2468
01:47:01,830 --> 01:47:02,790
Sold out crowd.

2469
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:03,780
No,
I don't care.

2470
01:47:03,980 --> 01:47:05,760
I'm filming a Netflix special.
No.

2471
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:08,100
Are you going to film a special?
I am next.

2472
01:47:08,101 --> 01:47:11,280
Next spring.
So when you do that or I'm done with the

2473
01:47:11,281 --> 01:47:14,130
Goldbergs and curb,
I'm going to do a Netflix special.

2474
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:17,080
So a year from now,
essentially somewhere in the range in

2475
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:19,590
the summer,
less than a year from now.

2476
01:47:19,740 --> 01:47:23,430
So when you do that,
will you change your approach where you

2477
01:47:23,431 --> 01:47:26,430
have an outline like you do on curb and
like roughly,

2478
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:28,320
um,
know what you're going to talk about?

2479
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:32,370
I W I have stories and things I've been
telling on stage that have been coming

2480
01:47:32,371 --> 01:47:34,830
out of me,
so I will tell all those,

2481
01:47:34,831 --> 01:47:35,940
but I will,
I'm doing,

2482
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:40,860
uh,
three different locations here in La and

2483
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:43,260
three different shows.
So you're going to film it here.

2484
01:47:43,380 --> 01:47:45,630
I'm filming in here,
three shows.

2485
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:47,400
I'm not doing a big theater.

2486
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:49,800
I mean I,
I played big theaters,

2487
01:47:49,801 --> 01:47:53,820
but that doesn't help me for a special,
that's just the typical,

2488
01:47:54,030 --> 01:47:56,450
come out to the big applause.
Do My schtick.

2489
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:57,390
Goodnight everybody.
Right,

2490
01:47:57,391 --> 01:47:57,931
right.
No,

2491
01:47:57,931 --> 01:47:59,790
I'm going to actually,
uh,

2492
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:00,550
Tom,
uh,

2493
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:03,330
um,
Papa's going to actually direct this was

2494
01:48:03,331 --> 01:48:05,040
his idea.
Um,

2495
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:09,990
it's going to follow me around during
the day and then how my day comes into

2496
01:48:09,991 --> 01:48:12,030
my show that night.
Beautiful.

2497
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:12,830
Yeah.
So,

2498
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:16,920
but I'll have some prepared,
but between three shows I should get

2499
01:48:16,921 --> 01:48:19,380
enough and you know,
hopefully it'll be an interesting thing.

2500
01:48:19,381 --> 01:48:22,110
That's what I aspire to do.
Make something worthwhile and

2501
01:48:22,111 --> 01:48:25,050
interesting as opposed to billing my
ego.

2502
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:26,460
I don't care.
Can we do this again?

2503
01:48:26,461 --> 01:48:28,740
Sometime my friend,
I am honored.

2504
01:48:28,741 --> 01:48:32,160
It's,
it's too long and coming and I am,

2505
01:48:32,220 --> 01:48:34,800
I'm thrilled to have been here.
People ask me,

2506
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:35,221
I'm like,
you know,

2507
01:48:35,221 --> 01:48:36,420
I don't really know Joe.

2508
01:48:36,630 --> 01:48:39,400
I go put the first chance I get,
which was the other night when I saw

2509
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:40,830
where it was like,
oh,

2510
01:48:40,831 --> 01:48:43,140
hey,
can I do the thing I really want to?

2511
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,371
And you're like,
yeah,

2512
01:48:44,371 --> 01:48:45,250
sure.
You know,

2513
01:48:45,251 --> 01:48:46,590
it was,
it was so simple.

2514
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:49,590
But people have said to me all the time,
go on the show.

2515
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:50,430
And I'm like,
yeah,

2516
01:48:50,431 --> 01:48:51,450
I will.
You know,

2517
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:56,580
but being busy like yourself,
it's not like that opportune or I have a

2518
01:48:56,581 --> 01:48:58,510
list called Joe,
you know?

2519
01:48:58,590 --> 01:48:59,240
Right.
Yeah.

2520
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:00,480
So we did it.
We did,

2521
01:49:00,540 --> 01:49:02,310
it works.
And I will again,

2522
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:04,020
anytime you want to do it.
Yes,

2523
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:05,220
it works.
It was an honor.

2524
01:49:05,221 --> 01:49:06,720
This was great.
I had a ball.

2525
01:49:06,780 --> 01:49:07,613
I enjoyed it.
Yeah.

2526
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:08,250
Thank you,
man.

2527
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,530
Jeff Garlin Lazy Gentlemen.
Thanks,

2528
01:49:10,531 --> 01:49:11,400
brother.
Thank you.
