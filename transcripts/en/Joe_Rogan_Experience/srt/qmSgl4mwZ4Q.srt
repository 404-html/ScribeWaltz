00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:03,641
It's,

3
00:00:03,641 --> 00:00:04,830
it's just so weird.

4
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:05,693
It's so weird.

5
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,220
We're,

6
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,350
we played in front of half a million
people and half a million people,

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,150
and this was in Russia.

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:12,910
This was,

9
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,650
uh,

10
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,580
an airfield.

11
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,050
Oh my God.

12
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:16,950
So we've done that.

13
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,570
What the fuck was that like?

14
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:19,883
Um,

15
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,650
it was a c c of Russian people.

16
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,101
I mean,

17
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:23,950
that's what it was.

18
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:24,610
That's insane.

19
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,400
This was in 1991,

20
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,410
91 91 when the,

21
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:28,861
you know,

22
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,870
the curtain came down and all of that,

23
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:34,950
and a Time Warner had a,

24
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,784
uh,

25
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:36,210
uh,

26
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,610
they wanted to basically
get their foot in the door.

27
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,310
And so they were created a free concert.

28
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,210
Uh,

29
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,043
it was,

30
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,630
it was a ACDC,

31
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,500
us,

32
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,251
Pantera,

33
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:50,670
and I think maybe a local
band or some other bands.

34
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,481
I'm sorry if,

35
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:52,081
I can't remember.

36
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,420
But they flew us in there.

37
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,070
We landed in this airfield.

38
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,311
Oh,

39
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,180
Motley crew was on it,

40
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,100
um,

41
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,270
landed in this airfield.

42
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,340
And as far as the eye could see it,

43
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:02,451
I mean,

44
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:04,830
it was a free concert
and it was just people,

45
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,210
and we get on stage and do what we do.

46
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,793
But there were,

47
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,030
it was military,

48
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:12,241
you know,

49
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:14,120
military and the Front Christ,

50
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,210
look at that photo.

51
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,620
Holy Shit.

52
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,320
Holy Shit.

53
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:19,621
Jamie.

54
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,880
Go full screen with that.

55
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,143
Okay.

56
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,550
Just go with that one.

57
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,990
What in the fuck.

58
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,850
Oh my God.

59
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:28,140
That's insane.

60
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,003
Is that it?

61
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,790
Is that the one?

62
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,530
Ooh,

63
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,100
that might be something else,

64
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:33,300
but it looks a little newer,

65
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,270
but it says here it was
from 91 mosque house.

66
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,050
Wow.

67
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,750
Uh,

68
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,200
yeah.

69
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,220
Pretty remarkable.

70
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:38,881
And there were,

71
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,270
dude,

72
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,040
imagine a sea of people like that and see
there's a helicopter helicopter flying

73
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,090
over people.

74
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:45,630
I mean,

75
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,291
God,

76
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,610
if that thing goes down,

77
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,700
oh it could be chopping up off photo.

78
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:52,801
Go right up there.

79
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,290
That one on stage facing those people.

80
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,610
All my God,

81
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:59,280
that is fucking insane.

82
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:03,450
And that helicopter would come down close
and they were yelling at people like,

83
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:03,960
stop.

84
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,230
You know,

85
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,880
people were marching are going crazy.

86
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:07,290
They didn't know what that was.

87
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,880
Oh Wow.

88
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,960
I thought it was like a fight.

89
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,640
I freaking communist country man.

90
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,620
And there's like waiting,

91
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,860
people are getting out of order.

92
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,760
This is chaos.

93
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,140
He didn't have the Internet then either.

94
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:16,740
No Way.

95
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,660
They didn't know what to expect of that.

96
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,610
So are people throwing,

97
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:20,821
you know,

98
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:22,140
hitting people from the,

99
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,110
from the helicopter and
down in the front there,

100
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,910
there were guys in uniforms,

101
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,270
you know,

102
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,310
there was Lina police military,

103
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,060
same thing,

104
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,690
you know,

105
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,230
so they're standing there
in their uniforms and after
like three or four songs,

106
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:34,920
they're like,

107
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,880
fuck this.

108
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:39,090
And they took off their stuff and
then there are the head bang and,

109
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,080
and having a good time.

110
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,220
So we saw the transformation of,

111
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,340
you know,

112
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:45,730
uh,

113
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:50,730
closed down society to freedom right
before us individually in PR in people.

114
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,363
It was awesome.

115
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,383
Wow.

116
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,660
What does it feel like to stand
in front of 500,000 people?

117
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,170
What is the sound like?

118
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,780
What does the sound of their roars like?

119
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,250
Pretty massive.

120
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,650
Um,

121
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:07,483
obviously,

122
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,733
you know,

123
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:11,740
I lost count at Latin 300
and something thousand,

124
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,850
but I tell Ya,

125
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,590
and they don't speak your language.

126
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,160
That's just such a,

127
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,910
that's the power of music,

128
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,151
man.

129
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,470
That's a language in its own.

130
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,610
It's connects people.

131
00:03:21,611 --> 00:03:22,690
It is so cool.

132
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,410
So,

133
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:23,651
yeah,

134
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:25,720
we went to a place that
no one spoke English,

135
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:27,250
or people were telling us,

136
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,360
you know,

137
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,430
I learned English from your lyrics.

138
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,760
Like,

139
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,630
Oh shit,

140
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,523
man,

141
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,790
I failed English.

142
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:34,624
Just so you know.

143
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,220
I didn't do so well in school,

144
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,140
but wow.

145
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,500
It's pretty bizarre.

146
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:38,920
Yeah.

147
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,880
That's intense.

148
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,560
[inaudible].
