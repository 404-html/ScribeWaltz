1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,550
Three, two, one, boom. And we're
live. How are you? Come on. I'm good.

2
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:09,120
I'm pouring coffee in the first seconds.
Perfect chat.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:11,750
That's the good way to
do it with a cafeteria.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:16,080
I think it is that you guys named
in a French way. A French Press.

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:17,730
That's what they're called. Is
it called? Well it's called,

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,040
I think it's called cafeteria,
but it's probably called a protocol fee,

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,300
but that makes sense.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,780
But in that there's a French word for it
that we just ignore him. They did a vet,

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,190
a lot of the food, you know,
cause you have um, herbs,

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,500
herbs and I used to do this bit of
material, which I really enjoyed saying,

11
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,940
you know, the difference
between British and American.

12
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,941
You say that she said and you say herbs
and we say herbs because there's a

13
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:46,020
fucking h in it. Right. And I
used to like was the fucking age,

14
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,350
but I thought,
well why as the h dropped off for America?

15
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,440
I think it's because put a lot of French
guys would come over immigration and

16
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:54,820
they would have done a lot of cooking.
You don't see his face.

17
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:58,440
You guys know about cooking and they
do the herbs and they cut the h off.

18
00:00:58,441 --> 00:01:01,980
Totally. So I think it was an influence
from that. Probably Julia Child,

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,730
Julia Child. She French I
think, wasn't she? She is now.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,150
I mean she's in the French
cooking. Oh right, okay. But
that was her thing. Right.

21
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,060
Yet maybe that if I sit
next to Washington and said,

22
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:14,930
we will use our herbs with the stuff here
and that we could do the revolutionary

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,940
war and then a,

24
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:19,330
and then you guys are winning and then
then we'll hate each other forever.

25
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,180
You guys also do a lot of weird stuff
where you put like a you in color and you

26
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:29,130
have a why and tires. What do
you put in the open eye? Res?

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,500
Yeah. I think we had, we had
first dibs on the lack of, yeah,

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,060
I don't understand what we did
know what you got on the uh,

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,790
your guys got on the Mayflower and they
said, okay, we're going to talk like this.

30
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,950
Or they say,
whew,

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,740
a lot and we're going to get
put Cara the why in tires.

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,330
We're going to invent tires.
Get rid of the one. Yeah,

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,280
I just think the U and color and the honor
is a year and honor as well and we've

34
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,290
got it and you've got it out and I think
yours is more logical or honor or not

35
00:01:57,301 --> 00:02:02,040
for Herb's no herbs is that's more
French influenced. I agree. Yeah.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,670
I always wondered because I grew up in
Boston and I always wondered like those

37
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,070
were the first people to
leave England and Europe.

38
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,310
Like what the fuck happened to their
language because they developed the most

39
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:15,670
disgusting brand of it. Well,
you've got your A's, your bus,

40
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,540
today's which I can't hear a strong Buston
coming out of here. I got rid of it.

41
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,540
All right. I heard myself on television
once when I was like 19 years old.

42
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:25,440
I was like, Holy Shit, what
is that? Well, you guys had,

43
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,740
or we used to have a
mother, father, brother,

44
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:33,960
brothers and it's the eye and
we say mother or the father,

45
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:38,750
sister. We don't have an r at the end of
our mother. By the pharmacist. And you.

46
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,230
Yeah.

47
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:45,230
We say mother instead of mother
and the rest of America has,

48
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,460
it has a much stronger
and Ireland has that.

49
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:50,070
That's a very Irish influenced thing.

50
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,700
And for us the eye and when we'd playing,
when I'm playing American,

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,890
when I was in, you know,
doing roles like that,

52
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:59,890
the are was the hardest thing to get hard,
hard tar. I remember friend saying, Hey,

53
00:02:59,891 --> 00:02:59,980
I

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:03,580
was cooking this thing that came out like
a hard hard tar and I thought that is

55
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:07,060
the one, the practice because that is
just hard, hard tar. We'd call it hard,

56
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:11,130
hard tone, which is just doesn't sound
the same. You spend a lot of time be,

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,910
I've only, the only, the only time I've
ever spent in uh, England is working, uh,

58
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:20,590
like a little bit of downtime doing
stand up and hang out over there.

59
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:23,290
But most of it, it's just been
working. Even working for the UFC or,

60
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,740
and I didn't even really get a chance
to really spend time in England.

61
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:31,120
I'd like to, I'd like to do that just
to Kinda understand you folks. Well,

62
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:35,350
I a different breed when the, I think at
the base having played 45 countries now,

63
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:40,351
I think everyone is actually the
same when you get down below a level,

64
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,640
but you know,
if you're going to reach for you,

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,900
there's gotta be a number of things
which would make it seem different than

66
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:49,260
brand names. It will be different
than the sports does. You know,

67
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,010
everyone's sports does it.
Everyone was politicians.

68
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:54,190
If you have that kind of thing and
underneath it all, it's going to be,

69
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,650
there's going to be more mainstream.
People can be alternative people.

70
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,600
There's going to be,
and the whole spectrum now,

71
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,260
like in the old days it used to be
everything was mainstream then a bit of

72
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:04,330
alternative. Now we, I
think your country, Michael,

73
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,510
we have a whole spectrum
of what's interests people.

74
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:12,100
It's much more open in that way.
Yeah, I certainly agree. We,

75
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,580
yeah, it's, the collection
of people is very similar.

76
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,670
It's just they're operating in a different
environment and different theater.

77
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,270
Right. And uh, you know,

78
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,100
we're tightly smashed together.

79
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:28,570
Would it be 65 million in your 300
million and you're such a large,

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,150
your country is so large compared to us.
Um, because there was this thing of Ted,

81
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,340
any temps out of Americans have possibles.
But if you look at it,

82
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,790
something like that. But then if you
look at where the 10% can go in America,

83
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,960
it's just so huge.

84
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,220
So it's slightly more understandable why
a lot of Americans say I don't need a

85
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:47,430
possible cause. I'm just going
to go to that place, which is,

86
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,770
that's an understanding of
you. But I think, you know,

87
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,870
I think it would do everybody good
to go somewhere like, like Asia,

88
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,610
like a, every time I go to Asia I always
think, okay, people are like this too.

89
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,020
Like this is, this is an interesting
thing to experience in particular,

90
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:09,220
which I really loved. Right? Thailand is
a, it's amazing because it's like wow,

91
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:09,820
they might,

92
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,990
they hit like this perfect frequency
where everybody's really friendly and

93
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:17,470
really nice and it's, it's uh, you know,
they call it the land of the smiles.

94
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,240
It's this very unusual environment there
where everybody seems like warm and

95
00:05:22,241 --> 00:05:26,440
greeting. I don't think I'm wrapped
into one rood tie while I was there.

96
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,940
I that sounds very interesting.
And I, I've, I've, yeah,

97
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:35,250
when I toured Asia, but unfortunately
it was kind of out in, you know,

98
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,740
but uh,
that's interesting about the ties,

99
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:42,670
ties more than any other country cause
I shared they must have a black market

100
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:46,180
and a thing and some gangster of
some title. Very nice gangsters.

101
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,820
Maybe the nicest gangsters we know.
Sure.

102
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,130
They're not ask you first
before they shoot you,

103
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,630
I'm sure when it gets to the drug
smuggling and sex trafficking and all the

104
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,190
other day,
but would mind awfully

105
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,850
polite drugs. Douglas. I mean they,

106
00:06:02,851 --> 00:06:06,890
they have obviously a very
open environment. When
you go do you see Bangkok?

107
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:11,891
It's like Molly Thai fights and chaos
and a lot of ex pats wandering around

108
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,510
drinking. You know, they're,
it's a different sort of
world over there. But, uh,

109
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,290
when I was there, I was in Chiang Mai
and it's just super friendly people.

110
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,120
Beautiful landscape. Very nice. Have
you been in Vietnam? No. Never heard.

111
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,950
It's amazing though,

112
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,310
but yeah, I mean I find that
from an American perspective,

113
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:30,840
it'd be very interesting
people going there,

114
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:35,841
even if they were there before and during
the time of war after just to see how

115
00:06:36,571 --> 00:06:39,210
people are because they
fought for so long.

116
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,670
There's all the French stuff before that,
the chain them,

117
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,860
but even before America
got involved in it,

118
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:48,040
they call it a thousand year war that
they fought. Anyway, it's interesting. I,

119
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,370
I hope new generations coming along
don't bring the baggage of before,

120
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:53,941
you know,

121
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:57,440
previous generations and we can all try
and move forward into a world that smart

122
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:00,340
positive even though it doesn't
necessarily look like that.

123
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,720
What has always been really interesting
to me about Vietnam that I learned from

124
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:06,900
Bordain was that they,

125
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,510
they don't hold any grudges towards
Americans, which I find incredible. Aye,

126
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,550
I got that sense of it. I have not
played there, haven't been there,

127
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:17,550
but I got that sense that
they were looking forward.

128
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,730
They just accept it as the past and they
don't have any grudges and it's like,

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,200
it's an amazing attitude.

130
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,750
It is an amazing attitude.
I suppose it's better if you,

131
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,720
they did an empirical,
it's empirical window and they kind of,

132
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,240
they didn't like do a massive
Conga in the end. America left.

133
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,670
And so they got what they were,

134
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,550
I assume the majority of them
were trying to get, you know,

135
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:43,210
just so they can run it however
they want to run it. But um,

136
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,190
yeah, it's, it's tragic the
things the words are getting to.

137
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,050
I was going to be in the military
when I was a kid. That was one of my,

138
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:54,790
I wanted to be in special forces and then
you look at me now being a transgender

139
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,800
guy with that. But yeah,
that was where it was.

140
00:07:56,801 --> 00:08:01,060
I know Trump wouldn't have let me in
the forces right now if I were applied

141
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:05,540
right this second. Um, but
yeah, so I follow everything. I,

142
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,700
I kind of run my life on the
military and that sounds a bit weird.

143
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,050
I run my career in the military thinks
it's quite difficult to, you know,

144
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:16,570
any career, putting it together.
Kind of weird. What's your next move?

145
00:08:16,571 --> 00:08:20,620
What's you'll, you'll strategizes and
that yell? Yeah, strategy out the Wazoo.

146
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,930
I planned 50 years ahead. Really? Oh yeah.
Well if you think about it, you come out,

147
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,770
I came out as transgender 34 years ago.

148
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,090
That's not the first good thing that an
agent wants to hear. Your transgender,

149
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,680
that's 85 this is such a thing. This
is even now, they would say, okay,

150
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,460
well it's got a little better than
it was for five, 10 millennia.

151
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,660
This a little better now. But it's still
not the hardest ticket that everyone's,

152
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,910
we want transgender guys in here for this,
that the other,

153
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,090
it's not the top of the list.

154
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,310
And I've also got boy mode and girl mode
and I do drama dramatic films in boy

155
00:08:51,311 --> 00:08:51,550
mode.

156
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,380
And then I'm touring and girl mode and
doing standup and I campaign for politics

157
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:57,940
in go mode. And I just, how do we do that?

158
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,790
I just switch change, you know,
take off heels, flat shoes.

159
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah,
because if you were just talking,

160
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,020
like if you didn't have makeup on and
he didn't have the heels and the nails,

161
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,740
you just seem male. Yeah.
Yeah. Well, it's a, it's,

162
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,080
I think it's genetically and
built. You know, there's some,

163
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,850
I think there's quite a lot
of people maybe who, uh, um,

164
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,620
uh, the way that light they live their
lives. They live their own personality.

165
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:30,420
They're not particularly male
or female, I feel, but I felt,

166
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,220
I've always felt since I was four or five,

167
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:35,580
I wanted to express this side of myself.
And it's built in, I think it's genetic.

168
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,140
Um, and if you analyze masculine and
feminine, if you really get down to it,

169
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:40,950
you see,
it's,

170
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,190
I find it impossible to come up with
anything that was particularly mascot in

171
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,024
particularly feminine,

172
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,360
except for the ability to build muscle
mass is easier for men in event comas.

173
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,420
That's it. But, you know, great
football as soccer players,

174
00:09:54,421 --> 00:09:57,270
men and women in athletics, runners,
men, women, strong character,

175
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:02,110
men's weak character. Sure. Men
and women, um, mathematicians,

176
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,640
whatever, whatever it is, there's
nothing that you can really say, ah,

177
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,450
that is only good shot with a gun.
Now anyone could do that. It's a,

178
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,890
we're all humans and so, and we get
fixated by the masculine feminine,

179
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:17,130
where's it's a tiger. If there's tigers
tacking here and trying to kill you,

180
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:20,220
you don't care. Now is this a girl till
I grow a Bortech, we don't care about it.

181
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,020
And they don't care either the Tigers.

182
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,060
So you've always felt like you gravitated
towards feminine things toward no,

183
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:30,480
gravitate towards both. I had, I
gravitated towards playing soccer.

184
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,880
I was in the first team for
two years when I was a kid,

185
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,050
was planning to do officer training corps
and then go marines or Paris and then

186
00:10:37,051 --> 00:10:41,250
guns and special forces RSAs which would
be the equivalent of your Delta Force.

187
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,380
Um, and that was a distinct plan and
you're a lot about that. And I thought,

188
00:10:46,381 --> 00:10:48,420
which war they're going to send me
to actually which one? I said me too.

189
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,120
And it could be the idiots that I'm at
school with or send me to the wrong war.

190
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:56,510
Well, what is very clear? And then after
that, every other wards kind of hazy. Uh,

191
00:10:56,530 --> 00:11:01,460
but there's all this feminine side
girls' side. I'm not sure how to do it.

192
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,580
They articulate even after 34 years,
it's difficult to articulate,

193
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:10,380
but I wanted to express that. Um, and if
I look more like a woman than I, you know,

194
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:14,190
it, it would be much
easier. But, um, yeah.

195
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:17,920
So I decided to do that in 95 when
it wasn't cool. And I go, man,

196
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:20,790
I've had a lot of fights in the street.
A lot of people screaming abuse at me.

197
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,990
I'm taking a couple of people to
court or just report it and police.

198
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:28,830
And then we went to court
and uh, yeah, and you fight,

199
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:32,480
you fight your fights and instead of going
to do a military fighting thing, I've,

200
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,420
I've done,

201
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,420
I said this might be wrong for me to say
this by say I've done special forces,

202
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:40,920
civilian division,
you know,

203
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,490
finding people that people speak and
outperforming performing four languages.

204
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:48,720
I've run over 80 marathons. I'm going
into politics next year. And uh,

205
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,220
and yeah, and a k and the
transgender thing is, it's
in a better place than it was

206
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,320
back in [inaudible] 85.
Well,

207
00:11:56,321 --> 00:12:01,321
it certainly now I think because of
probably Caitlyn Jenner and the movement

208
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:02,731
that you're,

209
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:06,490
you're seeing to accept people that want
to do whatever and anything you want to

210
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:10,840
do it is just more, more accepting of
each other that we do seem to be more,

211
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
um,
what's the word

212
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,390
begins with a t the more open, more
allowing, there's a word for it,

213
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:22,330
which is just walked out of my
head, but I mean that word. Um,

214
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,750
but uh,
yeah,

215
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:29,140
and at the same time people are going
around doing more killings and stuff at

216
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:31,240
the same and I,
well there's more people.

217
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:37,230
There's just sheer volume of humor
and the population growth is insane.

218
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,950
It's took us something like 200,000
years to get to 1 million and then it's

219
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:45,970
taking this, I don't know, six 50 years
to get to seven and a half billion,

220
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,220
which is scary. Yeah. When I was a kid,

221
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,580
I think the United States population
was less than 200 million.

222
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,080
Now it's 300 million and
global was whatever it was.

223
00:12:56,081 --> 00:13:01,060
Now it's seven plus. But border,
yeah, eight. Yeah. So when I came out,

224
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:04,210
I think it was 6.5 and I think
that's just running away.

225
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:07,210
And one of the weird things
is if we are having less wars,

226
00:13:07,211 --> 00:13:11,380
if we're getting better health to people,
then more kids are around.

227
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:12,320
And some people in,

228
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,850
in I suppose lower income backgrounds
and around the world they will say,

229
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:18,850
well we need to have six kids. Cause
that's what, hmm. You know, for my,

230
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:23,320
for what I have much money. Yeah. That's
what we do. But as economics get better,

231
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:26,080
people have less case and that
hopefully that should calm down.

232
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,820
There should be a buttering me.

233
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,430
I think they feel that it would be
a leveling off of the population.

234
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,910
I've read the theory that they believe
that industrialized nations and

235
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,730
Westernized Society, when people
start having two careers, you know,

236
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:43,600
and then two career households, people
are less likely to have a bunch of kids.

237
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,370
Yeah. So as people do better,
they have less kids. Yeah. Yeah.

238
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:52,690
So I'm, I'm uh, I, I'm a glass
is two thirds full person.

239
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,870
That's what I feel instead of a glass
is half full, half empty person.

240
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:59,350
That's so you're optimistic.
I'm a big, I need to do,

241
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,650
I couldn't be here in the hills with the
narrative that I'm planning to do this

242
00:14:03,651 --> 00:14:07,390
and got a film coming out and then I'm
touring the country and then I'm going to

243
00:14:07,391 --> 00:14:08,320
politics as well.

244
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,620
When you first started wearing women's
clothes and dresses and makeup on stage

245
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,960
that people think it was a gimmick, what,
what did they think they did? I did.

246
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,000
I decided not to call
them women's clothes just,

247
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,860
and I just say that I might close,
I would just wear dresses, you know,

248
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,710
like women can wear trousers or pants
and we used to call that men's pants and

249
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,830
that, that patents it. So, um, but yeah,

250
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,270
F I first started talking about it
and not wearing anything. Uh, again,

251
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,920
look kind of boy light and may or like,

252
00:14:36,921 --> 00:14:39,430
and then you were talking about
it like I had the first check.

253
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:43,090
This is my first ever jerk.
I had this about two years
before I did. I said, look,

254
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:47,350
you're doing stand up. Um,
so if you're from a minority,
it's kind of a good thing.

255
00:14:47,351 --> 00:14:52,330
So if you in standup terms,
so if you're from a a low ink

256
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:56,180
come background, you'd say rich people,
so easy for them as you are a woman.

257
00:14:56,181 --> 00:15:00,000
He's a man. Ah Man. If you're
an ethnic background and
say white people, oh that's,

258
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,950
so if you're a white male, middle
class standard, it's useless.

259
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,380
So thank God I'm a transvestite.

260
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,000
That was my first love and everyone
thought he's making jokes about something

261
00:15:11,001 --> 00:15:14,060
that he's not and they wouldn't
believe me and journalists were going,

262
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,480
I don't know why he's doing this
because he's doing pretty well now,

263
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:21,320
but there's this idea, is this a joke?
So I thought I better wear addresses,

264
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,260
you know, put some makeup on. And
then they said, okay, he's doing this.

265
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:26,150
He is serious,
but he looks a mess.

266
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,400
It's kind of baby elephant
thing I was doing, okay,

267
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,580
got to get your weight under control.

268
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:34,520
You could have better haircut and
that and you just got to fail a lot.

269
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,840
And there's a humiliation period.

270
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:39,620
I mean this is the weird thing about
coming out that it's kind of humiliating.

271
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:43,370
People say you look at people say
horrible thing. What they say. Uh,

272
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,540
what the fuck is that?

273
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:47,840
Somebody said to my face right there
as I was walking out of a restaurant,

274
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,980
so I thought that's not very nice. And
you have to be able to deflect it and go,

275
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:56,060
well, you're obviously a scumbag,
so fuck you man. So I'm mostly men.

276
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,030
Yes. And occasionally women.
Okay. Occasionally women.
But yeah, I mean, you know,

277
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,510
it's low. If people have low, lower
character, there are lesser character.

278
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:08,060
She's a strong character. And yourself,
you don't care. I live in that live.

279
00:16:08,061 --> 00:16:10,760
What the hell? You know, people, okay.
It doesn't look quite a bit together,

280
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,810
but you know, life's tough enough.
But if you want to put someone down,

281
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:17,600
you raise your own status by
doing and they will do that.

282
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,100
And so I have stood in the street
and people have unloaded, you know,

283
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,980
swear words ineffective to me and I've
just, I will fuck you in a violent,

284
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:27,860
violent, I think what?
You'll fuck, fuck you. And,

285
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,930
and it's literally two or three of them
or one of me just screaming at each

286
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:35,600
other and I just won't back down.
Now, this happened recently,

287
00:16:35,601 --> 00:16:36,860
it was nine months ago.

288
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,580
Someone outside of my house in
London just having a go at me.

289
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,490
So he knew who you were as well.
They did.

290
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:45,950
They knew exactly what and where I live.
We said, we're going to do your house.

291
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:51,290
What the hell is this awesome now where
it's because of the way you dress.

292
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,300
Well it was, he added that into it. There
was a, there was an altercation over.

293
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,780
I was just packing my car cause I was
just driving home between my dad and

294
00:16:59,781 --> 00:17:02,540
somebody says, you've got to give
me a ride in your car. I said,

295
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:06,320
this is just someone heckles me like that
in the street. I just come back with,

296
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:10,370
you will never have a ride in my car.
I have to give you one. I'll give you.

297
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,440
So that happened.
And then this guy went off and yeah,

298
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,580
this and that and the other one,
it's just screaming at me and so on,

299
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:21,080
shouting back at him, giving him
word for word and then went, I said,

300
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:25,790
who is that idiot? And they
said, oh that's this guy.
He's a known, he's a nutter,

301
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,280
you know, he's just, he does
this. I went, all right,

302
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
maybe I should mention it because
he said he's going to do my, ah,

303
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,090
I'll mention it to the police. Our
demand two weeks, that same thing.

304
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,190
Who's sharing?
I mean it's the same ticket.

305
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,300
So I stopped right next time I go past
knows where you live. Well, he always did.

306
00:17:41,301 --> 00:17:44,270
He was right in front of the house.
That's always fun, isn't it? Yeah. Well,

307
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,790
and he said, we're going to do your
house when you're away. You know?

308
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,650
So this was the,
that was his opening gambit.

309
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,160
We're going to your
house when you're away.

310
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,330
Yeah. They're letting you know there
are a coward. Yeah. Well it was,

311
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,510
it was a very positive,
he didn't run a PR company.

312
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,700
I think that's kind of terrorism,
right?

313
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:02,810
They're trying to strike terror in you
when you were away. Well, yeah, that,

314
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:06,040
well that is, yes. That
is the hatred thing is,

315
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,340
did you think about just going
out there and fucking them up?

316
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,960
I don't think I'm quite,

317
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:13,450
that I would've liked if I'd gone
through the military thing of a Gulf,

318
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:17,700
that I would learn how to do that, you
know? And I've never have craft my God,

319
00:18:17,701 --> 00:18:21,090
my shelf up to the thing.
I do need to crab my own self up,

320
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
but I haven't got there. So, um,

321
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:28,050
well I saw w we were talking before and
you were trying to tell me that you were

322
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:31,050
lazy. I'm like, fuck you. I
saw that thing that you did,

323
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:35,520
that documentary where you ran a series
of marathons in a row with no training

324
00:18:35,521 --> 00:18:36,150
at all.

325
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,560
And I remember thinking before that had
this opinion of you and the opinion of

326
00:18:40,561 --> 00:18:45,020
you was, you're a funny guy.
You're a funny comedian. Um, you,

327
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,940
you have good stand up.
You obviously work hard at it.

328
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:53,670
But then I saw that and I was like,
oh, okay, there's something going on.

329
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:55,740
They're like, yeah, those are the
different kinds of human being,

330
00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,150
the kind of human being that could push
themselves into doing that day after day

331
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:00,151
after day.

332
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:03,210
And I looked at your feet where your
skin was literally falling off and you're

333
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:07,410
taping everything up. And, um, that's a,

334
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,560
that's a person that's got,
you have an iron will,

335
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,690
like that's a very unusual will for a
comedian who doesn't really exercise.

336
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,820
Like when you were doing,
I mean, you were, I mean,

337
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:19,140
you may be exercise a little bit,

338
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:23,050
but you weren't in shape
now and you decided to run
how many marathons in a way,

339
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,920
which at the UK one was it the first one?
Yeah,

340
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:28,140
that was 43 and 51 days.

341
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,150
43 marathons in a row in 51
days with no training at a,

342
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,050
definitely. I did have training that six
weeks training. Yeah. Which is not a lot,

343
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:39,060
but they did, they said that, you know,

344
00:19:39,061 --> 00:19:41,730
sometimes if you weren't a math and you
should train for nine months before that.

345
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,850
And I thought, well, if I'm going
to do 43, that's going to be,

346
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:49,320
I haven't been training forever. I can't
be bothered with that. So I, but you know,

347
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,720
and this happened in your civil
war in maybe an any wool, uh, I,

348
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,830
I don't kind of somewhat
encyclopedic about you.

349
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,580
Civil war and revolution
motivated World War Two,

350
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:03,390
but on the spot training,
you know, training as you
go along. That's what I did.

351
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:07,020
The first 10 math.
It's trains you for the next 33.

352
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:09,960
What was it like when you go over the
first day though? The first marathon?

353
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,760
Christos. Okay. Fuck. My first day is okay
because, well it's, it's all in your head.

354
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:18,630
There's a, um, more mental
than it is physical.

355
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,450
And so the first mountain I've heard of
people who are running marathons, run,

356
00:20:21,451 --> 00:20:24,120
walk, staggered, not very
fast. Get it done. Boom.

357
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,130
The second math in his weird cause you
go, I've done one, I'm on the second.

358
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,470
And you can't really rejoice.
You can punch the sky.

359
00:20:31,471 --> 00:20:33,750
You can't put a metal right near there.
You're already,

360
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,410
you've got up at five or six in the
morning and it's mid day and you're,

361
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,840
you're going through your second one and
then he gets to the third one and then

362
00:20:39,841 --> 00:20:40,710
you'll do the fourth one.

363
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:45,660
And then it was raining and my feet was
shredding and I, the moisture it was,

364
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,310
yes,
it made it too soft and they were rubbing

365
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,570
on the, on the running shoes.
And I didn't know how to,

366
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,930
how do I fix it when I'm actually
wearing on it all the time.

367
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,590
So we started bathing it in surgical
spirit, which you call something else. Um,

368
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,970
it's, it's a, it's a
ethanol, methanol. Anyways,

369
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,950
it's some sort of alcoholic spirit and it,
uh,

370
00:21:05,951 --> 00:21:09,540
it takes the moisture out of your feet.
And um,

371
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:15,490
so it became like stones. It's
Kinda like which, uh, um, uh,

372
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,100
anyway,
if anyone does have some surgical spear,

373
00:21:17,101 --> 00:21:19,360
if you Google it now you'll see
what it's called in America,

374
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:22,660
but it's some sort of alcoholic
thing that just removes moisture.

375
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,160
And so it made my feet, my toes,
like little stones and kind of tough.

376
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:30,910
And actually that got us through.
And then I started and also apparently,

377
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,350
cause I did 27 mountains in 27 days
in South Africa in 2016. And that was,

378
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,730
the temperatures were crazy on that,

379
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,030
but it seems that the body will switch
on a healing property that we've got

380
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:44,320
Leighton in ourselves that we don't
use and you will heal quicker,

381
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,560
you will heal faster the more you get.

382
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,590
So I got you get stronger and both the
British one and the South African one,

383
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:54,400
I got stronger as I went on the
first 10 days of the other key thing.

384
00:21:54,401 --> 00:21:56,950
And after that it's kind of easier.
You're used to it.

385
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,980
Your body just adapts and understands
this crazy ass hole is going to do the

386
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,440
crazy also.
And the brain goes,

387
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,030
what kind of math and shall we run today
as opposed to what the are you doing?

388
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,670
What kind of marathon? Yeah, well I
think that's what the brain's doing.

389
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:12,640
Cause the first day is going, you
got to do what? This marathon,

390
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,680
but I'd be okay the second day,

391
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:19,360
the way it's going now we're going to s
during another one, third day, fourth day,

392
00:22:19,361 --> 00:22:22,810
fifth day. This is insane. And then
the data and the brain is going, okay,

393
00:22:22,811 --> 00:22:26,680
you're on this kind of cake or
something. I understand. Let's,

394
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:28,930
let's try a better man.
Don't push it too hard.

395
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:33,730
You know the brain starts talking to
the body and somehow it levels out round

396
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:35,980
about Maine.
Then they get surreal marathon,

397
00:22:35,981 --> 00:22:40,020
18 wrath and 23 I remember marathon
31 that was the level of media.

398
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,590
So weird, but it was fun.
And you own the road,

399
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:49,420
you know a woody Guthrie. This
land is Ireland's Milan, the you,

400
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,250
you become like,
it's your land.

401
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:55,570
It's like it's everybody's land because
you're running on the roads of this

402
00:22:55,571 --> 00:23:00,340
country. I grew up in. And you feel
that the roads, the fields, the birds,

403
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,940
I didn't listen to any music I wanted.
It's like a safety thing for traffic,

404
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:07,180
but also you could hit everything
that's going on. Birds,

405
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,590
Chad rivers running there was,
I ran possibly his house.

406
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,060
This isn't that bad day too.

407
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,300
And there was a river running there and
it went through the back of this guy's

408
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:17,830
garden and he said hello.
And I said,

409
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,500
can I went and visited him and I washed
my feet in the river and then I put the

410
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:25,930
socks back on and I carried on running.
I thought I can, you can do with these.

411
00:23:25,931 --> 00:23:28,420
I took blackberries out of the
bushes like I did when I was a kid.

412
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,550
It just became effective feral,
this holistic or feral marathons.

413
00:23:33,551 --> 00:23:36,370
That's what I was doing. It's not run,
it's not people shouting from the sides.

414
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,680
No one cares really, which is fine. And
I'm just wrapped up in this other place

415
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,630
and it was beautiful.
I mean it's Zan.

416
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:50,690
Well it seems like it would change you
like accomplishing something like that.

417
00:23:50,691 --> 00:23:54,710
Like on the last day,
the last run when you crossed the line,

418
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,010
what was that feeling like? Why this
is a pitch. He brought up that picture.

419
00:23:58,011 --> 00:24:01,430
This is me getting the, they put up some
flags and stuff. That was beautiful.

420
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:05,190
I tried to do a five hour marathon.
Now if you know the speeds,

421
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,760
it's two hours is what they're trying
to break that. So this is really slow.

422
00:24:07,761 --> 00:24:12,350
But then having done 42 marathons,
it's maybe it's fair and uh, I,

423
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,110
I missed it by about 30 seconds,
but it was,

424
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,070
it was beautiful to finish it. I was
really quite strong all the way through.

425
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:24,050
I didn't stop at any time. That was,
that was good. In South Africa though,

426
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,930
I did 27 and 27 days.

427
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,540
It started a salute to Nelson Mandela
was 27 years in prison and day five,

428
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:32,270
they put me in the hospital because
they thought my kidneys were giving up.

429
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,380
And you experiencing Rhabdo is that
what it is? You know, but yeah, yeah,

430
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,600
yeah. Your first book ever talked to WHO's
done it about revved my license. Yeah.

431
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:44,510
I got Rhabdo in 2012.
Um,

432
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,760
and you get that I was on a uh,
anti-cholesterol drug,

433
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,990
just the sort of health drug,

434
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:55,220
your cholesterol is a bit high tech
this thing once a day and side effect is

435
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,183
rhabdomyolysis,

436
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,390
which I couldn't spell being dyslexic
and I was paying Brown p and,

437
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:06,770
and uh, did it. There no real pain,
lot of lethargy. I was really tired.

438
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,240
And this is without exercise
you were getting in, uh,

439
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,340
that was on marathon three American force.

440
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,510
So I had trained and
I trained before that.

441
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,280
I'd done some training before that one.
I'm a bit weird with my training,

442
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,980
but yeah, so there wasn't a huge
amount of training before that one,

443
00:25:21,981 --> 00:25:25,810
but a third marathon and I
started paying a bit of Brown.

444
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,610
But this was not through the whole
series of marathons or it was, no, well,

445
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,820
I tried to do South Africa twice,

446
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,880
so 2012 was my first one after day
four on an anti cholesterol drug,

447
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,590
uh, tried to control my cholesterol and
I started borrowing Brian p and then they

448
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:42,800
said,

449
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,000
you've got to go to a hospital now the
guys that we've got to put fluids through

450
00:25:46,001 --> 00:25:47,630
you,
you have to go see a specialist.

451
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:52,160
Especially said you can't continue this
27 thing because you have to get all

452
00:25:52,161 --> 00:25:55,400
this stuff out of your system. Otherwise
the kid needs, because the it shreds the,

453
00:25:55,401 --> 00:25:58,400
you know, the shirts, the muscles into
the bloodstream, clogs up kidneys,

454
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,070
kidney failure. Very dangerous. A
lot of fighters get it. Really. Yeah.

455
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,430
I'm a fighter. Died from it. Um,
recently in Boston, Massachusets area.

456
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,060
Yeah,
it's a,

457
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,910
it's apparently something that happens
when fighters overtrain as well.

458
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,700
Like sometimes they're not
doing it scientifically,

459
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:20,450
so they're not analyzing their heart
rate or heart rate variability and they

460
00:26:20,451 --> 00:26:23,780
don't know that they haven't really
truly recovered and they continue to push

461
00:26:23,781 --> 00:26:27,200
themselves because they
want to prepare harder. Yes,

462
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,940
they have this sort of mental
mindset just train harder and you'll,

463
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,150
you'll be better off.

464
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,810
But that's not necessarily the case of
your body can't physically keep up with

465
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:40,040
the recovery and sometimes they'll go
into a fight overtrained and then they

466
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:43,100
wind up getting robbed dough from
the fight. It's happened several

467
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:47,190
and it's caused a few
deaths. Well, they said this,

468
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:52,191
you said you Karen Ryan running now in
2012 or you won't make it to 2016 did you

469
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:55,260
get off that medication? Yeah, I
would think that all that running,

470
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:58,290
you wouldn't need that medication,
I would have thought. But you know,

471
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,600
they check you out and you say your
class was just at those mother fuckers.

472
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,150
You be on this for the rest of your life.

473
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,890
That stuff's gives a shit out of
me and they'll statens. Yeah, it's,

474
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,280
it goes through a scary place.

475
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,600
But 2016 day five bloods were
looking a bit weird day off.

476
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:16,920
So Day 27 I did double marathon and
that was kind of an interesting day.

477
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:20,400
So you run one marathon
last day of your run,

478
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,430
you've only done 25 minutes in
and said it's the day 27 or so.

479
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,840
And when you go through that finishing
the final flag where the WWII,

480
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,250
they should be waving flags, you've got
another marathon to go. And it's just I,

481
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:34,700
my brain like, oh this is
kinda good, but you got to,

482
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,460
it's 90 k you're going to do
today, ignore it, carry on.

483
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,990
And it was a rough, rough all day. That's
five hours. And then another five hours,

484
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:46,560
five hours plus a mother, five
hours plus. And it was six.

485
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,050
I took 11 hours and 50 minutes to run
90 K so I didn't double marathon in 11

486
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,740
hours. Tim. That's damn good. Yeah, it was
good enough. And there's, they've got a,

487
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,390
they've got a comrades
marathon in South Africa,

488
00:27:57,391 --> 00:28:00,360
which is 90 [inaudible] and
they've got a 12 hour cutoff.

489
00:28:00,361 --> 00:28:02,490
So I said I will do 90 K in 12 hours.

490
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:07,850
The double math was 84 and then I did
another six k after I'd finished that last

491
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:13,050
moment. Must have been orgasmic when you
finished. It must have been incredible.

492
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,170
Finishing the 84 was beautiful year
finish at the steps of Nelson Mandela

493
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:17,041
stature.
Right.

494
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:22,041
He was made president and
that was bit of an and rough,

495
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:25,380
I'd have to speed up in the last
hour because of complications.

496
00:28:25,381 --> 00:28:26,550
So I actually got faster.

497
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:29,820
If either of you have done a thing where
you're knackered and Mac and said now

498
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,390
go, why'd you have to
speed up? There was a wind,

499
00:28:33,391 --> 00:28:35,820
it was a single sport
relief as doing it for,

500
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:40,020
so it was raising money and I wanted to
finish inside the camera window there to

501
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:44,700
window til three 15 South African time.
Police escorts were needed,

502
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:49,350
certain bits, otherwise you'll get jacked
thing and you won't survive this big.

503
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:52,680
So I said, can't we just ignore the car
jacking thing now you can't ignore it.

504
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,820
So I said, okay, stop the clock, put
me in the thing, drive me to Pretoria.

505
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:59,580
Stopped me off. But then I'll run there
and we'll just continue it on there.

506
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,361
So we had to do that.

507
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:03,810
So we got behind because I wasn't running
cause that'd be driven across this

508
00:29:03,811 --> 00:29:07,580
dangerous period of port point of
road to be dropped to Pretoria.

509
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,120
Then I just had to run the kilometers off.
So they have like a car jack area.

510
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,640
Yeah. They have said there is,
whether it's, it's kind of out there.

511
00:29:14,641 --> 00:29:18,630
There's no one really out there and
you just go along there and they'll,

512
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,260
you know, anything can happen. So, um, my,

513
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,170
my field producer fixer, he was
just saying, we don't do this, just,

514
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,770
you can't go there.
So I said,

515
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:31,550
well just get me closer to the finishing
line and then I'll just run them.

516
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,550
It doesn't really matter where
I'm running. Now we know,

517
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,630
Pretoria know we need to finish,
I need to just run that distance.

518
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,720
So I ran the distance soft,
but the time had got behind.

519
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,720
So I had to speed up from 7.5 kilometers
an hour to 10 kilometers in there.

520
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,430
So an extra third, the speed
at which was kind of evil. No,

521
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,440
I moaned a lot that day. I just,
I was just a moaning, whining.

522
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,790
Oh God, I got do this. I what I, I
was never considering not doing it.

523
00:29:57,791 --> 00:30:02,430
And I got the, um, the,
the, the live feed to,

524
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,260
to London finished at quarter past and
we got there about 13 minutes pass.

525
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:09,080
We had about two minutes and they just
caught it before they went off here.

526
00:30:09,081 --> 00:30:12,280
It was like, you know, like a Phil,
you know, it was perfectly designed.

527
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:15,340
I just knew if I got that probably I
get more money or raise more money and

528
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,860
extra hundred grand because we've,
we've seen this idiot finish.

529
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,860
He's actually doing it either. Um, so that
was beautiful. And then I talked to the,

530
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,460
this very interesting thing because
you know, if you're talking to PR,

531
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,080
it was a press.
I talked to the press after that.

532
00:30:26,081 --> 00:30:28,570
It was a Sunday and so they kept talking.

533
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:30,840
Normally they say we can't talk anymore.
We've got two minutes.

534
00:30:30,841 --> 00:30:33,010
And then we got to talk to
important people go away.

535
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,950
That's what normally happens if you're
talking to life press and national press.

536
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,100
But I was on the thing and they just kept
talking to me because obviously a slow

537
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:41,020
news day and nothing was happening.
And they say,

538
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,080
we've got this idiot who's
just run 27 marathons.

539
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,600
And they kept asking me how the question
and what favorite color do you have?

540
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,920
What, what, how, how big are
your legs, your legs? Yeah.

541
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,170
I don't know what they were asking me,
but in the end,

542
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:57,040
these two interviews I did with national,
I just said, I'm going to go away now.

543
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,290
I got to stop this.
I had to stop my own interview,

544
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
which I've never done in my life and I
realize they've just got no one else to

545
00:31:02,321 --> 00:31:04,240
talk to.
Desperate.

546
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:09,940
Did you notice a big change in public
perception of you once you completed those

547
00:31:09,941 --> 00:31:12,760
marathons? Yeah, the um, yeah,

548
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:16,000
the certain community and
if you're transgender guy
and you come out of certain

549
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,880
people go, but I, I crossed
into a line of, well,

550
00:31:18,881 --> 00:31:22,360
if you're going to do that and you,
I hate, I know you do some comedy,

551
00:31:22,361 --> 00:31:26,350
you do the drama stuff. We think
you're a bit bonkers and out there,

552
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,510
but fair play.
I've got this sort of,

553
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:32,530
I got to pass a fair play to
you if you're going to do that.

554
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:36,070
And I was trying to do selection,
you know SAS, they have selection,

555
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,230
your Delta forces,
Navy Seals,

556
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,880
they all have this thing that can
you just go on and on and on and on.

557
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,880
It's the stamina thing and that was my
civilian selection for my own whatever

558
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,520
civil identification forces. Just
to understand yourself. Yeah,

559
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:55,510
I know I can go a lot for, I mean coming
out as transgender when you're straight,

560
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:58,210
I'm straight transgender, so I fancy
women's. I'm, I want to be lesbian.

561
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:03,400
So if you come out, you could stay in
the closet and I look down the millennia.

562
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:07,120
If we go back to the ancient
Egyptians and further,

563
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:09,610
there's probably a lot of guys said, I'm
going to tell anyone about this. I just,

564
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:10,990
I fancy women.
I just go with it.

565
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:15,820
I just won't mention this kind of
feelings in my head and I thought I should

566
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:20,380
mention it because if people sat and
scream at me in the streets, I will,

567
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,350
I will fight that at least
verbally fight that. Or you know,

568
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,200
if they start going for it.

569
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,410
I have had one fight in the
streets and I landed one punch.

570
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:33,830
I taught myself to write on the
streets because of this. Yeah, yeah.

571
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:36,940
The guy was was just giving me,
Ooh Tracey,

572
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:39,980
oh well dressed down and I was,

573
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:42,200
I've been a street performer
for four years at Covent garden.

574
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:43,560
So living on the street,
you know,

575
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,030
living that has working on
the streets and you know,

576
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,050
just knew a lot of people going
around and just said, Matt,

577
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,190
you don't have to be like this.

578
00:32:49,191 --> 00:32:53,060
We can all the space enough for everyone
live and let live kept giving me stuff.

579
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:57,370
He was a bit drunk so he was just going
to stay on that wicked keeps saying it.

580
00:32:57,371 --> 00:33:01,910
And I said, just chill out, chill out.
And then the third time I just said, oh,

581
00:33:01,911 --> 00:33:04,220
just fuck off. And I went, no, I am.

582
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,810
I am loaded load of swear words on him.
And then he swung for me,

583
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,070
which was the handy thing cause that came
up in court and then I swung back and

584
00:33:13,071 --> 00:33:14,090
I landed one punch,

585
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:16,430
which I was pleased about and I was
doing the wipe on wipe off stuff.

586
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:19,020
I was doing this blah blocking.
Yeah, for the Jujitsu.

587
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:22,690
But I taught myself Jujitsu from a book
if you could believe that, which is,

588
00:33:22,691 --> 00:33:22,911
you know,

589
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:25,550
you'll get these books with the different
moves in and you can't teach yourself

590
00:33:25,551 --> 00:33:27,710
that. But I did judo when
I was six actually as well.

591
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,570
So I liked the idea of doing these things,

592
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:31,370
but I felt judo was
always at the bigger kid.

593
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,270
You all get in pajamas and the bigger
kit just throws you around a bit.

594
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:38,210
I can never quite get the hanger.
I couldn't throw the bigger kids.

595
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,430
I could do it now, but I've
never, anyway, yeah, this is

596
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,371
fantastic.

597
00:33:42,371 --> 00:33:47,310
Video online of a very old judo expert in,

598
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,550
I think he's in his seventies or his
eighties and he's working out with these

599
00:33:51,551 --> 00:33:56,551
young men and you see his
mastery of judo as these young,

600
00:33:57,251 --> 00:34:01,570
powerful men try to manipulate him and
throw him around and he effortlessly

601
00:34:01,571 --> 00:34:05,470
watch this, this old man
and he see him, he's very,

602
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:10,471
very old and he's throwing these guys
around me as a martial arts expert.

603
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,830
These, these men are not doing
this willingly. This is legitimate.

604
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:18,340
Like even that guy tries to throw him
and this is a black belt who's trying to

605
00:34:18,341 --> 00:34:21,040
throw him,
but he's so good and his,

606
00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,420
his use of balance and leverage is so
amazing. He just knows where to be.

607
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:28,690
Like see how it just throws
himself into a perfect position.

608
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,790
It's really stunning to watch.

609
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:33,790
And this looks like it was from the 50s
or something like that cause it's really

610
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:37,690
old blood yet. Does it say, just
has 75 year old judo master.

611
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,070
I mean this is an old man and the
young man is much larger than him.

612
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:45,870
Significantly like 25% larger than him.

613
00:34:45,871 --> 00:34:48,170
It at least maybe even look up.
He looks at,

614
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:53,170
he's twice as big as him and he cannot
throw this old man. It's really amazing.

615
00:34:53,410 --> 00:34:58,060
Juno was a beautiful art. Oh, he's going
more and more full on is and these guys,

616
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,420
I got to get this. He's trying, I mean
he knows that this guy's a master,

617
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:04,630
but it's just look at
that like it's incredible.

618
00:35:04,631 --> 00:35:09,631
I mean the way that guy's body can toss
these people through the air and yet

619
00:35:09,881 --> 00:35:14,140
they are helpless. They can't do anything
to him way that, look at that. Boom.

620
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,150
Three times,
75 years old.

621
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:20,140
I mean that hurts my hips.
Just looking at that.

622
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,780
Yeah. You, you can have
many different martial arts.

623
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,910
Which ones you Jitsu

624
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,870
and striking martial arts.
My background was in striking,

625
00:35:30,871 --> 00:35:34,680
which is in taekwondo and then eventually
kickboxing and Muay Thai and then I

626
00:35:34,681 --> 00:35:38,220
got really into Jujitsu when I
got older and well and Jujitsu's.

627
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:42,710
What's the difference in just grappling
choking people? It's like you,

628
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:45,930
it's not throws like judo.
There are throws in Jujitsu,

629
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,520
but it really comes from judo. It comes
from the ground fighting aspect of Judah,

630
00:35:50,521 --> 00:35:51,810
which is not as emphasized,

631
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:56,780
but the Brazilians really a really
emphasized it and sort of uh,

632
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:57,900
they,

633
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,900
they figured out what the best way for
a smaller person defeat a larger person

634
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:05,190
is through leverage.

635
00:36:05,191 --> 00:36:10,191
And Jujitsu is really the only martial
art that I can think of that works like

636
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:14,040
you think of a martial art in a
movie like in a Bruce Lee movie.

637
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:17,160
Like there's all these people and they
were always bigger than Bruce Lee.

638
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:21,630
Bruce Lee fucked him all up. When the
real world, that doesn't usually work,

639
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:25,020
like the bigger people have such a
giant advantage when it comes to like

640
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:26,060
striking. Like, you know,

641
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,240
you're never going to see a
like a heavyweight in the UFC.

642
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,100
A fight, a bantamweight fight, a
person who is 135 pounds just wouldn't,

643
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,100
it's just too much of an
advantage and Jujitsu,

644
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:43,130
it's legitimately possible for hundred
and 40 pound man to strangle a 200 plus

645
00:36:43,651 --> 00:36:46,860
pound man and do it relatively
easily if they're talented.

646
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,220
I, I saw a documentary on Bruce Lee
and he had the way of, no way. Yeah.

647
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,240
Which really pill to me,
I mean that it's,

648
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,640
it's like a philosophy quite a month
from fighting philosophy, but um,

649
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,700
to be so trained up in so many things
that they do not know what you're going to

650
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:07,200
do.
And I kind of adopted that.

651
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,710
Well,
he had to overcome significant prejudice,

652
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,950
prejudice to adopt that perspective
because when he was studying martial arts,

653
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:18,710
you were supposed to be loyal to
your style. So if you learn Kung Fu,

654
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:20,880
you were supposed to be a
Kung Fu man for life. Yeah.

655
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,290
You weren't supposed to also dabble
in boxing and wrestling and all these

656
00:37:24,291 --> 00:37:25,880
different things that
he was interested in.

657
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,630
He was interested in taking what's useful
from all different martial arts and

658
00:37:29,631 --> 00:37:33,560
applying them. So in a sense, he was
really the founder of mixed martial arts,

659
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:35,540
which you see today in the UK.

660
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:39,760
They have cage warriors and
the u s has a UFC and you know,

661
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,530
there's this worldwide now the,

662
00:37:41,531 --> 00:37:44,690
the art of mixed martial arts of putting
all the different styles together.

663
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:46,340
And you can do whatever
you want within the rules.

664
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,040
Now I liked the attitude of that.
I still have a life attitude then.

665
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,700
I mean there's obviously

666
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:55,510
fighting attitude event and then as the
life attitude of just be prepared for

667
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,740
anything and everything.

668
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,360
Yeah. And be and be like water.
Like that was his other thing.

669
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:05,310
Just to go round things, move through
things like don't, don't headbutt things.

670
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,970
Figure out what's the best way, what
is the, what's the best, best path?

671
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,820
Well, you know, yeah, I just, um,

672
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:18,640
I haven't
learned what I say.

673
00:38:18,641 --> 00:38:21,520
I think I'm waiting for someone
to give me a really hard time.

674
00:38:21,521 --> 00:38:25,140
Then I say now I am checking in and I am
learning in my shot, cause I really do.

675
00:38:25,141 --> 00:38:30,141
You live in England so many places and
really here and I'm everywhere because

676
00:38:31,391 --> 00:38:35,600
I'm always touring. I was
touring Andy and filming, so I,

677
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,620
I just keep moving, but yeah, I know.
But it's, you've got to make the time,

678
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:42,640
especially if you're moving around all the
time, he'd have to line it up. So, okay.

679
00:38:42,641 --> 00:38:45,140
We're going to check in with this
guy in that place. This, yes. And,

680
00:38:45,141 --> 00:38:46,900
and you'd have to take it and like you do,

681
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,860
it's gotta be something that
you're serious as opposed to death.

682
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,410
I didn't want to dabble like,
um, stand up when I'm filming.

683
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:57,400
I was still do standing at when I'm
filming and if I'm doing standup,

684
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,100
I will think about doing drama,
you know,

685
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:04,930
drama and comedy that color related
but different. So I keep pushing both.

686
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,710
You've got to keep everything match, fit
for life. And that's all that matters.

687
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,750
I can drop marathons now. I just did
three marathons. I just dropped three man.

688
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,740
I took,
got home from playing Australia,

689
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,120
took the train up to Barack upon tweed
on the Scottish border, ran up to Dunbar,

690
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:21,550
which is one marathon and went
across to Edinburg. Second Marathon.

691
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,170
Are you running a marathon
with other people or just
not wanting it for yourself?

692
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,900
Just get a backpack, put my
stuff in there. Change of
clothes, wash kit. Off I go,

693
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,620
no backup.

694
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,790
And is this something that started because
of that series of marathons that you

695
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:33,624
did?
Yeah,

696
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,180
and I want to stay match fit for life
because that's what I noticed that

697
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:40,790
everyone's a natural, like all
animals in natural animals and the,

698
00:39:40,791 --> 00:39:41,800
there are the wild animals,

699
00:39:41,801 --> 00:39:44,080
which we were and then there
are domesticated animals.

700
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,080
We are self domesticated
but we are actually designed
to be while we're supposed

701
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:53,290
to be match fit for life.
And I think as time goes on,

702
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,540
you know people get back into
training or whatever they say,

703
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,130
what would that really hurt?
So I backed off.

704
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,830
I think it hurts because
you're not doing it enough.

705
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,390
I'm not sure if this is a pure science,

706
00:40:01,391 --> 00:40:06,391
this is just a feeling for me maybe that
that I need to stay fit and running and

707
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:10,750
swimming and whatever I'm doing.
And the less I do,

708
00:40:10,751 --> 00:40:14,620
the more the body punishing me if I'm
doing it all the time. If I'm always,

709
00:40:14,621 --> 00:40:15,700
I try and run every morning.

710
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:19,330
I almost did it this morning but I
had to get up and do stuff today.

711
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,530
But if I miss one then that's kind of
good cause that sort of recovery time.

712
00:40:23,531 --> 00:40:28,360
But I would just do hit training, high
intensity interval training every morning,

713
00:40:28,361 --> 00:40:30,940
and then the ability to just
drop three Matthew's job,

714
00:40:30,941 --> 00:40:33,460
seven marathons in seven
days. You love that. Yeah.

715
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:36,330
I love to have that in my back
pocket and I don't think that's,

716
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,490
that's not allowed. That's not even a
list of things you're supposed to have,

717
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:43,330
but I know I can do it now and I can
do it with just a backpack on. Well,

718
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:44,950
you can do it too,
because you have autonomy.

719
00:40:44,951 --> 00:40:48,570
You can kind of do whatever you
want to do, right? Yeah. In the end.

720
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,970
And you're living when you want to go
make the time. Yeah. But there's also the,

721
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:56,260
the actual, that's not supposed to be
in the list of what is what humans do.

722
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:59,740
Right. You don't just go from around
three and three or seven and seven.

723
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,510
And I love that. That's kind of,
that's, that's out there. Well,

724
00:41:04,511 --> 00:41:08,070
there's clearly people that are doing
that. Oh yeah. The speed, everyone,

725
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:10,930
everything. I'd done everyone that
someone's done boy more than I've done.

726
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,140
And I kind of know that.
I feel that even if I don't know that,

727
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,060
I have one crazy friend,
his name's Cameron Hanes and he's a,

728
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,040
he's actually a famous bow hunter,
but he's also an ultra marathon runner.

729
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,320
And when he prepares for these like big
foot 200 so it's like 200 plus miles of

730
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:28,690
the mole app to 4,238 miles in the desert.

731
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,490
He runs a marathon a day.

732
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,980
So we run a marathon every day
and then he a full time job.

733
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:38,720
He's legitimately crazy and you
know, he's, he always does that.

734
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,810
It doesn't take any days
off and he works at to that.

735
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:43,390
So run a math and they say we're running
them up, got ready at it through early,

736
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,710
early run in the morning,
run at lunch. Running at dawn
is beautiful. It's African.

737
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,360
Sure you're matching the
African that I got coming up.

738
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:53,690
We worried about something running up
and grabbing Ya. Well I'm that thing.

739
00:41:53,691 --> 00:41:57,140
I wasn't, I mean they, they told me I
supposed to have security high wasn't,

740
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,110
I was kind of cool. That's for
people we worry about people do.

741
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:04,210
When you were around any, I
was Al animals. I was in a, uh,

742
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:08,810
the mountain Zebra National Park.
And you know,

743
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,360
if you've ever been in
a safari as they say,

744
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,930
so they tell you to sit in this shot
of shower bank, big open top vehicle.

745
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:17,270
It's got metal bars over it
and they say the animals,

746
00:42:17,271 --> 00:42:18,320
they know that the shape of that,

747
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:21,050
they know it's metal and metal doesn't
taste very good. So you'll be fine.

748
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:24,140
And there's a guy with a gun and you
feel good. But when I went there,

749
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,970
of course they said, well, y'all running
outside near the vehicle. And I thought,

750
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:35,270
is this right? This is pretty big,
good television. But said, okay,

751
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,090
I'll just stay close with if something's
coming. And they, they did. I said,

752
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:42,260
what about how the lions during the
lions have eaten yesterday? They're fine.

753
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:45,680
And they told me, you know, and that's
what lives, they never go for snacks.

754
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,650
Lines are kind of organized like that.
We ate yesterday,

755
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:51,690
we ripped apart some animal and we don't
need to go and have a bag of crisps.

756
00:42:51,691 --> 00:42:53,210
They knew,
they knew that the line,

757
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,430
they knew where they were
and that they were okay,

758
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,160
but they said the buffalo are around
and they can stamp you to death about,

759
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,520
I didn't know Buffalo. So black
death, they called them really what

760
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,160
they're responsible for so much.
They're not as responsible as hippos.

761
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:10,670
Hippos are number one, but they,
they fuck a lot of people up man.

762
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,720
They don't take any shit.

763
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:15,350
And you think about bowls like people
when people try to ride bulls. Yeah.

764
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,730
Like domestic cow bulls.
They're ruthlessly aggressive animals.

765
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,760
You mean they'll fucking throw you
through the air now think of them but wild

766
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,700
and in Africa and fighting
off lions and that's,

767
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,620
that's African buffaloes.

768
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,950
I mean they are for Roche
Roche's animals and that just,

769
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,940
I didn't know what I had to do.
I know that with, um, hippos,

770
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,600
if you come in between their water source,
then they'll just kill you.

771
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:44,360
They'll fuck you up. I didn't know
what to do to buffalo's weather.

772
00:43:44,361 --> 00:43:47,700
I had to go anywhere near that
until that grabbed my room. Yeah.

773
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,630
If they find you to be a threat at all,
they're just so powerful.

774
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,220
They just just launch you in there.

775
00:43:52,221 --> 00:43:54,770
This is a great video that I was
watching this morning of a lion.

776
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,720
It was trying to take out a small buffalo
and the other one got behind the lion

777
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:04,340
and launched it through the air. It was
literally flying like 40 feet in the air,

778
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,260
like flipping head over heels.

779
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:11,150
Cause this the strength of this thing to
take a giant cat and just with its head

780
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,910
she's woo and just flies.

781
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,000
That wasn't the one with the
crocodile in it as well? No, no.

782
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:20,570
This was one that was on the
side of a dirt road. All right.

783
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:24,590
Have you had about the crossing
busy go to busy wild on Instagram?

784
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:28,460
I think that's the, have you heard
about the crocodile? I saw that, yeah.

785
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,510
That's interesting isn't it?

786
00:44:29,511 --> 00:44:33,920
Because I feel that about flow there are
acting like the local townspeople. Yes,

787
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,860
and that the, I think the lines
of the SS and the crocodile is,

788
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,460
is is another, yeah, this
is it. This is the video.

789
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,360
So it looks like the lions attacking
this one. Look at that. Boom. Oh,

790
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:47,210
it's actually not nearly as
high as I thought it was.

791
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:52,970
Maybe I'm thinking of another one. Yeah,
that one's pretty good though. I mean,

792
00:44:52,971 --> 00:44:55,100
just to see it do that. Oh,
you know what I'm thinking of?

793
00:44:55,101 --> 00:44:57,890
I'm thinking of relentless enemies.
That's what I'm thinking of. There's a,

794
00:44:57,891 --> 00:45:00,370
there's actually a, um, uh,

795
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,390
a documentary about this one particular
strain of lion that there was a,

796
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:10,750
apparently the river split sides or the
river changed its path and it turned

797
00:45:12,471 --> 00:45:17,471
this area into an island and the lions
had to adapt because the only thing that

798
00:45:17,751 --> 00:45:21,910
they could eat was buffalo, which
is very difficult to kill. You know,

799
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:25,250
usually they're eating antelope and other
smaller things that aren't nearly as

800
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:29,300
dangerous. Right? So these lions
developed, it became far larger.

801
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,600
So the female lions are as large as
a normal male lion and there hulking,

802
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,930
massive muscles and they're just enormous.

803
00:45:38,931 --> 00:45:43,160
It's just enormous strain of lion
that's exclusively eating buffalo.

804
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:46,700
And there's a whole documentary.
It's a national geographic documentary.

805
00:45:46,701 --> 00:45:48,440
I think it's really good,

806
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,380
but it's just incredible to see these
things walking around and they look

807
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:52,910
cartoonish still like the hulk.

808
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:54,680
Okay.

809
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,980
So it's hard to tell. You'd have
to compare them to a regular line,

810
00:45:57,981 --> 00:46:00,350
but there's some images of
these things walking around.

811
00:46:00,351 --> 00:46:05,150
They just look so much larger
than a regular lion because
they just had to adapt.

812
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:06,590
Yeah.

813
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:10,490
And I would think that if you're
running around, like if you're running,

814
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,030
you got to think like you're, you look
like something that's trying to get away.

815
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,650
What made running in that park? Yeah, no,
I was right next to the green vehicle.

816
00:46:18,651 --> 00:46:21,980
So the big metal green vehicle was
there and they just said stay close.

817
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,740
So I was one door flip away from,

818
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:27,610
I just launched myself
into the is open top.

819
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,220
So I would have been in that vehicle
before they got to me, I hope.

820
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,660
Did you hear about the woman from,
she was a,

821
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,350
an editor on the game of Thrones and she
was in one of those parks and she had a

822
00:46:38,351 --> 00:46:39,910
window rolled down and she,

823
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,370
they told her keep your
windows rolled up at all times.

824
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,090
And she was trying to take
better photographs and the
cat reached in and grabbed

825
00:46:46,091 --> 00:46:47,330
her and pulled her out of the,
out of

826
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:50,480
the vehicle and killed her.
This is the last year.

827
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:54,860
And then there they're a
dangerous creature. Yeah.

828
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:00,080
And you're just out there
running with them. Yeah. Well
I they, um, yeah, this is,

829
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:02,480
I was at a picture of it. Yeah. Oh God.

830
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:07,360
They have a picture of it happening is in
2015 wasn't really that long ago. Yeah.

831
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:12,140
Just looked it up yet. That's correct. It
wasn't recently. Um, my fax is terrible.

832
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,790
I was flying, Bro. Look at that though.

833
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:17,600
That is just so awful that they
actually caught it on camera. Well,

834
00:47:17,601 --> 00:47:21,410
she just thought it was, you know,
she was safe. She's in the car.

835
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:25,640
I reached in and grabbed her
and pulled her out. Yeah. I, uh,

836
00:47:25,641 --> 00:47:29,920
you're out there running around. I would
have a, there was a guy with a next to

837
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:35,010
it will be a good shot. He said
he knew how to shoot things. Um,

838
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,060
I,
I played my cards.

839
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,750
Sometimes you play your cards and what
must have been kind of exhilarating too.

840
00:47:40,751 --> 00:47:45,340
There's something about it, right
there was, I was talking to the zebras,

841
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,220
I just, I went up, cause
obviously they were not dangerous.

842
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:49,570
There's holiday non-dangerous ones.

843
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:54,810
It was actually the first day and the
bat was about marathon 10 or 11 or

844
00:47:54,851 --> 00:47:56,560
something. And I felt, you know,

845
00:47:56,561 --> 00:47:59,280
once you over the 10 mark and
I've never got there, you know,

846
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,900
if you've done the whole South African
thing and failed and people are tweeting

847
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:06,670
about me, Eddie is, you know, Africa kick
your ass. You know, you just go with Tia.

848
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,510
This is Africa. We're a
huge fucking constant. Hey,

849
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:15,550
that's what I say. No Africa. Yeah,
it's a big African because Africa is,

850
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,670
did you tell them, hey man, I was on
medication. My didn't really matter.

851
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:20,650
They're just not that whining.

852
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,590
So I just had to come back and I've
tried three times to come back and then I

853
00:48:24,591 --> 00:48:29,410
came back and uh, three times. Yeah, I
kept trying. Can we sell it the day that,

854
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:30,980
can we get back and do the thing?
But no,

855
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,860
we haven't got enough money
to be able to do that.

856
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:35,410
That won't be able to set up your
cables and then suddenly it's on,

857
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:40,300
it's on it's own. And I didn't,
I couldn't train again. And uh,

858
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,650
so I thought, let's just go get it
done. And then day five was in hospital.

859
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,090
Day Six was in the hospital as well.

860
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:49,630
For how off the two thirds of the marathon
on day six I have to go to hospital.

861
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:54,610
So for what? Um, well, it kept
what happened? Uh, they, my,

862
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:58,990
my train, my doctor had gone
away, but my train of thought, um,

863
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:04,240
he thought I just didn't look good.
It was, you know, 35, 38 degrees,

864
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,980
whatever, you know, and I'm
used to, what does that look?
One, oh, sorry. Fahrenheit.

865
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,360
Yeah, I'd say one 10, one
15, somewhere up there.

866
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:15,460
And um,
I was not used to that.

867
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,460
And so I was, I would've made
it, I feel, but he didn't,

868
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,310
he felt he wanted me to see next week.
So I saw a nephrologist,

869
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,390
I didn't even know what the word meant.
Nephrologist is a kidney expert.

870
00:49:25,391 --> 00:49:27,060
I thought that would be a renal expert.

871
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,950
We know it's a nephrologist
and it's very cool black dude.

872
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:34,030
And he was the in South Africa and eastern
East London. It's called as the city.

873
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,030
So it's the big place and he's going,
what are you doing? Who are you?

874
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:40,530
I'm running for Mandela,
what? I do this thing. And,

875
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:45,280
and uh, he said, it's, it's okay. We've
checked out your kidneys, your right,

876
00:49:45,281 --> 00:49:49,360
your bloods. Uh, it's, it's your
hydration. Hydration is terrible.

877
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:53,740
So I'm going to put three liters into
and you'll be paying like a horse all

878
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,870
night. And I didn't pay once. So
yeah, that's what you're saying.

879
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,520
You need some hydration and a,
and after that it got better with,

880
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:06,490
and so day 11, I got into
national, this national park,

881
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,470
so there's no one else there.

882
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,220
Just me and animals and this security
people in whatever with me. And,

883
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:16,810
uh, it was kind of beautiful. It was
just beautiful. And the sun was great,

884
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:20,860
a sunset going down and there was a
rainstorm as well in the middle of it,

885
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:24,790
the more wild animals out there,
I just felt okay. This zen,

886
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,040
weird place of beauty and also
knowing I'm getting stronger,

887
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:32,270
I'm getting stronger. I've gone
through the barrier. Um, and I also,

888
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:35,750
because I've written, I've run format
ans then a day off, and then the fifth,

889
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:37,560
sixth day I ran two thirds or math.

890
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:40,100
And so I'd run forward two
thirds marathons in six days,

891
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:41,890
which is not good numbers for your head,
right?

892
00:50:41,891 --> 00:50:44,540
You need five and five or
something in something.

893
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,850
But for two thirds maths in six days,
it just didn't work.

894
00:50:46,851 --> 00:50:48,740
And then I run another
marathon and I said, hang on,

895
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:51,920
I've got to run a marathon and a third
and get these numbers matching up.

896
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:55,670
So I caught up the third
marathon then it was always,

897
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:59,900
so it's day seven and I've run six,
eight mountains in nine days.

898
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:03,260
It was always one day behind. So I felt
last day I'll do a double math and,

899
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:08,740
and that'll be good climactic
and of my South African thing.

900
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:12,440
What, what is going on with your
mind when you're doing this? Because,

901
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,170
okay,

902
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:15,640
you're not listening to any music in your,

903
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:18,860
in this sort of meditative state where
you're just left foot, right foot,

904
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:21,270
left foot, right foot,
breathe in, breathe out.

905
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:23,960
I'm saying it's kind of Zen,

906
00:51:23,961 --> 00:51:27,560
but it's not in a kind of like I'm
listening to my heartbeat or anything.

907
00:51:27,561 --> 00:51:28,640
It's more like

908
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:34,620
I just feel,
uh,

909
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:40,770
it's just some sort of beautiful thing
of maybe cause that's what we used to be

910
00:51:40,771 --> 00:51:44,460
as humans. I maybe I'm reaching
back into some pause memory.

911
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,780
We humans just used to be out on the
plains and we were looking for honey wild

912
00:51:48,781 --> 00:51:52,620
honey or berries or some root stuff.
And then if we could trap something,

913
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:55,530
we'd kill either. I didn't know what
to, I can't quite work out what it is,

914
00:51:55,531 --> 00:51:59,570
but I just find it beautiful and I do know
that what you're getting vitamin D in,

915
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:03,730
you're getting stronger from that.
Um, somebody once read my hand,

916
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,370
I never do the hand palm reading,

917
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,940
but I was at a Halloween party and there
was a palm reader. Then I'll try it.

918
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,310
I'm in a good place.
Let's read my hand.

919
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:15,240
I can't remember what she's said except
you need to get out more easy to cut out

920
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,550
outside. And, and I thought okay,

921
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:20,910
I always felt that I needed to be bout
back doing stuff. Cause when I was a kid,

922
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:25,740
I live for soccer, for football. I used to
run like a crazy idea. I love that game.

923
00:52:25,741 --> 00:52:28,650
And then from the age of 12 I went to a
school that didn't play it and I never

924
00:52:28,651 --> 00:52:31,800
played sports. This is one of
my gifts to myself. Accident.

925
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:34,380
I think from the age of 12 you know,
you're in your teenage years,

926
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,970
your bones really moving and setting.

927
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,100
And at that time I was
hardly doing anything.

928
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,450
So I think my knees have never gone.
People say running in the knees,

929
00:52:42,451 --> 00:52:46,470
my knees are not gone. I got a whole
theory about the, the heel of the foot,

930
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,590
which it should never, you
know, you should, you know,

931
00:52:49,591 --> 00:52:52,390
sprinters are always on your toes.
Curl running should be on the toast.

932
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,220
And I think if the heel hits, that's what
causes the nails just needs to scroll.

933
00:52:56,221 --> 00:52:58,470
I'm a could be wrong. There's
no, no, that's correct.

934
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:02,160
That's not how people are supposed to run.
That was actually changed by Nike.

935
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:05,670
They developed a running shoe with a
fat heal and they changed the way people

936
00:53:05,671 --> 00:53:09,780
run. They changed the gate and it's
responsible for a lot of injuries.

937
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,200
I think that I'm noticing the horses,
if you look for the heel of a horse,

938
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,620
it's right up by that bum
cause the, the, the, the toes,

939
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:20,280
you know the hoof is the toes and then
you go all the way up that leg and right

940
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:24,390
by the bum is that's the heel. It's
just an enormously long foot and you go,

941
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:25,830
well that's never going to hit the ground

942
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,160
and a dogs don't eat cat standard.

943
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:33,120
We are the ones that use this hill thing
obviously initially to for walking to

944
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,080
make us balance when we went from the
chimpanzee. Good real estate agent.

945
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,740
We need to. But even then, I mean
most people if you just give them,

946
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,140
if they're barefoot like children for
example, like one of the things that I,

947
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:48,660
I was reading this book about barefoot
running and how important it is to

948
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:52,410
develop this and that.
Most people that have problems from that,

949
00:53:52,411 --> 00:53:55,650
they're really having problems because
their feet don't have strong muscles in

950
00:53:55,651 --> 00:53:57,240
them because of the atrophy.

951
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,630
And the way they were describing a regular
running shoes is essentially like a

952
00:54:00,631 --> 00:54:02,650
cast and that you're,

953
00:54:02,651 --> 00:54:05,660
you're so used to being protected in
this cath that everything's sorted,

954
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:07,620
just gets mushy. Yeah. Inside of it.

955
00:54:07,621 --> 00:54:10,620
And then you're also striking down on the
heel, which is a very unnatural thing.

956
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,570
And when I watch my kids run,

957
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:17,720
like my kids will run with me sometimes
and they naturally know to run on the

958
00:54:17,731 --> 00:54:21,750
balls of their feet. That's
how they naturally run. And
when people start running,

959
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,950
he'll first,

960
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:25,980
that's where all the problems come and
it's just not a normal way for people to

961
00:54:25,981 --> 00:54:26,814
run.
Yeah.

962
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:30,180
And I was also in initiative in South
Africa running on set and road surfaces

963
00:54:30,181 --> 00:54:34,350
where they'd just dropped instead of
doing a Tom Academ kind of covering, uh,

964
00:54:34,351 --> 00:54:38,440
they had just put rocks,
obviously some Lori had come along.

965
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,480
This truck just dropped rocks out of the
back to sort of hold together the mud

966
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:47,510
in the rainy times and
very uneven surface. Fay,

967
00:54:47,511 --> 00:54:50,040
how did the foot, and I was, uh,

968
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:53,820
I was doing these very thin soled
running very thin soled uh, shoes.

969
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,710
What kind of shoes are you running with?
Um,

970
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:00,000
well I kept changing them now so I could
I, with the vibrams or than the vive. Oh,

971
00:55:00,001 --> 00:55:02,420
barefoot ones. And unless you
were running around barefoot,

972
00:55:02,421 --> 00:55:06,780
we running marathons and barefoot shoes.
Well, initially I was, and then my train,

973
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,420
I, it just got so hard that I chose
to look, you're going to wear these.

974
00:55:09,421 --> 00:55:13,590
And then I left it to them to choose
my physio and he was Olympic level.

975
00:55:13,591 --> 00:55:15,180
So he said, these are going
to be better for that. I,

976
00:55:15,181 --> 00:55:18,210
I prefer you not to be in the, so I said,
okay, you tell me what shoes to wear.

977
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:20,110
I'll,
I'll take care of the,

978
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:25,020
but I do remember seeing little South
African children running on the roads next

979
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:26,970
to me when they call,
hey, we run with you.

980
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,180
And they are completely nothing on their
feet and they can deal with these sharp

981
00:55:30,181 --> 00:55:34,800
rocks. I thought were really sharp. I
was every few steps. Great. Whoa, wow.

982
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,260
And they would just, yeah, and
they would just, uh, they had,

983
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:42,030
they were laughing and running along
cause they their feed that built up like,

984
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:47,460
and it's very, this a very, how's that
South Africa? Yeah. It's a weird watch.

985
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:52,200
This, no, it's kind of fun because I
go right back. I ran with the flags.

986
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,330
That's,
that's a beautiful thing.

987
00:55:54,331 --> 00:55:57,060
And I was running in Eastern Cape
and they're looking at white guy,

988
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:01,960
white guy doing, and this is very rural
area. So I led say more low motor.

989
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,550
That was in the African National Park.
That was the rain. That was the, um,

990
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,860
they uh, they uh, where the rhinestone
heaven because he thunder and lightning.

991
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:14,430
But that's the, that's the truck there
on the left. You can see the thing.

992
00:56:14,431 --> 00:56:17,900
And this guy just turned up out
of the blue to track me there.

993
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,300
What did he give you? I just give me a
letter saying thank you for doing stuff,

994
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,980
but I if ran with the flag

995
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,740
and I said Molo to people
and I led us to say,

996
00:56:26,741 --> 00:56:31,741
how are you and in in the Cosa Gosa
this guy seems like he's wearing women's

997
00:56:32,741 --> 00:56:33,830
clothes as well.
Yes,

998
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:38,050
he's wearing a skirt and I think he's a
transgender guy with less hair than me

999
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:41,020
and yeah, he's bald, but
he's a transgender guy. Nope.

1000
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,490
Do you take hormones or anything or no.
No, but I could, I could transition,

1001
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:47,780
but then I've got this, I've got
these boy genetics going on. I mean,

1002
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,890
I really thinks it's genes. I think
they're going to find out how it works,

1003
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:52,330
but I can't prove that at the moment.

1004
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:57,400
But if I transition over then I'll just
be on the other side of this kind of

1005
00:56:57,401 --> 00:57:01,180
fence that we give ourselves. And
I've decided, okay, I'm gender fluid.

1006
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:03,660
I'm just going to have like a
superhero boy mode and girl moment.

1007
00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:06,910
Like the human torch can go flame
on the flame off. So I'm going,

1008
00:57:06,911 --> 00:57:10,990
when do you just do decide? Some
days today I'm boy mode. I can,

1009
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:15,430
but I tend to, uh, uh, do
sort of blocked periods now,

1010
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,570
but when I campaign, I mean girl
mobile, I'm doing films, dramatic films,

1011
00:57:19,571 --> 00:57:24,070
I've been boy mode. Um, and it's about
the transgender character. Think about it.

1012
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:29,200
Not really, no, but it's easy for me to
be in girl mode because then if I can,

1013
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,570
if I can deal with that and you know,

1014
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:35,590
some people stare at you and I have a
confidence now I carry myself with a

1015
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:38,260
certain confidence, they go, oh,
he seems to be quite confident.

1016
00:57:38,261 --> 00:57:41,470
So I'll just relax about that and I can,
I can actually,

1017
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,590
I can control other people's embarrassment
because if they don't know what to do,

1018
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:48,770
I'd say, hi, how are you? Can
I have a cup of tea? Oh yeah,
we sell to, oh, that's why.

1019
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:53,610
Okay. So I can just relax people
by just chatting to them. Um,

1020
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,720
and then boy, it's quite easy for
me to do cause I just, I just,

1021
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:02,560
boy and I scrub up quite well in boy mode.
Do you have,

1022
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:07,540
but you've given thought to transitioning.
Yup. Yeah. Yeah. Um, but, uh,

1023
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:08,921
you know,

1024
00:58:08,921 --> 00:58:13,921
the part of me wants to be Steve Mcqueen
in the greatest scale and part of me

1025
00:58:14,141 --> 00:58:18,400
wants to be Elizabeth Taylor in looking
like hone in a cat and a WHO's afraid of

1026
00:58:18,401 --> 00:58:22,420
Virginia Woolf cat on a hot tin roof,
which I just saw on the plane yesterday.

1027
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,670
So these are the two books I go between.
They're going,

1028
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,400
well I kind of both of them and
as a kid I thought, you know,

1029
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,340
Kinda look more like Clint,
the Steve McQueen.

1030
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:34,420
Cause I kind of fascinated with Steve
McQueen and what he went through to get to

1031
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:36,490
where he was and he was so driven.

1032
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,170
I don't know if you know about
this Steve McQueen story,

1033
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:43,650
you know that he was in a film with Paul
Newman and he was like 93rd on the list

1034
00:58:43,931 --> 00:58:48,070
of credits somewhere. Someone
up there likes me. If you
watch it, you can see him.

1035
00:58:48,071 --> 00:58:52,480
There's a knife fight between pulling
him and Steve Mcqueen and he's like a

1036
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:55,870
heavy, you know, young
thug kind of heavy guy,

1037
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,780
but he's just a small player.

1038
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:04,040
And then the second film he's in with
them is towering inferno where they are

1039
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:05,470
equal billing.

1040
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:10,360
And I think Paul Newman is first
and Steve McQueen is higher.

1041
00:59:10,810 --> 00:59:13,030
If you look at,
if you look at the names on the poster,

1042
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:14,860
Paul Newman comes in from the left,

1043
00:59:14,861 --> 00:59:19,861
so he's name is first and Steve Mcqueen
is on the right but higher than Paul

1044
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:23,260
Newman. That's how they got
equal billing without, you know,

1045
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,120
how do you put equal billing if you're
going to start from the reading from the

1046
00:59:26,121 --> 00:59:30,620
left, right. But uh, and if you remember
the film they come at it is two,

1047
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:35,690
two guys you say? Yeah. That both decent
guy. Yeah. These are both heroes. Yeah.

1048
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:39,290
That's a funny thing with actors,
right? Billing. Yeah. They want,

1049
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,310
they want to make sure that their name
is red first. Well that's, that's,

1050
00:59:43,311 --> 00:59:46,380
I mean you've got to have egos
to do these things. I mean,

1051
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:51,110
so many things need an ego to do them
and then hopefully you can switch,

1052
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,930
dial your ego down when you come off
state. Some people can't do that. Um,

1053
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,060
when it comes to billing state,

1054
00:59:57,061 --> 01:00:01,220
if you know about Steve Mcqueen and his
mum was a sort of sometime prostitute

1055
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:05,120
and had met in and out of the House
and his dad was just never there.

1056
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:10,190
And he found himself through a
boy's, a boy's retreat, you know,

1057
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:13,730
cause he was breaking the law and they
sent him off to this place and then they

1058
01:00:13,731 --> 01:00:17,270
told him to talk to these kids
that are train wild horses.

1059
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:21,350
And that was one of the first things
he did. And he was just so ambitious.

1060
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,760
And then with your Brenner
in, um, in magnificent seven,

1061
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,370
because you know,
if you know that film at the beginning,

1062
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:30,640
they've got your brothers, you know,
that feeling well wasn't actually,

1063
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:34,510
don't remember it. Well it's
maximum sentence. A great film says,

1064
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:39,170
got Yule Brenner with his coloring and,
but no habits,

1065
01:00:39,171 --> 01:00:41,420
such an amazing look.
And Steve Mcqueen at the beginning,

1066
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:46,421
they go up to boot hill to bury this
Indian guy boot hill and people are not

1067
01:00:47,061 --> 01:00:47,481
allowing it.

1068
01:00:47,481 --> 01:00:51,390
There's racism in the town and they both
go up and they ride shotgun again to

1069
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:56,210
hear us. But he was, he was Yule Brenner
was the top guy. And, uh, probably see,

1070
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,960
well Kiki, you see what you,
you see what Brendan's doing?

1071
01:00:58,970 --> 01:01:00,830
You see what his caravan is? Man, God,

1072
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:05,390
he's got all this stuff here and he
just wanted to be the top guy and he got

1073
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:09,710
there and it's, it's a beautiful story.
It doesn't end brilliantly, but you know,

1074
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:13,460
a bullet is great. Great
escape is great. Yeah.

1075
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:17,980
He's a fascinating guy. Steve McQueen
became a race car driver, like,

1076
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,260
yeah. Well serious race
card. Yeah, no, he,

1077
01:01:20,261 --> 01:01:24,710
he came second and the one
before there's a documentary on,

1078
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:29,820
on the Lamar, the mores, the 24 hour race.
And he, because he didn't race in, uh,

1079
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:30,890
in America,
which was,

1080
01:01:30,891 --> 01:01:34,730
I think it was a 12 hours and they came
second with a broken foot. He did it,

1081
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:38,360
you know, and he was just,
he's kind of a force of nature,

1082
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,350
but he was also do crazy things. I mean,
really crazy things, which is just not,

1083
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:47,690
we died fairly young to 50.
Then cancer. He was drinking.

1084
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:51,950
Yeah. I Dunno what it was. How you know,
we still don't know why people get cancer.

1085
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:53,540
My mum died when I,

1086
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:58,520
when I was six and she was a nurse
and never smoked and she died of bowel

1087
01:01:58,521 --> 01:02:01,400
cancer. I mean, what is, what is that?

1088
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,530
Nothing makes sense if you,

1089
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,130
unless you put in random into the world.

1090
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,930
That's my theory of the
universe to get there. Yeah.

1091
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,240
If you put random and it makes
sense stuff to 13.5 billion years,

1092
01:02:14,241 --> 01:02:18,620
we've had about 300 years since the
enlightenment and I just think we're lucky

1093
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:20,640
enough to be here.
We've had five great extinctions

1094
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,870
and we could have a six or we could look
after ourselves and treat as a people

1095
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,220
as you'd like to be treated yourself.

1096
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:30,780
That great rule do unto others
as you'd have done to you,

1097
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:34,020
and that if we did, if we all did that
tomorrow, the world would all work.

1098
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:40,110
Yeah. How do we do that? How do we get
that going? Well, it's better than it was.

1099
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,690
Yes, it's better than it was. Even
though it seems kind of hellish.

1100
01:02:42,691 --> 01:02:45,390
If anyone's pissed off with politics
at the moment, track yourself back.

1101
01:02:45,391 --> 01:02:48,480
If you're going to look at politics
from any time back in history,

1102
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:52,380
it's always been how it's always been
rubbish. It was print all over the place.

1103
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:57,060
And uh, I think, um,

1104
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:01,680
transparency as opposed to, oh,
pasty, if that's the word, you know,

1105
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,660
the more transparent things other
more where you can check, hey,

1106
01:03:03,661 --> 01:03:06,900
that guy's lying about that, you know,
if we can work out what's the line?

1107
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,180
What's not a lie?
That would be really nice.

1108
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,970
I didn't know if we could have
light detectors on all the time.

1109
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,230
Do I think it's going to be
mine reading, reading? Wow.

1110
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:20,910
I really think that we're going to have
technology within the next 50 years that

1111
01:03:20,911 --> 01:03:24,660
allows people to definitively understand
whether or not someone's being honest.

1112
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:29,400
That would, it would make it, um, I, I'm
sure someone could get a bad side of that,

1113
01:03:29,401 --> 01:03:31,950
but it's shoring up front. You think
there's a lot of good stuff on that.

1114
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,790
Someone could say, this is going to
happen though. I want this to happen.

1115
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,290
A lot of people, scams are going to
fall apart. What do you call him?

1116
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,660
Ponzi schemes. Ponzi schemes.
Pyramid schemes. Yeah.

1117
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,680
A lot of that it's going to
fall apart. Why they called
Ponzi schemes? Ponzi? Yeah,

1118
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:50,790
I think so. There's like a, there's a
bunch of those little terms like for Gazy,

1119
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,690
Jeff Ponzi I think for Gazy is one
that people use for fake. It was a,

1120
01:03:54,691 --> 01:03:58,920
there was a limousine company that was
writing bad checks for gazy limousine

1121
01:03:58,921 --> 01:04:02,010
service and it became like a thing on
the east coast where, Oh, this guy is a,

1122
01:04:02,011 --> 01:04:06,480
he's a for gazy cop. That means
you're a fake cop. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

1123
01:04:06,481 --> 01:04:10,640
For gazy became a big word.
Charles policy, that dirt bag.

1124
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:14,910
Look at him either. He's
happy. He's about to leave.

1125
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:18,800
[inaudible] walking, go roaring
twenties. Just wrapping paper law.

1126
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,280
Do we tell people as you're listing,

1127
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:24,270
please look up Charles
Ponzi on Wikipedia and

1128
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:29,040
yeah. So that's it. And how
did he die? Did he explode?

1129
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:33,420
Hopefully get hit by a meteor.
It'd be nice.

1130
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:37,530
So you are running for something now.
What are you doing? Um, I'm gonna go,

1131
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,290
I've said that for nine years.
Quite consistently.

1132
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:43,830
I would like to say that I
was going to run in 2020.

1133
01:04:43,831 --> 01:04:48,660
We had set terms in our politics,
like you always had,

1134
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:50,850
you've had a four year,
we arrange it into a five year,

1135
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:52,470
but then we've gone
back to the old system,

1136
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:57,800
which is where the prime minister of
the country can choose when they have an

1137
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,730
election and it can be
anywhere up to a day, you know,

1138
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:05,590
the next day after the election or, uh, up
to five years later. So we have no idea.

1139
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,860
So prime minister can decide,
you know what,

1140
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:10,110
we'll have another election in two weeks.
Yeah.

1141
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:13,440
And they wouldn't do that for them. But
you know, like we had a general extra 15,

1142
01:05:13,441 --> 01:05:18,441
2015 and then 2017 having
been in for only two years.

1143
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,940
Um, Theresa May was persuaded
that if you go over lecture now,

1144
01:05:21,941 --> 01:05:22,601
you're going to win big.

1145
01:05:22,601 --> 01:05:25,630
You can go into tons of extra seats and
then we'll be able to do whatever we

1146
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:29,360
want. But in fact, they lost seats
and they'll actually, so, you know,

1147
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:33,740
sometimes they grab it sometimes.
Um, you go in there. Fourth is it,

1148
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:36,910
there's a traditional thing of going in
the fourth year because if you've got

1149
01:05:36,911 --> 01:05:38,860
all the economics going and
everything's pretty good,

1150
01:05:38,861 --> 01:05:40,990
okay let's go now we've got 40,
but a year to spare.

1151
01:05:40,991 --> 01:05:43,600
But let's go in the fourth
year and we can, uh,

1152
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,110
cause we know we're in a good place and
then you have to allow I think six weeks

1153
01:05:47,111 --> 01:05:50,230
for an election campaign and,
but yeah, that's, we do that.

1154
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,830
I think other countries do that,
but I am sure to America you go,

1155
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:57,160
that sounds crazy. But anyway, that's
what we've been doing for some time.

1156
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:00,910
What are you gonna run for a member
of parliament for some constituency.

1157
01:06:00,911 --> 01:06:04,720
It hopefully in England would be my thing
as opposed to United Kingdom because

1158
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:07,360
there's whales and Scotland.
And is this a step?

1159
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:11,950
Are you going to move further along the
line or you are going to eventually that

1160
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:15,370
would be [inaudible] for an NP.
Then I would blend the jacks.

1161
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:16,320
I don't know if you know Glenda Jackson.

1162
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,100
She did this well I'll just shots of like,

1163
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:23,110
you know about him cause he went away and
then came back to creative work he was

1164
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:26,920
doing to doing films,
but he went away for seven years.

1165
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:28,720
So I will go away for a period of time.

1166
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:33,040
I put my career to hibernation
and just do politics. Just stupid.

1167
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:35,890
But you have a set period of time
where you're going to do this and then

1168
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:40,090
afterwards you're gonna retire? No,
I would do it. No set period of time.

1169
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:43,990
I just got to go off and
for as long as I can,

1170
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:47,290
as far as it got and then I come back
when I choose to come home. No stand up.

1171
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:49,150
No nothing during that time.
Could do standup.

1172
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:52,390
If you're raising money for charity.
If I'm raising money for the Labour Party,

1173
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:55,570
I party.
I think that would be allowable.

1174
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,050
I think my constituency members wouldn't
mind that if I was raising money for

1175
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:00,690
constituency.
Um,

1176
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:05,290
but if I was just doing it for myself
less, well you can write books.

1177
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:07,810
You like to write books and articles.
It's all a bit hazy.

1178
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:11,260
But I'm not sure if you have the same
system in. We have a similar system.

1179
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,240
My friend Doug Stan hope was running for
president briefly kind of as a lark and

1180
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:20,230
uh, realize that he really couldn't
do standup because if he did stand up,

1181
01:07:20,231 --> 01:07:24,400
he would have to allow equal time for
everyone else who wanted to perform,

1182
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,070
who also had some,

1183
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:31,210
like his standup performances were
then thought of as political campaign

1184
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:34,390
performances,
something along those lines.

1185
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:38,590
It was like some weird bullshit that he
was going to have to navigate that he

1186
01:07:38,591 --> 01:07:42,970
decided to just get back out of it.
But he was bullshitting the entire time.

1187
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:47,110
It was just doing it for fun. Now I'm
going to do it. I'm going to go in.

1188
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:48,850
I think a lot of moderate
people don't go in.

1189
01:07:48,851 --> 01:07:50,320
I consider myself a radical moderate.

1190
01:07:50,321 --> 01:07:54,580
I do radicle things with a
moderate message and they're
already done a number of

1191
01:07:54,581 --> 01:07:57,430
things like that and my life.
So I'm just going to take that in.

1192
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,620
And what's your goal?

1193
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:05,070
My goal is to try and encourage my
country in the world to go in a positive

1194
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:06,370
direction. I think, um,

1195
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,630
I've been saying this politically that I
think this is our last century on earth

1196
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:14,380
or it's our first century. I think
the next 80 years is for everything.

1197
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:16,070
We're going to choose everything here.
We're either going to

1198
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:20,060
wipe us off the planet or we're going
to make it a fair world for 7.5 billion

1199
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:21,800
people where you have a
right to have a farewell,

1200
01:08:21,801 --> 01:08:26,210
enough democracy and transparency,
enough money to live a life,

1201
01:08:26,211 --> 01:08:27,470
to have a family,
not everyone,

1202
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,010
not billions of people living
on $1 a day or $2 a day.

1203
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,040
So I think we need to get to there
because then immigration raises its head,

1204
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:38,150
your country, my country,
every country in the world.

1205
01:08:38,151 --> 01:08:40,700
And that's all people moving around
because they haven't got enough money to

1206
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:44,090
live on or they haven't been to security
because there's a war civil war.

1207
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:49,610
And if we could get beyond that, then a
lot of those problems drop away. So, but,

1208
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:53,990
and going into politics and talking
about a global vision of the future in

1209
01:08:53,991 --> 01:08:55,390
whatever it is,
a slightly,

1210
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,670
it's very difficult thing to do
because people are going to say, Oh,

1211
01:08:58,671 --> 01:09:01,730
you've just asked for that. How is
that helping this, this global vision?

1212
01:09:01,731 --> 01:09:06,731
But I just thought we seem to be trying
nineties 30 politics again and uh,

1213
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,840
in political area. So I
thought, well, I'm gonna,

1214
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,540
I ain't going to look for a vision,
a positive vision of the future.

1215
01:09:11,541 --> 01:09:13,850
And I know when I came
out as transgender and 85,

1216
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:16,400
there was no way I could imagine anything.

1217
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:17,570
I didn't know where it was going to go.

1218
01:09:17,571 --> 01:09:20,430
I just thought I need to go out
there and he'd to argue those,

1219
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:25,370
discuss at least try and set up a
positive image version, you know,

1220
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:29,910
cause uh, I'm not sure what age you are,
but I think it was 51 if everyone, so,

1221
01:09:29,980 --> 01:09:33,380
you know, I'm 57, so remember
the earlier years of our lives,

1222
01:09:33,381 --> 01:09:36,410
it was just so out there. Transgender,
you need to talk about it.

1223
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:38,420
There were gay and lesbian
people have with transgender.

1224
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:41,960
It was like some crazy out there and plays
well, what the hell are you on about?

1225
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:47,380
And that was what that was when I came
in the middle of that. It wasn't a,

1226
01:09:47,870 --> 01:09:50,490
it wasn't a, an easy
thing, but I just saw I'm,

1227
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:53,510
if I'm not going to do special
forces, I'll do this. Civilians,

1228
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:56,210
there's a hilarious group of choices,

1229
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:59,750
special forces or
transgender, well, I did the,

1230
01:09:59,751 --> 01:10:04,280
the civilian special forces to fight on
the streets and argue people and yeah,

1231
01:10:04,310 --> 01:10:06,560
and B. And it's all mental,
isn't it? If you're,

1232
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:10,550
if you're in a isn't any way the same
because people are shooting bullets,

1233
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:12,110
a union,
people are dying and getting blown up.

1234
01:10:12,111 --> 01:10:13,820
So I know there's a
massive difference there,

1235
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:18,110
but everything in the end
is psychological. And, um,

1236
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,570
if I wasn't going to do that,
I'm just gonna try and do this.

1237
01:10:20,571 --> 01:10:25,430
And I would take risks in
these areas of, of, you know,

1238
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,700
I'll go out and people say things in the
street, whatever they do and do that,

1239
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:30,080
and then I'll run the math itself

1240
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:35,690
going out knowing that you might have
to be in an altercation. Yeah, I,

1241
01:10:35,691 --> 01:10:40,590
I was sure that was going to happen.
Teenagers this point and screaming.

1242
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,600
Yeah, they're all assholes. Teenage
boys. This get the shit out of me.

1243
01:10:44,601 --> 01:10:47,830
And my friend Eric said, it's my friend
Eric Crisp. He said it to me once,

1244
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:48,910
he's like, you know, because uh,

1245
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:52,240
he was dealing with some teenage
boys in his hometown and he was like,

1246
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,810
the teenage boys are the most fucking
dangerous animals on the planet because

1247
01:10:55,811 --> 01:10:59,380
they have all this testosterone. No one's
really giving them any guidance yet.

1248
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:03,700
They're sort of just out there wild and
they're trying to outdo each other one

1249
01:11:03,701 --> 01:11:07,960
up each other, you know, and, and then
they're, they're cruel. They're cruel.

1250
01:11:07,961 --> 01:11:09,550
And they also are insecure.

1251
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:12,760
And so one of the ways to combat that
insecurity is to try to make someone else

1252
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:13,980
feel like shit.
It's like

1253
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,330
a sort of weird natural instinct
that people have. Well that, that is,

1254
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:20,430
that's what gossip is.
Hatred.

1255
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,440
Gossip is mild hatred and
Gus it when you say so,

1256
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:27,410
so they're less that you lower
their standard yellow there, uh,

1257
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:32,070
respect or the value or whatever by
saying something or you can do it as an

1258
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,320
action.
And in doing so you raise your own,

1259
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:38,820
I think at least we're not them because
they are shithead. Sure. Less than us.

1260
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:40,170
And that is a,

1261
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,760
that has gone on since the dawn of time,
unfortunately.

1262
01:11:44,790 --> 01:11:48,240
Well that's where you see the social
currency of today's like shame, climate,

1263
01:11:48,241 --> 01:11:52,290
like shaming people for this or that are
attacking people for whatever various

1264
01:11:52,291 --> 01:11:55,720
thing to do and trying to get public
shame against people. But they'd be,

1265
01:11:55,721 --> 01:11:58,170
especially people that haven't really
done anything wrong with what they're

1266
01:11:58,171 --> 01:12:01,590
doing is they're trying to do that to
elevate themselves and they see someone in

1267
01:12:01,591 --> 01:12:02,050
the public,

1268
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:05,910
I see someone who's famous or rich and
they're saying that person's a fucking

1269
01:12:05,911 --> 01:12:09,960
loser. And you know, sports figures
and perfect example, you know,

1270
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:14,230
like some super athlete and they drop
a ball, you fucking loser. You know,

1271
01:12:14,231 --> 01:12:14,790
and they're,

1272
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:19,790
they're doing this to sort of maximize
this sort of this like this downfall,

1273
01:12:22,111 --> 01:12:22,680
this,

1274
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:26,370
if they see anything that's going wrong
with that person's life and if they can

1275
01:12:26,371 --> 01:12:30,090
accentuate that, pump it up, it's somehow
or another, they think it elevates them.

1276
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,430
It actually does the opposite.
It's terrible for them.

1277
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:36,710
It's terrible for everybody.
But they have this natural instinct,

1278
01:12:36,711 --> 01:12:41,100
it's competitive instinct to push down
the person they think is elevated to high.

1279
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:45,150
Well I think that leads to the trolling
thing online that if you do from behind

1280
01:12:45,151 --> 01:12:47,480
a firewall of no one knows who I am.

1281
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,720
And I remember there was
something that we have bank notes,

1282
01:12:51,721 --> 01:12:55,310
like your bank notes that had a woman
on the back of one of our bank notes,

1283
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:56,050
the Queensland,

1284
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:00,070
the pictures on the front and then they
change it up every few years and they,

1285
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:02,820
they took the woman who
was on the back of it,

1286
01:13:02,821 --> 01:13:04,470
I think it was a 10
pound note or something.

1287
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:08,460
They took her off and they changed it.
And then there was this campaign,

1288
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:11,400
we need to get a w and a woman on the
back of another different motives.

1289
01:13:11,401 --> 01:13:16,390
Not gonna be that. And two
people, uh, trolled this,

1290
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,610
I think to women saying, you, you should
die to be raped. I mean hellish stuff.

1291
01:13:20,970 --> 01:13:23,790
One of them turned out to be a woman
who was actually attacking another wound

1292
01:13:23,791 --> 01:13:27,390
that you think or what's going on in
your head? Where's that coming from?

1293
01:13:27,391 --> 01:13:31,340
But behind this firewall you can,
you can go to any place of, well,

1294
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:35,820
so it's almost like they don't think that
a person that they're attacking online

1295
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,960
is an actual person.

1296
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:40,590
They're not getting the social cues from
them than not looking them in there. I,

1297
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:44,040
yeah, I just think it's a piss poor way
to communicate with people. I don't,

1298
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,370
I don't do any communicating
with people online.

1299
01:13:47,370 --> 01:13:50,610
I don't go back and forth with people
on Twitter in the back and forth.

1300
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:53,790
I don't comment on things.
I don't know anything.

1301
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:58,020
I S I talked so fucking much as it is
doing this. I'm like, I said enough.

1302
01:13:58,290 --> 01:14:00,900
I don't know if you don't know how
I feel about things, Jesus Christ,

1303
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:03,770
if you listen to this God damn
podcast, that's me. All right.

1304
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:05,310
I don't need to comment on other shit.

1305
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:08,820
I definitely don't need to comment in
text form back and forth with the person

1306
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:12,070
and try to explain myself or it's not,
there's no benefit in

1307
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:15,720
it. I used to, when I was doing standup
in the clubs and paypal might shout,

1308
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:19,450
fuck all of you. Oh, so you know from the
front. And I thought, well, you're drunk,

1309
01:14:19,451 --> 01:14:20,680
you're an idiot.
What am I don't care.

1310
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:23,680
And I would not think that person
really knows what they're talking about.

1311
01:14:23,681 --> 01:14:27,200
So I wouldn't go into a thing. I would
try and destroy them with you, you know,

1312
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:30,770
put them on some stuff.
But that's what's happening online.

1313
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,700
If someone's coming to you and I,

1314
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,240
and I used to not worry about them before
and suddenly I was worried about it.

1315
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:38,010
I thought, actually I'm,
I'm not worried about it.

1316
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:41,310
Just literally like thousands
and millions of hecklers. Yeah,

1317
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,600
that's really what it is. It's a
heckling thing. Some of the, I came up,

1318
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:47,670
the last one I did was something,
I said something and someone says,

1319
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:52,660
Eddie is a fuck you. And I
wrote back, no, fuck you.

1320
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,620
It was a very witty response.

1321
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:02,580
That's like five year olds as they
say loser. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1322
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:07,330
You, he was the loser.
Disconnect. So stupid.

1323
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:09,040
You never really feel good about it.

1324
01:15:09,041 --> 01:15:11,230
Even if you get a real good Zinger
on somebody, you're just like,

1325
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:15,930
what am I doing with my life?
Yeah. There was a, uh, yeah,

1326
01:15:15,940 --> 01:15:18,490
my dad's bigger than you.
That's what's going on.

1327
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:21,180
And my dad wasn't terribly
tall so I could never use that.

1328
01:15:21,940 --> 01:15:26,000
But what does it matter?
It has been. Yeah. And does
that really work for him now?

1329
01:15:26,001 --> 01:15:29,980
He keeps bumping into store the ways
when he goes, he's much too tall. My Dad.

1330
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:34,900
And so you're, you guys are
dealing with Brexit, right? Yeah.

1331
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:39,250
We've got a how's that changed the
climate of England? Well, it's made,

1332
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:42,940
it's made of a toxic, very, um, it kind
of like, what's happening over here,

1333
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:46,720
you know, it's all gone polarized. Um,

1334
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,950
like with the build the
wall stuff and it's,

1335
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:54,820
it's one side of the other than this,
no one in the middle in a way, if,

1336
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:57,700
if you look at succession and a,
um,

1337
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:01,630
Merican civil war that was
bound to happen at some time.

1338
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:06,550
If you go back to the
constitution, um, 1779,

1339
01:16:06,551 --> 01:16:10,660
87, that was what was happening. And
I think once you've European Union,

1340
01:16:10,661 --> 01:16:15,550
no one's ever tried from countries
that have hundreds of years of history,

1341
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:17,170
choose to try and lend to live together,

1342
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:19,660
work together some shape or form
this tricky thing we're trying to do.

1343
01:16:19,810 --> 01:16:22,420
It's the hardest thing politically that's
ever been done in the history of the

1344
01:16:22,421 --> 01:16:24,410
world. Um, and I think,

1345
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:28,000
cause I'm saying the American model with
native American lands and rolling over

1346
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:32,350
manifest destiny, it's a different model.
It's a different way of things happen.

1347
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:34,540
It's a different time as
well. Yeah. Different time.

1348
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:38,410
And native Americans didn't
have this idea of, oh,

1349
01:16:38,411 --> 01:16:41,050
we mark this off and we've
registered this land.

1350
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:45,400
So the idea that people are
learning to work together is, um,

1351
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:49,210
it's tricky. At some point someone
was going to say, I think we'd,

1352
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,880
we'd like to change this,
or we'd like to move out.

1353
01:16:50,881 --> 01:16:55,120
So this fight was bound to
happen. And, uh, so it's,

1354
01:16:55,121 --> 01:16:58,630
it's very toxic.
It's,

1355
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,030
I'm, I'm not getting too in right at
the center of it because you could just,

1356
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:07,300
you know, probably like
you have a New York, um,

1357
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:12,710
news broadcasts, you can listen to
people talking hours and hours and hours.

1358
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,030
And what do you think about,
what do you think of it?

1359
01:17:14,031 --> 01:17:18,980
And it doesn't seem to get
anywhere, right? So I worked
out what my worldview is,

1360
01:17:19,070 --> 01:17:21,590
this w w view that everyone's got
to have a fair chance in life.

1361
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:24,140
I know that automation
is happening right now.

1362
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,710
So there's going to be a whole load of,
uh,

1363
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:30,780
people who won't be able to get jobs
because of the unskilled labor force that

1364
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:32,780
job's going to get automated.
That's going to get tricky.

1365
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:37,040
So the universal wage is probably going
to have to come in the idea of universal

1366
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:39,900
basic income, universal basic, and
whichever one's going to have to get in,

1367
01:17:39,901 --> 01:17:42,500
it's not going to be a negative
thing. It's gotta be something. Okay,

1368
01:17:42,510 --> 01:17:46,360
then you can go off and you can retrain
or you could live your life. And uh,

1369
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,030
and then there's artificial intelligence
parity by 2050 next 30 years.

1370
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:53,900
And that's what is that mean?
We can't even work out what that means.

1371
01:17:54,690 --> 01:17:58,340
I think it's gonna get harder before it
gets easier. And so I'm going to just,

1372
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,290
I always play the long game. I always
do the long game. So, you know,

1373
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:04,490
I came out and back in 95
and I just thought, well,

1374
01:18:04,491 --> 01:18:09,491
hopefully it will get better over time
and now this world up in 2019 and it's

1375
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:13,040
definitely better than it was, but it can
go backwards, forwards, back. But I just,

1376
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:16,190
I'm going to try and shoot for that.
And the,

1377
01:18:16,370 --> 01:18:20,630
everyone has a fair chance
in life and as to Brexit,

1378
01:18:20,631 --> 01:18:24,050
where that goes when they,
you know, positive, negative,
you know, I'm against it.

1379
01:18:24,051 --> 01:18:24,980
So I was just going to find that.

1380
01:18:24,981 --> 01:18:29,300
I don't need to think about whether I'm
against it. I just know that I want,

1381
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,390
the younger people are coming online to
vote now they're old enough to vote and

1382
01:18:32,391 --> 01:18:34,700
they 78% of them want
to be part of Europe.

1383
01:18:34,730 --> 01:18:37,910
And the older people who are passing away,

1384
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:41,810
probably 70 80% of them wanted to be
out of here because that's a fear thing.

1385
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:45,080
Immigration, fear of, well there's
the thing, you've got to be,

1386
01:18:45,081 --> 01:18:48,290
have to be brave and curious
rather than fearful and suspicious.

1387
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:52,460
And these are the two ways I think
people can go. If we're brave enough,

1388
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:54,170
we can be curious and
say, hi, how are you?

1389
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:56,600
Where are you from and what do you do it?
Can we learn from you?

1390
01:18:56,601 --> 01:18:59,450
Can you learn from us? I think that
is the way for humanity to go forward.

1391
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,020
Or you can be fearful and suspicious like
what? Hang on, they'll back off outside.

1392
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,060
Don't, I don't want to talk to you.
I don't want to know about you.

1393
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:07,820
And that's the fearful and suspicious way.

1394
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:11,240
And I think we have to
be brave and curious,

1395
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:14,420
otherwise we're not going to make it.
So for us in America,

1396
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:19,070
what you're essentially dealing with a
bunch of different countries that speak a

1397
01:19:19,071 --> 01:19:20,360
bunch of different languages,

1398
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,450
whereas we're dealing with a bunch of
different states that speak the same

1399
01:19:23,451 --> 01:19:26,600
language, but it's kind of
doesn't make any difference. Yeah.

1400
01:19:26,610 --> 01:19:28,760
It's interesting because I thought
if everyone could get the hang,

1401
01:19:28,761 --> 01:19:31,130
because English has become a
Lingua Franca for the world,

1402
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,380
hasn't made much difference.

1403
01:19:33,380 --> 01:19:35,960
And America shows you can be
completely at loggerheads,

1404
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:37,280
whether you saying the same words or not.

1405
01:19:37,281 --> 01:19:39,770
I think if you're not saying the same
words, it's easier for people to say,

1406
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:41,090
who are these people?

1407
01:19:41,091 --> 01:19:44,510
We hate them because I can't understand
a single word they're saying that's

1408
01:19:44,511 --> 01:19:48,530
easier. It's an easier way to be
xenophobic slash racist on it.

1409
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:54,270
And I've always said a xenophobia is
just a racist where the xylophone check,

1410
01:19:54,370 --> 01:19:58,970
which I got to use software to
political situation. Um, but uh,

1411
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:02,900
it's, it doesn't seem to make
the big difference in the end.

1412
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:05,830
We have enough ways of translating
and stuff and you, and,

1413
01:20:06,390 --> 01:20:08,070
and most people in most countries

1414
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:11,040
now can reach for English if they
need to. You know, like some people,

1415
01:20:11,041 --> 01:20:15,330
I think Putin will always speak in
Russian. Um, any, any leader of a country,

1416
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:18,810
we'll probably use their own language
first and talk to their own country people

1417
01:20:18,811 --> 01:20:22,170
first and then they might
throw in something in English
or in an interview. So,

1418
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,870
but we can always tend, we can
work out from vibe, you know,

1419
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:28,500
where most people are
standing coming in. So, uh,

1420
01:20:28,680 --> 01:20:33,680
well I think that we're probably pretty
close to some form of viable translation

1421
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:38,310
technology. Like you know, Google
had these uh, Google earbuds. Yeah,

1422
01:20:38,690 --> 01:20:41,210
you can do on the Google App
without even the air buds.

1423
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:44,780
If you go to Google translate and
you hit the microphone on that,

1424
01:20:44,781 --> 01:20:47,730
you can just say hello. Good
afternoon. Was it? And you can,

1425
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,700
if it's on the fringe button,
they'll come out in French.

1426
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:51,510
So I haven't done it in the field.

1427
01:20:51,511 --> 01:20:55,710
I would like to get out to somewhere
out in the sticks and actually I should

1428
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:57,960
test it out. I'll make
that a, the Google earbuds.

1429
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:01,080
I think the idea is that like if
you were talking to me in French,

1430
01:21:01,081 --> 01:21:03,720
it would translate it
instantaneously to English.

1431
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:08,190
You know it's probably a Beta version of
it now or like a clunky version of it,

1432
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:11,670
but ultimately we're going to have
something that allows you to do that.

1433
01:21:11,671 --> 01:21:12,810
There's also Google Lens.

1434
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:17,000
You could I use that when I was traveling
or you could take the the camera and

1435
01:21:17,001 --> 01:21:19,110
you look at it and they'd translates.

1436
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:23,400
I've foreign languages and to that Song
Google translate the Google translate

1437
01:21:23,401 --> 01:21:25,650
verbal one at the moment
does line by line.

1438
01:21:25,651 --> 01:21:27,790
So you have to say a line shaver line.

1439
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:33,300
I mean just think about what technologies
existed 20 years ago and how more much

1440
01:21:33,301 --> 01:21:36,690
more advanced they are now and then add
that to translation and that exponential

1441
01:21:36,691 --> 01:21:37,770
increase.
It's probably going to,

1442
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:42,180
we're probably going to lose a lot of
these barriers of misunderstanding.

1443
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,180
It is interesting.
I do think we,

1444
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:47,880
we have created some amazing positive
things going forward and we tend to bank

1445
01:21:47,881 --> 01:21:51,930
them and then we don't get a hit
off. Wow. We've got that now.

1446
01:21:52,490 --> 01:21:57,360
Like we can make coffee quite easily.
The grinding of Covey isn't so,

1447
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:00,720
but then we just go, okay and then we'll
find something else to piss us off.

1448
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,710
So trying to keep ourselves happy cause
when my happy enough and then it's

1449
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:08,760
usually economics where people are
happy enough, there's less racism,

1450
01:22:08,761 --> 01:22:11,100
less immigration plugs, there's
less, everything's less.

1451
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:13,500
When everyone's running out of money,
they get pissed off.

1452
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:14,910
I'm totally understandably,

1453
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:19,680
but we need to make the economy of the
world work and then it would be an easier

1454
01:22:19,681 --> 01:22:24,610
place. But how do we do that? How do you
make the economy of the world? Yeah, no,

1455
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:29,100
yes, that's an easy line to say and
it's very difficult to work it out.

1456
01:22:29,101 --> 01:22:31,830
But I do think as you gradually
learn to live together,

1457
01:22:31,831 --> 01:22:33,750
work together as we
gradually come together.

1458
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,510
I mean it's like in the European Union,
say in America,

1459
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:39,720
if certain parts of America or
European Union having a tough time,

1460
01:22:39,721 --> 01:22:41,030
then money goes to those places.

1461
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:44,460
Having a tough time to try and get them
back on their feet so that they can come

1462
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:47,790
back in and start making enough money to
be able to help other parts. And that's,

1463
01:22:47,850 --> 01:22:49,950
that's the idea.
Um,

1464
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:53,790
and that's a logically a model that
should be able to work in the world,

1465
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,570
uh, as we, as we head
towards it. Cause you know,

1466
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,170
we know that was a terribly
expensive in a lot of people die.

1467
01:23:01,180 --> 01:23:02,390
That doesn't seem to get anywhere.

1468
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:06,370
Surely we should have learned this as
we go back. So conk wars of conquest,

1469
01:23:06,371 --> 01:23:08,170
I don't think they are
going to happen anymore.

1470
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:11,890
Quite like the idea we're going to invade
this thing like the old empire stuff,

1471
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:17,020
which I think the Nazis did
the last version of that
for an wars of conquest and

1472
01:23:17,021 --> 01:23:21,700
now we're being replaced by wars of
defense was of defense or wars that are

1473
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:25,680
hidden behind things. You know,
under some other old specific tents.

1474
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,650
We need to, we've come in to defend these
people, but they didn't need defense.

1475
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,250
What was Grenada about it?

1476
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:35,720
And it's still that Reagan was doing
and Grenadier failed attempts to control

1477
01:23:35,721 --> 01:23:40,510
the natural resources. Well I think
that's what a lot of these are. Yeah.

1478
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,810
And you know, and then it's
economic wars. It's supposed to.

1479
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:49,280
And then stopping terrorism in its
tracks and trying to keep these radical

1480
01:23:50,201 --> 01:23:53,170
terrorists from taking over
certain countries and strongholds.

1481
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,180
But we don't really have
done a good job of that.

1482
01:23:55,720 --> 01:23:58,360
When there's a will you need to do that.

1483
01:23:58,361 --> 01:24:03,361
And then people in their countries
understandably don't like people dying a

1484
01:24:03,391 --> 01:24:07,990
broad and then was a defense.
Do they,

1485
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,990
I wonder whether that's kind
of happening and then you know,

1486
01:24:10,991 --> 01:24:15,070
there's this thing called a right to
defend the idea that that countries that

1487
01:24:15,071 --> 01:24:19,900
are better set up should be able to go
in or should be willing to go in and

1488
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:20,291
defend.

1489
01:24:20,291 --> 01:24:24,460
People are having a really tough time
and tried to get the pot politics to work

1490
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:27,100
on that. You know, if someone
is menacing, the sheer,

1491
01:24:27,101 --> 01:24:29,740
when Hitler was menacing
within his own country,

1492
01:24:29,741 --> 01:24:32,560
no one did anything and that when Stalin
was meant a second its own country now

1493
01:24:32,561 --> 01:24:36,130
one, you know, cause about 30 million
dive understanding. But no one went in.

1494
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:40,270
No one said, hey we got a whistle
blowing time to go in and help you just,

1495
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:43,960
we didn't go in, well we don't
even go in for North Korea. I mean,

1496
01:24:43,961 --> 01:24:45,610
we're in this weird
position with North Korea.

1497
01:24:45,611 --> 01:24:50,611
We have this military dictator who was
clearly oppressing his entire nation and

1498
01:24:51,551 --> 01:24:56,230
this strange to see in
2019 the limited internet.

1499
01:24:56,320 --> 01:24:57,790
I mean,
they have like an intranet.

1500
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:01,300
They have like their own version of the
Internet where they have a few websites

1501
01:25:01,301 --> 01:25:05,650
that you could visit. We've got everybody
locked down and extreme poverty,

1502
01:25:05,651 --> 01:25:10,090
extreme hunger, like the, the,
the ones that have escaped
from North Korea. I mean,

1503
01:25:10,091 --> 01:25:14,150
if they've had these soldiers and they're
malnourished, they have parasites. It's,

1504
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,380
it's an awful,
awful condition this way right now.

1505
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,920
And if you see when North
Korea does military maneuvers,

1506
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:24,250
it looks like the Nazis and you thought,
well, that Nazi thing, well, you know,

1507
01:25:24,700 --> 01:25:25,750
I don't like the Nazis as tool,

1508
01:25:25,751 --> 01:25:27,440
but how did they get all these
people doing that and say,

1509
01:25:27,441 --> 01:25:29,920
oh well the North Korea could do it.
Well, hang on, this is just a thing.

1510
01:25:29,921 --> 01:25:32,080
If you spend all your time
just marching up and down,

1511
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:37,210
you can make that happen
and Leni Riefenstahl can
go and film it and with low

1512
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:41,740
angles and make it look dramatic.
Make you look fearsome.

1513
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,080
Yeah,
but we're,

1514
01:25:44,081 --> 01:25:48,280
we're better off globally than we
were during World War II. Right?

1515
01:25:48,281 --> 01:25:52,870
The world is better off the world is
better off in the Western world is more

1516
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:54,490
progressive and more open minded.

1517
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:59,440
Since you came out in 1985 versus in
2019 where we're sitting here today,

1518
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:01,990
it's a different world,
different environment. I,

1519
01:26:02,010 --> 01:26:05,900
that's why I'm a glass is two thirds full.
I do think we are in a better place.

1520
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:10,100
There is more tolerance. It does go a few
steps forward. One step back and then,

1521
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:14,450
and always you're always going to
have Charlottesville Nazi rallies.

1522
01:26:14,540 --> 01:26:18,200
It was going to have like weird pockets
of racism and weird thing where you're

1523
01:26:18,201 --> 01:26:20,250
like, I can't fucking believe
this is still happening.

1524
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:22,760
You're going to have a little,
little setbacks.

1525
01:26:22,850 --> 01:26:25,070
I didn't know there was
something in Germany,

1526
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:28,530
something like 10,000 people were
wanting to vote for the Nazi by,

1527
01:26:28,580 --> 01:26:31,190
or maybe it's more, but you know
that's a country of 80 million,

1528
01:26:31,191 --> 01:26:32,870
so let's get the perspectives right.

1529
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:35,790
Certain things happen in there
on television and you go, whoa.

1530
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:39,260
That's obviously why they do them. To
create an outreach, get on television,

1531
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:42,290
and you go, wow, that's, it's all over.
It's happening everywhere. Oh, well no,

1532
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:46,610
there's this small place.
Yeah,

1533
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:51,070
I mean sometimes, well, the
beautiful things that human
beings can do is stunning.

1534
01:26:51,071 --> 01:26:55,220
We, you know, we have so many stories
of just amazing things that humans do.

1535
01:26:55,221 --> 01:26:58,370
And then you put the horrible things
that we can do that goes on forever.

1536
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:01,370
If there was a god, I don't believe in
a god, but if he did come down, I said,

1537
01:27:01,371 --> 01:27:05,630
what did you guys do? Who are these
bastards? And you guys well done you guys,

1538
01:27:05,631 --> 01:27:07,820
but who are these better?
Well, I, you know, well,

1539
01:27:07,821 --> 01:27:11,390
they've always said the Lord works in
mysterious ways. So like of the world,

1540
01:27:11,480 --> 01:27:14,930
I doubt that's fucking mysterious.
Maybe seven. It's the correct,

1541
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:18,230
I think wellbore to was a test for
God because 60 million people died.

1542
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,850
And at some point we're saying,
okay,

1543
01:27:19,851 --> 01:27:23,240
how many people need to die before you
come and blow whistle and just say, Whoa,

1544
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:26,810
what's the guy with the mustache doing?
Let's get it ready. Get him off the board,

1545
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:30,740
flick him off the board. That was my
test for, for God. And he didn't come.

1546
01:27:30,741 --> 01:27:34,640
So I think it's up to us kids. Well, he
didn't come when we mean what they did,

1547
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:36,470
the Nazis did was obviously horrific.

1548
01:27:36,471 --> 01:27:39,980
But what we did when we drop nuclear
bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

1549
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:41,870
that's pretty fucking horrific as well.

1550
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,160
No intervention whatsoever from the
big guy. No, no. He didn't come in.

1551
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:49,310
I mean he didn't catch the bomb and mid
air go and Hank, there's kids down there,

1552
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,370
there's women down there.
There's diseases are not soldiers.

1553
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:56,800
I need to say this and I know
I'm not taking the from the,

1554
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,780
the Japanese,
I thought the Nazis were fanatics,

1555
01:27:59,781 --> 01:28:03,020
but the Japanese at that time
took it even more fanatical.

1556
01:28:03,030 --> 01:28:06,830
You know when the last Japanese soldier
surrendered, you know what year that was?

1557
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:09,170
It's like 1980 or
[inaudible] 75 I think it is.

1558
01:28:09,171 --> 01:28:12,050
I think you could listen to that one.
You can Google. He was on an island.

1559
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:12,920
I mean that,
I mean,

1560
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:17,921
how fanatical do you need to committed
still 1975 [inaudible] 74 or 75 cents.

1561
01:28:18,980 --> 01:28:23,210
Yeah. Okay. I, I, I give up. Well,
they have an amazing warrior culture.

1562
01:28:23,211 --> 01:28:25,100
I mean you think we were
talking about martial arts,

1563
01:28:25,190 --> 01:28:30,190
a giant percentage including judo and
Jujitsu of martial arts came from this one

1564
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:31,874
island.

1565
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:35,840
They perfected so many different martial
arts and it's more the Japanese than

1566
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:39,840
any other country in
Asia. Well, um, being day,

1567
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:45,200
I think the ties did it best. I think
the ties develop the best striking style.

1568
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:47,600
And then the Japanese developed
the best grappling style.

1569
01:28:48,470 --> 01:28:51,560
But the Japanese are known as
more warlike than the tires.

1570
01:28:51,561 --> 01:28:55,460
You never had the time or did they used
to in the ties figured out the best way

1571
01:28:55,461 --> 01:28:59,840
to gamble on fights. They figured out
the best, most brutal style of fight.

1572
01:29:00,230 --> 01:29:01,270
And that is they,

1573
01:29:01,271 --> 01:29:04,650
they incorporated a lot of things that
other people didn't with including like

1574
01:29:04,651 --> 01:29:07,580
leg kicks and knees and elbows and,

1575
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:11,340
and they fought really often.
Like they would have these,

1576
01:29:11,341 --> 01:29:13,150
like to this day they have limb,

1577
01:29:13,151 --> 01:29:15,930
Piney Stadium and all these
different stadiums in Bangkok.

1578
01:29:15,960 --> 01:29:20,790
They have the stadium
champions and they'll have
matches on a consistent basis.

1579
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,670
And so these people are fighting from
the time they're really, really young.

1580
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:27,570
Like they're taking like six and seven
year old boys in there and girls as well.

1581
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:31,620
And they're sending them off to these
tie camps and teaching them how to fight

1582
01:29:31,621 --> 01:29:32,670
and then having them fight.

1583
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:35,460
You know they have a hundred
fights by the time they're 16

1584
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,670
wow.
Yeah,

1585
01:29:38,930 --> 01:29:43,260
it was just with Thailand it's very
strange because they're so friendly.

1586
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:45,030
They're so smiley and friendly.

1587
01:29:45,031 --> 01:29:49,440
Yet they developed probably the most
fearsome striking style on the planet.

1588
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:54,150
I can't. And then they've got a,
there's a transgender thinker as well.

1589
01:29:54,170 --> 01:29:55,120
That's a lot of that going on.

1590
01:29:55,670 --> 01:30:00,330
They've and the Venn diagrams of what's
going on there that they're crossing or

1591
01:30:00,331 --> 01:30:04,720
what is intersecting here? So much great
food. I mean they have so much cool shit.

1592
01:30:04,721 --> 01:30:09,390
That beautiful environment. It's a weird
placement. Thailand's a weird place.

1593
01:30:09,390 --> 01:30:13,030
I love it. Do they feel in apocalypse
now that, cause I think they did well.

1594
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:16,140
Is that in Vietnam? No nerves.
There was some, she sat me down,

1595
01:30:16,170 --> 01:30:19,760
but I think that it's some of it in
Vietnam now. They did nothing. Nothing.

1596
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:23,340
It was typically, it was too
close dates. Why was it Thailand?

1597
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:29,160
I bet it took fucking forever. It makes
sense. Philippines. No, that's right.

1598
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:31,140
It was Marcos. Yeah. Cause they,

1599
01:30:31,380 --> 01:30:35,770
cause Marcos kept saying what the
aircraft back. I want the helicopters.

1600
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:38,760
The helicopters are coming in and
they piss off somewhere. Isn't funny.

1601
01:30:38,761 --> 01:30:42,720
When a Marcos, when that whole
regime went down, all we heard about,

1602
01:30:42,721 --> 01:30:44,890
what's the Mel Demarco is shoes.
It's always,

1603
01:30:44,970 --> 01:30:48,180
remember the whole thing that the debate
was had a bad time that cause they were

1604
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:50,880
invited to a place that they
didn't know about. All right.

1605
01:30:50,881 --> 01:30:52,830
Everybody got my head though.
That's what they lost to it.

1606
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,310
That was the only way the back of a
truck they're holding on the street,

1607
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:58,220
the back of a truck go,
okay we're not going to,

1608
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,210
why are we playing all these places?
You know,

1609
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:01,860
that's when they started
getting a hold of there.

1610
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,310
We're going to do what we want to do
rather than what someone else wants.

1611
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,760
So I mean I,

1612
01:31:07,761 --> 01:31:12,720
I'm with you in that I am
ridiculously optimistic.

1613
01:31:13,020 --> 01:31:16,100
Well that's good. I think that,
I think people, I mean I'm,

1614
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:18,740
I follow Steven Pinker's logic of that.

1615
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:21,690
People will sort of look at the,

1616
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,540
the horrible things that
we have today and say, God,

1617
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:27,780
this world is terrible though.
There are definitely terrible aspects,

1618
01:31:27,930 --> 01:31:31,710
but this is without doubt the greatest
time ever to be alive that we've ever

1619
01:31:31,711 --> 01:31:34,860
seen, at least in recorded human
history. I would agree with that.

1620
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:38,010
I think communication is a
giant part of that. It is.

1621
01:31:38,011 --> 01:31:42,990
This is this global a world
which we thought was going
to be beautiful thing and

1622
01:31:42,991 --> 01:31:45,030
they're busy. I don't know.
It's a hellish thing. In fact,

1623
01:31:45,060 --> 01:31:48,960
it's got beautiful aspects and some
hallux aspects as any invention has.

1624
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:53,460
You know, like Internet, hey, you can
teach someone how to save their life on,

1625
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:56,250
on the Internet. Ah, you can also teach
them how to make a bomb on the event,

1626
01:31:56,251 --> 01:31:59,710
you know? So I think this is always
the way, every next step we get,

1627
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,270
we will have some positives.

1628
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:04,600
Then we'll hit the all the negatives and
then we'll go back to small positive.

1629
01:32:04,601 --> 01:32:09,320
So yeah, I've, I've got to be able to miss
it. Yeah. Well I am an optimistic person.

1630
01:32:09,330 --> 01:32:13,330
I otherwise it just wouldn't be here.
But this military aspect that I mentioned,

1631
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:16,930
I'm flipping back to that. But yeah,
I do try and think I need to do this.

1632
01:32:16,931 --> 01:32:19,120
I think that's a good thing to do.
Now. I need to do that. If the 10,

1633
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:21,790
nine years I've been saying I'm going
to politics, I'm going next year,

1634
01:32:22,030 --> 01:32:25,300
but it might not be a general election.
I try and plan ahead because I can't,

1635
01:32:25,301 --> 01:32:29,260
I see if I randomize it and I just
float because a lot of people do. Wow,

1636
01:32:29,290 --> 01:32:31,240
this happened and then that happened.
And then I was like,

1637
01:32:31,570 --> 01:32:34,630
and that could be a wonderful life.
But I have my river analogy.

1638
01:32:34,631 --> 01:32:38,590
If you're canoeing down a river, um, if
you go at the same speed as the river,

1639
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:41,320
it could throw you under rocks.
He could give you a wonderful ride.

1640
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:44,710
It could be anything, but it's up to
the river. Whereas I pedal like crazy.

1641
01:32:44,711 --> 01:32:46,210
Sometimes I back pedal like crazy.

1642
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,320
I have actively backpedal
against things and sometimes,

1643
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:53,860
usually I'm peddling faster than the
speed of the river to try and guide myself

1644
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:57,730
through them. And you see that
whenever I do these canoeing. Um, well,

1645
01:32:57,740 --> 01:32:59,770
anyone driving a boat through for river

1646
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:03,630
I, when I look at human
interactions objective Lee,

1647
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,720
part of me has to consider that there's
a possibility that we need all this

1648
01:33:09,031 --> 01:33:14,031
negative in order to reinforce the
positive that there is some component of

1649
01:33:14,641 --> 01:33:19,620
human life that desires or,

1650
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:25,850
or relies upon negative
things to reinforce positive
things that this yin and

1651
01:33:27,481 --> 01:33:29,880
Yang that we exist under, that this, this,

1652
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:35,010
that we see the horrors of war and
horrific poverty and all these terrible

1653
01:33:35,011 --> 01:33:36,630
things and the horrible violence.

1654
01:33:36,900 --> 01:33:41,900
We see this and it actually serves to
reinforce our desire for positive things

1655
01:33:42,241 --> 01:33:46,820
and reinforce and push our society in
a more positive direction. I mean, I'm,

1656
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:51,300
I almost think that this is when we see
national tragedies and shootings and all

1657
01:33:51,301 --> 01:33:54,030
these different, terrible,
terrible things, there's,

1658
01:33:54,060 --> 01:33:57,000
there's all this fear and
anger and frustration,

1659
01:33:57,001 --> 01:33:59,910
but there's also action
and the action might be,

1660
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:04,110
might think there's a lack of action by
politicians are lack of action by the

1661
01:34:04,111 --> 01:34:06,500
police or a lack of action by,
you know,

1662
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:11,540
whoever we think should be responsible
for mitigating these horrible situations

1663
01:34:11,611 --> 01:34:16,440
that happen. But publicly the, the,
the, the social fabric of the world,

1664
01:34:16,441 --> 01:34:18,330
the way people communicate and interact,

1665
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:23,480
I think it reinforces our desire to not
have that happen. It reinforces our,

1666
01:34:23,481 --> 01:34:27,510
our understanding of peace and our,
our love of peace.

1667
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:32,580
And I think that these,
these bad things that we see in our world,

1668
01:34:32,581 --> 01:34:36,240
they're almost propel us towards a
better world because human beings are

1669
01:34:36,241 --> 01:34:39,840
constantly striving for
improvement and innovation.

1670
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:41,160
This is one of the things that we do.

1671
01:34:41,161 --> 01:34:44,130
We want things to be better and
bigger and faster and stronger.

1672
01:34:44,131 --> 01:34:47,430
And we want our society to be better at
all times. We never say this is good,

1673
01:34:47,431 --> 01:34:51,510
let's keep it just the way it is.
We never, we never say that. So my,

1674
01:34:51,540 --> 01:34:55,530
my thought is that even this, even what
we were experiencing in this country,

1675
01:34:55,531 --> 01:34:59,060
we like it seems at times that were
almost like on the brink of civil war

1676
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:03,260
between the right and the left and people
are lying on both sides and conflating

1677
01:35:03,261 --> 01:35:06,680
people's opinions and changing people's
perspectives in order to suit their own

1678
01:35:06,681 --> 01:35:07,514
narrative.

1679
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:12,050
That I think that this ultimately all
this angst and you see it from the outside

1680
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,270
and you look at it, go,
what the fuck are we doing?

1681
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:18,680
I think it's a natural part of the
way human beings figure out life.

1682
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,690
I shall respond to. Sure. Yeah. I,

1683
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:31,290
I think, I think almost the same as you.
I would opt to slightly differently.

1684
01:35:31,291 --> 01:35:34,950
I'd noticed that humanity only sometimes
gets going and does things when he's

1685
01:35:34,951 --> 01:35:38,550
right up against the wall. You know
somebody that needs these things to go on.

1686
01:35:38,551 --> 01:35:39,960
If you took a wellbore to scenario,

1687
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:44,250
we went right to the wire on that and
then suddenly we came back and maybe not

1688
01:35:44,251 --> 01:35:48,900
even, it wasn't even the political
will on that. It was just accident.

1689
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:52,050
If the Japanese hadn't bummed,
Paul Havo we wouldn't. You guys,

1690
01:35:52,051 --> 01:35:57,051
we wouldn't have had you guys in us
with us for a dealer to all that.

1691
01:35:57,480 --> 01:35:59,870
All the, the, the forces and the,

1692
01:35:59,871 --> 01:36:04,370
the money and the almonds and the tanks
and the shermans coming in. You know,

1693
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:07,530
we needed that coming in.
And without the Russian people,

1694
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,160
we wouldn't have won world war two and
that was, and they were in this agreement.

1695
01:36:11,610 --> 01:36:16,260
So I can't quite work out humanity. I do
think positive. I do think the negatives,

1696
01:36:16,261 --> 01:36:18,420
you can appreciate the positives.
I do think one thing on,

1697
01:36:18,930 --> 01:36:22,190
on the Brexit Brexit thing that's been
going on is a lot of young people are

1698
01:36:22,191 --> 01:36:24,090
coming on saying, well, so we're
going to lose all this stuff.

1699
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:27,450
The ability we could travel to Europe
without visas, we can work there,

1700
01:36:27,451 --> 01:36:30,310
we could retire there, we can get a
healthcare they're all costs have.

1701
01:36:30,330 --> 01:36:33,720
And that sort of thing that we cut off
and we are roaming charges are going to

1702
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:37,980
go out with the old that people
are valuing what they, uh,

1703
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:42,630
they could lose a lot more.
So yeah, the Yin and Yang,

1704
01:36:42,660 --> 01:36:47,650
the you can, I think, I think
it's gonna go on this way.
And also some people, ones,

1705
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:50,760
once we get to a good place, I've noticed
that a lot of people will say, okay,

1706
01:36:50,761 --> 01:36:52,990
I'm not going to be
politically active anymore.

1707
01:36:53,010 --> 01:36:54,240
I'm just going to carry on doing my life.

1708
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:57,720
Other people can sort of things that I've
noticed that people will get activated

1709
01:36:57,721 --> 01:36:59,010
to get to a result,

1710
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:02,550
maybe an election result or something
or referendum or whatever it is,

1711
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:05,890
and then they'll, they will just back
off. They get frustrated. They give up.

1712
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:07,350
I said, well, they just
think, well that's done.

1713
01:37:07,351 --> 01:37:10,230
That's bagged and in a positive
way maybe and just say,

1714
01:37:10,231 --> 01:37:12,450
but now I'm not even going to
pay attention to what's going on,

1715
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,640
but things will start
rolling backwards. So, um,

1716
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,420
I think we're going to keep
having it like that. Maybe the,

1717
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:22,470
but the percentage of positive
things to negative things,

1718
01:37:22,471 --> 01:37:26,560
there's never changed over all the years.
Over the last 10,000 years. It's just,

1719
01:37:26,561 --> 01:37:29,600
there's more people in the world doing
more positive things and doing well and

1720
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:30,434
negative things.

1721
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:33,030
Maybe humanity hasn't changed cause
our brain sizes haven't changed.

1722
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:35,220
Even back to the caveman days,
you know,

1723
01:37:35,221 --> 01:37:37,110
even back for the last
hundred thousand years,

1724
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:39,510
the size of our brains is not moved.
So we,

1725
01:37:39,780 --> 01:37:43,350
if you went back to seven 70,000 years
ago we would still be able to have

1726
01:37:43,351 --> 01:37:46,320
conversations like this even though we
wouldn't have the radios and things.

1727
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:48,030
It'd be more on our tribe.

1728
01:37:48,450 --> 01:37:50,910
I think I'll try B is better than you
were trying to say. Actually Steve,

1729
01:37:50,911 --> 01:37:52,620
I don't know if our tribe
is better than that tribe.

1730
01:37:52,621 --> 01:37:55,710
I just think similar than some good
people that drive in this shit has in that

1731
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,750
trial we need to maybe
trade with them mall.

1732
01:37:57,810 --> 01:38:00,960
We can go to war with them but then we
could die a lot of and surely could die.

1733
01:38:00,961 --> 01:38:04,030
And Kenny and Roger Number 22 you know,

1734
01:38:04,200 --> 01:38:07,560
cause those conversations were happening
in a slightly different way I think all

1735
01:38:07,561 --> 01:38:12,270
the way back and they weren't all
just getting me food. You Nice, good.

1736
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:16,530
Three, five years. It wasn't that. It was
maybe you know, millions of years ago,

1737
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:21,240
but not 700,000 years ago. And really
started speaking a hundred fantasies.

1738
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:26,230
What we've developed since
then. I'm fascinated by us
as human beings because we,

1739
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,700
we, uh, we were just another
animal and now we are,

1740
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:33,480
we are kind of amazing animal.
We've repented beautifully.

1741
01:38:33,481 --> 01:38:35,610
We landed on the bloody moon.
You guys landed on the moon,

1742
01:38:35,611 --> 01:38:39,510
which I as a child thought that we
landed on the moon. But in fact you guys,

1743
01:38:39,511 --> 01:38:42,510
I think that way, but they, Apollo
11, they kept it quite open.

1744
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:46,020
I think Michael Collins in the command
module said this is for the world and

1745
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:50,430
there was this kind of feeling and
Neil Armstrong is, it's a nice, yeah,

1746
01:38:50,670 --> 01:38:54,310
I grabbed hold of that as a
kid. I was growing up, you
know, a bit younger than me.

1747
01:38:54,750 --> 01:38:58,980
Pretty weird thing to think that we went
from not being able to talk to space

1748
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:02,580
travel in a hundred thousand years. I
mean, that's what they think, right?

1749
01:39:02,581 --> 01:39:06,540
They think that people didn't have real
language, 100,000 or Fox p two genetic.

1750
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:11,010
Um, I think it's about a hundred thousand
years ago. That's when it came down.

1751
01:39:11,310 --> 01:39:12,540
And the first words we said was,

1752
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:16,770
let's go to the moon in 100,000 what's
your name? Jack Kennedy. Okay, Jack.

1753
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:18,660
Good idea. But let's put it on
the back burner for a moment.

1754
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,240
What do you think happened
that turned us into this?

1755
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:22,980
Do you ever stop and think about that and,
well,

1756
01:39:22,981 --> 01:39:26,220
I don't think it's a bloke
upstairs floating in the
clouds because they used to

1757
01:39:26,221 --> 01:39:28,230
live in the clouds and then we flew
through the clouds and then whenever they

1758
01:39:28,231 --> 01:39:32,970
mentioned, hey, he's not in the cloud.
So I, it's, it's a randomize the thing,

1759
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:35,120
you know,
I think these like dinosaurs,

1760
01:39:35,130 --> 01:39:39,270
165 million years of those
bastards and all they did was eat,

1761
01:39:40,070 --> 01:39:44,910
uh, kill eight killed
pool and, and have sex.

1762
01:39:44,970 --> 01:39:47,730
That's all it is.
Those four things for 165 million years,

1763
01:39:47,731 --> 01:39:51,570
we've had 300 years since
the enlightenment of human
rights and democracy and

1764
01:39:51,571 --> 01:39:54,600
stuff like that. If we, if we say
the Great Greeks did a great thing,

1765
01:39:54,601 --> 01:39:57,600
but really it's the last 300 years
they had 165 million years of that.

1766
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:00,660
But why did they come along when we
had all these creatures in the sea?

1767
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:03,960
It's suddenly huge ones. Something
happened, something twisted,

1768
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,400
randomizing things. It's, I, we,

1769
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:10,890
we maybe we'll never know,

1770
01:40:10,950 --> 01:40:14,220
but it has happened and I just don't
think a bloke did it upstairs with a big

1771
01:40:14,221 --> 01:40:14,671
beard.
He said,

1772
01:40:14,671 --> 01:40:19,671
now is the time that you speak and now
you make handbags and now fight wars with

1773
01:40:20,940 --> 01:40:25,370
the MG 42 and now, now, you know,

1774
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,393
I just,

1775
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:31,760
I just think it happened and we need
to roll with it and try and make humans

1776
01:40:31,951 --> 01:40:35,190
work on this planet because then
we're going to be getting mouse soon.

1777
01:40:35,670 --> 01:40:36,630
And you could just say it the future,

1778
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:38,230
if we've got it going a mouse
at some point, the marshals,

1779
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,310
cause there we want to vote,
we've got our own marsh and government.

1780
01:40:41,311 --> 01:40:43,170
You sure you earthlings,

1781
01:40:43,171 --> 01:40:47,040
you know they're going to treat us the
same way Americans treat the British.

1782
01:40:47,490 --> 01:40:50,860
Marsha has come back and attack us.
The match is to actually come.

1783
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:53,940
And you could just see that in some sort
of, you know, a, did you turn the light?

1784
01:40:54,530 --> 01:40:58,500
Yeah, definitely happy. You know, so I,

1785
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:02,650
I despair about humanity
and I, and I, and I,

1786
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,970
I celebrate humanity. I do this thing
actually, which I think is nice.

1787
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:08,860
I'm going to say this, this
is not, because I'm obviously,

1788
01:41:08,861 --> 01:41:11,410
I'm doing a tour at the
moment here in the us,

1789
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:14,980
but I'm going to come out of this us
too on the 75th anniversary of d day and

1790
01:41:14,981 --> 01:41:18,760
like fly to call. And normally you're
doing a standup tour. Yeah. Big.

1791
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,270
It's up to the whole of America.
Are you doing any dates in la? Yeah,

1792
01:41:22,271 --> 01:41:26,560
I'm at the Dolby Theater on
the 26th and 29th of June.

1793
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:29,500
Okay. The Adobe, but was the Kodak.

1794
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:33,610
We don't want to come out from 26
or 20 Oh, I'll look at it later.

1795
01:41:35,050 --> 01:41:37,950
Yeah, it's all on that [inaudible]
dot com and but I go to,

1796
01:41:38,020 --> 01:41:41,740
I go to Normandy 75th
anniversary of d day and I do,

1797
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:44,140
and they fought the battle
of Normandy in German,

1798
01:41:44,260 --> 01:41:46,540
obviously on one side and then
French and English on the other side.

1799
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:50,260
And so I do three shows, Jerome
Fisher, 50 minutes in German.

1800
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:54,640
And then I do 50 minutes in English
and then 50 minutes in French.

1801
01:41:54,641 --> 01:41:58,060
And then we have a buffet and everyone
hangs out and wheat and I meet everyone

1802
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,120
and we all the German speakers,
the French and English speakers.

1803
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:06,970
That is incredible that you're doing
standup in multiple languages. Yeah.

1804
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:10,060
How long did it take you to
learn that? Well, I did school.

1805
01:42:10,090 --> 01:42:14,460
I did French at School for eight years.
I did Germans with for two years. So, um,

1806
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:17,350
it's put, it was partly a sort
of low level political thing.

1807
01:42:17,351 --> 01:42:20,830
I just thought if I'm an English guy
going to France and doing it in French,

1808
01:42:20,831 --> 01:42:23,590
then maybe a French cake go, well fuck
man, I'm going to do it in English.

1809
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:27,040
And now the Germans, the Russians
are doing English, the Spanish,

1810
01:42:27,041 --> 01:42:28,680
everyone's going to
English because you can do,

1811
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:32,740
you can have a Holly would
career potentially or be
on television and English.

1812
01:42:32,770 --> 01:42:36,240
Um, you can also tour the world in
English. Now you can use it as a,

1813
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:39,370
as a bridging language.
We were talking about Google translate.

1814
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,050
I know French kids, French
code, my friend. Yes.

1815
01:42:42,051 --> 01:42:46,330
Seen bellows has performed in Helsinki,
in Finland and finish.

1816
01:42:46,331 --> 01:42:48,040
Kids have been watching
in the second language,

1817
01:42:48,041 --> 01:42:50,860
they'd been watching in English and
listening in English and he's been

1818
01:42:50,861 --> 01:42:52,750
performing a French guide
performing in English.

1819
01:42:52,751 --> 01:42:57,250
So they met and laughed in
a second language, which I
think is an amazing thing.

1820
01:42:57,251 --> 01:43:01,630
But now you could tour the world
that way. So this is the, but anyway,

1821
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:05,660
so I'm going to get a dome and the,
and the, it's a commemoration of, uh,

1822
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:10,510
that the battle happened 75 years ago
and it's a celebration that now we don't

1823
01:43:10,511 --> 01:43:12,400
go to war in those
three languages anymore.

1824
01:43:12,490 --> 01:43:17,330
And you have different 50
minutes for French, different 50,

1825
01:43:17,340 --> 01:43:20,560
exactly the same uh, ideas. Uh,

1826
01:43:20,561 --> 01:43:24,340
but the words are all obviously either
German, French. I'll give you an example.

1827
01:43:24,341 --> 01:43:28,870
I had, um, I said, Caesar,
I told what Julia sees us,

1828
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:33,740
it sees it to be everything that one
day he would end up as a salad. Okay.

1829
01:43:33,850 --> 01:43:37,630
Cause he always wore like guys and he's
now and a French say's that escalate

1830
01:43:37,631 --> 01:43:41,380
Jamey imagination. He one day,
imagine [inaudible] on salad.

1831
01:43:41,710 --> 01:43:45,360
One day he would finish up as a salad
and German say's that had to Yeager.

1832
01:43:45,361 --> 01:43:50,361
Dax did he ever think [inaudible] he
one time as [inaudible] and inverter as

1833
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:54,050
salad end up would have.
So you've got the verb right at the end,

1834
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,240
but they still laugh at the same place.

1835
01:43:56,241 --> 01:44:00,950
But maybe about half second later split
second later as salad salad end up would

1836
01:44:00,951 --> 01:44:04,370
have. So you have to really have a deep
understanding of how to structure the

1837
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:07,940
sentences. It's just practice
really. You know, anything in life.

1838
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,540
You could do it. If you were taking
out of here, you, you speak, you did.

1839
01:44:11,550 --> 01:44:14,370
It's beginning.
So if they took you and,

1840
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:19,010
and suddenly for some reason you were
had to be in any of the cup. Thailand,

1841
01:44:19,011 --> 01:44:22,760
say say somebody dropped a big block of
heroin engineer. Think just as a test,

1842
01:44:22,820 --> 01:44:26,420
as a social experiment and they filled
this hole and use Hays is smuggling stuff.

1843
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:30,740
So you have to get a Thai prison. Uh,
this is kind of extreme example. Anyone.

1844
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:31,730
And then you'd,

1845
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:34,370
you'd be learning within one month
you'd have basic sentences going.

1846
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:37,760
Anyone who goes to prison is going
to have sure. Whether, you know,

1847
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:40,460
if you work in a restaurant and
you, any, anywhere you work with,

1848
01:44:40,461 --> 01:44:42,350
no one's giving you any English coming in.

1849
01:44:42,380 --> 01:44:45,770
You just have to pick up the words and
our survival instincts would pick them up

1850
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:50,750
and then you might have a strong
accent, but you, we, you me, everyone,

1851
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:52,290
we can pick it up. So I just, again,

1852
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:57,880
I can set up this artificial
scenario of I have to do this.

1853
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:01,220
So I had to learn French.
So I started before this show,

1854
01:45:01,221 --> 01:45:05,240
this Vonda Boshia which is German
table, um, meaning wonderful.

1855
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:09,740
And I started it in French. So I
jumped. I cause I improvised to work.

1856
01:45:09,770 --> 01:45:11,690
I don't write anything.
I just go on and go, hey,

1857
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:14,930
check is what's going on with chickens,
chickens, chicken with a gun. Dangerous.

1858
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,190
You don't write your act?
No,

1859
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:20,810
I just improvise it and I sort of workshop
it endlessly until it gets it. Oh,

1860
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:24,200
that's it. And then you
memorize it a, well, I know it
because I said it last time.

1861
01:45:24,260 --> 01:45:28,220
Correct. So in French I was just going,
they pull it, pull it. So don't Ya know,

1862
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:32,300
and pull a Donald Trump [inaudible]
shoes and compare things you record and

1863
01:45:32,301 --> 01:45:35,440
listen to every show and
never listened to them. Ah,

1864
01:45:35,530 --> 01:45:40,250
you record on your phone or do you know
we have a professional setup so with

1865
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,050
sometimes not with the laughter mixed in.

1866
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:45,350
I've just been listening back to the
German shows in Berlin and the laughter is

1867
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:50,600
very low in the mix. So I'm saying this
Jackson County, it's anyone laughing. Oh,

1868
01:45:50,601 --> 01:45:53,090
so it's just from the microphone.
Yeah, those are the feed there.

1869
01:45:53,091 --> 01:45:55,280
But they had another one but
they hadn't mix low. But yeah,

1870
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:58,310
you need to have a second microphone on
the audience and just bring that mix up

1871
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:01,730
or maybe bring it right up
so you're incredibly funny.

1872
01:46:01,790 --> 01:46:05,600
But I just found doing it in another
language, it's a positive thing.

1873
01:46:05,601 --> 01:46:08,270
It sends out a nice message.
His hands across the water.

1874
01:46:08,300 --> 01:46:11,030
Can we laugh and you can you do
them from us and the comedies.

1875
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:15,260
I do sort of Pythonesque Monty
python type surreal comedy.

1876
01:46:15,530 --> 01:46:19,040
And so I just need to find that audience
in France. That already is a journey.

1877
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:21,680
That audience in Thailand as the,
you know,

1878
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:26,060
I've played Kathmandu and met our kids
from Kathmandu in New York on the streets.

1879
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:29,670
He said that you immediately and I
said, yeah, where are you from? Uh,

1880
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:34,250
from Katmandu. Wow. Katmandu a kid
on Kathmandu. We didn't hit as well.

1881
01:46:34,251 --> 01:46:37,940
I doing, I'm a student, but your English
is good. Yeah, it's pretty good. Yeah.

1882
01:46:38,060 --> 01:46:40,940
Well can I do a Gig in
Katmandu do you think so? Yeah.

1883
01:46:40,941 --> 01:46:43,250
I think you do a King Kevin do that.
So I said okay.

1884
01:46:43,310 --> 01:46:47,810
That was in 2010 took me seven
years. I got the 2017. How was it?

1885
01:46:48,260 --> 01:46:49,950
It was good.
Unfortunately the local I

1886
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,160
Lester the low, cause they'd
had these couple of earthquakes,
which they, you know,

1887
01:46:53,161 --> 01:46:55,780
you tend to think, oh everyone
has earthquakes and, but no,

1888
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:59,460
they hadn't had them for ages and
something that had to a bad earthquake.

1889
01:46:59,461 --> 01:47:02,070
So they were getting over that.
So I was mainly aid workers.

1890
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:06,710
Unfortunately I wasn't
there. I can go back, but no,

1891
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:07,550
it was a nice setup.

1892
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:12,450
But I played all through embed
a in Tokyo and I played in uh,

1893
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:16,650
Hong Kong and in Shanghai
and had all the guys from,

1894
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:17,743
cause you have the,

1895
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,940
the people from the communist
party come along to check you out.

1896
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,850
So I'm not going specifically, you know,
certain things. But anyway, you know,

1897
01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,670
my stuff is all deliverable
from the comedy. What the
Communist Party, you know,

1898
01:47:29,671 --> 01:47:31,350
the Communist Party. Yeah. You know,

1899
01:47:31,490 --> 01:47:35,320
cause it's Shanghai mainland
China Hamadie party. No, sorry,

1900
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:39,200
sorry, sorry. Just me
mangling my words. Oh,

1901
01:47:39,201 --> 01:47:41,710
so they come and check you out to make
sure you're not violating anything. Yes.

1902
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:45,970
You sit sitting there is,
you're not supposed to go know
whatever. I Dunno. I just,

1903
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:48,930
I wanted to do the cake, so, but, but
it wasn't like I was going to change.

1904
01:47:49,290 --> 01:47:52,770
I have weird stuff about Gandalf
talking to butterflies and,

1905
01:47:53,160 --> 01:47:56,140
and talking about my ancient
kings like Henry the eighth and,

1906
01:47:56,740 --> 01:48:01,110
and William the conqueror and stuff. So
they probably, apparently they stayed,

1907
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:05,670
they stayed, they normally disappear
after a while. But anyway, so it's uh,

1908
01:48:05,700 --> 01:48:07,800
it's good to get out. And you
know, you said, as you said,

1909
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:11,430
play the world sees a week to see
it. Travel broadens the mind. Yeah.

1910
01:48:11,431 --> 01:48:15,990
I don't play very many play.
I played in Australia and England.

1911
01:48:16,020 --> 01:48:20,820
I've done gigs and Stockholm
and Northern Ireland, Dublin,

1912
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,530
a few other places in Europe,

1913
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,520
but most of the time when I go on vacation
I just go on vacation and just go to

1914
01:48:26,521 --> 01:48:29,760
experience it just to have fun.
So just to be there.

1915
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:34,560
So you've have you never
written Irak down? Um,

1916
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,470
no I couldn't.
I used to just sketch comedy like,

1917
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:42,540
like Monte Python thing and I wrote those
and then I was doing a street of for

1918
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:48,370
four years and that's very unwritten.
I no, that was very difficult to write.

1919
01:48:48,380 --> 01:48:50,400
So it's difficult to actually
develop material for that.

1920
01:48:50,670 --> 01:48:52,720
So I did that for four years. So
I got into this thing of, well,

1921
01:48:52,721 --> 01:48:56,350
I'll do performing. Like how,
so what would you do? Um, we,

1922
01:48:56,370 --> 01:48:57,450
we were double act initially.

1923
01:48:57,451 --> 01:49:02,451
Me and my partner rob and we did weird
things like escaping from a wooly jumper.

1924
01:49:02,581 --> 01:49:05,820
He just [inaudible] jump around.
I returned to a ski jumper.

1925
01:49:05,821 --> 01:49:10,050
Was that Willie Cardigan? We really pull
over. You've got to pull over. Okay. Yeah.

1926
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:14,100
I got a sweater. Yeah. Sweater. Yeah. So
instead of a straight jacket, he said,

1927
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:18,900
we take this Willie's sweat, take a
sweater. Just ridiculous. Ridiculous. Um,

1928
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,920
uh, making a bowl of cornflakes
disappear because you ate it. Yeah.

1929
01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:28,950
So at its best they go, this is
insane. These guys are crazy.

1930
01:49:29,180 --> 01:49:32,510
And they clap when they give us five
pins and what it was, it was, it go,

1931
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:35,370
these people are insane. This
is awful. And they walk away.

1932
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,050
Then we did sword fighting.

1933
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,870
That was good because I directed
three Musketeers University and uh,

1934
01:49:41,190 --> 01:49:42,030
so we were doing,

1935
01:49:42,031 --> 01:49:44,960
showing you how to kill someone when
drunk one thing when you do, you know,

1936
01:49:44,970 --> 01:49:48,070
all these different moves. So that was
quite fun. Then I went solo and I was

1937
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:52,270
doing escapology from chains and ropes
and then from a five foot unicycle from a

1938
01:49:52,271 --> 01:49:55,120
pair of manacles
escapology meaning escape.

1939
01:49:55,121 --> 01:49:57,970
Ology asks that all the other
thing is that, what's the apology?

1940
01:49:57,971 --> 01:50:00,150
You guys really call it that?
Yeah. What do you call it? Oh,

1941
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:03,100
I don't think it's a name for it. I
never even heard of that. I think it,

1942
01:50:03,101 --> 01:50:06,320
Google will tell us there is an escape.
Artists. I know there's escape artists.

1943
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:10,870
Does it exist?
What does it his word?

1944
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:13,060
There's a thing called a skip ology.

1945
01:50:13,061 --> 01:50:15,700
Live escape games were all escape
rooms and there's a bunch of them.

1946
01:50:15,701 --> 01:50:18,700
I don't know if it's the same thing as
escape room. No, those are escape rooms.

1947
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:23,540
Escapology should be a, a book. An art
form. It sounds like it's not really off.

1948
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:27,710
It's a craft. Well know Houdini
was an artist of that. I was uh,

1949
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:33,340
I was jumping crofting person is
practicing keeping from restraints.

1950
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:36,870
Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Steal
Books. She's battled his bag things.

1951
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:41,380
So I was just skyping from
ropes and chains and you
made a conscious decision to

1952
01:50:41,381 --> 01:50:44,320
do this like on the street.
Like this is how you're developing.

1953
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:47,440
That was developing because I couldn't
get my sketch comedy thing wasn't going.

1954
01:50:47,441 --> 01:50:50,620
I, there's a thing called the Edinburgh
festival. We have Scotland. Yeah.

1955
01:50:50,621 --> 01:50:54,010
You never that one. So I did 12 of those
in the ends right before I took her off.

1956
01:50:54,011 --> 01:50:58,240
So I did three doing sketch and
then about four doing street.

1957
01:50:58,510 --> 01:50:59,920
But on the street you have this freedom,

1958
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:02,350
know the freedom when things
have worked in a bit and,

1959
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:07,060
and it's really kind of feral.
No one's checking you up.

1960
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:12,040
No one knows what you're doing, you're
just on the street. I was useless at this.

1961
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:14,170
And then I developed a
confidence and gut confidence.

1962
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:16,900
You know that the stomach's
really important. It probably
isn't fighting as well.

1963
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:18,520
There's something that comes out of the,

1964
01:51:18,850 --> 01:51:22,450
there's a confidence center
in the stomach. Really? Yeah.

1965
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:24,880
There's something about the stomach
and you look into it with fighting.

1966
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,650
I think it's neurons, right? It's like
this is something, everything joins there.

1967
01:51:28,890 --> 01:51:30,670
There's something to do
with it. Anyway, I felt,

1968
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:34,090
I developed this confidence
on my own to go and stand on.

1969
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:35,560
If you've ever seen the film,

1970
01:51:35,561 --> 01:51:40,510
my fair lady or seen the film of Eliza
Doolittle bat is set on Covent garden.

1971
01:51:40,511 --> 01:51:43,830
It's a massive, massive square. Um,

1972
01:51:44,410 --> 01:51:48,130
Washington Square Park in New York was
the quick and straightforward in place.

1973
01:51:48,131 --> 01:51:52,150
So it's a big open place and I could
stand up that on my own and talk to no one

1974
01:51:52,180 --> 01:51:55,750
and build up an audience.
I would set out these tea cozies,

1975
01:51:55,751 --> 01:52:00,310
which are little animal tea, cozies
ducks and hamsters with weird things,

1976
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:03,540
things that just look like animals and
put them on the floor and people thought

1977
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:06,580
this guy's crazy and then let's start
talking and there'll be literally no one

1978
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:09,760
there sometimes and I take it afternoon,
I'm going to do a show.

1979
01:52:10,120 --> 01:52:12,880
Welcome to the invisible audience.
Very nice to have you here.

1980
01:52:12,881 --> 01:52:16,980
And I had this confidence if I just
kept talking a bit like you know in your

1981
01:52:17,190 --> 01:52:20,170
post here, you know you can keep
talking. I can and I go on. Yeah,

1982
01:52:20,171 --> 01:52:22,290
because of the odd,
some visible people here as well.

1983
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:26,440
This is Dan's Jack and Kenyans and I
would just go on and on until I built up

1984
01:52:26,441 --> 01:52:29,050
about 20 people. Then I could start
the show and then we get into it.

1985
01:52:29,350 --> 01:52:32,830
And if you're doing an escapology show,
in the end you're going to get out.

1986
01:52:32,920 --> 01:52:34,210
You've worked at how to get out.

1987
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:38,170
And so there will be a definite end and
then you can say, now don't go please,

1988
01:52:38,171 --> 01:52:41,250
can you give me some money?
So that's how I am my living.

1989
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:46,010
That's the Ninja training of performing
because I learned perform when people

1990
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:48,950
didn't even want to see me.
Cause normally they, they've cut,

1991
01:52:48,951 --> 01:52:51,470
they've come into a room and Lisa,
okay, who is this guy? Then I,

1992
01:52:51,471 --> 01:52:53,750
but we're in the room so
let's drink a beer and watch.

1993
01:52:54,020 --> 01:52:56,420
But if they're on the street, they don't
have to watch. They can just walk up.

1994
01:52:56,421 --> 01:53:00,270
And they often did. So
it was a tough, I had it,

1995
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:04,310
I lost all my confidence on the street.
In fact, I, in fact, I, there's a thing,

1996
01:53:04,370 --> 01:53:07,610
army does this, you know, break
you down and build you back up.

1997
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:11,370
The marines break you, then build you
back up. And they also in, in, in, uh,

1998
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:14,150
drama school, they break you down
and build, you buy this kind of idea.

1999
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:18,500
I accidentally broke myself down and
built myself back up on the streets of

2000
01:53:18,501 --> 01:53:22,820
London. So, wow. It's kind of beautiful.
That's why I was creatively born,

2001
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:27,860
uh, this new version that had this thing.
Okay, we're going to talk about chickens.

2002
01:53:28,160 --> 01:53:30,110
How many checkers it take to
change a light bulb? Well,

2003
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:32,240
quite a lot really because you know,
they can't,

2004
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:36,260
unless I had a friend with maybe a dog
has helped them or they could rig up

2005
01:53:36,261 --> 01:53:39,910
something. I just waffled on stuff.
And if it didn't hit a punchline,

2006
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:41,720
I didn't care. I just carried
on. It just kept going.

2007
01:53:41,721 --> 01:53:46,070
And then the confidence things kind of
gets you through. He just talks for hours.

2008
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:48,640
Um,
so if you release a special and you've,

2009
01:53:48,680 --> 01:53:50,830
you've released comedy specials before?
Yeah.

2010
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:54,050
How do you develop new material once
that special it's been released.

2011
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:56,210
I will do work in progress shows.

2012
01:53:56,240 --> 01:54:00,200
So which I took from Lily Tomlin who
did a lot of work in progress shares and

2013
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:03,050
then she did her show on Broadway I think.
And I thought,

2014
01:54:03,680 --> 01:54:07,490
cause I used to do the old tour and I
used to tutor to it until at the end we'd

2015
01:54:07,491 --> 01:54:10,960
film it and then I begin the next to
with the old tour and just keep that

2016
01:54:10,961 --> 01:54:13,910
improvising in the show cause
at any improvise on stage.

2017
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:16,670
And I would build up by the end of
the next two will be a different show.

2018
01:54:16,970 --> 01:54:20,060
But that didn't seem to work for people
because they said we want to completely

2019
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:24,500
new show. So now I do this WIP
shows, work in progress shows. Um,

2020
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:29,150
and I will go on stage and muck about
just talking about chickens or banners or

2021
01:54:29,700 --> 01:54:31,820
do you have a structure when you start,

2022
01:54:31,821 --> 01:54:35,660
like say if it's the day
after your specials done and
now you have to work on a

2023
01:54:35,661 --> 01:54:38,750
whole new special, you're doing a
work in progress show first. Do you,

2024
01:54:38,840 --> 01:54:42,110
how do you develop? We start with my life.
I did it once where I just said, okay,

2025
01:54:42,111 --> 01:54:45,180
let's go through my life. And so
when I was a, you may not know this,

2026
01:54:45,181 --> 01:54:47,930
but you know I went to, I was living in
Northern Ireland. They were born in Yemen,

2027
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:50,930
I would go through,
so I've done this troll through my life,

2028
01:54:51,380 --> 01:54:53,720
I need some sort of structure,
otherwise I'm stuck.

2029
01:54:53,930 --> 01:54:57,440
I also found that once
I had recorded the show,

2030
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:00,050
like I lost tour force measure.

2031
01:55:00,051 --> 01:55:03,050
I toured for five years because I just
found there were no rules and touring,

2032
01:55:03,051 --> 01:55:07,130
I could just keep going back and I did
45 countries so I can just keep on going.

2033
01:55:07,630 --> 01:55:08,550
And uh,

2034
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:11,960
and I found those certain things I'd
developed after we'd recorded it that were

2035
01:55:11,961 --> 01:55:14,960
interesting and worth keeping. So I said,
okay, well that's not in the old show.

2036
01:55:14,961 --> 01:55:18,230
I'm going to pull that and start off
the new show with that little bit,

2037
01:55:18,231 --> 01:55:23,030
which is that little piece of
material which is fun about. Um,

2038
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:27,160
and I was trading on a marathon than dog
dogs will woofing at me. Uh, you know,

2039
01:55:27,170 --> 01:55:30,620
I ran past the house where a dog was
woofing at me and this is in the show now.

2040
01:55:30,621 --> 01:55:32,270
And I suddenly thought
for the first time ever,

2041
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:36,530
because dogs have swift to people
all the beginning of time, I thought,

2042
01:55:36,531 --> 01:55:37,940
what is the dog actually trying to say?

2043
01:55:37,940 --> 01:55:42,940
If the dog had Fox p two injected into
him so he could suddenly took what would

2044
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:47,650
say to me, what is that Wolf Wolf? Well,
what does that mean? And so it goes into,

2045
01:55:48,210 --> 01:55:52,150
he's basically saying assassins assassins.
I here,

2046
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:56,340
I know I'm a dog. It's my job. Get a gun.

2047
01:55:57,460 --> 01:55:58,740
Because all dogs are very sure.

2048
01:55:58,741 --> 01:56:02,330
You've never heard of an unsure
Joel dragging your life barking.

2049
01:56:02,350 --> 01:56:04,800
They're sure they are absolutely
sure that it's assassins.

2050
01:56:04,830 --> 01:56:09,830
It's not a postman is not the guy with
a hamster outside assassins are here.

2051
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:12,900
Alarm alarm,
danger will Robinson.

2052
01:56:14,070 --> 01:56:16,950
Why have you never written anything down?
Um,

2053
01:56:16,980 --> 01:56:19,310
well I found initially I started
to run the right stand up,

2054
01:56:19,710 --> 01:56:23,190
but I would go and I was
trying to type it or write it.

2055
01:56:23,191 --> 01:56:28,110
So if you go in to a soup,
uh, my, I'm very sorry.

2056
01:56:28,120 --> 01:56:28,681
I'm dyslexic,

2057
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:33,681
so I'm the supermarket and there
that I just thought I couldn't,

2058
01:56:35,910 --> 01:56:40,340
I couldn't write. I seem to be
foster. If I was just ad libbing it.

2059
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:43,570
So you got a supermarket in this guy
there and you know, and the shorts,

2060
01:56:43,580 --> 01:56:45,630
fruit you go in and this fruit,
fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit, fruit.

2061
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:49,650
And I found that if I just
did it by finding it with
the words and there's fruit

2062
01:56:49,651 --> 01:56:51,860
and some fruit and you supposed
to squeeze it, aren't you?

2063
01:56:51,870 --> 01:56:53,970
And so I just think all the
things I could think about fruit.

2064
01:56:54,240 --> 01:56:55,860
So why is it fruit there?
Why not toilet paper?

2065
01:56:55,861 --> 01:56:58,290
You never go to the supermarket and
toilet paper in there because they'd say,

2066
01:56:58,291 --> 01:57:00,870
well that's a poo shot. You know,
you have to go in as a fresh up.

2067
01:57:01,050 --> 01:57:03,660
We've got fresh fruit here.
So we are very fresh. Okay?

2068
01:57:03,661 --> 01:57:06,600
That's why the fruit fruits right up
front and you've got to squeeze it.

2069
01:57:06,601 --> 01:57:09,770
But how much do you squeeze it and how
do you know it's at the right pressure?

2070
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:12,450
Squeeze it and what if it explodes?
So I would just keep chatting.

2071
01:57:12,451 --> 01:57:16,320
If it didn't work, you just move
on. And that's how I developed,

2072
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:20,490
uh,
this very conversational star that I have,

2073
01:57:20,491 --> 01:57:25,110
which people say it's supposed to be
improvisation. It's nice. It's just, um,

2074
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:28,530
I am, I'm always ready to improvise
at any point. Some people,

2075
01:57:28,540 --> 01:57:30,000
if you write a thing, you say, well,

2076
01:57:30,001 --> 01:57:34,560
that is how that piece goes and it's
locked in. But if you improvise a thing,

2077
01:57:34,561 --> 01:57:36,810
I've noticed, I came up with
this thing of molten material.

2078
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,600
When you first create a new
idea and it's it, it's working,

2079
01:57:39,900 --> 01:57:42,570
it's very open and live like quicksilver,
like mercury.

2080
01:57:42,571 --> 01:57:44,670
And then you can add another bit
and another bit, another bit,

2081
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:47,010
and you can have a bit,
once you put it into shape,

2082
01:57:47,011 --> 01:57:49,680
then it becomes locked down and it
becomes like a prayer and you can lose the

2083
01:57:49,681 --> 01:57:54,330
joy of it. It becomes a
recitation. And I thought,

2084
01:57:54,331 --> 01:57:56,670
so don't ever have it locked down.
Keep it open,

2085
01:57:57,210 --> 01:58:00,870
keep it always loose so that every
time you say you're saying it a bit

2086
01:58:00,871 --> 01:58:03,870
differently,
and that's the style of developed.

2087
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:08,100
And so I can improvise
at any point in the show.

2088
01:58:08,130 --> 01:58:11,460
I can just stop it and go, what
are wolves? Why have we got walls,

2089
01:58:12,270 --> 01:58:13,710
walls and other people don't,
you know,

2090
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:17,340
most animals in the world doesn't have
walls, but we've got walls in that. Good.

2091
01:58:17,850 --> 01:58:21,420
How's it, you know, when it's raining,
they don't have bulls. They were okay.

2092
01:58:21,450 --> 01:58:24,020
Should we have, you know, I just
waffled about walls, isn't it? Okay.

2093
01:58:24,180 --> 01:58:27,150
Don't talk about walls.
And I've ever gangs also.

2094
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:30,060
So if I don't get anything out of it,
I get jokes on the way out.

2095
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,640
I get laughs on the way out. So if
I'm, if I don't get in the way in,

2096
01:58:32,641 --> 01:58:35,390
so that's the technique I've developed.
Now when you say dyslexics,

2097
01:58:35,391 --> 01:58:38,310
so if you read something, what
do you see? I really, I see it,

2098
01:58:38,311 --> 01:58:42,490
but I get word blindness. We're at
blindness. I just see other words,

2099
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:45,580
long words. I, I couldn't
wrap to my license.

2100
01:58:45,581 --> 01:58:49,180
Took me ages to say let alone to spell.

2101
01:58:49,990 --> 01:58:53,590
Um,
I just find that I s I sub vocalize.

2102
01:58:53,620 --> 01:58:56,910
So in my head I'm going to ask God,

2103
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,210
what are you doing here? I will almost
say there. And you know when your kids,

2104
01:59:01,211 --> 01:59:03,760
they actually read it out loud
and I'm not reading out loud,

2105
01:59:03,761 --> 01:59:07,000
but I'm saying it in my head and other
people that they can do a page, you know,

2106
01:59:07,001 --> 01:59:09,670
they do this speed reading and they just,
you shouldn't,

2107
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:13,870
shouldn't and they could just take it
whole pages. It's stunning. I can't,

2108
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:16,690
I don't understand that
either. That's, that's tricky.

2109
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:20,820
So my spelling was Kat with a k ceiling
with an FCA, logical spelling. Um,

2110
01:59:21,260 --> 01:59:24,790
my writing is all over the place, bigger
letters, smaller letters, bigger letters.

2111
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:28,810
Um, and they tested me and they said
I'm severely eight to two, eight,

2112
01:59:28,820 --> 01:59:31,390
typically dyslexic.
So I,

2113
01:59:31,391 --> 01:59:33,910
I have a huge mental map memory.

2114
01:59:33,911 --> 01:59:36,070
I can hold a lot of things
in the memory in my head.

2115
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,500
So that's just sort of a
permanent distinction like you do,

2116
01:59:38,530 --> 01:59:41,080
this is just who you are. There's
no way to fix that, it seems.

2117
01:59:41,081 --> 01:59:44,710
So I haven't heard of anyone
coming out of dyslexia and saying,

2118
01:59:44,711 --> 01:59:49,000
now I can read much faster. Now I can do
things. I just think it stuck with that.

2119
01:59:49,090 --> 01:59:50,890
But it's a,
it means you think sideways.

2120
01:59:50,891 --> 01:59:55,160
And I think a lot of creative people
with dyslexia, I think sideways. Yeah.

2121
01:59:55,330 --> 01:59:58,210
So you see clouds,
you see a line in the clouds,

2122
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:03,440
you see puff, there's a train going
through the sky, you know, um,

2123
02:00:04,210 --> 02:00:08,590
it's, it's a creative thing.
Juxtaposing things on your wall.

2124
02:00:08,591 --> 02:00:11,870
You have to juxtapose the thing, which
is they don't lead from one to the other.

2125
02:00:11,871 --> 02:00:15,640
That could be fighting right against it
all. Completely bonkers or out of it.

2126
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:19,480
I'm just looking at here in the room, you
know, and, and linking things together.

2127
02:00:19,481 --> 02:00:23,170
I think creativity, we're trying
always trying to throw ourselves,

2128
02:00:23,171 --> 02:00:27,370
but in comedy by something that's
weird and opposite and funny.

2129
02:00:27,910 --> 02:00:30,310
Um, Caesar, you should, you know,

2130
02:00:30,370 --> 02:00:33,340
I'm going for the salad line when I said
that sees a deal. I think it's solid.

2131
02:00:33,850 --> 02:00:36,040
And then people seems to
make people Africa, I, yeah,

2132
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:39,040
Caesar Salad and this guy was,
he murdered really?

2133
02:00:39,041 --> 02:00:41,140
Where did the million goal if people,
you know,

2134
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:45,640
and he ends up as a salad is not a cognac.
Napoleon gets a cognac brandy,

2135
02:00:46,030 --> 02:00:50,050
but he's a Samad. What's
that about? So, um, yeah,

2136
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:51,880
this is my dyslexic traits,

2137
02:00:51,881 --> 02:00:54,340
but I think you get dealt
these cards when you're born,

2138
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:58,110
whatever genetic cards they are.
And the,

2139
02:00:59,020 --> 02:01:03,040
the art of life is to play
your cards as well as you can.

2140
02:01:03,460 --> 02:01:07,930
And the art of comedy is to relay
your life in a humorous way very much.

2141
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:10,630
And that's your unique
fingerprint as you know, if,

2142
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:13,930
if we all have experienced say,
well I seem like another comedian,

2143
02:01:13,931 --> 02:01:16,210
we'll talk about your own
life and your own perspective.

2144
02:01:16,450 --> 02:01:19,870
It's got three different to
the next person. It's because
no two people the same.

2145
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:23,090
Is that what you enjoyed the
most or the standard? Uh,

2146
02:01:23,170 --> 02:01:26,590
no dramatic films I probably enjoy the
most because I wanted to do that when I

2147
02:01:26,591 --> 02:01:30,250
was a kid, I discovered that films
existed. I broke into Pinewood Studios,

2148
02:01:30,251 --> 02:01:34,180
one of our big studios when
I was 15 broken. Yeah. Like,

2149
02:01:34,300 --> 02:01:38,260
like illegally. Yeah.
Yeah. Got It. Yeah. Well I,

2150
02:01:38,740 --> 02:01:41,870
I was watching a film battle of Britain
and at the end it says filmed on

2151
02:01:41,871 --> 02:01:45,830
location in,
in Spain and England at Pinewood Studios.

2152
02:01:45,830 --> 02:01:50,090
I've a heath bucks and I was in the 70s
and then remember we didn't have videos,

2153
02:01:50,091 --> 02:01:52,430
we couldn't freeze things.
So he's just a scribble things down.

2154
02:01:52,431 --> 02:01:55,340
So I was scribbling down stuff
off the end of films and I said,

2155
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:59,330
I promise I have a youth pastor, I've a
heath, what is that? But it was a bucks.

2156
02:01:59,331 --> 02:02:00,890
Okay, bucks is short for Buckingham. Sure.

2157
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:04,640
That's a place I have a heath must be
a town. It's a weird name, town, city,

2158
02:02:04,940 --> 02:02:08,510
village. There must be a village or town.
So I got a map of the United Kingdom,

2159
02:02:08,511 --> 02:02:12,350
which had alphabetically every
town and village and city,

2160
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:17,000
they're going listed alphabetically. And
I went all the way down and the, okay,

2161
02:02:17,001 --> 02:02:18,730
that's where it is.
So I took a train from my,

2162
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:23,230
the south coast of England up to London
tube train underground train that to

2163
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:27,140
place called [inaudible] on a bus to
this, this roundabout. And I got off,

2164
02:02:27,141 --> 02:02:30,980
I said Pinewood Studios, they said
it's about half a mile down that road.

2165
02:02:30,981 --> 02:02:34,550
So I marched down the road and I got to
the big gabled entrance where all the

2166
02:02:34,551 --> 02:02:35,600
big stars would come in.

2167
02:02:35,930 --> 02:02:38,090
And they went up and they
haven't got this bit worked out.

2168
02:02:38,120 --> 02:02:41,380
So her went up and I said, um, I'm gonna,

2169
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:45,620
I'm going to be in films.
Could I come in please?

2170
02:02:47,410 --> 02:02:51,160
Which one I'm going to, I'm going to
make, I got to, I want to be an that.

2171
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:54,980
Can I come in?
I just want to do is piss off kid.

2172
02:02:55,240 --> 02:02:59,840
Just I need just told me to piss off.
And I thought, no, I've come miles.

2173
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:03,860
This is a big,
so I thought the must be another way in.

2174
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:06,080
So I went up and there was
another entrance that was near it,

2175
02:03:06,081 --> 02:03:08,660
but it wasn't the main star enters.
It was just the,

2176
02:03:09,050 --> 02:03:13,010
they're kind of more Laurie engines, the
truck entrance, the bringing stuff in.

2177
02:03:13,190 --> 02:03:14,420
And I saw people going into that.

2178
02:03:14,421 --> 02:03:18,630
There was a drawbridge a bit like
where eagles dare the film anyway,

2179
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:22,430
someone on the gate and some people was
showing them passes and stuff and other

2180
02:03:22,431 --> 02:03:24,320
people just walking
in. So I thought, okay,

2181
02:03:24,321 --> 02:03:25,760
you've got to have the
confidence to walk in.

2182
02:03:25,761 --> 02:03:30,761
So I did the 16 1516 year old confidence
and I just marched in and suddenly I

2183
02:03:32,721 --> 02:03:34,190
was thrown and I was in,
I was into Bible study.

2184
02:03:35,130 --> 02:03:39,260
So then in a spill or broken the
universal, I broke into, into thing,

2185
02:03:39,261 --> 02:03:41,120
he got a career going pretty immediately.

2186
02:03:41,450 --> 02:03:46,190
I didn't get nothing goes well
you're 15 and I know his well it was,

2187
02:03:46,191 --> 02:03:49,490
you expect what's going to happen. What
was your anticipation? Anticipation was,

2188
02:03:50,300 --> 02:03:53,290
as I've said in a piece of
standard that I, cause I,

2189
02:03:53,720 --> 02:03:56,630
I had to walk at a certain speed.
If you're moving a certain speed,

2190
02:03:56,631 --> 02:04:01,620
I thought no one's going to stop you so
you can't creep around looking. Was this,

2191
02:04:01,670 --> 02:04:03,620
cause they said, what are you doing
here? You know, I just thought,

2192
02:04:03,621 --> 02:04:07,040
in fact it's kind of loose inside studios
and no one really knows what everyone

2193
02:04:07,041 --> 02:04:10,130
else is doing,
so you can actually creep around it a bit.

2194
02:04:10,340 --> 02:04:12,620
But I will run a certain
speed and I sort of March.

2195
02:04:12,621 --> 02:04:16,820
So I was marching down streets
in Arles and past studios and,

2196
02:04:17,160 --> 02:04:21,550
and I was hoping somebody
go, hey, you kid. Yeah. Uh,

2197
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:23,810
we, you your marching around. Yeah,

2198
02:04:23,811 --> 02:04:26,210
we're doing the film called
the marching around kids.

2199
02:04:26,710 --> 02:04:31,520
Our lead kid has just exploded.
Can you continue my, yeah,
I could watch your aunt.

2200
02:04:31,580 --> 02:04:35,650
Can you say words could string a few
words together. Right? How do you relieve,

2201
02:04:36,140 --> 02:04:40,200
I marched down to same,
I must say we're done here.

2202
02:04:40,230 --> 02:04:44,040
I marched around for two
hours and I marched that and
I've since filled twice or

2203
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:47,280
three times in plywood and they
ain't going to, I want to do.

2204
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:49,890
And whenever you tell him, I go back
and I'm actually filming that guy.

2205
02:04:50,330 --> 02:04:51,440
I broke him. Yeah. This is what,

2206
02:04:51,740 --> 02:04:56,340
and I just walk at very slow speeds down
streets knowing that anyone could stop

2207
02:04:56,341 --> 02:05:01,140
me and I'll go, I'm just filming
around the company. It's, yeah, it's,

2208
02:05:01,141 --> 02:05:04,050
um, so I love films and I've
just finished my first film,

2209
02:05:04,051 --> 02:05:07,770
six minutes to midnight that I've co
written and produced it. And what does it,

2210
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,960
um,
it's a set in a,

2211
02:05:11,730 --> 02:05:13,660
just for the beginning of world war two,
the w I,

2212
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:17,640
I grew up this little seaside town like
America has seaside town as well as well

2213
02:05:17,641 --> 02:05:20,850
for the old days when people used to go
to seaside towns before they went to the

2214
02:05:20,851 --> 02:05:24,810
hot countries and Quebec Ceylon season,
the Hastings,

2215
02:05:24,811 --> 02:05:29,811
Brighton and the south coast of Maine
and the 26 schools there for some reason,

2216
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:32,550
26 schools,
it was linked up.

2217
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:35,130
There was an Earl Delaware that
it's set the place up anyway,

2218
02:05:35,131 --> 02:05:39,450
one of these things new.
And one of them had young girls,

2219
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:44,430
a German girls who are linked to the
Nazi high command and they were over to

2220
02:05:44,431 --> 02:05:46,830
learn English and make
friends and be ambassadors.

2221
02:05:46,831 --> 02:05:50,940
And because there was obviously fascism
in Germany and then we'll fascist in

2222
02:05:50,941 --> 02:05:53,100
Britain and they were making friends and,

2223
02:05:53,570 --> 02:05:55,290
and that was the idea
there was going to be,

2224
02:05:55,350 --> 02:05:58,830
Hitler had this idea of linking that
with British and taking everyone on and

2225
02:05:59,560 --> 02:06:02,550
which some people in Britain were
forwards and obviously a lot of us were

2226
02:06:02,551 --> 02:06:03,840
against. And, uh,

2227
02:06:04,060 --> 02:06:08,730
it sat around this girls school and I
was showing the badge, the blazer badge,

2228
02:06:08,731 --> 02:06:12,960
or the girls had a blazer and blue blazer
and I had a badge and it has the name

2229
02:06:12,961 --> 02:06:17,520
of the school or Augusta Victoria
College Bexhill on sea. And that the top,

2230
02:06:17,521 --> 02:06:22,050
it has a British flag and then the Nazi
swastika next to it. And I thought,

2231
02:06:22,051 --> 02:06:23,310
holy cow,

2232
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:27,470
I've just never seen those two flags right
next to each other in the same badge.

2233
02:06:27,471 --> 02:06:31,320
So I thought there's a film in
that. So we've made a film. Wow.

2234
02:06:31,650 --> 02:06:35,040
Judy Dench is in it. Jim Broadbent,
both Oscar winners and myself.

2235
02:06:35,100 --> 02:06:36,480
And what would that be released?
Uh,

2236
02:06:36,481 --> 02:06:41,430
rolling it out from the end of this
year from a full, as you call it,

2237
02:06:41,460 --> 02:06:42,540
autumn form with you.

2238
02:06:42,600 --> 02:06:47,460
So your love of acting and creating films,
that's,

2239
02:06:47,490 --> 02:06:49,740
that's your primary.
Even Trump stand up.

2240
02:06:49,770 --> 02:06:53,280
I do love stand up and I could do stuff
on whenever I worried that trumped is

2241
02:06:53,281 --> 02:06:57,000
still word. I know. Isn't it
weird? It's a weird, that must,

2242
02:06:57,240 --> 02:06:59,430
he must love that that word exists.

2243
02:06:59,670 --> 02:07:04,310
That Trump actually means to one up and
better. I'm not even going to go there.

2244
02:07:04,340 --> 02:07:07,380
It's crazy, right? Yeah. It
also means making tricks.

2245
02:07:07,381 --> 02:07:10,320
You Trump things and you can make tricks.
Oh really? Yeah. I didn't know that.

2246
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:14,100
We have tricks and cards. And how many
trips have you gone? That was tricky.

2247
02:07:14,101 --> 02:07:15,500
Dicky Nixon.
So that's uh,

2248
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:20,180
another person who did one or two
lies and untruth down his, yeah,

2249
02:07:20,190 --> 02:07:24,780
he was also a bad guy.
So, uh, anyway, yes, it's,

2250
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:27,780
I love, I do love stand up. I was
never planning to be a stand up.

2251
02:07:27,781 --> 02:07:29,490
I was going to be a sketch
comedian comedy. Well,

2252
02:07:29,491 --> 02:07:33,330
I was going to be an actor and then I
thought I can't do it. My teenage years,

2253
02:07:33,331 --> 02:07:35,100
I had no sexual self confidence.

2254
02:07:35,410 --> 02:07:37,780
The transgender thing didn't
play a part in there. I just,

2255
02:07:38,440 --> 02:07:41,230
I was playing football to soccer
up until 13, so I was kind of, Hey,

2256
02:07:41,231 --> 02:07:44,650
I'm going to run a back guy. I'm
kind of fast athletics, whatever.

2257
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:48,580
Then I go to a school, I'm nothing and
there's no girls here and I can't do this.

2258
02:07:48,581 --> 02:07:50,650
And the oil bodies changing all that.

2259
02:07:50,890 --> 02:07:53,450
And I just lost all my confidence
and I just thought I can't.

2260
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:56,470
And I was quite small.
So at school it was all about tall kids.

2261
02:07:56,471 --> 02:07:58,510
You played at the renowned romantic lead,
small kids,

2262
02:07:58,511 --> 02:08:02,920
you're the slave or the
servant. So I thought, okay,
forget this, I'll do comedy.

2263
02:08:02,921 --> 02:08:06,070
I do the comedy because I love the comedy.
And Monte Python discovered them.

2264
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:10,150
I thought, okay, I'll do the
darling. I love you. You're
made out of cheese. I have,

2265
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:14,560
my knees are on fire with this. I just
make it rubbish. And I thought, okay,

2266
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:17,780
that's easier. So I did that
and they wouldn't take off
my career, just wouldn't,

2267
02:08:17,781 --> 02:08:20,680
you know, left school, dropped out
of university, couldn't get it going.

2268
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:23,350
And by the time he got going
when I was about 30, I thought,

2269
02:08:23,770 --> 02:08:27,550
I'm not going to hold onto this comedy
and start doing drum at the same time.

2270
02:08:27,551 --> 02:08:32,190
So I've run these parallel things
and I'm going to be on Broadway. Um,

2271
02:08:32,830 --> 02:08:37,360
uh, the beginning of the next year. Who's
afraid of Virginia Woolf? Laurie Metcalf.

2272
02:08:37,570 --> 02:08:41,450
Oh Wow. Scott Rudin production.
So, oh, interesting. That
was the same movie. Yeah.

2273
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:43,120
Great movie.
As I say,

2274
02:08:43,121 --> 02:08:48,100
I'm doing who's afraid of Elizabeth Taylor
and I'm playing Richard Burton and um,

2275
02:08:48,370 --> 02:08:50,440
yeah, that, so that's an
amazing production, you know,

2276
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:54,040
performing with Judi Dench and films and
Stephen Frears Film Victoria and Abdul.

2277
02:08:54,400 --> 02:08:57,910
Um, so I'm getting great drama roles
now. I've pushed a long time to do that.

2278
02:08:57,911 --> 02:09:00,340
But normally if you do comedy, they
won't let you do drive. You did drama,

2279
02:09:00,341 --> 02:09:02,760
you don't review committee. It's
sort of breaking down though. Right?

2280
02:09:03,010 --> 02:09:07,630
Steve Carell's, Steve [inaudible], he
has, he has moved to if he, if he does,

2281
02:09:07,660 --> 02:09:09,180
I'm not sure if he's doing the
companies too much anymore,

2282
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:10,750
but exactly where Steve Kraus gone.

2283
02:09:11,470 --> 02:09:15,400
John Lithgow also say he was someone
who was visually dramatic career,

2284
02:09:15,401 --> 02:09:17,430
but then you did federal for the sandwich.
You beautiful.

2285
02:09:17,620 --> 02:09:21,540
And he was nominated every year and won
two Emmy's and no one had six times.

2286
02:09:21,550 --> 02:09:25,630
Just fantastic word. Yeah, I was on
news radio at the same time I was out.

2287
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:30,730
So we're in the same network, right?
Yeah. His stuff was great. Yeah,

2288
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:33,280
it's great actor. I stunning. You know,

2289
02:09:33,281 --> 02:09:38,110
you played them Churchill in the crown
with the Churchill of darker side of

2290
02:09:38,111 --> 02:09:40,000
church or that people don't know about,
which I knew,

2291
02:09:40,240 --> 02:09:45,160
well here's a guy that really has a, a
love of theater, a love of performing.

2292
02:09:45,161 --> 02:09:46,870
When when he talks about
it you could see like,

2293
02:09:46,871 --> 02:09:50,400
cause it's goosebumps raise and you just,
you could see his,

2294
02:09:51,010 --> 02:09:54,250
he gets excited. Yes, I
can absolutely feel that.

2295
02:09:54,251 --> 02:09:57,520
I mean he played such a range of Kate,
if you just playing evil,

2296
02:09:57,521 --> 02:10:01,770
you just think this guy is so evil
when he's playing the character in,

2297
02:10:02,280 --> 02:10:06,460
uh, in the federal for the sun, um,

2298
02:10:06,610 --> 02:10:08,680
it's just a beautiful,
I watched it and you can't really,

2299
02:10:08,860 --> 02:10:11,140
for some reason you can't.
I couldn't download it in Britain,

2300
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:13,870
but I found a place I could find it.
So I'm on a second.

2301
02:10:13,871 --> 02:10:16,780
I've watched every single episode and
now going through the second time.

2302
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:21,760
So it's just beautiful stuff.
So when you're,

2303
02:10:22,030 --> 02:10:25,510
you got into standup comedy.
When you first started doing that,

2304
02:10:25,540 --> 02:10:27,420
what is the scene like in England?

2305
02:10:27,590 --> 02:10:31,480
It was there comedy clubs where you
could go to an open mic night. We were,

2306
02:10:31,481 --> 02:10:34,010
how do you,
we were copying you guys.

2307
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:38,570
I think Lenny Bruce set up the
more alternative version cause it,

2308
02:10:38,571 --> 02:10:41,400
but I still think in America it's,
it's always stayed kind of mainstream.

2309
02:10:41,470 --> 02:10:44,210
But Lenny Bruce was definitely
doing alternative and then
she got a lot of Lenny.

2310
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:45,510
I love that guy.
But yeah,

2311
02:10:45,930 --> 02:10:48,980
and I play them on stage and
that was a wonderful thing.

2312
02:10:48,981 --> 02:10:53,270
What did you play him in Lenny?
He know the film was from a stage play.

2313
02:10:53,271 --> 02:10:58,100
Dustin Hoffman Film. That was a stage
play. Dustin Hoffman was fantastic.

2314
02:10:58,640 --> 02:10:59,870
He was so close.

2315
02:11:00,140 --> 02:11:04,580
And the guy who plays him in the
marvelous Mrs Maizel is very good as well.

2316
02:11:04,610 --> 02:11:07,730
I know. That's very interesting, isn't it?
Because I'm watching that. I'm thinking,

2317
02:11:08,120 --> 02:11:10,760
okay, now I've, I've gone
through the clubs myself,

2318
02:11:10,761 --> 02:11:15,761
but I did mine in the eighties into
the nineties and that's in the 50s wow.

2319
02:11:16,510 --> 02:11:19,290
And I sort of take myself there and
then there's Lenny, then I think he,

2320
02:11:19,610 --> 02:11:23,500
I know Lenny and I play
them. I used to diet. Oh God,

2321
02:11:23,510 --> 02:11:27,740
that's me looking at that. But
I was, I was doing the standup,

2322
02:11:27,741 --> 02:11:32,090
I w I see that, I put
that together. That was,

2323
02:11:32,100 --> 02:11:36,350
and I called him to Jesus crisis
of comedy because as a Jewish guy,

2324
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:41,380
he died for us to die for us to
give us the freedom of speech.

2325
02:11:42,380 --> 02:11:46,670
He died for freedom of speech because in
the end that will go heroin too. I know,

2326
02:11:46,671 --> 02:11:48,770
but the mixture together,
he shouldn't have completely the two.

2327
02:11:49,410 --> 02:11:52,640
He made sure that we could say
what we wanted to understand.

2328
02:11:52,940 --> 02:11:55,250
The missus Maizel things
makes it a little,

2329
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:00,710
it's a little homogenized like him,
like in even his struggle.

2330
02:12:00,711 --> 02:12:03,760
It's almost like it's no big deal.
Are you in the latest season? Is it,

2331
02:12:04,260 --> 02:12:07,070
is it three or two?
Three hasn't released yet.

2332
02:12:07,071 --> 02:12:10,910
They're filming it right now through both
of them. It's really good. Really. It's,

2333
02:12:10,911 --> 02:12:14,150
it's not accurate.
Like historically it's way off the mark.

2334
02:12:14,151 --> 02:12:17,000
There's no woman who's talking like that.
Back then it wasn't,

2335
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:21,950
there was no mrs main song.
I really liked it. And uh,

2336
02:12:22,490 --> 02:12:27,290
it's interesting sheet. Yeah. Like
norm McDonald got mad about it.

2337
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:30,290
He's like, Hey, I was, there was
no woman like that back then.

2338
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:32,570
They would say that she, there's no,
it doesn't, I mean, can we give it to,

2339
02:12:32,571 --> 02:12:34,610
if it's a fucking show man,
the hawks, not really either.

2340
02:12:34,720 --> 02:12:37,130
There's no guy will becomes the hawk now.
I enjoy it.

2341
02:12:37,460 --> 02:12:41,580
I really like normally talking, but I love
him. Yeah, I didn't have, there was a,

2342
02:12:41,960 --> 02:12:44,150
she was swearing like a,

2343
02:12:44,300 --> 02:12:48,290
like a soldier on stage very quickly,
very quickly.

2344
02:12:48,320 --> 02:12:49,970
Which that was I found,

2345
02:12:50,150 --> 02:12:53,990
I don't know how she ramped into that
and then she dropped out of it. It was,

2346
02:12:53,991 --> 02:12:57,800
that was something was bad and then she
went to France and I want to just start

2347
02:12:57,801 --> 02:13:01,610
and did stand up. There's someone was
translating and like that was weird.

2348
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:05,180
I have done it in French and I
don't think I could've got that.

2349
02:13:05,310 --> 02:13:08,630
I didn't know why that, that seems
just seem to be slightly shocked,

2350
02:13:08,850 --> 02:13:11,050
not jumping a shark going up to the
shock shark, swimming around chefs,

2351
02:13:11,270 --> 02:13:16,250
artistic interpretation. They,
they, they, it wasn't realistic,

2352
02:13:16,310 --> 02:13:18,140
but it was still,
it was,

2353
02:13:18,460 --> 02:13:21,410
and that's a person who makes
a living doing standup comedy.

2354
02:13:21,440 --> 02:13:25,730
I was willing to let that suspension of
disbelief taste. And I like the, the,

2355
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:27,790
the sexual relationship
is always coming back.

2356
02:13:27,810 --> 02:13:32,340
The husband's almost coming back into
the frame and his and his fight that,

2357
02:13:32,400 --> 02:13:36,030
um, cause yeah, but no, I, I
did watch a binge watch all,

2358
02:13:36,031 --> 02:13:36,831
that's what I'm doing there.

2359
02:13:36,831 --> 02:13:40,950
I just sit down and I just watched
everything and then I moved on. Um,

2360
02:13:41,610 --> 02:13:44,250
but uh, yeah, Lenny um,
how do we get them to,

2361
02:13:44,251 --> 02:13:47,190
Lenny was talking about something
else, but anyway, no, it was great.

2362
02:13:47,190 --> 02:13:48,850
It was great playing Lenny but oh yes,
I was,

2363
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:52,380
I was doing the standups and I was
just told by Director Peter Hall,

2364
02:13:52,920 --> 02:13:55,500
I'll leave the standup to you.
So I had no direction on it,

2365
02:13:55,680 --> 02:13:58,860
so I just did it as close as I could
to how Lenny would have done it.

2366
02:13:59,700 --> 02:14:02,190
Did you listen to a lot of recordings?
I did that.

2367
02:14:02,191 --> 02:14:05,400
That was very difficult for British.
Uh,

2368
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:09,240
kids are maybe math and kids of today to
know cause he's doing a lot of hipster

2369
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:12,480
references. A lot of, you know, the
Sophie Tucker references and there's a,

2370
02:14:12,481 --> 02:14:16,830
there's a Lawrence Welk. Is it the Welsh
Welsh, yeah. We don't know those guys.

2371
02:14:16,831 --> 02:14:20,160
So when he was doing it, cause there's
Sophie Tucker and the guy, I can look up.

2372
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:23,790
So for that I'd have to look up some of
the punchlines or none of that number of

2373
02:14:23,791 --> 02:14:26,010
the references cause you without
the references you can't get it.

2374
02:14:26,160 --> 02:14:30,150
This is a trick I do in universal humor
that I take either huge references or

2375
02:14:30,151 --> 02:14:32,740
explained my references so that you know,
uh,

2376
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:37,620
sees everyone probably knows about season
if they don't. Well I yeah. Anyway,

2377
02:14:38,070 --> 02:14:41,910
good as Lenny was. It's really hard for
people to listen to that comedy today.

2378
02:14:42,090 --> 02:14:43,680
It doesn't necessarily trends,

2379
02:14:43,710 --> 02:14:46,510
it doesn't transfer well he's talking
about Nixon and you're going, oh Nixon,

2380
02:14:46,511 --> 02:14:50,730
Nixon knows this is a vice president
Nixon and this is Eisenhower, Nixon,

2381
02:14:50,970 --> 02:14:55,680
different thing. Um, so he,

2382
02:14:55,950 --> 02:15:00,450
I worked out that all the,
all my stuff is non datable is no,

2383
02:15:00,480 --> 02:15:02,970
I didn't do any topical stuff.
I don't do party political stuff.

2384
02:15:03,210 --> 02:15:07,380
So it should not date. I do historical
stuff cause that never takes, you know,

2385
02:15:07,800 --> 02:15:10,470
sees it. It's not going to come back.
Now sees this changed his whole thing.

2386
02:15:10,471 --> 02:15:13,290
He's much nicer though. He's come back
from the dead and he's cleaned up his act.

2387
02:15:13,740 --> 02:15:17,700
Um, so I've, I've tried to do that and
python did this as well. You do stuff,

2388
02:15:17,701 --> 02:15:21,960
it just doesn't really date. Most of it
doesn't date, which is a handy thing.

2389
02:15:21,970 --> 02:15:26,820
So yeah. But I did watch stand
up does, and it's also the, the,

2390
02:15:27,110 --> 02:15:27,550
the,

2391
02:15:27,550 --> 02:15:31,500
the culture is so significantly different
between the late fifties and sixties

2392
02:15:31,501 --> 02:15:35,760
where Lenny Bruce was sort of starting
out and making his mark versus today.

2393
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:38,610
It's like the things that
were naughty back then,

2394
02:15:38,640 --> 02:15:41,760
the things that he could say that were
controversial, there were nothing today.

2395
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:42,421
They're the,

2396
02:15:42,421 --> 02:15:47,421
literally it's a non controversy whether
those one that that still was was when

2397
02:15:47,761 --> 02:15:52,600
he said how many people using the n word,
the n ass working,

2398
02:15:52,601 --> 02:15:55,820
they just went to all the, how many are
in the [inaudible]? How many of the way?

2399
02:15:55,840 --> 02:15:58,920
And then I did this,
I used to do that on stage every night.

2400
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:02,690
And that was still a striking
dance. Yeah. Yeah. But the,

2401
02:16:02,691 --> 02:16:06,900
the sentiment behind it was that these
words only have power because it cause we

2402
02:16:06,901 --> 02:16:10,080
give them and if he could use
him again, again, again, yeah.

2403
02:16:10,090 --> 02:16:12,180
And for the gay community,

2404
02:16:12,181 --> 02:16:16,320
they taking the word queer reclaimed that
so it doesn't have the force anymore.

2405
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,840
And that that is the
truth. He spoke, he was at,

2406
02:16:18,841 --> 02:16:22,530
that was a true analysis that
he did. Yeah, it was, um,

2407
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:24,700
we had some still Joe,
there was a,

2408
02:16:25,290 --> 02:16:29,070
unfortunately accidentally a friend of
mine stole one of his jokes and didn't

2409
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,000
know the,

2410
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,080
he actually just thought of the
same premise. Yeah. And he was the,

2411
02:16:33,090 --> 02:16:35,830
the premise was that uh,

2412
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:38,740
homosexuality in some places illegal.

2413
02:16:38,830 --> 02:16:42,010
And what do they do if they catch you
while they lock you up in jail with a

2414
02:16:42,011 --> 02:16:45,940
bunch of men who want to have sex with
you? Like in that was Lenny Bruce's line.

2415
02:16:46,340 --> 02:16:49,510
Like Digg, homosexuality is
illegal. Right. So what are they,

2416
02:16:49,511 --> 02:16:53,290
do they put you in jail with a bunch of
men will have sex with you? You know,

2417
02:16:53,291 --> 02:16:57,400
like that was his whole like, and like
that still would work today. Like,

2418
02:16:57,401 --> 02:17:01,090
if there was a place where homosexuality
was illegal today and you did that joke,

2419
02:17:01,091 --> 02:17:04,940
it's a good joke. It's like set up
punchline. It's all right there. Yeah.

2420
02:17:05,380 --> 02:17:06,490
Lenny was ahead of it and you know,

2421
02:17:06,491 --> 02:17:11,491
he's early stuff was more mainstream
than you can ever believe doing way,

2422
02:17:11,610 --> 02:17:14,870
way mate. Same as Carlin. If you
listen to Carlin's really stuff. Yeah,

2423
02:17:14,880 --> 02:17:17,260
I've heard of, yes. I
think God, it was like,

2424
02:17:17,530 --> 02:17:22,530
like just like a typical Jack Paar tonight
show set and it was all like really

2425
02:17:23,441 --> 02:17:24,520
like down the middle,

2426
02:17:24,521 --> 02:17:29,521
squeaky clean and he wore
suits and he was a clean cut.

2427
02:17:29,531 --> 02:17:33,790
You're seeing Carl in the early days.
I think I've seen once. I, I, yeah,

2428
02:17:33,791 --> 02:17:36,850
I do know there was, it wasn't, there was
his tie and a suit. There was a change.

2429
02:17:36,851 --> 02:17:40,030
Well, Glenn, he had a complete change
and that thing in the film where he says,

2430
02:17:40,031 --> 02:17:44,920
you'll never play here. And what's the
area in upstate New York? Catskills.

2431
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:51,820
The Catskills. Yeah. Um, I remember
when I watched it first I thought, oh,

2432
02:17:51,821 --> 02:17:54,490
that's a terrible thing to have.
But now that I know what that was,

2433
02:17:54,491 --> 02:17:57,010
it was a certain belt of,
you know how you're going to put out,

2434
02:17:57,070 --> 02:18:00,610
that's George Carlin
play a little bit of this.

2435
02:18:01,790 --> 02:18:06,580
It's crazy from the Merv Griffin show,
big hassle.

2436
02:18:06,700 --> 02:18:08,770
We never see how the Indians prepare.

2437
02:18:13,330 --> 02:18:14,141
Oh awful.

2438
02:18:14,141 --> 02:18:18,910
That suit is just because
they started defending Malibu

2439
02:18:21,130 --> 02:18:23,420
[inaudible]

2440
02:18:23,930 --> 02:18:26,640
but is that sort of style,
you know, he had that,

2441
02:18:26,670 --> 02:18:30,240
I mean that's what you did back then.
This is the Merv Griffin show.

2442
02:18:30,241 --> 02:18:32,590
I mean it really didn't have any options.
That's how you perform.

2443
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,110
Otherwise they wouldn't let you on.

2444
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:39,030
What she did change on a dime did he
arrested a bunch of times, you know,

2445
02:18:39,210 --> 02:18:43,800
and he became a marijuana enthusiasts
and the, you know, it started,

2446
02:18:44,160 --> 02:18:45,940
it just the, the, the,

2447
02:18:45,980 --> 02:18:50,980
the times changed and I think you can
only sit back and observe for so long

2448
02:18:51,871 --> 02:18:55,500
before you start commenting on things.
And then he shifted and he became,

2449
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:59,250
and I think he was also
experiencing prior,

2450
02:18:59,490 --> 02:19:04,480
like prior of course was I think
Lenny Bruce was the original. Yeah.

2451
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:08,730
But prior was the one who made it
insanely personal and it was insanely

2452
02:19:08,731 --> 02:19:13,731
vulnerable on stage and also he had a
point to a lot of the things he was doing.

2453
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:16,770
I mean I think if there's a great,

2454
02:19:16,940 --> 02:19:19,500
I don't think there's a greatest
standup of all time, but if there is,

2455
02:19:19,501 --> 02:19:21,660
it might be prior. You know, that he just,

2456
02:19:21,870 --> 02:19:26,870
he had this perspective that was
just wholly individually like holy,

2457
02:19:27,500 --> 02:19:27,980
it's up 10

2458
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:28,521
years later.

2459
02:19:28,521 --> 02:19:33,130
That's why it looks six bid really does
change at the end that I have been here.

2460
02:19:33,800 --> 02:19:35,390
Yeah.
I mean he was looking at him,

2461
02:19:35,391 --> 02:19:40,100
he's got a look fucking Steve
jobs outfit on now. Yeah.

2462
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:44,990
He became, it became a, you know,
they hippie hair got longer.

2463
02:19:45,460 --> 02:19:48,650
I have a bear. Um, Richard Pryor,

2464
02:19:48,700 --> 02:19:52,580
I think Richard Pryor is for
me. He was, cause I had this,

2465
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:57,350
I had this base of, of uh, Monte
Python, which is what I was going to do.

2466
02:19:57,860 --> 02:20:01,370
And then I had Richard Pryor and
Billy Connolly, Scottish comedian,

2467
02:20:01,371 --> 02:20:03,890
British economy, those
two, Billy talks too,

2468
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:07,430
just so relaxed with talking the large
groups of people and what Richard was

2469
02:20:07,431 --> 02:20:11,300
doing. It was the acting out
of all the characters thing.

2470
02:20:11,330 --> 02:20:13,940
That was the wonderful thing.
That's what I do. Well,

2471
02:20:13,941 --> 02:20:16,440
you're going to do and
why we did it was a no.

2472
02:20:17,350 --> 02:20:21,410
The dog says the dog is doses. Come on
in. Hey, come on in to burglars. Yeah,

2473
02:20:21,411 --> 02:20:24,080
you called me.
You shall not leave.

2474
02:20:24,530 --> 02:20:26,840
Dobermans playing these,

2475
02:20:26,870 --> 02:20:31,160
these different voices and characters
and what he could do and that was just,

2476
02:20:31,161 --> 02:20:33,830
that was stunning to me. Yeah.
He was something special.

2477
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:37,730
Look at him back in there too. That's
literally him like on the wall back there.

2478
02:20:37,990 --> 02:20:42,320
A mugshot. That's the same era. It could
be. That could have been that night.

2479
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:47,990
Yeah. Might happen that night. There's
some fantastic recordings that,

2480
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:51,050
I don't know where they are now,
but they used to be able to buy them.

2481
02:20:51,051 --> 02:20:55,160
I bought them on a truck stop and there
were from Red Foxx comedy club and they

2482
02:20:55,161 --> 02:20:57,940
were cassette tapes and a,
I was on,

2483
02:20:58,020 --> 02:20:59,930
I was doing a road gig
and I think I found them.

2484
02:20:59,931 --> 02:21:04,931
I bought a bunch of them
and these recordings where
they just said set up a tape

2485
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:10,241
recorder and he was doing these random
sets at Red Fox is comedy club and it was

2486
02:21:12,100 --> 02:21:14,810
a lot of experimenting,
a lot of ad libbing,

2487
02:21:14,811 --> 02:21:17,780
a lot of me clearly high on stage.

2488
02:21:17,780 --> 02:21:21,560
I mean he would get go on state high a
lot and it was just ramble about stuff

2489
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:22,220
and they would,

2490
02:21:22,220 --> 02:21:26,510
you would see these bits forming and
coming out of that and then some of those

2491
02:21:26,511 --> 02:21:29,830
bits eventually would be on
some of his more famous albums.

2492
02:21:30,490 --> 02:21:35,450
It was great. Great stuff. Just to see
this guy who was just, so, if you go,

2493
02:21:35,451 --> 02:21:37,430
if you go from,
you know,

2494
02:21:37,431 --> 02:21:42,431
your traditional standup comedian from
1960 like you were seeing George Carlin

2495
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:47,780
onstage to what prior was doing in the
70s it's is so different, so radically,

2496
02:21:47,781 --> 02:21:51,130
radically different.
And he took it to a different place or we,

2497
02:21:51,260 --> 02:21:52,970
you were talking about the scene
in Britain were interesting.

2498
02:21:52,971 --> 02:21:57,430
We don't really have much of
a film industry if we don't
have it as quite set up.

2499
02:21:57,470 --> 02:22:01,490
You know, obviously it's huge. And
in America compared to what we are.

2500
02:22:01,491 --> 02:22:04,040
We have a quite a good TV industry.
So,

2501
02:22:04,430 --> 02:22:07,790
but we toured like crazy.
Um,

2502
02:22:08,270 --> 02:22:12,250
so there's lots of tours in a hundred
seats, 500 a thousand seaters,

2503
02:22:12,260 --> 02:22:12,890
thousand five,

2504
02:22:12,890 --> 02:22:17,360
2000 CFUs that goes on like
endlessly all the time,

2505
02:22:17,990 --> 02:22:20,070
way more than it used to
before. So, and there's,

2506
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:21,430
there's lots of clubs and they will,

2507
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,380
a lot of them would just
room above a pub type clubs.

2508
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:26,070
So I believe the clubs in America,
which

2509
02:22:26,080 --> 02:22:27,990
much more set up there was a bar thing,

2510
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,580
system people come out and
do the drinks and, and,

2511
02:22:30,581 --> 02:22:34,860
and it was quite a cash outlay had to
get this club going. And it would be,

2512
02:22:34,861 --> 02:22:37,380
you know, most nights of the week
we'd have it one night a week,

2513
02:22:37,381 --> 02:22:41,700
it just be a function room in a pub that
existed for maybe hundreds and hundreds

2514
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:45,930
of years because all these puppies to
be taverns drinking and it wasn't used.

2515
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:49,200
And they sit there, some guy would
say, hey, I'll run a club up here.

2516
02:22:49,590 --> 02:22:52,710
I'll take the door money. You take
the bar money. And that was the deal.

2517
02:22:52,711 --> 02:22:55,080
So a lot of amateurs running it.
So we had lots of club.

2518
02:22:55,081 --> 02:22:59,790
We had that 60 70 80 clubs in London.
You could, you could zip around.

2519
02:23:00,330 --> 02:23:04,680
Yeah. It was a ridiculous amount. And so
for me, what the Beatles had with the,

2520
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:06,840
with playing in Germany,

2521
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:10,470
I had with London and we'll have
with playing in London, you could,

2522
02:23:10,500 --> 02:23:13,680
you could do four in a night,
five, four foreign a night, quite,

2523
02:23:13,830 --> 02:23:15,390
quite easily on the Friday and Saturday.

2524
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:18,660
You just jumped in taxis and zip between
different gangs they do in New York.

2525
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:23,340
Yeah. Yeah. But it was just so many
clubs. Oh Wow. So it was beautiful.

2526
02:23:23,341 --> 02:23:25,430
I think there's less now,
but it's a,

2527
02:23:25,450 --> 02:23:28,890
there's lots of open Mike nights now and
so many people wanted to get into it.

2528
02:23:28,891 --> 02:23:32,160
You can create, there's no top
to the Korea now. We playing,

2529
02:23:32,340 --> 02:23:34,530
people are playing an arena.
I started doing arena tours.

2530
02:23:34,531 --> 02:23:38,910
I'm now doing more theaters on this one.
My audience has got a bit older.

2531
02:23:38,911 --> 02:23:43,080
But anyway, jumping between the two, like
playing Hollywood bowl here, I, you know,

2532
02:23:43,570 --> 02:23:47,590
in La that's such a beautiful thing to
play. And it's the Greeks got it right.

2533
02:23:47,620 --> 02:23:51,450
The loft of rolls down the hill, played
it twice now and it's just gorgeous.

2534
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:52,471
I've never played there,

2535
02:23:52,471 --> 02:23:55,050
but I've been there for a few
times for a few different things.

2536
02:23:55,050 --> 02:23:58,610
I saw Annie there and I
saw the, what is it? Oh

2537
02:24:00,150 --> 02:24:03,660
a nightmare. Before Halloween. Yeah.

2538
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:08,460
You so Annie the musical. Yeah, they do
the musical there, do a version of it.

2539
02:24:08,850 --> 02:24:11,220
And they do a, the nightmare
before Halloween where they play,

2540
02:24:11,610 --> 02:24:15,300
they play the movie and then they have
a symphony and the symphony and didn't

2541
02:24:15,301 --> 02:24:19,610
think Annie B you'll kind of have kids.
Do you needed to say that?

2542
02:24:19,611 --> 02:24:22,990
Cause I just didn't enjoy it. All right.
I'm bored out of my fucking mind. No,

2543
02:24:23,250 --> 02:24:28,230
I was just going to leave with that.
And he's your kind of, I always,

2544
02:24:28,231 --> 02:24:30,300
it always comes in. Yeah.
Well I like everything.

2545
02:24:30,480 --> 02:24:33,710
I like a lot of things that you would
think you wouldn't like, you know that uh,

2546
02:24:33,750 --> 02:24:35,880
for the people of la
or people at the world,

2547
02:24:36,510 --> 02:24:40,140
I believe that the
Hollywood bowl is a la park,

2548
02:24:40,410 --> 02:24:44,190
so you can actually go up there and
have you sandwiches anytime you want,

2549
02:24:44,340 --> 02:24:45,690
which is a beautiful thing.
I do that.

2550
02:24:45,691 --> 02:24:47,580
I can drive up there cause it
looks like don't come in here.

2551
02:24:47,581 --> 02:24:50,730
There's barriers and stuff, but now
you can pack up and go and it's a park.

2552
02:24:50,731 --> 02:24:54,270
It's still a park. I love
that space. It's just got,

2553
02:24:54,271 --> 02:24:57,180
and I knew that Monty python and played
there so I thought I couldn't play well.

2554
02:24:57,190 --> 02:24:59,460
It's beautiful too because
it's all outdoors and you know,

2555
02:24:59,461 --> 02:25:01,650
La has such amazing weather
and you look around,

2556
02:25:01,651 --> 02:25:03,630
you see the houses and the
distance and it's like this,

2557
02:25:03,631 --> 02:25:07,080
it's a special little spot.
It's beautiful. I don't,

2558
02:25:07,220 --> 02:25:09,840
Dave Chappelle's done some gigs there.
I think Chris rock did a gig there.

2559
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:14,400
That's a must be a fun place to
perform too. It's just, it works.

2560
02:25:14,401 --> 02:25:15,560
That amphitheater thing,

2561
02:25:16,320 --> 02:25:20,740
I think it was the Greek democracy
and empathy others and uh,

2562
02:25:21,240 --> 02:25:25,570
yeah. Do you still go to
clubs all, I don't so much.

2563
02:25:25,600 --> 02:25:30,380
I was reading the definitive
thing on Robin Williams and Harry,

2564
02:25:30,390 --> 02:25:35,050
he would jump into clubs and do
stuff and go on. And I, I it doesn't,

2565
02:25:35,051 --> 02:25:38,440
that doesn't really work for my stuff.
I tend to get a small,

2566
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:41,740
I can divert club like for the work in
progress shows I was doing, I was taking,

2567
02:25:42,070 --> 02:25:46,710
I was, they, they uh, they
have the Al Marri Club in uh,

2568
02:25:46,860 --> 02:25:51,450
in isn't to know angel in London,
sort of north, northeast Linda.

2569
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,980
And uh, they had, you know, show going on
at six one at seven and eight, you know,

2570
02:25:55,981 --> 02:26:00,030
and I would take an hour of that and just
do that again, again and again. So I'll,

2571
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:04,990
I'll take an hour and I'll go out for
an hour and workshop to show and as

2572
02:26:04,991 --> 02:26:09,040
opposed to coming on doing 15
minutes on a, off the top of my head,

2573
02:26:09,041 --> 02:26:12,640
cause I find that if I,
if I'm completely going scatter gun,

2574
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:14,440
just trying to find funny,
that doesn't really help me.

2575
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:18,160
I need to keep crafting this stuff
cause then I can use on the show. Yeah.

2576
02:26:18,380 --> 02:26:21,850
I also don't need, if it's a, if
it's just a, if it's a comedy club,

2577
02:26:21,851 --> 02:26:22,950
they want it faster,
they want it quickly,

2578
02:26:22,951 --> 02:26:25,570
they want it smooth and I'm
not looking to hit the gags.

2579
02:26:25,571 --> 02:26:28,480
I'm just looking to find things
and have the space to stop and go.

2580
02:26:28,690 --> 02:26:32,260
What is it about cheese? Right.
Why is it got to ease in it?

2581
02:26:32,680 --> 02:26:35,440
I just want to waffle around until
I go. Okay, that, that's a good,

2582
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:38,830
I'll keep that pit. Do
you ever feel like, uh,

2583
02:26:38,950 --> 02:26:41,250
like when you're doing
that like Jesus Christ,

2584
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:43,990
I got to get off this fucking subject.
Like there's nothing there.

2585
02:26:44,050 --> 02:26:47,700
Well yeah I do that but then I do this
thing I write on my left hand like it's a

2586
02:26:47,710 --> 02:26:51,740
note to self and I go a bit. If I do
pig farmer talking about pigs and stuff,

2587
02:26:52,050 --> 02:26:54,660
they never talk about pig farming there.
You guys will pick firms. All right,

2588
02:26:54,670 --> 02:26:56,590
I'm not talking about it.
Never talking about cheese again.

2589
02:26:56,591 --> 02:27:00,820
Cheese jokes do not work. Especially
in North East London. You can,

2590
02:27:00,850 --> 02:27:05,010
you just get it, try and get lost
on the way out. The career is over.

2591
02:27:05,020 --> 02:27:08,410
Cheese is taking over my life. But, um,

2592
02:27:08,440 --> 02:27:13,440
do you do some gigs dressed in your
girl mode in some boring mode boy mode?

2593
02:27:13,991 --> 02:27:17,530
Or can I can,
I can do it whatever mode they want now.

2594
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:20,980
It complete human torch thing.
I can fly so

2595
02:27:22,900 --> 02:27:25,450
I can wear a dress or I could wear
trousers and it doesn't matter.

2596
02:27:25,451 --> 02:27:28,600
And they don't give a monkey's
either. That's interesting. It's now,

2597
02:27:28,690 --> 02:27:33,220
well they're your fans. Yeah. Yeah.
Yes. It's that coming. Yeah. So,

2598
02:27:33,770 --> 02:27:37,830
uh, but I think get a disappointed
if he dresses as a man, um,

2599
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:43,210
boy, girl mode. Um, they, uh,

2600
02:27:43,211 --> 02:27:47,740
I dunno. I don't care. I shouldn't care.
I can't be stage stage. Oh, I wonder,

2601
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:51,090
cause because that's nothing to
do with the comedy. Yes. Yeah.

2602
02:27:51,100 --> 02:27:53,200
And I do think some people thought it was,
you know,

2603
02:27:53,201 --> 02:27:57,460
he's going to talk about lipstick for
two hours. So anywhere, another lipstick.

2604
02:27:57,461 --> 02:28:01,140
I know it was gross it at all. Do you
address it at all in your act diagonally?

2605
02:28:01,210 --> 02:28:05,790
I will do it diagonally. Diagonally, yeah.
Um, so it's never the front part of the,

2606
02:28:05,920 --> 02:28:10,840
the thing. Um, I will just say, uh,

2607
02:28:11,620 --> 02:28:14,770
uh,
what's a good day?

2608
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:20,280
It would not be the front of the
subject. I might point in passing. Um,

2609
02:28:20,320 --> 02:28:23,660
so the, the front, I'll talk about
ancient king stuff with Banjos,

2610
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:27,350
Doug's with fighting cats,
anything like that. And then I'm,

2611
02:28:27,390 --> 02:28:31,580
then I might mention it just in passing
as opposed to let me tell you about

2612
02:28:31,581 --> 02:28:35,150
being transgender. I just don't
do that. I talk about the fights.

2613
02:28:35,151 --> 02:28:36,590
I told about the fight I had,

2614
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:41,180
which was a in the street and that this
guy was saying this and I said this.

2615
02:28:41,181 --> 02:28:45,290
And so we to either like I built a fight
into a huge thing if we stand off stuff.

2616
02:28:45,291 --> 02:28:48,310
So just I can make that
into, into something. But um,

2617
02:28:48,410 --> 02:28:53,030
no it's not cause it's supposed
to be the background of, uh,

2618
02:28:53,031 --> 02:28:55,190
of what I'm doing. The,
the essential thing,

2619
02:28:55,191 --> 02:28:58,370
if you'd like surreal comedy off
the wall comedy, that's what I do.

2620
02:28:58,610 --> 02:29:02,930
And I just happened to be transgender,
which makes no odds in these these days.

2621
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:05,500
Do you find that more today than ever?

2622
02:29:05,501 --> 02:29:09,160
People are asking you questions about
transgender issues because they're,

2623
02:29:09,161 --> 02:29:12,480
they're at the forefront now. Less
action. Less. Yeah. Less real interesting.

2624
02:29:12,520 --> 02:29:15,650
There was a point early stage
of the spokesperson it was on

2625
02:29:15,820 --> 02:29:19,600
and they would, yes. Well,
um, if not a spokesperson,

2626
02:29:19,601 --> 02:29:21,060
I was someone who was
going to talk about it.

2627
02:29:21,080 --> 02:29:25,690
This chapter is all about this and I
do an interview and if it was an hour

2628
02:29:25,691 --> 02:29:29,110
interview, about 40 minutes would
be on the, on that and then,

2629
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,950
and then when the Keto
writer, they thought, well,

2630
02:29:30,951 --> 02:29:33,250
I'm just writing all about this
transaction. All right, let's,

2631
02:29:33,280 --> 02:29:34,270
let's put that back a bit.

2632
02:29:34,510 --> 02:29:38,200
And then they used to balance it that
when they wrote the interview out. But um,

2633
02:29:38,260 --> 02:29:41,800
would you rather that they just
accept it and just not bringing it?

2634
02:29:41,820 --> 02:29:46,060
I'm fine with it. And I, I,
after the marathons, it'll,

2635
02:29:46,250 --> 02:29:48,580
it changed because they said,
oh,

2636
02:29:48,581 --> 02:29:53,110
so cause I used to say action transvestite
and executive transvestite. There was,

2637
02:29:53,111 --> 02:29:55,760
I was in New York, has played
New York and they said, um,

2638
02:29:55,990 --> 02:30:00,730
article a guy was found living in one
of the caves in the park in New York and

2639
02:30:00,731 --> 02:30:02,890
he finds that have a lot
of women's shoes in there,

2640
02:30:02,891 --> 02:30:04,660
so he's probably a
transvestite. And I went, okay,

2641
02:30:04,661 --> 02:30:07,000
well that's where they're transvestite.
I'm not living in a cave,

2642
02:30:07,660 --> 02:30:09,760
I'm traveling business
class on the plains.

2643
02:30:09,761 --> 02:30:12,070
This is executive transmits
that so I cannot with that one.

2644
02:30:12,320 --> 02:30:15,250
And then the action transvestite
was just kind of a fun,

2645
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:18,880
cause I was more kind of Boise about
things that I'll give people grief in the

2646
02:30:18,881 --> 02:30:23,410
streets if they give me grief. And then,
uh, after the marathons it came, uh,

2647
02:30:23,470 --> 02:30:28,430
became a different thing and everyone
just went, oh, I've had some, you know,

2648
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:29,333
I remember a guy,

2649
02:30:29,980 --> 02:30:32,880
this was a very interesting altercation
because hardly any words in it. So I'm,

2650
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:37,150
I live near Victoria coach
station in London, um,

2651
02:30:37,960 --> 02:30:41,890
most of the time, whatever around. And I
was walking down there and then anyway,

2652
02:30:41,891 --> 02:30:43,630
it's a coach station,
so people are traveling all over the,

2653
02:30:43,670 --> 02:30:47,440
over the Europe from there.
And I walked out and I was in girl mode.

2654
02:30:47,441 --> 02:30:51,670
This guy looks at me and
said, hey, it is a ew, ew, ew.

2655
02:30:52,440 --> 02:30:57,290
On all those marathons. And you
were all that clubber, which all?

2656
02:30:59,070 --> 02:31:01,160
And then he went, yeah, yeah, yeah. And,

2657
02:31:01,210 --> 02:31:05,010
and it was just like he was getting me a
pass. He was going up. Well, okay. Okay.

2658
02:31:05,011 --> 02:31:08,990
Fab. Yeah. Well, I, that's
what my, I, you know,

2659
02:31:09,090 --> 02:31:11,820
I didn't have a negative opinion of you.
I had a positive opinion of you,

2660
02:31:12,090 --> 02:31:16,110
but my positive opinion of you elevated
once I saw you did those marathons.

2661
02:31:16,111 --> 02:31:20,140
My Dad's a person with an
iron will. That's a different
kind of like, you eat it.

2662
02:31:20,150 --> 02:31:24,750
It was so huge what you did
that everyone had to respect it.

2663
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:29,460
Like they knew they couldn't do it, or if
they could do it, they haven't, you know,

2664
02:31:29,790 --> 02:31:32,110
that that action that's
covered. Yes. I haven't.

2665
02:31:32,130 --> 02:31:35,550
You accomplished something pretty
spectacular. It was beautiful. And it,

2666
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:38,790
and I did about five things at once
and it was raising money. Yeah.

2667
02:31:38,791 --> 02:31:43,200
So I've think I've raised about four
and a half million pounds about I was 6

2668
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:45,750
million, $700. So that feels great.

2669
02:31:46,510 --> 02:31:49,260
That's with their help because the
organization is good at raising the money.

2670
02:31:49,740 --> 02:31:53,250
And uh, it gave me this,
this, this confidence,

2671
02:31:53,251 --> 02:31:55,380
this health thing back from
when I was a kid. I used to be,

2672
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:57,900
a lot of us were running
around you when you did that.

2673
02:31:57,930 --> 02:32:00,810
First one was I was 47.

2674
02:32:01,080 --> 02:32:05,640
So you're 47 and just
decided, yeah, I'm off.

2675
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:08,970
Um, it was, it was training.
I wanted to do something. I,

2676
02:32:08,971 --> 02:32:11,760
it's an adventure as well and you know,

2677
02:32:11,790 --> 02:32:15,090
I think you have to live life as an
adventure, otherwise life is too hard.

2678
02:32:15,510 --> 02:32:20,070
But if you look at as eventually it means
the highs and lows built into it. Um,

2679
02:32:20,370 --> 02:32:24,270
and I, I got this, this
health kick out of it.

2680
02:32:24,780 --> 02:32:29,130
Um, uh, it was just a number of
that. And then I could meet people.

2681
02:32:29,131 --> 02:32:33,360
I remember on the first math and then
I met three army sergeants who were,

2682
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:36,990
and they said, we've heard you're doing
this, some of the British army and what?

2683
02:32:36,991 --> 02:32:40,590
I was just having something
that we halfway through my,

2684
02:32:40,620 --> 02:32:43,800
what was it about my 10th
marathon? He said, we heard,
we heard you're doing this.

2685
02:32:43,801 --> 02:32:45,570
And, and, and there were
chatting to me and you know,

2686
02:32:45,571 --> 02:32:49,020
cause I know forces and I have that
mentality. I'm very happy to chat.

2687
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:51,760
And suddenly I thought, wow, this is
an interesting respect thing. He said.

2688
02:32:51,810 --> 02:32:53,700
And they said, we're trainers, we train,

2689
02:32:53,730 --> 02:32:56,040
we work out the training
regimes for the army.

2690
02:32:57,360 --> 02:33:01,050
And so we were very interested in what
you're doing and what you seem to be able

2691
02:33:01,051 --> 02:33:04,410
to do. So they just found it fascinating.
And I found that fascinating.

2692
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:08,070
I could suddenly talk to
service people in a certain way,

2693
02:33:08,071 --> 02:33:10,980
a sports people in a certain
way. It, everything just shifted.

2694
02:33:11,450 --> 02:33:15,360
And people from death,
different ethnic, uh, groups.

2695
02:33:15,361 --> 02:33:17,740
Some people have laid down
on some ethnic groups,

2696
02:33:17,780 --> 02:33:21,600
the down on being transgender or whatever.
But if you're doing that, then he says,

2697
02:33:21,601 --> 02:33:24,830
okay, we put these two together and
you want a different place. So it,

2698
02:33:24,910 --> 02:33:29,910
it has completely changed the
way a lot of people react to me.

2699
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:35,370
Yeah. I can only imagine they don't
necessarily come to the comedy,

2700
02:33:35,540 --> 02:33:37,170
but that's fine because they respect you.
Yeah.

2701
02:33:37,230 --> 02:33:40,620
There's just certain different
things happen and uh, and you can,

2702
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:42,480
and I'd like to chat to people.

2703
02:33:42,481 --> 02:33:45,930
I found that chatting is very important
because if you see someone and it's a

2704
02:33:45,931 --> 02:33:50,520
blog, make makeup, whatever, and you get
lipstick and you go, people can go Ooh,

2705
02:33:50,550 --> 02:33:54,290
but if you say hi, nice weather
today, and they go, ah, yes,

2706
02:33:56,160 --> 02:34:00,690
on a different footing and trying to
put you into a place of normalcy. Yeah.

2707
02:34:00,691 --> 02:34:02,270
Well I'm trying to put myself,
they will,

2708
02:34:02,670 --> 02:34:07,430
they will allow me indicating they will
allow me in. And it's normal. It is.

2709
02:34:07,440 --> 02:34:11,910
The talking is the most important thing.
Just chatting away and being boring.

2710
02:34:12,270 --> 02:34:16,530
I have a natural boringness. I think
maybe everyone has an awful boring this.

2711
02:34:16,531 --> 02:34:17,980
I think the really interesting people

2712
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:20,770
probably just blow up and when they are
in their twenties and stuff because they

2713
02:34:20,771 --> 02:34:22,240
just do stuff that's too far out,

2714
02:34:22,690 --> 02:34:26,440
but most of us are pretty boring and
then we add layers of interestingness on

2715
02:34:26,470 --> 02:34:29,950
tops to to to reach that level of,
okay.

2716
02:34:29,951 --> 02:34:33,100
I think I'm quite interesting that I
think I've got enough interest in going on

2717
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:35,710
a but my boring in chatting,

2718
02:34:35,711 --> 02:34:40,711
I am chatting and talking about whether
or wood or walls or trees or that

2719
02:34:42,071 --> 02:34:45,580
introduces the normalcy.
Yeah, the boring. I won't say,

2720
02:34:46,240 --> 02:34:48,850
I won't say we've got to
do something extreme now.

2721
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:53,740
I'll just chat about yeah, normal thing.
Yeah. Where'd you get that jacket?

2722
02:34:53,940 --> 02:34:56,470
That's quite a good jacket on
you on. You woke up me, you know,

2723
02:34:56,471 --> 02:34:58,840
just just talk about things and B,
be human,

2724
02:34:58,841 --> 02:35:03,520
be a human being and she's the biggest
controversy in America in terms of

2725
02:35:03,521 --> 02:35:04,660
transgender people.

2726
02:35:04,660 --> 02:35:09,640
Probably the biggest or one of the
biggest is competing in sports with

2727
02:35:09,641 --> 02:35:13,200
biological women. That's
the biggest one. Yes.

2728
02:35:13,600 --> 02:35:18,370
If you're asking me for answers on
that, uh, haven't really got them.

2729
02:35:18,371 --> 02:35:22,480
I know. Yeah. I've got
one good one for, um,

2730
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:24,660
for washrooms as you call
them. Lectures, restaurant,

2731
02:35:24,870 --> 02:35:27,960
which is on the urinals as you call them.
He called me rhinos.

2732
02:35:28,600 --> 02:35:31,930
Just check them all out and everyone just,
it's all cubicles.

2733
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:36,900
And we already do that in restaurants.
We already share stuff. Uh, the, the,

2734
02:35:36,901 --> 02:35:40,110
the toilets in, right? We do it in
the airplanes. We have no bother.

2735
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:42,370
If you just remove urinals at,

2736
02:35:42,460 --> 02:35:45,190
in theaters and places the won't be
carrying often than women are queuing

2737
02:35:45,191 --> 02:35:48,220
forever and the men are not
curing this way. Everyone shares,

2738
02:35:48,221 --> 02:35:49,840
everyone behaves around responsibility.

2739
02:35:49,841 --> 02:35:53,270
I've heard of it working in a school
as well. There's less bullying in,

2740
02:35:53,440 --> 02:35:58,170
in the lose. So it's the idea, just
check it's regression of technology.

2741
02:35:58,210 --> 02:36:01,540
I take it says get the wrong, check it
out the window. Everyone has a cubicle.

2742
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:05,720
Just go to the loo and then use the
mirrors and, and, and then go at it.

2743
02:36:05,770 --> 02:36:10,030
It's just everything being for
both genders. You just make it all.

2744
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,970
Even then we get outside
a lot of problems.

2745
02:36:13,210 --> 02:36:15,700
Some people will have pushed back on that
and have other reasons why they didn't

2746
02:36:15,701 --> 02:36:15,911
like it.

2747
02:36:15,911 --> 02:36:19,990
But women don't want to be in a washroom
with men though where they already are

2748
02:36:19,991 --> 02:36:22,960
going into. If they're sharing
it, they're losing the airplane.

2749
02:36:22,961 --> 02:36:26,480
If they're sharing it in a, yeah, but
a little airplane is one, you know,

2750
02:36:26,500 --> 02:36:31,030
it's only a strong person to go in there.
I think their concern is there's,

2751
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:31,510
you know,

2752
02:36:31,510 --> 02:36:35,680
some men are fucking creeps and some
women just want to have a place where they

2753
02:36:35,681 --> 02:36:40,210
could just be themselves and check their
makeup and go to the bathroom and wash

2754
02:36:40,211 --> 02:36:45,010
and talk amongst other one. I understand
that it's just, I've, you know, um,

2755
02:36:45,011 --> 02:36:47,680
if you think about anything
that's going to change anything,

2756
02:36:47,681 --> 02:36:50,470
there's usually something that won't.
Wherever.

2757
02:36:50,471 --> 02:36:55,270
The only reason to do this
is to accommodate people
who are transgender in a way

2758
02:36:55,271 --> 02:36:58,890
that it seems like it doesn't, it doesn't
put them in a position where they,

2759
02:36:58,920 --> 02:37:02,170
they can be judged because
everyone's doing it. It makes, well,

2760
02:37:02,171 --> 02:37:06,090
if he stops bullying in
schools, then it's, it's,

2761
02:37:06,091 --> 02:37:09,640
it's a number of things in there
that, that, that it can make easier.

2762
02:37:09,641 --> 02:37:12,820
It just makes a whole,
whole area of things a lot easier.

2763
02:37:13,490 --> 02:37:16,500
How would it stop bullying? I don't
know what it has gone. I mean,

2764
02:37:16,570 --> 02:37:19,620
I'm just giving you the
figures kind. I said, well,

2765
02:37:19,670 --> 02:37:23,180
they just said that they tried it in
the school and the bullying went down.

2766
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:25,900
She has his gills and his boys together
and it's like boys are bullied.

2767
02:37:25,900 --> 02:37:27,990
The boys or girls are believe
the girls, but if you, yeah.

2768
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:31,690
So it's to have them all together.
They don't, it seems so now I,

2769
02:37:31,810 --> 02:37:34,490
it's just punished the creeps,
which is really what you, I mean,

2770
02:37:34,491 --> 02:37:37,060
if someone's being a creep in a bathroom,
that the problem is the creep.

2771
02:37:37,070 --> 02:37:41,060
It's not the bathroom. Right?
Yeah. Yeah. It's, um, anyway,

2772
02:37:41,061 --> 02:37:42,530
so this is a,
you know,

2773
02:37:42,560 --> 02:37:46,790
I haven't scientifically proved this
with chemicals and at a slide rule or

2774
02:37:46,791 --> 02:37:47,181
whatever,

2775
02:37:47,181 --> 02:37:52,160
but it's an idea that gets to us to
a better place and surely we're all

2776
02:37:52,161 --> 02:37:56,630
somewhere on the spectrum of
something. So the idea that, um,

2777
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:01,970
that anyone who is expressing
themselves in a different way,

2778
02:38:01,971 --> 02:38:06,660
that that is a problem.
If you take it back just straight period.

2779
02:38:06,950 --> 02:38:09,590
If we all went back to how we used to
think that there was just men and women

2780
02:38:09,591 --> 02:38:12,770
and everyone had strikes,
sex, uh, even s that sex,

2781
02:38:12,890 --> 02:38:16,650
that when we talk about that people
Victorian Age, your quiver Victorian age.

2782
02:38:16,900 --> 02:38:19,770
Now when we're talking about that,
that was all horrible. Sex was a,

2783
02:38:19,800 --> 02:38:24,740
procreation was the whole
idea of everything. So if you,

2784
02:38:25,190 --> 02:38:29,000
I'm trying to get out to a practical
place where people just go to the loo and

2785
02:38:29,001 --> 02:38:31,820
behave like adults, even the kids
have to behave more like adults,

2786
02:38:31,821 --> 02:38:36,410
which is interesting. That
makes, that makes sense. I
see what you're saying. Yeah.

2787
02:38:36,520 --> 02:38:39,080
And me. Yeah. That is the
concern, right? Was it,

2788
02:38:39,081 --> 02:38:42,620
we have a system in place and
someone tries to change the system,

2789
02:38:42,980 --> 02:38:46,730
then people get upset that the trench and
that always happens. Yeah. I mean, uh,

2790
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:51,140
but also women do queue forever and men
don't queue at all. Right. Q much less.

2791
02:38:51,170 --> 02:38:54,900
But this makes it so easy. It makes
it queuing even evens that out. So

2792
02:38:57,290 --> 02:38:59,780
like an at all.
It's just a toilet.

2793
02:38:59,930 --> 02:39:02,620
The Romans used to have it with
open plan toilets, then have a chat.

2794
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,670
I've seen that we have
made it into a problem.

2795
02:39:04,671 --> 02:39:08,210
We have made this a
whole psychological brom,

2796
02:39:08,211 --> 02:39:10,280
whether I'm just sit down there
and have a pool and have a chat.

2797
02:39:10,370 --> 02:39:15,370
And once they did make it a problem
and categorize people by gender,

2798
02:39:15,840 --> 02:39:19,010
then it became this thing. And now you
don't want to change that. Well, yeah,

2799
02:39:19,011 --> 02:39:21,970
I don't think that they might've had
many male and female toys in the room at

2800
02:39:21,971 --> 02:39:24,230
times, but it just, the fact that
they were more open about the idea,

2801
02:39:24,231 --> 02:39:26,540
there's bodily functions and
just normal. And we've, you know,

2802
02:39:26,541 --> 02:39:31,541
back before we came in and we were just
going out into the woods and the forest

2803
02:39:31,791 --> 02:39:35,030
and having a pool and it was just
having a pool and now we feel it's a big

2804
02:39:35,510 --> 02:39:37,530
problem having a, we don't
like it, the fact we it,

2805
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:39,740
but we don't want to admit that
we have the PR does the Queen,

2806
02:39:39,741 --> 02:39:40,370
they've have a poop.

2807
02:39:40,370 --> 02:39:45,110
Maybe Nafa has the attitude
be besides the marathon thing,

2808
02:39:45,180 --> 02:39:50,180
has the attitude culturally shifted in
the UK the same way it shifted in America

2809
02:39:50,331 --> 02:39:51,380
where people are more,

2810
02:39:51,650 --> 02:39:56,650
I think the more there's more and
more people are out and a positive.

2811
02:39:56,841 --> 02:40:00,200
I mean you've basically
got two from every group.

2812
02:40:00,201 --> 02:40:03,030
This is ethnic groups is from women.
This is from any one that,

2813
02:40:03,230 --> 02:40:06,260
that feels slightly out of the loop.
If you can have a pause,

2814
02:40:06,290 --> 02:40:09,770
any positive role models that go out
there that do other things, you know,

2815
02:40:09,771 --> 02:40:11,390
just something that's
nothing to do with sexuality.

2816
02:40:11,630 --> 02:40:13,980
You're very good at cooking
on television for this.

2817
02:40:14,100 --> 02:40:17,970
It tends to be television helps. Um,
you great sports star, you're this,

2818
02:40:17,971 --> 02:40:19,740
you're that.
Those things people say,

2819
02:40:19,741 --> 02:40:22,650
well there's a positive role model and
they are of a different color or of a

2820
02:40:22,651 --> 02:40:24,160
different sexuality or their,
you know,

2821
02:40:24,450 --> 02:40:28,200
and that just helps everyone
adjust their mindset.

2822
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:29,670
And the younger people
come through and they, oh,

2823
02:40:29,690 --> 02:40:32,100
that's all they know and
know about this person.

2824
02:40:32,310 --> 02:40:37,080
I mean like you know in
baseball you see the Bait,

2825
02:40:37,081 --> 02:40:41,430
that famous documentary baseball,
the Ken Burns, Ken Burns one,

2826
02:40:41,431 --> 02:40:44,810
and that black people after the civil war,

2827
02:40:44,830 --> 02:40:46,450
black people were playing baseball.

2828
02:40:46,451 --> 02:40:48,090
And then there was some
guy who was very powerful.

2829
02:40:48,091 --> 02:40:51,390
He said there will be no black
people in major leagues at all.

2830
02:40:51,391 --> 02:40:55,500
And it was blocked from about
1890 something like this,

2831
02:40:55,501 --> 02:41:00,501
all the way through to 1950s so it was
actually happening and then it went

2832
02:41:01,741 --> 02:41:04,850
backwards. So there was a
positive role then. Well,

2833
02:41:06,090 --> 02:41:07,200
why over that happen?

2834
02:41:07,201 --> 02:41:11,190
Things can go backwards and things go
forwards and I just think if we're trying

2835
02:41:11,191 --> 02:41:15,000
to get to a world where everyone's
live in that live, yeah,

2836
02:41:15,270 --> 02:41:18,570
that's really what we need, right? It's
just live and let live live in that songs,

2837
02:41:18,571 --> 02:41:20,670
you're not interfering
with other people's lives.

2838
02:41:20,700 --> 02:41:23,520
You long as you're not doing something
that somehow or another fucks with

2839
02:41:23,521 --> 02:41:27,840
someone else. Like who cares?
Why would anyone care? I mean,

2840
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:30,780
I think people care because
they're unhappy with themselves.

2841
02:41:30,781 --> 02:41:33,690
I think that's the only
time people care and let my,

2842
02:41:34,410 --> 02:41:39,180
my issue with this that I've
come across is with athletes.

2843
02:41:39,480 --> 02:41:42,000
It's with transgender athletes
competing against women,

2844
02:41:42,030 --> 02:41:46,980
particularly in my field and fighting.
Right. Um, there's been some,

2845
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:52,050
there have been at least there was one
very vocal case when we're very public

2846
02:41:52,051 --> 02:41:57,000
case of a transgender athlete
who was a male for 30 plus years,

2847
02:41:57,001 --> 02:41:59,880
transitioned over for a couple of years,
for two years, and then started fighting.

2848
02:41:59,881 --> 02:42:04,881
Women didn't tell them that she used to
be a man and it became a giant issue and

2849
02:42:06,691 --> 02:42:08,400
people were outraged and anger.

2850
02:42:08,490 --> 02:42:13,170
The women who got beat up or angry cause
they got destroyed. Two of them did.

2851
02:42:13,350 --> 02:42:14,400
And then she started,

2852
02:42:14,470 --> 02:42:17,850
then she was public about it and then
started fighting women that were willing

2853
02:42:17,970 --> 02:42:19,890
and new.
You've got to say things upfront.

2854
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:24,420
I came out that long ago because I wanted
to be up front about things. So yeah.

2855
02:42:24,470 --> 02:42:28,110
And I don't have the great answers. I've
been, I've balanced with everything.

2856
02:42:28,470 --> 02:42:29,740
But yeah,
I can see that.

2857
02:42:30,150 --> 02:42:33,770
One of the interesting things about
it is that there are no real answers,

2858
02:42:33,780 --> 02:42:37,050
that it's one of those things where you
just got to go home. What do we do here?

2859
02:42:37,170 --> 02:42:37,980
And this is,

2860
02:42:37,980 --> 02:42:42,980
this is what I think one of the more
unique things about being a person is that

2861
02:42:43,381 --> 02:42:48,381
we have this opportunity to look at this
unusual circumstance and communicate

2862
02:42:48,661 --> 02:42:52,290
about it and try to figure it out.
Communication, the whole thing.

2863
02:42:52,291 --> 02:42:56,250
I just knew my personal thing. If I came
out, if we started talking about it,

2864
02:42:56,251 --> 02:43:00,420
we'd get in a better place than not
talking about it and just saying it's a

2865
02:43:00,421 --> 02:43:04,890
negative. She came out to to give you a
feeling of relief. Unbelievable. I mean,

2866
02:43:05,120 --> 02:43:08,640
you know Skype, you know, cause you've
got the secret. And the secret is,

2867
02:43:09,180 --> 02:43:12,910
is I did self analysis. I lay on a bed
and said, why am I thinking this way?

2868
02:43:12,911 --> 02:43:15,890
What is going on? Why do I get them?
What are the thoughts? Like what, what?

2869
02:43:18,040 --> 02:43:20,950
Yeah. So I, okay, here's
the clearest way I can

2870
02:43:22,660 --> 02:43:26,660
show it. Uh, there was a woman on
television, you said, my daughter,

2871
02:43:26,661 --> 02:43:29,250
she was 12 and she was upstairs,
she was wearing my makeup,

2872
02:43:29,270 --> 02:43:32,800
she's wearing my heels and I told her to
get that stuff off. What are you doing?

2873
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:36,970
She said to her daughter who's 12 and
that was from an age point of view and I

2874
02:43:36,971 --> 02:43:39,530
just thought, well that's what I'd be
doing at 12. That's what I was doing,

2875
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:42,370
my stepmother's clothes and stuff.
So I thought well hang on,

2876
02:43:42,371 --> 02:43:47,080
I'm having exactly the same desire
to express myself in that way.

2877
02:43:47,110 --> 02:43:51,070
So I just wanted to express myself in
that way. And I was told like my society,

2878
02:43:51,100 --> 02:43:56,080
you're not allowed to. And I
just thought, well you know,

2879
02:43:56,410 --> 02:43:59,950
some people are allowed to and I'm not,
I've decided, I gave myself permission,

2880
02:43:59,970 --> 02:44:03,040
I said that I'm allowed to and
it's not hurting anyone else.

2881
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:06,310
And I was stealing the makeup and after
that I started buying the record cause

2882
02:44:06,311 --> 02:44:07,144
the police got me,

2883
02:44:08,320 --> 02:44:11,440
he got caught stealing makeup and I go
back into the shopping Bexhill on and I

2884
02:44:11,441 --> 02:44:14,320
say, I used to buy this
lipstick. Thank you very much.

2885
02:44:15,990 --> 02:44:20,950
I think I probably say, yeah, it's him
again with a bloody lipstick. Um, so, uh,

2886
02:44:21,430 --> 02:44:25,080
yeah, it's, it's, you just had this
desire to express yourself in a way,

2887
02:44:25,480 --> 02:44:27,570
just like some women do and some
we've been done and somebody said,

2888
02:44:27,580 --> 02:44:29,900
I don't even wear any makeup, not going
to pay me. And I was not going to do it.

2889
02:44:30,820 --> 02:44:35,650
And if I had, if I look
very female, then I would,

2890
02:44:35,980 --> 02:44:39,400
I would, might wear different things
or express herself in a different way.

2891
02:44:39,401 --> 02:44:43,720
But I'm, I look kind of more
boyish, more male ish. So I,

2892
02:44:44,230 --> 02:44:48,940
I have to, you know, I choose
certain clothes at and look, um,

2893
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:53,350
and I, and I do it that way and a number,
quite a lot of people are sort of going,

2894
02:44:53,351 --> 02:44:56,350
okay, fairplay that seems okay and
you're looking fairly well put together.

2895
02:44:56,980 --> 02:45:01,210
That's, that's what I get to.
So when you finally came out,

2896
02:45:01,211 --> 02:45:05,530
the relief though, did she could
just be yourself? Yeah. Just,

2897
02:45:06,020 --> 02:45:09,010
and you did, and you don't tend to look
terrible when you first come and you go,

2898
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:12,120
well that doesn't work with that. Why
was I wearing that? That's correct.

2899
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:15,370
But you've never had that teenage girl
chance to be able to try things out and

2900
02:45:15,371 --> 02:45:18,850
have your peer groups like you're
not wearing that cause that's okay.

2901
02:45:18,851 --> 02:45:21,370
So then I gradually led to,
okay, how does make it work?

2902
02:45:21,371 --> 02:45:23,710
Then how could that how it works?
So you gradually get better at things.

2903
02:45:23,711 --> 02:45:27,400
Don't buy that. That color doesn't work.
Oh, it can wait. But if you, you know, so,

2904
02:45:27,520 --> 02:45:32,500
but the relief is huge because you no
longer got this hellish secret and then

2905
02:45:32,530 --> 02:45:34,030
you can begin the dialogue.
I hadn't,

2906
02:45:34,220 --> 02:45:37,540
didn't really have a dialogue with anyone
at that point, but on stage I could.

2907
02:45:39,240 --> 02:45:43,000
I have friends that are in the closet
and they don't know what to do and they

2908
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:46,780
even comedian friends that
they don't talk about it,

2909
02:45:46,781 --> 02:45:51,370
they hide it and I'm like,
God, if you just let it go,

2910
02:45:51,850 --> 02:45:55,030
I mean people in this day and age,
the people that will accept you,

2911
02:45:55,330 --> 02:45:59,020
that's the people you want anyway.
The people that don't accept you,

2912
02:45:59,021 --> 02:46:01,840
you don't want them like
that's their own problem.

2913
02:46:01,960 --> 02:46:03,370
It's this live and let live thing.

2914
02:46:03,371 --> 02:46:07,360
The people that don't want you to be
who you actually are to fit their own

2915
02:46:07,361 --> 02:46:10,130
narrative in their own head.
Like those people are the crazy

2916
02:46:10,130 --> 02:46:13,760
ones. It's not you. Yeah, it's
really obvious there are gay people.

2917
02:46:13,910 --> 02:46:15,680
It's really obvious they
were transgender people.

2918
02:46:15,681 --> 02:46:18,100
It's really obvious they're not,
no one's just making this stuff

2919
02:46:18,420 --> 02:46:21,570
back through history as well as forever.
And also I think I try,

2920
02:46:21,600 --> 02:46:24,090
I say quite often,

2921
02:46:24,091 --> 02:46:27,770
you know it's a genetic thing cause I
don't, I didn't feel like got out were,

2922
02:46:27,990 --> 02:46:31,100
you know when I was 23 and a half and
I said I think I've old become the old

2923
02:46:31,110 --> 02:46:32,440
transgender now. Yeah, no it was.

2924
02:46:32,460 --> 02:46:36,120
I was four or five when I first
knew it and it has not moved those,

2925
02:46:36,121 --> 02:46:39,330
those thoughts. That's interesting.
So I think it is for most gay,

2926
02:46:39,331 --> 02:46:42,090
lesbian people I've talked to, I just
think it's locked in. It's built in.

2927
02:46:42,091 --> 02:46:44,670
It's something you get
given these cards as I say,

2928
02:46:44,970 --> 02:46:48,190
and we're trying to be out front and
be positive and the express ourselves,

2929
02:46:48,270 --> 02:46:50,820
it only makes sense when you
look at the other variabilities,

2930
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:54,780
the, the other variables when it comes to
people's personality, their body shape,

2931
02:46:55,020 --> 02:46:58,680
their mentality, their
drive, their ambition,

2932
02:46:58,710 --> 02:47:00,060
all these different variables.

2933
02:47:00,270 --> 02:47:04,440
It only makes sense that there's feminine
and masculine variables and that these

2934
02:47:04,441 --> 02:47:08,310
shifts back and forth with certain
people and it's certain people just like

2935
02:47:08,311 --> 02:47:11,200
there is somewhere in lake where you are,
well you have boy mode,

2936
02:47:11,201 --> 02:47:12,360
mode and grow mode and I,

2937
02:47:12,630 --> 02:47:15,990
I would imagine that you talking about
it so openly and then that you're,

2938
02:47:16,320 --> 02:47:19,590
that you're just so free with it that
there's probably people out there that are

2939
02:47:19,591 --> 02:47:23,550
listening to this. They're like, God damn
it. That's me, your host. I'm the young,

2940
02:47:23,830 --> 02:47:27,310
the youngest, uh, young
people around the world.

2941
02:47:27,311 --> 02:47:30,760
I have met people who are they
talking about it in school? Actually,

2942
02:47:30,761 --> 02:47:35,230
when I came back from South Africa, my
co writer, Kelly Jones, his, he said,

2943
02:47:35,231 --> 02:47:35,741
can you go in?

2944
02:47:35,741 --> 02:47:39,130
And my daughter's in Klaus and we'd been
talking about your runs in South Africa.

2945
02:47:39,550 --> 02:47:43,540
So I went in and they could talk about
racism because I was running a salute to

2946
02:47:43,541 --> 02:47:47,530
the Mandela 27. Matthew doesn't suit
his 27 years yet to spend in prison.

2947
02:47:48,160 --> 02:47:49,180
So they could talk about racism,

2948
02:47:49,181 --> 02:47:53,460
but they could also talk about being
trans transgender or self identifying and

2949
02:47:53,560 --> 02:47:54,490
LGBT stuff.

2950
02:47:54,491 --> 02:47:58,180
Cause there was some kid in this in the
class who was already identifying what

2951
02:47:58,181 --> 02:48:02,320
did I that if I as a girl and so they
were being positive and these kids were

2952
02:48:02,321 --> 02:48:05,920
eight I think, you know, so it's,
it's way different to our childhood,

2953
02:48:05,921 --> 02:48:06,401
our childhood.

2954
02:48:06,401 --> 02:48:10,150
It was just do not talk about duty and
if you mentioned that you're going to get

2955
02:48:10,151 --> 02:48:13,570
your head kicked in by your
peer group. So, and I was all,

2956
02:48:13,610 --> 02:48:16,450
that's why I never mentioned it
at school especially, you know,

2957
02:48:16,451 --> 02:48:19,550
I fancy girl so I could just
go in that route. And uh,

2958
02:48:20,230 --> 02:48:23,440
did you run into girls and
had an issue with it? Um,

2959
02:48:26,380 --> 02:48:29,470
people that I know less of.
But if you talk about relationships,

2960
02:48:29,471 --> 02:48:33,320
it gets really tricky because yeah, it
reflects upon people's relationships, uh,

2961
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:37,390
with yourself. So, um,
but it's, it's cool.

2962
02:48:37,450 --> 02:48:41,590
And I've never, I've never been great
at relationships. That's always tricky.

2963
02:48:41,980 --> 02:48:43,420
So, well, you know,

2964
02:48:43,421 --> 02:48:46,720
if I got this career thing and I worked
at how I could work that and I can just

2965
02:48:46,721 --> 02:48:50,800
keep staying four steps ahead of the game
and I'm playing in all these countries,

2966
02:48:50,801 --> 02:48:54,000
the one doing the four
languages that, doing that. So
I've got all that. But then,

2967
02:48:54,220 --> 02:48:55,031
then had you,

2968
02:48:55,031 --> 02:48:58,730
you never really in one place to be able
to continue a ratio and then there's

2969
02:48:58,750 --> 02:49:03,160
that being transsexual and that goes on.
So that all gets complicated.

2970
02:49:03,161 --> 02:49:06,490
You can't be copied, get
everything working. No. So,

2971
02:49:06,820 --> 02:49:10,110
but I'm okay with that and
it's all good. And, uh,

2972
02:49:10,740 --> 02:49:15,210
and I enjoy things. I, I'll stage,
I try and make myself laugh.

2973
02:49:15,240 --> 02:49:18,480
This isn't uncommon. This is my trick. I
actually just try and live and I go, oh,

2974
02:49:18,481 --> 02:49:23,460
that's funny. So going off
of this, this weird trip, um,

2975
02:49:24,440 --> 02:49:27,930
uh, I'm going to tell you this, but
this is in later show in front of her,

2976
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:31,800
but I talk about Jrr Tolkien,
I talk about the imagination.

2977
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:33,990
We have written all these stories
and the animals haven't done that.

2978
02:49:34,020 --> 02:49:36,300
All the wild animals don't seem
to have written any stories.

2979
02:49:36,301 --> 02:49:37,230
I haven't heard of any good ones,

2980
02:49:37,810 --> 02:49:41,240
but we've written that Jrr Tolkien
and I say Jrr Tolkien, ar, ar,

2981
02:49:41,250 --> 02:49:42,500
ar talking was born,
Jay

2982
02:49:42,730 --> 02:49:44,290
r, r r, r, r, r, r

2983
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:47,770
are talking, you may not know this
and people are gay. Is this true?

2984
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:51,370
And it is born in bloom.
Bloemfontein South Africa, you know,

2985
02:49:51,371 --> 02:49:54,910
so he's got that and then they moved
to Birmingham in England and it's a

2986
02:49:54,911 --> 02:49:58,020
different axis of the significant next
morning that, and then beery booby comes,

2987
02:49:58,030 --> 02:50:01,210
we will look, this is to walk a dog
that was this kind of sound like this.

2988
02:50:01,630 --> 02:50:05,550
And then I said when he's five, he tends
to his mother because he realizes he's,

2989
02:50:05,650 --> 02:50:06,200
he's called

2990
02:50:06,200 --> 02:50:08,330
Jay Rrr, rrr, rrr,

2991
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:11,520
Tolkien, and he says, and his
bird, it is South African,

2992
02:50:11,521 --> 02:50:14,610
Birmingham Trang and it goes both.

2993
02:50:14,640 --> 02:50:16,860
Both a we'll calls Volos.

2994
02:50:17,470 --> 02:50:21,030
I do this strangulated accent that it's
trying to fight between South African

2995
02:50:21,031 --> 02:50:23,640
and Bourbon. And it's such a
stupid line to go on, you know,

2996
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:26,400
there's no logic to where I'm going. And
it's about as guy, what are you saying,

2997
02:50:26,430 --> 02:50:27,850
Jay? Odd, odd, odd icon, icons,

2998
02:50:27,851 --> 02:50:31,150
the standard and cause she's still in
South Africa and he's, he says you.

2999
02:50:31,550 --> 02:50:36,360
So I'm spending time going into the
sidebar, which is making me laugh.

3000
02:50:36,361 --> 02:50:39,960
And I think a lot of the audience are,
what is he, what is he wittering of that?

3001
02:50:40,550 --> 02:50:42,360
And you can't really even
hear what I'm saying,

3002
02:50:42,390 --> 02:50:44,810
but I just do this strangulated
accident and in the end he has to talk,

3003
02:50:44,811 --> 02:50:46,520
talking to Yorkshire accent too,

3004
02:50:46,580 --> 02:50:50,100
to get his mother to understand if you
could cut down the number of hours and

3005
02:50:50,101 --> 02:50:53,910
his name a becomes Jrr Tolkien.
So that's,

3006
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:55,600
that's typical of my stand.

3007
02:50:55,601 --> 02:50:59,070
That where I just go off on a tangent
to make yourself laugh and yeah.

3008
02:50:59,080 --> 02:51:03,600
And I think it's sort of funny,
a little bit more funny for me.

3009
02:51:03,630 --> 02:51:06,420
Well it's funny for you though, it's funny
for people that are listening, we just,

3010
02:51:06,421 --> 02:51:10,180
comedy is contagious. Yeah. And if
I'm, you know, the personal state,

3011
02:51:10,181 --> 02:51:12,540
it's having a good time, then the audience
would probably have a better time.

3012
02:51:12,541 --> 02:51:15,360
And this thing of it's not being locked
down that it's living and breathing in

3013
02:51:15,361 --> 02:51:18,720
front of them. They do
love that. And uh, and,

3014
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:21,960
and you put more energy into the next
bit when you go and then this and then

3015
02:51:21,961 --> 02:51:26,100
that and the other thing. Yeah. So I
do love standup cause it's, you know,

3016
02:51:26,101 --> 02:51:30,300
you can just do it and do it and you know,
there's no one,

3017
02:51:30,360 --> 02:51:33,150
when I was a double act, I wasn't
four person act. And whenever you,

3018
02:51:33,151 --> 02:51:35,790
if you're a double, even just a double
act, if you go off on a tangent,

3019
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:38,730
then you have to look across to your
partner, your partner's going, hey,

3020
02:51:38,800 --> 02:51:41,100
where are you going?
He might want to go with it.

3021
02:51:41,101 --> 02:51:43,200
You might not want to go with
it gets keep to the script,

3022
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:48,440
but on your own you could just go off.
And Lenny Bruce, you know the, the,

3023
02:51:48,441 --> 02:51:51,570
the gigs he did in front of the band.
Do you know that thing in the film,

3024
02:51:51,571 --> 02:51:55,290
that part of the film and he's trying
to make the band laugh and this is the

3025
02:51:55,291 --> 02:51:58,020
people, the raincoats in the
front and the Strip is coming on.

3026
02:51:58,380 --> 02:52:00,570
And because when we did the play,
Lenny,

3027
02:52:00,810 --> 02:52:05,280
we had a live actual jazz band on
the stage, a real good jazz musician.

3028
02:52:05,640 --> 02:52:08,380
So I was trying to make them laugh and
just the way that landing yet I would try

3029
02:52:08,381 --> 02:52:11,770
to crack them up cause I would
go off script and, and uh,

3030
02:52:11,771 --> 02:52:14,290
and I could do this and that was
just beautiful. And I, and they said,

3031
02:52:14,291 --> 02:52:17,350
you're riffing, aren't you? You're just
riffing like way roofing. And I thought,

3032
02:52:17,351 --> 02:52:18,850
Whoa, this is weird. This is,

3033
02:52:19,330 --> 02:52:24,330
it was really nice to cruise down
his life and do stand up as close,

3034
02:52:24,651 --> 02:52:26,910
closest as close to him as I could.
Even the mainstream.

3035
02:52:26,980 --> 02:52:29,980
I did the main more mainstream
stuff. And then, then, you know,

3036
02:52:30,010 --> 02:52:31,870
the really edgy stuff and
the weird stuff on the where,

3037
02:52:32,080 --> 02:52:36,640
where Jesus comes at the back and
you've got it. Pat's cathedral,

3038
02:52:36,730 --> 02:52:39,480
that whole sequence where he's got
the call, the Po call, the pokes.

3039
02:52:39,481 --> 02:52:43,060
Jesus is here and yeah,
that was fun.

3040
02:52:45,400 --> 02:52:47,650
Yeah.
I got very ill doing it.

3041
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:52,920
Oh well you started off dead naked and
then you've got, you put your clothes on,

3042
02:52:52,950 --> 02:52:56,890
then you're talking and you start going
backwards. He starts off dead. Yeah.

3043
02:52:56,891 --> 02:53:00,040
You start off dead by.
So when he killed himself in the bathroom,

3044
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:04,890
and then as you start and you're
talking to either God or, uh,

3045
02:53:04,970 --> 02:53:08,080
I think I'm talking to a judge who was
a bit like a god at the beginning of it

3046
02:53:08,081 --> 02:53:11,050
and explaining things and as I'm putting
my clothes on, so you start off naked,

3047
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:13,780
then you have simulated sex with my wife,

3048
02:53:14,150 --> 02:53:17,530
but a quarter of the way through the film.
Um,

3049
02:53:17,740 --> 02:53:20,830
so that was interested in doing that and
then you end up dying at the end of the

3050
02:53:20,831 --> 02:53:24,130
film. So it just, it took a lot
out of me. Three months of that.

3051
02:53:26,050 --> 02:53:27,010
So emotionally,

3052
02:53:27,550 --> 02:53:32,550
emotionally and physically and I've
never been ill to out of a show,

3053
02:53:32,771 --> 02:53:35,500
but it just took me down.
I just was not well enough.

3054
02:53:35,560 --> 02:53:38,200
So you think it was just
contemplating his existence,

3055
02:53:38,201 --> 02:53:42,370
his life and what he went through?
I think, I think it was, yeah.

3056
02:53:42,371 --> 02:53:46,090
I think part of his journey and also
it was physically very grueling.

3057
02:53:46,790 --> 02:53:51,280
It is mentally and physically quite
very and mentally really grueling and

3058
02:53:51,281 --> 02:53:52,900
together that it made,

3059
02:53:53,140 --> 02:53:57,070
I was knackered and I probably just
wasn't drinking of water. I should have,

3060
02:53:57,370 --> 02:54:02,290
you know, I tend to
think, um, this is a, uh,

3061
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,740
me trait definitely that I will
just carry on until I get ill.

3062
02:54:06,040 --> 02:54:09,040
I wouldn't necessarily think, okay,
you're going into a stress period now,

3063
02:54:09,310 --> 02:54:10,780
so let's get some good water on.

3064
02:54:10,781 --> 02:54:14,620
It's eat some healthy food and so that
nothing comes in and takes you out.

3065
02:54:14,770 --> 02:54:18,100
I just didn't think it was a bold,
those are where I tend to boulders.

3066
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:21,930
We just bulldoze through three hours.
Three yeah,

3067
02:54:22,390 --> 02:54:25,690
it's three o'clock o'clock there. Yeah.
I was thinking I'd have no idea how long.

3068
02:54:25,691 --> 02:54:29,530
The crazy, yeah. It's like a time warp in
here. Well then you're, you're, you're,

3069
02:54:29,590 --> 02:54:31,240
you're good at it. You're used to it. I,

3070
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:35,500
I once did a street show for
about two hours without starting,

3071
02:54:35,830 --> 02:54:38,170
which was quite a beautiful
cars on the street.

3072
02:54:38,350 --> 02:54:41,740
If you imagine that there's no
nothing and the festivals, you know,

3073
02:54:41,741 --> 02:54:43,980
they hadn't before.
And there's this place called the mounds,

3074
02:54:43,981 --> 02:54:44,950
so there's people milling around.

3075
02:54:44,951 --> 02:54:47,590
So I was almost starting a show and I
was just mucking about for two hours.

3076
02:54:47,591 --> 02:54:49,330
I was just there kind of not starting,

3077
02:54:49,331 --> 02:54:54,190
kind of starting kind of chat and kind
of playing around. Beautiful. It's,

3078
02:54:54,220 --> 02:54:57,460
I've done the most fun things on the
street because no one's in charge of

3079
02:54:57,461 --> 02:55:01,720
anything. There's just no rules. Yeah.
I, I seen Dave Chappelle do that.

3080
02:55:02,170 --> 02:55:04,010
Dave Chappelle did that in Montreal.
We

3081
02:55:04,010 --> 02:55:07,280
were doing a sub club soda and then
he came downstairs after we did a,

3082
02:55:07,340 --> 02:55:11,610
I think he was like 18 or 19 and just
took his hat off and started doing standup

3083
02:55:11,660 --> 02:55:15,860
and had people put money in the hat I
was doing stand up on the street that it

3084
02:55:15,930 --> 02:55:20,660
was pretty wild. Pretty free. I see. You
see in Washington Square Park? Yeah. Yeah.

3085
02:55:20,720 --> 02:55:23,630
Yeah. That's, um, Charlie
Burnett was famous for that.

3086
02:55:23,990 --> 02:55:25,910
Charlie Burnett was a guy who was a,

3087
02:55:25,911 --> 02:55:30,020
one of the original street standup comics
in New York and he would do that and

3088
02:55:30,021 --> 02:55:32,120
Washington square park
and gather everyone round.

3089
02:55:32,121 --> 02:55:35,060
There's video of it that
people could watch online.
He might, I think he went to,

3090
02:55:35,360 --> 02:55:37,450
he might've come over to
England at one point did he?

3091
02:55:37,640 --> 02:55:40,790
I think he might have a very, he
was brilliant, brilliant performer.

3092
02:55:40,820 --> 02:55:44,750
Really good at grabbing
people and grabbing their
attention and Dave learned a

3093
02:55:44,751 --> 02:55:49,100
lot from him. Eddie, thank you very
much, man. Thanks a lot of fun.

3094
02:55:49,101 --> 02:55:49,761
I really enjoyed it.

3095
02:55:49,761 --> 02:55:52,700
I'm really appreciate you coming here
that we got the chance to sit down.

3096
02:55:52,790 --> 02:55:53,181
Absolutely.

3097
02:55:53,181 --> 02:55:56,600
I tell people about your tour a where
they can find where you're going to be

3098
02:55:56,660 --> 02:56:00,260
tickets, all that jazz. He is
a.com that sweats happening.

3099
02:56:00,261 --> 02:56:05,261
I and I am next two and a half
months all the way up to mid July.

3100
02:56:05,781 --> 02:56:08,120
I'm around,
so a 40 cities,

3101
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:11,930
40 cities in America already
played all 50 states,

3102
02:56:12,170 --> 02:56:15,050
which is kind of beautiful. You played
Montana. I've played everywhere.

3103
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:19,160
What'd you go on? Montana? Uh, uh, I'm not
sure. What's the capital city? Billings,

3104
02:56:19,161 --> 02:56:23,050
I think, yeah. I think we play billings,
if not the only near Bozeman. Helena.

3105
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:27,560
Is that it? Yeah. What about Wyoming? He
did Wyoming. Yeah. All of them. I'm, yeah,

3106
02:56:27,561 --> 02:56:31,130
I made a point to ask a twice.
Wow. We ended up in Hawaii,

3107
02:56:31,131 --> 02:56:35,090
but every single one in clear Mississippi
and Alabama as well. That's awesome. Um,

3108
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:40,040
so, uh, everywhere, but it's, it's
nice. It's, I just love playing,

3109
02:56:40,041 --> 02:56:44,090
you know, I just love playing around the
world onward. Yeah. Good luck to you.

3110
02:56:44,091 --> 02:56:45,200
Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate you.

3111
02:56:45,390 --> 02:56:45,750
Thank you.
