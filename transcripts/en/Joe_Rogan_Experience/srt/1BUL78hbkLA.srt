00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,860
Hello Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:05,170
but then over the course
of the maybe three,

3
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,580
four or five years or so,

4
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:08,110
they started having real issues

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,820
and they don't necessarily tie that to
the Diet because they remember feeling so

6
00:00:12,821 --> 00:00:15,370
much better when they
first switched to it,

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,920
so they don't think
that what they're going,

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,660
what's happening three
or four years later,

9
00:00:19,661 --> 00:00:20,920
it could be the cause of their problems.

10
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,830
I see this all the time with
vegetarian and Vegan diets.

11
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,780
That's exactly what I want to

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,810
talk to you about in terms of that
because most people who switched to a

13
00:00:30,711 --> 00:00:32,060
vegetarian or Vegan Diet,

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,360
you're going to see some instant benefits
because of the fact that you have much

15
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:36,530
more nutrient dense foods.

16
00:00:36,531 --> 00:00:37,850
You're eating a lot of vegetables,

17
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:38,684
you're you're,

18
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,610
you're changing your die in a lot of ways
to the positive or towards a positive

19
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,530
away from what you were talking about,

20
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:48,760
those primary foods and Americans
tend to eat all the processed sugar,

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,220
all the,

22
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,060
that just nonsense and chicken tenders
and all that crap that people eat,

23
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,530
which is just so goddamn common,

24
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:55,070
right?

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,580
So automatically over that you're
going to see some longterm benefits.

26
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,960
But one of the things that I've been
reading is about people that have found

27
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:04,340
that over the longterm,

28
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,413
the lack,

29
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,360
this is contrary to what
a lot of people think.

30
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:08,750
Yeah.

31
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:12,050
Lack of saturated fat and cholesterol,

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,820
dietary cholesterol and saturated
fat leads to hormonal imbalances,

33
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,970
leads to your body having a harder time
producing sex hormones and all these

34
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:27,221
different issues with your health or
your body almost starts robbing itself to

35
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:32,330
make up for the nutritional
deficiencies of your diet.

36
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,260
Yeah,

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:33,591
yeah.

38
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,060
I mean,

39
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,490
uh,

40
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,750
we talked about this before,

41
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:38,360
but humans are animals and we're,

42
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:38,631
we're,

43
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,060
while we're omnivores and wait a minute,

44
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,810
I saw a video on youtube.

45
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,290
There's a guy that says there's
no way that we are herbivores.

46
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,420
And then if we were so fucking wacky,

47
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:48,991
dude was saying,

48
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:49,260
if we,

49
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,981
if you're really a,

50
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:50,750
an,

51
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,060
uh,

52
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,080
an Omnivore,

53
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,060
you should be able to eat a squirrel.

54
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,950
Just grab it and eat it raw and like,

55
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,813
yeah,

56
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,400
no,

57
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,490
it's just the most bizarre.

58
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,240
There's some strange arguments out there.

59
00:02:01,241 --> 00:02:04,330
It's like we shouldn't
drink milk because you know,

60
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,740
there were the only,

61
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,840
uh,

62
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,060
you know,

63
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,930
we're the only animal in nature and in
nature that drinks the milk of another

64
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:11,530
animal.

65
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:11,740
Yeah.

66
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,460
Well we're the only animal
nature that uses iPhones too.

67
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,910
I have a whole bit about this.

68
00:02:15,911 --> 00:02:17,110
It's hilarious you said that.

69
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,920
Yeah.

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,490
What else?

71
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:20,170
Appointing people do fly planes,

72
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,070
movies,

73
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:23,600
call each other on the phone and
tell each other how awesome milk is.

74
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a ridiculous argument.

75
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,893
But,

76
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,680
um,

77
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,371
so yeah,

78
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:28,204
getting back to,

79
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,110
to their ideological arguments
more than scientific.

80
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,741
Absolutely.

81
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,150
Yeah.

82
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,140
So it doesn't stand up to scrutiny,

83
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:35,650
but with,

84
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:35,950
with,

85
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,630
with a vegetarian or Vegan Diet.

86
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,730
So there's lots of different
ways to look at this.

87
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:41,710
This starting with an
evolutionary perspective,

88
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:42,760
which I was getting at.

89
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,713
Um,

90
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,550
omnivores are opportunistic.

91
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,540
They will eat whatever is available
and they'll eat the most nutrient dense

92
00:02:49,541 --> 00:02:51,550
foods that are available
if they have a choice.

93
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,361
And that's just,

94
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:52,661
again,

95
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:53,530
that's survival.

96
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,393
You know,

97
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,120
an animal that is able to utilize the
nutrients that are available in its

98
00:02:58,121 --> 00:03:02,710
environment to maximum advantage is
going to survive compared to one that

99
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,280
doesn't.

100
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,500
That's basic evolutionary theory.

101
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,393
So,

102
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,743
um,

103
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,270
if you study traditional peoples,

104
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,320
as far as I know,

105
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,680
still there's never been a traditional PE,

106
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,530
you know,

107
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,030
group that that has ever been identified
that voluntarily followed a Vegan or

108
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,460
even vegetarian diet that I know of.

109
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,650
So that should tell you
something right there.

110
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,971
And ironically,

111
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:27,640
the fact that you and I are
even having this conversation,

112
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,830
this wouldn't even be happening if
humans had not learned it's eaten meat

113
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:38,080
basically where there are
a lot of anthropologists
who now believe that eating

114
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:40,060
meat was essentially what made us human.

115
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,271
You know,

116
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:44,800
we came down out of the trees and we
developed the development of tools that

117
00:03:44,801 --> 00:03:47,410
could crack bones to give
us access to the Merrill,

118
00:03:47,411 --> 00:03:50,260
which is super nutrient
dance or to sliced meat,

119
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,260
which allowed us to be able to
digest the meat more quickly.

120
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,490
Um,

121
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,241
number one.

122
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:57,130
And then to the development of fire,

123
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,760
which allowed us to cook meat and
cooking makes the nutrients in meat more

124
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,810
bioavailable,

125
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,440
allowed us to spend less
time foraging for food.

126
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,190
So most large prime,

127
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,200
it's like gorillas or chimpanzees span
over 80% of their day foraging for food

128
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,010
because most of the foods they
eat are really not nutrient dense.

129
00:04:18,011 --> 00:04:21,430
So they have to eat a boatload of stuff
and just sit there and chew on the

130
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,770
plants all day to get enough nutrients.

131
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,480
And,

132
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:29,480
and so this evolutionary theory is that
we learn to extract and harvest much

133
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,100
more nutrient dense foods from animals,

134
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,430
fats and and other nutrients
and the meats and organ meats.

135
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,330
And we had,

136
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,530
we could then spend a lot less of
our time going around getting food,

137
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,770
which allowed us and then develop
bigger brains and you know,

138
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:49,690
become human and have this conversation
where we're talking about a vegetarian

139
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,710
and Vegan diets.

140
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,280
Yeah,

141
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
it is kind of an interesting,

142
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,530
and it's also important to differentiate
the difference between what you're

143
00:04:56,531 --> 00:05:01,300
saying is essentially this science behind
the development of the human animal,

144
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:01,600
right?

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Versus the moral and ethical debates
that lead and environmental debates,

146
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,340
which is also moral.

147
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,820
So we can,

148
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,240
we can,

149
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,530
we can talk about that too,

150
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,880
which is what influences people
to become vegetarians and vegans,

151
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,500
which I totally respect.

152
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,490
I understand what they're saying.

153
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,310
The real problem is when they distort
the reality of the scientific findings,

154
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:25,270
the human animal and diet.

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,890
And that's an issue with a lot of people
that are vegetarians and vegans that go

156
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:32,680
on about how healthy they feel
and how about how awesome,

157
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,750
but they're not doing
blood lipid profiles.

158
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,471
And when they do,

159
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:36,670
like Sam Harris,

160
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,860
who is kind of the forum
for ethical perspective,

161
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,000
for ethical reasons,

162
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,060
is tried a Vegan diet and
his health is suffering.

163
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:45,220
He's getting real issues
with his blood lipids.

164
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:45,760
Yeah.

165
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,390
What can someone do if they
want to file that diet?

166
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,071
Like what,

167
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:53,890
what is imperative as far as
healthy fats as far as getting,

168
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,230
making sure that your body doesn't have,

169
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,700
you're not taking in too many
simple carbohydrates like,

170
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,030
hey,

171
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,381
what,

172
00:05:59,381 --> 00:05:59,631
what,

173
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:01,190
what steps need to be taking place?

174
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:04,430
And this is obviously not saying
that you shouldn't fall Vegan Diet.

175
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,690
It shouldn't follow a vegetarian diet.

176
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,680
You should do whatever you want to do.

177
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,460
But there's gotta be some ways to
mitigate some of the health consequences,

178
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:10,700
right?

179
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:10,941
Yeah,

180
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,451
there are.

181
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,990
And I believe that I agree with you that
people should be free to make their own

182
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:15,711
choices.

183
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:18,260
I've never pushed a particular diet.

184
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,450
You know,

185
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,580
people sometimes ask me,

186
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,320
how do you convince someone to go Paleo?

187
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:21,800
I said,

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,633
I don't,

189
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,430
I don't spend my time doing that.

190
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:27,620
If someone wants my advice and ask me,

191
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:28,371
I'll give it to them,

192
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:32,480
but I'm not going around proselytizing
for a particular way of eating.

193
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,560
Um,

194
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:33,981
so yeah,

195
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,701
let's break this down.

196
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:39,500
And we talked about the evolutionary
argument for eating animal products and

197
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,820
there's a scientific argument,

198
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,870
which now is what we're
talking about the issue with.

199
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:45,890
And we should,

200
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:49,220
we should even kind of distinguish
between vegetarian and Vegan diets cause

201
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,420
they're,

202
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,990
they're actually quite different.

203
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:56,050
And I think it is possible for some people
to be healthy with a vegetarian diet.

204
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,790
I think it's a lot less
likely with the Vegan Diet.

205
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,980
And I guess I would say it this way.

206
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,150
Um,

207
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,740
if you have,

208
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,730
if you're Vegan and you're
eating a Vegan Diet,

209
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,060
you need to have a perfect vegan diet
to be healthy and you need to know what

210
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:14,810
you're doing in terms of supplementation
and how to meet the nutrient needs that

211
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:16,100
aren't being met through diet.

212
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,530
And at least in my experience,

213
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:20,540
there are very few that
actually do it right.

214
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:21,883
Um,

215
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,480
when it's done right,

216
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:25,880
I think it's possible
for some people to be,

217
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,300
to,

218
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,350
to be healthy and thrive.

219
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:31,550
And that's obvious because
there are people like rich
roll who's like out there.

220
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,840
He's a Vegan triathlete who's out
there doing centuries and killing it,

221
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,933
ultra marathon.

222
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,940
He is just an amazing
athlete and he's Vegan.

223
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:41,451
And so,

224
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:42,021
you know,

225
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:46,490
you can't say that it's not working for
it and you can try to say that you're

226
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:46,910
going help.

227
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,950
So it looks like he's
30 years older than me.

228
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,550
Yeah,

229
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,250
he's a,

230
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,041
he's a great guy.

231
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,360
I've met him a couple of times.

232
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,253
Um,

233
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,970
and uh,

234
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:56,721
so it certainly,

235
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:57,650
it works for some people,

236
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:01,430
but there are a lot of factors that
determine whether it's going to work.

237
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:05,570
So one is how well you
do it too is you know,

238
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:06,860
whether you know what you're dealing with,

239
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:09,620
supplementation in terms of
getting the necessary nutrients.

240
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,420
Three is genetics.

241
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,160
So let me,

242
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:18,250
there are genetic differences that
determine how well we convert precursor

243
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:21,140
nutrients into the nutrients
that we actually need.

244
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:23,420
And let me give three examples
to make this more real.

245
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,390
So one is EPA and Dha.

246
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:29,660
These are these long chain of mega three
fats that we've heard so much about

247
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:31,290
that are crucial for brain function,

248
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,540
cardiovascular function,

249
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:33,320
et cetera.

250
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,490
And we primarily,

251
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,200
you get them by eating fish.

252
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,590
There are no sources of those in a
plant based diet except for algae.

253
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,120
Um,

254
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,320
but an algae is not the bioavailable.

255
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,110
And how many people do
know that eat algae?

256
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,190
I don't know.

257
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,050
I mean we can,

258
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,980
you can cause that famous
green supplementation stuff is,

259
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,900
you can use it as a supplement
but very few people are eating it.

260
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,763
So,

261
00:08:58,820 --> 00:08:59,430
um,

262
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,850
but you,

263
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,280
but there is something
called Alpha linolenic acid,

264
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,110
which is in walnuts and flax seed.

265
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:06,680
That's an a mega three plant fat and,

266
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,640
and humans in theory can convert some of
that plant based Omega Three into this

267
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:14,280
long chain EPA and Dha that we need.

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,210
But the thing,

269
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,043
here's the thing,

270
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:21,230
only about five to 10% of that gets
converted into EPA and even less to Dha,

271
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:22,500
like two to 5%.

272
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,560
So you have to be chugging tablespoons
of flax oil in order to get as much EPA

273
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:31,440
or Dha Epa that you would get from
eating just a little bit of fish.

274
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,600
And that's if everything is going well,

275
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,560
because if you have deficiency of any
nutrients that are involved in the

276
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:41,460
enzymatic conversion of those plant
based fats into the long chain fats,

277
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,370
then you won't make those
conversions at that optimal rate.

278
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:45,480
It'll be even less.

279
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,651
And ironically,

280
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:50,430
many of those nutrients are nutrients
that are not well represented in a Vegan

281
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,960
or vegetarian diet.

282
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,760
So that's one example.

283
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,530
Another would be vitamin K two,

284
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,250
which is uh,

285
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,810
uh,

286
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,760
a different form of vitamin K
that's recently been discovered.

287
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,540
And it's really important for
cardiovascular and bone health.

288
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:05,490
It basically puts,

289
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,850
make sure that calcium gets in our bones
and our teeth and our heart tissues

290
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:12,510
where it belongs and keeps it out of
the soft tissues like our arteries where

291
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,170
calcium would make our arteries hard and
increased the risk of a heart attack.

292
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,400
So,

293
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,000
um,

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
k two is only really in animal foods with
the exception of some fermented foods

295
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,090
like Natto,

296
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:29,090
which is a Japanese fermented soybean
product that most people cannot stand.

297
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,000
Um,

298
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,310
it's,

299
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,500
it's a strong taste.

300
00:10:31,501 --> 00:10:33,210
Not very many people are eating it here.

301
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:33,990
Uh,

302
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,130
Kufier and,

303
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,040
and Sauerkraut and Kimchi have,

304
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,880
have k,

305
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,713
k two in it.

306
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,920
Kaffir I've been saying
Kiefer my whole life,

307
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,080
that's how I've never heard it.

308
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:44,430
So that's how they say it,

309
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,720
where [inaudible] is from.

310
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:49,070
Every other person I've
ever met says Kiefer,

311
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,831
so don't worry about it.

312
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:50,650
Okay.

313
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,650
And could fear from Nolan fear
you'll be in the select few,

314
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,281
but no,

315
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,980
honestly I feel good about it already.

316
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,410
So yes,

317
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,430
you can feel superior.

318
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,070
Now,

319
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,590
can I stop you real quick
just because we're going to,

320
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,440
I want to get a little bit,

321
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,830
um,

322
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,060
uh,

323
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,020
onto this track of what
you were describing.

324
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:10,710
Boats,

325
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,060
fish oil and conversion and the
difference between flax seed oil.

326
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:15,550
What,

327
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,550
what can vegans take in order to sort of
recommend that vegans take micro algae

328
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:24,360
because it has preformed Dha in it.

329
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:29,520
So you bypass that whole conversion
issue and if they do take micro algae,

330
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:33,480
is that sufficient or how much
different is that than eating fish?

331
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:33,980
Well,

332
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,160
it's quite different because fish have
a lot of other nutrients aside from EPA

333
00:11:38,161 --> 00:11:39,000
and Dha.

334
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,130
They routine,

335
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,310
they have selenium,

336
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,890
they have a lot of other
bioavailable nutrients.

337
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:44,220
But,

338
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,850
but,

339
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,660
and the other disadvantage is
you have to take a boat load of,

340
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,760
of LG boatload.

341
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,603
Give me a,

342
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,313
uh,

343
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:53,883
I think so.

344
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,230
There are different products
have different amounts,

345
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,350
but um,

346
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,611
you know,

347
00:11:57,611 --> 00:12:02,611
I think you'd have to take six to nine
cups a capsules a day of the average

348
00:12:03,521 --> 00:12:06,070
algae supplement in
order to meet your Dha.

349
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,060
No.

350
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,550
Done.

351
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,370
It could,

352
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,630
it's absolutely possible,

353
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,110
but that would be a good way to
be healthy with the Vegan Diet.

354
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:19,111
That would be one way to address the
shortcoming of know of lack of Dha on the

355
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,050
Vegan Diet.

356
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,550
There are other shortcomings,

357
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:26,551
other nutrients like B 12 which that's
a big issue and vegans need to be

358
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:28,570
supplementing with that.

359
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,700
There's a myth out there that there are
some plant sources of B 12 like seaweed

360
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,180
and in spirit like spirulina
and nutritional yeast,

361
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,950
but those actually contain,

362
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,700
uh,

363
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,700
kind of phony forms of B 12 that that
can block the absorption of true 12,

364
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,360
which is only found in animal
products or supplements.

365
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:52,180
So a B 12 supplement
would be really important.

366
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:54,310
That's why it's the source
of a B 12 supplement.

367
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,103
Um,

368
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,063
they,

369
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,203
it's synthetic,

370
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,920
it's synthetic I think,

371
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:00,850
but they just,

372
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,960
there's three forms.

373
00:13:01,961 --> 00:13:02,800
It'd be 12.

374
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,500
There's,

375
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,300
there's hydroxy Kabbalah,

376
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:09,280
man and Methylcobalamin or f or four
forms that you can supplement with

377
00:13:09,281 --> 00:13:14,281
Cyanocobalamin and Adenosylcobalamin and
Cyanocobalamin is the synthetic form.

378
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,950
And then the other ones are natural
forms of B 12 that you would encounter in

379
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,784
food.

380
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,520
So people can supplement
with any of those.

381
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:21,880
The,

382
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,860
the natural forms are better to supplement
with cause they're more bioavailable.

383
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,200
But definitely if a Vegan,

384
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:33,520
I would recommend supplementing with B
12 because there aren't any sources of it

385
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,211
in the Diet.

386
00:13:34,211 --> 00:13:39,211
And studies have shown that 68% of
vegetarians are deficient in B 1280 3% of

387
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:43,030
vegans are versus just 5% of omnivores.

388
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,780
Wow.

389
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,800
So it's a big difference.

390
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:45,310
We're not,

391
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,143
you know,

392
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,540
and that's a factor in,

393
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:48,460
in many different issues,

394
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:48,671
right?

395
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,310
It's a factor in the production of muscle.

396
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
Uh,

397
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,000
all production of all red blood cells
depends on B12 and full eight and so on.

398
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,420
I mean that's pretty fundamental,

399
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:58,650
right?

400
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:03,650
And then the Myelin Sheath requires be
12 and this is why B 12 deficiency can

401
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:04,340
mimic the,

402
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,380
the signs of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's
to these and people who are aging.

403
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:11,380
B 12 deficiency happens in elderly people,

404
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,430
not because they're on a
vegan diet because they have
low stomach acid and they

405
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,310
don't absorb the B 12 as well
as we do when we're younger.

406
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,870
And so a lot of people who are elderly
who have no symptoms of Parkinson's or

407
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:23,704
Alzheimer's,

408
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,760
they can sometimes be misdiagnosed with
these conditions when they're actually

409
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:28,900
just be 12 deficient.

410
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:29,763
So it's a series.

411
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,521
It's a real,

412
00:14:30,521 --> 00:14:31,720
really important nutrient.

413
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:37,030
How can vegans be assured that the B12
that they're buying does not have a

414
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:38,650
animal products?

415
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,060
Uh,

416
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:40,361
we do.

417
00:14:40,361 --> 00:14:45,361
Do they have B12 when you bind a
supplement that typically it's usually a,

418
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,280
I'm not the best person to
ask about that because I'm,

419
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,750
I'm not a Vegan myself.

420
00:14:49,751 --> 00:14:51,920
I was a macrobiotic at one point.

421
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,670
What does that mean?

422
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,331
What's the difference?

423
00:14:53,331 --> 00:14:54,164
That's deep,

424
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,273
deep

425
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,890
macrame macrobiotics is that is a whole
nother system of way of looking at

426
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:02,690
foods,

427
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:03,560
a job and you know,

428
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:03,820
uh,

429
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,850
Japanese,

430
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,780
uh,

431
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,060
approach and um,

432
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,013
you know,

433
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,700
the whole reason I came
to do what I'm doing now.

434
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,800
So I got really,

435
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:17,801
really sick and my twenties I almost died
and I spent about 10 years just trying

436
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:18,890
to get back to health.

437
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,120
What did you pick from?

438
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,070
I was in Indonesia.

439
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:23,631
I mentioned earlier,

440
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:27,890
I'd traveled around the world and I was
surfing and I got the classic tropical

441
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:28,361
illness.

442
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,200
It's like immediate dysentery,

443
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,230
Giardia and blastocystis hominis so to
parasites and an Amoeba and was just,

444
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:36,890
you know,

445
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,150
coming out of both ends,

446
00:15:38,151 --> 00:15:38,931
delirious,

447
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,270
didn't remember really
anything for three days.

448
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,380
Um,

449
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,380
luckily there was one other Australian
guy in the village that I was in who had

450
00:15:47,481 --> 00:15:50,930
some antibiotics in his medical kit that
kind of brought me back from the brink,

451
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,230
but,

452
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:52,640
um,

453
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,210
between the parasites and
then the multiple rounds of
antibiotics I had to take

454
00:15:56,211 --> 00:15:58,010
to get rid of the parasites after that,

455
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,970
it just wreaked havoc on my gut and it
took me basically 10 years to recover my

456
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,950
Ho yeah,

457
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:05,720
10 years.

458
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,810
It was like the last decade when I was
at 10 years because you approached it in

459
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:15,620
correctly and you could do it better now
or was it just such a devastating round

460
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:17,900
of disease that I think a little of both.

461
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,231
I mean,

462
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:18,801
so I was,

463
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,801
I'm 42 now and I was 25 when this first
happened and we didn't know anything

464
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,590
about the gut and the microbiome
compared to what we know now.

465
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,000
There was very little
awareness on this topic,

466
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:30,981
that point.

467
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:31,161
Yeah.

468
00:16:31,161 --> 00:16:32,240
Just in 15 years,

469
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:32,721
it's just,

470
00:16:32,721 --> 00:16:33,441
or 20 years.

471
00:16:33,441 --> 00:16:33,670
It's,

472
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,520
it's crazy.

473
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,080
So,

474
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:36,291
you know,

475
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:41,291
I took way more antibiotics than I would
have done in retrospect because that's

476
00:16:41,691 --> 00:16:43,820
what the doctors were
prescribing and saying,

477
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:44,031
look,

478
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,010
you've got these parasites,

479
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,040
we've got to get rid of them.

480
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,120
This is how you do it.

481
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:48,140
And you know,

482
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,760
and I think the antibiotics,

483
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:54,050
if it could have been like the treatment
was probably worse than the disease for

484
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:54,550
me,

485
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:54,830
you know,

486
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:57,350
after the number of courses
of antibiotics that I took.

487
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,250
Wow.

488
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,250
So along that path I tried to out every
special diet you can possibly imagine

489
00:17:03,381 --> 00:17:07,130
including becoming a vegetarian
and a Vegan and then a macrobiotic,

490
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:08,840
Vegan and raw food vegan.

491
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,701
I've been there,

492
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,420
done that.

493
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,470
And um,

494
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:15,350
so I'm completely sympathetic like to all,

495
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,830
and I'm also a longtime
meditater and Buddhist.

496
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:21,500
So I understand the
ethical argument very well.

497
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,030
Many of my friends don't eat meat.

498
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,720
I'm sympathetic and I care
about the environment.

499
00:17:26,721 --> 00:17:28,310
I'm sympathetic to that argument.

500
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,750
I'm certainly not,

501
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,250
you know,

502
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,120
I'm coming to this from a place of
I think a pretty balanced viewpoint.

503
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,133
Um,

504
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,480
and uh,

505
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,493
the,

506
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,770
the issues for me,

507
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,930
the reason why I eventually brought
animal products back into my diet with the

508
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,660
Aye,

509
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,350
Aye.

510
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,620
It became clear that I needed to do
that for my own health and I was able to

511
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:54,030
reach a level of

512
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,880
understanding and,

513
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,271
uh,

514
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,350
about the moral,

515
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:01,320
ethical and environmental
choices that I was making.

516
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,000
Um,

517
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,360
that,

518
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,330
that I felt good about.

519
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,310
I want to go back to something
you were saying about the,

520
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,810
you know,

521
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,280
vegans and vegetarians and how to kind
of optimize if you're doing that diet.

522
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,090
So,

523
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:12,750
um,

524
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,540
two things that wanted to address.

525
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,260
One was you asked about mollusks.

526
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,710
I've actually argued that a vegetarian
diet with shellfish and organ meats would

527
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:26,880
be better than a Paleo Diet with
no shellfish and organ meats.

528
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,073
Interesting.

529
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,120
And that's because of what
we talked about earlier.

530
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,140
Muscle meats,

531
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,860
organ meats and shellfish are the two
most nutrient dance classes of foods.

532
00:18:36,871 --> 00:18:37,810
Like I,

533
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,270
I've just been finishing the curriculum
from my clinician training program where

534
00:18:42,271 --> 00:18:42,990
I'm,

535
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:43,823
um,

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,490
you know,

537
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,340
going through systematically
every nutrient and I'm looking at,

538
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:47,900
uh,

539
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,610
in nutrition data what the most,

540
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,950
the highest food sources
of those nutrients are.

541
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:53,784
And again,

542
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,490
I wish I had the thing to
just lay it out and show you.

543
00:18:56,491 --> 00:18:57,324
But you know,

544
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,070
in almost every case it's an organ meat
or a shellfish that's the highest source

545
00:19:02,071 --> 00:19:02,371
of that,

546
00:19:02,371 --> 00:19:07,371
whether you're talking about be 12 or
iron or copper or zinc or full eight.

547
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,850
It's always beef,

548
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:09,241
liver,

549
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:09,631
chicken,

550
00:19:09,631 --> 00:19:10,111
liver,

551
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:10,890
clams,

552
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,641
oysters,

553
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:12,474
et cetera.

554
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,720
And so if someone was a veggie vegetarian
who's willing to fudge a little bit

555
00:19:18,361 --> 00:19:20,550
and eat just organ meats and shellfish,

556
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:20,790
they,

557
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,450
I think that would be a healthier approach
than someone who's just eating lean

558
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,613
muscle meat.

559
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:26,150
Um,

560
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,740
organs get tossed out a lot.

561
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,220
It's a,

562
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,053
it's really,

563
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,760
it's a real problem in
the hunting world where,

564
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,270
um,

565
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,520
when people got an animal,

566
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,050
they leave the gut pile.

567
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,410
And there's even a gutless method
that a lot of people use when the,

568
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:39,670
uh,

569
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,960
they take on a big game animal,

570
00:19:41,961 --> 00:19:43,190
like an elk or something like that.

571
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,000
They just,

572
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,020
they leave it behind.

573
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:45,740
They leave the heart,

574
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,573
they leave the liver.

575
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:50,960
But I saw this documentary on wolves and
was really fascinating was one of the

576
00:19:50,961 --> 00:19:53,040
ways that they distinguish
who the alpha is.

577
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:56,360
And then wolf pack is the Alpha
Wolf is the one who eats the liver,

578
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,820
the liver and the fascinating.

579
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,270
There are other animals that that's true.

580
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,840
And I think that was true in a
hunter gather societies as well.

581
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:04,310
And someone was trying to say to me,

582
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:04,701
well,

583
00:20:04,701 --> 00:20:06,290
we'll livers process toxins.

584
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,880
Don't you think they'd
be filled with toxins?

585
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:08,720
That's a common

586
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,470
misconception.

587
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,670
The liver processes then,

588
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:11,150
but this,

589
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,380
the fat stores them.

590
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,160
So if you're concerned
about toxins in food,

591
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,840
you should make sure that you're eating
pasture raised organic fats like butter

592
00:20:20,841 --> 00:20:21,770
and cream and things.

593
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:22,880
If you eat dairy products,

594
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,013
animal fats,

595
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:24,860
grass fed,

596
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:26,120
grass fed butter,

597
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,200
uh,

598
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,720
if you eat lard or tallow
or anything like that,

599
00:20:29,721 --> 00:20:33,230
it should come from pasture raised animals
because the fat is where toxins are

600
00:20:33,231 --> 00:20:33,710
stored,

601
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,470
the liver processes then um,

602
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,100
so when you're,

603
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,200
I'm sorry to interrupt you boat.

604
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,410
So when you're eating anything that comes
from an animal that's been fed grain,

605
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:47,350
you're dealing with an animal that has
the same sort of inflammation issues a

606
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:48,190
person has

607
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,390
from processing things that it's not
naturally supposed to process like pat

608
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:57,420
processed wheat and the bleached flour
and things besides antibiotic residue.

609
00:20:59,230 --> 00:20:59,710
Right?

610
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,220
Yeah.

611
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,930
So when you're taking in those animal
products that we traditionally do,

612
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:08,440
whether it's butter or milk or dairy
or cheese or things along those lines,

613
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,020
when you're taking those from
an animal that's eating grain,

614
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,270
you are actually getting the fats.

615
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,021
So your,

616
00:21:14,021 --> 00:21:14,410
your,

617
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,590
it's less healthy than actually
eating the liver of that animal.

618
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,320
Yeah,

619
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,080
I would,

620
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,913
it may be.

621
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,360
I mean the liver is more
nutrient dense anyways,

622
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,980
but um,

623
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,830
pasture is animal fats,

624
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,340
uh,

625
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,060
have a lot more nutrients
than conventionally raised
fats because the animals

626
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:35,470
are eating grass and grasses way more
nutrient dense than the grains that you

627
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:35,620
know,

628
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,960
conventional animals are fed.

629
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,090
Also the Omega threes
and sixes are different.

630
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,590
The ratio,

631
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,570
the May mega six is the same but Omega
three is three or four times higher in

632
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:47,920
pasture raised animals.

633
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:49,120
Why does that make it six to sign?

634
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,730
It's a good question.

635
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,090
It used to be,

636
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,601
you know,

637
00:21:52,601 --> 00:21:52,720
the,

638
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:52,960
the,

639
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,960
the kind of a consensus was that Omega
sixes would be higher in Omega threes it

640
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,601
would be lower,

641
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:02,530
but actually it looks like and make a six
is constant and Omega three is higher.

642
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,330
The Omega three is higher because of the
grass probably has more alpha linolenic

643
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:07,721
acid,

644
00:22:07,721 --> 00:22:09,820
which is the plant based form that day.

645
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:11,560
Then animal does a conversion.

646
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,600
I mean that's the thing that's really
interesting to consider here too is humans

647
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:20,200
are really inefficient and making
these conversions of these less active

648
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,700
nutrients to the more active ones.

649
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:24,160
We started talking about
it with EPA and Dha,

650
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,120
k k vitamin K one is
what's converted into k.

651
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:30,820
Two cows are experts at doing that.

652
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,840
They're really good at it.

653
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,400
Humans not so much.

654
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,910
So when we eat the animal and the animal
is basically done the work for us and

655
00:22:36,911 --> 00:22:41,830
we get the preformed final nutrient that
we need rather than having to do those

656
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:43,120
steps ourselves.

657
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,710
And this is starting to rub,

658
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,190
it's just,

659
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,580
it's just a function of the adaptation
of people developing while eating these

660
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:48,941
animals.

661
00:22:48,941 --> 00:22:49,690
I think so,

662
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,440
yeah.

663
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,760
Beta carotenes and other example that's
a precursor to active vitamin A or

664
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:58,480
retinol and Beta carotenes have
some benefits in our bodies,

665
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:00,370
but retinols is the real thing.

666
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:00,790
You know what?

667
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,990
We need more than anything.

668
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,050
And uh,

669
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:06,210
that conversion is as low as
three to 5% and some people,

670
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,490
and in fact there,

671
00:23:07,491 --> 00:23:09,670
there are some who don't
make the conversion at all.

672
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,300
And those are the people who turn
orange after a carrot juice fast.

673
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,980
Ever seen anyone with
like the orange palms?

674
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,373
It happens.

675
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,370
My friend Andy used to drink so much
carrot juice that the inside of his hands

676
00:23:21,371 --> 00:23:22,700
and his skin would turn orange.

677
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,051
Yeah.

678
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:27,250
So he probably wasn't good at converting
Beta carotene into retinol because we

679
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,300
should be able to do that,

680
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:29,260
but some people can't.

681
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,050
But it isn't just the mass quantity.

682
00:23:31,051 --> 00:23:32,020
So yeah,

683
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,400
I mean it could be that too.

684
00:23:33,401 --> 00:23:34,310
But um,

685
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,030
uh,

686
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,030
the retinol is only really present in
organ meats and pasture raised fats.

687
00:23:40,871 --> 00:23:45,230
It's not even really in muscle meats
like lean ground beef or chicken breast,

688
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,700
boneless chicken breasts or,

689
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:47,750
um,

690
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,210
so in order to get retina,

691
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:53,390
we need to consume these pasture raise
fats or we need to consume Oregon means.

692
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,530
And as you pointed out,

693
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,620
the organ meats have really
fallen out of favor in the US.

694
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,880
And this is only recent,

695
00:23:58,881 --> 00:24:03,881
like I bet you our grandparents ate a
lot more organ meats then we eat still in

696
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:04,450
some,

697
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:04,670
you know,

698
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:05,570
many parts of the world.

699
00:24:05,571 --> 00:24:06,800
They still eat organ meats.

700
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,530
More try.

701
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:07,990
We do.

702
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,420
Yeah.

703
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,670
Liver and onions is a very famous dish.

704
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:11,450
Yeah.

705
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:11,810
Yeah.

706
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,470
Beef heart.

707
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,470
And so you'll see within the Paleo
primal kind of world that organ meats are

708
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,860
making a comeback because we understand
now what the nutrient density of these

709
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:24,080
foods is and there's less now,

710
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:25,550
even in the mainstream world,

711
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,320
there's less of a solid argument that can
be made about these having cholesterol

712
00:24:30,321 --> 00:24:31,130
or you know,

713
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,840
high levels of saturated fat.

714
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,130
They would prevent us from meeting them.

715
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:34,611
Now,

716
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:39,230
what would be the difference in terms
of the nutritional density of molluscs

717
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,490
versus Oregon meat?

718
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:41,660
So like if you were trying to,

719
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:45,440
if you had a vegetarian or a Vegan
is on the fence and you know,

720
00:24:45,441 --> 00:24:48,680
you made these arguments that are
very rational and logical and he said,

721
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:49,170
look,

722
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:51,380
mollusks are essentially a very,

723
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:54,590
very primitive form of life
that doesn't feel pain.

724
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:58,940
And you could argue that there's more
evidence that some plants feel pain and

725
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:02,600
plants also have some very
intense level of communication.

726
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:03,240
Where there,

727
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,560
there,

728
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,090
there's a really interesting,

729
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:05,983
uh,

730
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,260
uh,

731
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,290
addition of radio lab recently
where they went into this,

732
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,980
where they sort of are trying to
understand the difference between,

733
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:13,880
uh,

734
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,713
the,

735
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,870
not the difference rather,

736
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:16,521
but the,

737
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:16,880
the,

738
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,880
the complicated relationship between these
different plants and the mycelium and

739
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:28,010
the soil and all of the different fungus
in the soil that also acts as sort of a

740
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:31,130
transportation method for
various nutrients and minerals.

741
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,860
And they're actually pulling
these minerals out of the
rock and they're getting

742
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:36,710
sugars from the plants and they're
exchanging them for minerals.

743
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,950
And that there's this really complex
interaction that we have sort of just

744
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:42,980
looked at and said,

745
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,101
oh,

746
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,270
there's dirt and there's plants.

747
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,530
But there's a lot going on between
these various life forms and one of them

748
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,000
being fungus,

749
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:55,120
which again is closer to an animal that
it is still plant but is imperative for

750
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:56,480
the life of these plants.

751
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,830
And then somehow or another,

752
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,460
there were actually even sharing
resources where if they find,

753
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:05,660
or they're allotting resources to
certain plants that are more deficient or

754
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:07,280
they're trying to channel
resources to them.

755
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,410
So there's some form of communication.

756
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,700
And exchange here.

757
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,180
Yeah,

758
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:11,571
that's,

759
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:12,900
that's intelligence right there.

760
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,220
I mean,

761
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,840
Paul Stamets has done amazing work on,

762
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,740
um,

763
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,340
my youngest,

764
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,350
youngest in general.

765
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,220
Um,

766
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,461
yeah,

767
00:26:19,461 --> 00:26:21,380
I would say that that's
a really good option.

768
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:21,870
I mean,

769
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,703
um,

770
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,750
when you look at nutrients like specific
nutrients that it goes back and forth

771
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,950
between liver and,

772
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,420
you know,

773
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,870
Oregon meats and shellfish and some,

774
00:26:29,871 --> 00:26:30,800
some nutrients,

775
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,250
uh,

776
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,180
organ meats are higher,

777
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:36,920
like vitamin A or iron
and other nutrients.

778
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,160
Shellfish are generally higher
like with zinc or copper.

779
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,150
Um,

780
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,560
but certainly even,

781
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,260
even,

782
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,093
uh,

783
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,320
shellfish are higher in almost all
of the key nutrients that we need.

784
00:26:49,321 --> 00:26:53,550
Then a lot of the plant based food
alternatives that they would be choosing

785
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:53,911
from.

786
00:26:53,911 --> 00:26:57,930
And so if this a Vegan was willing to
eat molluscs I would say that that would

787
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:58,681
be a great idea.

788
00:26:58,681 --> 00:26:58,881
And,

789
00:26:58,881 --> 00:26:59,260
and uh,

790
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,560
the,

791
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,840
the benefit there is you don't need to
eat a lot like three ounces a single

792
00:27:03,841 --> 00:27:04,674
serving,

793
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,340
uh,

794
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:08,250
can meet your copper
requirement for the entire week.

795
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:08,941
Oh Wow.

796
00:27:08,941 --> 00:27:10,050
Just one time.

797
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,943
All the time.

798
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,233
Oysters.

799
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,920
And same with iron.

800
00:27:13,921 --> 00:27:15,570
I think if I'm going
off the top of my head,

801
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:16,560
I'll iron and zinc,

802
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,040
it can nearly meet your
entire weekly requirement.

803
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,200
So it's not like you have to
eat a ton of these things.

804
00:27:22,201 --> 00:27:22,421
You,

805
00:27:22,421 --> 00:27:22,741
you know,

806
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:26,820
you have a serving of clams once a week
and you have a serving of oysters once a

807
00:27:26,821 --> 00:27:27,654
week,

808
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,471
uh,

809
00:27:28,471 --> 00:27:28,951
you know,

810
00:27:28,951 --> 00:27:29,784
on top of,

811
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,510
uh,

812
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,880
getting as much nutrient
density as you can,

813
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,660
um,

814
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,500
that should do,

815
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:35,550
that's be 12.

816
00:27:35,551 --> 00:27:36,271
That's iron,

817
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:36,990
that sink,

818
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,980
that's copper,

819
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,600
EPA and Dha.

820
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:41,820
The launching and Omega
three fats are in these,

821
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,480
uh,

822
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,490
in these malls cause as well.

823
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,200
Uh,

824
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:45,690
and it,

825
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,450
they're typically low on the toxicity,

826
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,230
uh,

827
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:49,861
scale too.

828
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:50,530
They're not,

829
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,230
they don't tend to have a lot of mercury.

830
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:55,440
They don't bio accumulate a lot
of toxins compared to some other,

831
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,050
you know,

832
00:27:56,050 --> 00:28:00,110
Predator species of fish that are higher
in the food chain that accumulated a

833
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:01,080
lot of toxins.

834
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,400
Is there any benefit to eating them
cooked versus raw one way or the other?

835
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,361
Well,

836
00:28:06,361 --> 00:28:06,661
you know,

837
00:28:06,661 --> 00:28:07,200
there's all,

838
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,970
there is the chance of
disease and you know,

839
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:11,490
eating raw wasters.

840
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,413
Um,

841
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,390
I think it's pretty minimal
compared to some other risks,

842
00:28:15,391 --> 00:28:15,871
but it's,

843
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:16,740
it is there.

844
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,663
And cooking,

845
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:17,970
yeah.

846
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,840
Mitigates that.

847
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,191
Definitely.

848
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:22,140
I think in general,

849
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:26,850
cooking makes the nutrients in meat and
animal products more bioavailable rather

850
00:28:26,851 --> 00:28:27,684
than last.

851
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,080
Uh,

852
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,750
and that's,

853
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:28,920
and,

854
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,910
and vegetables,

855
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,570
it's,

856
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,390
it depends on the vegetable and the,

857
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:33,210
um,

858
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,380
and the method of cooking.

859
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:34,770
But,

860
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,160
uh,

861
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:35,390
it,

862
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:35,911
it's a mix.

863
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:36,840
It's more of a mixed bag,

864
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:40,530
but with [inaudible] me to genuinely
improve the bioavailability.

865
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,770
So it really is in a lot of
ways an ideological issue
where it's sort of framed

866
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:47,970
that,

867
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,241
you know,

868
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,980
you don't want to contribute to suffering,

869
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,610
but these things really
don't suffer there.

870
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,060
Yeah.

871
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:54,811
But even there,

872
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:55,111
you know,

873
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:56,130
as we talked about,

874
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,700
you're going to contribute to contribute
to suffering and potentially more if

875
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:01,920
you're looking on the
scale of individual lives.

876
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,380
And it might sound like this is nit picky,

877
00:29:04,381 --> 00:29:05,100
but it's not.

878
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,080
We're talking about actual lives,

879
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:07,591
you know,

880
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:07,951
and,

881
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:10,350
and then you have to
start evaluating like,

882
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,680
is a cow more ascension are worth,

883
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,110
you know,

884
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:18,270
the life of a cow worth more than the
life of a rabbit or a vole or the kinds of

885
00:29:18,271 --> 00:29:19,680
animals that are being killed.

886
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,900
And in the end,

887
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:21,330
you know,

888
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,220
in the production of these plant foods is,

889
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,620
it's a real question.
