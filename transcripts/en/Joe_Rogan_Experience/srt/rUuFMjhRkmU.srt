1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,080
Nobody knows. Oh right. We're live
John Ronson, Hawaii. It fell. Hey,

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:06,410
how are you guys for doing this
man? I appreciate, I'm glad I,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,750
I couldn't tell you the number of people
who've said he should do to record the

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,491
number of people who set up.

5
00:00:10,491 --> 00:00:14,010
I've got Joe Rogan soak it about
Bohemian Grove or just took it about

6
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,720
psychopaths.
You have to come on.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,260
Well I'm friends with Alex Jones
and Alex Jones told me many, many,

8
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,400
many years ago,
uh,

9
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:24,540
that they are burning
effigies and Bohemian Grove.

10
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:27,910
They're worshiping Molik the owl God,
when I went to pay,

11
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:31,010
he didn't grow up with Alex tone.
That's a note.

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,530
That's like going to Disneyland with
Mickey Mouse. Yeah, it was kind of my,

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,580
it was kind of my idea. I sent him
to fill out the kind of sound like,

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,300
I mean this isn't strictly speaking to,

15
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:43,830
but I kind of sometimes feel a little bit
like Alex Jones is Simon cowel because

16
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:45,810
before,
cause this is like way back in the mid,

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,890
mid to late nineties when he was
like really famous in Austin,

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,110
but kind of not that well known outside.

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,160
I was working with this producer,
John Sargent. Basically we, we,

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,090
we notice something which was that
a lot of people on the fringes, um,

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,050
that Islamic fundamentalists and Neo Nazis
and militia people will have this one

22
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:09,360
thing in common, which is they
were all conspiracy theorists.

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:13,560
They all believed in, you know, the evil
power of Bilderberg and Bohemian Grove.

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,470
Um, so I thought it'd be good to
try and infiltrate those places. Um,

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,960
but I didn't want to infiltrate Bohemian
Grove alone because frankly I was

26
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:22,794
scared.

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,950
So we've met Alex Jones
when he was rebuilding David
Koresh's Church at Waco and

28
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,780
he seemed kind of Gung Ho. He was
rebuilding David Koresh's church. Yeah,

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,370
that was the first time I met Alex Jones.
I wouldn't know where Randy Weaver. Uh,

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,100
I, I became friends with the wave for
family, um, who are the weavers again now,

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,010
Ruby Ridge, you know, white separatists.

32
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,480
And so I've got really friendly
with Randy's daughter rate.

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,200
And then I went with Randy to,

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,680
to Waco and Alex said there was
this kind of crazy bad, the Waco,

35
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,060
and I was like, who the fuck is that?
What year was this? This was about nine,

36
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,770
probably [inaudible] 98 maybe. That's when
I met him. Yeah. Yeah, I met him in 98.

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,410
Ah, yeah, he was, yeah,
he was amazing. I mean,

38
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,300
I could tell it like I
drove to Austin with him.

39
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,570
Like he went to buy a new suit
cause he was like, you know,

40
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:12,900
giving a big talk at Waco and
like, yeah, everybody in the,

41
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,740
everybody in the clothing store was like
excited because Alex Jones had walked

42
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,570
in and started, he was like a big deal in,
in the neighborhood. But, but then, um,

43
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,420
but then I wanted somebody to sneak
into Bamyan Grove with and I asked David

44
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,910
Eick first I said, gee, could we go into
but he be girl? But he was like, no.

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,950
That's where they transform
themselves back as giant lizards.

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,190
Did he tell you that for
real? Yeah. He said, yeah.

47
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:39,140
He said that's where they
transform themselves back
and teach kind of abandoned

48
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,520
all that housing a yeah, he gets mad if
you bring it up. It does eight. Yeah.

49
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,580
Which you can't, you can't get mad
man. You hear that. You, you get, Oh,

50
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,830
you made a lot of speeches saying that
people transforming the lizards. Yeah.

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,800
You've got to own up to that shit.
Got To hope you said those exact words.

52
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,790
But this is going back a long time.
He said words.

53
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,700
He certainly strongly implied
that he believed that,

54
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,980
that it was at Bohemian Grove,
that they transform

55
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,590
yourself. I think you're in the
clear, because he gave many,

56
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,400
many interviews where he talked
about that that was a, a big,

57
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,150
well it was kind of in the early
days of the Internet would,

58
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:13,210
you can get away with saying stupid shit
like that and you didn't have a bunch

59
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,990
of people on reddit that immediately could
debunk your Twitter or Facebook where

60
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,150
they just knew something that
you did know. And I'm like,

61
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,620
what the fuck are you talking about?

62
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,530
Transforming a lizard is get
the fuck out of here. Dude.

63
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,090
Has his big piece of evidence that the
Heman Grove was where the transform house

64
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:33,140
into lizards was because of this
woman called Kathy O'Brien who,

65
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,820
who said that she was a kidnap sex
slave. Uh, and actually it would be like,

66
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,110
let loose into the gardens of
the White House. Uh, George Bush,

67
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:46,460
Sr would like hunter.
And that was like his second game.

68
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,790
And so she wrote this book
about this called, um,

69
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,800
it was called something like
the crisis of democracy.

70
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:53,720
It was called the
transformation of America.

71
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,850
And she said it was at Bohemian Grove.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,310
She was a kidnap sex
slave at Bohemian Grove.

73
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,040
And that's where it all happened.

74
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,080
And she was la and Bohemian Grove
was all based around this, um, this,

75
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:09,150
this river and the Russian
river. And, and so,

76
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,020
so that's where the Bohemian Grove
Room is first started with, with,

77
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:16,280
with Cathy O'Brien. That's
hilarious. Yeah. And, um,

78
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,040
so I thought like,

79
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,130
it can't be true that light George Bush
and Henry Kissinger or go to this club

80
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,420
out on the Saturday night,

81
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:31,370
they'll put on robes and have a mock
human sacrifice in front of a giant stone

82
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,420
owl. I thought that can't be true.
So I phoned up David Eick and I said,

83
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,690
which would occur trying to come with me?
And he's like, no. And then I thought,

84
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:42,930
well remember that crazy that you know,
that guy we met at Waco, Alex Jones,

85
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,250
maybe we should ask him.
So I called up Alex Jones and I said,

86
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,960
the fancy trying to get into piney grove.
And he was like, he was like, yeah,

87
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,810
I've got to get a cab. Well, we'll
get a hit of Cabo will get it.

88
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,110
I will get it routed our faces as
devil worshipers will confront them.

89
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:58,880
Gag about they're globalists
devil worshiping. Yeah.

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:02,180
Evil. So that was the video.
He made a video about this.

91
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:05,930
So you were in involved in that?
Yeah, I was in this video. Okay,

92
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:09,910
now I remember you. Okay. Yeah, I remember
you in that. It was a long time ago.

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,753
Long time.
Yeah.

94
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,130
Um, we, so we all went, we
all went to Bohemian Grove.

95
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:19,390
It was me and my producer, the
camera man. And then Alex and Alex,

96
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:23,650
his wife Violet and, and his friend
Mike. And it was like six of us.

97
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,970
And we were like strange bedfellows.
Oh,

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,830
this'll be fun, Alex. And
Alex was like, you know what?

99
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:36,880
At one point I said to Alex that
have you got like a contingency plan?

100
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:41,860
Like if we managed to get in and
like your, you know your uncovered,

101
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,810
have you got a contingency plan? And Alec
said yes and I said, what is it? He said,

102
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:49,270
I'll say to them,
don't get any closer.

103
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,220
And I'm like that's your contingency plan.
Don't get any gas like a threat.

104
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,600
I was growing up so is he was
just going to scare them? Yeah,

105
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,090
he's going to get any closer.
That's it. Don't get any closer.

106
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,270
That was Alex's plan. I don't think
he thinks that far ahead. Ah Shit.

107
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,133
That's a problem.

108
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,590
He really did put on robes and they
really do have like a bundle of sticks

109
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,290
that's supposed to represent a human
being and they carried it out there and

110
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,920
light it on fire. I saw it all
with my own eyes. What do they say?

111
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:24,240
That it represents a human being like,
well no,

112
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:28,010
what what they say is that
it represents dull cal,

113
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,390
like all the troubles in the world,

114
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,230
all these man of wealth and power
have all these troubles in the world.

115
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,820
I've got to say it was weird.
People problems for this
real first world problems.

116
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,030
Yeah. 1% are first world problems. Yeah.

117
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,630
We use that though.

118
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,040
We'll just have pain in the
ass for two weeks a year.

119
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,570
We'll just have so much stress.

120
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:54,800
We need to burn a fake person to make
you feel better. God you guys just,

121
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:57,620
it's so hard being a billionaire kind of.
How do you do it?

122
00:06:57,621 --> 00:07:01,000
How do you run the world? I'll tell
you what was weird though. So Alex,

123
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,800
Alex is plan and this is how
we were going to get him.

124
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:08,000
We were going to rent a boat and like
say let along the river and then get out

125
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:12,080
and in climate the mountain and it get
down the other side and I get in that way.

126
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,770
I'm, I was thinking this is that
this is an ill conceived plan

127
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,620
and I know we met this
local lawyer called Rick.

128
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,140
He was like this preppy
lawyer who lived in the town,

129
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,040
Monte Rio Occidental and record had been,

130
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:31,940
and he infiltrated Bohemian Grove just
because like everybody in the town wants

131
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:33,500
to know what's going on in baby grove.

132
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,980
So we met Rick to get some tips on how
to break in and Alex told Rick is planned

133
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,680
and Rick said, look, if you go in that
way you're gonna get yourself killed.

134
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,910
And Alex wrote down,
I suppose my favorite,

135
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:46,310
one of my favorite bits
of the whole weekend,

136
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,960
Alex wrote down on this notepad
going in that way, dash killed.

137
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:00,800
So Rick said, well, you need to do is lie.

138
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,900
Go to Eddie Bauer and get yourself some
preppy clothes and just walk up the

139
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,080
drive. Just walk up the job.
[inaudible] that's a smart move. Yeah.

140
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,440
So Alex was like really
torn because part of him,

141
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:13,700
he admitted this to me afterwards.

142
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,780
Part of him was worried
that like in the wicker man,

143
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,560
me and Rick had all these other people
that we'd met with all part of this

144
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:25,950
cutoff elaborate plan to
Lou Alex into the forest.

145
00:08:25,951 --> 00:08:29,330
So like he would,
oh that's so rich.

146
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,790
It crossed his mind.

147
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,910
So the upshot was that Alex
and Mike decided to go in
separately to me and Rick.

148
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:42,290
Oh yeah. So he didn't trust you that much?
No, he didn't trust he, I mean he didn't,

149
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,450
they didn't have Wikipedia back then.
He couldn't just Google your anything.

150
00:08:45,451 --> 00:08:49,790
Right. Couldn't Google me. Um, did he know
of your work? Did he know who you were?

151
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,090
Not really. I, I wasn't
particularly well known back then.

152
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,980
I wasn't really well known.
Safe to say that Alex Jones

153
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,560
helped launch you.
We kind of help load teacher there

154
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,550
that night. You guys went in there
and Alex gave me this on VHS tape,

155
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:06,180
by the way,

156
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,040
back in 99 or whatever the hell you guys
actually made a tape out of it. Yeah.

157
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:15,740
Well Alex and I did this thing.
I did a special in Austin. Um,

158
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,790
my first DVD I filmed in Austin and
Alex and I dressed up as the bushes.

159
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,030
I was George Bush junior and he
was senior and we ran around the,

160
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,810
the, the state capitol with
like these Bush masks on. We,

161
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:34,080
I've seen that 52 let's have a
big bull horn saying that. Oh,

162
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:37,950
like satanist globalist at
one point in time. Definitely.

163
00:09:37,951 --> 00:09:41,730
But I don't know if that made it into the
video, but we, he actually sang a song.

164
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,490
There's actually a song, I don't
know if we've ever played that song.

165
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:45,990
It's so ridiculous.

166
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,340
Alex Jones wrote a song about like the,

167
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,660
the elite and it,
it was on the video.

168
00:09:54,661 --> 00:09:58,970
It was on the video and we're all like
dancing around to Alex Jones song in the,

169
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:01,250
in the,
it's a fucking stupid.

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,600
This is 99 99 or maybe
two. There it is. Yeah.

171
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:14,070
I, oh, what does he say? Look, put the
headphones on. You hear what he's saying?

172
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,090
I remember putting it back to the
beginning so we could hear it.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,420
Oh,
that's me doing bong hits.

174
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,350
Are we sure as hell don't live ladies and
gentlemen from the belly of the beast.

175
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,830
Classic with the lies and disinformation.
No compromise.

176
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,270
One day closer to victory.

177
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,110
It's Joe Rogan Baby Shit.

178
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:42,111
I bought the Mass Moloch

179
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,960
and friends. So this is
old. This is your same time.

180
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,630
Know. I feel like Hayden Nip Shit. Alex,

181
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,710
is it adjusted Molec by
suggesting Bohemian Grove? Yeah,

182
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,100
the occasion I was wearing
a style project t shirt.

183
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,510
You remember style
project style project.com.

184
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,800
Oh flow.
That's Alex Jones Sagan.

185
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,010
He wrote it all too, by the
way. I ended up to do it though.

186
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,370
Oh my God, it was so stupid. And
the six, six, six of bushes head

187
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,590
I haven't met Alex said that weekend.

188
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,080
That's the only time you've
ever been in Waco. Waco first.

189
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:46,340
And then I lost touch with him after that.
He, he, he read can he liked me again?

190
00:11:46,341 --> 00:11:47,990
Actually after I wrote the manifesto go,

191
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:50,090
it's like he didn't like me
after I wrote my book them,

192
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,070
which includes all this stuff
about sneaking into Bohemian
Grove cause he thought

193
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,290
I was too much of a
debunker of Bohemian Grove.

194
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,120
But then when I wrote
the metastatic goats,

195
00:11:58,121 --> 00:12:01,180
he liked me again because
he felt that I was like, oh,

196
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:06,950
the minister it goes is kind of like a
conspiracy book in a way. Yeah. So, um,

197
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,880
how much different is it than the, should
we keep going with this Bohemian Grove?

198
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,650
Yeah. Yeah. It, there's more to say. Uh,

199
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,840
so Alex and Mike decided to
go and buy the undergrowth,

200
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,320
like I saw them. Um, so they
went in through the bushes.

201
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,170
They wouldn't see the bushes and
there was a lot of poison oak.

202
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,120
I wouldn't be at all. It's just walked
in. Yeah, man. Rick, the lawyer,

203
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:31,840
this kind of preppy lawyer. Um, oh,

204
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,620
tell me the funniest thing that
I've missed out of this story was,

205
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,620
was the night before we were
going to infiltrate, um,

206
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,080
Alex and Mike decided to
practice being preppy.

207
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I'd said they were walking,

208
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,100
they were walking up and down like the
code or outside their Botero ribbed

209
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:52,610
talking in a kind of a feminine way
about microprocessors. Like, you know, I,

210
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,200
I just nanotechnologies the future.
Yeah.

211
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,400
That's how I think Doug
preppies die. Yeah. Oh,

212
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,600
uh, so, um, and then, so then
they went into the undergrowth.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,340
Amedion and Rick, the lawyer went
up to drive, um, actually with,

214
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,400
with our producer John Surgeons and,
and just as Rick said, you know,

215
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:17,020
we gave the security guard to cat if I
ruled the world type wave. Um, we've just,

216
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:19,390
just preppy and we were in act like,
you know,

217
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,620
that's what it used to say when
you're used to rob things. I used to.

218
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,630
So just act like, you know, act like
you know what you're doing. Yeah.

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,100
We walked in and there was
this bank, my memories, okay,

220
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,660
there's this big bank of telephones.
This was that before cell phones were,

221
00:13:34,661 --> 00:13:36,660
I guess there were cell phones,
but very fewer.

222
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,770
You have a few that was
a big bank of telephones.

223
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,180
And then there were all these camps.
It was like a giant redwood forest. Um,

224
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,200
and then there are all these little
camps everywhere and all the camps.

225
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:49,660
Sure enough,
had weird,

226
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,620
like almost definitely kind of
Maliyah la little red light.

227
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:56,500
I remember one of the campuses called
like devilized or something and it was

228
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:59,320
like little red eyes, you know,
poking out of the, think of it,

229
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,210
that car Halloween type type shit.

230
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,400
And then some of the camps had like
grand pianos and hot tubs and they'll all

231
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:11,330
these old men, all of whom looked like,
you know, Mr. Burns, um, sort of in,

232
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:14,530
in La little trucks going up and down.
Um,

233
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,230
and like the golf carts.
Yeah.

234
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:20,860
Sort of more like posh pickup trucks.

235
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,110
Let the kind of stuff you'd get like, like
a universal studio tools or something.

236
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,070
And then we saw, and there's like
all this owl stuff everywhere.

237
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,540
Now the reason love this,

238
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,060
some conspiracy theorists get really
annoyed with what I'm about to say. Um,

239
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,790
is that because everybody really loves
the idea that like they're worshiping

240
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:44,650
Molec the giant Devil Howell.
But the reason why I saw as I could tell,

241
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:49,570
they're all these owl
sculptures everywhere is cause
like, it's an owl sanctuary.

242
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,370
Like there's little cabins with
like stuffed owls in there.

243
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:56,920
It's like an owl sanctuary. So,
um, well wait a minute. There's,

244
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,670
there's,
it's an owl sanctuary,

245
00:14:58,671 --> 00:15:03,320
like they actually take care of owls
or like an hour or preservation area.

246
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:07,340
Like this is a place where
owls nest. Oh No. Our legs.

247
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,730
So this is, if you were
worshiping an hour, God though,

248
00:15:10,731 --> 00:15:14,570
wouldn't that be a cool place to make
your sanctuary where the owls actually

249
00:15:14,571 --> 00:15:19,380
nest? Well, I guess so and less. You
can't totally debunk it there Mr. Ross.

250
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,330
Well that's true. An Oda wouldn't
like if you're worshiping a giant owl,

251
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,640
God wouldn't, or the regular sized.
I was be like false gods. I'm,

252
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:33,230
and I'm um,
Baskins maybe or you know,

253
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,000
I dunno if you have like a,

254
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,200
a great monkey God and the monkeys lived
around with a great monkey. God lived,

255
00:15:39,201 --> 00:15:43,370
you'd feel like they worshiped the month.
I like their lip or shipped Moloch.

256
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,420
Okay, I'm with you on that
still. Nonetheless. The minions,

257
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:50,090
they did this bankable may,
I can tell you I have children.

258
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,250
So we were wondering about me and wreck.
Um,

259
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:59,690
and we saw this giant, the
giant Al Right. Um, of,

260
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:02,840
of everybody's life
legend. Um, it's funny,

261
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:04,820
I remember thinking it was stone,

262
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,270
but then a few years later somebody
else infiltrated Bohemian Grove for some

263
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:10,370
magazine and said,
it's not stone,

264
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:13,580
it's like plaster of Paris
or word or something. But,

265
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,490
and I'm sure that right when
you guys were far away from it,

266
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,330
I remember spending like all the way
up to it. So is there a security guard?

267
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:21,320
Like when you walked down,

268
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,700
there was one guy sitting in a little
hut and he didn't ask anything,

269
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,250
didn't ask anything. He just wait, like
enjoy, enjoy your evening or something.

270
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,450
And where is Bohemian grow? Yeah, what
state? It's in northern California. It's,

271
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:37,580
it's next to this little town called
Occidental. It's like a no through roads.

272
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:41,270
And then he'd go up the road.
A north of San Francisco. Yeah,

273
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,990
north of Napa is north
of Napa. Okay. Hmm. Uh,

274
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,940
and um, I remember seeing Alex and
Mike and I was like, well, hey,

275
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,550
it's Alex and mark. Hey, I did. They
walked past and they said, keep walking.

276
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,660
That's how it was everywhere.

277
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,330
It's commerce at the chase
is our walls everywhere else.

278
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,660
Mike said it's how was
everywhere today see out?

279
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,630
I mean they talk a little bit what
hours or what? I think at this point,

280
00:17:02,631 --> 00:17:05,690
Mike was convinced that every time they
saw an hour and it was like, you know,

281
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,960
it was molec relate to, she's
just fucking crushed. Yeah. So,

282
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,850
so what were you thinking at this point?
You're thinking,

283
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:13,370
what the fuck have I got myself
into hanging out with these guys?

284
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,680
They're going to ruin my
whole investigation? Well,
no, I mean I was nervous, um,

285
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,720
because you know, um, the closer you can
get those microphone, the better tools.

286
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,660
We don't have our heads hearts. So
yeah, I was Kinda, I was nervous. Um,

287
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,080
but I sort of thought it was kind of
fun. I felt safe with Rick, the lawyer.

288
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,370
I felt like nothing bad would happen
to me because he looked so rich and

289
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,370
prepping and that's like every
horror movie where things go bad.

290
00:17:37,371 --> 00:17:40,930
You're hanging out with Rick, the lawyer.
Yeah. I thought I'd be fine with Rick.

291
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:41,780
The lawyer.
Yeah.

292
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,310
So then the bell rings like gets
to dusk and as a rigging of the,

293
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,010
and if all these old men like drift down
to this little pond and they all sit on

294
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:58,950
like grass,
one side of the pond and I,

295
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:03,951
and Alex and Mike are there like a few
rows behind us and there's the giant owl

296
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:06,990
on the other side of the pond.
Um,

297
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,270
I remember this moment was,

298
00:18:09,271 --> 00:18:12,870
I thought it was really weird
was this old man comes up to me.

299
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,940
I mean this is like nearly 20 years ago,

300
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:16,620
so I don't remember like
all of the details, but,

301
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,910
but this old man came up to me and said
something lie like I was way younger

302
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,510
than everybody else there and this.
And this guy says to me,

303
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:28,050
is this your first time? And I said,
yeah. I said, Oh, you're going to love it,

304
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,610
a burn and burn em.

305
00:18:29,611 --> 00:18:32,910
And I did the sort of impression of
what was about to happen in, in the,

306
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,050
in the pageant.

307
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,980
And there was this look of like real
fucking intensity on this guy's face.

308
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:43,110
And at that moment I thought to myself
like there's Alex and Mike like a few

309
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:43,980
rows behind me,

310
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,270
convinced that this is like evidence
that the global or liter blood drinking

311
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,170
satanists.

312
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:53,580
And then there's all these like men of
wealth and power who are really fucking

313
00:18:53,581 --> 00:18:54,990
into it all themselves.

314
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,410
And they might be into it in a different
way to the way Alex and micro into it,

315
00:18:58,411 --> 00:19:00,240
but they're fucking into it.
And I thought,

316
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:04,830
I'm the only sane person in this
entire fucking redwood worked.

317
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,310
The lawyer and Rick,
me and Rick were the only same people.

318
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:11,400
I wonder if for 10 has dropped off from
that place, wants to invented Viagara,

319
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,080
you know, just like rich old
dudes and they couldn't get it up.

320
00:19:15,081 --> 00:19:18,060
It's not a lot to do
your board. Yeah, it was,

321
00:19:18,061 --> 00:19:20,820
it was a weird way to
spend your summer vacation.

322
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I didn't see any like famous people,

323
00:19:24,301 --> 00:19:27,870
but at one point we pass
this law display cabinet.

324
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,400
I know with the names of the guests
on the, in, in the display cabinet,

325
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,850
and I remember seeing Dick
Cheney's name. Oh yeah. For sure.

326
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,010
That's probably gets us
extra hearts. Yeah. Have you
ever, uh, there's a photo of,

327
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:45,120
I think it's Ronald Reagan at
Bohemian Grove. Yeah. We might

328
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,250
pull that up Jamie.
Cause it's a crazy photo.

329
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:55,700
So this has been like a weird spot
where these guys have gone for decades.

330
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,570
Well since I guess since like the
railroad came through San Francisco, like,

331
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,200
like, you know, the turn
of the 20th century.

332
00:20:04,201 --> 00:20:08,610
I think that's pretty much
when it started. All the fuck
started. This theater is,

333
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,301
there's Nixon,

334
00:20:09,301 --> 00:20:12,720
there's ran who started this thing
and look at the big redwood behind on

335
00:20:12,721 --> 00:20:16,740
something majestic tree. Yeah. Okay.
What I, what I heard, and as I say,

336
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,640
it's been like 20 years since I've
thought about this stuff too much because

337
00:20:20,641 --> 00:20:23,670
once I put it in them, I kind
of forgot about it. But, but,

338
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:25,410
but the story I heard was the,

339
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,490
when the railroad was coming
through San Francisco,

340
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:33,930
all the rich white Republicans
and unlike Bilderberg, this is,

341
00:20:33,931 --> 00:20:38,700
have a Republican club, uh, thought, you
know, fuck, there goes the neighborhood,

342
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,860
you know,
we're going to lose our elite status.

343
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,380
We need to set up a
private club for ourselves.

344
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,310
So they set up the Bohemian Club in San
Francisco and then Bohemian Grove and

345
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,360
you know,
if a couple of hours north.

346
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:55,000
So then this less ritual starts this,

347
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,240
you see a man wearing later Hosan appears
in like a stage cut out of the giant

348
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:07,390
redwoods and he's got like leaves all
over his later hose and it's like leaf

349
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:11,560
covered later hose and he
starts singing this like and,

350
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,980
and the symphonies there,
like the San Francisco symphony.

351
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,580
Well there's a video of it pull,
pull,

352
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,230
pull a video of Alex Jones at
Bohemian Grove because Alex,

353
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:25,190
Alex was a few rows behind us and he was
filming it or like with a camera that

354
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:30,160
had toppled over 45 degrees. It is, it is
bag and yeah, he filmed the whole thing.

355
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,820
Yeah, he did it like on a
sneak tip. Yeah, I did it.

356
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,560
Film is early as like,

357
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,810
like the pre show later
hose and I don't know

358
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,480
if I know Alex. Yeah. Alex. He felt
everything and put everything out.

359
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,000
Um,

360
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
see if you can find just some dude in
a row in front of a giant fucking owl.

361
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,700
Yeah. So yes, it's toppled
over sideways. Yeah.

362
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,400
So go full screen.
Maybe we'll get a better look at it.

363
00:22:00,401 --> 00:22:04,080
And I'm a few Rosen from yeah. So
then this happens, all these men in,

364
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:07,050
in robes and hoods or descend,
um,

365
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,540
infant of the giant owl that you go area.

366
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,290
And they have this ritual where,

367
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:17,330
where this puppy and Masha effigy
like comes out over on the pond, um,

368
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,000
in a Gondola and they say twitch,
you know, we shall burn here tonight.

369
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,870
A Dole care and then the voice
of dog care, cause he showed up,

370
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:29,620
burn me and then I go year after year.

371
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,210
Dot thing year after year and this
happy grove, we burned the um,

372
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,120
and then they lifted up and
throw in the fire and the,

373
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:40,540
and the FTE goes that that makes noises.

374
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,680
Do they have like a speaker system
or something? Yes, he's the speakers.

375
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,790
And what you can't see in the videos that,

376
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,480
that there's an orchestra
a to your left a bit.

377
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:52,150
Fuck knows where the guy in the lift
covered later host and gone at this

378
00:22:52,151 --> 00:22:56,320
juncture. But he was on, he was like
basically sitting on the giant redwood.

379
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,100
He's getting sodomized by
Nixon and Dick Cheney. Yeah.

380
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,840
Ronald Reagan's coaching them.

381
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,200
There's probably about a
thousand people in that crowd,

382
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:08,470
the other side of the pond.
Wow. When the fireworks go off,

383
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,480
you get like a glimpse of
how many people there are.

384
00:23:10,481 --> 00:23:14,620
There's probably a thousand people.
Wow. Now one of the requirements,

385
00:23:14,621 --> 00:23:16,360
like how do you get in there?
You get invited.

386
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,250
I met Harry sharer who got invited
Harry Shearer from the Simpsons.

387
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,560
He was the only person who'd
been to Bohemian Grove who
was willing to like talk

388
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:30,310
about it to me like after we left
and he said he was invited to,

389
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:30,971
these were his words.

390
00:23:30,971 --> 00:23:34,510
He said he was invited to do the
place up like the word juice.

391
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,430
And he said he thought
it was kinda ridiculous,

392
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,840
but he agreed with my
interpretation of it,

393
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:45,100
which is basically that it's not
evidence that the secret rulers,

394
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:46,040
the world are actually,

395
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,420
um,
satanists who do actual human sacrifice,

396
00:23:50,421 --> 00:23:53,240
which is basically the way Alex was.
We're spinning it,

397
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,540
but it's this kind of
weird overblown pageant.

398
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:02,450
Um,
what I think is really interesting,

399
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,850
and I think this is where
skull and bones comes into it,

400
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:10,090
is that there is this weird proclivity
amongst the elites to create these

401
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,110
ancient ceremonies for themselves.
And none of them are actually ancient.

402
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,540
They're all only what,
like a hundred years old at the most,

403
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,120
but there do not for a reason,
right?

404
00:24:20,121 --> 00:24:24,020
They want to create this cut and
masonic ritualistic, you know,

405
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:27,890
Maliyah for themselves. And I think
there's a weird psychology going on there.

406
00:24:27,891 --> 00:24:32,510
Cause I've been new or me, we were, well,
I mean I wouldn't, you wouldn't. No,

407
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:36,800
I wouldn't. Yeah, I might. I would
have to be really fucked up to do it,

408
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,120
to be under the influence of a
lot of different things. But the,

409
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,610
the idea behind it I guess is that you,

410
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,600
you get closer if you're all doing
this ridiculous shit together,

411
00:24:47,601 --> 00:24:52,601
that somehow or another through
tradition or through a ritual that you,

412
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:53,840
you bond,

413
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,620
you bound him and maybe it gives you
a kind of mandate to be in an elite.

414
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,330
I sometimes wonder whether
lack of skull and bones too.

415
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,160
It's not just about bonding,

416
00:25:04,161 --> 00:25:09,161
but it's also about creating this
kind of specialness for yourself.

417
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,790
Right, right, right. Yeah. That
gives you a sort of, you know,

418
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,110
does it make you feel so,

419
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,890
so insecure about the idea that you're
a global elitist is ruling the world.

420
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,290
What's the other thing about
skull and bonds as well?

421
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,150
There were saying that
the part of the ritual,

422
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,990
they do like really humiliating shit to
each other and they film it so that they

423
00:25:29,991 --> 00:25:34,520
always have this like
undecided Telogis maybe.

424
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,660
Yeah, I'm, yeah, I've heard
I've heard that, but I, but I,

425
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,940
but I don't know if that's true,
but I've heard that,

426
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,730
well young Jamie was saying the Tom
Cruise might be leaving Scientology.

427
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:48,470
Is there any evidence to
support this star Star magazine?

428
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,100
Well, that's about as good as it gets.
The body. I'll be good. It's going.

429
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:56,540
Claire has a lot of power, I think
the movement, well it certainly did.

430
00:25:56,541 --> 00:26:00,930
I mean it exposed, it will what it
all deals with. I think with this,

431
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:06,010
this Bohemian Grove thing and is
this sort of a cultish mindsets,

432
00:26:07,971 --> 00:26:12,971
these weird sort of mindsets where they
engage in otherwise preposterous rituals

433
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,370
that to the outside or like to
us like we're watching this hour,

434
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,790
God and I'll fucking bundle
of sticks and burn the,

435
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,990
this is so fucking stupid.
But to those people,

436
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,130
it represents this thing that they've
all kind of agreed to do this goofy shit

437
00:26:28,131 --> 00:26:33,050
together and there's some weird power
in that. Yeah, I agree with that.

438
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,970
It's,
it's definitely there for a reason.

439
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,050
What exists in so many different cultures.
That's the weirdest part about it.

440
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:42,890
It's like you go back to like the
Aztecs and the Maya, like they would,

441
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,850
they would make these human sacrifices.

442
00:26:44,851 --> 00:26:49,410
They would wear these crazy outfits and
plumed head dresses and it was all this

443
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:54,450
like, yeah, it took us more than
the isis cause to, sure. Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,550
But it's bizarre the out when people
start wearing outfits and engaging in

445
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,280
rituals, you know, that's the,

446
00:27:01,281 --> 00:27:05,790
that's a weird aspect of human behavior
that seems to be really prevalent.

447
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,030
It's like, it's not like
an isolated incidence where
there's only this, you know,

448
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:13,350
like if you go to Africa and you
see like a or Asia or you know,

449
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,520
you see like these people that have those,
those things that extend their neck,

450
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:21,080
those little bars, those
women put, they're like, God,
what are they doing? What's,

451
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,250
it's very isolated.
Yeah.

452
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,070
It's only like one group of people
that do it or so the women that put the

453
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:29,190
plates that this surgery,
women that put the plates in their lips,

454
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,120
like what the fuck is that? It doesn't
catch on. It doesn't go anywhere else.

455
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:37,320
Like bizarre ritual, but it's only
isolate this one very specific area,

456
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,940
but rituals themselves,

457
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:43,740
like really wacky dresses and the
weird things that people do. It's,

458
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,850
it's so common.

459
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,960
It's almost like every culture has
them on the people involved. Um,

460
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,050
by the way, when my book them came out,
the Bohemian club made a statement.

461
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:58,860
I remember about my book where they say,
they said something along the lines of,

462
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:03,360
despite Jon Ronson's
objectionable chest passing,

463
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,540
we appreciate the fats that he's putting
a less kind of sensation lists spin on

464
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,610
what he saw then what Alex Jones does.

465
00:28:11,611 --> 00:28:13,380
And so they kind of appreciated
the fact that I was,

466
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,450
I was being less hysterical about it
than Alex and they said, you know, it's,

467
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:21,120
it's overblown,
it's an overblown pageants,

468
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,170
but it couldn't be more innocent or
something along those lines. That's it.

469
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,060
To a squire. And by the way, he could
definitely be more innocent. I mean, look,

470
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,150
the Mickey Mouse parade at Disneyland
is also an overblown pageant and that

471
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,360
could not be more innocent.
It's not,

472
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:42,000
that's really literally
as innocent as things get.

473
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:47,970
Blaming Grove could be way more innocent.
You're, you're burning someone like,

474
00:28:47,971 --> 00:28:49,800
and you're saying I burned the,

475
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:53,970
and then you have screams that play out
over a loudspeaker that's not innocent.

476
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,530
That's Wacky as fuck. Like it's hard
to just, just stating the facts.

477
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,290
It would be really hard to soften that up.
You know,

478
00:29:01,291 --> 00:29:05,590
like saying that you have an over
sensationalized version of it. Like what?

479
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,730
That's not possible. Like
it's really sensational. Oh,

480
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,550
the saying that I
definitely had some chuck,

481
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:16,551
this is why me and Alex fell out because
I felt what we saw was bizarre enough

482
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,280
without having to put a spin on it.
What was Alex Suspense? Onyx has been,

483
00:29:23,281 --> 00:29:25,110
was Pratt to clay that,
you know,

484
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,800
it's possible that they were killing
an actual baby. I mean, attics,

485
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:32,430
I come to find out about that, but
he, well he bought it a long way. Oh,

486
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:36,990
how did what he, uh, at one
point he said to me, yeah,

487
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,020
we overheard these two old men. Like when
we were walking down the road. I mean,

488
00:29:40,021 --> 00:29:41,040
it's to the,
me and Alex were like,

489
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,730
you know, but he said at one point we
overheard these two old man going, yeah,

490
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:48,400
we're going to get him elected.
And I thought like,

491
00:29:48,401 --> 00:29:52,390
I don't know that Alex didn't hear that,
but that's a bit fucking convenience.

492
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:56,590
I thought that's exactly what the thing
Alex would want to hear at Bohemian

493
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,030
Grove. Oh, knows what that
conversation was about.

494
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,940
I take something out of context like that.

495
00:30:00,941 --> 00:30:02,710
It could have been a total complete joke.

496
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,530
It could have been elected
to let the local shrine has,

497
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,520
it could've been anything.

498
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,820
And the boys house cause I mean who knows
what the fuck they were talking about.

499
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,360
Alex is one of those
jumped to conclusions,

500
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:17,860
confirmation bias characters that
oftentimes has some really fascinating

501
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,360
information. Uh, and as much I admired
that. Alex, I mean he's a good friend,

502
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:26,860
a good friend. He's an
extraordinary broadcasters. Crazy.

503
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,800
He's crazy. He's my friend. I'll tell
you right now. He's, I was fucking mind,

504
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,570
but he's right a lot of the time.

505
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,490
I mean one of the best pieces of work
that Alex did was nine one one the road to

506
00:30:36,491 --> 00:30:37,324
tyranny.

507
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:42,450
And in that he exposed some stuff from
news broadcast that was really shocking

508
00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,480
about the use of agent provocateurs too,

509
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,150
which I always thought
was utter horse shit.

510
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,070
And then it turns out not
only is it not horse shit,

511
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,460
but it's standard operational
procedure has been proven. Um,

512
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:57,640
with this occupy Wall Street crowd.

513
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,140
They infiltrated the occupy Wall Street
group and did all kinds of crazy shit

514
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:04,510
and the park, we're trying to get
people to join them and arrest them.

515
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:09,810
And what the agent provocateurs did
during the WTO protest is they would,

516
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:10,720
um,

517
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,610
they had these peaceful protests and they
would come in dressed up and like all

518
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:19,750
black and they had military issue boots
and they were smashing windows and

519
00:31:19,751 --> 00:31:20,800
breaking things.

520
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,970
And then they gave an excuse for the
cops come in and close down the protest.

521
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,470
Well, they literally set up, I know,

522
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:30,640
protest zone where people couldn't
go to work with WTO badges.

523
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:34,450
They had a WTO badge with us aligned
through it, like saying no WTO.

524
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,310
They were literally telling them they
couldn't go to work with that on cause

525
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,300
they know protest like a fucking pin,
like,

526
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,800
which is completely against everything
in this country is supposed to stand for.

527
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:49,260
Right. And so these people
were, um, you know, they,

528
00:31:49,261 --> 00:31:54,261
these agent provocateurs or working for
the government and they literally came

529
00:31:54,341 --> 00:31:58,360
in to try to break up up a peaceful
protest by turning it violent.

530
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:02,290
And then they were all held up in this
one house and Alex documented at all,

531
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,430
not with his own news footage
and his own reporting spin,

532
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,610
but basically just using actual news
stories and different coverages by

533
00:32:12,581 --> 00:32:16,450
different local news stations and showed
like what the fuck actually went on.

534
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,620
These people were all released,

535
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,520
these guys were all held up in a building
somewhere and they negotiated their

536
00:32:21,521 --> 00:32:25,900
release. Someone did
somehow and it, you know,

537
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,630
at first I was really super
skeptical because I was like,

538
00:32:28,631 --> 00:32:33,070
that sounds like nonsense. But
then you, the more you peel away,

539
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:35,830
the more you realize, oh well this is
something that they've always done.

540
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:38,070
It's like a standard look,

541
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:41,570
if you've got a bunch of people that
are protesting and they're ruining your

542
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:46,010
elite, globalist fun, like the best
way to do it if they're being peaceful,

543
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:49,970
is to have people that pretend to be
amongst them start smashing things.

544
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,360
Then you have an excuse to come in and
arrest everybody. And that's what they do,

545
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,770
man. So he, he, he had a really
fascinating video on that,

546
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,410
showing evidence of that being used
before that there's a bunch of tactics are

547
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,890
in place places not simply as innocent
as that law enforcement is set up to

548
00:33:06,891 --> 00:33:09,990
enforce laws and to preserve
peace. It's not, it's not they,

549
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:13,760
they do do a bunch of creepy
shit. And you know, that's,

550
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:18,470
that's unfortunate. But that's when you
start talking about conspiracy theory.

551
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:21,440
Well that seems to be conspiracy fact,
you know,

552
00:33:21,441 --> 00:33:25,970
it just seems to be something that's
standard operational procedure when they

553
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:26,804
can get away with it.

554
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:31,250
What I'm hoping is that with all this
wikileaks shit and all this Edward Snowden

555
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:35,420
stuff and all the, the, the new details
that had been revealed about the NSA and,

556
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:40,260
and what we know now about security and
the Internet and the cloud and it's,

557
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,280
everything can be hacked.
Everything can be compromised.

558
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:47,120
I'm hoping that all goes away because
I'm hoping that it's just can be way too

559
00:33:47,121 --> 00:33:50,420
transparent. But you know, I dunno,

560
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,190
but Alex Jones thinks they're,

561
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,880
what they're trying to do is
get down to 500,000 people.

562
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,480
He's got this idea in his
head. Yeah. 500,000 people.

563
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:02,290
These really grandiose
things. He says like, God,

564
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,330
Deity think he really believes them.
Do you think he's like,

565
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:10,190
like he's trying to make something that's
so huge that everyone's going to like

566
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:15,080
Jordan's house towards him.
Um, he's not a liar. Um, he,

567
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:20,140
he might go further with
things then I would,

568
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:23,240
you know,
he might not have rational conclusions.

569
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,020
He might approach things
with confirmation bias.

570
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:31,190
But when you spend five hours a day
on the fucking radio or whatever,

571
00:34:31,191 --> 00:34:34,880
he does just going over a wacky
theories and selling gold,

572
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:38,540
gold and bonds and dried foods,
they got dried food.

573
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,960
Keep the dried fruit and your basement.
You know,

574
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,610
after a while I think you
lose your fucking mind.

575
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:46,130
And if you work at a strip club,
you get sick or hookers.

576
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,660
He gets sick of working with
strippers. You know, if you're,

577
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:51,020
you're selling drugs all day, the last
thing you want to do is take trucks.

578
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,330
I think Alex is like
inundated with conspiracy.

579
00:34:55,331 --> 00:34:56,960
It's like he's overwhelmed.
You know,

580
00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:00,560
you probably can't see the forest for
the trees. It's just saw chaos to him.

581
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,240
It's all everybody's in on it.

582
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,770
It's still the global elite people are
turning into reptiles left and right.

583
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:11,450
Burning owls, babies whenever
they can. I don't know man.

584
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:15,170
I don't, I mean you'd have to ask her.
I love the guy though. He's a great guy.

585
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,000
I love hanging out with him.
He's a lot of fun.

586
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,550
We had week we got on better again,
as I said,

587
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:21,530
after the metastatic coats came out,
cause he really,

588
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:26,480
he liked that book and then he had me
on his show and then like all of his

589
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:31,160
listeners said I was a shale for the
road or do they how Michelle too?

590
00:35:31,161 --> 00:35:34,040
Sometimes they say that. It
depends. Depends on what I say.

591
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,770
When I was talking about chem trails,
then they got really mad at me.

592
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,300
Joe Rogan's a shale.
I debunk chem trails.

593
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,950
Didn't even debunk.
I just fucking science.

594
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:51,210
I mean it's like real simple science
behind what happens when a jet engine

595
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:54,780
passes through condensation in the
atmosphere. It's like it's been,

596
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:59,010
they've known about it for fucking ever
this idea that they're spraying clouds.

597
00:35:59,011 --> 00:36:02,430
Like what the fuck? Man that they're
controlling you with these clouds.

598
00:36:02,431 --> 00:36:04,590
But when I did this a Scifi show,

599
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,120
we talked about it and you know I brought
in aviation specialists and I talked

600
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:12,450
to different scientists and I talked to
a bunch of different people about it and

601
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,531
you know what?

602
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:18,510
We decided to print wa or we decided
to show on the television show.

603
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,310
Unfortunately you're doing with
44 minutes of TV for an hour.

604
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:27,780
You know you've got a bunch of different
commercial so it kind of you don't

605
00:36:27,781 --> 00:36:30,300
spend, I think to really
debunk something like that.

606
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:35,160
You'd have to kind of like spend a long
time with it and actually show people

607
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:39,330
like actually get a jet up in the
air and film it and show how this,

608
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,810
this plane is actually leaving these
clouds because it's passing through.

609
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:45,990
Hayes wouldn't be too hard to do
if you had a really good budget,

610
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:48,930
but we didn't have really good budget
and it wouldn't be that entertaining.

611
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,480
And then we had to make it
like short little snippets,

612
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,620
which is like a real issue when you're
dealing with any of those debunking shows

613
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,130
is that they also have to be entertaining
and they also have to fit within a

614
00:36:59,131 --> 00:37:02,010
format where they have to
break every five minutes,

615
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,600
whatever it is for commercials.
What is that,

616
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,660
how seven minutes or something like that.
Whatever the fuck they do, you know,

617
00:37:06,661 --> 00:37:08,120
they're,
they're constantly having commercials.

618
00:37:08,121 --> 00:37:12,150
So it's like you have to have these
little tiny chunks of information and it's

619
00:37:12,151 --> 00:37:14,460
really just entertainment
more than anything.

620
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,320
Say No, I don't, I don't see myself
as a debunker because I think, um,

621
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,390
yeah, what I saw it behaved been growth
for instance, was, was really, it was odd.

622
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,480
There was a kind of intensity there,
which,

623
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:30,000
which I believe is very different
to what Alex felt was going on,

624
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:34,000
but it was still odd. Yeah.
Well, it's undeniably odd, right?

625
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,160
I mean it is odd. Yeah. I, yeah,
and rituals exists for a reason.

626
00:37:38,161 --> 00:37:42,620
And one reason is that though, I
mean, I don't know for certain, but I,

627
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,740
but I would say it's this idea,
you know, you know, we love to, um,

628
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,180
this is a bit of a non sequitur,

629
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:52,500
but my most recent book is this
book about public shaming codes.

630
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:57,410
So you've been publicly shamed.
And what I've noticed happens on Twitter,

631
00:37:57,411 --> 00:37:59,820
it is,
is we will,

632
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:03,360
we will reduce somebody to a label,

633
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:07,200
will reduce somebody to the
worst tweet that they ever wrote.

634
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,040
We'll demonize them and
then we'll dehumanize them
because we've just destroyed

635
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,620
somebody's and we don't want to
feel bad about destroying them.

636
00:38:13,621 --> 00:38:16,920
So we called them like a sociopath or
something. It says this, his whole life,

637
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:20,880
mental trick we play on ourselves.
Uh, like, um, what's it called?

638
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,940
Cognitive dissonance.
This idea that we're good people,

639
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:27,540
but we've just destroyed some of the day.
So how do we make sense of that?

640
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:30,960
Or we just say, or without a sociopath
or something. So it was all about,

641
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,770
it's all about labeling and reducing and,

642
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:36,340
and demonizing

643
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,110
and destroying people that we don't like.

644
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,280
And it's also about having an
excuse to be a real asshole re,

645
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:47,850
all you have to do is find a reason why
you can only share a fury on people.

646
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,140
And it's a free shot.

647
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,290
It's a free shot because of John
Ronson says something fucked up.

648
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,470
There's a million people that could find
out about that and they don't know you

649
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,020
at all. And so they have a free
shot. They'd never met you.

650
00:38:59,021 --> 00:39:00,580
They're never going to meet you,
meet you.

651
00:39:00,581 --> 00:39:04,630
They live in another part of the planet
and they could just steam faking,

652
00:39:04,631 --> 00:39:07,990
fuck that guy. They can just
start typing a bunch of shit.

653
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,590
And it's this weird thing going on,
what have you,

654
00:39:10,591 --> 00:39:13,720
but he's kidded themselves
into believing that, you know,

655
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:17,950
you can lead a good ethical life.
Like I can lead a good ethical life,

656
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,130
but some bad phrasiology in a tweet or
something could be a clue to alis secret

657
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,650
in an evil. Yeah. What? You're
really, really back. Yeah.

658
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,480
And I just wonder whether there's
some kind of connection between,

659
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,610
it's about color, you know,
between that and about, um,

660
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,010
the rituals that you find at
places like Bohemian Grove.

661
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:43,690
And maybe the connection is that it's all
about tricking yourself into believing

662
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,880
that you can do evil shit.

663
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:49,840
So like would you give yourself like a
ritual it skull and bones or Bohemian

664
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,120
Grove that makes you feel,
oh,

665
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:55,300
I'm separate and different and better
and that gives me a mandate to rule the

666
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:59,200
world. I could inflict this cottage and
other people because I different to them.

667
00:39:59,201 --> 00:40:00,070
I'm better than them.

668
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:03,580
And maybe on Twitter we do the same thing
and other little ways, which is like,

669
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,541
oh well,
you know,

670
00:40:04,541 --> 00:40:07,570
we're better than that person because
that person just just misuse their

671
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:12,070
privilege. So that person just, just,
you know, showed that true in an evil.

672
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,120
It's all about kind of,

673
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:18,220
it's all about setting yourself apart
from people so that you can behave in, in,

674
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:23,080
in ways that hurt other people.
And you don't have to feel bad about it.

675
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:24,820
Maybe that's the connection.
Well,

676
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:28,690
people have a tendency to pile on.

677
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:33,130
It's always been the case. That's
the reason why you, you see,

678
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:38,131
like when riots break out that that
sort of exploits that type of pile on

679
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:39,730
behavior.

680
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,730
People will do things in large
groups of chaotic moments,

681
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,870
like large groups of chaos.
Rather they would,

682
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:49,390
they would never do with an individual,
you know,

683
00:40:49,391 --> 00:40:54,391
as far as like assaulting people or I
mean there's been instances where uh,

684
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:59,320
gangs of people beat up and killed
people and the people that were involved

685
00:40:59,321 --> 00:41:03,400
almost didn't feel responsible because
they were one of many that stomp somebody

686
00:41:03,401 --> 00:41:05,560
or kick somebody or went over somebody's,

687
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:10,210
this snowflake doesn't need
to feel responsible for the
avalanche. Yeah, exactly.

688
00:41:10,211 --> 00:41:11,290
That's a great way of putting it.

689
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,100
And I think diffusion of responsibility
is a real issue with human beings when

690
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:18,220
it comes to large numbers. Uh,
anytime there's large numbers,

691
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:21,940
they don't feel responsible for any
repercussions are of their actions.

692
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,880
If there was only two
people in the world and to,

693
00:41:24,881 --> 00:41:27,970
people in the world were somehow or
another invented Twitter and they were

694
00:41:27,971 --> 00:41:30,900
communicating with each other.
And One guy, uh, you know,

695
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,410
said something questionable and the,
the other guy quoted him and said,

696
00:41:36,411 --> 00:41:41,150
John Ronson is a piece of shit. Here
is proof. You know, fuck this guy.

697
00:41:41,151 --> 00:41:44,900
Let's shame him. What's this? Let's
is only you does it, you know,

698
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,460
there's no one there.

699
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,060
But what you're trying to do is they're
appealing to the bully instinct of

700
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,740
people to just pile on.

701
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,860
And I'm torn because sometimes I think
publicly shaming people is a good thing.

702
00:41:58,870 --> 00:42:03,870
Like if it's actual social
justice to rights and wrongs.

703
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:04,911
But the problem is,

704
00:42:04,911 --> 00:42:09,911
I think these days we're in this really
bad situation where people have decided

705
00:42:09,921 --> 00:42:14,921
to not differentiate between a serious
transgression and an unserious challenge

706
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:20,120
points. And some nice liberal person
who tells a joke that comes out badly,

707
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,940
is treated with a similar
level of ferocity.

708
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:27,320
It's like a racist cop from the
McKinney Texas video. Well, most the,

709
00:42:27,321 --> 00:42:31,610
that's a very good way of putting it.
I think most people are not living life,

710
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:36,380
even they're going through life with
a deficit and they started out with is

711
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:39,110
devastated by having a bunch of fucking
shitty experiences when they were

712
00:42:39,111 --> 00:42:39,920
children.

713
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,920
They're shitty parents and bad time in
school and maybe they'd been picked on

714
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:49,190
and maybe their job socks or maybe they
have unfulfilled sexual expectations.

715
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,330
Whatever the fuck it is.

716
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:54,820
Most people are going
into any situation with a,

717
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:59,120
a headwind or a tailwind, I guess it
is when someone, something behind you,

718
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:02,030
Pale ones, right? Tailwind,
the headwind is your drive.

719
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,190
There's push behind them,

720
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:08,090
but they're like accelerates their
reaction to anything and they're almost

721
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:12,950
looking for something that they
can blame their bad feeling on it.

722
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:17,951
Almost looking for a target to unleash
all there an existential angst and

723
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:22,310
frustration and life.
All their unfulfilled expectations.

724
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:25,910
All of it is on John Ronson.
Shitty tweet, you know,

725
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:29,360
and I wish he stopped and easy to direct.
I'm sorry,

726
00:43:29,361 --> 00:43:33,300
I'll just fuck someone else.
Um,

727
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,890
but I've experienced it
before. I have experienced,
but I've, I found it adorable.

728
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,170
I would retweet people and
stuff when they did it to me.

729
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:40,350
But what I always liked to,

730
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:44,270
I noticed cause after my public shaming
book came out, obviously you know a lot,

731
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,030
there was a lot of pushback and a lot of
people went for me and I always really

732
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:51,140
liked it when people went from me in a
kind of a ridiculous way cause that could

733
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:52,880
retweet that one.
It would make me look good.

734
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:55,370
I know it was one of
my favorite one was um,

735
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,700
all these people started like going
for me and one person wrote why and I

736
00:44:00,921 --> 00:44:02,780
wasn't,
I just stayed completely silent.

737
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,380
And one person wrote why some John and
applying to any of us and somebody else

738
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:11,270
wrote because John Watson under applies
to men and I'm not, fuck does that mean,

739
00:44:11,271 --> 00:44:15,890
yeah, honestly like I'm like,
I'm so upset at you for ah,

740
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:21,050
um, s wow, okay. Well in
that particular instance,

741
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,860
um, it all started with
Justine sacco. I wrote,

742
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,750
there's a chapter in my book
that's defends Justine Sacco,

743
00:44:30,050 --> 00:44:34,030
who's the AIDS tweet woman.
Remember on the plane, listen man,

744
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:38,010
that lady is probably on Xanax and wine
and she said something that she thought

745
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:41,940
was funny. That would be funny if she was
your friend. I like to be funny if she,

746
00:44:41,941 --> 00:44:46,050
well she was my friend and she told me
she sent that to me in a text message.

747
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:50,400
I would fucking laugh. Yeah. You know, I'm
going to Africa, hope I don't get aids.

748
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,940
Lol. Just kidding. I'm white.
Yeah. And then the worst thing it,

749
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,060
then she gets on the plane.
Yeah. She gets on the plane,

750
00:44:57,061 --> 00:45:02,061
turns off her phone while she's asleep
is like just tailored to shreds by like

751
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,460
16 hours,
hundreds of thousands of people.

752
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:09,180
And one of the most extraordinary
things about it is that her inability to

753
00:45:09,181 --> 00:45:14,160
explain herself became part
of the hilarity. That was,
that was the tailwind. Like,

754
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,970
oh my God, we know something.
She doesn't. One person tweeted,

755
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:23,150
we're about to watch this Justine sacco
bitch get fired in real time before she

756
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:25,860
even knows she's being fired.

757
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:29,460
And I just kinda think of anything
more unjust than that. So,

758
00:45:29,461 --> 00:45:34,160
so I wrote this really passionate,
you know, polemic defending her.

759
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:36,330
I think that, you know, we had gone crazy,

760
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:39,300
we'd lost our minds and they said it
was the most in judicial thing you could

761
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:42,960
possibly think of.
And a lot of people,

762
00:45:42,961 --> 00:45:45,330
if you can imagine kind of really
objected to that. So of course,

763
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,180
cause they have the green light to object.

764
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,400
I mean it's not that you're not
saying something reasonable.

765
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,490
I thought it was one of the most important
stores I ever did because like for,

766
00:45:53,491 --> 00:45:56,730
for 30 years I've been
writing about abuses of power.

767
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,430
Like in the psychopath test,

768
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,520
they're pieces of power in the
pharmaceutical industry or, or you know,

769
00:46:02,521 --> 00:46:06,690
the worst excesses of psychiatry or
psychopaths. So whatever, whatever,

770
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,120
the people abusing their power over there.

771
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,550
And whenever I like gave talks about
that, I'd like to, whom we'd love her,

772
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:16,350
you know, people would love it.
And then I write this new story,

773
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:18,600
this new book where I say,
you know what?

774
00:46:18,601 --> 00:46:20,970
The people are abusing our
power now that they're us.

775
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:24,640
It's like we've suddenly got all this
new power of Twitter and social media and

776
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,190
we're massively abusing it.

777
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,500
And the pushback is ferocious because
the pushback is from the very people who

778
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:34,030
enjoyed abusing his power. Yeah. Yeah.

779
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:37,770
I have been talking about this for a
while and I think that what's going on now

780
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,830
with with people and
the Internet and this,

781
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:45,330
this new found ability to communicate
that we find ourselves in this new found

782
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:49,260
situation we find ourselves in where
anyone instantaneously can comment on

783
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,970
virtually anything that
happens in the world.

784
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,430
And if what you say resonates or offense,

785
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:57,810
it can become a hot button and it just
like gets all these ants just find the

786
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:02,280
sugar and they just dive on it and
they just swarm and it's almost like a

787
00:47:02,281 --> 00:47:06,900
mindless thing because I think that what
we're experience is an adolescent stage

788
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:10,140
of a new level of communication that
human beings are experiencing. Yeah.

789
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,490
I think that this new level
of communication is starting
off with the ability to

790
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:17,820
just tweet at each other and it's going
to eventually go into some weird virtual

791
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:22,650
reality place that's and lets people
filet, you know my friend Colleen? Yeah.

792
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:24,540
A couple of years ago,
my friend Adam Curtis,

793
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:28,060
cause actually flip phones
and live in the desert. Well,

794
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,280
cut your own woods in the,
basically

795
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,000
I found out from curse, he said to
me, uh, who you'd love by the way,

796
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:37,720
if you don't know his stuff, he knows,
Oh God, you'd love him. He made, um,

797
00:47:38,110 --> 00:47:42,740
the power of nightmares and the century
of the southeast great doc, BBC. Dot.

798
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,350
Yeah. And we, Adam said to
me one time that, you know,

799
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:51,970
he thinks that the internet or definitely
social media is going to be like one

800
00:47:51,971 --> 00:47:55,840
of those John Carpenter movies from the
80s where everybody's yelling at each

801
00:47:55,841 --> 00:47:59,260
other and everyone's like killing each
other and eventually everyone flees to

802
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:02,500
somewhere safer like the suburbs. And
maybe that's because I do, you know,

803
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:06,020
I noticed myself feeling a bit from
social media. So we're talking about,

804
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:10,100
yeah, I, I never, I, I
when a long time ago,

805
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,480
maybe 10 years ago or so, um, I would
argue with people online all the time.

806
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,930
And then I realized what an
enormous waste of time and is also,

807
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:21,890
I realized that I'm not picking the people
that I communicate with as opposed to

808
00:48:21,891 --> 00:48:23,000
the way you do it in real life.

809
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,260
And one of the things that I would do in
real life is I would avoid anybody that

810
00:48:27,261 --> 00:48:30,830
starts arguments in a shitty all the time.
People were insulting and Shitty.

811
00:48:30,831 --> 00:48:33,020
I would argue, I wouldn't argue
with them, I would avoid them.

812
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:37,180
But on the Internet I would like
engage these people, you know,

813
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:39,740
and like I'll get you, yeah
you fucking loser, you know?

814
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,500
But you realize after a while like,
oh,

815
00:48:42,501 --> 00:48:45,410
this is a new thing
and I'm applying to it.

816
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:48,860
Like the sort of same strategy that I
would apply to a heckler at a comedy club

817
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:51,260
and you really can't,
like this is it,

818
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,930
this is a totally new thing and no one
knows how to do it yet is we, we, we,

819
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,290
we don't have the benefit of hindsight
to be able to step in. And you know,

820
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,980
we're talking like 2000 2001 we didn't
have the benefit of stepping back and

821
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:07,370
saying, well this has been going on for
a long time and now we understand how to,

822
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:08,930
how to deal with people.

823
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,670
But back then we didn't
and I wasted a lot of time,

824
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:17,280
had some fun but wasted a lot of time.
And also you,

825
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:22,281
you get emotionally charged up and
invested in these people that in real life

826
00:49:22,851 --> 00:49:26,060
you probably wouldn't want to hang out
with them pulling up the amaze folks to

827
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:26,894
be with.

828
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,800
They are. And, and just the Internet
is turning us into, you know,

829
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,600
he's an empathetic psychopathic
figures. I mean, you know,

830
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:35,790
maybe from that and the new life
that beast, that'd be sweet.

831
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:40,320
Well you wouldn't know them first of all
based on their tweets because a tweet

832
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:44,450
is one of the worst representations
of you. Yeah, it's good.

833
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:48,060
It has to be kind of extreme
hundred and 40 characters. I mean,

834
00:49:48,061 --> 00:49:50,520
sometimes it can be poignant.
Sometimes he can be funny,

835
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:54,360
but like to sum you up from first of all,

836
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:57,390
to sum you up by your writing is difficult
enough as it is when you're writing

837
00:49:57,391 --> 00:50:00,720
chapters in paragraphs
without any back and forth.

838
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,860
It's hard because I don't think we
are just who we are as an individual.

839
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:05,850
I think we,
we are,

840
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,150
we are who we are based on who we're
interacting with and how that works out.

841
00:50:11,221 --> 00:50:12,660
Like that's who you really are.

842
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:17,250
That's one of the things
that's so important about
choosing your friends because

843
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:21,540
your friends aren't just someone you
enjoy that kind of help define you.

844
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,370
And when you have a bunch of
really good friends and you,

845
00:50:25,371 --> 00:50:29,840
you communicate with them well and get
a lot out of it, it changes who you are.

846
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,600
You become a better person. You
can give, become a better person,

847
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:35,840
a really good relationship and you
can become an awful person in a bad

848
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:39,440
relationship. You know, I've been in bad
relationships before. I didn't like me.

849
00:50:39,441 --> 00:50:42,760
I'm like, this person hates me. I
don't even like me anymore. Like what?

850
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:46,000
What the fuck is going on?
And it's because we're, we,

851
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,500
we like to think of ourselves
as completely autonomous,

852
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,240
but I don't think that's real.

853
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,310
I don't think there's anybody
that's really autonomous.

854
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,610
I think we all need
human beings and we all,

855
00:50:55,620 --> 00:51:00,350
we all cherish human interaction.
As much as you want privacy,

856
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,450
you don't want it all the time.
I mean,

857
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:07,220
if you had to choose between no privacy
or no people, I would take no privacy.

858
00:51:07,221 --> 00:51:10,580
Every time I like people, the
people are great, you know,

859
00:51:10,581 --> 00:51:13,910
I don't want to be bothered all the time
and that's when people will think the

860
00:51:13,911 --> 00:51:15,650
woods seem like a great idea.

861
00:51:15,651 --> 00:51:18,740
I'm just going to go unibomber and
just fucking live in the woods. But no,

862
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,290
you don't. You don't
want to do that. Like we,

863
00:51:22,291 --> 00:51:25,130
we literally are a super organism.

864
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:30,650
We are not like one individual
experiencing the universe
solely on our own where

865
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,130
we are all constantly
interacting with each other.

866
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:38,490
Yeah. Which I think is part of the
reason by social, by social media,

867
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:43,491
public shaming is so fucking traumatizing
to somebody on the receiving end is

868
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,530
nothing, you know, to be a to B,

869
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,560
two B ejected from society to be told you
not as good as everybody else does get

870
00:51:51,841 --> 00:51:56,310
out is like deeply traumatizing.
But then the people doing the shaming,

871
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:59,670
they don't want to think that. They
don't really think that they've just, um,

872
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,760
potentially done something intensely
traumatizing to another human being that

873
00:52:05,011 --> 00:52:08,640
mangled up somebodies mental
health. So they just think,
oh, I'm sure they're fine.

874
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,130
You know, I'm sure that fire,
that person who just showed
up. Sure, they're fine. Um,

875
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,360
um, you know, there's a guy, uh,

876
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:20,220
please dyadic Gorka who reviewed my
book in one of the papers who basically

877
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:24,150
said, oh, John Watson. So sweet. You know,

878
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:29,400
it's fine. You know, if you, if you're
a man being publicly shamed, it's fine.

879
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,080
It's no big deal. They're just fine. And
then I was looking at this as thinking,

880
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,150
fucking hell. You know, I've, I've gone
around the world, meet these people.

881
00:52:36,151 --> 00:52:38,400
They're not,
they are not fucking fine.

882
00:52:38,610 --> 00:52:40,560
Is that whether you want to
carry on doing it or not,

883
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,910
you have to accept they are
not fine. You know, people,

884
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:45,811
well,

885
00:52:45,811 --> 00:52:50,280
a few weeks after that guy wrote that
review some guy in Israel who had been

886
00:52:50,281 --> 00:52:55,080
falsely accused of being racist,
uh, committed suicide. Uh,

887
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:58,860
you know, they're not fine. It's that
you can carry on doing it if you want,

888
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,620
but it's a really severe
fucking punishment.

889
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:07,470
Well, this mob mentality has
existed throughout history. I mean,

890
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:09,330
when you go back to,
uh,

891
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:14,160
the punishing of the witches in
Salem or would they do in Africa,

892
00:53:14,161 --> 00:53:15,300
have you ever seen the,
these,

893
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:20,330
these witchcraft accusation things in
Africa where one person will tell someone

894
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:24,030
that someone's a witch and then everybody
else in the tribe believes it and

895
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,340
they're burning people.
This is really disturbing

896
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,120
videos,

897
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:31,620
but it's like this pile on where I
think part of what's going on is,

898
00:53:31,621 --> 00:53:35,730
is a real fear of that same
thing could happen to them.

899
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:38,340
And so they lash out that
one person like with,

900
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,560
with real commitment so that they're
inextricably a part of the group.

901
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:44,453
They're in that group.

902
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,880
They're safe for that day because we
can only handle destroying one person.

903
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,500
And I notice with just 10 soccer,
one person that night tweeted,

904
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:57,480
somebody's HIV positive should rape this
bitch and then we'll find out if her

905
00:53:57,481 --> 00:53:59,280
skin color protects her from aids.

906
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:04,320
And you know how many people went after
that person? No one is like we would to,

907
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,330
everyone was too excited about destroyed.

908
00:54:06,331 --> 00:54:09,600
Just stayed to simultaneously destroy
somebody who was at appropriately

909
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,230
destroyed. Just aids it up. Has it got
a fucking total free pass that night.

910
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,280
I imagine the mindset of someone to
think that the best way to respond to

911
00:54:18,691 --> 00:54:23,691
someone's inappropriate joke is to rape
them and give them an incurable deadly

912
00:54:25,651 --> 00:54:30,390
disease. I just in, I let feel
totally justified doing it.

913
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,790
I'm Justine was asleep
out of fucking play.

914
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:37,620
I everyone and everyone knew that and
that's why everyone loved it so much.

915
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,620
Well didn't she write a bunch of other
ridiculous tweets like that was what she

916
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,160
was trying to be. Twitter?
Yeah. I mean it was a few.

917
00:54:44,161 --> 00:54:48,030
I had that one was I had a sex dream
about an autistic kid last night.

918
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:51,390
I didn't know it was something about,
you know, it's just stupid shit. Um,

919
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,550
I bet she's fun to drink with.
Yeah.

920
00:54:53,551 --> 00:54:56,190
When I had a couple of drinks so she
wasn't fun the first time cause she was so

921
00:54:56,191 --> 00:54:58,800
fucking crushed.
It just a couple of weeks late,

922
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:03,120
probably took years off of her life. Oh
Jesus. Poor GST. Um, the second time,

923
00:55:03,121 --> 00:55:07,770
was she okay. Better the second time
and it took her a year. It was a year.

924
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,180
She was basically recover.
Yeah.

925
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:12,750
She was basically fucked and in the
wilderness for a year, you know,

926
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:17,230
a notice actually after my book came out,
one of the pushbacks was like,

927
00:55:18,330 --> 00:55:20,250
well, you know, just in
soccer is fine now. You know,

928
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:24,090
she was only like unemployed on, you
know, deeply traumatized for a year.

929
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,890
And I'm like, for one fucking
joke that [inaudible] a year,

930
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:34,010
you know. Oh my God. Yeah. Well that joke
was representative of the hardest part.

931
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:38,250
Yeah. Is that this is what we
fucking do. And it's such a lie.

932
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,770
It's like we're all these
fucking Miss Marples,

933
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:45,771
all these amateur sleuths I'd social
media thinking that we can spot somebody

934
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:48,990
true inner evil to a
little bit of phrasiology.

935
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,260
That's what happened to Trevor Noah.
And it just happens over and over and uh,

936
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:55,710
and it's actually Amy Schumer and it
just happens over and over and over again

937
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:59,700
with Amy Schumer and Trevor Noah though
their standups, and especially Amy.

938
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:02,220
Amy doesn't give a fuck.
Like you can't,

939
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:07,320
that she gives a bit more of a fuck
then I just think everybody who's at the

940
00:56:07,321 --> 00:56:10,950
receiving end of that, it does, but
it gives her an out, first of all,

941
00:56:10,951 --> 00:56:15,540
she doesn't ever say anything that is
indefensible because she's very smart.

942
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:19,950
And also I think as a comic,
everything that she says,

943
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:24,010
that's ridiculous. Um, if you
want to debate her on like,

944
00:56:24,010 --> 00:56:24,521
why are not,

945
00:56:24,521 --> 00:56:29,410
I mean she plays the role of a dumb person
saying ridiculous shit all the time.

946
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:34,411
Like that's part of like a persona that
she'll adopt and abandoned on stage.

947
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,340
She'll adopt it and abandoned and you
know, going in, that's what she's doing.

948
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:42,760
It's a part of being
entertaining. It's like, you know,

949
00:56:43,050 --> 00:56:46,240
a Richard Pryor doing the
dopey white guy voice.

950
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:49,840
Do I think he's really Adobe white
guy now when he's like, hey my mom,

951
00:56:49,841 --> 00:56:53,830
she's a great old Gal. No, he's
doing the fucking character of a,

952
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:58,090
a dopey person. It's easy to mock this.
The same thing that Amy does when she's,

953
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,110
she might not change her voice, but
when she says ridiculous shit, she's,

954
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,000
she's clearly being a comic and doing
it as an art form. Right. You know, so

955
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:11,040
she can move through a few times on
your podcast by the way. And, and uh,

956
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:14,540
that in a little while. Right. But
she's been, she's got her show.

957
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:16,820
I haven't talked to her forever.
She's busy as fuck.

958
00:57:16,821 --> 00:57:21,220
She's got that movie coming out. But,
uh, she's very smart. She's very smart.

959
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:24,710
And so she would welcome any opportunity
to defend anything like that.

960
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:28,370
She doesn't take herself like ridiculously
seriously or anything like that.

961
00:57:28,371 --> 00:57:29,900
She's very smart girl.

962
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:34,010
But I fitness as a really woman
wouldn't want her calling me a boy.

963
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,060
I think it's,

964
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:41,940
there's like a serious change going on
in the way that human beings act towards

965
00:57:41,941 --> 00:57:46,300
you. So do you like it? No, I think
it's really bad. It's stressful.

966
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:50,020
Who would have thought? The
public shaming part? Yeah.

967
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,490
I mean what I do like is the fact that
there's a leveling of the playing field

968
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:58,420
and social justice is, you know, obviously
that side of things I really liked. But,

969
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,760
but the problem is, you know, is that the,

970
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,630
I think the problem I tell you it is like
I would call it in London, in the ATS,

971
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:09,130
and sometimes I feel with social media
and with the social justice movement,

972
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:12,820
it's like the worst fucker
who used to hang around.

973
00:58:12,821 --> 00:58:16,210
The student union now
gets to decide everything.

974
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:20,020
And it's partly because of like the
hundred and 40 character Twitter thing.

975
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:21,640
So basically,
you know,

976
00:58:21,641 --> 00:58:25,150
in the student union in the 1980s
we all cared about social justice,

977
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:30,510
but it's like the most unforgiving extreme
fucker is now the one who's actually

978
00:58:31,061 --> 00:58:34,600
setting the agenda and not only
setting the agenda on social media,

979
00:58:34,601 --> 00:58:38,710
but because the mainstream media is so
enthralled to social media and doesn't

980
00:58:38,711 --> 00:58:41,970
want to get hurt. So it goes along
with it. It's kind of critic,

981
00:58:41,971 --> 00:58:45,990
an entire society of, of, of
a surveillance society and

982
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,990
colleges are where people first start
exercising that muscle and it's the most

983
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:54,510
rabid version of this issue today.

984
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:57,900
It's one of the reasons why
a lot of Comedians won't
perform in colleges anymore.

985
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,440
Jerry Seinfeld just got a hard time from
a bunch of people because he said that

986
00:59:01,441 --> 00:59:05,100
colleges are too politically correct
and Chris rock has seen the same thing.

987
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,730
And I stopped doing colleges a long
fucking time ago for the very same reason.

988
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:12,210
Yeah, well I did a college once and
this is a perfect example of it,

989
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:13,800
but this is a guy,
this,

990
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:17,430
this example is perfect because
this is before the Internet. Um,

991
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:22,250
and this was a guy that I actually talked
to face to face. Like someone said,

992
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:27,230
uh, you know, like I would do colleges
and I'd fly into these towns and you know,

993
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:28,064
their board.

994
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,670
So like I'd tell my jokes and then
sometimes I do look Q and a with them.

995
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,910
You know, just for fun cause
it's a fun way to like you,

996
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,720
you'll let the kids get to ask questions
and you get to fuck around and come up

997
00:59:38,721 --> 00:59:42,440
with things on the fly. And
uh, some, some guy said,

998
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:46,400
do you know any joke jokes or something
along those lines? Right. And I said,

999
00:59:46,401 --> 00:59:48,830
I don't remember anyone. I go
out car. I remember this one,

1000
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:53,480
two Jews walk into a bar, they buy
it. Like it's the end of the joke.

1001
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,900
It's stupid. It's terrible. That joke.

1002
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,710
A guy came up to me after the show and
said, that joke do you did about juices.

1003
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,450
Very offensive.
I said,

1004
01:00:02,451 --> 01:00:06,230
what's offensive about it that
Jews are successful at business?

1005
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,400
What's offensive that I use the
word Jew to Jews walk into a bar.

1006
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,590
They went to a bar.
What parts offensive?

1007
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,020
Or are you just looking to be
offended or you actually offended?

1008
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,670
And he was flabbergasted.

1009
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:19,880
He didn't know what to say because he
was a fucking 19 year old kid and he

1010
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:20,714
thought he had his,

1011
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,920
he was an awkward socially awkward person
and he thought this is my opportunity

1012
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,420
to be right. And he just,
Oh, I'm offended. Like,

1013
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,820
and there's all these kids
supporting each other. Yes,

1014
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:35,060
you do have the right to be offended
and they're all fucking dumbest shit and

1015
01:00:35,061 --> 01:00:37,670
they don't have any life experience.
And they really,

1016
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,580
they don't have a nuanced
view of the world yet.

1017
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,820
And they're exercising this new muscle,

1018
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:47,570
this new muscle of learning how
to call someone on their bullshit,

1019
01:00:47,571 --> 01:00:51,110
man on the patriarchy,
on the CIS,

1020
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,120
cis gendered male, Hetero
normative bullshit that you
see every day. And they're,

1021
01:00:56,121 --> 01:00:59,690
they're like finding this,
this opportunity to express his rates.

1022
01:00:59,691 --> 01:01:00,650
And then eventually,

1023
01:01:01,070 --> 01:01:05,390
hopefully they'll settle in and hopefully
they'll sort of like, as time goes on,

1024
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:08,810
they have more experience. They'll sort
of realize how ridiculous they were,

1025
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:13,070
you know, when they were younger. But
it's like a natural inclination to like,

1026
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:16,220
you know, you fucked up and you
know you've done wrong things.

1027
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:20,960
So when you see it in other people call
it. So this one kid that said this to me,

1028
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:23,570
I mean, that was the extent of our
conversation. I said, that's ridiculous.

1029
01:01:23,571 --> 01:01:27,800
Like what's not offensive? I go, I'm,
first of all, I don't tell I'm not racist.

1030
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:31,240
And if I told a racist joke, he'd have
to be a really good, you know, and then,

1031
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,460
and he goes, we should never tell racist
jokes. Like, oh, that's not true. I go,

1032
01:01:34,461 --> 01:01:37,280
if you, if you make me laugh
with a really funny racist joke,

1033
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:39,110
I'm thankful because you made me laugh.

1034
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,490
I don't think you think that everything
you say is a fucking sworn statement,

1035
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,680
an affidavit that you're
getting giving in court.

1036
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:48,890
I assume that when you're doing
the art of standup comedy,

1037
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,370
you're going to say things you don't
really mean because they're funnier than

1038
01:01:52,371 --> 01:01:54,650
what you really mean.
And that's part of the art form.

1039
01:01:54,770 --> 01:01:57,620
Just like when you listen to a song,
you know,

1040
01:01:57,621 --> 01:02:01,400
Bob Marley didn't really
shoot the sheriff. Okay.
Probably didn't shoot anybody.

1041
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:05,360
And it's like, it's, it's, it's part
of the art. It's making shit up.

1042
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:09,170
And when you take that away because
people are going to be offended,

1043
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:12,560
well then you remove almost every
movie that's ever been made.

1044
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,230
You remove almost every book
that's ever been written.

1045
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:19,470
You take away almost every standup
comedian set and you just get you,

1046
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,340
you fucking

1047
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:22,950
nerf the shit out of the
world and everybody is boring.

1048
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,640
And that's not the answer.
It's not the answer.

1049
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,780
I think this is a meniscus
or the reason why I, I,

1050
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:34,800
I'm so happy to have done the Justine
sacco story in my book because I had so

1051
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:36,870
much pushback and each
time I get pushed back,

1052
01:02:36,871 --> 01:02:39,120
I feel more and more happy that I did it.

1053
01:02:39,390 --> 01:02:42,450
Like [inaudible] gave a talk in knowledge.

1054
01:02:42,451 --> 01:02:45,840
One of the first talks I gave
was a knowledge in England. Um,

1055
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:50,070
and somebody in the Q and a, somebody
said to me, somebody called out,

1056
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:54,990
are you a racist? And I was like, cause I
defended just him and his like, you know,

1057
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:57,360
so for 30 years I'm writing
about abuses of power.

1058
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,720
And the first time I say we're the one's
abusing our power. So when he goes out,

1059
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:04,790
are you a racist? And then, um, um,

1060
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,350
I can try to fill it with,
he isn't that one person is our,

1061
01:03:10,351 --> 01:03:15,351
you're just dealing with really simple
thinking or that's just not a nuanced

1062
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:22,080
objective.
Well thought out view of a human being.

1063
01:03:22,081 --> 01:03:26,970
What they're doing is looking for an
opportunity to call you out on something.

1064
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,450
Yeah. Looking for an opportunity
to shame you. And that's what I,

1065
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:34,320
the problem I have with all this social
justice warrior bullshit that's going on

1066
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:35,830
in the world is it's Manufa,

1067
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:40,680
it's manufacturing a lot of hate and
it's manuf manifesting itself in a very

1068
01:03:40,710 --> 01:03:43,120
angry way.
Where what,

1069
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:47,730
what should be people that are pro
gay rights, Pro Chan's gender rights,

1070
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:50,880
pro gay marriage pro,
a pro piece,

1071
01:03:50,881 --> 01:03:55,881
pro choice pro love
pro left wing ideology.

1072
01:03:55,981 --> 01:04:00,330
You know there's like do unto others
as you out have them do onto you.

1073
01:04:00,331 --> 01:04:04,560
This whole idea of like creating a more
peaceful world and the way they're going

1074
01:04:04,561 --> 01:04:08,520
to do it is by ruining everybody who
doesn't agree with them and shitting all

1075
01:04:08,521 --> 01:04:12,600
over them and insulting
them and not distinguishing
between what's actual social

1076
01:04:12,601 --> 01:04:16,040
justice and what's the kind of Cathartic
alternatives to social justice like

1077
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:16,620
it's structured.

1078
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,160
Have tested the deception
of Justine doesn't do any
good for anybody because she

1079
01:04:20,161 --> 01:04:23,230
wasn't even intending to be racist.
She was trying to make a liquid. She,

1080
01:04:23,231 --> 01:04:26,280
so it'd be like coach, he's going to be
like Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Right?

1081
01:04:26,281 --> 01:04:31,281
This isn't someone who's going after a
cop that shot a kid with a fake pistol or

1082
01:04:31,651 --> 01:04:34,560
anything. You know? This is, yeah,
exactly. And this is the real problem.

1083
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:39,070
And the inability to distinguish between
the citizens discretion on the unsafest

1084
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:43,580
transgression and what is creating as a
kind of surveillance society as kind of

1085
01:04:43,581 --> 01:04:47,640
stars. He where everybody's more fearful.
Everyone's scared to say things. Um,

1086
01:04:47,730 --> 01:04:51,840
the great thing about social media was
how it gave a voice to voiceless people.

1087
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,130
And now people are fleeing social media
because they're realizing that the

1088
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:58,710
smartest way to survive is to
go back to being voiceless. See,

1089
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,780
I don't think that's true.
I don't think they are fleeing.

1090
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:03,720
I think they're jumping out in droves.
I think some people are jumping off,

1091
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:04,950
but I think that what you said,

1092
01:05:04,951 --> 01:05:07,140
the great thing about it is
it gives a voice to people.

1093
01:05:07,290 --> 01:05:12,180
It's also a terrible thing about
it. But I think what this is, is,

1094
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:16,620
as I said before, is this is like a,
this adolescent stage of communication.

1095
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:21,130
We're reaching this new
level of interaction where
we can interact with each

1096
01:05:21,131 --> 01:05:23,920
other instantaneously.
And that's just never,

1097
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:29,070
by the way Tesla predicted this to Tesla
predicted smartphones a hundred years

1098
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,161
ago.
And I,

1099
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:35,161
I tweeted this quote today that somebody
sent my way absolutely fascinating.

1100
01:05:35,430 --> 01:05:39,940
Um, it was, uh, not just
a quote. It was a, um, a,

1101
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:41,050
um,
a,

1102
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:45,340
a piece that Tesla had
written and life in 1920s,

1103
01:05:45,610 --> 01:05:48,640
amazing where he predicted smartphones,

1104
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:53,470
like literally described a modern smart
phone scroll down like w w were his

1105
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:57,400
actual words like, no, no, it's
below that. You actually read it.

1106
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:00,190
When wireless is perfectly applied,

1107
01:06:00,191 --> 01:06:03,190
the whole earth will be
converted into a huge brain,

1108
01:06:03,191 --> 01:06:08,191
which in fact it is all things being
particles have a real and rhythmic whole.

1109
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:11,350
We shall be able to communicate
with one another instantly,

1110
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:14,080
irrespective of distance.
Not only this,

1111
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:17,320
but through television
and telephony like phones,

1112
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:21,970
we shall be able to hear one another as
perfectly as though we were face to face

1113
01:06:21,971 --> 01:06:26,971
despite intervening distances of thousands
of miles and the instruments through

1114
01:06:27,551 --> 01:06:31,780
which we shall be able to do this.
We'll do this.

1115
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:35,990
Do His will be, oh, do
his will, Huh? To do, hey.

1116
01:06:36,430 --> 01:06:41,430
Oh Dude will be amazingly simple
compared with our present telephone.

1117
01:06:41,771 --> 01:06:45,430
A man will be able to carry one in
his vest pocket. Holy Shit. Fuck.

1118
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:48,760
That is unbelievable.
Fucking unbelievable. When
you read that paragraph,

1119
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:53,710
you think TSF, Oma, God, you know
when we have that world for ourselves,

1120
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,660
what an amazing we'll do.
It will beer.

1121
01:06:55,661 --> 01:07:00,010
The beer world of curiosity will be a
world of like understanding strangers of

1122
01:07:00,011 --> 01:07:02,440
nuance of contexts and said,

1123
01:07:02,441 --> 01:07:05,740
we have the world and we
completely throw away curiosity.

1124
01:07:05,741 --> 01:07:09,070
We throw away once we throw away
contexts and what we have instead is

1125
01:07:09,071 --> 01:07:14,010
condemnation. Well with dummies,
but not with everybody on TV.

1126
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:14,590
Look,

1127
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:18,640
I'm way more informed now than I ever
would have been if I had grown up in the

1128
01:07:18,641 --> 01:07:23,641
1960s like if I grown up in the 1960s
and I was a 47 year old man in 1967 I

1129
01:07:24,131 --> 01:07:28,300
wouldn't know Jack Shit. I would be an
ape. I mean that is true. But I do fair,

1130
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:30,550
you know, my, I mean I
do fear that, you know,

1131
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,380
maybe there's two types
of people in the world.

1132
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:36,540
Those people who favor humans over
ideology and those people have favorite

1133
01:07:36,541 --> 01:07:41,230
ideology of humans. And Right now the
ID looks uh, a winning on central.

1134
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:43,600
I don't think they are.
I think they did not. No,

1135
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:46,300
I just think they're making more noise.
And I think that it's,

1136
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:51,010
it's really a matter of who
those ideological people
are surrounding themselves

1137
01:07:51,011 --> 01:07:51,310
with.

1138
01:07:51,310 --> 01:07:55,600
I think they could be swayed into a more
understanding nature and we can decide

1139
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:59,260
this is what somebody wrote about my
book, which I really great with. Uh,

1140
01:07:59,290 --> 01:07:59,921
something about,
you know,

1141
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:04,300
we can decide who to listen
to that with Justine sacco.

1142
01:08:04,301 --> 01:08:07,590
The problem was that the bullies one la,

1143
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:11,530
everyone is too scared to defend chesty
nobody defended just do that. No sub you,

1144
01:08:11,531 --> 01:08:13,480
you brave bastard. Look at you. Yeah.

1145
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:18,510
Well a woman code handling
Lewis who writes for the
New Statesman wrote a review

1146
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:22,550
of my public shaming book. She said that
she tries to defend Justine at night.

1147
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:27,240
She wrote, I'm not sure. The joke was
intended to be racist and straight. Yeah,

1148
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:31,520
I'd straight away she got this fury
of you're just a privilege bitch too.

1149
01:08:31,730 --> 01:08:35,690
So she said to her, to her shame, she shut
up. And that's what happened that night.

1150
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,250
Like everybody shut up.

1151
01:08:37,550 --> 01:08:41,510
And it wasn't just on social media like
the mainstream media or got involved.

1152
01:08:41,511 --> 01:08:43,080
It was like, you know, and,

1153
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:46,480
and that became like the
dominant narrative about
Justine sacco was actually,

1154
01:08:46,481 --> 01:08:48,250
it was kind of racist and I,

1155
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:53,030
and anybody who tried to stick up
for her just got, got screamed down.

1156
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:58,190
Well, I'm almost any defending
her in defending her.

1157
01:08:58,191 --> 01:09:00,620
I would say she's
probably a little racist,

1158
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,310
which you can't really think like that.

1159
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:06,680
It's okay to say that if
you're not a little racist.

1160
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:11,840
But in cracking that joke and
saying something like that,

1161
01:09:11,841 --> 01:09:16,820
which is uncertain, unquestionably a
racist joke, just kidding. I'm white. Lol.

1162
01:09:16,950 --> 01:09:19,510
Right? Yeah. That's
fucking racist. You know,

1163
01:09:19,650 --> 01:09:21,980
think that stress for me,

1164
01:09:21,981 --> 01:09:26,240
it's like a bad Randy Newman saga
mean Randy Newman's sign short people.

1165
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:31,180
So people got no reason to live. Like
we also said, I love La. You know,

1166
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,490
is that tongue and cheek as well? Yeah.
This tongue and cheek because he sings,

1167
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:37,610
look at those mountains, look at those
trees, look at that bum over there, man.

1168
01:09:37,611 --> 01:09:39,410
He's down on his knees.
You know,

1169
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:43,460
it's a lot Randy Newman will do is that
he will acknowledge his own privilege

1170
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:48,800
and then do a kind of grotesque, extreme
version of it. So comedy, he does that.

1171
01:09:48,801 --> 01:09:51,470
And so what people who does it and I
love La and I think that's exactly what

1172
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:53,180
just in soccer was doing and that joke,

1173
01:09:53,181 --> 01:09:56,090
she was acknowledging her own
privilege and then mocking it,

1174
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,100
but I didn't kind of
grotesque version of it.

1175
01:09:58,101 --> 01:10:01,270
And the only difference between Justin
and Randy Newman was there just in with

1176
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,090
just wasn't any fucking good at it. Right.
That's a good point. I see your point.

1177
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,500
Um,
it's,

1178
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:11,060
it's hard to argue that it
couldn't possibly offend people,

1179
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:15,560
but the idea that she knew
she was broadcasting it to
all those people that were

1180
01:10:15,561 --> 01:10:16,394
offended.

1181
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:19,640
I think people just don't understand
what the fuck is going on when they say

1182
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:23,040
things online that you know when the
New York Times extracted my book and if

1183
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:27,000
fact check with the New York Times,
phoned up Justine and said to her like,

1184
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,550
so before you got on the plane,

1185
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,330
we used surprise that like he didn't get
any replies because while she was like,

1186
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:35,660
you know all happened after she turned
off her phone and fell asleep and she

1187
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:38,930
said I had 170 Twitter follows.
Nobody ever replies to it.

1188
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:45,000
So she was usually like as a, she's
like yelling into an empty room flight.

1189
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:49,860
So she probably got unreasonably
cocky because of that. Exactly, yeah.

1190
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:53,810
She got on a plane and so she's
probably on Xanax and drinking,

1191
01:10:54,110 --> 01:10:57,290
which is what a lot of people do when
they get on planes. That's like a fucking,

1192
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,960
this lady was explaining to
me that that's, she was like,

1193
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:02,780
like she was bragging about it like,
you mean a glass of wine?

1194
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:07,200
I was Xanax and I don't give a fuck about
anything. She was, it was hilarious.

1195
01:11:07,201 --> 01:11:08,180
She was just talking and I was like,

1196
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:13,181
I wonder how many people take Xanax and
get on planes and apparently talking to

1197
01:11:13,471 --> 01:11:17,050
people that take Xanax, it's super
common, right? They get anxiety,

1198
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,670
they're going to get a long
plane and also sleeping pills.

1199
01:11:20,671 --> 01:11:22,350
People take all asleep sleeping
pills and they get on planes

1200
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,870
can Xanax. I was um, it's when order,

1201
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:29,800
this was happening to me that when the
New York Times, you know, extra Kmart and,

1202
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,370
and it was just so noisy.

1203
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:33,490
It's sort of my noisiest stories
of when the book came out,

1204
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:38,470
it was incredibly noisy. And I went
to the studio to do this video, uh,

1205
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:42,660
like talking about my book and
the woman on before me, um,

1206
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:47,080
was a doctor and she was doing a
video about her book and she said,

1207
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:49,200
what's your book about?
And I said, public shaming,

1208
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:52,360
which is all digital media piece in
the New York Times about Justine sacco.

1209
01:11:52,361 --> 01:11:56,180
And I said, I wrote it. And she said, Oh
wow, God, you must be so happy. I said,

1210
01:11:56,181 --> 01:11:59,200
actually I'm not happy. And she said,
why aren't you happy? And I said,

1211
01:11:59,201 --> 01:12:00,610
cause everyone is just so much noise.

1212
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:05,620
And then he said to what
he want and I said a Xanax,

1213
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:12,930
she got out, tighten, wrote
me a prescription for like
sixties adducts of which,

1214
01:12:12,931 --> 01:12:17,730
by the way, I've had one and a half. Uh,
I don't abuse Xanax. Breath off. Fuck.

1215
01:12:17,731 --> 01:12:21,120
It's easy to get medication and it's
very easy to get medication in United

1216
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,340
States. If you go to the right
doctors, meaning go to any doctor.

1217
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,440
Did you thought fuck, take it?
I took law. I took like a half.

1218
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:32,370
It was like, that made me feel
a bit, I was no longer anxious.

1219
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:36,870
I felt groggy and then I have to
weigh up what would I rather feel?

1220
01:12:36,871 --> 01:12:40,680
Groggy or anxious? Welcome to America.
That's our dilemma. Rocky. All anxious,

1221
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:45,810
groggy, anxious, caffeinated or on
Adderall. But then I thought, God,

1222
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:48,180
like when she said to me,
what are you warm?

1223
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:50,620
Like all I could think of
to say was annex within.

1224
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,070
Did I miss like an amazing opportunity?

1225
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,350
Like I don't know anything I didn't know
anything about, you know, with the light,

1226
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,710
much like way better things than sound.

1227
01:12:58,711 --> 01:13:02,970
Next I could have asked you like
really in a painkillers I guess,

1228
01:13:02,971 --> 01:13:04,710
but you'd have to like
say that you're on pain.

1229
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,920
Xanaxes you could say you have anxiety
and they'll give you a medication. Yeah.

1230
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:10,793
You know,

1231
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,990
I know the guys do a w how do he went
to a doctor to get prescription because

1232
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:19,020
uh,
he was a social justice warrior and a,

1233
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:22,320
he said a bunch of incorrect things and
people attacked him and so he had to go

1234
01:13:22,321 --> 01:13:26,040
to the doctor. So he's freaked out.
Like he got a taste of his own medicine,

1235
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,900
but that fucker I saw him
like six months later.

1236
01:13:28,901 --> 01:13:30,810
It's still shitting on people online.
Like you didn't,

1237
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:34,020
didn't learn from the attack on him.

1238
01:13:34,230 --> 01:13:37,170
Like it's almost like they
get caught up in this,

1239
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:42,590
they get addicted to this drama of
shitting on people of attacking people.

1240
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:45,720
Yeah. It's weird. You know what?
Since I, I mean I don't do it anymore.

1241
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:49,380
I do not pile it on anybody anymore.
Even people who deserve it.

1242
01:13:49,381 --> 01:13:51,760
I tend not to pile in on anymore.
I tell you what,

1243
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:55,050
where I think it still comes from the
fact in my book, the suck for me anyway,

1244
01:13:55,051 --> 01:13:57,180
my book, the psychopath test, I,

1245
01:13:57,181 --> 01:14:01,230
I'm really critical of like labeling
coach and really I'm critical of like the

1246
01:14:01,231 --> 01:14:06,231
fact that the Dsm is 886 pages long and
has a mental disorder for everything.

1247
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:10,860
And uh, and I, I most people I think
agree with me that that's kind of,

1248
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,100
it's like easy to

1249
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,330
agree with me about that.

1250
01:14:13,540 --> 01:14:17,800
But then on social media we do exactly
the same thing we labeled p and yet,

1251
01:14:17,801 --> 01:14:22,290
so the very same people who agree with
me about the, the kind of, you know,

1252
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:24,820
what's wrong with labeling
culture in the world,

1253
01:14:25,240 --> 01:14:27,220
go home and do it
themselves and social media.

1254
01:14:27,221 --> 01:14:32,000
I've been really torn with this
very strange our dear lately. Um,

1255
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:36,070
I had this conversation with my good
friend Duncan Trussell and we were, um,

1256
01:14:36,250 --> 01:14:39,450
we were talking about labels and um,

1257
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,170
and self definition and the, the, the,
the sort of imprisonment of definition.

1258
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:48,730
And I said, well, even words
like names for people. Like,

1259
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,190
my name is Tom, you know, fuck head.
You know, whatever. And that has taught,

1260
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,810
you know, you're a Whitmore and
as a Whitmore, you know, you're,

1261
01:14:55,811 --> 01:14:59,730
you're supposed to stand for something
in this world that I think, yeah,

1262
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,740
we're Ronson's, goddammit,
you're on Rogan. Stephin up. Boy.

1263
01:15:03,610 --> 01:15:07,900
I think these ideas of,
of like having a name,

1264
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:12,760
like a label. Like you're, you're Coca
Cola, you know, you're Jamie Vernon.

1265
01:15:12,970 --> 01:15:16,450
You know, there's this, I think
having, instead of just being,

1266
01:15:16,451 --> 01:15:21,070
you like having names even dames
themselves, like, and he'd say, Oh,

1267
01:15:21,071 --> 01:15:25,750
well you know what to expect. It's
that fucking John Ronson guy. You know,

1268
01:15:25,751 --> 01:15:29,110
like all of a sudden you
can be boxed in and defined.

1269
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:33,970
You're not just a human being who is
sort of like a existing with these other

1270
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:38,440
human beings. You are a labeled human
being and that label can be great.

1271
01:15:38,740 --> 01:15:42,040
You know, you can be the Dalai
Lama or that label can be shit.

1272
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:44,740
You could be Donald Trump, you
know, and you're, you right now,

1273
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:48,330
Donald Trump has an easy pylon.
Everybody will jump on him.

1274
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,120
He said a bunch of racist things about
Mexicans and much dumb shit during his

1275
01:15:52,121 --> 01:15:53,920
speech announcing he's
going to be president.

1276
01:15:54,070 --> 01:15:58,360
He's an easy pylon and he's also a guy
that sort of embraces self definition.

1277
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,370
He embraces his label so much so that he
puts his label on the top of a building.

1278
01:16:03,490 --> 01:16:04,950
Trump towers.
This is the,

1279
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:10,090
the Trump casino on the Trump this and
like it's a part of the definition I

1280
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:15,070
think any sort of definition like
that. Like officer, professor,

1281
01:16:15,250 --> 01:16:17,890
you know, doctor, you know,
how about people that want,

1282
01:16:17,891 --> 01:16:22,330
like Cosby was making people call him a
doctor when he got an honorary doctorate.

1283
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:25,650
You know, I guess maybe,
you know, secretly it was a,

1284
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:30,680
a big joke for him cause he was drugging
people, you know, allegedly. Yeah.

1285
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:35,260
New News right now it's came out,
he admitted to 2005 and court,

1286
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,640
I'll show you the little article. Oh
well this just, oh, just happened.

1287
01:16:39,910 --> 01:16:41,020
All my goodness.

1288
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:45,130
He it in a 2005 deposition that he
obtained quite ludes a sedative with the

1289
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:48,100
intent of giving them to women he wanted
to have sex with according to records

1290
01:16:48,101 --> 01:16:49,960
obtained by the Associated
Press on Monday,

1291
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:54,250
the admission was contained in records
that were unsealed after the AP went to

1292
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,020
court to compel the release.

1293
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:59,260
Cosby's attorneys had repeatedly
sought to keep the record sealed,

1294
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:02,560
arguing that they would be
embarrassing. This was, um,

1295
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:07,650
a case that Cosby I'm
paid a woman off and then,

1296
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:09,950
uh,
because he had paid off

1297
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:12,290
part of the deal.
Uh,

1298
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:16,510
part of the arrangement was that the
records are to be sealed. So they, uh,

1299
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:19,850
went to court and wow, he's fucked
now. It, we were like three and a half.

1300
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,970
Another thing I was reading this
big, I said, God, what a monster.

1301
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,500
What's the statute of limitations? And all
of their staff can vary. Any questions?

1302
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,120
I think I can be, well, 2005, I can't
imagine the statue of limitations is,

1303
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:40,400
well, if that's 2005, that's
when he admitted it. But
when was the actual instance?

1304
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:44,690
That's monster shit. That's
really, that's dehumanizing shit.

1305
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,440
I think we can go,
that's a long conversation.

1306
01:17:48,441 --> 01:17:53,170
It's sort of semi-related the definition
of bill Cosby because bill Cosby is,

1307
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:57,740
is sort of iconic individual and bill
Cosby has a celebrity and because of that

1308
01:17:57,741 --> 01:18:00,230
he was worshiped and
treated like a celebrity.

1309
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,120
And I think because of that worship,

1310
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:05,770
he sort of had an expectation
of worship and also an egg.

1311
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:10,810
This is total armchair psychology from
a dude who went to college for three

1312
01:18:11,391 --> 01:18:14,560
years and barely paid
attention. But the, I think the,

1313
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:18,950
the expectation of that and the years
and years of that much like being a

1314
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:23,951
spoiled child and leads you to be a person
who expects that from people and can

1315
01:18:25,130 --> 01:18:29,990
even justify horrific behavior because
you actually do think that you're better

1316
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:33,530
than someone the same way. Royalty
does the same way, you know,

1317
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:36,530
people who have not grown up their lines,

1318
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:40,470
that behavior and growth kind of
reason. And a lot of ways, I mean,

1319
01:18:40,490 --> 01:18:41,360
I think there's,

1320
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:46,370
I think it's related in a
way to the idea of labeling,

1321
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:51,250
labeling and you know, just, you
know, that's not a human being.

1322
01:18:51,260 --> 01:18:54,470
That's a police officer,
officer Johnson, you know, uh,

1323
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:59,150
you refer to the judge as
your honor. You know, you, you
can't go, hey man, you know,

1324
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,560
I know you're reading off a book,

1325
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:05,310
but don't lock me in a fucking cage cause
I had a joint order in the court who

1326
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,290
we'll refer to him as your honor.
You know what I mean? Like that,

1327
01:19:08,291 --> 01:19:09,770
that all that stuff,
they'll fucking,

1328
01:19:09,771 --> 01:19:12,970
when they used to wear a crazy wigs
and outfits, what are they doing? Well,

1329
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,230
they're separating themselves.

1330
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:16,940
They're differentiating themselves
and their labeling though they're,

1331
01:19:16,941 --> 01:19:20,330
they're putting themselves in a very
distinctive position, lay. And it's,

1332
01:19:20,331 --> 01:19:21,320
it's really one of the,

1333
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:24,950
it's one of the worst things
that's happening in this
country at the moment. Uh,

1334
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:27,340
that I in, in, in the psychopath test,

1335
01:19:27,341 --> 01:19:31,820
I writes about how these kids as young
as one and two are getting labeled

1336
01:19:31,821 --> 01:19:36,740
bipolar because everyone is so in love
with the checklists that a kid goes to

1337
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:40,790
see a psychiatrist with a temper tantrum
and [inaudible] goes higher and the

1338
01:19:40,791 --> 01:19:41,900
bipolar check list.

1339
01:19:42,100 --> 01:19:45,410
So if it then given antipsychotic
medication at the age of light,

1340
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:49,520
literally one and two, that's how much
labeling culture is out of control.

1341
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:53,930
You don't, I said Dude, and
it's the question I love
asking most is why, you know,

1342
01:19:53,931 --> 01:19:57,410
cause I opens doors,
you know why you have to go some of us.

1343
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:02,630
But with labeling culture, including labor
and culture on social media, it's lie,

1344
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:06,080
it closes doors,
labels closed us questions,

1345
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:10,980
open doors where they certainly
define in like a very concrete way.

1346
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,420
This is what I felt,
you know,

1347
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:17,480
I felt most a step lightly with the
whole Rachel dollar shower thing because

1348
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:23,120
when I heard that story I just thought
that is so mysterious and complicated and

1349
01:20:24,271 --> 01:20:26,400
nuanced and you know,
maybe she's,

1350
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:30,360
maybe she's mentally ill or maybe
she's not. Whatever's going on here.

1351
01:20:30,361 --> 01:20:34,140
This is like really fucking mysterious
and interesting and I like a thousand

1352
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:34,974
questions.

1353
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:39,480
And so I went on Twitter expecting that
that would be Twitter's response to,

1354
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,820
they'd have like a thousand questions,
but no,

1355
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:46,910
people were either like ridiculing her
or attacking her like yelling black face

1356
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,010
or whatever. But there's plenty
of people supporting her,

1357
01:20:50,190 --> 01:20:54,480
her position as being trans racial. Those
are my favorite, right? Those people,

1358
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,190
rod durable.
Right.

1359
01:20:56,490 --> 01:21:00,870
But I just thought fucking hell,
I can't,

1360
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:03,030
you know what I thought,

1361
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:08,310
I thought I'd been a journalist for 30
years and I'm sick and I don't know where

1362
01:21:08,311 --> 01:21:09,300
to go with us,

1363
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:14,450
but I thought I'm really sick of like
damaged people being other people's play

1364
01:21:15,151 --> 01:21:15,810
things,

1365
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:20,400
either ideological placings or play
things for mockery or whatever.

1366
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:23,350
And obviously there's nothing wrong
with comedy and satire and mockery. I,

1367
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:28,060
and that's fine, but nonetheless,
so God [inaudible]. But nonetheless,

1368
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:33,060
I'm just sort of sick
of, of cruelty. Yeah.

1369
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:36,840
Making other human beings are
play things instead of, you know,

1370
01:21:36,841 --> 01:21:41,790
for whatever reasons, instead
of like curiosity. Well, if
it was as simple as play,

1371
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:45,090
uh, play things like, just,
just straight up mockery,

1372
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,200
I would expect that you would get some
clever humor out of it. But it's hate.

1373
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:54,680
There's a lot of anger and hate and this
whole public shaming thing sort of goes

1374
01:21:55,021 --> 01:21:56,280
along with that.
I mean,

1375
01:21:56,281 --> 01:22:00,720
there's some people that I follow that I
don't agree with. And a w unfortunately,

1376
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:05,310
I agree with their position on a
lot of things like a marriage, like,

1377
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:07,650
you know, uh, equality for all.

1378
01:22:07,651 --> 01:22:12,651
Like there's so many different things
that I agree with like extreme left wing

1379
01:22:12,751 --> 01:22:13,411
people on that.

1380
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:18,411
It's really problematic because when
some of them adopt this sort of social

1381
01:22:18,781 --> 01:22:21,570
warrior public shaming stance,

1382
01:22:21,810 --> 01:22:24,990
I'm so torn because on one
side I want to go after them.

1383
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:26,700
[inaudible] another side.

1384
01:22:26,730 --> 01:22:31,730
I agree with almost all of their positions
on equality for women and equality

1385
01:22:32,671 --> 01:22:33,900
for gay people and across,

1386
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:37,590
I mean there's so many of the positions
that I have the exact same stance on,

1387
01:22:37,890 --> 01:22:42,510
but I don't have this stance
on public shaming or if I do,

1388
01:22:42,511 --> 01:22:46,440
my stance is public humor.
You know, my, my stance,

1389
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:50,460
whether Chris Christie says he's gonna
lock up everyone who smokes marijuana,

1390
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:53,490
you know, oh, because marijuana is
so dangerous. I'm like, Jesus Christ.

1391
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,140
Do you have a fucking
mirror in your house?

1392
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:59,700
You're morbidly obese and you're telling
people that they can't have a substance

1393
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:04,530
that has never killed a single person
ever over being overweight is one of the

1394
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:08,680
major causes of premature death
in the United States of America.

1395
01:23:08,930 --> 01:23:13,690
But how having a heart attack is one
of the major causes and having a heart

1396
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:17,800
attack is almost directly related
in most people to being overweight.

1397
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:22,630
I mean it's a huge issue and this fucking
Slob is on television telling people

1398
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:25,820
that he's going to stop marijuana because
it's dangerous and the only stuff and

1399
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:30,830
hot dogs in its fat face like to me a
guy like that has to be mocked because

1400
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:32,890
it's,
it's there and that's my job.

1401
01:23:33,070 --> 01:23:37,750
Just like the fucking crocodile sees the
wounded antelope and it gets too close

1402
01:23:37,751 --> 01:23:40,300
to the waterhole, it can't
help it. It's got a snap ad.

1403
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:43,630
If I'm a comic and you say something
stupid like that and you are just as

1404
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:48,160
blatantly obvious target,
like that is a dangerous person in my,

1405
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,940
in my opinion, because he's a person
who could dictate policy. Well,

1406
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:54,370
he's a person who can make laws and he's
a person that literally can lock people

1407
01:23:54,371 --> 01:23:57,910
up in jail. He can get, he can get
people's freedom taken away. Yeah.

1408
01:23:58,220 --> 01:24:02,420
He had punching up and nipping funny
and there's nothing, you know, I,

1409
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:06,400
I'd be a real dope if I was going to
stop being against things like that.

1410
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:07,511
I guess,
you know,

1411
01:24:07,511 --> 01:24:11,290
what my books against
is the disproportionate
punishment of people who don't

1412
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:15,760
deserve it. And that's the bullying. Yeah.
It's piling on. I mean, it, it, it's,

1413
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:18,580
it's also having a lack of,

1414
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:23,410
there's a lack of perspective that comes
with a lot of these pile on bullying.

1415
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:27,670
Things like the, um, the what, what's the
woman's name again? Soco. Justin. Yeah.

1416
01:24:28,090 --> 01:24:30,700
Rachel Dolezal thing. First of all, um,

1417
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:35,380
she handled herself very well on Matt
Lauer. Yeah. I should say, by the way,

1418
01:24:35,381 --> 01:24:38,740
that may sort of saying all do that
stuff on Twitter was raw at the beginning

1419
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,420
before she'd said anything.
I was like to say, look,

1420
01:24:40,421 --> 01:24:43,330
we don't know anything about this
woman. You know, we don't know anything.

1421
01:24:43,331 --> 01:24:45,880
Like everyone's jumping to conclusions,
nobody knows anything.

1422
01:24:46,180 --> 01:24:48,790
And I was just like,
screamed at for that.

1423
01:24:48,791 --> 01:24:52,450
And she had some other issues though
that were exposed as time went on.

1424
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:55,220
And one of them is, she's a
plagiarist. Oh yeah, yeah.

1425
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:58,450
She plagiarized some art and she was
selling some art that she clearly

1426
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:01,690
plagiarized and she's just deceptive.

1427
01:25:01,691 --> 01:25:05,290
She lied about her background.
She said she was born in a teepee.

1428
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:07,750
Like she's just not a truthful person.

1429
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:12,320
And sometimes when people don't
enjoy their life, um, you know, I've,

1430
01:25:12,321 --> 01:25:16,010
I've met a lot of kids when
I was young that, you know,

1431
01:25:16,030 --> 01:25:18,940
came from really fucked up backgrounds
and those are the ones that told like the

1432
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:19,840
really big lies.

1433
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,960
And I think that a lot of those lives
were because they didn't like their

1434
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:26,850
reality, you know, and that's, they
didn't, they didn't ask to be born that,

1435
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:29,360
you know, there's a mystery, right.
With people like that you liked.

1436
01:25:29,361 --> 01:25:32,350
So what happened? Why do you
feel that way? What's going on?

1437
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,770
Whereas effectual delish I like the
minute this breaks some social media.

1438
01:25:35,771 --> 01:25:39,550
If it wouldn't just like, you know,
fucking racist, shut the fuck up.

1439
01:25:39,610 --> 01:25:40,960
There's no questions.
It's black.

1440
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:45,961
You would get really angry because she's
appropriating a disenfranchise segment

1441
01:25:46,361 --> 01:25:51,100
of society has already been stolen from,
from white by white people. You know,

1442
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:55,760
and I had people tweeting me to
say, you know, you were white man.

1443
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:58,490
This isn't your story. Get
ancillaries, isn't it? You don't have,

1444
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,750
you're not allowed to have an opinion
because you weren't born with the right

1445
01:26:01,751 --> 01:26:03,980
amount of melanin in your skin.
So mind

1446
01:26:04,010 --> 01:26:07,460
is not working right.
Would they said this is your story.

1447
01:26:07,461 --> 01:26:11,090
You can't come until this. This is cause
this isn't your story. That's bullshit.

1448
01:26:11,310 --> 01:26:13,840
When I felt it kind of
was my story because I've,

1449
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:17,600
for 30 years I've been
writing about trouble people
and I've come to conclusions

1450
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:21,380
about the way you should regard of the
people at the human beings with sort of

1451
01:26:21,570 --> 01:26:26,120
interest in curiosity and
compassion, not cold, hard judgment.

1452
01:26:26,121 --> 01:26:28,190
So that's where I came
from and that story.

1453
01:26:28,250 --> 01:26:32,630
It's also that the saying that it's not,
you're not allowed,

1454
01:26:32,670 --> 01:26:36,220
I have an opinion or it's not your story.
That is you.

1455
01:26:36,221 --> 01:26:40,390
What you're trying to do is you're trying
to silence anybody that doesn't agree

1456
01:26:40,391 --> 01:26:40,840
with you.

1457
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:45,840
Everyone that is a human being that
witnesses a story you witnessed,

1458
01:26:45,851 --> 01:26:48,220
some public thing was taking place.

1459
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:53,400
You are absolutely allowed your opinion
and if you're not going to allow people

1460
01:26:54,191 --> 01:26:57,100
to speak up about things and
have opinions about things,

1461
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:59,800
whether these opinions are
informed or uninformed,

1462
01:26:59,890 --> 01:27:01,660
that's all going to be
sorted out in the wash.

1463
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:06,430
But it to say it's not your position
to talk well then your public

1464
01:27:06,450 --> 01:27:09,320
like silence people and you
know exactly what that is.

1465
01:27:09,321 --> 01:27:13,040
The opposite of of course is is democracy.
And when I was reading people,

1466
01:27:13,041 --> 01:27:16,850
I went off social media after all of that
cause there was so much screaming and

1467
01:27:16,851 --> 01:27:19,340
I was reading people basically saying,
okay,

1468
01:27:19,341 --> 01:27:24,341
let's go to John Ronson into saying
something outrageous and then we can get

1469
01:27:24,501 --> 01:27:29,210
him. Is that what they said?
Yeah. I always feel like,
you know why they'd say that?

1470
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,410
It's because, uh, the,

1471
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:35,030
the young have decided for some
misdefined reason to create an incredibly

1472
01:27:35,031 --> 01:27:39,130
stressful world for themselves.
I don't think they realize what they are,

1473
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:39,200
it's what they're

1474
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:44,110
doing. Um, but the, the Rachel
dolls all thing was, uh,

1475
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:49,310
to me it was a perfect example of
how ludicrous human beings are,

1476
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:53,900
how ridiculous our society is
and how this woman is. Like,

1477
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:54,913
first of all,

1478
01:27:55,490 --> 01:27:59,330
the NAACP was founded by white people
as something a lot of people don't know.

1479
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:04,480
And Black folks weren't even allowed to
hold office until the 1970 [inaudible]

1480
01:28:04,971 --> 01:28:07,520
while at the cotton club.
And a lot of ways, well,

1481
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:11,960
it was actually founded by New
York City intellectuals, I believe.

1482
01:28:11,961 --> 01:28:15,860
I hope I'm not doing this wrong,
that, um, they, they really, uh,

1483
01:28:15,861 --> 01:28:19,550
it was in response to all the lynchings
and, you know, they were like,

1484
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:23,510
they were just, they were
compassionate, intelligent, uh,

1485
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:28,660
progressive people that we're trying
to figure out a way past this horrible

1486
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:30,860
situation that the world,

1487
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:35,210
it found himself in post slavery where
there was all this resentment and there

1488
01:28:35,211 --> 01:28:38,960
was, there was lynched lynchings and
just the chaos that is the south.

1489
01:28:38,961 --> 01:28:39,610
And you know,

1490
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:42,950
I think we're still dealing with the
reverberation of the repercussions and the

1491
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:47,510
reverberations of it right now with this
confederate flag debate that's going on

1492
01:28:47,511 --> 01:28:48,440
all throughout America now.

1493
01:28:48,441 --> 01:28:52,550
It's like America's just sort of kind
of waking up to the fact that we'll fuck

1494
01:28:52,551 --> 01:28:56,840
man, a hundred or so years ago
you were allowed to own people,

1495
01:28:57,200 --> 01:29:02,100
you know, and the people that wanted
to be able to own people had a flag

1496
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,030
and these people put that flag on a car
and drove it around on TV and we didn't

1497
01:29:06,031 --> 01:29:07,560
think about it. Yeah. You know,

1498
01:29:07,561 --> 01:29:10,890
and now we're thinking about it and
you know the rec code, by the way,

1499
01:29:10,891 --> 01:29:12,520
I was always disappointed when the chooks,

1500
01:29:12,521 --> 01:29:15,180
if house it was on TV that
because of the flag. No,

1501
01:29:15,181 --> 01:29:19,840
just cause it wasn't as good as wonder
woman. But this is a cut attention.

1502
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,800
What about Daisy Duke? Well wonder
what, it was pretty fucking hot too.

1503
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,220
I spent a lot of time with
the Ku Klux Klan. You know,
from, from my book there, my,

1504
01:29:28,221 --> 01:29:29,160
I discovered this,

1505
01:29:29,161 --> 01:29:34,090
I'm politically correct faction
of the Ku Klux Arkansas.

1506
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:35,543
Yes.

1507
01:29:35,610 --> 01:29:40,610
Run by a guy called Tom Rob who decided
that the Klan had a really bad image.

1508
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:44,220
Ah, he was going to do
something about it recently.

1509
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,080
Notice it's like the mid nineties.

1510
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:48,980
I wrote about it in my book then
why is he back in the news? No,

1511
01:29:48,990 --> 01:29:50,460
there's another group,

1512
01:29:50,930 --> 01:29:54,030
another factor of the Ku Klux Klan
that was allowing black people and they

1513
01:29:54,031 --> 01:29:56,700
wanted to allow black people in.
Oh really?

1514
01:29:56,701 --> 01:29:59,190
Where that is the kind of thing
that Tom would have done. In fact,

1515
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:04,110
Tom was accused by other white
supremacists of kissing a black baby. Um,

1516
01:30:04,210 --> 01:30:07,800
I, and you have to kind of deny it. You
got to hit to issue a denial black baby.

1517
01:30:07,980 --> 01:30:12,690
But I went to, I went to Tom's
house and he directed, so we'd band,

1518
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:17,790
I went to this big annual convention and
he banned like the robes and the hoods.

1519
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:20,290
They were allowed to wear robes one day.
Uh,

1520
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:24,810
and they were loud and they were
allowed to burn a cross one day.

1521
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:26,443
Yeah.

1522
01:30:26,490 --> 01:30:30,630
And it was the day that I turned up and
they were all stunned to grab this giant

1523
01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:32,730
cross.
It's lying on the ground.

1524
01:30:33,150 --> 01:30:35,520
And they couldn't remember
because they were also rusty.

1525
01:30:36,980 --> 01:30:41,940
They couldn't remember whether to soak
it and then raise it or raise it and then

1526
01:30:41,941 --> 01:30:44,550
soak it. Oh, that's hilarious.
Those starting ground.

1527
01:30:44,730 --> 01:30:47,760
And then Tom comes over
and they go, Tom, we cut.

1528
01:30:47,761 --> 01:30:51,210
Do we soak it and then raise it or
raise it and then soak it. And Tom Goes,

1529
01:30:51,660 --> 01:30:54,750
you soca and then raise it. How the, how
the hell are you going to lie? So kind.

1530
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:59,370
I don't say, Hey Carrie. I know.
Then Tom looks at me as if to say,

1531
01:30:59,730 --> 01:31:04,140
I'm so sorry that my members
are such idiots. Like Tom
preferred me to the clown.

1532
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:07,360
Oh my God, that's a door. And then he,

1533
01:31:07,380 --> 01:31:10,620
and then they had this kid in his garden.
Um,

1534
01:31:10,710 --> 01:31:13,830
and they're all doing this kind of
personality skills, workshops. Like,

1535
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,650
like they were filling
out these multiple choice,

1536
01:31:16,651 --> 01:31:20,880
like which strengths and
weaknesses most apply to you. Um,

1537
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:24,300
I always remember like
one of the strengths, the
weaknesses was mixes easily,

1538
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,590
which normally would be like a strength.
But if you're the clan it's been,

1539
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,400
it's gotta be weakness.
And then another one was warrior.

1540
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:35,010
And what are the classmen was like going,
well,

1541
01:31:35,011 --> 01:31:37,560
I don't consider being a
warrior to be a weakness.

1542
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,930
And then like the person
doing the test was like,

1543
01:31:39,931 --> 01:31:42,570
why is she being a
worrier can be a weakness.

1544
01:31:42,571 --> 01:31:46,680
And he thought it was warrior and
it was worrying. Oh God. Yeah.

1545
01:31:48,390 --> 01:31:53,380
Worrier. Are you a
worrier? Englishes English.

1546
01:31:53,650 --> 01:31:57,090
Yeah. I was an Englishman. I'm
a worrier. Oh, I see. Yeah.

1547
01:31:57,150 --> 01:31:58,710
Well I could see someone
saying I'm a worrier,

1548
01:31:58,711 --> 01:32:01,940
but I couldn't see it as a question.
Are you a worrier? I would see,

1549
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,840
think the question would be a little bit
more straight forward like do you worry

1550
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:05,580
a lot?
I've got,

1551
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:08,920
I've got to say to kind of genetic most
poor choice question and answer thing.

1552
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:13,630
Worry. I would be like an odd word to
have had that. Are you a warrior? Yes sir.

1553
01:32:13,631 --> 01:32:16,960
I am. I'm a warrior for
the race, but I'm not.

1554
01:32:16,970 --> 01:32:21,070
I'm a warrior
now.

1555
01:32:21,071 --> 01:32:24,550
What is the reason why they
burn the cross? It's a cross.

1556
01:32:24,551 --> 01:32:27,010
They couldn't across the lighting,
not a cross burning.

1557
01:32:27,830 --> 01:32:29,950
It goes back to glass
half full sort of a thing.

1558
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:34,600
I think it goes back to the Scottish,
I believe it's all to do with like,

1559
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,410
I can't remember if they told me, you
know what it's like being a journalist.

1560
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:40,040
Like you know everything.
For sure it's hard,

1561
01:32:40,070 --> 01:32:42,610
but then you move onto the next story.
You write your, sorry, forget it. Oh,

1562
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,450
I've got a terrible memory. Anyway, I've
lost it. It's like being a podcast or two.

1563
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:47,920
We've talked about things.

1564
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:53,140
We've done 667 episodes now so
we can not to six, six, seven,

1565
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:55,570
six,
six Duncan Trussell

1566
01:32:57,700 --> 01:33:02,260
fake evil fakey well he's a great guy,
but he could play evil.

1567
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:07,930
One time I was, uh, I went on a road
trip with the Klan from Harrison,

1568
01:33:07,931 --> 01:33:12,760
Arkansas to St Paul.

1569
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:17,700
Long journey, like 17 hours. I was in a
car for 17 hours with the Klan. Whoa. I,

1570
01:33:17,770 --> 01:33:22,090
at one point Tom turned to me the leader
and he said, can I ask you a question?

1571
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,130
And I said, well, and he said,
do you think I'm weird? Wow.

1572
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,750
Yeah.
And I was like,

1573
01:33:28,751 --> 01:33:33,290
I think you're in a transitional
phase between where to not wear it.

1574
01:33:34,030 --> 01:33:38,380
Oh, that's interesting. So you were
playing like psychological, uh,

1575
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:40,300
when I was in the car with game lamb,

1576
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,380
but saying there isn't a transitionary
period. Like what did you mean by that?

1577
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:45,700
Well, cause he was trying to, you know,

1578
01:33:45,701 --> 01:33:49,000
trying to do an image maker virtue
and be more politically correct.

1579
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,460
It didn't really turn out in,

1580
01:33:50,461 --> 01:33:53,740
did he feel that black
people were inferior to white
people to be really clearly

1581
01:33:53,741 --> 01:33:54,521
feel that?
Well,

1582
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:59,320
he would probably call himself
like a white sat protest,

1583
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:00,860
but he wasn't actually,
I'm an,

1584
01:34:00,861 --> 01:34:03,460
I've met white separatists
like Randy Weaver and Fr.

1585
01:34:03,970 --> 01:34:07,810
The third nicer people than
Tom was a Randy Weaver who's
a Ruby Ridge guy. Right.

1586
01:34:07,820 --> 01:34:09,700
He's wiped separatist.
I'm really gone.

1587
01:34:09,701 --> 01:34:11,860
I got on well with the weaver
has gotten really why Rachel,

1588
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:16,690
his daughter in that story
is kind of a fucked up story.

1589
01:34:16,691 --> 01:34:18,380
Right?
Like he was a,

1590
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:22,090
they had a house alone in the woods and
they were killed by snipers. Right. Yeah.

1591
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:24,850
This is a really bad story.
So they were,

1592
01:34:24,851 --> 01:34:29,270
this is the first story I ever did where
I feel like I kind of twisted it rounds

1593
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:31,780
that the people who would normally
be the villains were the good guys,

1594
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,370
the people that normally be the good guys.

1595
01:34:33,371 --> 01:34:35,110
Were the villains
satisfied good about that.

1596
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:37,930
So basically they were family of light,
you know,

1597
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:41,210
they believe in Bohemian Grove
and Bilderberg and I went,

1598
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:43,420
I am tried to infiltrate,
build a book one time by the way,

1599
01:34:43,421 --> 01:34:46,120
and got chased away by their hedgemon.

1600
01:34:46,150 --> 01:34:50,410
I don't if this time to tell that
story as a planet. Okay. So, uh,

1601
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:55,710
so they moved to this cabin up in the
words on top of the mountain and Idaho,

1602
01:34:55,990 --> 01:35:00,940
Ruby Creek, Idaho and Randy, uh,

1603
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:04,430
would hang out at the local
area nations with the family.

1604
01:35:04,850 --> 01:35:07,430
That was his big undoing was that he,

1605
01:35:07,470 --> 01:35:10,070
we would take the family up to area
nations who were just, you know,

1606
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:13,180
a fucking nuts,
like violent skin,

1607
01:35:13,181 --> 01:35:17,750
had nuts and Randy would take his family
up there for like picnics and away days

1608
01:35:17,930 --> 01:35:22,910
and so on. So Arian nations, like
pretty much every white supremacist,

1609
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:26,330
you know, group in America
was heavily infiltrated by,

1610
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:28,640
by undercover officers.

1611
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,620
And they saw a Randy and saw his family
and could tell that Randy was less crazy

1612
01:35:33,950 --> 01:35:37,910
than the other people there.
So they approached Randy and said,

1613
01:35:37,911 --> 01:35:41,780
you want to become an undercover
informant? And Randy said, no.

1614
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,210
So then Mandy thought that was that.

1615
01:35:44,390 --> 01:35:49,120
But then they sent a guy to ask
Randy to saw off a shotgun. So He's,

1616
01:35:49,121 --> 01:35:50,150
so he said,
okay fine.

1617
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:54,290
So we sawed off shotgun
slightly below the legal limit,

1618
01:35:54,470 --> 01:35:56,690
like the guy pointed at him.
It's a no, so it off there.

1619
01:35:56,870 --> 01:36:00,770
So we sorted off there and then
they said, ah, we've got you. Um,

1620
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:04,160
this was an undercover cop.
You've now committed to firearms offense.

1621
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:08,900
You will go to jail in less.
You become an undercover informant for us.

1622
01:36:09,290 --> 01:36:14,150
And Randy being a,
being a Twat said no fuck off.

1623
01:36:14,380 --> 01:36:17,300
And he kind of embarrassed the
feds in front of his wife. He said,

1624
01:36:17,301 --> 01:36:20,570
look at those two guys over there.
Guess what they just asked me to do?

1625
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:22,820
And so Randy was like an idiot.
And then he,

1626
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:27,200
he locks himself up in the cabin
with his wife and kids and dog.

1627
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:31,820
Um, and then, and so they
surrounded the cabin,

1628
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:35,840
the ATF. And this went
on for like a year, uh,

1629
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:39,650
that they set up cameras in the trees
and surrounded Roundy's cabinet.

1630
01:36:39,651 --> 01:36:42,020
And one day the, um, the,

1631
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:47,380
the ATF people got too close to the cabin
and disturb the dog and the dog starts

1632
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:51,260
barking and the dog chases
the agents down the hill.

1633
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:55,430
And Randy's little boy who was,
who was like 12 years old or something.

1634
01:36:55,431 --> 01:36:59,890
Sammy chased the dog down the
hill with a gun because Randy,

1635
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:03,650
like an idiot had armed his kids.
And uh,

1636
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:08,270
so they all run down to the bottom of
the hill and agents jumps out and shoots

1637
01:37:08,271 --> 01:37:11,710
the dog, kills the dog. Sammy
says, you killed my dog,

1638
01:37:11,711 --> 01:37:14,690
you son of a bitch and
start shooting wildly.

1639
01:37:15,020 --> 01:37:19,290
And the agent shoots Sammy in his arm
and basically shoot his arm nearly off.

1640
01:37:19,290 --> 01:37:23,420
And somebody yells, Dad, I'm coming home
dad. And starts running up the hill.

1641
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:27,620
And the ATF agent just shoots summary in
the back cause he's running up the hill

1642
01:37:27,621 --> 01:37:31,650
just instead, sort of volley of
gunfire. So, so some is now dead.

1643
01:37:31,700 --> 01:37:35,900
This story doesn't get any better,
I should tell you, Sam is now dead.

1644
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:40,670
Rundy get some,
these body puts them in the shed.

1645
01:37:40,910 --> 01:37:43,260
And then the next day, oh, um,

1646
01:37:43,310 --> 01:37:48,310
one of Randy's friends is there and
there's a shootout and one of the agents I

1647
01:37:48,950 --> 01:37:51,920
called bill and gets killed tools
and I've got to dead people.

1648
01:37:51,921 --> 01:37:55,370
You've got a dead agent and
you've got Sammy Dad. Um,

1649
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:59,370
the jewelry's always been asked as to
whether the agent was killed by Randy's

1650
01:37:59,371 --> 01:38:04,170
friend or by friendly fire.
Um, so anyway, the next day,

1651
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:10,040
Randy goes outside and an FBI
sniper called Alon Harriet.

1652
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:12,390
She shoots Randy in the shoulder.

1653
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:17,040
So Randy runs back in and Vicki Randy's
wife was standing in the doorway holding

1654
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:22,041
a baby and a sniper shoots Vicki
through the head and kills a,

1655
01:38:23,220 --> 01:38:27,540
and they'd pull Vicky's
body into the cabin. And,

1656
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,110
and a siege starts like a
16 day siege or something.

1657
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:34,220
And art that I had the road
blocked down at the bottom.

1658
01:38:34,221 --> 01:38:37,350
That's kind of where the
militia movement started,

1659
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:42,351
like all these local militia people or
form at the bottom of the roadblock and

1660
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:46,320
for days, and then discover that
Vicky's dad. And, and I mean,

1661
01:38:46,321 --> 01:38:49,460
I've seen some amateur footage
and it's tiered, so sad. And,

1662
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:53,680
and I became really good
friends with Rachel, who's
Randy's younger daughter, uh,

1663
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:56,760
who was in the cabin full of
that time. And I did. In the end,

1664
01:38:56,790 --> 01:39:00,990
the government admitted responsibility
and paid each around these daughters a

1665
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:05,040
million dollars each and
they killed Randy. Uh, no,
Randy still alive. Rezzy now?

1666
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:05,641
Yeah.

1667
01:39:05,641 --> 01:39:08,860
Randy now goes to gun shows where you can
have your photograph taken with Randy.

1668
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:13,230
We for $4. God. Yeah. And how much? $5.

1669
01:39:13,231 --> 01:39:17,490
He sells himself. Quite short
bargain. Yeah. A historical figure.

1670
01:39:17,670 --> 01:39:21,330
So that's, so one of the people
who visited Randy's cabin.

1671
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:25,470
I've visited Randy's cabin with Rachel
and another person who visited Randy's

1672
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,560
cabin was Timothy Mcveigh.
Um,

1673
01:39:28,110 --> 01:39:31,590
shortly before blowing up the
Murrah building in Oklahoma City.

1674
01:39:31,650 --> 01:39:35,760
Have you ever seen the conspiracy
theories on that? About yeah,

1675
01:39:35,790 --> 01:39:39,930
I visited della him city. The
place which you know about, right.

1676
01:39:39,931 --> 01:39:42,360
The place where you know, I, you know,

1677
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:47,430
I know I've got a kind of reputation for
being a, a debunker of conspiracies and,

1678
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:51,030
and the reputation has cut
a warranted in most cases,

1679
01:39:51,031 --> 01:39:53,850
but I've got to say of all the things I,

1680
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:57,180
I investigated when I was doing a
lot of stuff about conspiracies.

1681
01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:01,660
The one where I thought this
is a bit fucking fishy was,

1682
01:40:01,940 --> 01:40:03,810
was Oklahoma City.
Yeah.

1683
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,370
Oh, it's, it's most certainly fishery.

1684
01:40:05,450 --> 01:40:09,150
What's most certainly fishy
is the efficacy of that bomb.

1685
01:40:09,720 --> 01:40:11,280
The bomb that they used,

1686
01:40:11,281 --> 01:40:15,270
a fertilizer bomb that blew half there
building apart when you talked to bomb

1687
01:40:15,271 --> 01:40:18,420
experts, they go that is
like really, really unlikely.

1688
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:23,760
And they said that the amount of damage
that a bomb like that that's made out of

1689
01:40:23,761 --> 01:40:27,330
fertilizer can do is nothing in
comparison to what that building was like.

1690
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:30,020
And also that that building,
um,

1691
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:33,360
looked like it had been blown out.

1692
01:40:33,720 --> 01:40:36,630
Not it had been blown in but blown out,

1693
01:40:36,840 --> 01:40:39,600
meaning that there was bombs
planted inside the building.

1694
01:40:39,601 --> 01:40:43,800
And then there was all these news reports
as another one of Alex Jones is a,

1695
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:45,300
uh,
stories.

1696
01:40:45,450 --> 01:40:49,230
There was all these news reports that
he played these clips of where they were

1697
01:40:49,231 --> 01:40:54,130
talking about FBI agents for moving bombs,
unexploded bombs from the building,

1698
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:58,570
and that there were more than one
bomb. And then they had this, you know,

1699
01:40:58,630 --> 01:41:02,110
this narrative that they blamed it on
Timothy Mcveigh and what was the other

1700
01:41:02,111 --> 01:41:05,370
guy's name? Terry Nichols.
Terry Nichols. Yeah. And um,

1701
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:08,500
that it was this fertilizer
bomb. And remember there's
like, oh, there's all this,

1702
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,010
they were looking for a guy from
Iraq and there was all this,

1703
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:14,530
like the different stuff that
was going on in the news,

1704
01:41:14,531 --> 01:41:15,520
like right after it was over.

1705
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:18,760
But then they had settled on the story
that he had done it and they had done it

1706
01:41:18,761 --> 01:41:23,740
all with this fertilizer bomb. But, um,
it's, it's, it's a weird one because,

1707
01:41:23,741 --> 01:41:24,100
I mean,

1708
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:28,240
I don't have an answer and I don't even
have a theory like who could have done

1709
01:41:28,241 --> 01:41:31,990
it or how it was done or what
would have been done. I mean, look,

1710
01:41:32,200 --> 01:41:35,350
all we know is someone blew up
that fucking building. I mean,

1711
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:38,290
if it was just him and Terry Nichols,

1712
01:41:38,291 --> 01:41:40,550
it was just Timothy Mcveigh
and Terry Nichols. Um,

1713
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:44,230
that to me is no more crazy than it was
a bunch of other people that planted

1714
01:41:44,231 --> 01:41:47,920
bombs inside the building. It's all
a heinous act of horror and murder.

1715
01:41:48,510 --> 01:41:49,410
Yeah.
The way it,

1716
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,180
the way it thing that we discovered
tonight when I was doing the Oklahoma's

1717
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:56,850
story was it's best called Ella him city.

1718
01:41:56,851 --> 01:42:01,440
If you have you heard of this
place? So I visited Alahan city, uh,

1719
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:02,520
the old Dale.

1720
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:07,380
This is like this kind of white separatist
stroke supremacist compound and the

1721
01:42:07,381 --> 01:42:12,381
Arkansas or Oklahoma board as
an in the Ozarks spooky spot.

1722
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:17,370
Yeah. I turned up in the audit, the
river dance for me. Oh, Jesus. Yeah.

1723
01:42:17,610 --> 01:42:22,610
I'd just been chased through Portugal by
the Bilderberg group and I bonded with

1724
01:42:22,861 --> 01:42:26,710
them over that. Like I tell
him, I told him, I don't know,

1725
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:30,540
I just been chased by bill.
Yeah. Everyone, all of these,

1726
01:42:30,541 --> 01:42:34,980
all of that crowd back there knows you've
got Bilderberg. Um, and I said, yeah,

1727
01:42:34,981 --> 01:42:38,880
I've just been chased by the
Bilderberg group, which I was, I, um,

1728
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:42,090
it in my book then when I was trying
to infiltrate secret societies,

1729
01:42:42,091 --> 01:42:46,310
I went to Portugal with Jim
Tucker. Um, the, he ran,

1730
01:42:46,350 --> 01:42:48,510
he worked for this magazine
called the spotlight,

1731
01:42:48,511 --> 01:42:52,140
which was run by this kind
of white separatist group
called the liberty lobby in

1732
01:42:52,141 --> 01:42:53,100
Washington DC.

1733
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:56,700
Basically everybody kept telling me about
this group called the Bilderberg group

1734
01:42:56,701 --> 01:42:58,100
that no one had heard of back then.

1735
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:03,120
Only only real niche aficionados
that her to build a poke back then.

1736
01:43:03,660 --> 01:43:07,470
Um, and, uh, much in the
same way that I kind of law.

1737
01:43:07,530 --> 01:43:09,930
I feel like I partly launched Alex Jones,
his career.

1738
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:13,320
I also feel like partly gave the world
build a bird because I was the first lap

1739
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:17,220
mainstream writer to write about it
because everyone was saying that there's

1740
01:43:17,221 --> 01:43:20,100
this group called the Bilderberg group
and they secretly rule the world from

1741
01:43:20,101 --> 01:43:23,670
inside a secret room. Uh, and I
said, if you ask big Jim Tucker,

1742
01:43:23,700 --> 01:43:27,900
he'll tell you more. So, so
I phoned up Jim Tucker, uh,

1743
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:29,790
and he said, yeah, it's true.

1744
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,910
They always meet once a year to five
star hotel with golfing facilities.

1745
01:43:33,200 --> 01:43:36,240
And that's where they all the world. And
he said, you've caught me at a good time.

1746
01:43:36,470 --> 01:43:39,010
I want to say look like
something out of like sub spade.

1747
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:42,150
I had an office of 50 should
blind to the word trill bay,

1748
01:43:42,151 --> 01:43:45,990
and he smoked like 80 a day. Uh,
he said that he had emphysema,

1749
01:43:45,991 --> 01:43:49,890
which made him sound even more like
seminar. He died a couple of years ago,

1750
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:52,910
but he lusted a fuck of lot longer
than I had to put money on him. And I,

1751
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:55,430
I met him in March and I
thought he'd be dead by May,

1752
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:59,450
but actually lasted about another 10
years. Wow. Yeah. He only dad recently,

1753
01:43:59,451 --> 01:44:03,920
like a couple of years ago and this was
[inaudible] 96 so Tim said, uh, he said,

1754
01:44:03,921 --> 01:44:05,450
yeah,
I've discovered where they've got to meet.

1755
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:09,320
Like my secret sauce has told me that
there'd be to get the seaside Park Hotel

1756
01:44:09,560 --> 01:44:13,400
at golfing resorted Sidra Portugal
and I'm going to fly over there.

1757
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:16,080
I apologize in my, send
me American accent. Uh,

1758
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:19,850
I'm doing here is I got to fly over there
and climbed up the drain pipes and get

1759
01:44:19,851 --> 01:44:24,260
in and confronting red handed. Gogebic
they're covert wickedness. So I said,

1760
01:44:24,261 --> 01:44:27,840
can I come? And he said, okay, as long
as you to use a term covert wicked.

1761
01:44:27,841 --> 01:44:32,080
I might be slightly exaggerate,
he might put an English,

1762
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:36,380
but basically I, I'm pretty sure he
said he was going to cloud the Trophon,

1763
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:41,130
wickedness, white supremacy.
That's all they talk. Yeah.

1764
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:42,960
So we flew the best,
so be a,

1765
01:44:42,961 --> 01:44:46,880
Jim Tucker flew to Portugal
and scouted around the,

1766
01:44:46,990 --> 01:44:51,020
the Park Hotel. And we decided
that our cover story would be like,

1767
01:44:51,140 --> 01:44:53,630
he'd be like a sales,
we'd be salesman,

1768
01:44:54,230 --> 01:44:57,830
but we didn't look at anything
that fucking sales when I
was like early thirties,

1769
01:44:58,040 --> 01:45:02,990
you know, skinny little Jewish guy. And
he was like this big southern gentleman.

1770
01:45:02,990 --> 01:45:06,580
So we looked like really fucking
good shuffle. Yeah. Like gay couple.

1771
01:45:06,581 --> 01:45:10,610
I could it be like as toy boy, uh,
I like, we realize scouting a lot,

1772
01:45:10,630 --> 01:45:12,410
try to talk to waitresses and stuff.

1773
01:45:12,411 --> 01:45:15,980
This was the day before the Bilderberg
group was reportedly go to arrive at this

1774
01:45:15,981 --> 01:45:20,360
hotel.
And then we left and we started getting,

1775
01:45:20,361 --> 01:45:25,250
I looked in my rear view mirror
and it was a car following me and,

1776
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:30,140
and a, and a chase ensued, um,
like through the streets. I mean,

1777
01:45:30,141 --> 01:45:34,580
I say a chase, I was going 30 miles an
hour, so, so we say, but I keep thinking,

1778
01:45:34,581 --> 01:45:37,760
I kept thinking, fuck, if I
speed up, he's going to speed up.

1779
01:45:37,761 --> 01:45:40,610
It's gonna be like a fucking chase.
So it was very obvious. It was fine.

1780
01:45:40,611 --> 01:45:42,920
He wasn't trying to be sneaky. No. Well,

1781
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:47,330
I stopped the car and he
stopped his car like behind me.

1782
01:45:47,930 --> 01:45:51,140
So I, I thought I've got
to say something to him.

1783
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:55,430
So I went over to the car and I like
knocked on the window and there's a guy in

1784
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:59,540
dark glasses in the car looking straight
ahead and I'm knocking on the window

1785
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:01,520
and he refuses to look at me.

1786
01:46:02,180 --> 01:46:06,620
Like obviously his orders were
to follow but don't engage.

1787
01:46:06,980 --> 01:46:11,810
Like I'm suddenly in a
world where I am lie big,

1788
01:46:11,811 --> 01:46:15,770
followed by somebody whose orders
are to follow and not engage.

1789
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,630
So I freak the fuck out.

1790
01:46:17,900 --> 01:46:22,900
So I get back in the car and I phone
up first I filled up my wife and I say,

1791
01:46:23,900 --> 01:46:27,710
I'm being followed by the Bilderberg
group. I am fucking terrified.

1792
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:30,950
And my wife goes, oh, you're loving it.

1793
01:46:32,750 --> 01:46:37,640
And I'm like, oh no. And
then I found it, oh gosh.

1794
01:46:37,650 --> 01:46:41,540
Embassy and I brought at the
British embassy and I said,

1795
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:45,860
I'm being followed by
the Bilderberg group. Um,

1796
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:49,570
and then the one for the British
embassy goes and then she cold.

1797
01:46:51,110 --> 01:46:56,100
And I'm like, I just want you
to take a shot. I then she says,

1798
01:46:56,180 --> 01:47:00,510
what do you do? They know, you know, did
they know your hair? I mean, what are you,

1799
01:47:00,511 --> 01:47:02,850
what are you doing here?
And I said,

1800
01:47:03,060 --> 01:47:06,780
I am essentially a humorous
journalist out of my depth.

1801
01:47:07,350 --> 01:47:10,530
Can you foam what I also said to her,
to my shame,

1802
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:14,620
I didn't put this in my book or I write
about all of this in my book. Then, um,

1803
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:17,640
what I didn't say, what I didn't put it
in my book was that I also said to her,

1804
01:47:17,910 --> 01:47:22,170
I said, I'm a humorous to enlist, started
my depth. I'm a bit like Louis Theroux.

1805
01:47:22,620 --> 01:47:26,780
And she's like, oh, like she's heard of
him and not me. And I'm like, I don't.

1806
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:28,200
I'm like,
yeah,

1807
01:47:28,201 --> 01:47:32,640
but actually Louis often
cites me as an inspiration.

1808
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:37,950
I swear to God,
this is like my last day on earth.

1809
01:47:37,951 --> 01:47:42,951
I'm about to be killed by the Bilderberg
group telling the press officer for the

1810
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:47,490
British Embassy in Portugal that
Louis actually speaks highly of me.

1811
01:47:51,380 --> 01:47:56,370
So then I, then she says,
she says this, she said,

1812
01:47:56,371 --> 01:47:59,280
this is the, this is like the most
startling thing that happened that day.

1813
01:47:59,790 --> 01:48:04,110
She said, well, the good news is
if you know you're being followed,

1814
01:48:04,440 --> 01:48:07,290
they're probably just trying to
intimidate you, intimidate you,

1815
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:10,530
and the dangerous ones would be
those you don't know a following you.

1816
01:48:11,070 --> 01:48:12,570
And I'm thinking first,

1817
01:48:12,780 --> 01:48:17,040
how the fuck does the press officer at
the British embassy, no, this and hey,

1818
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:19,500
what if these people
are the dangerous ones?

1819
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:22,680
And I just happened to be like
naturally good at spotting them.

1820
01:48:22,681 --> 01:48:27,300
Like I'm an anxious person. I, I will
spot, like I suffer from anxiety.

1821
01:48:27,301 --> 01:48:31,710
Like I will spot if somebody is
following me. Right? Yeah. So anyway,

1822
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:36,270
so then she did not go
back to my hotel and uh,

1823
01:48:36,810 --> 01:48:39,780
the woman for the British embassy phones
be back and says that she's spoken to

1824
01:48:39,781 --> 01:48:44,700
the Bilderberg group and they've said
that nobody is following me. Yeah.

1825
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:48,590
So I'm like, he's behind the tree.
Like I'm by the pool, I'm going,

1826
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:53,340
he's standing behind the tree and
Chicos will not just sit tight.

1827
01:48:53,341 --> 01:48:55,100
I'm sure it's going to,
I'm sure it's going to go away.

1828
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:58,950
So I went down to the beach, Jim Tucker
throughout all of this. By the way,

1829
01:48:58,951 --> 01:49:01,800
he's loving it.
He's loving every fucking second of this.

1830
01:49:02,040 --> 01:49:06,270
It's his dream come true. I'm
sure. Yeah. I go down to the bit,

1831
01:49:06,271 --> 01:49:09,000
I'm petrified.
I want to like abandon the story,

1832
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:14,070
like drive back to England from Portugal
because I'm afraid I'm going to get

1833
01:49:14,071 --> 01:49:18,140
like stopped at immigration. Uh,
Yay in pretty much you can get in.

1834
01:49:18,210 --> 01:49:22,470
Get the ferry from,
from Paris. Uh, so, uh,

1835
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:26,010
so I think it's, it's like a two
day drive, but fuck it. Right.

1836
01:49:26,190 --> 01:49:28,620
So then I had a camera man with me,
David Barker,

1837
01:49:28,621 --> 01:49:30,510
cause I was filming some of
this through a documentary.

1838
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:34,620
He convinced me to like stick it out.
Uh, so I went to the beach and then I,

1839
01:49:34,621 --> 01:49:37,470
and then I came back to the
hotel and I suppose God,

1840
01:49:37,471 --> 01:49:41,160
there's these two men in dark glasses
sitting in the lobby of the hotel.

1841
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:45,840
And as soon as I walk in, they both
grab brochures and start reading them.

1842
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:50,650
And I'm like, fuck. So I go
up to Jim Tucker and I said,

1843
01:49:50,651 --> 01:49:54,760
there's these two men in the lobby
and reading brochures in the morning

1844
01:49:54,761 --> 01:49:59,080
pretending to read broaches uh, Jim
says, how do you, how do you know?

1845
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:01,420
And I said,
you can tell by their demeanor.

1846
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:05,290
And then later when Jim wrote all of
this up for his conspiracy website,

1847
01:50:05,490 --> 01:50:09,490
he like transcribe this conversation.
And he said, I said to Rod, said,

1848
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,550
how could you tell I'm not send replied,
you could tell them by this bell.

1849
01:50:14,540 --> 01:50:16,640
And I'm glad I didn't say smell.
I said to me though,

1850
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:22,780
what does the Bilderberg or
smell like? Yeah, like power.

1851
01:50:23,290 --> 01:50:27,820
So the hedgemon spelled
like badly paid power.

1852
01:50:28,090 --> 01:50:31,450
So, uh, anyway, that was
basically it. But, uh,

1853
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:36,600
the next day we went back to the hotel
and instead at the bottom and watched all

1854
01:50:37,781 --> 01:50:41,560
of these people driving up the
drive. Um, Henry Kissinger,

1855
01:50:41,561 --> 01:50:46,240
David Rockefeller like, yeah, and they
all really did turn up Vernon Jordan,

1856
01:50:46,241 --> 01:50:50,980
who was Bill Clinton's lie man
behind, you know, like, like,

1857
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,400
like Bill Clinton's like, you
know, man in the background,

1858
01:50:54,460 --> 01:50:55,930
lots of people in the background.

1859
01:50:56,350 --> 01:51:00,850
Is there an official explanation for
the Bilderberg group? Yeah, well,

1860
01:51:00,851 --> 01:51:03,220
much later on,
like after all this happened,

1861
01:51:03,221 --> 01:51:06,550
I managed to interview three
members of the Bilderberg group,

1862
01:51:06,551 --> 01:51:08,670
including the secretary general,
uh,

1863
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,870
and including one of their
founding fathers who,

1864
01:51:10,900 --> 01:51:14,680
so who was this British politician
who's still alive, called Denis Healey,

1865
01:51:14,860 --> 01:51:19,270
who was a big labour politician
in the 1970s and he said,

1866
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:24,380
and I believe them, that Bilderberg was
set up after the Second World War. Um,

1867
01:51:24,580 --> 01:51:29,500
because there was this big move against
ideological politicians like post Hitler

1868
01:51:29,690 --> 01:51:31,120
and I were doing any more hit LED's.

1869
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:36,360
So let's cut to create this sort of
globalist one world new world order.

1870
01:51:36,761 --> 01:51:39,340
I mean, you know, the, the phrase
new world order I think is true.

1871
01:51:39,490 --> 01:51:44,490
I think they were trying to create like
a one world government or business would

1872
01:51:44,591 --> 01:51:49,180
be more important than politics because
business people are more trustworthy

1873
01:51:49,420 --> 01:51:52,840
than ideological politicians.
I think that that was their,

1874
01:51:53,050 --> 01:51:57,430
that was their thesis back then.
So it was kind of a centrist,

1875
01:51:57,460 --> 01:52:01,990
almost kind of liberal in a, in a
way. Um, if you buy that Jon Ronson,

1876
01:52:02,200 --> 01:52:06,580
I've got a bridge to you in Portugal when
I think that that was where they came

1877
01:52:06,581 --> 01:52:10,540
from, but of course what
they didn't account for or
maybe did account for it and

1878
01:52:10,541 --> 01:52:15,541
didn't give a shit was the CEOs
would be just as fucking evil and uh,

1879
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:20,230
and, and malicious and ideological
in their own way as politicians.

1880
01:52:20,231 --> 01:52:23,000
And so that's why build a book
became this kind of more nefarious,

1881
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,990
presumably became slightly more nefarious
thing. Yeah. I think if the zone,

1882
01:52:27,010 --> 01:52:32,010
if there's ever going to be one
antidote for power is it's information.

1883
01:52:32,170 --> 01:52:37,170
It's being able to expose all the
dealings and secret organizations like the

1884
01:52:39,041 --> 01:52:43,420
Bilderberg group or to a lesser extent,
the Bohemian Grove type folks.

1885
01:52:43,710 --> 01:52:46,130
Like I think only thing that sort

1886
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:50,870
of mitigates that and diminishes that is
everyone knowing about that and knowing

1887
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:52,140
more people,
excuse me.

1888
01:52:52,141 --> 01:52:54,890
No more people know about the
bill burgs now than ever before.

1889
01:52:54,891 --> 01:52:58,450
The Bilderberg group is like something
that will, people will, they'll, they'll,

1890
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:01,430
they'll say it, they don't really
know a lot. Like I'll say it,

1891
01:53:01,490 --> 01:53:03,980
I don't know much about it.
I know that really important.

1892
01:53:03,981 --> 01:53:07,460
Rich people meet and they discuss things
and every single person has ever been

1893
01:53:07,461 --> 01:53:09,260
president has met.
Yeah,

1894
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:13,430
I set that actually to the secretary
general of the Bilderberg group when I

1895
01:53:13,431 --> 01:53:15,890
interviewed him Skakel Martin
Taylor, I said to, you know,

1896
01:53:15,891 --> 01:53:20,500
you've got so many like up and coming
politicians who ended up being like

1897
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:23,720
president or prime minister.
And he said thank you.

1898
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:27,500
Lucky took that as a
compliment. I like, you know,

1899
01:53:27,501 --> 01:53:31,820
we're good at star spotting the next. And
Denis Healey said to me, look, the idea,

1900
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:34,190
yeah, starts pissing. And
Dennis Haley said to me,

1901
01:53:34,191 --> 01:53:38,000
the idea is to get these
rising politicians and
introduce them to the heads of

1902
01:53:38,001 --> 01:53:43,001
business and hopefully influence them to
be more sensible and more globalist and

1903
01:53:44,481 --> 01:53:49,030
less less nationalist, I
think horror them out. Yeah,

1904
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:52,700
yeah, yeah. I mean it's a network. I
mean, no question. No question. You know,

1905
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:55,760
all these places exist for a reason.
I take a bit of credit.

1906
01:53:55,790 --> 01:54:00,790
I think he might book them was the first
time Bilderberg like was ever discussed

1907
01:54:01,371 --> 01:54:06,290
in kind of mainstream, the mainstream
world. And then shortly after me,

1908
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,720
this journalist called
Charlie's scout and cable long,

1909
01:54:08,721 --> 01:54:11,570
here's another sort of mainstream
writer for the Guardian.

1910
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:15,610
And he goes every year to build a Burg
now and partly result of hearing the

1911
01:54:15,700 --> 01:54:19,070
parties may suddenly build a book is
discussed in the mainstream world.

1912
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:21,170
But when I went to build a burger now,

1913
01:54:21,171 --> 01:54:24,230
like loads of people like turn up
to protest Bilderberg and so on,

1914
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:26,840
and they've even got a bit
of a website now, I think.

1915
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:29,810
And they certainly admit existing
now and it didn't use to,

1916
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:32,840
they kind of have to write
inflammation thing. Yeah.

1917
01:54:32,870 --> 01:54:37,790
So it's partly to do with with them and
partly to Charlie Skelton, your book,

1918
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,280
them. Uh, you know, I'm,

1919
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:44,870
I'm very fascinated by extremists
and, uh, I'm very fascinated by,

1920
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:45,763
uh,

1921
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:50,630
I'm very fascinated by the spectrum of
human thinking and behavior and that

1922
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:55,310
we're all kind of terrified of people
that are on the far end in one way or

1923
01:54:55,311 --> 01:54:55,760
another.

1924
01:54:55,760 --> 01:55:00,650
We're terrified of like extreme lefties
or terrified of extreme righties,

1925
01:55:00,890 --> 01:55:03,710
you know. Did you, when did you,

1926
01:55:04,040 --> 01:55:09,040
was anything like really revealing or
unusual about that journey of trying to

1927
01:55:09,171 --> 01:55:13,130
write that in your own mind?
Did you try to like,

1928
01:55:13,131 --> 01:55:17,600
one of the things I try to do when
I watch like isis videos or a watch,

1929
01:55:17,601 --> 01:55:21,350
like a radical fundamentalist
Islamic guys talk,

1930
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:26,770
I try to imagine myself agreeing with
them and being one of them and being happy

1931
01:55:27,381 --> 01:55:30,950
to be one of them that like, you
know, like there's, there's some,

1932
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:36,460
there's some appeal and some draw to being
extremely confident about what you're

1933
01:55:36,561 --> 01:55:39,140
saying. Even if what you're
saying is absolutely ridiculous,

1934
01:55:39,141 --> 01:55:43,070
like stoning people for homosexuality
and you see all of that happening on

1935
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:46,350
social media, which I write
about in the new book. He had a,

1936
01:55:46,351 --> 01:55:49,950
you see this cut of joy in approval.

1937
01:55:50,220 --> 01:55:54,000
Mutual approval mean that's what I
think is a problem with Twitter is it's,

1938
01:55:54,001 --> 01:55:57,240
it's become like a sort of mutual
approve or machine that we surround us as

1939
01:55:57,241 --> 01:55:59,940
people feel the same way we
do and we approve each other.

1940
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,640
And that's such a great feeling if
everybody gets in the way and says,

1941
01:56:02,641 --> 01:56:05,190
I don't agree with,
with what you're doing here,

1942
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:10,560
you feel ferociously angry about
that when he screamed them out.

1943
01:56:10,561 --> 01:56:11,311
And Yeah.

1944
01:56:11,311 --> 01:56:15,270
So I think this kind of mutual approval
that goes on in both on social media and

1945
01:56:15,271 --> 01:56:18,750
also an extremist groups,
don't you think that people say things?

1946
01:56:18,751 --> 01:56:22,620
A lot of the things they say, they say
knowing that people are going to approve.

1947
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:26,880
So they tailor these things in a way that
like they lick their finger and put it

1948
01:56:26,881 --> 01:56:29,550
up in the air and they catch the wind.
Like, Ooh, the wind's going this way.

1949
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:34,770
I'm going to say something that puts
me on the moral high ground. Yeah.

1950
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:38,970
I'm gonna get a lot of retweets.
Yeah. Uh, yeah. And it's, it's, it's,

1951
01:56:39,030 --> 01:56:42,510
I think it's kind of damaging. I mean,
you know, like you said before, you know,

1952
01:56:42,511 --> 01:56:44,520
I come from a social justice world,

1953
01:56:44,521 --> 01:56:48,270
so I believe in all the things that they
believe in. I believe in gay marriage.

1954
01:56:48,271 --> 01:56:50,130
I believe in all of those things,

1955
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:56,660
but at the same time I feel kind of
uncomfortable when I feel like there's a

1956
01:56:57,061 --> 01:57:01,020
kind of ferocious conformity
going that you have to,

1957
01:57:01,170 --> 01:57:04,410
you have to say it like every
time somebody dies you have to,

1958
01:57:04,570 --> 01:57:08,030
I remember when Robin Williams died, like
I was, I was doing a bit of, I would add,

1959
01:57:08,060 --> 01:57:12,690
I was promoting some show I was doing or
something I'd written and I didn't know

1960
01:57:12,691 --> 01:57:17,691
Robin Williams had died and so I tweeted
like something about some show I was

1961
01:57:18,361 --> 01:57:20,850
doing and I got like a kind of,
you know,

1962
01:57:20,851 --> 01:57:23,070
50 people immediately
tweeted me basically saying,

1963
01:57:23,071 --> 01:57:25,320
how dare you promote
something when you know,

1964
01:57:25,321 --> 01:57:28,810
we're also upset that Robin Williams has
just died because I had notice of our

1965
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:31,200
music and there's that,
there's that kind of conformance again,

1966
01:57:31,201 --> 01:57:35,670
the kind of our Ip conformance
and everybody has to the
RFP and it's all good.

1967
01:57:35,670 --> 01:57:36,960
It's all coming from a good place.

1968
01:57:36,961 --> 01:57:40,500
It's all coming from places that there's
teaching us how to care and teaching us

1969
01:57:40,501 --> 01:57:41,830
how to like level the failed.

1970
01:57:41,860 --> 01:57:45,510
Not because how they know that you didn't
know or how they know whether or not

1971
01:57:45,511 --> 01:57:49,650
you knew. I didn't know. But
that's really common. I mean,

1972
01:57:49,830 --> 01:57:54,120
you can't be expected to be
abreast of every single news story,

1973
01:57:54,810 --> 01:57:57,080
especially something like a suicide,

1974
01:57:57,090 --> 01:57:59,400
something that comes on and it's not
like something that you have to pay

1975
01:57:59,401 --> 01:58:03,930
attention to. Like, you know, a military
operation that we're all aware of. No,

1976
01:58:04,130 --> 01:58:07,830
this is a random celebrity
decides to take his life.

1977
01:58:07,831 --> 01:58:12,390
How could you possibly be forced
to know about that? And I'm,

1978
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,220
the problem is, you know, like on,

1979
01:58:14,221 --> 01:58:17,280
on social media we see
ourselves is nonconformist.

1980
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:22,310
But what this does is
create a kind of fearful,

1981
01:58:22,531 --> 01:58:26,310
conformist world where you have to say
what everybody else to say and quite

1982
01:58:26,530 --> 01:58:30,450
conforming to nonconformity. Yeah. It's
like I would see people that were, um,

1983
01:58:30,720 --> 01:58:34,110
you know, um, they dress like rebels,

1984
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:39,470
but they dress like the same rebels.
They're typically unique. You know,

1985
01:58:39,660 --> 01:58:42,000
you see someone who's got their hair

1986
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,910
is dyed pink and you know, they don't
give a fuck, but you don't give a fuck.

1987
01:58:45,911 --> 01:58:48,730
Like everybody around you doesn't give
a fuck. Like you're wearing a uniform,

1988
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,940
whether you know it or not. You look
like someone's going to Catholic school.

1989
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:55,600
Like you might think that
you're some sort of a rebel,

1990
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:58,990
but the real rebels are
indistinguishable from everyone else.

1991
01:58:59,260 --> 01:59:01,100
And the way they dress and the way they,

1992
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:04,390
they look because they're just
people you know, were there,

1993
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,160
there are no real rebels.

1994
01:59:06,460 --> 01:59:09,940
Like all real rebel is just someone who
has their own opinion that may or may

1995
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:14,860
not go with the standard opinion
that we're being supposed to,

1996
01:59:14,861 --> 01:59:16,540
uh, that we're, we're supposed to absorb.

1997
01:59:17,350 --> 01:59:21,940
The idea of conforming to
nonconformity is so ironic though.

1998
01:59:21,941 --> 01:59:25,060
It's like the one thing that
you are rallying against.

1999
01:59:25,061 --> 01:59:27,640
It's the one thing that you don't
even realize you are becoming.

2000
01:59:28,050 --> 01:59:32,790
Yeah. And it's, you know, the, the,
the negative byproducts of all of this,

2001
01:59:32,791 --> 01:59:37,770
a a big, it makes people fearful.
It makes people shut the fuck up.

2002
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:43,380
Um, I also what it is, it
declares war on human nature.

2003
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:44,010
You know,

2004
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:49,010
this is the reason why I really wanted
to ride the public shaming book cause I,

2005
01:59:49,561 --> 01:59:54,150
I felt like war had been declared on
human nature instead of trying to work out

2006
01:59:54,151 --> 01:59:58,560
why people transgress, you know,
and it's sort of compassionate way.

2007
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:03,770
It's, it just, it just destroys
people for transgressing, um,

2008
02:00:04,230 --> 02:00:07,620
are and everybody transgresses
Effie human transgressors.

2009
02:00:07,920 --> 02:00:12,000
And when we so ferociously destroyer
the people for transgressing,

2010
02:00:12,300 --> 02:00:17,250
we're shutting off really
significant realities about humans,

2011
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:20,550
which is a fact that if,
if we tried to understand each other,

2012
02:00:20,850 --> 02:00:25,170
it would make the world more compassionate
and we would understand why people

2013
02:00:25,171 --> 02:00:26,730
transgressed ball.
Yeah.

2014
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:29,770
What we're talking about too is you're,

2015
02:00:29,780 --> 02:00:34,780
you're not talking about rallying
against someone who's committing horrible

2016
02:00:35,081 --> 02:00:38,980
atrocities. Someone's committing crimes
against humanity, torturing people,

2017
02:00:38,981 --> 02:00:42,970
murdering people. You're, you know, you're
talking about differences of opinion.

2018
02:00:43,140 --> 02:00:46,620
Yeah. I mean some people's
transgressions are so serious.

2019
02:00:46,710 --> 02:00:51,360
It deserves to overwhelm them and
they deserve to be defined by them.

2020
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:56,260
And we're all like sort of
in, commiserating and we're
all sort of in agreement.

2021
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:01,400
We're all sort of bonding together on
this, like, hey, like as humans we were,

2022
02:01:01,401 --> 02:01:03,550
we're not going to tolerate
this behavior because it's evil.

2023
02:01:03,710 --> 02:01:08,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But this is all
a long way away from the question,

2024
02:01:08,151 --> 02:01:11,750
which was about kind of hanging out
with extremist groups and so on.

2025
02:01:12,050 --> 02:01:14,720
And when I discovered some things that
I think people would have known at the

2026
02:01:14,721 --> 02:01:17,000
time in one was that they were all
conspiracy theorists. You know,

2027
02:01:17,001 --> 02:01:21,500
that was what United the Ku Klux Klan
with the Islamic fundamentalist group or

2028
02:01:21,501 --> 02:01:25,130
hung out with code [inaudible].
I spent a year with this Islamic group.

2029
02:01:25,131 --> 02:01:28,970
Could have had to really spend a year
with them. Yeah. I became like their,

2030
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:31,520
their chauffeur.
They said to me,

2031
02:01:31,521 --> 02:01:35,120
oh my Bakary the head of the group
said to me after a few months, like,

2032
02:01:35,121 --> 02:01:39,020
I have let you into my life, uh, I've
given you much, I want something in.

2033
02:01:39,980 --> 02:01:42,920
So I was like, whoa. And he said,
can you drag me to office world?

2034
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:48,440
I need pencils. Yeah. What do you
need to guess? Photocopying, done,

2035
02:01:48,441 --> 02:01:52,460
like crushed the pilot state of Israel.
So I become like a show first up,

2036
02:01:52,461 --> 02:01:57,440
driving him everywhere and yeah, that
was the awkward. Did you go home?

2037
02:01:57,470 --> 02:01:59,390
Did you,
when you said you wear them for a year,

2038
02:01:59,610 --> 02:02:02,450
like Hermione lift like a couple
of miles up the road for me.

2039
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:04,580
You can get up in the morning.
Bye honey.

2040
02:02:04,581 --> 02:02:07,690
I'm going to go hang out with
fundamentalism, hang out with Omar.

2041
02:02:07,700 --> 02:02:09,830
He needs to pass some
collection boxes for Hamas.

2042
02:02:09,831 --> 02:02:12,090
And he said it needs to be
driven to the cash and carry.

2043
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:16,670
Now Dan thought that's a
very scary organization.

2044
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:19,310
This was pre nine 11.
I'm an old.

2045
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:22,760
Most of the stories I've told
them like today for my book them,

2046
02:02:22,761 --> 02:02:25,020
which was pre nine 11,
um,

2047
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:28,160
and so less scary.

2048
02:02:28,430 --> 02:02:31,580
Like people thought they were ridiculous.

2049
02:02:31,581 --> 02:02:35,870
Like not that much had happened to that
stage while I was there with them for

2050
02:02:35,871 --> 02:02:37,760
the year though.
I mean all you know now,

2051
02:02:38,090 --> 02:02:42,470
so many like suicide bombers and so
on and so many journalists get killed.

2052
02:02:42,500 --> 02:02:43,550
Yeah,
that's,

2053
02:02:43,580 --> 02:02:48,380
I mean that could have been you easily
if you were dealing with a decade later.

2054
02:02:48,890 --> 02:02:51,560
Yes. Or even a couple of,
I mean, when Daniel Pearl,

2055
02:02:51,561 --> 02:02:56,480
that was pretty relaxed stages of
the Iraq war, right? Two or three.

2056
02:02:56,780 --> 02:03:00,050
I was only what, four years?
And that was the first one, man,

2057
02:03:00,051 --> 02:03:01,610
that was the first one.
They had the video.

2058
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:06,850
I remember watching that online against
my own better judgment and hasn't

2059
02:03:06,860 --> 02:03:11,090
haunted you. Oh, you can never get past
that one. And what's crazy is the one,

2060
02:03:11,120 --> 02:03:12,980
that one,
it had such an impact.

2061
02:03:13,340 --> 02:03:17,330
And then I've seen a few of them since
then and they didn't have nearly as much

2062
02:03:17,331 --> 02:03:17,720
impact.

2063
02:03:17,720 --> 02:03:21,920
It's like slowly but surely you get numb
to it because I've never watched any of

2064
02:03:21,921 --> 02:03:22,491
these videos.

2065
02:03:22,491 --> 02:03:27,491
But I was in Brooklyn and the taxi driver
told me that he watches like all of

2066
02:03:28,191 --> 02:03:32,390
them. And I said, I've never watched
out here with him. And he said, well,

2067
02:03:32,391 --> 02:03:35,600
I say the one you really shouldn't
watch Daniel Pearl. Yeah.

2068
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:38,210
I haven't watched anything. So
I did a, what he meant by that.

2069
02:03:38,360 --> 02:03:41,720
There was a lot of conspiracy theories
are evolving. That one as well.

2070
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:43,960
There was a lot of conspiracy
theories that there was a,

2071
02:03:44,210 --> 02:03:49,210
that he was killed by the CIA in order
to keep people out of there and justify

2072
02:03:50,031 --> 02:03:54,230
our attacks on Islamic fundamentalists
and that they had killed him because he

2073
02:03:54,231 --> 02:03:57,950
was going to reveal information
about all sorts of different shit.

2074
02:03:57,951 --> 02:04:01,410
And there was like a whole
video dedicated to, uh,

2075
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:06,540
describing why these people were not
Arabs and that their accent was wrong.

2076
02:04:06,770 --> 02:04:08,540
The,
their size was wrong.

2077
02:04:08,630 --> 02:04:13,630
They were built more like a American
military people and the right conspiracy

2078
02:04:14,811 --> 02:04:19,520
theories. It's a weird thing. It's because
you mentioned conspiracies. I mean,

2079
02:04:19,521 --> 02:04:23,000
you know, I got chased away from
Bilderberg, I snuck into Bohemian Grove.

2080
02:04:23,170 --> 02:04:24,780
There are conspiracies.
Um,

2081
02:04:25,220 --> 02:04:29,540
and there's also stuff like
operation Northwoods where
the Joint Chiefs of staff,

2082
02:04:29,541 --> 02:04:33,180
it's signed that the papers saying
that they were going to try to, uh,

2083
02:04:33,380 --> 02:04:35,690
fake attacks on American civilians.

2084
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:38,160
They were going to arm Cuban
friendlies and attack wanton him,

2085
02:04:38,161 --> 02:04:41,610
obey the all in order to get us
into a war with Cuba. I mean,

2086
02:04:41,611 --> 02:04:46,200
so it's not like it hasn't been proposed
or it hasn't been even act it out.

2087
02:04:46,201 --> 02:04:49,350
Like what happened in the Gulf of
Tonkin. I mean, there are real,

2088
02:04:49,351 --> 02:04:53,760
real conspiracies that actually do happen
even in its own little way. My, my book,

2089
02:04:53,820 --> 02:04:56,730
the minister goats kind
of proves conspiracies.

2090
02:04:56,730 --> 02:05:00,330
It proves that that they would charge
in your book, sorry to interrupt you.

2091
02:05:00,770 --> 02:05:04,690
What was the difference in your book and
the movie? Uh, okay. In the book, I mean,

2092
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:08,290
I never actually went to Iraq,
the Ewan Mcgregor cat,

2093
02:05:08,291 --> 02:05:13,260
so that's kind of based on the goats
were back in the movie in real life.

2094
02:05:13,290 --> 02:05:16,670
I just hung around like military
basis in America self, um,

2095
02:05:16,890 --> 02:05:21,180
Fort Meade and Fort Bragg,
uh, at the end of the movie,

2096
02:05:21,181 --> 02:05:25,800
Ewan McGregor managers to walk through
a wall and I never managed to work.

2097
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:29,940
I said I didn't have the movies
kind of tongue in cheek. Yeah.

2098
02:05:29,941 --> 02:05:31,320
The book is more serious.
The book,

2099
02:05:31,350 --> 02:05:35,730
the book starts off with
the kind of comedy of all of
this crazy stuff they were

2100
02:05:35,731 --> 02:05:38,260
trying out in the seventies and eighties.
Lat,

2101
02:05:38,270 --> 02:05:42,270
trying to kill goats just by staring at
them, tried to learn how to be invisible,

2102
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:45,060
which by the way, and after,
after, after a while they adapted.

2103
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:50,420
They went from invisibility to trying
to find a way of not being seen.

2104
02:05:51,150 --> 02:05:55,370
So I'm like, that's, you know, I
said like camouflage. No, I invented,

2105
02:05:55,380 --> 02:05:59,310
I interviewed this guy who was a military
guy that was work on their remote

2106
02:05:59,311 --> 02:06:03,600
viewing. Yeah. Who, who was
it? I would have probably
met this person for his name.

2107
02:06:03,601 --> 02:06:04,960
I'll Google was that day.

2108
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:10,590
He went psychically spied
the lot. Best months. Not,

2109
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:13,020
that's not soon determined
that it was a dinosaurs ghost.

2110
02:06:13,380 --> 02:06:16,670
A dinosaurs ghost zoning. Really
Sad. Yeah. He's a character.

2111
02:06:17,310 --> 02:06:20,790
He was showing me pictures
of his hot girlfriend. Yeah.

2112
02:06:20,791 --> 02:06:23,610
He was one of the main that
day it was Joe mcmonagle.

2113
02:06:24,030 --> 02:06:27,810
Like all of these real life stories.
Real hot Russian.

2114
02:06:28,310 --> 02:06:31,550
Well Dude,
his baton way over side.

2115
02:06:31,590 --> 02:06:35,370
So I met and maybe remote
viewed that, uh, you know,

2116
02:06:35,430 --> 02:06:38,820
if you're psychic spy, I tell you what,
they're being a black cup military.

2117
02:06:38,821 --> 02:06:43,770
Psychic spy isn't as glamorous as it
sounds. Stressful, stressful. Plus,

2118
02:06:43,771 --> 02:06:47,700
you've got your black ops, you've got no
light budget, you've got no, you can't.

2119
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:49,410
You can't, you don't, you're
not a lot of coffee machine.

2120
02:06:49,411 --> 02:06:51,530
You have to bring your own
coffee and to work. Really. Yeah.

2121
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:55,650
A couple of the remote viewers told me
how annoyed they were that because they

2122
02:06:55,651 --> 02:06:58,220
were black up, they had to
bring their own coffee into it.

2123
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:04,770
Plus what does it actually mean to be a
psychic spy working for the U s military?

2124
02:07:04,771 --> 02:07:09,240
What it actually means is that like for
20 years you go into some room at Fort

2125
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:14,010
Meade and try and be psychic.
It's kind of a shit job. Yeah.

2126
02:07:14,490 --> 02:07:16,980
I interviewed another guy,
I forget his name,

2127
02:07:16,981 --> 02:07:21,300
but we actually tried it out and uh,
we tried to remote view things.

2128
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:24,660
Did they have any, did he get any
luck? No. Those me and this guy,

2129
02:07:24,661 --> 02:07:29,530
Dj growthy who's a, Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah. He's a skeptic. Randy Guy. Yeah.

2130
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:32,190
He's a,
a debunker skeptic.

2131
02:07:32,191 --> 02:07:36,010
And he and I were on the same page
or like know we, we came up with

2132
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,100
some random shapes and we're
supposed to envision this area.

2133
02:07:39,340 --> 02:07:42,370
And then we went to the area and he was
trying to find hits. And I'm like, man,

2134
02:07:42,371 --> 02:07:45,730
I mean you're talking like angles.
Like you could fuck anywhere you go,

2135
02:07:45,731 --> 02:07:49,540
that's man made, you're going to
find angles that are similar to this.

2136
02:07:49,541 --> 02:07:54,010
And you know, we picked out a few
colors that were like super common.

2137
02:07:54,011 --> 02:07:57,730
You find those colors. Yeah,
we get some really lucky hits,

2138
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:00,790
but think about all the shit that we
were wrong with. And he's all about like,

2139
02:08:00,791 --> 02:08:03,910
it's just, don't think too much. Just
let it come to you. Let it come you.

2140
02:08:03,911 --> 02:08:07,960
So you're supposed to scribble shit
down. And Yeah. So mind blowingly dumb.

2141
02:08:08,290 --> 02:08:12,140
And the uh, ed dames guy
was telling me that, uh,

2142
02:08:12,170 --> 02:08:16,390
they had actually had found Osama, I think
it was Osama bin Laden, he was saying,

2143
02:08:17,290 --> 02:08:18,460
sorry for,
can't remember correctly,

2144
02:08:18,461 --> 02:08:20,170
because it was all
nonsense to me at the time.

2145
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:23,980
But they didn't go after him because
they didn't want to win the war because

2146
02:08:23,981 --> 02:08:25,470
they didn't want the war to end.
Right.

2147
02:08:25,540 --> 02:08:28,240
Because the people had a vested
interest in keeping the war going.

2148
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:33,160
And that was sort of as a idea behind why
this remote viewing wasn't successful.

2149
02:08:33,600 --> 02:08:36,910
But he was citing all these different
instances where we're remote viewing was

2150
02:08:36,911 --> 02:08:40,590
successful. And I was like, Ooh
man, I don't know about all that.

2151
02:08:41,140 --> 02:08:44,470
Yeah. I remember one time
they were looking for Noriega,

2152
02:08:45,100 --> 02:08:48,770
General Noriega and the remote view
with what I called in to find out.

2153
02:08:49,540 --> 02:08:51,550
I'm one of the remote viewers.
It might've been at dames,

2154
02:08:51,551 --> 02:08:55,550
actually one of the remote viewers
psychically defined that. Um,

2155
02:08:56,020 --> 02:09:00,190
Angela Lansbury knew when Noriko
was, oh, that bitch. Yeah.

2156
02:09:01,090 --> 02:09:03,490
What? I don't know. What I don't
know is whether they actually for,

2157
02:09:03,491 --> 02:09:07,120
you asked Angela Lansbury order.
What I discovered though,

2158
02:09:07,790 --> 02:09:09,940
it just been remote viewing.
I wouldn't have wanted to,

2159
02:09:10,040 --> 02:09:13,360
to written a metastatic coats because
I found the remote viewing things a bit

2160
02:09:13,361 --> 02:09:14,194
boring.

2161
02:09:14,230 --> 02:09:17,920
But then what I discovered just through
asking people was there was all this

2162
02:09:17,921 --> 02:09:22,480
other shit going on.
Like they were trying to fast for a month,

2163
02:09:22,481 --> 02:09:25,150
trying to burst clouds
just by pointing them,

2164
02:09:25,450 --> 02:09:28,450
try to kill goats just by
staring at them. And, and,

2165
02:09:28,540 --> 02:09:30,790
and that stuff was so fun to me.

2166
02:09:30,790 --> 02:09:35,290
And then I discovered after like a year
of, of like interviewing these guys,

2167
02:09:35,291 --> 02:09:37,270
I discovered that there was a line,

2168
02:09:37,271 --> 02:09:40,660
I'm going to really crooked line but
allied none the less between some of these

2169
02:09:40,661 --> 02:09:43,840
crazy and Devis in the night and seventies
and eighties and some of the kind of

2170
02:09:43,841 --> 02:09:47,320
exotic in interrogation techniques
that were happening at Guantanamo Bay,

2171
02:09:47,730 --> 02:09:51,430
Abu Ghraib. So in the book cause
cause some of the same people,

2172
02:09:51,431 --> 02:09:55,660
like there was a colonel could John
Alexander who was involved in like exotic,

2173
02:09:55,950 --> 02:09:56,591
um,
you know,

2174
02:09:56,591 --> 02:10:00,960
sound blasting and all the nonlethal
weapons and he's a guy should have on your

2175
02:10:00,970 --> 02:10:05,440
show actually. Uh, he's incredible
guy. Um, so the monastery goats,

2176
02:10:05,441 --> 02:10:08,200
the book sort of starts
funny and gets dark,

2177
02:10:08,350 --> 02:10:12,700
whereas the movie kind of stayed funny
and kind of didn't go into the darkness

2178
02:10:12,701 --> 02:10:17,680
in that way. How much money they spend
on that remote viewing thing for a long,

2179
02:10:17,681 --> 02:10:21,160
$20 million.
$20 million.

2180
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:26,180
Is there any one piece of evidence
that they could point to that was like,

2181
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:30,880
no. Every so often like a unit would get
sick of it. Like it was being run by the,

2182
02:10:31,160 --> 02:10:33,950
um, I dunno the, the DEA or

2183
02:10:34,310 --> 02:10:34,730
you know,
the,

2184
02:10:34,730 --> 02:10:38,500
the u s army or military intelligence
and then it gets sick of it and then

2185
02:10:38,520 --> 02:10:43,130
they'd dissolve viewing.
Right. Is that a dames? Okay.

2186
02:10:43,160 --> 02:10:47,600
That's not him. No, no. That side of
the Games. It's his website. Yeah.

2187
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:52,780
He's an older gentleman that it
ended up back with the CIA in 1995.

2188
02:10:52,881 --> 02:10:56,690
CIA's greatest weapon as the power to
change your life forever, right? Oh,

2189
02:10:56,691 --> 02:11:00,600
so now you're using it like, and look,
they have a live support Gal. Look,

2190
02:11:00,601 --> 02:11:03,680
she's pretty too, and need live
support calls. Pretty girl.

2191
02:11:03,800 --> 02:11:06,950
Why don't they have an angry black
guy who could beat your ass? Nope.

2192
02:11:07,100 --> 02:11:10,970
Pretty white girl. It's been
funny. It's like welcoming.

2193
02:11:11,090 --> 02:11:14,990
I'm smiling at you might have beautiful
eyes. Do you need live support?

2194
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:19,490
Call me sugar. I'll show you how to find
your dog. Here's something interesting.

2195
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:20,353
You know the guy,

2196
02:11:20,630 --> 02:11:25,550
the first guy who ran the remote view
is back in the very earliest days of

2197
02:11:25,551 --> 02:11:30,551
remote viewing was a guy called Sydney
Gottlieb and he was the same guy who ran

2198
02:11:31,430 --> 02:11:36,170
mk ultra in the 50s like so all
the kind of poisoning people,

2199
02:11:36,420 --> 02:11:40,400
this sparking people's drinks with LSD
going off to Cuba to try to assassinate

2200
02:11:40,401 --> 02:11:44,390
Castro by putting like a bomb in
his cigar or poisoning his wet suit.

2201
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:49,100
So of this really dark CIA shit that
was happening in the 50s was run by this

2202
02:11:49,101 --> 02:11:50,180
Guy Sydney Gottlieb,

2203
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:53,540
and he was the same guy who run the
remote viewers in the 70s I was,

2204
02:11:53,541 --> 02:11:57,020
that was kind of interesting. That is
interesting. Yeah. Well, without a doubt.

2205
02:11:57,021 --> 02:11:59,600
They've definitely experimented on people
to try to find out whether or not they

2206
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:02,850
could control them. That's a
hundred oh no question. Um,

2207
02:12:02,930 --> 02:12:06,860
there's a south of oppression.
Could artichoke. I became
friends with Eric Olsen,

2208
02:12:06,861 --> 02:12:08,300
who's father was Franco said,

2209
02:12:08,301 --> 02:12:13,301
who's the guy who purportedly was given
LSD by the CIA and then jumped out of a

2210
02:12:13,341 --> 02:12:15,800
window in New York and killed himself.

2211
02:12:15,830 --> 02:12:19,040
Do you know that Ted Kaczynski was a
part of the Harvard studies on Lsd?

2212
02:12:19,100 --> 02:12:20,230
Oh really? Yeah. There,

2213
02:12:20,231 --> 02:12:24,140
there was a German documentary called
the net that sort of highlighted this and

2214
02:12:24,141 --> 02:12:28,310
it was all about his participation in
the LSD studies and how it pushed him off

2215
02:12:28,311 --> 02:12:30,740
the rails. Right. And then he
went fucking crazy and went,

2216
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:33,080
went off to teach at Berkeley,

2217
02:12:33,380 --> 02:12:35,720
saved all his money from teaching
and then went to live in the woods.

2218
02:12:36,350 --> 02:12:39,500
And Kendall people too
didn't can key CICA is LSD.

2219
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:44,540
I do not know if that's the case. I
mean he might've been. Um, but uh,

2220
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:48,110
the Kaczynski thing is pretty well
documented that he was a part of those

2221
02:12:48,111 --> 02:12:51,410
studies. Right. And, uh, you know, I mean,

2222
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:55,920
I have a friend whose sister is out of
her fucking mind. She went on a, uh,

2223
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:59,900
a couple of LSD trips and took
way too much. And to this day,

2224
02:12:59,901 --> 02:13:02,850
there was like seven years ago. To
this day, she's all fucked up. Hmm.

2225
02:13:02,930 --> 02:13:05,240
So it can happen,
especially if you have,

2226
02:13:05,690 --> 02:13:10,250
if you're mentally unstable to begin
with and you get dosed, spiked, you know,

2227
02:13:10,280 --> 02:13:12,200
it's totally possible.
I mean,

2228
02:13:12,470 --> 02:13:15,470
people that have all of a
slippery grip on reality,

2229
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:19,880
any really traumatic
experience in any real,

2230
02:13:20,180 --> 02:13:23,990
anything that's like super perturbing
to your state of consciousness has the

2231
02:13:23,991 --> 02:13:28,100
potential to set you off the rails and
a way that you might not be able to

2232
02:13:28,101 --> 02:13:32,150
recover from. I mean, it is possible.
And they did a lot of fucking

2233
02:13:32,150 --> 02:13:35,340
explode at that LSD with people.
I know it's worse shit than that.

2234
02:13:35,341 --> 02:13:39,550
There was this thing called artichoke
where they were like experimenting in I,

2235
02:13:39,551 --> 02:13:42,650
I believe this is all been verified.
Their experiment again,

2236
02:13:42,660 --> 02:13:47,460
in getting people hooked on heroin and
then withdrawing the heroin and making

2237
02:13:47,461 --> 02:13:51,650
them do cold Turkey as a means of getting
information out to them. Wow. Yeah.

2238
02:13:51,990 --> 02:13:55,750
And that was like related to Mk ultra.
I mean, yeah. You talked about consent.

2239
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:58,650
Conspiracy has been true. I'm couch
is a conspiracy. That was true.

2240
02:13:58,730 --> 02:14:01,820
Yeah. There's plenty of those
that are true and when look,

2241
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:06,670
especially when you're dealing with the
Cold War and this terrible, terrible,

2242
02:14:07,070 --> 02:14:11,930
terrible thought that the Soviet Union
was ready to drop bombs and your children

2243
02:14:11,931 --> 02:14:15,580
any day of the week and that they're doing
things like this. And then, you know,

2244
02:14:15,590 --> 02:14:19,370
the Nazis had been doing things like this
and we know about all the experiments

2245
02:14:19,371 --> 02:14:23,840
of the Japanese it did and the rape of
Nam King and the horrible things that the

2246
02:14:23,841 --> 02:14:27,440
Nazis had done to the prisoners of war.
I mean,

2247
02:14:27,540 --> 02:14:31,410
I'm weren't, some American
didn't m couch S. Dot.

2248
02:14:31,470 --> 02:14:34,770
Or in the early days of m couches,
some Americans were,

2249
02:14:35,340 --> 02:14:39,590
some American soldiers were
kidnapped by the Korean.

2250
02:14:39,591 --> 02:14:41,460
So then there was seen on TV like Sag,

2251
02:14:41,461 --> 02:14:45,810
we've announced America and they would
try to work out like how the Koreans and

2252
02:14:45,811 --> 02:14:47,100
my memory's really sketchy on us,

2253
02:14:47,101 --> 02:14:50,190
but then try to work out like how the
Koreans and managed to brainwash these

2254
02:14:50,191 --> 02:14:52,500
three American servicemen so easily.

2255
02:14:52,501 --> 02:14:55,310
And that was one of the reasons
why they started mk ultra.

2256
02:14:55,311 --> 02:14:56,460
I might be getting confused.

2257
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:56,731
Well,

2258
02:14:56,731 --> 02:15:00,890
that's one of the reasons why I wanted
to ask you about your work with extremest

2259
02:15:00,920 --> 02:15:04,940
because I always wonder like is
it appealing? Like when you're,

2260
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:09,390
I mean obviously you're not
a white supremacist or an
Islamic fundamentalists or

2261
02:15:09,391 --> 02:15:13,140
anything, but when you're with
them for a long period of time,

2262
02:15:13,141 --> 02:15:18,090
when you're embedded, is there any draw?

2263
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:20,400
Is there any, uh, somehow or another,

2264
02:15:20,610 --> 02:15:24,790
is there any pull towards like
thinking and inclination, a, a,

2265
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:28,050
is there an attraction to either ideology?

2266
02:15:28,170 --> 02:15:30,570
I, you know, never to that ideology,

2267
02:15:30,600 --> 02:15:33,630
but what I did always like,
um,

2268
02:15:33,930 --> 02:15:37,710
like throughout my rights
in Korea at the Times I'm,

2269
02:15:37,711 --> 02:15:39,640
I'm at my happiest times are,

2270
02:15:39,641 --> 02:15:43,440
I think a story is really working
is when something shifts and May,

2271
02:15:43,441 --> 02:15:47,520
like I spent so much time with conspiracy
theorists and then suddenly I'm being

2272
02:15:47,521 --> 02:15:51,380
chased by the Bilderberg group
and I go fucking, that's like,

2273
02:15:51,381 --> 02:15:55,740
I've become like paranoid. And that's what
I know. Like at the bottom of my brain.

2274
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:58,350
I know that like what's
happening to me is terrifying,

2275
02:15:58,530 --> 02:16:01,680
but the fact that I've gone through this
really big change means it's going to

2276
02:16:01,681 --> 02:16:03,120
be a really fucking good piece of writing.

2277
02:16:03,570 --> 02:16:06,720
And that happened in them and it happened
in the psychopath test to actually

2278
02:16:06,721 --> 02:16:11,270
that I became completely drunk with
my psychopaths spotting powers.

2279
02:16:11,280 --> 02:16:15,570
Like I went on a course to learn how to
spot psychopaths and I got so drunk with

2280
02:16:15,571 --> 02:16:20,070
my psychopaths spotting powers that I
changed and like my friends were saying to

2281
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:23,550
me like, you've really changed Peter
Straughan who wrote the screenplay for the

2282
02:16:23,551 --> 02:16:28,050
metastatic goats told me he was concerned
about me because I was so convinced I

2283
02:16:28,051 --> 02:16:32,270
could spot psychopaths everywhere.
What do you look for? Um, well, yeah,

2284
02:16:32,320 --> 02:16:35,620
nuances of language. Um,
the first half of my book,

2285
02:16:35,621 --> 02:16:39,070
the psychopath test sort of teaches people
how to spell [inaudible] and then the

2286
02:16:39,071 --> 02:16:42,970
second half becomes like a cautionary
tale to not get so fucking drunk with the

2287
02:16:42,971 --> 02:16:47,380
power is that it turns you a little bit
psychopathic black nuances of language.

2288
02:16:47,440 --> 02:16:48,700
Um,
you know,

2289
02:16:48,701 --> 02:16:53,140
there's like a 20 point checklist where
it all comes from lack of empathy,

2290
02:16:53,440 --> 02:16:57,930
lack of remorse. I went, I
started meeting like CEOs and,

2291
02:16:57,931 --> 02:17:01,990
and doing the psychopath checklist on
them to see if it's true that you're more

2292
02:17:01,991 --> 02:17:05,230
likely to fund psychopathic at the
top of the trees and the bottom. Um,

2293
02:17:05,500 --> 02:17:08,890
I'll give you one example. Is that
true? Yeah, I think that is true.

2294
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:13,090
I think you are more likely to find
psychopaths it though at the top of the

2295
02:17:13,091 --> 02:17:17,620
trees and at the bottom because
capitalism rewards psychopathic behavior.

2296
02:17:17,780 --> 02:17:19,720
Well isn't the definition to that?

2297
02:17:19,721 --> 02:17:23,320
A psychopath is someone that has
power or as a sociopath, as someone,

2298
02:17:23,321 --> 02:17:26,920
like there's some sort of, uh, you know,
the whole cyber had sociopath thing.

2299
02:17:26,921 --> 02:17:30,190
There's a lot of blurry. Yeah. There's
a lot of debate out there is to,

2300
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:34,720
and different psychiatrists
and psychologists will use
the terms. Like, I mean,

2301
02:17:34,721 --> 02:17:37,270
the upshot is that added thickness.
Any real difference?

2302
02:17:37,840 --> 02:17:41,950
Some people will say there's a
difference, um, because they'll,

2303
02:17:41,970 --> 02:17:46,090
they'll bring their own sort of analyses
to the situation. But, but in general,

2304
02:17:46,091 --> 02:17:50,080
you're talking about a kind of a lack of
empathy or neurological lack of empathy,

2305
02:17:50,380 --> 02:17:52,750
whether it's new or logical or
whether it's through childhood abuse.

2306
02:17:52,751 --> 02:17:55,990
That's another big matter of
debate amongst those people. But,

2307
02:17:56,130 --> 02:17:58,030
but I'll give you a kind of
classic example from the book.

2308
02:17:58,031 --> 02:18:01,750
I went to meet this Haitian
dictator called toto,

2309
02:18:01,751 --> 02:18:05,140
constant in jail,
in upstate New York.

2310
02:18:05,380 --> 02:18:07,590
I had met him a few times before,
um,

2311
02:18:07,690 --> 02:18:12,490
but I met him in jail and
he kept on saying to me,

2312
02:18:13,210 --> 02:18:15,340
I want people to like me.

2313
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:18,490
Like I really want people to like
me captain saying that to me.

2314
02:18:18,820 --> 02:18:23,560
So finally I said to him, isn't that a
weakness? Like wanting people to like you?

2315
02:18:23,561 --> 02:18:26,680
Isn't that a weakness? And he said,
no, no, no, it's not a weakness.

2316
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:28,750
Because if you can get people to like you,

2317
02:18:28,930 --> 02:18:33,850
you can manipulate them to do whatever you
want them to do. Whoa. Yeah. So I said,

2318
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:38,200
so are you the sort of person who doesn't
really feel like empathy? And he said,

2319
02:18:38,620 --> 02:18:42,420
no. Now empathy is a weakness.
So that that's a well,

2320
02:18:42,421 --> 02:18:47,230
that's clearly telltale that I've,
I've, um, I guess he figured, well,

2321
02:18:47,231 --> 02:18:49,210
fuck it, I'm in jail. It's
lots of care out of the bag.

2322
02:18:49,211 --> 02:18:52,240
I'm not getting out of here.
And all cells sometimes they're like,

2323
02:18:52,360 --> 02:18:56,470
like I said this to an old KGB
spy met one time. Like I said,

2324
02:18:56,471 --> 02:18:59,590
well you were bullied at school. And
he said, yes, yes, yes, I was a bully.

2325
02:18:59,800 --> 02:19:00,760
He said that he was English.

2326
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:04,680
He said I would get out from
behind a tree and had to have it,

2327
02:19:04,681 --> 02:19:07,510
like my bag would have bricks ness
and I'd hit somebody over the head,

2328
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:10,930
which is quite, yeah. And I said, he
said, but I'd only get the bullies.

2329
02:19:10,931 --> 02:19:14,830
I'd only get the police. So I said, and
how did you feel about that? And he said,

2330
02:19:14,831 --> 02:19:19,030
I felt good. And I said, and how do you
feel now? Like all these years later,

2331
02:19:19,270 --> 02:19:24,070
looking back on it, how do
you feel now? And he said, I
still feel good. And I said,

2332
02:19:24,071 --> 02:19:27,160
so you're not the sort of person
who feels empathy. And he said,

2333
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:31,580
you've really got to the nub of
what kind of crank Kayam he said,

2334
02:19:31,581 --> 02:19:34,640
when a dog dies,
like one of my dogs dies.

2335
02:19:34,641 --> 02:19:37,310
I feel incredibly upset our cry.

2336
02:19:37,460 --> 02:19:42,460
But the human beings that I've hurt
and killed don't feel anything.

2337
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:43,790
Oh yeah.

2338
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:48,620
So if you can get them being honest
about their absence of empathy,

2339
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:52,190
I don't want to hear that.
I mean, I do what I don't

2340
02:19:53,230 --> 02:19:55,860
do, but I don't want to know.
They're around, man. Yeah.

2341
02:19:55,880 --> 02:20:00,310
Something disturbing about someone
who's just not willing to ever join the

2342
02:20:00,311 --> 02:20:03,760
community. You know, they live
amongst you and they're just trying

2343
02:20:03,850 --> 02:20:05,060
two,
yeah.

2344
02:20:05,360 --> 02:20:09,880
St Montag tray that we see the world
in terms of predators and prey.

2345
02:20:09,881 --> 02:20:13,000
And it would be foolish not to
exploit weaknesses at this, you know?

2346
02:20:13,001 --> 02:20:15,880
I think there really are psychopaths
out there. There was some people. Yeah.

2347
02:20:15,890 --> 02:20:19,090
That's, I think a lot of people
that, the one thing I don't like, uh,

2348
02:20:19,110 --> 02:20:22,650
about this sort of psychopath
spot and world is that they,

2349
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:24,940
they're not interested to a large extent.

2350
02:20:24,941 --> 02:20:27,940
And what turns somebody that way because
they're just really interested in the

2351
02:20:27,941 --> 02:20:30,150
idea that this,
they're just another species out there.

2352
02:20:30,160 --> 02:20:34,270
There's just this other species that
aren't quite human and they're look human.

2353
02:20:34,271 --> 02:20:36,280
But then it's kind of like
David, I can the Lizard, right?

2354
02:20:36,281 --> 02:20:39,190
There's people out there who've adopted
human form, but they're not quite human.

2355
02:20:39,700 --> 02:20:43,360
Um, but, uh, but I'm really interested,

2356
02:20:43,361 --> 02:20:47,620
this is other psychiatrist I met called
James Gilligan who basically says all

2357
02:20:47,621 --> 02:20:52,000
violence is an attempt to
replace shame with self esteem.

2358
02:20:52,330 --> 02:20:56,770
So these people were like so battered,
join their childhood,

2359
02:20:57,130 --> 02:20:58,390
so humiliated,

2360
02:20:58,391 --> 02:21:03,280
so abused that they'd try and regain
some self esteem by committing violence

2361
02:21:03,281 --> 02:21:04,210
onto other people.

2362
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:08,880
Hmm. All violence don't like all. I don't
like statements that are so absolutely,

2363
02:21:08,970 --> 02:21:12,390
it is a big statement, right?
But as a, as a kind of humanist,

2364
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:17,840
I like that because it's giving some
humanity back to violent people.

2365
02:21:18,061 --> 02:21:21,990
It's saying, you know, this is, you
know, it comes from a place of damage.

2366
02:21:22,170 --> 02:21:26,760
Whereas the psychopath spotters will
basically say, no, no, they're just,

2367
02:21:26,880 --> 02:21:30,990
they're like another species. Yeah.
You know what? I think this, honestly,

2368
02:21:30,991 --> 02:21:32,610
I think there's truth in both camps.

2369
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:32,971
Well,

2370
02:21:32,971 --> 02:21:35,970
I think there's certainly some people
that are like that and there's some people

2371
02:21:35,971 --> 02:21:37,500
that are violence just
because they're angry,

2372
02:21:37,501 --> 02:21:40,230
it's stupidity or they're
angry at aggression are there,

2373
02:21:40,231 --> 02:21:42,540
they just need some release
in their life and their,

2374
02:21:42,740 --> 02:21:47,130
their pent down with all sorts of stress
and I can't handle it and they don't

2375
02:21:47,131 --> 02:21:49,590
have an outlet. You know, there's
a lot of people that just,

2376
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:54,360
they're lacking an outlet. And I, I
liken them to overflowing batteries,

2377
02:21:54,690 --> 02:21:59,690
like a battery that like I think of
the human body as your human body is

2378
02:21:59,940 --> 02:22:03,510
designed to exert a certain amount of
effort to put forth a certain amount of

2379
02:22:03,511 --> 02:22:04,530
energy during the day.

2380
02:22:04,830 --> 02:22:09,660
And most people don't even remotely
tap into their reserve of energy.

2381
02:22:09,870 --> 02:22:12,530
They sit down and their body,
you know,

2382
02:22:12,540 --> 02:22:16,380
just conforms to their office chair and
they're there all day and at the end of

2383
02:22:16,380 --> 02:22:19,280
the day they sit in their car or they
sit on the bus or the train and they'd

2384
02:22:19,281 --> 02:22:22,710
make their way home and which case they
sit on a couch and they sit in front of

2385
02:22:22,711 --> 02:22:26,100
the television and their,
their body just has constantly up stress

2386
02:22:26,460 --> 02:22:31,460
and it has this desire to exert energy
and it's never met with what it needs.

2387
02:22:33,241 --> 02:22:36,180
It never, it never has its
needs fulfilled, fulfilled.

2388
02:22:36,300 --> 02:22:38,970
And so then you're in your car and you're
in traffic and someone cuts you off

2389
02:22:38,971 --> 02:22:40,420
and be like,
you fucking pay you cash.

2390
02:22:40,890 --> 02:22:44,330
You have this unbelievably
angry response because your,

2391
02:22:44,331 --> 02:22:48,920
your battery is essentially found there's
an opening, you know, it's like a,

2392
02:22:48,950 --> 02:22:53,280
a hole in a water balloon should
water just start squirting out of it.

2393
02:22:53,281 --> 02:22:57,900
It can't help it. It's like so bent up
with or pent up with pressure. And if you,

2394
02:22:57,901 --> 02:23:01,020
instead of doing that to somebody
in another car, who cotton, hey you,

2395
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:04,860
if you could then go home and he do it
on social media. Everybody haze you,

2396
02:23:04,861 --> 02:23:08,010
including that person, and it can
really damage someone's, well.

2397
02:23:08,011 --> 02:23:11,020
There's certainly you, you keep
coming back to that. It's a,

2398
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:15,310
it's ending because it's drama series
and books. It's on your mind for awhile.

2399
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:18,540
Hey, do monk, do you mind if I go? No,

2400
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:23,580
that's a perfect way to end it. This
is, this was a great conversation.

2401
02:23:23,581 --> 02:23:27,390
I really enjoyed it. I'm so glad that
we did this because as I say, for years,

2402
02:23:27,391 --> 02:23:29,080
people have like, oh my God, you gotta go.

2403
02:23:29,420 --> 02:23:32,240
Well, I think we could have a hundred
of these. I mean, anytime you're back,

2404
02:23:33,590 --> 02:23:37,760
when are you back again? Come
around. La in Naafi citizen. Yeah.

2405
02:23:37,790 --> 02:23:41,630
My son's thinking about moving here,
so if it guys, okay, great. If he does,

2406
02:23:41,631 --> 02:23:44,990
I'm not going to fucking leave.
I can't be undone at the city to my son.

2407
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:49,310
I hear you. Yeah. Okay. We'll beautiful
man. We'll definitely either way,

2408
02:23:49,311 --> 02:23:52,400
one way or another when you're back
in town. Let's do this. Can, I really,

2409
02:23:52,401 --> 02:23:55,340
really enjoyed it. I really didn't.
And so your most recent book is,

2410
02:23:55,341 --> 02:23:59,450
so you've been publicly shamed it and I'm
sure it's available everywhere. Right?

2411
02:23:59,451 --> 02:24:04,160
Like Amazon and all that jazz,
so Barnes and noble,

2412
02:24:04,610 --> 02:24:09,380
all that good stuff. And uh, John Ronson
on Twitter, J o. N a is you're a j.

2413
02:24:09,381 --> 02:24:11,870
O. H. N that's pretending to be
running a bunch of evil shit.

2414
02:24:11,900 --> 02:24:16,100
You're going to get in trouble
for [inaudible] to be me.

2415
02:24:16,310 --> 02:24:17,900
I hope he's not shaming you.

2416
02:24:18,370 --> 02:24:22,740
We've tried other is isn't
really. Yeah. Oh, ah.

2417
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:28,280
Oh yeah, John. So John Ronson, ladies
and gentlemen. Thank you brother.

2418
02:24:28,281 --> 02:24:29,540
I really appreciate Joe's a lot of fun.
