Hello Freak bitches,
uncomfortable for short bursts,

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,950
don't eat so much

3
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,080
exercises.
So everything you just said,

4
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,640
you know,
there was a really interesting study

5
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:12,230
that just came out,
um,

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,210
a couple of weeks ago where they looked
at the rates of aging in young adults.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,540
So they looked at different time points.
So they look at,

8
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,890
they took the,
there was a whole,

9
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,760
I think it was like over a thousand
people and the study started when they

10
00:00:25,761 --> 00:00:30,761
were like 26 years old and they measured
like 18 different biomarkers of aging.

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:36,650
So they looked at like DNA health.
They looked at telomere length.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,460
So tila mirrors are those caps on the
end of your chromosomes that protected

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:41,540
damage.
There are markers for aging.

14
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,410
They looked at hdl cholesterol,
they looked at c reactive protein,

15
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:49,760
which is a inflammatory mediator.
They looked at 18 different things and

16
00:00:49,761 --> 00:00:52,910
they looked at these people that were 26
years old and then it did it again when

17
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:53,900
they were 32.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,520
And then they did it again when there
were 38.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,910
And what they found was that even though
these people were all the same

20
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:02,960
chronological age,
their cells looked very,

21
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:05,030
very,
very different people age at different

22
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:06,560
rates.
Some people,

23
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,820
if you looked on the cellular level,
they look 10 years older and some people

24
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,700
look 10 years younger than their
chronological age.

25
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,340
And I was looking at some of these
graphs of people and you can see some

26
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:20,990
people started out like they started out
bad where they looked old and then they

27
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,130
started getting better.
You know,

28
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:24,080
they probably started changing their
diet,

29
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:26,750
their lifestyle.
Other people started going worse.

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,700
Some people stayed the same,
you know.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,280
So there are lots of different,
very variables going on here.

32
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,530
But I think what's really interesting.
Oh,

33
00:01:33,531 --> 00:01:35,780
and by the way,
that their physical appearance also

34
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:37,730
correlated with not their chronological
age,

35
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,310
but their biological age,
what is,

36
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,183
what it's called.

37
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,740
So if the,
if they showed their picture to people,

38
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,140
random people and said,
guess what age they are,

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,350
they would guess their biological age,
not their chronological age.

40
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:52,370
So if a person was 38 but they look 28,
the person would say,

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,590
Oh,
they're probably 28 and if the person

42
00:01:54,591 --> 00:01:58,330
was 38 but they looked 48,
they just looked worn and you know,

43
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,530
rough.
Then the person would guess that they

44
00:02:00,531 --> 00:02:02,030
were much,
much older than they were.

45
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:06,680
So there was a correlation between
physical appearance and the biological

46
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:08,270
age.
And this is.

47
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,840
I found this really,
really interesting because I think it is

48
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:16,820
strong evidence for the fact that your
diet and your lifestyle play a major

49
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,530
role in the way you age.

50
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,500
You know,
I,

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,770
if I was in the movie world,
I would call somebody,

52
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,500
but Melissa Mccarthy will be the whale.
Oh,

53
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:29,501
how dare you.
And she's the funniest woman around a.

54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,690
she's very funny.
She's very physically funny for sure.

55
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,010
She's a very talented.
Yeah.

56
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,230
It's funny because Billy Gardell is a
funny comic.

57
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,170
You know billy,
right?

58
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,900
Yeah.
They don't like on the show.

59
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:40,640
He's like,
almost like a straight guy.

60
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,910
Of course wouldn't want the husband get
one over on the wife.

61
00:02:43,911 --> 00:02:45,230
What'd you joe?
They don't allow that.

62
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,210
Nicholas,
why is that?

63
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:49,130
What's on?
What's up with that fuck has jerk offs

64
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:52,440
run Hollywood?
Is that what it is?

65
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,240
It is what people want to see.
The people want to see that.

66
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,780
I don't want to see that you don't
fucking.

67
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:59,380
Holly has been hijacked by fucking
feminist.

68
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,310
Wow.
Am I wrong?

69
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,160
If you guys can't relate that I'm
fucking leaving.

70
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,180
Do you ever noticed a pattern of
emasculation and movies and in fact the

71
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,490
last 20 years,
I think there's people that are

72
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,470
seriously concerned with coming off as
progressive and even if they think

73
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,650
differently than what would be the
progressive choice,

74
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,050
they will make the progressive choice
because they get like social brownie

75
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,501
points.
Uh,

76
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,020
definitely think that's true.
But I don't think that pertains to

77
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,420
sitcoms.
I think like,

78
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,080
it's not as funny if the dude gets over
on the CIC for someone to come on.

79
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,680
This is a story.
I might have told you this on the last

80
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,960
time I was here.
I had a deal with a,

81
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,970
this was years ago at Dennis Larry's
company.

82
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,050
And we come out here and take a bunch of
meetings and I felt like they had a

83
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:43,390
sitcom idea.
And at first of all,

84
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,810
every meeting,
75 percent of the room was female

85
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,644
executives.

86
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,770
And of course the first question and
every meeting was,

87
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,050
what's the wife's role?
Every fucking one.

88
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,190
So by the time we got to NBC,
which was the last one and I had fucking

89
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:58,450
had it.
And they're like,

90
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:01,660
so what's the wedge I go.
And again I was just kidding.

91
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,700
But I go,
uh,

92
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,750
I don't know.
I see like in the pilot she's pregnant

93
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:09,751
and I push it down in the cellar stairs
and I'm expecting like Dennis to start

94
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:11,580
laughing and in Serpico Jimmy Syrup
because.

95
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:14,300
And they all just look at me.
You could have fucking her and append.

96
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,180
So the next day,
next day,

97
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:18,880
Jimmy Circle,
we had to send a dozen roses to the lady

98
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:23,140
from NBC.
You wonder why I can't get a Gig.

99
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,620
Thank God you throw me a news radio and
a few grace under fire.
