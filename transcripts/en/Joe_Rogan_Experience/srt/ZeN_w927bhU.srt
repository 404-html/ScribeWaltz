1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,980
And we're live the.off 5,000 fan club boy,

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,060
first big meeting,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,410
cowboy Cerrone,

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:11,550

5
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:13,020
cowboy Oliveira,

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,320
all the Vietnam we are live.

7
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:17,310
This is a fight companion.

8
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,930
If you've never heard one of
these before and you're like,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,111
well,

10
00:00:19,111 --> 00:00:22,680
I'm hoping a podcast are going to talk
about space or maybe perhaps birth

11
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,514
control.

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,060
No.

13
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,301
Uh,

14
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,510
this podcast is mostly
mostly bullshitting.

15
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,600
Like we kind of talk about
the fights that are happening,

16
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,560
but maybe not.

17
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,680
Uh,

18
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,260
edgy is here.

19
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:35,640
Aka Eddie Bravo,

20
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,640
Aka master of 10th planet.

21
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,330
You should choose you sue.

22
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,083
Hello.

23
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:44,683
This is a,

24
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,043
it's an honor to be here.

25
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,840
Ian motherfucking McCall.

26
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,730
Creepy in the house.

27
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:52,160
Hollow that bitches.

28
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,890
Holla.

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,940
I'm covered in fucking hand.

30
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:54,211
Grace.

31
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:54,640
I love it.

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,473
This stuff's good.

33
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,970
Doctor Chris Ryan.

34
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,863
It is nice.

35
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,040
It's really good for you too.

36
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:00,230
So wild.

37
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,260
The Ham that the,

38
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,094
uh,

39
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:02,850
cure it.

40
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,710
And then of course the blend is Shaw.

41
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,903
He's here.

42
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:06,780
Big Daddy.

43
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,613
That's his new name.

44
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,840
Fat Daddy as a few hours
ago from the hospital.

45
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,260
Yeah.

46
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,490
So whereas for some fights,

47
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,043
Derek Brunson,

48
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:17,123
he would go,

49
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,450
who's he fighting tonight

50
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,950
is fighting a homeboy.

51
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,850
The the presumably cat.

52
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:24,691
Oh,

53
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,110
that guy.

54
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,231
Oh,

55
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,650
the one where the nose of the face
there you go on and go narrow.

56
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,041
Oh,

57
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:29,874
he's got Gucci.

58
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,780
It's really good Jujitsu and
he's been around for a long time.

59
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:34,831
Yeah.

60
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,270
It took a long time off the UFC.

61
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:36,600
Right?

62
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,433
You got cut?

63
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:37,641
Yeah,

64
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:38,780
I was going to do second step.

65
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:40,730
Yeah.

66
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,050
He fought Mark Munoz in his last outing.

67
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,850
Him really choke it.

68
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,470
Like Mark Munoz just does
not want to do it anymore.

69
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,281
What are you retired?

70
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:50,371
Yeah,

71
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:51,090
I'm glad he did.

72
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,720
Me Too man.

73
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,550
Like I took some horrible beatings.

74
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,331
Cut Machita one.

75
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:55,164
Really?

76
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,423
The Weidman line.

77
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,263
The Cheetah one?

78
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:57,930
Yeah.

79
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:58,860
Mark's issue was,

80
00:01:58,861 --> 00:01:59,071
you know,

81
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:00,630
mark was the captain of our team.

82
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,463
Mark issue was

83
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:03,930
blue.

84
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,330
I mean,

85
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,410
Nicky beat blew the
fuck up between fights.

86
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,273
He said Pilipino,

87
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,270
I mean we're talking,

88
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,104
he was just,

89
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,340
I mean he fought at one 85 db two 42
50 but not like cool to 40 to 50 years.

90
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,970
Like butter bean.

91
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:18,923
What was he eating?

92
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,093
Everything.

93
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,710
Just feelings as feelings was,

94
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:23,301
did he have a,

95
00:02:23,301 --> 00:02:24,390
he had depression issues,

96
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:24,970
right?

97
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:25,803
It was like,

98
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:26,950
yeah,

99
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,541
like after,

100
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,590
after the Weidman fight,

101
00:02:28,591 --> 00:02:30,630
yet super depression issues and the loss.

102
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,100
Yeah.

103
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,933
Yeah.

104
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,870
I mean the nicest guy in earth.

105
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,540
The last question,

106
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,410
and there's also the Kao Depression.

107
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,280
That's true.

108
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,400
Physical depression and there,

109
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,910
the more they're looking into that shit.

110
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,811
You didn't know that dude.

111
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,770
Dave Mirror just committed suicide.

112
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,720
That BMX guy,

113
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,410
legend.

114
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,730
Sad to kids.

115
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,920
Cause those BMX was get
a ton of concussions,

116
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,191
right.

117
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:52,130
Slamming their head against
the concrete and shareable,

118
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:52,970
horrible.

119
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,430
And they fall from 30 feet up in the
sky and all that momentum just lap.

120
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,733
Hmm.

121
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,010
I've had some friends that

122
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,910
I've watched people or had friends in
all those sports and hurt themselves.

123
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,270
It's,

124
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:04,541
yeah,

125
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,420
they hurt themselves and then
they become a different person.

126
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,321
Totally like they,

127
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,760
their brain gets so scrambled,

128
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,930
they're just not the same again.

129
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,100
They get super depressed.

130
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:12,491
Yeah.

131
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,570
That's a big part of a head trauma is
depression or those guys born without

132
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,260
fear.

133
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,260
What is it like that does do to do
crazy BMX stuff and motocross tricks and

134
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,070
flips and jumps?

135
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,241
You've got,

136
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,210
you can't have any fear.

137
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,670
They think we're fucking crazy.

138
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,750
That's the fucked up part.

139
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:28,901
I've,

140
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,890
I've spent my whole life knowing
a lot of these kids and uh,

141
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,581
one of my buddies,

142
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:33,731
you know,

143
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,210
same as me,

144
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:34,631
has a couple,

145
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:34,780
you know,

146
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,690
does it a couple of kids,

147
00:03:35,691 --> 00:03:37,660
his wife and one,

148
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,370
a couple of axioms gold
medals and he's like,

149
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,300
well how do you do that?

150
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,010
It's like such a nice guy.

151
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,611
He's this tiny,

152
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:43,201
frail kind of,

153
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:43,631
not frail,

154
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,860
but he's whips and bike around,

155
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,790
but he's just smaller and he's like,

156
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
how do you do that?

157
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,290
You know,

158
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,123
hurt somebody.

159
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,510
I'm gonna fucking hurt yourself man.

160
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:49,991
You've got kids.

161
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:50,824
And I'm like a year.

162
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,150
I saw you this morning.

163
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:53,260
50 feet above the ground.

164
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,940
Upside down with the fucking
motorcycle it though.

165
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,260
Fuck you talking about.

166
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,490
Those dudes are nuts.

167
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,830
What do you mean everybody's
got their own idea of like,

168
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:00,641
what's scary though?

169
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,980
It's weird for some people,

170
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,560
the scariest thing in the
world is public speaking.

171
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:06,040
Now,

172
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,280
true in this doing this
would be terrifying,

173
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,720
but to us this is,

174
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,100
was this like a hangout?

175
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,353
Love it.

176
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,920
We have to remind ourselves,

177
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:18,400
what do we have your headphones
on and that we're on?

178
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:18,920
No,

179
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,753
see often,

180
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,070
but like to me,

181
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,240
the idea of jumping,

182
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:24,340
flipping through the air and a motorcycle.

183
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,170
Fuck all that.

184
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,460
Skydiving is fun though.

185
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,330
Don't fucking fuck.

186
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,540
See,

187
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,373
I would never date.

188
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,790
I did a lot of stupid sports.

189
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,340
I put myself in the hospital snowboarding.

190
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,750
Like I was tiny.

191
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,430
But I've been good at just
about everything I've done.

192
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,713
And uh,

193
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,081
yeah,

194
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:39,070
I think I'm done skiing,

195
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:39,760
man.

196
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,593
I haven't done it in awhile.

197
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,280
I went skiing last week and did
you really fucking one wipe whore?

198
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,981
She wants no boom,

199
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:49,451
no skiing.

200
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:50,284
I like scan,

201
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,010
but um,

202
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,341
it's not,

203
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,210
it's not the problem.

204
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,200
The problem is just,

205
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,000
there's a lot of people
on the fucking mountain.

206
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,860
You're coming down to an hour.

207
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,310
Where'd you get all these people?

208
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:57,760
Um,

209
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,330
Park City,

210
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,020
Utah.

211
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,860
I love it there.

212
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,753
I love it.

213
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,960
It's so when you're coming down,

214
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,040
oh God does.

215
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,010
When you get the wrong as fuck,

216
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,310
but you coming down the
mountain and you like,

217
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:06,881
don't get hurt.

218
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:07,421
Don't get hurt,

219
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,020
don't get hurt.

220
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,690
Don't get hurt.

221
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,311
Oh,

222
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:09,970
I didn't get hurt.

223
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,570
Let's try it again.

224
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:11,081
Don't get hurt.

225
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:11,651
Don't get hurt.

226
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:12,484
Don't get hurt.

227
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,620
So there's always people
that are zipping and zagging.

228
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,350
There's people way better than you and
the people that suck more worse than you.

229
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,220
And you know you're managing all
this stuff as you're going down.

230
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,840
There's so many people
on the mountain man,

231
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:24,790
because it was I guess
president's Day weekend.

232
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,660
What was the last weekend
that the president's space,

233
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,270
so it was super crowded.

234
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,940
Do you fall multiple times every run?

235
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,720
No,

236
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,760
I felt three times in two days,

237
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,370
but that's one good one was hard.

238
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,300
I grew up doing it,

239
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:37,541
man.

240
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:38,410
Fuck that noise.

241
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,770
I'm going it with valves to man scheme,

242
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,170
skiing,

243
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:42,880
snowboarding,

244
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,713
snowboarding.

245
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,710
I want to,

246
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to go before the snow melts.

247
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,200
I couldn't pay me enough to do it,

248
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:47,380
dude.

249
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,213
I'm an asshole.

250
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,331
Well I try.

251
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,100
I try and do things I used to
do when I was in high school.

252
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,221
Like,

253
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:51,371
Oh,

254
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:51,581
I'm like,

255
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,820
I can rodeo that or I can frontside five
that or do something over this jump and

256
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:56,530
then I end up under
these terms you're using,

257
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,980
doing and spins and you

258
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
do a Rodeo.

259
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,080
You flip in the air.

260
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,740
I've been a fucking smile.

261
00:06:01,741 --> 00:06:02,001
I am.

262
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,470
I can flip over anything cause
you flipped to in snowboarding.

263
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,943
Oh my God,

264
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:06,770
that's crazy.

265
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,460
Hit your face.

266
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:08,500
You're one of those guys.

267
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,160
But I was never that good.

268
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,880
I would just try that.

269
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,730
So my brother on the other
hand was really good and then,

270
00:06:13,731 --> 00:06:16,430
but of course he blew out his
knee twice to collar bone breaks.

271
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,601
Call the bronze,

272
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:18,680
always gone when you,

273
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,720
when you landed wrong and
you'd landed face down.

274
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,880
That's how I brought mine
with guys friends that are,

275
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,230
that are crazy like that.

276
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,970
I would just slide down the mountain.

277
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,930
I have no Carbone is one of those moves
that assholes think they could end a

278
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:30,764
fight with.

279
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,720
Like Jesse James was on Howard Stern.

280
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:34,790
He was talking about street
fighting and he was like,

281
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,410
dude,

282
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,830
I just hit people in the collarbone.

283
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,440
Ah Fuck you.

284
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,813
Fuck you

285
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:42,990
come here.

286
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,740
You get close with my collar on it.

287
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,310
You have to do.

288
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,143
Is this

289
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,393
working?

290
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:51,770
Maybe it's,

291
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,230
what's your first seven

292
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,480
get close enough and you're
like crap in your hand.

293
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,740
Believe like you don't want
to fight and you're like,

294
00:07:00,741 --> 00:07:01,041
dude,

295
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:01,874
let's just talk this out,

296
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,460
but you're not a straight punch.

297
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,760
The collarbone ain't doing Jack
Shit is not doing Jack Shit.

298
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,623
The sternum

299
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,113
so big.

300
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,340
Let's say his big ass
guy punches like a bitch.

301
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,050
Garen Sternum from downtown.

302
00:07:24,051 --> 00:07:27,110
If you're standing there waiting for
stop saying you're talking to a girl and

303
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:27,650
he's like,

304
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,910
hey boom.

305
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,371
His buddies,

306
00:07:29,371 --> 00:07:29,890
his tracks,

307
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,520
what comes up and he called talk.

308
00:07:31,521 --> 00:07:32,390
Tough guy stuff.

309
00:07:32,391 --> 00:07:33,021
When they say like,

310
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:35,500
I'll hate a guy in the
sternum or I'll hit the guy,

311
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:38,630
the guy in the collar bone like just
stop talking about Steven Seagal.

312
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,464
One old one.

313
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,670
That's what you're talking about something
generally people say his life with

314
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,590
Eddie Bravo and I had the worst guy ever.

315
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,170
There was a guy who told us he
would grabbed your thumbnail.

316
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
He would pinch down.

317
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:49,811
You're thrown out.

318
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:50,644
Do you remember that?

319
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,771
Remember that guy,

320
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:53,320
Vinny from the comedy store number,

321
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:53,471
the,

322
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,750
the fake Jujitsu or however,

323
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:55,551
remember that guy?

324
00:07:55,551 --> 00:07:55,760
Yeah.

325
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,700
He would grab your thumb and
press down your thumbnail.

326
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,540
He was convinced that he,

327
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,430
I'll just grab you.

328
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,440
I'll grab you like this and I'll,

329
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:04,710
there's a pressure point in the
tip of your tongue and your tip,

330
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,091
your thumb.

331
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:05,930
It's intolerable.

332
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,240
Pain is intolerable and I'm like,

333
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:12,410
this motherfucker like you
just want to hit him with it.

334
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:13,761
He grabbed,

335
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,950
he grabbed my thumb up my deck.

336
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:16,784
Let me show you,

337
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,550
but it doesn't hurt me.

338
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,260
It hurts.

339
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,250
It doesn't feel good,

340
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,080
but it doesn't even make you scream.

341
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,250
It doesn't even make sense.

342
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,120
It doesn't make any sense.

343
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:23,750
First of all,

344
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,980
good luck holding it onto it.

345
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,590
It's just a tip of your thumb.

346
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,310
And if I'm that guy and
I'm selling that lie,

347
00:08:28,311 --> 00:08:28,701
whatever,

348
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:31,700
to chicks or wherever to get
laid and Joe Rogan comes around,

349
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,110
I'm not saying shit.

350
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:34,873
Meanwhile,

351
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,800
suck your thumbs before you fight.

352
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,160
Slippery lube up your thumbs.

353
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,740
Just stop.

354
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,930
Is this James Kraus?

355
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,680
Oh yeah,

356
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,513
he's good.

357
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,453
I liked that guy.

358
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:48,610
Okay.

359
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,600
Fun fights tonight.

360
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,493
Who's he's fighting?

361
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
Shane Campbell.

362
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,753
Is that who was fine?

363
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,103
Yeah.

364
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,380
The final one to see
most with that was that,

365
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,273
uh,

366
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,361
what's his name?

367
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:02,250
Cody and a that linker.

368
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:02,780
Oh,

369
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,680
Linacre yes.

370
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,880
That was the clinic or pulled out yet?

371
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,850
Sick Brazilian.

372
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,610
What's it called?

373
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:08,731
Oh,

374
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,151
wait a minute.

375
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:09,480
Wait a minute.

376
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,380
We got to cross the line.

377
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,333
You got Zika?

378
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,543
No,

379
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,031
no,

380
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:13,591
not Zika.

381
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:14,424
What is it?

382
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:15,751
Nope,

383
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:17,230
not Miliary something like aids.

384
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,203
Nope.

385
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,760
Gonorrhea man.

386
00:09:19,761 --> 00:09:20,594
That would be cool.

387
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,880
Uh,

388
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,960
leprosy now allow you to fight
with herpes and believe me.

389
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,243
Okay,

390
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,950
Jess Kid wink.

391
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,730
Um,

392
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:32,911
yeah,

393
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:33,350
he got it.

394
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,840
It was gone.

395
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,280
You get it from mosquitoes out there,

396
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,090
but you know what?

397
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,860
He's fucking the guy who
stepped up in his place,

398
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:38,440
his tank,

399
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,930
a Gusto Mendez.

400
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:43,800
Tackiness that guy beat half a
Mendez to win the world championship.

401
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,530
So the Guy Tacchini I was
fighting fucking tonight.

402
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,760
Cody hits like a tank.

403
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:47,940
Dot.

404
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,330
Yeah.

405
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:48,510
Yeah.

406
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,200
And He's first team.

407
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,200
All cute guy would know Jujitsu and all
of a sudden he's got a guy who's one of

408
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:55,944
the best Jujitsu

409
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:02,620
big John Tacchino is a fucking tank space.

410
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,010
He's not like a regular Jiu Jitsu guy.

411
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,910
This guy is,

412
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:09,340
he's known for his ultimate
balance and base like you,

413
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,800
he's going to be on top of your head.

414
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:11,221
That sucks.

415
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:11,960
Or Cody,

416
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,360
this is hard,

417
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,700
but by son,

418
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,380
I don't know anything
about promising career.

419
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,830
Check your shit about his strength.

420
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,780
His striking could be carbon.

421
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,330
I don't know.

422
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,991
I had no idea.

423
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,220
But man,

424
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,530
when you can wrestle to
wrestled d one or no,

425
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,210
no,

426
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,043
just a,

427
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:30,450
I hate saying this shit cause I played
basketball in high school so I never

428
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,440
called myself a basketball player,

429
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,270
but he wrestled in high school.

430
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:34,110
He's really good.

431
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,190
And they took a,

432
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:40,191
he had all these PR boxing fights and
kickbox and amateur MMA and Casey suck.

433
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,170
He's good man.

434
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,003
How are you hands?

435
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,070
Extra little factor.

436
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,400
Keanio used to date Mackenzie dern.

437
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,410
So I'm not mad at her at all during
Mackenzie that she's a Jujitsu girl,

438
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:53,340
right?

439
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:53,491
Yeah,

440
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:57,090
she's the best Jujitsu girl on the planet
and she shot by far the hottest girl

441
00:10:57,091 --> 00:10:57,511
to ever.

442
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:58,344
Grace of GE.

443
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,400
Uh,

444
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,091
I dunno Kira.

445
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:00,830
Gracie.

446
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,291
It's pretty good.

447
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:02,010
Then I take,

448
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,970
she's really hot.

449
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,530
I take my kid from bodies.

450
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,880
Then you got to do all the Gracies.

451
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:06,714
If you date her,

452
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,250
that's even better.

453
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,611
It's tough man.

454
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:11,720
It's a lot of pressure functions.

455
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,421
Emily,

456
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,020
Brenda do the Gracie Diet
and shit all the time.

457
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,740
Only Waterman and by a sale.

458
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,750
Speaking of the Gracies been
a mad props to hoists Gracie,

459
00:11:22,021 --> 00:11:24,210
even though there was some crazy thing,

460
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:29,100
you know with Ken shamrock hoist went out
there and did what he does and he does

461
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,080
need guys to the balls.

462
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,110
Come on.

463
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,461
That was it.

464
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:32,020
That was,

465
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,110
was that really what you can say?

466
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,430
Did what he does?

467
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,300
I told him down and beat
the shit out of camera.

468
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:39,660
Just wears six straight
strikes to the face.

469
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,650
Six solid saying that
cause he doesn't like

470
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,570
trying to win them back.

471
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,410
Please love me.

472
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,090
Yeah.

473
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,923
Maybe

474
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:54,180
he showed some series k
one or k three striking

475
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,420
stay for maybe a k five k
you're saying is working.

476
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
His was all right.

477
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,170
I thought Ken was like really hesitant.

478
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:03,010
Stand on the outside.

479
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,600
I thought Kevin Hall light him up.

480
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,820
But I'm saying Ken compared to voices,

481
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,110
what were horse wasn't doing much.

482
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,700
There's no threat to his striking.

483
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:13,240
So I was like super surprised that Ken
wasn't lighten them up because if you go

484
00:12:13,241 --> 00:12:15,520
back to like Ken that fought Fujita,

485
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,880
Ken had some fucking legit leg go.

486
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,123
Good power.

487
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,070
Yeah.

488
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,730
He 25 years ago,

489
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,260
he's not cripple.

490
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,470
I mean w were,

491
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,510
where did the body go?

492
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:26,830
He's got to have that power.

493
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,990
He's got to have that
ability at the same joints.

494
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:30,190
My man maybe,

495
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,930
I mean I don't know what's
going on with his body,

496
00:12:31,931 --> 00:12:35,050
but I would've thought Ken would have
fucked his legs up if I was in Cannes

497
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:35,351
corner.

498
00:12:35,351 --> 00:12:37,360
I would say you're going to
kick the shit out of this.

499
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:37,970
Greg's,

500
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,410
you're going to,

501
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:38,801
he's not,

502
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,210
he's no threat with punches.

503
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,790
It's not like he's going to drop
you with one straight right hand.

504
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,150
Right.

505
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,110
So what you do is you like Paul with the
hands and you come in and you throw a

506
00:12:47,111 --> 00:12:48,430
bomb leg kicks,

507
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,200
Dang gates and gay fever.

508
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,093
That's no joke.

509
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,731
Not Fun.

510
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,900
That kills motherfuckers.

511
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,710
Yeah.

512
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,100
I really thought I would have thought
Ken would have just let those legs on

513
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:57,670
fire.

514
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,150
But at the same time he had voices,

515
00:12:59,270 --> 00:12:59,620
voices,

516
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,580
chance was on the ground.

517
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:01,560
He didn't want to get taken care of.

518
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:02,394
It didn't get were too,

519
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:02,610
right.

520
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,341
You got that too.

521
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:04,174
He might've got everything.

522
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,100
Justin Brown,

523
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,450
what was his number one guy down
that would make you hesitant?

524
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,181
Throwing leg kicks,

525
00:13:10,181 --> 00:13:10,391
right.

526
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:10,640
One.

527
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,410
Not if you're Ken shamrock with his
wrestling background and his striking fuck

528
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,720
it take down from holy space.

529
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,530
He's not like a d one wrestler.

530
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,120
Coaches up and trips.

531
00:13:19,121 --> 00:13:20,530
He clenches up and trips.

532
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,700
If he knows how to do that.

533
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,270
Oh look at this James Crouse.

534
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,750
I see a bright man buddy.

535
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,600
Snug is fun.

536
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,120
Ooh,

537
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,140
that's a taboo.

538
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,471
Does it?

539
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,130
A tap words?

540
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,401
Nope.

541
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,290
Was it around?

542
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:31,990
Yep.

543
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,823
It was a man.

544
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,880
Um,

545
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,530
has there ever been a bigger
shit show than up bell towards,

546
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,780
but I think it put our
sport back seven years in.

547
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,300
Nah,

548
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,950
just put bell tour back the end of
the three agents now and go belt door.

549
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,770
Fuck man.

550
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,460
Fuck that.

551
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,500
How about data went to the hospital?

552
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:47,760
Yeah.

553
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,593
His heart stopped.

554
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,920
It was filled with cheeseburgers
and fried chicken and orange soda.

555
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,140
Is there any way you could
have trained for that pipe?

556
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,700
They're trying anyway.

557
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,121
There's no way.

558
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:58,360
Train.

559
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,690
No,

560
00:13:58,690 --> 00:13:59,050
no way.

561
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,630
He thought he was just hugging me
and my train for a couple of days.

562
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,580
They said he lost 40 pounds.

563
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,780
Well that sound good.

564
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,280
You should have lost 40 pounds before.

565
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,630
They do not like you didn't know.

566
00:14:07,631 --> 00:14:08,890
You don't know the backyards.

567
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,820
Well how about Kimbo?

568
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:11,050
What the fuck was going on with him?

569
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,113
Yeah,

570
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,073
that was,

571
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,600
that wasn't even an amateur
hours cause you really,

572
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,460
if it's an amateur fight,

573
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,370
like you'd be like chomping at
the bit to get at those guys.

574
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,780
But I hope they're in my bracket.

575
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,210
All you have to do is dance
around for a few minutes.

576
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,110
These guys are toast.

577
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,020
A low level college wrestler.

578
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,930
What a fuck those dudes.

579
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,280
Well,

580
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,370
how about this von Exchange Exchange?

581
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,220
How the one exchange where Donna just
sort of laid down and Kimble just rolled

582
00:14:36,221 --> 00:14:37,120
over on top of him.

583
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,670
He just laid down.

584
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,610
It hurt my soul.

585
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,100
They just hurt my soul.

586
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,010
No take down.

587
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,320
It was like just take
district of ground like,

588
00:14:44,321 --> 00:14:45,670
oh I wonder if they're
talking to each other.

589
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,810
We won't take you to the ground home cause
it's a chill dogs is officially do we

590
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:51,290
call it the children children.

591
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,490
How about Kimbo in mountain dew?

592
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,353
I felt like

593
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,371
I got done.

594
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:58,820
I was like,

595
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,800
Oh ours early in the first round though.

596
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:01,820
It didn't look so bad.

597
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,803
I was like,

598
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,210
legs Kimbos got some ground skills,

599
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,571
you know.

600
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:05,930
I'm like,

601
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,471
I thought,

602
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:07,880
okay this guy's getting get fucked up.

603
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,350
Kim is going to pound them out.

604
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,210
But zero gas.

605
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,470
Have you seen the documentary?

606
00:15:12,471 --> 00:15:13,770
That data comes from dot.

607
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
Corbin's Billy Corgan.

608
00:15:16,061 --> 00:15:16,271
Yeah.

609
00:15:16,271 --> 00:15:16,851
It's amazing.

610
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,720
He's the best you had him on.

611
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,590
You probably have my bucks.

612
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,581
Billy's Craig Bill.

613
00:15:19,581 --> 00:15:20,210
He's great.

614
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:20,910
He's great.

615
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,170
Cocaine cowboys and D.

616
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,003
Yep.

617
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,173
Yes,

618
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:25,910
yes.

619
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,743
He's great.

620
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,590
Billy's awesome.

621
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,221
That's where I was like,

622
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:28,461
damn,

623
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,420
Donna has some hands,

624
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:29,541
man.

625
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,500
This guy is kind of cool.

626
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:31,970
Kind of cool.

627
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,900
He's got some hands.

628
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,560
Yeah.

629
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,550
I mean he was fighting,

630
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,950
but that's the thing about can crushers.

631
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:38,690
You look awesome.

632
00:15:38,691 --> 00:15:39,261
If you're fighting,

633
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:40,180
nobody would,

634
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,490
you know.

635
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,410
But he's two and note.

636
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,970
Then he said he come from fighting
on the back streets of Miami.

637
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,330
Right,

638
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,200
and then you're fucking launched and
Dibella don't know he that he's two and,

639
00:15:47,201 --> 00:15:47,281
oh,

640
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:48,710
and I think his last opponent,

641
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,310
whoever was talking about it
on the pod on the broadcast,

642
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,950
was talking about the
record of his last opponent.

643
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:55,611
It was like,

644
00:15:55,611 --> 00:15:56,000
you know,

645
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,561
Oh and sick.

646
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:57,680
I was like a midget fight.

647
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:58,161
You know what I mean?

648
00:15:58,161 --> 00:15:58,994
It's like,

649
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,260
you know what that
showed that showed maybe,

650
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,330
maybe Bella torque just was a little too
eager to try to do things that the UFC

651
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:10,550
wasn't willing to do.

652
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:10,791
Well,

653
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:10,940
no,

654
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,610
but it's the pride thing.

655
00:16:13,611 --> 00:16:14,141
You know what I mean?

656
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:14,850
And you come out,

657
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,170
ah,

658
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,270
you have Tyson commentating
and he's drunk.

659
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:18,463
All the stuff,

660
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,250
all the stuff the UFC wouldn't do
belters like we're going to do it.

661
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:22,920
You do that.

662
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,960
You think Tyson was drunk?

663
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,280
He was on something.

664
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,560
He was on some pills
and he was on some shit.

665
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:30,200
I think he might've been on a whole
career of getting punched in the head.

666
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,131
You think up to,

667
00:16:31,131 --> 00:16:32,390
hopefully when I have brain trauma,

668
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,290
like that catches up.

669
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:33,711
I hope.

670
00:16:33,711 --> 00:16:34,251
I'm like that.

671
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,084
He was funny.

672
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:38,180
Mike Tyson commentating is hilarious.

673
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:38,930
It was funny.

674
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:39,763
Yeah,

675
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,410
totally for that.

676
00:16:42,411 --> 00:16:43,880
When Melvin Gallard got knocked out,

677
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:44,151
he was like,

678
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:47,930
which radiated ego is ruthless,

679
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,720
ruthless mock Hindus getting teed off on.

680
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:51,651
He's like,

681
00:16:51,651 --> 00:16:52,880
look where you're going to be eventually.

682
00:16:52,881 --> 00:16:53,714
Look at me,

683
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,100
Justin.

684
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,990
The grand scheme of
things like Bella tore it.

685
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,160
They signed Ben Henderson,

686
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,540
who's a fucking monster that's,

687
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,060
can you want to get all
these other guys come over?

688
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:02,221
Yeah,

689
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:02,781
I'm Phil Davis,

690
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:03,920
so they're making momentum.

691
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,360
Then you put that product out.

692
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,230
If I'm a free agent,

693
00:17:06,231 --> 00:17:06,530
I'm like,

694
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,161
fuck man,

695
00:17:07,161 --> 00:17:08,200
I don't want to play him.

696
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:11,060
I think they eventually got
to let all that stuff go.

697
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:12,200
They can't keep doing those.

698
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,203
I couldn't stop.

699
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,240
This is the last one.

700
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,580
It stopped the sale chat
because if they keep doing it,

701
00:17:16,581 --> 00:17:17,900
they're going to really lose credibility.

702
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,790
There's a lot of things they need to do.

703
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,451
That name,

704
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,750
they're sticking with that stupid
fucking name and they're calling it Bella

705
00:17:22,751 --> 00:17:23,960
toward kickboxing to,

706
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,381
hey man,

707
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:25,214
let's not do that.

708
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:26,300
Bell Tours,

709
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,100
a dumb name.

710
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,860
Who's this?

711
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,940
Nobody understands it.

712
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:29,841
Well,

713
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,080
you,

714
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,610
you're rest assured you're,

715
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,570
you're absolutely only going to get
people that are fans of tour already.

716
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,340
They're going to take it
seriously and look for it.

717
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:40,280
Like people that are flipping through
the channels when they see Bella tour

718
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:41,090
live,

719
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,923
what does that mean?

720
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:42,891
What does that mean?

721
00:17:42,891 --> 00:17:43,724
That doesn't mean anything.

722
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,980
But if you have MMA like
old crowd Skout it again.

723
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,610
Damn.

724
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,730
This dude knows how to
turn away from chokes.

725
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:49,320
He's Nastic,

726
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,153
you know,

727
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,510
but um,

728
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,350
crosses all over him

729
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,703
surviving.

730
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,580
But I'm just thinking if they just,

731
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,790
if they just turn talked
it turned it into MMA.

732
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,650
Uli has cross hits,

733
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,270
a armbar crosses fucking
ferocious on the ground.

734
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,500
And I saw this dude's got his back.

735
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,350
Now if they just turned it into MMA,

736
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,980
everybody knows what MMA is,

737
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,550
man.

738
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:10,860
Yeah,

739
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,810
but it's valid towards a dumb name.

740
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,050
It's like matters.

741
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,360
I disagree.

742
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:15,990
Pride.

743
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,171
Yeah.

744
00:18:16,171 --> 00:18:17,620
Rise and didn't mean shit.

745
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,070
Use tools.

746
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,960
Rising tide doing Eddie how's rising?

747
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,380
Implied because of their name.

748
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:23,020
They failed.

749
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,990
It has nothing to do
with these details by man

750
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,243
damn name.

751
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,790
I thought it was cause of the Yakuza.

752
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,020
But do you pay attention to sneaky shit
that the fucking athletic commission

753
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:34,590
did?

754
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,020
Manderlay sneaky ass shit they gave,

755
00:18:37,021 --> 00:18:40,530
they randomly signs of fight
with fade or the UFC let some go.

756
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,130
Okay,

757
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,870
so Vandelay finally can make some money.

758
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,400
The dude hasn't been
able to make any money.

759
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:45,540
So I was in over a year,

760
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,010
I think it's like 17 months.

761
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,180
He hadn't been able to make a dime.

762
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:48,840
Right.

763
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,700
So He's struggling and um,

764
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:50,980
the,

765
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,250
the,

766
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,370
the athletic commission
totally did them dirty.

767
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,080
They suspend him for his entire career.

768
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,330
The judge overrules it says that,

769
00:18:57,331 --> 00:18:58,350
that you can't do that.

770
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:00,150
You can't just suspend the guy forever.

771
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:00,440
Okay.

772
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,940
You can't just deny him
a right to make a living.

773
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:07,740
So Vandelay gets released
when the EOC signs to fight,

774
00:19:07,741 --> 00:19:08,970
fade or in rising.

775
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,760
It's a big payday for watch that
finally he's going to get some money.

776
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,560
You know what the
Athletic Commission does,

777
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,570
they fucking suspend them for three years.

778
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:16,381
So they,

779
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:16,770
they,

780
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:17,370
they,

781
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:17,821
they say,

782
00:19:17,821 --> 00:19:18,151
okay,

783
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:22,830
we are going to change your suspension
from a lifetime band three years.

784
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,060
So it's retroactive.

785
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,160
So he still has a year and a half to go.

786
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,200
So he can't take this flight,

787
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:28,770
but rising thing where Japan,

788
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,830
it doesn't matter why it goes
over there and takes that fight.

789
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,540
They'll view it as a violation.

790
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:34,960
He won't be able to fight
in the United States.

791
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,813
Fuck it,

792
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,653
but doesn't stay.

793
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,510
He'll never be able to
fight in the United States.

794
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,910
So he stockholders and fuck.

795
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:41,803
But he just said,

796
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,090
here's why you shouldn't Beltour tour.

797
00:19:45,091 --> 00:19:47,190
Probably pay him some
serious fucking money.

798
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,920
Serious fuck will be in a year and a half.

799
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,101
Yeah,

800
00:19:50,101 --> 00:19:52,940
but he's not yelling at national then,

801
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,850
but what's going on?

802
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,121
Yeah,

803
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:57,840
but rising ain't going to be around
sun rise and doesn't have much time.

804
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,591
And what is he going to do?

805
00:19:58,591 --> 00:19:59,970
He's going to fight for one FC.

806
00:19:59,971 --> 00:20:01,080
No one watches that.

807
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,510
You Know Ben aspirins
been whooping Chinese.

808
00:20:03,511 --> 00:20:07,320
Dude's ass was over there for a year and
a half and one see shit and can't get a

809
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,680
fucking right up on it.

810
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,470
When he talks about it is amazing.

811
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,840
Ragdoll and beating the fuck out of dudes.

812
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:13,530
And I liked the,

813
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:15,360
they allow him to use
his knees on the ground,

814
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,420
knees on the ground rising.

815
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,880
He's fighting rising to
his last fight was rising,

816
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,050
but for that was what?

817
00:20:22,051 --> 00:20:22,884
FC Right.

818
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,290
Aoki.

819
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,140
He's fighting chrome fund one FC too.

820
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,380
I think it's first fight was one of safe.

821
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,090
I'm pretty sure I was in Asia.

822
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,750
Maybe.

823
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,230
Maybe it first fight was his
last fight was rising but if I'm,

824
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,710
I'm a wanderly 100 bro.

825
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,770
What are you going to wait around?

826
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,400
I don't know.

827
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,130
The fight in the states thing gets dirty
with the athletic commission did that

828
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,400
they,

829
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,270
they fucked up.

830
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,520
Suspended him right before,

831
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,230
right after he takes his fight.

832
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,400
So by violating it,

833
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,750
essentially they're playing little
games cause by him violating that they,

834
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,840
they're really like,

835
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,703
they get what they want.

836
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,590
They get what they want.

837
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,520
The waterlase Baker over there?

838
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:57,851
Yeah.

839
00:20:57,851 --> 00:20:59,710
But he all they had to do like how,

840
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,570
how many months away is that fight?

841
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,130
Like it's in August,

842
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:03,490
right?

843
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:04,060
Correct.

844
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,040
So march,

845
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,371
April,

846
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:07,570
May,

847
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:07,570
June,

848
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:07,570
July,

849
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:07,720
August.

850
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,160
If they just gave him two years,

851
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,150
they gave him two years,

852
00:21:10,151 --> 00:21:10,984
he would have been out.

853
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,240
He would have been done
at the end of July.

854
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,270
He would have been able to fight and
they given an extra year so he's fucked.

855
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,440
You know what man?

856
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,260
Two years is what you're supposed to get
because that's what you would've got if

857
00:21:20,261 --> 00:21:21,250
he tested positive.

858
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:21,491
Correct.

859
00:21:21,491 --> 00:21:23,080
That's what any relation did.

860
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,920
He ran,

861
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,150
let's pretend he was positive.

862
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,480
Pretend he was positive.

863
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,311
Then he's two years.

864
00:21:27,311 --> 00:21:28,090
He's the spine them.

865
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,510
You find them for whatever and you let
the guy have a God damn fucking career.

866
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,081
This is a,

867
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:36,460
this is a game that I think
it's a game of three years.

868
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,180
Pr.

869
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,013
First of all,

870
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,450
why is it three years when
he didn't test positive?

871
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:41,171
If it's two years,

872
00:21:41,171 --> 00:21:42,130
if he did test positive,

873
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,210
that doesn't make any sense.

874
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,680
No two years is the right amount.

875
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,270
If a guy runs from a test,

876
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,410
assume he's positive,

877
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,060
he's definitely shooting around.

878
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,590
He definitely should be panelized.

879
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:54,190
Every fighter who runs from a test
should be penalized as if they tested

880
00:21:54,191 --> 00:21:54,760
positive.

881
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,750
So if that's the case,

882
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,651
why three years,

883
00:21:56,651 --> 00:21:59,350
why not to did over him from a test?

884
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:00,303
No,

885
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,353
he does know.

886
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,490
He tested positive
horsemeat horseman and all.

887
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:09,491
I did a German voice but some
mustache to back the Belko.

888
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,290
How about your boy?

889
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:13,300
Justin wren wants to fight Kimbo slice.

890
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,050
Kimbo slice to go night
night cause Justin Wren,

891
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,700
you can hit that dude
in the head with a rock.

892
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,451
I think he's,

893
00:22:19,451 --> 00:22:20,051
I think a real,

894
00:22:20,051 --> 00:22:21,310
I don't think Justin knocked him out.

895
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,490
I think Justin takes them down
and beats the shit out here.

896
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:24,850
Then you piece of shit out of him.

897
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,140
He takes him down if he wants to.

898
00:22:26,141 --> 00:22:27,040
But if you standing with them,

899
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,360
all he has to do is keep moving.

900
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:29,140
But you know Justin,

901
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,240
the reason Justin wants to,

902
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,310
cause it's such a big fight so he
can build wells and fucking Africa.

903
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:35,050
That's why he was such a mainstream fight.

904
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,220
He's dancing another dude.

905
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:36,480
He's like,

906
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,420
it's why he deserves it too.

907
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,120
He's just it.

908
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,420
He's awesome and he felt,

909
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,911
or smart.

910
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:41,050
They should do it to get short,

911
00:22:41,051 --> 00:22:42,190
especially Kimball's last fight.

912
00:22:42,191 --> 00:22:43,330
Let's figure this out.

913
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:43,990
And you know,

914
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,070
not be as long as fine.

915
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:45,790
Well No,

916
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,640
I'm just saying it
should be his last fight.

917
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,413
It's whatever.

918
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:54,370
You know Justin and Kimbo or Swiss fine
on the ultimate fighter 10 it was lined

919
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:56,320
up and then the suits came in.

920
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:58,000
They were supposed to fight the week up.

921
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:58,511
The fight,

922
00:22:58,511 --> 00:22:59,410
the suits came in like,

923
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,640
uh hey Justin.

924
00:23:00,641 --> 00:23:03,340
They sat Justin down like for ratings,

925
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:03,911
we got to do this.

926
00:23:03,911 --> 00:23:05,070
And then they put in,

927
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,520
then they put in Roy Nelson.

928
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,670
Well that's even dumber because Roy
Nelson is very fucking skill to know they

929
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:13,763
want to pay them.

930
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,250
I mean it's really Nelson.

931
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:15,830
Yeah,

932
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,500
but nobody know who Roy was back 10.

933
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,220
Oh Man.

934
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,640
Roy's,

935
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:18,911
I mean,

936
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:19,900
he's pretty big.

937
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:20,530
I think they,

938
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:22,570
I don't think they
wanted Kimbo to do wells.

939
00:23:22,571 --> 00:23:23,290
What I'm trying to tell him,

940
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,410
oh,

941
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:26,770
like the UFC did was they knew he was
going to lose because to be honest,

942
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:30,730
anyone with a good set of skills during
the beat Kimbo so whoever got that first

943
00:23:30,731 --> 00:23:31,480
crack at him,

944
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,740
he was probably gonna get fucked up.

945
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:33,820
So he fought Justin.

946
00:23:33,821 --> 00:23:34,151
Justin,

947
00:23:34,151 --> 00:23:36,220
you'd be and become a star Roy,

948
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,010
you know?

949
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:37,420
Yeah.

950
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,620
So it's a big fight.

951
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,550
They didn't want him to do well.

952
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,470
Roy was by far the worst matchup.

953
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,560
Justin was supposed to find him.

954
00:23:42,561 --> 00:23:43,690
The coach had all matched up.

955
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,710
They Yanked Justin,

956
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,610
insert fucking Roy Nelson

957
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,450
with 30 fights.

958
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:48,320
Enjoy joy that Kimbo.

959
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:48,580
Yeah,

960
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,120
enjoy getting crucifix.

961
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:51,640
So now just say squash family.

962
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,550
So now Jostens like,

963
00:23:52,551 --> 00:23:52,851
Yo,

964
00:23:52,851 --> 00:23:53,780
we're supposed to fight.

965
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:54,240
Let's do it.

966
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,660
I'm trying to build some fucking wells.

967
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,120
Yeah,

968
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,550
he's definitely got a different
motivation than everybody else.

969
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:58,701
Yeah,

970
00:23:58,701 --> 00:23:58,971
man.

971
00:23:58,971 --> 00:23:59,751
What a great guy.

972
00:23:59,751 --> 00:24:00,141
He is.

973
00:24:00,141 --> 00:24:01,360
Got Such a better guy than me

974
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,500
because I would say my
watches and cars and shit.

975
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,401
There's no,

976
00:24:07,401 --> 00:24:07,840
well,

977
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,120
there's no sense of bad news.

978
00:24:11,121 --> 00:24:12,290
I can't get the well equipment.

979
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,463
What happened?

980
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:16,490
Some rams around with your Instagram page.

981
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,780
She said watch car.

982
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,850
Exactly the same amount as a,

983
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:20,241
well,

984
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:21,050
it's weird,

985
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:21,241
dude.

986
00:24:21,241 --> 00:24:21,770
I'm not my,

987
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,603
it was a gift.

988
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,070
I bought myself a gift for having a baby.

989
00:24:25,071 --> 00:24:25,850
I guess you get them on.

990
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,683
What about me?

991
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,220
But my snowball rolling.

992
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,523
So

993
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,821
I showed up.

994
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:32,361
My Dad was like,

995
00:24:32,361 --> 00:24:32,721
what's that?

996
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:32,961
I'm like,

997
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:33,101
oh,

998
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:34,500
I gotta push gift and

999
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,130
a push gift.

1000
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:37,461
Yeah.

1001
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:38,211
Girls get pushed.

1002
00:24:38,211 --> 00:24:39,044
Pushkin Oh shit.

1003
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,210
There's two dads Krause's back deep.

1004
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,380
Two Hooks in.

1005
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,213
Oh Shit.

1006
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,570
Flattened out.

1007
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,553
Nope.

1008
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,260
Crouse escape back to his back.

1009
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,180
He can escape and Tom
Triangle right there.

1010
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,590
Soon as he turns,

1011
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,820
he's too smart for that son and he just
one or the other and it's going to have

1012
00:24:57,021 --> 00:24:58,630
it as a back taken still dude.

1013
00:24:58,631 --> 00:25:01,370
That Mcgregor dos Anjos
makes my dick hard.

1014
00:25:01,371 --> 00:25:02,204
Even that flyer right?

1015
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,343
It makes it,

1016
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,120
it makes other people's dicks hard.

1017
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,200
I'm going to say something crazy,

1018
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:06,420
Joe.

1019
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,070
You ready for this?

1020
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,580
Okay.

1021
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:12,580
I think the toughest matchup possible
in the UFC for Mcgregor is dos Anjos.

1022
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,170
I think the easier fight
is Robbie Lawler form.

1023
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:16,663
Wow.

1024
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,720
Suck on that.

1025
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,180
Yeah,

1026
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,950
and I've been thinking about lately
and it's Kinda hit everyone's fucking

1027
00:25:21,951 --> 00:25:24,140
talking about this right now and I
was just putting two and two together.

1028
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:24,321
I'm like,

1029
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:24,471
well,

1030
00:25:24,471 --> 00:25:25,820
if he does knock out to us telling us,

1031
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:26,871
I was like,

1032
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,201
wow,

1033
00:25:27,201 --> 00:25:28,350
he's going on 17 rob,

1034
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,140
you're going to fucking throw down.

1035
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,290
I just know they're not rob.

1036
00:25:31,291 --> 00:25:32,124
He's not going to touch them.

1037
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,450
You don't think so?

1038
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,280
Not a chance.

1039
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,671
Wow.

1040
00:25:34,671 --> 00:25:35,920
You think he's just going to move around?

1041
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:39,400
It's Robbie up and I love rock
style wise fucks Robbie up.

1042
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,090
Where does Connor stop

1043
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:44,581
at?

1044
00:25:44,581 --> 00:25:48,080
One 70 why wouldn't he go one 85 he's
already stated publicly that he's not

1045
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:48,980
afraid of any weight class.

1046
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:49,920
Here's what I get that.

1047
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,350
But then every visit come into play.

1048
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,040
Stay the fuck away from Wonderboy.

1049
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:55,730
Yeah.

1050
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,340
That dude's got the
fucking glow right now.

1051
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:58,851
I agree.

1052
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:01,950
He's got the Bruce Lee [inaudible].

1053
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,360
What he did to Johnny Hendricks
should be against the law.

1054
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,750
They should have shut the lights off.

1055
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,040
They should have separated them and go,

1056
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:10,191
Whoa,

1057
00:26:10,191 --> 00:26:10,301
Whoa,

1058
00:26:10,301 --> 00:26:10,520
whoa.

1059
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,353
Not Tonight.

1060
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,490
We need to stop this.

1061
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:14,720
Hendrix came in shape,

1062
00:26:14,721 --> 00:26:15,390
had all his shots.

1063
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,760
Fucking shit figured out.

1064
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,460
Biggest karate right now.

1065
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:21,290
Johnny got is strong fuck life for years.

1066
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:25,280
That sport karate has this one element
that no one knows how to fuck with these

1067
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:26,150
blitz guys.

1068
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,290
He's Raymond Daniels,

1069
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:31,190
guys that jump in and attack and then
jump out before you can do anything about

1070
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:31,460
it.

1071
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,960
And if you don't have like some
serious Nikki holds can style or Joseph

1072
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,920
[inaudible] style Moitai skills.

1073
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,140
Well you can hands up
high and chop those legs.

1074
00:26:39,141 --> 00:26:39,860
Has that right now,

1075
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,310
no one has no one in the UFC has it
rebel Raymond Daniels does to everybody

1076
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,510
except Niki holds skin and and
Joseph Valtellina in in glory.

1077
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,720
Valtellina was the first guy
exposed at chop those legs down,

1078
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,650
hands up high,

1079
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:53,484
good guard,

1080
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,001
attack,

1081
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:54,391
attack,

1082
00:26:54,391 --> 00:26:57,220
attack the legs and eventually chop
him down and he had kicked him.

1083
00:26:57,221 --> 00:26:58,050
Who stops him?

1084
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,470
And the same thing we'd Nikki hold
skin is that super solid Moitai base.

1085
00:27:01,471 --> 00:27:04,950
But everybody else gets three
60 wheel kicked in the head.

1086
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,460
You,

1087
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,590
he hits you that this memo jumping
sidekick touches you with a side kick and

1088
00:27:09,591 --> 00:27:11,460
then spins the backache to the city.

1089
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:15,150
So I think one Wonderboy right now beats
everyone said every worst matchup for

1090
00:27:15,151 --> 00:27:15,660
him.

1091
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,493
Roy McDonald,

1092
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:17,430
he's too smart.

1093
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,360
I think you guys always fight
next fuck off Roy MacDonald.

1094
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,500
That's what I'm hearing.

1095
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,350
I could see Roy thrown a real heavy,

1096
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,710
I got form system.

1097
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,360
Let's let Wonderboy do his thing.

1098
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,400
Why would you give him the
worst matchup possible?

1099
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,700
Why wouldn't you give Rory and opportunity
to stop the hype train if that's

1100
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:33,534
what's going to happen.

1101
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,141
There you go.

1102
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:34,291
Okay.

1103
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:34,801
What do you think Roy?

1104
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:35,670
He's gonna be able to do to him.

1105
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,870
He just wants to wear his skin.

1106
00:27:36,871 --> 00:27:37,704
That's all

1107
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,380
you know,

1108
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,700
came into the world to
smarter than Americans.

1109
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:42,961
I don't,

1110
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:45,180
I don't know if it's
100% it's a rumor I saw.

1111
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:45,870
I saw it was a room.

1112
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,140
That's why I mentioned
might've done a little fuck.

1113
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,163
It's a room.

1114
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:54,270
I might where a hyped it up
already that it hasn't aired yet.

1115
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,051
It might have happened.

1116
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:55,741
I mean I don't remember.

1117
00:27:55,741 --> 00:27:58,470
I'd be breaking news fingers.

1118
00:27:58,471 --> 00:27:58,711
Right.

1119
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:03,711
That one can sing 15% growing McDonald's
too smart to fall into his traps and

1120
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:05,170
the case.

1121
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,003
So what does he do?

1122
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,690
He's got to kickbox with them when they're
on the outside and that's where your

1123
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,260
stab is fucking nasty.

1124
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,060
And then as soon as Roy gets comfortable,

1125
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,350
but he fucks everybody.

1126
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,150
What does that,

1127
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,210
that was a giant one,

1128
00:28:15,211 --> 00:28:15,810
dude.

1129
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,750
That's the biggest battery I've ever seen.

1130
00:28:17,751 --> 00:28:18,584
Anyone of those things.

1131
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:22,470
That thing is like a
paper towel roll anymore.

1132
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,740
How long has that battery last?

1133
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,131
Let me see.

1134
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:26,964
The last thing.

1135
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:27,910
I Dunno.

1136
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:31,980
You go fucking hiking in the Alps with
that battery and a lot of those like

1137
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,140
[inaudible] or you smoked pot.

1138
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,003
I was like,

1139
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:35,903
I smoke a lot.

1140
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,830
Smoke a lot.

1141
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:37,111
No one.

1142
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:37,944
I knew that about you.

1143
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:38,431
I knew that.

1144
00:28:38,431 --> 00:28:39,200
But you knew that.

1145
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,780
Yeah.

1146
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,940
Maybe I knew and I forgot.

1147
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:41,491
Have you been,

1148
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:42,324
I figured you did.

1149
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:44,730
Is the shit.

1150
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,393
I have this thing.

1151
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,953
I think it would

1152
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,213
say something.

1153
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,640
Um,

1154
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,890
it's good dude.

1155
00:28:58,891 --> 00:28:59,460
That's good.

1156
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,890
Roy Wonderboy head tension man may happen.

1157
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,520
I may not.

1158
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,031
Who knows?

1159
00:29:03,031 --> 00:29:03,601
We'll find out.

1160
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:03,901
Connor,

1161
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:05,010
Wonderboy shit.

1162
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,970
Connor Wonderboy.

1163
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,081
Here's the thing,

1164
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:07,440
Matt,

1165
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,590
you got to kick with Wonderboy and
Connor's kicks are just nowhere near the

1166
00:29:10,591 --> 00:29:11,520
level of wonder boys.

1167
00:29:11,521 --> 00:29:12,810
It's just not even in the same.

1168
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,170
He'd be sure about this hands on 100%
his hands are better than wonder boys,

1169
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:16,560
I think.

1170
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,321
And wonder boy,

1171
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:18,720
he's got some fucking vicious hands.

1172
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,130
That's what knockout power.

1173
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:23,410
What Connor has in that
left hand is what for us,

1174
00:29:23,411 --> 00:29:23,761
a hobby.

1175
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,140
He likes to call it the touch of death.

1176
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:30,480
I liked the one 45 55 and 75 you're
talking about big boy was knocking

1177
00:29:30,481 --> 00:29:33,180
motherfuckers dead at
one 55 with one punch.

1178
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,860
He was doing it all throughout England.

1179
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,431
I mean,

1180
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:38,470
I don't know if he could do that in
the UFC at one 55 different level.

1181
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,420
Mother,

1182
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:41,810
you,

1183
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm

1184
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,200
tea.

1185
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,100
You are right though.

1186
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:44,080
Sandra's is a beast.

1187
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,230
But I believe the kind
of power that Connor has,

1188
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,390
you just has that undeniable.

1189
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,180
It's undeniable.

1190
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,790
I just don't know if he's going to be
able to do it because here's the thing

1191
00:29:54,791 --> 00:29:55,261
about those.

1192
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:58,990
Angela's still Sangiovese is a gap closer
and then mother fucker closes gaps on

1193
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:01,180
you before you even
realized he's on top of you.

1194
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,820
He did it the doubt to Donald
and he did it to pedis.

1195
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,190
Two guys who were pretty
fucking skillful strikers.

1196
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,420
He closes that distance on you in a
surprising way and there's no hesitation.

1197
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:14,080
No hesitation is grappling is outstanding
and there's no hesitation in his game.

1198
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,161
And with that,

1199
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:16,630
nick curse on do training him,

1200
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:17,020
man,

1201
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,690
he's got 15 gas tanks and they're already,

1202
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,280
they're already a movement coach though.

1203
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,780
He's the movement coach.

1204
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:22,960
They,

1205
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,260
they're doing all these crazy
plyometric jails was a prime interest.

1206
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,093
And then you've got,

1207
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:27,580
you know,

1208
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:27,781
you,

1209
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:28,081
you,

1210
00:30:28,081 --> 00:30:28,970
you got um,

1211
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,650
uh,

1212
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,350
fucking he's get king's MMA right.

1213
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,323
Okay.

1214
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,581
Yeah,

1215
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,310
I'll feel court Darrell's
one of the greatest striking
instructors in the world.

1216
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,410
He's got Fabrizio over doom there.

1217
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,390
You've got a shitload of
animals to train with.

1218
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,660
He's a complete animal.

1219
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,760
Honestly,

1220
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,890
as far as natural buys,

1221
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:44,800
you bake the fight down.

1222
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,661
I can't think of it.

1223
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:46,530
Worst matchup for Connor.

1224
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,890
He beats him.

1225
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,240
They're both in their prime.

1226
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,141
If he beats him,

1227
00:30:50,141 --> 00:30:54,070
he goes right to Robbie Lawler for
UFC 200 and the world exploded.

1228
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:54,701
If he beats him.

1229
00:30:54,701 --> 00:30:57,280
Aliens land a fighter of all time.

1230
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,173
Yes.

1231
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,070
Yes.

1232
00:30:59,070 --> 00:30:59,600
All right.

1233
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,100
Here's,

1234
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,600
here's an argument that I
was having with somebody.

1235
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,500
This is a discussion.

1236
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,850
This is a legit question.

1237
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,300
Mighty mouse right now degrees the best
pound for pound guy to Saint John John's

1238
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,393
Ursula

1239
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,793
daring

1240
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,900
because the risk,

1241
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,100
the risk to reward.

1242
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,000
He can make mistakes.

1243
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,560
He's destroying the competition,

1244
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,880
but he couldn't make mistakes with Dotson.

1245
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,930
Dotson dead with one shot different,

1246
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,240
different than Jon Jones.

1247
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:24,060
Gustin rumble.

1248
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,913
Rumble.

1249
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,290
I disagree with Gustafson.

1250
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:30,010
I don't think guts dead with one
punch and easier than Dotson does it?

1251
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:30,401
Matter of fact,

1252
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:32,530
I think Dodson offers
more danger on the feet.

1253
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,523
I disagree.

1254
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,150
Okay.

1255
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:35,020
But we're allowed to,

1256
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:35,760
um,

1257
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,990
you know what?

1258
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,870
One 20 zero,

1259
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,440
that's fine.

1260
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,741
Okay,

1261
00:31:38,741 --> 00:31:39,940
so at the very least,

1262
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,230
he's number two pound for pound.

1263
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:41,890
Best in the world.

1264
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,280
I agree.

1265
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:42,940
Okay.

1266
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,211
All right.

1267
00:31:43,211 --> 00:31:44,140
I think he's number one.

1268
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,240
A lot of other people's thinking is
done want including boss route and,

1269
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:47,021
but what the fuck she now,

1270
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:47,854
right.

1271
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,740
Joe Rogan buzzers.

1272
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,741
It makes sense.

1273
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:51,860
So if,

1274
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,290
if so Hutto beats him.

1275
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,410
He's an Olympic gold
medalists and wrestling.

1276
00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:01,060
So he becomes the first Olympic gold
medalist and wrestling that wins a

1277
00:32:01,061 --> 00:32:02,080
flyweight title.

1278
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,150
Okay.

1279
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:05,740
And he beats arguably the best guy ever.

1280
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,280
Okay.

1281
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,940
If Demetrius Mighty Mouse Johnson is the
best guy right now and you fought him

1282
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:10,390
before,

1283
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,200
yes.

1284
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,033
I know.

1285
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,890
You look at them like today and you look
at what he's been able to do over his

1286
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,724
last few fights.

1287
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,650
It's hard to argue more dominant champion.

1288
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,480
He doesn't get hit.

1289
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,000
Yeah.

1290
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
It doesn't get hit by the best guys.

1291
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:21,300
Cruise beat them.

1292
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:21,580
Yes.

1293
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,890
A long time ago at one 35
he's a different fighter then.

1294
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,940
Just say Ian,

1295
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,440
arguably one as well.

1296
00:32:26,441 --> 00:32:27,274
I'll tell you that.

1297
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,050
It's not my pound for pound number.

1298
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:29,381
Why?

1299
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,460
But that's a long time ago.

1300
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:30,731
So it,

1301
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:31,500
they'll sign.

1302
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,670
I Click Guido,

1303
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,880
who's John Jones lost too.

1304
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:34,923
It's true.

1305
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,400
He lost the rule.

1306
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,380
He lost her shitty even
lose to mark them up.

1307
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,640
He lost to a shitty rule.

1308
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:41,683
The rule

1309
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,870
separate his clavicle or setting up
that fucking dumpy did him and animal.

1310
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:48,531
Um,

1311
00:32:48,531 --> 00:32:49,300
I don't know.

1312
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,050
He separated his fucking elbow.

1313
00:32:51,051 --> 00:32:53,060
Driving into the ward was brutal.

1314
00:32:53,061 --> 00:32:53,894
That was brutal.

1315
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,760
Fucking a total dominant performance.

1316
00:32:55,761 --> 00:32:56,870
You can never call that a loss.

1317
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:59,840
And I don't give a fuck what
planet you're on the job.

1318
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,360
We haven't seen John
Lewis never lost a DJ.

1319
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,070
We had seen John get there,

1320
00:33:04,071 --> 00:33:04,821
was so close,

1321
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:05,960
like a fight with Ian Mccall.

1322
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,250
That's why you're not my number one.

1323
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,360
That's good.

1324
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:09,110
That's a good argument.

1325
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,531
Not really.

1326
00:33:09,531 --> 00:33:10,364
It's a good argument.

1327
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,080
I think John's the best,

1328
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,080
but Dj's definitely have
their djs a fucking machines.

1329
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,120
So djs three here's my question.

1330
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:17,511
If so,

1331
00:33:17,511 --> 00:33:18,470
Hutto beats him.

1332
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,750
Is he like the best
combat sport athlete ever?

1333
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,020
Who the fuck to do our
work to do for sure,

1334
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,460
but if you have to defend it,

1335
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,960
if he can beat the best guy ever.

1336
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,070
Is it a styles?

1337
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,780
I mean like arguably if you're looking
at someone who's an Olympic gold medalist

1338
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:34,100
and then becomes a world
champion in the UFC,

1339
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,800
that's one of the great,

1340
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,320
that's a,

1341
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,720
that's a massive resume.

1342
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,270
Like as far as like
accomplishments on paper,

1343
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,540
the only thing that comes close is
Allister winning the k one Grand Prix.

1344
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,770
If he won the UFC title,

1345
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,391
if asked,

1346
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:47,660
or one that k one Grand Prix,

1347
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,860
he won strike for us.

1348
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,420
He was the Strikeforce
heavyweight champion.

1349
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:54,530
He was a dream every way champion and
like arguably in MMA Allister's one of,

1350
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,150
if not the most,

1351
00:33:56,270 --> 00:34:00,770
one of the most decorated guys in all
sports by four k one Grand Prix is the

1352
00:34:00,771 --> 00:34:01,310
pinnacle,

1353
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:04,030
the pinnacle of men heavyweight
kickbox is so if so,

1354
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,780
Hutto wins a gold fucking medal in the
Olympic Games and then goes on to when

1355
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:09,614
UFC goal.

1356
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,160
He's right up there with one of the
most accomplished mixed martial arts.

1357
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:13,491
Happy.

1358
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:14,151
Definitely could be.

1359
00:34:14,151 --> 00:34:15,890
And they should be marketing
the fucking to him.

1360
00:34:15,891 --> 00:34:16,580
To Mexico.

1361
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,060
Oh yeah.

1362
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:21,320
Cause I know fucking better
be to second all the money.

1363
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,570
It's fucking stop it.

1364
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,613
It's hard.

1365
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,000
Why is it hard to sell the flyweights
and why is it hard to sell your weight

1366
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:29,680
class?

1367
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,513
I don't know.

1368
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,820
People are like Ron does.

1369
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,570
She's one 35 small isn't,

1370
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,000
it's bigger than that.

1371
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:35,870
When she makes more money,

1372
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:39,140
he's one 25 one 2030 pieces smaller.

1373
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,700
The problem didn't even
know what weight you fight.

1374
00:34:40,701 --> 00:34:43,080
That's why me and Rhonda will never
fight this cause she weighs more than me.

1375
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:45,650
This is a,

1376
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:46,520
it's a strange,

1377
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,960
it's a strange phenomenon because in
boxing it's the same thing in boxing.

1378
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,550
You get plucked a chuck Alito.

1379
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,690
Nobody.

1380
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:54,080
Yeah,

1381
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,830
chocolate Taco.

1382
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:55,700
The fuckers.

1383
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,000
He's not bitches

1384
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,250
don't,

1385
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,060
it never really caught,

1386
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,290
he was just a little too small.

1387
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:03,890
They're too small.

1388
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,820
Bad motherfucker.

1389
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:06,120
He not just don't buy into it.

1390
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,130
Some stang man and he was in his prime.

1391
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,720
No needle Donaire can crack.

1392
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,501
Is it because you,

1393
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:13,040
you want that.

1394
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,873
When you think of fighters,

1395
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,930
think of like heroes.

1396
00:35:14,931 --> 00:35:15,450
You know what I'm saying?

1397
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:16,670
You want to got to be able
to be one of the APPS.

1398
00:35:16,671 --> 00:35:17,690
You want to get to be big.

1399
00:35:17,691 --> 00:35:18,180
Yeah,

1400
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,490
because people look at
you and they're like,

1401
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,533
Ian Mccall,

1402
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,280
he will rip your Dick off.

1403
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,521
Yeah,

1404
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,980
you you've ripped her fucking face stuff.

1405
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,501
You know what I'm saying?

1406
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:24,651
Well,

1407
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:25,760
in the real world,

1408
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,100
but the problem is when
people are watching this shit,

1409
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,440
everybody thinks that they can kick
ass when they watch this stuff.

1410
00:35:30,441 --> 00:35:32,350
It's one of Chris' Kamozi Cho rigs.

1411
00:35:32,351 --> 00:35:33,300
She'll raise those up.

1412
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,610
Just need to and the damn thing.

1413
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,620
Forgive author doesn't give a fuck.

1414
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,140
I'll tell you,

1415
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,100
you want to talk about a world

1416
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,933
beater in the gym.

1417
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,110
I've heard stories about Joe rigs back
when rich Franklin was a champion of,

1418
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:46,020
people were saying if Joe rigs
could fight in the octagon,

1419
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:47,490
the way he spar sometimes,

1420
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,670
like he catches these rhythms where you
mean he got it back then especially he's

1421
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,730
had rough career.

1422
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:53,971
You know,

1423
00:35:53,971 --> 00:35:56,220
he's been a lot of fights
and he's had a long,

1424
00:35:56,221 --> 00:35:59,400
long time up inside the octagon
and other organizations,

1425
00:35:59,401 --> 00:35:59,901
he's been around.

1426
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,500
Joe Rugs is a fucking real veteran.

1427
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,430
Be 300 pounds.

1428
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:02,851
Yes.

1429
00:36:02,851 --> 00:36:02,970
Yeah.

1430
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,650
But when he was on fire,

1431
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,060
like when he was at his best,

1432
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,880
there were saying he was like
hell on wheels in the gym.

1433
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:09,021
Yeah,

1434
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:10,920
I've heard though like if he
could just get it together,

1435
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,240
he's a fucking world champion.

1436
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,530
Do Chris Kamozi he's a motherfucker
tough as shit in the Denver scene.

1437
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,060
He was like the guy coming up,

1438
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:21,900
he was like the man like the journeyman
and I never trained with them and he was

1439
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:22,560
a south bone.

1440
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,960
We couldn't find any south falls when
I was getting ready to fight cro cop.

1441
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,470
So they bring Kamozi
in the nicest guy ever.

1442
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,430
And his coach goes,

1443
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,241
hey listen man,

1444
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:31,380
you're a lot picking and Chris.

1445
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,570
But he moves and you need a south pole.

1446
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:35,100
So your coach college remember him down.

1447
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,800
But he has a fight his
first UFC fight and he,

1448
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:40,950
I think he's fighting Australia on like
a two week notice and they go make sure

1449
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:41,461
you don't hurt him.

1450
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:42,840
I've never heard anyone really in my life.

1451
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:43,021
I'm like,

1452
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:43,171
yeah,

1453
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,004
no problem man.

1454
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,250
For whatever reason
we're 30 seconds into it.

1455
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,250
I go to throw a hook and
he like charges into it.

1456
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,480
Break his nose literally.

1457
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:54,210
So his first UFC fight had broken nose.

1458
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:57,000
I don't know if he won but he
went through I think a decision.

1459
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,670
He's a tough mother fucker man.

1460
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,750
He's very tough.

1461
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,560
He's very tough.

1462
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
That's a hard thing in camp,

1463
00:37:02,761 --> 00:37:03,210
right?

1464
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:08,210
How hard is it for guys like you where
you have to work with lighter guys or

1465
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:11,010
guys like you who have to
work with heavier guys?

1466
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,570
Like we always say that the Jujitsu
guys that have the best technique or the

1467
00:37:15,571 --> 00:37:17,010
guys who are the smaller guys,

1468
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,023
it's

1469
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,430
Eddie.

1470
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,780
Eddie style is your style was based a
lot on when you didn't lift weights?

1471
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,793
Yes.

1472
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,000
Based on weakness.

1473
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,430
But you're thinking about
guys like Barrett Yoshida.

1474
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,770
You think about heuler like the smaller
guys are known to have like this razor

1475
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,350
razors,

1476
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:36,900
the Mendez brothers razor sharp technique.

1477
00:37:36,901 --> 00:37:37,734
Right.

1478
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,251
And you know,

1479
00:37:38,251 --> 00:37:39,450
those guys have to,

1480
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,520
if you're a trained for an MMA fight,

1481
00:37:41,521 --> 00:37:44,250
how often did you have to spar
guys are like way heavier than you.

1482
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,121
Oh,

1483
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:45,954
we've been,

1484
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:48,530
I've been manicured for so long that it's,

1485
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:49,364
it's uh,

1486
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,540
it's been a while to get
anything out of it though.

1487
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,320
You don't when you're going to,

1488
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,370
whether it was a big guy,

1489
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,204
you're so smart.

1490
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,200
When you're saying by manicured me,

1491
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:56,760
like they,

1492
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,430
they take care of your camp
much more efficiently than that.

1493
00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:01,170
We have so many because it's me and Carla.

1494
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:01,770
Right.

1495
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,000
As far as under one roof,

1496
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,550
calling her dramas,

1497
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:05,641
you know,

1498
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:08,180
he was Tito's coach and
around forever and forever.

1499
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,150
We are respected.

1500
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,321
Yeah.

1501
00:38:09,321 --> 00:38:10,320
And then Jason House,

1502
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,180
my agent always has guys in the gym.

1503
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,100
There's just tons of small guys,

1504
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,910
small guys.

1505
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,950
We have 50 people that,

1506
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,560
that,

1507
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:16,950
you know,

1508
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,100
can fight amateur level,

1509
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,580
the pro and they're all under one 50.

1510
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:23,640
That's the advantage of just
the advantage that we have.

1511
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,380
You know what the in his camp,

1512
00:38:25,381 --> 00:38:26,214
it's an advantage.

1513
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,323
Everyone's camp.

1514
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,710
The small guys are everywhere.

1515
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:28,980
I hate,

1516
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,251
you know,

1517
00:38:29,251 --> 00:38:29,780
small guys,

1518
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,450
right guys?

1519
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,270
It's filled.

1520
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,920
It's willing to fight MMA,

1521
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,310
MMA,

1522
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:39,540
boxing we were talking
about earlier but you know,

1523
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,780
we want to watch bigger guys.

1524
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:44,770
I think maybe we want to watch bigger
guys cause it's bigger guys hit harder and

1525
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:48,520
bigger guys get knocked out easier and
little guys just hard to knock out little

1526
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:53,230
guys because in Jujitsu we'd rather watch
the little guys because it's literally

1527
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:53,740
gotten wore.

1528
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,900
The little guys can choke out.

1529
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,880
They could uh,

1530
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:57,440
they're,

1531
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,390
they're generally more technical and
you see more submissions with the little

1532
00:39:01,391 --> 00:39:02,410
guys or big guys.

1533
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,490
You see a bunch of dudes just holding
and shit cause you don't really ask will

1534
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,513
that like,

1535
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,020
okay look,

1536
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,990
how about when Demetrius mighty mouse
Johnson knocked out Benevidez with one

1537
00:39:10,991 --> 00:39:11,500
punch?

1538
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,940
I think if we saw that more often,

1539
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,010
I think it little guys,

1540
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,240
I don't think it still works.

1541
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:18,710
I think of little guys got knocked out
easier than big guys are more than big

1542
00:39:18,711 --> 00:39:19,000
guys.

1543
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,681
We would like to learn.

1544
00:39:19,681 --> 00:39:20,340
I don't think so.

1545
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,450
It's just not fair to him.

1546
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,610
It's the pure mass like even when's
the last time you saw a small gun?

1547
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,210
A porno even in everything.

1548
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,420
Think about it.

1549
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,440
Even in Pornos,

1550
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:32,530
they're fucking big dude's got it.

1551
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,210
This is what I'm thinking smaller with
regular Dick so that they lick the dick

1552
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:40,540
look bigger than the
guy with the big boys.

1553
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,860
Psychologically,

1554
00:39:41,861 --> 00:39:45,880
if you watch someone and even if he
beats up someone who's smaller than you,

1555
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,560
if you can say in your head,

1556
00:39:47,561 --> 00:39:48,251
even if you're wrong,

1557
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:49,084
if you can say in your head,

1558
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,080
couldn't do that to me,

1559
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,370
then you're not as impressed.

1560
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:51,590
Yes.

1561
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,690
It's like when you watch rumble,

1562
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:53,710
put someone in orbit.

1563
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,221
It's nothing.

1564
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,890
Can you see rumble hit people and
put them in orbit and you just go,

1565
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:57,671
oh fuck,

1566
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:58,660
I got to get out of this room.

1567
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:05,590
It's a totally different straight
appeal because he's so fucking powerful.

1568
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,780
Two Oh five that you like,

1569
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,430
well that would definitely work on me.

1570
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,380
They go one 25 I weighs less
than my girlfriend and say,

1571
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,081
hey little guy.

1572
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:17,470
Is there a one 25 or that
it has had econ or hands.

1573
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,470
Is there anybody like crop Linacre.

1574
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,370
Dot.

1575
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:21,911
Oh my God.

1576
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:22,870
And liquors a murder.

1577
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,040
He drops the best five guys card if he
finds like that fall below the division

1578
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:31,091
of,

1579
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:32,290
cause I've been boxing,

1580
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:32,780
uh,

1581
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,130
uh,

1582
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,090
Chiquita Gonzalez.

1583
00:40:34,091 --> 00:40:37,450
Remember Remembering Chiquita against
Mike Michael Carb Hall back in the day.

1584
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,600
Who matches?

1585
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,460
Those guys were 115 pounds.

1586
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:42,881
Yeah,

1587
00:40:42,881 --> 00:40:43,301
but you know,

1588
00:40:43,301 --> 00:40:44,350
we're throwing bombs.

1589
00:40:44,351 --> 00:40:44,620
That was,

1590
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,560
that was also like on TV.

1591
00:40:47,561 --> 00:40:49,240
They put them on like regular TV,

1592
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,710
like ABC Wide World of sports.

1593
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,031
It was paper,

1594
00:40:52,031 --> 00:40:52,841
but to build them up,

1595
00:40:52,841 --> 00:40:54,490
didn't carbo fight on all that stuff.

1596
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:55,330
Did he find on TV?

1597
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,880
They used to do a lot more
of that back then for sure.

1598
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,750
They're going back to the hall.

1599
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,240
Also had a huge following.

1600
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:01,390
You know,

1601
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:02,380
he was a Phoenix Guy,

1602
00:41:02,381 --> 00:41:02,950
right?

1603
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,160
Didn't he have a gigantic
following and Phoenix.

1604
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,473
Phoenix.

1605
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,301
It's weird.

1606
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:10,000
I Wa Kamala was a Chicano.

1607
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,301
Well,

1608
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:13,630
think about a man named Macchio
Manny back through big fights,

1609
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:13,990
man.

1610
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,740
That's true.

1611
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,271
Manny pack.

1612
00:41:15,271 --> 00:41:16,480
Y'all fights at 47 yeah.

1613
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:16,760
Right.

1614
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,670
But he started his career
eight weight classes,

1615
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:20,740
lower 18 he was like a fly with,

1616
00:41:20,741 --> 00:41:22,200
you're not going to seep out something.

1617
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,490
I want to see what your way we just need,

1618
00:41:24,491 --> 00:41:25,070
dude,

1619
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,930
we need to come in.

1620
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,090
You know Haute Josie,

1621
00:41:28,091 --> 00:41:28,960
all those small guy.

1622
00:41:28,961 --> 00:41:31,690
I mean considering he'd
knocked the fuck out of people.

1623
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:32,620
That's what people want to see.

1624
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:33,890
You still don't get respect though.

1625
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,130
I'm

1626
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:34,551
a fucking,

1627
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:36,650
I lose it nine years
and I have to sell him.

1628
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,950
That's just the way the world in America.

1629
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:40,490
The memorial,

1630
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,690
the wacky dude.

1631
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,740
It don't make any sense.

1632
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,500
Well there's a lot more
to being a star then.

1633
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:47,800
Just just knocking people
out and just winning.

1634
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,920
Connor's got it all.

1635
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,461
He's not,

1636
00:41:49,461 --> 00:41:50,294
he's winning.

1637
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:54,020
He's knocking everybody out with
one punch and he wears suits.

1638
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:55,840
He's got the fucking crazy hippy shit.

1639
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,300
Crunk for Donna cause it's
found out crack Joe rigs.

1640
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,430
Oh,

1641
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,050
nobody can take that.

1642
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,600
Oh my God,

1643
00:42:05,601 --> 00:42:06,890
she's good jam.

1644
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:09,860
Kamozi with the crushing dude.

1645
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:11,870
He questioned and out of the UFC too.

1646
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,531
Damn.

1647
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:13,990
That was a brutal does that.

1648
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:14,721
That was like,

1649
00:42:14,721 --> 00:42:16,690
who did Ben Saunders do
that to remember that back?

1650
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,340
God that was was either,

1651
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:22,870
Ben's was even more brutal because it was
all blocked it all with this phase and

1652
00:42:22,871 --> 00:42:23,201
have yet,

1653
00:42:23,201 --> 00:42:24,560
and it had an actual Thai clinch.

1654
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:24,930
Yeah.

1655
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,060
I just wasn't just covering up.

1656
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:27,140
He was just getting the,

1657
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,110
Julian was a real tough marine.

1658
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,340
I remember I think,

1659
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:32,360
I think he was in the military,

1660
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,660
but do it was tough as fuck and just
ate those shots that like yesterday that

1661
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,450
dude,

1662
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:38,600
it was fucking tough.

1663
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:39,920
And that was one of the
things I was going to say,

1664
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:40,370
man,

1665
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:43,390
if it wasn't for like in
your last fight with uh,

1666
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,633
um,

1667
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,350
what's his name?

1668
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:45,560
Uh,

1669
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,110
liquor when Blair could
didn't make weight.

1670
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,250
Dude,

1671
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,600
you took some fucking shots in that fight
that the guys that are not as tough as

1672
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:54,380
you.

1673
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:54,861
I was like,

1674
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:55,521
Holy Shit.

1675
00:42:55,521 --> 00:42:56,420
Like as a friend,

1676
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,140
that was a hard one to watch because like
in the second round I think is when he

1677
00:43:00,141 --> 00:43:02,450
hit you with some fucking
vicious body shots.

1678
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,250
He hit you with some really hard bombs.

1679
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,850
What does the second or the third have?

1680
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,713
I don't know.

1681
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:09,470
There was a moment in that
fight where I was like,

1682
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,550
oh Jesus,

1683
00:43:10,551 --> 00:43:13,300
how long ago was getting and he ray
rock me in the third because it was the

1684
00:43:13,301 --> 00:43:13,820
third third.

1685
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,310
How hard is that mother
fucker hit really hard.

1686
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,930
Like creepy hard,

1687
00:43:17,931 --> 00:43:18,290
right?

1688
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:19,123
Yeah.

1689
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,750
I don't know if it's,

1690
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,370
my coach has its cause you know,

1691
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,720
it's cause I died.

1692
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,440
Um,

1693
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,650
but same as like me and like my other
training partner and coach Oromia Dante,

1694
00:43:27,651 --> 00:43:28,640
he died getting shot.

1695
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,420
So we both kind of weird tolerance
to pain and not get knocked out.

1696
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:34,220
And uh hmm.

1697
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:34,900
Wait a minute.

1698
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
I just remember going like,

1699
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:37,400
Holy Shit Man.

1700
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:39,320
Like everything that wall

1701
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:41,931
don't come after me,

1702
00:43:41,931 --> 00:43:42,600
please.

1703
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,231
I'm Francisco.

1704
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:47,490
Avera does society stand God Bang with
him and he's another dude I really like.

1705
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,343
That's my good friend.

1706
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,010
He's a friend.

1707
00:43:49,010 --> 00:43:52,300
I loved that dude and I think he
got a raw deal in the arrive here.

1708
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:54,640
The referee should stop
that when the IPO cap.

1709
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,140
And it was obvious I poke,

1710
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:57,080
you know,

1711
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:57,913
but he,

1712
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,300
I'd never thought he would do that.

1713
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:02,760
I thought he would move and use
his skills and light him up.

1714
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:03,321
I don't know,

1715
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:03,770
man.

1716
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:06,530
Maybe he just got hit and he
just wanted to hit him back.

1717
00:44:06,531 --> 00:44:07,680
Who knows when you train us,

1718
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:08,690
just go in the gym.

1719
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,360
All of a sudden he starts
kicking and you're like,

1720
00:44:11,361 --> 00:44:12,320
what the fuck?

1721
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:14,000
He has a sick,

1722
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:14,811
diverse,

1723
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:16,820
super technical open,

1724
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,210
beautiful hip rotation and everything
on all kinds of expand kicks,

1725
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:20,451
jump,

1726
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:20,890
kicks.

1727
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:21,380
Wow.

1728
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:22,790
And then all of a sudden you crack them.

1729
00:44:22,791 --> 00:44:23,840
He's just fucking plants there.

1730
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,690
And once you get punched in the face like,

1731
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:27,023
Oh man,

1732
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,760
I love watching that do fight.

1733
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,840
But I felt like,

1734
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:30,290
man,

1735
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:32,030
he got a raw deal in the favor

1736
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:32,883
fight,

1737
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,610
you know?

1738
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:33,820
Uh,

1739
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,240
and then they to stand
right in front of Leonard,

1740
00:44:36,241 --> 00:44:38,370
go like that and just
throw down his next fight.

1741
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:39,540
Like this is crazy.

1742
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,270
I wonder if he just thought
that he could get him.

1743
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,170
I think he did.

1744
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:43,790
Yeah.

1745
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:43,940
I,

1746
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:45,480
I think that that's what it came down to.

1747
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:46,890
Kind of spooky.

1748
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:47,461
He Spooky.

1749
00:44:47,461 --> 00:44:48,294
Spooky.

1750
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,220
That was my favorite fight on this card.

1751
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:50,580
Yeah.

1752
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,740
Cody verse Linda Curt.

1753
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:52,501
That's a fucking,

1754
00:44:52,501 --> 00:44:54,330
Dan gave that shit away from us.

1755
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:54,591
Fuck.

1756
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,120
That mosquito said not on
my watch and he do shit.

1757
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,260
He seems to be just as heavy handed at
one 35 which made this fight so far.

1758
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:02,520
Great match though.

1759
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:06,990
Oh yeah.

1760
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,823
Illinois.

1761
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,230
This guy beat half a Mendez.

1762
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:10,590
Yeah.

1763
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,300
Although like fine advantage
or something like that,

1764
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:17,301
but still just to even tie half monster,

1765
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,310
half amended from tapping you.

1766
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:21,061
It's cute.

1767
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:21,900
Like you survived.

1768
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,531
It's cool.

1769
00:45:22,531 --> 00:45:24,090
But I don't see someone
get punched in the face,

1770
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:26,280
but that was in the g and he's,

1771
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:26,671
you know,

1772
00:45:26,671 --> 00:45:29,520
so I don't know if all is Jiu
Jitsu is going to translate to MMA.

1773
00:45:29,521 --> 00:45:30,354
We're going to see,

1774
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:30,991
you know,

1775
00:45:30,991 --> 00:45:32,910
but a fucking poor Joe rigs,

1776
00:45:32,911 --> 00:45:33,121
man.

1777
00:45:33,121 --> 00:45:33,954
I hate seeing that.

1778
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:34,711
Well man,

1779
00:45:34,711 --> 00:45:35,460
you know what?

1780
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,170
Kamasi did what he wanted to do and
rigs didn't get a chance to do it.

1781
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:38,581
Like he's,

1782
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:39,690
his arm is fucked up,

1783
00:45:39,691 --> 00:45:39,841
man.

1784
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:40,674
He's holding his arm.

1785
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,320
Think about how many needs he
took that he blocked on that arm.

1786
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:44,850
What are the odds that arm is broken?

1787
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:45,811
Pretty High,

1788
00:45:45,811 --> 00:45:46,080
right?

1789
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,580
I would say 85%.

1790
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,880
26 guys hit with some bombs there.

1791
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:52,620
Yeah,

1792
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,550
there was some bombs.

1793
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,463
I hate seeing those,

1794
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,900
that it's a rough sport.

1795
00:45:57,901 --> 00:46:01,300
My man is definitely not.

1796
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,130
I'll just tell you to ask you.

1797
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:04,140
How's your shoulder brother?

1798
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:05,323
That's fucked up.

1799
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:05,770
Is it?

1800
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:06,490
Uh,

1801
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,310
I probably shouldn't say anything
but arm pop it again this week.

1802
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:10,810
How long were you out for you?

1803
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:11,653
What does that mean?

1804
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,470
I had my bet I had
surgery eight months ago.

1805
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:18,370
I had a fully torn bicep tendon to labral
tears and a fully torn rotator cuff.

1806
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,170
So they redid the whole thing.

1807
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,070
Um,

1808
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:24,310
Carla actually had her lay room done a
week before me and the doctor's like,

1809
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:24,611
Oh yeah,

1810
00:46:24,611 --> 00:46:25,330
we'll have it done.

1811
00:46:25,330 --> 00:46:26,380
Just like her same shit.

1812
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,423
And after,

1813
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:28,110
uh,

1814
00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:30,220
I remember I'm sitting there and he
called me a couple of days later.

1815
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:30,431
He's like,

1816
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:31,264
so how are you doing?

1817
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,410
I'm like,

1818
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:32,950
well dude,

1819
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,720
did you fucking tap dance on my shoulder?

1820
00:46:34,721 --> 00:46:35,554
Like what the fuck?

1821
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:36,100
And he didn't,

1822
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,960
he told me everything
he had to do and then,

1823
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,650
uh,

1824
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:39,730
I had stem cell put in it.

1825
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:40,820
Thank you.

1826
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:41,621
Thank you doctor.

1827
00:46:41,621 --> 00:46:43,210
Thermo's and,

1828
00:46:43,211 --> 00:46:44,044
uh,

1829
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:44,890
it's,

1830
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:46,120
it's really fucking strong.

1831
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,680
My arm is strong,

1832
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,180
but all the sudden I'll be moving
and I'll throw it and it'll just,

1833
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,370
just boom.

1834
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:52,211
I'm like fucking,

1835
00:46:52,211 --> 00:46:53,070
that'll hurt and you know,

1836
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:55,210
it won't feel good and I'll
kind of just keep shadowboxing.

1837
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,560
Well it's been eight months.

1838
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:57,341
You know,

1839
00:46:57,341 --> 00:47:01,570
I throw a punch there the day doing like
a movement drills around this ball and

1840
00:47:01,571 --> 00:47:04,880
it just pop and I just fell
to the ground holding it pops.

1841
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,120
Like get it like came out of socket.

1842
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:07,511
Like none of that.

1843
00:47:07,511 --> 00:47:07,781
I just,

1844
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,370
I felt the pop somewhere in,

1845
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,350
in my bicep to middle of my arm region.

1846
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,430
Did you get it checked out yet?

1847
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:12,761
Yeah.

1848
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:13,330
And they're there.

1849
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,170
They can't feel it.

1850
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:14,680
It has no form,

1851
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,430
no bruising,

1852
00:47:15,430 --> 00:47:16,263
no MRI.

1853
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:16,900
I mean,

1854
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:17,560
not yet.

1855
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:17,891
They're going to,

1856
00:47:17,891 --> 00:47:18,521
they're going to wait and see.

1857
00:47:18,521 --> 00:47:20,980
But I fractured and dislocated
this elbow wrestling.

1858
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,290
I've had three surgeries
on this hand to breaks.

1859
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:24,820
I've had a bad infection in his arm.

1860
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:25,510
Uh,

1861
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,220
I got two bulging discs.

1862
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:28,703
Well,

1863
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,110
so this time

1864
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:31,260
of volume two bulging disks.

1865
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:31,481
Yeah.

1866
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:34,450
This side of my body is kind of
fucked up so that they did that.

1867
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:34,901
Totally.

1868
00:47:34,901 --> 00:47:37,270
Probably related the bulging
disc in your neck then?

1869
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:38,080
Yeah.

1870
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:38,410
Yeah.

1871
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:38,690
Three,

1872
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:38,941
four,

1873
00:47:38,941 --> 00:47:39,774
four or five.

1874
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,360
Yeah,

1875
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,870
that's right where the ULNA
nerve was it like for me,

1876
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,940
my issues with my neck went
all the way down to my fingers.

1877
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:47,170
Do you get any numbing in your fingers?

1878
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,053
Yeah.

1879
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,390
Yeah.

1880
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:49,223
Hey Tom.

1881
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,470
I see doctors.

1882
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,241
I see.

1883
00:47:51,241 --> 00:47:52,074
Gotcha.

1884
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:53,500
But uh,

1885
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:53,681
yeah,

1886
00:47:53,681 --> 00:47:54,210
not now.

1887
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:56,260
Like I told my mom a fucking month ago,

1888
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:56,951
she's like,

1889
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:57,784
are you going to keep doing this?

1890
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:58,031
I'm like,

1891
00:47:58,031 --> 00:47:58,240
no,

1892
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:58,870
I,

1893
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,380
yes,

1894
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,213
I'm back eating.

1895
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:01,373
Well,

1896
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:02,920
is that his girl?

1897
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:03,400
I don't know.

1898
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,300
That might be his mom.

1899
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:04,990
His sister,

1900
00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:05,680
his sister.

1901
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,100
Not to,

1902
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,851
he's young as fuck.

1903
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:07,684
That's his mom.

1904
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:08,663
He could be,

1905
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:09,790
what a handsome fella.

1906
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,500
He needs a new haircut.

1907
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,471
He really need,

1908
00:48:12,471 --> 00:48:13,430
why does that,

1909
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:14,283
does that?

1910
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:17,690
It's a white young dawn.

1911
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,660
If he's really a male model,

1912
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,210
he,

1913
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,043
he would have a different haircut.

1914
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,380
That community is so connected,

1915
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,750
like everybody into MMA knows,

1916
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:26,410
okay,

1917
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,050
say sage loss and everyone's
making fun of them now.

1918
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:29,561
You know what I mean?

1919
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:31,690
That's like the general
consensus consensus.

1920
00:48:31,970 --> 00:48:32,550
Fuck.

1921
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:32,830
You know,

1922
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:33,461
it's crazy.

1923
00:48:33,461 --> 00:48:34,294
They can never

1924
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,880
make fun of anyone anyways.

1925
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,550
I didn't make fun of them.

1926
00:48:39,551 --> 00:48:40,610
I thought I signed him up.

1927
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,490
I didn't think he tab quick.

1928
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,140
I thought that guy put
a good choke on them.

1929
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,000
I tell people with their
arm like that all the time,

1930
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:46,600
it's like,

1931
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,040
I don't think it was a quick tap.

1932
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:48,611
It was legit.

1933
00:48:48,611 --> 00:48:50,920
That guy had a good squeeze
on his hate comes from,

1934
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:51,870
he got so much hype man,

1935
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:53,680
you got paid so much more than other vets.

1936
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,540
So other fighters kinda
like what the fuck man,

1937
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,010
but think if you're him,

1938
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:58,210
if you're him you're like,

1939
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:58,601
dude,

1940
00:48:58,601 --> 00:48:59,434
I didn't ask her this.

1941
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:00,341
Dana was like,

1942
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:01,031
here's your contract.

1943
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:02,240
It's like fun again.

1944
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:06,910
People were really concerned.

1945
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,660
So hands on.

1946
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:11,050
People really concerned that the
other fighters or or like jealous.

1947
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:11,920
I don't think people are,

1948
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:15,310
the fighters are fighters put that out.

1949
00:49:15,311 --> 00:49:16,070
Like you're a boy,

1950
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:16,903
Tony Ferguson,

1951
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:17,480
right?

1952
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,210
Like when the fires put
out then the fans go,

1953
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,081
yeah,

1954
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,050
fuck that guy.

1955
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:21,270
Yeah.

1956
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,470
It's a natural reaction when
someone's that beautiful.

1957
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:24,640
They have so many advantages.

1958
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,250
Nice.

1959
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:29,260
A guy who's got,

1960
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,330
I mean nine to respect,

1961
00:49:31,331 --> 00:49:33,760
but Brian Barbarina his body
on look nothing like that.

1962
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:36,070
Regular Athlete's body.

1963
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,280
So with a regular guy,

1964
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:38,643
regular athletes,

1965
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:43,813
Ferguson

1966
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,810
whooped his ass,

1967
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,240
he whipped his ass and you know,

1968
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:49,750
they were all telling me after the fight,

1969
00:49:49,751 --> 00:49:50,111
I said,

1970
00:49:50,111 --> 00:49:50,441
does he,

1971
00:49:50,441 --> 00:49:51,840
does he top guys like that all the time?

1972
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:52,061
They're like,

1973
00:49:52,061 --> 00:49:52,241
yeah,

1974
00:49:52,241 --> 00:49:53,500
he squeezes ridiculous.

1975
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,030
They say here's a six squeeze.

1976
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:55,721
Yeah you could tab.

1977
00:49:55,721 --> 00:49:59,470
And I was telling me he gets guys in
that position and just taps everybody.

1978
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,670
He apparently has this
insane head and arm closure.

1979
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:06,750
You know some guys get that and
some guys just have that nasty,

1980
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,850
he wasn't trying to pass or like
improve his body position on that choke.

1981
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,660
When you see that and you
stay in like sub a positions,

1982
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,580
you don't get the ultimate squeeze
but you do control their body.

1983
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,470
That's when you know a
guy knows what he's doing.

1984
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,980
If he's got to get all the way side
control and lay on his stomach and start

1985
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,450
with you,

1986
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:27,750
you,

1987
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:28,221
you gotta,

1988
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:29,580
you gotta do all that to,

1989
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:30,800
to squeeze that in,

1990
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:31,820
to get a tap out of that.

1991
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:32,391
To me,

1992
00:50:32,391 --> 00:50:33,290
that's amateur.

1993
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:35,300
What he did that was pro.

1994
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:35,530
Yeah,

1995
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,490
he stayed on the mount.

1996
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:36,861
He's like,

1997
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:37,910
and he stayed in half guard.

1998
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:38,880
He didn't even try to pass it.

1999
00:50:38,881 --> 00:50:41,240
I'm gonna stay right here
in Tampa and the sage kid,

2000
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:46,241
he really did legitimately 100% have strep
throat and he was in the hospital two

2001
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:47,450
days before that fight.

2002
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,430
So just imagine antibiotic
and the antibiotic,

2003
00:50:50,431 --> 00:50:54,260
but just imagine having strep throat and
having someone clamp down in your neck.

2004
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:54,741
I mean,

2005
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:57,440
you're already inflamed and a quick tap.

2006
00:50:57,470 --> 00:50:58,450
100% yeah.

2007
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,451
And you know what man?

2008
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:00,021
He's a kid.

2009
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:01,220
He's 19 years old.

2010
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:02,780
He's 19 years old and he's,

2011
00:51:02,781 --> 00:51:03,950
he's in there kicking ass.

2012
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,770
And how much policies coming his way,

2013
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,060
even measurable jazz
off to the Bible though.

2014
00:51:11,061 --> 00:51:11,894
He doesn't touch

2015
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,713
10 years.

2016
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:16,890
Fucking laugh.

2017
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:17,723
Come on.

2018
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,090
Come on out,

2019
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:20,420
brother.

2020
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:20,930
Yeah,

2021
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,510
I really can't think of that.

2022
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,620
Tony Ferguson versus mega Madoff.

2023
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,900
That's fucking monster straight.

2024
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:30,620
What I said when I did the countdown show,

2025
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:32,690
I said this easily could be
a world championship fight.

2026
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,700
Easy one of these guys easily either.

2027
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,930
Either guy can be the champion,

2028
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,220
either graph can be the challenger.

2029
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,900
This is a legit world championship.

2030
00:51:38,901 --> 00:51:40,250
Caliber fighter factors,

2031
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:40,940
uh,

2032
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:41,570
help,

2033
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:42,180
uh,

2034
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:43,250
the beeps body,

2035
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:43,990
whether it's healthy,

2036
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:44,370
how's that?

2037
00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:45,470
How's he going to perform?

2038
00:51:45,471 --> 00:51:48,020
Taking all this time off and
Tony's a motherfucker to fight.

2039
00:51:48,610 --> 00:51:49,270
Tony.

2040
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:53,700
Tony's hard to manhandle like mega
men office used to manhandle them

2041
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,880
and Tony Striking has
gotten so goddamn good.

2042
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:58,540
All your met off.

2043
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,200
But if he gets a hold of Tony,

2044
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:01,280
Tony's going for a ride,

2045
00:52:01,281 --> 00:52:02,300
but that's not going to face.

2046
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:03,530
Tony wrestled in college.

2047
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:04,591
I train,

2048
00:52:04,591 --> 00:52:05,424
he's all,

2049
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,650
he's all fuck.

2050
00:52:06,651 --> 00:52:07,484
When it comes to wrestling,

2051
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:08,380
you have a,

2052
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,571
uh,

2053
00:52:08,571 --> 00:52:12,830
a perfect symmetrical wrestler who does
everything correct over and over and

2054
00:52:12,831 --> 00:52:13,430
over and over again.

2055
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:13,940
All the guns.

2056
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:17,270
All of a sudden you have Tony
who has great fucking basics,

2057
00:52:17,271 --> 00:52:20,030
but he's also hitting that wild ass
Granby roll from every position.

2058
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,270
I wrestled like that guy
and it was fucking boom,

2059
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:23,391
boom,

2060
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:23,571
boom,

2061
00:52:23,571 --> 00:52:23,721
boom,

2062
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:24,020
boom.

2063
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:26,510
So you know what wheels
can catch on faster.

2064
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,141
I think it's going to be,

2065
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:29,480
cause they all filed
cards number come out.

2066
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:31,190
I would love to do is control.

2067
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,160
He gets you on top of,

2068
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:33,950
he beats the fuck out of
you and holds you in place.

2069
00:52:33,951 --> 00:52:35,690
But toys so dynamic.

2070
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,240
I don't know if he's gonna be able to
hold him down the way he's be able to hold

2071
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:39,800
other people down and I'd be in trouble.

2072
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,910
And you can see guys,

2073
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,620
when they fight Habib where they break,

2074
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,300
you can see where they're just like,

2075
00:52:44,301 --> 00:52:45,920
this motherfucker's still chose.

2076
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:46,783
Yes.

2077
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:51,260
Able to lead the fight to see
him when he beat those angles.

2078
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,810
I'll beat the fuck out
all the rabid dog though.

2079
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,100
A,

2080
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,300
granted it was a few years,

2081
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:59,610
he gets a hold of you.

2082
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:00,700
You're going for a ride.

2083
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,590
He's got the best
grappling in the division.

2084
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,270
Do you know about his dad?

2085
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:05,980
Yeah,

2086
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,770
I heard that serious fucking sambo
cause long article about how awesome his

2087
00:53:09,771 --> 00:53:10,601
fucking dad isn't.

2088
00:53:10,601 --> 00:53:11,434
Samely isn't just,

2089
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:12,411
I was like,

2090
00:53:12,411 --> 00:53:12,970
I fucking knew.

2091
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:13,880
I knew I liked these guys.

2092
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:17,090
Technical is fuck everything's perfect.

2093
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:17,870
All his position.

2094
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:20,240
But he's had so many injuries.

2095
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:20,510
Yeah,

2096
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:21,620
horrible injuries too.

2097
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,150
It's horrible.

2098
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,950
Like ACL,

2099
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:25,800
MCL,

2100
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:25,980
he's

2101
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,813
blown his knees.

2102
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,840
He blew his back out.

2103
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:30,030
That changes everything
when he got back from that.

2104
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:30,750
Like your shot,

2105
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,010
especially when you fight a guy like Tony.

2106
00:53:32,011 --> 00:53:32,790
Right?

2107
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:33,690
Because in football,

2108
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:35,700
you know when you come
back from one knee surgery,

2109
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:39,390
you may never be the same if you're
a running back or a quarterback that

2110
00:53:39,391 --> 00:53:39,961
scrambles.

2111
00:53:39,961 --> 00:53:41,940
That's what happens to all the
quarterbacks that scramble.

2112
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,800
They're doing great in
college and they survive.

2113
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:46,160
But as soon as they get
hurt in the pro game,

2114
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:46,831
man,

2115
00:53:46,831 --> 00:53:48,660
now they got to stay in the pocket there.

2116
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,280
Their knees are shot and that's
where they fucked [inaudible].

2117
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:52,650
Way more demanding than that.

2118
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,380
Especially when you're avoiding things.

2119
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:57,300
So we're throwing head
kicks your way or treat,

2120
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,510
you're trying to stuff it take down
your sprawling and trying to turn while

2121
00:54:00,511 --> 00:54:02,070
someone's driving towards you.

2122
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:04,590
That's why a few of the
body that's prone to injury,

2123
00:54:04,591 --> 00:54:05,241
especially we've had,

2124
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:05,580
you know,

2125
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,820
if you've wrestled your whole life and
it starts to build up like it came,

2126
00:54:08,821 --> 00:54:09,290
man,

2127
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:10,850
the motherfucking stay healthy for not,

2128
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,180
that's exactly what was going to say,

2129
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,860
but I think number Grumet off,

2130
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:14,760
it's not a coincidence.

2131
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:16,170
They're all in the same camp,

2132
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:16,771
you know,

2133
00:54:16,771 --> 00:54:18,120
and it's also not a coincidence.

2134
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:23,121
They have at least the three champions
out of that fucking gym and to current,

2135
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:26,310
I mean the j Aka is a monster house.

2136
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,300
It's a monster house,

2137
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,020
but they're also getting guys with
a lot of miles on like dcs miles.

2138
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,970
Kane has some motherfucking miles.

2139
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,100
Naga Madoff has crazy miles.

2140
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,620
[inaudible] got a nice
sweet odometer though,

2141
00:54:37,621 --> 00:54:38,454
Baby.

2142
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,413
We'll take him off.

2143
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,400
He's the new,

2144
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,660
Tessa is a Tesla and Prius,

2145
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:45,503
but he's not a,

2146
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:47,723
he's like,

2147
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:48,870
he's the newest thing.

2148
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:53,640
He's like a dope mach one
Mustang and he came back on top.

2149
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:54,331
Well,

2150
00:54:54,331 --> 00:54:56,550
I think that a guy like him is the future,

2151
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,483
you know,

2152
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:01,230
especially like he's in that division.

2153
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,480
He's so unusual because he's a wrestler.

2154
00:55:03,481 --> 00:55:04,980
He's got really good Jujitsu,

2155
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,000
his top games,

2156
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:06,780
insane.

2157
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:07,620
He's tall,

2158
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:08,520
he kicks Harvey.

2159
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,360
He's got a good balance between
being strong and being long.

2160
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:13,830
Like some long guys.

2161
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:14,700
They just not as strong.

2162
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:17,430
Anderson was always a long guy,

2163
00:55:17,431 --> 00:55:18,690
but not a strong guy.

2164
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:19,441
You know what I mean?

2165
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:23,370
Like Anderson's never man held the handle
anybody the way Rockhold can manhandle

2166
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:25,710
you will see what he did to Yaddo the,

2167
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,850
even when he gets them on the ground,

2168
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,890
those long guys are strong like that.

2169
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,000
Jon Jones is.

2170
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,060
People say how long he is.

2171
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,880
You get in the clinch with him
and I've wrestled with John.

2172
00:55:35,881 --> 00:55:36,480
It's like,

2173
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,440
what the flip plan is this from
the fuck you could totally see.

2174
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,860
You could totally say you're saying when
when DC was fighting him and he took DC

2175
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:44,581
down that first round,

2176
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:45,150
DC was like,

2177
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:45,540
oh,

2178
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,373
these faces like,

2179
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,041
oh fuck.

2180
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:47,874
So I'm like,

2181
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:48,270
Huh?

2182
00:55:48,270 --> 00:55:48,601
He's like,

2183
00:55:48,601 --> 00:55:49,434
fuck,

2184
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:51,270
he's strong as fuck.

2185
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:52,560
He threw me across the room on time.

2186
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,120
She's the one that I've hung out with.

2187
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:54,953
John.

2188
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:55,920
Hey,

2189
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,310
I haven't hung out with John since
John threw me across the face.

2190
00:55:58,920 --> 00:55:59,371
You know me.

2191
00:55:59,371 --> 00:56:00,900
I'm the number one fan of John by love.

2192
00:56:00,901 --> 00:56:01,441
How everyone's like,

2193
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:01,591
no,

2194
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,610
he's changed.

2195
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:03,211
Why?

2196
00:56:03,211 --> 00:56:06,810
Because on Instagram he's posting videos
of working out and shit splits by the

2197
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:11,190
narrative Mr Shop and he's the baddest
motherfucker on the planet and he's swole

2198
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:11,550
now.

2199
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:11,731
Good.

2200
00:56:11,731 --> 00:56:12,720
Like beating that dude.

2201
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:13,741
Fuck me.

2202
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:14,700
That's all I'm buying.

2203
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,690
Yeah.

2204
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:16,820
What was that seven men he was taking?

2205
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,700
I really want that.

2206
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,440
I don't know.

2207
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:19,840
I don't know.

2208
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:20,673
It's good stuff.

2209
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,110
Many magazine coming.

2210
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:22,710
No,

2211
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:22,900
no,

2212
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:25,900
no Bermudez versus Caligiuri.

2213
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,783
Ooh,

2214
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:28,600
I see a very good fight.

2215
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,910
Caligiuri was a motherfucker in Japan,

2216
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:31,410
man.

2217
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:32,243
A legend.

2218
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:32,620
Yeah.

2219
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:35,500
Remember Bermudez was on
I think a similar fight.

2220
00:56:35,501 --> 00:56:36,334
Win Streak.

2221
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:36,980
Well,

2222
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:40,530
Caligiuri has had some tough
fights in MMA period because the,

2223
00:56:40,531 --> 00:56:44,860
the first big one he had was with
Melendez and it was back when Zuka had

2224
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,320
purchased Strikeforce and
they reinstated elbows.

2225
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:48,153
You remember that?

2226
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:48,731
Oh,

2227
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:49,520
you got fucked up.

2228
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,390
Gilbert took it down and it was
the first time that Gilbert there.

2229
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:53,630
Strikeforce career.

2230
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,540
Yeah.

2231
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:54,750
Yeah.

2232
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,150
I was there.

2233
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:55,571
Ringside.

2234
00:56:55,571 --> 00:56:56,231
Was that where it was?

2235
00:56:56,231 --> 00:56:56,980
San Diego.

2236
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,270
It was the first time,

2237
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:02,470
I think in strike force where they
allowed elbows on the ground because when

2238
00:57:02,471 --> 00:57:03,970
Gilbert had been fighting before,

2239
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:04,990
even though he's a wrestler,

2240
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,550
he couldn't use elbows on the ground.

2241
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:08,320
They had like a pride,

2242
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:10,990
a similar rule set before the UFC.

2243
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:11,831
Was that San Diego?

2244
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:12,664
San Jose?

2245
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:13,510
I Dunno.

2246
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,343
I don't remember.

2247
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:15,640
I watched it on TV.

2248
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:18,220
I'm pretty sure it was awesome.

2249
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:18,851
I mean,

2250
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:19,750
San Diego was it,

2251
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:23,440
do you realize how important
elbows are on the game changer?

2252
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,950
And we guys fought their whole career
without elbows and then all of a sudden

2253
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:27,784
they use elbows.

2254
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,920
They get more for like a guy like Gilbert,

2255
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:32,440
it's a huge weapon for him
because his wrestling so good.

2256
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,071
He's so strong.

2257
00:57:33,071 --> 00:57:34,690
He's on toppy smashing it with elbows.

2258
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,770
It's way better than punching you.

2259
00:57:35,771 --> 00:57:36,310
Right.

2260
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,980
And so like it goes from that to,

2261
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:39,670
um,

2262
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:40,120
you know,

2263
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,170
he had a,

2264
00:57:41,171 --> 00:57:43,210
a couple tough fights
after that and it just,

2265
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:44,341
when you have a,

2266
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:46,900
a beat down like that
Gilbert Melendez fight,

2267
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,400
look at junior dos Santos.

2268
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:49,060
Yeah.

2269
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:50,090
Well it's never the same.

2270
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:50,710
Yeah.

2271
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:51,010
Did the,

2272
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:51,131
oh,

2273
00:57:51,131 --> 00:57:51,581
he's fighting.

2274
00:57:51,581 --> 00:57:53,710
Rothwell did the heavyweight.

2275
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:53,951
Tufts.

2276
00:57:53,951 --> 00:57:54,880
I'm fucking fights.

2277
00:57:54,881 --> 00:57:57,940
We haven't talked on our last ski
Overeem's train the same camp.

2278
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,100
These motherfuckers said now
neither of us are going anywhere.

2279
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,900
We're going to treat it the
same camp and fight each other.

2280
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:02,690
Wow.

2281
00:58:02,690 --> 00:58:03,010
Hey,

2282
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:03,970
terrible idea of fellas,

2283
00:58:03,971 --> 00:58:05,590
but I guess she was
coming at different times.

2284
00:58:05,591 --> 00:58:06,750
How do they work that?

2285
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,511
How do you gain planet?

2286
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:11,470
How's Greg Jackson and game plan
that you got a game plan to draw?

2287
00:58:11,710 --> 00:58:11,831
Yeah.

2288
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:12,400
What do you do?

2289
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,520
Do you like each car?

2290
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:16,090
Does each guy have like
one member of the crew?

2291
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:18,240
He takes us as corner guy partners.

2292
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:18,731
How's it work?

2293
00:58:18,731 --> 00:58:19,564
Training partners,

2294
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:21,100
especially heavyweights at Jackson.

2295
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:21,640
Oh Shit.

2296
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:22,473
You're all kind of a,

2297
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,710
what if they sparred like
every day leading up to it,

2298
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,080
whether they sparred to
help each other get sharp,

2299
00:58:29,081 --> 00:58:29,914
to fight each other.

2300
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:30,993
It'd be brilliant.

2301
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:32,830
The nerves wouldn't be there as much.

2302
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:34,091
Right,

2303
00:58:34,091 --> 00:58:34,750
but who would,

2304
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,010
who would say yes to that?

2305
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,660
Who would say no to them?

2306
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:40,060
Who would say no to that?

2307
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,590
It's over.

2308
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,340
He would probably say no
to that over him for sure.

2309
00:58:42,341 --> 00:58:43,121
He's a serial killer.

2310
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:43,320
Yeah.

2311
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,153
Yeah.

2312
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:45,100
But do you think,

2313
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,990
do you think are Lawsky
would say no to that?

2314
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:47,913
Yeah,

2315
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,230
he's that Russian fucking assassin.

2316
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,820
They're both,

2317
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:51,040
you know,

2318
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,970
so prideful.

2319
00:58:53,390 --> 00:58:54,340
That's crazy fight.

2320
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,560
I thought our last few hating me
forever when we came together.

2321
00:58:56,561 --> 00:58:56,881
But no,

2322
00:58:56,881 --> 00:58:57,880
he's just kind of client.

2323
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:58,870
He's a great guy.

2324
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:00,303
When they,

2325
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:01,511
if they,

2326
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:04,540
if they trained together like how long
do you think they've trained together?

2327
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:05,260
How many years now?

2328
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:05,800
Shit,

2329
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,120
fet put three,

2330
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:08,200
three years.

2331
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,550
So they had to have done a lot,

2332
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,940
but if anyone's going to leave it's can
be over and cause their Alaska has been

2333
00:59:12,941 --> 00:59:13,774
there way longer.

2334
00:59:13,810 --> 00:59:14,200
Really?

2335
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,920
Yeah.

2336
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,980
Cause over and came from the black
zillions or Alaska was there four years

2337
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:18,670
before that.

2338
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,990
Lots of user when I was there.

2339
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,561
That's right.

2340
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:22,010
And our last back when

2341
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,750
they first started working with them,

2342
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:25,070
everybody thought he was done.

2343
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,570
I remember this mother fucker was about
to fight for a title before he crazy.

2344
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,133
So crazy.

2345
00:59:30,410 --> 00:59:31,160
And then what else?

2346
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:31,311
Oh,

2347
00:59:31,311 --> 00:59:36,311
and then they're doing a Verdomme
steep bay in Brazil is what I heard.

2348
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:39,410
This fucking show looks so bad.

2349
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:41,770
It looks like it's fake blonde.

2350
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:42,693
A spot.

2351
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:43,720
It really,

2352
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:44,840
really looks like it's fake.

2353
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,250
Or you watching better call Saul?

2354
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:46,881
No.

2355
00:59:46,881 --> 00:59:48,560
Is it also shit?

2356
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,423
What's that on?

2357
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,030
It's a,

2358
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,220
it's a prequel of breaking bad.

2359
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,150
It's breaking bad,

2360
00:59:53,151 --> 00:59:54,140
but the story of,

2361
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,193
of the lawyer,

2362
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:56,370
I can't get into breaking man.

2363
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:58,840
What was that?

2364
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,690
I don't like tweakers.

2365
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,580
Weekers meth heads.

2366
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:01,811
Math,

2367
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:02,091
math.

2368
01:00:02,091 --> 01:00:03,320
People who do fucking math.

2369
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:03,710
Oh yeah.

2370
01:00:03,710 --> 01:00:04,820
That's what the show's about.

2371
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:05,340
Did you meet?

2372
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,620
Did you watch breaking bad?

2373
01:00:06,650 --> 01:00:07,483
Did you watch all that?

2374
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:08,740
Did you?

2375
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:08,900
No,

2376
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:10,610
I didn't watch the whole
thing and then watch the end.

2377
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:12,200
I didn't want him to breaking bad.

2378
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:15,140
No last couple of seasons and they
want to shit and I can't get into,

2379
01:00:15,141 --> 01:00:17,710
I watch one of the first thing for me,

2380
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,660
I want the first one and didn't start
watching it for another five years.

2381
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:21,620
I need to show to watch,

2382
01:00:21,621 --> 01:00:22,020
but nobody,

2383
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:22,491
it's good.

2384
01:00:22,491 --> 01:00:23,630
It's really fucking good.

2385
01:00:23,631 --> 01:00:24,464
You're going to get addicted.

2386
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:25,370
I did the same thing.

2387
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:26,730
Watch first esoteric

2388
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:29,920
teachers,

2389
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,750
sells trucks,

2390
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,930
all upset.

2391
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:33,441
Nothing for me,

2392
01:00:33,441 --> 01:00:33,610
man.

2393
01:00:33,610 --> 01:00:34,220
Oh Man.

2394
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:34,670
Oh Man.

2395
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:36,380
All documentaries.

2396
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:38,540
You know what's a great
documentary that I just passed up.

2397
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,750
There was a new release on
Netflix called cartel land,

2398
01:00:41,751 --> 01:00:42,111
and I thought,

2399
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,201
oh,

2400
01:00:42,201 --> 01:00:42,470
that sounds,

2401
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,281
come on son.

2402
01:00:43,281 --> 01:00:44,510
That's been out forever,

2403
01:00:44,570 --> 01:00:44,960
dude.

2404
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,501
Have you seen it?

2405
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:45,831
Yes.

2406
01:00:45,831 --> 01:00:46,360
Pfuff quite,

2407
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:47,120
oh Lord,

2408
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,710
shut down American.

2409
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:53,330
I almost didn't watch it because of
the cartel and that sounded like some B

2410
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:56,060
movie about some frozen.

2411
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:58,790
This isn't a spoiler.

2412
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,930
There's a one guy who,

2413
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,280
he represents the people.

2414
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:01,731
He's like,

2415
01:01:01,731 --> 01:01:02,610
we're not letting these cards.

2416
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,000
We're not letting these
cartel people come in,

2417
01:01:05,150 --> 01:01:06,200
take our fucking bill.

2418
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:08,000
Just so he all the civilians,

2419
01:01:08,001 --> 01:01:08,900
he joins him and he's like,

2420
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:10,280
this dude a mustache.

2421
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:14,780
They leave this mother fucker miked up
and he's going to like give a speech.

2422
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:15,441
He's a guy,

2423
01:01:15,441 --> 01:01:16,191
you gotta make a stop.

2424
01:01:16,191 --> 01:01:17,840
He goes to the side
piece house and he was,

2425
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,651
yeah.

2426
01:01:18,651 --> 01:01:19,484
Bueno.

2427
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:20,473
Bueno.

2428
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,021
And this bitch,

2429
01:01:21,021 --> 01:01:23,130
just such a mouth to second his case,

2430
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:23,841
he comes out,

2431
01:01:23,841 --> 01:01:24,081
he's like,

2432
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:24,441
all right,

2433
01:01:24,441 --> 01:01:25,041
ready to go.

2434
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,770
And they've been shown his wife and kids,

2435
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,840
let's edit that shit out.

2436
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:30,021
Hey.

2437
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:30,261
But,

2438
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:30,940
but he's like,

2439
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:32,270
it's the best part of the movie.

2440
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,363
Bueno.

2441
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:35,823
Oh boy.

2442
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:39,141
What is he doing?

2443
01:01:39,141 --> 01:01:40,640
He's not doing Gandhi Shit.

2444
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:42,020
He's telling everybody.

2445
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:42,830
Everybody,

2446
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,270
we all need machine guns.

2447
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,280
We're going to drive the
cartel out of our city.

2448
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,140
So they decided to all fucking,

2449
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:50,480
they got strapped all the cowboy.

2450
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,860
Is this a spoiler alert?

2451
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:52,071
No,

2452
01:01:52,071 --> 01:01:52,191
no,

2453
01:01:52,191 --> 01:01:52,310
no,

2454
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:52,431
no.

2455
01:01:52,431 --> 01:01:53,264
This is the beginning.

2456
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,440
It's a long dude.

2457
01:01:54,441 --> 01:01:55,370
There's a lot of shit that happened

2458
01:01:58,310 --> 01:01:59,180
to bind to get all,

2459
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,023
you know

2460
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,600
he's fighting cartels.

2461
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:03,711
I'm just saying.

2462
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:05,980
He had a side piece they show his
wife would get the whole time.

2463
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,660
I watched this thing.

2464
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:09,600
I want to watch this.

2465
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,940
The basis of it shit happens.

2466
01:02:14,090 --> 01:02:14,923
Did you see it?

2467
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:15,651
Yes,

2468
01:02:15,651 --> 01:02:16,150
it did.

2469
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,670
You did.

2470
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:16,941
I just,

2471
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,320
I don't want to ruin
it for him completely.

2472
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,263
This is the,

2473
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,790
when you're just,

2474
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:20,550
I'm,

2475
01:02:20,550 --> 01:02:21,600
it's about a guy.

2476
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:23,190
It's about a guy.

2477
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:28,300
Somebody in the middle for me who gets
his tax free joke at the beginning,

2478
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:29,603
the end,

2479
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:33,150
the hero hooks up with this site
piece hit the edge of the seats.

2480
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,720
Mike Stars by Eddie Bravo.

2481
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:36,480
How many stars?

2482
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,350
Oh Shit.

2483
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,140
One of the greatest documentaries.

2484
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,983
That's all

2485
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:44,850
I give it a four out of five.

2486
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,090
Got,

2487
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:47,430

2488
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,280
You're crunk right now.

2489
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,070
The guy that loved the hoist.

2490
01:02:50,071 --> 01:02:50,620
Great.

2491
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:50,920
Yeah.

2492
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:51,600
Let's pick it.

2493
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:52,433
That was just about

2494
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:54,693
the

2495
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,090
data and Kimbo.

2496
01:03:00,091 --> 01:03:00,924
What was that?

2497
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:01,381
Oh,

2498
01:03:01,381 --> 01:03:01,951
that was a,

2499
01:03:01,951 --> 01:03:05,100
that was like they should have called
it a special street match or something.

2500
01:03:05,290 --> 01:03:06,680
That's a strong no for me.

2501
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:07,021
You said,

2502
01:03:07,021 --> 01:03:07,201
okay,

2503
01:03:07,201 --> 01:03:10,050
we're going to show this for
pure entertainment value.

2504
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:10,831
Everyone last night,

2505
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:11,311
MMA,

2506
01:03:11,311 --> 01:03:12,750
it's just two dudes.

2507
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,300
Just Bro.

2508
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:13,920
I say you do.

2509
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,610
I think you put Datta and Kimbo and let
Justin wren fight both at the same time.

2510
01:03:18,810 --> 01:03:20,190
If they're going to do shit shows,

2511
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:20,910
let's get real.

2512
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:23,230
I don't think they thought that
was going to be as bad as it was.

2513
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:23,520
No,

2514
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,080
they thought Kim was get
knocked down on the first round.

2515
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:28,410
I don't think anybody
anticipated those guys.

2516
01:03:28,411 --> 01:03:29,340
Would gas like that,

2517
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:32,360
like that was the worst
gassing and the history of gas.

2518
01:03:32,390 --> 01:03:33,870
If you train some adjustments,

2519
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:36,530
pygmies they can be pretty bad in Denver.

2520
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,140
A little bit of a excuse because they
were fighting and they have better

2521
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,220
technique at least.

2522
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:41,411
Yeah.

2523
01:03:41,411 --> 01:03:42,930
There were there to really high level.

2524
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,660
These were all over the place,

2525
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:46,680
swung some bombs,

2526
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:50,730
but he just had a real hero in the early
parts of the round before Kimbo took

2527
01:03:50,731 --> 01:03:51,390
him down.

2528
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:54,630
He just doesn't have enough
gas Bermudez guys back here.

2529
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,280
He just doesn't have any gas,

2530
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:56,611
you know?

2531
01:03:56,611 --> 01:03:56,881
I mean,

2532
01:03:56,881 --> 01:03:58,290
who knows how he's really training.

2533
01:03:59,010 --> 01:03:59,251
I mean,

2534
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,990
let's be honest that he might like it.

2535
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,580
He's just not very good.

2536
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:03,640
Well,

2537
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,080
you know,

2538
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:04,351
I mean,

2539
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:05,610
that's never been what he's doing,

2540
01:04:05,611 --> 01:04:05,791
right?

2541
01:04:05,791 --> 01:04:07,140
He's been doing these street fights.

2542
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:08,100
That's what he's been doing,

2543
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:09,240
man.

2544
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:09,961
Get your paper,

2545
01:04:09,961 --> 01:04:10,410
Doug.

2546
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:10,681
I mean,

2547
01:04:10,681 --> 01:04:13,860
I kind of get that he wants to fight and
fight legitimate and I kind of get that

2548
01:04:13,861 --> 01:04:15,210
he's got to take that paycheck,

2549
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:20,190
but I just wish he had like a real
strength and conditioning coach or a real

2550
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:24,300
trainer come down to 5,000 by hiring
this real strength conditioning coach.

2551
01:04:24,301 --> 01:04:25,350
She didn't get that haircut.

2552
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:29,070
You don't get that warrior
here talking about him.

2553
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:29,963
He got that.

2554
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:30,841
He made some money.

2555
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:31,830
I'm sure he made some money.

2556
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,910
That's all he cares about.

2557
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,850
I think if you could find the backyard
just same amount of amount of money.

2558
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:36,684
He's doing it.

2559
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:37,650
I just wonder,

2560
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:37,921
you know,

2561
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:40,890
you take a guy like that and
you bring them to a legit place.

2562
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:41,970
How much did you make?

2563
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:42,870
I don't know.

2564
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:44,550
I kind of think you made
some good money though.

2565
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:47,900
But if you took a guy like that and you
brought him to a Greg Jackson is not

2566
01:04:47,901 --> 01:04:48,750
going to be a fun story.

2567
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,573
Mark Henry,

2568
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:51,370
you don't think so?

2569
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:52,000
No.

2570
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,190
It's fucking wrecked.

2571
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,720
Maybe just changes his attitude.

2572
01:04:54,721 --> 01:04:55,970
He gets ate up plates,

2573
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:56,813
Car Yashi.

2574
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:59,280
That motherfucker gets toward the fuck.

2575
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:00,061
Yeah,

2576
01:05:00,061 --> 01:05:01,350
but maybe he learns,

2577
01:05:01,351 --> 01:05:02,340
maybe learns how to fight.

2578
01:05:02,341 --> 01:05:06,030
We're not talking about him going in
there and sparring with an in Prime Shane

2579
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,140
Carwyn and getting fucking night.

2580
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:08,460
I paid good money for that.

2581
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:11,760
Are you talking about the
Brenden's shop program ready?

2582
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,421
Shock course.

2583
01:05:12,421 --> 01:05:13,050
Like this dude,

2584
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,320
he'll,

2585
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,160
he'll do a series.

2586
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:14,994
Got Him in a cradle.

2587
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,730
Cm punk has done and he'll,

2588
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,010
he'll finally realize that this

2589
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:18,910
isn't a fucking good idea.

2590
01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:20,290
This is fucking cow

2591
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:23,770
serious.

2592
01:05:23,770 --> 01:05:25,090
He's on top here.

2593
01:05:25,170 --> 01:05:26,230
Associate got a vet lane.

2594
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:26,920
He was,

2595
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:31,180
he was given Dennis Bermudez a
little bit of a need of the back.

2596
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:31,640
I don't know.

2597
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,130
How would you ever got some good passing?

2598
01:05:33,131 --> 01:05:34,000
He's got good if he gets,

2599
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:34,834
if he gets on top,

2600
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:38,020
he has very sad time at a pro's pro does.

2601
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:38,854
Um,

2602
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:39,710
is it a lot?

2603
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,080
You allowed to knee in the back,

2604
01:05:41,081 --> 01:05:41,950
like how's that work?

2605
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:43,301
Fine.

2606
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:43,481
Yeah,

2607
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:43,931
the sides.

2608
01:05:43,931 --> 01:05:44,980
You can yes side.

2609
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:46,570
You can't just not directly on the spine.

2610
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:48,720
Hard to take down this guy.

2611
01:05:48,721 --> 01:05:49,220
It's hard.

2612
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:51,840
Oh motherfucker.

2613
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,450
So you can hit a person like right.

2614
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,320
Get him out of his shoulder,

2615
01:05:56,321 --> 01:05:57,154
right Diane,

2616
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,940
you can hit them right next to the spine
with your knees and when someone's on

2617
01:06:00,941 --> 01:06:01,720
the ground,

2618
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:01,911
great.

2619
01:06:01,911 --> 01:06:02,051
Good.

2620
01:06:02,051 --> 01:06:04,930
You need them right next to
that 100% on him right there.

2621
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:06,100
He could flip them over easy.

2622
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:06,934
When I'm going to take that,

2623
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,960
let it go.

2624
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,070
He's going to keep scrambling.

2625
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:09,491
Good.

2626
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:10,540
Lucky and premium goes down.

2627
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:12,340
Okay.

2628
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:13,890
She got 100% [inaudible].

2629
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,000
Damn.

2630
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,100
You pray for those positions right there.

2631
01:06:17,101 --> 01:06:17,910
Bam,

2632
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:18,361
Bam,

2633
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:18,691
pyre.

2634
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:19,230
Fangs.

2635
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:19,471
I say,

2636
01:06:19,471 --> 01:06:20,300
where do you get that?

2637
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,360
Pretty bad ass.

2638
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:24,640
Fancy dishes like,

2639
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,410
but some referees of warn you,

2640
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,380
if you get too close to the spine,

2641
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:30,180
we can't go 12 to six on the spine.

2642
01:06:30,270 --> 01:06:31,290
You can't go 12 to six anywhere.

2643
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:32,250
Even on the thighs.

2644
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:33,270
They warn you about that.

2645
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,340
But it's weird to that.

2646
01:06:34,341 --> 01:06:34,870
His mission,

2647
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,500
because you can,

2648
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:36,690
if you're on the bottom like guard.

2649
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:37,201
Yes,

2650
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:39,840
but it's not because it's going six to 12.

2651
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:42,360
Because you're from the bottom.

2652
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:44,250
This motion instead of this one.

2653
01:06:45,820 --> 01:06:47,190
It's so fucking stupid.

2654
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:48,750
It's like if you jerk off knuckles up,

2655
01:06:48,751 --> 01:06:50,010
is it really jerking off?

2656
01:06:50,190 --> 01:06:51,360
Who does not in my book,

2657
01:06:51,361 --> 01:06:53,880
who's jerking off like
that and I've tried it.

2658
01:06:53,881 --> 01:06:56,880
It's very rare when you're
trying to live it up.

2659
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:57,750
I guess you'd do it.

2660
01:06:57,750 --> 01:06:57,961
Damn.

2661
01:06:57,961 --> 01:06:58,560
Couch series.

2662
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,360
Relentless was takedowns her.

2663
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,043
Yeah,

2664
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:03,710
but not during,

2665
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,480
uh,

2666
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:06,060
during the actual prospect climax.

2667
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,330
How hard is Bermuda?

2668
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:08,913
There's only one way.

2669
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,230
That's why our hands are shaped this way.

2670
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:13,030
Can you imagine during the climax part,

2671
01:07:13,090 --> 01:07:13,631
you're going like,

2672
01:07:13,631 --> 01:07:15,930
this matches do it.

2673
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,220
The only way to get you something,

2674
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:17,540
Tom,

2675
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:18,370
you had to hit it,

2676
01:07:18,370 --> 01:07:19,203
smack it,

2677
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:20,533
right?

2678
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:25,780
You've seen the fucking be
knee pain elimination stuff,

2679
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:26,614
right?

2680
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:27,803
Yeah.

2681
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:30,390
So people love pain.

2682
01:07:31,570 --> 01:07:33,040
I don't like pain at all.

2683
01:07:33,790 --> 01:07:34,623
No fucking touch me.

2684
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,740
I don't understand that.

2685
01:07:35,770 --> 01:07:37,680
Any facet tap tattoos,

2686
01:07:37,690 --> 01:07:38,590
I suck at that.

2687
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,720
You know like you meet people
that are like in the pain.

2688
01:07:40,721 --> 01:07:42,160
There's some people that
like to get suspended.

2689
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,033
You receive that shit.

2690
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,730
They put hooks in their
bag hanging like fish.

2691
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,550
Do you think that maybe they
feel painted a different way?

2692
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,740
Like maybe what you feel what they feel
is different releases and different

2693
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,833
endorphins?

2694
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:55,720
I've always wondered that because
you know people talk about like pain

2695
01:07:55,721 --> 01:07:56,530
tolerance,

2696
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:59,800
like oh this guy's got a really high pain
tolerance like and she's got a really

2697
01:07:59,801 --> 01:08:00,251
high power.

2698
01:08:00,251 --> 01:08:00,461
You know,

2699
01:08:00,461 --> 01:08:01,400
he loves pain.

2700
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:04,270
What are they feeling or we assume,

2701
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,240
I assume that when someone
does something to you,

2702
01:08:07,241 --> 01:08:09,070
it feels the same as it is to me,

2703
01:08:09,071 --> 01:08:10,150
but it's clearly different.

2704
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:11,080
There's no way.

2705
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:12,460
There's no way or other ones.

2706
01:08:12,461 --> 01:08:13,750
Why do girls like getting spanked?

2707
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:14,890
How come some girls,

2708
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,790
that's a dominant thing.

2709
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:16,190
I'll write.

2710
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,120
Some girls love it.

2711
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:18,400
That's leftover caveman,

2712
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,160
right?

2713
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:19,820
They love it.

2714
01:08:19,820 --> 01:08:20,990
They like to get spanked,

2715
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:21,560
spank,

2716
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:21,960
choke.

2717
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,351
Thanks.

2718
01:08:22,351 --> 01:08:23,370
50 shades of grey hair.

2719
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:24,960
That's a little hair pull.

2720
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,870
Generally good spit a little bit.

2721
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,830
They like it a little bit.

2722
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:30,130
That's leftover kids speak,

2723
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:31,340
but let's be real about this shift.

2724
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,280
Girl spanks you.

2725
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,940
It's going to be a fucking real problem.

2726
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:39,110
[inaudible] she's asking
you to spank her up.

2727
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:41,220
She starts spanking you that way.

2728
01:08:41,221 --> 01:08:41,491
You'd be like,

2729
01:08:41,491 --> 01:08:41,661
Hey,

2730
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:41,751
hey.

2731
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,001
Hey,

2732
01:08:42,001 --> 01:08:43,380
what the fuck are you doing?

2733
01:08:44,510 --> 01:08:45,343
No,

2734
01:08:45,530 --> 01:08:45,700
no,

2735
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:45,821
no,

2736
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:45,970
no,

2737
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:46,061
no,

2738
01:08:46,061 --> 01:08:46,230
no.

2739
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:48,310
My reaction by reaction trading.

2740
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:49,130
Oh No,

2741
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:49,350
no,

2742
01:08:49,350 --> 01:08:49,471
no,

2743
01:08:49,471 --> 01:08:49,800
no.

2744
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,880
There's not going to be any of that.

2745
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:51,763
Like right away.

2746
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,423
They're

2747
01:08:58,560 --> 01:08:59,161
really hot.

2748
01:08:59,161 --> 01:09:00,810
I'll put on some stockings and shit,

2749
01:09:00,811 --> 01:09:01,530
whatever they want.

2750
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:02,250
It's very,

2751
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:03,360
it's very important to,

2752
01:09:03,361 --> 01:09:03,510
you know,

2753
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,180
nip that right on the boat

2754
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,980
stockings and fucking shoot.

2755
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:13,460
Hit the high heels on
and shit and colognes.

2756
01:09:13,461 --> 01:09:15,360
A hell drain is a hell of a drug.

2757
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:17,430
How about the girls that liked to scratch?

2758
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:18,480
Holy Shit.

2759
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:19,793
Stop.

2760
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:22,170
That is marking

2761
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:22,830
you.

2762
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:23,540
Yes.

2763
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:24,150
Ah,

2764
01:09:24,150 --> 01:09:25,600
I think that that's like bottom.

2765
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,311
Yeah,

2766
01:09:26,311 --> 01:09:26,720
that's right.

2767
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:30,060
He's our fucking let everybody
know that she fucked you.

2768
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:33,810
You know to mark her territory
scratching you leave marks on you.

2769
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:36,270
Did you ever give Hickey's?

2770
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:37,110
Oh yeah.

2771
01:09:37,110 --> 01:09:37,710
High School.

2772
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:38,960
Everybody gave Hickey's in high school.

2773
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:39,780
You come to school.

2774
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:40,290
Wow.

2775
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:42,330
Who's got a great idea?

2776
01:09:42,331 --> 01:09:43,610
If you think about it goes bro,

2777
01:09:43,750 --> 01:09:44,581
please give Hickey's.

2778
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:45,301
It's gone though,

2779
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:45,631
right?

2780
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:46,081
When's the last time?

2781
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:46,980
So some of the Hickey.

2782
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:47,640
Yeah.

2783
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:50,580
That's kind of what want will
do that shit in Rose Rose.

2784
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:53,280
I'm going to get in
fucking trouble for this.

2785
01:09:53,281 --> 01:09:53,881
Why would I do this?

2786
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:54,001
Yeah.

2787
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:55,170
Why you bruised up my neck?

2788
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:56,340
I guess it's embarrassing now.

2789
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:57,303
Yo.

2790
01:09:59,130 --> 01:10:03,090
Fuck how a jury trying to spin a lot of
work trying to get them to the ground

2791
01:10:03,091 --> 01:10:03,290
man.

2792
01:10:03,290 --> 01:10:03,481
Yeah,

2793
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:04,290
he's exhausted.

2794
01:10:04,290 --> 01:10:05,880
He's a big dude to that though.

2795
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,753
That's

2796
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,300
so hard to take that cow.

2797
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:11,580
Jerry gets Tko.

2798
01:10:12,330 --> 01:10:13,410
He looks very tired here.

2799
01:10:13,411 --> 01:10:14,244
I'll tell you that.

2800
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:20,300
You got to wonder also with a guy like
how Agiri how old is he now between the

2801
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:21,661
two of them?

2802
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:24,090
Don't they have like 60 2070
fights or something like that?

2803
01:10:24,091 --> 01:10:25,550
He's only 29 no,

2804
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:25,770
no.

2805
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:26,340
He's arrogant.

2806
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,800
He's 44 Jamie,

2807
01:10:28,801 --> 01:10:31,860
find out how old cow Agiri
is in fighting years.

2808
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:33,180
He's 66 he's,

2809
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:33,600
yeah,

2810
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,440
he's older.

2811
01:10:34,810 --> 01:10:35,610
He can't tell.

2812
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,720
Let me guess before he tell me.

2813
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:41,790
35 30 [inaudible] 39 okay.

2814
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:43,163
Drum roll please.

2815
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:49,570
35373630930 six days.

2816
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:50,080
He,

2817
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,930
there are 609 claims.

2818
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:52,990
You can't tell Asians.

2819
01:10:52,991 --> 01:10:53,431
It's black guys.

2820
01:10:53,431 --> 01:10:54,091
You cannot tell.

2821
01:10:54,091 --> 01:10:54,481
It's like that.

2822
01:10:54,481 --> 01:10:55,081
Jimmy Hendrix,

2823
01:10:55,081 --> 01:10:55,914
what is it?

2824
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:58,680
Oh you,

2825
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,910
so between 36 and 39 I was off.

2826
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:02,580
Boom.

2827
01:11:02,580 --> 01:11:03,413
You were in the wheel.

2828
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:04,913
Whatever.

2829
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,200
39 he'd been fighting for a long time.

2830
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,333
A long time.

2831
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,271
It's hard,

2832
01:11:09,271 --> 01:11:10,104
man.

2833
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:14,010
A few of those brutal Kaos like this
guy has experienced like especially the

2834
01:11:14,011 --> 01:11:14,880
Melendez fight.

2835
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,500
How many other times does he k Aod,

2836
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:18,210
who wins a fight like this?

2837
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:18,811
If it goes like this,

2838
01:11:18,811 --> 01:11:19,560
all three rounds.

2839
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,850
A dude cow Jerry.

2840
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:23,220
He wins because he's pressing coercive.

2841
01:11:23,330 --> 01:11:23,700
He's,

2842
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,070
he's,

2843
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,470
yeah,

2844
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:26,100
it or is that aggressive?

2845
01:11:26,130 --> 01:11:27,900
Depends on the judge.

2846
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:29,310
And he's can't fucked up here.

2847
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,220
He's getting the fucking shit
up elbowed out of him here.

2848
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:32,431
Well,

2849
01:11:32,431 --> 01:11:32,970
you know,

2850
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,391
so,

2851
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:34,930
so we didn't consider a takedown.

2852
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:39,480
Bermudez was on his hip getting up
some of the fucking idiot Ras to do.

2853
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,060
They have a Bermudez is
controlling him here.

2854
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:42,650
I agree.

2855
01:11:42,650 --> 01:11:45,540
Munis is on top and he's
laying strikes and coward your,

2856
01:11:45,541 --> 01:11:48,310
you're literally can't do shit shot.

2857
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,230
He's in the shot.

2858
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:49,470
Yeah,

2859
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:50,303
but it does no good.

2860
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:51,530
But this is just an easy,

2861
01:11:51,531 --> 01:11:52,351
he's getting fucked up,

2862
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,490
but he's going into them.

2863
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,840
But you can control guys.

2864
01:11:55,750 --> 01:11:56,810
College Erie.

2865
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,050
Is that making that happen?

2866
01:11:58,080 --> 01:11:58,350
Yes,

2867
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,101
but he's stuck.

2868
01:11:59,101 --> 01:11:59,431
Look,

2869
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:02,340
a Bermudez is controlling
that right arm with that rap.

2870
01:12:02,341 --> 01:12:03,630
Bermuda says rescue shelter,

2871
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:04,410
aggressive,

2872
01:12:04,410 --> 01:12:05,580
beating the fuck out of him.

2873
01:12:05,581 --> 01:12:06,650
Here I,

2874
01:12:06,660 --> 01:12:10,570
I'm definitely giving these exchanges
right here to permutate how would series

2875
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:13,200
only holding on and it
ain't work and it gets back.

2876
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:13,590
Yep.

2877
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,740
And then he's about to get fucked up.

2878
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,411
Wait for that.

2879
01:12:16,411 --> 01:12:17,244
Tko Son.

2880
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:20,730
See I get that you're saying that
cow would juries moving forward.

2881
01:12:20,731 --> 01:12:24,430
But the way Dennis was countering was
so much more powerful than what cow was.

2882
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:25,480
I agree with you.

2883
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,470
I'm saying on the first one,

2884
01:12:26,490 --> 01:12:27,271
devil's advocate.

2885
01:12:27,271 --> 01:12:27,500
That's,

2886
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,470
that's why I brought it up.

2887
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:29,830
Pushing him.

2888
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:31,360
He's getting fucked up the first round.

2889
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,370
Who you give that to
the first round couch,

2890
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,420
even though he didn't get
the successful take down.

2891
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:37,920
I see it as,

2892
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:38,611
yeah,

2893
01:12:38,611 --> 01:12:39,870
he's pushing forward.

2894
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,330
It's not effective and the
reason he's pushing forward,

2895
01:12:42,331 --> 01:12:43,164
he doesn't want nothing.

2896
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:44,250
None of the standup,

2897
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:45,000
but he,

2898
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,260
even when he's pushing forward though,

2899
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:47,460
he was underneath,

2900
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:48,990
he was underneath the leg.

2901
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:50,550
He had his arm tied up like this.

2902
01:12:50,551 --> 01:12:52,170
Like see how Bermuda's loves to tie that,

2903
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:55,670
that wrist up on inspiring
Sanderson's all Ryan Parson,

2904
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:57,510
he is just beating the
shit out of him here.

2905
01:12:57,511 --> 01:13:00,450
I mean there's a number
of unanswered shots.

2906
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:00,901
Oh,

2907
01:13:00,901 --> 01:13:01,734
twister.

2908
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:02,693
That'd be sick.

2909
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,510
That's not going to happen.

2910
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:04,690
What I'm trying to go,

2911
01:13:06,230 --> 01:13:06,900
he wants to,

2912
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,231
what does he do?

2913
01:13:07,231 --> 01:13:08,130
He just wants to take the back.

2914
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,500
He's got his bags on a
flat amount per municipal.

2915
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:13,260
Awesome.

2916
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,130
How would you beat gummy or now go
me beat him in a PR and provide,

2917
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:17,490
right.

2918
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:18,390
That's how that was soccer.

2919
01:13:18,391 --> 01:13:19,320
I do soccer.

2920
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:19,860
I,

2921
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:20,111
yeah,

2922
01:13:20,111 --> 01:13:20,944
I what I'm thinking of

2923
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,810
how you got those screaming
at me screaming at him.

2924
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:26,030
Right.

2925
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:26,520
Parsons.

2926
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:26,760
It's,

2927
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,300
he's all about control and
him and Pat Carnes smart.

2928
01:13:30,630 --> 01:13:31,470
That's all he does spend.

2929
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:31,621
Well,

2930
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:34,740
especially from those positions you see
like as he's moving in for that shot,

2931
01:13:34,741 --> 01:13:36,180
controlling that right wrist,

2932
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:38,880
he was able to land so many hard shots.

2933
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:42,420
Just so much control how many hard
elbows that he land from that position.

2934
01:13:42,421 --> 01:13:43,800
It had to be like 10 right?

2935
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,830
At least at least 10 hard ones.

2936
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,040
So when you think about that,

2937
01:13:48,041 --> 01:13:51,180
like just the impact of that
as he goes back to his round,

2938
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,970
he's definitely diminished
from that big time.

2939
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:55,650
It was a bad scene.

2940
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:55,971
Hey,

2941
01:13:55,971 --> 01:13:56,801
we'd have whatever man.

2942
01:13:56,801 --> 01:13:57,151
Go in there,

2943
01:13:57,151 --> 01:13:57,930
brother.

2944
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:58,171
No,

2945
01:13:58,171 --> 01:13:58,321
no,

2946
01:13:58,321 --> 01:13:58,681
I'm good.

2947
01:13:58,681 --> 01:13:59,060
I'm good.

2948
01:13:59,060 --> 01:13:59,460
You know what?

2949
01:13:59,460 --> 01:14:01,460
I'll take one fucking baby.

2950
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,120
Well,

2951
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,080
I have a big celebration to celebrate.

2952
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,750
It's as a celebration bitches

2953
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,140
like Jamie can drink.

2954
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,093
Let me ask you this,

2955
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,440
Joe.

2956
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:12,273
If you're,

2957
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:17,530
if you're a cowboy Hornimann and
the fights five or five rounds,

2958
01:14:17,531 --> 01:14:18,041
you know what I'm saying,

2959
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:18,550
Joe?

2960
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,570
The fights five rounds,

2961
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:22,240
you're not going to have a
game plan for five rounds,

2962
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:22,600
right?

2963
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,490
You're going to say that the first round,

2964
01:14:24,491 --> 01:14:24,941
give it hell,

2965
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:25,181
man.

2966
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:26,380
Then after that it's whatever.

2967
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,900
I would assume they would try to do
that because that's where cowboys had

2968
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:29,950
problems in the past.

2969
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:33,300
Guys jump on him and he's taking the
fight on short doughnut cowboy given into

2970
01:14:33,310 --> 01:14:34,630
rhythm cause he's gonna fuck you up.

2971
01:14:34,631 --> 01:14:35,680
You blitz ass.

2972
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,080
How many weeks it Olivera
have to prepare weeks.

2973
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,610
He just fought not too long ago though.

2974
01:14:40,660 --> 01:14:41,800
Oh well there you go.

2975
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:42,723
That could be,

2976
01:14:43,150 --> 01:14:44,650
that could be still five round fight.

2977
01:14:44,940 --> 01:14:49,470
You don't give a fuck who you is
still going on Caligiuri and Nigga,

2978
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,310
this Bermudez is attacking now.

2979
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:53,950
Can I get one of the other ones?

2980
01:14:53,950 --> 01:14:54,400
Yeah Dude.

2981
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,500
How bad ass was at Jeremy's Guinness.

2982
01:14:56,530 --> 01:14:59,520
Melcher I liked that stuff
relating to get us your,

2983
01:14:59,730 --> 01:15:00,880
that's a grown ass man drink.

2984
01:15:00,890 --> 01:15:02,980
I'm not ready for it even
though I'm a dad now.

2985
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,440
This is probably bad for
my low carbohydrate diet.

2986
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:06,393
Fuck.

2987
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,860
Probably not supposed to drink these.

2988
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:09,963
How's that work here?

2989
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,013
I'll have one.

2990
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:13,360
Hey Bro,

2991
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:15,730
can I have your drink beer?

2992
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:18,550
How long is that going to last?

2993
01:15:18,551 --> 01:15:20,780
I have a p I have a penis
so I can trying to do it.

2994
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,940
I'm not just going to live on days,

2995
01:15:21,941 --> 01:15:22,040
right.

2996
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:23,020
Try to do it for 60 days.

2997
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,350
Sadly,

2998
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,890
with my brothers.

2999
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:24,723
How many days are you,

3000
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:25,451
hey,

3001
01:15:25,451 --> 01:15:26,710
congratulations on that day.

3002
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:28,360
It's going to cluck.

3003
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:29,740
Every day gets better and better.

3004
01:15:29,741 --> 01:15:30,140
Dude.

3005
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,210
Hopefully better and better.

3006
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:32,253
Hopefully

3007
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:34,751
I can do it.

3008
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:35,350
You can do it.

3009
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:36,370
That's your creation.

3010
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:37,963
That's,

3011
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:38,520
that's kind of,

3012
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,850
that's the most important
thing that we'll watch.

3013
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:40,671
16 and pregnant.

3014
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,100
If those fucking morons can do it,

3015
01:15:42,101 --> 01:15:42,934
I'll be fine.

3016
01:15:43,890 --> 01:15:44,460
Well,

3017
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:44,780
well,

3018
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:45,521
it's not hard.

3019
01:15:45,521 --> 01:15:46,600
Don't let those be your role model.

3020
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:50,260
That's the standard.

3021
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,580
You can read books side of it.

3022
01:15:55,150 --> 01:15:57,700
Got Mother-in-law.

3023
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:58,420
That's,

3024
01:15:58,420 --> 01:15:59,110
that's huge.

3025
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,400
That's that Latin families.

3026
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:01,050
Huge.

3027
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:01,930
But it's think of,

3028
01:16:01,931 --> 01:16:02,320
think of it.

3029
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,900
It's only hard for two years.

3030
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:07,220
Two and a half years after
that and talked to him like,

3031
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:08,290
no,

3032
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:08,591
listen,

3033
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:09,424
that's not a long time.

3034
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,350
Even even then,

3035
01:16:11,351 --> 01:16:11,950
it's awesome.

3036
01:16:11,950 --> 01:16:12,783
Trust me,

3037
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:13,610
I can't wait.

3038
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:14,443
It's love kids,

3039
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:17,611
before they become all,

3040
01:16:17,611 --> 01:16:19,000
I want to be like Sean camp man,

3041
01:16:19,001 --> 01:16:20,980
just a ton of kids and
make you a better mom.

3042
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:21,970
It makes you a better person.

3043
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,511
It really does.

3044
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:22,770
Yeah.

3045
01:16:22,770 --> 01:16:23,170
Yeah.

3046
01:16:23,170 --> 01:16:23,561
I'm open.

3047
01:16:23,561 --> 01:16:24,310
It chills me out.

3048
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:25,360
I can't relax with the,

3049
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,070
it shouldn't say it
makes you better person,

3050
01:16:27,071 --> 01:16:29,950
but it makes a lot of people better
person because they'd become way more

3051
01:16:29,951 --> 01:16:33,370
considerate and they start looking at the
world differently cause you kind of re

3052
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,620
we all know intellectually what it's like.

3053
01:16:35,650 --> 01:16:36,490
You have a baby,

3054
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:38,680
the baby comes person and there it goes,

3055
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:40,090
but when you actually see it happen,

3056
01:16:40,210 --> 01:16:41,500
then you start to piece
it together and go,

3057
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:41,861
okay,

3058
01:16:41,861 --> 01:16:45,430
this everything this person is really
is because of all the interactions that

3059
01:16:45,431 --> 01:16:48,610
he's experienced while I've been his dad
and that's what you're going to start

3060
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:48,911
doing.

3061
01:16:48,911 --> 01:16:50,080
And then you use it just,

3062
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:51,280
and you're a great guy already,

3063
01:16:51,281 --> 01:16:51,580
man.

3064
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:52,000
It's gonna.

3065
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,460
It's going to make you even more awesome,

3066
01:16:54,461 --> 01:16:55,160
I guarantee you.

3067
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:55,290
Yeah,

3068
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:56,070
I'm excited.

3069
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:56,250
Yeah,

3070
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,450
you're going to be great at this man.

3071
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:58,080
You're going to be,

3072
01:16:58,080 --> 01:16:58,710
you're going to love it.

3073
01:16:58,710 --> 01:16:59,730
I know I can't wait.

3074
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:01,180
I love it when you live,

3075
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:02,560
we need to live your life

3076
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:07,420
now all of a sudden there's someone
that you'll die for and you'll kill for.

3077
01:17:07,421 --> 01:17:07,900
You know,

3078
01:17:07,900 --> 01:17:08,650
it's different.

3079
01:17:08,650 --> 01:17:10,100
It's all of a sudden you're not

3080
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:10,521
number one.

3081
01:17:10,521 --> 01:17:11,060
No more kids.

3082
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:11,630
I'm rolling.

3083
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,463
Yup.

3084
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,960
This is worth more to you than you are.

3085
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:15,740
Yup.

3086
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:16,100
That's it.

3087
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:16,700
Now you're,

3088
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:17,870
that changes your life.

3089
01:17:18,110 --> 01:17:19,460
Now all of a sudden you're number two.

3090
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:21,410
You got a number one
that you got to protect,

3091
01:17:21,590 --> 01:17:21,981
you know,

3092
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:23,390
and it really changes it.

3093
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:24,440
It changes your,

3094
01:17:24,441 --> 01:17:24,800
your,

3095
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,480
your feeling of compassion too.

3096
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:27,230
He just said,

3097
01:17:27,230 --> 01:17:31,160
you have more compassion
for people because you see
people that are grown up and

3098
01:17:31,161 --> 01:17:31,510
he'd go,

3099
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:31,730
oh,

3100
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:32,630
somewhere online.

3101
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,370
This fucking dude was a baby and someone
did a terrible job of raising this

3102
01:17:37,371 --> 01:17:38,031
fucking kid.

3103
01:17:38,031 --> 01:17:38,900
And now here he is,

3104
01:17:39,020 --> 01:17:42,070
25 and Tronc and stupid and my face.

3105
01:17:42,071 --> 01:17:45,740
And it puts it together to you in
a way that it never did before.

3106
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,240
Before I would meet people and I go,

3107
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:47,451
oh,

3108
01:17:47,451 --> 01:17:48,410
this guy's an asshole.

3109
01:17:48,530 --> 01:17:48,960
The the,

3110
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,331
you know,

3111
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:49,491
oh,

3112
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:50,324
she's a bitch.

3113
01:17:50,360 --> 01:17:50,931
But now I go,

3114
01:17:50,931 --> 01:17:51,201
oh,

3115
01:17:51,201 --> 01:17:52,460
those were babies.

3116
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:56,260
This is a baby that just got their
parents growing up the wrong way,

3117
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:57,703
the whole deal.

3118
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:01,280
And then you meet someone who's
a really cool person and you go,

3119
01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:01,671
oh,

3120
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:02,510
well you must have,

3121
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:03,290
you know,

3122
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:04,610
you must have had a cool ride.

3123
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:04,821
Yeah.

3124
01:18:04,821 --> 01:18:05,990
What was your childhood like?

3125
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:06,681
You always want to know,

3126
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:06,861
like,

3127
01:18:06,861 --> 01:18:07,694
where did you grow up?

3128
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,310
How did you get through to my,

3129
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,930
my girl's family being Latin man,

3130
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,240
there's so much love and it's insane.

3131
01:18:14,241 --> 01:18:14,850
I feel like my,

3132
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:15,260
you know,

3133
01:18:15,260 --> 01:18:15,801
don't get me wrong,

3134
01:18:15,801 --> 01:18:16,940
my parents left the shit out of me,

3135
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:17,900
but you know,

3136
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:18,381
yeah.

3137
01:18:18,381 --> 01:18:20,120
The Trombleys just different.

3138
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:20,341
Yeah.

3139
01:18:20,341 --> 01:18:23,480
Donald Trump kind of track track,

3140
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:24,350
keep love out.

3141
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:24,741
Yeah.

3142
01:18:24,741 --> 01:18:25,391
Donald,

3143
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:26,181
it's so stupid.

3144
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:27,320
He wants South Carolina.

3145
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:28,470
Did he?

3146
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,031
Of course he did.

3147
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:29,900
Look what he's against.

3148
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,320
He's against nothing too.

3149
01:18:31,330 --> 01:18:33,590
How crazy numbers Hillary.

3150
01:18:33,670 --> 01:18:33,800
Oh,

3151
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,650
100% he's like Hillary's
gonna beat Ben Sanders.

3152
01:18:37,300 --> 01:18:37,580
What?

3153
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:38,420
Bernie Sanders,

3154
01:18:38,430 --> 01:18:40,930
his name just mixed.

3155
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:41,521
Yeah,

3156
01:18:41,521 --> 01:18:42,500
no trouble.

3157
01:18:43,220 --> 01:18:44,660
Bernie won New Hampshire,

3158
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:46,130
but New Hampshire is the,

3159
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:46,431
you know,

3160
01:18:46,431 --> 01:18:49,640
that's like a very small
state in the New England area.

3161
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,630
They're very liberal,

3162
01:18:50,780 --> 01:18:52,250
doing as liberal in general.

3163
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,260
And he's like,

3164
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:53,511
you know,

3165
01:18:53,511 --> 01:18:54,800
he's a radical socialist.

3166
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:55,161
He's like,

3167
01:18:55,161 --> 01:18:56,510
he's got this socialist,

3168
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,510
democratic socialist agenda
that a lot of people like,

3169
01:18:59,511 --> 01:18:59,781
hey,

3170
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:00,560
let's try that.

3171
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,150
It's better than what
we're dealing with now.

3172
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:05,480
These capitalists cuts that are still
like just looking at the stock market,

3173
01:19:05,481 --> 01:19:06,290
just looking at the,

3174
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:07,400
the financial district,

3175
01:19:07,401 --> 01:19:11,780
just looking at the way they're moving
numbers around and the fucking Wall

3176
01:19:11,781 --> 01:19:16,250
Street crash of 2008 obviously there's
a bunch of criminals are running things

3177
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:20,660
and they're just extracting money from
this goofy abstract system that hardly

3178
01:19:20,661 --> 01:19:21,650
anybody understands.

3179
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:23,330
So having a guy like him come along,

3180
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,980
a lot of people including me go.

3181
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,810
It's probably the best
thing that happened.

3182
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:28,640
So you throw a little
mixed me up in there.

3183
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:30,710
See what the fuck happened
as the Trump curve ball.

3184
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,420
You're telling not talking about Trump.

3185
01:19:32,421 --> 01:19:33,440
I'm talking about Bernie Sanders.

3186
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,040
Yeah,

3187
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:34,720
Bernie Sanders.

3188
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:37,070
Trump just saying it's interesting
to be super interesting.

3189
01:19:37,071 --> 01:19:38,860
It's got a complete wild card.

3190
01:19:39,140 --> 01:19:41,840
You're telling me those are the
two best America has to offer,

3191
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:48,080
so I don't want to talk bullshit.

3192
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:52,790
Too much going on too much
boy and off real quick.

3193
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:57,740
Another doctor marrow schizos.

3194
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,230
He's like going to this protest.

3195
01:20:00,231 --> 01:20:00,441
He's like,

3196
01:20:00,441 --> 01:20:00,651
hold on,

3197
01:20:00,651 --> 01:20:01,880
let me pull up real quick.

3198
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:03,163
What's up girl?

3199
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:04,010
That's the best.

3200
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:04,920
He does it in the must.

3201
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:08,070
Must like Suave Latin guy thing is like

3202
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:09,210
all over the fence.

3203
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:09,541
You know?

3204
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:10,374
He's talking to her.

3205
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:14,760
She talks about running away with it and

3206
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:17,880
I'd be right back.

3207
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:23,330
It's the best we need shale to run for
president because shale would fight any

3208
01:20:24,541 --> 01:20:25,650
other president and beat him up.

3209
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:27,450
Pull the pin would be a good fight.

3210
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:27,700
Oh,

3211
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:30,000
would be a real president who
really could be a president.

3212
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:32,070
Stan Brian's dad.

3213
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:33,043
Yes.

3214
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:34,733
He really could do it.

3215
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:35,790
He really could do it.

3216
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,720
I'd vice president Tim Kennedy for reals.

3217
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:39,071
It's,

3218
01:20:39,071 --> 01:20:40,200
it's if can enjoy that.

3219
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:42,030
I see classic case of war

3220
01:20:45,810 --> 01:20:46,643
for real.

3221
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:48,280
I'll fucking vote for that.

3222
01:20:48,740 --> 01:20:49,360
Heartbeat.

3223
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:49,810
You know her,

3224
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,160
honey,

3225
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:51,120
anything Tim does,

3226
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:51,611
I'm on board,

3227
01:20:51,611 --> 01:20:52,444
so she sold.

3228
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,260
You know the real problem being
a president is nobody can do it.

3229
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:56,110
That's the real problem.

3230
01:20:56,110 --> 01:20:57,360
It's a stupid job.

3231
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,440
No one can do.

3232
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,090
No one should have the job.

3233
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,560
It shouldn't exist anymore.

3234
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:05,790
It's antiquated and the only way we're
going to realize that it's just going to

3235
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:06,624
be no one running.

3236
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,370
It's going to be like 2030 years from now.

3237
01:21:08,371 --> 01:21:09,750
No one's going to run for president.

3238
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:11,460
It's not going to make
a difference at all.

3239
01:21:11,461 --> 01:21:12,600
Some homeless guy and the goat,

3240
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:13,830
you know,

3241
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:14,960
real quick documentary.

3242
01:21:15,610 --> 01:21:17,250
This is one that I've
watched over and over.

3243
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,061
It's really,

3244
01:21:18,061 --> 01:21:18,600
really good.

3245
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,430
If you say it's the festival freak out.

3246
01:21:20,460 --> 01:21:20,641
No,

3247
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:21,090
it's not.

3248
01:21:21,090 --> 01:21:21,481
It's not.

3249
01:21:21,481 --> 01:21:22,111
But it's really,

3250
01:21:22,111 --> 01:21:24,840
really good because especially
for conspiracy theorists type,

3251
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:27,510
it's called how big oil
conquered the world.

3252
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:32,750
It's how it all started back in the mid
18 hundreds how it all started with John

3253
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:34,860
d Rockefeller and you always
hear about the Rockefellers.

3254
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:36,280
All they own everything
on the Rothschild's.

3255
01:21:36,281 --> 01:21:36,860
Oh there,

3256
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:37,471
there's the bankers,

3257
01:21:37,471 --> 01:21:38,304
they own everything.

3258
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:42,630
But to actually find
out how he was raised,

3259
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:45,090
John Rockefeller and how evil his dad was,

3260
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:45,870
and this is all like,

3261
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:46,050
you know,

3262
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:46,883
public knowledge.

3263
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:49,080
It's fucking amazing how the,

3264
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:51,420
the birth of oil in the United States,

3265
01:21:51,421 --> 01:21:56,421
this documentary's called about the birth
of oil and how it came in and infected

3266
01:21:56,461 --> 01:21:57,211
all our lives.

3267
01:21:57,211 --> 01:22:01,440
And how John Rockefeller monopolize
fucking everything to find it,

3268
01:22:01,441 --> 01:22:01,830
dude.

3269
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:02,111
It's,

3270
01:22:02,111 --> 01:22:02,270
it's,

3271
01:22:02,270 --> 01:22:03,031
it's an incredibly,

3272
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:04,140
and it's free on youtube.

3273
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:04,640
Dude,

3274
01:22:04,640 --> 01:22:08,100
I got another one for you and it's
your boy that prescription thugs.

3275
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:09,180
That's good doc.

3276
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:10,110
Some crazy shit.

3277
01:22:10,111 --> 01:22:11,400
He's called John Rockefeller.

3278
01:22:11,401 --> 01:22:12,330
He Dude,

3279
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,740
he controlled big Pharma.

3280
01:22:13,741 --> 01:22:15,600
He controlled our educational system.

3281
01:22:15,630 --> 01:22:16,021
Everything.

3282
01:22:16,021 --> 01:22:16,854
One Dude,

3283
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,820
the first billionaire,

3284
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:19,650
one dude controlled everything.

3285
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:21,630
This prescription thugs is some shit.

3286
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:22,440
Yeah,

3287
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:23,130
I've heard.

3288
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:23,820
I can't wait.

3289
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:24,271
Same Guy.

3290
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:24,511
Who did,

3291
01:22:24,511 --> 01:22:25,860
he did trophy kids.

3292
01:22:25,900 --> 01:22:26,581
Have you seen trophy?

3293
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:27,414
Kids have not.

3294
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,033
That's the way he don't.

3295
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:29,311
Bigger,

3296
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:29,761
faster,

3297
01:22:29,761 --> 01:22:32,040
stronger to just really good stuff.

3298
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:32,190
Yeah.

3299
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:33,023
What's it called again?

3300
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,770
A prescription thugs.

3301
01:22:34,771 --> 01:22:36,090
That sounds fucking scariest.

3302
01:22:36,110 --> 01:22:36,420
Shit.

3303
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:40,230
I've seen Showbie kids and a Netflix.

3304
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,333
Yes.

3305
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,680
It just came out to do.

3306
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:45,451
There's one,

3307
01:22:45,451 --> 01:22:46,290
I know I'm all over the place,

3308
01:22:46,291 --> 01:22:50,730
but there's one vice had a thing on
people taking their own lives and I think

3309
01:22:50,731 --> 01:22:52,380
there's eight states in the United States.

3310
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,060
Fucking vice.

3311
01:22:54,061 --> 01:22:56,070
I don't know how this
journalist got this job.

3312
01:22:56,220 --> 01:22:57,540
This old bitch is like,

3313
01:22:57,541 --> 01:22:57,631
yeah,

3314
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:58,321
I'm trying to go,

3315
01:22:58,321 --> 01:22:58,980
man.

3316
01:22:58,980 --> 01:22:59,813
They film it.

3317
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,153
They out.

3318
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:03,240
I was in bed 10 o'clock at night.

3319
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,590
I'm gonna Watch this bitch die.

3320
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:05,541
It was nuts,

3321
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:06,190
man.

3322
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:06,580
Whoa.

3323
01:23:06,580 --> 01:23:06,791
Yeah.

3324
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:07,390
She's just,

3325
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,290
she freak out.

3326
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,210
I was in a weird space,

3327
01:23:10,211 --> 01:23:11,044
man.

3328
01:23:11,090 --> 01:23:12,850
I was in a weird space because she,

3329
01:23:12,851 --> 01:23:13,180
her,

3330
01:23:13,180 --> 01:23:16,900
her whole family's there and she has
this disease where it's not going to get

3331
01:23:16,901 --> 01:23:17,141
better.

3332
01:23:17,141 --> 01:23:18,280
She's gonna forget everyone.

3333
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,240
There's no cure.

3334
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:20,074
It's,

3335
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:20,621
it's done.

3336
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,850
So and so,

3337
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,271
uh,

3338
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:23,860
she talked to this lady gets approved,

3339
01:23:24,010 --> 01:23:25,030
lady comes over and she's like,

3340
01:23:25,031 --> 01:23:25,151
yeah,

3341
01:23:25,151 --> 01:23:26,020
that's my coffin there.

3342
01:23:26,021 --> 01:23:27,430
You guys want a coffee?

3343
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:28,720
She's all happy.

3344
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:29,530
And then she,

3345
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:29,980
her,

3346
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:31,030
her family comes.

3347
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:33,250
They all hugged her and
then I'll have a safe trip.

3348
01:23:33,251 --> 01:23:33,521
She's like,

3349
01:23:33,521 --> 01:23:35,260
thanks Donka she keeps going.

3350
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:38,920
Donka Donka lays down and everyone's
like c as soon she's like,

3351
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:39,580

3352
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:40,960
injector and done.

3353
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:42,200
Wow.

3354
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:42,520
Kate,

3355
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,221
HBR.

3356
01:23:43,221 --> 01:23:44,770
I'm not ready for this shit man.

3357
01:23:44,930 --> 01:23:45,280
Chase.

3358
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,210
Fuck my whole night up.

3359
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:48,041
Check it out though.

3360
01:23:48,041 --> 01:23:50,950
It's the new vice is pretty
dope is a crazy fucking show.

3361
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:51,883
I watched,

3362
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,190
I don't remember what
country they were in,

3363
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:55,080
but there were,

3364
01:23:55,090 --> 01:23:58,930
they were all wearing bulletproof vests
and they were moving from one set of

3365
01:23:58,931 --> 01:24:03,310
broken down rocket shelled buildings
to the next and they're moving around

3366
01:24:03,311 --> 01:24:05,650
somewhere in the Middle
East and I'm watching this,

3367
01:24:05,651 --> 01:24:06,040
I'm like,

3368
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:07,870
fuck this job.

3369
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:08,891
Like if you're over there.

3370
01:24:08,891 --> 01:24:11,170
And then one guy would come to
the camera trying to explain,

3371
01:24:11,350 --> 01:24:11,561
well,

3372
01:24:11,561 --> 01:24:16,360
the rebels are about three kilometers
away and we have to stay down because they

3373
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:17,200
have been shooting like,

3374
01:24:17,201 --> 01:24:18,520
what the fuck are you talking about?

3375
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,600
Halls to that job,

3376
01:24:19,690 --> 01:24:19,901
dude,

3377
01:24:19,901 --> 01:24:21,130
that's like the James uh,

3378
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,530
James Foley documentary on Hbo.

3379
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:24,780
You know the Guy Jim Foley,

3380
01:24:24,820 --> 01:24:26,200
the guy who got caught by Isis,

3381
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:28,290
he's a prisoner of war and he got a gym.

3382
01:24:28,670 --> 01:24:31,460
Jim Who got decapitated on they,

3383
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,150
it's a documentary on him and
he's a frontline journalist.

3384
01:24:34,151 --> 01:24:35,170
It's fucking nuts,

3385
01:24:35,171 --> 01:24:36,004
man.

3386
01:24:36,010 --> 01:24:38,170
He already got caught and
got out and then went back.

3387
01:24:38,171 --> 01:24:38,861
And then ice is like,

3388
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:39,071
Yo,

3389
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:39,371
dog.

3390
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:40,204
It's just too easy.

3391
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:44,170
One of our best at the end of the world.

3392
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,011
The end of the world for,

3393
01:24:45,011 --> 01:24:46,690
I was like end the end of civilization.

3394
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:49,660
There's countries out there where it
is already the end of civilization.

3395
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:52,030
It's over.

3396
01:24:52,030 --> 01:24:53,350
You're going to lock Liberia.

3397
01:24:53,470 --> 01:24:54,220
It's done.

3398
01:24:54,220 --> 01:24:58,180
If the world economy collapses
and everything and it's
fucking zombies come out

3399
01:24:58,181 --> 01:24:58,890
and all that shit.

3400
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:00,370
Nothing changes in Liberia.

3401
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:03,310
It's the same fucking
shit end of the world.

3402
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:05,560
Have you seen the documentaries
on Liberia from vice?

3403
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,500
Oh yeah.

3404
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,410
I can't get enough captain button naked.

3405
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:08,711
Yeah.

3406
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:10,040
That's the great gender.

3407
01:25:10,090 --> 01:25:11,110
Enough of

3408
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:14,260
the God damn world over there.

3409
01:25:14,650 --> 01:25:16,030
Nothing changes there.

3410
01:25:16,031 --> 01:25:20,770
How about when he caught people eating
human flesh on the corner and the reason

3411
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:23,320
why he knew the guy was selling human
flesh because he knew what it tasted like.

3412
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:23,531
Hey,

3413
01:25:23,531 --> 01:25:24,910
you didn't before Mark Coleman

3414
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:31,520
world some crazy shit to get done watching
that shit like in Syria and Kenny,

3415
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,330
all that stuff and then you're
in this cushy home in La.

3416
01:25:34,331 --> 01:25:35,164
It's like what though?

3417
01:25:35,370 --> 01:25:36,390
Yeah,

3418
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,301
loans with.

3419
01:25:37,301 --> 01:25:38,110
He'll take,

3420
01:25:38,110 --> 01:25:40,540
how long would it take if
all the power went out?

3421
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:40,961
Like,

3422
01:25:40,961 --> 01:25:44,680
how long would it take before some
people started killing people?

3423
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,013
Six months.

3424
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:49,090
It wouldn't even take that long.

3425
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:50,050
You don't think six months?

3426
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:50,470
No,

3427
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:52,860
I don't think we'd rob all
the sub eleven's first few.

3428
01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:57,400
If we all ran out of food and you had
some just one asshole that you really

3429
01:25:57,640 --> 01:25:59,740
fucking hated and you
don't have to eat his leg.

3430
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:01,661
Yes.

3431
01:26:01,661 --> 01:26:02,770
The more you meet a guy,

3432
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:04,220
the tastier he looks.

3433
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:05,781
Keep talking,

3434
01:26:05,781 --> 01:26:06,614
motherfucker.

3435
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:07,880
Shit now,

3436
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:09,770
definitely did that back in the day,

3437
01:26:09,771 --> 01:26:10,131
man.

3438
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:10,311
I mean,

3439
01:26:10,311 --> 01:26:14,840
they definitely did that back in the
day to intimidate the enemy in various

3440
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:15,321
cultures.

3441
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:17,050
They would kill you on islands and shirts.

3442
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:17,610
Yeah,

3443
01:26:17,610 --> 01:26:18,740
the Samoans in there.

3444
01:26:19,820 --> 01:26:22,280
I don't think he did Vikings cannibalize?

3445
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,470
He goes like a thing back in the day.

3446
01:26:24,471 --> 01:26:25,304
How about Kevin Raymond?

3447
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:26,210
That's fucking sad.

3448
01:26:26,660 --> 01:26:27,970
I was with him on Saturday.

3449
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:32,030
I was at the Superbowl party with him
and then I looked online the next.

3450
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:32,360
I was like,

3451
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:32,750
fuck.

3452
01:26:32,750 --> 01:26:34,130
And he was all good at Superbowl party.

3453
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:34,641
Yeah,

3454
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:35,660
he was just coughing a lot,

3455
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:37,220
which obviously was in the movie,

3456
01:26:37,330 --> 01:26:39,270
but the most potential a lot.

3457
01:26:39,410 --> 01:26:41,750
Fuck his wrestling.

3458
01:26:41,751 --> 01:26:42,710
I mean chuck [inaudible],

3459
01:26:42,750 --> 01:26:44,750
he was the best in his opinion,

3460
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,540
the best wrestler in college history.

3461
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,310
That's what chocolate del said.

3462
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:51,290
That was his opinion and his opinion.

3463
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:52,960
He was so happy and,

3464
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,481
and I've,

3465
01:26:53,481 --> 01:26:56,270
I've known him for maybe we're not like
good friends but known him for 10 years

3466
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:57,290
and I see him once a year.

3467
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,900
It's one of those things you have mutual
respect because he's fucking Kevin

3468
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:04,490
Randleman talking to him and then
he's talking about his queen,

3469
01:27:04,491 --> 01:27:05,061
his wife,

3470
01:27:05,061 --> 01:27:06,200
how awesome she was.

3471
01:27:06,201 --> 01:27:09,380
And I mean I met my girlfriend and then
he's talking about his four year old

3472
01:27:09,381 --> 01:27:10,214
son.

3473
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:11,270
What a freak though.

3474
01:27:11,390 --> 01:27:14,300
Athletically they say he's like the best
athlete to come through the oil knocked

3475
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:15,130
out cro cop.

3476
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:15,711
Ooh Man.

3477
01:27:15,711 --> 01:27:19,570
If he would've caught a lot of
left guard and taken back him,

3478
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:21,410
can you imagine that Kevin
Randleman if you would,

3479
01:27:21,411 --> 01:27:23,970
if you even got obsessed and
I've had several talks with him,

3480
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,950
say get good at passing the guard
and mounting and taken backs.

3481
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:30,050
You'll be unfucking stoppable Jack,

3482
01:27:30,290 --> 01:27:34,310
he was the first guy that flat flatline
cro cop in pride from across the ring.

3483
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,990
Super Nice Guy.

3484
01:27:35,991 --> 01:27:36,680
Man,

3485
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:37,760
speed and power.

3486
01:27:37,761 --> 01:27:38,594
That guy had,

3487
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:39,770
he was a real nice guy.

3488
01:27:39,771 --> 01:27:40,850
He was fun to be around too.

3489
01:27:40,850 --> 01:27:42,400
His real jovial young mark.

3490
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:42,711
No,

3491
01:27:42,711 --> 01:27:43,544
not a dick.

3492
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:44,480
So not at all.

3493
01:27:44,481 --> 01:27:44,690
No,

3494
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:46,280
he was never a dick.

3495
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:48,390
Bosco from [inaudible] who was talking,

3496
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:49,970
who was on my podcast this week,

3497
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:53,060
he was talking about peanut at a hotel
elevator with them the day before they

3498
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:54,710
fought and uh,

3499
01:27:54,711 --> 01:27:57,400
and he said a good luck and uh,

3500
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,280
Kevin said good luck back
to him and Kevin said,

3501
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:02,870
I'll make you a deal if you don't kick me.

3502
01:28:02,871 --> 01:28:04,250
I promise to keep this on the feet.

3503
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:05,743
Really.

3504
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:06,111
Damn,

3505
01:28:06,111 --> 01:28:06,944
that's nuts.

3506
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:12,160
And a boss broke it like immediately he
said random and started slapping his leg

3507
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:16,490
and he felt like he was saying like,

3508
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:17,870
kicked me and I'll take you down.

3509
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:18,711
You know,

3510
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,000
like he was trying to
figure out what it is.

3511
01:28:20,001 --> 01:28:21,200
So he said yeah.

3512
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:23,870
And then I fixed to the leg and go
with the front kick to the face.

3513
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:25,953
Yeah.

3514
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,320
And they took them down a lot.

3515
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:31,790
But he's a great guy,

3516
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:32,180
man.

3517
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:35,270
It'd be good to get a CT
scan of a random men's brain.

3518
01:28:35,480 --> 01:28:38,270
Cause we don't have a lot of knowledge
on that on MMA fighters brains.

3519
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:38,540
Huh.

3520
01:28:38,540 --> 01:28:39,500
That's a really good point.

3521
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:41,450
I wonder if they were interested
in doing that because this,

3522
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:42,490
his family should,

3523
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:43,633
is it too late?

3524
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:44,540
Probably.

3525
01:28:44,540 --> 01:28:45,380
I don't know how it works,

3526
01:28:45,381 --> 01:28:46,260
but there's not a lot,

3527
01:28:46,261 --> 01:28:46,670
you know,

3528
01:28:46,670 --> 01:28:47,660
MMA so young,

3529
01:28:47,720 --> 01:28:49,430
a lot of them don't die and he's a legend.

3530
01:28:49,431 --> 01:28:50,390
He has a lot of fights.

3531
01:28:50,420 --> 01:28:52,540
So it'd be good to get just
to see what's going on with,

3532
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:53,241
with a lot of guys.

3533
01:28:53,241 --> 01:28:56,570
But I wonder if anybody's brought that
up because it's hard without being

3534
01:28:56,571 --> 01:29:00,830
disrespectful or perceiving that you
are disrespectful saying something like

3535
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:01,110
that.

3536
01:29:01,110 --> 01:29:01,840
That's true.

3537
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,030
Do you think that's disrespectful?

3538
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:03,241
No,

3539
01:29:03,241 --> 01:29:05,030
I definitely don't try to be this.

3540
01:29:05,070 --> 01:29:07,690
I don't think you are at all
because wearing the number saying,

3541
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:09,270
asking that question,

3542
01:29:09,271 --> 01:29:10,104
it would be hard.

3543
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:11,510
Like you know a lot.

3544
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:12,330
Oh you know,

3545
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,200
some people might,

3546
01:29:13,201 --> 01:29:13,411
uh,

3547
01:29:13,411 --> 01:29:16,680
they might have a hard time with
their kid just dying or their wife,

3548
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,030
their husband just dying.

3549
01:29:18,210 --> 01:29:19,680
Cause like juniors say out the guy,

3550
01:29:20,190 --> 01:29:23,160
literally my hero growing up as
a kid shot himself in the chest.

3551
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:23,490
Right.

3552
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:24,900
And the reason he shot
himself in the chest.

3553
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:25,260
He was like,

3554
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:26,670
you guys need to study my brain,

3555
01:29:26,671 --> 01:29:26,880
man,

3556
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,020
that's so many concussions.

3557
01:29:28,350 --> 01:29:29,910
They just said he wasn't the same guy.

3558
01:29:29,970 --> 01:29:30,803
Did he kill himself?

3559
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:31,080
Yeah.

3560
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:32,010
Shoot himself in the chest.

3561
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:32,900
Commit suicide.

3562
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:33,733
When was that?

3563
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:34,321
Three,

3564
01:29:34,321 --> 01:29:36,210
four years ago playing junior sal.

3565
01:29:36,330 --> 01:29:36,660
Oh,

3566
01:29:36,660 --> 01:29:37,920
favorite athlete of all time.

3567
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:38,611
Shit,

3568
01:29:38,611 --> 01:29:39,360
I didn't know that.

3569
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:40,890
They said from so many concussions,

3570
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:41,760
like his,

3571
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,530
his getaway was the ocean.

3572
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:44,880
Like he would get in the ocean.

3573
01:29:44,910 --> 01:29:45,061
He,

3574
01:29:45,061 --> 01:29:46,140
they say he was the happiest guy ever.

3575
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:46,921
Had a great family,

3576
01:29:46,921 --> 01:29:48,600
lived on the beach and ocean side.

3577
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,870
And then he said all of a sudden
something kicked in and he wasn't happy

3578
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:52,793
anywhere.

3579
01:29:52,830 --> 01:29:53,240
Anywhere.

3580
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,150
He would fake it everywhere.

3581
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,093
Then he'd go home,

3582
01:29:55,290 --> 01:29:56,160
couldn't sleep.

3583
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:57,240
Super depressed.

3584
01:29:58,260 --> 01:29:58,950
Bummer Merman.

3585
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:59,783
But again,

3586
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:01,270
the NFL has been around for so long.

3587
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:02,143
You need the weed.

3588
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:03,900
He gave his brain right and they're like,

3589
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:04,051
yeah,

3590
01:30:04,051 --> 01:30:05,520
CT like a motherfucker.

3591
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:07,800
So I'm not saying round in has anything,

3592
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,520
but he's one of the legends
with all these fights.

3593
01:30:10,550 --> 01:30:11,191
Find Pride,

3594
01:30:11,191 --> 01:30:13,800
UFC who we can actually see
what the brain looks like,

3595
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,110
step in the right direction.

3596
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:17,460
It's a,

3597
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:18,580
it's a good combo.

3598
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:19,320
Sorry.

3599
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,153
Yeah,

3600
01:30:20,670 --> 01:30:21,510
it's important though.

3601
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:25,350
What you're saying is a board
that's important to think
about and probably would

3602
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:26,213
been a good idea.

3603
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:27,271
I mean,

3604
01:30:27,271 --> 01:30:27,661
who knows?

3605
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:28,081
We don't know.

3606
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:29,790
Maybe somebody else had brought that up,

3607
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:31,441
but I don't know.

3608
01:30:31,441 --> 01:30:32,630
I hadn't thought about it.

3609
01:30:32,670 --> 01:30:34,200
All I thought about it was like,

3610
01:30:34,201 --> 01:30:34,441
wow,

3611
01:30:34,441 --> 01:30:35,280
that guy was only like,

3612
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,770
I think it was 44 44 and
you know what's crazy?

3613
01:30:37,771 --> 01:30:39,000
That's the first thing I thought about.

3614
01:30:39,330 --> 01:30:39,640
Yeah.

3615
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,560
It wasn't that old man,

3616
01:30:40,650 --> 01:30:41,311
but like you said,

3617
01:30:41,311 --> 01:30:42,440
when I got disrespectful,

3618
01:30:42,450 --> 01:30:43,283
heart failure,

3619
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,820
pneumonia and then right,

3620
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:45,690
and had complications,

3621
01:30:45,691 --> 01:30:46,620
we went to the hospital.

3622
01:30:46,810 --> 01:30:47,643
Yeah.

3623
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:52,810
Fuck who be,

3624
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:54,090
who brought the bad news bears?

3625
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:55,920
People are fucking dying.

3626
01:30:55,921 --> 01:30:56,201
Right?

3627
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,290
It doesn't seem like they're
dude and music people.

3628
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:00,490
They're starting to drop off.

3629
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:02,540
Block stars are starting to drop off.

3630
01:31:02,541 --> 01:31:03,120
Yeah.

3631
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,050
Lemmy from Motorhead.

3632
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:04,884
David Bowie.

3633
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:08,340
You can't party that hard
and miscellaneous guys to
like guys that weren't that

3634
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:10,300
famous like Jimmy Bain and
the bass player for deal.

3635
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:11,760
Like they're slowly,

3636
01:31:11,761 --> 01:31:12,200
boom,

3637
01:31:12,200 --> 01:31:12,900
cause I forgot.

3638
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:13,591
It's that time.

3639
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:14,160
All that,

3640
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:19,020
all those years of partying in the 70s
and eighties oh it's good to get you

3641
01:31:19,021 --> 01:31:19,440
right now.

3642
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:20,940
It's going to get you to stop drunk.

3643
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,751
They're going to start drop.

3644
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:23,970
Hey those guys in the
80s kind of worth it,

3645
01:31:23,971 --> 01:31:24,804
isn't it?

3646
01:31:24,810 --> 01:31:26,360
To live those glory years bro.

3647
01:31:27,890 --> 01:31:28,723
You know what's crazy?

3648
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,753
It's,

3649
01:31:30,810 --> 01:31:33,680
you know that metal is huge in the
eighties hair metal and all that shit.

3650
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:38,690
Guns and roses and Motley Crue and then
died a horrible vanilla ice type death

3651
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:39,960
in the 90s and shit.

3652
01:31:40,290 --> 01:31:43,230
And in the two thousands
but guess fucking what dude.

3653
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:44,900
Guess what it's been.

3654
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:45,880
It's common bad.

3655
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:48,280
Rose is doing tours,

3656
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:49,410
tours,

3657
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:52,590
Motley Crue playing a couple of
nights at the staples center.

3658
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:53,750
Come on.

3659
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:54,000
That's,

3660
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:54,581
that's fucking,

3661
01:31:54,581 --> 01:31:59,581
and they couldn't do that 10 years
ago because his is beyond all that.

3662
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:01,100
They've been doing that forever.

3663
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:01,300
Yeah.

3664
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:01,990
Cause is different.

3665
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,700
They had,

3666
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:03,550
that's a hold up dude.

3667
01:32:03,551 --> 01:32:04,660
Rolling stones though.

3668
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:06,460
No rolling stones never went down.

3669
01:32:06,490 --> 01:32:07,480
They never went down to right above it.

3670
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,670
It had metal guns and
roses when fucking down.

3671
01:32:09,671 --> 01:32:13,390
Now they're putting together that
finally they're putting together,

3672
01:32:13,391 --> 01:32:16,960
you know how big that guns and
roses reunion tour is going to be?

3673
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:21,850
It's going to finally slash and axle
made up and they said let's do this.

3674
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:26,910
Holy Shit that's going to be fucking eat
all that shit's coming back for them on

3675
01:32:28,421 --> 01:32:29,254
a podcast.

3676
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,090
That's why I figured everybody's here.

3677
01:32:31,090 --> 01:32:34,270
Why not a lot of people talking to
cause the Diet but could hold it.

3678
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:34,781
Oh Shit.

3679
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:35,440
Here we go.

3680
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,150
Cody and Tuck Kinko if I
want it to never seen it.

3681
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:41,590
I know how to like do a little camel.

3682
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:41,771
You know,

3683
01:32:41,771 --> 01:32:43,240
I do have a weird bladder now,

3684
01:32:43,270 --> 01:32:46,810
but I think I trained it over
all six years of doing podcasts.

3685
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:49,990
I get the bladder and they
stretched out and I must be,

3686
01:32:49,991 --> 01:32:51,020
it's like a old hookers,

3687
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,863
but

3688
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:54,790
it's a super pliable.

3689
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:56,613
It's up jamming.

3690
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:58,290
I saw a trailer for John Travolta,

3691
01:32:58,291 --> 01:32:58,751
his new movie.

3692
01:32:58,751 --> 01:33:00,790
Cause this Arnold Schwartzenegger
thing just made me think of it.

3693
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:01,540
Yeah.

3694
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:02,470
Oh it looks so bad.

3695
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,030
Oh really?

3696
01:33:03,030 --> 01:33:04,120
Like the punisher.

3697
01:33:04,590 --> 01:33:07,420
I'll fuck I am wrath bro.

3698
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:08,360
But do you see no,

3699
01:33:08,361 --> 01:33:08,980
no,

3700
01:33:08,980 --> 01:33:09,940
I heard he's awesome.

3701
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:10,721
And the Oj show.

3702
01:33:10,721 --> 01:33:14,920
That's why just say John Travolta
Know Jay has a Shapiro is the shit.

3703
01:33:14,920 --> 01:33:17,980
They were playing the Oj show at the
comedy store yesterday and everybody was

3704
01:33:17,981 --> 01:33:18,880
raving about it.

3705
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:19,300
I was like,

3706
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:19,930
it's good,

3707
01:33:19,930 --> 01:33:20,920
but it's like all water.

3708
01:33:20,930 --> 01:33:21,880
But nothing happened.

3709
01:33:21,910 --> 01:33:24,520
I heard Cuba Gooding Jr is the shit.

3710
01:33:24,610 --> 01:33:26,050
Oh see he's my only problem.

3711
01:33:26,530 --> 01:33:26,980
Really?

3712
01:33:26,980 --> 01:33:27,131
Yeah,

3713
01:33:27,131 --> 01:33:27,964
he's not that good.

3714
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,310
Everyone else is the bond.

3715
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:32,260
Everyone else is spot on.

3716
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:33,400
And then Cuba use in June.

3717
01:33:33,401 --> 01:33:35,530
It looks nothing like Oj.

3718
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:36,880
Well looks nothing like him,

3719
01:33:36,881 --> 01:33:39,190
but his acting well.

3720
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:40,570
You kind of get a good actor though.

3721
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:42,430
And what good actor looks exactly like.

3722
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:42,910
Oh Jay,

3723
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:43,720
none.

3724
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:46,720
So you got to take it another
guy and put him in prosthetics.

3725
01:33:46,750 --> 01:33:47,490
My boy who did.

3726
01:33:47,490 --> 01:33:47,680
Oh,

3727
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:48,520
that would be kind of creepy.

3728
01:33:48,521 --> 01:33:48,851
Right?

3729
01:33:48,851 --> 01:33:49,511
Be fucking weird.

3730
01:33:49,511 --> 01:33:51,560
That would be creepy as fuck that it.

3731
01:33:52,070 --> 01:33:52,810
You did it.

3732
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:53,590
It drifts Elba.

3733
01:33:53,590 --> 01:33:54,341
They couldn't get him,

3734
01:33:54,341 --> 01:33:55,660
cause he's too big in the movies.

3735
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:56,650
He meets James Bond now,

3736
01:33:56,651 --> 01:34:00,490
but someone of that ilk who's that
good and then you give him some crazy

3737
01:34:00,491 --> 01:34:01,324
prosthetics.

3738
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:02,163
He goes,

3739
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:02,770
no,

3740
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:03,670
he's black already.

3741
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:05,050
But you let them do a,

3742
01:34:05,051 --> 01:34:05,640
uh,

3743
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,270
a fucking Daniel Day Lewis,

3744
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:11,600
where it's just lives like that for a
year and he puts on the prosthetic and

3745
01:34:11,601 --> 01:34:13,150
likes his Oj.

3746
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,860
That would freak people to fuck out,

3747
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:15,520
bro.

3748
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,600
I'm saying you get Robert Downey
Jr does blackface as Oj Simpson.

3749
01:34:20,470 --> 01:34:21,420
That's boxing.

3750
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:24,760
He's already done in tropic
thunder and he's so good.

3751
01:34:24,790 --> 01:34:29,150
He's like one of the only white guys
was ever pulled off black faces people.

3752
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:31,660
What movie was funnier
than Tropic Thunder?

3753
01:34:32,050 --> 01:34:33,900
Name one movie funnier
than dressed down there.

3754
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:36,800
I don't think there's ever been
a movie that was funny earlier,

3755
01:34:37,150 --> 01:34:40,650
but that was as about as funny as a movie.

3756
01:34:40,651 --> 01:34:40,900
Yeah,

3757
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:41,291
Dude.

3758
01:34:41,291 --> 01:34:42,124
Come on.

3759
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:47,160
[inaudible]

3760
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:50,350
full retard.

3761
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:50,741
Come on.

3762
01:34:50,741 --> 01:34:55,741
[inaudible] come on and go full week on
the greatest Internet memes of all data.

3763
01:34:56,990 --> 01:34:59,350
That may be one of the funniest scenes,

3764
01:34:59,390 --> 01:35:01,880
best acting job of all time.

3765
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,260
He played a black guy and
come on a solid black guy.

3766
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,720
It was fucking money.

3767
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,583
God,

3768
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,330
how about the scene where,

3769
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:11,920
where,

3770
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:12,540
Ah,

3771
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,020
a Jack Black was tied to eat.

3772
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:19,430
He told everyone time and your fucking
tree and don't let me talk you into

3773
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:20,450
letting me out.

3774
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:21,860
That scene where he's offering to suck.

3775
01:35:21,861 --> 01:35:25,480
The dude's do come on as well in the
swollen gravy and the swollen grade.

3776
01:35:26,710 --> 01:35:27,543
Come on,

3777
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:30,680
swallow the grantee and then
that gay black guy goes,

3778
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:31,491
I told you,

3779
01:35:31,491 --> 01:35:32,030
man,

3780
01:35:32,030 --> 01:35:33,020
I'm in the pissy.

3781
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:35,810
I love that movie.

3782
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:37,260
I love it.

3783
01:35:37,260 --> 01:35:39,860
I knew the Chino baby booty juice.

3784
01:35:40,280 --> 01:35:42,200
One thing I'll never
forget about that movie.

3785
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:44,000
The impression that left
on me when I'm like,

3786
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:44,331
okay,

3787
01:35:44,331 --> 01:35:44,571
you here,

3788
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:45,560
it's good and you go to the movies.

3789
01:35:45,561 --> 01:35:49,520
I'm at the movie theater and watching
it in the beginning when they blow that

3790
01:35:49,521 --> 01:35:51,440
fucking director's head off,

3791
01:35:51,770 --> 01:35:52,850
you see right there,

3792
01:35:52,851 --> 01:35:53,390
I thought,

3793
01:35:53,390 --> 01:35:54,500
oh shit,

3794
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:55,760
you're in some,

3795
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,593
yes,

3796
01:36:03,020 --> 01:36:03,650
this is,

3797
01:36:03,650 --> 01:36:04,760
this is going to be an amazing,

3798
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:06,830
how good was Tom Cruise as the fat agent?

3799
01:36:06,890 --> 01:36:07,391
Oh my God,

3800
01:36:07,391 --> 01:36:08,150
he's amazing.

3801
01:36:08,150 --> 01:36:10,350
But dancing on it in the best mood.

3802
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:14,480
You know the craziest
thing about that movies,

3803
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:18,020
every character it was I thought
the only movie everywhere.

3804
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,210
Every character was a douchebag.

3805
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:20,700
Yes,

3806
01:36:20,700 --> 01:36:21,533
and nobody.

3807
01:36:22,910 --> 01:36:24,440
Everybody was a Douche bag.

3808
01:36:24,710 --> 01:36:26,060
There was no cool people.

3809
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:27,501
It was like making,

3810
01:36:27,501 --> 01:36:28,520
it was making fun.

3811
01:36:28,630 --> 01:36:29,463
Jack,

3812
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:35,710
can you find that scene where
Jack Black tied to a tree

3813
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:42,140
to Ben Stiller?

3814
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:45,140
His character was the ultimate Douche bag.

3815
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:46,071
He was asked.

3816
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:46,904
He was like,

3817
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:47,863
aw man,

3818
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:48,471
here's your boy.

3819
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:49,070
Here's your,

3820
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:50,120
Oh shit.

3821
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,300
Oh Shit.

3822
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:55,580
What is,

3823
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:59,550
this is tacchino and then who some
are Paul Harris is took Kenya.

3824
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,350
Yeah.

3825
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:01,183
Very similar.

3826
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:01,461
Yeah.

3827
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:02,800
What is the difference in a lab?

3828
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,430
What is the tank?

3829
01:37:04,431 --> 01:37:06,620
Kino and little tank.

3830
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:10,610
I think I'm just Tokyo and the other
one is talking or like twister.

3831
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,960
I thought it was tree.

3832
01:37:12,230 --> 01:37:13,063
That's the tree.

3833
01:37:16,250 --> 01:37:16,981
Well fuck man.

3834
01:37:16,981 --> 01:37:19,260
You're just guessing.

3835
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:19,881
I'm telling you.

3836
01:37:19,881 --> 01:37:21,450
I'm guessing it's pretty educated guesses.

3837
01:37:23,090 --> 01:37:25,730
I think tore it toward the keynote.

3838
01:37:27,620 --> 01:37:30,180
You know what I love when they say in
the corner where they go trick kilos.

3839
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:31,033
Trank Quito.

3840
01:37:31,310 --> 01:37:32,660
We were telling you to relax.

3841
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:33,523
That's a Mexican.

3842
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:35,310
Well it's Portuguese too.

3843
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:39,200
I'm pretty sure there's going to
be a good fight in Portuguese.

3844
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:39,710
It's Elisa.

3845
01:37:39,710 --> 01:37:40,790
Similar sounding word,

3846
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:43,670
cause I've heard guys and a
Brazilian dude's corners calling it.

3847
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:44,100
You see her?

3848
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:44,420
Nothing.

3849
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,050
She's like,

3850
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:45,920
Eddie made this up.

3851
01:37:45,940 --> 01:37:46,540
Eddie,

3852
01:37:46,540 --> 01:37:48,020
is he still with Mckenzie?

3853
01:37:48,021 --> 01:37:49,020
Is He still with Mackenzie?

3854
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:53,690
Not they're both with anybody.

3855
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:56,030
We both single think Cody's on page.

3856
01:37:56,430 --> 01:37:56,941
They're both.

3857
01:37:56,941 --> 01:37:58,110
Dick's lingers and Cody,

3858
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:00,540
who is a murderous puncher and a dime.

3859
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:00,930
We don't,

3860
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:03,270
we don't have any idea what a,

3861
01:38:03,370 --> 01:38:03,751
how'd he say?

3862
01:38:03,751 --> 01:38:03,991
Tuck?

3863
01:38:03,991 --> 01:38:07,310
He knows who we started
trying for the tank tank.

3864
01:38:07,310 --> 01:38:08,143
You down the hall.

3865
01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:12,360
That's how I get times is
he fought MMA five and no,

3866
01:38:12,361 --> 01:38:13,620
but all outside of the UFC?

3867
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:14,240
Yes.

3868
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:15,450
What a tough first time.

3869
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,150
And Cody seven no,

3870
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:17,601
but he doesn't,

3871
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:17,790
you know,

3872
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:19,110
he doesn't have a ton of experience.

3873
01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:21,910
I mean his standup doesn't look that bad,

3874
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:22,250
right?

3875
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:23,083
Oh,

3876
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:27,600
Cody has a ton of amateur fights.

3877
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:31,280
He's winging punches on
the outside of amateur.

3878
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:32,260
I was going to get counted.

3879
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,990
He's going to be super careful.

3880
01:38:35,450 --> 01:38:35,610
Oh,

3881
01:38:35,610 --> 01:38:36,121
you never know,

3882
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:36,570
man.

3883
01:38:36,570 --> 01:38:37,470
He might just decide,

3884
01:38:37,471 --> 01:38:37,771
okay,

3885
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:40,710
it's time to go on a
defensive shell and hit him.

3886
01:38:40,740 --> 01:38:41,430
Dot.

3887
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:42,530
Good luck taking Cody down.

3888
01:38:44,240 --> 01:38:44,630
Good.

3889
01:38:44,630 --> 01:38:45,181
Hard to take.

3890
01:38:45,181 --> 01:38:46,230
Did he wrestle in high school and Shit?

3891
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,131
That's what I mean.

3892
01:38:47,131 --> 01:38:49,080
I mean the Jujitsu guy would
have kind of wrestling.

3893
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,001
I don't know,

3894
01:38:50,001 --> 01:38:50,834
man.

3895
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:54,360
All his greatest work has
been done with the geese,

3896
01:38:54,361 --> 01:38:56,310
so I don't know how
it's going to translate.

3897
01:38:56,310 --> 01:38:56,731
I'm not sure.

3898
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:57,810
Where did Cody Russell.

3899
01:38:58,020 --> 01:38:59,070
It just in high school,

3900
01:38:59,430 --> 01:39:00,180
but he's real good.

3901
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:00,481
Really,

3902
01:39:00,481 --> 01:39:01,290
really good.

3903
01:39:01,290 --> 01:39:01,831
And that team,

3904
01:39:01,831 --> 01:39:02,281
Alpha Male,

3905
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:05,010
they said he's like sets the
standard as far as intensity.

3906
01:39:05,011 --> 01:39:06,920
He's a motherfucker while he's,

3907
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,310
he's just there for looks great.

3908
01:39:08,311 --> 01:39:08,700
Right?

3909
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:09,000
Yeah,

3910
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,460
he's definitely got some nasty pounds.

3911
01:39:10,461 --> 01:39:10,861
Look at that.

3912
01:39:10,861 --> 01:39:11,430
He's hurt.

3913
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:13,290
He's hurt any of the
gut of his back pocket.

3914
01:39:13,291 --> 01:39:13,940
Hey,

3915
01:39:13,940 --> 01:39:14,790
is that a gun in your pants?

3916
01:39:14,820 --> 01:39:15,071
Dude?

3917
01:39:15,071 --> 01:39:17,070
That's an amazing idea to
go with through the way in.

3918
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:18,690
That's the hardest tramp stamp ever.

3919
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:21,240
It goes right to his bundle dude,

3920
01:39:28,470 --> 01:39:28,711
dude.

3921
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:30,410
So no one knows if he's still with page.

3922
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:36,670
Oh,

3923
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:42,180
let's see how much control
you didn't like it.

3924
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:45,020
Stand up coach,

3925
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,840
get them back to coach.

3926
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,000
Should not go to the ground with it.

3927
01:39:47,020 --> 01:39:47,581
Hell no,

3928
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:47,880
no,

3929
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:48,713
no.

3930
01:39:49,260 --> 01:39:50,550
I don't think he'd probably like that,

3931
01:39:52,230 --> 01:39:56,120
but meanwhile no controls Egypt.

3932
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,930
But I would you have liked
to have seen from him.

3933
01:39:57,931 --> 01:39:58,800
And that was ish.

3934
01:39:58,860 --> 01:39:59,880
I don't know man.

3935
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,350
I mean that's time Kino though,

3936
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:03,580
right?

3937
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,361
But what would you like,

3938
01:40:04,361 --> 01:40:04,830
like when you,

3939
01:40:04,830 --> 01:40:06,190
when you're seeing the
guy was trying to go,

3940
01:40:07,180 --> 01:40:09,600
I think he's not going to be able to
take him down and I think he's going to

3941
01:40:09,601 --> 01:40:11,220
lose the fight if he stays on his feet.

3942
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,980
So if he can't take
him down and you can't,

3943
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,700
uh,

3944
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:15,480
uh,

3945
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:16,500
survive on your feet,

3946
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:17,453
what else is left?

3947
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,210
Jumped to guard.

3948
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:18,421
I mean,

3949
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:19,570
that's all you have to have.

3950
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,640
Car pulls out

3951
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:23,090
many times.

3952
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:26,990
Frank Mir fantasy hit no works.

3953
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:31,170
You're good on your back if
you've got fires over Bam.

3954
01:40:31,420 --> 01:40:32,253
Right.

3955
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,370
But I,

3956
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:34,950
I've never really seen him on his back.

3957
01:40:34,951 --> 01:40:35,370
He's the,

3958
01:40:35,370 --> 01:40:36,660
he's the destroyer on top.

3959
01:40:36,661 --> 01:40:38,370
He destroys people going
through them on to,

3960
01:40:38,371 --> 01:40:39,600
I bet he's pretty good though,

3961
01:40:39,750 --> 01:40:41,730
I bet is just who's
better on his back then?

3962
01:40:41,731 --> 01:40:42,361
Cody's is on,

3963
01:40:42,361 --> 01:40:44,370
his standup was not that bad.

3964
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:45,291
He,

3965
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:47,520
he's definitely a outgunned by Cody,

3966
01:40:47,521 --> 01:40:48,690
but he's moving well,

3967
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,160
he's getting out of the way a shit.

3968
01:40:50,161 --> 01:40:50,790
Well,

3969
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:51,760
he's landed some decent,

3970
01:40:52,760 --> 01:40:53,260
yeah.

3971
01:40:53,260 --> 01:40:54,260
Jujitsu background

3972
01:40:54,360 --> 01:40:54,640
standups.

3973
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,161
Not Bad at all.

3974
01:40:55,161 --> 01:40:57,270
Not that bad because I
see like he's movies.

3975
01:40:57,280 --> 01:40:59,350
Try to choose that check
hook as he stepping back.

3976
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:02,830
He's not running in a straight
line with his hands down.

3977
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:03,041
You know,

3978
01:41:03,041 --> 01:41:04,020
he's not doing anything dumb.

3979
01:41:04,070 --> 01:41:04,781
Not being reckless,

3980
01:41:04,781 --> 01:41:05,420
that's for sure.

3981
01:41:05,420 --> 01:41:05,630
No,

3982
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:06,400
save his time.

3983
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:07,233
He's smart.

3984
01:41:07,330 --> 01:41:08,260
He's very smart.

3985
01:41:08,710 --> 01:41:10,640
Anybody that gets that good at Jujitsu,

3986
01:41:11,050 --> 01:41:11,680
man,

3987
01:41:11,680 --> 01:41:11,991
it's,

3988
01:41:11,991 --> 01:41:15,760
it's when you're hitting
that super mastery level
where you're beating the best

3989
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:16,594
guys in the world.

3990
01:41:17,050 --> 01:41:18,070
Well those guys,

3991
01:41:18,130 --> 01:41:21,970
all they have to do is just focus on the
new thing and they start picking up the

3992
01:41:21,971 --> 01:41:25,720
new thing with the same sort of clarity
that they pick up as long as I only

3993
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:27,190
physical issues,

3994
01:41:27,730 --> 01:41:30,130
especially Jitsu guys
don't there so cerebral,

3995
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:30,731
it's,

3996
01:41:30,731 --> 01:41:33,250
they're so smart they
bring into the octagon.

3997
01:41:33,251 --> 01:41:36,100
I feel like there's a difference
in the way you move though.

3998
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:38,560
And the problem is that
some guys who are grapplers,

3999
01:41:38,830 --> 01:41:43,480
they never seem to figure out how to
develop that explosive snap prompt.

4000
01:41:43,481 --> 01:41:44,380
I'm talking like you were saying,

4001
01:41:44,381 --> 01:41:46,750
the world class world
champions like Jock Caray,

4002
01:41:47,020 --> 01:41:47,780
Damien Maia,

4003
01:41:47,780 --> 01:41:48,040
right?

4004
01:41:48,040 --> 01:41:50,950
Like those motherfuckers when they
bring that same mindset to MMA.

4005
01:41:51,330 --> 01:41:51,730
Dude,

4006
01:41:51,730 --> 01:41:53,170
they're fucking nightmare.

4007
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,500
Yeah.

4008
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:54,340
Joc Curry right now.

4009
01:41:55,290 --> 01:41:56,730
Look at that colon cut.

4010
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,870
Oh Shit.

4011
01:41:59,490 --> 01:42:00,080
Yeah.

4012
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,290
It's got some standard.

4013
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:03,070
It's scary to have someone
with that sort of mastery.

4014
01:42:03,071 --> 01:42:05,260
Even you got that good at something.

4015
01:42:05,261 --> 01:42:07,810
Holy Shit Dry.

4016
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:08,080
No,

4017
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:08,760
no,

4018
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:08,971
no.

4019
01:42:08,971 --> 01:42:10,030
Stop the fight.

4020
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:11,800
Oh,

4021
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:12,551
hate on that.

4022
01:42:12,551 --> 01:42:13,384
Stop at jetty.

4023
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:15,093
I hate that shit.

4024
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:17,433
Break Trauma.

4025
01:42:18,690 --> 01:42:19,920
See Safety,

4026
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:21,461
safety.

4027
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:22,294
All three

4028
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,250
just got fucked us over.

4029
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:26,980
Dude.

4030
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,710
That fight was no Eddie.

4031
01:42:31,190 --> 01:42:31,480
Let's,

4032
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:32,313
let's look at it again.

4033
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,430
Joe Silva did.

4034
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,930
I was happy with it.

4035
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:35,860
I fell at Cody.

4036
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:36,963
Cody,

4037
01:42:36,980 --> 01:42:37,813
Cody.

4038
01:42:39,640 --> 01:42:40,530
Cody would have won,

4039
01:42:40,980 --> 01:42:42,020
but like I was looking at you.

4040
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:44,290
We want to see a little bit guys.

4041
01:42:44,291 --> 01:42:44,591
Here we go.

4042
01:42:44,591 --> 01:42:45,020
Once again,

4043
01:42:45,020 --> 01:42:47,220
we want to see Eddie.

4044
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,213
Wow.

4045
01:42:49,490 --> 01:42:50,323
Oh

4046
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:52,220
no,

4047
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:52,900
he's fine.

4048
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:55,420
Not Really Saki in the way.

4049
01:42:55,421 --> 01:42:57,760
That was terrible
positioning by Mario Saki.

4050
01:42:57,940 --> 01:42:58,481
Don't tell me.

4051
01:42:58,481 --> 01:42:59,890
That was a good stop it good.

4052
01:43:00,730 --> 01:43:01,121
Okay.

4053
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:02,380
It's a little rough here.

4054
01:43:04,290 --> 01:43:06,470
This is what

4055
01:43:08,130 --> 01:43:09,900
now I'm agreeing with Eddie.

4056
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:10,570
Well,

4057
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:11,350
first of all,

4058
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:13,810
the positioning by Mario
Yamasaki was terrible.

4059
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:15,070
Like you're not supposed to do that.

4060
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:17,950
You're not supposed to step in between
unless you're stopping the fight.

4061
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:19,660
Who stepped in between?

4062
01:43:19,661 --> 01:43:23,980
They stepped out like he got in between
the action and then he let the action

4063
01:43:23,981 --> 01:43:24,430
gone.

4064
01:43:24,430 --> 01:43:26,170
I don't think you guys are
only supposed to do that.

4065
01:43:26,470 --> 01:43:30,500
That was a moment of indecision or he
wanted to get a better look at him and

4066
01:43:30,501 --> 01:43:31,780
that was the only way he could do it.

4067
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,220
But it's a mistake to go between the
two fighters because at least in my

4068
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:36,701
opinion,

4069
01:43:36,701 --> 01:43:38,570
it makes the fight or
that the fight stops.

4070
01:43:38,571 --> 01:43:42,070
So it got backs off where you could have
landed shots in that time to really,

4071
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:43,540
and Mario hadn't been in his way.

4072
01:43:43,541 --> 01:43:44,680
I agree 100% I mean,

4073
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:45,610
he dropped some,

4074
01:43:45,611 --> 01:43:46,210
he's hurt.

4075
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:47,043
He's on top of him.

4076
01:43:47,050 --> 01:43:48,280
Those couple seconds.

4077
01:43:48,281 --> 01:43:52,070
Sometimes it's all you need to get
enough clarity to grab a leg or

4078
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:54,140
just try to scramble back up
to your feet or to clinch.

4079
01:43:54,380 --> 01:43:57,860
So that second or so were
Mario walks in front of them.

4080
01:43:57,950 --> 01:43:59,150
That like interfered.

4081
01:43:59,370 --> 01:43:59,870
Yeah.

4082
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:00,703
Change physician.

4083
01:44:00,730 --> 01:44:01,190
Right.

4084
01:44:01,190 --> 01:44:02,230
Please.

4085
01:44:03,740 --> 01:44:07,190
I heard what he said and then you still
know Mario fucked up whether Mario

4086
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:08,150
jumped in or not.

4087
01:44:08,460 --> 01:44:10,160
Cody is winning that fight right there.

4088
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:12,830
Maybe he got more head
trauma or not fight was over.

4089
01:44:12,831 --> 01:44:14,720
Maybe to understand what the fans want.

4090
01:44:14,840 --> 01:44:17,690
The fans want Dosha out of clothes.

4091
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:17,910
Yes,

4092
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:18,920
and I do not give a fuck.

4093
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:20,510
You don't care about the fans?

4094
01:44:20,530 --> 01:44:20,980
Oh No,

4095
01:44:20,980 --> 01:44:22,110
not when it comes to the fat guy.

4096
01:44:22,111 --> 01:44:22,944
Safety.

4097
01:44:23,090 --> 01:44:24,260
His first fight in the UFC,

4098
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:25,640
he was out on his feet.

4099
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:27,290
It's all about safety.

4100
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:28,183
I get it.

4101
01:44:28,520 --> 01:44:29,360
Speaking of head trauma,

4102
01:44:29,540 --> 01:44:31,100
I think Eddie's being passive aggressive,

4103
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:34,281
Mario.

4104
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:34,521
Fuck.

4105
01:44:34,521 --> 01:44:35,780
We got to save their lives.

4106
01:44:35,781 --> 01:44:36,650
The real loser here.

4107
01:44:36,651 --> 01:44:37,340
He really fucked.

4108
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:37,551
Oh,

4109
01:44:37,551 --> 01:44:38,191
how dare you.

4110
01:44:38,191 --> 01:44:38,751
You know what I'm saying?

4111
01:44:38,751 --> 01:44:40,070
If there's a loser in the fire tomorrow,

4112
01:44:40,071 --> 01:44:40,904
you're out there.

4113
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:41,091
No,

4114
01:44:41,091 --> 01:44:41,421
Mario,

4115
01:44:41,421 --> 01:44:42,230
I love you the heart,

4116
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:42,591
by the way,

4117
01:44:42,591 --> 01:44:43,071
Brendan.

4118
01:44:43,071 --> 01:44:43,701
You know I love you.

4119
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:44,810
I'm not trying to talk shit.

4120
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:45,703
I know

4121
01:44:49,260 --> 01:44:50,093
Ian

4122
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:53,060
is super valid.

4123
01:44:54,730 --> 01:44:55,020
Yeah,

4124
01:44:55,020 --> 01:44:56,020
we'd love to argue.

4125
01:44:56,100 --> 01:44:57,590
As long as we're clear with that.

4126
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:02,750
He's always been of the mind that you
should let guys take a few more hits on

4127
01:45:02,751 --> 01:45:05,270
the ground rather than a few less.

4128
01:45:05,271 --> 01:45:06,980
That's the majority and I'm saying,

4129
01:45:06,981 --> 01:45:08,090
I'm saying I've been in there,

4130
01:45:08,550 --> 01:45:11,000
you know what I'm saying with that head
trauma and I've seen how it affects

4131
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:12,050
friends and I'm just like,

4132
01:45:12,051 --> 01:45:12,680
man,

4133
01:45:12,680 --> 01:45:16,730
I wish you'd stop it a little earlier
because the odds are homeboy not going to

4134
01:45:16,731 --> 01:45:17,480
win that fight,

4135
01:45:17,480 --> 01:45:19,190
so might as well stop
the fight another day.

4136
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:22,670
[inaudible] Edgar Frankie
Edgar bins claiming.

4137
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:23,271
Exactly.

4138
01:45:23,271 --> 01:45:24,080
There have been plenty of food.

4139
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,280
I love the exceptions though.

4140
01:45:25,490 --> 01:45:27,910
That's the exception in general.

4141
01:45:28,010 --> 01:45:30,710
There would be more of those exceptions
if there would've been more referee's

4142
01:45:30,711 --> 01:45:31,370
letting it go.

4143
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,240
Like how about Weidman?

4144
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:32,750
How do we,

4145
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:34,850
maybe Weidman is not the
same or junior dos Santos,

4146
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,000
maybe it's not the same and fight without
a doubt should have been stopped at

4147
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:38,450
the end of the day.

4148
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:41,120
You start a fund like some kind of fun.

4149
01:45:41,420 --> 01:45:43,940
You don't think [inaudible] fight should
have been stopped at the end of the

4150
01:45:43,941 --> 01:45:45,200
third mount I,

4151
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:45,960
you know what?

4152
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:48,560
I would be lying if I said
I didn't like the violence.

4153
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:49,250
I like,

4154
01:45:49,250 --> 01:45:51,200
I get get any fucking smashed.

4155
01:45:51,201 --> 01:45:52,430
I like that's the majority.

4156
01:45:52,520 --> 01:45:54,920
People enjoy that because
that's what they paid to watch.

4157
01:45:55,050 --> 01:45:58,160
I'm saying from my point
of view as the x fighter,

4158
01:45:58,250 --> 01:45:58,521
it's like,

4159
01:45:58,521 --> 01:45:58,820
dude,

4160
01:45:58,820 --> 01:45:59,660
let them fight another day.

4161
01:45:59,661 --> 01:46:00,530
He has a long career,

4162
01:46:00,531 --> 01:46:01,010
man.

4163
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:01,850
Let's just stop it and

4164
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:05,150
that's why it's so cool when when chuck,

4165
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,233
after he wins,

4166
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:09,550
he's like a fucking fight into like,

4167
01:46:09,620 --> 01:46:10,131
that's why,

4168
01:46:10,131 --> 01:46:12,590
because it's so dangerous
until you could get shut off,

4169
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:13,820
but I didn't get shut off.

4170
01:46:13,820 --> 01:46:14,653
You got,

4171
01:46:14,930 --> 01:46:15,201
I know.

4172
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:15,591
That's great.

4173
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:16,640
And then 20 years,

4174
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,140
then in 20 years,

4175
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:18,650
right.

4176
01:46:18,650 --> 01:46:20,880
Then 20 years you see these
boys and they're drooling.

4177
01:46:20,890 --> 01:46:22,460
They don't know where the
fuck do I know what they knew.

4178
01:46:22,490 --> 01:46:23,570
They know the risk.

4179
01:46:23,810 --> 01:46:24,530
All right.

4180
01:46:24,530 --> 01:46:24,891
I know,

4181
01:46:24,891 --> 01:46:26,810
but we can prevent some
of it is all I'm saying.

4182
01:46:28,370 --> 01:46:29,240
Prevention Fund.

4183
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:32,600
I like sort of prevention felt like
both of your attitudes about this.

4184
01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:33,210
You know,

4185
01:46:33,210 --> 01:46:37,250
my attitude right now is I hope that
science hit some point where medical

4186
01:46:37,251 --> 01:46:38,930
science fix the brain,

4187
01:46:38,931 --> 01:46:41,120
figure out some way to
just revive the brain.

4188
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:42,050
That'd be so dope.

4189
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:42,261
I mean,

4190
01:46:42,261 --> 01:46:42,891
why can't they,

4191
01:46:42,891 --> 01:46:44,290
if they can do all this different stuff,

4192
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:44,720
tweaking,

4193
01:46:44,720 --> 01:46:48,320
they can muscle tissue repair and
they can fix all kinds of stuff.

4194
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,150
Like who knows what they could do with
like maybe one day they're going to be

4195
01:46:51,151 --> 01:46:53,040
able to shoot stem cells in your brain.

4196
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:53,940
That's the,

4197
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:54,810
that's the ticket.

4198
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:55,681
Cause you do that.

4199
01:46:55,681 --> 01:46:56,730
We're all hell yeah.

4200
01:46:56,731 --> 01:47:00,060
Let's go out and we actually got a
bunch of letter you'll see is now what

4201
01:47:00,061 --> 01:47:00,690
happens,

4202
01:47:00,690 --> 01:47:01,830
what are the side effects?

4203
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:05,280
It would be just like you imagine the
side effects fucking nightmares every

4204
01:47:05,281 --> 01:47:05,620
night.

4205
01:47:05,620 --> 01:47:06,600
I'll take it.

4206
01:47:08,730 --> 01:47:09,390
Awesome.

4207
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:11,530
Maybe it's going to be like
steroids for the brain.

4208
01:47:12,370 --> 01:47:12,961
Like you know,

4209
01:47:12,961 --> 01:47:13,850
you see bodybuilders,

4210
01:47:13,950 --> 01:47:15,780
they're fucking ridiculously oversized.

4211
01:47:15,781 --> 01:47:16,440
You going to get people,

4212
01:47:16,440 --> 01:47:17,260
giant bull,

4213
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:19,290
Mars attacks brains and the brains

4214
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:23,550
and shit

4215
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:29,820
continue to run the world.

4216
01:47:29,850 --> 01:47:30,840
And then everybody's going to say,

4217
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:32,550
this fucking juicer is out there.

4218
01:47:32,551 --> 01:47:33,270
One in the world.

4219
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:33,990
We're going to get bad.

4220
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:35,460
And people are brain juice in

4221
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:42,870
the elite [inaudible] attacking

4222
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,750
another classic movies.

4223
01:47:46,760 --> 01:47:49,620
So great job science,

4224
01:47:49,621 --> 01:47:51,770
all sorts of science and
haters be going well.

4225
01:47:52,180 --> 01:47:53,090
Book Brain,

4226
01:47:55,720 --> 01:47:56,700
your mind Bitch,

4227
01:47:56,701 --> 01:47:57,810
cause he's on steroids

4228
01:48:01,320 --> 01:48:02,250
without steroids.

4229
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,770
Carry read my mind and made me calm.

4230
01:48:07,230 --> 01:48:08,070
He's cheating.

4231
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:12,060
You know that's like when you
see a giant bodybuilder do this.

4232
01:48:12,061 --> 01:48:13,440
The first thing that every guy says,

4233
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:13,820
boy,

4234
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:16,200
he under committed to that kick.

4235
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:18,050
He backed off that kid.

4236
01:48:18,051 --> 01:48:18,884
He'd come in,

4237
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,250
he caught him with a beautiful counter.

4238
01:48:20,340 --> 01:48:22,950
Imagine jeopardy where
they test for steroids.

4239
01:48:25,370 --> 01:48:27,040
Is this all

4240
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,170
that was?

4241
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:33,240
That was a big fuck up by Mario.

4242
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:34,890
That's a big fuck up right there.

4243
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,940
I mean,

4244
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:36,360
look,

4245
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:37,193
I don't want to die.

4246
01:48:37,200 --> 01:48:38,190
I don't want to do that job.

4247
01:48:38,490 --> 01:48:40,810
That's sort of the way harder
job than doing commentary.

4248
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:41,693
Commentary.

4249
01:48:41,730 --> 01:48:42,563
Commentary is the,

4250
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:46,200
my job doing come to is the easiest
one of all the jobs in the UFC.

4251
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:51,200
Slightly just slightly harder
than Ariana's job lightly.

4252
01:48:51,710 --> 01:48:54,250
If it's slightly harder
than it [inaudible] go away,

4253
01:48:54,260 --> 01:48:55,500
they have to replace you and was like,

4254
01:48:55,501 --> 01:48:57,300
God placed me right now to look here.

4255
01:48:58,050 --> 01:48:59,040
I am doing it.

4256
01:48:59,040 --> 01:48:59,873
We're here.

4257
01:49:00,120 --> 01:49:01,200
We're here in woodland hills,

4258
01:49:01,201 --> 01:49:06,201
partying it up and more
people are listening to you
talk about margins and Brian

4259
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:09,330
Stann breakdown the
fight just the way it is.

4260
01:49:09,340 --> 01:49:10,173
What the fuck

4261
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,030
this shit

4262
01:49:21,230 --> 01:49:21,660
gotta be?

4263
01:49:21,660 --> 01:49:22,330
Juicing.

4264
01:49:22,330 --> 01:49:23,610
He knows Maco removed.

4265
01:49:23,670 --> 01:49:25,170
They put his brain to fish tank.

4266
01:49:25,171 --> 01:49:26,400
He's a fucking juicer.

4267
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:29,100
He knows he can cook

4268
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:32,190
pop quizzes.

4269
01:49:33,660 --> 01:49:35,070
He's got like 10 degrees.

4270
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:36,330
What's the,

4271
01:49:36,330 --> 01:49:37,740
what's the host of jeopardy?

4272
01:49:37,741 --> 01:49:38,251
What's that guys?

4273
01:49:38,251 --> 01:49:39,900
Now it's true balance Fetzer back.

4274
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,860
There's going to be like Dana White
doing press conferences and shit.

4275
01:49:43,861 --> 01:49:47,920
We got the most stringent
tests of all game areas.

4276
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:52,720
That's going to be dudes
way smarter than Einstein.

4277
01:49:53,770 --> 01:49:54,160
Man,

4278
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:55,660
that's going to happen for sure.

4279
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:56,321
It is.

4280
01:49:56,321 --> 01:49:57,154
They already have,

4281
01:49:57,400 --> 01:49:59,950
they already have things like Modafinil,

4282
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:01,750
which they've outlawed in the Olympics.

4283
01:50:01,751 --> 01:50:04,960
You can't have that in the Olympics
anymore and that started out as a smart

4284
01:50:04,961 --> 01:50:05,590
drug.

4285
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:07,030
That was a drug that they created.

4286
01:50:07,180 --> 01:50:08,500
They had to say that they want,

4287
01:50:08,501 --> 01:50:10,720
they've made it for people
that have narcolepsy.

4288
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:11,860
It made me angry.

4289
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,090
They originally didn't,

4290
01:50:13,150 --> 01:50:13,983
they didn't cut.

4291
01:50:14,380 --> 01:50:15,820
Modafinil makes you angry.

4292
01:50:15,940 --> 01:50:16,660
Really.

4293
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,860
I took it for an extended period of,

4294
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:18,700
because you're so smart,

4295
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:20,410
you're so smart and you get angry.

4296
01:50:20,411 --> 01:50:21,440
Then how don't,

4297
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:23,891
here's a funny thing,

4298
01:50:23,891 --> 01:50:24,091
I it,

4299
01:50:24,091 --> 01:50:24,701
you'll like this.

4300
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:27,400
They came up with it just for
performance enhancing reasons.

4301
01:50:27,401 --> 01:50:28,570
It was created for that,

4302
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:30,820
but then because it's a prescription drug,

4303
01:50:31,060 --> 01:50:33,820
they had to have a reason to
prescribe it like an illness.

4304
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:35,230
That's how drugs are set up.

4305
01:50:35,231 --> 01:50:36,160
Like you can't say,

4306
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:36,970
hey,

4307
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:38,620
you need a prescription
to be more awesome.

4308
01:50:38,650 --> 01:50:40,090
I'm going to take awesome pills and no,

4309
01:50:40,091 --> 01:50:41,110
you have to have something wrong with you.

4310
01:50:41,111 --> 01:50:42,040
I'm not awesome.

4311
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:43,910
I got diagnosed as an awesome.

4312
01:50:43,990 --> 01:50:46,020
So then once you diagnosis unawesome,

4313
01:50:46,120 --> 01:50:47,170
you can take modafinil.

4314
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:51,490
So you have to like say like
I'm experiencing fatigue or uh,

4315
01:50:51,491 --> 01:50:51,971
you know,

4316
01:50:51,971 --> 01:50:54,490
I drive and I need to
stay awake when I drive.

4317
01:50:54,610 --> 01:50:56,560
It has to be something like
that and get narcolepsy.

4318
01:50:56,650 --> 01:50:59,710
So they have this drug that's used to,

4319
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:00,130
oh,

4320
01:51:00,130 --> 01:51:02,140
silicon valley silicone,

4321
01:51:02,170 --> 01:51:02,711
how do they say it?

4322
01:51:02,711 --> 01:51:03,190
Silicone.

4323
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:04,023
Wait a minute.

4324
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:05,800
You guys listen.

4325
01:51:05,801 --> 01:51:07,900
These guys that are running
these tech companies,

4326
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:09,550
they're all taking modafinil.

4327
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:10,900
It is the drugs.

4328
01:51:12,670 --> 01:51:13,121
It's just,

4329
01:51:13,121 --> 01:51:13,954
this is real.

4330
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:15,521
Modafinil,

4331
01:51:15,521 --> 01:51:16,600
I'll get you this prescription.

4332
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:17,713
It's um,

4333
01:51:18,450 --> 01:51:20,120
it was real new vision.

4334
01:51:20,140 --> 01:51:21,980
Have you heard about the Jack [inaudible]?

4335
01:51:22,270 --> 01:51:23,081
I have it.

4336
01:51:23,081 --> 01:51:23,621
I have prescription.

4337
01:51:23,621 --> 01:51:24,370
I want it.

4338
01:51:24,370 --> 01:51:25,180
I'll give you something.

4339
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:26,380
No wonder you're so fucking smart.

4340
01:51:26,381 --> 01:51:27,410
I knew it was bullshit.

4341
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:27,911
Pretty sure.

4342
01:51:27,911 --> 01:51:28,810
I just witnessed a crime.

4343
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,240
Does know how to get
him into prescription.

4344
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:33,940
What it does is it gives you,

4345
01:51:33,941 --> 01:51:35,230
I don't very rarely take it.

4346
01:51:35,231 --> 01:51:36,070
This is what I take it.

4347
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:36,671
I'll take it.

4348
01:51:36,671 --> 01:51:38,500
If I know I'm tired and I got a,

4349
01:51:38,501 --> 01:51:40,660
I got to drive or if
I've got to do something,

4350
01:51:40,690 --> 01:51:41,650
I really want to be sharp.

4351
01:51:41,680 --> 01:51:42,513
I don't feel,

4352
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:45,220
but I don't take it
before podcasts anymore.

4353
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:47,350
I've taken it for like four or five.

4354
01:51:47,351 --> 01:51:49,150
Podcast would be the time to take it.

4355
01:51:49,240 --> 01:51:49,571
Yeah,

4356
01:51:49,571 --> 01:51:49,841
no,

4357
01:51:49,841 --> 01:51:50,674
not necessarily.

4358
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:54,370
Because sometimes you
want a conversation to be,

4359
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:55,030
um,

4360
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,750
as well.

4361
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:58,530
You don't want it to be too ramped up in,

4362
01:51:58,570 --> 01:51:59,620
I mean like you gotta know,

4363
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:01,480
you gotta know like feeling dumb gas.

4364
01:52:01,481 --> 01:52:02,710
If you want to be at their level,

4365
01:52:03,180 --> 01:52:07,000
you want to be able to be casual
effortlessly as well as be amped up.

4366
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:09,700
See I think modafinil is really
good if I want to be amped up,

4367
01:52:09,880 --> 01:52:13,000
but I don't necessarily think it would
be good if I wanted to be casual.

4368
01:52:13,300 --> 01:52:14,020
You know what I'm saying?

4369
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:14,491
Cause it's,

4370
01:52:14,491 --> 01:52:17,050
it's to take it like Viagara
on the first day you're like,

4371
01:52:17,051 --> 01:52:18,860
I'm going to fucking dazzle this

4372
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:23,270
[inaudible] shit.

4373
01:52:23,900 --> 01:52:27,370
[inaudible] coming to me.

4374
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:28,240
I don't know what it is.

4375
01:52:28,241 --> 01:52:30,550
You're like breaking
down fucking molecules.

4376
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:31,993
Just

4377
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:33,583
it doesn't work anymore.

4378
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:35,100
Cause I was just do is go into her phone.

4379
01:52:35,101 --> 01:52:37,110
I just googled what you
said and it's nonsense.

4380
01:52:37,940 --> 01:52:40,460
What is the closest thing to limitless?

4381
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:42,360
You googled what?

4382
01:52:42,720 --> 01:52:43,650
You're the one that talking to me.

4383
01:52:43,890 --> 01:52:45,060
You're the one that's talking about it.

4384
01:52:45,080 --> 01:52:45,913
What are you talking about?

4385
01:52:46,500 --> 01:52:48,270
Trying to figure out what that noise was.

4386
01:52:48,570 --> 01:52:49,100
Hearing noises.

4387
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:49,860
Whole fucking time.

4388
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:50,350
We're talking.

4389
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:50,510
Yeah.

4390
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:52,780
I thought I heard some shit to Jamie.

4391
01:52:52,790 --> 01:52:54,680
Where are you feeling like wait a second.

4392
01:52:56,830 --> 01:52:57,663
They put acid in.

4393
01:52:57,890 --> 01:53:00,170
Jamie were slain the Mars tax thing.

4394
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:04,610
You should have a tropic
thunder on that bitch.

4395
01:53:04,670 --> 01:53:06,700
Not fucking Mars Attacks Act.

4396
01:53:06,770 --> 01:53:10,690
Act One of the tax like top
200 so don't sleep on margin.

4397
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:13,030
The tax.

4398
01:53:13,031 --> 01:53:13,864
Good

4399
01:53:16,670 --> 01:53:17,210
man.

4400
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:18,500
He's hilarious.

4401
01:53:19,400 --> 01:53:20,091
It still holds up.

4402
01:53:20,091 --> 01:53:20,960
I watched it a year ago.

4403
01:53:20,990 --> 01:53:21,560
It's funny,

4404
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:21,770
Dude.

4405
01:53:21,770 --> 01:53:23,330
I just watched by six months ago.

4406
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,193
It's really funny.

4407
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,473
Tim.

4408
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:26,091
Tim Burton.

4409
01:53:26,091 --> 01:53:26,291
Yeah.

4410
01:53:26,291 --> 01:53:27,200
It's a classic.

4411
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:28,140
That's a classic

4412
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:31,551
dude.

4413
01:53:31,551 --> 01:53:32,030
When you,

4414
01:53:32,030 --> 01:53:33,200
when you tell him what to watch something,

4415
01:53:33,201 --> 01:53:34,730
I watch it Thrones.

4416
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:37,940
I resisted game of Thrones for gears.

4417
01:53:38,090 --> 01:53:38,811
I've never seen it.

4418
01:53:38,811 --> 01:53:39,330
He said,

4419
01:53:39,330 --> 01:53:39,480
well,

4420
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,313
I can watch it.

4421
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,930
Of course.

4422
01:53:41,930 --> 01:53:42,741
Who doesn't like game?

4423
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:44,330
I've never seen game of Thrones.

4424
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,051
I'm waiting.

4425
01:53:45,051 --> 01:53:47,310
They should arrested two studies.

4426
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:47,830
Hold on.

4427
01:53:47,830 --> 01:53:48,663
Is there?

4428
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:50,330
Yes.

4429
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,170
I'm not going to watch it.

4430
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:53,313
I shoot.

4431
01:53:57,240 --> 01:54:00,620
All right man.

4432
01:54:01,060 --> 01:54:02,720
Get in a conversation
with someone that does

4433
01:54:06,900 --> 01:54:09,280
listen to her Santa Claus.

4434
01:54:10,040 --> 01:54:10,910
Time to fucking grow up.

4435
01:54:10,911 --> 01:54:12,380
Peter Pan's Santa Claus is,

4436
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:13,710
that's another story there.

4437
01:54:13,790 --> 01:54:15,210
There's not enough evidence for,

4438
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:20,240
have you seen Vikings speaking
of I supposed to be factual.

4439
01:54:20,360 --> 01:54:20,840
No.

4440
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:21,673
Is that bad?

4441
01:54:21,740 --> 01:54:21,921
No,

4442
01:54:21,921 --> 01:54:22,760
it's fucking awesome.

4443
01:54:22,761 --> 01:54:23,300
The show.

4444
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:23,601
Yeah.

4445
01:54:23,601 --> 01:54:24,560
If I can just go ahead.

4446
01:54:24,561 --> 01:54:25,680
It's all about Ragnar loss.

4447
01:54:25,700 --> 01:54:28,190
Brick thought reality.

4448
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:28,480
Yes.

4449
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,320
It's based on reality and it's vikings.

4450
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,060
Vikings just fucking ruin everything.

4451
01:54:32,061 --> 01:54:32,601
It's awesome.

4452
01:54:32,601 --> 01:54:33,140
They just,

4453
01:54:33,140 --> 01:54:34,790
they were hardly the first terrorist.

4454
01:54:34,820 --> 01:54:35,511
That's what I heard.

4455
01:54:35,511 --> 01:54:35,960
Fuck yeah,

4456
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:36,950
they were conquerors.

4457
01:54:37,460 --> 01:54:40,070
There was a bad time
when someone wasn't like,

4458
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:41,091
you know,

4459
01:54:41,091 --> 01:54:44,240
but a few hundred years ago we
were a ship showed up at your,

4460
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:46,310
you're sure you got a real fucking problem

4461
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:52,580
with fucking balls of fire ready to go.

4462
01:54:52,581 --> 01:54:54,110
There's no technology drones.

4463
01:54:54,111 --> 01:54:55,970
You're going to have to battle
that shit with your hands.

4464
01:54:55,970 --> 01:54:58,130
Imagine living back then
you would get nothing done.

4465
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,233
Limit

4466
01:55:00,180 --> 01:55:04,880
towards getting ready for the
invasion battles the same,

4467
01:55:04,881 --> 01:55:06,230
making arrows,

4468
01:55:07,080 --> 01:55:07,913
trying not to die,

4469
01:55:07,940 --> 01:55:09,950
trying to live past 25 dude,

4470
01:55:09,951 --> 01:55:10,400
come on.

4471
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:10,940
You got to,

4472
01:55:10,940 --> 01:55:13,230
when there's like a rugby team of like,

4473
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:14,870
like a thousand people here,

4474
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:15,681
thousand people there,

4475
01:55:15,681 --> 01:55:17,090
and they just rush each other.

4476
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,610
How the fuck do you got?

4477
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:22,970
The only way you can convince the guy
to do that is you got to make sure he

4478
01:55:22,971 --> 01:55:26,090
believes in Jesus and you gotta make
sure he believes in God because you're

4479
01:55:26,091 --> 01:55:26,924
doing it for God.

4480
01:55:27,530 --> 01:55:28,500
Shit.

4481
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:30,290
But that was back then.

4482
01:55:30,291 --> 01:55:31,041
So whatever,

4483
01:55:31,041 --> 01:55:31,874
whatever it is,

4484
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:33,140
I believe with that shit,

4485
01:55:33,141 --> 01:55:33,321
Bro.

4486
01:55:33,321 --> 01:55:34,610
That's like the suicide bombers.

4487
01:55:34,611 --> 01:55:35,210
Now,

4488
01:55:35,210 --> 01:55:37,220
the only reason they can convince them
because they think they're going to

4489
01:55:37,221 --> 01:55:37,610
heaven.

4490
01:55:37,610 --> 01:55:38,870
How about that bit you had man.

4491
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:39,320
Ah,

4492
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:40,153
Shit.

4493
01:55:40,780 --> 01:55:41,613
How about,

4494
01:55:41,660 --> 01:55:42,500
I don't even know how it goes,

4495
01:55:42,501 --> 01:55:43,680
but it was something about,

4496
01:55:43,681 --> 01:55:44,160
uh,

4497
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,850
one of the guys that got sent over here
to blow up America just started partying

4498
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:48,684
at the Skype

4499
01:55:51,690 --> 01:55:52,440
phone calls.

4500
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:53,273
They go,

4501
01:55:53,540 --> 01:55:54,690
why are you still alive?

4502
01:55:58,430 --> 01:55:59,263
Some shiny happy.

4503
01:56:00,580 --> 01:56:01,800
Why are you still alive?

4504
01:56:02,140 --> 01:56:03,720
Because he's supposed
to blow yourself a week.

4505
01:56:04,170 --> 01:56:05,790
Here's what to blow
yourself up a week ago.

4506
01:56:06,590 --> 01:56:06,750
No,

4507
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:07,583
no,

4508
01:56:08,340 --> 01:56:09,173
I'll get the

4509
01:56:11,530 --> 01:56:12,363
Mercedes.

4510
01:56:14,660 --> 01:56:14,910
Good.

4511
01:56:14,910 --> 01:56:16,170
Why are you still alive?

4512
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:20,310
That's the greatest fight ever.

4513
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:21,510
Why are you still alive?

4514
01:56:21,920 --> 01:56:22,830
Angry phone calls,

4515
01:56:23,970 --> 01:56:25,050
those shiny happy.

4516
01:56:28,100 --> 01:56:29,400
That would be a great animated,

4517
01:56:29,401 --> 01:56:32,460
a little series about some dudes that
would come over to the states to where

4518
01:56:32,461 --> 01:56:34,060
supposed to blow
themselves up comedy with.

4519
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,820
They just started partying and they said,

4520
01:56:35,821 --> 01:56:36,150
fuck.

4521
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,610
They realize it's awesome here.

4522
01:56:39,170 --> 01:56:41,550
You never going to see a suicide
bomber from Beverly Hills.

4523
01:56:42,010 --> 01:56:43,530
Like they have to come from somewhere.

4524
01:56:43,531 --> 01:56:44,364
That's sucks.

4525
01:56:44,570 --> 01:56:47,850
But like the idea of death is
like more appealing staying alive.

4526
01:56:48,210 --> 01:56:49,750
[inaudible]

4527
01:56:51,370 --> 01:56:53,700
the guys that are organizing
the shit in the Middle East,

4528
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:56,550
they've got to make sure they send
them to like Minnesota or some shit.

4529
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:59,010
They can't send them on
a one way ticket to la.

4530
01:56:59,110 --> 01:56:59,790
Never works.

4531
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:00,990
They realized that doesn't work.

4532
01:57:01,320 --> 01:57:02,390
They kept fuck with La.

4533
01:57:02,670 --> 01:57:04,950
They got to send them to
Illinois or some shit like that.

4534
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:07,433
Yeah.

4535
01:57:09,970 --> 01:57:11,640
They'll go to him with
the plants are like,

4536
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:11,971
okay,

4537
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:13,570
let's do it after like a week ago,

4538
01:57:13,571 --> 01:57:14,700
this fucking do it.

4539
01:57:16,850 --> 01:57:18,040
We do it for you.

4540
01:57:18,041 --> 01:57:18,470
Send it in.

4541
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:21,210
Miami river was huge problems.

4542
01:57:21,211 --> 01:57:21,361
No.

4543
01:57:21,361 --> 01:57:26,250
Seven verse seven there's gotta be some
guy convincing dudes in the Middle East.

4544
01:57:26,251 --> 01:57:27,090
They're like looking for the,

4545
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:27,501
you know,

4546
01:57:27,501 --> 01:57:30,090
like hitting just up to the dumbest
motherfuckers they hypnotize.

4547
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:35,190
There's gotta be some guy looking like
to convince them to blow themselves up.

4548
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:36,510
You got to throw pussy at him,

4549
01:57:36,511 --> 01:57:36,840
right.

4550
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:38,230
Number 72 virgins or their,

4551
01:57:38,270 --> 01:57:41,320
their Iq Iq levels are lower than it is.

4552
01:57:41,970 --> 01:57:42,810
Part of your bill is like,

4553
01:57:42,811 --> 01:57:46,560
how did they get to 72 they must have
offered 12 at first and like there's like,

4554
01:57:46,561 --> 01:57:47,520
I ain't blow myself

4555
01:57:49,850 --> 01:57:51,990
one night.

4556
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:54,550
I've talked to God final offer,

4557
01:57:54,551 --> 01:57:55,384
72

4558
01:57:57,650 --> 01:57:58,970
pitches.

4559
01:57:59,130 --> 01:58:00,540
They were all very fine.

4560
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,230
If that was real,

4561
01:58:04,231 --> 01:58:09,190
if you could prove that shit killed
yourself and you've got 72 virgins for the

4562
01:58:09,270 --> 01:58:10,103
eternity,

4563
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:12,540
I know personally that would do that shit.

4564
01:58:14,480 --> 01:58:16,380
You just got convince me drills.

4565
01:58:16,470 --> 01:58:17,161
That's a good deal.

4566
01:58:17,161 --> 01:58:19,800
70 rotate one every every week.

4567
01:58:19,870 --> 01:58:20,703
Boom.

4568
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:21,511
Yeah,

4569
01:58:21,511 --> 01:58:23,820
but what if it all burns
out when they all die?

4570
01:58:23,821 --> 01:58:25,560
Because if you get it
talking about eternity,

4571
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,090
like you might be a terminal,

4572
01:58:27,180 --> 01:58:29,010
but if they're really 72 virgins,

4573
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:32,580
they're going to say their own swag 20
and so they got like 80 years of life

4574
01:58:32,581 --> 01:58:32,941
left.

4575
01:58:32,941 --> 01:58:34,020
If they eat vegetables,

4576
01:58:36,810 --> 01:58:38,520
stay alive and there'll be old ladies.

4577
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,220
So you only want to fuck
them for the first 40 years.

4578
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:45,190
50 and 60 it's like charity work.

4579
01:58:45,220 --> 01:58:48,630
Then your jacket mouthy
not to break their hands.

4580
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,890
The dealership and the guy
breaks out the calculator.

4581
01:58:53,891 --> 01:58:54,121
It was like,

4582
01:58:54,121 --> 01:58:56,230
well you know if I can give you this many,

4583
01:58:56,231 --> 01:58:56,710
but uh,

4584
01:58:56,710 --> 01:58:57,543
I think,

4585
01:58:58,820 --> 01:59:03,820
imagine the negotiations are 72 they
decided on 72 they knew 50 wouldn't be

4586
01:59:04,481 --> 01:59:04,930
enough.

4587
01:59:04,930 --> 01:59:05,763
You're not going to get any.

4588
01:59:05,810 --> 01:59:08,890
It like the lottery where you take
like a little bit every month.

4589
01:59:09,070 --> 01:59:09,903
So listen,

4590
01:59:10,300 --> 01:59:14,800
I want to keep this rolling bitches at
once and then they will die and grow old.

4591
01:59:14,801 --> 01:59:15,491
This is what you want.

4592
01:59:15,491 --> 01:59:19,780
You want 100 people in the bombing sat,

4593
01:59:19,781 --> 01:59:21,100
was he two versions?

4594
01:59:21,340 --> 01:59:23,740
One for every 40 50 years?

4595
01:59:24,590 --> 01:59:25,423
Good.

4596
01:59:29,370 --> 01:59:31,110
They're on the fence and then the side,

4597
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:31,421
no,

4598
01:59:31,421 --> 01:59:32,254
and then something bad.

4599
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,200
The car breaks down and the fucking
transmission falls out and they're like,

4600
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:36,253
or like,

4601
01:59:36,790 --> 01:59:38,540
and then they're saying,

4602
01:59:43,550 --> 01:59:44,980
they're saying a lot of them,

4603
01:59:45,010 --> 01:59:45,700
they're committed,

4604
01:59:45,700 --> 01:59:46,481
they're girls doing,

4605
01:59:46,481 --> 01:59:47,850
they're forcing girls to do it now.

4606
01:59:48,100 --> 01:59:49,020
They talked him into it.

4607
01:59:49,050 --> 01:59:49,920
It was part of my base.

4608
01:59:49,921 --> 01:59:50,920
How are you going to fuck?

4609
01:59:51,030 --> 01:59:51,640
What was that?

4610
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:52,361
That was part of my bed.

4611
01:59:52,361 --> 01:59:52,740
I was like,

4612
01:59:52,740 --> 01:59:55,450
you're never gonna to see
female suicide bombers.

4613
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,910
Dick is just not worth that much

4614
01:59:59,490 --> 02:00:04,060
or way too accessible slaves and
they turn them into the suicide.

4615
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:06,970
You said on your bed,

4616
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:10,210
Dick is worth like that fly or you find
after you leave a club and there's a

4617
02:00:10,211 --> 02:00:11,044
flyer,

4618
02:00:11,050 --> 02:00:12,620
it tick is worth that much

4619
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:17,910
fucking great.

4620
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:19,690
A suicide bomber shit.

4621
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:20,561
That was a whole wall.

4622
02:00:20,561 --> 02:00:21,880
That was what I was obsessed.

4623
02:00:22,480 --> 02:00:23,610
I was obsessed with.

4624
02:00:23,611 --> 02:00:28,611
It was right after nine 11 nine 11
nine 11 to that was like 2001 to 2005

4625
02:00:29,951 --> 02:00:30,610
material.

4626
02:00:30,610 --> 02:00:32,740
That's when I put that
on a shiny happy jihad.

4627
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:33,431
Oh Man.

4628
02:00:33,431 --> 02:00:34,360
That could easily,

4629
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:38,140
easily been like some fucking animated
series about these guys that got talked

4630
02:00:38,141 --> 02:00:39,220
into blowing themselves up.

4631
02:00:39,221 --> 02:00:39,700
They get freaked.

4632
02:00:39,700 --> 02:00:40,960
Forgot about a lot of my bits.

4633
02:00:40,961 --> 02:00:41,920
72 virtual.

4634
02:00:41,990 --> 02:00:42,823
You brought

4635
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:45,820
up the sky bar.

4636
02:00:45,821 --> 02:00:47,020
We talked about doing that.

4637
02:00:47,021 --> 02:00:49,000
We talked to him making a bit out of that,

4638
02:00:50,490 --> 02:00:51,320
but you to,

4639
02:00:51,320 --> 02:00:51,701
you're like,

4640
02:00:51,701 --> 02:00:52,420
you know what?

4641
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:57,420
I don't need no crazy motherfuckers coming
after that was discussed when we were

4642
02:00:57,581 --> 02:00:59,280
on the man show that
was actually discussed.

4643
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:00,880
Kennedy's number

4644
02:01:05,540 --> 02:01:07,210
number is now out of the house.

4645
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:09,830
Hauntcon narrows.

4646
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:10,673
Very good.

4647
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:11,771
Very good.

4648
02:01:11,771 --> 02:01:14,110
Your Shit so very strong.

4649
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:16,690
Do you remember when Brunson
took down fucking your boy?

4650
02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:18,760
He did turn up tiny head,

4651
02:01:18,761 --> 02:01:22,120
kicked him to remember that he hit
you over a mirror with that switch.

4652
02:01:22,121 --> 02:01:23,200
Kick off to the left leg,

4653
02:01:23,310 --> 02:01:24,220
kept taking them down.

4654
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:25,143
He's a stud.

4655
02:01:25,180 --> 02:01:27,760
Derek Bronson is a breakout fight.

4656
02:01:28,030 --> 02:01:29,260
He's getting better every time,

4657
02:01:29,261 --> 02:01:30,290
but he's like looking good,

4658
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:32,140
knocking on the door of potential,

4659
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:33,153
you know,

4660
02:01:33,310 --> 02:01:35,620
looking at Greg Jackson and his coat.

4661
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:40,170
I'd love to figure out how's
Greg's going to do the [inaudible]

4662
02:01:40,170 --> 02:01:40,550
been what?

4663
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:41,090
Sorry?

4664
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:43,950
Is anybody been watching
Paul Daley in Beltre?

4665
02:01:44,120 --> 02:01:44,953
How's he been looking?

4666
02:01:45,070 --> 02:01:46,280
You just knocked out a dude.

4667
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:48,710
He mocks out everybody
just with that left hook.

4668
02:01:48,711 --> 02:01:49,720
You just finished it.

4669
02:01:49,721 --> 02:01:52,240
This left hand is strong.

4670
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:53,750
He was fun to watch a man.

4671
02:01:53,751 --> 02:01:55,790
I was so bummed out
when he got kicked out.

4672
02:01:55,791 --> 02:01:57,400
The whole thing was such a Josh Kushner.

4673
02:01:57,410 --> 02:01:58,940
So unnecessary man.

4674
02:01:58,941 --> 02:02:03,260
I don't know what horrible nasty
shit cost check was saying to him.

4675
02:02:03,680 --> 02:02:04,430
Josh at Dick,

4676
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:05,263
he probably deserved it

4677
02:02:06,780 --> 02:02:08,260
was kept punching gap.

4678
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:08,500
Yeah,

4679
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:09,321
you definitely,

4680
02:02:09,321 --> 02:02:11,840
you definitely should have never ever,

4681
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:12,770
ever do that.

4682
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:13,880
But man,

4683
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:14,990
he didn't and he didn't land.

4684
02:02:14,991 --> 02:02:15,920
The Punch was,

4685
02:02:15,960 --> 02:02:17,780
even though he should have apologized,

4686
02:02:18,050 --> 02:02:18,381
you know,

4687
02:02:18,381 --> 02:02:20,060
it's like if cooler heads prevailed,

4688
02:02:20,180 --> 02:02:21,050
if I was his friend,

4689
02:02:21,051 --> 02:02:21,291
man,

4690
02:02:21,291 --> 02:02:22,790
I would've pulled him aside and I said,

4691
02:02:22,810 --> 02:02:23,301
I would've said,

4692
02:02:23,301 --> 02:02:23,570
Liz,

4693
02:02:23,570 --> 02:02:25,340
make a public apology.

4694
02:02:25,341 --> 02:02:26,630
You lost your fucking mind.

4695
02:02:26,820 --> 02:02:31,010
Pr Josh Koscheck cause he
got inside my head so hard.

4696
02:02:31,190 --> 02:02:32,420
I got completely out of character.

4697
02:02:32,421 --> 02:02:33,081
I'm embarrassed,

4698
02:02:33,081 --> 02:02:35,150
I'm ashamed it'll never happen again.

4699
02:02:35,180 --> 02:02:36,200
I am so sorry.

4700
02:02:36,201 --> 02:02:37,490
I disrespect the sport.

4701
02:02:37,670 --> 02:02:41,300
I fully expected to be fined and
suspended for a period of time,

4702
02:02:41,450 --> 02:02:42,950
but I will make reparations and I'm very,

4703
02:02:42,951 --> 02:02:44,210
I'm very disappointed in myself.

4704
02:02:44,230 --> 02:02:45,800
Don't talk to and do whatever you have to.

4705
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:48,350
And then they would all been under the
water right now and he would have had

4706
02:02:48,351 --> 02:02:51,950
some insane fights with condit
and sane fights with Lawler.

4707
02:02:52,070 --> 02:02:53,420
Insane fights with so many guys.

4708
02:02:53,421 --> 02:02:56,090
We were robbed of some insane
fights from Paul Daley.

4709
02:02:56,240 --> 02:03:00,810
He is one of the best 170 pounds
strikers on planetary MMA,

4710
02:03:01,250 --> 02:03:01,671
MMA,

4711
02:03:01,671 --> 02:03:03,530
his fucking lefts last hand.

4712
02:03:03,580 --> 02:03:05,390
His left hook is a piston.

4713
02:03:05,420 --> 02:03:06,620
He's one of the best in MMA.

4714
02:03:06,650 --> 02:03:07,490
I love when he fights.

4715
02:03:07,491 --> 02:03:09,170
Still so exciting.

4716
02:03:09,950 --> 02:03:11,840
Oh Jesus Christ.

4717
02:03:11,990 --> 02:03:12,860
He Fuck Dwayne?

4718
02:03:12,920 --> 02:03:13,753
Yes.

4719
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:14,840
Our brother Dwayne.

4720
02:03:14,850 --> 02:03:15,650
Dude.

4721
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:16,131
Dude,

4722
02:03:16,131 --> 02:03:18,410
he's terrifying from Martin Kampmann.

4723
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:19,713
Yup.

4724
02:03:19,790 --> 02:03:20,570
Yeah.

4725
02:03:20,570 --> 02:03:22,310
Look at wrong throwing down now.

4726
02:03:22,311 --> 02:03:23,270
Holy Shit.

4727
02:03:23,450 --> 02:03:23,610
Yeah,

4728
02:03:23,610 --> 02:03:25,430
on narrow can box up with it.

4729
02:03:25,510 --> 02:03:25,820
Yup.

4730
02:03:25,820 --> 02:03:26,570
He's stuck with,

4731
02:03:26,570 --> 02:03:26,841
well,

4732
02:03:26,841 --> 02:03:27,950
he's American top team.

4733
02:03:27,951 --> 02:03:31,430
He's their head Jujitsu coach and
a lot of those guys a retired,

4734
02:03:31,431 --> 02:03:31,941
you know what I mean?

4735
02:03:31,941 --> 02:03:32,774
He stuck with it.

4736
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,380
Yeah.

4737
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:34,760
You know a lot of experience.

4738
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:36,720
It takes so long to get good at strike.

4739
02:03:36,740 --> 02:03:37,401
Oh look at this.

4740
02:03:37,401 --> 02:03:38,690
He gets you down and you'd be in trouble,

4741
02:03:39,300 --> 02:03:41,600
but you got to get Derek
Bronson down there.

4742
02:03:42,080 --> 02:03:42,480
Look at that.

4743
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:43,161
Take down defense.

4744
02:03:43,161 --> 02:03:43,880
She's the show.

4745
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:45,860
She's got a nasty left kick to,

4746
02:03:46,100 --> 02:03:49,520
he throws it from south port or he
can throw it real good off the switch.

4747
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:51,770
I'm pretty sure he hit Romero
with it off the switch,

4748
02:03:51,771 --> 02:03:55,710
but he was doing oh shot from Brazil.

4749
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:56,291
What's going to happen?

4750
02:03:56,291 --> 02:03:57,390
What kind of control from there?

4751
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:58,233
Like you want to go down?

4752
02:03:58,800 --> 02:03:59,570
I felt like mine,

4753
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:01,080
but he's kind of like your
home against the fence.

4754
02:04:03,380 --> 02:04:04,280
Oh my God.

4755
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,593
I don't know man.

4756
02:04:06,600 --> 02:04:07,500
What do you call,

4757
02:04:07,840 --> 02:04:10,790
what do you have to do
to be defensive here?

4758
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:12,200
I mean like got to push them.

4759
02:04:13,030 --> 02:04:14,090
You got to push them away.

4760
02:04:14,220 --> 02:04:15,053
You got to push them away.

4761
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:18,290
How do you get the rough
for you to not stop it?

4762
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:19,163
You got to

4763
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:21,273
tell you that,

4764
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:21,920
but,

4765
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:22,221
okay.

4766
02:04:22,221 --> 02:04:23,390
How about cowboy and dos?

4767
02:04:23,391 --> 02:04:23,941
Anjos he would,

4768
02:04:23,941 --> 02:04:24,771
he never went and lived there.

4769
02:04:24,771 --> 02:04:25,400
He was fine.

4770
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:26,233
He didn't move,

4771
02:04:27,460 --> 02:04:28,060
move jobs,

4772
02:04:28,060 --> 02:04:31,570
but he can't move cause he got kicked
out of kind of moved and he was trying to

4773
02:04:31,571 --> 02:04:32,890
move to garden.

4774
02:04:33,540 --> 02:04:34,580
It's over now to the point.

4775
02:04:34,610 --> 02:04:34,941
All right,

4776
02:04:34,941 --> 02:04:35,610
that's it.

4777
02:04:35,610 --> 02:04:36,443
That's over now.

4778
02:04:37,110 --> 02:04:38,010
How many punches he just

4779
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:38,640
through?

4780
02:04:38,640 --> 02:04:40,650
It's hard to do in fighting
against that fence.

4781
02:04:41,460 --> 02:04:44,340
Doesn't matter what guard you're
playing against the fence.

4782
02:04:44,341 --> 02:04:44,920
It's fucking,

4783
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,740
it's not going to get off the fence.

4784
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:47,910
You gotta get off the fence.

4785
02:04:47,940 --> 02:04:48,773
No guards.

4786
02:04:49,200 --> 02:04:50,190
You have to work.

4787
02:04:50,250 --> 02:04:50,941
If you're not working,

4788
02:04:50,941 --> 02:04:51,630
they're going to stop it.

4789
02:04:51,630 --> 02:04:52,463
Derek Brunson,

4790
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,000
he needs a break out fight.

4791
02:04:54,001 --> 02:04:54,630
That ain't it.

4792
02:04:54,630 --> 02:04:56,130
He needs a big name breakout fight.

4793
02:04:56,160 --> 02:04:58,660
Well that was a step towards
a breakout for agree.

4794
02:04:58,940 --> 02:05:01,260
I agree so many top ten's
the best wrong Carnero.

4795
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:01,771
You know,

4796
02:05:01,771 --> 02:05:03,960
at this point his striking
never looked better.

4797
02:05:03,961 --> 02:05:04,920
I mean there's footwork,

4798
02:05:05,450 --> 02:05:06,720
Derek Bronson's legit.

4799
02:05:07,020 --> 02:05:07,470
Oh yeah.

4800
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:10,110
He's for real bitch to be and
he's getting better and better

4801
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:16,820
and better and broke his neck and died
and that was $1 million baby in the

4802
02:05:17,090 --> 02:05:17,400
wound.

4803
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:18,540
Just had all these flashes.

4804
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:22,660
It's an asterix gypsy Paul
Williams fight a boxer.

4805
02:05:23,580 --> 02:05:24,413
Great fighter.

4806
02:05:24,690 --> 02:05:24,961
You know,

4807
02:05:24,961 --> 02:05:26,340
lost a crazy knockout.

4808
02:05:26,341 --> 02:05:27,240
The Sergio Martinez,

4809
02:05:27,241 --> 02:05:29,130
he got hit with that left
hand from hell right here.

4810
02:05:29,131 --> 02:05:31,130
You got to put feet on
the hips and push people.

4811
02:05:31,140 --> 02:05:32,820
Forget Paul Williams
before that fight was,

4812
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:33,780
he did that a little bit.

4813
02:05:33,780 --> 02:05:35,610
A little bit more is awesome,

4814
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:38,070
but it was the same is
huge motorcycle accident.

4815
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:39,360
You got hit by a car.

4816
02:05:40,140 --> 02:05:42,820
Some guy going through an intersection
or something like that and nailed it.

4817
02:05:42,821 --> 02:05:43,890
I mean that's some serious,

4818
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:44,661
he's paralyzed,

4819
02:05:44,661 --> 02:05:45,494
right?

4820
02:05:45,630 --> 02:05:45,841
Yeah.

4821
02:05:45,841 --> 02:05:46,770
Paralyzed from the waist down.

4822
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:49,140
He went flying through the air apparently.

4823
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:52,560
Damn powerful.

4824
02:05:52,561 --> 02:05:54,820
Derek Brown's for dawn.

4825
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:55,011
Dawn,

4826
02:05:55,011 --> 02:05:55,261
dawn,

4827
02:05:55,261 --> 02:05:55,980
Tom.

4828
02:05:55,980 --> 02:05:56,221
Oh,

4829
02:05:56,221 --> 02:05:57,510
we got cowboy next.

4830
02:05:57,540 --> 02:05:58,380
Very impressive.

4831
02:05:58,381 --> 02:05:59,850
We go like I would look.

4832
02:05:59,910 --> 02:06:01,230
If you think about Bella tour,

4833
02:06:01,231 --> 02:06:01,560
now,

4834
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:02,221
think about that.

4835
02:06:02,221 --> 02:06:03,180
You've got Benson over there.

4836
02:06:03,181 --> 02:06:07,500
He's fighting one 70 and Benson's got
a good fight against that Russian cat.

4837
02:06:08,070 --> 02:06:08,431
Dude.

4838
02:06:08,431 --> 02:06:09,570
Who's that rush and Katie's fight.

4839
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:10,830
I can't even entertain.

4840
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:15,560
I came in with a chain that spell it
toward talk after what I saw in the last

4841
02:06:15,570 --> 02:06:16,381
two fights,

4842
02:06:16,381 --> 02:06:17,190
man.

4843
02:06:17,190 --> 02:06:18,540
Oh Yoel Romero is fucked.

4844
02:06:18,570 --> 02:06:19,750
What's what's going on with that?

4845
02:06:19,751 --> 02:06:20,720
I know they're appealing.

4846
02:06:20,750 --> 02:06:21,600
Can Be doing steroids.

4847
02:06:21,601 --> 02:06:23,880
Can you still say potty and MMA?

4848
02:06:23,890 --> 02:06:27,150
Hundred Percent Oh my boy does now.

4849
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:28,231
No.

4850
02:06:28,231 --> 02:06:31,920
Yoel Romero Woodley has
a place for steroids.

4851
02:06:32,280 --> 02:06:33,450
There's no doubt about it,

4852
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:34,380
but it doesn't matter.

4853
02:06:35,130 --> 02:06:36,240
We're just talking about result.

4854
02:06:36,241 --> 02:06:37,690
We're not talking about like,

4855
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:43,560
you know he has something to say
this and this feels more facing.

4856
02:06:43,610 --> 02:06:44,580
Man is a very,

4857
02:06:44,581 --> 02:06:45,930
he's got a very good body,

4858
02:06:45,931 --> 02:06:48,150
but it cannot fuck with the freak show.

4859
02:06:48,480 --> 02:06:51,000
That's what shows free shit.

4860
02:06:51,170 --> 02:06:51,980
A legit.

4861
02:06:51,980 --> 02:06:53,700
Now think if Allen Joe ban half,

4862
02:06:53,701 --> 02:06:55,250
he's under investigation.

4863
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:56,250
Alan Jobe,

4864
02:06:56,250 --> 02:06:56,450
man,

4865
02:06:56,450 --> 02:06:56,630
take,

4866
02:06:56,630 --> 02:06:59,060
you're not born talking

4867
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:01,860
pound for pound bodies.

4868
02:07:02,760 --> 02:07:05,700
We're not talking about they got there.

4869
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:07,320
We're talking about like what?

4870
02:07:07,380 --> 02:07:08,790
What results were achieved?

4871
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:11,760
I'll have to go with Uber ream
then when he fought Brock Lesnar.

4872
02:07:11,761 --> 02:07:12,120
Yes.

4873
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:14,050
That's the best thing to come into this.

4874
02:07:14,080 --> 02:07:17,360
If you're talking about Yo
was 19 got on my face to

4875
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:21,793
face.

4876
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:27,630
You don't like white people.

4877
02:07:28,110 --> 02:07:31,110
I mean we're talking about best body's
tired of I'm tired of white people

4878
02:07:31,700 --> 02:07:32,060
breathing.

4879
02:07:32,060 --> 02:07:32,893
All are here.

4880
02:07:34,540 --> 02:07:36,040
Wide nose having,

4881
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:36,491
yeah,

4882
02:07:36,491 --> 02:07:39,940
but as far as like the guys that I've
seen step into the octagon where I was

4883
02:07:39,941 --> 02:07:40,151
like,

4884
02:07:40,151 --> 02:07:43,150
what in the fuck Yoel
Romero is the number one.

4885
02:07:43,151 --> 02:07:43,841
What in the fuck?

4886
02:07:43,841 --> 02:07:44,970
That's a skinny Woodley.

4887
02:07:44,971 --> 02:07:46,510
[inaudible] Woodley now though,

4888
02:07:46,690 --> 02:07:50,440
do Woodley Woodley has something to say
when we has that apple bottom out of the

4889
02:07:50,441 --> 02:07:51,274
bag too.

4890
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:52,273
We,

4891
02:07:52,450 --> 02:07:54,210
I can't really comment and I see,

4892
02:07:55,810 --> 02:07:57,550
here's where y'all having a marrow.

4893
02:07:57,580 --> 02:08:01,150
Here's where Yo Romero
disappears from the pack traps.

4894
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:03,730
His traps are literally
from another planet.

4895
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:05,230
They start at the top of his head.

4896
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:07,360
They go all the way down
the back of his neck.

4897
02:08:07,670 --> 02:08:08,980
The biggest fucking traps,

4898
02:08:08,981 --> 02:08:10,300
like when you see him,

4899
02:08:10,420 --> 02:08:13,060
he just looks like he could
throw you to the moon.

4900
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:16,490
Let's say just as far
as better the rounds,

4901
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:17,230
dude,

4902
02:08:17,230 --> 02:08:18,280
as far as best body,

4903
02:08:18,281 --> 02:08:18,911
let's say you're,

4904
02:08:18,911 --> 02:08:19,570
you're,

4905
02:08:19,570 --> 02:08:20,360
you have a product.

4906
02:08:20,360 --> 02:08:21,250
You want to hire a model.

4907
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:22,233
I'm not hiring,

4908
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:23,110
I'm not hiring him.

4909
02:08:23,110 --> 02:08:24,220
We're talking about fucking

4910
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:31,930
still picking Woodley or Joe
van cause their fake picture.

4911
02:08:31,961 --> 02:08:32,950
Jesus Christ,

4912
02:08:33,220 --> 02:08:34,350
he's fucking jacked.

4913
02:08:34,351 --> 02:08:35,620
She's Christ.

4914
02:08:36,130 --> 02:08:40,100
Look at it like the trap to shoulder
ratio show over him when he fought last.

4915
02:08:40,120 --> 02:08:41,110
He's on drugs.

4916
02:08:41,530 --> 02:08:41,951
No,

4917
02:08:41,951 --> 02:08:42,181
no,

4918
02:08:42,181 --> 02:08:42,970
no,

4919
02:08:42,970 --> 02:08:43,803
no peptides.

4920
02:08:44,170 --> 02:08:45,003
It's up for,

4921
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:50,080
he was a freak man dude over him when he
fought lesson though was a better body.

4922
02:08:50,140 --> 02:08:53,180
Well over him when he fought
lesson was also a hundred pounds.

4923
02:08:53,790 --> 02:08:56,650
We want to retire then just
remember what I just said.

4924
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:59,530
He's a hundred pounds
heavier when he weighed in,

4925
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:00,750
he gets six

4926
02:09:04,710 --> 02:09:07,510
phone out taking pictures of his ass,

4927
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:08,620
but he's a hundred pounds heavier.

4928
02:09:08,621 --> 02:09:12,130
That what pounds heavier you over Romero.

4929
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:16,870
When you were saying he gained only
really 80 but think about the difference

4930
02:09:16,871 --> 02:09:21,871
between a one 85 are in a to 65
gigantic to 65 world class striking.

4931
02:09:23,170 --> 02:09:24,280
I mean it's only 80 pounds.

4932
02:09:24,281 --> 02:09:26,950
I'm exaggerating by saying
100 but not by much.

4933
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:28,600
You wouldn't really be able
to tell the difference.

4934
02:09:28,601 --> 02:09:29,231
He was 20 pounds.

4935
02:09:29,231 --> 02:09:30,160
Come on son,

4936
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:33,490
when he fought Brock.

4937
02:09:35,050 --> 02:09:35,590
I bet.

4938
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:36,423
Oh my God.

4939
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:37,061
Yeah.

4940
02:09:37,061 --> 02:09:39,970
I bet that's as big as a man can get.

4941
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:41,740
And it's fun to be functional.

4942
02:09:41,741 --> 02:09:42,574
Yeah,

4943
02:09:43,690 --> 02:09:44,411
he was amazing.

4944
02:09:44,411 --> 02:09:46,070
You guys are given white guys love babies.

4945
02:09:46,420 --> 02:09:47,710
I think you guys are free.

4946
02:09:48,910 --> 02:09:49,391
There we go.

4947
02:09:49,391 --> 02:09:50,224
Yeah,

4948
02:09:50,500 --> 02:09:53,250
I'm just saying that had sex right there.

4949
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:55,150
Country,

4950
02:09:55,150 --> 02:09:55,983
big country,

4951
02:09:56,620 --> 02:10:01,000
last fight with Rochelle and that guy
has a lot of fucking Twitter followers.

4952
02:10:01,270 --> 02:10:02,490
A lot of Facebook live.

4953
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:03,631
People love him.

4954
02:10:03,631 --> 02:10:04,510
So just seems like it's,

4955
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,580
it's not capitalized on enough.

4956
02:10:07,020 --> 02:10:07,330
You know?

4957
02:10:07,330 --> 02:10:07,901
It's crazy.

4958
02:10:07,901 --> 02:10:08,340
I agree.

4959
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:09,400
Marika loves enough.

4960
02:10:09,460 --> 02:10:09,851
Yeah.

4961
02:10:09,851 --> 02:10:13,840
I mean it seems like someone
somehow should have taken advantage.

4962
02:10:13,841 --> 02:10:17,380
Some company should have a scooped him
up for commercials or stuff like that,

4963
02:10:17,381 --> 02:10:18,310
but reality show,

4964
02:10:18,700 --> 02:10:18,980
well,

4965
02:10:18,980 --> 02:10:20,110
just a commercial like,

4966
02:10:20,111 --> 02:10:20,270
uh,

4967
02:10:20,270 --> 02:10:23,350
gave him getting him a Gig for
something that says king or something.

4968
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:24,640
He was close to sign with Burger King.

4969
02:10:24,641 --> 02:10:25,360
I think.

4970
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:27,100
I haven't talked to Roy a while.

4971
02:10:27,101 --> 02:10:27,311
Right.

4972
02:10:27,311 --> 02:10:29,950
We did the ultimate fighter together
when we did our live fire and the kid in

4973
02:10:29,951 --> 02:10:30,784
Vegas out there,

4974
02:10:30,940 --> 02:10:33,500
I get a text like 10 minutes
before the show goes,

4975
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:34,581
love you brother.

4976
02:10:34,581 --> 02:10:35,630
You can do great tonight.

4977
02:10:35,631 --> 02:10:36,470
Can't wait to see it.

4978
02:10:36,590 --> 02:10:37,940
Like who the fuck is this?

4979
02:10:38,220 --> 02:10:38,561
Who is it?

4980
02:10:38,561 --> 02:10:39,650
See what it's Roy man,

4981
02:10:39,651 --> 02:10:40,281
I'm in the crowd.

4982
02:10:40,281 --> 02:10:40,551
I was like,

4983
02:10:40,551 --> 02:10:41,384
dude,

4984
02:10:41,530 --> 02:10:42,500
he's that dude.

4985
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:42,861
Yeah.

4986
02:10:42,861 --> 02:10:45,320
He's such a nice guy and
his wife is very cool too.

4987
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,213
Yeah.

4988
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:47,001
Yeah.

4989
02:10:47,001 --> 02:10:47,601
He's a,

4990
02:10:47,601 --> 02:10:51,800
he's one of those guys that I feel like
if he had someone who understood like

4991
02:10:51,801 --> 02:10:54,980
how to market him better
to sponsors and stuff,

4992
02:10:54,981 --> 02:10:57,980
like I could see that dude doing a ton
of commercial that his wife doing as

4993
02:10:57,981 --> 02:10:58,814
management.

4994
02:10:59,050 --> 02:10:59,540
Uh,

4995
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:04,370
well you need someone who knows how
to like sell you to like a motor oil

4996
02:11:04,371 --> 02:11:04,940
company.

4997
02:11:04,940 --> 02:11:06,170
I remember when you shout Ca.

4998
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:06,710
Yeah.

4999
02:11:06,710 --> 02:11:08,090
Remember when Chuck was doing those,

5000
02:11:08,100 --> 02:11:08,600
uh,

5001
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,170
what would they,

5002
02:11:09,170 --> 02:11:10,850
some Carter last door last,

5003
02:11:10,851 --> 02:11:12,380
what is the [inaudible] battery battery.

5004
02:11:12,680 --> 02:11:16,760
He remembered the battering wrecking ball
hits him in the face and all that kind

5005
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:17,240
of shit.

5006
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,440
Chuck was also world champion.

5007
02:11:18,441 --> 02:11:18,800
Yeah,

5008
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:19,240
true.

5009
02:11:19,240 --> 02:11:20,031
I find myself like,

5010
02:11:20,031 --> 02:11:22,010
like Roy could be in some humor

5011
02:11:24,630 --> 02:11:25,221
type stuff,

5012
02:11:25,221 --> 02:11:25,881
you know bass,

5013
02:11:25,881 --> 02:11:26,331
bass,

5014
02:11:26,331 --> 02:11:27,200
fishing equipment,

5015
02:11:27,201 --> 02:11:28,940
like the boats and shit and the swamps.

5016
02:11:29,030 --> 02:11:29,660
I'm with you.

5017
02:11:29,660 --> 02:11:30,140
What?

5018
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:30,381
No,

5019
02:11:30,381 --> 02:11:30,531
no,

5020
02:11:30,531 --> 02:11:30,980
no.

5021
02:11:30,980 --> 02:11:31,813
Come on now.

5022
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:36,110
If you want to sell money to
people in the bass fishing world,

5023
02:11:36,111 --> 02:11:38,000
you have to have a bass fishing star.

5024
02:11:38,360 --> 02:11:38,930
You would have to,

5025
02:11:38,930 --> 02:11:43,670
they have dogs that
this guys watch the UFC.

5026
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:43,881
Oh,

5027
02:11:43,881 --> 02:11:44,660
they definitely do.

5028
02:11:44,660 --> 02:11:49,490
But you know who they watch you to
fucking dance fishing show for real.

5029
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:50,181
Those those guys.

5030
02:11:50,181 --> 02:11:52,250
There's a whole world
with those people live in.

5031
02:11:52,430 --> 02:11:54,320
I watched it the other day for two hours.

5032
02:11:54,470 --> 02:11:59,470
I watched professional bass fishing on
TV because we'll still have plenty to do.

5033
02:11:59,901 --> 02:12:01,100
I'm watching psychology.

5034
02:12:01,150 --> 02:12:02,810
No wonder can you watch making a murderer?

5035
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,033
Yes.

5036
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:05,460
Oh No.

5037
02:12:05,470 --> 02:12:06,250
I started at [inaudible].

5038
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:07,100
How many have you seen?

5039
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:07,993
Just the first one.

5040
02:12:08,160 --> 02:12:09,010
Ooh.

5041
02:12:09,920 --> 02:12:10,560
And I was like,

5042
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:11,393
whoa.

5043
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:12,051
I get first.

5044
02:12:12,051 --> 02:12:12,411
I was like,

5045
02:12:12,411 --> 02:12:12,951
fuck this guy.

5046
02:12:12,951 --> 02:12:13,461
He's guilty.

5047
02:12:13,461 --> 02:12:15,590
He's guilty with this is
not the guy is a dirt bag.

5048
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:16,481
He's guilty.

5049
02:12:16,481 --> 02:12:17,550
His family doesn't want to admit it.

5050
02:12:17,580 --> 02:12:18,413
I see what's going on here.

5051
02:12:18,530 --> 02:12:20,030
And then you find out about
the other guy and you go,

5052
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:20,940
oh wait,

5053
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:21,150
didn't,

5054
02:12:21,150 --> 02:12:23,660
and you find out about how they knew
about the other guy and they ignore the

5055
02:12:23,661 --> 02:12:24,110
evidence.

5056
02:12:24,110 --> 02:12:25,460
I don't want to spoil dude.

5057
02:12:25,461 --> 02:12:26,120
It gets,

5058
02:12:26,120 --> 02:12:27,500
it gets 10 times crazier.

5059
02:12:27,530 --> 02:12:27,750
No,

5060
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:28,900
it's a eight.

5061
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:31,460
It lasted two episodes too long for me.

5062
02:12:32,750 --> 02:12:33,650
Is there nine?

5063
02:12:33,680 --> 02:12:33,951
Okay.

5064
02:12:33,951 --> 02:12:34,740
Spoiler alert.

5065
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:34,870
No,

5066
02:12:34,870 --> 02:12:35,061
no,

5067
02:12:35,061 --> 02:12:35,220
no,

5068
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:36,053
no.

5069
02:12:36,610 --> 02:12:37,443
Don't listen to him.

5070
02:12:37,730 --> 02:12:38,563
Don't listen to him.

5071
02:12:38,930 --> 02:12:40,640
Oh you mean the nice stop watching it?

5072
02:12:40,641 --> 02:12:41,121
The right part.

5073
02:12:41,121 --> 02:12:41,954
Cause I don't remember.

5074
02:12:42,350 --> 02:12:43,250
Nothing else happens.

5075
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:46,220
Are we talking about right
before that were performed?

5076
02:12:46,250 --> 02:12:47,660
How about narcan training?

5077
02:12:47,661 --> 02:12:49,160
Big Brennan big country is a,

5078
02:12:49,290 --> 02:12:50,240
as a superstar

5079
02:12:52,130 --> 02:12:55,700
bass fishing bass fishing people
that I've watched it for two hours.

5080
02:12:55,750 --> 02:12:58,880
I was asking what to do
and really psychotic.

5081
02:12:58,950 --> 02:13:00,350
They catch the fish,

5082
02:13:00,351 --> 02:13:02,690
they weigh them and they
have like a recording,

5083
02:13:02,691 --> 02:13:04,760
like a digital thing that
with their way I'm on.

5084
02:13:04,761 --> 02:13:07,130
So they know exactly how much they went
and they throw them back in the water

5085
02:13:07,730 --> 02:13:09,290
like they used to keep them in there.

5086
02:13:09,291 --> 02:13:11,750
I don't know if they still keep them then
maybe it was just what tournaments and

5087
02:13:11,751 --> 02:13:12,584
I was watching.

5088
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:13,990
They used to keep in what they call live.

5089
02:13:13,991 --> 02:13:14,510
Well,

5090
02:13:14,510 --> 02:13:15,321
so this tank,

5091
02:13:15,321 --> 02:13:16,940
this area to tank and the pool,

5092
02:13:17,130 --> 02:13:17,450
uh,

5093
02:13:17,450 --> 02:13:17,751
in the,

5094
02:13:17,751 --> 02:13:18,620
in the hall of the boat,

5095
02:13:18,740 --> 02:13:22,130
they throw the fish in there and
then they'd show him to everybody.

5096
02:13:22,170 --> 02:13:23,480
Then allegedly let 'em go.

5097
02:13:23,481 --> 02:13:25,250
But that fucking vision been tortured.

5098
02:13:25,320 --> 02:13:26,370
Yeah.

5099
02:13:26,450 --> 02:13:27,283
Hours.

5100
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:31,610
And they just keep kept in the
same as I can problem with,

5101
02:13:31,611 --> 02:13:35,220
with fish that have mouth problems
and fucking like fucked up.

5102
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:35,521
Yeah.

5103
02:13:35,521 --> 02:13:36,690
They get hooks and then they,

5104
02:13:36,930 --> 02:13:38,670
they get massive because we don't

5105
02:13:40,530 --> 02:13:41,041
exactly,

5106
02:13:41,041 --> 02:13:42,030
nobody gives a fuck.

5107
02:13:42,031 --> 02:13:42,640
No.

5108
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:44,580
Can you imagine you're
catching squirrels with hooks?

5109
02:13:44,840 --> 02:13:47,700
I was going to say no one
gives a fuck about bass.

5110
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:50,363
Bass

5111
02:13:52,490 --> 02:13:57,490
fishing contests through phones and
texting them up the hill and the parties

5112
02:13:58,131 --> 02:13:59,460
come and run over in the puppies.

5113
02:13:59,461 --> 02:14:00,230
Grabbed the hooks.

5114
02:14:00,230 --> 02:14:01,680
He try to eat the biggest puppy.

5115
02:14:01,710 --> 02:14:02,610
It makes me sad,

5116
02:14:03,770 --> 02:14:05,840
but it's a small basket.

5117
02:14:05,860 --> 02:14:07,350
You'd watch those guys catch a small bass.

5118
02:14:07,500 --> 02:14:09,240
That's like a year old bass,

5119
02:14:09,241 --> 02:14:10,110
a two year old bath.

5120
02:14:10,140 --> 02:14:12,980
Disney made a movie about a back pass.

5121
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:17,130
I don't know who gives a fuck about
these people standing for fish writes and

5122
02:14:17,131 --> 02:14:17,880
shit.

5123
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:18,421
It's just like,

5124
02:14:18,421 --> 02:14:18,691
okay,

5125
02:14:18,691 --> 02:14:19,950
you can pull the chairs were,

5126
02:14:21,150 --> 02:14:21,630
there's a,

5127
02:14:21,630 --> 02:14:22,390
there's a,

5128
02:14:22,390 --> 02:14:24,790
there was an organization
called the lobster liberation or

5129
02:14:26,530 --> 02:14:27,420
I'm not bullshitting.

5130
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:30,630
They'd break into restaurants and
seafood places and they would free the

5131
02:14:30,631 --> 02:14:33,210
lobsters and set them loose
back into the ocean again.

5132
02:14:33,510 --> 02:14:34,321
That's all I have.

5133
02:14:34,321 --> 02:14:35,700
Cockroaches in my garage.

5134
02:14:35,701 --> 02:14:36,534
If you want to get,

5135
02:14:36,650 --> 02:14:38,220
that's awesome.

5136
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:41,850
Take it back to Madagascar or
wherever the fuck they get delirious.

5137
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:43,373
Awesome.

5138
02:14:43,530 --> 02:14:44,430
How crazy is that?

5139
02:14:44,440 --> 02:14:45,450
Doubt or something like that.

5140
02:14:45,451 --> 02:14:46,950
You're getting arrested for a lobster.

5141
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:48,690
There's people that break goldfish.

5142
02:14:48,870 --> 02:14:49,290
Yeah,

5143
02:14:49,290 --> 02:14:50,430
but then you get out right away.

5144
02:14:51,940 --> 02:14:52,140
Well,

5145
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:52,740
they have,

5146
02:14:52,740 --> 02:14:53,580
that's a problem.

5147
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:58,170
But it's a problem with people take those
fish like goldfish and they released

5148
02:14:58,240 --> 02:14:59,100
[inaudible] lake.

5149
02:14:59,340 --> 02:14:59,491
Well,

5150
02:14:59,491 --> 02:15:00,181
all kinds of fish.

5151
02:15:00,181 --> 02:15:01,110
Cold fish alone.

5152
02:15:01,250 --> 02:15:03,420
He released him in the lake and
they're an invasive species.

5153
02:15:03,421 --> 02:15:04,950
They fucked with the whole ecosystem.

5154
02:15:05,250 --> 02:15:05,431
Uh,

5155
02:15:05,431 --> 02:15:06,390
Asian carp,

5156
02:15:06,600 --> 02:15:07,201
a lot of that.

5157
02:15:07,201 --> 02:15:11,490
There's a lot of different fish that
somehow or another through either people

5158
02:15:11,491 --> 02:15:12,900
releasing them like they had them.

5159
02:15:12,930 --> 02:15:13,950
They like snake heads.

5160
02:15:13,980 --> 02:15:15,450
Like people have let snakehead fish,

5161
02:15:15,630 --> 02:15:16,141
they'll take it,

5162
02:15:16,141 --> 02:15:19,530
they'll kill every fish in a fucking
lake to say that from snake heads and

5163
02:15:19,531 --> 02:15:22,550
they'll come after you
make it a bite trade.

5164
02:15:22,551 --> 02:15:23,730
It will climb on land and bites.

5165
02:15:23,740 --> 02:15:28,670
You can walk across the land naked for me.

5166
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:29,920
A snake had a snake.

5167
02:15:29,921 --> 02:15:30,120
It.

5168
02:15:30,120 --> 02:15:30,741
What are we talking about?

5169
02:15:30,741 --> 02:15:34,200
Africa and people will lose to keep
them as pets because they're cool.

5170
02:15:34,410 --> 02:15:36,840
And what they would do is
these fucking fish you,

5171
02:15:36,841 --> 02:15:40,500
they would get sick of them so they
would let them know their mom's sister

5172
02:15:40,510 --> 02:15:41,160
Jamie.

5173
02:15:41,160 --> 02:15:41,941
They're monsters.

5174
02:15:41,941 --> 02:15:42,840
They're dinosaurs.

5175
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:44,250
Walk on land.

5176
02:15:44,580 --> 02:15:45,413
Well you understand,

5177
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,920
but again,

5178
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:46,711
showing big too.

5179
02:15:46,711 --> 02:15:48,090
They get Jesus Christ.

5180
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:48,631
Wait,

5181
02:15:48,631 --> 02:15:48,960
wait,

5182
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:50,840
I'm going to affect your Barracuda Samey.

5183
02:15:51,150 --> 02:15:53,430
Pull up snake head in the Congo,

5184
02:15:53,431 --> 02:15:54,151
walks on,

5185
02:15:54,151 --> 02:15:55,440
land in the video,

5186
02:15:55,470 --> 02:15:55,861
hold up.

5187
02:15:55,861 --> 02:15:58,230
Those things walk on like one.

5188
02:15:58,230 --> 02:16:01,080
They walked from one pond to
another pond across the grounds.

5189
02:16:01,081 --> 02:16:01,914
Things are awesome.

5190
02:16:02,040 --> 02:16:03,990
Like they come out of
the water and they walk.

5191
02:16:04,170 --> 02:16:05,340
They're not very popular though,

5192
02:16:05,341 --> 02:16:05,720
Huh?

5193
02:16:05,720 --> 02:16:06,180
Oh,

5194
02:16:06,180 --> 02:16:07,080
they're monsters.

5195
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:09,180
This is a snake head.

5196
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,600
Uh,

5197
02:16:09,600 --> 02:16:10,560
in Thailand.

5198
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:10,891
Okay.

5199
02:16:10,891 --> 02:16:12,810
Here this is,

5200
02:16:13,170 --> 02:16:15,210
I dunno if this is a Bandanna on him.

5201
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:15,481
No,

5202
02:16:15,481 --> 02:16:16,320
this is not it.

5203
02:16:16,321 --> 02:16:16,860
Jamie.

5204
02:16:16,860 --> 02:16:17,281
This is,

5205
02:16:17,281 --> 02:16:17,820
um,

5206
02:16:17,820 --> 02:16:19,500
we want to see the one Congo,

5207
02:16:19,501 --> 02:16:20,334
cause this thing,

5208
02:16:20,940 --> 02:16:22,470
this is what he caught.

5209
02:16:22,500 --> 02:16:24,060
I don't think it's going
to show it walking.

5210
02:16:24,061 --> 02:16:26,010
Maybe snakehead fish walking.

5211
02:16:26,011 --> 02:16:27,030
Are they dangerous at all?

5212
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:28,320
I don't think so.

5213
02:16:28,410 --> 02:16:28,860
I mean not to.

5214
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:29,693
They're not dangerous.

5215
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:31,440
We mean they'll probably,

5216
02:16:32,540 --> 02:16:33,430
I need something to attack,

5217
02:16:33,431 --> 02:16:36,550
but the really big ones you
have to worry about the Congo.

5218
02:16:36,551 --> 02:16:38,490
Remember those spiders
that attacking swarms?

5219
02:16:38,550 --> 02:16:39,310
Yeah,

5220
02:16:39,310 --> 02:16:40,001
it's different.

5221
02:16:40,001 --> 02:16:41,590
They usually solitary in the states,

5222
02:16:41,591 --> 02:16:46,591
but in the Congo they
fucking swarmy spiders swarm.

5223
02:16:46,930 --> 02:16:48,820
They make these giant animals,

5224
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:49,301
not people.

5225
02:16:49,301 --> 02:16:49,880
They're not people.

5226
02:16:49,880 --> 02:16:50,130
Yeah,

5227
02:16:50,130 --> 02:16:51,910
they catch like squirrels and shit.

5228
02:16:51,940 --> 02:16:52,740
Spiders too.

5229
02:16:52,740 --> 02:16:53,573
It's nice.

5230
02:16:53,980 --> 02:16:56,290
I've seen the ones that are
big enough to catch birds,

5231
02:16:56,291 --> 02:16:56,580
but I don't,

5232
02:16:56,580 --> 02:16:56,950
I don't know.

5233
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:58,110
I love acute squirrel though.

5234
02:16:58,120 --> 02:17:00,590
But it's worse than fucking
spider swarming on Ya.

5235
02:17:00,760 --> 02:17:00,941
Yeah.

5236
02:17:00,941 --> 02:17:03,700
Jamie gets look at for it in
the Congo because this is not,

5237
02:17:03,740 --> 02:17:06,010
it's a BBC documentary and the Congo.

5238
02:17:06,250 --> 02:17:06,670
Maybe.

5239
02:17:06,670 --> 02:17:09,070
Maybe it's not exactly listed as naked.

5240
02:17:09,071 --> 02:17:10,390
Maybe I was saying the wrong name,

5241
02:17:10,630 --> 02:17:11,381
but I know snake.

5242
02:17:11,381 --> 02:17:12,520
It is a similar fish.

5243
02:17:12,700 --> 02:17:16,540
That's these vase of species from
other countries that just takes over.

5244
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:19,510
It sounds trying to one up each other.

5245
02:17:19,511 --> 02:17:20,920
Calculus walking on the land.

5246
02:17:20,921 --> 02:17:21,520
Look at this.

5247
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:21,980
Look at this thing.

5248
02:17:21,980 --> 02:17:22,813
Walking on the land.

5249
02:17:24,010 --> 02:17:25,840
They're walking until they find another,

5250
02:17:25,841 --> 02:17:26,674
another lake.

5251
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:27,431
Well,

5252
02:17:27,431 --> 02:17:28,960
unless they're eating people.

5253
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:29,800
Um,

5254
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:30,770
these are little ones.

5255
02:17:30,910 --> 02:17:31,701
Bite the fuck out of you.

5256
02:17:31,701 --> 02:17:32,380
I know that.

5257
02:17:32,380 --> 02:17:34,420
She shame to up on that
fucking it's crazy.

5258
02:17:34,430 --> 02:17:36,030
Now here's,

5259
02:17:36,130 --> 02:17:37,180
here's where you find it.

5260
02:17:37,370 --> 02:17:37,810
Um,

5261
02:17:37,810 --> 02:17:39,280
shoe bill shoe.

5262
02:17:39,281 --> 02:17:42,580
Bill bird eats snakehead
fish in the Congo.

5263
02:17:42,730 --> 02:17:45,310
Shoe Hill bird eats a prehistoric fish.

5264
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:47,320
Who's the craziest Shit
we get as a shoe heel?

5265
02:17:47,380 --> 02:17:48,160
Shoe Bill.

5266
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:50,790
Shoe bills five feet tall and has a,

5267
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:53,590
has a beak that's about
the size of my torso.

5268
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:55,330
Is Zhao a tactic?

5269
02:17:55,360 --> 02:17:56,470
Hatch it grown out of.

5270
02:17:56,471 --> 02:17:57,520
It's taped back though.

5271
02:17:57,820 --> 02:17:59,380
It looks evil as fuck.

5272
02:17:59,381 --> 02:18:00,250
That's a shoe bill.

5273
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:01,100
Look at that thing.

5274
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,670
It's smaller than the ones that
that do with Tera Byrd and shit.

5275
02:18:03,810 --> 02:18:04,061
Yeah.

5276
02:18:04,061 --> 02:18:06,130
Small on a terror birds
by like a couple of feet,

5277
02:18:06,131 --> 02:18:08,110
but there's still five feet fucking tall.

5278
02:18:08,260 --> 02:18:12,130
Like you don't get a sense of
perspective it looks like in this photo.

5279
02:18:12,680 --> 02:18:12,941
Yeah.

5280
02:18:12,941 --> 02:18:14,830
But if you were standing next to it,

5281
02:18:14,831 --> 02:18:16,060
you'd get a sense of perspective.

5282
02:18:16,090 --> 02:18:17,350
You would be terrified by the thing.

5283
02:18:17,351 --> 02:18:20,410
Cause imagine standing next to that thing
and you're only a foot taller than it.

5284
02:18:20,740 --> 02:18:25,030
You'd be shitting your pants I think is
monstrous is that's the thing we saw in

5285
02:18:25,031 --> 02:18:25,690
that Congo.

5286
02:18:25,690 --> 02:18:26,321
Exactly.

5287
02:18:26,321 --> 02:18:27,980
That's the same as the same document.

5288
02:18:28,070 --> 02:18:29,560
Ostriches are fucking huge,

5289
02:18:29,561 --> 02:18:29,850
right?

5290
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:30,190
Oh yeah.

5291
02:18:30,190 --> 02:18:33,160
But they don't have the creepy eyes of
these things have and they have small

5292
02:18:33,161 --> 02:18:33,994
faces.

5293
02:18:34,780 --> 02:18:35,613
They'll fuck you up though.

5294
02:18:35,830 --> 02:18:38,620
Don't they kick you or some shit they get,

5295
02:18:38,810 --> 02:18:42,340
the thing is that's a fat ass duck.

5296
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:44,710
Every one of my nightmares right there,

5297
02:18:44,711 --> 02:18:45,730
this giant bird,

5298
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:50,380
this thing walks through the swamp and
then it's going to Jack a shoe bill.

5299
02:18:50,560 --> 02:18:53,290
I mean a snake has ashes
that bridge my size.

5300
02:18:53,500 --> 02:18:53,711
Yeah,

5301
02:18:53,711 --> 02:18:54,371
it's a big ass.

5302
02:18:54,371 --> 02:18:55,091
But it's the size of me.

5303
02:18:55,091 --> 02:18:55,630
Am I?

5304
02:18:55,630 --> 02:18:58,220
I think they only UAE
like 50 or 60 pounds.

5305
02:18:58,260 --> 02:18:59,093
Get down with that,

5306
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:01,430
but that's a five foot bird,

5307
02:19:01,431 --> 02:19:01,960
man.

5308
02:19:01,960 --> 02:19:02,741
I'd fucking run.

5309
02:19:02,741 --> 02:19:03,700
Is it really five foot?

5310
02:19:03,720 --> 02:19:04,390
Yeah.

5311
02:19:04,390 --> 02:19:06,170
The other big ones they
can get five foot Syrian.

5312
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:07,063
Find another better.

5313
02:19:07,170 --> 02:19:07,570
See,

5314
02:19:07,570 --> 02:19:07,750
uh,

5315
02:19:07,750 --> 02:19:10,720
see if you find a shoe
build brand in the Congo.

5316
02:19:10,721 --> 02:19:11,230
That thing?

5317
02:19:11,230 --> 02:19:11,411
Yeah.

5318
02:19:11,411 --> 02:19:11,561
Look,

5319
02:19:11,561 --> 02:19:13,090
it's eating that fish hole.

5320
02:19:13,150 --> 02:19:15,310
It's a little dinosaur
dinosaur alpha main event.

5321
02:19:15,311 --> 02:19:18,910
Cowboy versus cowboy cowboy tog o down.

5322
02:19:19,360 --> 02:19:20,640
Cowboy cried.

5323
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:23,080
This cowboy looks really calm.

5324
02:19:23,150 --> 02:19:23,921
I kind of pissing,

5325
02:19:23,921 --> 02:19:26,950
can't they say super relaxed cause
the shitty went through in Brazil.

5326
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:27,680
Fine to him.

5327
02:19:27,680 --> 02:19:28,430
Just fun.

5328
02:19:28,430 --> 02:19:29,660
You don't get the same nerves.

5329
02:19:29,780 --> 02:19:30,613
Oh Wow.

5330
02:19:31,310 --> 02:19:31,750
What'd he go?

5331
02:19:31,750 --> 02:19:32,150
Chambers.

5332
02:19:32,150 --> 02:19:32,983
Not sure.

5333
02:19:33,070 --> 02:19:35,700
He grew up really poor on a farm boy.

5334
02:19:35,750 --> 02:19:36,670
Really powerful him.

5335
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:37,311
Yeah.

5336
02:19:37,311 --> 02:19:38,420
He looks for super relaxed.

5337
02:19:38,421 --> 02:19:38,720
The whole,

5338
02:19:38,720 --> 02:19:39,531
the whole montage.

5339
02:19:39,531 --> 02:19:41,810
Before this was just them
trying to out cowboy each other.

5340
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:42,920
Like who's more cowboy?

5341
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:43,890
Did you see it?

5342
02:19:43,890 --> 02:19:47,480
A student house showed cowboy on her
and showed him on a Brazilian ranch.

5343
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:48,230
That's funny.

5344
02:19:48,230 --> 02:19:48,401
Well,

5345
02:19:48,401 --> 02:19:49,390
it's a good move for the Turkey.

5346
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:50,780
The two best cowboys in the world.

5347
02:19:50,810 --> 02:19:52,340
American and Brazilian cowboy.

5348
02:19:52,460 --> 02:19:53,840
There's a lot of cowboys in Brazil.

5349
02:19:53,841 --> 02:19:54,740
I don't feel as that.

5350
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:55,820
I just shut up.

5351
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,110
I would like to see him.

5352
02:19:57,560 --> 02:19:59,750
I want to see a good
fight or get a real camp,

5353
02:19:59,990 --> 02:20:00,231
you know?

5354
02:20:00,231 --> 02:20:02,300
I don't like anybody
fighting on two weeks notice.

5355
02:20:02,330 --> 02:20:03,163
He's dangerous.

5356
02:20:03,490 --> 02:20:04,280
Serone though.

5357
02:20:04,280 --> 02:20:04,551
Yeah,

5358
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:05,600
he's super dangerous.

5359
02:20:05,730 --> 02:20:06,180
Oh,

5360
02:20:06,180 --> 02:20:06,400
here,

5361
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:06,800
look at this.

5362
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:07,633
Hugging people.

5363
02:20:07,670 --> 02:20:11,300
The guy that's going to come
on [inaudible] the fuck is
taking selfies before he

5364
02:20:11,301 --> 02:20:11,640
fights.

5365
02:20:11,640 --> 02:20:11,780
Yeah.

5366
02:20:11,780 --> 02:20:12,613
Happy as man.

5367
02:20:12,680 --> 02:20:13,513
Yeah.

5368
02:20:14,060 --> 02:20:14,680
Okay.

5369
02:20:14,680 --> 02:20:15,740
I'll tell you know he's going to do so.

5370
02:20:16,200 --> 02:20:17,870
And this is your pleasure.

5371
02:20:17,900 --> 02:20:18,733
Wow.

5372
02:20:19,340 --> 02:20:20,180
This can be fun.

5373
02:20:20,480 --> 02:20:21,050
Hell yeah.

5374
02:20:21,050 --> 02:20:22,660
I can't wait for the lax dancing.

5375
02:20:23,480 --> 02:20:24,180
No.

5376
02:20:24,180 --> 02:20:24,631
Damn.

5377
02:20:24,631 --> 02:20:27,090
He must take this as
his time looking at him.

5378
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:28,800
He looks so no pressure on him.

5379
02:20:28,801 --> 02:20:29,910
Look how relaxed he is.

5380
02:20:29,970 --> 02:20:30,803
Pumped those hip.

5381
02:20:30,990 --> 02:20:31,421
Yeah,

5382
02:20:31,421 --> 02:20:31,860

5383
02:20:31,860 --> 02:20:32,221
what is the,

5384
02:20:32,221 --> 02:20:33,054
what is the ass?

5385
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:35,273
No,

5386
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:35,821
what is that?

5387
02:20:35,821 --> 02:20:37,170
What they call the Buddha?

5388
02:20:37,530 --> 02:20:38,190
Buddha.

5389
02:20:38,190 --> 02:20:39,023
That's it.

5390
02:20:39,580 --> 02:20:42,900
What's the word for no
for but and Portuguese.

5391
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:43,680
Belinda.

5392
02:20:43,680 --> 02:20:46,740
Belinda Boone is at the dance where
they fucking put that all I know.

5393
02:20:46,741 --> 02:20:47,870
Is that right?

5394
02:20:48,070 --> 02:20:49,840
And Ha ha ha.

5395
02:20:51,240 --> 02:20:52,230
You've seen chicks do that,

5396
02:20:52,231 --> 02:20:52,880
right?

5397
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:53,321
I Guy,

5398
02:20:53,321 --> 02:20:54,160
I'll sit down and boy,

5399
02:20:54,170 --> 02:20:55,430

5400
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:56,910
yeah,

5401
02:20:56,910 --> 02:20:57,550
I quit.

5402
02:20:57,550 --> 02:20:58,383
No one seen that.

5403
02:20:58,410 --> 02:21:00,570
I'm not doing this then that
it's like enough for me.

5404
02:21:00,571 --> 02:21:02,190
It's like a Jeff Glover dock yard.

5405
02:21:02,330 --> 02:21:03,163
Yeah,

5406
02:21:03,470 --> 02:21:06,880
she jumps back card there.

5407
02:21:07,070 --> 02:21:07,903
Works ass.

5408
02:21:08,880 --> 02:21:09,750
Oh my God.

5409
02:21:09,751 --> 02:21:10,561
That'll break your nose,

5410
02:21:10,561 --> 02:21:10,950
son.

5411
02:21:10,950 --> 02:21:11,783
Look at this.

5412
02:21:11,880 --> 02:21:16,590
He's just an asshole and she's sham
and in his nose in her asshole.

5413
02:21:16,620 --> 02:21:18,210
What UFC fight was it when you,

5414
02:21:18,230 --> 02:21:18,750
uh,

5415
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:19,840
cloud donkey guard.

5416
02:21:19,841 --> 02:21:20,051
Bam.

5417
02:21:20,051 --> 02:21:20,311
Bam.

5418
02:21:20,311 --> 02:21:21,210
It was like years ago.

5419
02:21:21,480 --> 02:21:22,231
Eight years ago.

5420
02:21:22,231 --> 02:21:26,040
Remember that this position
is what we call donkey guard.

5421
02:21:26,370 --> 02:21:27,203
This,

5422
02:21:27,450 --> 02:21:29,850
this girl is hurting
his face with her ass.

5423
02:21:29,880 --> 02:21:30,713
That's not sexy.

5424
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:31,440
That's cool.

5425
02:21:31,440 --> 02:21:32,400
But when she was ramming,

5426
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:33,900
that goes into that asshole,

5427
02:21:33,901 --> 02:21:34,700
that ain't for me.

5428
02:21:34,700 --> 02:21:34,800
Yeah.

5429
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,780
How do you think this relationship ends?

5430
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:39,500
Do you think she feels like
connected to him after this bride?

5431
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:40,381
He 100.

5432
02:21:40,381 --> 02:21:40,840
Got It.

5433
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:41,940
Say got his dick sucked down.

5434
02:21:41,970 --> 02:21:43,740
Do you think he's got a chance
to fuck her because of this?

5435
02:21:43,900 --> 02:21:47,220
Or is there some Mexico or
somewhere where it's hot?

5436
02:21:47,250 --> 02:21:48,083
Brazil?

5437
02:21:50,480 --> 02:21:50,930
No,

5438
02:21:50,930 --> 02:21:51,763
AC.

5439
02:21:52,860 --> 02:21:53,880
There's something wrong with it.

5440
02:21:54,310 --> 02:21:55,080
I see.

5441
02:21:55,080 --> 02:21:55,231
Oh,

5442
02:21:55,231 --> 02:21:57,150
they're singing to this
a whole performance.

5443
02:21:57,180 --> 02:22:00,010
I guarantee that the song is
probably not your favorite.

5444
02:22:00,011 --> 02:22:00,090
Yeah.

5445
02:22:00,090 --> 02:22:02,260
Old Man's about to blow
his fucking neck down.

5446
02:22:02,750 --> 02:22:03,810
They're going to fucking,

5447
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:04,850
oh shit.

5448
02:22:04,950 --> 02:22:05,970
See how she spins?

5449
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:08,460
Oh Shit.

5450
02:22:08,550 --> 02:22:08,940
God.

5451
02:22:08,940 --> 02:22:10,080
I have a problem with that.

5452
02:22:10,190 --> 02:22:10,320
Oh,

5453
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:11,290
that's what I have a problem with.

5454
02:22:11,310 --> 02:22:11,940
Not For me,

5455
02:22:11,940 --> 02:22:16,410
but how would they stop the dance?

5456
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:20,980
I'm paying the drama
religious outfit like Eric,

5457
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:24,780
he's a clarifier is doing the checkout
there in Brazil now it looks more like

5458
02:22:25,740 --> 02:22:26,370
Pakistan

5459
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:27,203
or something.

5460
02:22:27,390 --> 02:22:27,541
No,

5461
02:22:27,541 --> 02:22:27,621
no,

5462
02:22:27,621 --> 02:22:27,820
no.

5463
02:22:27,820 --> 02:22:29,600
This might be to buy.

5464
02:22:31,420 --> 02:22:32,570
This would definitely happy.

5465
02:22:32,800 --> 02:22:33,633
Definitely not happening.

5466
02:22:33,670 --> 02:22:34,503
Fucking Africa.

5467
02:22:34,710 --> 02:22:37,140
Oh look at him.

5468
02:22:37,470 --> 02:22:38,230
He screams.

5469
02:22:38,230 --> 02:22:41,940
What's up with the guys that like getting
kneed in the balls by checks ended.

5470
02:22:41,970 --> 02:22:42,560
They paid for,

5471
02:22:42,560 --> 02:22:43,111
they paid for that.

5472
02:22:43,111 --> 02:22:43,860
Have you ever watched it?

5473
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:46,080
She sent me a funny graphic of that.

5474
02:22:46,081 --> 02:22:46,740
The other horrible,

5475
02:22:46,740 --> 02:22:49,200
I just got sent a die in
a group message about,

5476
02:22:49,270 --> 02:22:51,070
it's all smashed point.

5477
02:22:51,170 --> 02:22:51,901
It's point of view.

5478
02:22:51,901 --> 02:22:55,410
So it's a guy sitting there and he's
videotaping his legs open and he has two

5479
02:22:55,411 --> 02:22:55,681
major,

5480
02:22:55,681 --> 02:22:58,140
it's in little outfits run up and
started kicking him and stomping on him.

5481
02:22:59,000 --> 02:22:59,310
Eddie,

5482
02:22:59,310 --> 02:23:00,720
that thing you sent me today,

5483
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:03,480
the ultimate sack fighting thing.

5484
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:04,650
That's so crazy.

5485
02:23:05,130 --> 02:23:07,040
They did exactly what he did it twice,

5486
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:11,190
twice college humor that two of
our schedules are Matt Mantra.

5487
02:23:11,191 --> 02:23:14,730
There must be a writer for car
that worked for the man show.

5488
02:23:14,731 --> 02:23:18,360
There has to be because they did
extreme sack planning when they heard us

5489
02:23:18,361 --> 02:23:20,940
talking about it and the
Jesus a cross trainer.

5490
02:23:22,950 --> 02:23:23,221
Okay.

5491
02:23:23,221 --> 02:23:25,740
But it is possible that someone
came up with it on their own.

5492
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:26,880
It is totally possible.

5493
02:23:26,881 --> 02:23:28,320
You guys talked about
on and talked about it.

5494
02:23:28,321 --> 02:23:29,550
I've talked about on my podcast

5495
02:23:31,250 --> 02:23:31,470
when,

5496
02:23:31,470 --> 02:23:32,303
how long ago?

5497
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:34,720
Like a couple of fighting,

5498
02:23:34,730 --> 02:23:36,960
you know we talked about
I think on mine too,

5499
02:23:36,961 --> 02:23:37,920
like way back in the day.

5500
02:23:37,921 --> 02:23:41,100
I think we're talking about different
sketches that we did that where we did,

5501
02:23:41,101 --> 02:23:44,520
cause we had to have Bobby Lee and
Joey Diaz and Joey Diaz kept losing.

5502
02:23:44,521 --> 02:23:45,540
His balls are too big.

5503
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:45,681
Yeah.

5504
02:23:45,681 --> 02:23:46,630
So he became a trainer,

5505
02:23:46,631 --> 02:23:49,500
Bobby Lee one we were going to give
him some fig balls are like that big.

5506
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:53,190
Bobby Lou was the master and
it would go and visit him.

5507
02:23:53,340 --> 02:23:53,790
He was like,

5508
02:23:53,790 --> 02:23:56,550
he's on an island somewhere and
teach you how to sacrifice correctly.

5509
02:23:56,580 --> 02:23:57,020
It's funny,

5510
02:23:57,020 --> 02:23:58,200
you just couldn't touch his nuts.

5511
02:23:58,220 --> 02:23:59,750
There were so small future of MMA.

5512
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:00,540
Eventually,

5513
02:24:00,540 --> 02:24:04,110
eventually state by state are going to
legalize ball hitting when the balls are

5514
02:24:04,111 --> 02:24:06,000
in play came changes.

5515
02:24:06,540 --> 02:24:07,620
We had a whole fucking

5516
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:10,590
made it.

5517
02:24:10,590 --> 02:24:12,420
I don't know if the be I,

5518
02:24:12,421 --> 02:24:15,780
am I giving them the benefit of the doubt.

5519
02:24:15,870 --> 02:24:16,920
That's what I do from now on.

5520
02:24:17,490 --> 02:24:18,180
I don't know man.

5521
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:20,410
We know when people are bullshit
artist and rip off artists,

5522
02:24:20,430 --> 02:24:20,930
but it just,

5523
02:24:20,930 --> 02:24:22,530
it always comes to surface.

5524
02:24:23,340 --> 02:24:24,660
You know that thing,

5525
02:24:24,670 --> 02:24:25,740
the Internet,

5526
02:24:26,100 --> 02:24:26,670
it's kind of a,

5527
02:24:26,670 --> 02:24:27,503
it's going to get,

5528
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:29,010
you know these guys,

5529
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:33,180
it could've easily been that they came
up with on their own or it could have

5530
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:33,691
been like,

5531
02:24:33,691 --> 02:24:34,710
these guys had great ideas.

5532
02:24:34,711 --> 02:24:35,521
They didn't even do it,

5533
02:24:35,521 --> 02:24:37,860
so fuck them and there
may have been a podcast.

5534
02:24:37,890 --> 02:24:41,340
There may have been a podcast where I
went through all our sketches that got,

5535
02:24:41,410 --> 02:24:41,960
uh,

5536
02:24:41,960 --> 02:24:42,570
uh,

5537
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:43,403
turned down

5538
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:46,890
and I talked about them.

5539
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,110
And I think once or twice I may have said,

5540
02:24:49,320 --> 02:24:49,651
you know what,

5541
02:24:49,651 --> 02:24:51,390
if someone out there wants to run with it,

5542
02:24:51,391 --> 02:24:52,560
run with it and you fuck up

5543
02:24:54,270 --> 02:24:54,661
nobody,

5544
02:24:54,661 --> 02:24:55,680
you're not feeling well.

5545
02:24:55,681 --> 02:24:57,650
You would never get away
with it any way so far.

5546
02:24:57,651 --> 02:24:58,570
It'd be hard to prove.

5547
02:25:00,520 --> 02:25:01,410
That was never even a thought.

5548
02:25:01,411 --> 02:25:03,630
I'm just saying that that was our shit.

5549
02:25:03,690 --> 02:25:03,871
Yeah,

5550
02:25:03,871 --> 02:25:04,704
because if you,

5551
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:05,543
12 years ago,

5552
02:25:05,550 --> 02:25:07,620
if you come up with an idea but
you don't do anything about,

5553
02:25:07,621 --> 02:25:10,020
and you talk about the idea and then
someone else does something with it,

5554
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:13,350
that's so much different than you
having already done the sketch and then

5555
02:25:13,351 --> 02:25:14,550
someone ripping off the sketch.

5556
02:25:14,590 --> 02:25:15,330
True.

5557
02:25:15,330 --> 02:25:17,130
Completely beam wild.

5558
02:25:17,131 --> 02:25:18,360
This shit's about to go down.

5559
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:19,560
I'm excited for this fight.

5560
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:20,873
Cowboys.

5561
02:25:21,060 --> 02:25:21,480
I'm uh,

5562
02:25:21,480 --> 02:25:22,440
I'm excited to see,

5563
02:25:22,441 --> 02:25:24,100
how do you think going to fight at one

5564
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:24,933
70?

5565
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:25,630
Good man.

5566
02:25:25,630 --> 02:25:26,463
No weight cut.

5567
02:25:26,620 --> 02:25:28,210
I think it's gas can be better.

5568
02:25:29,350 --> 02:25:30,280
He's a motherfucker.

5569
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:31,870
It's just how to,

5570
02:25:31,870 --> 02:25:36,190
how does Donald feel after that loss is
the x factor after getting dismantled by

5571
02:25:36,191 --> 02:25:37,710
dos Anjos could point.

5572
02:25:37,720 --> 02:25:38,320
How's he?

5573
02:25:38,320 --> 02:25:40,450
How's he gonna respond and
he's fighting a bigger person.

5574
02:25:40,451 --> 02:25:40,601
When?

5575
02:25:40,601 --> 02:25:44,560
When is someone usually taller than
him and ed is 55 never at 55 this guy's

5576
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:45,100
taller.

5577
02:25:45,100 --> 02:25:46,060
Has a longer reach.

5578
02:25:46,061 --> 02:25:46,770
Loves to stand.

5579
02:25:46,770 --> 02:25:47,540
It looks good though.

5580
02:25:47,540 --> 02:25:48,373
[inaudible] hands.

5581
02:25:48,530 --> 02:25:49,060
It's all looks.

5582
02:25:49,060 --> 02:25:49,990
He looks way better.

5583
02:25:50,080 --> 02:25:50,291
Yeah.

5584
02:25:50,291 --> 02:25:51,480
It looks thick to hit.

5585
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:53,140
Donald's a huge 55 are men.

5586
02:25:53,320 --> 02:25:55,590
Why think he's had issues in the past too?

5587
02:25:55,740 --> 02:25:56,501
This is the first time.

5588
02:25:56,501 --> 02:25:58,000
Is that crazy shredded?

5589
02:25:58,600 --> 02:25:59,411
It looks good to me,

5590
02:25:59,411 --> 02:25:59,681
man.

5591
02:25:59,681 --> 02:26:00,820
He looks really good to me.

5592
02:26:00,850 --> 02:26:01,181
I mean,

5593
02:26:01,181 --> 02:26:02,410
it's not crazy shredded.

5594
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:03,460
It's healthy.

5595
02:26:03,490 --> 02:26:03,940
Shredded.

5596
02:26:03,940 --> 02:26:04,241
Yeah.

5597
02:26:04,241 --> 02:26:04,900
It's different.

5598
02:26:04,900 --> 02:26:06,880
It's like there's a level
of shredded where you go,

5599
02:26:06,881 --> 02:26:07,091
man,

5600
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:08,650
this guy might be a little bit too lean.

5601
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:09,311
LNG bond.

5602
02:26:09,311 --> 02:26:11,020
Good or not all the time.

5603
02:26:11,021 --> 02:26:11,854
Different League.

5604
02:26:12,150 --> 02:26:12,983
How did your mom,

5605
02:26:13,150 --> 02:26:13,860
how would you rate him?

5606
02:26:13,860 --> 02:26:14,140
No.

5607
02:26:14,140 --> 02:26:16,100
Alan Dumont another to another level.

5608
02:26:18,680 --> 02:26:21,190
We got.off five thousands on one hand.

5609
02:26:21,340 --> 02:26:21,730
No.

5610
02:26:21,730 --> 02:26:26,470
Bocky Bono occupied it all on
one hand and then prime cowboy,

5611
02:26:26,770 --> 02:26:28,090
like who's the leanness guy ever?

5612
02:26:28,091 --> 02:26:28,930
The fought in MMA,

5613
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:30,190
the leanest guy ever.

5614
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:31,390
What do you mean the most?

5615
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:32,223
Running

5616
02:26:33,440 --> 02:26:34,590
a Gleason.

5617
02:26:34,591 --> 02:26:35,350
See Bow.

5618
02:26:35,350 --> 02:26:35,591
Yeah,

5619
02:26:35,591 --> 02:26:36,340
probably.

5620
02:26:36,340 --> 02:26:36,960
No,

5621
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:37,541
he's come on.

5622
02:26:37,541 --> 02:26:37,811
He was,

5623
02:26:37,811 --> 02:26:42,811
we'd walk around a one 95 and
fight a 55 Anthony Anthony Johnson.

5624
02:26:43,810 --> 02:26:44,051
Yeah,

5625
02:26:44,051 --> 02:26:44,680
you got a point.

5626
02:26:44,680 --> 02:26:45,221
You got to a point.

5627
02:26:45,221 --> 02:26:46,054
That might be it.

5628
02:26:46,570 --> 02:26:47,410
But here we go.

5629
02:26:47,411 --> 02:26:47,980
Look at this.

5630
02:26:47,980 --> 02:26:48,813
Oh,

5631
02:26:48,820 --> 02:26:49,653
looking for the writing.

5632
02:26:50,600 --> 02:26:51,750
What you got to do to beat cal,

5633
02:26:51,751 --> 02:26:53,080
but you got to really turn it on early.

5634
02:26:53,081 --> 02:26:53,914
Man,

5635
02:26:55,160 --> 02:26:56,680
can we takes a while to warm up.

5636
02:26:56,790 --> 02:27:00,590
Cowboy is a guide that
recovers very well from a loss,

5637
02:27:00,830 --> 02:27:01,760
but already we're seeing,

5638
02:27:02,030 --> 02:27:04,880
we're already seeing a big
difference in physical strengths.

5639
02:27:06,610 --> 02:27:07,443
He's on on him.

5640
02:27:07,540 --> 02:27:08,810
I see him that early.

5641
02:27:08,960 --> 02:27:09,771
That's not a fluke.

5642
02:27:09,771 --> 02:27:12,240
There's something to say about that man.

5643
02:27:12,470 --> 02:27:13,100
Big Ones.

5644
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:13,390
Messi.

5645
02:27:13,390 --> 02:27:14,300
Gas is out.

5646
02:27:14,540 --> 02:27:15,860
We're going to see a lot of this.

5647
02:27:17,100 --> 02:27:17,541
It just,

5648
02:27:17,541 --> 02:27:19,250
he puts him against the
fence pretty easily.

5649
02:27:19,970 --> 02:27:20,700
I mean Donald's,

5650
02:27:20,700 --> 02:27:21,121
I'm you.

5651
02:27:21,121 --> 02:27:21,561
So you,

5652
02:27:21,561 --> 02:27:22,460
so you see in Donald,

5653
02:27:22,461 --> 02:27:23,121
just a bigger,

5654
02:27:23,121 --> 02:27:23,841
taller dude.

5655
02:27:23,841 --> 02:27:24,200
I'm never,

5656
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:25,011
this is interesting,

5657
02:27:25,011 --> 02:27:25,640
man.

5658
02:27:25,640 --> 02:27:25,970
Oh,

5659
02:27:25,970 --> 02:27:26,560
that's a hard one.

5660
02:27:26,560 --> 02:27:26,691
Why?

5661
02:27:26,691 --> 02:27:27,680
There's been classes,

5662
02:27:27,730 --> 02:27:27,891
you know,

5663
02:27:27,891 --> 02:27:29,180
these are hard knees to the body,

5664
02:27:29,181 --> 02:27:29,391
man.

5665
02:27:29,391 --> 02:27:30,340
You can't take too many of these.

5666
02:27:30,370 --> 02:27:30,920
Oh,

5667
02:27:30,920 --> 02:27:31,850
that looked like it hurt him.

5668
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:34,370
That looked like a always Gracie.

5669
02:27:34,371 --> 02:27:35,204
Nene

5670
02:27:38,260 --> 02:27:39,860
gone from now on.

5671
02:27:40,050 --> 02:27:41,020
It's Gracie needs.

5672
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:41,631
Oh Shit.

5673
02:27:41,631 --> 02:27:42,530
Another need of the body.

5674
02:27:43,010 --> 02:27:44,140
Oh Duh.

5675
02:27:44,690 --> 02:27:46,130
If Donald gets them going backwards,

5676
02:27:46,131 --> 02:27:47,900
homeboys fucked with Brazilian cowboys.

5677
02:27:48,140 --> 02:27:49,030
Football.

5678
02:27:50,110 --> 02:27:50,610
Telegraph.

5679
02:27:50,610 --> 02:27:51,230
When this,

5680
02:27:51,230 --> 02:27:52,063
come on.

5681
02:27:52,120 --> 02:27:53,990
Where's his hips are like Bruce Lee.

5682
02:27:58,200 --> 02:27:59,033
Okay.

5683
02:27:59,830 --> 02:28:01,100
Tony's haircuts.

5684
02:28:01,110 --> 02:28:01,943
Interesting.

5685
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:02,940
Ooh.

5686
02:28:02,940 --> 02:28:04,050
Ooh God.

5687
02:28:04,051 --> 02:28:04,884
He is winging them.

5688
02:28:06,410 --> 02:28:08,700
Your Dad's got to drag this
guy and some deeper water.

5689
02:28:08,701 --> 02:28:09,534
Huh?

5690
02:28:10,660 --> 02:28:11,850
Ooh Dude.

5691
02:28:11,990 --> 02:28:13,320
He's just way bigger.

5692
02:28:14,670 --> 02:28:16,640
Donald's in shaping this
tits face that hurt.

5693
02:28:16,710 --> 02:28:17,730
He's fading a little bit.

5694
02:28:17,731 --> 02:28:19,170
Took a big deep breath right there.

5695
02:28:19,200 --> 02:28:19,381
Yeah,

5696
02:28:19,381 --> 02:28:20,340
he's fading a little dude.

5697
02:28:20,341 --> 02:28:21,680
If I'm Brazilian them

5698
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:23,090
just do it bro.

5699
02:28:23,340 --> 02:28:23,590
Well,

5700
02:28:23,590 --> 02:28:25,160
you only got two rounds Max.

5701
02:28:25,161 --> 02:28:25,341
Yeah,

5702
02:28:25,341 --> 02:28:28,940
but what if he goes after him hearing
gasses himself out with a minute left?

5703
02:28:29,150 --> 02:28:30,440
He might not be able to make it.

5704
02:28:30,680 --> 02:28:30,840
Well,

5705
02:28:30,840 --> 02:28:31,880
you're going to get your ass whooped.

5706
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:33,110
Do we really have no way.

5707
02:28:33,140 --> 02:28:33,801
Oh,

5708
02:28:33,801 --> 02:28:35,510
we really have no idea
what kind of conditioning.

5709
02:28:35,511 --> 02:28:35,810
Yes.

5710
02:28:35,810 --> 02:28:36,080
Right.

5711
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:36,913
Oh,

5712
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:41,970
they go cowboys.

5713
02:28:41,980 --> 02:28:43,400
Jiu Jitsu is very underrated,

5714
02:28:43,401 --> 02:28:44,234
man.

5715
02:28:44,300 --> 02:28:46,040
Mother fight there could be over right.

5716
02:28:46,041 --> 02:28:47,760
It could be over just right with that.

5717
02:28:47,800 --> 02:28:48,290
With that.

5718
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:49,123
It can be homer.

5719
02:28:49,160 --> 02:28:49,993
Just don't,

5720
02:28:50,150 --> 02:28:53,840
don't remove your head from
the ground and inch by inch.

5721
02:28:53,841 --> 02:28:54,560
Set that up.

5722
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:59,480
It's so hard to find out when a guy
is coming in on two weeks notice.

5723
02:28:59,481 --> 02:29:02,330
So hard to find out what he'd been
doing before we got there and call

5724
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:07,810
Oh good control by cal hood mount.

5725
02:29:07,830 --> 02:29:08,663
Look at Oh

5726
02:29:17,910 --> 02:29:18,743
fuck.

5727
02:29:19,240 --> 02:29:21,910
Holy Triangle to fuck you.

5728
02:29:22,230 --> 02:29:24,080
Try go them enrolled them over.

5729
02:29:24,110 --> 02:29:26,210
That was some serious Jujitsu man.

5730
02:29:26,211 --> 02:29:28,220
I'm telling you is just
is underrated dude.

5731
02:29:28,310 --> 02:29:29,720
That was some shit.

5732
02:29:29,990 --> 02:29:30,651
That being said,

5733
02:29:30,651 --> 02:29:32,810
I don't like copy at one
70 after seeing that.

5734
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:33,790
What are you talking about?

5735
02:29:33,790 --> 02:29:34,623
Don't know.

5736
02:29:34,660 --> 02:29:35,210
I don't.

5737
02:29:35,210 --> 02:29:35,910
Why not?

5738
02:29:35,910 --> 02:29:37,430
Because I think he got out muscled.

5739
02:29:37,431 --> 02:29:38,010
I think uh,

5740
02:29:38,010 --> 02:29:40,220
if he fought the topper echelon guys,

5741
02:29:40,221 --> 02:29:40,941
he gets stronger.

5742
02:29:40,941 --> 02:29:41,810
He can get stronger.

5743
02:29:42,530 --> 02:29:42,771
Yeah.

5744
02:29:42,771 --> 02:29:43,604
Man,

5745
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:44,540
I think he won.

5746
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:45,583
This is,

5747
02:29:46,040 --> 02:29:46,873
he did for sure,

5748
02:29:47,270 --> 02:29:47,751
but he would.

5749
02:29:47,751 --> 02:29:48,081
He did.

5750
02:29:48,081 --> 02:29:48,411
You're right.

5751
02:29:48,411 --> 02:29:49,430
He did get thrown around,

5752
02:29:49,431 --> 02:29:50,540
but I think he could fix that.

5753
02:29:50,570 --> 02:29:53,120
Brendan is a glass is
half empty sort of Fella

5754
02:29:54,970 --> 02:29:57,500
wins a beautiful fucking triangle victory.

5755
02:29:57,501 --> 02:29:59,420
I don't like him at one
seven now he's my boy.

5756
02:30:00,320 --> 02:30:01,310
He can't take them down.

5757
02:30:01,350 --> 02:30:02,183
He's not strong enough.

5758
02:30:02,990 --> 02:30:03,760
Strong shoes.

5759
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:04,720
Shit so strong.

5760
02:30:04,721 --> 02:30:05,241
She was it.

5761
02:30:05,241 --> 02:30:06,560
So look at this uh,

5762
02:30:06,620 --> 02:30:07,550
recovery here too.

5763
02:30:07,550 --> 02:30:11,050
I like this man cause Alex [inaudible],

5764
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:16,120
he steps right over into the
triangle that is fucking beautiful.

5765
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:20,570
Instead of [inaudible] so
quick and [inaudible] happened,

5766
02:30:20,571 --> 02:30:23,930
that must be all clamping
lockdown of a triangle.

5767
02:30:23,931 --> 02:30:27,080
Like look at this super nasty look
how it gets it over the ankle.

5768
02:30:27,081 --> 02:30:30,890
Nice looking at that quick
and he held it and he's like,

5769
02:30:32,180 --> 02:30:33,013
come on son.

5770
02:30:33,040 --> 02:30:34,370
Stopped that Mario.

5771
02:30:34,850 --> 02:30:35,730
Who's that Mario?

5772
02:30:35,870 --> 02:30:36,820
I didn't know who it was.

5773
02:30:36,830 --> 02:30:38,600
That was a quick triangle.

5774
02:30:38,690 --> 02:30:39,523
There was no,

5775
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:40,880
there was no fight.

5776
02:30:41,180 --> 02:30:42,140
There was no struggle.

5777
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:44,120
There was a lot of good it did.

5778
02:30:44,330 --> 02:30:44,780
Yeah,

5779
02:30:44,780 --> 02:30:46,130
there's things he'd get a win too.

5780
02:30:46,520 --> 02:30:47,530
He just tapped it.

5781
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:48,350
That's beautiful.

5782
02:30:48,350 --> 02:30:49,610
Cowboy such a star,

5783
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:50,181
you know,

5784
02:30:50,181 --> 02:30:51,440
people love that dude.

5785
02:30:51,441 --> 02:30:51,980
He needed to.

5786
02:30:51,980 --> 02:30:52,813
When his happened,

5787
02:30:53,610 --> 02:30:54,620
he did a real nice guy.

5788
02:30:54,770 --> 02:30:57,290
I would just like to have seen
Oliveira with a real camp.

5789
02:30:57,320 --> 02:30:58,760
It's like when you see
a real talented guy,

5790
02:30:59,050 --> 02:30:59,721
guy like that,

5791
02:30:59,721 --> 02:31:02,690
it's nice to come in and step in on
two weeks notice and no loss for him.

5792
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:08,920
I would like to see him in a camp who
Tyron Woodley suit Woodley on on this

5793
02:31:09,111 --> 02:31:09,560
show.

5794
02:31:09,560 --> 02:31:10,850
I've never watched them as the analyst.

5795
02:31:10,851 --> 02:31:11,870
He's a beast man.

5796
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:12,621
He's very,

5797
02:31:12,621 --> 02:31:13,454
very good.

5798
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:14,960
They won't let you on that show anymore.

5799
02:31:14,961 --> 02:31:15,441
Is that what I hear?

5800
02:31:15,441 --> 02:31:16,274
I don't think so.

5801
02:31:16,880 --> 02:31:18,500
They never asked me,

5802
02:31:18,501 --> 02:31:19,950
so talk a little too much shit.

5803
02:31:19,951 --> 02:31:20,784
Joe.

5804
02:31:21,150 --> 02:31:22,140
Would you want to do it again?

5805
02:31:22,680 --> 02:31:23,281
Fuck yeah.

5806
02:31:23,281 --> 02:31:24,114
You'd be great at that Shit.

5807
02:31:24,170 --> 02:31:24,780
I can't.

5808
02:31:24,780 --> 02:31:26,850
I can't fight for very much
longer with all the shit I think.

5809
02:31:26,851 --> 02:31:27,271
I don't know.

5810
02:31:27,271 --> 02:31:27,481
We'll see.

5811
02:31:27,481 --> 02:31:28,314
I'm going to keep trying

5812
02:31:29,930 --> 02:31:30,840
and that braindead yet,

5813
02:31:30,900 --> 02:31:31,920
but my body sucks.

5814
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:32,401
Yeah,

5815
02:31:32,401 --> 02:31:33,540
but you're a good analyst.

5816
02:31:33,541 --> 02:31:36,050
You're very good at breaking
down fights to Smartsheet.

5817
02:31:36,300 --> 02:31:38,100
I would love to do it somewhere.

5818
02:31:38,320 --> 02:31:40,350
I've seen him fucking sneaky in there.

5819
02:31:40,530 --> 02:31:41,900
I think I have a creepy with it.

5820
02:31:41,980 --> 02:31:42,813
And they said no.

5821
02:31:43,230 --> 02:31:44,130
I'm pretty sure.

5822
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:44,580
I don't know.

5823
02:31:44,580 --> 02:31:45,300
It's tough.

5824
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:46,500
It's a tough rotation,

5825
02:31:46,501 --> 02:31:46,711
Joe,

5826
02:31:46,711 --> 02:31:47,544
to get in there

5827
02:31:49,170 --> 02:31:51,960
trying to get in because they should have
more than one of those fucking things.

5828
02:31:52,230 --> 02:31:53,063
The only have one.

5829
02:31:53,070 --> 02:31:56,700
What do you mean gang of these UFC
shows with a bunch of different people

5830
02:31:56,701 --> 02:31:57,240
running them.

5831
02:31:57,240 --> 02:31:58,260
Just like podcasts.

5832
02:31:58,261 --> 02:31:59,790
Let people figure out what they like.

5833
02:32:00,170 --> 02:32:01,950
You can have a hundred
of those fucking things.

5834
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:02,431
Well Ian,

5835
02:32:02,431 --> 02:32:03,270
do you have a podcast?

5836
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:04,561
No,

5837
02:32:04,561 --> 02:32:04,951
not really.

5838
02:32:04,951 --> 02:32:07,920
I mean I stopped waiting for fuck's pull
their head up their ass and get your

5839
02:32:07,921 --> 02:32:08,281
own shit.

5840
02:32:08,281 --> 02:32:09,750
Totally do a podcast.

5841
02:32:09,751 --> 02:32:12,060
And if you did a podcast
like just break uncle creepy.

5842
02:32:12,061 --> 02:32:14,610
He's having Mapix just a week of creepy.

5843
02:32:14,670 --> 02:32:15,420
MMM.

5844
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:15,960
That's it.

5845
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:19,320
You could get it ready for the alumni
of the fights and you can talk mad shit.

5846
02:32:19,350 --> 02:32:20,670
You can suck on your vaporizer.

5847
02:32:20,671 --> 02:32:21,650
You do it all on youtube.

5848
02:32:22,470 --> 02:32:23,060
I,

5849
02:32:23,060 --> 02:32:24,030
especially if you're,

5850
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:25,890
if you really feel like
your body's telling you,

5851
02:32:25,891 --> 02:32:26,071
hey,

5852
02:32:26,071 --> 02:32:27,390
this is the last go round,

5853
02:32:28,050 --> 02:32:30,510
get ready for something new
and that's a good way to do it.

5854
02:32:30,511 --> 02:32:33,030
And that way you could use
the vape pen and you're like,

5855
02:32:33,031 --> 02:32:33,481
well you didn't do it.

5856
02:32:33,481 --> 02:32:34,314
You can task me.

5857
02:32:34,540 --> 02:32:36,240
We need to do tell me I
can't do this anymore.

5858
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:37,350
I'm not doing it anymore anyway.

5859
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:37,781
Yeah.

5860
02:32:37,781 --> 02:32:38,614
So you know,

5861
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:40,760
but because other all do something,

5862
02:32:40,770 --> 02:32:41,050
I mean I'll,

5863
02:32:41,050 --> 02:32:41,883
I'll figure it out.

5864
02:32:41,920 --> 02:32:43,360
I don't because I'm,

5865
02:32:43,361 --> 02:32:45,540
I'm just saying that doing
it through Fox or something,

5866
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:48,480
you got to get sanctioned if you're going
to do it through a production company

5867
02:32:48,481 --> 02:32:49,350
or any of those.

5868
02:32:49,351 --> 02:32:50,131
And it's hard.

5869
02:32:50,131 --> 02:32:50,821
Bunch of steps.

5870
02:32:50,821 --> 02:32:51,060
Yeah.

5871
02:32:51,060 --> 02:32:51,780
Hard.

5872
02:32:51,780 --> 02:32:52,440
You know,

5873
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:53,850
big brown has been through the hoops.

5874
02:32:53,970 --> 02:32:54,790
It's hard.

5875
02:32:54,790 --> 02:32:55,591
I know what it is,

5876
02:32:55,591 --> 02:32:58,290
is I've had a lot of people promise me
they're going to help me do it and help

5877
02:32:58,291 --> 02:32:58,860
me figure it out.

5878
02:32:58,860 --> 02:33:00,620
Cause I'm kind of retarded
when the podcasts,

5879
02:33:00,980 --> 02:33:01,310
uh,

5880
02:33:01,310 --> 02:33:02,340
with podcasts and all that chef.

5881
02:33:02,341 --> 02:33:03,570
And then it just never happened.

5882
02:33:03,571 --> 02:33:05,010
And I guess I'm too lazy on my own,

5883
02:33:05,011 --> 02:33:05,850
so I haven't done it.

5884
02:33:05,851 --> 02:33:06,390
But now,

5885
02:33:06,390 --> 02:33:07,240
now it's getting to you.

5886
02:33:07,250 --> 02:33:08,071
You can't be lazy.

5887
02:33:08,071 --> 02:33:08,840
You got to make sure.

5888
02:33:08,840 --> 02:33:08,941
Well,

5889
02:33:08,941 --> 02:33:10,650
I mean it's now it's getting
the point where I have to,

5890
02:33:10,651 --> 02:33:11,241
I don't have a choice.

5891
02:33:11,241 --> 02:33:12,780
You gotta make it happen
and you can do it.

5892
02:33:13,020 --> 02:33:14,320
You got a great personality.

5893
02:33:14,350 --> 02:33:15,270
Talk a lot of shit.

5894
02:33:15,510 --> 02:33:16,620
You've been in the cage,

5895
02:33:16,670 --> 02:33:19,320
you've gone super fucking crazy matches,

5896
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:20,041
dude.

5897
02:33:20,041 --> 02:33:20,790
Personality.

5898
02:33:20,790 --> 02:33:21,623
You got it.

5899
02:33:23,670 --> 02:33:25,290
Got another idea.

5900
02:33:25,350 --> 02:33:25,861
You want to,

5901
02:33:25,861 --> 02:33:26,460
yeah.

5902
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:28,070
I mean if you've got
something else that you're,

5903
02:33:28,180 --> 02:33:29,300
you're thinking no.

5904
02:33:29,310 --> 02:33:34,140
What it means great personality and
outside of MMA you have great opinions on

5905
02:33:34,141 --> 02:33:35,040
all kinds of shit.

5906
02:33:35,310 --> 02:33:36,900
Like you could talk shit about everything,

5907
02:33:37,100 --> 02:33:37,420
you know,

5908
02:33:37,420 --> 02:33:41,550
and Bra and Brendan and Brian and I
and Eddie and all of us are proven.

5909
02:33:41,820 --> 02:33:44,160
You don't have to be an expert
and things talk about them.

5910
02:33:45,030 --> 02:33:50,030
We've talked about everything from
fucking genetics to rocket traveling 11

5911
02:33:51,210 --> 02:33:52,230
inside job or not.

5912
02:33:52,560 --> 02:33:53,281
I want an inside job.

5913
02:33:53,281 --> 02:33:56,630
Know about nine 11 inside job
and she's just don't do it.

5914
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:57,503
Don't do it.

5915
02:33:58,110 --> 02:33:58,531
I don't know,

5916
02:33:58,531 --> 02:33:59,340
man.

5917
02:33:59,340 --> 02:34:00,173
Don't answer that.

5918
02:34:01,220 --> 02:34:02,053
You're already smart.

5919
02:34:02,450 --> 02:34:03,630
Get Eddie another beer

5920
02:34:05,460 --> 02:34:06,293
real quick.

5921
02:34:09,010 --> 02:34:09,550
Real quick.

5922
02:34:09,550 --> 02:34:10,090
Chemtrails?

5923
02:34:10,090 --> 02:34:10,441
Yes or no?

5924
02:34:10,441 --> 02:34:11,274
Vaccine.

5925
02:34:11,730 --> 02:34:12,750
A killer or an aid.

5926
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:14,731
How many,

5927
02:34:14,731 --> 02:34:16,950
how many towers went down
on nine 11 oh my God.

5928
02:34:20,380 --> 02:34:20,620
I know.

5929
02:34:20,620 --> 02:34:23,430
He knows my brothers crazy
like you are signing.

5930
02:34:24,990 --> 02:34:26,080
Oh Shit.

5931
02:34:26,200 --> 02:34:27,890
Donald Serone very happy.

5932
02:34:27,910 --> 02:34:31,580
The fact that he knows the three towers
went down means that you kind of know.

5933
02:34:31,650 --> 02:34:32,240
She knows.

5934
02:34:32,240 --> 02:34:32,741
No.

5935
02:34:32,741 --> 02:34:33,760
Most people don't know.

5936
02:34:33,940 --> 02:34:35,980
They'll say to most people don't know.

5937
02:34:36,070 --> 02:34:39,370
Most people do not know three times where
they'll get Jamie trying to save the

5938
02:34:39,371 --> 02:34:40,080
show,

5939
02:34:40,080 --> 02:34:40,751
but turn it up.

5940
02:34:40,751 --> 02:34:41,584
Donald's interview.

5941
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:46,830
Where'd it go in the background starts
showing towers falling that you press gel

5942
02:34:48,510 --> 02:34:49,490
like underneath the table.

5943
02:34:50,650 --> 02:34:51,820
I turned to shit.

5944
02:34:52,470 --> 02:34:53,980
Puts Chem gels on in the background.

5945
02:34:56,970 --> 02:34:57,803
That's a plant.

5946
02:34:57,970 --> 02:34:59,130
That's a southwest.

5947
02:34:59,140 --> 02:34:59,340
Right?

5948
02:34:59,340 --> 02:35:00,173
Then

5949
02:35:03,230 --> 02:35:04,990
Kelly's such a fucking beast.

5950
02:35:06,970 --> 02:35:08,050
That's a strong,

5951
02:35:08,051 --> 02:35:08,471
strong,

5952
02:35:08,471 --> 02:35:09,111
he's supposed to pay.

5953
02:35:09,111 --> 02:35:10,510
Who you supposed to fight?

5954
02:35:10,511 --> 02:35:14,440
The dirty bird to me and to
means test positive to this day.

5955
02:35:14,441 --> 02:35:17,180
Denies you to get anything wrong
and said he took us up on that.

5956
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:19,930
Has anybody ever said,

5957
02:35:19,931 --> 02:35:20,621
okay fuck.

5958
02:35:20,621 --> 02:35:21,610
I was trying to get a joke.

5959
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:23,610
I regret it.

5960
02:35:23,611 --> 02:35:24,880
Here's what I was going to say.

5961
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:29,080
They use side of people tell us that
everything be all that shit that you're

5962
02:35:29,081 --> 02:35:30,640
buying and fucking GNC.

5963
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:32,110
Everything is suspect.

5964
02:35:32,390 --> 02:35:35,350
They have a list on the EU side
of page where you should go.

5965
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:38,260
I've read it buddy that's thinking about
competing in anything where they get

5966
02:35:38,261 --> 02:35:38,980
tested.

5967
02:35:38,980 --> 02:35:39,731
Go to that list.

5968
02:35:39,731 --> 02:35:40,564
It's insane.

5969
02:35:40,630 --> 02:35:43,750
If you're buying like Tesoro
testosterone boosters from GNC,

5970
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:43,940
yeah,

5971
02:35:43,940 --> 02:35:44,711
you idiot.

5972
02:35:44,711 --> 02:35:45,490
But Dude,

5973
02:35:45,490 --> 02:35:46,780
I've been taking someone's all my life,

5974
02:35:46,781 --> 02:35:50,470
I've been tested all my life but he
never been tested under the of like

5975
02:35:50,680 --> 02:35:51,513
guidelines.

5976
02:35:51,610 --> 02:35:52,720
NCAA.

5977
02:35:52,990 --> 02:35:54,010
I got tested the other day.

5978
02:35:54,011 --> 02:35:55,060
I mean like a motherfucker.

5979
02:35:55,090 --> 02:35:58,750
The only thing I haven't taken on and
stuff and I was doing Danna Danieli below

5980
02:35:58,830 --> 02:35:59,740
Billy's podcasts

5981
02:36:01,310 --> 02:36:02,860
and then outlet on it by the way.

5982
02:36:03,210 --> 02:36:04,001
They called me and like,

5983
02:36:04,001 --> 02:36:04,151
Hey,

5984
02:36:04,151 --> 02:36:06,160
where are you in la?

5985
02:36:06,310 --> 02:36:06,491
Like,

5986
02:36:06,491 --> 02:36:07,150
Whoa,

5987
02:36:07,150 --> 02:36:07,841
we went by your house.

5988
02:36:07,841 --> 02:36:08,231
You're not there.

5989
02:36:08,231 --> 02:36:08,471
I'm like,

5990
02:36:08,471 --> 02:36:08,840
yeah man,

5991
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:09,970
La went by your gym.

5992
02:36:09,971 --> 02:36:10,301
You're not there.

5993
02:36:10,301 --> 02:36:10,511
I'm like,

5994
02:36:10,511 --> 02:36:10,771
yes,

5995
02:36:10,771 --> 02:36:11,604
I'm in La.

5996
02:36:11,620 --> 02:36:12,341
Here's my address.

5997
02:36:12,341 --> 02:36:16,300
Meet me here or so after you have
to drop whatever you're doing,

5998
02:36:16,610 --> 02:36:18,880
what have you had like tickets
to the most awesome show.

5999
02:36:19,120 --> 02:36:21,630
Like you're going to go to a play or
something like that with your lady you're

6000
02:36:21,631 --> 02:36:21,760
at,

6001
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:22,900
how long does it take to do this?

6002
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:23,430
They had,

6003
02:36:23,430 --> 02:36:25,240
once they contact you and
has to be within an hour,

6004
02:36:25,241 --> 02:36:26,110
so they drove.

6005
02:36:26,111 --> 02:36:27,250
I was literally parking.

6006
02:36:27,340 --> 02:36:28,450
That's so annoying.

6007
02:36:28,480 --> 02:36:28,811
And they,

6008
02:36:28,811 --> 02:36:29,510
I know it's so,

6009
02:36:29,510 --> 02:36:30,400
why don't you dig holes?

6010
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:32,830
Meet me at like six o'clock in
the morning when I'm waking up.

6011
02:36:32,860 --> 02:36:33,520
If you don't show,

6012
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:35,140
if you tell him if you
don't make it happen,

6013
02:36:35,170 --> 02:36:39,790
positive test or you get three straps
that having a cowboy cowboy was in fucking

6014
02:36:39,791 --> 02:36:40,810
Vegas for the UFC.

6015
02:36:40,811 --> 02:36:41,700
They showed up at his ranch.

6016
02:36:41,701 --> 02:36:41,921
She's like,

6017
02:36:41,921 --> 02:36:42,221
where are you at?

6018
02:36:42,221 --> 02:36:43,120
Is I'm in Vegas.

6019
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:45,490
You have to tell us how
you see for the UFC.

6020
02:36:45,491 --> 02:36:46,324
I'm in Vegas.

6021
02:36:46,810 --> 02:36:49,300
And they gave him like
a failure to notify,

6022
02:36:49,850 --> 02:36:50,260
you know,

6023
02:36:50,260 --> 02:36:51,100
fuck off,

6024
02:36:51,460 --> 02:36:53,380
fuck off and bunch of squares,

6025
02:36:53,381 --> 02:36:53,620
man.

6026
02:36:53,620 --> 02:36:56,020
I got one of those for
not filling out my app.

6027
02:36:56,110 --> 02:36:56,950
Am I gonna get in trouble for it?

6028
02:36:56,951 --> 02:36:57,640
I'm talking about this.

6029
02:36:57,640 --> 02:36:58,420
Um,

6030
02:36:58,420 --> 02:36:59,253
I don't care.

6031
02:36:59,890 --> 02:37:00,900
Um,

6032
02:37:01,540 --> 02:37:04,480
but for not filling out
my whereabouts in time.

6033
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:05,950
And they sent me a letter and I was like,

6034
02:37:05,951 --> 02:37:06,311
Dad,

6035
02:37:06,311 --> 02:37:06,551
look,

6036
02:37:06,551 --> 02:37:09,310
cause like it's like the fucking principal
sent me a letter not figuring out,

6037
02:37:09,311 --> 02:37:09,940
well,

6038
02:37:09,940 --> 02:37:11,680
you know it alls with good intentions.

6039
02:37:11,681 --> 02:37:13,180
They're trying to catch more people.

6040
02:37:13,210 --> 02:37:13,961
I think it's good,

6041
02:37:13,961 --> 02:37:15,590
but a lot of people,

6042
02:37:15,770 --> 02:37:15,980
which

6043
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:16,781
is pretty fucking funny.

6044
02:37:16,781 --> 02:37:20,460
It's a lot of people will find the same.

6045
02:37:20,800 --> 02:37:22,300
If it was up to you with what,

6046
02:37:22,301 --> 02:37:22,820
uh,

6047
02:37:22,820 --> 02:37:27,020
would you legalize a pds
because it's up to you.

6048
02:37:28,580 --> 02:37:29,840
That's a slippery slope.

6049
02:37:29,841 --> 02:37:30,860
Tough fucking slope.

6050
02:37:31,410 --> 02:37:32,060
They illegal.

6051
02:37:32,060 --> 02:37:33,320
I mean it was legal and pride.

6052
02:37:33,321 --> 02:37:34,154
Look what happened.

6053
02:37:34,310 --> 02:37:35,001
What's going to happen?

6054
02:37:35,001 --> 02:37:35,330
Well,

6055
02:37:35,330 --> 02:37:36,200
pride would happen.

6056
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:38,593
It's tough man.

6057
02:37:38,620 --> 02:37:39,310
Think Joe,

6058
02:37:39,310 --> 02:37:40,143
it won't be,

6059
02:37:40,310 --> 02:37:41,810
it won't be mainstream if you do that.

6060
02:37:42,080 --> 02:37:43,970
I think there's a better name.

6061
02:37:44,060 --> 02:37:44,210
I,

6062
02:37:44,210 --> 02:37:45,043
here's the problem.

6063
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:46,910
What we're trying to do is stop progress.

6064
02:37:46,940 --> 02:37:48,440
The reason why steroids are awesome,

6065
02:37:48,470 --> 02:37:50,720
it's because they work really
good at changing your body,

6066
02:37:50,900 --> 02:37:52,040
making you perform better.

6067
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:52,851
Ultimately we,

6068
02:37:52,851 --> 02:37:53,870
we're watching fighting.

6069
02:37:54,020 --> 02:37:54,890
What are we trying to say?

6070
02:37:54,891 --> 02:37:56,900
We try to see people
perform at their best,

6071
02:37:57,050 --> 02:38:00,710
so we're keeping them from the
knowledge that we're currently aware of.

6072
02:38:00,920 --> 02:38:02,960
What do we currently aware of
when it comes to performing hands?

6073
02:38:02,990 --> 02:38:03,560
Drugs.

6074
02:38:03,560 --> 02:38:04,281
If you use them,

6075
02:38:04,281 --> 02:38:05,330
your body will work better.

6076
02:38:05,570 --> 02:38:06,650
Your body will be stronger.

6077
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:07,401
It'll move quickly.

6078
02:38:07,401 --> 02:38:08,270
You have more endurance.

6079
02:38:08,271 --> 02:38:12,890
You'll be able to perform tasks with much
more veracity and intensity for longer

6080
02:38:12,891 --> 02:38:13,724
periods of time,

6081
02:38:14,510 --> 02:38:16,250
so how can they can't do it because the,

6082
02:38:16,370 --> 02:38:19,970
because using that knowledge
right now is forbidden,

6083
02:38:20,210 --> 02:38:21,710
but it's going to come a point in time,

6084
02:38:21,711 --> 02:38:23,900
whether it's a year from
now or 20 years from now,

6085
02:38:23,930 --> 02:38:24,763
30 years from now,

6086
02:38:25,010 --> 02:38:28,160
where they're going to have some
undeniable shit is everybody's taking that

6087
02:38:28,161 --> 02:38:30,800
people would just normally taking
because it keeps you from getting sick.

6088
02:38:30,920 --> 02:38:32,450
It changes the way your body works.

6089
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:33,051
Your body,

6090
02:38:33,051 --> 02:38:35,090
like a regular person's
body looks like Yoel Romero,

6091
02:38:35,091 --> 02:38:35,840
his body,

6092
02:38:35,840 --> 02:38:36,680
we're all going to take it,

6093
02:38:36,681 --> 02:38:37,440
but then,

6094
02:38:37,440 --> 02:38:39,500
but then all athletes
would be taking it then.

6095
02:38:39,501 --> 02:38:40,281
Then it's going to get real,

6096
02:38:40,281 --> 02:38:40,911
super weird.

6097
02:38:40,911 --> 02:38:41,181
It's like,

6098
02:38:41,181 --> 02:38:43,910
well what happened all those years when
you couldn't take it or you had a high

6099
02:38:43,911 --> 02:38:46,250
that you were taking it
because now they're going to
have stuff that makes you,

6100
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:48,440
there's not going to be people anymore.

6101
02:38:48,620 --> 02:38:51,830
We're going to come a time when 30 or
40 years where genetic engineering has

6102
02:38:51,831 --> 02:38:52,730
reached a point where we're,

6103
02:38:52,940 --> 02:38:54,550
we're engineering human bad.

6104
02:38:54,551 --> 02:38:55,180
I want to be around.

6105
02:38:55,180 --> 02:38:56,120
You got to have a designer.

6106
02:38:56,150 --> 02:38:57,380
Why it's going to be awesome.

6107
02:38:57,530 --> 02:38:58,700
I'm going to be the Hawk fuck off.

6108
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:00,193
I'm going to jump over.

6109
02:39:00,310 --> 02:39:05,310
You're going to be 110 we're all going
to be 110 but you're going to be 110 with

6110
02:39:05,481 --> 02:39:08,150
the science that comes
from surviving till then.

6111
02:39:08,360 --> 02:39:09,800
They say that if you can live,

6112
02:39:09,940 --> 02:39:11,120
if you can live today,

6113
02:39:11,121 --> 02:39:14,630
if you're like a 30 year old guy today
and you could live to be 50 you could

6114
02:39:14,631 --> 02:39:16,790
probably live to be 200 fuck off.

6115
02:39:16,791 --> 02:39:17,260
For reals.

6116
02:39:17,260 --> 02:39:18,093
Yes,

6117
02:39:18,130 --> 02:39:18,700
I've heard all day.

6118
02:39:18,700 --> 02:39:21,560
They're talking about within our lifetime,

6119
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:23,640
some ground breaking life,

6120
02:39:23,641 --> 02:39:27,200
changing shit in life
extension and how long you can,

6121
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:29,990
how long have you live and
how healthy you can be.

6122
02:39:30,560 --> 02:39:31,071
That guy,

6123
02:39:31,071 --> 02:39:32,630
that doctor Peter Welling,

6124
02:39:32,631 --> 02:39:33,464
whenever his name is,

6125
02:39:33,470 --> 02:39:34,700
the Regena Cain doctor,

6126
02:39:34,910 --> 02:39:37,340
they're that close to some new thing.

6127
02:39:37,341 --> 02:39:39,920
They're going to do it with college
and I don't know how it works,

6128
02:39:39,921 --> 02:39:41,810
but apparently the breakthrough,

6129
02:39:41,811 --> 02:39:46,100
if they can prove what they believe they
can prove and then do what they think

6130
02:39:46,101 --> 02:39:46,470
they can do,

6131
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:47,910
they're gonna be able
to regenerate college.

6132
02:39:47,930 --> 02:39:51,110
And people like what makes someone an
old person is your college and sort of

6133
02:39:51,111 --> 02:39:51,944
falls apart.

6134
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:53,480
Your face consult droopy,

6135
02:39:53,481 --> 02:39:54,830
you lose the elasticity.

6136
02:39:54,950 --> 02:39:59,300
Well they going to be a little regenerate
chicken glass half full with this

6137
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:01,300
fucking Guy Joe.

6138
02:40:01,340 --> 02:40:05,750
How full or am I a real list you don't
have to pull is half full is actually

6139
02:40:05,751 --> 02:40:06,584
meaning.

6140
02:40:06,910 --> 02:40:07,743
Gotcha.

6141
02:40:08,180 --> 02:40:08,640
Okay,

6142
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:09,380
Gotcha.

6143
02:40:09,380 --> 02:40:10,180
I was joking.

6144
02:40:10,180 --> 02:40:10,730
Gotcha.

6145
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:11,080
But you,

6146
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:12,170
I actually said it wrong.

6147
02:40:12,171 --> 02:40:13,590
I meant to say they did empty,

6148
02:40:13,830 --> 02:40:14,040
but

6149
02:40:14,040 --> 02:40:15,390
that is what you're doing
is trying to help you.

6150
02:40:15,391 --> 02:40:16,110
Brendan isn't,

6151
02:40:16,110 --> 02:40:16,950
you're going to,

6152
02:40:16,980 --> 02:40:18,990
you're going to have to accept science.

6153
02:40:19,150 --> 02:40:19,983
Brian did Chubb,

6154
02:40:26,360 --> 02:40:28,760
I'm not saying that,

6155
02:40:28,761 --> 02:40:29,594
I'm not saying

6156
02:40:30,360 --> 02:40:32,190
if you were a kid and you got polio,

6157
02:40:32,460 --> 02:40:32,910
you know,

6158
02:40:32,910 --> 02:40:36,300
back in the day it was over and then
they had to come up with the vaccines and

6159
02:40:36,301 --> 02:40:37,530
then all of a sudden no polio.

6160
02:40:37,710 --> 02:40:38,550
I mean the all,

6161
02:40:38,580 --> 02:40:41,100
there's the thing about all the different
things that they figured out today.

6162
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:42,690
He used to break your leg three,

6163
02:40:42,691 --> 02:40:43,381
400 years ago.

6164
02:40:43,381 --> 02:40:44,760
You're fucked now.

6165
02:40:44,761 --> 02:40:45,594
You break your leg,

6166
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:48,750
they fucking screw some plates in that
big stitch y'all up and you're good to

6167
02:40:48,751 --> 02:40:49,010
go.

6168
02:40:49,010 --> 02:40:49,430
Yep.

6169
02:40:49,430 --> 02:40:53,310
They mean uncle creepys had
how many fucking surgeries.

6170
02:40:53,311 --> 02:40:54,144
Think about that.

6171
02:40:54,240 --> 02:40:55,680
All this stuff that you had done to you.

6172
02:40:55,830 --> 02:40:57,240
If you live 500 years ago,

6173
02:40:57,241 --> 02:40:58,200
you'd be dead man.

6174
02:40:58,260 --> 02:40:58,471
I'd be,

6175
02:40:58,471 --> 02:40:58,891
fuck yeah,

6176
02:40:58,891 --> 02:41:00,510
it'd be dead and I would be too.

6177
02:41:00,511 --> 02:41:03,240
And you'd be all fucked up and
when you would be fucked up,

6178
02:41:03,241 --> 02:41:04,170
cause you've ever heard of nobody.

6179
02:41:04,500 --> 02:41:05,820
I don't know about the hernia surgery.

6180
02:41:05,820 --> 02:41:06,653
Could to be alive.

6181
02:41:06,840 --> 02:41:07,021
Yeah,

6182
02:41:07,021 --> 02:41:07,651
but you'd be fine.

6183
02:41:07,651 --> 02:41:09,120
But you'd have like a
big holes where you're,

6184
02:41:09,300 --> 02:41:09,481
I mean,

6185
02:41:09,481 --> 02:41:10,310
they've figured it out,

6186
02:41:10,310 --> 02:41:13,860
her use her screaming and yelling and
I wouldn't be screaming and yelling and

6187
02:41:13,950 --> 02:41:15,560
you don't know 17 id,

6188
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:16,470
you might,

6189
02:41:16,470 --> 02:41:17,550
you would definitely be screaming,

6190
02:41:17,551 --> 02:41:17,881
yelling,

6191
02:41:17,881 --> 02:41:22,260
don't hate me running Zombie hordes.

6192
02:41:22,290 --> 02:41:23,950
But my point is that they,

6193
02:41:23,980 --> 02:41:25,620
these guys are going to keep innovating.

6194
02:41:25,650 --> 02:41:28,980
Every new invention opens a
door for other new inventions.

6195
02:41:28,981 --> 02:41:33,320
Every new technology opens the door for
a whole branch of new technologies that

6196
02:41:33,321 --> 02:41:34,154
would come from it.

6197
02:41:34,320 --> 02:41:34,971
And so they're,

6198
02:41:34,971 --> 02:41:37,950
they're on their way to figuring
out how to regenerate tissue.

6199
02:41:38,160 --> 02:41:40,080
The stem cell shit that
they're doing today,

6200
02:41:40,470 --> 02:41:40,861
you know,

6201
02:41:40,861 --> 02:41:41,191
I mean,

6202
02:41:41,191 --> 02:41:41,761
they're doing some,

6203
02:41:41,761 --> 02:41:42,151
really,

6204
02:41:42,151 --> 02:41:44,970
it's at boss ruin was telling me
about how they shot stem cells in them

6205
02:41:44,971 --> 02:41:45,870
intravenously.

6206
02:41:46,100 --> 02:41:47,040
If that's the they with me.

6207
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:48,420
Oh really brilliant.

6208
02:41:48,480 --> 02:41:50,490
Intervenient stem cell
and then spot injection.

6209
02:41:50,940 --> 02:41:51,930
Where did they get the stem cells?

6210
02:41:53,220 --> 02:41:54,570
Are you sure it wasn't PRP?

6211
02:41:54,820 --> 02:41:55,970
I was both know,

6212
02:41:56,350 --> 02:41:56,710
but I,

6213
02:41:56,710 --> 02:42:01,110
I've had both of them that the stem cells
is stem cells and they are doing stem

6214
02:42:01,111 --> 02:42:01,411
cells.

6215
02:42:01,411 --> 02:42:01,591
Now.

6216
02:42:01,591 --> 02:42:05,910
The one that I did with in Vegas was
from a woman's placenta from young women

6217
02:42:05,911 --> 02:42:07,210
that gets a Syrian sections.

6218
02:42:07,220 --> 02:42:09,780
He took the placenta and
they converted stem cells.

6219
02:42:09,870 --> 02:42:10,703
Yeah.

6220
02:42:11,660 --> 02:42:12,240
What did it,

6221
02:42:12,240 --> 02:42:14,130
what did it feel like when
they shot at intravenously?

6222
02:42:14,940 --> 02:42:15,690
I didn't feel anything.

6223
02:42:15,690 --> 02:42:16,150
Nothing.

6224
02:42:16,150 --> 02:42:18,450
I was sitting there and you know,

6225
02:42:18,451 --> 02:42:20,550
we got it done and kind of work.

6226
02:42:20,580 --> 02:42:21,900
Did you feel like amazing?

6227
02:42:22,410 --> 02:42:23,430
Well I mean it's all,

6228
02:42:23,490 --> 02:42:24,031
it's all here,

6229
02:42:24,031 --> 02:42:24,340
but my,

6230
02:42:24,340 --> 02:42:26,080
my shoulder's healed up the shore.

6231
02:42:26,090 --> 02:42:27,410
I'm still smaller than this one.

6232
02:42:27,430 --> 02:42:29,160
It just keeps coming out of socket.

6233
02:42:29,730 --> 02:42:29,881
No,

6234
02:42:29,881 --> 02:42:30,060
no,

6235
02:42:30,060 --> 02:42:30,300
no,

6236
02:42:30,300 --> 02:42:30,480
no.

6237
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:31,500
I had torn all,

6238
02:42:31,620 --> 02:42:32,880
all four of the parts,

6239
02:42:32,881 --> 02:42:33,714
you know,

6240
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:36,960
and now it's this thing just pop like I
thought I felt the pop it down here and

6241
02:42:36,961 --> 02:42:39,420
like the muscle tendon had
nothing to do with the,

6242
02:42:39,910 --> 02:42:40,210
Oh will.

6243
02:42:40,210 --> 02:42:44,250
I tore down here a little bit when I
tore my shoulder and now this is kind of

6244
02:42:44,251 --> 02:42:45,930
where it popped so chore again.

6245
02:42:45,931 --> 02:42:47,850
So there's issues with the whole chain.

6246
02:42:47,910 --> 02:42:48,200
Yeah,

6247
02:42:48,200 --> 02:42:53,200
just the tool chain that
I've been fighting with one
arm for one hand at least

6248
02:42:53,281 --> 02:42:55,320
for a couple of years doing work though.

6249
02:42:55,830 --> 02:42:58,290
If one arm or punch him
people with this thing sucks.

6250
02:42:59,580 --> 02:42:59,940
Yeah.

6251
02:42:59,940 --> 02:43:00,481
God Damn,

6252
02:43:00,481 --> 02:43:01,910
you can't make a fist to fist.

6253
02:43:01,970 --> 02:43:02,803
No,

6254
02:43:02,830 --> 02:43:02,941
no.

6255
02:43:02,941 --> 02:43:03,691
The one finger.

6256
02:43:03,691 --> 02:43:04,470
That's incredible.

6257
02:43:04,470 --> 02:43:05,760
Good fire at that point that,

6258
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:06,623
that operated on it.

6259
02:43:09,860 --> 02:43:10,980
You better get on that.

6260
02:43:12,910 --> 02:43:13,743
Cool.

6261
02:43:14,390 --> 02:43:15,570
Oh yeah.

6262
02:43:15,580 --> 02:43:17,470
I've had my hand up or broken twice.

6263
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:22,920
Three operations and then a one bad
Murcia infection that was far as the scary

6264
02:43:23,021 --> 02:43:23,411
shit.

6265
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:24,120
Huh?

6266
02:43:24,120 --> 02:43:24,641
Having mercy.

6267
02:43:24,641 --> 02:43:25,001
Cause you know,

6268
02:43:25,001 --> 02:43:27,940
I ended up in Brazil with a blood
infection and I don't think,

6269
02:43:27,941 --> 02:43:28,960
I don't know if it's mercy or not,

6270
02:43:28,961 --> 02:43:29,794
but it was in my blood.

6271
02:43:29,890 --> 02:43:30,520
Oh my God.

6272
02:43:30,520 --> 02:43:33,390
This infectious still remember when I
went to fight Lineker the first time and

6273
02:43:33,391 --> 02:43:34,300
I'd be made Wayne's,

6274
02:43:34,301 --> 02:43:35,230
I walked into the happen,

6275
02:43:35,260 --> 02:43:40,260
I walked in the back and I took one
bite of fruit and then just walk and uh,

6276
02:43:40,570 --> 02:43:40,991
and uh,

6277
02:43:40,991 --> 02:43:43,130
you know Isabella grow the role.

6278
02:43:43,240 --> 02:43:43,391
Yeah.

6279
02:43:43,391 --> 02:43:44,620
The girl that runs the shows down there,

6280
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:45,490
uh,

6281
02:43:45,490 --> 02:43:46,890
probably met know about fees,

6282
02:43:46,960 --> 02:43:47,351
but she,

6283
02:43:47,351 --> 02:43:47,951
she was just like,

6284
02:43:47,951 --> 02:43:48,970
oh everyone get definitely get out.

6285
02:43:49,030 --> 02:43:50,980
Everyone went out and they
just write it right there.

6286
02:43:51,090 --> 02:43:52,060
Hooked me up with diabetes.

6287
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:52,990
And so did the,

6288
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:54,730
what kind of blood infection was it?

6289
02:43:54,770 --> 02:43:55,603
They say,

6290
02:43:55,900 --> 02:43:56,291
I don't,

6291
02:43:56,291 --> 02:43:56,801
I didn't ask.

6292
02:43:56,801 --> 02:43:57,750
How about Danny's me?

6293
02:43:57,940 --> 02:43:58,440
Ooh,

6294
02:43:58,440 --> 02:43:59,273
Ooh God.

6295
02:43:59,290 --> 02:44:00,310
Nobody knew Danny.

6296
02:44:00,640 --> 02:44:01,211
He did a,

6297
02:44:01,211 --> 02:44:03,430
the last Ebi Ebi five.

6298
02:44:03,460 --> 02:44:05,050
He looked good at to have a good,

6299
02:44:05,051 --> 02:44:06,430
but he didn't train at all for that.

6300
02:44:06,610 --> 02:44:07,510
Nobody knew.

6301
02:44:07,540 --> 02:44:07,931
No,

6302
02:44:07,931 --> 02:44:08,930
he wasn't going to do it.

6303
02:44:08,931 --> 02:44:09,220
He was,

6304
02:44:09,220 --> 02:44:12,320
he had Murcia inside
his needs training camp.

6305
02:44:12,670 --> 02:44:14,710
I didn't want him to
tell people who it was,

6306
02:44:14,711 --> 02:44:17,230
but I put it the picture of
his knee up on my Instagram.

6307
02:44:17,410 --> 02:44:20,200
But I'm seeing her fight at
Jamie's from a few months ago.

6308
02:44:20,620 --> 02:44:21,100
He was,

6309
02:44:21,100 --> 02:44:24,490
he was right in the middle
of Ebi five training camp.

6310
02:44:24,820 --> 02:44:25,900
And I gave him,

6311
02:44:25,901 --> 02:44:26,231
I said,

6312
02:44:26,231 --> 02:44:26,591
you know what,

6313
02:44:26,591 --> 02:44:27,040
I'm not gonna.

6314
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:27,873
I'm not gonna pull you.

6315
02:44:28,270 --> 02:44:28,511
And he goes,

6316
02:44:28,511 --> 02:44:29,230
you're not like,

6317
02:44:29,230 --> 02:44:33,940
let's wait until two weeks before the
show and we'll see where we're at.

6318
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,710
And that two week mark,

6319
02:44:36,070 --> 02:44:37,120
that's when he started,

6320
02:44:37,180 --> 02:44:38,500
he was able to roll light.

6321
02:44:38,620 --> 02:44:39,011
So we're like,

6322
02:44:39,011 --> 02:44:39,880
you want to go for it?

6323
02:44:39,970 --> 02:44:40,803
You want it.

6324
02:44:40,960 --> 02:44:43,930
There was so many times where
it was 100% that he was out,

6325
02:44:43,931 --> 02:44:44,680
but I wouldn't,

6326
02:44:44,680 --> 02:44:45,170
I just said,

6327
02:44:45,170 --> 02:44:45,910
let's wait.

6328
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:46,960
Let's see what happens.

6329
02:44:47,170 --> 02:44:49,390
Those fucking pictures of his knee,

6330
02:44:49,620 --> 02:44:51,550
but no one knew the fuck that was.

6331
02:44:51,580 --> 02:44:51,911
No,

6332
02:44:51,911 --> 02:44:52,990
I didn't say who it was.

6333
02:44:53,320 --> 02:44:56,590
I put the pictures up on Instagram
because I wanted to alert people to the

6334
02:44:56,591 --> 02:44:58,210
dangers of staph infection.

6335
02:44:58,240 --> 02:44:59,830
Cause a lot of Jujitsu places,

6336
02:45:00,100 --> 02:45:02,380
they don't tell people about staff.

6337
02:45:02,680 --> 02:45:03,710
And so you get like a,

6338
02:45:03,711 --> 02:45:07,030
a bump on your knee and you don't know
what the fuck it is and then it gets

6339
02:45:07,031 --> 02:45:08,050
worse and then you don't,

6340
02:45:08,080 --> 02:45:10,690
you ignore it and then it gets
to the point where it's systemic.

6341
02:45:10,810 --> 02:45:14,740
If you think you have a pimple or a
spider bite and you keep itching something

6342
02:45:14,741 --> 02:45:15,670
and it keeps getting bigger,

6343
02:45:15,700 --> 02:45:16,533
bigger and bigger,

6344
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:18,220
you might have staff,

6345
02:45:18,221 --> 02:45:21,730
you might have mercy if you'd think there
was a spider bite on you on your leg

6346
02:45:21,731 --> 02:45:25,090
or your arm or a pimple
that just got infected,

6347
02:45:25,390 --> 02:45:26,440
run to the,

6348
02:45:26,640 --> 02:45:27,473
that's what I,

6349
02:45:27,490 --> 02:45:28,570
Debbie could a tired,

6350
02:45:28,990 --> 02:45:31,240
I thought it was a
spider bite in my armpit.

6351
02:45:31,330 --> 02:45:32,710
I was wrestling and uh,

6352
02:45:33,190 --> 02:45:35,830
I sent a picture of my coach
is a big ass thing and I go,

6353
02:45:35,831 --> 02:45:36,161
hey man,

6354
02:45:36,161 --> 02:45:37,450
I think a spider bite.

6355
02:45:37,480 --> 02:45:38,050
And he goes,

6356
02:45:38,050 --> 02:45:39,940
have you been to fucking Africa lately?

6357
02:45:39,941 --> 02:45:41,000
What spider would do that?

6358
02:45:41,001 --> 02:45:41,834
That staff,

6359
02:45:42,010 --> 02:45:45,220
it was like huge to white
bubbles and my armpit.

6360
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:46,841
Where'd you go?

6361
02:45:46,841 --> 02:45:47,674
Africa.

6362
02:45:47,920 --> 02:45:48,753
Where

6363
02:45:50,020 --> 02:45:51,580
the first time I had it was in my knee.

6364
02:45:51,890 --> 02:45:52,720
You fucking,

6365
02:45:52,720 --> 02:45:53,501
a decade ago.

6366
02:45:53,501 --> 02:45:54,210
You're right.

6367
02:45:54,210 --> 02:45:56,350
When Marissa first came out and
Mike Gaiman hat and he goes,

6368
02:45:56,351 --> 02:45:56,501
Hey,

6369
02:45:56,501 --> 02:45:57,334
get to the hospital.

6370
02:45:59,200 --> 02:46:00,460
That's Danny's me.

6371
02:46:00,760 --> 02:46:01,430
That was,

6372
02:46:01,430 --> 02:46:03,880
that was like three weeks before Ebi.

6373
02:46:03,910 --> 02:46:04,900
What a Badass.

6374
02:46:05,080 --> 02:46:05,913
He did him.

6375
02:46:06,830 --> 02:46:07,660
That's fine.

6376
02:46:07,660 --> 02:46:08,980
I just had to put that up there.

6377
02:46:09,770 --> 02:46:10,160
That's

6378
02:46:10,160 --> 02:46:10,801
Danny pro.

6379
02:46:10,801 --> 02:46:11,810
Coppos Nice.

6380
02:46:11,811 --> 02:46:12,680
Such a nice guy.

6381
02:46:12,681 --> 02:46:15,560
Look at that guy in the
hospital for a week.

6382
02:46:15,710 --> 02:46:17,360
He was in the hospital for a week.

6383
02:46:17,361 --> 02:46:20,570
They had a suction machine
on his knee all day,

6384
02:46:20,610 --> 02:46:21,850
everyday and machine.

6385
02:46:21,860 --> 02:46:23,150
It's sucked shit

6386
02:46:23,240 --> 02:46:24,073
out of the men.

6387
02:46:24,430 --> 02:46:25,010
His knee.

6388
02:46:25,010 --> 02:46:25,650
That's a bummer.

6389
02:46:25,650 --> 02:46:26,090
Yeah.

6390
02:46:26,090 --> 02:46:28,160
I think Joe Briggs went
down from my broken arm.

6391
02:46:29,390 --> 02:46:29,780
Yeah.

6392
02:46:29,780 --> 02:46:30,591
He went down immediately,

6393
02:46:30,591 --> 02:46:31,281
grabbed his arm.

6394
02:46:31,281 --> 02:46:32,114
When he went down,

6395
02:46:32,720 --> 02:46:33,990
he tried to block in the knee with his,

6396
02:46:34,070 --> 02:46:37,010
he blocked the form ruthless Kamozi knees.

6397
02:46:37,040 --> 02:46:39,590
I think he might've broken
arm the man good for him.

6398
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:42,890
Kenny's Vac can you from the
first time Kennedy's back?

6399
02:46:42,891 --> 02:46:43,724
Yeah.

6400
02:46:44,540 --> 02:46:45,373
Yeah.

6401
02:46:45,470 --> 02:46:46,460
That whole situation.

6402
02:46:46,470 --> 02:46:46,700
I'm,

6403
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:49,940
I'm glad he didn't completely lose his
job because it's not like Kenny doesn't

6404
02:46:49,941 --> 02:46:50,990
know a lot about MMA,

6405
02:46:51,290 --> 02:46:53,420
but you got to give credit
where credit's deserved.

6406
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:54,040
Yeah,

6407
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:56,720
you can't do that and now he will
know and they'll never do it again.

6408
02:46:56,721 --> 02:46:57,230
You know,

6409
02:46:57,230 --> 02:46:57,450
I'm,

6410
02:46:57,450 --> 02:46:58,100
I'm a failure.

6411
02:46:58,100 --> 02:47:00,500
I'm a fan of a guy
getting a second chance.

6412
02:47:00,530 --> 02:47:01,850
Four five,

6413
02:47:01,851 --> 02:47:02,684
six.

6414
02:47:02,690 --> 02:47:03,261
Oh my God.

6415
02:47:03,261 --> 02:47:04,130
Six card,

6416
02:47:04,131 --> 02:47:04,964
full power.

6417
02:47:04,990 --> 02:47:06,050
Many times boys hit,

6418
02:47:06,110 --> 02:47:06,530
uh,

6419
02:47:06,530 --> 02:47:09,050
Ken shamrock fits in the side of the face.

6420
02:47:10,390 --> 02:47:11,223
I just see,

6421
02:47:11,730 --> 02:47:12,561
I think first of all,

6422
02:47:12,561 --> 02:47:14,870
Ken needs a fucking diamond MMA cop.

6423
02:47:15,200 --> 02:47:15,591
You know,

6424
02:47:15,591 --> 02:47:16,161
he needs one of them.

6425
02:47:16,161 --> 02:47:17,060
Compression cuffs.

6426
02:47:17,420 --> 02:47:18,290
I wish we had gotten them.

6427
02:47:18,420 --> 02:47:18,781
And you know,

6428
02:47:18,781 --> 02:47:18,940
when,

6429
02:47:18,940 --> 02:47:20,220
when they say they say wrestlers,

6430
02:47:20,221 --> 02:47:21,570
no matter what the strategy is.

6431
02:47:21,571 --> 02:47:21,741
Like,

6432
02:47:21,741 --> 02:47:22,830
if a restaurant wants to stand standing,

6433
02:47:22,831 --> 02:47:25,800
you know his strategy is the standard
bag that people say that when,

6434
02:47:25,801 --> 02:47:27,330
when the chaos sets in,

6435
02:47:27,420 --> 02:47:30,690
wrestlers revert to the wrestling and in
the chaos they going to show what they

6436
02:47:30,691 --> 02:47:31,441
know they're going to shoot.

6437
02:47:31,441 --> 02:47:32,274
Right.

6438
02:47:32,440 --> 02:47:35,700
I swear I think Ken reverts
to pro wrestling or something.

6439
02:47:36,060 --> 02:47:36,361
It just,

6440
02:47:36,361 --> 02:47:37,570
how many times I get the shit,

6441
02:47:37,660 --> 02:47:39,660
the soccer rabo fi he goes down,

6442
02:47:39,661 --> 02:47:40,381
he's complaining,

6443
02:47:40,381 --> 02:47:41,340
he's always there.

6444
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:44,610
There's always some kind of complaint at
the end that's like wrestling and shit

6445
02:47:44,790 --> 02:47:47,070
to me and know what they
do in pro wrestling.

6446
02:47:47,220 --> 02:47:48,053
Wow.

6447
02:47:48,070 --> 02:47:50,310
That's like he's
reverting to that showman.

6448
02:47:50,480 --> 02:47:52,260
Yeah he's reverting to that showman ism.

6449
02:47:52,340 --> 02:47:55,500
Cause Cause I've seen guys get kicked
in the nuts horribly and they didn't.

6450
02:47:55,530 --> 02:47:56,363
You know what I'm saying?

6451
02:47:57,080 --> 02:48:00,040
What about that deliberately
stopped but not the delay was

6452
02:48:01,740 --> 02:48:03,880
did he get hit in the nuts and
he's like this is my way out.

6453
02:48:04,520 --> 02:48:05,820
I'm not making that happen.

6454
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:06,940
But that's an option.

6455
02:48:07,630 --> 02:48:08,680
I didn't think that at all.

6456
02:48:08,681 --> 02:48:09,514
And

6457
02:48:10,810 --> 02:48:14,530
I thought well add to see the replay to
see that he got kicked in the nuts cause

6458
02:48:14,531 --> 02:48:15,970
Jimmy Smith's seemed to be incredulous.

6459
02:48:15,971 --> 02:48:18,760
At first he was saying that it was a
shot to the head and then maybe can have

6460
02:48:18,761 --> 02:48:19,541
gotten knocked out.

6461
02:48:19,541 --> 02:48:21,220
Maybe in thought he got hit
in the nuts or something.

6462
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:24,820
But when they showed it again they
went one step before you see it.

6463
02:48:24,821 --> 02:48:25,570
It's clear.

6464
02:48:25,570 --> 02:48:28,360
Definitely it goes right to the
nuts and the way he's adjusting it.

6465
02:48:28,660 --> 02:48:30,730
That sounds to me like you
didn't have a good cup.

6466
02:48:30,850 --> 02:48:34,930
You know if you have a tie steel cup or
if you have a real good like a diamond

6467
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,400
and make compression shorts cup,

6468
02:48:36,610 --> 02:48:40,630
it wouldn't affect you that bad cause
it wasn't like Melvin Manhoef was neat.

6469
02:48:40,631 --> 02:48:42,160
I mean you know what I'm saying

6470
02:48:42,280 --> 02:48:43,660
and and exactly.

6471
02:48:43,840 --> 02:48:44,380
You know what I'm saying?

6472
02:48:44,380 --> 02:48:46,900
I'm just saying I've seen horse
nut shots where guys are like,

6473
02:48:46,901 --> 02:48:47,621
Damn Bro.

6474
02:48:47,621 --> 02:48:48,454
I'm like hold up,

6475
02:48:48,550 --> 02:48:49,930
hold up five minutes.

6476
02:48:49,960 --> 02:48:52,270
He's 52 50 those nuts hang low.

6477
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:53,230
Might've been real bad.

6478
02:48:54,130 --> 02:48:57,670
I'm not saying actually I'm under the cup.

6479
02:48:59,400 --> 02:49:00,560
They were hanging on the outside

6480
02:49:03,470 --> 02:49:07,180
the ball and there's a five second delay.

6481
02:49:07,200 --> 02:49:07,680
Really.

6482
02:49:07,680 --> 02:49:09,300
He's always is a way that was an odd,

6483
02:49:09,330 --> 02:49:09,481
no,

6484
02:49:09,481 --> 02:49:10,770
that's not odd.

6485
02:49:10,771 --> 02:49:11,690
But if you don't think that was on,

6486
02:49:11,691 --> 02:49:12,540
I believe you guys,

6487
02:49:12,541 --> 02:49:15,240
you guys are the second why
is the delay is automatic.

6488
02:49:15,241 --> 02:49:15,631
Yeah.

6489
02:49:15,631 --> 02:49:16,261
Why is that?

6490
02:49:16,261 --> 02:49:16,980
I don't know.

6491
02:49:16,980 --> 02:49:18,960
The brains and the main,

6492
02:49:19,170 --> 02:49:21,150
when a guy gets hit in the
balls and there's a break,

6493
02:49:21,180 --> 02:49:23,160
it's the hit in the
balls and he goes boom.

6494
02:49:23,310 --> 02:49:25,470
In the break there's
never a hit in the balls.

6495
02:49:28,060 --> 02:49:28,893
You know what I'm saying?

6496
02:49:30,200 --> 02:49:32,940
Watch it again to see that in
heaven when you watch it again.

6497
02:49:32,941 --> 02:49:34,290
Let's take a look at it
again cause this is kind of,

6498
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:36,600
it's kind of a crazy delay as long.

6499
02:49:36,780 --> 02:49:37,021
Yeah.

6500
02:49:37,021 --> 02:49:38,100
We never see that you,

6501
02:49:38,110 --> 02:49:38,920
you get hit in the balls.

6502
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:39,250
The guy goes,

6503
02:49:39,250 --> 02:49:39,990
okay,

6504
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:41,100
Eddie has good point.

6505
02:49:41,101 --> 02:49:43,050
We never seen a 50 year
old get hit in the nuts.

6506
02:49:43,051 --> 02:49:44,760
Boom and they're exchanging

6507
02:49:46,370 --> 02:49:46,901
and hoists hit.

6508
02:49:46,901 --> 02:49:48,000
I'm good on the Chin though.

6509
02:49:48,030 --> 02:49:50,130
The one that Shannon
was good to take downs.

6510
02:49:50,131 --> 02:49:51,780
Good Hammer fist is good.

6511
02:49:51,810 --> 02:49:52,291
Oh wait a minute.

6512
02:49:52,291 --> 02:49:53,130
Now from that angle.

6513
02:49:53,160 --> 02:49:55,110
Maybe he was hoping his calls this.

6514
02:49:55,140 --> 02:49:55,700
He was definitely,

6515
02:49:55,700 --> 02:49:56,910
he was holding his ball,

6516
02:49:56,911 --> 02:50:00,360
but that's a legit knocked down
and the need of the faces legit.

6517
02:50:00,570 --> 02:50:01,381
The knee is before.

6518
02:50:01,381 --> 02:50:01,531
See,

6519
02:50:01,531 --> 02:50:02,480
this is what you're talking about.

6520
02:50:02,490 --> 02:50:04,440
This seems kind of acted out.

6521
02:50:04,441 --> 02:50:05,274
Wait a minute,

6522
02:50:05,640 --> 02:50:06,570
Paul shine,

6523
02:50:07,440 --> 02:50:08,790
but watch this right to the chin.

6524
02:50:08,791 --> 02:50:09,990
Watch how long it takes.

6525
02:50:10,170 --> 02:50:10,440
Okay,

6526
02:50:10,440 --> 02:50:11,390
we need to see the whole thing.

6527
02:50:11,410 --> 02:50:12,560
Show the need of the chin.

6528
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:14,850
He did take them down.

6529
02:50:14,851 --> 02:50:17,640
Now that I see it did look like he
was complaining about the balls.

6530
02:50:17,700 --> 02:50:19,650
Once the fight got to the ground.

6531
02:50:19,651 --> 02:50:20,610
Go way back Jamie.

6532
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:21,540
I'm starting to look.

6533
02:50:21,910 --> 02:50:22,591
It's going to be over.

6534
02:50:22,591 --> 02:50:23,580
You're going to try and sell it.

6535
02:50:23,610 --> 02:50:24,390
Watch it here.

6536
02:50:24,390 --> 02:50:25,223
Watching her.

6537
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:26,670
But why would he think it was over?

6538
02:50:26,671 --> 02:50:27,630
Just cause it got taken down here.

6539
02:50:27,631 --> 02:50:28,590
We're going to watch the whole fight.

6540
02:50:28,650 --> 02:50:29,483
Here it goes.

6541
02:50:31,320 --> 02:50:31,531
Okay,

6542
02:50:31,531 --> 02:50:32,910
where's the ball shot?

6543
02:50:33,090 --> 02:50:33,923
Right there.

6544
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:34,980
Boom.

6545
02:50:34,980 --> 02:50:35,490
That was it.

6546
02:50:35,490 --> 02:50:36,150
That was it.

6547
02:50:36,150 --> 02:50:38,850
And they have long balls and
that's the one on the chin.

6548
02:50:39,320 --> 02:50:40,890
The right knee holding
his balls as he hurt.

6549
02:50:40,891 --> 02:50:41,490
Right.

6550
02:50:41,490 --> 02:50:43,440
He's holding his well from the face shot.

6551
02:50:43,710 --> 02:50:43,861
Well,

6552
02:50:43,861 --> 02:50:48,861
he definitely got dropped face
hitting the depth of nuts and face,

6553
02:50:49,350 --> 02:50:51,000
but he did yell and say,

6554
02:50:51,001 --> 02:50:51,990
you hit me in the balls.

6555
02:50:52,020 --> 02:50:53,160
There should be a rematch then.

6556
02:50:53,790 --> 02:50:54,421
Oh No,

6557
02:50:54,421 --> 02:50:54,980
we got to it.

6558
02:50:54,980 --> 02:50:59,700
I like sad and Kimball enough controversy
in this to have an immediate rematch.

6559
02:51:00,330 --> 02:51:04,500
Let's run it back a go fund me this for
everybody donates a dollar to make sure

6560
02:51:04,890 --> 02:51:05,910
we're never does this again.

6561
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:09,060
I'll text rates show tonight after this.

6562
02:51:09,510 --> 02:51:10,620
And Ken was a he.

6563
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:15,790
He sort of recovered his composure
against 50 year olds fighting you.

6564
02:51:16,441 --> 02:51:17,790
You guys have something against that.

6565
02:51:17,970 --> 02:51:18,803
What's wrong with it?

6566
02:51:20,520 --> 02:51:22,600
As long as they're both 50 I
don't have a problem with it.

6567
02:51:23,570 --> 02:51:27,360
I don't enjoy it the same age where you
know you're not dealing with 55 year

6568
02:51:27,361 --> 02:51:28,021
olds out there,

6569
02:51:28,021 --> 02:51:28,600
but yeah,

6570
02:51:28,600 --> 02:51:30,240
but 55 was the shit.

6571
02:51:30,241 --> 02:51:30,890
I'm not watching.

6572
02:51:30,890 --> 02:51:33,240
I want to see Chuck Norris
at 55 fight and rumble.

6573
02:51:34,310 --> 02:51:34,831
You know what I'm saying?

6574
02:51:34,831 --> 02:51:36,300
I don't see 55 year olds fight,

6575
02:51:36,301 --> 02:51:37,134
man.

6576
02:51:37,350 --> 02:51:39,210
I'm not going to go up a t and why not?

6577
02:51:39,211 --> 02:51:40,044
It's very reasonable.

6578
02:51:40,440 --> 02:51:41,273
Very reasonable.

6579
02:51:41,310 --> 02:51:42,450
Especially true legends.

6580
02:51:42,451 --> 02:51:43,950
I can remember him as the legends.

6581
02:51:43,980 --> 02:51:45,570
I don't like seeing six
year old fights either.

6582
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:46,111
No,

6583
02:51:46,111 --> 02:51:46,501
me neither,

6584
02:51:46,501 --> 02:51:46,710
bro.

6585
02:51:46,710 --> 02:51:47,543
What am I doing?

6586
02:51:48,100 --> 02:51:49,560
Taekwondo Kid's head kicking each other.

6587
02:51:49,561 --> 02:51:51,120
I don't see that that counts.

6588
02:51:51,930 --> 02:51:52,770
I don't let my,

6589
02:51:52,771 --> 02:51:54,170
I run a kids program at a Yamas.

6590
02:51:54,300 --> 02:51:54,660
Yeah.

6591
02:51:54,660 --> 02:51:59,510
I don't let them spark like I don't want
to see Larry Bird's part of the body to

6592
02:51:59,520 --> 02:52:00,060
the body.

6593
02:52:00,060 --> 02:52:02,530
Kind of touch out of that and play
like Taika is and was touched.

6594
02:52:03,780 --> 02:52:04,710
But Tyrone Woodley.

6595
02:52:04,720 --> 02:52:05,800
What a strong beard game.

6596
02:52:06,490 --> 02:52:08,000
No respect for that bit again.

6597
02:52:08,650 --> 02:52:09,310
Oregon's,

6598
02:52:09,310 --> 02:52:10,210
he's in a weird spot,

6599
02:52:10,211 --> 02:52:10,660
Huh?

6600
02:52:10,660 --> 02:52:11,930
What lives in a weird spot in the know?

6601
02:52:11,940 --> 02:52:13,930
He deserves a title shot sort of,

6602
02:52:13,931 --> 02:52:15,460
but no one wants to out shined him.

6603
02:52:15,610 --> 02:52:16,241
Oh my God.

6604
02:52:16,241 --> 02:52:16,750
Daily.

6605
02:52:16,750 --> 02:52:19,780
So now everyone's demand in one
or boy and the way the UFC works.

6606
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:20,141
Yeah,

6607
02:52:20,141 --> 02:52:22,960
but I think weirdly still in
the title shot is he will,

6608
02:52:22,961 --> 02:52:24,100
if it's going to go Rory,

6609
02:52:24,101 --> 02:52:25,270
and it might not,

6610
02:52:25,540 --> 02:52:26,351
I'm not saying it is,

6611
02:52:26,351 --> 02:52:28,430
but let's say they do Rory first.

6612
02:52:28,440 --> 02:52:30,640
Wonderboy Woodley would
have to get the title shot.

6613
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:31,510
Yes.

6614
02:52:31,510 --> 02:52:32,350
Or Don.

6615
02:52:32,351 --> 02:52:32,560
Don.

6616
02:52:32,560 --> 02:52:33,040
Don Don.

6617
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:37,720
Don Connor wins quick against
Osan Joseph and says Robby.

6618
02:52:37,721 --> 02:52:38,554
Laura,

6619
02:52:39,070 --> 02:52:40,810
if could any fucking Pete trumps

6620
02:52:43,850 --> 02:52:46,180
trumps then that's the fight.

6621
02:52:46,630 --> 02:52:48,130
We're all fucked because that's the fight.

6622
02:52:48,131 --> 02:52:48,861
If he beats though,

6623
02:52:48,861 --> 02:52:51,970
Sign Joseph challenges
lower th the world ends.

6624
02:52:52,150 --> 02:52:52,660
Yeah.

6625
02:52:52,660 --> 02:52:53,860
No one watches anything.

6626
02:52:53,890 --> 02:52:54,850
Everything goes down.

6627
02:52:55,030 --> 02:52:57,850
Every show on television says we're
just going to take the night off.

6628
02:52:59,300 --> 02:53:01,180
There's no need for
anything other than this.

6629
02:53:01,181 --> 02:53:05,560
And we would throw some children's shows
on Nickelodeon and have to have it on

6630
02:53:05,561 --> 02:53:06,394
the moon.

6631
02:53:08,080 --> 02:53:08,913
Richard Branson,

6632
02:53:09,620 --> 02:53:10,453
motherfuckers,

6633
02:53:11,470 --> 02:53:12,101
every channel,

6634
02:53:12,101 --> 02:53:13,840
whenever he runs on Gilligan's island,

6635
02:53:14,170 --> 02:53:14,700
if he,

6636
02:53:14,700 --> 02:53:15,070
if so,

6637
02:53:15,070 --> 02:53:18,430
if he beat Dos Anjos and then he beats
Robbie Lawler's either greatest fighter

6638
02:53:18,431 --> 02:53:19,264
of all time.

6639
02:53:20,320 --> 02:53:22,780
If he beats those [inaudible] he's in
the running to be the greatest hour.

6640
02:53:22,790 --> 02:53:24,010
Of course he's in the running,

6641
02:53:24,580 --> 02:53:25,413
you know,

6642
02:53:25,540 --> 02:53:25,900
look,

6643
02:53:25,900 --> 02:53:26,890
I say the greatest ever.

6644
02:53:26,891 --> 02:53:27,970
A little bit too liberally.

6645
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:28,211
I'll,

6646
02:53:28,211 --> 02:53:28,510
I'll,

6647
02:53:28,510 --> 02:53:29,320
I'll be honest.

6648
02:53:29,320 --> 02:53:30,153
I know I do,

6649
02:53:30,190 --> 02:53:35,190
but it's tough to find a guy who's
even close to as exciting in what he's

6650
02:53:35,321 --> 02:53:36,550
attempting to accomplishment.

6651
02:53:36,760 --> 02:53:37,870
[inaudible] attempt to accomplish.

6652
02:53:37,871 --> 02:53:41,830
It's easy when you go back like
after the dust has settled and say,

6653
02:53:41,831 --> 02:53:42,610
wow,

6654
02:53:42,610 --> 02:53:42,911
you know,

6655
02:53:42,911 --> 02:53:45,520
you gotta look at Fader or like
fate or was the greatest ever?

6656
02:53:46,030 --> 02:53:46,780
Yes.

6657
02:53:46,780 --> 02:53:50,140
He was one of the greatest
ever at that time for sure.

6658
02:53:50,260 --> 02:53:52,150
I think Anderson move,

6659
02:53:52,170 --> 02:53:54,200
if I look at like movements
and what he's doing,

6660
02:53:54,230 --> 02:53:57,760
I think I kind of give the edge to
Anderson but I can see the argument.

6661
02:53:58,150 --> 02:54:01,240
But if Connor can beat dos
Anjos and he's starches him,

6662
02:54:01,720 --> 02:54:02,920
I don't see any argument,

6663
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:06,340
especially where the level
of the games since ever been,

6664
02:54:06,370 --> 02:54:10,060
especially since we have already seen
fate or go down and get knocked the fuck

6665
02:54:10,061 --> 02:54:10,601
out a few times.

6666
02:54:10,601 --> 02:54:11,434
Same.

6667
02:54:11,840 --> 02:54:12,461
They've been gone.

6668
02:54:12,461 --> 02:54:13,630
We've already seen them go down.

6669
02:54:13,631 --> 02:54:14,800
We haven't seen Conor go down,

6670
02:54:14,801 --> 02:54:17,080
so you got to give the
edge to Connor so far.

6671
02:54:17,110 --> 02:54:17,681
Sort of.

6672
02:54:17,681 --> 02:54:20,920
But we haven't seen Conor fight the
kind of guys that fade or fought in its

6673
02:54:20,921 --> 02:54:21,580
prime,

6674
02:54:21,580 --> 02:54:22,570
walked down cro,

6675
02:54:22,571 --> 02:54:22,961
cop,

6676
02:54:22,961 --> 02:54:23,770
remember that?

6677
02:54:23,770 --> 02:54:26,260
You know the random in one of
the random one dimensional guy,

6678
02:54:26,480 --> 02:54:29,830
a lot of one dimensional guy that's common
is fighting dub trust of the best and

6679
02:54:29,831 --> 02:54:30,880
they're all good at everything.

6680
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:32,260
It was just five months.

6681
02:54:32,290 --> 02:54:33,490
It was just a different time.

6682
02:54:34,540 --> 02:54:35,500
It's just not their fault.

6683
02:54:35,501 --> 02:54:37,930
I'm just saying if Connor
were to win three belts,

6684
02:54:37,931 --> 02:54:39,610
he's by far the best hands down

6685
02:54:41,440 --> 02:54:44,110
Mackenzie dern versus
Paige vanzant right there.

6686
02:54:45,010 --> 02:54:48,700
It's a guy who really didn't believe
we're looking at Cody Garbrandt and what's

6687
02:54:48,701 --> 02:54:49,100
the guy's name?

6688
02:54:49,100 --> 02:54:49,933
Tacchino.

6689
02:54:50,160 --> 02:54:50,261
Oh,

6690
02:54:50,261 --> 02:54:51,280
Gusto Mendez.

6691
02:54:51,310 --> 02:54:56,310
He's just doesn't have the stand up to
stand with a vicious nasty boxer for a

6692
02:54:56,681 --> 02:54:57,251
long time.

6693
02:54:57,251 --> 02:54:57,590
Yeah.

6694
02:54:57,590 --> 02:54:57,940
Garb.

6695
02:54:57,940 --> 02:54:58,773
Ranking crack.

6696
02:54:58,830 --> 02:54:59,140
Yes.

6697
02:54:59,140 --> 02:55:00,520
He's got really good timing.

6698
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:01,061
He's,

6699
02:55:01,061 --> 02:55:03,010
he's real confident with
his striking and he's just,

6700
02:55:03,020 --> 02:55:03,820
he just outshone.

6701
02:55:03,820 --> 02:55:05,740
What do you guys think
of Anderson Silva Bisbee.

6702
02:55:05,810 --> 02:55:06,650
Is that next week?

6703
02:55:06,680 --> 02:55:07,280
Yup.

6704
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:08,030
Who's in town?

6705
02:55:08,030 --> 02:55:08,751
I'm out of town,

6706
02:55:08,751 --> 02:55:09,720
unfortunately son.

6707
02:55:10,580 --> 02:55:11,413
I'll be here.

6708
02:55:11,530 --> 02:55:12,680
How dare you have another.

6709
02:55:12,681 --> 02:55:13,770
So wish I didn't,

6710
02:55:13,820 --> 02:55:14,653
what day is that?

6711
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:15,380
Saturday.

6712
02:55:15,380 --> 02:55:15,860
Yeah.

6713
02:55:15,860 --> 02:55:19,400
That's an interesting fight though at
this point and Anderson's life because

6714
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:20,920
he's a happen though.

6715
02:55:21,210 --> 02:55:25,010
It depends what Anderson campaigns on
how much Bisbing can get in his head.

6716
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:27,350
Bisbing talks mad shit.

6717
02:55:27,560 --> 02:55:29,590
He's already been mocking
them about my background.

6718
02:55:30,250 --> 02:55:31,083
I don't know.

6719
02:55:31,130 --> 02:55:31,341
Look,

6720
02:55:31,341 --> 02:55:33,410
you understand that a hard time
pulling the trigger against Nick Diaz.

6721
02:55:33,470 --> 02:55:34,520
I think Bisbing beats him.

6722
02:55:34,740 --> 02:55:35,810
Do even a decision.

6723
02:55:36,080 --> 02:55:36,650
Wow.

6724
02:55:36,650 --> 02:55:39,890
And he started crying after he broke
down crying after and then with all this

6725
02:55:39,891 --> 02:55:40,790
shit that's gone on,

6726
02:55:40,791 --> 02:55:41,450
I mean you're the,

6727
02:55:41,450 --> 02:55:43,430
you know what the x factors here.

6728
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:48,490
Fucking Brisbane's left eye and against
South Palsy gets fucking kicks his right

6729
02:55:48,491 --> 02:55:48,591
eye.

6730
02:55:48,591 --> 02:55:49,101
It's just right.

6731
02:55:49,101 --> 02:55:49,550
I'm sorry.

6732
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:52,330
And get South Palsy eats fucking
left kicks in the left hand.

6733
02:55:52,350 --> 02:55:52,790
It could.

6734
02:55:52,790 --> 02:55:55,050
That could be a factor for sure factor.

6735
02:55:55,070 --> 02:55:57,050
You know another factor it
could be is fighting in England.

6736
02:55:57,710 --> 02:55:58,750
He's never lost an English.

6737
02:55:58,760 --> 02:55:59,930
So he's an animal in England.

6738
02:55:59,931 --> 02:56:01,370
They fucking little love him.

6739
02:56:01,550 --> 02:56:03,410
There's very few places where he goes,

6740
02:56:03,411 --> 02:56:04,880
where he gets that kind of rhino applause.

6741
02:56:05,090 --> 02:56:05,911
When he goes to America,

6742
02:56:05,911 --> 02:56:07,160
he gets booed all time.

6743
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:08,030
You know Pete,

6744
02:56:08,030 --> 02:56:09,000
don't give him a hard time.

6745
02:56:09,410 --> 02:56:09,681
No.

6746
02:56:09,681 --> 02:56:10,550
But in England,

6747
02:56:10,551 --> 02:56:10,821
man,

6748
02:56:10,821 --> 02:56:11,061
I've,

6749
02:56:11,061 --> 02:56:13,070
I've called his fights in Manchester.

6750
02:56:13,070 --> 02:56:15,230
Whole leash shit to shit.

6751
02:56:15,231 --> 02:56:16,070
When he gets out there,

6752
02:56:16,080 --> 02:56:16,280
man,

6753
02:56:16,280 --> 02:56:17,930
they go fucking bananas.

6754
02:56:17,960 --> 02:56:19,660
It's a good fight on bond.

6755
02:56:19,830 --> 02:56:22,310
Man knows the law and he's like,

6756
02:56:22,311 --> 02:56:26,630
you gotta give that guy his props
because my big bang is fucking,

6757
02:56:26,960 --> 02:56:28,580
he is lasting dude.

6758
02:56:28,581 --> 02:56:30,320
He's fought everybody.

6759
02:56:30,321 --> 02:56:31,820
He's only lost a few guys.

6760
02:56:32,510 --> 02:56:34,420
Most are p and he's like,

6761
02:56:34,550 --> 02:56:36,050
he doesn't lose his enthusiasm.

6762
02:56:36,210 --> 02:56:37,610
It keeps getting better and better.

6763
02:56:37,820 --> 02:56:38,690
Little by little,

6764
02:56:38,691 --> 02:56:39,950
each fight and his,

6765
02:56:40,010 --> 02:56:41,360
his mental toughness.

6766
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:42,433
Unbelievable.

6767
02:56:42,680 --> 02:56:44,240
I've never trained with
a new one like him.

6768
02:56:44,750 --> 02:56:45,411
When he fights,

6769
02:56:45,411 --> 02:56:47,580
he says the bathroom away way.

6770
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:48,740
When he drills,

6771
02:56:48,770 --> 02:56:50,690
he's going full speed drilling.

6772
02:56:50,720 --> 02:56:50,991
Boom.

6773
02:56:50,991 --> 02:56:51,651
Just nonstop,

6774
02:56:51,651 --> 02:56:52,910
not moving nonstop.

6775
02:56:53,030 --> 02:56:53,651
Crazy card.

6776
02:56:53,651 --> 02:56:54,150
It's red.

6777
02:56:54,150 --> 02:56:55,190
His cardio is resting.

6778
02:56:55,191 --> 02:56:56,830
Heart rate's 34 beats a minute too.

6779
02:56:56,900 --> 02:56:57,830
He's like a hummingbird.

6780
02:56:57,831 --> 02:57:00,050
I've never seen anything like
incredible wearing guys out.

6781
02:57:00,051 --> 02:57:01,280
Just just grilling.

6782
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:05,420
So what do you think it is that it kept
him from beating like all the best guys?

6783
02:57:05,990 --> 02:57:07,150
There's just something this,

6784
02:57:07,170 --> 02:57:08,270
that it factor.

6785
02:57:08,300 --> 02:57:09,110
He got,

6786
02:57:09,110 --> 02:57:10,580
you don't have any knockout power.

6787
02:57:10,730 --> 02:57:11,780
He's good at everything,

6788
02:57:11,781 --> 02:57:14,390
but he's not great road
told me he hits hard.

6789
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:16,940
He said he holds the pad for me cause I
all anybody to tell you this guy doesn't

6790
02:57:16,941 --> 02:57:17,370
hit hard.

6791
02:57:17,370 --> 02:57:20,660
That's his coach said that
they stopped the fight.

6792
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:21,530
They based it off.

6793
02:57:21,530 --> 02:57:23,330
Well yeah the guys he stopped.

6794
02:57:23,331 --> 02:57:28,331
He stopped like Lee from like a barrage
of suddenly stopped a fucking Jorge

6795
02:57:29,120 --> 02:57:29,290
Rivera.

6796
02:57:29,290 --> 02:57:30,123
Jorge,

6797
02:57:30,780 --> 02:57:34,010
you're talking about like
Miller striped tail power?

6798
02:57:34,100 --> 02:57:34,610
No,

6799
02:57:34,610 --> 02:57:35,030
no.

6800
02:57:35,030 --> 02:57:35,960
It's just not,

6801
02:57:36,020 --> 02:57:36,920
there's just something there.

6802
02:57:36,950 --> 02:57:37,970
Not that kind of fighter.

6803
02:57:38,240 --> 02:57:41,720
Different kinds of great
meant middleweight domains
don't want to fight that

6804
02:57:41,721 --> 02:57:41,871
guy.

6805
02:57:41,871 --> 02:57:42,950
He's the best.

6806
02:57:42,951 --> 02:57:44,030
He's lost some of the best.

6807
02:57:44,060 --> 02:57:47,400
He's an animal as one of the reasons why
it was so impressively Rockhold handled

6808
02:57:47,401 --> 02:57:47,630
them.

6809
02:57:47,630 --> 02:57:48,463
Ooh Jeez.

6810
02:57:50,060 --> 02:57:52,470
One arm GTN ever in the UFC.

6811
02:57:52,480 --> 02:57:54,890
I think what set it up that huge,

6812
02:57:54,920 --> 02:57:55,520
that head kick.

6813
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:59,510
It's well that his left side is very
powerful and it's so long that you have to

6814
02:57:59,511 --> 02:58:02,130
kind of stay in his kicking
range in order to try to close

6815
02:58:02,130 --> 02:58:02,590
the distance,

6816
02:58:02,590 --> 02:58:05,880
get to punching range and
that left kick is so powerful.

6817
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:09,420
You want to hold that you all pads for
Rockhold when he's throwing that left

6818
02:58:09,421 --> 02:58:09,810
kick.

6819
02:58:09,810 --> 02:58:10,411
If I'm answering.

6820
02:58:10,411 --> 02:58:10,841
Sorry.

6821
02:58:10,841 --> 02:58:11,181
Oh Man.

6822
02:58:11,181 --> 02:58:14,350
That's what I'm South Pole and
I'm fucking attacking that ride.

6823
02:58:14,380 --> 02:58:17,820
I talked to Javier Mendez about
holding pads for Rockhold.

6824
02:58:18,660 --> 02:58:19,141
Oh my God.

6825
02:58:19,141 --> 02:58:21,000
You were see videos of
him kicking the pads.

6826
02:58:21,380 --> 02:58:22,820
He's terrifying his,

6827
02:58:22,821 --> 02:58:26,280
it was giving you a fine Luke
lukewarm kicking the type ads to it.

6828
02:58:26,281 --> 02:58:26,451
He,

6829
02:58:26,451 --> 02:58:29,520
he has so much length and torque.

6830
02:58:29,760 --> 02:58:30,121
You know,

6831
02:58:30,121 --> 02:58:32,670
like I think the scariest guy
I ever saw kicked the pads.

6832
02:58:32,671 --> 02:58:34,530
His manhood man to this day.

6833
02:58:34,531 --> 02:58:35,370
Is that a curious guy?

6834
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:36,840
Well,

6835
02:58:36,840 --> 02:58:37,890
Pedro Huizar hits back.

6836
02:58:38,010 --> 02:58:39,210
I've seen him hit a bag really hard,

6837
02:58:39,211 --> 02:58:40,440
but man who is way faster,

6838
02:58:40,441 --> 02:58:41,191
more explosive,

6839
02:58:41,191 --> 02:58:41,791
but like,

6840
02:58:41,791 --> 02:58:43,100
why would you check Rockwell down?

6841
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:43,953
Give me some volume,

6842
02:58:46,060 --> 02:58:48,550
fucking power in that leg.

6843
02:58:48,550 --> 02:58:49,383
So

6844
02:58:51,430 --> 02:58:52,390
he walks you down,

6845
02:58:52,391 --> 02:58:54,700
slams that fucking thing
and over and over again.

6846
02:58:56,130 --> 02:58:56,651
Third Man,

6847
02:58:56,651 --> 02:58:57,940
he kicks very hard.

6848
02:58:58,000 --> 02:58:58,751
I got the watch,

6849
02:58:58,751 --> 02:58:59,584
Pedro,

6850
02:58:59,620 --> 02:59:01,090
Peter [inaudible] and Marco,

6851
02:59:01,091 --> 02:59:02,300
who was Jesus.

6852
02:59:02,340 --> 02:59:03,660
What does that Rockwell at the Mayweather.

6853
02:59:03,670 --> 02:59:04,181
Jim Next,

6854
02:59:04,181 --> 02:59:05,980
is that what that said and put that up.

6855
02:59:06,010 --> 02:59:06,580
Let me see that.

6856
02:59:06,580 --> 02:59:07,030
And Mark Goes,

6857
02:59:07,030 --> 02:59:10,870
Jim and the gun and the Gal fucking
over a decade ago and just seeing these

6858
02:59:10,871 --> 02:59:11,561
fucking monsters.

6859
02:59:11,561 --> 02:59:12,221
I was like a little kid.

6860
02:59:12,221 --> 02:59:13,960
They were just geniuses.

6861
02:59:14,230 --> 02:59:18,250
How genius is the viral aspect of these
youtube videos where one will show you

6862
02:59:18,251 --> 02:59:20,140
the next one in like
the little play thing.

6863
02:59:20,141 --> 02:59:20,980
Like it starts spinning.

6864
02:59:20,981 --> 02:59:21,221
Like,

6865
02:59:21,221 --> 02:59:22,120
why don't you stick around?

6866
02:59:23,010 --> 02:59:23,843
Cool.

6867
02:59:24,190 --> 02:59:25,023
Check this out.

6868
02:59:25,150 --> 02:59:26,470
They have it queued up for you.

6869
02:59:26,471 --> 02:59:27,190
It's brilliant.

6870
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:30,220
Rules rock all this fighting
with a barefoot here.

6871
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:31,690
Smart.

6872
02:59:31,690 --> 02:59:32,900
Do you ever go and number two we just had,

6873
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:33,790
I don't have nothing to watch,

6874
02:59:33,791 --> 02:59:35,380
but I'm gonna go on
Youtube and find something.

6875
02:59:35,380 --> 02:59:35,920
Do you ever do that?

6876
02:59:35,920 --> 02:59:37,570
He said there's just fucking time.

6877
02:59:37,780 --> 02:59:38,920
He's in Mayweather's gym.

6878
02:59:38,950 --> 02:59:40,240
I go with their suggestions.

6879
02:59:40,241 --> 02:59:43,630
I go to my homepage and they have all the
shits suggested and unluck let's watch

6880
02:59:43,631 --> 02:59:44,464
some of the shit.

6881
02:59:45,370 --> 02:59:46,240
Very entertaining.

6882
02:59:46,510 --> 02:59:48,480
Rockhold showing some
fairly decent boxing.

6883
02:59:48,670 --> 02:59:49,330
Oh,

6884
02:59:49,330 --> 02:59:52,300
those guys get so much power out of their
shoes to their shoes are so flat and

6885
02:59:52,301 --> 02:59:53,134
strong crib.

6886
02:59:53,250 --> 02:59:53,800
Yeah,

6887
02:59:53,800 --> 02:59:54,700
it definitely helps.

6888
02:59:54,730 --> 02:59:59,620
It's not smart to go with shoes all at
ou because I don't ever want to go with

6889
02:59:59,621 --> 03:00:00,311
what you got to fight.

6890
03:00:00,311 --> 03:00:00,850
You've got to go.

6891
03:00:00,850 --> 03:00:01,160
I agree.

6892
03:00:01,160 --> 03:00:03,220
Same thing cause side
control with wrestling shoes,

6893
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:05,110
man.

6894
03:00:05,110 --> 03:00:07,780
My dry weight,

6895
03:00:07,781 --> 03:00:09,010
500 pounds on a guy.

6896
03:00:09,160 --> 03:00:09,971
You take the shoes off.

6897
03:00:09,971 --> 03:00:10,720
It's a little different.

6898
03:00:10,720 --> 03:00:12,370
That's why I was asking
that pressure's gone.

6899
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:16,570
Josh Barnett Fart Huron and showed
up with those wrestling shoes.

6900
03:00:16,750 --> 03:00:19,010
Tights and demonstrate same thing.

6901
03:00:19,120 --> 03:00:21,290
There's always a cons till
you can get caught up.

6902
03:00:21,740 --> 03:00:24,280
It's a lot easier to pull that foot out.

6903
03:00:24,340 --> 03:00:26,440
How gangster is he then that
he did it with Dean lister?

6904
03:00:27,070 --> 03:00:27,730
Yup.

6905
03:00:27,730 --> 03:00:28,060
Nope,

6906
03:00:28,060 --> 03:00:29,050
that's Barnett though.

6907
03:00:29,051 --> 03:00:29,471
He was like,

6908
03:00:29,471 --> 03:00:29,681
dude,

6909
03:00:29,681 --> 03:00:30,850
this is what got me to the party.

6910
03:00:30,851 --> 03:00:31,780
Check this shit out.

6911
03:00:31,900 --> 03:00:32,770
Submitted both of them.

6912
03:00:32,771 --> 03:00:33,191
Not only that,

6913
03:00:33,191 --> 03:00:34,870
he's dressing like an old carny wrestler.

6914
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:37,233
He had like old

6915
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:39,760
rustling,

6916
03:00:39,760 --> 03:00:40,600
not even a speedo.

6917
03:00:40,601 --> 03:00:42,820
He had like a high waisted single.

6918
03:00:43,480 --> 03:00:44,313
He's single hand.

6919
03:00:44,320 --> 03:00:45,153
Can you believe?

6920
03:00:45,880 --> 03:00:47,710
Can you believe he got
submitted by Rothwell?

6921
03:00:47,740 --> 03:00:49,130
I'm going to to get get submitted.

6922
03:00:49,300 --> 03:00:51,810
It doesn't mean it doesn't
diminish him at all.

6923
03:00:53,410 --> 03:00:54,940
That's one of the best of all time.

6924
03:00:54,941 --> 03:00:55,631
I love that guy.

6925
03:00:55,631 --> 03:00:56,750
Especially submission artists.

6926
03:00:57,490 --> 03:00:57,971
I can't remember.

6927
03:00:57,971 --> 03:00:58,310
Right.

6928
03:00:58,310 --> 03:00:59,740
I don't remember shot in,

6929
03:00:59,800 --> 03:00:59,980
I don't

6930
03:00:59,980 --> 03:01:01,870
remember exactly what the transition was,

6931
03:01:01,871 --> 03:01:04,300
but that is apparently Rothwell's shit.

6932
03:01:04,360 --> 03:01:04,660
Yeah.

6933
03:01:04,660 --> 03:01:07,870
If Rothwell gets a hold of your neck
from that 10 finger gay teen position,

6934
03:01:07,871 --> 03:01:11,140
he just tucks that bitch and tight
and chokes the fuck out of you.

6935
03:01:11,350 --> 03:01:13,080
I'm saying if you gave
me a hundred justice,

6936
03:01:13,400 --> 03:01:14,920
Wilson minimum would not be in the,

6937
03:01:14,980 --> 03:01:15,820
I would say the same.

6938
03:01:15,970 --> 03:01:17,140
Do you know the grip is using?

6939
03:01:17,141 --> 03:01:18,000
What does the grippy sees?

6940
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:18,590
I don't know.

6941
03:01:18,590 --> 03:01:19,240
It didn't.

6942
03:01:19,240 --> 03:01:21,220
And you have him and you
just have to get a sense.

6943
03:01:21,260 --> 03:01:22,093
It's underlined.

6944
03:01:24,270 --> 03:01:24,610
Yeah.

6945
03:01:24,610 --> 03:01:24,971
Is He,

6946
03:01:24,971 --> 03:01:25,450
um,

6947
03:01:25,450 --> 03:01:26,830
he's calling it a Gogo choke.

6948
03:01:26,831 --> 03:01:27,101
Right?

6949
03:01:27,101 --> 03:01:30,760
So what that means to me is that he's
sticking something in your neck because

6950
03:01:30,761 --> 03:01:33,070
he's doing it like a Google Plata
where it goes like into your,

6951
03:01:33,170 --> 03:01:34,003
your wind pipe.

6952
03:01:34,060 --> 03:01:37,320
So I'm thinking he's holding his knock
holes in some way that he's driving and

6953
03:01:37,340 --> 03:01:40,240
not to whoever goes to the side with it.

6954
03:01:40,270 --> 03:01:41,680
He's wanting to Hickson's black belts.

6955
03:01:41,980 --> 03:01:43,480
They called Hixon up the night before.

6956
03:01:43,481 --> 03:01:45,800
Apparently told crones or like really?

6957
03:01:46,300 --> 03:01:46,841
Oh daisy,

6958
03:01:46,841 --> 03:01:47,370
really?

6959
03:01:47,370 --> 03:01:51,790
Crohn's has crazy guillotines but this
is not exactly like guilty and it's like

6960
03:01:51,791 --> 03:01:53,500
a form of a gal at
something like the form,

6961
03:01:53,501 --> 03:01:55,490
but it's fucking know
what they're saying is.

6962
03:01:55,500 --> 03:01:55,820
Yeah,

6963
03:01:55,820 --> 03:01:56,471
the fits.

6964
03:01:56,471 --> 03:01:57,430
The knuckles are here.

6965
03:01:57,431 --> 03:01:58,360
You can kind of see it.

6966
03:01:58,570 --> 03:02:03,040
The knuckles are going deep into the
neck as opposed to the regular gay team

6967
03:02:03,041 --> 03:02:06,220
where you're cutting off the windpipe
or cutting off rather the blood on the

6968
03:02:06,580 --> 03:02:07,870
[inaudible] same thing.

6969
03:02:07,960 --> 03:02:10,720
Well I liked the trachea smash.

6970
03:02:10,870 --> 03:02:11,980
I like Roth Rollover.

6971
03:02:11,981 --> 03:02:12,970
Junior dos Santos.

6972
03:02:12,971 --> 03:02:14,140
I keep picking against them.

6973
03:02:14,141 --> 03:02:16,190
I got to stop that tracheal smashes.

6974
03:02:16,210 --> 03:02:17,043
Nasty

6975
03:02:18,380 --> 03:02:18,790
time.

6976
03:02:18,790 --> 03:02:19,301
So as soon as you,

6977
03:02:19,301 --> 03:02:20,560
if it's good or the tribe,

6978
03:02:20,940 --> 03:02:21,671
it's immediate.

6979
03:02:21,671 --> 03:02:23,110
You know it's got a nasty one of those.

6980
03:02:23,111 --> 03:02:24,070
Amal Easton,

6981
03:02:24,120 --> 03:02:25,590
he's nasty one of those.

6982
03:02:25,810 --> 03:02:26,643
Oh he was.

6983
03:02:26,820 --> 03:02:28,810
He demonstrated it on me,

6984
03:02:28,811 --> 03:02:29,051
man.

6985
03:02:29,051 --> 03:02:30,640
I couldn't tap quick enough.

6986
03:02:30,940 --> 03:02:31,773
It's one of those,

6987
03:02:32,880 --> 03:02:34,990
there's certain guys,

6988
03:02:34,991 --> 03:02:35,824
man,

6989
03:02:36,030 --> 03:02:37,960
I don't want your riot a strangle me,

6990
03:02:37,961 --> 03:02:40,540
but I would like to know
what's going on with that.

6991
03:02:40,660 --> 03:02:41,950
Cause he's one of those motherfuckers,

6992
03:02:41,970 --> 03:02:43,600
he and Benevidez is another one,

6993
03:02:44,050 --> 03:02:45,370
gets a hold of your neck man.

6994
03:02:45,480 --> 03:02:48,940
Remember when Benevidez fought Tim
Elliot and he had to tap with his feet?

6995
03:02:49,960 --> 03:02:50,793
Dude,

6996
03:02:50,980 --> 03:02:51,721
some shit,

6997
03:02:51,721 --> 03:02:54,040
son Benevidez has got some jokes,

6998
03:02:55,510 --> 03:02:56,860
he's got some skull.

6999
03:02:57,400 --> 03:03:00,310
There's a lot going on with that
and that a lot of in different ways,

7000
03:03:00,340 --> 03:03:00,600
you know,

7001
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:02,710
just because you're good at
one way doesn't mean they're
going to be good at it

7002
03:03:04,130 --> 03:03:04,963
this way.

7003
03:03:05,890 --> 03:03:07,250
He's big.

7004
03:03:07,290 --> 03:03:08,123
He as either,

7005
03:03:08,140 --> 03:03:11,090
I remember when I found them and
just like you're a giant gorilla,

7006
03:03:11,700 --> 03:03:12,570
ruin your a gorilla.

7007
03:03:12,571 --> 03:03:13,990
He's a gorilla gorilla.

7008
03:03:13,991 --> 03:03:15,920
He's allergic slugging.

7009
03:03:15,970 --> 03:03:16,930
You're sitting next to him.

7010
03:03:16,990 --> 03:03:17,823
Hey Buddy,

7011
03:03:19,210 --> 03:03:19,830
look at this.

7012
03:03:19,830 --> 03:03:23,710
Look at this picture of Benevidez
with like a almost like a mouth guard,

7013
03:03:23,740 --> 03:03:24,830
which I love that.

7014
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:25,440
That's what I,

7015
03:03:25,440 --> 03:03:28,600
that's the most nasty
can dive in a little bit.

7016
03:03:28,601 --> 03:03:29,830
And then on top of that,

7017
03:03:29,831 --> 03:03:34,190
he's just fucking [inaudible]
motion to tap with his feet.

7018
03:03:34,260 --> 03:03:35,710
Both hands trapped.

7019
03:03:35,950 --> 03:03:38,680
Can't even say tap cause
he's eating humiliating.

7020
03:03:38,681 --> 03:03:39,514
Some Oblique,

7021
03:03:39,740 --> 03:03:41,860
humiliating fashion you
got to have with your feet.

7022
03:03:42,440 --> 03:03:43,300
He was like,

7023
03:03:43,301 --> 03:03:44,650
he tapped so harbor this feeling.

7024
03:03:44,910 --> 03:03:48,410
It wasn't even like I've no
nothing to do that image.

7025
03:03:48,411 --> 03:03:48,790
Like,

7026
03:03:48,790 --> 03:03:49,750
Oh that guy knows what he's doing.

7027
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:55,570
No beginner and one of them professions
like nicest guys of all time,

7028
03:03:55,571 --> 03:03:58,580
fetus fuckers the salt of the earth.

7029
03:03:58,610 --> 03:03:59,660
He is an awesome,

7030
03:03:59,690 --> 03:04:00,471
oh is there a video?

7031
03:04:00,471 --> 03:04:01,370
It actually shows it.

7032
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:02,833
Oh yeah.

7033
03:04:03,170 --> 03:04:04,850
Benefit is a monster man.

7034
03:04:04,880 --> 03:04:06,290
His grappling is so strong.

7035
03:04:06,320 --> 03:04:06,651
Oh really?

7036
03:04:06,651 --> 03:04:10,570
Underrated because you always see him
like moving well and punching and quirky

7037
03:04:10,580 --> 03:04:11,540
kicks and stuff.

7038
03:04:11,770 --> 03:04:15,590
He's seen him just being an overall
fighter but is his ground game.

7039
03:04:15,830 --> 03:04:16,910
Elliot was a wrestler.

7040
03:04:16,940 --> 03:04:17,870
Elliott's a tough guy.

7041
03:04:17,930 --> 03:04:18,710
Yeah.

7042
03:04:18,710 --> 03:04:19,190
Yeah.

7043
03:04:19,190 --> 03:04:22,250
When you got Elliot to the ground and I
saw him just to immediately advancing,

7044
03:04:22,251 --> 03:04:23,340
just clamping down.

7045
03:04:23,341 --> 03:04:23,660
I was like,

7046
03:04:23,660 --> 03:04:24,051
Ooh,

7047
03:04:24,051 --> 03:04:27,170
this is a high level
fucking position for him.

7048
03:04:27,890 --> 03:04:28,723
Love it.

7049
03:04:28,880 --> 03:04:31,050
But he's another guy
where you just got us.

7050
03:04:31,051 --> 03:04:32,750
This was as he mounted,

7051
03:04:32,751 --> 03:04:33,081
he hit it.

7052
03:04:33,081 --> 03:04:33,680
I mean,

7053
03:04:33,680 --> 03:04:34,850
you know how bad ass that is.

7054
03:04:34,851 --> 03:04:36,120
You never see that in him.

7055
03:04:36,130 --> 03:04:40,430
And he eats good sweet and they joined
some turn them over and just classic

7056
03:04:40,660 --> 03:04:41,050
shit.

7057
03:04:41,050 --> 03:04:44,150
You see it in class or for sure
should in class all the time,

7058
03:04:44,151 --> 03:04:47,890
but it doesn't quite make it over
to the UFC high level company.

7059
03:04:48,380 --> 03:04:51,590
Benevidez has the Misha Tate Syndrome
where if there was no Rhonda,

7060
03:04:51,591 --> 03:04:52,460
there's no Dj.

7061
03:04:52,460 --> 03:04:53,600
He's the motherfucker,

7062
03:04:53,630 --> 03:04:55,760
but just that during
the time they're there,

7063
03:04:55,761 --> 03:04:57,860
your second best sucks man.

7064
03:04:58,040 --> 03:04:59,990
Well also the second fight they had,

7065
03:04:59,991 --> 03:05:00,620
he tried to,

7066
03:05:00,620 --> 03:05:01,281
are we out of time?

7067
03:05:01,281 --> 03:05:02,120
So what's going on Jamie?

7068
03:05:02,150 --> 03:05:02,983
What happens?

7069
03:05:03,930 --> 03:05:05,260
Let's get it going

7070
03:05:08,380 --> 03:05:09,710
on three hours.

7071
03:05:09,711 --> 03:05:12,170
It was a big issue with
the youtube or Youstream,

7072
03:05:12,171 --> 03:05:13,370
but now we're on youtube.

7073
03:05:13,670 --> 03:05:14,040
They use,

7074
03:05:14,040 --> 03:05:16,080
we were having any
problems with your streets.

7075
03:05:16,310 --> 03:05:19,280
Now we've been on youtube for a while
because we were having problems with both

7076
03:05:19,281 --> 03:05:21,590
feeds on Ustream and youtube is so good.

7077
03:05:21,591 --> 03:05:22,051
It's like it's,

7078
03:05:22,051 --> 03:05:24,230
it's the best way to do it because
you can in the middle of it,

7079
03:05:24,231 --> 03:05:25,100
you can rewind it,

7080
03:05:25,310 --> 03:05:26,030
you can pause it,

7081
03:05:26,030 --> 03:05:26,863
you can do shit to it.

7082
03:05:27,060 --> 03:05:28,220
Couldn't really do that with Ustream,

7083
03:05:28,550 --> 03:05:29,750
so we decided to just keep doing,

7084
03:05:29,751 --> 03:05:30,584
I'm on youtube,

7085
03:05:30,950 --> 03:05:35,420
but Benevidez like the second fight with
mighty mouse was like a pivotal moment

7086
03:05:35,421 --> 03:05:37,100
because he decided to like
try to get flat floor.

7087
03:05:37,570 --> 03:05:38,120
Yup.

7088
03:05:38,120 --> 03:05:39,440
He just decided like his,

7089
03:05:39,470 --> 03:05:40,770
his benefit or his,

7090
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,340
his pro on his corner is the power.

7091
03:05:43,370 --> 03:05:43,701
He's like,

7092
03:05:43,701 --> 03:05:46,570
I'm just going to dig my heels
in and fuck this dude up.

7093
03:05:46,571 --> 03:05:47,404
Repeat again.

7094
03:05:47,540 --> 03:05:48,373
How dare you?

7095
03:05:48,530 --> 03:05:49,400
So if you drink,

7096
03:05:49,401 --> 03:05:50,234
come with it.

7097
03:05:50,540 --> 03:05:51,373
Drank drunk.

7098
03:05:51,830 --> 03:05:53,570
He's the only three in three days,

7099
03:05:54,080 --> 03:05:54,591
but I'm,

7100
03:05:54,591 --> 03:05:55,341
it could use another,

7101
03:05:55,341 --> 03:05:56,240
I'm not gonna lie to you guys.

7102
03:05:56,880 --> 03:05:57,410
Kennan.

7103
03:05:57,410 --> 03:05:59,740
They in their gang of anyone want another?

7104
03:05:59,810 --> 03:06:00,081
No,

7105
03:06:00,081 --> 03:06:00,621
I'm good man.

7106
03:06:00,621 --> 03:06:01,454
Thank you.

7107
03:06:01,710 --> 03:06:02,780
You're on that crazy diet.

7108
03:06:03,110 --> 03:06:03,610
Yeah.

7109
03:06:03,610 --> 03:06:05,000
I probably shouldn't even drank this one.

7110
03:06:05,001 --> 03:06:07,970
I'm on for the new little brown.

7111
03:06:08,070 --> 03:06:09,560
A little for a little brown little brown.

7112
03:06:10,070 --> 03:06:11,720
I made a little brown,

7113
03:06:11,721 --> 03:06:14,840
big brown brownish shit
through at least half Mexican.

7114
03:06:18,570 --> 03:06:19,140
So wait,

7115
03:06:19,140 --> 03:06:19,301
what?

7116
03:06:19,301 --> 03:06:19,570
What are,

7117
03:06:19,570 --> 03:06:20,360
what is he,

7118
03:06:20,360 --> 03:06:21,890
did you see Brown Big Brown?

7119
03:06:21,891 --> 03:06:22,070
Yeah,

7120
03:06:22,070 --> 03:06:22,671
he's not black.

7121
03:06:22,671 --> 03:06:24,020
Kimble had to find that out the hard way.

7122
03:06:26,070 --> 03:06:27,350
Kim is black.

7123
03:06:27,500 --> 03:06:28,760
It's a hilarious story.

7124
03:06:28,970 --> 03:06:29,361
They were,

7125
03:06:29,361 --> 03:06:29,690
uh,

7126
03:06:29,690 --> 03:06:29,991
they,

7127
03:06:29,991 --> 03:06:31,850
there was somebody who
was saying racist shit.

7128
03:06:31,851 --> 03:06:32,684
They thought,

7129
03:06:32,690 --> 03:06:33,430
and uh,

7130
03:06:33,430 --> 03:06:33,581
that,

7131
03:06:33,581 --> 03:06:34,910
that story of a Kimbo thinking,

7132
03:06:34,911 --> 03:06:35,390
you're black,

7133
03:06:35,390 --> 03:06:36,223
you're black.

7134
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:37,281
It's like,

7135
03:06:37,281 --> 03:06:37,521
dude,

7136
03:06:37,521 --> 03:06:38,091
I'm not black.

7137
03:06:38,091 --> 03:06:38,770
What are you?

7138
03:06:38,770 --> 03:06:39,603
So that's what we love about.

7139
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:40,431
What did he say?

7140
03:06:40,431 --> 03:06:41,020
What is the cause?

7141
03:06:41,020 --> 03:06:41,841
That's why I love Brian.

7142
03:06:41,841 --> 03:06:42,970
You know what the fuck is?

7143
03:06:46,640 --> 03:06:47,480
I love Kim Bowman.

7144
03:06:47,481 --> 03:06:49,070
He's one of my favorite
pieces of great guy.

7145
03:06:49,100 --> 03:06:49,580
I just,

7146
03:06:49,580 --> 03:06:51,020
I wish him success and I,

7147
03:06:51,080 --> 03:06:51,770
me too.

7148
03:06:51,770 --> 03:06:52,430
I love him.

7149
03:06:52,430 --> 03:06:53,480
You should have him on your show.

7150
03:06:53,481 --> 03:06:54,080
Jumped out,

7151
03:06:54,080 --> 03:06:55,110
would fall in love with the deal.

7152
03:06:55,430 --> 03:06:55,841
Anyway,

7153
03:06:55,841 --> 03:06:56,150
I loved

7154
03:06:56,150 --> 03:06:56,270
that.

7155
03:06:56,270 --> 03:06:57,390
And once you talked to Emily,

7156
03:06:57,391 --> 03:06:58,380
I damn man,

7157
03:06:58,410 --> 03:06:59,850
just a good family dude.

7158
03:06:59,970 --> 03:07:01,830
I just taken advantage of it.

7159
03:07:01,890 --> 03:07:02,610
I understand.

7160
03:07:02,610 --> 03:07:03,930
But if he's going to fight on TV,

7161
03:07:03,931 --> 03:07:04,920
he's got to be in better shape.

7162
03:07:05,540 --> 03:07:06,980
You just got to be in
better shape than that.

7163
03:07:07,200 --> 03:07:07,921
At the end of the day,

7164
03:07:07,921 --> 03:07:10,950
there's no excuse either one
of them have been in that piss.

7165
03:07:10,951 --> 03:07:12,450
Poor shape is one thing.

7166
03:07:12,451 --> 03:07:13,650
If they don't have the Cardia,

7167
03:07:13,651 --> 03:07:16,440
where's the bottle
opener up in this bitch?

7168
03:07:18,810 --> 03:07:19,081
You know,

7169
03:07:19,081 --> 03:07:21,270
I think he just thought he's
just going to knock that out.

7170
03:07:21,271 --> 03:07:21,661
So he said,

7171
03:07:21,661 --> 03:07:22,021
fuck it.

7172
03:07:22,021 --> 03:07:23,430
Let's go back to the Miami days.

7173
03:07:23,760 --> 03:07:24,630
We can't do that.

7174
03:07:24,840 --> 03:07:25,060
Yeah,

7175
03:07:25,060 --> 03:07:25,893
it doesn't work anymore.

7176
03:07:26,460 --> 03:07:27,293
You get embarrassed.

7177
03:07:27,730 --> 03:07:28,563
You want another beer?

7178
03:07:28,740 --> 03:07:29,220
No,

7179
03:07:29,220 --> 03:07:29,401
no,

7180
03:07:29,401 --> 03:07:29,761
I'm good.

7181
03:07:29,761 --> 03:07:31,030
We're just looking for the bottle opener.

7182
03:07:31,050 --> 03:07:31,950
What the hell do we do it?

7183
03:07:32,250 --> 03:07:33,600
How'd you open these eddy?

7184
03:07:33,660 --> 03:07:34,800
We had a bottle opener.

7185
03:07:35,670 --> 03:07:36,840
I swear we used it.

7186
03:07:37,350 --> 03:07:38,183
Okay.

7187
03:07:39,830 --> 03:07:40,850
What were we just talking about?

7188
03:07:40,890 --> 03:07:43,290
That'd be an epic podcast and Kimbo.

7189
03:07:43,350 --> 03:07:44,183
Yeah Man,

7190
03:07:44,250 --> 03:07:44,461
look,

7191
03:07:44,461 --> 03:07:45,181
I love Kimbo.

7192
03:07:45,181 --> 03:07:46,620
I think his story is awesome.

7193
03:07:46,640 --> 03:07:47,041
But dude,

7194
03:07:47,041 --> 03:07:50,970
I just feel like at this point in time
when you got guys like we'll Brooks when

7195
03:07:50,971 --> 03:07:52,200
you got guys like,

7196
03:07:52,230 --> 03:07:52,651
you know,

7197
03:07:52,651 --> 03:07:54,620
now we just got over Benson Henderson.

7198
03:07:54,630 --> 03:07:56,040
You got guys like Paul Daley.

7199
03:07:56,250 --> 03:07:57,140
You got um,

7200
03:07:57,600 --> 03:07:57,960
um,

7201
03:07:57,960 --> 03:07:58,830
Michael Page,

7202
03:07:59,250 --> 03:08:00,150
bad mother fucker.

7203
03:08:00,360 --> 03:08:01,620
You got some good town over there.

7204
03:08:01,621 --> 03:08:02,454
So the Russians,

7205
03:08:02,750 --> 03:08:02,931
yeah.

7206
03:08:02,931 --> 03:08:04,500
All the Russian guy draw though.

7207
03:08:04,501 --> 03:08:05,010
Man,

7208
03:08:05,010 --> 03:08:05,581
he's old.

7209
03:08:05,581 --> 03:08:06,414
I don't,

7210
03:08:06,630 --> 03:08:07,650
and he's all not,

7211
03:08:07,860 --> 03:08:09,360
not as a headliner folks.

7212
03:08:09,510 --> 03:08:10,343
You don't need that.

7213
03:08:10,800 --> 03:08:11,700
He was in the headliner,

7214
03:08:11,701 --> 03:08:11,910
Louise,

7215
03:08:11,910 --> 03:08:12,750
the Co headlining.

7216
03:08:12,990 --> 03:08:16,080
That's a service that's called main of
it's a circus act is you don't need that.

7217
03:08:16,081 --> 03:08:16,370
You could,

7218
03:08:16,370 --> 03:08:17,430
you could get away without that.

7219
03:08:17,580 --> 03:08:18,630
If you want to have that,

7220
03:08:18,750 --> 03:08:20,640
have that on before
you have a legit fight.

7221
03:08:20,790 --> 03:08:21,820
So you have that fight.

7222
03:08:23,530 --> 03:08:26,430
Unless there's like these crazy numbers
would have proof of one up fights.

7223
03:08:26,820 --> 03:08:29,370
17 million people are better numbers.

7224
03:08:31,170 --> 03:08:35,860
I bet you belters numbers were
better than cal poly card probably.

7225
03:08:36,280 --> 03:08:37,113
You know what?

7226
03:08:37,220 --> 03:08:39,960
Good thing I have no problem with Gracie.

7227
03:08:39,961 --> 03:08:41,840
Shamrock fucking four
I have no problem with.

7228
03:08:42,020 --> 03:08:44,580
I have no problem with head.

7229
03:08:44,750 --> 03:08:47,540
He probably wants to get back
in with the class as I went in.

7230
03:08:47,541 --> 03:08:48,374
The waste

7231
03:08:49,990 --> 03:08:51,630
can be wearing that shirt.

7232
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:52,070
Lunch.

7233
03:08:52,070 --> 03:08:52,903
You guys switched.

7234
03:08:54,570 --> 03:08:56,250
He can't fit in that
shirt for first of all.

7235
03:08:56,251 --> 03:08:57,230
That shit's tight on you.

7236
03:08:57,320 --> 03:08:57,720
Fucking,

7237
03:08:57,720 --> 03:08:59,130
you just love me Dad.

7238
03:09:00,300 --> 03:09:01,560
Why would you hire daddy?

7239
03:09:01,561 --> 03:09:01,861
Hi.

7240
03:09:01,861 --> 03:09:02,694
He pushed me.

7241
03:09:02,870 --> 03:09:04,940
I'm just saying Kimbo was fun to watch.

7242
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:05,833
Be.

7243
03:09:06,090 --> 03:09:06,481
Wait a minute.

7244
03:09:06,481 --> 03:09:10,170
You're defending killers but not a
voice and you're worrying about voice.

7245
03:09:10,171 --> 03:09:13,860
But the voices 50 listen carefully.

7246
03:09:14,160 --> 03:09:15,900
Probably healthier than let him go.

7247
03:09:16,530 --> 03:09:17,100
You know,

7248
03:09:17,100 --> 03:09:19,740
I kind like his chances versus Kimbo.

7249
03:09:19,741 --> 03:09:20,251
How about that?

7250
03:09:20,251 --> 03:09:21,750
I thought would just
go hoist versus Kimbo.

7251
03:09:21,840 --> 03:09:22,673
Now you're fucking,

7252
03:09:22,940 --> 03:09:23,773
oh my God.

7253
03:09:24,180 --> 03:09:26,700
It's like a 50 year old guy
and the best fight of all time.

7254
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:27,810
That's the fight.

7255
03:09:27,810 --> 03:09:28,391
That's the fun.

7256
03:09:28,391 --> 03:09:29,220
That's the fight.

7257
03:09:29,220 --> 03:09:29,851
He's already beat.

7258
03:09:29,851 --> 03:09:34,590
Ken shamrock do it in like Oklahoma on
an Indian reservation for both of them

7259
03:09:34,591 --> 03:09:35,670
can get their supplements.

7260
03:09:36,120 --> 03:09:37,680
Just juice to the gills.

7261
03:09:37,681 --> 03:09:39,760
That'd be some on fucking my tablet.

7262
03:09:39,810 --> 03:09:40,450
Why Not Bella?

7263
03:09:40,450 --> 03:09:40,970
Tori,

7264
03:09:40,970 --> 03:09:41,201
Tori.

7265
03:09:41,201 --> 03:09:41,840
You're welcome.

7266
03:09:41,840 --> 03:09:42,450
Yeah,

7267
03:09:42,450 --> 03:09:43,051
you're welcome.

7268
03:09:43,051 --> 03:09:43,711
Get back in there.

7269
03:09:43,711 --> 03:09:45,360
He got out versus Ken shamrock.

7270
03:09:45,361 --> 03:09:45,691
Zack,

7271
03:09:45,691 --> 03:09:46,660
what I was going to say,

7272
03:09:47,520 --> 03:09:51,150
they would just keep the data show go and
I think Donald's can send has to do is

7273
03:09:51,151 --> 03:09:53,160
dance around for the first 30 seconds.

7274
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:54,130
Donna's out of gas.

7275
03:09:54,160 --> 03:09:54,351
Hey,

7276
03:09:54,351 --> 03:09:57,130
you know how you know fighting's not
for you because when you have a heart

7277
03:09:57,131 --> 03:09:58,030
attack after the fight,

7278
03:09:59,610 --> 03:10:00,490
he almost died.

7279
03:10:01,060 --> 03:10:02,620
Isn't that a sign of his courage though,

7280
03:10:02,621 --> 03:10:05,200
that he was able to push through
when his cardio is completely failed?

7281
03:10:05,201 --> 03:10:05,660
You're still,

7282
03:10:05,660 --> 03:10:06,493
do you want her to get one?

7283
03:10:06,520 --> 03:10:07,360
Her Stupidity?

7284
03:10:07,810 --> 03:10:08,643
I don't know.

7285
03:10:09,340 --> 03:10:09,881
Rude.

7286
03:10:09,881 --> 03:10:11,020
We'll do anything for a paycheck.

7287
03:10:12,220 --> 03:10:14,710
You guys to say Shit.

7288
03:10:14,711 --> 03:10:19,240
I said that his body was filled mashed
potatoes and then you say something and

7289
03:10:19,241 --> 03:10:19,511
I'm like,

7290
03:10:19,511 --> 03:10:20,950
well you said it's racist

7291
03:10:23,920 --> 03:10:24,753
Meatloaf,

7292
03:10:24,790 --> 03:10:25,623
fried chicken,

7293
03:10:26,390 --> 03:10:26,850
Dada,

7294
03:10:26,850 --> 03:10:27,683
you eat horrible.

7295
03:10:29,880 --> 03:10:34,490
I loved Donald Serone
Macdonald and magnate Neil Mag.

7296
03:10:34,491 --> 03:10:35,440
Do you love him

7297
03:10:37,590 --> 03:10:38,423
dude?

7298
03:10:38,460 --> 03:10:40,510
Hector Neil,

7299
03:10:40,580 --> 03:10:41,321
Maggie's awesome.

7300
03:10:41,321 --> 03:10:41,600
I like,

7301
03:10:41,600 --> 03:10:41,870
Hey,

7302
03:10:41,870 --> 03:10:43,030
let's be real about that.

7303
03:10:43,330 --> 03:10:48,330
Hector's 37 38 he's coming off of a
suspension for quite a long time for

7304
03:10:49,001 --> 03:10:49,834
steroids.

7305
03:10:49,900 --> 03:10:50,171
Right?

7306
03:10:50,171 --> 03:10:51,340
How long has this suspension?

7307
03:10:51,940 --> 03:10:52,970
I think it was a long time.

7308
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:53,833
Been a while,

7309
03:10:53,890 --> 03:10:54,940
but it's more than a year.

7310
03:10:55,270 --> 03:10:55,840
Oh yeah.

7311
03:10:55,840 --> 03:10:57,880
So what do you think about that fight?

7312
03:10:58,280 --> 03:10:58,610
When?

7313
03:10:58,610 --> 03:11:01,450
When they first told me
that Neil fight fighting,

7314
03:11:01,451 --> 03:11:01,901
I told him,

7315
03:11:01,901 --> 03:11:02,111
I said,

7316
03:11:02,111 --> 03:11:04,420
I don't like it cause Neil
doesn't use his range.

7317
03:11:04,680 --> 03:11:06,110
She's fucking,

7318
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:07,233
who's that?

7319
03:11:07,420 --> 03:11:07,991
Who's that?

7320
03:11:07,991 --> 03:11:08,440
God,

7321
03:11:08,440 --> 03:11:08,801
I don't know.

7322
03:11:08,801 --> 03:11:09,640
That was on fight pass,

7323
03:11:09,641 --> 03:11:10,390
I guess.

7324
03:11:10,390 --> 03:11:10,871
Oh my God.

7325
03:11:10,871 --> 03:11:12,040
What a bloody war.

7326
03:11:12,041 --> 03:11:14,740
These two chicks had who call my Twitter.

7327
03:11:14,741 --> 03:11:16,060
They said this was fight of the night.

7328
03:11:16,061 --> 03:11:16,750
I heard,

7329
03:11:16,750 --> 03:11:17,583
wow,

7330
03:11:18,220 --> 03:11:19,360
Jesus Christ.

7331
03:11:19,810 --> 03:11:20,561
Oh look at that guy.

7332
03:11:20,561 --> 03:11:21,610
That guy had some kung food.

7333
03:11:22,390 --> 03:11:23,880
That is the thickest torso.

7334
03:11:23,881 --> 03:11:24,820
So I've ever seen in my life.

7335
03:11:24,950 --> 03:11:25,420
Boom.

7336
03:11:25,420 --> 03:11:25,601
Wow.

7337
03:11:25,601 --> 03:11:26,680
That guy looks good.

7338
03:11:26,860 --> 03:11:27,790
Holy Shit.

7339
03:11:27,791 --> 03:11:28,624
He's African.

7340
03:11:28,890 --> 03:11:30,490
Who has tried to them Goosey?

7341
03:11:30,850 --> 03:11:31,840
God Damn.

7342
03:11:32,110 --> 03:11:33,100
Holy Shit.

7343
03:11:33,101 --> 03:11:34,260
That guy looks like

7344
03:11:35,990 --> 03:11:37,990
people are just getting fucked up tonight.

7345
03:11:38,980 --> 03:11:41,000
Who was that white boy?

7346
03:11:41,001 --> 03:11:42,280
He got hands.

7347
03:11:42,340 --> 03:11:43,180
Oh my goodness.

7348
03:11:43,420 --> 03:11:44,050
Sake.

7349
03:11:44,050 --> 03:11:45,130
Sean Strickland.

7350
03:11:45,220 --> 03:11:45,371
Oh,

7351
03:11:45,371 --> 03:11:46,720
he knocked out Alex Garcia,

7352
03:11:47,680 --> 03:11:49,660
Garcia Garcia the tank,

7353
03:11:50,140 --> 03:11:50,911
and he kissed the ground.

7354
03:11:50,911 --> 03:11:51,810
He's gonna get staff from good.

7355
03:11:51,811 --> 03:11:52,601
Let's get that.

7356
03:11:52,601 --> 03:11:52,781
Yeah,

7357
03:11:52,781 --> 03:11:54,110
he has got Stephanie Lipson,

7358
03:11:54,570 --> 03:11:55,510
Merce on that bottom.

7359
03:11:55,610 --> 03:11:57,160
Chris Kamozi performances at night.

7360
03:11:57,490 --> 03:11:58,420
Donald's fight,

7361
03:11:58,421 --> 03:11:58,810
fight,

7362
03:11:58,810 --> 03:12:00,760
and then those chicos garments bonuses.

7363
03:12:00,790 --> 03:12:01,690
That's so weird to me.

7364
03:12:01,691 --> 03:12:06,691
I feel like I'm watching some fucking
hunger game shit performance post 50 grand

7365
03:12:07,211 --> 03:12:08,200
fatality,

7366
03:12:08,530 --> 03:12:11,800
extra money for maiming career ender.

7367
03:12:12,790 --> 03:12:14,800
Do you know why they comp
performance of the night?

7368
03:12:14,801 --> 03:12:16,960
And that's the mission of the night
anymore because sometimes they'd have no

7369
03:12:16,961 --> 03:12:18,910
submissions and what's,

7370
03:12:18,930 --> 03:12:19,440
I'm trying to,

7371
03:12:19,440 --> 03:12:20,650
it sounds too violent.

7372
03:12:20,651 --> 03:12:21,341
Knock out of the night.

7373
03:12:21,341 --> 03:12:22,900
Sounds like it's promoting violence.

7374
03:12:23,140 --> 03:12:23,441
Oh,

7375
03:12:23,441 --> 03:12:24,274
who said that?

7376
03:12:24,460 --> 03:12:25,031
I can't say that.

7377
03:12:25,031 --> 03:12:25,820
You just make that up.

7378
03:12:25,820 --> 03:12:28,520
Eddie and spirit like we

7379
03:12:30,220 --> 03:12:32,980
promoting like the most violent knockout.

7380
03:12:32,981 --> 03:12:34,450
So let's just call it performance.

7381
03:12:34,480 --> 03:12:38,440
Well they definitely tend to shy
away from blood on these shows.

7382
03:12:39,570 --> 03:12:42,800
I was kind of shocked that they showed
that one in the replay because that would

7383
03:12:42,840 --> 03:12:43,720
those two gals,

7384
03:12:44,080 --> 03:12:44,580
cause that was,

7385
03:12:44,580 --> 03:12:44,980
is that,

7386
03:12:44,980 --> 03:12:45,813
is that sexist?

7387
03:12:46,630 --> 03:12:48,690
Is there any truth to Fox choir?

7388
03:12:49,990 --> 03:12:51,250
Fucking say gals.

7389
03:12:51,290 --> 03:12:51,891
I've uh,

7390
03:12:51,891 --> 03:12:52,070
I've

7391
03:12:52,070 --> 03:12:54,230
been scared to say bitches.

7392
03:12:54,460 --> 03:12:55,440
Just scared to ask.

7393
03:12:56,480 --> 03:12:56,950
Like you've say,

7394
03:12:56,950 --> 03:13:01,790
those bitches can find if the free
Tito's leave though and Dana leaves,

7395
03:13:02,300 --> 03:13:03,800
look this thing,

7396
03:13:03,801 --> 03:13:04,551
this ship is sinking.

7397
03:13:04,551 --> 03:13:09,551
This thing is not entirely like
actually my friend Ashley Ashley,

7398
03:13:10,611 --> 03:13:11,420
Evan Smith.

7399
03:13:11,420 --> 03:13:12,260
Jesus Christ.

7400
03:13:12,261 --> 03:13:13,160
She looks awesome.

7401
03:13:13,400 --> 03:13:13,601
No,

7402
03:13:13,601 --> 03:13:13,730
no.

7403
03:13:13,730 --> 03:13:15,040
That's the girl getting the girl,

7404
03:13:15,070 --> 03:13:15,480
her friend.

7405
03:13:15,480 --> 03:13:15,860
His,

7406
03:13:15,860 --> 03:13:16,321
your friends.

7407
03:13:16,321 --> 03:13:17,480
The one that was getting ready to,

7408
03:13:17,540 --> 03:13:18,373
we got an ass kicker.

7409
03:13:19,400 --> 03:13:19,761
Ashley.

7410
03:13:19,761 --> 03:13:21,800
Evan Smith got whooped
by that girl like that.

7411
03:13:21,830 --> 03:13:22,730
What's his girl's name?

7412
03:13:23,240 --> 03:13:24,680
Split decision right now.

7413
03:13:24,740 --> 03:13:24,981
Oh,

7414
03:13:24,981 --> 03:13:25,760
Maureen minnows.

7415
03:13:25,760 --> 03:13:28,990
That Myron Renaud his Rogers.

7416
03:13:29,140 --> 03:13:29,710
What happened?

7417
03:13:29,710 --> 03:13:31,020
Why is he showing US weight?

7418
03:13:31,060 --> 03:13:31,893
Does the rest,

7419
03:13:32,050 --> 03:13:33,680
there's a six cause controversy going on.

7420
03:13:33,681 --> 03:13:34,514
What happened there?

7421
03:13:34,540 --> 03:13:35,373
Oh,

7422
03:13:35,540 --> 03:13:36,021
29,

7423
03:13:36,021 --> 03:13:37,640
28 Reno for me.

7424
03:13:38,220 --> 03:13:38,390
Oh,

7425
03:13:38,390 --> 03:13:40,190
they're just talking about the decision.

7426
03:13:40,191 --> 03:13:41,210
I guess it was a decision.

7427
03:13:41,390 --> 03:13:43,480
And who want 29 28 Reno DC.

7428
03:13:43,490 --> 03:13:44,660
Sounds like the other girl one.

7429
03:13:44,750 --> 03:13:49,270
It sounds like Ashley Smith one cause I
mean they're showing like score Gannon

7430
03:13:49,280 --> 03:13:51,020
and something really something happened.

7431
03:13:51,020 --> 03:13:51,980
Should I get her ass kicked?

7432
03:13:51,981 --> 03:13:55,310
Judge One judge score 30 27 I dunno.

7433
03:13:56,090 --> 03:13:56,631
We don't know.

7434
03:13:56,631 --> 03:13:57,530
How can we comment on a fight?

7435
03:13:57,531 --> 03:13:58,010
We didn't even know.

7436
03:13:58,010 --> 03:13:58,461
I love it.

7437
03:13:58,461 --> 03:13:59,540
That's why we do these things.

7438
03:14:00,340 --> 03:14:03,740
It's one click and see
what happened there.

7439
03:14:03,860 --> 03:14:04,730
Get to the bottom

7440
03:14:07,030 --> 03:14:08,450
right to the money generator.

7441
03:14:08,690 --> 03:14:10,820
This is the money General Ashley,

7442
03:14:10,821 --> 03:14:12,020
Evan Smith One.

7443
03:14:12,770 --> 03:14:13,370
Okay.

7444
03:14:13,370 --> 03:14:15,350
So they're saying it's a
bad decision or something.

7445
03:14:15,380 --> 03:14:15,710
Yes.

7446
03:14:15,710 --> 03:14:16,970
Oh that's what it is.

7447
03:14:17,570 --> 03:14:18,403
I like Ashley.

7448
03:14:19,080 --> 03:14:20,240
I haven't done it for a long time.

7449
03:14:20,241 --> 03:14:21,074
She's a nice girl.

7450
03:14:21,320 --> 03:14:23,270
She's a girl that beat Fallon Fox.

7451
03:14:23,340 --> 03:14:25,160
She's the one girl that beat that.

7452
03:14:25,161 --> 03:14:27,440
A transgender MMA fighter
that used to be a dude.

7453
03:14:27,441 --> 03:14:28,100
That's right.

7454
03:14:28,100 --> 03:14:28,431
And she's,

7455
03:14:28,431 --> 03:14:29,840
she's BFF with uh,

7456
03:14:29,870 --> 03:14:30,550
Carla.

7457
03:14:30,550 --> 03:14:31,310
Is She?

7458
03:14:31,310 --> 03:14:32,140
Oh that's cool.

7459
03:14:32,140 --> 03:14:32,590
Hang on it,

7460
03:14:32,590 --> 03:14:33,920
I got to just fucking
deal with all of them.

7461
03:14:33,921 --> 03:14:34,401
Cause now you know,

7462
03:14:34,401 --> 03:14:35,234
Carla's at my gym.

7463
03:14:36,950 --> 03:14:37,783
How's she doing?

7464
03:14:37,850 --> 03:14:38,111
She didn't.

7465
03:14:38,111 --> 03:14:38,420
Good.

7466
03:14:38,420 --> 03:14:39,500
When does she get him back in there?

7467
03:14:40,040 --> 03:14:40,770
I don't know yet.

7468
03:14:40,770 --> 03:14:41,810
I mean she's trained in hard down though.

7469
03:14:42,440 --> 03:14:45,200
She decided to take some time off
and like really work on her game.

7470
03:14:45,950 --> 03:14:46,520
Yeah,

7471
03:14:46,520 --> 03:14:47,540
her striking and just,

7472
03:14:47,541 --> 03:14:47,721
yeah,

7473
03:14:47,721 --> 03:14:48,171
just eat,

7474
03:14:48,171 --> 03:14:50,570
just revamp everything
and get her head straight.

7475
03:14:50,571 --> 03:14:51,140
And you know,

7476
03:14:51,140 --> 03:14:52,310
she got her fucking ass kicked.

7477
03:14:52,610 --> 03:14:57,170
Well she fought a murderer and Polish
murderer and she went into it mentally

7478
03:14:57,171 --> 03:14:57,441
flat.

7479
03:14:57,441 --> 03:14:58,274
I mean I,

7480
03:14:58,640 --> 03:14:59,690
I'm there every day with her,

7481
03:14:59,691 --> 03:15:00,041
so I,

7482
03:15:00,041 --> 03:15:01,490
I saw weeks in advance.

7483
03:15:01,491 --> 03:15:01,790
I was like,

7484
03:15:01,790 --> 03:15:01,941
oh,

7485
03:15:01,941 --> 03:15:02,774
she's fucked.

7486
03:15:02,860 --> 03:15:05,870
Do you see just this flat because of the
pressure or do you think she was flat

7487
03:15:05,871 --> 03:15:09,790
because of over training or what do
you think Yolanda is a fucking murderer

7488
03:15:09,800 --> 03:15:10,910
mixture of all of it.

7489
03:15:11,300 --> 03:15:12,140
You can get in with them.

7490
03:15:12,710 --> 03:15:13,350
Yeah.

7491
03:15:13,350 --> 03:15:13,580
Okay.

7492
03:15:13,580 --> 03:15:17,870
So we're sitting backstage and we could
hear you want to warming up fucking

7493
03:15:17,890 --> 03:15:18,440
right next.

7494
03:15:18,440 --> 03:15:19,273
Sorry.

7495
03:15:21,470 --> 03:15:21,660
And

7496
03:15:21,660 --> 03:15:22,281
Carlos sitting there,

7497
03:15:22,281 --> 03:15:22,470
we go.

7498
03:15:22,470 --> 03:15:23,241
And I just looked at it.

7499
03:15:23,241 --> 03:15:23,451
I was like,

7500
03:15:23,451 --> 03:15:23,990
fuck,

7501
03:15:23,990 --> 03:15:24,350
come here.

7502
03:15:24,350 --> 03:15:24,800
Let's start.

7503
03:15:24,800 --> 03:15:25,310
Let's warm up.

7504
03:15:25,310 --> 03:15:25,800
That's what I'm about.

7505
03:15:25,800 --> 03:15:26,210
That's where up.

7506
03:15:26,210 --> 03:15:27,043
That's what I'm up by.

7507
03:15:27,290 --> 03:15:27,780
You want to,

7508
03:15:27,780 --> 03:15:31,260
let's just fucking screaming in there the
whole time for like two hours doing it

7509
03:15:31,270 --> 03:15:31,400
there.

7510
03:15:31,400 --> 03:15:35,180
The fuck with [inaudible] bars?

7511
03:15:35,181 --> 03:15:38,180
Probably not even hitting pads really
has someone smack and things and she's

7512
03:15:38,181 --> 03:15:39,014
just yelling.

7513
03:15:39,220 --> 03:15:41,470
She just had this [inaudible].

7514
03:15:42,830 --> 03:15:44,420
It was very,

7515
03:15:44,421 --> 03:15:44,751
you know,

7516
03:15:44,751 --> 03:15:47,680
it was fucking like my
grandpa said back in the,

7517
03:15:47,681 --> 03:15:47,930

7518
03:15:47,930 --> 03:15:49,140
in the world war,

7519
03:15:49,350 --> 03:15:50,280
whatever war he was in,

7520
03:15:50,620 --> 03:15:54,960
sit in the Japanese were hitting the
trees with their swords and middle of the

7521
03:15:54,961 --> 03:15:55,141
night,

7522
03:15:55,141 --> 03:15:55,681

7523
03:15:55,681 --> 03:15:56,220

7524
03:15:56,220 --> 03:15:56,850

7525
03:15:56,850 --> 03:15:57,211

7526
03:15:57,211 --> 03:15:58,470
and just screaming in the jungle,

7527
03:15:58,620 --> 03:15:59,430
trying to keep you awake.

7528
03:15:59,430 --> 03:16:00,020
Yeah.

7529
03:16:00,020 --> 03:16:00,360
Brian,

7530
03:16:00,360 --> 03:16:01,830
I think everyone when they saw you on it,

7531
03:16:01,831 --> 03:16:03,660
just fucking merch girls was like,

7532
03:16:03,661 --> 03:16:04,590
I'm gonna take some time off.

7533
03:16:04,600 --> 03:16:05,420
Work on my stand.

7534
03:16:05,420 --> 03:16:08,100
The Julian fight was the worst.

7535
03:16:08,160 --> 03:16:09,490
Good luck not doing a pen.

7536
03:16:09,491 --> 03:16:09,760
Yeah.

7537
03:16:09,760 --> 03:16:10,020
Uh,

7538
03:16:10,020 --> 03:16:11,240
Jessica [inaudible],

7539
03:16:11,330 --> 03:16:14,790
Jessica Pinay and that's another
girl I've known for a long time.

7540
03:16:14,791 --> 03:16:15,780
She merged her,

7541
03:16:15,970 --> 03:16:17,730
she gave her a nose job.

7542
03:16:17,731 --> 03:16:19,450
Fullstory smashed her whole face,

7543
03:16:19,451 --> 03:16:20,284
smashed her face.

7544
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:23,040
She's so scary with her striking match.

7545
03:16:23,041 --> 03:16:24,000
She's a mother fucker,

7546
03:16:24,030 --> 03:16:26,250
but she breaks her hands all the time.

7547
03:16:26,251 --> 03:16:28,200
She's got uncle creepy did still wins.

7548
03:16:28,290 --> 03:16:28,890
Yeah.

7549
03:16:28,890 --> 03:16:29,011
Oh,

7550
03:16:29,011 --> 03:16:29,761
she guts it out.

7551
03:16:29,761 --> 03:16:30,120
Yeah.

7552
03:16:30,120 --> 03:16:31,080
She says she's fucking,

7553
03:16:31,620 --> 03:16:35,580
he got to the point where she was fucking
with Carla and then with all the noise

7554
03:16:35,581 --> 03:16:39,160
I walked out to that fight fucking
staring at her and was like,

7555
03:16:39,210 --> 03:16:40,810
fuck you don't get head kicks in that.

7556
03:16:41,220 --> 03:16:41,491
Oh yeah,

7557
03:16:41,491 --> 03:16:42,250
I'm looking at her cause my,

7558
03:16:42,250 --> 03:16:43,130
you know my,

7559
03:16:43,230 --> 03:16:47,040
my basically little sister is about to
fight you and then she put your fucking,

7560
03:16:47,370 --> 03:16:48,001
if you loved her,

7561
03:16:48,001 --> 03:16:48,834
why'd you let her fight her?

7562
03:16:49,830 --> 03:16:54,740
If you really loved her and
you see you on a kick boxer,

7563
03:16:54,760 --> 03:16:56,910
pull her aside and the
last two year Vandana done,

7564
03:16:56,911 --> 03:16:57,870
do a little fishing.

7565
03:17:00,500 --> 03:17:02,380
Them Wonderland cruises.

7566
03:17:02,430 --> 03:17:04,370
It goes through the
killer whales in Alaska.

7567
03:17:04,400 --> 03:17:05,500
Let's just get the fuck out of it.

7568
03:17:06,480 --> 03:17:09,720
We don't need to be doing this baby
because she didn't take me out.

7569
03:17:09,740 --> 03:17:09,991
Shit.

7570
03:17:09,991 --> 03:17:10,260
Chung,

7571
03:17:10,260 --> 03:17:11,490
we take them as friends.

7572
03:17:13,050 --> 03:17:16,610
I had the sibling rivalry maybe
marked now that was fucking that.

7573
03:17:16,611 --> 03:17:17,260
It broke my heart.

7574
03:17:17,260 --> 03:17:18,061
She was a champ.

7575
03:17:18,061 --> 03:17:18,960
She had to defend her title.

7576
03:17:18,961 --> 03:17:19,860
There's no way around it,

7577
03:17:19,920 --> 03:17:20,190
you know,

7578
03:17:20,190 --> 03:17:21,630
unless she vacates the title and says,

7579
03:17:21,631 --> 03:17:21,811
look,

7580
03:17:21,811 --> 03:17:22,890
I'm going to take some time off.

7581
03:17:23,130 --> 03:17:23,351
You know,

7582
03:17:23,351 --> 03:17:24,570
we'll do that in a glory.

7583
03:17:24,580 --> 03:17:26,490
Valtellina he had a concussion.

7584
03:17:26,520 --> 03:17:27,210
He said,

7585
03:17:27,210 --> 03:17:28,260
I'm going to vacate the title.

7586
03:17:28,261 --> 03:17:28,981
I'm going to walk away.

7587
03:17:28,981 --> 03:17:29,400
I'm going to,

7588
03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:31,890
you know the rest of my
fucking brain up dude.

7589
03:17:32,130 --> 03:17:33,240
Good luck being Carla.

7590
03:17:33,660 --> 03:17:34,140
Yeah.

7591
03:17:34,140 --> 03:17:35,310
Well that division is just,

7592
03:17:35,760 --> 03:17:37,150
how about cologic a day?

7593
03:17:37,151 --> 03:17:37,650
Yeah.

7594
03:17:37,650 --> 03:17:38,830
There's a good argument.

7595
03:17:38,831 --> 03:17:39,121
That clause.

7596
03:17:39,121 --> 03:17:39,500
You get dairy.

7597
03:17:39,500 --> 03:17:40,333
He won the first fight.

7598
03:17:40,340 --> 03:17:42,390
I thought she had a lot
of people just close.

7599
03:17:42,450 --> 03:17:43,170
It's very close.

7600
03:17:43,170 --> 03:17:44,700
I bet you this next one isn't.

7601
03:17:45,330 --> 03:17:46,020
I think so.

7602
03:17:46,020 --> 03:17:46,290
Yup.

7603
03:17:46,290 --> 03:17:48,680
Because he called me a
hate or glass happened.

7604
03:17:49,230 --> 03:17:51,150
I just think Yolanda is
going to fuck her world.

7605
03:17:51,151 --> 03:17:52,200
I feel the same way.

7606
03:17:52,500 --> 03:17:54,150
Well to different it could.

7607
03:17:54,270 --> 03:17:56,370
She could or we could see.

7608
03:17:56,450 --> 03:17:59,420
We don't know until they get after it
because I'm just saying what my educated,

7609
03:18:00,880 --> 03:18:01,050
yeah,

7610
03:18:01,050 --> 03:18:01,441
I agree.

7611
03:18:01,441 --> 03:18:02,080
She looked great.

7612
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:03,100
Coach is a beast,

7613
03:18:03,150 --> 03:18:03,730
man.

7614
03:18:03,730 --> 03:18:04,180
Girl.

7615
03:18:04,180 --> 03:18:05,490
That's town game too.

7616
03:18:05,560 --> 03:18:07,380
And I'm still like a
little Thiago Alvarez.

7617
03:18:07,740 --> 03:18:08,940
The last girl that fought,

7618
03:18:08,941 --> 03:18:09,774
uh,

7619
03:18:10,330 --> 03:18:10,550
you,

7620
03:18:10,550 --> 03:18:12,090
ANA is Valerie.

7621
03:18:13,200 --> 03:18:14,460
She took when she took her down,

7622
03:18:14,790 --> 03:18:15,270
I was like,

7623
03:18:15,270 --> 03:18:15,691
oh,

7624
03:18:15,691 --> 03:18:16,860
you're to kind of sucks.

7625
03:18:17,050 --> 03:18:17,400
Okay.

7626
03:18:17,400 --> 03:18:19,440
Valerie was tough as fuck.

7627
03:18:19,800 --> 03:18:20,760
She's tough as fuck.

7628
03:18:21,030 --> 03:18:21,430
She,

7629
03:18:21,430 --> 03:18:23,160
she always looks the
same after every fight.

7630
03:18:23,161 --> 03:18:24,740
So fucked up swollen eye.

7631
03:18:25,270 --> 03:18:26,280
That girl's tough.

7632
03:18:26,710 --> 03:18:30,390
You want to get them there in Amsterdam
and goes with the dude's just does work

7633
03:18:30,450 --> 03:18:30,761

7634
03:18:30,761 --> 03:18:35,070
It's Christ that and she's
tiny one got his style is to,

7635
03:18:35,080 --> 03:18:35,341

let's likes it makes us up.

7639
03:18:38,010 --> 03:18:39,930
That's her story that she makes it up.

7640
03:18:39,990 --> 03:18:40,680
Oh yeah.

7641
03:18:40,680 --> 03:18:42,030
She got all the money and she's like,

7642
03:18:42,031 --> 03:18:42,780
fuck this,

7643
03:18:42,780 --> 03:18:43,613

7644
03:18:43,850 --> 03:18:45,300

7645
03:18:46,380 --> 03:18:47,213
Kanye shoes.

7646
03:18:47,320 --> 03:18:47,661
No,

7647
03:18:47,661 --> 03:18:48,730
she's not that famous.

7648
03:18:49,420 --> 03:18:49,820
This,

7649
03:18:49,820 --> 03:18:50,080
this.

7650
03:18:50,080 --> 03:18:51,060
The fuck is the cornea shifts.

7651
03:18:51,070 --> 03:18:53,890
Don't remember me and Jamie stayed up
all night and we looked at that form all

7652
03:18:53,891 --> 03:18:54,724
nine or we didn't get them.

7653
03:18:54,880 --> 03:18:55,181
You know,

7654
03:18:55,181 --> 03:18:57,690
there's a really big fight at one 79 yeah,

7655
03:18:57,700 --> 03:18:58,630
I'd like to hear this.

7656
03:18:58,690 --> 03:18:59,530
He said all kinds of,

7657
03:18:59,531 --> 03:19:00,550
just mind fucking him.

7658
03:19:01,020 --> 03:19:01,380
Okay.

7659
03:19:01,380 --> 03:19:01,550
Oh,

7660
03:19:01,550 --> 03:19:01,750
here.

7661
03:19:01,750 --> 03:19:02,260
This,

7662
03:19:02,260 --> 03:19:02,501
yeah.

7663
03:19:02,501 --> 03:19:03,334
Turn it up.

7664
03:19:03,370 --> 03:19:04,121
Can we rewind it?

7665
03:19:04,121 --> 03:19:04,954
Just a pit.

7666
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:06,850
You can't rewind it.

7667
03:19:07,600 --> 03:19:08,381
Why can't we rewind?

7668
03:19:08,381 --> 03:19:10,060
It was just a montage of his shit talking.

7669
03:19:10,360 --> 03:19:11,380
Isn't this direct TV?

7670
03:19:12,190 --> 03:19:13,360
We could rewind it.

7671
03:19:14,170 --> 03:19:15,120
What do we cave people?

7672
03:19:16,260 --> 03:19:18,350
You don't think you see people
sitting there watching a commercial?

7673
03:19:18,351 --> 03:19:18,521
I'm like,

7674
03:19:18,521 --> 03:19:18,701
you know,

7675
03:19:18,701 --> 03:19:19,600
you don't have to do this.

7676
03:19:20,080 --> 03:19:21,730
Let's pause this bitch and
go get something to eat.

7677
03:19:21,760 --> 03:19:22,490
I agree though.

7678
03:19:22,490 --> 03:19:22,811
Fuck.

7679
03:19:22,811 --> 03:19:25,710
Are we doing fucking Harris crank it.

7680
03:19:26,920 --> 03:19:31,920
I'd say about 26 2016 at 12 at the
end of 2015 and means the end of the

7681
03:19:32,391 --> 03:19:33,220
[inaudible].

7682
03:19:33,220 --> 03:19:34,610
They are all dead in the water.

7683
03:19:34,611 --> 03:19:35,290
It's doing what?

7684
03:19:35,290 --> 03:19:37,750
I have my eye and at one
35 that is in a nice seat.

7685
03:19:37,751 --> 03:19:42,740
I'm all stuck in the mode in there will
be killed like I big dent and then it's

7686
03:19:42,741 --> 03:19:44,390
on to the [inaudible] still in the mode.

7687
03:19:44,391 --> 03:19:45,090
That vision.

7688
03:19:45,090 --> 03:19:45,260
How?

7689
03:19:45,260 --> 03:19:46,093
By being wrong,

7690
03:19:46,820 --> 03:19:47,653
the wrong yet

7691
03:19:49,070 --> 03:19:50,140
this motherfucker,

7692
03:19:54,380 --> 03:19:56,370
God damn shit.

7693
03:19:56,610 --> 03:19:57,740
Nothing's ever the same.

7694
03:19:57,840 --> 03:19:58,673
It's always different.

7695
03:19:58,820 --> 03:20:00,170
Religious people going crazy,

7696
03:20:00,950 --> 03:20:01,341
crazy,

7697
03:20:01,341 --> 03:20:02,174
mad at him.

7698
03:20:04,430 --> 03:20:06,890
I keep trying to go to the place that
are the guy that makes his suits.

7699
03:20:06,891 --> 03:20:07,610
I work out with him,

7700
03:20:07,610 --> 03:20:08,660
but it's a little too explain it.

7701
03:20:08,661 --> 03:20:09,021
August.

7702
03:20:09,021 --> 03:20:09,490
Yeah.

7703
03:20:09,490 --> 03:20:09,800
Yeah.

7704
03:20:09,800 --> 03:20:11,090
He makes us suits for the UFC.

7705
03:20:11,130 --> 03:20:11,840
Yeah.

7706
03:20:11,840 --> 03:20:14,280
On those monkey suits that you
see me wearing now and all.

7707
03:20:14,300 --> 03:20:14,571
David,

7708
03:20:14,571 --> 03:20:16,130
I guess he makes us feel great suits.

7709
03:20:16,260 --> 03:20:18,530
They fit great and I don't
have to bring clothes.

7710
03:20:18,531 --> 03:20:19,250
That's what I like.

7711
03:20:19,250 --> 03:20:20,170
I can dress normal.

7712
03:20:20,470 --> 03:20:22,540
I just show up and change
happen in your locker room now.

7713
03:20:22,670 --> 03:20:23,840
I used to have to bring my own clothes.

7714
03:20:23,841 --> 03:20:26,510
That's why I always wore
the same exact shit.

7715
03:20:26,740 --> 03:20:27,573
Black shirt,

7716
03:20:27,650 --> 03:20:30,080
jeans and black shoes.

7717
03:20:30,110 --> 03:20:30,800
That's it.

7718
03:20:30,800 --> 03:20:31,730
That's all I wore.

7719
03:20:32,050 --> 03:20:32,440
I,

7720
03:20:32,440 --> 03:20:33,060
I've even seen all that.

7721
03:20:33,060 --> 03:20:34,280
The chain dragging that I do.

7722
03:20:34,280 --> 03:20:36,770
I'll put like one of those anchor
harnesses on and put a hundred,

7723
03:20:36,771 --> 03:20:38,600
200 pounds of chains and
drag it for like a mile.

7724
03:20:38,630 --> 03:20:38,840
Yeah,

7725
03:20:38,840 --> 03:20:40,370
it would give me a suit or five.

7726
03:20:40,430 --> 03:20:42,890
That all fits my little
short troll body perfectly.

7727
03:20:43,430 --> 03:20:44,263
See,

7728
03:20:44,470 --> 03:20:45,650
it's hard to find suits.

7729
03:20:45,710 --> 03:20:48,020
Luckily I used to work in the fashion
industry so I know what the fuck.

7730
03:20:48,070 --> 03:20:49,550
Imagine being Yoel Romero.

7731
03:20:49,700 --> 03:20:50,533
Oh God.

7732
03:20:51,950 --> 03:20:52,260
Shit.

7733
03:20:52,260 --> 03:20:54,830
Right to try to find a suit for one
of those guys are in Dan [inaudible].

7734
03:20:54,860 --> 03:20:55,693
Remember him

7735
03:20:57,170 --> 03:20:58,003
around and bald?

7736
03:20:58,280 --> 03:20:58,430
Yeah.

7737
03:20:58,430 --> 03:20:59,263
Remember Dan Bobas

7738
03:21:00,870 --> 03:21:01,200
Bill.

7739
03:21:01,200 --> 03:21:02,150
Look up fucking brick.

7740
03:21:02,151 --> 03:21:02,811
Shithouse man,

7741
03:21:02,811 --> 03:21:04,220
like I was gigantic suits.

7742
03:21:04,430 --> 03:21:05,570
Suits aren't for everyone.

7743
03:21:05,690 --> 03:21:06,620
They're not for you.

7744
03:21:06,621 --> 03:21:07,190
Are they?

7745
03:21:07,190 --> 03:21:07,341
Oh,

7746
03:21:07,341 --> 03:21:08,174
I love a suit.

7747
03:21:09,500 --> 03:21:10,333
A suit.

7748
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:12,410
I love the suit to how many seats you got?

7749
03:21:14,420 --> 03:21:18,050
Couple for you to buy yourself a suit
when your kid turns one probably or

7750
03:21:18,051 --> 03:21:18,321
another.

7751
03:21:18,321 --> 03:21:21,520
Watch push Michigan matching suits.

7752
03:21:21,590 --> 03:21:23,470
I had to have like a three
or four suits when I,

7753
03:21:23,530 --> 03:21:25,220
when I commentated for
King of the cage and,

7754
03:21:25,221 --> 03:21:26,000
and pride.

7755
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:26,833
There's builders,

7756
03:21:27,020 --> 03:21:27,940
there's Boba shop

7757
03:21:29,720 --> 03:21:30,553
kicking the cane.

7758
03:21:31,060 --> 03:21:32,230
Forgot about that guy.

7759
03:21:33,590 --> 03:21:34,830
Remember when Mark Kurtz admitted him?

7760
03:21:34,840 --> 03:21:35,673
Both uh,

7761
03:21:36,500 --> 03:21:37,333
um,

7762
03:21:37,580 --> 03:21:37,911
excuse me,

7763
03:21:37,911 --> 03:21:38,810
a Chin and the eyeball

7764
03:21:40,340 --> 03:21:41,173
to

7765
03:21:43,920 --> 03:21:46,010
eyeball and forcing him
there until he tapped.

7766
03:21:46,710 --> 03:21:47,543
She was nasty.

7767
03:21:49,160 --> 03:21:49,993
I remember that fight.

7768
03:21:50,490 --> 03:21:51,323
King of the car.

7769
03:21:51,350 --> 03:21:53,240
Look at those before Mark Kerr,

7770
03:21:53,270 --> 03:21:55,280
the fucking smashing machine.

7771
03:21:55,400 --> 03:21:59,400
That's back when mark was the specimen
before he even became a smashing machine.

7772
03:21:59,401 --> 03:21:59,601
Yeah,

7773
03:21:59,601 --> 03:21:59,960
man.

7774
03:21:59,960 --> 03:22:01,420
He was the specimen first dude.

7775
03:22:01,430 --> 03:22:02,263
He might not.

7776
03:22:02,780 --> 03:22:03,350
He might have one.

7777
03:22:03,350 --> 03:22:06,020
The best bodies mash made for white guys,

7778
03:22:07,190 --> 03:22:08,170
Brazilians columnists,

7779
03:22:08,210 --> 03:22:08,811
smashing machine.

7780
03:22:08,811 --> 03:22:10,910
When he went to Brazil and he
went to Brazil before the UFC,

7781
03:22:12,050 --> 03:22:13,070
who called him a specimen.

7782
03:22:13,071 --> 03:22:16,000
Then I thought that was his two pictures.

7783
03:22:16,640 --> 03:22:19,430
Why people call them that
resilience Commons bashing machine.

7784
03:22:19,790 --> 03:22:24,680
The Brazilians call them and machine
thought best white man body fucking neck.

7785
03:22:24,920 --> 03:22:25,581
Good Lord.

7786
03:22:25,581 --> 03:22:25,881
First of all,

7787
03:22:25,881 --> 03:22:26,750
is he totally white?

7788
03:22:26,990 --> 03:22:27,823
Cause I would say yes.

7789
03:22:28,010 --> 03:22:28,701
I think so.

7790
03:22:28,701 --> 03:22:32,130
First team all body right
now he's got my pig.

7791
03:22:32,480 --> 03:22:32,900
Yeah,

7792
03:22:32,900 --> 03:22:33,411
definitely.

7793
03:22:33,411 --> 03:22:35,330
The round his ass of all time.

7794
03:22:36,110 --> 03:22:36,943
Is that real?

7795
03:22:37,430 --> 03:22:39,020
When he was at his best,

7796
03:22:39,140 --> 03:22:40,460
he was fucking terrifying.

7797
03:22:40,640 --> 03:22:45,230
But the thing is no one can sustain that
level of Jews for more than a few years

7798
03:22:45,260 --> 03:22:46,820
and I and other intervenous drugs,

7799
03:22:46,840 --> 03:22:47,660
whatever else he was doing.

7800
03:22:47,660 --> 03:22:48,830
Butter bean right there.

7801
03:22:49,370 --> 03:22:50,090
That's povish.

7802
03:22:50,090 --> 03:22:50,600
That's,

7803
03:22:50,600 --> 03:22:50,841
yeah,

7804
03:22:50,841 --> 03:22:51,470
that's buttery.

7805
03:22:51,470 --> 03:22:54,710
Oh that is a smashing machine is
best body and worst body ever an MMA.

7806
03:22:55,040 --> 03:22:58,010
This smashing machine
was a crazy documentary.

7807
03:22:58,270 --> 03:23:00,740
If you haven't seen it
folks pause this podcast.

7808
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:01,820
I've never seen a watch it.

7809
03:23:01,850 --> 03:23:03,740
You've never seen the smashing
machine and I love me.

7810
03:23:03,741 --> 03:23:05,790
Some does shake of show goods.

7811
03:23:06,920 --> 03:23:09,000
They caught him right
when he was falling apart.

7812
03:23:09,020 --> 03:23:09,290
They,

7813
03:23:09,290 --> 03:23:11,390
they went to him to film a documentary.

7814
03:23:11,391 --> 03:23:13,580
When occur was on top of
the world smashing people.

7815
03:23:13,730 --> 03:23:17,870
And what they found is a guy who was just
about to lose it like right when they

7816
03:23:17,871 --> 03:23:20,270
came along and started filming
it and he didn't give a fuck.

7817
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:21,020
He was,

7818
03:23:21,020 --> 03:23:23,030
he was like shooting up in front of them.

7819
03:23:23,330 --> 03:23:26,270
He was doing drugs in front
of them within any gay too.

7820
03:23:26,300 --> 03:23:26,931
Not that it matters,

7821
03:23:26,931 --> 03:23:27,764
but wasn't he getting,

7822
03:23:28,100 --> 03:23:29,090
that's never been shown.

7823
03:23:29,091 --> 03:23:30,290
I don't know if that's true or not true,

7824
03:23:30,291 --> 03:23:34,550
but he wasn't a weird relationship with
some woman and then yeah he was shooting

7825
03:23:34,551 --> 03:23:37,040
up like like actual painkillers.

7826
03:23:37,330 --> 03:23:38,163
Pharmaceutical.

7827
03:23:38,400 --> 03:23:39,580
Damn Dude.

7828
03:23:39,860 --> 03:23:42,230
It is it on everywhere.

7829
03:23:42,231 --> 03:23:43,064
It's on everything.

7830
03:23:43,160 --> 03:23:45,230
Smashing machines and everything
is probably on iTunes too.

7831
03:23:45,620 --> 03:23:46,453
It's really good.

7832
03:23:47,090 --> 03:23:50,060
How do you think this guy like I like
Woodley feels like sit on the outside.

7833
03:23:50,180 --> 03:23:53,990
No one that they want Wonderboy to fight
for the title and knowing the reality

7834
03:23:53,991 --> 03:23:58,310
is if he doesn't secure that fight with
Robbie Lawler before UFC 200 and Connor

7835
03:23:58,311 --> 03:23:59,900
knocks out though San Joe's,

7836
03:23:59,901 --> 03:24:01,080
fuck you're a couple of weeks,

7837
03:24:01,220 --> 03:24:02,270
he's in third place,

7838
03:24:02,330 --> 03:24:03,880
he's in third place and he deserves it.

7839
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:04,160
Well,

7840
03:24:04,160 --> 03:24:07,210
he's in second place
because like look wise,

7841
03:24:07,460 --> 03:24:08,300
public wise,

7842
03:24:08,360 --> 03:24:09,950
he's not in first place,

7843
03:24:09,951 --> 03:24:11,060
but like the UFC does,

7844
03:24:11,061 --> 03:24:12,020
ohm won.

7845
03:24:12,021 --> 03:24:12,231
Right?

7846
03:24:12,231 --> 03:24:13,790
So they think he's going to
fight for the title next.

7847
03:24:13,970 --> 03:24:15,290
If he does fight for the title next,

7848
03:24:15,500 --> 03:24:16,333
that's all well and good.

7849
03:24:16,350 --> 03:24:18,590
Unless Connor smashes dose on Joseph,

7850
03:24:18,591 --> 03:24:19,700
then all bets are off.

7851
03:24:19,760 --> 03:24:20,480
Everything's off.

7852
03:24:20,480 --> 03:24:21,470
Who would you put your money on?

7853
03:24:21,471 --> 03:24:22,670
Connor or Tyrone.

7854
03:24:24,680 --> 03:24:25,550
That would be crazy.

7855
03:24:25,551 --> 03:24:25,791
Right?

7856
03:24:25,791 --> 03:24:27,290
Well what good Connor due to that guy,

7857
03:24:29,490 --> 03:24:31,460
he's so fast that it
would be so hard to hit.

7858
03:24:31,580 --> 03:24:31,881
Yeah.

7859
03:24:31,881 --> 03:24:35,060
Well Tyron is a beast and he's
really good at closing the distance.

7860
03:24:35,061 --> 03:24:35,940
He's always had the car.

7861
03:24:36,940 --> 03:24:39,260
He might be able to take
Connor down at will maybe,

7862
03:24:39,390 --> 03:24:40,990
and you don't understand how long,

7863
03:24:41,530 --> 03:24:44,020
75 longer

7864
03:24:44,810 --> 03:24:45,660
take them down a wheel.

7865
03:24:45,661 --> 03:24:45,871
Right.

7866
03:24:45,871 --> 03:24:46,151
He can,

7867
03:24:46,151 --> 03:24:49,590
he can hit outside double or even
if he grabbed that really wide leg,

7868
03:24:50,190 --> 03:24:50,491
you know,

7869
03:24:50,491 --> 03:24:51,151
it's just getting,

7870
03:24:51,151 --> 03:24:54,060
getting in there is because Conor
is so fast and moved so fluidly,

7871
03:24:54,061 --> 03:24:54,500
but if he,

7872
03:24:54,500 --> 03:24:57,690
if he got ahold of them fucking he would
throw him on his head and hold them

7873
03:24:57,691 --> 03:24:58,590
there for a long time.

7874
03:24:58,650 --> 03:24:59,250
Yeah.

7875
03:24:59,250 --> 03:24:59,551
Damn.

7876
03:24:59,551 --> 03:25:01,160
Holly Holm and Misha Tate's come.

7877
03:25:01,190 --> 03:25:02,023
Come with,

7878
03:25:03,060 --> 03:25:04,050
that's an interesting fight,

7879
03:25:04,051 --> 03:25:04,884
Huh?

7880
03:25:05,780 --> 03:25:06,630
We should take it to,

7881
03:25:06,800 --> 03:25:10,170
to a dog fight and she's not
going to charge to smart.

7882
03:25:10,840 --> 03:25:11,010
Yeah.

7883
03:25:11,010 --> 03:25:12,930
She's going to turn into a
totally different kind of fight.

7884
03:25:12,960 --> 03:25:13,111
Me.

7885
03:25:13,111 --> 03:25:14,370
She hasn't fought for every cat.

7886
03:25:14,371 --> 03:25:15,204
Zingano.

7887
03:25:16,080 --> 03:25:17,100
What the fuck?

7888
03:25:17,190 --> 03:25:18,090
She had a hard time.

7889
03:25:18,510 --> 03:25:19,080
Um,

7890
03:25:19,080 --> 03:25:19,590
the uh,

7891
03:25:19,590 --> 03:25:20,580
before the Rhonda fight,

7892
03:25:20,610 --> 03:25:23,040
that crazy war that she had with um,

7893
03:25:23,330 --> 03:25:24,140
uh,

7894
03:25:24,140 --> 03:25:25,560
she knocked down Ameesha before that.

7895
03:25:26,310 --> 03:25:27,060
No,

7896
03:25:27,060 --> 03:25:27,301
no.

7897
03:25:27,301 --> 03:25:30,660
She knocked out Meesha that she hurt her
knee and then she had that Amanda Nunez

7898
03:25:30,661 --> 03:25:35,661
fight fight was chaos and the first round
she got hurt bad in the first round.

7899
03:25:35,960 --> 03:25:36,360
Bad.

7900
03:25:36,360 --> 03:25:38,760
And after that fight you
took a long time to recover.

7901
03:25:38,761 --> 03:25:39,960
Like she had a bunch of issues,

7902
03:25:40,250 --> 03:25:41,910
like mental issues after that fight.

7903
03:25:43,410 --> 03:25:43,560
Well,

7904
03:25:43,560 --> 03:25:46,410
not just that they're there
was for sure huge thing.

7905
03:25:46,411 --> 03:25:46,740
Yeah.

7906
03:25:46,740 --> 03:25:47,970
But I mean physical,

7907
03:25:47,971 --> 03:25:48,840
mental from,

7908
03:25:48,900 --> 03:25:49,770
from head trauma,

7909
03:25:49,830 --> 03:25:51,120
from getting rattled.

7910
03:25:51,310 --> 03:25:51,451
You know,

7911
03:25:51,451 --> 03:25:52,440
she had to take some time off.

7912
03:25:52,441 --> 03:25:54,000
She's taking a lot of time on the beach.

7913
03:25:54,030 --> 03:25:54,863
A fun of wow.

7914
03:25:55,010 --> 03:25:58,770
What's fought Ronda and jumped
at her and got caught on fire.

7915
03:25:58,980 --> 03:26:00,090
And did she fight after that?

7916
03:26:00,780 --> 03:26:01,100
No,

7917
03:26:01,100 --> 03:26:01,350
I don't.

7918
03:26:01,350 --> 03:26:02,183
Not that I know of,

7919
03:26:02,970 --> 03:26:03,661
but I mean she's,

7920
03:26:03,661 --> 03:26:04,110
she's,

7921
03:26:04,110 --> 03:26:04,921
she's so good,

7922
03:26:04,921 --> 03:26:06,240
but you know,

7923
03:26:06,241 --> 03:26:06,910
fight off,

7924
03:26:06,910 --> 03:26:07,560
you know,

7925
03:26:07,560 --> 03:26:08,101
what are they doing?

7926
03:26:08,101 --> 03:26:11,610
Showing us racing cars top now

7927
03:26:13,270 --> 03:26:14,680
what are you doing Talladega?

7928
03:26:14,790 --> 03:26:17,550
Is this still the UFC on Fox?

7929
03:26:17,551 --> 03:26:18,750
There was a nod ended.

7930
03:26:18,780 --> 03:26:20,490
They only do it for
the first half an hour.

7931
03:26:21,150 --> 03:26:22,650
Then they go to regular sports.

7932
03:26:23,070 --> 03:26:25,920
This is a crazy fucking
thing to do with your life.

7933
03:26:26,220 --> 03:26:28,080
Have you ever tried
riding one of those cars?

7934
03:26:28,081 --> 03:26:29,190
Have you ever been in a NASCAR?

7935
03:26:29,350 --> 03:26:31,140
I haven't and I don't give a fuck.

7936
03:26:32,670 --> 03:26:34,110
Anything with horsepower is fun.

7937
03:26:34,111 --> 03:26:37,030
But 300 it's 300 and he's
still going off that,

7938
03:26:37,031 --> 03:26:37,470
huh?

7939
03:26:37,470 --> 03:26:37,681
Yeah.

7940
03:26:37,681 --> 03:26:40,710
That's always got brewed up

7941
03:26:43,330 --> 03:26:44,360
a new movie coming out with

7942
03:26:46,110 --> 03:26:47,730
Gods of Egypt or something like that.

7943
03:26:47,880 --> 03:26:50,100
When everybody found out
his body wasn't really like,

7944
03:26:50,101 --> 03:26:50,940
it wasn't that show.

7945
03:26:50,941 --> 03:26:51,211
We were like,

7946
03:26:51,211 --> 03:26:52,044
Hey,

7947
03:26:53,250 --> 03:26:55,630
you robbed the CGI,

7948
03:26:56,720 --> 03:26:57,900
the CGI.

7949
03:26:57,901 --> 03:26:58,651
You are yoked,

7950
03:26:58,651 --> 03:26:59,484
Yo.

7951
03:26:59,550 --> 03:27:00,383
He ain't shit.

7952
03:27:00,600 --> 03:27:03,360
These cars must be so fun to drive.

7953
03:27:03,420 --> 03:27:03,541
Yeah,

7954
03:27:03,541 --> 03:27:03,811
I bet.

7955
03:27:03,811 --> 03:27:04,411
They're really fun.

7956
03:27:04,411 --> 03:27:05,221
Oh my God.

7957
03:27:05,221 --> 03:27:05,770
Could you imagine?

7958
03:27:05,770 --> 03:27:06,960
You can't get in Nascar though.

7959
03:27:07,020 --> 03:27:08,400
They go around the track power at times.

7960
03:27:08,401 --> 03:27:09,480
It just does nothing for me.

7961
03:27:09,481 --> 03:27:10,500
Have you ever been to an event?

7962
03:27:10,860 --> 03:27:11,640
No,

7963
03:27:11,640 --> 03:27:12,473
it's fine.

7964
03:27:12,840 --> 03:27:13,261
Let me guess.

7965
03:27:13,261 --> 03:27:14,340
Cars like this.

7966
03:27:15,050 --> 03:27:15,811
Fuck the cars.

7967
03:27:15,811 --> 03:27:17,880
You just walk around in
field or lock around.

7968
03:27:18,990 --> 03:27:21,440
My family has always been a UN
auditable dealership forever.

7969
03:27:21,450 --> 03:27:22,283
It used to,

7970
03:27:22,320 --> 03:27:26,610
so we would always get tickets to racist
and stuff and it's just entertaining as

7971
03:27:26,611 --> 03:27:26,851
fuck.

7972
03:27:26,851 --> 03:27:30,010
You got like 100,000 people show up to
people love it and they're die hard fan.

7973
03:27:30,011 --> 03:27:31,080
So I'm missing something.

7974
03:27:31,100 --> 03:27:32,610
Formula One is the shit.

7975
03:27:32,700 --> 03:27:32,851
Oh,

7976
03:27:32,851 --> 03:27:35,500
that's the best shit on the
plants while the war moto GP,

7977
03:27:35,530 --> 03:27:36,363
everyone's MotoGP.

7978
03:27:36,750 --> 03:27:38,370
You want to see a good documentary?

7979
03:27:38,680 --> 03:27:39,110
Um,

7980
03:27:39,110 --> 03:27:42,090
watch the documentary on art
and is called [inaudible].

7981
03:27:42,580 --> 03:27:43,271
Oh my God.

7982
03:27:43,271 --> 03:27:44,200
It's amazing.

7983
03:27:44,230 --> 03:27:45,280
He's a Brazilian,

7984
03:27:45,310 --> 03:27:48,010
a formula one driver in like the Hay Day.

7985
03:27:48,310 --> 03:27:49,720
He was a bad mother fucker.

7986
03:27:49,721 --> 03:27:50,531
Just a wild,

7987
03:27:50,531 --> 03:27:51,860
crazy reckless dude.

7988
03:27:51,861 --> 03:27:52,330
Yeah,

7989
03:27:52,330 --> 03:27:53,960
he took some mad chances.

7990
03:27:54,290 --> 03:27:56,110
It is a great already.

7991
03:27:56,580 --> 03:27:57,413
Jamie,

7992
03:27:58,050 --> 03:28:00,400
how about speaking of a

7993
03:28:03,280 --> 03:28:03,561
liver,

7994
03:28:03,561 --> 03:28:08,561
that one sketch that the Asian Nascar
driver who I promoted the hiring or

7995
03:28:10,690 --> 03:28:13,780
promoting Asian and mass card drivers
cause they would wreck in a people really

7996
03:28:13,781 --> 03:28:18,781
want to watch rex famous Asian guy
that they know they're going to look.

7997
03:28:19,181 --> 03:28:22,390
What happens when you fucking lose
control your car cause you didn't fuck up

7998
03:28:22,391 --> 03:28:23,260
rice to man.

7999
03:28:23,350 --> 03:28:24,060
Damn for sure.

8000
03:28:24,060 --> 03:28:26,890
[inaudible] we can't get Patrick.

8001
03:28:27,280 --> 03:28:28,420
Oh it's a chick.

8002
03:28:28,630 --> 03:28:29,051
Of course.

8003
03:28:29,051 --> 03:28:29,884
That's what happens.

8004
03:28:30,960 --> 03:28:31,930
Well watch that again.

8005
03:28:31,931 --> 03:28:32,860
Watch what she did.

8006
03:28:32,861 --> 03:28:34,840
Watch were cargos flying through the air.

8007
03:28:34,841 --> 03:28:35,370
Man,

8008
03:28:35,370 --> 03:28:36,203
watch this.

8009
03:28:36,330 --> 03:28:36,851
Go for it.

8010
03:28:36,851 --> 03:28:37,601
Before that though,

8011
03:28:37,601 --> 03:28:38,860
before when she gets clipped,

8012
03:28:39,510 --> 03:28:41,560
it just gives you an
idea of how fast they go.

8013
03:28:41,560 --> 03:28:42,220
Look,

8014
03:28:42,220 --> 03:28:46,510
he catches the corner and they get
our cars airborne sideways Sun.

8015
03:28:46,570 --> 03:28:48,900
I like when they yell at
each other concrete man.

8016
03:28:48,940 --> 03:28:52,090
She recovered what a rubbery finished,

8017
03:28:52,091 --> 03:28:52,750
dead last.

8018
03:28:52,750 --> 03:28:54,130
How often do they practice?

8019
03:28:54,450 --> 03:28:58,180
Like a dude demeaning hoovering
out of bad spots like that.

8020
03:28:58,480 --> 03:29:00,210
I mean that's how much
your training right?

8021
03:29:00,520 --> 03:29:01,630
Should that be part of their training?

8022
03:29:01,631 --> 03:29:03,430
But I'm sure it is.

8023
03:29:03,690 --> 03:29:04,160
I'm sure.

8024
03:29:04,160 --> 03:29:05,320
Let's say their fucking life.

8025
03:29:05,350 --> 03:29:05,501
Well,

8026
03:29:05,501 --> 03:29:09,790
they have to turn things so
you don't hit things head on,

8027
03:29:09,791 --> 03:29:11,400
you know like in that sense she,

8028
03:29:11,410 --> 03:29:11,891
she was,

8029
03:29:11,891 --> 03:29:13,120
she recovered perfectly.

8030
03:29:13,240 --> 03:29:15,640
But like when you're flying
through the air sideways like that,

8031
03:29:15,820 --> 03:29:17,230
you really can't control it.

8032
03:29:17,770 --> 03:29:18,581
When that happens.

8033
03:29:18,581 --> 03:29:23,350
Like if you're too close to a wall
and just going to hit kick it down,

8034
03:29:23,351 --> 03:29:23,891
shit's out of it.

8035
03:29:23,891 --> 03:29:24,850
You can increase your make.

8036
03:29:24,851 --> 03:29:25,684
You can gas

8037
03:29:27,310 --> 03:29:28,650
isn't the air blows.

8038
03:29:28,750 --> 03:29:29,583
That was though.

8039
03:29:29,800 --> 03:29:32,740
I mean I'm just saying that cause I slid
out in the rain in my old built Subaru.

8040
03:29:33,190 --> 03:29:34,990
Well that's the same thing
so that I can just fucking,

8041
03:29:36,540 --> 03:29:37,150
hi.

8042
03:29:37,150 --> 03:29:39,250
No you fucking head north 70
you can't do anything there.

8043
03:29:39,251 --> 03:29:43,900
She's going a hundred miles an hour faster
or 150,000 I grew up driving in snow

8044
03:29:44,220 --> 03:29:46,020
and Sun Chevrolet on the bottom coil.

8045
03:29:46,070 --> 03:29:47,230
The top Chevrolet on the bottom.

8046
03:29:47,231 --> 03:29:48,064
What does that tell you?

8047
03:29:48,380 --> 03:29:48,970
Nothing.

8048
03:29:48,970 --> 03:29:49,960
Ford right there in the middle.

8049
03:29:49,961 --> 03:29:50,794
Chevy wins.

8050
03:29:51,130 --> 03:29:53,170
Do the Toyota is the shit.

8051
03:29:53,510 --> 03:29:55,120
The Eric depends what era we're in here.

8052
03:29:55,240 --> 03:29:56,950
Daytona and Toyota's winning.

8053
03:29:57,020 --> 03:30:00,530
How isn't what it is kind of
crazy and it's bull shade.

8054
03:30:00,580 --> 03:30:04,450
Japan won best whiskey in the world
last year and also apparently the best

8055
03:30:04,451 --> 03:30:05,110
fucking NASCAR,

8056
03:30:05,110 --> 03:30:06,930
but they're not well don't
put them in Asian dry.

8057
03:30:07,030 --> 03:30:09,490
One of the most incredible
cars ever built right now.

8058
03:30:09,520 --> 03:30:13,000
The Nissan Gtr motherfuck they
have the new one that's out.

8059
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:14,900
Well they have a new batch.

8060
03:30:14,920 --> 03:30:15,753
The new one that Nis,

8061
03:30:15,760 --> 03:30:16,190
mo.

8062
03:30:16,190 --> 03:30:16,360
Yeah.

8063
03:30:16,360 --> 03:30:17,141
Nissan GTR.

8064
03:30:17,141 --> 03:30:18,400
It's 600 doors.

8065
03:30:18,401 --> 03:30:19,540
Power issues.

8066
03:30:20,590 --> 03:30:21,371
What issues?

8067
03:30:21,371 --> 03:30:22,210
It's too fast.

8068
03:30:22,230 --> 03:30:22,280
No,

8069
03:30:22,280 --> 03:30:22,351
no,

8070
03:30:22,351 --> 03:30:22,421
no,

8071
03:30:22,421 --> 03:30:22,630
no.

8072
03:30:22,630 --> 03:30:24,610
With no was the old ones
with the launch button.

8073
03:30:24,700 --> 03:30:25,533
How fast?

8074
03:30:25,590 --> 03:30:27,670
The first generation,

8075
03:30:27,820 --> 03:30:29,860
the first generation there
was just too much power.

8076
03:30:29,861 --> 03:30:30,790
They had to beef up the,

8077
03:30:31,010 --> 03:30:32,800
the transmission launch control.

8078
03:30:32,801 --> 03:30:33,760
Blow the trainee out.

8079
03:30:33,761 --> 03:30:35,300
If they did it more in a couple of times.

8080
03:30:35,301 --> 03:30:35,950
Yeah.

8081
03:30:35,950 --> 03:30:38,800
But the new ones that Nyssma
one who they say that you,

8082
03:30:38,801 --> 03:30:41,540
you're turns like defy physics.

8083
03:30:41,600 --> 03:30:41,870
Yeah.

8084
03:30:41,870 --> 03:30:42,171
Cause it's,

8085
03:30:42,171 --> 03:30:43,250
it's all wheel drive.

8086
03:30:43,251 --> 03:30:48,251
It's insanely bounce at 600 horsepowers
massive downforce on this huge wing and

8087
03:30:48,890 --> 03:30:49,131
you know,

8088
03:30:49,131 --> 03:30:50,510
it's way faster than that.

8089
03:30:50,720 --> 03:30:53,660
The new viper ACR viper just went.

8090
03:30:53,661 --> 03:30:54,650
Have you seen that thing?

8091
03:30:54,740 --> 03:30:55,431
Oh my God.

8092
03:30:55,431 --> 03:30:57,230
I watched five videos on it yesterday.

8093
03:30:57,770 --> 03:31:00,650
I watched five different videos
where they were driving on.

8094
03:31:00,840 --> 03:31:01,880
Jamie pulled that up.

8095
03:31:01,881 --> 03:31:04,730
You want to see the most
gangster carbide old viper?

8096
03:31:04,760 --> 03:31:05,250
Fuck that.

8097
03:31:05,250 --> 03:31:05,920
No.

8098
03:31:05,920 --> 03:31:07,070
This is the new one.

8099
03:31:08,540 --> 03:31:09,950
The new one is broken.

8100
03:31:09,951 --> 03:31:11,700
Every single track record,

8101
03:31:12,140 --> 03:31:14,990
every single track they've
racist thing on for time.

8102
03:31:15,110 --> 03:31:18,170
It's broken the record on how do
you understand how insane that is?

8103
03:31:18,200 --> 03:31:19,070
When does that stop?

8104
03:31:19,071 --> 03:31:19,460
How did they,

8105
03:31:19,460 --> 03:31:20,091
when does it go?

8106
03:31:20,091 --> 03:31:22,760
Zero to 60 oh zero to 60 in one second.

8107
03:31:23,000 --> 03:31:23,833
When does that happen?

8108
03:31:23,870 --> 03:31:24,071
Well,

8109
03:31:24,071 --> 03:31:26,600
it's there zero 60 this is just over to,

8110
03:31:27,050 --> 03:31:29,180
you can buy a Tesla car.

8111
03:31:29,660 --> 03:31:31,400
That is each everywhere it goes.

8112
03:31:31,410 --> 03:31:34,910
It's just be the fucking team America
song that's faster than a motorcycle.

8113
03:31:34,911 --> 03:31:36,070
Just swallowing people.

8114
03:31:36,410 --> 03:31:39,650
The handling of this
thing is fucking bananas.

8115
03:31:39,860 --> 03:31:41,210
It's more than 600 horsepower.

8116
03:31:41,211 --> 03:31:42,950
I think it's like 650 horsepower.

8117
03:31:42,951 --> 03:31:43,810
That was always the issue,

8118
03:31:43,870 --> 03:31:44,440
right?

8119
03:31:44,440 --> 03:31:44,720
Yeah.

8120
03:31:44,720 --> 03:31:47,980
The handling is off the charts
and it has the most downforce.

8121
03:31:47,990 --> 03:31:48,830
If any production car,

8122
03:31:48,950 --> 03:31:49,783
look at that hood.

8123
03:31:49,970 --> 03:31:52,490
Look at the louvers in the hood
and events and for what it is.

8124
03:31:52,491 --> 03:31:55,320
They're usually not that
expensive for the super car.

8125
03:31:55,580 --> 03:31:59,570
Take hard and if you
watch the videos on it,

8126
03:31:59,571 --> 03:32:01,130
it seems just glorious.

8127
03:32:01,160 --> 03:32:01,401
God,

8128
03:32:01,401 --> 03:32:02,710
they look fucking sweet dude.

8129
03:32:02,720 --> 03:32:04,790
Guys are driving these
things and they're just,

8130
03:32:05,310 --> 03:32:06,770
that's the only thing that
keeps you on the road,

8131
03:32:06,771 --> 03:32:07,090
Bro.

8132
03:32:07,090 --> 03:32:07,490
Yeah man.

8133
03:32:07,490 --> 03:32:08,323
That's your

8134
03:32:11,430 --> 03:32:12,740
style for looks.

8135
03:32:12,770 --> 03:32:13,790
I love the wing.

8136
03:32:14,300 --> 03:32:15,980
That thing is so fast.

8137
03:32:16,160 --> 03:32:17,570
He's put your groceries
in it and push it around.

8138
03:32:17,870 --> 03:32:18,290
Fuck.

8139
03:32:18,290 --> 03:32:19,490
They say it's the most,

8140
03:32:19,491 --> 03:32:24,170
the fastest American race car ever for
sure that you could just go to a store

8141
03:32:24,171 --> 03:32:29,000
and buy and the only cars that beat it
cost over a million dollars like like

8142
03:32:29,010 --> 03:32:29,880
this boot got here.

8143
03:32:29,960 --> 03:32:33,230
She had that for eight or
nine 18 oh I love that.

8144
03:32:33,231 --> 03:32:34,250
That's a pretty nice car.

8145
03:32:34,280 --> 03:32:35,090
Monster car,

8146
03:32:35,090 --> 03:32:39,080
but this thing is like hot on
its heels and it costs $160,000.

8147
03:32:39,230 --> 03:32:42,350
We're talking about something that loses
track time by like a 10th of a second.

8148
03:32:42,520 --> 03:32:42,830
Gosh,

8149
03:32:42,830 --> 03:32:43,990
that's the different logos.

8150
03:32:44,000 --> 03:32:46,130
Make me want to make this thing.

8151
03:32:47,360 --> 03:32:47,961
Look at that.

8152
03:32:47,961 --> 03:32:49,340
That is the coolest looking car.

8153
03:32:49,540 --> 03:32:49,871
That is,

8154
03:32:49,871 --> 03:32:52,340
that appeal so strong to
the 14 year old boy in me,

8155
03:32:52,370 --> 03:32:53,203
me to bed.

8156
03:32:53,510 --> 03:32:54,680
It's like seeing a hot chick.

8157
03:32:54,681 --> 03:32:55,850
Can they get it without the stripe?

8158
03:32:55,860 --> 03:32:56,920
No strikes.

8159
03:32:56,990 --> 03:32:58,640
Tictail tribes be a man.

8160
03:32:58,641 --> 03:33:00,290
Fuck a stylish sake.

8161
03:33:00,380 --> 03:33:01,310
I feel like I want to,

8162
03:33:01,311 --> 03:33:03,080
I want to get rid of my
Porsche and get one of those.

8163
03:33:03,110 --> 03:33:03,471
Hey,

8164
03:33:03,471 --> 03:33:03,641
look,

8165
03:33:03,641 --> 03:33:04,474
in the sake of blues,

8166
03:33:05,480 --> 03:33:06,490
don't get ready to push.

8167
03:33:06,790 --> 03:33:07,623
I hate,

8168
03:33:07,780 --> 03:33:09,110
I'm not going to just get both.

8169
03:33:09,790 --> 03:33:10,640
I like the way you think.

8170
03:33:11,370 --> 03:33:12,110
If anything,

8171
03:33:12,110 --> 03:33:12,943
I got to get a warehouse.

8172
03:33:14,140 --> 03:33:16,500
I've got to build more
wells in Africa first,

8173
03:33:16,501 --> 03:33:17,510
so I don't feel bad about it.

8174
03:33:17,630 --> 03:33:19,680
We'll just donate to Justin
dead and then we'll definitely,

8175
03:33:20,170 --> 03:33:21,110
I'm calling them tomorrow.

8176
03:33:21,111 --> 03:33:22,010
I was going to call him anyway.

8177
03:33:22,370 --> 03:33:23,630
I got to throw some more money in there.

8178
03:33:24,220 --> 03:33:25,310
I throw money in there every year.

8179
03:33:25,670 --> 03:33:26,570
He's trying to hype this.

8180
03:33:26,600 --> 03:33:27,201
You want to help them?

8181
03:33:27,201 --> 03:33:28,760
We had a hype as Kimbo fight for him.

8182
03:33:28,940 --> 03:33:29,181
Yeah,

8183
03:33:29,181 --> 03:33:30,410
well I'll definitely do that,

8184
03:33:30,411 --> 03:33:32,930
but I think I would like to
just get a bunch of people that,

8185
03:33:32,931 --> 03:33:33,141
oh,

8186
03:33:33,141 --> 03:33:33,681
is this the new,

8187
03:33:33,681 --> 03:33:34,341
the new rappers?

8188
03:33:34,341 --> 03:33:35,174
Bad Ass.

8189
03:33:35,580 --> 03:33:36,620
This is the new one.

8190
03:33:37,200 --> 03:33:37,741
Oh,

8191
03:33:37,741 --> 03:33:37,980
this is

8192
03:33:37,980 --> 03:33:39,270
the all aluminum one.

8193
03:33:39,720 --> 03:33:42,030
Why is people get talked about cars.

8194
03:33:42,031 --> 03:33:43,590
Do you know that really get mad?

8195
03:33:43,680 --> 03:33:43,891
Yeah,

8196
03:33:43,891 --> 03:33:45,290
they go good fucking money.

8197
03:33:45,291 --> 03:33:46,590
You want to talk some shit bro.

8198
03:33:47,030 --> 03:33:51,330
Guy got mad because I was saying that
a Mustang is a great bargain at $35,000

8199
03:33:51,600 --> 03:33:54,510
and he's like do $35,000
not fucking cheap.

8200
03:33:54,560 --> 03:33:56,160
A lot of us out here in the real world,

8201
03:33:56,161 --> 03:33:56,994
that rubric.

8202
03:33:59,310 --> 03:34:00,950
Well whenever you do sir,

8203
03:34:01,110 --> 03:34:05,460
don't ever watch those motor trend videos
because they'll bum you out every week

8204
03:34:05,640 --> 03:34:07,410
cause I can't afford most of those cars.

8205
03:34:07,470 --> 03:34:09,210
So you definitely can't
afford those cars either.

8206
03:34:09,211 --> 03:34:12,450
If you're complaining about
$35,000 Mustang and I get it,

8207
03:34:12,660 --> 03:34:12,901
you know,

8208
03:34:12,901 --> 03:34:14,160
if you only make like 50 grand a year,

8209
03:34:14,161 --> 03:34:14,791
that's a lot of money.

8210
03:34:14,791 --> 03:34:16,950
But you got to look at
what a Mustang is like.

8211
03:34:16,980 --> 03:34:17,671
Realistically,

8212
03:34:17,671 --> 03:34:20,100
don't put yourself into it and
how much money people make.

8213
03:34:20,340 --> 03:34:22,440
You look at a Mustang for 35 grand.

8214
03:34:22,560 --> 03:34:24,510
That is a steel steel.

8215
03:34:24,540 --> 03:34:29,490
The new jeep grand scheme of things
like on the price scale Mustang actually

8216
03:34:29,491 --> 03:34:30,120
look good.

8217
03:34:30,120 --> 03:34:32,400
This is the first generation
and mess things had been fine.

8218
03:34:32,401 --> 03:34:33,021
Like finally you've,

8219
03:34:33,021 --> 03:34:36,260
since I grew up with my dad
having a 65 four and a half,

8220
03:34:36,270 --> 03:34:41,270
they're 65 convertible with the boss
throw to putting their fucking car.

8221
03:34:41,941 --> 03:34:44,640
People at Ford mustangs
were so ugly until now.

8222
03:34:44,910 --> 03:34:48,990
They were pretty sixties they were
pretty goofy looking until like the most

8223
03:34:48,991 --> 03:34:50,460
recent Shelby gt,

8224
03:34:50,461 --> 03:34:52,550
500 items found in lever of the new ones.

8225
03:34:52,551 --> 03:34:53,430
Those are pretty sweet,

8226
03:34:53,640 --> 03:34:55,110
but the new ones are off the charts.

8227
03:34:55,111 --> 03:34:55,321
Cool.

8228
03:34:55,321 --> 03:34:57,790
Looking off the charts
for so all that noise.

8229
03:34:57,810 --> 03:34:58,800
I'm trying to hit that viper.

8230
03:34:59,310 --> 03:35:00,420
The viper is a monster.

8231
03:35:00,740 --> 03:35:03,890
Fiber's a monster but can't put a
baby seat and the vibe and you know,

8232
03:35:03,930 --> 03:35:04,940
got a base in my Porsche.

8233
03:35:04,940 --> 03:35:06,250
It's but my girls,

8234
03:35:06,251 --> 03:35:07,084
this SUV,

8235
03:35:07,440 --> 03:35:08,280
let me do my thing.

8236
03:35:08,850 --> 03:35:09,840
Let me fly.

8237
03:35:10,680 --> 03:35:12,060
Yeah and there's no AC,

8238
03:35:12,061 --> 03:35:12,720
no radio.

8239
03:35:12,720 --> 03:35:13,730
There's the NYSSMA.

8240
03:35:13,740 --> 03:35:14,573
Look at that thing.

8241
03:35:14,760 --> 03:35:16,650
Look at this fucking rocket ship.

8242
03:35:17,130 --> 03:35:17,600
Chapman.

8243
03:35:17,600 --> 03:35:19,050
Who's with the eyes compared to that vibe?

8244
03:35:19,060 --> 03:35:19,893
I think it's so ugly.

8245
03:35:20,130 --> 03:35:23,640
Oh it was definitely doesn't look as
good that Viper Shits on everything we've

8246
03:35:23,641 --> 03:35:23,980
seen.

8247
03:35:23,980 --> 03:35:24,880
What this looks like.

8248
03:35:24,881 --> 03:35:29,010
So with the GTR it looks like
is a spaceship with the viper.

8249
03:35:29,011 --> 03:35:30,060
It looks like it's sex.

8250
03:35:30,090 --> 03:35:30,331
Yes.

8251
03:35:30,331 --> 03:35:31,164
Yes.

8252
03:35:31,180 --> 03:35:32,460
It looks like hot tits.

8253
03:35:32,660 --> 03:35:36,480
It looks like a girl with a 13 inch
waist and tits as big as the sun.

8254
03:35:37,470 --> 03:35:38,041
I want to drive.

8255
03:35:38,041 --> 03:35:39,990
That makes you want to drive.

8256
03:35:40,590 --> 03:35:44,550
That's why I wanted to drive a big
ridiculous bulb has asked that didn't no

8257
03:35:44,551 --> 03:35:45,600
shorts in the world.

8258
03:35:45,601 --> 03:35:46,434
Clown tins.

8259
03:35:47,920 --> 03:35:51,330
Ttrs fucking foxy petty but just fast.

8260
03:35:51,331 --> 03:35:52,560
It's funny you said that.

8261
03:35:52,620 --> 03:35:54,090
Forget about camel toe.

8262
03:35:54,870 --> 03:35:58,050
Moose knuckle Japanese girls are fit.

8263
03:35:58,320 --> 03:35:59,240
That's what it looks like.

8264
03:36:00,130 --> 03:36:00,480
Pussy.

8265
03:36:00,480 --> 03:36:03,150
The way her daisy dukes are
wedged up in her vagina.

8266
03:36:03,151 --> 03:36:04,350
It's elephant armpit

8267
03:36:06,190 --> 03:36:07,350
snuggles generally.

8268
03:36:07,351 --> 03:36:09,770
Is that a turn on for guys when
they see a motorcycle per show?

8269
03:36:09,790 --> 03:36:10,591
He puts his definitely.

8270
03:36:10,591 --> 03:36:11,810
There I

8271
03:36:13,600 --> 03:36:13,740
am.

8272
03:36:13,740 --> 03:36:15,840
I see John put on Instagram or something.

8273
03:36:15,841 --> 03:36:17,610
I saw like there's a
thing that you could add.

8274
03:36:17,640 --> 03:36:19,530
Girls just going to
call fake moose knuckle.

8275
03:36:19,550 --> 03:36:20,060
Yes.

8276
03:36:20,060 --> 03:36:20,220
No,

8277
03:36:20,220 --> 03:36:20,371
sure.

8278
03:36:20,371 --> 03:36:20,911
That's fake.

8279
03:36:20,911 --> 03:36:21,541
But why?

8280
03:36:21,541 --> 03:36:22,530
Why is it fake?

8281
03:36:22,531 --> 03:36:23,310
Why is that a joke?

8282
03:36:23,310 --> 03:36:23,461
Well,

8283
03:36:23,461 --> 03:36:25,560
because people try
anything to get an edge.

8284
03:36:25,770 --> 03:36:26,251
They'll try.

8285
03:36:26,251 --> 03:36:28,080
Dudes will load up their
parents with have sock.

8286
03:36:28,140 --> 03:36:28,541
I mean that.

8287
03:36:28,541 --> 03:36:29,700
That's how it can't be my friend.

8288
03:36:29,701 --> 03:36:30,510
If you do that,

8289
03:36:30,510 --> 03:36:31,520
if you put a sock in your bank,

8290
03:36:31,530 --> 03:36:32,041
can't do that,

8291
03:36:32,041 --> 03:36:32,270
man.

8292
03:36:32,270 --> 03:36:33,103
I'll be right back.

8293
03:36:33,480 --> 03:36:34,590
How do we get the sum up?

8294
03:36:34,600 --> 03:36:35,810
Make the knuckles

8295
03:36:36,520 --> 03:36:36,810
fake.

8296
03:36:36,810 --> 03:36:39,010
Wedgies fake asses for sure.

8297
03:36:39,520 --> 03:36:40,600
Wedgie genes now.

8298
03:36:41,220 --> 03:36:41,481
Yes.

8299
03:36:41,481 --> 03:36:42,940
So they write up in that household.

8300
03:36:43,530 --> 03:36:44,690
So it looks like your acids.

8301
03:36:44,800 --> 03:36:48,700
Imagine smell on the crack of those
things after a long day in Mexican food.

8302
03:36:48,780 --> 03:36:49,613
It's tough.

8303
03:36:51,300 --> 03:36:52,133
It's tough.

8304
03:36:52,300 --> 03:36:52,451
Yeah,

8305
03:36:52,451 --> 03:36:53,330
there's Wedgie jeans.

8306
03:36:54,570 --> 03:36:55,840
Why not an asshole?

8307
03:36:57,570 --> 03:37:01,390
Don't press up Wedgie g that s oh,

8308
03:37:01,391 --> 03:37:06,391
I see somebody custom makes your
ass look highlights the ass shit.

8309
03:37:08,020 --> 03:37:08,853
That looks like shit.

8310
03:37:08,860 --> 03:37:09,370
How dare you.

8311
03:37:09,370 --> 03:37:10,240
How Eddie?

8312
03:37:10,420 --> 03:37:10,541
Well,

8313
03:37:10,541 --> 03:37:11,830
those are flashing negative.

8314
03:37:12,760 --> 03:37:14,540
No offense show negative either.

8315
03:37:14,650 --> 03:37:15,483
Ashlyn's pants.

8316
03:37:16,060 --> 03:37:16,930
Brendan's girl,

8317
03:37:17,020 --> 03:37:19,240
the girls pulling up their jeans nowadays.

8318
03:37:19,241 --> 03:37:21,280
Brendan's girl sat for like two years now.

8319
03:37:24,430 --> 03:37:25,320
I like the low cut.

8320
03:37:25,330 --> 03:37:26,350
I'm still with the low cut.

8321
03:37:26,410 --> 03:37:29,050
You're pulling jeans up your
ass and you fucking up the,

8322
03:37:29,051 --> 03:37:29,501
I don't know,

8323
03:37:29,501 --> 03:37:29,650
Dude.

8324
03:37:29,650 --> 03:37:30,740
Don't get angry at

8325
03:37:35,270 --> 03:37:38,590
the ball the way they're
going to end up on the floor.

8326
03:37:38,591 --> 03:37:39,011
It's fine,

8327
03:37:39,011 --> 03:37:39,341
bro.

8328
03:37:39,341 --> 03:37:40,174
Chill.

8329
03:37:42,370 --> 03:37:43,980
Nothing beats yoga pants still though.

8330
03:37:44,010 --> 03:37:44,591
Just chill.

8331
03:37:44,591 --> 03:37:48,600
Grow site on his fucking trends
or full components apart.

8332
03:37:49,060 --> 03:37:52,180
Any girl that wears anything other
than yoga pants is that asshole?

8333
03:37:52,270 --> 03:37:52,990
Yeah.

8334
03:37:52,990 --> 03:37:53,441
Good point.

8335
03:37:53,441 --> 03:37:53,960
Do you,

8336
03:37:53,960 --> 03:37:55,690
you'd know that you could
wear them everywhere.

8337
03:37:55,691 --> 03:37:56,261
We'll take it.

8338
03:37:56,261 --> 03:37:57,580
We'll accept know how the hear you.

8339
03:37:57,610 --> 03:38:01,660
Please just continue to
wear those everywhere called
leggings are just going to

8340
03:38:01,661 --> 03:38:02,340

8341
03:38:02,340 --> 03:38:02,680
Ted.

8342
03:38:02,680 --> 03:38:03,513
Do you do yoga?

8343
03:38:03,900 --> 03:38:04,733
You do yoga

8344
03:38:08,250 --> 03:38:10,770
and working out state of mind.

8345
03:38:12,840 --> 03:38:14,050
It's a form of meditation.

8346
03:38:14,080 --> 03:38:16,810
You have your daytime workout gear and
then you have your nighttime workout gear

8347
03:38:17,800 --> 03:38:18,521
and girls do.

8348
03:38:18,521 --> 03:38:21,100
Now I like to be like
sleek and move to the air.

8349
03:38:21,110 --> 03:38:22,980
Easy air dynamic.

8350
03:38:23,420 --> 03:38:24,000
Thanks.

8351
03:38:24,000 --> 03:38:24,280
Yeah,

8352
03:38:24,280 --> 03:38:24,911
it's amazing.

8353
03:38:24,911 --> 03:38:27,100
It took so long to figure out yoga pants,

8354
03:38:27,101 --> 03:38:27,460
Lala,

8355
03:38:27,460 --> 03:38:28,360
Lulu pants,

8356
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:34,750
whatever.

8357
03:38:34,750 --> 03:38:35,261
They aren't.

8358
03:38:35,261 --> 03:38:36,070
Keep going.

8359
03:38:36,070 --> 03:38:36,903
La La,

8360
03:38:37,780 --> 03:38:38,081
la,

8361
03:38:38,081 --> 03:38:38,581
La Lou,

8362
03:38:38,581 --> 03:38:40,480
Lou parents and how funny is that shit?

8363
03:38:40,600 --> 03:38:41,940
Those are huge scam.

8364
03:38:41,980 --> 03:38:45,730
They're making a fucking
killing Jesus Christ.

8365
03:38:45,880 --> 03:38:47,380
They know how to jam those bitches in.

8366
03:38:47,650 --> 03:38:48,340
They look good.

8367
03:38:48,340 --> 03:38:50,200
They straighten out all
the cellulite and shit.

8368
03:38:50,201 --> 03:38:52,180
You can't even see none
of that packet and tight.

8369
03:38:52,330 --> 03:38:52,840
And if the,

8370
03:38:52,840 --> 03:38:55,420
if the cloth is just thick enough,

8371
03:38:55,620 --> 03:38:57,250
he can hide a lot of flaws.

8372
03:38:57,660 --> 03:38:59,050
They may be a Downer here,

8373
03:38:59,200 --> 03:39:01,300
but they'll honey dick yet
cause it's like sausage.

8374
03:39:02,440 --> 03:39:03,273
You released that.

8375
03:39:03,490 --> 03:39:04,360
Yeah,

8376
03:39:04,670 --> 03:39:04,921
you're right.

8377
03:39:04,921 --> 03:39:05,170
You're right.

8378
03:39:05,170 --> 03:39:06,100
Get sloppy.

8379
03:39:06,130 --> 03:39:06,491
You're right.

8380
03:39:06,491 --> 03:39:06,790
You're right.

8381
03:39:06,790 --> 03:39:07,271
So thin.

8382
03:39:07,271 --> 03:39:08,104
You know what I'm saying?

8383
03:39:10,850 --> 03:39:11,571
With holes in them.

8384
03:39:11,571 --> 03:39:12,404
So

8385
03:39:13,660 --> 03:39:14,560
there's a little velcro.

8386
03:39:14,561 --> 03:39:16,300
You just go like that band.

8387
03:39:16,301 --> 03:39:17,590
You don't ever have to take them off.

8388
03:39:17,640 --> 03:39:18,720
Lou Lou Lou mall.

8389
03:39:19,900 --> 03:39:20,231
Yeah.

8390
03:39:20,231 --> 03:39:22,420
There's something about
those fucking yoga pants,

8391
03:39:22,421 --> 03:39:23,254
man.

8392
03:39:23,650 --> 03:39:27,130
It's amazing how dumb they were in the
60s and the 70s never figured out any of

8393
03:39:27,131 --> 03:39:29,620
this shit until the dukes
of Hazzard came along.

8394
03:39:29,740 --> 03:39:31,730
Then everyone figured out cutoff jeans.

8395
03:39:32,090 --> 03:39:34,850
Now daisy overnight cut the jeans off.

8396
03:39:34,851 --> 03:39:35,840
As soon as they figured out that,

8397
03:39:35,841 --> 03:39:40,400
oh you could basically just have your
vagina a slight tug away cause all you

8398
03:39:40,401 --> 03:39:42,410
have to do if you want to fuck
his girl was wearing daisy dukes.

8399
03:39:42,470 --> 03:39:43,291
She bends over you.

8400
03:39:43,291 --> 03:39:44,120
I those,

8401
03:39:44,120 --> 03:39:45,200
those jeans are pretty tight.

8402
03:39:45,230 --> 03:39:46,063
There's the moon.

8403
03:39:46,180 --> 03:39:47,013
It's not that easy.

8404
03:39:47,720 --> 03:39:49,360
The giants with underwear.

8405
03:39:49,480 --> 03:39:50,313
Yes.

8406
03:39:50,850 --> 03:39:55,850
Jean unbuttoned that button one button
dunk and you push that pitch oversight.

8407
03:39:57,140 --> 03:39:57,281
See,

8408
03:39:57,281 --> 03:39:58,730
but then dirty ones,

8409
03:39:58,900 --> 03:39:59,181
Eddie,

8410
03:39:59,181 --> 03:40:00,140
but she's hurt.

8411
03:40:00,170 --> 03:40:02,030
You see daisy Duke had the right thing.

8412
03:40:02,210 --> 03:40:03,260
See the girls today?

8413
03:40:03,261 --> 03:40:04,041
They were daisy dukes,

8414
03:40:04,041 --> 03:40:04,741
but they're so tight.

8415
03:40:04,741 --> 03:40:05,574
You came and get them off.

8416
03:40:05,870 --> 03:40:07,550
Daisy dukes were not
that were falling off.

8417
03:40:07,551 --> 03:40:08,201
Looking at CCC.

8418
03:40:08,201 --> 03:40:09,034
CCC

8419
03:40:10,070 --> 03:40:12,840
told you those things are kind of loose.

8420
03:40:13,340 --> 03:40:17,540
One pop of that brass button and
that cooters flying into the breeze.

8421
03:40:17,890 --> 03:40:18,900
Right through action.

8422
03:40:18,960 --> 03:40:20,750
Do you see Jessica Simpson and the remake?

8423
03:40:21,170 --> 03:40:23,720
She has something to say
to Sheila had no ass.

8424
03:40:23,770 --> 03:40:25,280
How it really help Eddie,

8425
03:40:25,281 --> 03:40:26,120
you're so negative.

8426
03:40:26,180 --> 03:40:26,331
Oh,

8427
03:40:26,331 --> 03:40:26,991
she does?

8428
03:40:26,991 --> 03:40:27,350
Yeah,

8429
03:40:27,350 --> 03:40:27,801
she got her.

8430
03:40:27,801 --> 03:40:29,900
You got the car too.

8431
03:40:30,370 --> 03:40:31,330
Fast forward.

8432
03:40:32,160 --> 03:40:34,850
That's just a Samson way,

8433
03:40:35,510 --> 03:40:35,751
dude.

8434
03:40:35,751 --> 03:40:36,584
Her assets,

8435
03:40:37,100 --> 03:40:37,933
Jessica's

8436
03:40:40,460 --> 03:40:40,730
love.

8437
03:40:40,730 --> 03:40:41,870
She was young right there.

8438
03:40:41,871 --> 03:40:42,231
What's that?

8439
03:40:42,231 --> 03:40:43,450
Is that Jessica Simpson's Pam.

8440
03:40:43,451 --> 03:40:44,030
Whoa.

8441
03:40:44,030 --> 03:40:45,490
Oh Shit.

8442
03:40:45,530 --> 03:40:46,261
Whatever that is,

8443
03:40:46,261 --> 03:40:47,240
and she's a good time.

8444
03:40:47,270 --> 03:40:48,440
She was a good kid.

8445
03:40:49,000 --> 03:40:49,350
Okay.

8446
03:40:49,350 --> 03:40:52,100
See just Google Jessica
Simpson's and ass please.

8447
03:40:52,150 --> 03:40:52,690
Yes.

8448
03:40:52,690 --> 03:40:53,290
Yes.

8449
03:40:53,290 --> 03:40:57,680
She was just very top of all
time as my grandmother would say.

8450
03:40:57,680 --> 03:40:58,880
She has a lovely figure.

8451
03:40:59,030 --> 03:40:59,780
Yes.

8452
03:40:59,780 --> 03:41:00,610
Your grandma's right.

8453
03:41:00,610 --> 03:41:01,041
Wow.

8454
03:41:01,041 --> 03:41:01,821
I missed that one.

8455
03:41:01,821 --> 03:41:02,601
I never lovely.

8456
03:41:02,601 --> 03:41:03,434
Never knew that.

8457
03:41:03,800 --> 03:41:07,070
Real big neck naked in pregnant.

8458
03:41:07,100 --> 03:41:07,251
Yeah.

8459
03:41:07,251 --> 03:41:08,130
Get a good bullshit.

8460
03:41:08,510 --> 03:41:10,270
Let's just click on any
one that's hard to tell.

8461
03:41:10,271 --> 03:41:11,660
Is that she was so fine.

8462
03:41:12,710 --> 03:41:14,200
That's her tell.

8463
03:41:14,360 --> 03:41:15,490
That's a Jessica Simpson.

8464
03:41:17,430 --> 03:41:19,330
I really can't tell that you really am.

8465
03:41:20,620 --> 03:41:22,160
Logos are low left.

8466
03:41:22,161 --> 03:41:25,500
I'm very impressed with
to choose a banger.

8467
03:41:25,700 --> 03:41:26,241
Low left.

8468
03:41:26,241 --> 03:41:27,074
Looks very good.

8469
03:41:27,660 --> 03:41:28,760
That could be the angle.

8470
03:41:28,790 --> 03:41:29,780
Her and her prime man.

8471
03:41:29,790 --> 03:41:31,130
She top 10 for,

8472
03:41:31,131 --> 03:41:32,270
what about the pregnant ones?

8473
03:41:32,330 --> 03:41:32,511
Oh,

8474
03:41:32,511 --> 03:41:33,230
that's pretty good.

8475
03:41:33,230 --> 03:41:34,063
Okay.

8476
03:41:34,070 --> 03:41:34,611
Get stressed.

8477
03:41:34,611 --> 03:41:35,444
That bitch out Jamie.

8478
03:41:36,290 --> 03:41:38,750
That seems like an angel to that is her.

8479
03:41:38,900 --> 03:41:39,201
Is that,

8480
03:41:39,201 --> 03:41:39,441
oh,

8481
03:41:39,441 --> 03:41:40,800
she does answer bro.

8482
03:41:41,890 --> 03:41:43,010
That's that swimsuit model,

8483
03:41:43,040 --> 03:41:44,510
but that's not her.

8484
03:41:44,540 --> 03:41:45,373
That's not her.

8485
03:41:46,150 --> 03:41:49,340
That's the one from [inaudible] recording
everything that's good in the world.

8486
03:41:49,341 --> 03:41:50,310
So is the pregnant girl.

8487
03:41:50,310 --> 03:41:51,143
I'm talking

8488
03:41:52,580 --> 03:41:53,413
Sarah.

8489
03:41:54,280 --> 03:41:55,400
That's a very,

8490
03:41:55,430 --> 03:41:55,940
I wouldn't,

8491
03:41:55,940 --> 03:41:57,590
I wouldn't have any
problems with that booty.

8492
03:41:58,400 --> 03:41:59,233
That's a good booty.

8493
03:42:00,140 --> 03:42:00,440
All right.

8494
03:42:00,440 --> 03:42:01,960
How about right there at
the blue pants that were,

8495
03:42:02,030 --> 03:42:02,211
well,

8496
03:42:02,211 --> 03:42:03,350
who's got the best ass ever?

8497
03:42:03,351 --> 03:42:05,670
Is that ever been established via Greer?

8498
03:42:06,350 --> 03:42:07,010
Dude?

8499
03:42:07,010 --> 03:42:07,400
Oh,

8500
03:42:07,400 --> 03:42:07,940
what can Eddie,

8501
03:42:07,940 --> 03:42:08,990
we get a high five for this.

8502
03:42:09,350 --> 03:42:10,183
People know bad.

8503
03:42:11,360 --> 03:42:16,360
She used to be the booty girl before the
Instagram days before she was doing a

8504
03:42:16,720 --> 03:42:17,200
poster.

8505
03:42:17,200 --> 03:42:17,840
She crushed it.

8506
03:42:17,840 --> 03:42:19,700
She still is.

8507
03:42:19,820 --> 03:42:20,653
She has an Instagram.

8508
03:42:21,590 --> 03:42:22,940
She's 42 now,

8509
03:42:22,941 --> 03:42:27,320
but still dime piece 30 42 oh good Lord.

8510
03:42:27,380 --> 03:42:27,741
Okay.

8511
03:42:27,741 --> 03:42:28,574
She wins.

8512
03:42:29,030 --> 03:42:29,721
She just wants,

8513
03:42:29,721 --> 03:42:30,620
you weren't ready for that.

8514
03:42:30,770 --> 03:42:31,140
Wow.

8515
03:42:31,140 --> 03:42:31,941
You boys weren't ready.

8516
03:42:31,941 --> 03:42:32,774
It's insane.

8517
03:42:32,940 --> 03:42:36,150
Isn't it amazing that like the
shape is worth so much more.

8518
03:42:36,180 --> 03:42:40,440
She lives in La to like having a big
ag about having shape like that to your

8519
03:42:40,890 --> 03:42:41,481
fake asses.

8520
03:42:41,481 --> 03:42:42,270
It's weird.

8521
03:42:42,270 --> 03:42:46,800
No fake ass is that will not accept
fake gas will really not at all.

8522
03:42:47,160 --> 03:42:47,993
Very

8523
03:42:49,970 --> 03:42:50,780
fake asses.

8524
03:42:50,780 --> 03:42:52,170
Like I gotta take this wing off.

8525
03:42:52,171 --> 03:42:53,190
I don't care for protecting me.

8526
03:42:53,590 --> 03:42:54,670
That shit don't make me look good.

8527
03:42:56,850 --> 03:42:57,560
I'm not sick.

8528
03:42:57,560 --> 03:42:58,710
I don't want like the implants.

8529
03:42:58,711 --> 03:43:00,990
But when they put the
fat like the cellulite,

8530
03:43:02,820 --> 03:43:04,770
have you done what I saw?

8531
03:43:04,771 --> 03:43:05,371
What they look like?

8532
03:43:05,371 --> 03:43:06,080
It looks horrible.

8533
03:43:06,080 --> 03:43:06,750
Nah,

8534
03:43:06,750 --> 03:43:07,260
it does.

8535
03:43:07,260 --> 03:43:09,430
The ASCE has to be natural to all mine.

8536
03:43:10,170 --> 03:43:10,321
Look,

8537
03:43:10,321 --> 03:43:11,510
you've been out of the game too long ago.

8538
03:43:12,450 --> 03:43:13,290
It's really simple.

8539
03:43:13,310 --> 03:43:14,790
You to stick with you boys.

8540
03:43:15,200 --> 03:43:16,140
Let it checks.

8541
03:43:16,141 --> 03:43:16,974
That's it.

8542
03:43:17,350 --> 03:43:19,040
It's like to backup quarterback's.

8543
03:43:19,060 --> 03:43:21,330
I'm at a play that's not a full gas.

8544
03:43:22,730 --> 03:43:23,800
That's all right.

8545
03:43:24,340 --> 03:43:25,380
You're out of your mind.

8546
03:43:29,920 --> 03:43:30,960
All you have to do squats,

8547
03:43:30,961 --> 03:43:31,710
tits you have,

8548
03:43:31,710 --> 03:43:33,900
you have to fake it sometimes
cause there's nothing you can do,

8549
03:43:34,050 --> 03:43:35,400
but acid you can build.

8550
03:43:35,460 --> 03:43:36,420
You just squat.

8551
03:43:36,450 --> 03:43:37,290
Now you can just tell that

8552
03:43:39,800 --> 03:43:43,440
it's your new lifestyle squat
and I say carbs and I skate.

8553
03:43:43,780 --> 03:43:44,613
Skate,

8554
03:43:45,920 --> 03:43:46,900
skate it.

8555
03:43:55,070 --> 03:43:57,570
You should have a tee shirt that you sell.

8556
03:43:57,630 --> 03:43:58,200
Itches.

8557
03:43:58,200 --> 03:44:00,950
It says Eddie Bravo mouth open.

8558
03:44:01,260 --> 03:44:02,550
He's a blazing

8559
03:44:05,210 --> 03:44:06,990
and squat.

8560
03:44:06,991 --> 03:44:07,824
Squatting is hard,

8561
03:44:07,920 --> 03:44:08,880
but once a week

8562
03:44:11,080 --> 03:44:11,790
it is,

8563
03:44:11,790 --> 03:44:13,080
but you can change it.

8564
03:44:13,410 --> 03:44:14,700
You can improve upon.

8565
03:44:14,730 --> 03:44:16,400
You can tighten it,

8566
03:44:16,430 --> 03:44:18,750
you can tighten it and
you could make it rounder.

8567
03:44:19,290 --> 03:44:20,220
You take any chick,

8568
03:44:20,240 --> 03:44:25,240
any flat ass Chicco who skipped PE class
wed ditching notes and it never went.

8569
03:44:26,280 --> 03:44:27,600
You take a 23

8570
03:44:29,690 --> 03:44:30,523
whatever.

8571
03:44:30,870 --> 03:44:32,930
You take her at 25 she,

8572
03:44:32,980 --> 03:44:36,180
she realized she fucked up
by fucking skipping PE class.

8573
03:44:36,181 --> 03:44:36,631
She really,

8574
03:44:36,631 --> 03:44:39,190
she really likes shat
all the nerdy chicks.

8575
03:44:39,200 --> 03:44:41,040
We're playing soccer now
that out of the kids.

8576
03:44:41,460 --> 03:44:44,010
But if they go to fucking Colorado,

8577
03:44:44,040 --> 03:44:45,480
find the Olympic squat team,

8578
03:44:45,930 --> 03:44:48,150
go do some squats for fucking two years.

8579
03:44:48,180 --> 03:44:49,110
I don't make a big difference.

8580
03:44:49,111 --> 03:44:49,890
Trust me.

8581
03:44:49,890 --> 03:44:50,161
Right.

8582
03:44:50,161 --> 03:44:51,360
But it ain't [inaudible] Guerra.

8583
03:44:51,361 --> 03:44:52,194
You gotta be kidding.

8584
03:44:54,130 --> 03:44:56,730
Inject some steroids to the ass,

8585
03:44:56,980 --> 03:44:57,813
right into the ass,

8586
03:44:58,560 --> 03:44:59,221
right at the boat.

8587
03:44:59,221 --> 03:45:00,054
Checks every day.

8588
03:45:00,990 --> 03:45:01,621
And then squat,

8589
03:45:01,621 --> 03:45:01,920
squat,

8590
03:45:01,920 --> 03:45:03,650
squat swatch about two,

8591
03:45:04,740 --> 03:45:05,281
three years.

8592
03:45:05,281 --> 03:45:05,430
There's,

8593
03:45:05,430 --> 03:45:07,950
you're going to see a big dip and she's
going to have a dick that she could drop

8594
03:45:07,951 --> 03:45:09,630
on your forehead while
she rides your face.

8595
03:45:11,850 --> 03:45:14,010
It's called surgery done in Brazil.

8596
03:45:14,011 --> 03:45:15,060
It's in the water man.

8597
03:45:15,210 --> 03:45:17,100
They have to walk up and
touch Garson right now.

8598
03:45:17,130 --> 03:45:20,010
She's in this new short film that
just showed up online the other day.

8599
03:45:20,130 --> 03:45:20,660
That's a pencil.

8600
03:45:20,660 --> 03:45:21,091
Anderson.

8601
03:45:21,091 --> 03:45:21,924
Yeah,

8602
03:45:22,550 --> 03:45:24,180
she's playing a character or something,

8603
03:45:24,181 --> 03:45:25,200
but oh,

8604
03:45:25,201 --> 03:45:26,580
this is that new film.

8605
03:45:26,581 --> 03:45:27,830
It's supposed to be like really strange.

8606
03:45:27,831 --> 03:45:28,170
They,

8607
03:45:28,170 --> 03:45:29,003
they did a piece,

8608
03:45:29,200 --> 03:45:29,311
it,

8609
03:45:29,311 --> 03:45:30,700
it was it one of those um,

8610
03:45:30,760 --> 03:45:31,430
online,

8611
03:45:31,430 --> 03:45:31,900
um,

8612
03:45:31,900 --> 03:45:32,890
things that a piece on it,

8613
03:45:32,891 --> 03:45:37,420
like a lot of it is like her wearing no
makeup and it's pretty like gritty and

8614
03:45:37,421 --> 03:45:37,990
real.

8615
03:45:37,990 --> 03:45:38,823
Whoa.

8616
03:45:39,190 --> 03:45:39,790
Damn.

8617
03:45:39,790 --> 03:45:40,550
Yeah.

8618
03:45:40,550 --> 03:45:41,860
It's a hard world man.

8619
03:45:42,040 --> 03:45:46,420
It's interesting what these girls
become like cause they go from being the

8620
03:45:46,421 --> 03:45:49,960
hottest thing in the world where everybody
wants to fuck them to being like,

8621
03:45:49,961 --> 03:45:50,351
you know,

8622
03:45:50,351 --> 03:45:51,310
an older lady,

8623
03:45:52,210 --> 03:45:52,630
Lydia,

8624
03:45:52,630 --> 03:45:52,871
dude,

8625
03:45:52,871 --> 03:45:52,991
it's,

8626
03:45:52,991 --> 03:45:54,220
everybody goes to it.

8627
03:45:54,880 --> 03:45:55,451
But women,

8628
03:45:55,451 --> 03:45:58,030
especially women especially man tame it.

8629
03:45:58,230 --> 03:45:58,990
It's a motherfucker.

8630
03:45:58,990 --> 03:46:00,430
Especially like Pamela Anderson for sure.

8631
03:46:00,460 --> 03:46:00,761
Carmen,

8632
03:46:00,761 --> 03:46:01,211
Electra,

8633
03:46:01,211 --> 03:46:02,740
all these beautiful actresses.

8634
03:46:02,800 --> 03:46:05,440
I remember when I moved from
Orange County to Hollywood,

8635
03:46:05,620 --> 03:46:06,460
I thought,

8636
03:46:06,461 --> 03:46:07,480
what am I going to bring?

8637
03:46:07,720 --> 03:46:09,670
And I brought a couple porno mags.

8638
03:46:09,671 --> 03:46:12,160
I was 21 and I didn't know who Pam is.

8639
03:46:13,300 --> 03:46:14,290
I didn't know who she was.

8640
03:46:14,330 --> 03:46:15,190
It was 1991.

8641
03:46:15,191 --> 03:46:18,350
She was on the cover of playboy and
like I'm bringing this motherfucking one

8642
03:46:18,351 --> 03:46:19,540
because I don't know who that girl was.

8643
03:46:19,541 --> 03:46:20,500
I never looked her name up.

8644
03:46:20,650 --> 03:46:22,180
It turns out she was Pamela Anderson.

8645
03:46:22,360 --> 03:46:22,840
Oh look at this.

8646
03:46:22,840 --> 03:46:24,400
She's like walking on the beach,

8647
03:46:24,640 --> 03:46:29,640
Venice hot young girls in their little
skimpy things and they've gotten very

8648
03:46:29,891 --> 03:46:30,540
little makeup,

8649
03:46:30,540 --> 03:46:31,450
had a great life.

8650
03:46:31,480 --> 03:46:32,030
How old is she?

8651
03:46:32,030 --> 03:46:32,800
She had a great life.

8652
03:46:32,800 --> 03:46:34,120
I a look at the big sigh.

8653
03:46:34,210 --> 03:46:37,320
She's looking at it and she's drinking
juices and Shit to look young just is

8654
03:46:37,330 --> 03:46:38,290

8655
03:46:38,291 --> 03:46:39,030

8656
03:46:39,030 --> 03:46:39,560
Whoa.

8657
03:46:39,560 --> 03:46:43,270
Incense sense and trying
to get her mind right now.

8658
03:46:43,310 --> 03:46:44,143
Mass Day.

8659
03:46:44,500 --> 03:46:45,700
She's still got good hair.

8660
03:46:46,030 --> 03:46:46,863
She's a pretty girl.

8661
03:46:47,650 --> 03:46:48,483
But

8662
03:46:50,140 --> 03:46:52,630
when that's your whole
world like never had kids.

8663
03:46:52,631 --> 03:46:53,464
No cats.

8664
03:46:54,370 --> 03:46:54,881
She has,

8665
03:46:54,881 --> 03:46:56,940
she has two songs I like show.

8666
03:46:57,640 --> 03:46:59,990
I like when they show a spike
and we need to and shit.

8667
03:47:00,890 --> 03:47:01,723
Tommy Lee,

8668
03:47:01,750 --> 03:47:02,583
I like,

8669
03:47:04,580 --> 03:47:05,860
I like it when they show her smoking weed.

8670
03:47:05,861 --> 03:47:07,660
She was like sitting down like it's over.

8671
03:47:07,661 --> 03:47:08,790
She was like crumpled dude.

8672
03:47:08,810 --> 03:47:09,820
That was how bummer.

8673
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:10,600
Did you know what,

8674
03:47:10,600 --> 03:47:10,870
what?

8675
03:47:10,870 --> 03:47:12,430
I met Pam Anderson once.

8676
03:47:12,910 --> 03:47:15,910
Her brother's an old
friend of mine and we were,

8677
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:17,490
we were doing some work together whenever,

8678
03:47:17,491 --> 03:47:17,920
when I went,

8679
03:47:17,920 --> 03:47:20,320
she lived in Malibu at the
height of Pamela Anderson.

8680
03:47:20,360 --> 03:47:20,710
You know,

8681
03:47:20,710 --> 03:47:21,520
she was different.

8682
03:47:21,520 --> 03:47:22,390
She was dating.

8683
03:47:22,630 --> 03:47:23,580
It was after Tom.

8684
03:47:23,581 --> 03:47:23,710
I,

8685
03:47:23,710 --> 03:47:25,320
but she was dating Marcus Shankin Berg.

8686
03:47:25,330 --> 03:47:28,990
He was a supermodel six foot five and
me and her brother were in the back

8687
03:47:28,991 --> 03:47:30,640
smoking weed and he comes back and goes,

8688
03:47:30,641 --> 03:47:30,851
hey,

8689
03:47:30,851 --> 03:47:32,770
do you mind if I have a couple
of folks to that weight?

8690
03:47:32,950 --> 03:47:36,280
So we're sitting back and I'll
never forget thinking this guy,

8691
03:47:36,310 --> 03:47:39,630
I would never have my girl
around this motherfucker.

8692
03:47:39,640 --> 03:47:40,660
I was so blown away.

8693
03:47:40,661 --> 03:47:40,811
I'm like,

8694
03:47:40,811 --> 03:47:41,291
holy,

8695
03:47:41,291 --> 03:47:42,550
she's a giant piece dude.

8696
03:47:42,551 --> 03:47:43,570
Six foot five.

8697
03:47:43,660 --> 03:47:44,800
He Alan's you Bob.

8698
03:47:44,801 --> 03:47:46,180
It'd be scared of this easy.

8699
03:47:46,181 --> 03:47:48,310
Let's say Alan can fight.

8700
03:47:48,350 --> 03:47:49,510
Marcus Shanken Berg

8701
03:47:51,310 --> 03:47:54,280
intimidated when he busted his ass

8702
03:47:56,670 --> 03:47:56,860
gay.

8703
03:47:56,860 --> 03:47:58,580
His picture that anybody's ever taken.

8704
03:48:01,110 --> 03:48:02,830
This guy's intimidating.

8705
03:48:04,750 --> 03:48:05,170
No,

8706
03:48:05,170 --> 03:48:05,411
no.

8707
03:48:05,411 --> 03:48:06,520
He's too gay looking.

8708
03:48:08,200 --> 03:48:09,033
One of the gates.

8709
03:48:09,450 --> 03:48:10,540
That dude up poses

8710
03:48:12,950 --> 03:48:13,531
to death.

8711
03:48:13,531 --> 03:48:16,960
Do you know that he's
done [inaudible] come on.

8712
03:48:16,961 --> 03:48:17,501
Handsome guy.

8713
03:48:17,501 --> 03:48:18,221
No doubt about it.

8714
03:48:18,221 --> 03:48:19,150
Foot five.

8715
03:48:20,380 --> 03:48:22,960
He looks too like he's a handsome fellow.

8716
03:48:23,260 --> 03:48:24,930
It just got to stop with the [inaudible].

8717
03:48:25,290 --> 03:48:25,870
Think about this.

8718
03:48:25,870 --> 03:48:27,940
He got Pamela Anderson Enterprise.

8719
03:48:27,980 --> 03:48:28,813
Welcome to the club,

8720
03:48:29,560 --> 03:48:30,000
the club.

8721
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:32,760
You also probably got a lot of things
that she was carrying along with it for

8722
03:48:32,770 --> 03:48:33,603
the,

8723
03:48:33,890 --> 03:48:34,723

Tell me.

8725
03:48:36,080 --> 03:48:36,351
They said,

8726
03:48:36,351 --> 03:48:37,250
here's who is there you go.

8727
03:48:37,270 --> 03:48:38,001
How old is she?

8728
03:48:38,001 --> 03:48:38,900
50 something now.

8729
03:48:39,530 --> 03:48:43,640
Now she's probably like close to 50
you seen Cindy Crawford hot as fuck.

8730
03:48:43,700 --> 03:48:44,533
Yeah.

8731
03:48:44,630 --> 03:48:46,580
Let's see what it looks like right now.

8732
03:48:46,581 --> 03:48:49,520
Her in person at a party
less than a year ago.

8733
03:48:49,521 --> 03:48:50,061
She's beautiful.

8734
03:48:50,061 --> 03:48:52,340
I saw her six months ago
off Santa Monica and I,

8735
03:48:52,370 --> 03:48:52,940
it's the,

8736
03:48:52,940 --> 03:48:54,290
I can't remember last
time I looked at it girl,

8737
03:48:54,291 --> 03:48:54,890
I was like,

8738
03:48:54,890 --> 03:48:57,470
oh my kid ourself usually Kippy off.

8739
03:48:57,470 --> 03:48:58,880
She's not self destructive,

8740
03:48:59,210 --> 03:48:59,481
you know?

8741
03:48:59,481 --> 03:49:00,550
And she's been smaller.

8742
03:49:00,551 --> 03:49:01,970
Treasury has been smart about that.

8743
03:49:01,971 --> 03:49:02,900
They'll skim cream.

8744
03:49:03,340 --> 03:49:06,600
Christie,

8745
03:49:06,600 --> 03:49:06,601
Christie Brinkley,

8746
03:49:06,601 --> 03:49:08,060
60 fucking two years old.

8747
03:49:08,590 --> 03:49:09,423
Like,

8748
03:49:09,490 --> 03:49:10,760
I mean that's a far shot.

8749
03:49:10,761 --> 03:49:12,620
We need to listen to me,

8750
03:49:12,621 --> 03:49:12,861
man.

8751
03:49:12,861 --> 03:49:13,670
I met her.

8752
03:49:13,670 --> 03:49:14,211
I was talking.

8753
03:49:14,211 --> 03:49:15,044
I've seen her first.

8754
03:49:15,070 --> 03:49:16,350
It was a dark part.

8755
03:49:16,700 --> 03:49:16,960
Nah,

8756
03:49:16,960 --> 03:49:17,550
she's a dynamo.

8757
03:49:17,550 --> 03:49:18,540
He said outside.

8758
03:49:18,560 --> 03:49:19,340
I saw daytime,

8759
03:49:19,340 --> 03:49:20,480
daytime Santa Monica.

8760
03:49:20,481 --> 03:49:21,450
Fuck you talking about bitch.

8761
03:49:21,760 --> 03:49:22,550
Who was in light?

8762
03:49:22,550 --> 03:49:23,120
Light,

8763
03:49:23,120 --> 03:49:23,360
light.

8764
03:49:23,360 --> 03:49:24,260
Look at that one right there.

8765
03:49:24,470 --> 03:49:27,770
How dare you do Cheese 50 Eddie?

8766
03:49:27,910 --> 03:49:28,220
Well,

8767
03:49:28,220 --> 03:49:28,770
what?

8768
03:49:28,770 --> 03:49:30,620
You know what Christie
Brinkley's just as hot.

8769
03:49:30,621 --> 03:49:31,580
She's a decade older.

8770
03:49:31,581 --> 03:49:32,414
How about that?

8771
03:49:32,730 --> 03:49:33,470
Here's a picture.

8772
03:49:33,470 --> 03:49:35,270
I used to have a picture
of Cindy Crawford,

8773
03:49:35,290 --> 03:49:37,190
a poster of Cindy Crawford up in my room.

8774
03:49:37,191 --> 03:49:38,570
That was like my inspiration.

8775
03:49:38,571 --> 03:49:38,870
I was like,

8776
03:49:38,870 --> 03:49:40,280
Oh yeah,

8777
03:49:40,281 --> 03:49:40,491
like,

8778
03:49:40,491 --> 03:49:41,010
I'm like,

8779
03:49:41,010 --> 03:49:41,843
that's why

8780
03:49:45,120 --> 03:49:47,020
you me just wanting to fuck her.

8781
03:49:47,021 --> 03:49:47,610
That's like,

8782
03:49:47,610 --> 03:49:48,210
it's like he wanted,

8783
03:49:48,210 --> 03:49:49,040
it's going to work out.

8784
03:49:49,040 --> 03:49:49,360
One day.

8785
03:49:49,360 --> 03:49:50,160
I fuck her.

8786
03:49:50,160 --> 03:49:52,390
One day I will one day

8787
03:49:54,690 --> 03:49:55,330
I say,

8788
03:49:55,330 --> 03:49:55,590
no,

8789
03:49:55,590 --> 03:49:57,710
that's the girl broke my toes.

8790
03:49:57,770 --> 03:49:58,603
That's the one.

8791
03:49:58,860 --> 03:49:59,280
Well that's,

8792
03:49:59,280 --> 03:50:00,200
that's one thing.

8793
03:50:00,650 --> 03:50:02,030
But you look at a Christie Brinkley,

8794
03:50:02,031 --> 03:50:03,110
they took a picture of a recently,

8795
03:50:03,320 --> 03:50:07,610
she was 62 in New York and she looks
like she's a really hot 34 year old.

8796
03:50:07,730 --> 03:50:08,590
She must found that,

8797
03:50:08,780 --> 03:50:09,650
that shit your time.

8798
03:50:09,651 --> 03:50:10,610
Now that technology,

8799
03:50:11,330 --> 03:50:12,163
um,

8800
03:50:13,070 --> 03:50:13,960
she's a dynamo.

8801
03:50:14,620 --> 03:50:17,900
She probably doing every trick
in the book the right way.

8802
03:50:19,210 --> 03:50:20,890
He puts it in her fucking skin cream.

8803
03:50:21,030 --> 03:50:21,400
Good.

8804
03:50:21,400 --> 03:50:23,510
Something to look into
that her skin creams,

8805
03:50:24,340 --> 03:50:25,520
picture telling everybody.

8806
03:50:25,521 --> 03:50:26,630
This is how I stay young.

8807
03:50:26,780 --> 03:50:29,870
I put some Papaya juice on my face and
she's not going to tell those young

8808
03:50:31,880 --> 03:50:32,690
boomer shorts.

8809
03:50:32,690 --> 03:50:33,740
She sells the shit.

8810
03:50:33,770 --> 03:50:35,420
Cindy Crawford has skin cream.

8811
03:50:35,450 --> 03:50:36,800
It was just a picture of her recent.

8812
03:50:36,801 --> 03:50:39,420
She's 62 that's not a good
picture is a better picture of it.

8813
03:50:39,421 --> 03:50:39,800
Treating me.

8814
03:50:39,800 --> 03:50:40,930
Good ones there.

8815
03:50:41,650 --> 03:50:44,420
That's her picture of her
and our 62nd birthday.

8816
03:50:44,480 --> 03:50:44,950
No,

8817
03:50:44,950 --> 03:50:45,820
that's too much sugar.

8818
03:50:46,040 --> 03:50:46,970
She's old as fuck.

8819
03:50:47,030 --> 03:50:47,610
There's a really,

8820
03:50:47,610 --> 03:50:48,620
really recent picture.

8821
03:50:48,621 --> 03:50:52,670
It's like Christie Brinkley honor 62nd
birthday and she's like in a car and

8822
03:50:52,671 --> 03:50:53,061
you'll look at her,

8823
03:50:53,061 --> 03:50:53,490
you'll go,

8824
03:50:53,490 --> 03:50:54,323
why?

8825
03:50:54,520 --> 03:50:55,760
How is that possible?

8826
03:50:56,450 --> 03:50:56,601
I mean,

8827
03:50:56,601 --> 03:50:57,380
there's a lot of them.

8828
03:50:57,380 --> 03:50:57,800
Either way,

8829
03:50:57,800 --> 03:50:58,551
they all look good.

8830
03:50:58,551 --> 03:51:00,170
You're not going to find
one where she looks bad,

8831
03:51:00,171 --> 03:51:01,100
which is a really crazy,

8832
03:51:01,740 --> 03:51:02,573
yeah,

8833
03:51:03,070 --> 03:51:04,210
but that's her.

8834
03:51:04,240 --> 03:51:05,073
You know,

8835
03:51:06,750 --> 03:51:08,470
I'm 62 years.

8836
03:51:08,640 --> 03:51:09,473
Damn.

8837
03:51:09,970 --> 03:51:10,691
She's hot as fuck.

8838
03:51:10,691 --> 03:51:10,990
Look,

8839
03:51:10,990 --> 03:51:12,610
60 fucking two,

8840
03:51:12,760 --> 03:51:13,030
man.

8841
03:51:13,030 --> 03:51:14,440
Holy Shit.

8842
03:51:16,610 --> 03:51:19,160
She must work out all day or not.

8843
03:51:19,370 --> 03:51:20,203
Or something.

8844
03:51:20,360 --> 03:51:21,260
Could be jeans.

8845
03:51:21,261 --> 03:51:23,370
It could be cubic gather.

8846
03:51:23,530 --> 03:51:24,370
She's the right doc.

8847
03:51:24,390 --> 03:51:24,741
Crazy.

8848
03:51:24,741 --> 03:51:25,410
Dot.

8849
03:51:25,410 --> 03:51:25,950
Yeah.

8850
03:51:25,950 --> 03:51:26,100
Who

8851
03:51:26,100 --> 03:51:26,933
knows?

8852
03:51:26,970 --> 03:51:27,631
What do you think it is?

8853
03:51:27,631 --> 03:51:30,030
He would call this back exercise veganism.

8854
03:51:30,060 --> 03:51:30,540
Is It v?

8855
03:51:30,540 --> 03:51:31,373
Does that happen?

8856
03:51:33,090 --> 03:51:33,923
Maybe.

8857
03:51:33,940 --> 03:51:34,770
Maybe some others.

8858
03:51:34,770 --> 03:51:36,060
Maybe there's something to veganism.

8859
03:51:36,900 --> 03:51:37,380
Um,

8860
03:51:37,380 --> 03:51:37,741
I don't know.

8861
03:51:37,741 --> 03:51:41,400
I've never seen anyone like looks
really good and it'll like late age.

8862
03:51:41,490 --> 03:51:42,323
That's a,

8863
03:51:42,680 --> 03:51:45,180
that's saying that that's
the only way to do it.

8864
03:51:45,870 --> 03:51:46,511
They think nobody.

8865
03:51:46,511 --> 03:51:51,210
I think the thing that like a healthy
balanced diet is certainly the way to stay

8866
03:51:51,720 --> 03:51:53,430
at least in reasonably good condition.

8867
03:51:53,431 --> 03:51:58,170
But then you gotta like find the right
amount of amino acids and the right

8868
03:51:58,171 --> 03:51:59,130
amount of vitamins.

8869
03:51:59,131 --> 03:52:00,570
What's it depend on the person.

8870
03:52:00,640 --> 03:52:03,950
What the hell he was Leo each body was he?

8871
03:52:04,560 --> 03:52:04,860
No,

8872
03:52:04,860 --> 03:52:05,070
no.

8873
03:52:05,070 --> 03:52:06,540
He no,

8874
03:52:06,541 --> 03:52:07,620
he no,

8875
03:52:08,670 --> 03:52:09,503
he hit me.

8876
03:52:09,750 --> 03:52:10,470
He grabbed me.

8877
03:52:10,470 --> 03:52:11,550
He had his own farm.

8878
03:52:11,730 --> 03:52:12,331
He had his own,

8879
03:52:12,331 --> 03:52:13,440
like he made his own cheese.

8880
03:52:13,470 --> 03:52:15,210
He lives in his nineties
and he was healthy.

8881
03:52:15,210 --> 03:52:18,060
He was doing harm bars to 93 I don't know.

8882
03:52:18,190 --> 03:52:20,780
I haven't heard of conspiracy about
them doing that weekend at Bernie's with

8883
03:52:20,781 --> 03:52:21,614
him.

8884
03:52:21,690 --> 03:52:22,510
No matter what.

8885
03:52:22,510 --> 03:52:23,343
Come on man.

8886
03:52:23,450 --> 03:52:23,820
I was like,

8887
03:52:23,820 --> 03:52:24,601
Damn Bro.

8888
03:52:24,601 --> 03:52:26,820
I'm on Dario Dario.

8889
03:52:28,260 --> 03:52:29,010
Gotcha.

8890
03:52:29,010 --> 03:52:29,431
Sorry.

8891
03:52:29,431 --> 03:52:29,641
Great.

8892
03:52:29,641 --> 03:52:31,710
He ain't really no did he was,

8893
03:52:31,770 --> 03:52:34,530
he died in his nineties which
is way above the average.

8894
03:52:34,531 --> 03:52:37,450
The average age of
Americans at 75 healing.

8895
03:52:38,190 --> 03:52:42,180
He lived 20 years past the
average and he was still like,

8896
03:52:42,430 --> 03:52:42,660
you know,

8897
03:52:42,660 --> 03:52:43,560
you see him in interviews,

8898
03:52:43,561 --> 03:52:44,070
he's old.

8899
03:52:44,070 --> 03:52:47,220
It's kind of the physical exertion of it
looked like his brain was still intact

8900
03:52:47,221 --> 03:52:48,330
and you know,

8901
03:52:49,050 --> 03:52:51,120
there's something to that
Gracie Diet when he uh,

8902
03:52:51,150 --> 03:52:51,691
well it's,

8903
03:52:51,691 --> 03:52:55,050
it's certainly always smart to watch what
you're eating and making sure you get

8904
03:52:55,051 --> 03:52:59,510
a lot of healthy foods and he wasn't into
anything processed and he bullshit in

8905
03:52:59,540 --> 03:53:00,271
the Gracie Diet.

8906
03:53:00,271 --> 03:53:00,451
Yeah,

8907
03:53:00,451 --> 03:53:01,284
no alcohol.

8908
03:53:01,320 --> 03:53:03,840
The Gracie diet is really interesting
because the idea behind it is that you

8909
03:53:03,841 --> 03:53:05,820
make different enzymes
for different things.

8910
03:53:06,060 --> 03:53:08,360
Like you would never eat
meat with like water.

8911
03:53:08,410 --> 03:53:09,600
We don't make certain foods,

8912
03:53:09,990 --> 03:53:10,591
certain foods.

8913
03:53:10,591 --> 03:53:12,360
And apparently it makes a lot of sense.

8914
03:53:12,810 --> 03:53:14,190
I don't know who came up with it though.

8915
03:53:14,490 --> 03:53:15,360
You know who the,

8916
03:53:15,361 --> 03:53:16,680
who is the originator of that diet?

8917
03:53:16,720 --> 03:53:19,080
Was it Carlos who maybe it was Carlos.

8918
03:53:19,110 --> 03:53:24,110
Carlos was super into like a spiritual
channeling and all sorts of astrology

8919
03:53:27,180 --> 03:53:28,013
follow it.

8920
03:53:29,050 --> 03:53:29,883
Yeah.

8921
03:53:30,120 --> 03:53:30,450
Yeah.

8922
03:53:30,450 --> 03:53:34,530
There's something to that because Henry
Henry's offsite every single night for

8923
03:53:34,531 --> 03:53:34,980
dinner,

8924
03:53:34,980 --> 03:53:38,700
they're doing something right
on that big ass boulevard site.

8925
03:53:38,730 --> 03:53:39,563
That's interesting.

8926
03:53:39,590 --> 03:53:39,920
You know,

8927
03:53:39,920 --> 03:53:43,650
like there's no law and flax
seed and all sorts of stuff.

8928
03:53:43,800 --> 03:53:46,860
Well those videos of these to make
about how to make juices and all these

8929
03:53:46,861 --> 03:53:47,390
different things.

8930
03:53:47,390 --> 03:53:48,420
Energy Sandwich.

8931
03:53:48,780 --> 03:53:49,613
Yeah.

8932
03:53:49,740 --> 03:53:50,100
Well,

8933
03:53:50,100 --> 03:53:50,711
eating healthy,

8934
03:53:50,711 --> 03:53:52,020
he's fucking super important.

8935
03:53:52,030 --> 03:53:52,860
You mean you,

8936
03:53:52,860 --> 03:53:55,230
that's that stupid old
cliche that everybody hates.

8937
03:53:55,231 --> 03:53:56,610
But you are what you eat.

8938
03:53:56,940 --> 03:53:58,500
You are literally what you eat.

8939
03:53:58,670 --> 03:54:01,470
Your body body's made out of all the
nutrients that you put in and all the food

8940
03:54:01,471 --> 03:54:02,304
that you take in.

8941
03:54:02,460 --> 03:54:03,420
If you eat shitty food,

8942
03:54:03,421 --> 03:54:05,550
your body has shitty
materials to work with.

8943
03:54:05,970 --> 03:54:06,990
It's really that simple.

8944
03:54:07,470 --> 03:54:09,360
If you're not healthy and uh,

8945
03:54:09,361 --> 03:54:09,721
you're,

8946
03:54:09,721 --> 03:54:11,010
you're eating shitty food,

8947
03:54:11,040 --> 03:54:13,890
the first thing you should do
is stop eating shitty food.

8948
03:54:13,950 --> 03:54:14,890
It tastes so good though.

8949
03:54:14,920 --> 03:54:17,400
Done that mother fucker dude.

8950
03:54:18,000 --> 03:54:20,220
And two weeks into no shit.

8951
03:54:20,221 --> 03:54:21,330
I've had no shit at all.

8952
03:54:21,331 --> 03:54:22,000
Feel good.

8953
03:54:22,000 --> 03:54:22,700
Chit Chat.

8954
03:54:22,700 --> 03:54:23,350
You,

8955
03:54:23,350 --> 03:54:24,820
your face look skinnier.

8956
03:54:25,610 --> 03:54:26,070
Getting soft.

8957
03:54:26,070 --> 03:54:26,950
Do you feel like it?

8958
03:54:27,550 --> 03:54:27,761
Yeah,

8959
03:54:27,761 --> 03:54:28,241
I'm losing weight.

8960
03:54:28,241 --> 03:54:29,074
I lost eight pounds.

8961
03:54:29,440 --> 03:54:30,273
What do you weigh now?

8962
03:54:30,850 --> 03:54:34,790
One 94 [inaudible] 98 no.

8963
03:54:34,810 --> 03:54:35,680
[inaudible] 94 for real.

8964
03:54:36,010 --> 03:54:36,843
How dare you

8965
03:54:38,850 --> 03:54:39,850
not lost eight pounds.

8966
03:54:39,851 --> 03:54:40,960
I lost four pounds a week.

8967
03:54:40,990 --> 03:54:42,640
What was the most you've way recently?

8968
03:54:42,910 --> 03:54:47,050
I got two oh five when I hurt my back or
got up to like two oh five maybe even a

8969
03:54:47,051 --> 03:54:47,890
little heavier than that.

8970
03:54:48,010 --> 03:54:49,090
I got pretty fat though.

8971
03:54:49,420 --> 03:54:50,350
I had a good belly,

8972
03:54:50,860 --> 03:54:53,580
a good like a side belly and worse.

8973
03:54:54,040 --> 03:54:54,873
I felt gross.

8974
03:54:54,910 --> 03:54:55,960
I would catch myself in the mirror.

8975
03:54:55,961 --> 03:54:57,780
I go ill no more eating for you.

8976
03:54:57,781 --> 03:54:58,614
You fuck.

8977
03:54:58,980 --> 03:54:59,350
You know,

8978
03:54:59,350 --> 03:55:00,810
it got to a well when,

8979
03:55:00,820 --> 03:55:02,080
when my back was really hurting,

8980
03:55:02,081 --> 03:55:03,250
it was really tough to work out.

8981
03:55:03,700 --> 03:55:04,450
Um,

8982
03:55:04,450 --> 03:55:06,400
there was definitely some,

8983
03:55:06,790 --> 03:55:08,590
some time to pack on the weight,

8984
03:55:08,591 --> 03:55:10,120
but as soon as I started
working out again,

8985
03:55:10,121 --> 03:55:11,470
your body's got muscle memory.

8986
03:55:11,740 --> 03:55:13,060
If you know torture,

8987
03:55:13,061 --> 03:55:14,110
it was shitty food.

8988
03:55:14,680 --> 03:55:16,090
But this diet's different man,

8989
03:55:16,091 --> 03:55:20,170
because the idea behind it is that your
body starts going into fat burning mode

8990
03:55:20,200 --> 03:55:21,850
instead of glucose burning mode.

8991
03:55:22,030 --> 03:55:23,140
And if you can do that,

8992
03:55:23,500 --> 03:55:25,240
what happens is what's weird,

8993
03:55:25,270 --> 03:55:25,631
this is the,

8994
03:55:25,631 --> 03:55:27,820
one of the weirdest parts
about it is in between meals.

8995
03:55:27,900 --> 03:55:29,260
I don't get really that hungry.

8996
03:55:29,620 --> 03:55:30,880
I don't get the same kind of hungry.

8997
03:55:30,880 --> 03:55:32,050
Like when you're on glucose,

8998
03:55:32,240 --> 03:55:33,520
like your body crashes,

8999
03:55:33,670 --> 03:55:35,920
your sugar gets low and yeah,

9000
03:55:35,921 --> 03:55:37,000
and that crash,

9001
03:55:37,001 --> 03:55:38,540
you get fucking starving.

9002
03:55:38,541 --> 03:55:40,960
You get desperado following that
take you to get there though.

9003
03:55:41,200 --> 03:55:42,580
It took a while in the workout,

9004
03:55:42,890 --> 03:55:43,723
the workout,

9005
03:55:44,140 --> 03:55:48,850
the workout sucked some fat dicks for
like the first week I told you who's been

9006
03:55:48,851 --> 03:55:51,340
doing that diet for literally
three or four years is Tebow.

9007
03:55:51,370 --> 03:55:52,390
He shredded,

9008
03:55:52,420 --> 03:55:52,571
hey,

9009
03:55:52,571 --> 03:55:53,530
swears by egg,

9010
03:55:54,020 --> 03:55:55,670
won't Kingsbury's on

9011
03:55:58,260 --> 03:56:01,150
Kyle Kingsbury was raving about it
and he's one of the guys that got me

9012
03:56:01,151 --> 03:56:02,980
convinced that this is
definitely the way to go.

9013
03:56:03,970 --> 03:56:04,803
People,

9014
03:56:05,050 --> 03:56:05,570
I don't know.

9015
03:56:05,570 --> 03:56:07,080
I barely as super shredded.

9016
03:56:08,020 --> 03:56:09,570
He's a smart motherfucker,

9017
03:56:09,580 --> 03:56:10,413
man.

9018
03:56:10,540 --> 03:56:11,200
That guy,

9019
03:56:11,200 --> 03:56:11,890
great guy.

9020
03:56:11,890 --> 03:56:15,220
Kingsburg can easily do his own podcast
and I hope he does he ever get ahold of

9021
03:56:15,221 --> 03:56:16,054
you Jamie?

9022
03:56:16,450 --> 03:56:16,780
Yeah.

9023
03:56:16,780 --> 03:56:17,680
You guys working it out?

9024
03:56:17,740 --> 03:56:18,910
He made the ring card girl,

9025
03:56:18,911 --> 03:56:19,270
right?

9026
03:56:19,270 --> 03:56:19,511
Yeah,

9027
03:56:19,511 --> 03:56:20,130
Natasha.

9028
03:56:20,130 --> 03:56:20,920
They have a baby.

9029
03:56:20,920 --> 03:56:21,490
Beautiful,

9030
03:56:21,490 --> 03:56:23,500
something acute doing the damn thing.

9031
03:56:23,680 --> 03:56:24,940
He's an awesome dude.

9032
03:56:25,170 --> 03:56:28,990
He couldn't have been a nicer guy and
he knows a lot about like health and

9033
03:56:28,991 --> 03:56:30,310
nutrition and other bills.

9034
03:56:30,311 --> 03:56:31,630
He knows a lot about a lot of shit.

9035
03:56:32,040 --> 03:56:32,340
Very,

9036
03:56:32,340 --> 03:56:33,350
he's a smart dude.

9037
03:56:33,380 --> 03:56:34,810
I thought little ketone
meter and everything.

9038
03:56:34,960 --> 03:56:35,201
Yeah,

9039
03:56:35,201 --> 03:56:35,480
yeah,

9040
03:56:35,480 --> 03:56:35,801
yeah.

9041
03:56:35,801 --> 03:56:36,011
He,

9042
03:56:36,011 --> 03:56:36,310
um,

9043
03:56:36,310 --> 03:56:36,881
he did it with me,

9044
03:56:36,881 --> 03:56:37,960
but it didn't work then.

9045
03:56:37,961 --> 03:56:38,710
You know what he,

9046
03:56:38,710 --> 03:56:41,470
he's up there for top 10
most shredded UFC fighters.

9047
03:56:42,490 --> 03:56:44,080
He was Jack.

9048
03:56:44,160 --> 03:56:44,261
Well,

9049
03:56:44,261 --> 03:56:46,120
he's only been on that ketogenic diet,

9050
03:56:46,150 --> 03:56:48,070
I think for this past year.

9051
03:56:48,150 --> 03:56:48,440
Some,

9052
03:56:48,440 --> 03:56:48,620
you know,

9053
03:56:48,620 --> 03:56:49,241
some whatever,

9054
03:56:49,241 --> 03:56:49,751
every months,

9055
03:56:49,751 --> 03:56:52,020
but he's always been super healthy.

9056
03:56:52,120 --> 03:56:53,410
Always real good athlete.

9057
03:56:53,440 --> 03:56:54,273
He just got it.

9058
03:56:54,290 --> 03:56:55,540
May that Asu.

9059
03:56:55,541 --> 03:56:56,020
That's right.

9060
03:56:56,020 --> 03:56:57,100
Get into MMA way,

9061
03:56:57,280 --> 03:56:58,113
way late.

9062
03:56:58,840 --> 03:56:59,410
Way late.

9063
03:56:59,410 --> 03:57:00,760
I think 26 that what he said,

9064
03:57:00,761 --> 03:57:01,594
Jamie,

9065
03:57:02,380 --> 03:57:07,380
I remember after you like around
the same time as I got a 24 yeah.

9066
03:57:07,780 --> 03:57:08,420
Well,

9067
03:57:08,420 --> 03:57:09,320
you know in salsa.

9068
03:57:09,340 --> 03:57:10,300
Interesting about him.

9069
03:57:10,630 --> 03:57:11,500
I don't want to talk about it.

9070
03:57:11,501 --> 03:57:13,180
I want to discuss it and want him with on.

9071
03:57:13,390 --> 03:57:13,821
Beautiful.

9072
03:57:13,821 --> 03:57:16,700
What's interesting about
him as he's anti vaccine,

9073
03:57:16,840 --> 03:57:17,673
let's move on.

9074
03:57:17,920 --> 03:57:18,490
Let's move on.

9075
03:57:18,490 --> 03:57:18,730
All right,

9076
03:57:18,730 --> 03:57:19,510
please move on.

9077
03:57:19,510 --> 03:57:20,343
Let's go.

9078
03:57:20,500 --> 03:57:21,560
Vaccines.

9079
03:57:21,590 --> 03:57:22,160
Move on.

9080
03:57:22,160 --> 03:57:23,540
My kid just got back scenes,

9081
03:57:24,170 --> 03:57:25,003
all of them.

9082
03:57:25,040 --> 03:57:25,670
Not all of them.

9083
03:57:25,670 --> 03:57:25,881
Yeah.

9084
03:57:25,881 --> 03:57:26,261
Be careful.

9085
03:57:26,261 --> 03:57:27,410
You get the Hep B one.

9086
03:57:28,220 --> 03:57:30,680
You definitely want to get your kid
vaccinated a hundred percent they want to

9087
03:57:30,681 --> 03:57:35,681
get rid of as many different doctors
that prescribed me what they believe are

9088
03:57:35,961 --> 03:57:37,400
more conservative protocols.

9089
03:57:37,640 --> 03:57:38,960
And there's a lot of doctors,

9090
03:57:38,961 --> 03:57:39,320
again,

9091
03:57:39,320 --> 03:57:43,610
doctors who are leaning towards that
because they feel like it gives your baby

9092
03:57:43,670 --> 03:57:45,410
time to recover from the vaccines.

9093
03:57:45,530 --> 03:57:48,590
And it's not questioning
the efficacy of vaccines.

9094
03:57:48,860 --> 03:57:52,400
It's saying that there might be
some debate as to how many stack,

9095
03:57:52,700 --> 03:57:54,890
like how many put together
they just gave them.

9096
03:57:56,860 --> 03:57:57,560
There is a,

9097
03:57:57,560 --> 03:58:01,400
there's a possibility that if you crunch
them in together that there could be

9098
03:58:01,401 --> 03:58:02,630
problems because there's too much.

9099
03:58:02,631 --> 03:58:03,464
I don't want it.

9100
03:58:03,520 --> 03:58:04,220
There's a,

9101
03:58:04,220 --> 03:58:05,600
there's a vaccine court.

9102
03:58:05,630 --> 03:58:06,410
Okay.

9103
03:58:06,410 --> 03:58:06,981
And if you,

9104
03:58:06,981 --> 03:58:07,940
if you Google it,

9105
03:58:08,600 --> 03:58:12,410
find out how much money has been paid
off by people that took vaccines and got

9106
03:58:12,440 --> 03:58:13,850
injured or ill kids.

9107
03:58:13,851 --> 03:58:15,820
Babies had had issues because of vaccines.

9108
03:58:15,860 --> 03:58:17,900
Shit definitely has existed and,

9109
03:58:17,930 --> 03:58:19,010
but there's also,

9110
03:58:19,730 --> 03:58:22,280
it's also you have to deal with
how many numbers of people.

9111
03:58:22,281 --> 03:58:25,070
You're talking about 300 million people
and you know how many of those people

9112
03:58:25,071 --> 03:58:26,930
are addicted are allergic to walnuts.

9113
03:58:27,260 --> 03:58:28,340
You know how many of those people,

9114
03:58:28,400 --> 03:58:28,700
uh,

9115
03:58:28,700 --> 03:58:28,941
you know,

9116
03:58:28,941 --> 03:58:31,050
if they get around cats die option,

9117
03:58:31,390 --> 03:58:33,230
but that is the exception also.

9118
03:58:33,231 --> 03:58:34,790
Like biodiversity is a real thing.

9119
03:58:34,940 --> 03:58:37,610
They give the same medicine that
they give you and you'd be fine.

9120
03:58:37,730 --> 03:58:39,590
They could give me and
I could get deathly ill.

9121
03:58:39,800 --> 03:58:40,260
That is a,

9122
03:58:40,260 --> 03:58:42,350
that's a natural fact
of being a human being.

9123
03:58:42,590 --> 03:58:44,510
And that's something that there,

9124
03:58:44,550 --> 03:58:48,650
that people don't exactly factor in
when they start talking about vaccines.

9125
03:58:48,770 --> 03:58:51,680
Everybody thinks that it's either some
crazy government conspiracy to make

9126
03:58:51,681 --> 03:58:54,650
everybody retarded or it's
something that you have to do our,

9127
03:58:54,651 --> 03:58:55,484
we're all going to die.

9128
03:58:55,550 --> 03:58:55,761
Well,

9129
03:58:55,761 --> 03:58:56,211
what about,

9130
03:58:56,211 --> 03:58:58,310
what about the CDC study?

9131
03:58:58,560 --> 03:58:59,060
Uh,

9132
03:58:59,060 --> 03:59:01,490
from 2004 that they had to do a study,

9133
03:59:01,491 --> 03:59:03,320
the CDC to make sure that uh,

9134
03:59:03,350 --> 03:59:05,270
the MMR vaccine didn't,

9135
03:59:05,390 --> 03:59:08,600
there wasn't a autism links and there
was three doctors that were in charge of

9136
03:59:08,601 --> 03:59:09,021
that study.

9137
03:59:09,021 --> 03:59:09,830
So when this,

9138
03:59:09,830 --> 03:59:10,020
uh,

9139
03:59:10,020 --> 03:59:14,930
the results showed initially that there
were no links to autism with the MMR

9140
03:59:14,931 --> 03:59:15,620
vaccine,

9141
03:59:15,620 --> 03:59:16,550
but years later,

9142
03:59:16,551 --> 03:59:16,880
and it's,

9143
03:59:16,880 --> 03:59:17,960
it's happening right now.

9144
03:59:17,961 --> 03:59:18,830
One of the doctors,

9145
03:59:18,831 --> 03:59:19,910
Dr. William Thompson,

9146
03:59:19,940 --> 03:59:21,500
he still works for the CDC.

9147
03:59:21,650 --> 03:59:22,970
This is not a conspiracy theory.

9148
03:59:23,090 --> 03:59:23,840
He said,

9149
03:59:23,840 --> 03:59:28,840
we were told to to put all links to autism
from the MMR vaccine into the garbage

9150
03:59:30,201 --> 03:59:30,891
word for word,

9151
03:59:30,891 --> 03:59:32,390
verbatim into the garbage.

9152
03:59:32,510 --> 03:59:33,980
So this is actually happening right now.

9153
03:59:34,100 --> 03:59:37,730
So the studies find that Dr. William S.

9154
03:59:37,730 --> 03:59:39,920
Thompson Mmr vaccine to video.

9155
03:59:39,950 --> 03:59:40,790
Now this is real,

9156
03:59:40,791 --> 03:59:41,031
dude.

9157
03:59:41,031 --> 03:59:42,800
This is not a free youtube videos,

9158
03:59:42,801 --> 03:59:42,950
right?

9159
03:59:42,950 --> 03:59:46,080
We all know what I'm saying is watch.

9160
03:59:46,130 --> 03:59:46,580
Yes,

9161
03:59:46,580 --> 03:59:47,600
you're saying he said that.

9162
03:59:47,601 --> 03:59:47,931
So He's,

9163
03:59:47,931 --> 03:59:48,741
there's a video,

9164
03:59:48,741 --> 03:59:50,990
there's math videos and Madeline,

9165
03:59:51,100 --> 03:59:51,933
how about

9166
03:59:54,970 --> 03:59:55,620
you know,

9167
03:59:55,620 --> 03:59:56,750
insurance circumcision.

9168
03:59:56,751 --> 03:59:57,321
They asked me today,

9169
03:59:57,321 --> 03:59:58,310
you're going to circumcise your baby.

9170
03:59:58,311 --> 03:59:58,610
I said,

9171
03:59:58,610 --> 03:59:58,761
yeah,

9172
03:59:58,761 --> 03:59:59,191
I don't remember.

9173
03:59:59,191 --> 04:00:00,140
Have the anteater day.

9174
04:00:00,380 --> 04:00:01,190
You know what I'm saying?

9175
04:00:01,190 --> 04:00:03,320
$400 to babies Dix.

9176
04:00:03,321 --> 04:00:04,460
When you cut them like that,

9177
04:00:04,700 --> 04:00:05,151
first of all,

9178
04:00:05,151 --> 04:00:06,620
sometimes kids lose their Dick.

9179
04:00:06,650 --> 04:00:07,011
Sometimes.

9180
04:00:07,011 --> 04:00:07,240
Again,

9181
04:00:07,240 --> 04:00:07,960
infections,

9182
04:00:07,960 --> 04:00:08,390
like it's,

9183
04:00:08,390 --> 04:00:09,260
it's dangerous.

9184
04:00:09,261 --> 04:00:10,310
It doesn't always happen.

9185
04:00:10,311 --> 04:00:11,144
You circumstance.

9186
04:00:11,400 --> 04:00:11,631
Yeah,

9187
04:00:11,631 --> 04:00:12,590
but I didn't have a choice,

9188
04:00:12,800 --> 04:00:14,030
but if I had to choose today,

9189
04:00:14,031 --> 04:00:14,361
I would say,

9190
04:00:14,361 --> 04:00:14,601
no,

9191
04:00:14,601 --> 04:00:17,070
I'm on the fence as your
kid circumcised or not.

9192
04:00:17,330 --> 04:00:18,850
We have like three days on site.

9193
04:00:18,900 --> 04:00:19,490
Don't do it.

9194
04:00:19,490 --> 04:00:19,740
It's,

9195
04:00:19,740 --> 04:00:20,250
it's fucking

9196
04:00:20,250 --> 04:00:20,970
mutilation.

9197
04:00:20,970 --> 04:00:24,360
It like it's a cultural thing and
people liked the way it looks better.

9198
04:00:24,510 --> 04:00:25,171
You know whatever,

9199
04:00:25,171 --> 04:00:25,800
man.

9200
04:00:25,800 --> 04:00:27,090
You're mutilating your kids Dick.

9201
04:00:27,150 --> 04:00:28,560
The idea behind is barbaric.

9202
04:00:28,590 --> 04:00:29,423
It's archaic.

9203
04:00:29,700 --> 04:00:31,080
It's unnecessary surgery.

9204
04:00:31,081 --> 04:00:31,914
It's trauma.

9205
04:00:32,100 --> 04:00:33,000
You're cutting the kids.

9206
04:00:33,030 --> 04:00:33,940
Do you have an answer then?

9207
04:00:34,010 --> 04:00:34,843
No.

9208
04:00:34,890 --> 04:00:38,190
If he decides when he gets older to
get circumcised is not hard to do.

9209
04:00:38,191 --> 04:00:41,130
People who have done it like deep into
their thirties you can do whatever you

9210
04:00:41,131 --> 04:00:41,401
want,

9211
04:00:41,401 --> 04:00:43,020
but try telling me it's
under snappy champ.

9212
04:00:43,050 --> 04:00:43,741
That's not true.

9213
04:00:43,741 --> 04:00:44,311
That's not true.

9214
04:00:44,311 --> 04:00:44,970
It's bullshit.

9215
04:00:44,970 --> 04:00:46,370
God gave you that hood for a reason.

9216
04:00:46,400 --> 04:00:47,250
Congressmen,

9217
04:00:47,340 --> 04:00:52,160
a CDC whistleblower and an
autism tempest in a trashcan.

9218
04:00:52,170 --> 04:00:53,190
That's Forbes,

9219
04:00:53,190 --> 04:00:53,630
Huh?

9220
04:00:53,630 --> 04:00:54,463
Hmm.

9221
04:00:54,900 --> 04:00:56,840
I found a site that
didn't seem like a legit,

9222
04:00:56,841 --> 04:01:00,170
once I tried to find something
what everybody would.

9223
04:01:00,171 --> 04:01:01,130
Eddie rather was saying,

9224
04:01:02,120 --> 04:01:03,990
let's just pretend that you
forgot to write it down.

9225
04:01:04,140 --> 04:01:06,620
Talk about something
else and he gets back.

9226
04:01:06,800 --> 04:01:08,860
We got frost can be changed.

9227
04:01:08,870 --> 04:01:10,970
Go deep into the rich quick,

9228
04:01:11,470 --> 04:01:12,080
shut down.

9229
04:01:12,080 --> 04:01:13,230
If we go to page page,

9230
04:01:13,440 --> 04:01:14,690
he theory rabbit hole.

9231
04:01:15,380 --> 04:01:20,380
We're going to need to show booties the
whole please or maybe like feet porn.

9232
04:01:21,040 --> 04:01:21,950
Bring up a throat.

9233
04:01:21,951 --> 04:01:22,784
Zillow,

9234
04:01:23,210 --> 04:01:23,690
Zillow,

9235
04:01:23,690 --> 04:01:24,523
we should get out of here

9236
04:01:26,130 --> 04:01:26,963
early in the morning.

9237
04:01:27,290 --> 04:01:28,640
Let's wrap this motherfucker up.

9238
04:01:28,730 --> 04:01:32,900
This was the most non fight
